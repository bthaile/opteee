 What's up outliers? Today's video is going to be talking about the covered strangle in GameStop. This is actually going to be a practical application. I've taken part of my holdings in GameStop and I am turning it into an example for us to follow. So a while ago during a livestream, we took a look at GameStop together Saturday livestream and I asked, what is the average holding size for GameStop? I looked through the chat and I picked a regularly occurring number or range within there and what I did was take a portion of my GameStop holdings and I'm tracking them desperately from the rest of the portfolio and I'm going to show you how we can trade something I can trade something specifically like the covered strangle in GameStop, which is one of my staple option strategies. There's a very specific use casing GameStop that applies beautifully. But first, let's start with a quick recap of what the covered strangle is. Now I have a couple videos I have an entire playlist actually about this specific strategy because it's one that I use a lot. So I'm going to link to those in the notes below for your viewing pleasure if you want to get a little further into detail. But I'm going to give you a quick overview of what the covered strangle is and then why this fits so well with something like GameStop. So first things first, what is the covered strangle? As you could tell by my very neat hand writing, it is long shares plus hash secured puts, short puts, plus ratio short calls against the long shares. So let's take a look at what this actually looks like. And if you can't tell what these are, these are the risk profiles. This shows you what which what each of these individual positions looks like. And then I will show you what the composite looks like. So I have this pulled up in my pass through IRA account. So I'm recreating the position here with the current basis that I have for these different things. So the position itself is already on. Now at the end of this video, I actually want you to comment what allocation you think I should use for this example. My game plan is to run this example at least for a quarter and do like a weekly update about it could go longer. It's however long we decide that it's interesting. Now to that note, I'm specifically trying to pick an amount of money for the allocation that is applicable to as many people as I possibly can. It's why I picked so far a very small amount of money, but we can modify it to be whatever we would like it to be. Now for me, as I've already explained, GameStop is a very small part of my portfolio. And the main reason I started holding the shares, like specifically holding the GameStop shares was really just to participate and to show some love for what the apes are doing. Cause I still very much consider myself a guest, but I'm a fan. So I like to try to support where I can now what I did was pick an amount of money. $15,000 is what I'm using right now. And that's based on that live stream. And I pulled some of my shares over and I'm tracking them and I'll show you how I'm tracking them. And then I have the rest of the options positions on on top of it. So we're starting with 200 shares of GameStop at a basis of 2431. I actually have a much better basis than this. However, I picked a bit of a midpoint on the chart so that I can track essentially from the period of somebody scaling in during this up move, taking us back to towards the beginning of November. So that's where that basis comes from. Now if we go back to this tab, this is what Longshare's look, it's essentially a positive sloping line that moves one for one dollar for dollar with the underline. So pretty straightforward. Now if I show you the short put component by itself, you'll see that it has capped profit potential, uncapped risk to the downside. Same thing with the other put when you overlay the two different puts, it develops a slightly curved line because of the different expressions and the different strikes, but it's essentially the same. capped profit potential undefined risk to the downs. Then if we add short calls by themselves, you'll see that we have risk to the upside and defined profit to the downside. Now the ensemble of all of these put together is very purposeful. So the basis for the coverage strangle with respect to what we're doing here is very specific to those that are holding shares of GameStop already that just want to hold the stock. And the way that I look at trading the coverage strangle is for those kinds of people that would like to hold the stock anyways. It is a method to make a little bit more money on something that you're going to hold anyways. So we start with our 200 shares. We layer on that short call. Notice how it's only one short call against the 200 shares. This is for two primary reasons. One, it makes sure I do not have capped upside if I chose to exit the trade as a whole meaning I close the call, I close the shares at the same time exit the whole thing. The other thing is it gives me more ability to manage these calls should they wind up in the money. And that will be a further video for when it hopefully eventually happens. And I can walk you through how I can avoid being assigned on these calls, although it is always a risk, which is why I keep it at a ratio, because I don't actually want the shares to go away. It's always a risk. But we can do things to minimize it, which again, as we get into the management of the position and the strategy and you'll see more of that. And then we have additional short puts on beyond just the long shares. And there's a reason why these short puts work so well in something like GameStop. So this is what the entire position looks like on a risk profile by itself. Pretty simple. It maintains a upward sloping line. So it still has unlimited profit potential. And it maintains the downside cap is whatever we put into the trade essentially. So it's planning for in this scenario that going to zero. This trade would lose 12,000 through 1224 bucks, something like that. That's if GameStop went to zero, which right now doesn't look like it's going to do. So let's now take a look at why the coverage strangle in GameStop. Well, there's a few things that contribute really, really well. The way that I trade GameStop directionally is very different than what I'm showing you here. Again, the coverage strangle in this context is designed for something that you would want to hold anyways. Now, the way that I trade it when it's moving around a lot, I'll use single options and trade the actual direction. The purpose of this strategy is to optimize an existing holding position of stock. So the base position in the coverage strangle is long shares. And then the options are just to amplify the position. GameStop presents a really interesting opportunity because it's very, very high volatility. And the options positions that we use in the strategy are both short options positions. So it means we're selling. We're selling options in something that is very high volatility. That means that you're going to make a lot more money on a relative basis compared to selling options on something with lower volatility. You're also taking advantage of some structural components of volatility, things like volatility risk premium of your P. Now, that sounds a little heavy, but it's a very simple concept. If we take a look at this chart of GameStop, you'll notice this is volatility. This yellow line is implied volatility for a 30 day timeframe. This gray line is one month vault 21 days technically, but it's also one month vault. So both yellow and gray are one month volatility. Notice how in general, implied volatility is higher than realized volatility. In general, when you sell options, you capture some of this depending on how you structure the trade and manage it. But in general, when you're selling options, if implied volatility remains elevated, it means that you are collecting more premium than the underlying is actually moving. So there is an edge baked into this from the options perspective, which is why something like GameStop is so advantageous. It has 110% IV. That's for a 30 day timeframe. The implied volatility percentiles 53%. So it's very, very high volatility. And for comparison, if this doesn't make a lot of sense to you, let's take a look at Apple, a IPO, Apple is 26.6% vol. This is a 68% implied volatility percentile. Implied volatility percentile is a really simple metric that plots all of the previous for the last year implied volatility numbers against the current implied volatility. And this simply tells you that the current level of vol is higher than 68% of the time. This is very high. So then if we go to GameStop by comparison, it's almost quadruple plus the volatility from on average right now, vol is actually a little bit low in here. But it's 110% vol compared to 25% vol. And notice how implied volatility percentile is lower, even though this is so much higher than Apple. It means that on an average basis, GameStop is way more volatile. So you can capture that via short options. Now there is another great benefit to trading the coverage strangle on something like GameStop. And it's because of this short call component. And I'll explain why typically speaking when we are selling options, options most often will exhibit what is called put skew. That means that the puts are priced more richly compared to the corresponding out of the money call. So let's take a look and see if that's the case in Apple. Actually, I don't know. I haven't looked yet. So at 29 delta put 36 days out, the volume here is 26.9%. 26.99% call 27. That's for the 29 delta. There's no 29 delta call. There's a 31. So let's see what the 31 is. The 31 is 23.75. So even though this is in even higher delta, notice that this volatility is much higher on the put side than the call side. That is because the market tends to price puts more expensively than calls. And that's because the markets tend to crash down and they kind of slowly go up saying is elevator down. There's up. Okay. Let's take a look at GameStop. Now before we do that, let's just mentally note what the market is. This is in terms of all 23.7 against 27. So about four points ish. So now let's take a look at GameStop. And let's do the same thing around a 30 delta. So I see a 29 delta here. These are running an 87.2% vol. This is at a 29 delta. If we could find a 29 on this side, 29 delta on this side is 143.37%. Notice how psychotically high that is compared to the same put. And notice how it's completely different than what I just showed you in Apple. And what you saw in Apple is normal. This is abnormal. You do not see calls priced as richly as they are in a relative basis against puts in most tickers. This is because the market fears the upside and GameStop. And it's pricing those really big swings that it has. So this goes all the way back the opportunity because GameStop is high volatility, you're going to benefit on the short puts because GameStop uniquely has exceedingly high volatility on the call side rather than what you typically get in the coverage strungle on like an index ETF. So it's not really healthy that much because you collect a little bit on them, but there's not a lot of all in them on a relative basis to the puts in GameStop. It's the opposite. You make a lot of money on a relative basis by selling the calls. So this is a really lucrative selling position that again is based on the premise that we just want to hold the stock anyways because the short puts are cash secured. So what this means is if the stock expires below my strike on the puts, there are things we can do to manage to avoid getting assigned there. We can roll out, roll out and down, which will probably do all of that at some point. But you want to own the stock anyways. And this isn't like the superficial people that sell a put and they collect the premium and they say, oh, I want to buy the stock anyways. And then the stock plummets and they're like, wait a minute, I don't actually want to stock. It's I'm beyond that. I've thought through that enough. I've seen enough of these cycles that when I'm selling these puts at spots that I actually would want to be assigned, I'm selling them pretty aggressively closer to add the money. So that's why it's something that you want to hold anyways. The difference is let's say we're using a $15,000 position rather than going into the long shares and just buying all $15,000 worth. We maybe do a little bit less, maybe $10,000 worth or less than that. And then get the rest via those short puts so that you can capture some of that premium particularly when the underlying is doing stuff like this, kind of trending sideways or even coming down a little. So let's talk about the payment plan. The risk in my GameStop coverage triangle is defined by size, the allocation. That means that I would be completely okay and comfortable if GameStop went to zero, meaning my entire investment is lost. That's not the standard for most of what I trade. Most of what I trade is way more actively managed with stops and things like that. But I'm using my allocation as my risk management approach. And that is because I know GameStop can go through prolonged periods or kind of just trend sideways goes down a little bit and those can actually be really great accumulation faces. So my risk is defined by the allocation. Again, not my normal, but when I'm trading the coverage triangle, that's generally the case. Now if I'm trading the coverage triangle on something like a leveraged ETF, I normally might have some sort of trend following different scenario. So that's the risk management perspective. Now I do not intend to unwind the shares unless we're in the process of a squeeze. And I would define that as any sort of movement similar to this where we're seeing volume jacking, we're seeing price double triple plus at least doubling. So that means from current steady state right now, I wouldn't unwind any shares until it is at least above 50, probably closer to 60. And the share unwind in that instance is not to get out of the stock. It's to realize a profit to make more money to then some more puts and buy more stock. That's the beauty of the strategy. So it's opportunistic upside unwinds to realize the game so that I can then use the money to buy more when it comes down. Because as we know from squeezes, they're short term. They don't last forever. They actually typically last fairly briefly. So what I'm doing is I'm setting targets based on double current price. So double current price starts to open unwind potential for the shares. So that's the upside. Now the next management component is how am I deciding between selling puts versus buying shares? And it's by price direction and standard analysis. If I see price doing what it's doing now, trending sideways, this period and here is via short puts. Then if we had a period like this where it's more aggressively rising, I would take some of the short puts in and buy the shares outright. Because I will make more money on the move as it goes. So the goal for the strategy is to remain pretty much always at least 70% invested if not more. And depending on what the stock is doing, it will have been flow. How much of that is going to be in shares outright versus cash secured puts, but there will always be both. Okay. So now let's take a look at the actual positions as they are as I've pulled them over. So I started doing this on the eighth of November is when I marked the shares that I took over from the other part of the portfolio wasn't really trading the coverage strangle in it. Then as you can tell, this is eight November, and we don't actually start with the options component for this example until mid December. But that's what we're picking up from. So the and this is just to show you an example, I intend to wipe the slate clean and start the year with just the shares. So right now we have a $15,000 allocation. And the current requirement is 13k. So we are 89% utilized for the example period of where I got in not where I started trading options and actually trading the coverage strangle, which is 18 December. I'm using the price from here on eight November from eight November to current GameStop is returned 26%. The strategy is it sits as I run it is returned 29.2%. So several point variance over this and I have realized gains as part of what I'm doing. And again, I want to drive home the point that I'm using this start date of eight November, but I didn't start the options component until a month and a half later. This would be much better off if I use the comparison from 18 December to now, but I'm using from when I got the shares. So I've had a couple short puts that have come down for super cheap nothing really to write home about. And from the call side, we still have the initial offering that's set out at the 35s. So this is what the position looks like now. And this is what I think is the same as the one that I'm using. I will show you as we move forward and as we continue to manage and work around the position. I will be managing all of these as I would any other trade. Again, we have 200 shares at 2431. And we have two contracts of the 21 Feb 28s. We have one contract of the 24 Jan 29s here. And then we have one contract of the 17 Jan 35s. So that's what it sits as a contract of the 24 Jan 25s. So I'm going forward. I will give you weekly updates on this. What's happening, how it's going, management, all that kind of stuff. The last thing I need from you, though, is I need you to let me know in the comments is how much money do we want to use for the allocation? I can pair this down. I can scale this up. I want to drive home the point. I don't want to just do whatever number you guys think would be cool. I want to do a lot of things like that, but I want to do a lot of things like that. So I want to do something that I want to do with the $20,000 for the $20.00.00. So I want to do a lot of things like that, I want to do a lot of things like $20,000 for the $20,000.00. So if you have a smaller account, I want this to be relevant to you so that you have an example of what this can look like for a very basic you think we should do what's most relevant to you and then we will see what we can do. If you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
