0.00s: Send a trade off and then figure out what you're going to do about it later, right?
4.32s: That sounds about right for most of us.
6.40s: And if you're anything like me, when I first started trading back in 2007, I was in high
11.04s: school and I was a super patient young man, obviously not the case.
16.08s: So the goal of this video is actually to walk you through risk management and options
20.34s: trading, specifically what I wish I knew 16 years ago.
24.12s: What's up everybody?
25.12s: Eric here.
26.12s: We'll come back to the outliers shout out to the Patreon.
27.92s: Let's get straight into it.
30.04s: So what's the purpose of this topic?
33.52s: It's kind of straightforward, but it's so that you don't end up like this person, which
38.36s: I can't really pronounce their name, but this is actually from the options subreddit.
43.24s: They lost 167,000 dollars.
46.84s: Then we got this person from Wall Street Betts, who's down 98.81%.
53.24s: This person who's essentially asking subreddit if they should wheel this thing with 550 bucks.
60.16s: We got this person who lost $650,000 on short calls.
64.64s: It looks like maybe long calls.
66.72s: Yeah, it looks like long calls.
68.08s: Who knows at this point?
69.44s: Then we have another one from Wall Street Betts where we are down actually a impressive 101%
77.64s: kind of good for them, really overachieving here.
80.04s: What I'm highlighting is this is what most people do.
83.12s: It is a fact of the trade that most people that get into trading start off have cocked.
89.40s: I did.
90.80s: And unfortunately for these people, they obviously had some gambling issues and sizing issues,
97.44s: which we'll talk about all of those throughout this video.
100.04s: But specifically at the end of the video, I want to outline five steps to manage risk
106.32s: better.
107.32s: That's it.
108.32s: So that I'm going to lay a foundation for you on why this stuff matters.
111.60s: Talk to you about some cognitive biases.
113.28s: Give you my risk hierarchy, how I view it.
116.60s: And then my approach to risk management and then also, you know, quick shout out, if you're
120.76s: going to post a screenshot, at least have some battery power, you heave in there less
124.52s: than 50%.
125.52s: That's just kind of unacceptable.
127.40s: Okay.
128.96s: So now that we know kind of the risk of trading options and what realistically happens
135.64s: to the majority of people, we need to.
138.28s: To find what our individual purposes beyond avoiding this fate, for me, it was to enable
146.52s: long term compounding.
148.20s: That's what I cared about.
149.28s: And I've shared my story a bunch of times.
150.56s: I'm not going to bore you with it in this video.
152.76s: What I want to draw your attention to are the different ways we can make money in the
157.20s: market.
158.20s: So you'll notice that as we go further down on our account draw downs, the larger the
164.12s: return required is in order to get back to break even.
167.52s: So in this case, if you draw down 40% in order to get back to break even, you have to see
172.08s: an appreciation of 66.7%.
175.24s: That's not making any money.
176.32s: That's getting just back to break even.
178.76s: So what I want to draw your attention to specifically are these different portfolios,
182.96s: because you notice that portfolio three actually has a better return, a better average return
187.12s: of 8.6%.
188.60s: But notice how the compound annual growth rate is 6.87% compared to portfolio one that has
196.12s: a lower average return of 1.2% at 7.4%.
201.24s: Yet, they have a better compound annual growth rate.
204.24s: How is that?
205.24s: Because they're not experiencing as much whipsaw in their return profile.
210.08s: So for me, this is what I focused on.
213.00s: And over the lifecycle of my trading, I've evolved what my purpose was.
217.96s: However, what always stuck with me is limiting the draw down on my account.
224.20s: And that's actually led to me only posting two negative years.
227.64s: And that was my first two years of trading.
230.44s: In the beginning, I was just really risk averse.
232.92s: However, what I started to realize as I was creating what I call my millionaire roadmap,
237.52s: what I was trying to accomplish, I noticed that even by having more conservative top line
243.06s: returns, by limiting my draw downs, I was actually accelerating my compound growth
249.60s: target and rate massively.
252.44s: So that's exactly why this was my purpose.
256.12s: You have to define yours.
257.12s: And I encourage you to do that.
258.60s: When you think about your approach to managing risk in trading, not just options, it can't
263.44s: just be, I don't want to blow up.
265.04s: If it's something so nebulous, it doesn't mean anything.
268.16s: I would quantify it very specifically.
270.48s: I do not want to have a greater than 30% draw down on my total portfolio.
276.84s: Whatever it is for you, that makes sense.
278.52s: But you have to go through this process.
280.16s: If you just say the easy answer of, oh, I'm just going to limit draw downs or I just
284.16s: want less portfolio variance.
285.40s: Yeah, it sounds good.
287.00s: But unless you start getting specific with it, it's, you're just saying things that sound
291.32s: good.
292.32s: That's it.
293.32s: It doesn't get us anywhere.
294.32s: So now let's set a foundation.
296.24s: There are two kinds of risk you have to be aware of.
298.72s: There's systemic and unsystemic risk.
302.28s: Systemic risk, the way to think about it is the meteor that's coming towards Earth.
306.32s: It impacts everything.
307.64s: There's not much you can do to shelter from it.
310.04s: It just kind of is a massive thing that touches a lot of stuff simultaneously.
315.80s: So in the stock market specifically, this is like the bubble that we saw in 2007, 2008
322.52s: when the housing market collapsed and that impacted just about everything on the stock market.
327.52s: That kind of thing.
328.52s: Unsystemic risk is you, it's you the trader.
331.40s: It's what you inject into the system and what you do to yourself via things like irresponsible
339.12s: position sizing because we're greedy or having things that represent the same directional
344.32s: risk without really knowing it or having products that move the same or by placing a bunch
350.64s: of trades before Big Daddy J pal is coming out to drop to hammer on everybody's hopes that
355.80s: the fed rates are not getting cut anytime soon.
358.92s: These are risk sources that you the trader inject.
363.12s: So now what I want to talk to you a little bit about is the psychology of risk.
367.72s: The reason why this matters and I'll try to keep it quick because there's a lot to go
370.64s: through here.
371.80s: But this is the underpinning of what people do.
374.76s: And as I frequently tell you all, you shouldn't take my word for it.
377.56s: You should look things up and there are tons of studies on this.
381.24s: And if you're in the Patreon, you have access to all of these.
383.76s: I bundled them for you so it's convenient to download all in one spot on the Patreon
388.36s: shop.
389.36s: You can just grab all of these at once.
390.80s: But I'm going to tap into a handful of these psychological risk factors that I would
396.00s: deem to be the largest contributors to people struggling in trading.
402.00s: The first one is good times analysis.
404.56s: What I mean by this is we have a habit where we think about the ideal scenario.
410.48s: So if you're putting on a trade, most traders are thinking about the profit that they're
414.04s: going to take as compared to what it could look like if it doesn't go our way.
420.28s: Big problem.
421.28s: The other thing is when we're looking at our performance, there tends to be a dissonance
427.84s: between what we think we did and how well that performed compared to what actually happened
433.32s: and how it actually performed.
435.00s: That's really why it's really important to keep a trade log and even a trade journal
439.28s: if you're still in decline.
440.28s: I don't really have one.
441.28s: I integrate some of that into my log so that I can keep myself honest because it's so
444.76s: easy to have false recollections because we're trying to cope.
448.92s: If we don't really appreciate how massive the ego is in this process, I can't overemphasize
456.00s: it because when you think about our role as a trader, it's just you versus you.
461.00s: There's nobody else to look at what you're doing or analyze if what you're doing makes
464.40s: sense or not.
465.48s: And a lot of us over time, especially as you start to get good at trading, you run into
471.32s: a few problems.
472.88s: One of them is the good old Dunning Kruger effect, which is actually massively driven by
477.00s: ego.
478.00s: When we start something and we know that we don't know anything so our confidence is low,
482.80s: but our competence is also low because we're just starting something.
486.12s: Then you spend two to three years really trying super hard, you're studying for dozens
490.76s: of hours a week, you're putting in the time and effort and now you feel like you've earned
496.28s: your way to knowledge.
497.84s: Unfortunately, this tends to be where we have the largest issue.
502.92s: This is where we think we're smarter than the market.
505.20s: This is where we become so obsessed with our own ideas and how good our research is
511.16s: that we kind of forget to remind ourselves that the market doesn't care about our ideas.
516.68s: The market's going to do whatever the market's going to do.
518.72s: Don't give a fuck.
519.88s: So what this means is you start to outsmart the market.
523.96s: You're putting on positions that they can't lose, you're sizing up, whatever the case
527.88s: is.
528.88s: And then you finally realize risk.
531.48s: Risk is always realized sooner or later.
533.52s: One of those dangerous things that happens from an ego perspective is if you start trading
538.04s: and you actually win a bunch up front because then you think you're better than you are.
542.04s: And again, sooner or later, the market will humble you.
545.04s: And if you think about the perspective of a trader, we're trying to not trade for a
549.76s: year, five year, 10 years, 20 years.
551.64s: We're trying to trade for a lifetime.
552.96s: We're trying to create life changing wealth and to sustainably do it over time.
558.68s: So thinking about things like our ego, the Dunning Crewger effect, they're massive.
563.80s: A couple of the things I want to highlight from this list and then you're free to check
566.64s: out whatever you want up front is the disposition effect.
571.16s: And that's actually from the behavior of individual investors, this study here.
574.88s: This is the tendency where we like to take winning trades down too fast and let losing
579.80s: trades run.
580.80s: This happens for two reasons.
582.40s: One, from a psychological perspective, we like realizing again, we feel good.
587.56s: Our ego likes that.
588.56s: We're confronted with the outcome that we did a good job.
591.80s: We don't like confronting ourselves with the fact that we did something that didn't work
595.48s: well.
596.48s: And then this is where we start hoping that it works out, typically doesn't.
600.92s: The other thing to know about the disposition effect and how it roots in our brains is
606.80s: kind of primal actually.
608.60s: And it's called loss of version.
610.64s: And this kind of has primal rooting where we don't look at the value of a gain or
617.32s: a commensurate loss the same.
619.64s: And this happens because once your basic life needs are met, the prospect of losing a
624.68s: little bit is problematic because then it can set you below what you need for basic needs.
630.48s: But this also carries over into other markets where you can actually have a better expected
635.04s: return to the outside to the upside versus losing to the downside.
639.56s: So what that means is, say, for example, if it's a fair coin flip and you can win one
644.20s: and a half units if it's heads and you lose one unit or one and a quarter units if it's
650.24s: tails, people don't wait those outcomes appropriately, whereas that has positive expected
657.12s: return, but people become too risk averse.
660.16s: And if you offered them the ability to just take a dollar up front, even though that system
664.96s: would potentially make them more, they wouldn't take that trade.
669.28s: So that's loss of version.
670.56s: Now a couple other things, effort gap is a big one with respect to trading.
674.68s: And this is where traders feel like because they put in a ton of effort that they deserve
678.60s: something, that the market owes them to be right, that the, you know, because they've
682.68s: spent hundreds of hours, they should be performing well because of all that effort.
687.12s: It doesn't matter.
688.12s: Literally doesn't matter.
689.12s: You can spend a lot of time doing this stuff and it still might not be the right fit
692.36s: for you.
693.36s: It is what it is.
694.36s: The other thing I want to highlight here specifically is the skill gap.
699.00s: This is where you look at people that are doing things really well and you don't fully
703.88s: understand how much is going into making that happen.
707.08s: I typically use the example of surfing or Jujitsu.
710.48s: People who are good at both of those make it look effortless, but there's a ton of time
714.76s: and effort that goes into being successful at either of those.
718.56s: It's the same thing in trading.
719.92s: And then the last one, traders get way too wrapped up in individual positions as compared
726.80s: to this system that they're attempting to interface with.
730.64s: So what this means is sometimes you put on an individual trade and you are just so
735.80s: focused on how that one trade does.
737.96s: So you're breaking your rules, you're making exceptions because you think you can make
741.48s: this one trade work, but you forget that this is a really long term iterative process
746.88s: and you're building a bunch of bad habits.
749.32s: So before we move on now to the risk hierarchy in the comments below, let me know what you
753.76s: would add to this list because there's way more than just this.
757.44s: And that's kind of a scary prospect, but it is the truth.
760.96s: There's way more that goes into the psychology of risk for traders.
766.00s: Okay.
767.00s: This is how I think about risk in the markets.
769.72s: It starts from a broad perspective and then we zoom in further and further and further.
773.64s: So we start with the market, then we look at our portfolio risk, then we look at individual
778.16s: strategy risk and then position.
781.00s: So this actually gets pretty straightforward and I'm going to give you a handful of questions
786.68s: or considerations for each of these to then integrate into your thought process with respect
793.20s: to risk in trading.
794.48s: So the first one, when we think about the market, I typically take up broad view.
798.32s: So I'm going to conduct a broad market analysis, look at things like net highs and lows, moving
802.72s: averages, just to get a sense of how the market is trending.
806.04s: I'm also going to see how earnings for the last quarter have been.
809.20s: See if there's any big economic events coming out or that the market is particularly sensitive
813.60s: to a good example of that right now is the rate environment markets, hyper sensitive to
817.72s: that as of this moment, whereas back in 2013, yeah, not so much because it wasn't so
823.84s: topical then and also how volatile things are.
826.88s: The reason why I look at all of this before I even start thinking about the risk of positions
831.36s: is because this informs how I structure my risk later on.
836.44s: So for example, if I'm trading earnings plays and the earnings so far has been all over
843.00s: the place that's going to inform what strategies I might use and how I'm going to set those
849.20s: strategies up.
850.68s: So this is laying a foundation for further decision.
853.40s: Then we look at the portfolio.
855.08s: So from a portfolio level, when I'm first deciding how I conceive of risk, I think about
861.16s: max drawdown for the portfolio that's super important.
864.64s: And this is where you determine what is the maximum allowable capital drawdown you will
869.28s: accept in your portfolio before you deploy circuit breakers.
873.56s: And circuit breakers are literally when you start liquidating positions, even if it might
877.28s: not make sense to make sure that you're not missing something that there's not some sort
881.04s: of fundamental shift that happened that you might not be aware of whatever the case is
885.28s: so that you do not start bleeding capital way more than you should because even if something
890.64s: goes down, let's say 30% you exit and then it starts to rebound that might work in that
897.32s: one scenario, but there can be another scenario where it goes down to 30% drawdown and then
902.56s: you say, Oh, I've been here before it's fine.
904.40s: And then it goes down to 60% drawdown.
906.72s: And again, this has to be personalized to you as a trader.
909.60s: Some traders really like to focus their risk into small buckets and accept much higher
915.04s: portfolio variance.
916.16s: So maybe your max drawdown on your portfolio is a bigger metric because you expect much
920.12s: bigger winners when they come, but it has to make sense for you.
923.48s: For me, I break out my portfolio into core and speculative allocations.
928.28s: I'll throw a video in the notes below that walks through how I do that and how I allocate
932.36s: capital to both of them, but that's a massive part of how I manage risk in the portfolio
937.88s: writ large.
938.88s: I'm also going to use things like beta weighted delta to see how my portfolio looks at
942.92s: a given point in time.
944.24s: Again, I have a video on that.
945.52s: I'll throw in the notes below.
947.56s: And the whole point behind this is to make sure that I'm understanding the disposition
951.08s: of all of my positions in one common language.
953.68s: Now, going back to capital in the portfolio, one of the things I think people forego thinking
959.20s: about is margin expansion.
961.52s: So when you put on an options trade and let's say you're putting on a hypothetical short
965.12s: position in hood because you hate hood as much as I do and no matter how good it's
968.84s: doing or how good it looks to the upside.
970.64s: None of that matters.
971.64s: We should still always fade hood because well, we hate hood and you sell a call.
976.76s: When you first put that position on, your brokerage doesn't require a certain amount
979.92s: of money and that margin requirement in this case is something like a thousand bucks.
984.36s: However, if the underlying starts moving against you and let's say it goes up one standard
989.84s: deviation, your margin requirement is now $1,700 and let's say it goes up to standard
994.00s: deviations now it's $2,600 and if it goes up three standard deviations, now it's
997.48s: up $3,900 margin moves.
1001.24s: So if you're trading using options, that's great.
1003.32s: You're gaining effective leverage and being more capital efficient.
1006.64s: However, you have to be mindful of how margin will move throughout the life cycle of a
1010.16s: position.
1011.16s: Again, you can't have goal deluxe scenario analysis where you're just thinking about
1015.36s: things when they go well.
1016.84s: So for me, I would absolutely consider something like a three standard deviation move against
1022.16s: me to understand what it might look like.
1024.32s: It's insanely improbable, but they do happen.
1027.28s: And that's the way that my brain thinks about managing risks so that I don't get caught.
1031.44s: The other things I'm going to look at in the portfolio are the correlation between products
1034.80s: to make sure that I'm not putting on five different positions that really all behave
1038.44s: like the same one without knowing it.
1040.24s: I'm also going to take a look at what days to expiration.
1042.80s: I have for all my different positions.
1044.44s: What needs to be managed because of time-based reasons?
1046.96s: Am I at risk of early assignment?
1049.96s: Do I have positions that I want to roll because they're being challenged?
1054.48s: All of those things get baked into this broad portfolio overview.
1058.72s: And then I'm also going to make sure that there's no specific event risk coming up that
1062.52s: impacts my positions.
1063.96s: So if you happen to have a position on in technology and Nvidia has earnings coming out, especially
1069.52s: with the market as it is today, that's a consideration to have that you should be aware of.
1074.04s: So the portfolio, I'm literally just looking at these broad buckets.
1077.92s: There's quite a bit more that I personally would look at, but I think this is a fine place
1082.08s: to start.
1083.08s: Now, let's get into the individual strategies here.
1086.04s: This is when we need to determine what risk management protocols make sense for the strategy
1090.60s: that we're using.
1091.88s: So in this case, we can't just take a guess.
1094.84s: There's no way that you could just say, I'm going to do blank and it make any sense or
1099.08s: it be something that you would follow because you don't trust it.
1102.64s: Why would you?
1103.96s: So for me, this is where I go through the process of back testing, forward testing, cutting
1108.56s: the tails, and then developing strategy specific risk management rules.
1113.68s: I have a video down below that goes into this idea of cutting the tails and I have another
1119.44s: video that goes through how to build a strategy.
1122.24s: The Clif notes version of this is that we really need to make sure that we're keeping
1127.50s: expected return in mind.
1130.36s: So for example, if I'm trading a strategy and I have the possibility to make two units
1136.48s: and I'm risking four units to make those two units, depending on the probabilistic outcome
1141.28s: of those scenarios, it may or may not make sense.
1144.00s: What's important here is to figure out what that looks like for your individual strategy
1148.76s: to then make decisions.
1149.96s: So again, for example, for me, if I'm trading things that are more speculative in nature,
1155.80s: I typically will give them less room to move, expecting to be wrong more often.
1162.20s: So I'll have a lower average loss amount, but a higher loss frequency.
1168.48s: It's a way for me to manage trades.
1170.92s: And then I layer in scaling on top of that.
1173.76s: So for example, if I'm entering a breakout trade that I want to go to the upside and
1179.20s: I pretty speculative in nature, I will find a stop that makes sense for the strategy,
1185.52s: because if I'm trading a breakout kind of trade, it doesn't make sense to use profit
1190.32s: or loss management.
1191.64s: That's predicated on random numbers.
1193.96s: If I lose two times the credit I received, then this is no longer good for me.
1198.32s: If it's a trend following strategy, it doesn't make sense because I'm trading the chart.
1203.28s: I'm trading the price action.
1205.08s: So what I'm going to do in those kinds of scenarios is look to create a reference.
1208.80s: So if I sold that call in Robinhood, which as much as it pains me to say right now,
1212.68s: I probably wouldn't do because it's showing some strength and you have to go all the way
1215.80s: out to three years to find the near term resistance.
1219.36s: But it's still here.
1220.36s: It's somewhere around this handle we can see that there's a big stair step down.
1225.08s: And this is where I would look to say, OK, if I deem near term resistance for this short
1231.60s: call or whatever strategy it is, in this case, going short hood because I hate it.
1237.00s: And then we zoom in and we say, OK, so if I want to fade this to the downside for whatever
1240.96s: reason, this is where I'm prospecting short term resistance would be.
1245.68s: If we break above that, what would the loss on my position be?
1249.44s: Am I OK with that loss as a dollar amount or percentage of my portfolio?
1254.56s: And does this all line up?
1256.68s: You have to make sure that whatever you're choosing to set for your strategy specific risk
1261.96s: management protocols makes sense for the specific strategy in that specific opportunity.
1267.92s: But then you have to zoom out and make sure that it fits into your portfolio.
1270.72s: So let's say, for example, instead of the risk management occurring somewhere on 2145,
1277.04s: let's say that I go out again, there's three years and let's say that I for whatever reason
1280.56s: think this is where the stop would occur for me.
1285.28s: If this makes sense for me to get stopped out all the way up at 2841.
1290.64s: And if I still really like the trade, but the loss looks like it might be too big, then
1294.72s: maybe I scale the size of the trade down.
1297.40s: If I look at that loss and I say, yeah, based on how much money I think I could make,
1302.04s: which in this case, it would be the credit received on the long option.
1305.28s: But if I think this is where it might trend to before it stops me out, then in the scenario,
1310.80s: I'm in possibly looking to make a hundred bucks, but risking several thousand.
1315.76s: It starts to not make sense.
1317.36s: So the opportunity that you're trading has to fit whatever you've tested for your strategy,
1324.36s: which can't be random.
1326.08s: And one other note here is that you can go broke taking profits, go back to the disposition
1331.56s: effect.
1332.56s: And then to this cycle where you look to manage your risk too fast, taking all your winners
1337.40s: down at tiny little winner amounts, you'd have a really high win rate.
1341.08s: But then whenever you eventually have a really big loss, it's going to wipe out all of your
1344.60s: winners.
1345.60s: And then you're still negatively expecting.
1348.08s: So you have to make sure it makes sense.
1350.56s: And the way we do this is by testing back test, forward test, the tails off, then make
1355.88s: sure that you can fit it to the individual opportunity.
1358.84s: Well, last bit.
1360.48s: You know who these two people are, comment in the notes below.
1364.68s: These are two great references.
1366.08s: And I'll get into that in just a second.
1368.00s: But here are the five steps to better risk management.
1370.48s: The first one is predetermined your profit and loss management protocols for every single
1375.00s: trade before you enter.
1376.00s: That's it.
1377.00s: That's one of the easiest things you can do before you press the button to enter a trade
1380.52s: define how you're going to manage it to the upside to the downside and make sure that
1385.32s: it makes sense for the strategy and the position, meaning it has positive expected return.
1390.44s: Again, we need to make sure that we're tracking our P and L for the portfolio and trade levels,
1396.48s: which are broker will do that for you.
1398.36s: But as it goes to different extremes for your max drawdown, you have to track that because
1404.48s: we should get to a point where based on what you're attempting to return, you can establish
1408.16s: circuit breakers.
1409.16s: So again, for me, my portfolio draws down more than 25%.
1412.52s: That's a circuit breaker.
1413.72s: It means I'm cutting trades to figure out what's going on and to reduce the drawdown further.
1418.72s: And again, I accept the fact that if it gets 25%, it might just rebound right back up.
1423.36s: That's okay because I'm a process oriented trader.
1427.32s: I know maybe that one instance, that's what happened.
1430.48s: Another instance, it might be another 2007, 2008 where the market goes on to drop another
1435.48s: 30% over two weeks.
1437.40s: I'm not going to let that happen.
1438.88s: So you have to figure out what makes sense for you here.
1440.92s: But the important part is to think about this stuff before it's happening because that's
1444.16s: when you're logical and thinking clearly, it's not going to happen when you're in the
1447.48s: middle of a trade.
1448.48s: And we already talked about this.
1450.04s: Make sure you have a logical, positively expected P&L approach for each strategy.
1454.36s: I can't overemphasize that enough.
1455.64s: I see people pick random numbers and then they don't want to follow them because they don't
1458.96s: believe them or they're picking things that actually don't make sense for what they're
1462.44s: doing.
1463.44s: We already talked about these.
1464.44s: We don't have to hit these again.
1465.44s: The last part on this I want to hit though is the mental analysis dissonance.
1469.00s: Again, we have a really hard time objectively evaluating what's going on because our ego
1474.24s: doesn't want to be confronted.
1475.88s: We don't want to think that we're wasting a bunch of time and effort doing something
1479.00s: that's not doing what we want it to do.
1481.56s: You have to get all of that out of your mind and go back to the process.
1485.52s: Every single decision, every single piece of analysis you're making feeds back into the
1488.92s: process, which is what will help you be successful long term, short term pain for long term
1494.80s: gain.
1495.80s: The last thing you cannot become too risk desensitized or else you might end up like
1501.68s: one of these two guys.
1502.92s: Again, if you know who they are, comment below.
1505.56s: But on fact, both of them, hyper successful traders that have made a bunch of money and
1510.76s: then lost all of it.
1512.44s: This guy ended up killing himself.
1514.64s: I think he made, let me double check.
1516.52s: He made over $100 million.
1519.32s: This is back in the 1930s.
1522.20s: Think about how much money that is.
1525.44s: This gentleman over here lost $827 million for a bank.
1531.00s: The point being is you can't get too risk desensitized.
1533.56s: They're both successful, knocked it out of the park, some of them for a long time and
1537.12s: then they still fucked it up at some point because they develop a perverse relationship
1540.64s: with risk.
1541.64s: You're not out of the woods when you're a successful trader.
1544.24s: It takes time.
1545.24s: The last thing, if you're too risk averse, you put on positions too small, you take them
1548.80s: down too fast, you're not going to make any money.
1551.44s: So think about position sizing.
1553.08s: Typically for me, speculative allocation, maybe up to 25% fast majority of the time, 10
1558.52s: to 15%.
1559.88s: For allocation, very different can go the full portfolio, but typically much larger size
1564.68s: because of the way that I trade that.
1566.56s: Make it make sense.
1568.68s: Remember draw downs really hurt you long term.
1572.08s: Don't let it happen.
1573.08s: Take the short term loss sucks, but it lets you start from a better point going forward.
1578.72s: Establish all of this ahead of time.
1580.52s: If you have any questions, let me know.
1582.36s: Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
1583.36s: See you later.
