 Send a trade off and then figure out what you're going to do about it later, right? That sounds about right for most of us. And if you're anything like me, when I first started trading back in 2007, I was in high school and I was a super patient young man, obviously not the case. So the goal of this video is actually to walk you through risk management and options trading, specifically what I wish I knew 16 years ago. What's up everybody? Eric here. We'll come back to the outliers shout out to the Patreon. Let's get straight into it. So what's the purpose of this topic? It's kind of straightforward, but it's so that you don't end up like this person, which I can't really pronounce their name, but this is actually from the options subreddit. They lost 167,000 dollars. Then we got this person from Wall Street Betts, who's down 98.81%. This person who's essentially asking subreddit if they should wheel this thing with 550 bucks. We got this person who lost $650,000 on short calls. It looks like maybe long calls. Yeah, it looks like long calls. Who knows at this point? Then we have another one from Wall Street Betts where we are down actually a impressive 101% kind of good for them, really overachieving here. What I'm highlighting is this is what most people do. It is a fact of the trade that most people that get into trading start off have cocked. I did. And unfortunately for these people, they obviously had some gambling issues and sizing issues, which we'll talk about all of those throughout this video. But specifically at the end of the video, I want to outline five steps to manage risk better. That's it. So that I'm going to lay a foundation for you on why this stuff matters. Talk to you about some cognitive biases. Give you my risk hierarchy, how I view it. And then my approach to risk management and then also, you know, quick shout out, if you're going to post a screenshot, at least have some battery power, you heave in there less than 50%. That's just kind of unacceptable. Okay. So now that we know kind of the risk of trading options and what realistically happens to the majority of people, we need to. To find what our individual purposes beyond avoiding this fate, for me, it was to enable long term compounding. That's what I cared about. And I've shared my story a bunch of times. I'm not going to bore you with it in this video. What I want to draw your attention to are the different ways we can make money in the market. So you'll notice that as we go further down on our account draw downs, the larger the return required is in order to get back to break even. So in this case, if you draw down 40% in order to get back to break even, you have to see an appreciation of 66.7%. That's not making any money. That's getting just back to break even. So what I want to draw your attention to specifically are these different portfolios, because you notice that portfolio three actually has a better return, a better average return of 8.6%. But notice how the compound annual growth rate is 6.87% compared to portfolio one that has a lower average return of 1.2% at 7.4%. Yet, they have a better compound annual growth rate. How is that? Because they're not experiencing as much whipsaw in their return profile. So for me, this is what I focused on. And over the lifecycle of my trading, I've evolved what my purpose was. However, what always stuck with me is limiting the draw down on my account. And that's actually led to me only posting two negative years. And that was my first two years of trading. In the beginning, I was just really risk averse. However, what I started to realize as I was creating what I call my millionaire roadmap, what I was trying to accomplish, I noticed that even by having more conservative top line returns, by limiting my draw downs, I was actually accelerating my compound growth target and rate massively. So that's exactly why this was my purpose. You have to define yours. And I encourage you to do that. When you think about your approach to managing risk in trading, not just options, it can't just be, I don't want to blow up. If it's something so nebulous, it doesn't mean anything. I would quantify it very specifically. I do not want to have a greater than 30% draw down on my total portfolio. Whatever it is for you, that makes sense. But you have to go through this process. If you just say the easy answer of, oh, I'm just going to limit draw downs or I just want less portfolio variance. Yeah, it sounds good. But unless you start getting specific with it, it's, you're just saying things that sound good. That's it. It doesn't get us anywhere. So now let's set a foundation. There are two kinds of risk you have to be aware of. There's systemic and unsystemic risk. Systemic risk, the way to think about it is the meteor that's coming towards Earth. It impacts everything. There's not much you can do to shelter from it. It just kind of is a massive thing that touches a lot of stuff simultaneously. So in the stock market specifically, this is like the bubble that we saw in 2007, 2008 when the housing market collapsed and that impacted just about everything on the stock market. That kind of thing. Unsystemic risk is you, it's you the trader. It's what you inject into the system and what you do to yourself via things like irresponsible position sizing because we're greedy or having things that represent the same directional risk without really knowing it or having products that move the same or by placing a bunch of trades before Big Daddy J pal is coming out to drop to hammer on everybody's hopes that the fed rates are not getting cut anytime soon. These are risk sources that you the trader inject. So now what I want to talk to you a little bit about is the psychology of risk. The reason why this matters and I'll try to keep it quick because there's a lot to go through here. But this is the underpinning of what people do. And as I frequently tell you all, you shouldn't take my word for it. You should look things up and there are tons of studies on this. And if you're in the Patreon, you have access to all of these. I bundled them for you so it's convenient to download all in one spot on the Patreon shop. You can just grab all of these at once. But I'm going to tap into a handful of these psychological risk factors that I would deem to be the largest contributors to people struggling in trading. The first one is good times analysis. What I mean by this is we have a habit where we think about the ideal scenario. So if you're putting on a trade, most traders are thinking about the profit that they're going to take as compared to what it could look like if it doesn't go our way. Big problem. The other thing is when we're looking at our performance, there tends to be a dissonance between what we think we did and how well that performed compared to what actually happened and how it actually performed. That's really why it's really important to keep a trade log and even a trade journal if you're still in decline. I don't really have one. I integrate some of that into my log so that I can keep myself honest because it's so easy to have false recollections because we're trying to cope. If we don't really appreciate how massive the ego is in this process, I can't overemphasize it because when you think about our role as a trader, it's just you versus you. There's nobody else to look at what you're doing or analyze if what you're doing makes sense or not. And a lot of us over time, especially as you start to get good at trading, you run into a few problems. One of them is the good old Dunning Kruger effect, which is actually massively driven by ego. When we start something and we know that we don't know anything so our confidence is low, but our competence is also low because we're just starting something. Then you spend two to three years really trying super hard, you're studying for dozens of hours a week, you're putting in the time and effort and now you feel like you've earned your way to knowledge. Unfortunately, this tends to be where we have the largest issue. This is where we think we're smarter than the market. This is where we become so obsessed with our own ideas and how good our research is that we kind of forget to remind ourselves that the market doesn't care about our ideas. The market's going to do whatever the market's going to do. Don't give a fuck. So what this means is you start to outsmart the market. You're putting on positions that they can't lose, you're sizing up, whatever the case is. And then you finally realize risk. Risk is always realized sooner or later. One of those dangerous things that happens from an ego perspective is if you start trading and you actually win a bunch up front because then you think you're better than you are. And again, sooner or later, the market will humble you. And if you think about the perspective of a trader, we're trying to not trade for a year, five year, 10 years, 20 years. We're trying to trade for a lifetime. We're trying to create life changing wealth and to sustainably do it over time. So thinking about things like our ego, the Dunning Crewger effect, they're massive. A couple of the things I want to highlight from this list and then you're free to check out whatever you want up front is the disposition effect. And that's actually from the behavior of individual investors, this study here. This is the tendency where we like to take winning trades down too fast and let losing trades run. This happens for two reasons. One, from a psychological perspective, we like realizing again, we feel good. Our ego likes that. We're confronted with the outcome that we did a good job. We don't like confronting ourselves with the fact that we did something that didn't work well. And then this is where we start hoping that it works out, typically doesn't. The other thing to know about the disposition effect and how it roots in our brains is kind of primal actually. And it's called loss of version. And this kind of has primal rooting where we don't look at the value of a gain or a commensurate loss the same. And this happens because once your basic life needs are met, the prospect of losing a little bit is problematic because then it can set you below what you need for basic needs. But this also carries over into other markets where you can actually have a better expected return to the outside to the upside versus losing to the downside. So what that means is, say, for example, if it's a fair coin flip and you can win one and a half units if it's heads and you lose one unit or one and a quarter units if it's tails, people don't wait those outcomes appropriately, whereas that has positive expected return, but people become too risk averse. And if you offered them the ability to just take a dollar up front, even though that system would potentially make them more, they wouldn't take that trade. So that's loss of version. Now a couple other things, effort gap is a big one with respect to trading. And this is where traders feel like because they put in a ton of effort that they deserve something, that the market owes them to be right, that the, you know, because they've spent hundreds of hours, they should be performing well because of all that effort. It doesn't matter. Literally doesn't matter. You can spend a lot of time doing this stuff and it still might not be the right fit for you. It is what it is. The other thing I want to highlight here specifically is the skill gap. This is where you look at people that are doing things really well and you don't fully understand how much is going into making that happen. I typically use the example of surfing or Jujitsu. People who are good at both of those make it look effortless, but there's a ton of time and effort that goes into being successful at either of those. It's the same thing in trading. And then the last one, traders get way too wrapped up in individual positions as compared to this system that they're attempting to interface with. So what this means is sometimes you put on an individual trade and you are just so focused on how that one trade does. So you're breaking your rules, you're making exceptions because you think you can make this one trade work, but you forget that this is a really long term iterative process and you're building a bunch of bad habits. So before we move on now to the risk hierarchy in the comments below, let me know what you would add to this list because there's way more than just this. And that's kind of a scary prospect, but it is the truth. There's way more that goes into the psychology of risk for traders. Okay. This is how I think about risk in the markets. It starts from a broad perspective and then we zoom in further and further and further. So we start with the market, then we look at our portfolio risk, then we look at individual strategy risk and then position. So this actually gets pretty straightforward and I'm going to give you a handful of questions or considerations for each of these to then integrate into your thought process with respect to risk in trading. So the first one, when we think about the market, I typically take up broad view. So I'm going to conduct a broad market analysis, look at things like net highs and lows, moving averages, just to get a sense of how the market is trending. I'm also going to see how earnings for the last quarter have been. See if there's any big economic events coming out or that the market is particularly sensitive to a good example of that right now is the rate environment markets, hyper sensitive to that as of this moment, whereas back in 2013, yeah, not so much because it wasn't so topical then and also how volatile things are. The reason why I look at all of this before I even start thinking about the risk of positions is because this informs how I structure my risk later on. So for example, if I'm trading earnings plays and the earnings so far has been all over the place that's going to inform what strategies I might use and how I'm going to set those strategies up. So this is laying a foundation for further decision. Then we look at the portfolio. So from a portfolio level, when I'm first deciding how I conceive of risk, I think about max drawdown for the portfolio that's super important. And this is where you determine what is the maximum allowable capital drawdown you will accept in your portfolio before you deploy circuit breakers. And circuit breakers are literally when you start liquidating positions, even if it might not make sense to make sure that you're not missing something that there's not some sort of fundamental shift that happened that you might not be aware of whatever the case is so that you do not start bleeding capital way more than you should because even if something goes down, let's say 30% you exit and then it starts to rebound that might work in that one scenario, but there can be another scenario where it goes down to 30% drawdown and then you say, Oh, I've been here before it's fine. And then it goes down to 60% drawdown. And again, this has to be personalized to you as a trader. Some traders really like to focus their risk into small buckets and accept much higher portfolio variance. So maybe your max drawdown on your portfolio is a bigger metric because you expect much bigger winners when they come, but it has to make sense for you. For me, I break out my portfolio into core and speculative allocations. I'll throw a video in the notes below that walks through how I do that and how I allocate capital to both of them, but that's a massive part of how I manage risk in the portfolio writ large. I'm also going to use things like beta weighted delta to see how my portfolio looks at a given point in time. Again, I have a video on that. I'll throw in the notes below. And the whole point behind this is to make sure that I'm understanding the disposition of all of my positions in one common language. Now, going back to capital in the portfolio, one of the things I think people forego thinking about is margin expansion. So when you put on an options trade and let's say you're putting on a hypothetical short position in hood because you hate hood as much as I do and no matter how good it's doing or how good it looks to the upside. None of that matters. We should still always fade hood because well, we hate hood and you sell a call. When you first put that position on, your brokerage doesn't require a certain amount of money and that margin requirement in this case is something like a thousand bucks. However, if the underlying starts moving against you and let's say it goes up one standard deviation, your margin requirement is now $1,700 and let's say it goes up to standard deviations now it's $2,600 and if it goes up three standard deviations, now it's up $3,900 margin moves. So if you're trading using options, that's great. You're gaining effective leverage and being more capital efficient. However, you have to be mindful of how margin will move throughout the life cycle of a position. Again, you can't have goal deluxe scenario analysis where you're just thinking about things when they go well. So for me, I would absolutely consider something like a three standard deviation move against me to understand what it might look like. It's insanely improbable, but they do happen. And that's the way that my brain thinks about managing risks so that I don't get caught. The other things I'm going to look at in the portfolio are the correlation between products to make sure that I'm not putting on five different positions that really all behave like the same one without knowing it. I'm also going to take a look at what days to expiration. I have for all my different positions. What needs to be managed because of time-based reasons? Am I at risk of early assignment? Do I have positions that I want to roll because they're being challenged? All of those things get baked into this broad portfolio overview. And then I'm also going to make sure that there's no specific event risk coming up that impacts my positions. So if you happen to have a position on in technology and Nvidia has earnings coming out, especially with the market as it is today, that's a consideration to have that you should be aware of. So the portfolio, I'm literally just looking at these broad buckets. There's quite a bit more that I personally would look at, but I think this is a fine place to start. Now, let's get into the individual strategies here. This is when we need to determine what risk management protocols make sense for the strategy that we're using. So in this case, we can't just take a guess. There's no way that you could just say, I'm going to do blank and it make any sense or it be something that you would follow because you don't trust it. Why would you? So for me, this is where I go through the process of back testing, forward testing, cutting the tails, and then developing strategy specific risk management rules. I have a video down below that goes into this idea of cutting the tails and I have another video that goes through how to build a strategy. The Clif notes version of this is that we really need to make sure that we're keeping expected return in mind. So for example, if I'm trading a strategy and I have the possibility to make two units and I'm risking four units to make those two units, depending on the probabilistic outcome of those scenarios, it may or may not make sense. What's important here is to figure out what that looks like for your individual strategy to then make decisions. So again, for example, for me, if I'm trading things that are more speculative in nature, I typically will give them less room to move, expecting to be wrong more often. So I'll have a lower average loss amount, but a higher loss frequency. It's a way for me to manage trades. And then I layer in scaling on top of that. So for example, if I'm entering a breakout trade that I want to go to the upside and I pretty speculative in nature, I will find a stop that makes sense for the strategy, because if I'm trading a breakout kind of trade, it doesn't make sense to use profit or loss management. That's predicated on random numbers. If I lose two times the credit I received, then this is no longer good for me. If it's a trend following strategy, it doesn't make sense because I'm trading the chart. I'm trading the price action. So what I'm going to do in those kinds of scenarios is look to create a reference. So if I sold that call in Robinhood, which as much as it pains me to say right now, I probably wouldn't do because it's showing some strength and you have to go all the way out to three years to find the near term resistance. But it's still here. It's somewhere around this handle we can see that there's a big stair step down. And this is where I would look to say, OK, if I deem near term resistance for this short call or whatever strategy it is, in this case, going short hood because I hate it. And then we zoom in and we say, OK, so if I want to fade this to the downside for whatever reason, this is where I'm prospecting short term resistance would be. If we break above that, what would the loss on my position be? Am I OK with that loss as a dollar amount or percentage of my portfolio? And does this all line up? You have to make sure that whatever you're choosing to set for your strategy specific risk management protocols makes sense for the specific strategy in that specific opportunity. But then you have to zoom out and make sure that it fits into your portfolio. So let's say, for example, instead of the risk management occurring somewhere on 2145, let's say that I go out again, there's three years and let's say that I for whatever reason think this is where the stop would occur for me. If this makes sense for me to get stopped out all the way up at 2841. And if I still really like the trade, but the loss looks like it might be too big, then maybe I scale the size of the trade down. If I look at that loss and I say, yeah, based on how much money I think I could make, which in this case, it would be the credit received on the long option. But if I think this is where it might trend to before it stops me out, then in the scenario, I'm in possibly looking to make a hundred bucks, but risking several thousand. It starts to not make sense. So the opportunity that you're trading has to fit whatever you've tested for your strategy, which can't be random. And one other note here is that you can go broke taking profits, go back to the disposition effect. And then to this cycle where you look to manage your risk too fast, taking all your winners down at tiny little winner amounts, you'd have a really high win rate. But then whenever you eventually have a really big loss, it's going to wipe out all of your winners. And then you're still negatively expecting. So you have to make sure it makes sense. And the way we do this is by testing back test, forward test, the tails off, then make sure that you can fit it to the individual opportunity. Well, last bit. You know who these two people are, comment in the notes below. These are two great references. And I'll get into that in just a second. But here are the five steps to better risk management. The first one is predetermined your profit and loss management protocols for every single trade before you enter. That's it. That's one of the easiest things you can do before you press the button to enter a trade define how you're going to manage it to the upside to the downside and make sure that it makes sense for the strategy and the position, meaning it has positive expected return. Again, we need to make sure that we're tracking our P and L for the portfolio and trade levels, which are broker will do that for you. But as it goes to different extremes for your max drawdown, you have to track that because we should get to a point where based on what you're attempting to return, you can establish circuit breakers. So again, for me, my portfolio draws down more than 25%. That's a circuit breaker. It means I'm cutting trades to figure out what's going on and to reduce the drawdown further. And again, I accept the fact that if it gets 25%, it might just rebound right back up. That's okay because I'm a process oriented trader. I know maybe that one instance, that's what happened. Another instance, it might be another 2007, 2008 where the market goes on to drop another 30% over two weeks. I'm not going to let that happen. So you have to figure out what makes sense for you here. But the important part is to think about this stuff before it's happening because that's when you're logical and thinking clearly, it's not going to happen when you're in the middle of a trade. And we already talked about this. Make sure you have a logical, positively expected P&L approach for each strategy. I can't overemphasize that enough. I see people pick random numbers and then they don't want to follow them because they don't believe them or they're picking things that actually don't make sense for what they're doing. We already talked about these. We don't have to hit these again. The last part on this I want to hit though is the mental analysis dissonance. Again, we have a really hard time objectively evaluating what's going on because our ego doesn't want to be confronted. We don't want to think that we're wasting a bunch of time and effort doing something that's not doing what we want it to do. You have to get all of that out of your mind and go back to the process. Every single decision, every single piece of analysis you're making feeds back into the process, which is what will help you be successful long term, short term pain for long term gain. The last thing you cannot become too risk desensitized or else you might end up like one of these two guys. Again, if you know who they are, comment below. But on fact, both of them, hyper successful traders that have made a bunch of money and then lost all of it. This guy ended up killing himself. I think he made, let me double check. He made over $100 million. This is back in the 1930s. Think about how much money that is. This gentleman over here lost $827 million for a bank. The point being is you can't get too risk desensitized. They're both successful, knocked it out of the park, some of them for a long time and then they still fucked it up at some point because they develop a perverse relationship with risk. You're not out of the woods when you're a successful trader. It takes time. The last thing, if you're too risk averse, you put on positions too small, you take them down too fast, you're not going to make any money. So think about position sizing. Typically for me, speculative allocation, maybe up to 25% fast majority of the time, 10 to 15%. For allocation, very different can go the full portfolio, but typically much larger size because of the way that I trade that. Make it make sense. Remember draw downs really hurt you long term. Don't let it happen. Take the short term loss sucks, but it lets you start from a better point going forward. Establish all of this ahead of time. If you have any questions, let me know.
