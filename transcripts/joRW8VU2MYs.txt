300.00s: you
330.00s: you
360.00s: you
390.00s: you
420.00s: all the way through this one yet,
421.20s: but I thought we could take a look through it together.
423.40s: It's about GameStop naked shorting.
425.40s: I'll show you the context of it.
427.84s: This is it.
428.68s: I started going through it.
431.72s: There is a bunch of different versions
433.52s: of this kind of research,
434.60s: but I thought it would be kind of cool
435.96s: to go through this together as well.
438.28s: So that's the agenda for today.
440.88s: I figure I'll get us kicked off.
442.56s: We'll start as per usual
444.48s: with just looking through GameStop
446.72s: kind of analyzing where things sit today.
449.08s: I actually had a really funny comment
451.64s: on one of my videos.
454.64s: Somebody effectively said they were like,
456.72s: yo, Eric, you must have some crazy OCD
460.16s: if you're still covering GameStop,
462.80s: which I thought was kind of funny
463.92s: because I think people are very temperamental,
470.64s: meaning if something's like interesting,
473.00s: they go all in and they focus on it super heavily.
475.88s: And then if things lose their interest,
478.92s: they pivot very quickly.
480.40s: Whereas it's exact opposite for me.
483.52s: Typically, once I start doing something
485.60s: unless there's some sort of significant reason
488.24s: why I would change,
489.80s: I typically just kind of keep on the path
492.96s: and it's why you see kind of the consistency I have, right?
497.44s: The only time that you've seen me miss any of these live streams
500.16s: is either the one time I was sick
502.56s: or if I'm traveling and even when I'm traveling,
504.52s: I still fit these in.
506.44s: And it's just kind of how I'm hardwired.
508.52s: The reason why I'm mentioning this point
510.16s: is because when you're analyzing something like markets,
514.40s: you have to be really consistent
516.20s: in what you're looking at, how you're studying it
518.88s: because there's so much information
522.20s: that you have to pick up that it's literally impossible
525.16s: to do it kind of like if you're in this ebb and flow cycle.
528.24s: So all that aside, let's get into it.
532.36s: Looks like we got Fuzzy here hanging out
534.72s: and we also got Dark Mark.
537.44s: Great to see both of you.
539.16s: And I assume we'll get other people popping in as we go
542.36s: and then the first starting point here is,
547.84s: I would love to hear from you in the chat specifically
551.72s: just to get a qualitative sense of where you think
558.32s: GameStop is.
560.52s: So what I mean by that and the answer context
564.48s: that I'm looking for is,
567.28s: do you think GameStop is in the middle of a business level pivot
574.64s: or do you think GameStop is in the process
579.08s: of optimizing its current business?
583.44s: And it's not really, you know, binary,
586.32s: it has to be one or the other.
588.12s: But if you were to think about what the dominant force
591.44s: right now for GameStop more broadly is,
594.84s: meaning the priorities for leadership,
596.92s: do you think it's optimizing the existing business
599.52s: or do you think it's researching, planning
602.16s: and preparing to pivot into something else?
608.12s: What say you?
609.84s: Be Dizzle also great to see you.
612.68s: And I realize that this window's a little off skew.
616.88s: That's okay.
617.88s: That'd be all right.
619.40s: Let's click over here.
621.80s: And while you're letting me know your thoughts,
625.72s: the reason why I'm asking this is because of how GameStop
628.80s: is trading and I'm gonna give you my opinion in a moment.
631.60s: But I am genuinely curious.
634.72s: Marcelo says both.
636.96s: Be Dizzle says I'm hoping for a pivot,
639.12s: but I can't help but feel it might still be a ways out
642.48s: in Ryan's focusing on the overall business.
645.68s: Jesse Juice says I think it's a blend.
648.80s: I do think there's a larger pivot behind the scenes
651.00s: to collectibles.
652.56s: I don't think Ryan Cohen's desire to challenge Amazon
656.52s: has gone away.
657.36s: That's a really interesting point.
659.28s: Dylan says been a while,
661.40s: but have a few minutes to hear how the story is going.
664.56s: Good to see you, Dylan.
666.36s: What is Dylan?
667.36s: You're a great example.
668.72s: Dylan, what has led to you kind of stepping away
672.84s: from the GameStop sphere?
674.80s: I'm actually very, very curious.
676.12s: Is it, you know, just got busy, deprioritized,
678.96s: things were moving slow.
680.44s: You're the exact person.
682.20s: I'm very curious in right now because I think
685.40s: that what you're talking about and what you're saying
687.96s: is actually broadly representative of what I imagine
692.72s: a lot of people are feeling right now.
695.84s: Jesse says but the business optimization steps
697.84s: are crucial steps to make that transformation work.
699.92s: Is that the case though?
701.68s: Because there are a lot of people that think GameStop
706.40s: should take like this really hard pivot.
709.08s: One of the examples I see is GameStop
711.28s: effectively becoming like a holding company.
713.84s: Again, I personally don't see that route,
716.24s: but like let's just take it what it is,
718.52s: whether we agree with it or not.
720.44s: And if GameStop were to go that route,
724.20s: something like trying to become a holding company,
727.44s: I think that we would actually see a very different response
731.20s: rate than what we see right now.
732.88s: It's actually one of the dominant reasons why I don't think
736.60s: GameStop is going the route of becoming a holding company.
740.28s: Because if GameStop's plan was to become a holding company,
744.48s: going through this long, arduous process of trying
750.12s: to reconfigure the business is a massive opportunity cost.
755.52s: And it's trying to salvage something
758.32s: that I think more broadly speaking,
760.28s: we know is a very challenged field,
764.52s: meaning brick and mortar stores in general,
768.28s: but let alone brick and mortar stores
770.24s: related to video games, devices and peripherals.
774.52s: So from that lens,
776.32s: I actually think we can use that information
779.60s: to come up with a decent understanding of why GameStop
783.92s: is making the moves that it is.
785.16s: And I think the fact that GameStop is going through
787.76s: and from the video I released on Wednesday,
790.68s: you'll see that there's a bunch more store closings
793.32s: and store closings and stuff like that.
795.76s: I feel like if GameStop was going the route
797.84s: of being a holding company,
798.88s: you'd actually see that accelerate massively.
801.04s: It wouldn't be like the slow thing
803.00s: that's kind of pocketed here and there,
804.96s: trying to offload elements of the business in Canada,
807.60s: because it represents 5% of sales.
810.04s: It's stuff that's way, way, way broader scoped in that
813.40s: if they were going to make that big of a pivot.
816.28s: Dylan says I saw GameStop is a brick business.
819.52s: And although I like the cash, I think no debt,
822.92s: I just saw the rest of the market making moves.
825.56s: And with all respect,
826.68s: how to get out of GameStop sandbox?
830.36s: I think it's smart.
831.36s: And I think that's one of the cool things,
833.68s: at least I hope, about the way that I talk about GameStop
838.00s: and the way that I explore the space with everybody,
840.76s: because I really apply the lens of a trader.
846.00s: Like that's what I am, is I trade for living.
850.44s: It's how I make money.
852.32s: So my lens towards GameStop is actually very similar
856.00s: to you, Dylan, in the fact that in terms of what I do
859.36s: with the portfolio, it's broadly mixed.
862.48s: And it's never been even remotely
865.72s: where GameStop is a dominant position for me.
867.92s: And it's not because of any sort of feeling
870.44s: towards GameStop, it's just because of the way
872.44s: that I trade, primarily with options.
874.12s: Now, the GameStop covered strangle that I run.
877.40s: I'm actually using that way more
880.56s: as hopefully a learning point for you all,
883.36s: to show you how you can apply something
886.72s: like a covered strangle, basic option strategies
890.36s: in something like GameStop
892.44s: for a lot of people who maintain GameStop holdings.
895.52s: Because that is the reality.
896.44s: The vast majority of people I feel that tune
899.56s: into the live streams are likely people
903.12s: that are primarily GameStop holders versus traders.
907.08s: Like more so, what I represent.
910.08s: So yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
912.36s: Justi says, you make good points.
913.68s: I wish the CEO was more forthcoming.
915.76s: It's been a little exhausting, not gonna lie.
917.72s: I actually fully understand that.
921.08s: His approach has been eye opening to me,
925.24s: to be completely honest in a lot of different ways.
928.08s: The reason why I say that is because
930.92s: part of me thinks what he's doing is
934.64s: very strategic in nature.
936.28s: So I respect it from that lens.
939.20s: However, the other part of me does believe
943.64s: in order to inspire confidence from people,
947.84s: you have to key them in a bit.
951.72s: And this is why normally when you see other companies
954.28s: going through their earnings releases,
956.12s: there are these giant earnings presentations,
958.40s: there's forecasts, there's expectations
961.72s: for the next quarter, literally for the entire next year.
965.28s: There's some analysis shared on the context of
968.92s: what's the current market landscape,
971.28s: the economic landscape as it pertains to the business.
974.32s: And GameStop, you really don't see any of that.
977.16s: Now, I think part of it is wise
980.36s: to keep the cards semi close to the chest,
983.08s: but I also don't fully buy that.
986.96s: And it's because there's nothing like super secret
989.80s: that GameStop's working on,
991.24s: that all of these other companies aren't working on
993.92s: tangentially or similarly related endeavors
997.36s: that are still able to talk about some of these things.
1000.32s: So that part, I actually don't understand
1003.20s: why they manage it that way.
1005.76s: Actually, I'm really curious.
1007.40s: Let me see if I want to know if ChatGPT
1011.08s: has a perspective of some sort on this,
1014.48s: because let me tell you what the question is,
1018.60s: we're gonna ask.
1020.92s: Okay.
1022.60s: So we want to ask,
1025.40s: why does Ryan Cohen and GameStop
1032.40s: refer to minimize shareholder communications
1040.72s: during things like earnings releases
1047.68s: where other companies share analysis,
1056.16s: future expectations, broad plans, et cetera.
1063.72s: I want to know what ChatGPT says
1065.48s: might have an angle that we're not considering.
1071.72s: Ryan Cohen and GameStop have adapted,
1074.20s: adopted a low communication strategy,
1076.32s: particularly in earnings calls.
1078.44s: The reasoning behind this approach
1079.68s: appears to be deliberate and aligns
1081.36s: with Cohen's broader philosophy.
1084.08s: Strategic reasons for limited communication.
1086.24s: Avoid over promising and legal risks,
1088.68s: letting execution speak instead of words,
1093.28s: hedge against market manipulation,
1095.72s: which that I do believe,
1097.36s: differentiation from Wall Street norms.
1099.20s: This is the main thing I actually think of.
1103.16s: Is the fact that Cohen is really known
1105.64s: for taking a slightly offbeat approach
1109.04s: to markets, to being a business owner, to being a CEO,
1113.68s: and that's actually what I would consider
1117.24s: to be a larger function,
1118.64s: is like he's just doing shit different.
1121.40s: Like that's part of what I think he does.
1125.08s: As he says, I'm hoping this Q4 is different
1126.96s: than in that regard.
1128.68s: Seems like there's gonna be some sort of reveal
1130.64s: of an investment in more info
1132.60s: on the new PSA trading cards.
1136.52s: I used to feel the same as you there,
1140.44s: but I have to be honest, I don't feel that way personally.
1144.16s: I would not be surprised at all
1146.88s: if during this earnings release, there's not a call,
1149.88s: and it's just the filing of the forms.
1156.08s: That wouldn't surprise me in the least.
1158.84s: And the reason being is because,
1162.44s: if there's some sort of news with respect to an investment,
1169.44s: more often than not, we'll see artifacts of it.
1173.04s: Now, that doesn't mean it couldn't be the case,
1177.56s: definitely could, but typically speaking,
1181.44s: when there's some sort of larger scale investment potential,
1186.44s: normally you see it start to bleed out little areas
1190.76s: where information finds its way out
1192.60s: and gets baked into things like the options markets.
1195.60s: You typically can see small artifacts of it.
1198.60s: And sometimes you don't know what the artifact is
1200.76s: as you're looking at it happening,
1202.20s: meaning it could be the specific open interest
1204.60s: or volume build out of a specific option that's anomalous.
1208.36s: So we don't always know exactly why,
1211.20s: but we definitely can typically see something,
1214.80s: at least that then would confirm the information
1218.40s: in the future.
1219.76s: Yeah, it would be really interesting.
1222.16s: Jesse says, shout out to you, Eric,
1224.12s: by the way, you turn me on a chat GPT
1225.84s: to help in trading and it's been great.
1227.08s: Yeah, it's, I actually am,
1228.96s: I got a bunch of emails from the last newsletter
1231.60s: I sent out last week that talked a little bit
1233.44s: about using chat GPT or just AI to help.
1237.32s: And one of my goals for a future video, hopefully soon,
1243.56s: is to talk about how to use AI to help
1248.16s: with your just overall trading approach.
1251.12s: Because I feel like I cannot tell you how much I wish
1256.20s: I had AI and even large language models
1259.80s: when I was learning to trade.
1261.44s: And the fact that people now have that available to them
1265.84s: is such an unbelievable resource,
1271.36s: like literally unbelievable resource,
1274.44s: that unfortunately a lot of newer people
1277.36s: don't know like how to take advantage of it.
1279.60s: But that's exactly why I want to make a video on it
1282.00s: at some point.
1282.84s: I think it'll be useful.
1284.88s: Yeah.
1286.28s: Alberto says, wait, there's a newsletter?
1288.84s: Yeah, Doug, if you look at any of the video descriptions
1292.40s: for any of my videos, there's a link to it.
1295.40s: But it comes out every Sunday,
1297.64s: I've done the newsletter for like three years now.
1300.92s: It's completely open to everybody.
1304.68s: Bozzie says, I feel like Grock has taken the lead over chat
1307.00s: GPT. I only use GPT.
1308.84s: I don't think so.
1310.08s: I think that they're all so similar right now
1313.08s: that there isn't really a large differentiator.
1315.32s: I pay for a few of them because I like to be able
1318.60s: to test different ideas and see how they behave differently.
1324.88s: I think it also depends on the tasks that you're trying to do.
1328.36s: That's a big differentiator.
1330.28s: But like for example, recently,
1332.24s: both perplexity and chat GPT have launched like deeper research
1336.80s: and chat GPT just launched 4.5,
1339.68s: which is like good for reasoning and deeper thoughts.
1343.60s: So I think that they're all very useful in different ways.
1349.04s: But I think that broadly, they're all super similar right now.
1352.92s: Like I really don't see,
1355.00s: I don't see huge differences between them.
1356.92s: Like for example, if I'm generally searching things,
1359.48s: I have a preference for perplexity
1362.08s: because I think it does a better job
1363.52s: more quickly going through different sources and citing them.
1368.04s: But chat GPT is now become equally as effective as that
1371.84s: versus just making shit up like it did in the beginning.
1374.12s: So yeah.
1376.84s: Dylan says if it was something,
1378.44s: if it was someone else doing this live video now,
1381.20s: same content, same words I wouldn't watch.
1382.96s: Your delivery is humble.
1384.36s: And I think you're an incredible watch.
1385.80s: Thank you for your time.
1386.60s: I'm really glad to hear that.
1388.48s: It makes me sad that the same words essentially
1391.28s: wouldn't carry weight because then it means
1393.16s: that the words don't mean much.
1395.08s: But I appreciate the sentiment very much.
1398.76s: I think what I try to do with stuff like this specifically as well
1403.56s: is I try to make sure that traders are able to identify
1406.88s: like the opportunity that you have in front of you.
1409.88s: And that comes with experience, right?
1413.88s: So it's where we can kind of blend both of our worlds
1418.52s: or hopefully I can lend some of my 18 years of trading experience
1425.08s: to help you, meaning the you identify different ways
1430.68s: to do things, different ways of thinking
1432.48s: and different paths you can take in order
1435.44s: to create success in markets because markets are challenging.
1443.16s: They are entirely manageable.
1446.68s: It's that the overwhelming majority of people
1450.00s: start from the entirely wrong approach, unfortunately.
1453.48s: And that's just kind of how it is.
1455.60s: Like if again, as I always say, like if you just go on YouTube,
1458.40s: lemme grab and I always use an incognito window for this
1461.76s: because I don't like any of my search history
1464.20s: or anything to skew the results.
1466.08s: But if I just like type in the word trading,
1468.92s: it's typically absolutely, absolutely trash like this.
1474.92s: If I just type in the word trading, the first sponsored link,
1479.04s: and I don't know this person from a hole in the wall,
1481.88s: but apparently they're talking about making $2,000 per day
1486.36s: with an AI bot, right?
1489.20s: Like the people that would believe this and click this
1494.80s: are the exact people that don't have the money
1497.56s: to waste on this bullshit.
1499.52s: And that bothers me.
1501.48s: But this is really the reality of what most people
1506.28s: walk into, which kind of sucks.
1508.72s: And chat GPT and AI can help with all of this.
1515.00s: Day trading for beginners, the complete beginners course,
1518.16s: and then we have a portfolio that is up $735,000.
1525.64s: Yep.
1527.84s: I'm sure dog, I'm so sure.
1531.76s: Now, let's get into GameStop.
1535.64s: What we're all here for this last week,
1538.92s: I thought was interesting in the sense
1542.12s: that we've defined a channel.
1544.28s: And I'm actually really unpleased to see this consolidation
1550.88s: and starting to break us out of this broader channel
1555.24s: because this broader channel has been kind of brutal.
1558.60s: This steep drop consolidation, steep drop,
1562.00s: small rebound consolidation,
1564.68s: not a comparatively super steep drop,
1567.24s: but still a big drop, right?
1568.44s: From 27 down to 24.
1571.64s: That's a big move, right?
1573.52s: For doesn't look big on the chart,
1575.76s: but that's simply because of the scale of the moves
1578.80s: that GameStop has.
1580.76s: Now it's been trending sideways.
1583.68s: Unfortunately, I don't love this slight negative drift.
1588.52s: And it's a little hard to see, but it's there.
1591.04s: So if we zoom in a little bit more
1593.08s: and we take a look just at the bottoms of these candles,
1596.60s: there's a slight drift down across.
1601.32s: So that means that there's still an element
1605.16s: of a little bit more weakness,
1608.00s: but it does look like the market overall,
1612.56s: at least has a degree of consensus
1614.64s: on near-term price and value of GameStop.
1617.40s: So if I'm not mistaken, I think the intrinsic value
1619.60s: just cash assets for GameStop writ large
1622.64s: is like 12 or 13 bucks or something like that.
1625.32s: So it's not like it's trading
1626.72s: at any sort of meaningful premium over its intrinsic value.
1634.88s: I think we have to keep a really close eye on this, though.
1640.92s: And that's because one,
1644.68s: if you've watched my other streams,
1647.08s: you know that I'm pretty quick to talk about the difference,
1650.56s: at least in my perception,
1653.08s: of market manipulation versus general market activity.
1658.36s: And I do not subscribe to the broad view of everything is fake,
1663.60s: nothing is real, the game's completely rigged against you.
1667.32s: I just don't believe that.
1669.16s: I do believe that there are absolutely the monster bull
1673.40s: instances of manipulation.
1675.56s: We can see it in a lot of different ways,
1677.68s: especially when we're looking at something like GameStop.
1680.68s: The fact that we closed at 24,
1686.04s: at 24 even on Friday.
1690.48s: I am not in the camp where everybody says,
1694.20s: at each and every week,
1696.08s: oh wow, you know, GameStop closed at blank
1699.84s: right below this next price level.
1702.80s: Obviously it's the market makers suppressing the price, right?
1705.92s: Because like no matter what week we're in,
1709.00s: GameStop's always going to close below some sort of level,
1711.56s: just like any other stock.
1713.60s: So I think it starts to become disingenuous when we always say that.
1719.44s: This Friday, though, real fucking interesting, real interesting.
1725.04s: That's a very inside day on a gap down on a broader period
1731.00s: where the average daily range is significant.
1737.04s: And right on the nose, open and close.
1747.72s: I don't think so.
1749.08s: I just don't fucking think so.
1750.96s: I absolutely would postulate that that's probably
1754.64s: a pretty clean example of market makers trying to make a few extra bucks.
1761.56s: That's exactly what I think that is.
1763.56s: Now I can't prove it.
1765.16s: And I will always highlight those things to you,
1768.40s: the difference between my opinion,
1770.32s: which I really do try to keep a minimum for you.
1773.12s: And it goes back to the general content creation space.
1776.72s: I think most content creators are overly eager to share their opinions.
1780.28s: And I honestly prefer to just try to share information
1783.84s: and allow you to arrive at your own opinion, right?
1787.96s: Fuck my opinion, who cares about my opinion.
1790.84s: But you should be able to look at information
1793.56s: and objectively arrive at what you think is happening based on the information
1800.56s: because thankfully,
1803.36s: whether you believe in God, the flying spaghetti monster
1806.48s: or the South Park comical version of just monkeys having butt sex
1813.00s: with one another that eventually led to human beings, you have a brain.
1817.12s: That allows you to synthesize information and come to conclusions.
1820.96s: So let's take a look and let's get that brain work in, shall we?
1826.20s: If we take a look at GameStop, by the way,
1830.52s: shout out to that tie in with GameStop, Mr. Garrison.
1835.96s: I don't know if you remember the scene I'm talking about where he's really upset
1839.64s: about having to teach evolution.
1842.60s: I don't know if they're going to cut the stream off for watching this,
1846.32s: but it's worth it.
1848.08s: Now that I'm citing it, what do I type in Mr. Garrison?
1856.28s: Funny enough, as soon as I type in Mr. Garrison,
1858.24s: the first thing that pops up is evolution.
1864.20s: All right.
1867.08s: Let me turn on the sound for you.
1868.24s: This will probably get me completely demonetized for everything,
1872.04s: but I don't make any money off this anyways.
1874.84s: All right, kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
1879.48s: Oh boy.
1880.88s: Now I for one think that evolution is a bunch of bull crap,
1885.48s: but I've been told I have to teach it anyway.
1888.32s: Love a good teacher that really is there for the material and the kids.
1894.64s: It was thought of by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this.
1898.48s: In the beginning, we were all fish, OK, swimming around in the water.
1903.08s: And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby.
1906.60s: And the retard baby was different.
1908.40s: So he got to live.
1909.68s: So retard fish goes on to make more retard babies.
1913.40s: And then one day a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands.
1919.68s: And it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.
1924.84s: And so on and so forth.
1927.32s: I love this clip so much.
1930.12s: So you might not be as tickled with that inclusion, but I'm very pleased with it personally.
1937.52s: OK, now we can take a look at games.
1943.00s: I love that episode so much.
1946.60s: Let's see if it has historic
1950.16s: gags.
1952.16s: And I think it might, I don't know if this one has Max Payne.
1955.32s: I think this one has Max Payne.
1964.80s: I think there's literally a website that does
1967.00s: paint for game stuff.
1967.76s: There's got to that.
1973.36s: This one.
1974.20s: I don't know if this does like historic Max Payne.
1987.80s: I do know bar chart does it.
1991.12s: Let's see what Max.
1993.80s: So for those unfamiliar with the concept of Max Payne, the idea is market makers.
1999.88s: I have a video on it.
2000.84s: I'll throw it in the chat for you guys.
2004.76s: But the concept behind Max Payne is that
2011.16s: the market makers are incentivized to try and cause an expiration
2018.76s: that yields Max Payne.
2021.08s: And Max Payne is where the largest number of options would expire worthless,
2024.84s: which is easier for them on the market, making side of things to manage.
2029.24s: Now again, Max Payne is not the woe of every down move that you see in the market.
2035.64s: And then another really, really, really common misconception is not understanding
2040.64s: that Max Payne moves.
2042.32s: So as options are traded, Max Payne will move.
2048.40s: So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy in certain circumstances, not always.
2053.48s: If there's a really big build out of options, that happens to be super far away
2058.24s: from Max Payne.
2059.24s: And it just is what it is.
2060.48s: Then there can be a big variance between them.
2063.72s: But like, for example, this doesn't let me go back in time.
2067.28s: But if you take a look at just overall Max Payne, you can see between calls and puts here,
2075.88s: but you can see where Max Payne is for next week, 60 to eat right now.
2080.12s: It's 25.
2081.48s: If you monitor this throughout the week, it's going to move.
2085.56s: So it's an important note.
2087.24s: Let's see if this one lets us go back in time.
2091.96s: This is for next week.
2098.72s: It doesn't.
2099.68s: I'm so surprised that these don't track historic.
2102.00s: That's a little, I don't know what Max Payne was.
2105.20s: Do any of you guys know what Max Payne was for yesterday?
2107.76s: I'm really surprised that none of these have any sort of historic way to go back and look at what it was.
2120.96s: BDOS says 25.
2122.32s: Yeah, that's like actually a great example.
2125.96s: The fact that Max Payne is all the way up at 25 and it closed at 24.
2131.08s: It's not even close to it.
2132.80s: But obviously the market makers, I think,
2134.92s: still had a vested interest in the fight of trying to get it to,
2140.44s: they would have preferred to be at 2399.
2144.36s: But the fact that it was at 24 would lead me to believe that there was resistance.
2150.80s: So any questions on where GameStop sits today,
2155.28s: anything that we should look at in particular, do you think or are you guys ready to go through the D library
2161.28s: and continue down the path?
2162.76s: There's two things I want to look at in the, oh, yeah, I forgot.
2165.24s: I told you I would go through the coverage triangle.
2168.56s: SPNR, well, says chart exchange says 2450.
2171.04s: Was that for yesterday or is that for next week?
2180.48s: Let's take a look at the coverage strangle really fast.
2183.56s: You don't have for GameStop.
2190.00s: So this is what the position sits at today.
2193.20s: And again, this is like the model position that I share with you all to use as an example.
2199.60s: The last couple trades that were made were on the 4th of March.
2203.28s: And I think I covered this in the video from last week, so I won't spend a lot of time on it.
2209.68s: The couple of things to keep in mind.
2212.08s: First, you can see that the puts that came down here on that originally were sold on 30 Jan,
2222.96s: this line item.
2224.48s: The puts came down at a small loss.
2226.64s: You could consider this a role or you could consider it whatever you want.
2231.44s: But effectively, what I wanted to do here was take these puts down,
2236.56s: mostly because they were starting to be challenged.
2241.76s: And you can see what the strike price was for them.
2245.52s: So the strike price was 25.
2248.72s: And all I did was take those puts in.
2252.88s: And I sold them originally for 142, took them in for 185, so that net's a $205 loss.
2259.28s: And then I sold the 23s collecting 203, which is still even a credit over this,
2264.08s: although it doesn't need to be.
2266.00s: And this is the new basis for the short puts.
2268.72s: These are out in 17 April.
2270.56s: And I'll show you why I do it this way.
2273.52s: I need to move this down and this down to show you the example.
2283.76s: So what I'm doing is I'm just kind of throwing up.
2293.36s: Well, it's frozen.
2294.80s: So I'm doing shit.
2296.32s: There it goes.
2298.64s: So I'm just going to throw in the strikes.
2307.60s: And so we went from 25,
2311.28s: 23.
2317.28s: And the reason why I'm doing this is because there's an important point that I want you to be
2324.88s: able to visualize.
2326.24s: Again, if you're to use anything like this or use this for inspiration in your management of stuff,
2332.72s: which I obviously don't recommend.
2335.68s: I am just an online dude.
2337.84s: You should do whatever's right for you.
2339.76s: But I want to give you some thought where to work off of.
2342.88s: So if we take a look at the the basis change.
2355.04s: You know, this keeps freezing.
2357.68s: It's driving me crazy.
2360.24s: Effectively, what we're doing is we're moving the two points between these two.
2365.76s: And this will show us like what the percent change is.
2369.92s: And there's a more important point to this, which is this.
2382.56s: The cash-secured put change is the total amount of money.
2387.60s: It's going to take us to cash secure the new position versus the old position.
2394.80s: So the way that we would do the math for something like this, which you can track for yourself,
2398.80s: we effectively would take the new strike, whatever that is.
2405.12s: Multiply that by the size, meaning how many contracts multiply that by 100.
2412.48s: That's the starting point.
2413.76s: So in this case, it's a five-lot here.
2425.20s: Close that off.
2427.04s: And then we would subtract.
2431.68s: This times the trade size times 100.
2446.40s: It's freezing again.
2447.60s: That's why it's taking its time.
2450.00s: Where do we miss?
2456.96s: That's there.
2461.84s: I see we need one more.
2466.00s: There we go.
2467.60s: And this one is also should be a five-lot.
2479.44s: So here's what happens.
2482.08s: If we take a look at the amount to cash-secure this first position,
2497.04s: it equals this times this times 100.
2505.52s: So this requires 12,500 to cash-secure this position.
2512.16s: And then if we take a look at what it costs to cash-secure this position,
2517.68s: it's this times this times 100.
2537.60s: So I'm just showing you the individual line items.
2541.28s: Obviously we already have the summation down here.
2544.16s: I want the reason why I break it down this way is my intention is for you to understand.
2549.28s: It's not just for you to see what it is.
2551.68s: I want you to understand what it is, why the numbers are, what they are.
2556.56s: The main reason for that in case you don't know is because the only way to develop confidence,
2566.48s: really, in anything that you're doing is to have an understanding of the sources of things.
2572.80s: You can't really fake confidence.
2574.48s: Confidence comes from, again, understanding what you're looking at and understanding how things work.
2581.36s: So this is exactly why the adjustment was made.
2586.96s: It's not just so that, oh, I'm concerned about being assigned on GameStop at 25 or 23 or whatever.
2596.88s: It's not just because of that.
2599.20s: It's because by moving this strike, two points, I decrease the amount that I have to have
2609.68s: in order to cash-secure the position by $1,000.
2614.16s: That is not a ton of money, but relative to the portfolio value of 25K,
2622.88s: that's actually not an inconsequential amount of money.
2628.56s: It's like 4%.
2632.96s: By adjusting things this way, it gives me an ability to move the basis around
2642.24s: so that as GameStop is going down, I can take in shares when I'm ready
2651.04s: at an improved basis that makes sense for the broader portfolio.
2655.12s: Now, realistically, that could have been at 25, because my current basis is at 28.21.
2660.72s: No problem taking in the shares at 25.
2664.08s: However, if you take a look at how much is currently utilized, we absolutely have this space
2671.76s: to take those shares on the assignment if we were so inclined.
2675.04s: But I want to wait and see where GameStop levels off.
2681.12s: And then I can choose either to allow puts to be assigned or just to continue to roll them
2686.24s: until they're profitable to where I want them to be and just buy the shares outright.
2689.44s: Either of those scenarios are completely fine.
2693.20s: Dylan says, great thought about the adjustment down per assignment being at the lower basis.
2697.60s: Thank you for the thought, of course.
2698.88s: Yeah. Again, if you have any questions on what I'm talking about, please ask me,
2703.92s: because that's genuinely the whole purpose of me running this strategy in this stock
2711.04s: is because I want to help you learn how this can be used if it's something that fits
2718.80s: or even tangentially, it's what you're doing more broadly.
2723.20s: Now, one thing to note on the short call side of things, and this is absolutely worth noting.
2730.48s: You can see that the short calls have actually been providing a bit of relief for the broader trade.
2736.80s: There's $471 made on the short calls, which again, it's not a lot of money.
2742.32s: But if you take this total short call collection by the total basis that we have,
2752.56s: the stock is been objectively going down.
2756.00s: And on the invested capital that's in GameStop right now, these have made 1.9% return.
2762.80s: Again, that's not like, oh, wow, making huge bank here, obviously not.
2769.28s: But this is doing much better than if I'm just holding the underlying.
2776.88s: In that scenario, this is absolutely crushing it on a comparative basis.
2783.84s: And it's because of these small little efficiencies we gain from the satellite positions via the
2789.52s: options. But right now, the danger I have is on this side, which you need to see.
2798.56s: And this gets into a much more advanced method of trading, which is, if you take a look at the
2806.72s: strike price relative to my basis for the short call. My basis is 2821. The strike price as
2816.00s: things sit right now is at just 21. So the problem is if I get assigned, I'm essentially taking a
2825.60s: $7 loss, which is pretty much catastrophic. That would be really, really bad.
2833.60s: So this short call that I have on is actually going to have to be very actively monitored and
2840.48s: managed. The way that I do this is simple. I set up, typically, a bunch of different alerts.
2849.60s: And I also don't think it's at 21, one sec. Let me actually figure out where it is because I wouldn't
2853.60s: have sold it below current price either. That's obviously a typo. Give me one sec.
2858.72s: But I do know it's, I don't even know if it's below basis, because I think I might have moved it.
2866.08s: One second, we will get to the bottom of said,
2871.84s: of said position. I'm just logging into the thinkorswim mobile or the web browser.
2888.56s: What is happening?
2906.48s: Like not loading for some reason. I don't know why. Let me take a look at one other thing.
2912.32s: Really. I tried looking at it on the phone, but it's also down there. It might be something with
2919.52s: thinkorswim. This also happened yesterday, where it's definitely something with thinkorswim.
2932.40s: Yeah. Okay. So it says we'll be conducting routine maintenance on Saturday. So that's exactly
2936.40s: what it is. Anyways, I can figure out the position through here. So give me one second.
2940.00s: I'll let you know what it actually is.
2953.04s: It's the 31s. Aha. That finger slip.
2960.88s: I was gonna say, because that seems much lower than what I would have gone. Okay. That makes
2966.08s: way more sense. Okay. So back to this though, to walk you through,
2980.64s: this should be 31. Going off of that example though, just playing if I had to sell them below my
2988.96s: basis, which I do. As you could tell, it didn't shock me. The only thing that shocked me is that
2993.92s: with the stock at 24, I wouldn't have gone like $3 in the money. That doesn't really make sense.
3000.56s: And what I'm doing here is keeping a really light number of short calls, because again,
3009.60s: we never know when GameStop is gonna pop. And I probably will scale this up. Now that GameStop
3016.72s: is kind of stabilizing. And I'll probably sell two so that I have two short calls against the
3023.04s: 250 shares. And this is what the intention of managing those short calls if they fell on the money.
3029.52s: But except in the fact that if there is a squeeze of some sort, there's a really good chance that
3033.92s: they would get assigned early and take the shares, which is okay. That generally would still be
3040.24s: a fairly profitable position for me. So that's the position as it sits. This number's messed up.
3048.08s: It's obviously pulling it from a random spot. I don't know where it's pulling it from.
3054.32s: The reason why all this stuff gets messed up is because when I take this from my actual
3061.28s: trade log, it messes up where everything is getting generated. What does this say? B215,
3070.00s: cracked, 17, which is cracked, 18. Yeah, because what I can tell you is I do not have a dividend
3077.84s: of $12,000. It would be nice. That's more cracked. It was pulling all of this stuff.
3084.24s: So anyways, that is the covered, stringled trade as it sits right now in GameStop.
3090.72s: We are 74% utilized. So about 15% left to go. We need $18,500 to cash secure everything I have out
3099.60s: as it sits. That includes cash secured puts and the long equity. The majority of the position right
3107.20s: now for the cash secured element is from the cash secured put side of things. The primary reason
3117.68s: for that realistically is because it's going down. So when the stock is going down like this,
3122.88s: I don't want to hold the equity. It's because it's going the wrong way. Now for GameStop,
3129.44s: I also, and generally the coverage triangle, I don't like unwinding the equity. If it's going down,
3136.00s: the times I'll do that is if I'm trading the coverage triangle on a leveraged ETF, if you're
3140.32s: following the other stuff I do, you will have seen me do that in T-Triple Cues, but that's because
3144.96s: it's three times leveraged. It's a completely different thing. But what I will do is scale out of
3149.84s: the trade, which is exactly what I did here. Then I started nibbling with some really small
3154.64s: positions. That's where that 50 share came from as we were coming down to dollar cost average in.
3162.40s: So that's where things sit. If you have any questions on this, let me know. But otherwise,
3165.92s: let's get into the DD library. And before the DD library, I want to show you this study so that you
3173.76s: can look it up at your leisure, really whenever, really whenever you have a little time to read through
3182.16s: this stuff, I think it's useful in understanding the broader market.
3185.92s: This not only talks about GameStop, but it talks about the broader
3197.04s: the broader condition of things like seller boxing, which I believe is highly relevant
3206.24s: to GameStop. I think as most people probably guess, I think that that's one of the dominant things
3212.96s: that we started seeing in the beginning of why GameStop was being targeted the way it was.
3220.48s: So I definitely think that there's a pretty important element of GameStop in here, but it talks
3228.96s: about these other effects as well more broadly. And I think it's useful because one of the things
3236.64s: to keep in mind as a trader is you can trade this same effect in other tickers. It's not just GameStop
3248.88s: that demonstrates short squeezes, gamma squeezes and things like that that are heavily, heavily monetizable.
3256.08s: So that's really what this study is about. It's pretty interesting. It's honestly not the most
3261.28s: well done that I've seen, but it does a good job tying together some of the themes that you're
3267.04s: used to seeing in terms of excessive short interest in terms of seeing synthetic locates and
3275.44s: deliveries even via deep in the money long calls, those kinds of things. So I think it's probably
3284.56s: worth checking out, but we left off on my boy Dave Lauer. And this is actually funny because I did
3292.08s: a podcast with Dave Lauer and Irvin finance. Those are, that's, I actually invested in them a while
3300.80s: ago when they were even before they came on like the major funding platforms from a just angel
3309.44s: investing perspective. Because I like Dave a lot. I think it's cool. And I think the platform is neat.
3314.64s: The mission of the platform is also very cool to kind of connect traders together and then also
3320.16s: to connect companies with their shareholders directly. This attacks a big factor that you've seen
3328.08s: before and talked about by like Dr. Susan Trimbath who's saying that during some of these proxy
3334.16s: meetings and whatnot, we're getting guidance from more shareholders than we have, which is obviously
3342.40s: in utter joke. But there Irvin is is helping with that. Let me pop the door for a real fast.
3360.56s: So let's see what our boy Dave has.
3364.16s: Okay, cool. Now one of the things is I'm going to read this one pretty carefully because Dave
3373.12s: is well researched and he's highly knowledgeable. So I'm actually pretty interested in what he has to
3380.32s: say here. Let's see. Recently, and since I've joined the subreddit, there have been a ton of
3389.60s: questions around the role that dark pools play in US equity market structure. This is awesome.
3394.64s: Want to put together a post to clarify some things about how they operate, what they do and what
3398.16s: they cannot do. This is super important because you've also heard me talk about this a lot. And I
3403.84s: noticed that this misunderstanding absolutely perpetuates where people broadly do not follow
3413.60s: why and how these things work, which is actually quite, quite important. So let's dig in and see
3422.80s: what's up. I'm texting Mel real quick to see what time she's going to be back because if she's
3426.80s: not going to be back for a little bit, I'm going to have to pop off for a second just to feed Thor.
3430.80s: But then we'll keep a push. But what time we at 52, we still got some.
3437.60s: He can wait unless you guys don't want Thor to wait to eat, but I say he can wait. He's fine.
3443.60s: He's got plenty of bad on him. Okay, dark pools were created as part of regulation,
3451.44s: ATS, the alternative trading system in 98. Originally, they were predominantly ECNs,
3457.28s: electronic crossing networks, including the ones you're familiar with today as exchanges,
3462.00s: ARCA, direct edge. Ultimately, though, most dark pools after rag NMS was implemented in 07.
3469.12s: We're either broker owned UBS, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, or independent
3474.96s: block trading facilities such as LiquidNet. Note that I'm not discussing OTC over the counter
3480.16s: trading. And obviously I am reading from Dave Lauer's perspective here, which is what Citadel
3485.68s: in virtue, virtue due to internalize retail trades. This distinction massively important to
3495.20s: understand at the highest level. OTC and internalization of orders is very different than this.
3504.56s: Let's continue to understand dark pools and what makes them different from exchanges.
3508.16s: Need to understand regulatory nuances and market data characteristics. It's easier to get approval
3513.28s: for a dark pool regulated by Fennred than an exchange regulated by SEC comparatively. This is
3519.04s: on purpose. The ATS is there's supposed to be a way to foster competition and innovation,
3523.68s: unfortunately, that is resulted in 40 plus dark pools and extreme off exchange fragmentation.
3529.28s: And this is also why for the first time in a long time, you actually see off exchange volume
3535.12s: broadly exceeding on exchange volume. That's crazy. Anyways, most dark pools are ostensibly to
3542.08s: allow institutional asset managers to post large orders that they do not want to be visible on
3547.44s: exchange. There are different reasons why they do not want these orders to be visible on exchange.
3555.12s: And they're not all bad. One of the reasons is because if I am a pension fund, big mutual fund,
3562.16s: whatever, and I want to unwind or let's say I want to buy $10 million of Apple stock from UBS or
3572.56s: somebody else. Well, in order for that transaction to happen, UBS has to first sell the shares,
3582.00s: which causes tanking, which causes everybody to start losing their minds because it's tanking
3588.88s: before I can go in and buy the shares. So it actually massively, massively, broadly led to a big issue
3601.36s: where it's not possible for these two entities to directly correlate and to essentially say,
3607.36s: yo, I want to take this volume and just essentially facilitate a direct transfer.
3613.36s: The other thing is front running because as soon as any traders, high frequency traders,
3619.20s: Algo traders, even well structured retail traders, we'll see that kind of order flow and immediately
3626.56s: start trying to participate and pick it off. So dark pools, they, they're really not all evil and
3633.52s: not all bad, although the way that they're used now, unfortunately, is generally not ideal.
3641.20s: Moses says, hello, Eric, I sold puts on TQ strikes 83 78, both got a sign drawdown is killing me
3647.04s: because even if I sell calls to market is filing falling harder, my cost basis sits at 78,
3652.56s: any advice. A bunch of stuff, I, if you don't mind, I want to keep it focused on GameStop for now
3659.36s: and then after we get through this, if you remind me of your question at the end, happy to talk about it
3664.24s: with you. Jerry says, I can't believe your boy PB got caught being a private equity plant,
3671.12s: your boy Tom Soznaf from Motley Fool, still shorting Jimmy. I didn't know that about PB in terms
3679.60s: of being a private equity plant, not sure what that is to be honest. And Tom Soznaf, I don't know
3685.36s: the Motley Fool comment there. Tom Soznaf is from Tasty, they have like their own, their own brokerage.
3693.44s: So what do you mean from Motley Fool? Oh, maybe you're using it as like a joke saying like Motley Fool.
3701.76s: I don't know because in case you don't know, Motley Fool is actually a firm. They do like
3709.28s: research. I don't know if you know that. But Tom's not part of Motley Fool, at least as far as I know.
3720.32s: These guys. Are you confusing people? Are you confusing Tom Soznaf with Tom Gardner?
3731.76s: Is that it?
3739.36s: I don't know.
3744.08s: Age says the PB thing is some GME ex account talking shit slash rage baiting. Oh, so it's not.
3750.96s: I was going to say I was just texting with them the other day. I don't know him or really like the
3756.72s: the main people that I know well in like the you know retail, content, trading, space.
3765.92s: I mean, Matt Caruso, I know him probably the best because I've talked to him for a long time.
3771.52s: And then I know Tom pretty well now. People like that you and Sinclair, I know quite well. He's
3777.52s: going to be on the podcast again soon. But PB, I met him pretty recently. But we do talk, but he never
3783.20s: mentioned anything like that. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure the details on it. If you have what the
3789.52s: post is or whatever, I'm happy to take a look at it. Okay. So here it says this is the fundamental
3797.60s: difference between dark pools and exchanges. No orders are visible on dark pools. Hence dark where
3803.84s: you have some where you can have visible orders on exchanges. Now you can also have hidden orders
3810.72s: on exchanges. Absolutely iceberg orders and things like that. And there's nothing preventing
3815.68s: an ATS from posting quotes. Bloomberg used to do this all the time. However, generally speaking
3822.40s: today, there aren't dark pools that show any posted orders. So what about the trades? All trades
3830.80s: in the national market system have to be printed to a sip feed. It does not matter where they happen.
3837.44s: This is super important. And all trades during regular hours 0 9 30 to 1600. That's eastern time.
3845.20s: Must be within the N BB. Oh, these are hard and fast rules cannot be violated. All trades on
3853.04s: exchanges are reported to the regular sip, which is essentially like the the consolidated tape.
3860.00s: That's orders that go through the dark pool are still going to hit the consolidated tape.
3867.12s: All trades, all trades that happen off exchange ATS or OTC are reported to the trade reporting
3873.92s: facility TRF run by NYC NASDAQ or FINRA. All trades have to be reported to the TRF within 10
3880.64s: seconds. So this is the consolidated tape element of being executed. Though the reality is that
3885.52s: they're reported nearly instantaneously. So the delay is much less than that.
3892.48s: This gives you a chart of the reporting requirements and timelines. There's a question on Fox
3899.60s: and Twitter yesterday. Can hedge funds go short in dark pools and not need to report it?
3905.28s: I did not mean to be flippant in my tweet about how it's nonsensical, but I had a long day,
3909.92s: no brain power left. But such a statement is nonsensical. It's not how dark pools work. Yeah.
3915.12s: So I don't know the tweet that Dave's referring to, but that's honestly just a function of
3921.92s: when you do this a lot, I noticed myself not always always having the the major patience that
3929.28s: I would want to have with people. But you do start to answer a lot of a lot of the same things
3935.36s: over and over again. And Dave is a great guy and I think he does his best as well. But we're all
3940.72s: human, right? It's kind of like that question stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of dark pools.
3949.52s: And sometimes when people again, I don't know this instance, but for context, sometimes when
3954.64s: people postulate things, they postulate it in the context of like, this is what's happening versus
3961.68s: asking like, is this what's happening? So what I mean by that is again, I don't know the post
3966.88s: he's referring to, but a lot of times people will say things like hedge funds, hedge funds can
3972.72s: go short in dark pools and they don't need to report it, right? They can say it like that.
3977.52s: It doesn't sound like that's what happened here. But anyways, I just I identify with Dave here
3982.80s: and Dave is such a nice guy that I want to defend him a little bit because I don't think,
3988.08s: well, at least I hope people don't think he's flippant. He's definitely not.
3992.32s: There is practically no difference at all between trades executed on exchange or off exchange,
3998.56s: especially when you're talking about reporting, short positions or short sale marking.
4003.76s: The rules are identical. Regardless, short sale marking is not dependent on whether you trade
4008.80s: on or off exchange, not trying to make a statement as to whether firms are doing it adequately or
4012.96s: accurately, which is exactly correct. There's a difference in reporting, which we do know that a lot
4018.48s: of places do not report effectively. And a lot of places just kind of willingly accept the penalty
4027.20s: for not reporting effectively. I also have never heard of this idea that firms will choose whether to
4035.36s: execute on or off exchange based on where they want buying pressure or selling pressure to show up.
4041.12s: Every sophisticated trading firm out there is watching the TRF and categorizes every trade that
4045.44s: takes place relative to the MBBO. Every time a trade happens at the ask or near it, they characterize
4051.36s: that as a buy. Every time happens near a bid, characterize it as a sell. You cannot hide
4056.72s: what you were doing in dark pools or through OTC internalization. It cannot be done. All trades
4061.68s: are public and reported within 10 seconds. That's correct. Yeah. Here's what I think was trying to
4066.24s: be said. If trades are taking place OTCs such as retail orders that are being internalized, this is
4070.32s: exactly where things get more interesting. By sitting at L over two, both of those firms qualify
4075.68s: as market makers. Market makers do have an exemption for short selling. They are allowed to do so without
4081.12s: having to locate the shares first. This gets into naked shorting and things like that.
4086.08s: I'm just trying to help you understand that dark pools are not nefarious and that there's very
4089.12s: little difference between dark pools and exchanges from trading, position marking. Yeah, this
4092.80s: I agree. Can you use dark pools and off exchange trading to artificially hold on the price of
4097.84s: a stock? I struggled to see the mechanism by which this can be done. Never heard of it other than
4102.40s: here. As I've said several times, every trade needs to be reported. Every single trade that buys
4107.20s: GME reported to the tape. There's no hiding that. The only market manipulation I've ever
4111.68s: studied or measured has been the subject enforcement action by the SEC has been on exchanges.
4116.56s: That is done with layering and spoofing, which is actually a massive problem by the way. Yeah.
4121.44s: So I actually think this is good. He does also dive into the fact that, and we talked about this
4130.48s: actually earlier before we even got to this, which is way too much off exchange trading.
4138.64s: Ben says there are transactions that do not have to be reported to the consolidated tape.
4143.04s: It depends on the transaction. If an order is internalized, it doesn't, but other than that,
4148.56s: it's going to have to consolidate a tape if it goes through a dark pool. That's the whole point.
4152.64s: So yeah, it depends on your understanding of what other kind of transactions you're talking about.
4160.24s: But if something is internalized, that's the main issue with internalized orders.
4164.96s: Is that they don't hit the consolidated tape? That's the contention.
4167.84s: Okay. That was awesome. I actually like that one a whole lot.
4176.16s: Also just because I like Dave, but okay. Let's take a look at one more. I'm going to go
4184.96s: grab a drink and feed Thor real quick. So it'll probably be like less than two minutes.
4227.92s: 걸c
4235.36s: Okay
4239.92s: All right. How do we do? Also, Thor is very thankful, by the way, because homie was super
4261.56s: hungry. So thank you guys for hanging in there for a second.
4266.16s: We come back with a coconut pineapple, seltzer water, which is actually quite good.
4271.76s: H says the PB thing is some GME X account talk. The subject is that PB worked in FinTech
4280.28s: and post about other topics than GME PB posted a rebuttal to address it. I mean, yeah, I
4286.44s: guess I don't see any issue with that. I don't understand any issue with like people
4289.92s: talking about stuff other than GameStop. I don't think and I also don't think that there's
4293.20s: anything wrong with people working in industry. Dave Lauer worked in industry. Like, I don't
4298.76s: know why people try to use that as like ammunition to tear down people that are actually trying
4305.32s: to help shed light on the broader thing. Funny enough timing that this is the next thing
4311.16s: that we pop up is by PB. I feel like it would be much smarter for folks to evaluate people
4321.56s: based on what they say. And like you can assess if people are genuine or not. Because like,
4329.80s: I don't actually get the issue. So Jerry, maybe you can help me with that because it sounds
4334.32s: like you're one of those people that might have an issue with it. And then Jerry says,
4338.60s: oh, you're right. Tom Soznov not from Motley Fool, but he did short GameStop and is tied
4342.64s: to Apex clearing from TD. We all know it. Apex and TD Ameritrade did to GME even worse.
4350.12s: I don't know about the context with TD Ameritrade, but he's never he's never shorted GameStop.
4360.12s: He Tom Soznov trades options. He's sold calls on GameStop. He's never shorted GameStop.
4366.28s: It's different. I'm selling calls in GameStop right now against long shares that I have. So
4375.00s: I'm not sure what the desire is to like, what's the outcome there? What's the objective? I don't
4383.32s: fully get it. Jerry says Dave Lauer worked for Citadel. Yeah. And that's not the only place he
4389.40s: worked at. Dave Lauer is a really smart dude that has worked out of a lot of very high quality top
4397.56s: performing financial places. Just like Citadel operating as a market maker, which is
4402.68s: the tough the tough gig. Let's see what this is. Major signals flashing code red shadow banking
4412.92s: system. So for those that don't know, one of the things I noticed about PB is that he's very
4419.32s: into liquidity and market provision. So that's what I'm assuming a lot of this is going to be about.
4426.52s: Does this have a date for all 21? The real issue is much worse. Signs that the entire banking
4436.28s: system is straining under the weight of massive liquidity injections from the Fed. Okay. Yes.
4441.24s: Right liquidity. So it doesn't surprise me. Reverse repose extremely similar short term cash
4447.32s: loans. Yep. Yep. Yep. The end results from a RAP is that the MF is able to use its cash under
4455.48s: yep. Okay. I'm trying to see as many pointed out this many massive figures concerning because
4467.16s: it's a symptom of serious issue in the market. Oh, I see. I understand his perspective now. I think
4473.48s: the thing with respect to liquidity, especially during like 2020, 2021, I think it's a very different
4482.44s: environment, a very different environment. The entire banking system entering a credit contraction.
4502.04s: Let's actually see where this sits. Let me go to red. Let's go check out our friend.
4514.52s: Let me sign in. Let's go to Lord dashboard, shall we?
4532.52s: Here we go. And then what is this one commercial industrial loans commercial banks? Let's add that one.
4543.48s: So just so you can see what I'm doing here. And by the way, this is free. Like everybody can open
4550.28s: a frat account. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to find the same, the same metrics he's
4559.72s: looking at just so that we can see how it's trended over time because it's interesting. So this
4564.44s: is commercial industrial loans all commercial banks. Let's see. This is the link when see stuff.
4570.12s: I've built like a bunch of composite stuff to give me a sense of
4577.72s: general like market health. But let's add one. Let's add a graph.
4585.24s: I think this is just freezing there goes. And commercial and industrial loans.
4603.48s: Let's do five year observation.
4607.32s: Five years is a little too long to be honest. Damn, I wish it would let me do that though. That's okay.
4622.04s: We'll do five years. Let's see.
4629.96s: Yeah, so we can actually see from the lens of what he was talking about.
4634.36s: He's showing this decline that you see here. But it actually normalized and started expanding again.
4652.52s: So if we look at this one more specifically, we go back 10 years. I think he had a set to max.
4662.12s: You can actually see it looks completely fine. Here's COVID down to here.
4668.52s: And then from that point forward, it's actually been expanding again. Which this doesn't surprise me,
4673.88s: right, to see the follow-through from the COVID issue. Stuff like that takes a little bit of time.
4680.76s: So yeah, this is, this is unsurprising to me broadly.
4688.28s: Did he spread what is this commercial industrial loans bank credit continuing to contract?
4699.24s: So I think that's from the leads and lags of the system. Despite trillions being pumped into the
4706.68s: economy, the economy is supposedly recovering what's going on. Yeah, I think I honestly think that's
4711.88s: just leads and lags of the economic system. It takes time.
4718.04s: Liabilities and capital liabilities. Let's see how that one is trending.
4725.80s: And it widgets.
4733.80s: We want to add liabilities.
4745.56s: Capital liabilities deposits US treasury.
4755.48s: Capital liabilities deposits.
4772.20s: General account Wednesday level. Okay. Let's add this.
4778.28s: And we will need to have two different access.
4795.08s: Yeah, there we go.
4799.88s: So right now it's combining the access and we want to.
4804.68s: Let's find.
4810.52s: So that's on the left axis. This should be on the right.
4815.96s: There we go. And then this can be a solid line as well.
4827.40s: And then we'll just make this a different color. So it's easier to see.
4835.40s: So there's our graph. Let's see.
4841.64s: Massive cash influx treasury. Yes.
4845.72s: Government didn't start drawing down. Yes.
4850.92s: Absolutely. But we can see that again, like even here, it's recovered.
4859.16s: So I think this is another artifact of just the leads and lags.
4865.08s: That's mostly what I'm seeing.
4871.00s: That ownership of treasury bonds, we already know that this is going down.
4877.00s: Yeah, interesting. I like the piece. Obviously, we have to evaluate the piece relative to the time
4883.16s: that he was looking at it, which what we're doing now, which is our ability to take a look at
4890.04s: information that we know and evaluate it as it stands. Obviously, it's different than
4898.60s: what he was looking at then. So yeah, I definitely think that there's
4907.72s: something to be said, but I think that the leads and lags are important to consider.
4913.96s: Cool. All right, gang. Now, there was a couple of things that I said that we would take a look
4924.44s: at before we wrapped up. So now's the perfect time to let me know what we're supposed to look at
4930.84s: and to remind me that would be awesome. And then we can take a look at everything together.
4943.16s: H says same, the whole narrative of rage, anyone on the other side.
4952.52s: Moises says, can we look at TQs? Yeah, definitely. So talk to me again about TQs, specifically with
4960.28s: like what? What you're trying to do, because to me, it sounds like you honestly just have a
4969.88s: position that's gone against you and you're kind of like gridlocked, which is suboptimal. I'm
4976.04s: going to turn off think or swim because it's going through an update right now. So what I'll do
4982.28s: is I will grab instead trading view. I'll just let that turn off.
5000.84s: TQs. So talk to me. What do you struggle with here? What are you trying to do?
5019.24s: And then once I have a little bit of context, all
5023.00s: might be able to help you a little bit. We'll see. Kind of depends on what you're hoping for.
5036.76s: I'm still trying to get this my little dashboard to look the way I want.
5041.80s: Not then. Okay. Well, that's right. In general, I think to even give you like an overview. One of
5060.52s: the things to keep an eyeball on is most of says I was looking at this for long term, but got wrapped
5068.04s: up in the big downfalls. Okay. So then if you're looking at it for the long term, then what's the
5076.60s: what's the issue?
5083.80s: Because it's going down. I mean, you're trading a three times levered ETF. I don't know.
5090.60s: I'm not really sure what your expectations were, but QQQ hasn't even gone down yet.
5098.84s: What? Like 539 down to a low of 480. Let's see. 539 down to 480. 539 down to 480.
5112.60s: So 10, so 11% dropped. It's not even in a bear market yet. It's definitely crossed into a correction.
5120.84s: No doubt there. But I get like that's kind of the confusion, right? It's like I don't fully understand
5132.04s: what you expected to happen here, but it sounds like you might have gone into this with maybe not
5137.96s: doing your research on how the underlying itself might behave and it sounds like that might
5145.08s: might have such a down the wrong path. Moses says it worries me that maybe I won't be able to recover
5151.64s: when the market turns bullish again. I see. Yeah. So I mean, broadly, this just sounds like you got
5157.16s: into something that you didn't research. So then in that instance, you kind of have to think through
5163.16s: what you're comfortable with and what you want to happen from here. But that's absolutely the
5170.60s: broad context of what this is, right? So then from there, it really comes down to
5181.16s: how do you choose to proceed from here? Anytime a trader has something on that they're
5186.52s: uncomfortable with or didn't think through, I generally think that flattening and moving
5193.72s: into something else that you research a little bit more is typically a better choice. But I mean,
5200.44s: only you can make that decision for yourself, right? It'll have to be you analyzing what you think
5207.32s: is going to happen. But what I can tell you from what I can tell you from a broader context,
5217.00s: though, for sure, is that like what you're seeing right now is this is not bad. Like we're not
5226.60s: at a point yet where this is a big massive down move in the market. So if this is making you nervous,
5238.60s: that's not good because it can get much worse.
5241.24s: So one of the things I would recommend with anything before you get into it is especially like
5250.28s: a leveraged ETF is this here. Just zoom out, right? And Moses says I did research, but I'd like
5263.08s: some advice on how to protect further than just selling calls. There is no protection. You can
5269.24s: try to offset some of your deltas by buying puts to create a floor to the downside, but that's
5274.84s: going to be really expensive. The whole nature of the position as it sits is to put on risk and to
5283.80s: take risk. So if you start putting out, hey, if you start putting on a bunch of long puts,
5293.40s: you know, for quote unquote protection to the downside, then you essentially start effectively
5298.04s: undoing the risk that you're taking. So it doesn't even make sense to have the position.
5301.88s: But it confuses me when you say that you did your research. This isn't to get at you, but it's
5307.32s: if this is what you consider doing research, then I do think that there's a problem here, right?
5311.96s: Because if we take a look at the move here, from here to here, this represents a 43% decline
5326.76s: over 29 trading days of 43% decline. And so far, what we're seeing here
5340.84s: is a 30% decline. So we're not even at anything commensurate with the recent down move,
5348.28s: let alone an actually bad down move. Because again, these are just tied to corrections. These aren't
5354.44s: tied to actual big market moves. This is a big market move. And here, T triple cues dropped 82%.
5362.36s: So literally double what this is. And this is also one of the downsides of trading three times
5369.56s: leverage ETF compared to stuff that's like two times leverage is that a three times leverage ETF
5374.68s: like this. If you take a look at how long it took for this to get back to break even,
5380.12s: it's actually kind of crazy. Because if you take a look at the highs that it posted here,
5386.76s: this was back on 22 November of 21. It literally poked its head above it on 16 Ds 24, and then still
5395.96s: hasn't been back to it. So effectively, this still has not been back above all time highs and
5403.40s: T triple cues. This is the exact nature of trading a leverage ETF. You kind of have to be prepared
5411.72s: for the moves. And then you have to have a game plan for them like the way that I trade,
5417.96s: because I'm trading a covered strangle right now in T triple cues, but the way that I manage it
5422.44s: is very similar to the way that I manage the covered strangle that I explained earlier in GameStop,
5428.04s: which is as the underlying is going down, I'm unwinding my position slowly into it to capture
5436.04s: profit, to lock in profit and to reduce downside exposure while simultaneously moving more and more
5443.96s: into cash secured puts so that I have a floating and adjustable cost basis. Because when you buy
5450.44s: the underlying at whatever price, your cost basis is now fixed, whatever that's at.
5459.16s: Moses says, oh, that's funny. Moses says, how are you managing your risk on your covered strangle
5463.32s: strategy? Yeah, no, it's actually a funny right? Because I automatically started going into that.
5469.08s: But literally what I just told you is exactly how. So what I do is that process. So right now,
5475.24s: as I look at my T triple cues position that's in the covered strangle, I am sitting at
5483.56s: 62% total utilization of how much money I've allocated to the position.
5490.84s: 17% of that is in the equity, meaning holding shares outright.
5496.84s: 44% of that 62% is in cash secured puts. And that's to give me the ability to adjust
5505.24s: and move my basis around because when we're hovering near all time highs, I don't like being
5510.60s: highly invested, especially in something like a three times leverage ETF because the risk becomes
5519.64s: increasingly pronounced. So that's exactly how I'm managing it by keeping the account really
5528.12s: carefully positioned as things sit now. So Moses, for you, I think what would make a lot of sense is
5536.20s: if you take some time and like carefully think through your opinion of cues, T triple cues,
5543.40s: the market is it sits now and then deciding if the position reflects something that you're comfortable
5552.92s: with what you want and then what makes sense going forward going forward from there.
5558.84s: But yeah, definitely wish you the best. The thing to keep in mind is that three times leveraged ETFs
5564.52s: can be that they can move nasty, right? Like this is literally an 82% decline and this is
5572.44s: during a moderate bear market. If you look at 2022 as a bear market in the S&P 500, the market was
5580.68s: down 19% in 22. The market was down 19.4%. Like that is a objectively light bear market and this
5590.92s: is the move that you saw on cues in T triple cues. If T triple cue was around during like the dot
5599.24s: com bubble, the it probably would have gone insolvent. The move here is another 73% down move.
5609.64s: So I mean, literally the way to look at T triple cues is within the last five years,
5615.00s: it's had 270% plus down moves, which is something to keep in mind.
5622.04s: Coffee Donuts and Homer says sell calls inputs to manage risk, right? Sort of, selling calls
5627.72s: doesn't really manage your risk. That's a common misconception. I actually don't even view it
5632.20s: as really offsetting the risk that much because it doesn't. Like if you're trading covered calls or
5636.92s: ratio covered calls, the short call element doesn't effectively help us that much. It helps a little
5642.44s: bit. The risk that you take from the long stock position is much greater than what you offset
5648.60s: from the short calls because of the uncapped downside versus capped profit potential of the
5653.72s: short calls. They don't pace one another. And then the short puts is actually increasing the risk
5659.88s: because if I sell puts, I increase my downside exposure again, unlimited risk technically down
5665.40s: to zero on the downside. So yeah, the main way you manage risk in something like trading
5673.48s: a leveraged ETF like this is through sizing. How much do you use of the account? Because again,
5680.44s: if I refer you back to the position that I have on right now, it's 62% utilized. And I'm 62%
5689.96s: utilized with T triple Q's 30% off of term highs. Right. So that goes to show like how lightly I
5700.84s: allocate to the trade because of this exact thing. I mean, to be honest with you, but my base,
5707.88s: this is in great right now. I'm long 300 shares at 7160. This is in the portfolio that I've been
5714.60s: sharing with you guys kind of like the example portfolio. So yeah, Ben says is 62% not high.
5723.72s: If this is the beginning, could your puts not all get assigned and then you don't have any capital
5727.72s: left? Hold on, let me reread that. Is 62% not high? If this is the beginning, could your puts not
5735.72s: all get assigned and then you don't have any capital left? No, the whole point is if the puts got
5745.56s: assigned right now, I would still have 38% of my capital left, not 62. And or not like the 62 is
5756.20s: all in, including the stock requirement and then the current cash secured put requirement.
5763.96s: And obviously that foregoes the entire game of managing the short puts, which is exactly what I'm
5770.20s: doing. I just rolled the short puts recently. Last week, I had on the third of March and on the fourth
5777.80s: of March, I rolled two tranches of short puts. I rolled 78s down to 75 and I rolled 70s down,
5788.20s: I took those down for a profit. So it's not even a role. I rolled 70s technically down to 60s.
5794.60s: So yeah, if the 62% is split right now between cash secured puts and long equity.
5803.64s: So, but even if like even playing the scenario, if I got assigned, I still have 38% of the capital to
5810.28s: use. So that's the whole point of striking a balance between utilization and allocation. It's
5817.64s: literally for that exact reason to make sure that the portfolio has a little bit of wiggle room.
5826.44s: Interesting, interesting question though. I hope that that helps at least a little bit.
5831.16s: Is there anything else you guys want to hit before I bounce?
5836.20s: Coffee Donuts says, did you get your trading license? What do you mean by trading license? Do you
5840.28s: mean like a series certification or do you mean like what does that mean trading license?
5846.44s: Technically, isn't a license. There's different certifications depending on
5852.28s: what you're trying to do like if you go through a series six, series seven, series 63. But those are
5860.52s: really for financial advisors to be licensed to do different kinds of broader financial activities.
5869.16s: So if you mean from that sense, no, I don't have any serious license,
5873.96s: because I'm a I'm a fucking degenerate retail trader. Don't need anything, which is crazy if
5881.24s: you think about it. It's absolutely insane that you can effectively do what we do with no
5891.24s: no licensing at all. But yeah, but I'm not sure if you're referring to like any other kind of
5896.44s: licensing, but I have a driver's license. Is that count? Ben says you have to pay more for
5907.24s: everything if you get certain licenses. Well, it's not just about what you have to pay. It's
5910.52s: again, it's about like the purpose of it because there's also restrictions that on what you can and
5914.84s: cannot do. So like that it's yeah, it adds a lot of nuances to what you're doing in order to
5924.84s: maintain the license. Moses says, what are you looking for when rolling puts? What are some key
5933.16s: points you check before rolling? I have several videos that will break that down for you in detail.
5941.56s: So there's this one. Moses, this one is for you. And then this one is for you. And then I'll give
5952.04s: you like an overview of those, but those two videos will go much further into detail.
5956.28s: Essentially, when I'm rolling options, I'm analyzing what the position is today. And then
5963.40s: what the market is doing and what the portfolio is doing. And then I
5969.72s: figure out what kind of adjustment for the short puts makes the most sense. Now to use the
5975.48s: recent moves in T triple Q's as an example, I'm really focusing on the basis adjustment.
5982.04s: Meaning again, like I went from the 78 strike down to the 75. And the reason for that is I'm
5989.96s: favoring trying to decrease the cost basis on the short puts in the event that I get assigned
5996.36s: is effectively as I can. And that's really designed to decrease the total risk, right? Because
6004.28s: I can buy more units of T triple Q's if I'm buying it at 75 versus 78 and so on and so forth.
6014.52s: So with something like T triple Q's, the whole point of the short puts is really to capture
6019.56s: variance risk premiums. I'm really not planning to get assigned on them most of the time.
6024.52s: So the rolling is really done to aggressively manage the basis to get me out of the trade faster.
6030.68s: And then says that 62% I thought of it does go 80% more down. 38% would not be enough leftover,
6039.24s: but I forgot you could roll. It's still plenty leftover. It's not it's not going to be enough to,
6045.08s: you know, completely undo whatever happened. But let's say for example, let's just do a little bit
6051.96s: of scratch math super fast. And then I got a bounce. But if we take a look at this,
6059.48s: well, let's just go into here. I don't know what all this is. We'll just get rid of it.
6067.64s: And let's say we have $100,000. And then I said what I'm going to use in 62% something like that,
6079.08s: 62% and what did I say the basis was 71?
6082.92s: 71, 60 or something like that. So this times this equals this divided by this. That's how many shares
6100.68s: that would represent using a sample $100,000. So then this is how much is left. That represents
6113.88s: $38,000. Let's say T triple Qs does go down another 80% from where it is now. And let's say that it's
6123.00s: trading at like 12 and just kind of spitballing. So this divided by this is 3,166 shares.
6135.72s: You have to round these down by the way. I'm just not bothering.
6138.44s: So then my aggregate basis would become this times this.
6147.72s: This, this, right. So it's these numbers.
6160.28s: Oh, I forgot because it's rounding it. I didn't expect it to be the perfect number.
6165.40s: And then total number of shares.
6170.12s: Nope. Don't want that way. This way.
6177.16s: So then this represents a cost basis of $25.
6185.32s: So in the scenario that you're outlining Ben, what essentially would happen is this would decrease
6194.20s: my cost basis from 71, 60 in this scenario down to 25. So then as the stock is trading around 12,
6201.88s: you can still sell short calls at least close to your basis.
6207.24s: And then you require obviously a much lower recovery move before you can get out at a profit.
6215.16s: Coffee says, do you show any or USMC friends how to trade options? Yeah, a couple of them.
6219.00s: Not too many are like that interested. But I have one really close friend that I got into
6223.80s: trading options that still trades today. And then there's another one that you guys have actually
6227.24s: seen around. His name's Tom. He's been busy with other stuff lately. But he's another one that
6234.04s: I've gotten into trading options. And then same thing with another one that you guys have seen
6238.12s: in the discord here and they're named Gary. So there's a handful, not a ton, but a handful.
6244.36s: Most people opt out rightfully so because trading options is pretty complex. You kind of have
6251.48s: to like really want to do it. But yeah, definitely. I show really anybody that's interested.
6259.16s: My best friend, Joe, I had him on the podcast a little bit in the beginning to try and help him.
6267.32s: I think we'll probably re-light that at some point because he's super smart. I think he could trade well.
6277.56s: Coffee says, did you trade while you're in? Absolutely, man. I traded while I was deployed.
6284.04s: I traded my, literally my entire adult life.
6290.60s: Started trading back in high school. So yeah, been doing it for a while.
6297.80s: All right, gang. Super fun hanging out. That wraps me up. As always, if you guys need anything,
6304.84s: let me know. I'll see you all on the episode next week. Be an outlier. Go live.
