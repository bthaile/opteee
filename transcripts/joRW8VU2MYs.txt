406.36s:  covered
406.88s:  string
407.86s:  around
416.86s:  studies before I didn't actually get all the way through this one yet, but I thought we could
421.74s:  take a look through it together. It's about GameStopNakedShorting. I'll show you the context of it.
427.74s:  This is it. I started going through it. There is a bunch of different versions of this kind of
433.98s:  research, but I thought it would be kind of cool to go through this together as well.
438.14s:  So that's the agenda for today. I figure I'll get us kicked off. We'll start as per usual
444.38s:  with just looking through GameStop, kind of analyzing where things sit today. I actually had a
449.82s:  really funny comment on one of my videos. Somebody effectively said they were like,
456.62s:  yo, Eric, you must have some crazy OCD if you're still covering GameStop, which I thought was
463.34s:  kind of funny because I think people are very temperamental, meaning if something's like
472.30s:  interesting, they go all in and they focus on it super heavily. And then if things lose their
478.30s:  interest, they pivot very quickly. Whereas it's exact opposite for me. Typically, once I start
484.70s:  doing something, unless there's some sort of significant reason why I would change,
489.74s:  I typically just kind of keep on the path. And it's why you see kind of the consistency I have,
496.62s:  right? The only time that you've seen me miss any of these live streams is either the one time I was
501.82s:  sick or if I'm traveling and even when I'm traveling, I still fit these in. And it's just kind of how
507.34s:  I'm hardwired. The reason why I'm mentioning this point is because when you're analyzing something like
513.18s:  markets, you have to be really consistent in what you're looking at, how you're studying it,
518.78s:  because there's so much information that you have to pick up that it's literally impossible to do it
525.66s:  kind of like if you're in this ebb and flow cycle. So all that aside, let's get into it.
532.22s:  Looks like we got Fuzzy here hanging out and we also got Dark Mark. Great to see both of you.
539.02s:  And I assume we'll get other people popping in as we go. And then the first starting point here
546.38s:  is I would love to hear from you in the chat specifically just to get a qualitative sense
555.58s:  of where you think GameStop is. So what I mean by that and the answer context that I'm looking for
566.22s:  is do you think GameStop is in the middle of a business level pivot or do you think GameStop
577.10s:  is in the process of optimizing its current business. And it's not really, you know,
585.50s:  binary. It has to be one or the other. But if you were to think about what the dominant force
591.34s:  right now for GameStop more broadly is, meaning the priorities for leadership, do you think it's
597.42s:  optimizing the existing business or do you think it's researching planning and preparing to pivot
604.14s:  into something else? What say you? Be dizzle also great to see you.
612.46s:  And I realize that this window is a little off skew. That's okay. That'd be all right.
619.26s:  Let's click over here. And while you're letting me know your thoughts, the reason why I'm asking
626.38s:  this is because of how GameStop is trading. And I'm going to give you my opinion in a moment.
631.50s:  But I am genuinely curious. Marcelo says both. Be dizzle says I'm hoping for a pivot,
638.94s:  but I can't help but feel it might still be a ways out in Ryan's focusing on the overall business.
645.74s:  Jesse Juice says I think it's a blend. I do think there's a larger pivot behind the scenes to collectibles.
652.38s:  I don't think Ryan Cohen's desire to challenge Amazon has gone away. That's a really interesting
658.06s:  point. Dylan says been a while, but have a few minutes to hear how the story is going. Good to see
664.86s:  you, Dylan. What is Dylan? You're a great example. Dylan, what has led to you kind of stepping away
672.70s:  from the GameStop sphere? I'm actually very, very curious is that you know, just got busy,
677.34s:  deprioritized things were moving slow. You're the exact person. I'm very curious in right now
684.46s:  because I think that what you're talking about and what you're saying is actually broadly
689.58s:  representative of what I imagine a lot of people are feeling right now.
695.66s:  Jesse says but the business optimization steps are crucial steps to make that transformation work.
699.82s:  Is that the case though? Because there are a lot of people that think GameStop should take like
707.10s:  this really hard pivot. One of the examples I see is GameStop effectively becoming like a holding
713.26s:  company. Again, I personally don't see that route, but like let's just take it what it is,
718.38s:  whether we agree with it or not. And if GameStop were to go that route, something like trying to
725.34s:  become a holding company, I think that we would actually see a very different response rate than
731.58s:  what we see right now. It's actually one of the dominant reasons why I don't think GameStop is going
737.42s:  the route of becoming a holding company because if GameStop's plan was to become a holding company,
743.42s:  going through this long, arduous process of trying to reconfigure the business is a massive
753.90s:  opportunity cost. And it's trying to salvage something that I think more broadly speaking, we know
761.42s:  is a very challenged field, meaning brick and mortar stores in general, but let alone brick and
769.10s:  mortar stores related to video games, devices and peripherals. So from that lens, I actually think we
777.10s:  can use that information to come up with a decent understanding of why GameStop is making the moves
784.46s:  that it is. And I think the fact that GameStop is going through and from the video I released on
789.50s:  Wednesday, you'll see that there's a bunch more store closings and stuff like that. And I feel
796.22s:  like if GameStop was going the route of being a holding company, you'd actually see that accelerate
800.30s:  massively. It wouldn't be like this slow thing that's kind of pocketed here and there, trying to
805.18s:  offload elements of the business in Canada, because it represents 5% of sales. It's stuff that's like
811.02s:  way, way, way broader scoped in that if they were going to make that big of a pivot.
816.22s:  Dylan says I saw GameStop is a brick business. And although I like the cash, I think no debt,
822.70s:  I just saw the rest of the market making moves. And with all respect, how to get out of game,
828.06s:  get out of the GameStop sandbox. I think it's smart. And I think that's one of the cool things,
833.50s:  at least I hope, about the way that I talk about GameStop and the way that I explore the space with
839.66s:  everybody, because I really apply the lens of a trader. Like that's what I am. Is I trade for
849.58s:  for a living? It's how I make money. So my lens towards GameStop is actually very similar to you,
856.22s:  Dylan, in the fact that in terms of what I do with the portfolio, it's broadly mixed. And it's
863.82s:  never been even remotely where GameStop is a dominant position for me. And it's not because
869.18s:  of any sort of feeling towards GameStop. It's just because of the way that I trade, primarily with
873.50s:  options. Now the GameStop covered Strangle that I run. I'm actually using that way more
880.46s:  as hopefully a learning point for you all to show you how you can apply something like a
887.18s:  covered Strangle basic option strategies in something like GameStop for a lot of people who
893.90s:  maintain GameStop holdings. Because that is the reality. The vast majority of people I feel
898.70s:  that tune into the live streams are likely people that are primarily GameStop holders versus
906.38s:  traders, like more so with what I represent. So yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.
912.14s:  Jesse says, you make good points. I wish the CEO was more forthcoming. It's been a little exhausting
916.78s:  not going to lie. I actually fully understand that. His approach has been eye opening to me,
925.10s:  to be completely honest in a lot of different ways. The reason why I say that is because
930.78s:  part of me thinks what he's doing is very strategic in nature. So I respect it from that lens.
939.10s:  However, the other part of me does believe in order to inspire confidence from people,
947.74s:  you have to key them in a bit. And this is why normally when you see other companies going
954.38s:  through their earnings releases, there are these giant earnings presentations, there's forecasts,
960.06s:  there's expectations for the next quarter, literally for the entire next year.
965.18s:  There's some analysis shared on the context of like what's the current trade, what's the current
970.30s:  market landscape, the economic landscape as it pertains to the business. And GameStop, you really
975.26s:  don't see any of that. Now, I think part of it is wise to keep the cards semi close to the chest.
983.02s:  But I also don't fully buy that. And it's because there's nothing like super secret that GameStop's
990.54s:  working on that all of these other companies aren't working on tangentially or similarly related
996.06s:  endeavors that are still able to talk about some of these things. So that part I actually don't
1002.30s:  understand why they manage it that way. Actually, I'm really curious. Let me see if I want to know
1009.90s:  of ChatGPT as a perspective of some sort on this. Because let me tell you what the question is,
1018.46s:  we're going to ask, okay. So we want to ask why does Ryan Cohen and GameStop refer to
1035.74s:  minimize shareholder communications during things like earnings releases, where other companies
1053.82s:  share analysis, future expectations, broad plans, etc. I want to know, like ChatGPT says,
1065.42s:  might have an angle that we're not considering.
1071.58s:  Ryan Cohen and GameStop have adapted a low communication strategy, particularly in earnings calls.
1078.30s:  The reasoning behind this approach appears to be deliberate and aligns with Cohen's broader philosophy.
1083.98s:  Strategic reasons for limited communication. Avoid overpromising and legal risks, letting execution
1089.82s:  speak instead of words. Hedge against market manipulation, which that I do believe,
1097.26s:  differentiation from Wall Street norms. This is the main thing I actually think of.
1103.02s:  Is the fact that Cohen is really known for taking a slightly offbeat approach to markets,
1110.14s:  to being a business owner, to being a CEO. And that's actually what I would consider to be a
1117.42s:  larger function. He's just doing shit different. That's part of what I think he does.
1124.86s:  As he says, I'm hoping this Q4 is different than in that regard. Seems like there's going to be
1129.58s:  some sort of reveal of an investment in more info on the new PSA trading cards.
1136.46s:  I used to feel the same as you there, but I have to be honest, I don't feel that way personally.
1144.06s:  I would not be surprised at all if during this earnings release, there's not a call.
1149.82s:  And it's just the filing of the forms.
1156.06s:  That wouldn't surprise me in the least. And the reason being is because
1162.94s:  if there's some sort of news with respect to an investment,
1169.98s:  more often than not, we'll see artifacts of it.
1173.74s:  Now, that doesn't mean it couldn't be the case, definitely could, but typically speaking,
1181.98s:  when there's some sort of larger scale investment potential, normally you see it start to bleed out
1189.74s:  little areas where information finds its way out and gets baked into things like the options
1195.10s:  markets. You typically can see small artifacts of it. And sometimes you don't know what the artifact
1200.54s:  is as you're looking at it happening, meaning it could be the specific open interest or volume
1205.02s:  build out of a specific option that's anomalous. So we don't always know exactly why,
1211.18s:  but we definitely can typically see something at least that then would confirm
1217.02s:  the information in the future. But yeah, it would be really interesting.
1222.06s:  Jesse says, shout out to you, Eric, by the way, you turn me on the chat GPT to help in trading.
1226.38s:  And it's been great. Yeah, it's, I actually am, I got a bunch of emails from the last news
1231.26s:  letter I sent out last week that talked a little bit about using chat GPT or just AI to help.
1237.26s:  And one of my goals for a future video, hopefully soon, is to talk about how to use AI to help
1248.14s:  with your just overall trading approach. Because I feel like
1251.90s:  I cannot tell you how much I wish I had AI and even large language models when I was learning to trade.
1261.34s:  And the fact that people now have that available to them is such an unbelievable resource,
1271.26s:  like literally unbelievable resource that unfortunately a lot of newer people don't know like
1278.30s:  how to take advantage of it. But that's exactly why I want to make a video on it at some point.
1282.54s:  I think it'll be useful. Yeah. Alberto says, wait, there's a newsletter. Yeah, Doug,
1289.82s:  if you look at any of the video descriptions for any of my videos, there's a link to it.
1295.26s:  But it comes out every Sunday, I've done the newsletter for like three years now.
1300.78s:  It's completely open to everybody.
1304.54s:  Bossy says, I feel like Grock has taken the lead over chat GPT. I only use GPT. I don't think so.
1309.98s:  I think that they're all so similar right now that there isn't really a large differentiator.
1315.18s:  I pay for a few of them because I like to be able to test different ideas and see how they behave
1321.58s:  differently. I think it also depends on the tasks that you're trying to do. That's a big differentiator.
1330.22s:  But for example, recently both perplexity and chat GPT have launched like deeper research
1336.70s:  and chat GPT just launched 4.5, which is good for reasoning and deeper thoughts.
1344.54s:  I think that they're all very useful in different ways, but I think that broadly,
1351.02s:  they're all super similar right now. I really don't see huge differences between them.
1357.10s:  For example, if I'm generally searching things, I have a preference for perplexity because I think
1362.38s:  it does a better job more quickly going through different sources and citing them. But chat GPT
1369.50s:  is now become equally as effective as that versus just making shit up like it did in the beginning.
1374.06s:  So yeah.
1376.70s:  Dylan says, if it was someone else doing this live video now, same content, same words,
1382.14s:  I wouldn't watch your delivery as humble. And I think you're an incredible watch. Thank you for your
1386.22s:  time. I'm really glad to hear that. It makes me sad that the same words essentially wouldn't
1391.50s:  carry weight because then it means that the words don't mean much, but I appreciate the sentiment
1397.42s:  very much. I think what I try to do with stuff like this specifically as well is I try to make
1404.30s:  sure that traders are able to identify like the opportunity that you have in front of you.
1409.74s:  And that comes with experience, right? So it's where we can kind of blend both of our worlds where
1418.54s:  hopefully I can lend some of my 18 years of trading experience to help you, meaning the you
1428.78s:  identify different ways to do things, different ways of thinking and different paths you can take
1434.78s:  in order to create success in markets because markets are challenging. They are entirely manageable.
1446.54s:  It's that the overwhelming majority of people start from the entirely wrong approach,
1452.14s:  unfortunately. And that's just kind of how it is. Like if again, as I always say, like if you just
1457.50s:  go on YouTube, let me grab an inc- I always use an incognito window for this because I don't like any
1462.54s:  of my search history on anything to skew the results. But if I just like type in the word trading,
1468.78s:  it's typically absolutely, absolutely trash like this. If I just type in the word trading,
1477.18s:  the first sponsored link, and I don't know this person from a hole in the wall,
1481.82s:  but apparently they're talking about making $2,000 per day with an AI bot, right? Like
1490.30s:  and the people that would believe this and click this are the exact people that don't have the
1496.86s:  money to waste on this bullshit. And that bothers me. But this is the really the reality of what most
1505.58s:  people walk into which kind of sucks. And chat GPT and AI can help with all of this.
1513.98s:  Day trading for beginners, the complete beginners course, and then we have a portfolio that is
1521.26s:  up $735,000. Yep. I'm sure dog. I'm so sure. Now let's get into GameStop. What we're all here for.
1537.42s:  This last week I thought was interesting in the sense that we've defined a channel. And I'm
1544.30s:  actually really unpleased to see this consolidation and starting to break us out of this broader
1554.62s:  channel because this broader channel has been kind of brutal. This steep drop consolidation,
1561.02s:  steep drop, small rebound consolidation, not a comparatively super steep drop, but still a big drop
1568.14s:  right from 27 down to 24. That's a big move, right? For doesn't look big on the chart, but that's
1576.54s:  simply because of the scale of the moves that GameStop has. Now it's been trending sideways
1584.06s:  unfortunately. I don't love this slight negative drift. And it's a little hard to see, but it's
1589.98s:  there. So if we zoom in a little bit more and we take a look just at the bottoms of these candles,
1596.46s:  there's a slight drift down across. So that means that there's still an element of a little bit more
1606.30s:  weakness, but it does look like the market overall at least has a degree of consensus on near-term
1615.58s:  price and value of GameStop. Because if I'm not mistaken, I think the intrinsic value just cash
1620.30s:  assets for GameStop writ large is like 12 or 13 bucks or something like that. So it's not like
1626.06s:  it's trading at any sort of meaningful premium over its intrinsic value. I think we have to keep
1638.06s:  a really close eye on this though. And that's because one, if you've watched my other streams,
1647.26s:  you know that I'm pretty quick to talk about the difference, at least in my perception,
1653.18s:  of market manipulation versus general market activity. And I do not subscribe to the broad view
1662.14s:  of everything is fake, nothing is real. The game's completely rigged against you. I just don't
1667.82s:  believe that. I do believe that there are absolutely demonstrable instances of manipulation. We can see
1675.98s:  it in a lot of different ways, especially when we're looking at something like GameStop. The fact
1682.06s:  that we closed at 24 at 24 even on Friday. I am not in the camp where everybody says,
1694.38s:  each and every week, oh wow, you know, GameStop closed at blank right below this next price level.
1702.78s:  Obviously it's the market makers suppressing the price, right? Because like no matter what week
1707.58s:  we're in, GameStop's always going to close below some sort of level just like any other stock.
1713.50s:  So I think it starts to become disingenuous when we always say that.
1717.42s:  This Friday though, real fucking interesting, real interesting. That's a very inside day on a
1727.58s:  gap down on a broader period where the average daily range is significant. And right on the nose,
1742.70s:  open and close. I don't think so. I just don't fucking think so. I absolutely would postulate that
1753.82s:  that's probably a pretty clean example of market makers trying to make a few extra box. That's
1761.66s:  exactly what I think that is. Now I can't prove it. And I will always highlight those things to you,
1768.30s:  the difference between my opinion, which I really do try to keep a minimum for you. And it goes
1773.42s:  back to the general content creation space. I think most content creators are overly eager to share
1779.42s:  their opinions. And I honestly prefer to just try to share information and allow you to arrive at
1786.38s:  your own opinion, right? Like fuck my opinion who cares about my opinion. But you should be able to
1792.14s:  look at information and objectively arrive at what you think is happening based on the information
1800.38s:  because thankfully, whether you believe in God, the flying spaghetti monster or the south park
1808.62s:  comical version of, you know, just monkeys having butt sex with one another that eventually
1814.14s:  led to human beings, you have a brain that allows you to synthesize information and come to conclusions.
1820.86s:  So let's take a look and let's get that brain work in, shall we? If we take a look at GameStop,
1829.42s:  by the way, shout out to that tie in with GameStop, Mr. Garrison. I don't know if you remember the scene
1837.10s:  I'm talking about where he's really upset about having to teach evolution. I don't know if they're
1843.74s:  going to cut the stream off for watching this, but it's worth it. Now that I'm citing it, what do
1849.98s:  I type in Mr. Garrison?
1856.14s:  Funny enough, as soon as I type in Mr. Garrison, the first thing that pops up is evolution.
1864.14s:  All right. Let me turn on the sound for you. This will probably get me completely demonetized for
1871.58s:  everything, but I don't make any money off this anyways. All right, kids, it is now my job to teach
1877.02s:  you the theory of evolution. Oh boy. Now I for one think that evolution is a bunch of bull crap,
1885.34s:  but I've been told I have to teach it anyway. Love a good teacher that really is there for the
1892.54s:  material and the kids. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this.
1898.38s:  In the beginning, we were all fish, okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day,
1903.74s:  a couple of fish had a retard baby and the retard baby was different, so he got to live.
1909.58s:  So retard fish goes on to make more retard babies. And then one day a retard baby fish crawled
1915.98s:  out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and
1922.54s:  made this. And so on and so forth. I love this clip so much. So you might not be as tickled with
1932.14s:  that inclusion, but I'm very pleased with it personally. Okay. Now we can take a look at games.
1942.86s:  I love that episode so much. Let's see if it has historic
1949.26s:  gags. And I think it might, I don't know if this one has Max Payne. I think this one has Max Payne.
1964.78s:  I think there's literally a website that does paint for game stuff. There's got to that.
1968.54s:  This one. I don't know if this does like historic Max Payne.
1987.66s:  I do know bar chart does it. Let's see what Max.
1992.70s:  So for those unfamiliar with the concept of Max Payne, the idea is market makers. I have a video
2000.46s:  on it. I'll throw it in the chat for you guys. But the concept behind Max Payne is that
2011.18s:  the market makers are incentivized to try and cause an expiration that yields Max Payne.
2021.10s:  And Max Payne is where the largest number of options would expire worthless, which is easier
2025.66s:  for them on the market, making side of things to manage. Now again, Max Payne is not the
2031.66s:  woe of every down move that you see in the market. And then another really, really, really common
2037.90s:  misconception is not understanding that Max Payne moves. So as options are traded, Max Payne will move.
2048.30s:  So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in certain circumstances, not always.
2053.34s:  If there's a really big build out of options, that happens to be super far away from Max Payne.
2059.18s:  And it just is what it is. Then there can be a big variance between them. But like for example,
2065.74s:  this doesn't let me go back in time. But if you take a look at just overall Max Payne, you can see
2072.94s:  between calls and puts here. But you can see where Max Payne is for next week, 60TE, right now it's
2080.22s:  25. If you monitor this throughout the week, it's going to move. So it's an important note.
2087.10s:  Let's see if this one lets us go back in time. This is for next week.
2094.06s:  I'm so surprised that these don't track historic. That's a little, I don't know what Max Payne was.
2104.30s:  Do any of you guys know what Max Payne was for yesterday?
2107.58s:  I'm really surprised that none of these have any sort of historic way to go back and look at what it was.
2118.06s:  BDOS says 25. Yeah, that's actually a great example.
2125.82s:  The fact that Max Payne is all the way up at 25 and it closed at 24, it's not even closed to it.
2132.78s:  But obviously the market makers, I think, still had a vested interest in the fight of trying to get it
2139.10s:  to, they would have preferred to be at 2399. But the fact that it was at 24 would lead me to believe
2147.34s:  that there was resistance. So any questions on where GameStop sits today, anything that we should look
2156.22s:  at in particular, do you think, or are you guys ready to go through the D.E. library and continue
2161.98s:  down the path? There's two things I want to look at. Oh, yeah, I forgot. I told you I would go
2165.82s:  through the coverage triangle. SPNR will says chart exchange says 24.50. Was that for yesterday or
2172.22s:  is that for next week? Let's take a look at the coverage triangle really fast.
2188.54s:  I'll get down here for GameStop. So this is what the position sits at today. And again,
2193.58s:  this is like the model position that I share with you all to use as an example.
2199.58s:  The last couple trades that were made were on the 4th of March. And I think I covered this in
2205.98s:  the video from last week. So I won't spend a lot of time on it. The couple things to keep in mind.
2212.14s:  First, you can see that the puts that came down here on that originally were sold on 30 Jan,
2222.94s:  this line item. The puts came down at a small loss. You could consider this a role or you could
2229.66s:  consider it whatever you want. But effectively, what I wanted to do here was take these puts down
2238.54s:  mostly because they were starting to be challenged. And you can see what the strike price was for
2244.70s:  them. So the strike price was 25. And all I did was take those puts in. And I sold them originally
2254.86s:  for 142 took them in for 185. So that net's a $205 loss. And then I sold the 23s collecting 203,
2262.22s:  which is still even a credit over this, although it doesn't need to be. And this is the new
2267.42s:  basis for the short puts. These are out in 17 April. And I'll show you why I do it this way.
2273.58s:  I need to move this down and this down to show you the example.
2290.78s:  So what I'm doing is I'm just kind of throwing up. Well, it's frozen. So I'm doing it. There it goes.
2296.86s:  So I'm just going to throw in the strikes. And so we went from 25, 23. And the reason why I'm doing this
2320.94s:  is because there's an important point that I want you to be able to visualize. Again,
2326.78s:  if you're to use anything like this or use this for inspiration in your management of stuff,
2332.70s:  which I obviously don't recommend. I am just an online dude. You should do whatever is right for you.
2339.74s:  But I want to give you some thought where to work off of. So if we take a look at the
2350.94s:  the basis change. Y'all this keeps freezing. It's driving me crazy.
2360.30s:  Effectively, what we're doing is we're moving the two points between these two. And this will show us
2366.62s:  like what the percent change is. And there's a more important point to this, which is this.
2381.58s:  The cash secured put change is the total amount of money. It's going to take us to cash secure
2391.34s:  the new position versus the old position. So the way that we would do the math for something like
2396.86s:  this, which you can track for yourself, we effectively would take the new strike, whatever that is,
2405.02s:  multiply that by the size, meaning how many contracts multiply that by 100.
2412.46s:  That's the starting point. So in this case, it's a five lot here.
2425.18s:  Close that off. And then we would subtract
2428.78s:  this times the trade size times 100.
2446.38s:  It's freezing again. That's why it's taking its time.
2449.90s:  Where do we miss? That's there.
2461.90s:  I see we need one more. There we go. And this one is also should be a five lot.
2479.42s:  So here's what happens. If we take a look at the amount to cash secured this first position,
2497.10s:  it equals this times this times 100. So this requires $12,500.
2509.10s:  It requires to cash secure this position. And then if we take a look at what it costs to cash secure this position,
2517.58s:  it's this times this times 100. So I'm just showing you the individual line items.
2541.34s:  Obviously we already have the summation down here. Right? Like I want the reason why I break it
2546.62s:  down this way is like my intention is for you to understand. It's not just for you to like
2550.78s:  see what it is. I want you to understand what it is, why the numbers are, what they are.
2556.62s:  The main reason for that in case you don't know is because the only way to develop confidence,
2566.46s:  really, in anything that you're doing is to have an understanding of the sources of things.
2572.78s:  You can't really fake confidence. Confidence comes from again, understanding what you're looking at
2579.34s:  and understanding how things work. So this is exactly why the adjustment was made. It's not just so that,
2588.86s:  oh, I'm concerned about being assigned on the on GameStop at 25 or 23 or whatever. It's not just
2597.66s:  because of that. It's because by moving this strike, two points, I decrease the amount that I
2608.14s:  have to have in order to cash secure the position by $1,000. That is not a ton of money,
2616.14s:  but relative to the portfolio value of 25k, that's actually not an inconsequential amount of money.
2628.54s:  It's like 4%. So by adjusting things this way, it gives me an ability to move the basis around
2642.22s:  so that as GameStop is going down, I can take in shares when I'm ready at an improved
2652.38s:  basis that makes sense for the broader portfolio. Now, realistically, that could have been at 25,
2658.06s:  because my current basis is at 28.21. No problem taking in the shares at 25.
2664.06s:  However, if you take a look at how much is currently utilized, we absolutely have this space
2671.74s:  to take those shares on via assignment if we were so inclined. But I want to wait and see
2677.42s:  where GameStop levels off. And then I can choose either to allow puts to be assigned or just to
2685.34s:  continue to roll them until they're profitable to where I want them to be and just buy the shares
2688.94s:  out right. Either of those scenarios are completely fine. Dylan says, great thought about the
2694.62s:  adjustment down per assignment being at the lower basis. Thank you for the thought, of course. Yeah,
2699.50s:  that's again, but mine, if you have any questions on what I'm talking about, please ask me,
2703.98s:  because that's genuinely the whole purpose of me running this strategy in this stock is because
2711.90s:  I want to help you learn how this can be used if it's something that fits or even tangentially.
2721.18s:  It's what you're doing more more broadly. Now, one thing to note on the short call side of things,
2727.82s:  and this is absolutely worth noting. First thing, you can see that the short calls have actually
2732.38s:  been providing a bit of relief for the broader trade. There's $471 made on the short calls,
2740.70s:  which again, it's not a lot of money. But if you take this total short call collection
2748.62s:  by the total basis that we have, the stock is been objectively going down. And on the
2757.34s:  invested capital that's in GameStop right now, these have made 1.9% return. Again, that's not like,
2764.38s:  oh, wow, making huge bank here, obviously not. But this is doing much better than if I'm just
2774.30s:  holding the underlying in that scenario. This is absolutely crushing it on a comparative basis.
2783.82s:  And it's because of these small little efficiencies we gain from the satellite positions via
2789.34s:  the options. But right now, the danger I have is on this side, which you need to see.
2798.54s:  And this gets into a much more advanced method of trading, which is, if you take a look at the
2806.70s:  strike price relative to my basis for the short call. My basis is 2821. The strike price as things
2816.38s:  sit right now is at just 21. So the problem is if I get assigned, I'm essentially taking a $7
2826.62s:  loss, which is pretty much catastrophic. That would be really, really bad. So this short call that I
2836.06s:  have on is actually going to have to be very actively monitored and managed. The way that I do this
2842.94s:  is simple. I set up, typically, a bunch of different alerts. And I also don't think it's at 21,
2851.42s:  one sec. Let me actually figure out where it is because I wouldn't have sold it below current price
2855.18s:  either. That's obviously a typo. Give me one sec. But I do know it's, I'm, I don't even know if
2862.94s:  it's below basis, because I think I might have moved it. One second, we will get to the bottom
2869.10s:  of said, I've said position, I'm just logging into the thinkorswim mobile or the web browser.
2893.34s:  What is happening?
2906.54s:  Like not loading for some reason, I don't know why. Let me take a look at one other thing really
2913.10s:  for. I tried looking at it on the phone, but it's also down there might be something with thinkorswim.
2922.54s:  This also happened yesterday where, yeah, it's definitely something with thinkorswim.
2932.38s:  Yeah, okay, so it says we'll be conducting routine maintenance on Saturday. So that's exactly
2936.38s:  what it is. Anyways, I can figure out the position through here. So give me one sec.
2939.98s:  I'll let you know what it actually is.
2953.02s:  It's the 31s. Uh-huh. That finger slip.
2960.86s:  I was gonna say, because that seems much lower than what I would have gone. Okay, that makes
2966.06s:  way more sense. Okay. So back to this though, to walk you through,
2980.62s:  this should be 31. Going off of that example though, just playing if I had to sell them below my
2989.02s:  basis, which I do. As you could tell, it didn't shock me. The only thing that shocked me is that
2993.98s:  with the stock at 24, I wouldn't have gone like $3 in the money. That doesn't really make sense.
3000.54s:  And what I'm doing here is keeping a really light number of short calls, because again,
3009.58s:  we never know when GameStop is gonna pop. And I probably will scale this up. Now that GameStop
3016.70s:  is kind of stabilizing. And I'll probably sell two so that I have two short calls against the
3023.02s:  250 shares. And this is what the intention of managing those short calls if they fell on the money.
3029.58s:  But except in the fact that if there is a squeeze of some sort, there's a really good chance
3033.82s:  that they would get assigned early and take the shares, which is okay. That generally would still be
3040.22s:  a fairly profitable position for me. So that's the position as it sits. This number is messed up.
3048.06s:  It's obviously pulling it from a random spot. I don't know where it's pulling it from.
3054.30s:  The reason why all this stuff gets messed up is because when I take this from my actual
3061.34s:  trade log, it messes up where everything is getting generated. What does this say? B215,
3069.98s:  cracked, 17, which is cracked, 18. Yeah, because what I can tell you is I do not have a dividend
3077.82s:  of $12,000. It would be nice. That's more correct. It was pulling all of this stuff.
3084.30s:  So anyways, that is the covered, stringled trade as it sits right now in GameStop.
3090.70s:  We are 74% utilized. So about 15% left to go. We need $18,500 to cash secure everything I have out
3099.66s:  as it sits. That includes cash secured puts and the long equity. The majority of the position right
3107.18s:  now for the cash secured element is from the cash secured put side of things. The primary reason
3117.74s:  for that realistically is because it's going down. So when the stock is going down like this,
3122.94s:  I don't want to hold the equity. It's because it's going the wrong way. Now for GameStop, I also,
3130.38s:  and generally the coverage triangle, I don't like unwinding the equity. If it's going down,
3135.98s:  the times I'll do that is if I'm trading the coverage triangle on a leveraged ETF, if you're
3140.30s:  following the other stuff I do, you will have seen me do that in T-Triple Cues, but that's because
3144.94s:  it's three times leveraged. It's a completely different thing. But what I will do is scale out of
3149.82s:  the trade, which is exactly what I did here. Then I started nibbling with some really small
3154.62s:  positions. That's where that 50 share came from as we were coming down to dollar cost average in.
3162.46s:  That's where things sit. If you have any questions on this, let me know. Otherwise,
3165.98s:  let's get into the DD library. Before the DD library, I want to show you this study so that you
3173.82s:  can look it up at your leisure. Really, whenever you have a little time to read through this stuff,
3182.62s:  I think it's useful in understanding the broader market.
3190.46s:  This not only talks about GameStop, but it talks about the broader condition of things like
3199.42s:  seller boxing, which I believe is highly relevant to GameStop. I think, as most people probably
3209.42s:  guess, I think that that's one of the dominant things that we started seeing in the beginning
3216.22s:  of why GameStop was being targeted the way it was. I definitely think that there's a pretty
3224.62s:  important element of GameStop in here, but it talks about these other effects as well more broadly.
3232.30s:  And I think it's useful because one of the things to keep in mind as a trader is
3242.46s:  you can trade this same effect in other tickers. It's not just GameStop that demonstrates
3250.70s:  short squeezes, gamma squeezes, and things like that that are heavily, heavily monetizable.
3256.06s:  So that's really what this study is about. It's pretty interesting. It's honestly not the most
3261.26s:  well done that I've seen, but it does a good job tying together some of the themes that you're
3267.02s:  used to seeing in terms of excessive short interest in terms of seeing synthetic locates and
3275.42s:  deliveries even via deep in the money long calls, those kinds of things. So I think it's probably
3285.02s:  checking out. But we left off on my boy Dave Lauer. And this is actually funny because I did a podcast
3293.34s:  with Dave Lauer and Irvin Finance. Those are, I actually invested in them a while ago when they were
3302.54s:  even before they came on like the major funding platforms from a just angel investing perspective.
3310.78s:  Because I like Dave a lot. I think it's cool. And I think the platform is neat. The mission of the
3315.50s:  platform is also very cool to kind of connect traders together and then also to connect companies
3321.82s:  with their shareholders directly. This attacks a big factor that you've seen before
3328.86s:  and talked about by like Dr. Susan Trimbath who's saying that during some of these proxy meetings
3334.62s:  and whatnot, we're getting guidance from more shareholders than we have, which is obviously
3342.38s:  an utter joke. But the Irvin is helping with that. Let me pop the door for a real fast.
3349.34s:  So let's see what our boy Dave has. Okay, cool. Now one of the things is I'm going to read this one
3370.46s:  pretty carefully because Dave is well researched and he's highly knowledgeable. So I'm actually
3378.46s:  pretty interested in what he has to say here. Let's see.
3387.18s:  Recently, and since I've joined the subreddit, there have been a ton of questions
3390.38s:  around the role that dark pools play in US equity market structure. This is awesome.
3394.62s:  Want to put together a post to clarify some things about how they operate, what they do and what
3398.14s:  they cannot do. This is super important because you've also heard me talk about this a lot. And I
3403.82s:  noticed that this misunderstanding absolutely perpetuates where people broadly do not follow
3413.58s:  why and how these things work, which is actually quite, quite important. So let's dig in and see what's
3423.02s:  up. I'm texting Mel real quick to see what time she's going to be back because if she's not going
3427.10s:  to be back for a little bit, I'm going to have to pop off for a second just to feed Thor. But then we'll
3432.38s:  will keep the push in. But what time we at 52 we still got some
3437.58s:  he can wait unless you guys don't want Thor to wait to eat. But I say he can wait. He's fine.
3443.66s:  He's got plenty of bad on him. Okay. Dark pools were created as part of regulation,
3451.42s:  ATS, the alternative trading system in 98. Originally, they were predominantly ECNs,
3457.26s:  electronic crossing networks, including the ones you're familiar with today as exchanges,
3461.98s:  ARCA, direct edge. Ultimately though, most dark pools after Rage and MS was implemented in
3468.14s:  07 were either broker owned UBS, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, or independent block
3475.18s:  trading facilities such as Liquidnet. Note that I'm not discussing OTC over the counter trading.
3480.70s:  And obviously I am reading from Dave Lauer's perspective here, which is what Citadel in virtue,
3486.62s:  virtue due to internalize retail trades. This distinction massively important to understand
3496.22s:  at the highest level. OTC and internalization of orders is very different than this. Let's continue.
3505.42s:  To understand dark pools, what makes them different from exchanges need to understand regulatory
3509.50s:  nuances and market data characteristics. It's easier to get approval for a dark pool regulated
3514.94s:  by Fennred than an exchange regulated by SEC comparatively. This is on purpose. The ATS is
3520.70s:  there's supposed to be a way to foster competition and innovation, unfortunately, that is resulted in
3525.58s:  40 plus dark pools and extreme off exchange fragmentation. And this is also why for the first time
3531.42s:  in a long time, you actually see off exchange volume broadly exceeding on exchange volume.
3538.22s:  That's crazy. Anyways, most dark pools are ostensibly to allow institutional asset managers to
3544.30s:  post large orders that they do not want to be visible on in exchange. There are different reasons
3550.78s:  why they do not want these orders to be visible on exchange. And they're not all bad.
3557.10s:  One of the reasons is because if I am a pension fund, big mutual fund, whatever,
3563.26s:  and I want to unwind or let's say I want to buy 10 million dollars of Apple stock from UBS or
3572.54s:  somebody else. Well, in order for that transaction to happen, UBS has to first sell the shares,
3582.06s:  which causes tanking, which causes everybody to start losing their minds because it's tanking
3588.86s:  before I can go in and buy the shares. So it actually massive, massively, broadly led to a big issue
3601.34s:  where it's not possible for these two entities to directly correlate and to essentially say,
3607.34s:  yo, I want to take this volume and just essentially facilitate a direct transfer.
3613.34s:  The other thing is front running because as soon as any traders, high frequency traders,
3619.18s:  Algo traders, even well structured retail traders, we'll see that kind of order flow and immediately
3626.54s:  start trying to participate and pick it off. So dark pools, they, they're really not all evil and
3633.50s:  not all bad, although the way that they're used now, unfortunately, is generally not ideal.
3641.18s:  Moses says, hello, Eric, I sold puts on TQ strikes 83 78, both got a sign draw down his
3646.62s:  killin' me because even if I sell calls to market is farling, falling harder, my cost basis
3651.66s:  sits at 78 any advice. A bunch of stuff. I, if you don't mind, I want to keep it focused on
3658.46s:  game stop for now. And then after we get through this, if you remind me of your question at the end,
3662.94s:  happy to talk about it with you. Jerry says, I can't believe your boy PB got caught being a private
3670.14s:  equity plant, your boy Tom Sawsnaf from Motley Fool, still shorting Jimmy. I didn't know that
3677.34s:  about PB in terms of being a private equity plant, not sure what that is to be honest. And Tom Sawsnaf,
3685.02s:  I don't know the Motley Fool comment there. Tom Sawsnaf is from Tasty, they have like their own,
3692.22s:  their own brokerage. So what do you mean from Motley Fool? Oh, maybe you're using it as like a
3698.86s:  joke saying like Motley Fool. I don't know because in case you don't know, Motley Fool is actually a
3707.50s:  firm. They do like research. I don't know if you know that. But Tom's not part of Motley Fool, at least as far as I know.
3720.30s:  These guys. Are you confusing people? Are you confusing Tom Sawsnaf with Tom Gardner?
3731.82s:  Is that it?
3738.14s:  Yeah.
3744.14s:  Age says the PB thing is some GME ex account talking shit slash rage baiting. Oh, so it's not.
3750.94s:  I was even say I was just texting with them the other day. I don't know him or really like the
3756.78s:  the main people that I know well in like the you know, retail, content, trading, space.
3765.90s:  I mean, Matt Caruso, I know him probably the best because I've talked to him for a long time.
3771.50s:  And then I know Tom pretty well now. People like that, you and Sinclair, I know quite well. He's
3777.50s:  going to be on the podcast again soon. But PB, I met him pretty recently. But we do talk, but he never
3783.18s:  mentioned anything like that. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure the details on it. If you have what the
3789.50s:  post is or whatever, I'm happy to take a look at it. Okay. So here it says this is the fundamental
3797.58s:  difference between dark pools and exchanges. No orders are visible on dark pools. Hence dark where
3803.90s:  you have some where you can have visible orders on exchanges. Now you can also have hidden orders
3810.70s:  on exchanges. Absolutely iceberg orders and things like that. And there's nothing preventing
3815.66s:  in ATS from posting quotes. Bloomberg used to do this all the time. However, generally speaking
3822.38s:  today, there aren't dark pools that show any posted orders. So what about the trades? All trades
3830.78s:  in the national market system have to be printed to a sip feed. It does not matter where they happen.
3837.50s:  This is super important. And all trades during regular hours 0 9 30 to 1600. That's eastern time.
3845.18s:  Must be within the N BB. Oh, these are hard and fast rules cannot be violated. All trades on
3853.02s:  exchanges are reported to the regular sip, which is essentially like the the consolidated tape.
3859.98s:  That's orders that go through the dark pool are still going to hit the consolidated tape.
3867.10s:  All trades, all trades that happen off exchange ATS or OTC are reported to the trade reporting
3873.90s:  facility TRF run by NYC NASDAQ or FINRA. All trades have to be reported to the TRF within 10 seconds.
3880.94s:  So this is the consolidated tape element of being executed. Though the reality is that they're
3886.14s:  reported nearly instantaneously. So the delay is much less than that.
3892.54s:  This gives you a chart of the reporting requirements and timelines. There's a question on Fox
3899.66s:  and Twitter yesterday. Can hedge funds go short in dark pools and not need to report it?
3905.10s:  I did not mean to be flippant in my tweet about how it's nonsensical, but I had a long day,
3909.90s:  no brain power left. But such a statement is nonsensical. It's not how dark pools work. Yeah.
3915.10s:  So I don't know the tweet that Dave's referring to, but that's honestly just a function of
3921.90s:  when you do this a lot, I noticed myself not always always having the the major patience that I
3929.42s:  would want to have with people. But you do start to answer a lot of a lot of the same things over
3935.66s:  and over again. And Dave is a great guy. And I think he does his best as well. But we're all human,
3941.18s:  right? It's kind of like like that question stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of dark pools.
3949.50s:  And sometimes when people again, I don't know this instance, but for context, sometimes when
3954.62s:  people postulate things, they postulate it in the context of like, this is what's happening versus
3961.66s:  asking like, is this what's happening? So what I mean by that is again, I don't know the post
3966.86s:  he's referring to, but a lot of times people will say things like hedge funds, hedge funds can go
3973.02s:  short in dark pools and they don't need to report it, right? They can say it like that. It doesn't
3977.82s:  sound like that's what happened here. But anyways, I just identify with Dave here and Dave is such a
3983.50s:  nice guy that I want to defend him a little bit because I don't think, well, at least I hope people
3989.42s:  don't think he's flipping. He's definitely not. There is practically no difference at all between
3994.86s:  trades executed on exchange or off exchange, especially when you're talking about reporting,
4000.62s:  short positions or short sale marking. The rules are identical regardless. Short sale marking is
4006.78s:  not dependent on whether you trade on or off exchange, not trying to make a statement as to whether
4011.50s:  firms are doing it adequately or accurately, which is exactly correct. There's a difference in reporting
4016.30s:  which we do know that a lot of places do not report effectively. And a lot of places just kind of
4024.46s:  willingly accept the penalty for not reporting effectively. I also have never heard of this idea that
4033.18s:  firms will choose whether to execute on or off exchange based on where they want buying
4039.10s:  pressure or selling pressure to show up. Every sophisticated trading firm out there is watching the
4043.50s:  TRF and categorizes every trade that takes place relative to the MBBO. Every time a trade happens
4048.94s:  at the ask or near it, they characterize that as a buy. Every time happens near a bid,
4053.98s:  characterize it as a sell. You cannot hide what you were doing in dark pools or through OTC
4059.66s:  internalization. It cannot be done. All trades are public and reported within 10 seconds. That's
4063.42s:  correct. Yeah. Here's what I think was trying to be said. If trades are taking place OTC, such as
4068.94s:  orders that are being internalized, this is exactly where things get more interesting. By
4072.70s:  sitting at L over to both of those firms qualifies market makers. Market makers do have an exemption
4079.10s:  for short selling. They are allowed to do so without having to locate the shares first. This gets
4082.78s:  into naked shorting and things like that. I'm just trying to help you understand that dark pools
4087.74s:  are not nefarious and that there's very little difference between dark pools and exchanges from
4091.02s:  trading position marking. Yeah, I agree. Can you use dark pools and off exchange trading to
4096.62s:  artificially hold on the price of a stock? I struggled to see the mechanism by which this can be
4100.94s:  done. Never heard of it other than here. As I've said several times, every trade needs to be reported,
4105.50s:  every single trade that buys GME reported to the tape. There's no hiding that. The only market
4110.70s:  manipulation I've ever studied or measured has been the subject enforcement action by the SEC has
4114.86s:  been on exchanges that is done with layering and spoofing, which is actually a massive problem
4120.30s:  yeah. So I actually think this is good and he does also dive into the fact that and we talked
4130.22s:  about this actually earlier before we even got to this, which is way too much off exchange trading.
4138.70s:  Ben says there are transactions that do not have to be reported to the consolidated tape. It
4143.50s:  depends on the transaction. If an order isn't internalized, it doesn't, but other than that,
4148.54s:  it's going to have to consolidate a tape if it goes through a dark pool. That's that's the whole
4151.82s:  point. So yeah, it depends on your understanding of what other kind of transactions you're talking
4159.50s:  about. But if something is internalized, that's the main issue with internalized orders is that they
4165.50s:  don't hit the consolidated tape. That's the contention. Okay, that was awesome. I actually like that one
4174.54s:  a whole lot. Also just because I like Dave, but okay, let's take a look at one more. I'm going to go
4184.94s:  grab a drink and feed Thor real quick. So it'll probably be like less than two minutes.
4235.50s:  All right. How do we do? Also, Thor is very thankful, by the way, because
4259.58s:  Homi was super hungry. So thank you guys for hanging in there for a second.
4265.98s:  We come back with a coconut pineapple, seltzer water, which is actually quite good.
4272.38s:  H says the PB thing is some GME X account talk. The subject is that PB worked in FinTech
4280.06s:  in post about other topics than GME PB posted a rebuttal to address it. I mean, yeah, I guess I
4286.62s:  don't see any issue with that. I don't understand any issue with like people talking about stuff other
4290.86s:  than GameStop. I don't think, and I also don't think that there's anything wrong with people working
4294.38s:  in industry. Dave Lauer worked in industry. Like, I don't know why people try to use that is like
4302.70s:  ammunition to tear down people that are actually trying to help shed light on the broader thing.
4308.94s:  Funny enough timing that this is the next thing that we pop up is by PB. I feel like
4314.38s:  it would be much smarter for folks to evaluate people based on what they say.
4323.82s:  And like, you can assess if people are genuine or not. Because like, I don't actually get the issue.
4331.82s:  So Jerry, maybe you can help me with that because it sounds like you're one of those people that
4335.18s:  might have an issue with it. And then Jerry says, oh, you're right. Tom Sawznaf, not from Motley Fool,
4340.94s:  but he did short GameStop and is tied to Apex clearing from TD. We all know Apex and TD
4347.02s:  Ameritrade did to GME even worse. I don't know about the context with TD Ameritrade, but he's never
4356.38s:  he's never shorted GameStop. He Tom Sawznaf trades options. He's sold calls on GameStop. He's never
4365.10s:  shorted GameStop. It's different. I'm selling calls in GameStop right now against long shares
4372.46s:  that I have. So again, I'm not sure like what the what the desire is to like, like what's that
4379.98s:  outcome there? Right? Like what's the objective? I don't fully don't fully get it.
4386.06s:  Jerry says Dave Lauer worked for Citadel. Yeah. And that's not the only place he worked at.
4389.90s:  Right? Like Dave Lauer is a really smart dude that has worked out of a lot of very high
4396.70s:  quality top performing financial places. Just like Citadel operating as like a market maker,
4401.82s:  which is the tough the tough gig. Let's see what this is. Major signals flashing code red,
4412.14s:  shadow banking system. So for those that don't know, one of the things I noticed about PB is that
4418.46s:  he's very into liquidity and market provision. So that's what I'm assuming a lot of this is going
4426.06s:  to be about. Does this have a date for all 21? The real issue is much worse. Signs that the entire
4435.98s:  banking system is straining under the weight of massive liquidity injections from the Fed. Okay?
4440.78s:  Yes. Right? Liquidity. So it doesn't surprise me. Reverse repose extremely similar short term
4446.94s:  cash loans. Yep. Yep. Yep. The end results from a RAP is that the MF is able to use its cash under
4455.50s:  yep. Okay. I'm trying to see as many pointed out this many massive figures concerning because
4467.18s:  it's a symptom of serious issue in the market. Oh, I see. I understand his perspective now. I think
4473.50s:  the thing with respect to liquidity, especially during like 2020 and 2021, I think it's a very different
4484.22s:  a very different environment.
4485.90s:  The entire banking system entering a credit contraction. Let's actually see where this sits.
4505.50s:  Let me go to red. Let's go check out our friend.
4509.66s:  Let me sign in. Let's go to our dashboard, shall we?
4520.62s:  Here we go. And then what is this one commercial industrial loans commercial banks? Let's add that one.
4541.58s:  So just so you can see what I'm doing here. And by the way, this is free. Like everybody can open a
4551.18s:  frat account. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to find the same the same metrics he's looking at
4560.06s:  just so that we can see how it's trended over time because it's interesting. So this is commercial
4565.10s:  industrial loans all commercial banks. Let's see. This is the link when see stuff. I've built like
4570.86s:  a bunch of composite stuff to give me a sense of general like market health. But let's add one. Let's add
4584.06s:  a graph. I think this is just freezing there goes. And
4591.34s:  commercial and industrial loans. Let's do five year observation.
4610.22s:  I five years is a little too long to be honest.
4613.02s:  Damn, I wish it would let me do that though. That's okay. We'll do five years. Let's see.
4629.98s:  Yeah, so we can actually see from the lens of what he was talking about is
4637.18s:  he's showing this decline that you see here. But it actually normalized and started expanding again.
4652.46s:  So if we look at this one more specifically, we go back 10 years. I think he had set to max.
4662.14s:  You can actually see it looks completely fine. Here's COVID down to here. And then from that point
4669.50s:  forward, it's actually been expanding again, which this doesn't surprise me right to see the follow
4675.42s:  through from the COVID issue. Stuff like that takes a little bit of time. So yeah, this is
4683.98s:  is this is unsurprising to me broadly.
4691.02s:  CD spreads. What is this commercial? Industrial loans, bank credit continuing to contract. So
4700.22s:  I think that's from the leads and lags of the system. Despite trillions being pumped into the
4706.62s:  economy, the economy is supposedly recovering. What's going on? Yeah, I think I honestly think
4711.34s:  that's just leads and lags of the economic system. It takes time.
4717.98s:  Liabilities and capital liabilities. Let's see how that one is trending.
4725.82s:  And it widget.
4733.82s:  We want to add
4741.10s:  liabilities.
4745.58s:  Capital liabilities. Deposits US Treasury.
4755.50s:  Capital.
4772.30s:  General account Wednesday level. Okay. Let's add this.
4779.18s:  And we will need to have two.
4789.90s:  Two different access.
4795.02s:  Yeah, there we go.
4799.82s:  So right now it's combining the access and we want to.
4805.10s:  Let's find.
4810.38s:  So it's on the left axis. This should be on the right.
4814.62s:  Act. There we go.
4816.54s:  And then this can be a solid line as well.
4827.26s:  And then we'll just make this a different color. So it's easier to see.
4835.42s:  So there's our graph. Let's see.
4841.66s:  Massive cash influx treasury. Yes.
4845.66s:  Government didn't start drawing down. Yes.
4850.94s:  Absolutely. But we can see that again, like even here, it's recovered.
4859.18s:  So I think this is another artifact of just the leads and lags.
4865.10s:  That's mostly what I'm seeing.
4871.02s:  That ownership of treasury bonds, we already know that this is going down.
4877.02s:  Yeah, interesting. I like the piece. Obviously, we have to evaluate the piece relative to the time
4883.18s:  that he was looking at it, which what we're doing now, which is our ability to take a look at
4889.98s:  information that we know and evaluate it as it stands. Obviously, it's different than
4898.62s:  what he was looking at then. So yeah, I definitely think that there's
4907.66s:  something to be said, but I think that the leads and lags are important to consider.
4913.98s:  Cool. All right, gang. Now, there was a couple of things that I said that we would take a look
4924.38s:  at before we wrapped up. So now's the perfect time to let me know what we're supposed to look at
4930.86s:  and to remind me that would be awesome. And then we can take a look at everything together.
4943.10s:  H says same, the whole narrative of rage, anyone on the other side.
4952.54s:  Moises says, can we look at TQs? Yeah, definitely. So talk to me again about TQs, specifically with
4960.30s:  like what? What you're trying to do, because to me, it sounds like you honestly just have a
4969.90s:  position that's gone against you and you're kind of like gridlocked, which is suboptimal. I'm
4976.06s:  going to turn off think or swim because it's going through an update right now. So what I'll do
4982.30s:  is I will grab instead trading view. I'll just let that turn off.
5000.86s:  TQs. So talk to me. What do you struggle with here? What are you trying to do?
5019.26s:  And then once I have a little bit of context, all
5023.10s:  might be able to help you a little bit. We'll see. Kind of depends on what you're hoping for.
5030.78s:  I'm still trying to get this. I'm a little dashboard to look the way I want.
5048.78s:  Nothing? Okay. Well, that's all right.
5054.22s:  In general, I think to even give you like an overview, one of the things to keep an eyeball on
5063.02s:  is, most of the says I was looking at this for long term, but got wrapped up in the big downfalls.
5070.70s:  So then if you're looking at it for the long term, then what's the issue?
5083.82s:  Because it's going down. I mean, you're trading a three times levered ETF. I don't know.
5090.62s:  I'm not really sure what your expectations were, but QQQ hasn't even gone down yet.
5098.86s:  What? Like 539 down to a low of 480. Let's see. 539 down to 480. 539 down to 480.
5112.62s:  It's a 10, so 11% drop. It's not even in a bear market yet. It's definitely crossed into a
5120.14s:  correction. No doubt there. But I get like that's kind of the the confusion, right? It's like,
5130.46s:  I don't fully understand what you expected to happen here, but it sounds like you might have
5135.02s:  gone into this with maybe not doing your research on how the underlying itself might behave,
5143.26s:  and it sounds like that might have touched you down the wrong path. Most of the says it worries me
5149.82s:  that maybe I won't be able to recover when the market turns bullish again. I see. Yeah. So I mean,
5155.50s:  broadly, this just sounds like you got into something that you didn't research. So then in that
5160.86s:  instance, you kind of have to think through what you're comfortable with and what you want to
5165.58s:  happen from here. But that's absolutely the broad context of what this is, right? So then from
5178.22s:  there, it really comes down to how do you choose to proceed from here? Anytime a trader has something
5186.06s:  that they're uncomfortable with or didn't think through, I generally think that flattening and
5193.34s:  moving into something else that you research a little bit more is typically a better choice.
5198.94s:  But I mean, only you can make that decision for yourself, right? It'll have to be
5204.70s:  you analyzing what you think is going to happen. But what I can tell you from
5211.74s:  a broader context, though, for sure, is that what you're seeing right now is this is not bad.
5225.82s:  Like we're not at a point yet where this is a big, massive down move in the market. So if this
5235.74s:  is making you nervous, that's not good because it can get much worse. So one of the things I would
5245.26s:  recommend with anything before you get into it is especially like a leveraged ETF is this here.
5255.10s:  Just zoom out, right? And most of it says I did research, but I'd like some advice on how to
5264.06s:  protect further than just selling calls. There is no protection. You can try to offset some of your
5270.62s:  deltas by buying puts to create a floor to the downside, but that's going to be really expensive.
5278.06s:  The whole nature of the position as it sits is to put on risk and to take risk. So
5286.30s:  if you start putting out, hey, if you start putting on a bunch of long puts, you know, for
5293.90s:  a quote unquote, protection to the downside, then you essentially start effectively undoing the
5298.54s:  risk that you're taking. So it doesn't even make sense to have the position. But it confuses me when
5303.26s:  you say that you did your research, this isn't to get at you. But it's if this is what you consider
5308.86s:  doing research, then I do think that there's a problem here, right? Because if we take a look
5313.90s:  at the move here, from here to here, this represents a 43% decline over 29 trading days
5330.30s:  of 43% decline. And so far, what we're seeing here is a 30% decline.
5343.10s:  So we're not even at anything commensurate with the recent down move, let alone in actually bad
5350.94s:  down move. Because again, these are just tied to corrections. These aren't tied to actual big market
5356.06s:  moves. This is a big market move. And here, T triple Q's dropped 82%. So literally double what
5364.86s:  this is. And this is also one of the downsides of trading three times leverage ETF compared to
5371.18s:  stuff that's like two times leverage is that a three times leverage ETF like this, if you take a look
5375.74s:  at how long it took for this to get back to break even, it's actually kind of crazy. Because if you
5383.26s:  take a look at the highs that it posted here, this was back on 22 November of 21, it literally
5391.58s:  poked its head above it on 16d 24 and then it still hasn't been back to it. So effectively,
5399.18s:  this still has not been back above all time highs in T triple Q's. This is the exact nature of
5406.22s:  trading a leverage ETF. You kind of have to be prepared for the moves. And then you have to have
5414.70s:  a game plan for them like the way that I trade because I'm trading a covered strangle right now
5420.46s:  in T triple Q's. But the way that I manage it is very similar to the way that I manage
5424.86s:  the covered strangle that I explained earlier in GameStop, which is as the underlying is going down,
5431.90s:  I'm unwinding my position slowly into it to capture profit, to lock in profit and to reduce
5439.18s:  downside exposure while simultaneously moving more and more into cash secured puts so that I have
5446.30s:  a floating and adjustable cost basis is when you buy the underlying whatever at whatever price
5453.10s:  your cost basis is now fixed, whatever that's at.
5459.10s:  Moses says how that's funny. Moses says how are you managing your risk on your covered
5463.02s:  strangle strategy? Yeah, no, it's actually a funny right? Because I automatically started going
5468.70s:  into that. But literally what I just told you is exactly how. So what I do is that process.
5474.30s:  So right now as I look at my T triple Q's position that's in the covered strangle,
5480.38s:  I am sitting at 62% total utilization of how much money I've allocated to the position.
5490.78s:  17% of that is in the equity, meaning holding shares outright.
5496.78s:  44% of that 62% is in cash secured puts. And that's to give me the ability to adjust and
5505.74s:  move my basis around because when we're hovering near all time highs, I don't like being highly
5511.02s:  invested, especially in something like a three times leverage ETF because the risk becomes
5519.66s:  increasingly pronounced. So that's exactly how I'm managing it by keeping the account really
5528.14s:  carefully positioned as things sit now. So Moses, for you, I think what would make a lot of
5535.82s:  sense is if you take some time and like carefully think through your opinion of cues,
5542.22s:  T triple Q's, the market is it sits now and then deciding if the position reflects something
5551.74s:  that you're comfortable with what you want and then what makes sense going forward,
5556.38s:  going forward from there. But yeah, definitely wish you the best. The thing to keep in mind is
5562.54s:  that three times leveraged ETFs can be that they can move nasty, right? Like this is literally an
5569.58s:  82% decline and this is during a moderate bear market. If you look at 2022 as a bear market in the
5578.46s:  S&P 500, the market was down 19% in 22. The market was down 19.4%. Like that is a objectively
5588.78s:  light bear market. And this is the move that you saw on cues in T triple Q's. If T triple Q was
5595.98s:  around during like the dot com bubble, the it probably would have gone insolvent.
5604.30s:  The move here is another 73% down move. So I mean, literally the way to look at T triple Q's
5612.78s:  is within the last five years, it's had 270% plus down moves, which is something to keep in mind.
5622.06s:  Coffee Donuts and Homer says sell calls inputs to manage risk, right? Sort of, selling calls doesn't
5627.90s:  really manage your risk. That's a common misconception. I actually don't even view it as really
5632.86s:  offsetting the risk that much because it doesn't like if you're trading covered calls or ratio
5637.34s:  covered calls, the short call element doesn't effectively help us that much. It helps a little bit.
5643.42s:  The risk that you take from the long stock position is much greater than what you offset
5648.62s:  from the short calls because of the uncapped downside versus capped profit potential of the short
5653.98s:  calls. They don't pace one another. And then the short puts is actually increasing the risk
5659.82s:  because if I sell puts, I increase my downside exposure again, unlimited risk technically down to
5665.50s:  zero on the downside. So yeah, the main way you manage risk in something like trading a leveraged
5674.30s:  ETF like this is through sizing. How much do you use of the account? Because again, if I refer
5681.66s:  you back to the position that I have on right now, it's 62% utilized. And I'm 62% utilized with
5691.74s:  T-Triple Q's 30% off of term highs, right? So that goes to show like how lightly I allocate to
5701.50s:  the trade because of this exact thing. I mean, to be honest with you, but my basis is in great right
5708.62s:  now. I'm long 300 shares at 7160. This is in the portfolio that I've been sharing with you guys
5715.98s:  kind of like the example portfolio. So yeah, Ben says 62% not high. If this is the beginning, could
5725.02s:  your puts not all get assigned? And then you don't have any capital left. Hold on, let me reread that.
5729.66s:  Is 62% not high? If this is the beginning, could your puts not all get assigned? And then you
5737.50s:  don't have any capital left. No, the whole point is if the puts got assigned right now, I would
5747.58s:  still have 38% of my capital left, not 62. And or not like the 62 is all in, including the stock
5760.70s:  requirement and then the current cash secured put requirement. And obviously that foregoes the
5765.74s:  entire game of managing the short puts, which is exactly what I'm doing. I just rolled the short
5771.74s:  puts recently last week. I had on the third of March and on the fourth of March, I rolled two
5780.06s:  tranches of short puts. I rolled 78s down to 75 and I rolled 70s down. I took those down for
5789.02s:  a profit. So it's not even a roll. I rolled 70s technically down to 60s. So yeah, if the 62%
5798.54s:  is split right now between cash secured puts and long equity. So but even if like even playing the
5806.70s:  scenario, if I got assigned, I still have 38% of the capital to use. So that's the whole point
5813.74s:  of striking a balance between utilization and allocation. It's literally for that exact reason
5819.82s:  to make sure that the portfolio has a little bit of wiggle room.
5826.46s:  Interesting, interesting question though. I hope that that helps at least a little bit.
5831.18s:  Is there anything else you guys want to hit before I bounce?
5836.22s:  Coffee Donuts says, did you get your trading license? What do you mean by trading license? Do you
5840.30s:  mean like a series certification or do you mean like what does that mean trading license there
5846.38s:  technically isn't a license? There's different certifications depending on what you're trying to do
5853.66s:  like if you go through a series six, series seven, series 63. But those are really for financial
5861.58s:  advisors to be licensed to do different kinds of broader financial activities. So if you mean
5870.70s:  from that sense, no, I don't have any serious license. Because I'm a I'm a fucking degenerate retail
5878.30s:  trader. Don't need anything, which is crazy if you think about it. It's absolutely insane that
5884.38s:  you can effectively do what we do with no no licensing at all. But yeah. But I'm not sure if you're
5895.10s:  referring to like any other kind of licensing, but I have a driver's license. Is that count?
5905.98s:  Ben says you have to pay more for everything if you get certain licenses. Well, it's not just
5909.26s:  about what you have to pay. It's again, it's about like the purpose of it because there's also
5913.10s:  restrictions that on what you can and cannot do. So like that it's yeah, it adds a lot of nuances to
5923.82s:  what you're doing in order to maintain the license. Moses says, what are you looking for when rolling
5931.34s:  puts? What are some key points you check before rolling? I have several videos that will break that
5939.18s:  down for you in detail. So there's this one. Moses, this one is for you. And then this one is for
5950.14s:  you. And then I'll give you like an overview of those, but those two videos will go much further
5955.02s:  into detail. Essentially, when I'm rolling options, I'm analyzing what the position is today.
5962.22s:  And then what the market is doing and what the portfolio is doing. And then I
5969.74s:  figure out what kind of adjustment for the short puts makes the most sense. Now to use the recent
5975.90s:  moves in T triple Q's as an example, I'm really focusing on the basis adjustment. Meaning again,
5983.18s:  like I went from the 78 strike down to the 75. And the reason for that is I'm favoring trying to
5991.10s:  decrease the cost basis on the short puts in the event that I get assigned is effectively as I can.
5998.30s:  And that's really designed to decrease the total risk, right? Because I can buy more units
6006.94s:  of T triple Q's if I'm buying it at 75 versus 78 and so on and so forth. So with something like
6016.46s:  T triple Q's, the whole point of the short puts is really to capture variance risk premiums. I'm
6020.86s:  really not planning to get assigned on them most of the time. So the rolling is really done to
6027.18s:  aggressively manage the basis to get me out of the trade faster. Ben says at 62%. I thought of it
6034.86s:  does go 80% more down. 38% would not be enough leftover. But I forgot you could roll.
6041.02s:  It's still plenty leftover. It's not it's not going to be enough to, you know, completely undo
6046.62s:  whatever happened. But let's say for example, let's just do a little bit of scratch math super fast.
6054.62s:  And then I got a bounce. But if we take a look at this, let's just go into here. I don't know what
6061.98s:  all this is. We'll just get rid of it. And let's say we have $100,000.
6075.26s:  And then I said, what what am I using 62% something like that 62% and what did I say the basis was 71?
6082.94s:  71 60 or something like that. So this times this equals this divided by this. That's how many shares
6100.70s:  that would represent using a sample $100,000. So then this is how much is left. That represents
6113.90s:  $38,000. Let's say T triple Qs does go down another 80% from where it is now. And let's say that it's
6123.02s:  trading at like 12 and just kind of spitballing. So this divided by this is 3,166 shares.
6135.74s:  You have to round these down by the way. I'm just not bothering.
6138.38s:  So then my aggregate basis would become this times this.
6147.66s:  This, this, right. So it's these numbers.
6160.30s:  Oh, it actually, oh, I forgot because it's rounding it. I didn't expect it to be the perfect
6164.14s:  number. And then total number of shares. No, don't want that way. This way.
6177.18s:  So then this represents a cost basis of $25. So in the scenario that you're outlining Ben,
6189.58s:  what essentially would happen is this would decrease my cost basis from 71 60 in this scenario
6197.10s:  down to 25. So then as the stock is trading around 12, you can still sell short calls at least close
6204.70s:  to your basis. And then you require obviously a much lower recovery move before you can get out
6212.06s:  out of profit. Coffee says do you show any or USMC friends how to trade options? Yeah, a couple of
6218.78s:  them. Not too many are like that interested. But I have one really close friend that I got into
6223.82s:  trading options that still trades today. And then there's another one that you guys have actually
6227.26s:  seen around. His name's Tom. He's been busy with other stuff lately. But he's another one that
6234.06s:  I've gotten into trading options. And then same thing with another one that you guys have seen
6238.14s:  in the discord here and there named Gary. So there's a handful, not a ton, but a handful.
6244.38s:  Most people opt out rightfully so because trading options is pretty complex. You kind of have to
6251.58s:  like really want to do it. But yeah, definitely. I show I show really anybody that's interested.
6259.18s:  My best friend Joe, I had him on the podcast a little bit in the beginning to try and help him.
6269.02s:  I think we'll probably re-light that at some point because he's super smart. I think he could trade well.
6277.50s:  Coffee says, did you trade while you're in? Absolutely, man. I traded while I was deployed.
6284.06s:  I traded my literally my entire adult life.
6290.54s:  Started trading back in high school. So yeah, been doing it for a while.
6298.78s:  All right, gang. Super fun hanging out. That wraps me up. As always, if you guys need anything,
6304.86s:  let me know. I'll see you all on the episode next week. Be an outlier. Go live.
