0.00s: What's up, everybody? Eric here. I am back with my friend Matt Caruso from Crucio Insights
6.80s: and I am stoked to speak with a stock trader. He always balances me out. Plus he's Canadian.
12.56s: So he's just a nicer human being than I am. He's kind of like the, the Yen to my Yang
16.76s: or my Yang to the Yen. I don't know which is which whichever one is the good one. That's
20.56s: you. I'm the shitty one. But welcome back.
22.80s: Thanks for having me, Eric. It's always, it's fun to come out here and balance you out
26.56s: to. You balanced me out too. You keep me going. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there's
30.64s: a good mix here. So we were talking a little bit before we started recording about ideal
36.72s: locations. And you were saying that you're getting ready to kick off the gray season for what?
42.56s: The next almost half a year. How do you feel about that? That's that's it. You know, it's
46.72s: one thing it's good for productivity because you know, like summertime, it's like it's nice outside.
50.56s: You want to go out like stock charts. They're always fun, but a little less fun in summer. But
55.44s: so like you guys have to look at the bright side, right? So the weather's doom and gloom for a lot
59.28s: of months here, but it keeps you more connected with the market, I guess. It's always a silver lining.
63.84s: You're silver lining. Yeah. I was going to say bright side, not a good
67.36s: war. It's there. So it doesn't seem like there's going to be a fucking bright side for you.
72.00s: Yeah. We were joking about that because for those that don't know, I did my undergrad in Rochester,
77.52s: New York, which I was two. I mean, it's like every time I look back at my life, I'm reminded at like
83.60s: how dumb I am. And we were going to tour the campus. And we went through these tunnels. And I
91.28s: thought, wow, like it was so novel to me. I've never seen it before. So it was so cool because it
95.92s: was novel. I was like, wow, they like, they have these cool tunnels and they like paint the walls.
100.72s: And you know, like they it's neat. And then, you know, Eric completely missing the message here
108.48s: means that for a good part of the year, you're going to be muting to your classes through a
113.04s: freaking tunnel because the weather is so bad. Miss that entirely. Just up the tunnels are cool.
118.96s: So yeah, I really misread that one, I think.
124.16s: It's okay. It passed. You made it through college. You're good to go.
126.80s: That's right. You know, what I say now is that if I have kids, if it's a boy, he can go wherever he
131.92s: wants. If it's a girl Rochester, right? Because there's no bikini parties. There's no boyfriends
137.12s: there. Because you're just trying not to become an ice cube. It's like exactly what I need in my life.
141.76s: So that's why it's served a purpose. Talk to me about the markets. How's trading been? I know
148.48s: specifically, I actually just talked to, you know, I'm sure you did Jim Ropel. I just had him on
154.32s: yeah. And I was actually singing your praises to him because I really like your guy's style of
160.96s: trading. It's super fun for me to to learn about to talk about. And he was explaining a bit about
166.96s: his paradigm, how things have been going for him, you know, not great. But I'm really curious
171.68s: how you've been fairing with with your approach. Yeah. So Jim's a great guy and we'll talk
177.12s: everyone's in a while and he's a wealth of knowledge. So he's great to talk with Jim. So, you know,
181.36s: like I've transitioned over the years. Like we spoke about our own past calls. Like I was a day
185.12s: trader for the longest time. So I transitioned to the point where I want to be a position trader.
189.60s: And I want just going to change up how I approach things. And I remember when I started my, when I
194.72s: first started getting into stocks was 2003. I started my career in no way. And I always remember
199.20s: looking at that 2000 to 2002 bear market and not just the depth of it, which was a big bear market
205.76s: after dot com. I was the time like, oh, I hope I never like I know somewhere we're going to get this
210.88s: long drawn out type of market again. But I hope it doesn't hit. You know, so you know, transition
215.44s: all these years later, I think we finally hit that same kind of market. If you look past like the mega
220.64s: cap stocks, which is typically just not a focus of mine. You know, like you have yours. I have mine.
224.24s: And you know, typically buying Microsoft for for a, you know, a couple of percentage points is
228.48s: not what I'm looking at. Most other stocks have really been soft. And so for someone who's more kind
232.96s: of long only and I want a position, I want to put on size. I want to get these bigger moves. It's
236.96s: been a boring market. And it's been trying my, my patience in a sense of, you know, I, you know,
243.36s: as well as I do, it's like discipline is priority number one. If you're not disciplined, you're going
248.08s: to fail. And so, you know, my, my goal has been like, this is going to be my focus. Because in the
254.16s: past, I've tried to run dual strategies. And it's one thing if you're totally systematic, like
258.72s: black box kind of thing, like, you know, it could run multiple, multiple strategies. If you have to
262.48s: still interpret mentally, it's very difficult to be running a very short-term strategy, longer-term
267.84s: strategies. Because you tend to get focused and sucked into the world of the really short-term. And
272.32s: then you, you're always late for the really important turning point. So I promised, my, my,
277.44s: promise I'll few years back. I wouldn't do that again. But now this leads me in this kind of year
281.68s: where, you know, there's not a lot going on. So at least me in a lot of cash, few trades, which,
288.08s: it's not a painful year. It's just a little more of a boring year. Unfortunately.
291.76s: Do you do anything with the cash to at least earn something on it?
294.24s: Yeah, I mean, I think that's the one good thing about the higher interest rates. At least you're,
298.32s: you're getting a nice return on your, your, your deposits while you sit and wait, you know, but,
303.36s: like for someone who lives, who for many years lived for the juice of like, you know, hundreds of
307.04s: trades a day, it's really kind of testing my, my, my discipline to kind of just stay focused on
312.64s: what we need to do here. Yeah, it's kind of like it sounds like you're talking about, I'm not
316.48s: exactly sure what the experience is like, but it sounds kind of like going from like heroin to caffeine,
321.20s: you know, there's a bit in stimulation. I assume. That's, it's really interesting. And as always,
329.36s: I, oh, I always use this as an opportunity to plug options. I know that you were telling me that
334.16s: you started kind of talking a little bit more about them somewhat here and there with their
338.88s: community, which it just elates me, it just makes me so happy. So I'm stoked on that. What are your
346.40s: thoughts, though, genuinely on like the integration of, it's not even options. I don't really care
351.76s: about that, but like of another strategy when you find a year, because to your point, it's a
358.16s: prolonged period of time, right? You're just not getting your pitch. So what's the move there? Do
363.84s: you think that it's better to just wait for your pitch or do you start dusting off the toolbell
369.20s: and grab something else? So it really is an abnormal market. Like if you go back historically,
373.84s: it's very rare. You see this kind of stuff, but it's, you know, abnormal times, breed abnormal
378.16s: markets, but you know, it'll change. But to your point, it's that's one good thing. One of the
383.20s: reasons I want to try this, in a way from day trading, is like, I'm like a market obsessed guy.
387.36s: Like, I mean, my wife has always on me for buying books and this like, it's like a nonstop,
391.12s: like learning process. And so one of the goals I have is, I want to build a smarter way to kind
398.56s: of automate what stocks are going to be the leaders in the next three months, six months, nine months.
404.24s: So a lot of people will kind of look at minimum criteria. I want to see a certain amount of
409.52s: relative strength or price action or be above certain averages or fundamental growth. Like
413.36s: there's all these variables that in reality as individual trades, we're just looking at this
418.24s: massive data. And we have to throw all our experience, kind of figure out how they come together
421.92s: together. So my goal was, was to build like a more intelligent plot from the kind of leverage AI.
428.08s: And I know AI is like a very, you know, kind of generic term. I'm investing now in your business.
434.48s: You can take all my money. I just made a billion dollars. No, but you know, what will make
438.48s: happen? You said AI. I'm pretty sure you should check your email, because it's probably there already.
444.00s: But the funny thing about AI has been around for the longest time. And this is not a generative
449.12s: AI. So like actually all these algals and HFTs and I was building algals for the very short term
454.40s: trading for a shop a few years ago. So I was into this AI stuff like way before with the
459.36s: AI. But you know, ignoring what everyone thinks AI is today, just the kind of black box element
464.72s: to it, like the neural networks, like more advanced stuff. I have someone who we built this neural
469.20s: network. And my goal is to kind of run through this data and build algorithms to really identify,
473.68s: like, okay, these are the variables that are most predictive. How do they come together? Like so
478.88s: each day, you're always dealing with the same variables, but each stock has different, you know,
484.40s: different amounts like this says more earnings less sales or better price action. So like, how do we
489.20s: go from these 10,000 stocks to like, I want a short list of 20 and I want this 20 short list to
494.72s: be like quantitatively driven. I'll do the rest, but I want all this work done. So I've been working
499.36s: on that a lot. That's been a big focus of mine. So to your point of like running multiple strategies,
504.64s: I do, I just want to do it intelligently. And so my goal is to kind of start to automate this stuff.
510.40s: And I read this really good book by Tom Bassow. He's one of the kind of original market wizards
515.84s: all weather, all weather trader. I interviewed him. I interviewed him. Okay, great. Yeah, Tom's great.
521.12s: And he runs like so many strategies. So he's like the other extreme, right? And so my goal is to
526.96s: kind of take a lot of what I'm trying to do now is position trading growth, growth investing,
530.48s: but take it more intelligently and kind of get that equity curve smoother, more effective,
535.84s: make it easier. And so that's like I'm trying to take this time to do that. But my goal going forward,
540.08s: like one year, two year, three years is to be able to run like at least a couple of versions of
544.32s: the strategy simultaneously. I think well, especially when you talk about like smoothing returns,
550.40s: to your point that is one of the fascinating things I find about your your approach versus my
555.12s: approach, right? Where you've had some triple digit years, like deep, triple digit years,
560.88s: right? Which that is I've never seen that. But almost every single year for me, I know right out
567.76s: of the gate, it will be over 20%. I know that almost with certainty, it's been like that for the
572.72s: last decade plus. So it's like the ability to replicate and then scale that I think has been
579.76s: really useful to me. And it's interesting to see you kind of move in at least somewhat a little
584.32s: bit of that direction. So it leads me to what's the hypothesis then? It seems like the majority of
589.76s: like the Cancel and Style of Trading to your point is looking for these big runs, right? So then
596.24s: what's the overall thesis on how you streamline returns if that's the main effort to achieve your
603.36s: returns? Yeah, I think so there's different ways. So I'm really trying to kind of like deconstruct
611.04s: the strategy. I've spent years with it. And so like all the stuff I learned as a day trader and
615.12s: swing trader and running this kind of like like Picasso, like take all the objects but make them
620.08s: know, bring them down to their elements, you know? And so it's, you know, there's different ways,
624.96s: like Willem O'Neill who kind of obviously literally wrote the book on it. He was like a stock guy.
629.68s: It's like I'm going to find my stock and he was, if you think I'm concentrated, I mean his
633.28s: story is like he was like 200% invested in Amgen in the 90s, like like ridiculous returns, you know?
639.52s: And so he was a very all-in kind of guy, but you know, like markets have progressed. That's one
643.76s: way of doing it. I think there's kind of different, like I love Ray Dalio or Tom Basel,
648.00s: it's about like diversification to minimize correlations between stocks to like make it like a better
654.48s: system to live with. So my goal is to kind of take the heart of Willem O'Neill and everything he's
659.76s: doing, but find ways to systemize it more to bring in these other elements, you know? Like I mean
664.16s: Bill was a maverick. He was, he was a hot shot and he was a mate, not everyone has that skill. So like
669.36s: I really want to try and for myself and for others that, you know, that work with me. And also,
674.72s: you know, in the future, I'd like to maybe run some money where it could be more of an automated
678.24s: process. I've never got into because I know my process is very concentrated. It doesn't lend well
682.24s: to like other people's money like investors and all of this kind of stuff. So the goal is to kind
686.32s: of systemize and get to that. And to do that, you really need this, this bigger process to go from
691.68s: like just like a maverick trader to like, okay, this is now a system and we're able to leverage that
696.16s: and focus. So that's, that's what I'm working towards. Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously Jim was able
701.36s: to figure out the funding part, right? We even with kind of that canceling style. So I think
705.92s: there's something to be said about the way that it can be positioned for people that believe in it.
710.24s: I think you also bring up a good point though on, you know, like being 200% invested in as
715.28s: something like Amazon and a single stock because the issue I see with those kinds of stories is
722.64s: that it's just from a statistical standpoint, survivorship bias, like hands down. Because if you
728.32s: take 50,000 other people who put on 21% and they pick the wrong fucking stock, you know what I mean?
735.04s: So to me, when I see stuff like that and, you know, and that's not to besmirch his capacity whatsoever,
742.08s: to your point, he was incredible. He found a way to pick the right ones. But as we think about
746.72s: something that's scalable, reckled, and something that can be applied to a broader audience,
753.60s: that's real tough, man, especially to be that centralized. And the way that
759.76s: Tom trades is actually, it's actually funny because whenever I talk to him, he and I almost have
766.64s: not the same positions, but a lot of the same positions on. And we follow what I would consider
773.52s: to be kind of like a very simplified rule set. So I'm pretty eager to see what you come up with
779.76s: because you're super fucking smart. And I think the way that you look at the problem set is
784.64s: interesting to me because I do think there's room out there for something that's
791.52s: generally replicable, but then also has a smaller component to it that you can get home runs with.
798.24s: I'm interested to see how you kind of combine it. Yeah, for me, it's like, how do you become,
802.96s: how do you become a replicable home run hitter? You know, how do you pull that? That's
808.72s: and think what Bill and you're so right about the survivor ship bias. I mean, I've had my
812.56s: difficult times. I was never concentrated as much as Bill was. But the thing about Bill is,
818.00s: you know, you can do it once you can do it twice. He had a career of 50 years of doing this. So,
821.60s: so he had and he tried to share as much as he could and it's hard to typically, but he had this
826.72s: innate skill. So it's to me, it's like he proved it is doable. It's like almost virtually impossible.
832.96s: It's like saying how many guys are Michael Jordan. There's only a few, right? I mean, so but it can
837.36s: be done. It's like, you know, the four-minute mile, no one thought you could break it, then one guy
841.20s: does and then suddenly everyone starts to do with kind of thing. So my goal is kind of like, again,
846.32s: it's like you said, like trying to figure out what's the problem here. So instead of doing like
851.28s: Bill be 200% of one stock. And I know you're an options guy, but through your experience, you've
855.44s: been doing this long enough. Every bull market, there's always that 10, 20 stocks that that are like
860.88s: the outstanding positions to own. Like I mean, there's those 20 stocks that will return to 300%
867.12s: return. Then you like do like a whole like step lower and everyone's at that, you know, 30, 40%
872.00s: return. Like there's their whole magnitude of returns higher. So if I could find those 20 stocks
878.16s: or shortlist to down to 30 and 20 of those 30 are going to be these epic winners, while you've
883.44s: like simplified like a huge amount of the process. Because then after once you you have this shortlist,
889.44s: you can figure out even like options head there's different ways you can kind of concentrate
893.20s: to leverage that, but then diversify risk away a little bit. So like for me, it's like I'm really
897.36s: trying to tackle this with a really big goal. And like I haven't even spoken to anybody about this,
901.92s: like outside of like my team. So you're like the first guy I'm actually going to get into this with.
906.00s: But you know, everyone starts with this one problem. You have this huge mass of stocks. Who do you choose?
912.24s: You know, and the variables will change over time. And so it, but if you can shortlist, I mean, wow,
917.36s: you've really like kind of brought yourself way forward in like the game of getting to that,
922.56s: home run type of scenario. And you can do it with you can do with a little more diversification.
926.88s: If there's 20 stocks and you have 10, you know, 10 stocks is fairly diversified. You know, like there's
931.52s: most even large mutual funds like 10 stocks is usually like 50, 60% of their portfolio. So I mean,
937.76s: once you can get to that 10 range plus there's a fair amount of diversification. It's not all in on one
943.28s: stock. How do you view the problem set in terms of what's more achievable for you? I look at it
952.88s: this way. If you're talking about the entire population of the stock market and you're trying to
958.32s: call it down essentially to the, you know, 20 or 30 top performers, that's one way to solve the
964.32s: problem. Another way that comes to my mind as you're talking about it is what if there's a way
970.16s: expand the hit zone, but then use something like here I go pitching options, use something like
977.52s: options to add the leverage to then still compete with the top 20% but you only need something that
985.52s: moves again in that middle tier that you're talking about. Because I think about like the probabilistic
990.16s: outcome of, you know, if there's 20 to 30 names of picking the majority of those, you probably could
996.24s: do it because you're smart shit. But like I look at that and I say, fuck, that looks real hard.
1000.96s: And I try to bring the game down to my level, the Neanderthal level. And I try to figure out like,
1009.28s: okay, if you've identified that there's that middle zone where there's maybe a hundred stocks.
1015.84s: Now if you get a mix of anything from that hundred stocks all the way up to the 20,
1021.20s: it seems like with the right positions, you could still achieve a good return. Is that something
1027.28s: you've considered or you, like how do you view that tradeoff between a really small hit zone,
1033.92s: but a motherfucker if you can hit it up a home run versus a slightly wider.
1040.16s: Yeah, you know, like so part of the study I want to do is like my personal preference and this
1044.64s: is why again, I always just manage my own money because I like to look for the big home runs,
1047.92s: which is harder to do and there's more volatility with it. But my aim of the study is to like,
1053.12s: you know, that's my goal. Like how can I replicate other common goals? Like you're talking about
1058.64s: something, let's see what the, we'll assume it's like a better sharp ratio. Something that's like
1064.96s: a little more stable, but there's still sizable returns. Maybe you lever it up or you hedge it out
1069.52s: in other ways. So like the point of the study is going to be to like, how can we figure out
1074.32s: what stocks represent these different opportunity sets? And again, if you dial down like the level
1080.48s: of awesomeness, if you're not looking for Jordan, just looking for like a good NBA player,
1084.08s: well now yeah, you have a much bigger data set, you're more likely to hit it, but there's still
1087.12s: one other problem that you have to identify. And again, this is I think where it helps to have
1093.68s: traded for a long time before doing research because most people who do research are like academics,
1099.36s: so they don't get markets, you know? So like you can look at the data, you can average stuff out,
1103.52s: but markets don't work in averages. There's periods of time where it's, wow, rock and roll,
1108.08s: everything moves. And other times where you can average it out over the whole data set, you don't
1112.88s: notice it. Like for example, the past year and a half, two years, it's awful. There's nothing
1116.88s: going on or big losses. So part of it is going to be how do I identify the best environment to
1122.72s: operate in? Like this is a hyper, it's like your counting cards of blackjack, right? You know,
1126.24s: okay, we got a positive deck now it's time to, I don't know if I'm going to get 21 next hand,
1129.84s: but now's the time to kind of start betting big. And so there's that element of it too,
1133.84s: which is going to be part of the study as well as to kind of figure out not just who are going to
1137.52s: be the best stocks or, you know, how can we identify the mid tier stocks? What's a good time to
1142.40s: operate in? So once you kind of put these, even if these are like, I think of them as like the
1146.56s: big puzzle pieces. So if you have this like, you know, trading can be complex, super complex,
1151.28s: but if you want to simplify it and like, and, and, you know, I know you joke that I talk about a
1156.40s: lot of things, but at the end of the day, trading has to be simple. I mean, you can come to it with
1159.92s: like a complex view, but when you get to the bottom, you know, uh, end of the story, like it's got to
1165.04s: be simple. So to me, those are the most important elements of the puzzle, like which stock
1170.96s: when's the right time? If you get those two things right, the rest is just about like, how do you
1175.12s: want to go about your strategy? Like those are the two things you need to figure out.
1179.04s: Yeah, I love that. And that's a really fun kind of, I wouldn't even call it a problem to solve,
1184.56s: because it's not so much a problem, but yeah, it's like a conditional environment to establish.
1189.76s: It's, that stuff fascinates me because I talk about this in my community a lot, but like, I have
1194.64s: spent more money than I cared to share on just market data. So I typically buy minute level,
1201.92s: full Greek market data from SIBO and anybody can go figure out how much that is for tickers.
1207.04s: It's obnoxious, but I love, I love looking at stuff like you're talking about.
1212.40s: You hit on one thing though that actually I've been working on a lot, which is kind of
1218.80s: classifying broad market regimes and the traits of different market regimes for those
1223.92s: environments. How do you view that problem set when you're talking about something like finding
1229.36s: like a good environment to operate? And obviously the broad market regime matters to you. How do you
1235.04s: think about analyzing that? So this is something like we all do it. Like I spent a lot of time
1241.84s: like sitting down to articulate this because if you start dealing with programmers,
1244.96s: even like the guy I'm working with is super intelligent guy, you know, but they're like black and white.
1249.76s: Okay, tell me what we're looking at. So it's like it's up to you to kind of break this apart, but
1253.68s: if you stop even yourself, like you're looking at this data, you're looking, you're counting cards,
1258.72s: you know, you want to know when's my high probability environment? We're all doing it, whether it's a
1262.32s: five minute chart, whether you want to build a position for nine months. Again, I've used the same
1266.00s: tools for drastically different jobs of like trading in my career and it's just about how you
1271.44s: structure your process. So for me, like trying to approach that environment level, like my current
1279.12s: view is trying to cash these winners for multiple months, but they're, you know, depending on what
1284.08s: you're aiming at, like for example, if you're looking at day trading or one or two day strategy,
1288.32s: the environment you're looking at is going to be a little bit different. There's always like the
1292.08s: the bigger elements will impact everything. Like if the Federal Reserve is like providing liquidity
1296.72s: or lowering interest rates, that helps everything kind of edge higher. But, you know, depending on
1301.68s: what you're trying to capture, that environment, you're going to have to figure out what is the best
1305.04s: environment for you. And that's what we all have to kind of figure out for ourselves, depending
1308.16s: the strategy. Yeah, it's, to me, it's a really fun problem to try to solve because to your point,
1314.80s: you said it earlier and it's stuck with me because it's a fascinating problem to consider, you know,
1320.32s: that right now you feel like the current markets are anomalous, right? That this is abnormal.
1326.16s: And my view typically is like the market is what it is. What's normal or abnormal doesn't really
1332.24s: fucking matter because I've learned that the periods, you know, it's kind of like the same thing
1338.80s: from the seem to live that he talks about where uncommon things happen way more frequently than we
1344.64s: understand. So when you look at analyzing like this kind of market, I agree with you that there's
1352.00s: like a confluence of crazy shit all at the same time that I never would have guessed. I literally
1359.28s: never would have guessed this. But then I always look at how many times I felt that way and how
1366.16s: frequently different variations of abnormal pop up at the same time. So it almost creates this repeat
1373.84s: pattern of abnormal behavior. So to pull on that thread a little bit to understand your perspective,
1379.84s: how do you view like a normal market quote unquote broad content context versus an abnormal market?
1387.84s: So that's a really good question. Like if you stop and think about it, okay? And a lot of people
1393.44s: will say like if they look at a Dow Jones chart or anything Nasdaq chart, I think how could this
1397.60s: market keep going up all the way? Like how does that make any sense? It's like it's a,
1401.36s: you see people say scam doesn't make sense. Think about every year, the Fed wants that they say stable
1407.20s: prices is 2% inflation. That's not stable. That's inflation. Stable should be zero, right? But they
1412.72s: say we want 2% to make sure we don't go into deflation. Okay, so that's the Federal Reserve says 2%
1418.00s: on top of that, you typically have productivity. So everyone every year we figure out how to do
1422.64s: things better, smarter, hopefully as a society. So that's not a two, two and a half percent. So every
1426.96s: year you have at least a four and a half percent push on stock prices up. If everything else,
1433.84s: nothing else changed, everything's okay. So on top of that, there's this like kind of virtuous
1440.72s: circle and vicious circle of credit. So when things are going well, banks lend more, people spend
1446.00s: more, then people have higher incomes, they spend more, they borrow more and things go up, up, up.
1450.32s: So that four and a half percent turns into 12%. And that's why you have these these typical 12%
1455.36s: years. But every so often the cycle breaks, people get at a hand, there's something like you're
1460.24s: seeing anomalous. Yeah, you're right. It's always something different, right? 2011 was the European
1463.92s: like you were calling the pigs that the debt problem, you know, twice either there's a trade war,
1468.48s: there's always something different. But something comes along to snap this credit and puts it into
1473.04s: reverse, maybe inflation picks up, whatever. And so then you go through this period where you have
1477.76s: to kind of like squeeze back down to, to, you know, reverse gear. And once it's we get back into
1484.16s: line, we go back into the normal thing of things, you know, assuming capitalism stays in place and
1489.20s: freedoms and, and all the rest, you know, so, so that's why over time, so we have these normal,
1493.68s: I call them normal periods, but we call them growth periods where there's no systemic problem.
1498.72s: People are happy, people are spending more, which makes people spend more. And you know, the life
1502.40s: we live at most people are just worried about living a good life. And that equals rising stock
1506.72s: markets for two, three, four years gets at a hand, something snaps and it's bad crazy markets for
1513.04s: six months, nine months, this case is longer. Once it finishes washing up problem solve, okay,
1517.28s: we go back into our path. And people say, well, how could you keep going? Like I said, the Fed wants
1522.24s: two percent inflation. They want, and there's naturally productivity rules. So it, and then there's
1526.56s: credit expats. So it does make sense logically that we have these nice trends. So my goal is to like,
1532.64s: how do you participate in those happy times? And as much as possible, like step away or hedge
1538.64s: those nasty times when we're kind of getting back to a lower reality. So that's how I in my mind
1546.08s: kind of segregate the two. Because yeah, you can't, you're right, there's always going to be something.
1550.40s: But if you look at markets, there's the, I mean, look at the VIX, right? So there's the low VIX
1554.80s: regime. That's happy times. There's a high VIX regime. It's crazy times. It can be different reasons.
1560.24s: But if you can avoid those crazy times or minimize them or whatever, you're, you know, big way
1565.84s: away. And high VIX regimes are shorter nature. You have panic. Things happen. Politicians finally
1571.04s: get off their, their, their, the chair. They say, okay, I got to fix something. I'm going to lose my
1574.24s: job and things get fixed. And then we kind of go back into normal. So that, that's how I separate
1579.04s: the regimes and yeah, it's, it's honestly a really beautiful way to describe that. I love the way
1584.16s: that you describe the, the expansionary element of the economy. Because that's something I actually
1589.52s: have struggled to explain to people before as effectively as you did in terms of like why there's
1595.04s: positive drift in the stock market, right? It's the same exact first part of the question.
1599.04s: You answered there, which is, I really like the way that you phrase that. I think it makes a lot
1604.08s: of sense that these are for people to comprehend. When you are analyzing the markets, so going back
1610.96s: to kind of this thesis that you have in trying to dissect things to qualify these different regimes,
1619.60s: how do you view periodicity? So how far back are you trying to qualify? And then are you
1626.88s: applying some sort of waiting factor for the more recent times versus the more distant times?
1632.40s: I know this is a little bit more in the weeds, but the reason why I'm asking is because I literally
1636.00s: am working on the same stuff. So when I'm looking at the different regimes, I found the window that
1644.32s: we analyze is obviously super important. And it's very, very difficult for me to look back at some
1653.28s: of the previous events and say, oh, well, you know, it's unlikely we would see that again,
1658.64s: but there's always some version of that. So then you have to figure out structurally how to wait
1666.32s: the bat and then to be able to kind of classify things in a more recent sense. So to kind of summarize
1673.92s: the question, when you're looking at, you know, your data set to create these qualifications,
1679.28s: what period are you looking at? And then how do you view the different periods time for
1683.20s: them that you're looking at? So it's like anything else, right? When it comes to numbers, the more you
1688.00s: have, like the more proof there is that it's likely to continue. And the one thing that's really
1693.84s: interesting about kind of working with the guy I'm working with who is like this math like wizard.
1698.48s: And he's always telling me that he's like, Matt, you know, he's like, you want to keep as few variables
1702.24s: as possible. They may not be the best outcome, but they're more likely to stay true for longer.
1706.96s: You know, he's like, or else, all you're doing is making the computer like memorize the data.
1710.72s: And it's like, it's like studying for a test. You don't actually study the material, you just study
1714.40s: like a B or C. And that exact same test, you can get 100 on. But if the questions are changed in any way,
1719.52s: you fail. You know, so, so like that's kind of that's always stuck with me the way he kind of explained
1723.84s: that to me. And so like to me, there's there's certain principles like you look back that are just
1728.32s: true of the market. Like I spoke about like the Federal Reserve. And you can go back to like when
1732.16s: the Federal Reserve even before the Fed, the gold standard, like I like monetary history. I'm weird
1736.24s: that way. I'm think one of the few guys who gets excited about reading about like monetary
1739.60s: conditions 100 years ago. But the same stuff that led to the 1907 crash is the same stuff that leads
1747.12s: to that's leading to this current situation. It's the way money flows happen. So there's there's
1751.52s: like high level stuff that's always true. But then after there's certain things that change,
1756.64s: you know, that like at least the tools and sometimes the data really readily available.
1760.56s: Oh, one second, I think my my phone changed.
1767.04s: My problem though we're back. Okay. So like so like there are at some point, even it's interesting.
1772.48s: Like one of the data points I look at is new 52 week highs versus new 52 week lows. And for that,
1778.00s: you need like a deep data set because you need to know all the securities that are listed. And so,
1782.40s: you know, it's funny. Like maybe it's me getting older, but I feel like the year 2000 wasn't
1786.96s: that long ago, but like data from the 90s and 80s is like hard to come by. It's not as readily
1791.20s: available. You know, so there's some tools that are just it's hard. You can't back test them.
1796.08s: You can't really check them the same way going back 100 years ago. It's hard to get the kind of data
1799.68s: and all that, you know. So so I think it's like you want to have like the high level stuff.
1804.40s: And then after you want the data and the tools for the changing markets and I think it's you're
1810.64s: never like one and done because like for example, like before 2000, you know, inside our trading,
1817.44s: not that it was legal, but like you know, right, right, right, regulation FD came out in 2000.
1821.36s: And now you have all these massive gaps on earnings, which you didn't have before because the
1825.20s: market changed, you know, HFTs are a new phenomenon. So you have to always kind of understand the
1830.72s: tools that you're using. How susceptible are they to kind of breaking if like an actual market
1836.48s: dynamic changes? So to me, there's like certain principles that are everlasting, like you know,
1840.56s: like monetary conditions. And then there's different tools about how you go about measuring things.
1844.72s: If you're going to build something systematic, you know, you want to keep it simple and you really
1848.48s: want to understand what's driving it. Because if that snaps, well, you got to know, you know what I mean?
1853.52s: So that's like, I don't know if I answered your question correctly, but that's kind of like how I
1858.00s: think about it. Well, there's two things. The first thing is I actually think about it the same
1864.32s: exactly. So when I'm going through and I'm trying to qualify the different market regimes,
1868.80s: I'm not looking to replicate the individual anomalies that are popping up in each thread. But I'm
1875.60s: looking to understand the quality of the anomaly and then apply a weighting to it. And then I use
1882.16s: that. And that's actually worked really well for me. So it's interesting that you're going down
1885.60s: that that thread because I think that that's a really fair approach. And I think it works
1890.48s: about as good as you can get because to your point, I think one of the issues I found is that the
1895.44s: impacts of different events changed drastically based on even the market structure at a point.
1901.68s: How many participants are there? What's the daily volume of the market? Like all of that stuff has an
1906.56s: impact on how that event impacts the markets. So that makes a lot of sense. And then I also did want to
1914.80s: definitely reaffirm that you are pretty fucking weird for enjoying market monetary policy and
1921.68s: structure from 100 years ago. I consider myself a bit of a nerd, but I would not quite say that it
1928.40s: excites me. But now I know that if I ever need to talk dirty to you, I'm going to break out my
1933.76s: monetary policy speak and then get you going that way. So it's good. It's good to know you turn on.
1938.96s: It's funny. You know, I used to be in a band, you know, always to play guitar and all this kind of
1942.40s: stuff. So it's like I'd be going to practice. But I from like a young age, I was obsessed with
1946.56s: this kind of stuff. So it's like I'd be reading like Ludwig von Meises, which is like an Austrian
1950.40s: economist from like, yeah, many decades ago. And it's like very like deep like, like, you know,
1956.72s: monetary type of tools. And so it's like I'd wrap that up and okay, let's go play some like
1960.64s: monthly crew and guns and roses, you know. So it's I don't know, we all have our, I swing between
1965.04s: guns and roses and monetary policy as my, my pleasures. It's good. I definitely think that they
1970.80s: offer balance to one another. So talk to me about the way you've viewed the markets this year.
1979.68s: And the reason I want to touch on this is because we had a chance to cover some of this the last
1983.52s: time we spoke for a lot of like my friends, like I genuinely do consider you a friend. I try to
1988.00s: like get you guys on periodically because it's really fascinating to me to catch a snapshot
1993.04s: of how we think about things and then how it progresses. So yeah, talk about the markets
1997.52s: writ large. What do you think about them? So this is something like that I've the terms I've come
2002.08s: to I haven't seen other people kind of talk about this way, but like I feel really confident. Like
2005.60s: I've been going over and over with this for a while. I actually had dinner with a bunch of the
2009.04s: guys from the trading desk who still get together. At least I always try once a year and I was,
2013.36s: you know, pitching them this idea and they hadn't heard it before either. But there's this huge
2017.52s: disconnect between the Nasdaq 100 and everything else is, you know, like everyone's talking about it.
2021.76s: And there's some guys will say like, uh, who cares? You know what I mean? It's up anyways. You know,
2025.28s: you're complaining because you didn't catch it. Then other people are going to say, you know, what
2027.76s: you talk? What kind of a bull market is like seven or eight stocks, et cetera, et cetera. But I think
2032.16s: this dynamic going beyond why these stocks went up nothing else did. I think there's a strong reason
2037.84s: and it's never happened before like in modern, ever in the history. So if you think about every kind of
2046.16s: bad market event, where do people go? So the markets worry is bad. The economy looks bad. You go to
2051.44s: the bonds. Bonds are safe back by the US government. And that's where you go. Now people say,
2056.64s: look at the 70s, you know, bonds fell too because there was inflation and the market also fell. Yes.
2061.92s: And so why is it different this time? Well, I think one market has become more sophisticated.
2067.84s: And I think institutional investors looked at themselves. They saw the inflation. They said, I can't
2072.24s: go to bonds. I don't want to be in general stocks. But Microsoft is pretty much as close to get to a
2077.84s: bond. Like their future cash flows are fairly consistent. I mean, it has closed. So like financial
2083.28s: engineering has come a long way. So I think investors have been using like the big cap tech as they're
2089.12s: like their bond proxy. Like, you know, like they can, you know, they figure if Microsoft could adjust
2092.80s: prices for inflation, it's like smooth returns for like the next five or 10 years. Like, you know,
2098.00s: Microsoft office is not going anywhere. And so we can't buy bonds. So everyone rushed into Apple
2104.48s: Microsoft Google because they figure it's super liquid. It's it's it's they have very predictable
2111.28s: cash flows and they were kind of inflation protected. So it ends up being kind of this new bond proxy.
2117.44s: So it's it's created. It's really weird dynamic because there's such a big part of the market where
2122.88s: everything's falling bonds are falling like, you know, all the most stocks are falling yet the index
2127.28s: is going the Nasak 100s like going up. And you can just see if it's the Nasak 100, it's up like
2132.08s: 30 plus percent this year. The S and P's up like 16. Then if you go to small caps or negative on
2136.48s: the year. And you could just see like the further you get away from this like safe haven status of
2140.56s: stocks, the worst year returns are on the year. So it's a really odd year. And I think there's
2145.44s: going to be repercussions going forward because think about it. Like once the problems are solved,
2150.32s: once inflation is peaked and you know, the worst of like, you know, we think the economy is going
2153.68s: to turn around. I think we're going to see this kind of go backwards. So like all these funds are
2158.00s: hanging out in Microsoft and Apple and you know, the valuations are staying high versus everything else.
2163.36s: At some point, bonds are going to become attractive again because there's so be down and they'll
2167.36s: be that swing up and all these small stocks that you know have been obliterated and a better economy
2171.44s: are going to come back. And so there I think there's going to be this weird point in time where
2175.36s: the Nasak will kind of not go anywhere. But that money will rotate out of these like icebergs
2181.12s: of like Microsoft and Apple and everything else will have a huge bull market under the surface.
2185.52s: So this year was kind of confusing because the Nasak 100 gave this I think false
2191.44s: vision of what's going on in the marketplace because of this safe haven status. And
2195.84s: equivalently another time it'll look like all the markets doing nothing but there's a huge bull market
2199.28s: and nobody's in no way because they're just looking at these five stocks which are not going
2202.48s: anywhere anymore because they're fully priced. So that's why I think this is a really weird year
2207.36s: because it's never really happened before. There's never been five stocks that make up like
2212.48s: half of an index with predictable cash flows and that are so systemic. Like America's literally
2217.36s: never had that kind of situation before. So that's why I think this year is such a weird year because
2222.48s: these stocks took the place of bonds. It's a really interesting perspective. I actually think that
2229.04s: I mean the jives really well with what we're seeing if you look at something like the S&P 500 you
2233.84s: know 28% of that index is IT. So even the 10% that that's up on the year very heavily attributable
2242.56s: to tech. So I think that makes a lot of sense. And I also agree with your thesis, not that whether
2246.64s: I agree or not matters. But I do agree with your thesis on small caps and bonds. For me, I view
2256.40s: the Fed pivot to be the point in time where those would kind of have the foot lifted off their
2261.36s: neck. What do you think about that? Yeah, I think so. I think it's once like everyone's
2266.08s: confident inflation is peaking the Fed can go easy. All this is going to go into reverse. You know,
2271.04s: and I know like, and look, I'm a like a technical analyst first. Like I mean, for years, I day
2275.36s: treated like I know a symbol and not what the company does all pretty much like just a broad
2279.68s: industry kind of thing. So some people say like, man, this guy's really overthinking it. But there's
2283.76s: one thing I've noticed for myself because I like the position of like the going size. I've always
2289.20s: made money trading, but I've always made like by far the biggest money like the outlier, you know,
2294.08s: speaking of outlier like the out the outlier returns is when I had a good idea of what I thought
2299.52s: was going to happen. And then it worked out that way because like think about it. It's like
2304.08s: you know, you could make money in a lot of markets. But when you're expecting things to play out
2308.16s: a certain way and you're prepared for it, I mean, you have the size on, you have the right movements,
2312.40s: you know, what you're expecting, you know, what to buy. And so you're doing everything right. And
2316.32s: so you have this massive year. Like I mean, I've had like really big months, you know, just even just
2321.60s: one or two quarters where it's like, man, this is what's going to happen for these these reasons
2325.20s: perfectly positioned. And it's like, wow, bang, like huge market returns. So for me,
2329.44s: I always play the mental game of what I think is going to happen. But I always have like market
2334.24s: tools to make sure I don't like get offside, right? So I could think whatever I want, but I'm not one
2338.24s: of those guys like, oh, it's lower. So now it's even cheaper. I got to buy more like no, if the market
2341.76s: disagrees with me, I'm out of the way. I'm not going to just get run over. But I like to kind of plan
2347.12s: because when I just when I'm right about direction and it plays out that way, for me, that's when the
2352.00s: fire works happen. Definitely. And I think the way you view it is also the way that I tend to view
2357.68s: things, which is not so much as a predictive outcome, but more of a probabilistic assessment.
2363.44s: And because to your point, if you find a scenario that you think it's likely to play out X, Y,
2370.48s: or Z, you position yourself because that's the way you dominantly think it'll play out. But then if
2376.16s: the market doesn't confirm that, it's not like this giant disbelief factor, how it could market.
2382.48s: Right. And I think that that's one of the problems that people that try to do any sort of predictive
2387.44s: modeling fall into is that they think their assessment is what should happen. And then if it
2394.08s: doesn't happen, they're besides themselves. And then that leads to, you know, lake getting out,
2398.08s: not putting the trigger on other trades that need to go on and stuff. So I think that that's a really
2402.16s: healthy way to look at it. When you're looking forward to the rest of the year,
2409.68s: where are the next market leaders going to come from within small caps? So you were kind of
2414.80s: talking about growth, not even small caps, but growth stocks. So within growth stocks,
2419.12s: what sub-sactor do you think the market leaders are going to come from?
2423.76s: So it's kind of hard because when the markets are rough, like a lot of stuff has weight on them.
2427.76s: But there's like some key themes that are showing themselves. Like, you know, I think AI,
2433.36s: obviously, is one that is strong. I think there's a long path to that, but you can't just buy it
2437.92s: any price, you know, like an add-on. Like, you know, like, you need to get it at the right time. So
2441.36s: that's one. You're all the weight loss, you know, drugs, you see like novel norris. I forget the
2446.96s: name of them. It was emphozozempic and those other ones. Look, I mean, Bill Neal made a fortune with
2452.40s: Amgen because they found a way to like, you know, fix your blood after a certain thing. I mean,
2456.16s: so they found a way to help people lose weight. There's definitely a problem in society if that's
2460.32s: the way it is, you know. My hope here is that I'm going to petition a new way for people to lose
2467.68s: weight. It's going to be put the fucking fork down and go for a walk. That's my platform.
2473.12s: You know, I'm someone where like, like, just personally, like, I believe as much as possible,
2478.40s: like, you know, avoid pharmaceuticals for as much as you can, isn't that. But for some people
2484.24s: where like, you know, it could be willpower, it could be like a genetic, I don't know, there's like
2488.32s: reasons why people, you know, are overweight life happens, you know, like the amount of negative
2494.88s: repercussions from being overweight is super high, you know, like it causes so many other problems.
2499.52s: And people are on so many other medications that are triggered from the heavy weight in the first
2504.08s: place. So if they found a way to help people lose weight and there's not many big side effects,
2509.04s: I mean, that eliminates all the other medication that people will likely have to take in better
2513.04s: lifestyle. So look, I mean, it's, if it helps, it helps. I mean, like I said, my personal
2519.28s: preference is not to have to go there in the first place. But, you know, if it solves a solution
2523.12s: with less harm, why not, I guess, you know, but I think that's an important, that's a theme.
2528.48s: But I think there's a lot of stuff waiting in the wings that we had. The IPO market has been frozen.
2533.04s: There's a lot of like young companies, mid-tier companies that want to come to market. So like,
2537.44s: yeah, I mean, I could spit out some other themes that are doing pretty well. Like I think like Uber's
2540.72s: still growing. There's a lot of like mid cap stocks that are doing great cyber securities doing
2545.28s: well. If you look at everything that's kind of like security related, there's like a PSN,
2550.24s: AVAV, which are all kind of like security related stocks, you know, with the wars and all that
2555.44s: spends going up. So they've been acting very strongly with strong growth. But I'm really looking
2560.00s: forward to seeing that IPO market unfreeze because I think there's so much in terms of like AI that
2564.24s: is not in the market. Like it's not going to be a video that's going to go forever. You know what I
2567.28s: mean? Like there's going to be other players who take this and develop new products, new services.
2571.76s: Like think of internet, you know, circa 1995. Like all the players that come out and each guy
2576.80s: leverages the other guy's technology, there's like a lot of stuff that's going to be coming. So
2581.28s: like, you know, I'm not really quite sure how it's going to play out. Who's going to be the
2585.20s: super big winner? Like there's key teams showing strength now. But you know, that changes over time.
2589.52s: So I have to see how the data moves. How do you view the AI landscape? Do you think that it will be
2594.48s: like a really fragmented come to market where it's a really wide industry that grows together? Do you
2599.92s: see that there will be a couple of names that gobble up other names and kind of, I want to say
2604.72s: monopolize, but definitely cut down the herd. Yeah, you know, and I think it's so easy. And everyone will
2611.44s: always kind of say, Matt, like, you know, you know, Google or like Microsoft, the own everything.
2616.16s: Like who's going to compete with them? But you know, the history of like capitalism is that it's
2620.00s: always these big players that get eaten by smaller guys who are faster and quicker. You know what I mean?
2624.48s: Like many other times, there's industries where people could have said like, oh, who's going to
2628.08s: beat IBM or who's going to beat Xerox and they fall like every single time. Like if there's anything
2633.84s: we've learned from like history, that the bigger stocks fail and usually fail quickly. So I'm not
2638.00s: saying Microsoft's going down, but I'm saying like, there's going to be a lot of people who are going
2642.64s: to, first of all, the returns, like if you're already a $3 trillion company to get a double, you
2647.04s: have to increase another $3 trillion in market cap. So like the law of large numbers alone will not
2652.16s: make Microsoft like a five-bagger. I mean, unless it's like the entire U.S. economy. So
2657.20s: you can find these great like I'm I'd like to look for like a $10 billion company that becomes a
2661.36s: $50 billion company or a hundred like that's your five 10-bagger. And there's a lot of companies that
2666.08s: can come to market with it, you know, five 10-billion dollar valuation. They're they're solving a new
2670.48s: problem and you issue like there's a Sam Sarah symbols IoT. Like they have all these chips like
2676.00s: that you can put like tracking type things on on your vehicle. So if you're like I think Delta
2680.88s: Airlines uses them. Think about you have vehicles all over this massive airport. Atlanta airport
2685.76s: it's huge. Who's idling? You know, where can you save gas on idling? Where can you save employee
2690.32s: time from having to find these vehicles? How do you have them positioned? This is all stuff that
2694.00s: can be saved where if you have, you know, proper tracking on all these vehicles and usage and then
2698.88s: you have like an AI brain to say like, okay, well, you're idling too long here. Like why don't you
2703.04s: switch to like a generator instead of jet fuel for that one hour that you know, like that could be
2707.68s: saved money. And so there's going to be these small upsides that are 10 billion dollar market caps
2711.76s: that solve these great problems and make everyone's life better and they go from 10 to 50 billion.
2716.24s: And that to me that's that's my my interest. That's what peaks my interest like that part of the
2722.48s: stock market landscape. Yeah, well, it's also a really cool way to learn about technology and stuff,
2727.52s: right? Like specifically AI. It's I'm similar to you in your thought process. My specific
2734.64s: curiosity is whether or not we'll see like a couple bigger AI names like not existing names,
2742.96s: not in video, but startups or kind of things that pivot in a AI that start to become, you know,
2749.20s: the apple of AI or something like that because it seems like those kinds of markets are fascinating
2756.16s: because it's very new. There's just a ton of opportunity in front of it. There's already widespread
2762.96s: integration efforts. So I'm really looking forward to seeing the way that companies go to market
2769.12s: and how competitive that gets because I imagine it's going to be there'll be enough for everybody
2773.84s: to eat, but I'm imagining that there's going to be a couple companies that get it really right
2778.32s: and start to dominate. Well, you know, think about it. I think a recent history like Google's not
2782.72s: that old. I mean like, you know, it's two guys in an apartment. They created a better algorithm
2787.44s: for search. And I mean, they're one of the biggest companies in the world like and it didn't take
2791.52s: them very long like with technology stuff scales so quickly. So yeah, like Google Microsoft,
2796.64s: they have huge team smart guys like untold resources, but there's always going to be some people
2802.96s: out there that they're going to build a better mouth trap somehow. And like, you know, I know like
2807.20s: data is important, but there's ways to get data. Look at, look at chat GPT and open AI. I mean,
2812.88s: they did who was open AI three, four years ago, right? And suddenly they're the fastest scaling
2817.60s: business ever in history from I think to 100 million users. So like perfect case in point,
2822.08s: like there's so many of those that are going to come out and people also like look at companies
2827.20s: as a company, you know, we've remembered people. So if you're let's say you're like this genius
2831.84s: working or you're Elon Musk, like is Elon Musk working for Google? No, he's so smart. He went out
2836.08s: on his own and he did his own thing. So there's going to be people who are at Microsoft or at Google
2840.08s: saying like, yeah, I make like a, I don't know, a million dollar salary because they need me, but
2845.92s: if I would like do this upstart and I can get funding because everyone knows me and I can bring
2850.24s: that upstart to like a nine billion dollar valuation. Like I'll make 500 million dollars instead of
2854.80s: like five million dollars and the next five. So these guys leave these big shops and they start new
2859.60s: and that that's how this this rotation always happens because eventually all this talent doesn't
2864.32s: want a salary. Like I mean, it's hard to like, I mean, Google's not going to start paying guys 50
2867.84s: million dollars a year, right? That's what the CEO makes or not even. So these guys eventually
2871.44s: say, like, look, why why why stay here? Go start my own thing and then it just gives birth to these
2875.76s: new cut. And that's what I love. Like that's what that's really what gets me excited about growth
2879.60s: investing. It's not just about the stocks and the patterns and momentum. It's like understanding
2883.84s: this kind of stuff. You know, it's that's where all the wealth comes from. Well, it's really fascinating
2888.40s: way to analyze the world around us. That's one of the things I love about the stock market is whenever
2893.60s: I'm learning about different things, in my opinion, you get one of the most unbiased perspectives
2899.92s: possible. Whereas if you pull up one of the other news agencies and read about whatever,
2905.36s: there's always just a ton of skew, right? Based on whoever's producing that content. Yeah,
2910.96s: when it comes to the markets, it's you already know this skew. How does this supply of money? Like
2916.16s: where's the finance here? Where's the opportunity? And I actually love that about markets. When
2923.52s: you think about AI, I'm curious your thoughts on kind of this specific section of it. To me, it seems
2930.24s: in order to really dominate that landscape, there has to be pretty serious infrastructure.
2936.16s: Like pretty serious infrastructure in order to support it. Do you think that that would lead
2941.36s: to one, the birth of a new supporting infrastructure business as well? And do you view something
2946.96s: like that performing in line as AI expands? Do you think about that at all?
2952.24s: I think, yeah, I mean, part of the play, if you look at SMCI, which Supermicro computer,
2957.44s: like they had a big year because they're like part of the infrastructure play. But if you look
2961.68s: right now, I would compare where we are now as early internet, where like now we take for granted
2966.72s: that there's ethernet cables everywhere. And that's why you have fast internet in your house,
2970.40s: but someone like had to lay those physical cables down for you to have this internet. So guys like
2975.52s: Nvidia, Microsoft with their cloud, which they just reported tonight and they beat on the cloud,
2979.84s: or like, you know, Amazon with their Amazon Web Services, that's the ethernet of the current era.
2984.72s: So same with the internet, the first big bull markets were infrastructure guys. And then after
2990.08s: it went to people who implemented that kind of stuff. So Nvidia, I mean, they're chips. They're not
2994.08s: really AI. They're giving the stuff to people to do AI. So I think we see it, but I think they're
2999.28s: already really big and there's probably going to be growth. That's why the Nasdaq is strong.
3003.12s: But the big money, I think that the real surprising stuff is that people, the smart guys, where
3007.76s: they say, how do I take this and like create something new? And even with existing companies,
3013.44s: I think you can see like a stair step higher in earnings because you can be XYZ company. And
3018.16s: you're not an AI company, but just like every company uses the internet today and they create like
3023.04s: new, you know, they run more efficiently. Like imagine if companies today had the same number of
3027.28s: employees and the same kind of cost, they did everything physical. I mean, they'll be like astronomical.
3031.44s: Like you wouldn't have the valuations or the stuff we have today. So people are going to get
3036.00s: leaner, meaner, faster, better, more efficient. And you'll see earnings grow. That's why I think the 90s,
3042.00s: yeah, at the end, it became a bubble for tech. But like the market and even way before the bubble hit
3047.92s: was flying because like the internet made everything like earnings better for everybody.
3052.32s: Everything became more and more efficient and faster and better. And earnings grew. So
3056.16s: that's why capitalism and like free markets, like never mind the profits it brings to people.
3061.04s: Like it makes everybody's life better. I guess it's the system like you need to have that
3065.84s: exists in the world. Anything else is you can end up with a a worse off society in my opinion.
3072.64s: Clearly, I mean, it's one of the few things that like really incentivizes innovation. And
3078.24s: yeah, even really big players out there, you can still to your point compete with them and still
3082.96s: to really fucking incredible. It's incredible. Think about it. Yeah, it's incredible. It's an incredible
3087.68s: system to have in place where you can have these like galayettes and they're still
3091.20s: someone's gonna come up and take them down. It's it's it's incredible.
3094.80s: Speaking of taking them down, I know we're coming up on time, but I cannot not get your take on this
3101.52s: when the Fed starts its pivot. What do you think happens to the market? And I specifically want to
3109.04s: ask you this because I know that you've looked at and only imagine all of the historical references
3116.16s: that we have for this kind of action. And I have as well out of sheer curiosity, but I know that
3121.76s: you have a much wider breadth of understanding of these things. So yeah, I'd love your take on that.
3127.04s: So I'm gonna give the ridiculous answer and say like we can go up a lot or we can go down a lot.
3131.20s: You know, but I'm gonna explain that I think it's likely that we go up a lot. And people can
3136.24s: you know, I've had this conversation with super good friend of mine retreat with things like
3139.68s: it says you know like Maddie in 2008, it's when the Fed started cutting rates at things went bad
3144.48s: because they saw the economy was unraveling. But if you if you go back to me, there's two
3149.12s: different errors. There's there's errors with inflation and there's errors without inflation.
3153.36s: So if you look at the inflation errors, which is like the 70s until like 82,
3160.24s: inflation caused these bear markets. Inflation came in the fed at the hike rates and that crushed
3165.04s: the economy. If you look at the bottoms of like 74, 78, 82, they always bottomed when rates start
3171.92s: to come down because if Fed was start to cut rates when inflation was easing. So the problem
3177.92s: of that time was over. If you look at 2008, for example, the Fed started cutting rates because they
3183.60s: broke everything and because everything was imploding. So the problem was not inflation. Like the problem
3188.48s: was like, oh my goodness, like the economy is like seizing up. So the cutting of rates was like a
3193.92s: different. They weren't cutting rates because things were improving. They were cutting rates as things
3198.24s: were getting much worse. So my view is that we're coming at this inflationary period. And that's
3203.92s: why if you look yesterday, I know Bill Ackman put that tweet saying that I don't know if you saw it
3208.24s: where he says, you know, I was short bonds, but there's too much risk in the world to be short bonds.
3213.52s: So as soon as he said that, the bond market leaped. But like to me, that was a tell of the market.
3217.44s: Because when the bond market leaped and yields came down, the market also went up. So I think the
3221.92s: market's looking for that point and time where inflation is over. Yeah, the economy's not great.
3226.32s: But I think once inflation is fully dead and rates start to come down, the stock markets
3231.12s: are going to be saying, okay, the economy's not great, but inflation was our problem. If rates can
3235.44s: come down, the economy's going to come back. The economy is not broken. So that's why I think likely
3240.48s: we take off what would break what would break that what would make that knock on true? Like the
3244.96s: smaller probability scenario, well, there's a lot of debt out there and rates have gone from zero to
3250.72s: high very quickly. So if the Fed over cooks it, like if they look at too much lagging data and they
3257.52s: wait so long to cut rates that the economy does start to seize up, then after now they have to
3264.24s: actually save the economy because they broke it. So like I think they have the opportunity here to
3268.48s: like soft land it. And if they're not too stubborn and you know, they're not just, you know, I hope
3273.92s: they're just like talking tough to kind of keep things going the way they want it to go. But if
3277.44s: they react in time as inflation easing to start to cut, I think we enter a nice bull market. But if
3281.76s: they really get stubborn and like draw it out too long and things start to implode, then I think
3286.56s: we can get a little we can get downside with the first cut. But I'm saying it's a nine out of 10
3292.00s: chance that we rally when rate cuts start. A couple data points before I let you go again,
3298.40s: just to amplify the conversation around this. I'm looking out at just bond pricing and subsequent
3308.32s: probabilities of rate changes. Right now for one know, the overwhelming probability is no change.
3318.40s: 13Ds, no change with a 25% chance of a hike. Going to 31 Jan, it goes to a 35% chance of a hike.
3329.04s: 20 March 31% chance of a hike. And then it doesn't really show the first majority probability of
3337.36s: an ease until 12 June 24. And that's only a 53% probability of an ease. You know, but I think
3344.16s: that can change because even this year, if you if you remember, when we were earlier in the year,
3347.68s: they were pricing cuts already for like right now, you know, and that's not like that's not the
3351.36s: case. Now they're actually like you said, you know, 35% chance of a hike. So that can change. Like I
3356.48s: really think like the inflation battle is one like like all we have to do is wait around like the
3362.08s: trend of inflation is coming down. If you look at like I think you know, shelter, I think it's like
3366.16s: 70% of like core inflation, which is the problem. And if you look at more real time readings,
3372.08s: I mean, they're showing like 2% inflation or lower. So I think it's just like a waiting game. It's
3376.72s: just that you don't want the economy to blow up until the data comes in, but we're going in the right
3381.04s: direction. Like inflation is no longer accelerating. It's coming down. It's coming down. So
3386.16s: that's why I'm optimistic. Like some people will say, God, the economy's just about to go off a
3389.44s: cliff and you know, this bear mark is just getting started. I don't think so. Like first of all,
3393.76s: that goes back to how the big cap tech have skewed the NASDAQ because it's the safety trade.
3399.52s: If you look at the average stock, small caps or whatever mid caps, like it's they're not going on
3405.68s: like over two years of a bear market. Like this is not early. If we get one more flush down,
3410.48s: if we even get that and and you know, inflation starts to come in 3%, sub 3%, I think we
3418.16s: start to like I think we're like, if this is a baseball game, we're like in the seventh or eighth
3421.76s: inning of this bear market, I think. Interesting. It's also curious to hear when folks like you,
3430.16s: I know Jim also feels the same. What do you guys use for your reference period for the bear market?
3438.08s: So for me, well, I think the general market top November 21, growth top February 21. So I mean,
3445.84s: growth is a subset, but the general market, I think did have that last little push into the end
3450.88s: of 21, but stocks really didn't do much from the peak of February to the end of the year, but
3456.40s: that I counted from growth is going to be almost three years of bear market general stocks. It's
3461.68s: about two years. Got it. Okay. Yeah. And it's that I think your hypothesis on this is really
3469.12s: interesting because I agree with you on kind of the overall tenor of inflation. I find it interesting
3476.16s: where we're still seeing pretty sticky inflation in other measures. So like fuel, food, like some
3482.64s: of those things are still pretty awful for people. Part this out. What do you see going into the end
3492.48s: of the year? Do you think that there will be any significant catalysts that you're looking forward
3498.48s: to seeing the outcome of or do you think it's kind of business as usual? We'll see information as we
3503.68s: get it. Yeah, I think I think we'll see as we get it. I think we'll get more downside person.
3510.56s: I'm actually I mean, I never want to see anyone suffer things to go bad, but from a stock market
3516.32s: perspective, like if we got good downside from here, I think that would be enough to kind of put
3522.16s: an end to all of this would rip the bandaid off. And the Fed would then start to say like, oh, we
3527.04s: have to start balancing the risk of the economy with inflation because the Fed's the market's breaking.
3532.08s: If you look at 2018, Powell was talking tough. The Nasak fell 20% and he flipped. So they do watch
3537.76s: markets. So I think there's pressure on the market now because the Fed's been talking tough. And
3543.36s: even like if you look last week, he was talking even tough regarding the longer term yield. So he's
3548.32s: really putting the pressure on and stocks are starting to buckle. So that's why I think it's going
3552.00s: to happen. But I would I would always remind people because it's easy. It's super easy to get
3557.20s: negative. You know, when things look bad, but like if take a second and look at every bear market
3562.48s: bottom, it's always awful. You're never going to get a good feeling market bottom. So if you go by
3569.12s: what you feel or what your friends tell you or seeing someone close in their business or what the
3573.20s: news is saying, you're never going to buy stocks like in size at the right time. So like I mean,
3577.52s: you should be expecting to be buying stocks when everything looks terrible. Like I mean, some of my
3582.00s: good years was like, you know, I started training pro and oh, eight. And like it was financial crisis.
3585.84s: Like the bull market started March of 2009. I mean, the economy was going off a cliff. Like
3589.84s: companies were banks were failing everything. Like think of COVID. Like we had an amazing bull market.
3594.24s: The world was shut down bang. We go vertical. So it's like the good stuff comes out of the bad stuff.
3599.20s: You know, so it's like I expect more downside. But like I'm looking at it from like an I always try
3604.64s: it takes a mental process like a specific process to keep yourself optimistic when things
3610.32s: are negative. But you really have to because it's so easy to fall into that sense of like,
3615.60s: off things are bad. What was me bad economy? Things can't go up. And then bang, you miss like the
3620.00s: best opportunity and everything runs. Massive massive advice. And I think when people get into that
3627.76s: to that mindset, I always remind them like zoom out, like zoom the chart out, zoom whatever you're
3632.72s: looking at out because they're to your point. Always periods where things look awful. But I've never
3637.92s: seen US indices not make new highs. But you know, for me, like I know from personal experience. I
3644.00s: won't I know we're going late. I won't go long. But like when I was a market making and
3647.68s: pro trading on the desk like being in Canada, we had a lot of the gold stocks, oil stocks and all
3652.16s: that. So like I really got to know the gold industry very well. These commodity industries.
3656.64s: And the gold industry is like, you know, tends to be built on like things are going to be bad.
3660.48s: It's a store of wealth and all that. And at the time, I think it was Ron Paul was running as a
3664.24s: Republican nominee. And he's all about hard money. And they have really, I mean, again, if you like
3669.84s: monetary history, you know, the US is to be backed by gold and all this. And so Peter Schiff had
3675.12s: really nailed like the old nine like financial crisis. And I was listening to his podcast. And it's
3680.08s: so easy to fall. That's like negative thing of like all look at these politicians. They're bad. And
3684.72s: these people, it's so easy to fall into that. And I remember I had missed like a really big market
3690.24s: leg up because I had this like frozen negative bias. And like it's like it came like one day,
3696.72s: I'm like, what am I doing? Like I mean, like it's like you're saying like you're looking at the
3700.88s: date in front of you going up. And it's like you're just telling yourself like, no, it's bad. It's bad.
3704.24s: It's bad. And I remember promising myself, I would never do that again to myself. Like one,
3709.20s: we came out of World War two. I mean, as bad as things look, things were a lot, a lot worse other
3713.52s: times in history. You know, so like look to the good as much as possible, but protect yourself when
3718.96s: the data says it's a bad time. That's that's my perspective. Or or great options and you trade
3725.28s: all the stuff. There's that too. There's always that option, the option of options.
3732.16s: Well, Matt, honestly, man, I'm stoked. I love catching up with you. It's always elucidating for me,
3737.84s: tying into a little bit of your thought process, your perspective. So thanks for hanging out, man.
