0.80s: hey everyone eric here wanted to follow
2.96s: up on a really good conversation i was
4.48s: having with one of the members of my
6.00s: facebook group on
7.20s: why think or swim is lying to you and
10.16s: what i want to talk about is iv rank
12.16s: versus iv percentile although they're
14.80s: used interchangeably these are
16.32s: completely different calculations and
18.08s: it's important to understand that in the
19.60s: way that they're calculated
21.04s: to know how we can use them one is far
23.20s: better than the other
24.40s: and i'll explain why during normal
26.80s: market conditions
28.00s: these two are very similar which is why
29.68s: they're used interchangeably you know
31.36s: people just
32.64s: synonyms essentially and they don't
34.80s: really pay respect to the difference
36.16s: between the two
37.52s: but when we see really large outlier
40.24s: moves
40.96s: like we saw when the market crashed
43.20s: earlier this year
44.80s: that's when their the difference in
46.32s: their computation becomes
47.84s: super apparent and it's important for us
50.40s: as traders to understand that difference
52.40s: because
52.88s: it will completely change the way you
55.04s: approach a trade
56.40s: so what i have here is a snapshot from
59.68s: thinkorswim
60.96s: took it right before this video on
63.76s: today's
64.32s: option statistics which is under the
65.92s: trade tab below
67.44s: all of the options chains and this is
70.16s: for tesla
71.76s: so what this is showing you is it says
74.16s: current iv percentile is 30
76.56s: it's completely false it's not 30 that
78.88s: is
80.00s: a lie literally bold phase completely
82.40s: incorrect
83.68s: that is iv rank and i'm gonna explain
87.20s: over the next couple slides here why
89.36s: this is so important to you
91.28s: and what the difference is here so when
94.08s: we look at
95.20s: iv rank that is calculated by
98.64s: you take the current iv you subtract the
101.68s: 52 week
102.72s: low iv and then you divide that number
105.76s: by 52 week high iv minus 52 week low iv
110.32s: and if you use the numbers again from
112.16s: that same screenshot from the prior
114.00s: screen you get 30 percent this is the
117.28s: calculation for ib
118.64s: rank not iv percentile
121.76s: the reason why it's so important
123.28s: understand the difference here is
124.32s: because
124.88s: this is susceptible to outlier skew it's
127.60s: taking the extremes the high
129.36s: and the low so this can completely
132.48s: give you a false perception of where
134.88s: things are
135.76s: right now and that is why iv percentile
139.60s: is so much more useful than this so when
142.96s: we look at iv
144.08s: percentile it simply takes the number of
147.04s: trading days
148.08s: below the current iv and divides it by
151.04s: the number of trading days in the year
152.24s: which is 252.
153.68s: as you can tell by this simple
155.04s: calculation it is way less susceptible
157.92s: to skew because it's not using the
160.16s: extremes it's just calculating the
161.76s: number of days above or below levels
164.48s: and if you'll notice the screenshot i
166.88s: actually don't use
167.76s: today's option statistics much because i
169.76s: have think scripts
171.20s: that populate that data for me on the
173.28s: chart so i normally see it here
175.76s: what i'll do is i'll include this in the
178.48s: description below
180.16s: so that you can have the iv percentile
183.60s: and this is why right now again iv rank
186.48s: is 30.26 percent is what they're saying
189.36s: an iv percentile is 66
192.48s: that's a huge difference that's a giant
194.48s: discrepancy between those two figures
196.24s: that typically are close to one another
198.08s: and people associate certain trades with
200.88s: in this instance
201.92s: completely different and i would
203.36s: approach these trades completely
205.12s: differently if it was at a 30
206.96s: percent or it's 60 percent so again
209.76s: wanted to share this with everybody
211.12s: follow up on that conversation it's a
212.64s: really good one it's educational one
214.64s: and if anybody's any questions let me
216.72s: know happy to dive in further
218.64s: catch y'all later
