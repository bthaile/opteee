0.72s: what is up to all the outliers happy
2.72s: friday today is the 6th of may and i
5.36s: have a video for you on trading the
8.00s: coverage strangle in bear markets
11.52s: because one looks like it might be
12.96s: looming right around the corner we're in
14.64s: a pretty deep correction right now
16.72s: and uh it's not looking good so figured
19.68s: quite timely to do this video
21.84s: uh but on a real note i did get a couple
23.92s: questions about the strategy and i have
26.72s: a video out on how i traded it during
28.80s: the covid market
30.40s: and i ended up walking away at a pretty
32.72s: clean profit uh
34.80s: despite the fact that the trade was
36.32s: completely directionally wrong so let's
38.56s: take a look at the screen and dive right
40.72s: in i want to cover a handful of things
42.80s: the first thing is i'm going to overview
44.96s: a little bit about that covid trade how
46.80s: it went and then i want to walk you guys
48.96s: through a handful of things that i think
51.28s: are what sets the strategy apart as i
55.28s: have it structured that really enables
57.60s: me to trade it this way because
61.60s: it's not a bearish strategy so i want
65.36s: that to be abundantly clear up front if
68.16s: i knew we were going into some sort of
70.32s: bear market i would not load up on
73.84s: positions to enter into a coverage
75.52s: strangle it is a neutral to bullish
78.40s: strategy but the highlight here
81.92s: is it does have the capacity to
84.88s: withstand bear markets and you can make
88.64s: a little bit of money but the main thing
91.52s: is
92.24s: we don't know when a bear market is
93.84s: going to come so if your goal is to try
96.88s: to perfectly time the markets to the
98.72s: upside and the downside that is an
100.40s: approach it's not mine i'm not good at
102.32s: it so i don't try to be good at it
104.40s: the way that i attempt to make most of
107.28s: my money
108.32s: is through money management and this is
110.56s: the heart and soul of this position so
113.44s: down at the bottom is actually an
114.96s: excerpt from the video that i made
116.48s: trading the kovic drop i'll throw a link
118.40s: to that up here in case you want to
119.92s: check it out but
122.08s: essentially i had an existing position
124.16s: from over here and then this is when the
127.04s: trade really started but you'll notice a
129.44s: few things i entered in here there's a
132.40s: series of adjustments that occur and
134.40s: then this is where i exited the trade at
136.96s: a profit
138.48s: i want to highlight a very important
140.56s: thing this is where i started trading it
143.52s: which was around just shy of what 120
147.52s: something like that right around 120 and
150.56s: then down here i was able to exit at a
154.24s: full profit
155.52s: and that is primarily because of the way
157.92s: that i manage money in the trade
161.60s: sorry i just realized it's closer to 170
163.76s: here and i got out in the 120s that's
166.16s: what i was thinking about
167.60s: so let's talk about how i did this and
170.64s: how it worked out because in this
172.48s: example
173.60s: i was able to essentially walk out of
175.76s: the trade in this specific trade i made
179.84s: 36 000
181.92s: and it's nothing to write home about
184.48s: however
185.68s: against being able to make that on a
188.48s: trade that is not for bearish markets
192.16s: is where the true power of the strategy
194.96s: comes in
196.00s: so the very first thing is again it's
199.20s: not ideal i wouldn't seek to trade the
201.36s: coverage strangle through bear markets
202.96s: but because we i am not good at timing
206.08s: them
206.88s: i typically continually deploy the
209.76s: coverage strangle and this is a big
212.24s: reason why i choose to allocate my
214.64s: portfolio how i do
216.64s: so i have a video on that as well how i
219.12s: like to allocate my portfolio and that's
221.36s: an extremely important aspect of this
224.32s: overall discussion
226.80s: but for a cliff notes on the allocation
228.72s: idea i split my portfolio into a core
232.24s: holding and speculative holding the core
235.04s: holding is really where i primarily
236.56s: trade the coverage strangle this is
238.00s: where i'm going to try to make
240.96s: the vast majority of my annual returns
243.76s: and then the idea for the speculative
245.68s: allocation it's to take advantage of
248.16s: current market trends it's a little more
250.00s: directional a little more risky
252.84s: now i have very strict rules
256.24s: about how much of my account i will use
259.92s: when the market is trading at different
261.68s: levels so for example in the core
264.32s: allocation of my portfolio when we were
266.96s: when i'm trading the coverage strangle
268.64s: in something that's near all-time highs
271.76s: i tend to
273.12s: pull in
274.56s: my initial offering for that trade and i
278.24s: try to limit the amount of risk i'm
280.00s: offering the market
281.60s: depending on the overall condition of
283.60s: the market but i'm a little more careful
286.00s: near highs because obviously we have a
288.40s: little more room to go to the downside
290.96s: especially when the market has a lot of
294.24s: conditions that are tied into it if
296.40s: we're near highs during a trending bull
298.40s: market i'll still be careful with
300.64s: allocation but less so than when there's
302.96s: a global pandemic going on or like right
305.28s: now with the current state of the market
307.04s: as it is right now i've been maintaining
309.04s: a fairly light allocation throughout the
310.72s: year i still look to make what i need to
312.64s: make in order to support my annual
314.88s: target however
316.56s: um i think the market is pretty tenuous
319.36s: so i'm not necessarily offering a ton of
321.92s: risk to the market
323.76s: so
324.96s: let's talk about trading a plan i have
327.12s: plenty of videos out there on the
328.40s: covered strangle and as you guessed i
330.64s: can link to one of them up above here
333.04s: that outlines it pretty well
336.16s: so i'm not going to go super far into
337.76s: detail on all the facets of the strategy
339.60s: you can check that video out but i want
341.20s: a hand i want to highlight a handful of
343.28s: things that were pivotal throughout the
345.60s: life cycle of this trade the very first
347.76s: one is maintaining cash reserves i
349.60s: started alluding to that already with
351.60s: how much risk i tend to offer the market
354.00s: the other thing is when i perceive that
356.88s: we are in
358.96s: more volatile and potentially bearish
361.04s: markets i add to the trade less readily
366.00s: so one of the things you'll see here is
367.76s: rolling to manage basis that's one of my
370.64s: favorite things to do with the coverage
372.40s: strangle i can choose to roll the trade
375.44s: out and not adjust my size and ideally
379.28s: still reduce my strike which reduces my
381.52s: overall risk
382.88s: and that's a great strategy sometimes
384.88s: when the market moves too fast you can't
386.72s: do that without adding size to the
389.28s: account when the market is in a
392.24s: precipitous down move like this
394.72s: i seek to add size to make the most
397.60s: meaningful changes to my basis but i
400.32s: think of them as silver bullets
402.64s: you don't have a limited number of them
405.12s: and you can only size into a trade so
407.20s: much before either you're at the point
409.68s: of throwing a bunch of good money after
412.08s: a bad trade or you just run out of money
415.28s: so with that i am very careful how i
418.72s: choose to scale into the trade as it's
421.20s: going down so in this example
423.76s: i was waiting until 10
426.32s: down moves before i would scale into the
429.28s: trade more and that was really important
432.08s: for me to maintain capital throughout
433.84s: the life cycle of this trade because in
436.32s: this the video i did here that was just
438.72s: one example of one trade that i was
442.32s: working on i had other positions in the
444.24s: entire portfolio and that's actually why
446.88s: towards the end of it i started becoming
448.80s: levered because
450.56s: i had other positions on the portfolio
453.44s: but for this one trade alone i'm very
455.92s: careful about how i add risk
458.32s: the next thing is the long haul the
460.64s: average bear market is around
462.60s: 290 to 300 days i think it's 298 or 299
467.28s: and with that
468.96s: you kind of have to buckle up for the
470.40s: long haul and what that means is again
472.96s: if you scale in with all of your money
475.76s: on this initial drop here
478.64s: you're kind of screwed you kind of just
480.48s: you're sitting on the sidelines
482.64s: um you can take assignment and wait
485.12s: which is part of this whole long-haul
487.20s: concept
488.32s: but i try to make sure that i experience
491.60s: most of the down move while maintaining
493.60s: capital so that i can maintain price
495.52s: sensitivity
497.12s: because as we're adding additional risk
499.60s: to the trade it is cost averaging us in
502.64s: as we take assignment or if we're using
504.48s: it to adjust our short put basis and
507.36s: it's a way to manage the overall
510.08s: risk in the trade however
512.56s: again if you scale in too fast that's
514.96s: why i use something like 10 down moves
518.08s: you run into a tough spot where you run
520.72s: out of money and then you're stuck just
521.92s: sitting on your hands which leads to the
523.44s: next point though
524.80s: sometimes sitting on your hands and
526.96s: doing nothing is the best possible
529.28s: approach and it's exactly why i'm so
532.16s: careful
533.36s: about the products that i will trade the
536.64s: coverage strangle because one of the
538.32s: primary management approaches to the
540.16s: coverage strangle is taking shares in
542.48s: aka being assigned
544.56s: this is why i trade things like iwm the
547.20s: spy the qs
549.04s: i trade things that if i get assigned i
551.68s: am truly comfortable holding them for
553.68s: the long term
555.04s: i offer this point of consideration to
557.92s: you
559.04s: if
559.92s: you sell
561.36s: short puts on something like ge
564.88s: and it goes through a horrible down move
569.20s: there are occurrences where even a blue
571.76s: chip stock does not return to its
574.48s: pre-drop highs it can have that big of a
577.20s: structural change
578.80s: i have never seen an index etf like spy
582.88s: iwm or qs
584.88s: fall down and not at some point in the
587.76s: future reach and subsequently surpass
590.96s: the previous highs that it fell from
593.12s: that is why i like to trade index etfs
595.20s: for this because when i say
596.96s: sometimes sitting and holding is part of
598.96s: the strategy you have to be confident in
600.72s: what you're holding and this is exactly
602.40s: why i prefer index etfs
604.48s: in this scenario i would not do this
608.08s: with individual stocks even if it's a
610.40s: blue chip stock that i really really
612.32s: believe in because there's simply too
614.40s: much risk in my opinion even giants can
617.68s: fall
618.40s: and i'm not willing to bet my entire net
620.80s: worth on an individual stock falling i
624.08s: am however much more confident betting a
627.12s: significant chunk of my entire net worth
629.76s: on the broader market in the broader
632.08s: market returning because again it hasn't
634.56s: failed so far sometimes you've had to
636.16s: wait a little while but it comes back
639.52s: the other thing i want to highlight here
640.80s: is risk inflow outflow so as i'm talking
643.60s: about scaling into the trade that's what
645.28s: you're seeing here so from s1 to s1 i'm
647.68s: maintaining size then from s1 to s2 i'm
650.72s: adding size then from s2 to s3 i'm
652.96s: adding size s3 to s4 i'm adding size
656.32s: now as we start getting a little bit of
658.32s: accommodation in the market you'll see
660.40s: that it goes back down to s3 back down
662.96s: to s2 back down to s1 these are
665.84s: instances where i'm actually reducing
668.40s: size
669.44s: so i am very
671.36s: eager
672.32s: during this kind of market to offer risk
675.84s: and take risk off the table to reduce
679.28s: the overall profile i'm offering to the
681.76s: market because you have to remember
683.76s: during this entire portion of the trade
685.84s: we are managing a loss the trade is not
687.92s: working in our favor we are simply
690.08s: trying to make money back so that we're
692.96s: not stuck holding an unrealized loss for
695.36s: an extended period of time
697.36s: so that's why you'll see me start to
699.44s: take risk off it's the same thing this
701.92s: past week on the fourth of may after the
704.08s: fed announcement we got that bit of a
705.68s: bounce i took some of my short puts off
708.96s: of iwm and i'm glad i did that because
711.68s: the rest of the week they were down they
713.20s: would be underwater right now by like
714.96s: nine dollars
716.56s: so i during tenuous markets during
719.28s: choppy volatile markets if i'm starting
721.84s: to scale in a big way i am going to be
724.48s: looking for opportunities to get out of
726.64s: the trade at a scratch or a small profit
728.96s: so that i can get the risk off the table
731.12s: and it increases my subsequent
733.44s: sensitivity to the trade if we do have a
736.40s: true bear market that again lasts much
739.28s: longer than the three-day bear market we
741.68s: experienced during iwm that kind of
744.64s: thing
745.84s: all right next one accepting red i'm not
748.24s: going to spend too much time on this
749.84s: it's kind of self-explanatory but it is
751.76s: important to note there is a
753.60s: psychological effect of every single day
756.00s: opening up the platform seeing an
757.60s: unrealized loss especially if it
759.44s: continues to grow if you haven't
761.76s: experienced that yet
763.68s: do not think that you
766.00s: know how you will react because you
767.84s: don't we don't really have a great idea
770.08s: of how we react in that scenario until
771.68s: we start to experience it most people
774.72s: get scared they get shaken out and then
776.56s: they exit at the worst possible times
779.84s: so it is just important to acknowledge
782.08s: that that exists perhaps test a couple
785.12s: of your strategies during bad markets
787.84s: paper trading see how you react to those
791.76s: and to get a general idea of how you
795.36s: will react to them to the actual
797.68s: downfall if you're trading this kind of
799.36s: strategy in it the vast majority of
801.60s: people again will think that they're
803.84s: comfortable holding the product until it
806.08s: falls by 40 in value 50 in value then
809.52s: all of a sudden they're not comfortable
810.64s: anymore although they said they were
812.24s: originally so there's nothing wrong with
814.40s: changing your disposition or changing
816.96s: you know the way you're managing the
818.08s: trade based on new information as it
819.84s: comes in but it's just important to know
821.84s: that this is an extremely extremely
824.16s: common trend for people
826.08s: and again this is why i like to trade
828.00s: index etfs because this is it reduces
830.88s: this factor almost 100 fold for me
834.24s: if i'm trading individual stocks there
836.24s: is always the potential for it to die
838.96s: however i have not seen it happen with a
841.44s: broad market index yet so that is
843.76s: exactly why i use that strategy to help
846.08s: me manage those emotions i simply know
848.08s: i'm holding an unrealized loss and i
849.84s: have to wait that's it
851.76s: okay last thing i want to talk about is
853.84s: again that portfolio management approach
856.72s: i already explained how i break out my
858.96s: portfolio the important thing to know
861.36s: here is by managing the allocation
864.56s: though between these two
866.88s: what happens is it allows me to still
869.60s: deploy
870.72s: this speculative allocation of my
872.88s: portfolio to benefit from the current
875.52s: market circumstances so when we started
878.16s: in this really big decline i started
880.32s: adding bearish strategies in the
882.48s: speculative holdings the reason i do
885.04s: this is it helps me to manage the
886.88s: overall risk of the entire portfolio and
889.60s: even though i'm managing big losing
891.84s: trades on the course side i'm able to
894.56s: engage the market effectively with the
896.80s: speculative side maintaining more
899.28s: sensitivity to current pricing by
901.52s: structuring the portfolio in this way
903.52s: you are still able to engage with the
905.76s: market and you're not stuck sitting on
908.00s: the sidelines however the only way you
910.08s: get to this is if you plan for this
912.48s: ahead of time and you leave enough money
914.64s: to be able to trade the side of the
916.08s: account still so i offer that for a
918.48s: general idea because a lot of people
920.32s: don't think about this until they're
922.16s: down here out of money so
925.44s: in summary you can trade the coverage
927.20s: strangle in all market conditions it is
929.52s: a neutral to bullish strategy but it can
931.92s: survive
933.20s: bear markets and again it in this exact
936.24s: scenario it allowed me to exit the
938.88s: overall position far earlier than i
941.60s: would have if i didn't do this i got
943.84s: hung up at around 170 basis here i was
947.36s: able to get out at around a high 120 low
950.72s: 130 basis so there's a 40 point move
953.28s: that i didn't have to participate in or
955.60s: wait for in order to get out of this
957.44s: thing as a profit that is why i love
960.72s: this strategy so much and if you
962.72s: structure it carefully it can do you
964.80s: pretty damn well so if you enjoy this
967.12s: content make sure you subscribe to the
969.12s: channel like the video throw in the
971.28s: comments what kind of thing you saw in
973.52s: this that was useful or any other
975.12s: strategies that you deploy in bear
977.44s: markets don't forget to follow me on
979.12s: twitter at esm vests i hope everybody
981.36s: has a killer weekend be an outlier see
985.04s: you guys later out
