0.12s: can you use Delta as the probability for
2.96s: an option being in the money at
5.24s: expiration and if you know anything
7.20s: about me you already know the answer it
9.24s: depends cuz it really does depend it's
11.20s: not a blanket answer and a lot of people
13.20s: don't know that so the goal of this
14.56s: video is to walk through even why we can
17.48s: use Delta as an approximation of an
19.72s: option being in the money but then also
21.76s: some of the math behind it so that you
23.68s: can be smarter on how these things work
26.12s: and then at the end of the video I want
27.56s: to walk you through the exact scenarios
30.00s: where it does work and then it doesn't
32.16s: work because sometimes you have to apply
34.60s: different approach to get an accurate
36.44s: answer so with that what's up everybody
39.20s: welcome back to all the outliers and a
40.64s: shout out to the patreon family let's
42.92s: get straight to business so Delta as a
46.20s: probability we are going to start with a
48.36s: practical application for you guys let's
50.68s: take a look here at Nvidia and we're
53.44s: going to look at this 15 December 2 DTE
57.00s: options chain and then my editor will be
59.08s: kind enough to help help you guys see
61.16s: and follow along with what I'm talking
62.76s: about right here we can see the Delta
65.60s: for this 480 put the Delta here is 44 so
70.24s: traditional approach then would say that
71.92s: we have a 44% chance of this option
75.08s: expiring in the money at expiration I
77.76s: guess expiring in the money and then at
79.80s: kind of duplicative whatever expiring in
81.52s: the money at expiration making sure you
82.92s: know that it's at expiration and if we
85.12s: take a look at the probability that's
86.88s: calculated by The Thinker swim platform
88.84s: this is showing me
91.52s: 4455 it's moving around right now cuz
93.76s: markets are still moving a little bit
95.24s: they're closed but volatility still
97.36s: changes so anyways that's what you're
99.20s: seeing this is very close right this is
100.72s: saying now 43 and it's 44 it's within a
103.76s: point very close tolerance Okay cool so
106.24s: then it sounds like it works right why
109.04s: is this the case and then what was I
110.96s: talking about at the beginning of the
112.12s: video when I said well it doesn't always
113.68s: work well let's take a step over to
116.56s: everybody's favorite I'm actually pretty
118.52s: sure this is universally except accepted
120.16s: that everybody really loves my
121.40s: handwriting a load of so where
124.48s: would I be without sharing look at that
127.48s: I even got to the point where I had to
128.92s: crunch some of this in so my awful
131.24s: handwriting got even worse if you can
133.40s: even believe that tough for me to
134.84s: believe but I'll walk you through it
136.28s: don't worry you don't have to know this
137.84s: information in depth I just want to show
139.80s: you why this works so that you have a
141.60s: better understanding and if you like
143.32s: this side of trading I have a video
145.44s: called introduction to options where I
147.40s: dive deep into things like the black
149.44s: short
150.32s: formula well really black shs Martin
152.12s: model but the formula that they use in
153.80s: Blacks model so that you can better
156.40s: understand these things but it's just a
157.80s: differential equation with some
159.04s: different inputs that's the punchline
160.88s: okay that means absolutely nothing to
162.56s: you as it should because if it did that
164.32s: means you probably have as little of a
166.20s: life as I do and you don't actually want
168.16s: to know what this means but here's a key
170.12s: for you down here again we don't have to
171.64s: go through it it doesn't really matter I
173.12s: just want to highlight a few things to
174.28s: you first I am going to explain to you
176.20s: what D1 is so right here is where I
179.04s: break out D1 so that you can see what
181.64s: goes into D1 this matters for a
183.72s: particular reason why would it matter
186.00s: you might think because fun fact I don't
188.52s: know if you can use the term fun fact
190.28s: when you're talking about this kind of
191.68s: stuff but I'm going to do it anyways cuz
193.12s: I think it's fun boom that's Delta nd1
196.00s: is Delta so this is how we are
198.16s: calculating the Delta of an option now
201.20s: it is important to note that n in this
203.52s: context n of X is a cumulative density
206.72s: function if you don't know what that
208.20s: means that's okay you don't really have
209.92s: to know what it means but you can simply
212.16s: think of it as a distribution of a real
214.68s: variable so in this case for D1 I am
218.04s: going to walk you through the inputs
219.80s: because the inputs here matter to us
221.68s: here we have the log normal distribution
224.00s: of the stock price divided by the strike
226.20s: Price Plus the risk-free rate plus the
229.48s: annual standard deviation of volatility
231.64s: squar divided by 2 multiplied by time
234.08s: and in this case time is as a percentage
236.40s: of a year and then that's going to be
237.76s: divided by the annual standard deviation
240.48s: of volatility square root of time okay
242.96s: why does this matter well I'm going to
244.72s: show you but before that because I have
247.16s: OCD there's D2 in case we were wondering
249.80s: you probably over there thinking like
251.16s: what the hell is the cumulative density
252.60s: function of this one well that's D2 fun
254.28s: fact okay but why does it actually
255.96s: matter well let's take a look at how we
257.96s: calculate the probability of an option
259.84s: being in the money you take the normal
262.40s: distribution of the log normal function
265.40s: of strike divided by stock price all of
268.52s: that's divided by volatility time the
270.84s: square root of DTE over 365 so in this
274.40s: case T right is DTE is a percentage of a
277.40s: year that's exactly what we're doing
278.72s: here so if you notice the denominator in
281.24s: this case is the exact same thing so
282.84s: then if you look at the numerator you
284.72s: see that this is slightly different
287.64s: slightly different here we're adding a
289.68s: couple additional components like the
291.48s: risk-free rate annual standard deviation
293.20s: of volatility this is to get Delta
295.28s: because remember Delta has a different
297.24s: purpose of probability of being in the
299.08s: money this matters so because of this
302.28s: let's now take a look at when this does
305.52s: and does not work because in this
308.20s: example it worked beautifully right we
310.68s: have the 43 Delta and it's 44%
314.20s: probability now let's go out to
316.12s: something that's 37 DTE this is 45 Delta
319.96s: for the 480 put and that's
322.60s: 48.6% probability of being in the money
324.60s: what do you notice if it's not clear yet
326.88s: let me zoom out even more let's go to
328.80s: this 19 April 128 DTE I'm going to look
331.44s: at this 42 Delta 480 put I'm just taking
334.20s: essentially the first out of the money
335.56s: put the 42 Delta out of the money put
338.40s: now has a 42% probability according to
341.56s: Delta but according to the option it's
343.80s: 50.7 4% as calculated by thinker swim so
347.04s: what do you notice ideally you notice
349.80s: something that's pretty clear at this
352.04s: point what's happening is the further
354.52s: out in time you go the less accurate
358.20s: Delta is very important for you to know
361.20s: that if you trade anything essentially
363.60s: that's over 90 DTE because if we go back
366.52s: to this example this is 42 DTE This Is
369.92s: 50 that's a 8 point variance eight
373.36s: almost 9o variance if you're trading
376.20s: something where your outcome can have
379.36s: nine points of slack in potential
382.40s: outcome one good on you cuz that means
384.76s: you have found an insanely insanely
387.92s: effective Edge but most of us don't have
389.84s: that the difference of a 9% probability
392.36s: here is pretty massive and I keep
394.40s: growing it I realized but yeah it's this
397.36s: is essentially and this is only 192 days
400.52s: out or 128 days out there goes dyslexia
403.48s: so what I'm highlighting though is the
405.72s: further you go out in time the less
408.16s: accurate Delta is as your approximation
411.12s: now for those curious on how this all
414.12s: works I bring you the gift of math oh
417.64s: hell no let me close close this up so
420.08s: it's easier for you to follow along you
421.64s: can essentially do a side by side with
423.44s: me and I'll Zoom this in for those that
425.04s: are visually impaired I know that I have
427.00s: a decent amount of my audience that's
428.68s: above 60 so you guys might need your uh
431.04s: your fancy two-tone shades make sure
432.92s: you're not in the sun otherwise it'll be
434.16s: too dark and let's take a look I took
436.48s: the current figures so 48088 for NVIDIA
440.48s: and here are the parameters we need we
442.36s: need the stock price days expiration you
444.76s: get to pick whatever option you're
446.48s: looking at so in this case I'm looking
447.88s: at a put and a call I'm looking at the
450.00s: 480 put the 485 call then I'm going to
453.00s: grab the implied volatility for both of
454.84s: those options so the put IV in this
456.64s: instance is 33.3% the call IV is 32.4 2%
460.84s: you'll have to trust me cuz it's covered
462.20s: right now and let's take a look at the
464.44s: outputs for the put this is calculating
467.64s: the probability of in the money being
468.96s: 49.3 1% thinker swim is calculating it
472.12s: at 48.63 per and the Delta is
475.24s: calculating it at 45% all slight
477.52s: differences because thinker swim is
479.36s: going to apply their proprietary
481.64s: formulas for most of these things so
484.00s: that's why it is a slight deviation from
486.12s: this but you should notice one thing we
488.04s: are much closer to what thinker swim is
490.00s: calculating in this instance than Delta
491.76s: is same thing for the call side so how
494.16s: do you calculate these I'll highlight
495.96s: these real quick so that you can grab
498.00s: the formulas but it's literally just
500.76s: grabbing the formulas that I just showed
503.08s: you guys but this for those that look at
505.76s: that and their eyes gloss over here's
507.60s: literally what you could just grab from
509.32s: Google Sheets or Excel is the same thing
511.32s: now I will say before people start
513.20s: dropping in saying like her the normal
516.16s: distribution functions not working if
518.04s: you use something like Google Sheets
520.16s: there are a lot of them right so there's
522.64s: normal distributions for sample normal
524.48s: distribution for populations so in this
527.28s: case you want to use the standard normal
530.80s: distribution function so norm.
533.60s: s.d and then in Excel it's slightly
536.12s: different but you'll be able to figure
537.96s: it out hopefully if not don't do this
539.92s: and probably don't trade so be an
541.72s: outlier see you guys later
