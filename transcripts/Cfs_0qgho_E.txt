0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: back
116.00s: The voice might sound a little bit weird. I think I have a little bit of congestion from traveling.
121.52s: Generally, I feel okay. And thankfully, because I started doing a little bit of homework on a tweet
132.88s: that somebody tagged me in. Where is it? This one. Let me show you guys. So there was my
142.72s: mind of my business, chilling. And then I was tagged by that hell of a long, I'm going to just go
151.60s: with TJ. TJ is pretty brief. So just go to TJ. There's a lot more numbers though. And TJ
160.80s: was seeing if we could take a look at it. And the answer is absolutely. I am infatuated with learning
171.60s: more about markets and pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And I have a deep appreciation
177.28s: for anybody that puts anything together that's even moderately well developed because it takes a lot
184.56s: of time and effort. So it is super clear that as I pop this open, I didn't go through it yet at
191.04s: all. But one thing I can say is it is not a brief document. It's 44 pages. So it tells me somebody
198.72s: put time into this. And I immediately treat that with respect with respect because especially
204.48s: looking at something like GameStop, there are so many theories, so many avenues twists and turns
212.88s: that make it pretty difficult to truly identify what's going on. And I'm always eager to see what
221.44s: people are digging up. Now a couple admin notes. I approach this kind of stuff with a really
230.32s: poor version, like a semi varied version of the scientific method. And I try to look for in the
239.92s: military, we would refer to them as capabilities, critical vulnerabilities, centers of gravity,
249.44s: that those are just terminology frameworks in my mind, centers of gravity are things that really
255.04s: bolster the concept or the thing, critical vulnerabilities are gaps, things that we're taking
260.00s: leaps to come up with what we might be thinking is going on. And I try to look at it as objectively
268.08s: as possible. And something like GameStop has a lot to it. So all that aside, I am very much
279.44s: a trader. So there's two parts of my brain's brain when I look at this. There is the part that is
286.16s: looking for how do I trade this thing? And then there's the part that is just interested in how
292.00s: this thing behaves and moves. And this is more to dive into the latter element.
301.52s: People have asked me a bunch of times, especially people that are more familiar with more of my
307.28s: broader content, which is just about options trading. Why I'm so interested in GameStop. And I
314.40s: will always reiterate the point for everybody, because I think it's important to continue to
318.56s: promulgate this message. GameStop can teach you a lot about markets that you otherwise never would
325.28s: come across. And I know that from firsthand experience, it has taught me a tremendous amount.
332.96s: And I do not have even a monochrome of the answers, but I look to explore them with you all.
342.16s: So giant preamble aside, let us get set up on the main screen. And then we'll start digging into
352.88s: this bad boy. All right. Now I'm assuming I have to assume. I have to assume Newton has
367.60s: already looked at this. And I grabbed his Google sheet because he has everything that I can think
377.12s: of with respect to things about settlement, which I have to assume. That's what a lot of this
382.56s: document is going to be about settlement. Again, I haven't read through it yet. I'm just guessing
387.28s: because that seems to be the biggest focus that I find when I look at the computer, look in the
392.08s: community. So with that, with that, no, at least. Okay. Yeah. So Robert says yes, Newton reviewed it.
403.60s: Yeah. Okay. It makes perfect sense. I would appeal to Newton's understanding of this stuff over
409.84s: my own, specifically with respect to settlement and whatnot. He's been spending way more time and
416.40s: effort looking into the dates, the relationship between dates. I won't hold a candle to what he
422.96s: can identify. I will do my best to see what I can see with my own eyes, hopefully offer a little
428.64s: bit of value for the broader analysis. But I absolutely think he will be the the main dude I would
436.24s: take a look at. Maybe even during this, we'll pull up a couple of his videos and just scroll through
441.12s: them because I respect his opinion on this stuff tremendously. All right. So let's get this thing
450.24s: started. I'm going to zoom this in a little bit. So it's easier for you guys to see.
456.80s: And then the other thing I'm going to do to prime myself is I'm actually going to upload a
463.36s: version into chat GPT and have chat GPT start to summarize it. It says file is too large.
477.44s: As per I'll probably have to split it up. Okay. Let's see. Let's see if this thing can
484.72s: summarize it. It's only 44 pages.
493.20s: Grapture says would jump. Oh great point Gemini. I can W's for Gemini
500.48s: because I already have it uploaded and I already have it configured.
515.04s: All right. Let me delete this and then let me let me this is upload an image. I want it to look at a file.
530.56s: And review the file named the big DD and provide a summary. Let's see if I can do that.
544.24s: Right now Gemini. Yo, W's for raptures. It looks like it looks like Gemini will be our answer.
565.68s: So let's see what else we can let's see what else we can extrapolate out of this thing.
582.40s: Great. A bullet did list of each of the main topics with the porting summary.
591.04s: To be clear, I'm going to go through this whole thing. I do this to help prime what I'm going to be
595.92s: looking at. Again, especially when it's something that I'm less familiar with,
600.72s: priming my brain helps me a lot. So that's that's all I'm doing right now.
607.44s: All right. Let's see if this can continue on that.
609.68s: And then I'm just going to join this up with the other windows I have. So let the raw consolidated.
628.48s: All right. How sick is this?
634.80s: Yes.
636.32s: Captures you get plus two fake internet points because that was a massive recommendation.
647.60s: Shout out raptures.
651.92s: The reason I'm so stoked on this is because this I have in my Google Drive, I have links to
659.76s: hundreds of different studies about things that impact settlement, GameStop,
666.72s: SEC, filings. So I will be able to query this against all of that, which I'm pretty excited about.
676.24s: Let's see what we see from a high level overview first.
680.48s: So from a settlement perspective, it says explains the basics of settlement theory.
685.60s: Well, you expected to see this, including trade date settlement dates,
690.00s: different settlement rules defined by the SEC for those that are unfamiliar with what this all means.
698.16s: It is everything to do with FTDs and it does everything to do with moving the obligation to acquire
706.88s: shares around. So this is relationships between entities like market makers, authorize participants,
714.40s: stuff like that. This has explores an interesting finding about ETF in a no action relief letter.
721.12s: I literally, I literally saw this on Newton sheet and I expected that to have something to do with
731.52s: this. So I assume this is what this is referring to. We're a market maker, software permission to use
739.28s: irrevocable ETF creation orders to satisfy FTDs. Okay. Oofing a term used to describe delayed settlement
749.92s: mechanism affecting stocks. GameStop runs are driven by catalysts and can be explained using two
756.16s: sets of settlement formulas, S final, S final. So T1 plus 2, that's initial settlement.
764.32s: T235C and 35C minus one. That'll have to do with the 35 day settlement cycle.
778.00s: And then T3 plus 2, I imagine that's moving back to
787.60s: an authorized participant potentially. So I think this is talking about the bouncing of
795.04s: settlement requirements, essentially kicking. This is like the kicking the can idea as far as I
800.96s: could tell. Again, we'll get way more into details. I crack into this thing. This is just at a super high
807.04s: level overview based on two sentences that I'm seeing. So I can be 100% wrong. I want to be super clear.
815.20s: Speculates market makers using mechanical mechanism similar TTF creation approach. So this is the
820.64s: ETF creation redemption using ETFs that hold baskets ETF holds baskets of different stocks.
826.88s: And you can the theory is you can use ETFs that hold something like GameStop to satisfy
833.84s: locates and stuff like that. So totally understand what they're talking about here.
838.56s: RexO6-8. This is funny because Newton and I a long time ago we were talking about RexO6-9.
845.84s: So I don't know much about this one. Discusses margin deficiencies,
853.20s: specifically O6-8 detail explanation of margin margin deficiencies, how they are calculated,
859.04s: explains how RexO6-8 allows firms to request extensions of time for satisfy margin deficiencies,
866.40s: granting them in additional 14 days. Yep, that makes sense. So this is another exemption that's
875.68s: provided for entities. It's almost like extending a line of credit. Following along with this so far,
884.80s: I'm going to ask it another couple of questions once I get through all these.
888.72s: Analyze several GameStop runs, including the squeeze, the Fedwire,
897.60s: Mario Day run in the Wombo combo, contributing them to catalysts in their effect.
906.08s: Okay. Provides a detailed breakdown of each run, highlighting the role of essentially the...
915.44s: I don't know what this boofing term is. It's just like a redemption creation cycles.
925.52s: RexO6-8 and other factors like options, activity and market sentiment.
931.44s: Okay.
934.08s: Examines, two big runs in 24 associated with DFV's return, including run, low-low-run,
939.84s: and the DFV's return O6-8, RexO6-8.
944.24s: explains how DFV's return and trading activity triggered margin deficiencies
949.60s: and RexO6-8 extensions leading to increased volume and volatility.
954.32s: Solves the emoji. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually very excited to see what this talks about
961.04s: with respect to this emoji timeline. I've seen so many people guessing at what this thing is.
967.68s: Revealing it as a countdown to potential MoAstates, July 3rd and 5th, 24.
975.68s: Really interested in that. The reason why I'm so interested in that is because that's so far
982.32s: out from now. Wait, does that mean 24, 25? I think this might mean 25.
996.88s: Cost and Chewy provides additional examples of runs on cost and Chewy, demonstrating,
1003.52s: creation, redemption and O6-8 are not unique to GME. Highlights the rising floor pattern and cost
1009.76s: suggesting it aligns with lock the float theory. Fascinating.
1018.56s: The, I mean, for my understanding specifically with the involvement of cost and Chewy,
1024.56s: I've always just took that as their part of the ETF creation redemption cycles. So if they're
1031.20s: bundled in an ETF that is affected by the creation redemption cycle, now the one thing that I haven't
1039.44s: done that we as a community have to do is we have to look at the other names in those ETFs. We
1046.08s: can't just look at the names that were interested in. We can't just look at cost Chewy
1050.88s: GameStop and say, okay, when we go through these ETF redemption creation cycles, do those
1056.72s: move because if the theory holds, then it should broadly apply to most of the names in an ETF.
1065.60s: Now, I would feel comfortable restricting it slightly, of course, because things like cost,
1072.56s: Chewy GameStop, they're not mega cap stocks. I mean, GameStop is like a mid cap stock now,
1078.16s: but I mean, generally we refer to them as small caps. So because of that,
1086.96s: that's a big RFI request for information. That's like a big piece of homework that I think we
1093.28s: have to do. So I'm actually going to take a couple notes here and create a little bit of a to-do list.
1107.12s: All right. So we need to evaluate primary ETFs that hold GME
1118.40s: costs Chewy, which I know Newton has this all already.
1124.72s: And observe behavior of like kind stocks, meaning market cap. And evaluate moves,
1143.36s: move time, move severity and timing.
1155.68s: With respect to GME, loss. Chewy.
1162.32s: Got that down. All right.
1166.40s: Requel discusses the potential for a Requel. Another attempt at Mao-Az, based on recent events like
1173.44s: DIVs, time, meme, and GameStop's Q3 earnings. What does this do? You can like click into it.
1183.28s: Plies the creation redemption formula to predict future potential run dates based on these
1193.68s: events. Okay. Reuterates the thesis that catalyst drive GameStop's runs and emphasizes the
1209.44s: importance of understanding delayed settlement. Encourages readers to use information to level a
1215.20s: plane field. I like that. So then the other thing we have to take a look at is a total list of
1231.92s: expected delayed settlement catalysts, a total list, not the times where we think it worked. So
1240.16s: that's the next piece of homework. Here a total list of expected delayed settlement,
1255.68s: impacts, and track, GME, ETF, and FTD behavior. The reason why I bring that one up,
1270.56s: is because when we did this, I did this with Newton a while ago, and we looked through a bunch of
1279.12s: these. And there are unequivocally instances where things absolutely line up very interestingly.
1290.24s: But the last I looked, there was also a lot of instances where it didn't necessarily so.
1300.32s: And again, the thing that's really important when we're looking at these theories is to try to test
1307.12s: how robust they are. So then because that doesn't mean that the theory doesn't hold even if it's
1311.92s: intermittent, it just means that we would want to treat it differently based on how robust it is.
1319.28s: Like that's literally one of the basis of Kelly sizing for a position. Now again, this is Eric
1324.88s: taking it from the theoretical element back into the trading world, which again, an informing
1330.72s: position sizing based on this stuff. Okay. Get back in the Gemini. And then I'm going to ask it to
1339.28s: expand on all these topics, expand on all of these topics with four to five sentences,
1349.92s: search for any relevant research that might.
1367.12s: All right. While that's running, get that out of the way for a second.
1379.04s: And then I just want to start actually clicking through this thing.
1392.08s: I'm going to show you games that runs are catalyst driven, almost all them can be explained
1396.08s: using two sets of settlement formulas. Actually, these settlement formulas are not you to give me okay.
1411.28s: Although I've tried to speed as subjective factors possible, going to be places where
1414.88s: insurance speculations are okay. So there's settlement. Okay, here we go. What is this one?
1421.76s: Aha. I figured it was some fucking crazy s word because I didn't know what the fuck it was.
1430.40s: Good. That's a, the hell of a fucking place to be in life. That right there.
1440.88s: Oh, I don't know what you guys think about that. That that's a little heavy to be at a spot where
1450.88s: that seems like a good idea. But at least now we know. So 68 running, D.F.E. running,
1461.28s: co-hast, that's funny. Okay, cool. So this, this is good so far. I'm just kind of validating what
1467.44s: Gemini is telling us to make sure that Gemini is also at least moderately accurate.
1473.04s: Pre-date settlement dates T plus 2. This will be probably T plus 1 now. But I think I'm assuming
1479.36s: they're talking about the, the squeeze from early 2020. So that would mean this would apply.
1486.32s: 35 C. Okay, so this is calendar days.
1491.04s: Settlement day plus. Okay, so they're using calendar days here. That's an important differentiation
1495.52s: as well because a lot of the other settlement theories use different combinations of.
1507.44s: Calendar versus trading days.
1514.80s: If you want to, yeah, so they're just using different settlement dates here. You 15 window.
1518.96s: So. Little min occurs throughout the end means that the settlement occurs throughout the entire
1525.04s: duration of this range of dates. P 15 is not only pointing out the 15th day, but the entire range.
1531.36s: Yep. Yeah, okay, so they're capturing that new settlement after the change on 28 May's now T1.
1539.36s: Used to be T2. This is good. S1.
1544.16s: Or just must close out field of deliver.
1547.76s: For a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the
1553.44s: settlement day following the settlement day. So here's this goes back to one of the things when
1560.16s: we did the live stream not that long ago with.
1565.44s: Kevin Malone and PB.
1569.84s: The short theory.
1572.72s: As I look at it historically back at 21, I can see what they're talking about, but I'm very
1581.12s: curious how it applies today as things sit right now because the original premise of this is that
1589.44s: we think. Malas is going to happen or might there might be another version of it that might be
1596.24s: close to Malas, but not quite, you know, because we also had a couple conversations that I still
1602.72s: think are really pertinent for us to discuss internally, which is if structurally,
1611.52s: Malas was short circuited last time, I don't see them allowing it to run further in the future.
1619.12s: That's not to say that it can't happen, but I'm saying that what Malas might look like might
1625.84s: look different than the generalized concept of Malas and the heights that it could reach.
1632.88s: So there could be different versions of what it ultimately ends up being.
1636.88s: So that enters my mind because as I look at these different settlement dates and stuff with
1641.36s: respect to shorts, it begs the question of again, what do we think the probability is that shorts
1649.92s: are still open that they have not covered and to what degree is that the case?
1660.40s: And I don't know the answer, I really don't know the answer, but it's important to identify that
1665.44s: because that wide spread short component is the entire primary driver for this theory,
1677.20s: which is being driven by settlement cycles. Okay, S3 participant has a FTD, they can
1686.00s: demonstrate on its books and records, resulted from a long sale, or that is to attribute
1691.36s: the bona fide marking making activities. The participant must close out, failed to know later
1695.36s: than to begin a regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day. Okay.
1700.88s: If I'll participate of a registered clearing agency as a FTD at a registered clearing agency
1706.00s: in any equity security resulting from sale of a security, that a person is deemed to own
1712.96s: pursuant to rule 200 and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on
1718.32s: delivery have been removed. The participant has been shou by no later than the beginning of the regular
1723.68s: trading hours on the 35th consecutive calendar day following the trade date for the transaction
1730.08s: immediately close out the FTD by purchasing securities of a like kind and quantity.
1736.72s: Additional time to close that out, the fails to deliver resultant from sales, that a person is deemed
1743.04s: to own is provided so that participants can close out such fails with a security sold. So
1751.28s: I think most of us are on generally the same page with this.
1756.32s: If a participant of a registered clearing agency is a FTD position at registered clearing agency
1763.84s: in equity security to rule 144 for 35th and secondment settlement days,
1774.08s: that's annoying. My little thing cut off some of it. Hold on. Let me finish reading this part.
1781.04s: In a sale that actually we can just, that's okay.
1795.52s: So that participants can close out such fails with the security sold as soon as all processing
1800.88s: delays have been removed. That's the wrong one I'm reading. Okay, here we go.
1805.92s: Rule 144 settlement date for a sale in that equity security that the participants shall by no
1816.40s: later than beginning of regular trading hours 36 consecutive settlement day following the settlement
1821.28s: date for the transaction immediately close out. So this is just talking about the date ranges that
1826.48s: have been established. So we continue. Here's the C final ETF rule mentioned above. Okay,
1839.44s: always open links that you don't know what they are. Obviously.
1850.24s: And we have this.
1857.04s: This is a 259 page document.
1865.84s: We'll permit exchange traded funds that satisfy certain conditions to operate without the
1872.40s: expensive delay of obtaining an exemptive order in connection with the final rule.
1877.04s: They will rescind certain exemptive relief that has been granted to ETF insponsors. Okay.
1882.16s: Okay.
1883.04s: Mission is also adopting certain disclosure settlements to form N1A and NAP2 to provide investors who
1891.52s: purchase and sell ETF shares in the secondary market with additional information regarding ETF
1897.52s: trading and associated costs regardless of whether such ETFs are structured as registered, open
1903.44s: ed management companies, investment companies or you investment trusts.
1908.96s: They're also adopting regular amendments for form in-send.
1914.96s: The final rule inform amendments are designed to create a consistent transparent and effective
1919.12s: regulatory framework for ETFs that are organized as open ended funds to facilitate greater competition
1925.12s: and innovation among ETFs. Innovation is good, I suppose. Don't hate innovation.
1930.64s: A. Okay.
1946.16s: We'll need all this.
1954.00s: ETFs will be considered to issue a redeemable security within the meaning of section 2A.
1960.72s: 32 of the ACT.
1964.48s: ETF have features that distinguish them from both traditional open and funds defining feature.
1969.04s: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1975.60s: We believe that there is more probably real for adjusting questions of status by classifying
1981.04s: ETF shares as redeemable security. Okay. So it's talking about redemption creation cycle in
1989.28s: a nutshell. The SEC's final in addition ETF rule, I'd recommend everyone read the SEC
1997.84s: No Action Relief Letter, which is have that already somewhere. Give me a sec. This one.
2010.32s: Request for No Action Relief under Rule 204 of Rage Show with respect to creations of
2015.92s: Covered ETF shares for closed out purposes. Okay.
2025.52s: Rule 204 requires a participant to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for
2031.12s: clearance and settlement on a longer short sale transaction and any equity security by settlement
2037.60s: date or to close out a FTD position at a registered clearing agency.
2044.16s: The
2045.28s: By borrowing or purchasing securities of a like kind quantity this part is so important and there's a
2049.44s: reason why I'm taking the time to go through this with you all directly and it's because
2056.80s: the the broad theory that we're trying to apply here literally hinges on all like all of this
2065.12s: settlement component in timing.
2068.16s: So the rules around the settlement and how they're followed or not followed or
2076.56s: skirted around make this entire they literally make the entire theory.
2082.48s: Now again to reiterate there's two elements to this.
2088.08s: Trying to predict this from a trading perspective is very challenging I think at least.
2096.00s: I think that from a trading perspective it's through much easier ways to try to play the moves
2103.20s: in GameStop. You'll never top tick or bottom ticket but if anybody has showed you that you don't
2108.24s: have to do that it's the cat. You just have to be involved in it. So from a trading perspective
2114.72s: there's a much easier way to do essentially all of this in my opinion and so far it's been the case
2119.76s: from my own experience but the settlement cycle rule abuse in way that ways that different entities
2130.40s: skirt the rules are a bit of a different story and I think that they highlight a lot of broader
2138.00s: structural and integral issues with markets that people should at least be generally aware of.
2144.64s: Again from a trading perspective most of these rules don't really impact most of what we do.
2150.88s: They don't but I think being aware of it is not going to hurt anybody and then if you're looking
2157.68s: to trade things specifically that are the primary profit mechanism are these settlement cycles you
2165.12s: have to understand it's literally the way that the trade is that thought to move.
2171.84s: Okay the participant must close out by no later than beginning regular trading hours of the
2179.76s: settlement day following the settlement date if a participant has an FDD position that they
2184.24s: can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale or it's a tribute to a bona fide
2189.68s: market making activity by registered market maker by registered market maker options market maker
2195.04s: or other market maker obligated to quote in over the counter market the participant must close out
2203.36s: the FDD position by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive day.
2209.44s: Okay so I am going to download a copy of this I'm going to add it to our library. What am I going to
2220.40s: call this this will be no action relief no action relief.
2242.72s: The reason why I'm downloading is because we can also have Gemini help us with this.
2251.36s: Summarize the no action relief letter and then our boy Newton texted me.
2263.92s: Okay.
2277.36s: Okay cool. Oh perfect even better. Our boy I hit Newton up to ask him if he's cool with us
2285.60s: watching some of his videos. Guy I would never want to use somebody else's shit without asking them.
2292.48s: So but he said it's totally cool so I'm going to pull up a couple of his videos now.
2299.76s: Because I have to imagine he's he's I have to imagine I'm reinventing the wheel right now I feel like
2304.80s: he's done this. Essentially provides a no action assurance means that the market participant X
2312.64s: and corn sedited it up. Regarding specific. If the SEC grants the relief.
2325.60s: This doesn't help me this is the wrong thing whatever Gemini.
2332.64s: I'm just scrolling back through I had it before extrapolate out on all these to see what we can learn.
2337.68s: Explain GameStop's price movements suggesting a link between delayed settlements and price surges I can see that.
2346.72s: The 68 allows brokers to request extensions to meet margin calls potentially delaying the impact of market deficiencies in the market.
2355.36s: Okay.
2362.32s: This starts to confound things a lot.
2373.20s: The reason why I think that this starts to confound things a lot is because if we look at oh 68
2379.60s: as it sits here. Then I don't see why the 35 day
2388.56s: settlement cycle wouldn't often change based on people abusing this.
2396.96s: So I don't see why they wouldn't abuse this.
2407.84s: This is just the if these actions triggered margin calls the emoji timeline decoded by the author
2412.88s: adds intriguing layer to the analysis hitting a potential coordinating trading activity.
2417.44s: I'm most interested in this. I'm not even going to lie. I'm probably going to go to that first and
2422.72s: given to my immediate gratification desire. I'm so curious what they think about those.
2429.28s: It seems so many versions of it.
2434.40s: And none of them makes sense to me.
2443.60s: ??
2453.44s: To some Wildebeest Cuts or to Livestream
2472.88s: Where does it see perfectly is the volume of the stuff for the entire 14?
2488.72s: I don't fully understand that.
2502.96s: Nourts must have filed for a REX-068 extension.
2509.84s: The fulfill margin.
2517.36s: See, this is another part that starts to get really confounding to me.
2520.96s: I think that we have to start differentiating between who the shorts are.
2528.00s: Because if this makes me think that people think it's market-making firm
2533.76s: that are the primary shorts and not entities like hedge funds of different sorts that
2541.92s: like Citrone that are trying to short things.
2545.04s: And the reason why that matters is because the way that the rule set is applied is very different
2550.88s: depending on the entity.
2552.56s: This confuses me because if there's a margin deficiency and they file REX-068 extension,
2568.00s: I don't understand why they would go to the stock now and drive the volume.
2574.48s: That doesn't make sense to me.
2576.00s: That's the exact time you don't want to go to the stock.
2580.40s: And this might be the time where they move to a redemption cycle in an ETF of some sort,
2589.12s: so that they don't have to go to the stock.
2592.88s: And I would love to know why that wouldn't happen based on this theory.
2598.64s: I genuinely would because obviously from this person's perspective,
2604.48s: there has to be a logical reason why the participant wouldn't do that.
2608.80s: I just don't know what it is because from my perspective, if we're saying the market makers
2615.28s: as entities are essentially not touching the stock and we're transacting via swaps
2626.00s: and we're transacting via ETF creation redemption cycles so that we don't have to touch the stock.
2632.16s: I don't understand why they're touching the stock here.
2635.60s: This is the exact time you don't want to touch the stock.
2642.16s: So that part, I just don't fully follow.
2647.12s: And the other thing that I generally question that I don't, because here's to be clear,
2654.00s: my opinion, my opinion is I don't see the massive benefit for market makers to remain and hold
2664.24s: massively short positions in GameStop. It's like really arduous for a market maker.
2670.48s: I can see hedge funds doing it or different larger institutions that are trying to
2675.44s: sell or box something. I can absolutely see that. Now I also want to be very clear.
2680.88s: That doesn't mean that I don't think that market makers might have short GameStop positions.
2687.60s: I genuinely have no idea. But when I look at this, it looks like so much of this is based around
2695.60s: the market maker as the primary short participant. And maybe it's just a differing in general premise.
2704.80s: But I would imagine it's closed and hedge funds because they're the ones that have the best
2710.56s: access to black box movements to hide things and to not go on open market to grab shares like
2720.32s: this. So that that part just really, really confuses me. Hold on, Newton texted us.
2728.80s: Newton says, honestly, it's sort of reiterating the ETF can kick in the thing we talked, yeah,
2733.20s: yeah, the thing we talked about before 15 day to 40 windows and 10, 11 day settlement periods.
2738.48s: Pretty excited for the next three weeks. So if we're pretty, yeah, yeah.
2742.72s: Dude, so glad you said that because as I started reading it, I'm about
2755.28s: 40 men in and that's exactly what I'm seeing. My question though,
2768.48s: is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers for hedge funds?
2781.92s: Asking because the settlement cycle ideas would apply differently to the participant.
2793.76s: And also, I'm struggling to understand why in what is this Rexosix 8, Rexosix 8,
2811.84s: we think that's driving volume on the open market to satisfy the margin requirement.
2824.32s: Okay. This is if any of you guys were to ever go through my text conversations with Newton,
2834.56s: it's strings of shit like that that I was just uttering into the mic. He and I spent so much time
2841.04s: just pondering this shit. We're both equally interested in it.
2848.16s: I'm curious what he thinks about that stuff though, like genuinely.
2851.44s: Because I'm assuming it's something that we've thought about in that there's some sort of
2856.88s: explanation that exists for it. I just literally don't know what it is. So I am
2866.00s: pretty confident though that we'll be able to figure it out. So that's one of the questions
2869.28s: I have here. So I'm actually going to add that to my to-do list.
2872.56s: For Rexosix 8, why do we think that the margin satisfaction activity would present on the
2892.80s: open market versus a creation redemption cycle? Who are the primary
2903.52s: shorts? MMs or funds? Okay. Here we go.
2915.52s: BW says, I've been holding cost shares for a year now, 15 undershairs just in case. What are we
2922.64s: talking about right here? Great question. Yeah, that's the trick when you're talking about this
2928.72s: shit is every once in a while you have to take a pause and pull your head out of the fucking sand
2932.88s: and reorient ourselves. So thanks for giving us a, yeah, thanks for giving us an opportunity to do that.
2942.08s: So this is talking about a margin deficiency seemingly that a short market maker might
2953.44s: experience and then the subsequent market impact of them attempting to satisfy the margin
2962.48s: deficiency is now I think that there's quite a few holes in here with this and that doesn't mean
2974.32s: that there's not answers to them. There are just questions that we would want to answer.
2982.56s: And the reason why we want to answer those is because it's a big part of why this thing may or
2988.96s: may not work in the way that we think it may or may not because we're essentially saying that
2994.32s: the volume here is being driven by this margin deficiency satisfaction, which I don't fully follow,
3004.40s: what I want to understand. Jimmy reversed. It's June 1st of the Rex window and by 6 June,
3012.56s: stock was going parabolic. D.F.E brilliantly scheduled his live stream a couple days in the
3020.72s: right, oh, 6, 8 window. Sadly, we'll never know if he was planning to shake his eight ball and
3028.00s: exercise is 120,000 calls on stream that day. Well, we kind of know this because he he didn't have
3033.84s: the money to exercise them. So we do know that he wasn't going to like he absolutely could exercise
3041.04s: a lot of him. He had tons of money in the account, but he definitely couldn't have exercised all of them.
3050.56s: Joseph says, have you gave your outlook for the week? No. So that one will be that live stream is
3056.72s: going to be at 1700. I have three live streams today. I have this one right now. We'll probably go
3061.52s: for like another half hour or so. Then at 1700, I'm doing for everybody on the YouTube channel,
3068.08s: the market outlook for the week to make sure that you all have your marching orders while I am
3074.48s: out freezing and checking out the mountains and Calgary. And then at 1730, so half hour and we're
3082.80s: going to switch over to the Patreon stream. And we're just going to talk about like portfolio
3088.32s: positioning, answer specific questions and stuff like that. So the market outlook will be a little
3094.56s: bit later. Matthew says, just got on happy holidays, Eric and everyone straight up. Thank you,
3098.16s: Matthew and happy holidays to everybody else. Merry Christmas. It's we we like to do a fun thing
3104.80s: for Christmas where I don't like doing all Christmas presents at once. I actually think that
3111.44s: that kind of like burns out your dopamine. And I think that you get less out of each item that
3116.80s: way because it just becomes like another item on top of a mountain of shit you might you might get
3121.12s: if you're fortunate enough to have families that can provide like that. So what I like to do with
3128.32s: Mel is we do like a present a day or it's kind of random to be honest. You just kind of start
3135.04s: depending on how many are under the tree and we never really play in that. And then we have to
3138.96s: plan it around like traveling stuff. So we do like a random number of presents. One of the things though
3145.36s: that Mel got. That's pretty fun is a like a red light therapy thing. It does like
3156.08s: infrared light and then like regular light or near infrared. Anyways, the point I'm telling you
3162.00s: this not that any of you care at all, but it's kind of hilarious. I want to set it up in here once
3166.40s: because it casts a mean red glare. I mean, like lights up the entire room. It's hilarious.
3175.60s: So every time that it she turns it on, if the door's closed, it looks like out of a horror movie or
3181.76s: something. There's just like red glowing lights spewing out through the door. Yeah, it's actually a
3189.92s: more enjoyable gift than I thought it might be. And then the other one that she got before we
3195.52s: get back to this is I got her this really crappy. I mean, she let's be honest, it's more for me
3204.24s: than for her, but she likes Harry Potter. So I got her a Harry Potter wand that like shoots fire,
3210.08s: little fire paper things. And I have been running around the house playing with her wand because
3217.84s: this it works so much better than I ever thought it would have. I thought that it was going to be
3222.64s: a giant piece of crap, not do anything. And it literally shoots fireballs. It is so fun.
3228.24s: Except I started modifying the paper a little bit to make it a little more rambunctious and what
3232.00s: not. But you know, you know, what do you expect? So let us continue with this.
3245.68s: All right, so I'm going to get out of the depths here and then I want to start going through this
3251.04s: stuff. Actually, see what we got.
3267.28s: Here's the, you know, we read all this basically market maker. Yeah, okay, so this confirms part
3272.48s: of my theory is that we think that this is primarily market maker driven,
3283.44s: which actually, I have a buddy that's a market maker. So I'm going to add that to my, I talk to
3290.80s: him like once a month. So I have a list of questions that I ask him typically and I'm going to ask him
3296.32s: the question I'm going to ask him is why would market makers want to remain
3302.96s: systemically short a stock? And that's not that's like any stock.
3310.64s: And I'm also going to ask Chatcha BT this. Why would a market maker
3317.20s: potentially want to remain
3320.40s: systemically short a specific stock? Let's see what this is.
3336.00s: Providing liquidity, managing inventory risk, that's not it. Exploding or evaluation or
3341.44s: mispricing, I think they would have gotten out by now facilitating hedging for other market
3345.68s: participants. That's the most likely so far. I think that's probably the best. That's the best
3357.04s: concept for that that I can think of. Because it depends on hold on.
3364.16s: So it depends on how far into the weeds we're trying to go here. But if we think that there
3387.44s: are market makers that are potentially so far in bed with some hedge funds, then there could be
3399.12s: like that that motivation for a market maker to remain systemically short could be there.
3404.40s: That is a huge leap, which is why and went and got the hat to big leap. But that is objectively
3415.68s: a motivating factor that I could conceive of. Joe says every vacuum I buy breaks, I got four broken
3422.08s: ones. One, that tells you you need to stop doing what we know what you're doing with that vacuum.
3427.92s: You need to stop that. Stop that right now. You're going to burn out the motors,
3431.60s: give the vacuum a break and grab something else that's more suitable to the task. You know what
3437.84s: I'm talking about. Joe and then just get a Dyson. Literally we have, that's all we use is Dyson.
3447.76s: They work fantastic. They always survive whatever you put it through, Joe, whatever you might put it
3456.08s: through. And they're really strong. Go super strong. So I think you just need to upgrade your life
3468.16s: a little bit. Joe says is the guy with a Viking foil hat give me cleaning tips. It's the same
3477.20s: clean and big dog. We are sharing tips here, but not not that one. I'm just trying to save you from
3485.76s: having haven't four broken vacuum sitting around is fucking crazy. That's literally crazy.
3495.20s: Like why would I drove by a vacuum repair shop and I was shook that that is still a business.
3504.56s: I cannot believe that that is still a business. It blows my mind that it literally could be
3512.08s: cheaper to repair an existing vacuum versus just buying a new one in my mind. Vacuums are just
3521.36s: disposable. Jonathan says isn't set at all both a market maker and a hedge fund definitely.
3531.36s: The problem with that if we are applying that theory here is that they're not going to have
3538.48s: margin issues. They're just too big. So even if they're holding a certain amount of this float,
3545.04s: whatever amount of the float that we think short, I don't think that they're going to have margin
3550.88s: issues on the market making side of things. They're just that sizeable because one of the other issues
3559.12s: that I notice we make when we do this slash like have conversations around this is this. Let me grab
3568.48s: my workbook handy dandy workbook. And I want to show you something.
3583.84s: So typically. And now I'm finally at a spot. Okay, this thing gets so hot. Everybody that thinks that
3603.76s: you need like a beanie to warm your head. I'm going to tell you right now you're you're
3610.00s: irrevocably wrong. You need a Viking tinfoil hat that will warm your head in a jiffy.
3618.32s: Super fast. Now let me show you this.
3625.28s: That's not ready. Hold on.
3638.88s: So this is your standard highly rotund market maker.
3660.08s: He has french fries in his pocket.
3671.76s: He has a little table that he carries with lines of coke like that.
3679.28s: And then he has like one of those little silly silly little rascal hats.
3683.92s: Like that. And then he is a little fat eyes that can't even open because there's too much extra skin.
3698.08s: And his face and he's never happy. He's just kind of mute like that. So this is a direct depiction of a
3708.80s: market maker. Now a market maker. They have a little machine.
3720.16s: That makes markets that automatically creates bids and offers for stocks. The thing about market
3732.16s: makers is that they don't typically make bids and offers on just one stock. They make bids and
3743.92s: offers on hundreds. And I'll explain why this matters.
3762.48s: I like how the bid and offer progressively got worse as I went on longer. Here's what happens.
3780.00s: This is stock XYZ. This is stock ABC. This is stock 123.
3791.44s: They're going to go through different order flows for each of these stocks.
3798.56s: So this one they might buy. This one they might sell. This one they might sell.
3803.36s: They're going to have a bunch of different ones of these.
3806.88s: What happens is at the end of the day, they're going to look at their whole book, the entire book.
3813.52s: This entire thing. And they're going to say, what's it look like? What's up?
3824.88s: The reason why this matters is because they're not always making markets on individual securities.
3834.72s: It's actually rarely the case. So when we're talking about them going into especially talking
3841.84s: about a company like Citadel, because Citadel, the market making arm is going to do this on thousands
3848.24s: of stocks. It's literally one of the largest market making firms that exists, thousands of names.
3854.40s: They're going to provide markets on. So in order for them to find themselves in a margin call,
3861.28s: they essentially would have need to completely mismanage risk on this individual position.
3868.32s: And then they would have to have an entire book where nothing is offsetting any of the risk in
3876.08s: that initial position in that other stock. Because when we look at the entire basket of all of the
3881.76s: stuff that they're holding at a given point in time, stock ABC might be beta weighted as 10
3890.64s: spy deltas. It would never be done like this, but it's just for ease of an example.
3896.00s: And then stock 123 might be beta weighted as negative six spy deltas.
3905.04s: So their net exposure, once you consider both of these names, their net exposure is long four.
3913.44s: Beta weighted deltas. So the main point I want you to take away from this is that it's not done in
3924.64s: a vacuum. It's done in a giant bucket with a ton of shit going on behind the scenes.
3936.16s: One of the important elements is the ability for positions to offset risk with one another when
3943.68s: they're looking at the composite of the entire book, which is exactly how a market maker is going
3949.04s: to look at their book. They're going to track the individual positions of course. But they manage
3955.04s: the risk in the aggregate control of the entire book. So risk management literally is how a market
3962.88s: maker extracts their edge from the market because they operate in a near frictionless environment.
3969.12s: They don't make a lot of money for trade. But by providing liquidity through the bit ask spread
3974.96s: and capturing that differential, that's how they make their money. So all that being said, it's exactly
3983.28s: exactly why you have to remember that they're not just making market on one stock and one stock only.
3991.20s: They're making a market on a ton of different things that can have offsetting qualities.
3999.12s: And it's why when you have a massive market maker like Citadel, the probability of them having to
4005.44s: use Rex 068 or something like that would be very small likely. Now there could be strategic reasons
4013.36s: why they might siphon out liquidity to do something like this. But we're getting like super niche
4019.52s: at that point, not saying it could or could not happen. I'm not saying that they may or may not
4023.44s: be implementing it. I don't know. I'm not there. But what I do know is that market makers operate like
4030.48s: this. They're going to be making markets on tons of stocks. The stocks will be looked at individually
4036.72s: and then also in the aggregate. And if the market maker is doing a good job managing their book,
4041.60s: which is the entire way that they make their money, they then will have positions that offset one
4048.16s: another so that they don't run into that situation where they have a margin call. And then to which we
4056.00s: might hypothesize that they're then forced onto the open market to satisfy this requirement.
4063.68s: They would I just have such a hard time seeing why they would put themselves in that scenario.
4070.96s: Okay. So Newton based on the okay. So let me explain the question I asked earlier.
4077.36s: I said my primary thought though is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers or
4081.04s: hedge funds asking because the settlement cycles would apply differently to the participants. I'm
4084.64s: also struggling to understand why in Rex 068 we think that it's driving volume on the open
4089.04s: markets to satisfy the margin requirements. Newton says great question. I had the same. And I
4095.52s: believe this would be a powerful tool for designated market maker to handle CNS FTD settlement
4100.40s: manate to manage large buy-ins over time. The margin deficiency could be the DMM specific
4105.28s: account for that equity. So in this case Citadel in GME big buy aspirin for 50 day to for all.
4112.16s: I see. Interesting. Interesting. I don't see that personally but
4125.76s: again, I don't fucking know. Not gonna pretend to know. But I don't see how that logically would flow
4132.96s: from their perspective. All right. So we have like maybe 10 minutes left. So what I'm going to do is
4139.20s: put an earmark in the rest of this FTD and by the rest of it, I mean literally all of it since
4145.44s: we've only done an overview so far. I'm sorry that I'm so fucking slow with this stuff.
4150.40s: I move slow because I insist on understanding each element of something and it's just time
4158.32s: consuming because one, I'm dumb and it takes me a long time to learn things.
4163.68s: And two, because I try to be thorough and rather than just seeing a hyperlink like this and
4171.52s: just going by and taking somebody at their word for whatever it is. Like I insist on clicking it
4176.80s: and looking at it myself to see exactly what it is. And it's because this is so damn complex
4183.84s: that we can't be lazy in the way that we analyze it if we actually want to understand what's
4189.52s: going on. And again, my desire to understand what's going on isn't to try and trade this.
4195.60s: This isn't how I would try to trade it personally. It's not. This is stuff that I find interesting
4201.04s: from a market structure perspective. The way that I trade things like this is already defined,
4207.04s: it's actually pretty straightforward and easy for me to do. This I'm just very interested in it.
4213.52s: Okay, so this will be our leave off point, leave off point on 22Ds,
4219.60s: post. And that will be my reminder. Super interesting though.
4227.12s: So so far though, if I were to summarize what I'm seeing, this does seem to be generally
4235.20s: highlighting a lot of what Newton has been talking about, which has been the
4241.28s: redemption creation cycles and kind of adding another perspective on it, which is great. I'm very,
4247.04s: very excited to see this. So yeah, the, man, the movement in this has been really interesting.
4257.28s: And from a recent timing perspective, it looks super solid. Let me message TJ really quick.
4263.68s: And I just want to let them know that I started taking a peek at this. I try to follow up with
4270.08s: people that tag me on stuff like that because I like to close the loop. I like to let people know
4273.84s: that if they're going to bother bringing stuff to me, that I'm going to try my best that answer
4278.40s: it when I can. And then try and add some sort of value, which I hope I did. The, the things that I
4287.20s: think would add value in this context is trying to get more specific with understanding how we break
4294.88s: down the perspective shorts in terms of disposition. Do we think that X percent, and this is what I
4301.12s: asked, this is what I asked Kevin and PB because I'm super interested in it because it has a profound
4311.36s: impact on how this whole thing works is who are the shorts and what's their motivation for
4319.60s: remaining short? So yeah, I'm excited to learn a little bit more about that.
4329.28s: Rapture says I want to understand too. So you Gucci. Yeah, that's good. I figured the people
4332.88s: that are coming to hang out here aren't the people that are looking for super bright lights and
4337.68s: flashy things and, you know, just a ton of overall excitement. I think most of the people that
4342.72s: hang out for these streams are more cerebral because we're literally trying to get to the bottom
4347.68s: of something that's super complex and you can't get there quickly. That's just not how this stuff
4352.48s: works. Again, especially if you work with somebody like me, we're going to move slow because I have
4359.04s: to read stuff 62 times before I understand it. I am, I'm a simple man. Archduke PC says just a
4366.96s: quick look. It's super interesting. Wait, what am I supposed to look at? Archduke says, can you take a
4372.16s: look at the DD on archaicos swap? I think I've seen that one. We can definitely go further into
4377.84s: it. But yeah, bring that up to me on the next one of these that we do. And I, so for those that
4384.72s: don't know, I've been doing this live stream every Saturday now for months, literally months.
4390.32s: And the way that it started was looking at every single one of DFV's trade, all of them.
4397.44s: Then after that, I wanted to pivot into the theories due diligence and analysis that's been done.
4403.04s: And we are about halfway through, about halfway through on the diamond book, which I think is a
4414.00s: compilation of several DDs, several, meaning quite a few. Then I need to finish going through the
4421.20s: rest of the DD library. And then, but I'm going to put those on pause to go through the rest of this,
4427.28s: the big DD. And try to see what we can learn. That's the idea. Archduke says, cool. Data dropped on
4436.24s: a Reddit post yesterday. Yeah, if you maintain, if you grab a link of it and you, you hold on to it,
4441.04s: just let me know. And then we can take a look at it together. The problem with swaps, I will continue
4446.48s: to reiterate is that us trying to do anything with swaps, it's good to know that they're there and
4451.76s: that they how they work, but they're beyond that, they're generally meaningless. The reason why I say
4458.40s: that is because they are the epitome of a black box. We have no idea what the structure of the swap
4467.84s: is. They are negotiated between two parties. And the terms are not, we don't see them. They're
4475.84s: it's a negotiated contract. It's a very sophisticated derivative in that it's not standardized.
4483.36s: So the issue with swaps is this idea that as a big swap is coming due and people are going to have
4489.84s: to go to the market to buy stuff, it doesn't fully hold because again, institutions are smart.
4498.80s: If I, Eric, let's literally draw it out. As you all know, I am a, I'm a budding artist and I,
4510.00s: I just need to draw. I think that that's what happens. I just have to let it out via drawing.
4515.76s: If I'm a, if I'm an entity that is on one end of the swap, that would lead me to have to go
4522.56s: buy stock. Let's say that I was going to have to buy stock on this day. And let's say that the
4528.32s: duration of the swap was this period. Do you think that I am going to wait until this day
4537.28s: to buy the swap, to buy the underlying contracts that I would have to hold in order to satisfy my end
4544.96s: of the swap? The answer is unequivocally no. You're not going to wait until the absolute last day
4555.68s: to do something if you are planning to satisfy it in that manner, meaning to go to the open market
4562.88s: to procure shares. It doesn't make sense. Because one, everybody can track it. We can see the dates of
4571.12s: the swaps. So everybody can front run that move. That's, that's the whole point of a swap is for
4577.36s: it to be non-standardized and more difficult to detect so that it can't be front ran. It's the
4584.24s: same thing with dark pools. The, the purpose of those is to attempt to obfuscate movement so that
4592.16s: they can't be front ran. That's a big problem for people that are conducting really big purchases.
4597.12s: So the scenario of somebody that knows that they're going to have to satisfy it by going to
4601.84s: the open market and waiting until the very last day to do so it literally is not logical. I
4606.64s: wouldn't do that as a lay retail trader. There's no way that super smart institutions are just like,
4613.60s: oh yeah, fuck, this just came up on the calendar today. I guess I have to go slam the buy button on
4618.64s: this thing all day today and try to get myself out of it. It just doesn't jive. The next element
4626.32s: the more important element is as this contract is coming due they can write another one.
4637.92s: There's, there are no rules so they can take the same contract they can say,
4642.88s: ah, I still like this. I'm going to roll it out in time and they can do this as much as they want
4648.08s: for whatever reason. We also don't know if there's not an early satisfactory component to the swaps
4655.28s: where if the swap is originally this duration but at this point they're like, ah, let me get out
4661.12s: of the swap. It's done what I needed to do whatever that is and I'm ready to exit the position here.
4667.44s: So that's the that's the problem with swaps is that they are literal black boxes and it does not
4677.44s: surprise me at all to see GameStop and a bunch of other stocks. Again, it's not just GameStop.
4685.20s: There's tons of stocks like this that end up in swaps because it's really advantageous
4690.96s: for people that are trying to do things with GameStop to use swaps to do them because they are
4697.52s: a black box. So yeah, I would love to take a look at whatever the swap DD that came out from
4706.24s: Arcagos but my expectation is that in terms of utility it will be quite limited for us and
4715.92s: it's I would love for them to be more useful but I can definitely tell you I even on the
4722.08s: livestream with PBISdom if I could take a look at the broader data set and see if I can come up
4728.00s: with anything because I already know parts of what I'm going to find. I know that I'm going to find
4734.72s: entirely mixed bag of stuff but if I can find anything with a decent correlation coefficient,
4742.16s: I still would try to do something with that because why wouldn't we?
4747.12s: The thing again, the difference between trading and a perfect science is trading is the art of
4756.16s: using imperfect information to come up with ideas. So for example, if I found some sort of correlation
4766.16s: between a certain day of the week and something happened in the market and hint hint, I've done this
4771.04s: before. I will use that. Do I fully know why the day of the week does something? Do I fully understand
4777.84s: that the background behind it? More often than not know but it doesn't matter to me. I'm just
4782.64s: trying to trade the effect. Now you can go back later and figure out that some of it are window
4787.52s: dressing effects and there's other things that lead to behavior like that but it typically doesn't
4793.68s: last forever. It could just be that there's a specific fund that's trying to gain entry into
4797.68s: something and they're scaling in over time or whatever the case is. The point I'm trying to make
4802.24s: is that even if it's a loose correlation, it's still a correlation and it's something that we
4806.24s: should take a look at. I got something in my eye. So I'm hopeful that with the swaps, we might be
4812.32s: able to find something. I just don't know what but I don't think that they're quite as
4819.28s: informative. I think as people are hoping for them to be.
4824.40s: Archduke PC says the swap dates have already expired. Correlated big GM, GME moves like
4829.60s: May this year in the sneeze seat, but that's the problem is that we're what we're doing is we're
4835.84s: overfitting at that point because guess also what happened during those periods supposedly,
4842.00s: obnox tailwinds, settlement periods also happened. We also had massive options trading activity.
4849.76s: We also now have apparently Rex 068. So the problem is what we're doing is we're looking
4856.64s: historically at really strange scenarios and then we're trying to isolate what caused the scenario
4865.04s: and in reality, it's overwhelmingly likely a contributing factor driven by a ton of this
4871.28s: shit. Different elements of all of these things coalescing at a specific period in time.
4876.48s: Markets are not vacuums. Markets will continue to be extremely complex places that will always have
4883.28s: these quirky style movements because of that. Now again, we should always look at this stuff and
4889.12s: we should look at swaps. I've spent a long time looking at swaps because I find them very interesting
4892.96s: and even if they have a 10% input potential into a model like this, I'm certainly interested in
4899.68s: that. But based on the original analysis that I've done, I just hadn't seen a massive input
4907.04s: personally, but definitely open to it. And I hope that there is because the more observable
4914.08s: elements that we can clearly identify positive correlation with, then the more predictable the
4918.88s: event becomes, which is literally good for everybody. It doesn't fall on deaf ears that I know
4930.72s: so many traders are trying to use GameStop as a way to change their current life.
4937.92s: Now, it's not my approach. I would love for them to have a different approach personally.
4942.88s: That's not to say don't trade GameStop, but I would just love for people to have a slightly
4947.28s: higher probability approach to achieving that. But nonetheless, it is what it is.
4957.12s: So a big reason why I spend so much time on this stuff is not just born out of my personal
4962.88s: curiosity, but it's because I know that there are a lot of people that quite literally their
4968.72s: livelihoods depend on elements of this. And I want nothing more than for them to succeed.
4974.24s: I already told you this is not this the way that I trade GameStop is completely different than
4978.72s: all of this stuff. And GameStop is still a small part of my book. It just is what it is. My primary
4985.60s: purpose is I'm a trader. It's literally how I make a living. So I have to do things in a way that
4990.24s: work for me. But I recognize that other people have different imperatives. And I see a lot of people
4997.68s: trying to do something big with this. And I want them to I want them to have a solid, a solid
5006.24s: approach. And something that makes sense for them. Starbeef, which is a hell of a name.
5012.72s: Starbeef says, this is why I hope moving forward you you use less Newton texting. A lot of these
5018.56s: debunked theories people are saying come from Newton. He still pumps T35 and daily emphasize
5024.32s: emphasis on Max Payne. Oh, fuck no. There's a 0% chance that I'm going to use less Newton.
5031.68s: It's an information source. He and I don't agree on all of the elements of GameStop.
5037.68s: It's and that's okay. We don't have to. But the way that you move closer to objective truth
5044.40s: is through multiple information sources. So as long as he still remains like the completely grounded
5052.96s: awesome dude that he is, there's no reason why I would stop listening to his opinion of things.
5059.44s: He's he's literally in my opinion is like that the GameStop scribe. That's what I call him the GameStop
5065.44s: scribe. And it's because he spent so much time collating all of this different data about GameStop.
5071.84s: So there's no way that I would turn down the intelligence that he can provide. But as you can tell,
5078.88s: I don't take him at his word or anybody at their word. You shouldn't. You should do your own research.
5085.04s: But it's like it's the same thing in the military. Like we wouldn't turn down any intel.
5091.20s: We'll listen to all of it. We're going to screen it. We're going to apply our thought process
5096.56s: and our analysis to it as we should. But there's absolutely no reason why I would turn off an
5103.84s: information source because what he does is at least researched and tracked. It's not completely
5112.08s: random. Now it's the same thing I noticed with other people that I'll interact with. And you
5116.80s: guys will hear me do this. I will say, is this something we can prove or is this a hunch or is
5124.24s: this a theory? And the reason why I asked that question one is to check the framing of things so
5131.68s: that people aren't misled. But the second is also to test the person. And how effective is the
5140.72s: person at differentiating reality from something that we might think to be the case? Because something
5147.44s: that we can objectively prove is different than a theory or something like that. So yeah, I
5156.40s: totally dig new. I think he's rad. So yeah, I'm 100% going to ask his opinion on stuff like this,
5162.32s: especially in things that I think he knows more than me for sure. And then I will always,
5168.00s: I will always backcheck everything. You guys see me do that literally with everything because it's
5173.44s: how I apply my process. So yeah. Rapsha. Starbeef says this is why I hope, oh, I already read that.
5184.48s: Matthew says you're a good person Eric never changed. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
5187.84s: I hope to be. And I hope to continue changing. But hopefully for the better. Rapsha says even if
5194.08s: Newton is wrong, it's how we learn, I agree. Newton's data isn't his theories could possibly be,
5198.24s: but not the data he's noted. I don't know what that pertains to. Sorry, I probably move past it too
5205.84s: fast. Notion says, is market energy me going to rip or crash on my Instagram question? We're actually
5211.12s: going to take a look at that in a half hour. So on the 1700 live stream, I'm going to go through
5216.88s: the market prep for the week. And then when I get back from traveling, what not, I'm going to start
5223.36s: a daily live stream every single day for the YouTube channel. And then the outlier pro live streams
5228.96s: will still be on Sunday and Wednesday. I might actually bump up the frequency and just cut back
5236.56s: the time on some of the other ones so that we can cover a little disparate data because for the
5241.68s: pro live streams, we get more into like my specific portfolio, actual trades, trade adjustment,
5246.32s: stuff like that. And then working through individual people's trades as well to try and help. And then
5251.44s: on the main channel, we do more broad analysis. We do scanning. We do like theoretical learning
5258.24s: and stuff like that because I think that that's timeless applicable to everybody. And I
5262.72s: my original objective for doing this whole thing is not changed, which is hopefully to spread
5267.20s: and share information for people to arrive at their own conclusions for stuff.
5274.00s: So thank you all for hanging out for being a part of the game. And also thank you for
5279.04s: helping me learn. I enjoy this very much. I will see whoever wants to pop out for the market update
5285.12s: or for the market outlook live stream in a half hour. We're going to look through the market as a whole,
5289.36s: look through some news. See what's going on with the broad market. And then the pro members,
5294.40s: I'll catch you all at 1730 to go through some portfolio updates and whatnot. So we are packed.
5301.84s: We out here. I'll see you all in a little bit. Be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier, ape,
5306.48s: be whatever makes you happy. I'll see y'all later.
