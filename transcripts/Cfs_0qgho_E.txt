0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.24s:  what together we hold on forever.
93.22s:  So, we're opening up up the
97.60s:  box.
99.60s:  You've already heard what's
101.08s:  up
107.40s:  Zero...
109.64s:  What's up everybody?
110.70s:  We are on the regular setup
111.32s:  right now home for a short
113.84s:  layover before heading over to
117.20s:  Kellery for while
117.48s:  little bit weird. I think I have a little bit of congestion from traveling, generally
122.12s:  feel okay. And thankfully, because I started doing a little bit of homework on a tweet
133.12s:  that somebody tagged me in. Where is it? This one. Let me show you guys. So there was
142.68s:  my business chilling. And then I was tagged by the hell of a long, I'm going to just go
151.60s:  with TJ. TJ is pretty brief. So just go to TJ. There's a lot more numbers though.
158.92s:  And TJ was seeing if we could take a look at it. And the answer is absolutely. I am infatuated
170.96s:  with learning more about markets and pretty much everything I can get my hands on. And I
176.12s:  have a deep appreciation for anybody that puts anything together that's even moderately
182.44s:  well developed because it takes a lot of time and effort. So it is super clear that as
188.64s:  I pop this open, I didn't go through it yet at all. But one thing I can say is it is
194.08s:  not a brief document. It's 44 pages. So it tells me somebody put time into this. And
200.40s:  I immediately treat that with respect with respect because especially looking at something
205.24s:  like GameStop, there are so many theories, so many avenues twists and turns that make
213.72s:  it pretty difficult to truly identify what's going on. And I'm always eager to see what
221.40s:  people are digging up. Now a couple admin notes. I approach this kind of stuff with a really
229.88s:  poor version, like a semi varied version of the scientific method. And I try to look
238.52s:  for in the military, we would refer to them as capabilities, critical vulnerabilities,
248.76s:  centers of gravity that those are just terminology frameworks in my mind, centers of gravity
254.20s:  are things that really bolster the concept or the thing critical vulnerabilities are gaps
259.00s:  things that we're taking leaps to come up with what we might be thinking is going on.
264.84s:  And I try to look at it as objectively as possible and something like GameStop has a lot
272.84s:  to it. So all that aside, I am very much a trader. So there's two parts of my brain when I look
284.76s:  at this. There is the part that is looking for how do I trade this thing? And then there's the
289.32s:  part that is just interested in how this thing behaves and moves. And this is more to dive into
297.48s:  the latter element. People have asked me a bunch of times, especially people that are more
305.80s:  familiar with more of my broader content, which is just about options trading. Why I'm so interested
313.08s:  in GameStop. And I will always reiterate the point for everybody because I think it's important
317.88s:  to continue to promulgate this message. GameStop can teach you a lot about markets that you otherwise
324.84s:  never would come across. And I know that from firsthand experience. It has taught me a tremendous
331.96s:  amount. And I do not have even a monochem of the answers, but I look to explore them with you all.
342.12s:  So giant preamble aside, let us get set up on the main screen. And then we'll start digging into
352.84s:  this bad boy. All right. Now I'm assuming I have to assume, I have to assume Newton has
367.56s:  already looked at this. And I grabbed his Google sheet because he has everything that I can think
377.16s:  of with respect to things about settlement, which I have to assume. That's what a lot of this
382.60s:  document is going to be about settlement. Again, I haven't read through it yet. I'm just guessing
387.24s:  because that seems to be the biggest focus that I find when I look at the computer, look in the
392.04s:  community. So with that, with that note, at least. Okay. Yeah. So Robert says yes,
402.92s:  Newton reviewed it. Yeah. Okay. It makes perfect sense. I would appeal to Newton's understanding of
409.00s:  this stuff over my own, specifically with respect to settlement and whatnot. He's been spending way
415.08s:  more time and effort looking into the dates, the relationship between dates. I won't hold a candle
421.40s:  to what he can identify. I will do my best to see what I can see with my own eyes, hopefully offer
428.20s:  a little bit of value for the broader analysis. But I absolutely think he will be the main dude I
435.96s:  would take a look at. Maybe even during this, we'll pull up a couple of his videos and just scroll
440.84s:  through them because I respect his opinion on this stuff tremendously. All right. So
447.48s:  let's get this thing started. I'm going to zoom this in a little bit so it's easier for you guys to see.
456.84s:  And then the other thing I'm going to do to prime myself is I'm actually going to upload a version
464.52s:  into chat GPT and have chat GPT start to summarize it. It says file is too large.
477.48s:  As per I'll probably have to split it up. Okay. Let's see. Let's see if this thing can
485.64s:  summarize it. It's only 44 pages.
493.24s:  Rapture says would jump. Oh, great point Gemini. Look in W's for Gemini.
498.60s:  Because I already have it uploaded and I already have it configured.
515.96s:  All right. Let me delete this and then let me let me this is upload an image. I want it to look at a file.
529.08s:  And review the file named the big DD and provide a summary. Let's see if I can do that.
542.76s:  Right now Gemini. Yo, W's for raptures. It looks like it looks like Gemini will be our answer.
564.84s:  Here.
574.84s:  So let's see what else we can extrapolate out of this thing.
582.36s:  Great. A bulletin list of each of the main topics with the porting summary.
591.08s:  To be clear, I'm going to go through this whole thing. I do this to help prime what I'm going to be
595.96s:  looking at. Again, especially when it's something that I'm less familiar with,
600.68s:  priming my brain helps me a lot. So that's that's all I'm doing right now.
607.40s:  All right. Let's see if this can continue on that.
610.68s:  And then I'm just going to join this up with the other windows I have.
619.64s:  So let the raw consolidated window.
628.44s:  All right. How sick is this?
634.84s:  You get plus two fake internet points because that was a massive recommendation.
647.56s:  Shout out, raptures.
651.88s:  The reason I'm so stoked on this is because this I have in my Google Drive, I have links to
659.72s:  hundreds of different studies about things that impact settlement, GameStop,
666.68s:  SEC, filings. So I will be able to query this against all of that, which I'm pretty excited about.
676.28s:  Let's see what we see from a high level overview first.
680.44s:  So from a settlement perspective, it says explains the basics of settlement theory.
685.56s:  Well, you expected to see this, including trade date, settlement date,
689.96s:  different settlement rules defined by the SEC for those that are unfamiliar with what this all
697.16s:  means. It is everything to do with FTDs and it does everything to do with moving the obligation to
706.28s:  acquire shares around. So this is relationships between entities like market makers, authorize
713.48s:  participants, stuff like that. This is explores an interesting finding about ETF in a no action
720.36s:  relief letter. I literally, I literally saw this on Newton sheet and I expected that to have
730.68s:  something to do with this. So I assume this is what this is referring to.
737.32s:  We're a market maker, software permission to use irrevocable ETF creation orders to satisfy
742.36s:  FTDs. Okay. Oofing a term used to describe delayed settlement mechanism affecting stocks.
752.60s:  GameStop runs are driven by catalysts and can be explained using two sets of settlement formulas,
758.36s:  S final, S final. So T1 plus 2, that's initial settlement. T2 35 C and 35 C minus 1.
770.20s:  That'll have to do with the 35 day settlement cycle. And then T3 plus 2, I imagine that's moving back
784.28s:  to an authorized participant potentially. So I think this is talking about the bouncing of
794.04s:  settlement requirements, essentially kicking, this is like the kicking the can idea. As far as I
801.00s:  can tell, I again, we'll get way more into details. I crack into this thing. This is just at a
806.60s:  super high level overview based on two sentences that I'm seeing. So I can be 100% wrong.
812.28s:  Want to be super clear. Speculates market makers using mechanical mechanism similar TTF
819.40s:  creation approach. So this is the ETF creation redemption using ETFs that hold baskets, ETF holds
825.40s:  baskets of different stocks. And you can, the theory is you can use ETFs that hold something like
832.20s:  GameStop to satisfy locates and stuff like that. So totally understand what they're talking about here.
838.68s:  RexO6-8, this is funny because Newton and I a long time ago we were talking about RexO6-9. So I
846.52s:  don't know much about this one. Discusses margin deficiencies, specifically O6-8, detailed
855.24s:  explanation of margin, margin deficiencies, how they are calculated. Explains how RexO6-8 allows
862.20s:  firms to request extensions of time for satisfying margin deficiencies, granting them in additional
867.40s:  14 days. Yep, that makes sense. So this is another exemption that's provided for entities. It's
878.60s:  almost like extending a line of credit. Following along with this so far, I'm going to ask it
885.72s:  another couple questions once I get through all these. Analyze several GameStop runs.
892.04s:  Including the squeeze, the Fedwire, Mario Day run, and the Wombo combo,
900.68s:  contributing them to catalysts in their effect.
906.04s:  Okay, provides a detailed breakdown of each run highlighting the role of essentially the,
915.16s:  I don't know what this boofing term is. It's just like a redemption creation cycles.
925.48s:  RexO6-8 and other factors like options, activity, and market sentiment. Okay.
934.12s:  Examines, two big runs in 24 associated with DFV's return, including run, low, low, run, and
940.92s:  the DFV's return of 68, RexO6-8. Explains how DFV's return and trading activity triggered
947.48s:  margin deficiencies and RexO6-8 extensions leading to increased volume and volatility.
955.24s:  Solves the emoji. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually very excited to see what this talks about
961.00s:  with respect to this emoji timeline. I've seen so many people guessing at what this thing is.
966.20s:  Revealing it as a countdown to potential MoAsdates, July 3rd and 5th, 24,
975.64s:  really interested in that. The reason I'm so interested in that is because that's so far out from now.
987.08s:  Wait, does that mean 24, 25? I think this might mean 25.
996.84s:  Cost and Chewy provides additional examples of runs on cost and Chewy, demonstrating
1003.56s:  creation redemption and O6-8 are not unique to GME.
1007.88s:  Highlights the rising floor pattern and cost, suggesting it aligns with lock the float theory.
1014.76s:  Fascinating.
1018.60s:  The, I mean, for my understanding specifically with the involvement of cost and Chewy,
1024.60s:  I've always just took that as their part of the ETF creation redemption cycles.
1029.56s:  So, if they're bundled in an ETF that is affected by the creation redemption cycle,
1036.92s:  now the one thing that I haven't done that we as a community have to do is we have to look at
1044.12s:  the other names in those ETFs. We can't just look at the names that were interested in.
1048.52s:  We can't just look at cost Chewy GameStop and say, okay, when we go through these ETF
1053.96s:  redemption creation cycles, do those move because if the theory holds, then it should broadly apply
1062.52s:  to most of the names in an ETF. Now, I would feel comfortable restricting it slightly, of course,
1070.36s:  because things like cost Chewy GameStop, they're not mega cap stocks. I mean, GameStop is like
1077.00s:  a mid cap stock now, but I mean, generally we refer to them as small caps. So, because of that,
1086.92s:  that's a big RFI request for information. That's like a big piece of homework that I think we have
1093.48s:  to do. So, I'm actually going to take a couple notes here and create a little bit of a to-do list.
1107.16s:  Right. So, we need to evaluate primary ETFs that hold GME,
1118.44s:  cost Chewy, which I know Newton has this all already. And observe behavior of like kind stocks,
1136.52s:  meaning market cap and market cap and evaluate moves, move time, move severity and timing.
1155.64s:  With respect to GME, loss Chewy. Got that down. All right.
1167.32s:  Req will discusses the potential for a Req will. Another attempt at Mao-Az, based on recent events
1173.24s:  like DIVs, time, meme, and GameStop's Q3 earnings. What does this do? You can like click into it.
1183.24s:  Plyze, the creation redemption formula to predict future potential run dates based on these events.
1196.52s:  Okay. Reuterates the thesis that Catalyst Drive GameStop runs and emphasizes the importance
1209.80s:  of understanding delayed settlement, encourages readers to use information to level the playing field.
1216.20s:  I like that. So, then the other thing we have to take a look at is
1226.68s:  a total list of expected delayed settlement catalysts, a total list, not the times where we think
1239.24s:  it worked. So, that's the next piece of homework. Here a total list of expected delayed settlement
1251.88s:  impacts,
1257.72s:  intract,
1260.20s:  Dami,
1262.44s:  ETF,
1264.28s:  and FDD
1266.36s:  behavior. The reason why I bring that one up is because when we did this, I did this with
1273.88s:  Newton a while ago. And we looked through a bunch of these. And there are unequivocally instances
1285.24s:  where things absolutely line up very interestingly. But the last I looked, there was also a lot of
1294.12s:  instances where it didn't necessarily so. And again, the thing that's really important when we're
1303.96s:  looking at these theories is to try to test how robust they are. So then because that doesn't
1310.12s:  mean that the theory doesn't hold even if it's intermittent, it just means that we would want to
1314.20s:  treat it differently based on how robust it is. Like that's literally one of the basis of
1321.32s:  Kelly sizing for a position. Now again, this is Eric taking it from the theoretical element back
1327.64s:  into the trading world, which again, informing position sizing based on this stuff.
1333.88s:  Okay. Get back in the Gemini. And then I'm going to ask it to expand on all these topics,
1341.08s:  expand on all of these topics with
1345.88s:  four to five sentences.
1352.76s:  Search for any relevant
1362.36s:  research that might
1367.16s:  be
1373.00s:  all right. While that's running, get that out of the way for a second.
1379.08s:  And then I just want to start actually clicking through this thing.
1392.12s:  I'm going to show you games up runs are catalyst driven, almost all them can be explained
1396.04s:  using two sets of settlement formulas. Actually, these settlement formulas are not you to give me okay.
1411.24s:  Although I've tried to speed as subjective factors possible, going to be places where I insert on
1415.24s:  speculations, okay. So there's settlement. Okay, here we go. What is this one? Aha. I figured it was
1425.56s:  some fucking crazy s word because I didn't know what the fuck it was. Good. That's a
1435.64s:  the hell of a fucking place to be in life. That right there. Huh. I don't know what you guys
1446.28s:  think about that. That that's a little heavy to be at a spot where that seems like a good idea.
1453.96s:  But at least now we know. Rex O68 running D.F.E. running.
1461.24s:  Co has that's funny. Okay, cool. So this this is good so far. I'm just kind of validating what
1467.40s:  Gemini's telling us to make sure that Gemini's also at least moderately accurate.
1473.00s:  Pre date settlement dates T plus two. This will be probably T plus one now. But I think I'm assuming
1479.40s:  they're talking about the the squeeze from early 2020. So that would mean this would apply
1486.36s:  35 C. Okay, so this is calendar days.
1491.08s:  Settlement day plus. Okay, so they're using calendar days here. That's an important differentiation
1495.48s:  as well because a lot of the other settlement theories use different combinations of
1500.44s:  calendar versus trading days.
1514.84s:  If you want to yeah, so they're just using different settlement dates here.
1517.88s:  You 15 window. Settlement occurs throughout the end means that the settlement occurs throughout
1524.52s:  the entire duration of this range of dates. P 15 is not only pointing out the 15th day, but the
1530.44s:  entire range. Yep. Yeah, okay, so they're capturing that new settlement after the change on 28
1537.96s:  Mays now T one used to be T two. This is good. S one. Or just must close out failed to deliver
1547.80s:  for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the
1553.48s:  settlement day following the settlement day. So here's this goes back to one of the things when
1560.12s:  we did the live stream not that long ago with Kevin Malone and PB. The short theory as I look at it
1573.88s:  historically back at 21, I can see what they're talking about, but I'm very curious how it applies
1583.32s:  today as things sit right now because the original premise of this is that we think Moas is going
1592.12s:  to happen or might there might be another version of it that might be close to Moas, but not quite,
1598.04s:  you know, because we also had a couple conversations that I still think are really
1603.40s:  pertinent for us to discuss internally, which is if structurally Moas was short-circuited last time,
1614.92s:  I don't see them allowing it to run further in the future. That's not to say that it can't happen,
1621.40s:  but I'm saying that what Moas might look like might look different than the generalized concept
1629.72s:  of Moas and the heights that it could reach. So there could be different versions of what it
1634.76s:  ultimately ends up being. So that enters my mind because as I look at these different settlement
1640.52s:  dates and stuff with respect to shorts, it begs the question of again, what do we think the
1647.80s:  probability is that shorts are still open that they have not covered and to what degree is that the case?
1660.44s:  And I don't know the answer. I really don't know the answer, but it's important to identify that
1665.48s:  because that wide spread short component is the entire primary driver for this theory, which is
1677.56s:  being driven by settlement cycles. Okay, S3 participant has a FTD. They can demonstrate on its books
1687.24s:  and records resulted from a long sale or that is the Tribunal bonafide market making activities.
1693.08s:  The participant must close out failed to deal with no later than beginning with regular trading hours
1696.76s:  on third consecutive settlement day. Okay. If I'll participate of a registered clearing agency as a
1703.48s:  FTD at a registered clearing agency in any equity security resulting from sale of a security,
1709.96s:  that a person is deemed to own pursuant to rule 200. And that such person intends to deliver
1716.92s:  as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed. The participant shall by no later than
1722.76s:  the beginning of the regular trading hours on the 35th consecutive calendar day following the trade
1728.84s:  date for the transaction immediately close out the FTD by purchasing securities of a like kind and
1735.40s:  quantity. Additional time to close that out. The fails to deliver result from sales that a person
1742.68s:  is deemed to own is provided so that participants can close out such fails with a security sold.
1748.92s:  So I think most of us are on generally the same page with this.
1758.28s:  If a participant of a registered clearing agency is a FTD position at registered
1763.08s:  clearing agency in an equity security to rule 144 for 35th consecutive settlement days,
1773.08s:  that's annoying. My little thing cut off some of it. Hold on. Let me finish reading this part.
1782.04s:  In a sale that actually we can just, that's okay.
1795.56s:  So that participants can close out such fails with the security sold as soon as all processing
1800.92s:  delays have been removed. That's the wrong one I'm reading. Okay, here we go.
1807.64s:  Rule 144 settlement date for a sale in that equity security that the participant shall by no
1816.36s:  later than beginning of regular trading hours 36 consecutive settlement day following the settlement
1821.32s:  date for the transaction immediately close out. So this is just talking about the date ranges
1826.36s:  that have been established. So we continue. Here's this to see final ETF rule mentioned above.
1837.80s:  Okay, always open links that you don't know what they are. Obviously.
1850.28s:  And we have this.
1857.08s:  This is a 259 page document.
1865.96s:  We'll permit exchange traded funds that satisfy certain conditions to operate without the
1872.44s:  expensive delay of obtaining an exemptive order in connection with the final rule.
1877.00s:  They will rescind certain exemptive relief that has been granted to ETF insponsors. Okay.
1882.20s:  Okay.
1883.08s:  Mission is also adopting certain disclosure settlements to form N1A and NAP2 to provide investors
1891.32s:  who purchase and sell ETF shares in the secondary market with additional information regarding ETF
1897.56s:  trading and associated costs regardless of whether such ETFs are structured as registered, open
1903.48s:  ed management companies, investment companies or you and investment trusts.
1907.96s:  There are also adopting regular amendments for form insan.
1914.92s:  The final rule and form amendments are designed to create a consistent transparent and
1918.76s:  effective regulatory framework for ETFs that are organized as open ended funds to facilitate
1923.64s:  greater competition and innovation among ETFs. Innovation is good, I suppose. Don't hate innovation.
1930.60s:  A. Okay.
1946.20s:  We'll need all this.
1953.96s:  ETFs will be considered to issue a redeemable security within the meaning of section 2A.
1960.76s:  32 of the act.
1964.52s:  ETF have features that distinguish them from both traditional open and funds defining feature.
1969.08s:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1975.56s:  We believe that there is more probably real for adjusting questions of status by classifying
1981.08s:  ETF shares as redeemable security. Okay. So it's talking about redemption creation cycle
1989.00s:  in a nutshell.
1993.32s:  The SEC's final in addition ETF rule. I'd recommend everyone read the SEC No Action Relief
1998.76s:  letter, which is have that already somewhere. Give me a sec. This one.
2010.28s:  Request for No Action Relief under Rule 204.
2013.88s:  Show with respect to creations of covered ETF shares for closed out purposes.
2019.80s:  Okay.
2025.48s:  Rule 204 requires a participant to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance
2031.56s:  and settlement on a longer short sale transaction and any equity security by settlement date
2038.84s:  or to close out a FTD position at a registered clearing agency
2045.16s:  by borrowing or purchasing securities of a like kind quantity. This part is so important.
2049.00s:  And there's a reason why I'm taking the time to go through this with you all directly.
2053.64s:  And it's because the broad theory that we're trying to apply here literally hinges on all
2064.20s:  like all of this settlement component in timing.
2070.12s:  So the rules around the settlement and how they're followed or not followed or
2076.60s:  skirted around make this entire they literally make the entire theory.
2082.52s:  Now again, to reiterate, there's two elements to this.
2087.16s:  Trying to predict this from a trading perspective is very challenging, I think at least.
2096.92s:  I think that from a trading perspective, it's through much easier ways to try to play the moves
2103.24s:  in GameStop. You'll never top tick or bottom ticket. But if anybody has showed you that you don't
2108.28s:  have to do that, it's the cat. You just have to be involved in it. So from a trading perspective,
2114.68s:  there's a much easier way to do essentially all of this in my opinion. And so far,
2118.44s:  it's been the case from my own experience. But the settlement cycle,
2126.04s:  rule abuse, in way that ways that different entities skirt the rules are a bit of a different story.
2134.20s:  And I think that they highlight a lot of broader structural and integral issues with markets
2140.60s:  that people should at least be generally aware of. Again, from a trading perspective,
2146.52s:  most of these rules don't really impact most of what we do. They don't. But I think being aware of
2155.16s:  it is not going to hurt anybody. And then if you're looking to trade things specifically that are
2162.12s:  the primary profit mechanism are these settlement cycles. You have to understand it's literally
2166.84s:  the way that the trade is thought to move. Okay. The participant must close out by no later than
2177.96s:  beginning regular trading hours of the settlement day following the settlement date. If a participant
2182.60s:  has an FDD position that they can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale.
2188.20s:  Or it's attributable to a bona fide market making activity by registered market maker,
2192.52s:  by a registered market maker, options market maker or other market maker obligated to quote in
2198.92s:  over the counter market, the participant must close out the FDD position by no later than the
2206.36s:  beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive day. Okay. So I am going to download a
2214.36s:  copy of this. I'm going to add it to our library. What am I going to call this? This will be
2227.64s:  no action relief. No action relief.
2232.52s:  The reason why I'm downloading is because we can also have Gemini help us with this.
2248.76s:  Summarize the no action relief letter. And then our boy Newton texted me.
2263.00s:  Okay. Cool. Oh, perfect. Even better. Our boy. I hit Newton up to ask him if he's cool with us
2285.64s:  watching some of his videos. Guy, I would never want to use somebody else's shit without asking them.
2292.44s:  So, but he said it's totally cool. So I'm going to pull up a couple of his videos now.
2299.72s:  Because I have to imagine he's I have to imagine I'm reinventing the wheel right now. I feel like he's
2305.24s:  done this. Essentially provides a no action assurance means that the market participant X and
2312.68s:  corn sedited it. Regarding specific. If the SEC grants the relief. This doesn't help me. This
2326.52s:  is the wrong thing. Whatever. Gemini. I'm just scrolling back through. I had it before
2335.16s:  extrapolate out on all these to see what we can learn. Explain GameStop's price movements
2343.64s:  suggesting a link between delayed settlements and price surges. I can see that.
2349.16s:  Who's six eight allows brokers to request extensions to meet margin calls, potentially delaying
2353.08s:  the impact of market deficiencies in the market.
2355.56s:  Okay. This starts to confound things a lot.
2373.24s:  The reason why I think that this starts to confound things a lot is because if we look at
2377.72s:  oh six eight as it sits here, then I don't see why the 35 day settlement cycle wouldn't often
2393.08s:  change based on people abusing this. So I don't see why they wouldn't abuse this.
2407.88s:  It's just the of these actions triggered margin calls, the emoji timeline decoded by the author
2412.84s:  adds intriguing layer to the analysis, hitting a potential coordinating trading activity. I'm
2417.72s:  most interested in this. I'm not even gonna lie. I'm probably gonna go to that first and
2422.68s:  give into my immediate gratification desire. I'm so curious what they think about those
2428.12s:  of them. It seems so many versions of it. And none of them makes sense to me.
2442.60s:  Do you have any other questions?
2452.28s:  Do you have any other questions?
2473.08s:  I'm gonna go to 68, apparently. Perfectly is the volume of the stock elevated for the entire 14.
2485.88s:  I don't I don't fully understand that.
2502.92s:  Nords must have filed for a Rex 068 extension.
2509.80s:  The fulfill margin.
2517.32s:  See, this is another part that starts to get really confounding to me. I think that we have to
2522.84s:  start differentiating between who the shorts are. Because if this makes me think that people think
2531.80s:  it's market making firm that are the primary shorts and not entities like hedge funds of
2540.36s:  different sorts that like citrone that are trying to short things. And the reason why that
2546.04s:  matters is because the way that the rules set is applied is very different depending on the entity.
2552.52s:  This confuses me because if there's a margin deficiency and they file Rex 068 extension.
2568.04s:  I don't understand why they would go to the stock now and drive the volume.
2574.52s:  That doesn't make sense to me. That's the that's the exact time you don't want to go to the stock.
2580.44s:  And this might be the time where they move to a redemption cycle in a ETF of some sort so that
2589.48s:  they don't have to go to the stock. Now there could be and I would love to know why that doesn't why
2595.56s:  that wouldn't happen based on this theory. I genuinely would because obviously from this person's
2603.48s:  perspective, there has to be a logical reason why the participant wouldn't do that. I just don't
2609.40s:  know what it is because from my perspective, if we're saying the market makers as entities are
2617.16s:  essentially not touching the stock and we're transacting via swaps and we're transacting via ETF
2628.12s:  creation redemption cycles so that we don't have to touch the stock. I don't understand why they're
2634.04s:  touching the stock here. This is the exact time you don't want to touch the stock.
2642.20s:  So that part I just don't fully follow. And the other thing that I generally question that I don't
2652.20s:  because here's to be clear, my opinion, my opinion is I don't see the massive benefit for market
2661.24s:  makers to remain and hold massively short positions in GameStop. It's like really arduous for a
2669.16s:  market maker. I can see hedge funds doing it or different larger institutions that are trying
2675.32s:  to sell or box something. I can absolutely see that. Now I also want to be very clear. That doesn't
2681.40s:  mean that I don't think that market makers might have short GameStop positions. I genuinely have no
2689.16s:  idea. But when I look at this, it looks like so much of this is based around the market maker
2697.56s:  as the primary short participant. And maybe it's just a differing in general premise. But I would
2705.48s:  imagine it's closed and hedge funds because they're the ones that have the best access to black
2712.12s:  box movements to hide things and to not go on open market to grab shares like this.
2721.24s:  So that part just really, really confuses me. Hold on, Newton texted us.
2728.76s:  Newton says, honestly, it's sort of reiterating the ETF can kick in the thing we talked, yeah,
2733.96s:  the thing we talked about before 15 day to 40 windows and 10, 11 day settlement periods.
2738.44s:  Pretty excited for the next three weeks. So if we're pretty, yeah, yeah.
2742.76s:  Dude, so glad you said that because as I started reading it, I'm about
2755.32s:  40 men in and that's exactly what I'm seeing. My question though,
2768.44s:  is who do we think the primary shorts are market makers for hedge funds?
2781.88s:  Asking because the settlement cycle ideas would apply different, differently to the participant.
2794.36s:  I also am struggling to understand why in what is this Rexosix 8, Rexosix 8,
2811.80s:  we think that's driving volume on the open market to satisfy the margin requirement.
2824.28s:  Okay. This is if any of you guys were to ever go through my text conversations with Newton,
2834.52s:  it's strings of shit like that that I was just uttering into the mic. He and I spent so much time
2841.00s:  just pondering this shit. We're both equally interested in it.
2848.12s:  I'm curious what he thinks about that stuff though, like genuinely.
2851.48s:  Because I'm assuming it's something that we've thought about in that there's some sort of
2856.84s:  explanation that exists for it. I just literally don't know what it is. So I am
2865.96s:  pretty confident though that we'll be able to figure it out. So that's one of the questions
2869.24s:  I have here. So I'm actually going to add that to my to-do list.
2872.52s:  For Rexosix 8, why do we think that the margin satisfaction activity would present on the
2892.76s:  open market versus a creation redemption cycle? Who are the primary
2903.56s:  shorts? MMs or funds? Okay. Here we go.
2915.48s:  BW says, I've been holding cost shares for a year now, 15 undershairs just in case. What are we
2922.60s:  talking about right here? Great question. Yeah. That's the trick when you're talking about this
2928.68s:  shit is every once in a while you have to take a pause and pull your head out of the fucking sand
2932.92s:  and reorient ourselves. So thanks for giving us a, yeah, thanks for giving us an opportunity to do that.
2942.04s:  So this is talking about a margin deficiency seemingly that a short market maker might
2953.48s:  experience and then the subsequent market impact of them attempting to satisfy the margin
2962.44s:  deficiency is now I think that there's quite a few holes in here with this and that doesn't mean
2974.36s:  that there's not answers to them. There are just questions that we would want to answer.
2982.60s:  And the reason why we want to answer those is because it's a big part of why this thing may or
2988.92s:  may not work in the way that we think it may or may not because we're essentially saying that
2994.36s:  the volume here is being driven by this margin deficiency satisfaction which I don't fully follow
3004.44s:  what I want to understand. Jimmy reversed. It's June 1st of the Rex window and by 6 June stock was
3012.84s:  going parabolic. DFV brilliantly scheduled his live stream a couple days in the right, oh, 6, 8 window.
3025.24s:  Sadly, we'll never know if he was planning to shake his eight ball and exercise his 120,000 calls on
3030.44s:  stream that day. Well, we kind of know this because he he didn't have the money to exercise them.
3036.44s:  So we do know that he wasn't going to like he absolutely could exercise a lot of them. He had tons of
3042.60s:  money in the account, but he definitely couldn't have exercised all of them.
3050.52s:  Joseph says, have you gave your outlook for the week? No. So that one will be that live stream is
3056.76s:  going to be at 1700. I have three live streams today. I have this one right now. We'll probably go
3061.56s:  for like another half hour or so. Then at 1700, I'm doing for everybody on the YouTube channel,
3068.12s:  the market outlook for the week to make sure that you all have your marching orders while I am
3074.44s:  out freezing and checking out the mountains and Calgary. And then at 1730, so half hour and we're
3082.76s:  going to switch over to the Patreon stream. And we're just going to talk about like portfolio
3088.28s:  positioning, answer specific questions and stuff like that. So the market outlook will be a little
3094.60s:  bit later. Matthew says, just got on happy holidays, Eric and everyone straight up. Thank you,
3098.12s:  Matthew and happy holidays to everybody else. Merry Christmas. It's we we like to do a fun thing
3104.76s:  for Christmas where I don't like doing all Christmas presents at once. I actually think that
3111.48s:  that kind of like burns out your dopamine. And I think that you get less out of each item that
3116.84s:  way because it just becomes like another item on top of a mountain of shit you might you might get
3121.16s:  if you're fortunate enough to have families that can provide like that. So what I like to do with
3128.28s:  Mel is we do like a present a day or it's kind of random to be honest. You just kind of start
3135.08s:  depending on how many are under the tree and we never really plan that. And then we have to plan
3139.24s:  it around like traveling stuff. So we do like a random number of presents. One of the things though
3145.40s:  that Mill got. That's pretty fun is a like a red light therapy thing. It does like
3156.04s:  infrared light and then like regular light or near infrared. Anyways, the point I'm telling you
3161.96s:  this not that any of you care at all, but it's kind of hilarious. I want to set it up in here once
3166.44s:  because it casts a mean red glare. I mean, like lights up the entire room. It's hilarious.
3175.64s:  So every time that it she turns it on if the door's closed, it looks like out of a horror movie or
3181.80s:  something. There's just like red glowing lights spewing out through the door. Yeah, it's actually a
3189.96s:  more enjoyable gift than I thought it might be. And then the other one that she got before we
3195.48s:  get back to this is I got her this really crappy. I mean, she let's be honest. It's more for me
3204.28s:  than for her, but she likes Harry Potter. So I got her a Harry Potter wand that like shoots fire,
3210.12s:  little fire paper things. And I have been running around the house playing with her wand
3216.44s:  because this it works so much better than I ever thought it would have. I thought that it was
3222.36s:  going to be a giant piece of crap, not do anything. And it literally shoots fireballs. It is so fun
3228.20s:  except I started modifying the paper a little bit to make it a little more rambunctious and whatnot.
3232.28s:  But you know, you know, what do you expect? So let us continue with this.
3245.64s:  All right, so I'm going to get out of the depths here and then I want to start going through this
3251.00s:  stuff. Actually, see what we got.
3267.24s:  Here's the, you know, we read all this basically market maker. Yeah, okay. So this confirms part of
3272.60s:  my theory is that we think that this is primarily market maker driven,
3283.48s:  which actually, I have a buddy that's a market maker. So I'm going to add that to my, I talk to
3290.76s:  him like once a month. So I have a list of questions that I ask him typically and I'm going to
3296.28s:  ask him the question I'm going to ask him is why would market makers want to remain
3302.92s:  systemically short a stock? And that's not that's like any stock.
3310.60s:  And I'm also going to ask Chatcha BT this. Why would a market maker potentially want to remain
3320.44s:  systemically short a specific stock? Let's see what they say.
3335.96s:  Providing liquidity, managing inventory risk, that's not it. Exploding or evaluation or
3341.48s:  mispricing, I think they would have gotten out by now facilitating hedging for other market
3345.72s:  participants. That's the most likely so far. I think that's probably the best. That's the best
3357.08s:  concept for that that I can think of. Because it depends on hold on.
3363.80s:  So it depends on how far into the weeds we're trying to go here. But if we think that there
3387.48s:  are market makers that are potentially so far in bed with some hedge funds, then there could be
3399.16s:  like that that motivation for a market maker to remain systemically short could be there.
3404.36s:  That is a huge leap, which is why and went and got the hat to big leap. But that is objectively
3415.72s:  unmotivating factor that I could conceive of. Joe says every vacuum I buy breaks, I got four broken
3422.04s:  ones. One, that tells you you need to stop doing what we know what you're doing with that vacuum.
3427.88s:  You need to stop that. Stop that right now. You're going to burn out the motors,
3431.64s:  give the vacuum a break and grab something else that's more suitable to the task. You know what
3437.88s:  I'm talking about. Joe and then just get a Dyson. Literally, we have, that's all we use is Dyson.
3447.80s:  They work fantastic. They always survive whatever you put it through, Joe, whatever you might put it
3456.44s:  through. And they're really strong. Go super strong. So I think you just need to upgrade your life
3468.12s:  a little bit. Joe says is the guy with a Viking foil hat giving me cleaning tips? It's the same
3477.16s:  clean and big dog. We are sharing tips here, but not not that one. I'm just trying to save you from
3485.80s:  having four broken vacuum sitting around is fucking crazy. That's literally crazy.
3496.36s:  I drove by a vacuum repair shop and I was shook that that is still a business. I cannot believe
3506.28s:  that that is still a business. It blows my mind that it literally could be cheaper to repair
3514.04s:  an existing vacuum versus just buying a new one. In my mind, vacuums are just disposable.
3526.60s:  Jonathan says isn't set at all both a market maker and a hedge fund. Definitely. The problem with
3533.24s:  that if we are applying that theory here is that they're not going to have margin issues. They're
3540.12s:  just too big. So even if they're holding a certain amount of this float, whatever amount of the float
3546.28s:  that we think short, I don't think that they're going to have margin issues on the market making
3552.60s:  side of things. They're just that sizeable because one of the other issues that I notice we make
3561.16s:  when we do this slash like have conversations around this is this. Let me grab
3570.68s:  let me grab my workbook handy dandy workbook.
3581.72s:  And I want to show you something.
3583.88s:  So typically.
3595.80s:  And now I'm finally at a spot. Okay, this thing gets so hot. Everybody that thinks that you need
3604.52s:  like a beanie to warm your head. I'm going to tell you right now you're you're irrevocably wrong.
3611.32s:  You need a Viking tinfoil hat that will warm your head in a jiffy. Super fast.
3620.68s:  Now let me show you this.
3637.24s:  That's not right. Hold on.
3642.04s:  So this is your standard highly rotund market maker.
3664.44s:  He has french fries in his pocket.
3671.72s:  He has a little table that he carries with lines of coke like that.
3679.24s:  And then he has like one of those little silly silly little rascal hats.
3686.84s:  Like that.
3691.08s:  And then he is a little fat eyes that can't even open because there's too much extra skin
3697.80s:  in his face. And he's never happy.
3702.04s:  He's just kind of mute like that.
3704.84s:  So this is a direct depiction of a market maker.
3711.48s:  Now a market maker. They have a little machine
3717.24s:  that makes markets that automatically creates bids and offers for stocks.
3731.08s:  The thing about market makers is that they don't typically make bids and offers
3739.56s:  on just one stock. They make bids and offers on hundreds.
3752.36s:  And I'll explain why this matters.
3769.88s:  I like how the bid and offer progressively got worse as I went on longer.
3778.92s:  Here's what happens. This is stock XYZ. This is stock ABC. This is stock 123.
3791.48s:  They're going to go through different order flows for each of these stocks.
3798.44s:  So this one they might buy. This one they might sell. This one they might sell.
3803.24s:  Right. They're going to have a bunch of different, a bunch of different ones of these.
3806.84s:  What happens is at the end of the day, they're going to look at their whole book,
3811.72s:  the entire book, this entire thing. And they're going to say, what's it look like?
3820.76s:  What's up?
3821.88s:  The reason why this matters is because they're not always making markets on individual securities.
3834.68s:  It's actually rarely the case. So when we're talking about them going into, especially talking about
3841.88s:  a company like Citadel, because Citadel, the market making arm is going to do this on thousands of
3848.36s:  stocks. It's literally one of the largest market making firms that exists, thousands of names.
3854.44s:  They're going to provide markets on. So in order for them to find themselves in a margin call,
3861.24s:  they essentially would have need to completely mismanage risk on this individual position.
3868.28s:  And then they would have to have an entire book where nothing is offsetting any of the risk in
3876.04s:  that initial position in that other stock. Because when we look at the entire basket of all of the
3881.72s:  stuff that they're holding at a given point in time, stock ABC might be beta weighted as 10
3890.68s:  spy deltas. It would never be done like this, but it's just for ease of an example.
3896.04s:  And then stock 123 might be beta weighted as negative six spy deltas.
3903.08s:  So their net exposure, once you consider both of these names, their net exposure is long four.
3915.40s:  Beta weighted deltas. So the main point I want you to take away from this is that it's not done in
3924.60s:  a vacuum. It's done in a giant bucket with a ton of shit going on behind the scenes.
3936.12s:  One of the important elements is the ability for positions to offset risk with one another when
3943.64s:  they're looking at the composite of the entire book, which is exactly how a market maker is going
3949.00s:  to look at their book. They're going to track the individual positions of course.
3953.32s:  But they manage the risk in the aggregate control of the entire book. So risk management literally
3961.56s:  is how a market maker extracts their edge from the market because they operate in a near frictionless
3968.28s:  environment. They don't make a lot of money for trade. But by providing liquidity through the
3974.20s:  bit ask spread and capturing that differential, that's how they make their money. So all that being said,
3982.28s:  it's exactly exactly why you have to remember that they're not just making market on one stock
3989.48s:  and one stock only. They're making a market on a ton of different things that can have offsetting
3998.12s:  qualities. And it's why when you have a massive market maker like Citadel, the probability of them
4004.84s:  having to use Rex 068 or something like that would be very small likely. Now there could be
4012.36s:  strategic reasons why they might siphon out liquidity to do something like this. But we're getting
4017.64s:  like super niche at that point, not saying it could or could not happen. I'm not saying that
4022.68s:  they may or may not be implementing it. I don't know. I'm not there. But what I do know is that
4028.68s:  market makers operate like this. They're going to be making markets on tons of stocks.
4034.04s:  The stocks will be looked at individually and then also when the aggregate. And if the market
4039.80s:  maker is doing a good job managing their book, which is the entire way that they make their money,
4044.12s:  they then will have positions that offset one another so that they don't run into that situation where
4052.28s:  they have a margin call. And then to which we might hypothesize that they're then forced onto the
4059.96s:  open market to satisfy this requirement. They would I just have such a hard time seeing why they
4067.24s:  would put themselves in that scenario. Okay. So Newton based on the okay, so let me explain the
4075.32s:  the question I asked earlier. I said my primary thought though is who do we think the primary
4079.88s:  shorts are market makers or hedge funds asking because the settlement cycles would apply
4083.32s:  differently to the participants. I'm also struggling to understand why in Rex 068 we think that
4087.72s:  it's driving volume on the open markets to satisfy the margin requirements.
4091.72s:  Newton says great question. I had the same. And I believe this would be a powerful tool for
4097.32s:  designated market maker to handle CNS FTD settlement to manage large buy-ins over time.
4102.60s:  The margin deficiency could be the DMM specific account for that equity. So in this case,
4106.92s:  Citadel and GME big buy aspirin for 50 data for all. I see. Interesting.
4117.72s:  I don't see that personally, but again, I don't fucking know. Not gonna pretend to know.
4129.16s:  But I don't see how that logically would flow from their perspective.
4135.88s:  All right. So we have like maybe 10 minutes left. So what I'm going to do is put an ear mark
4140.84s:  in the rest of this FTD. And by the rest of it, I mean literally all of it since we've only done
4146.60s:  an overview so far, I'm sorry that I'm so fucking slow with this stuff.
4150.44s:  I move slow because I insist on understanding each element of something. And it's just time
4158.28s:  consuming because one, I'm dumb and it takes me a long time to learn things
4163.72s:  into because I try to be thorough. And rather than just seeing a hyperlink like this and just going
4172.52s:  and taking somebody at their word for whatever it is, like I insist on clicking it and looking at
4177.40s:  it myself to see exactly what it is. And it's because this is so damn complex that we can't be lazy
4186.20s:  in the way that we analyze it if we actually want to understand what's going on. And again,
4190.92s:  my desire to understand what's going on isn't to try and trade this. This isn't how I would
4196.92s:  try to trade it personally. It's not. This is stuff that I find interesting from a market
4202.68s:  market structure perspective. The way that I trade things like this is already defined,
4207.08s:  it's actually pretty straightforward and easy for me to do. This I'm just very interested in it.
4213.56s:  Okay, so this will be our leave off point, leave off point on 22Ds,
4218.60s:  post, and that will be my reminder. Super interesting though.
4227.08s:  So, so far though, if I were to summarize what I'm seeing, this does seem to be generally
4235.16s:  highlighting a lot of what Newton has been talking about, which has been the redemption
4242.76s:  creation cycles and kind of adding another perspective on it, which is great. I'm very, very
4247.48s:  excited to see this. So, yeah, the, man, the movement in this has been really interesting. And from
4257.80s:  a recent timing perspective, it looks super solid. Let me message TJ really quick. And I just
4264.12s:  want to let them know that I started taking a peek at this. I try to follow up with people that
4270.52s:  tag me on stuff like that because I like to close the loop. I like to let people know that if they're
4274.28s:  going to bother bringing stuff to me, that I'm going to try my best to answer it when I can.
4279.56s:  And then to try and add some sort of value, which I hope I did. The, the things that I think would
4288.28s:  add value in this context is trying to get more specific with understanding how we break down
4295.08s:  the perspective shorts in terms of disposition. Do we think that X percent, and this is what I asked,
4301.96s:  this is what I asked Kevin and PB because I'm super interested in it because it has a profound
4311.32s:  impact on how this whole thing works is who are the shorts and what's their motivation for
4319.64s:  remaining short. So, yeah, I'm excited to learn a little bit more about that.
4326.44s:  Yeah.
4327.08s:  Rapture says I want to understand too. So you Gucci. Yeah, that's good. I figured the people that are
4333.08s:  coming to hang out here aren't the people that are looking for super bright lights and flashy things
4338.60s:  and, you know, just a ton of overall excitement. I think most of the people that hang out for these
4343.24s:  streams are more cerebral because we're literally trying to get to the bottom of something that's
4348.20s:  super complex and you can't get there quickly. That's just not how this stuff works. Okay, especially
4354.12s:  if you work with somebody like me, we're going to move slow because I have to read stuff 62
4360.28s:  times before I understand it. I am a simple man. Archduke PC says just a quick look, it's super
4367.88s:  interesting. Wait, what am I supposed to look at? Archduke says, can you take a look at the DD
4372.84s:  on archaicos swap? I think I've seen that one. We can definitely go further into it, but yeah,
4378.76s:  bring that up to me on the next one of these that we do. And I, so for those that don't know,
4385.24s:  I've been doing this live stream every Saturday now for months, literally months. And the way that
4391.56s:  it started was looking at every single one of DFV's trade, all of them. Then after that, I wanted
4398.76s:  to pivot into the theories due diligence and analysis that's been done. And we are about halfway
4406.68s:  through, about halfway through on the diamond book, which I think is a compilation of several
4416.76s:  DDs, several meaning quite a few. Then I need to finish going through the rest of the DD library.
4422.84s:  And then, but I'm going to put those on pause to go through the rest of this, the big DD.
4429.16s:  And try to see what we can learn. That's the idea. Archduke says cool data dropped on a red
4436.44s:  at post yesterday. Yeah. If you maintain, if you grab a link of it, you, you hold on to it,
4441.08s:  just let me know. And then we can take a look at it together. The problem with swaps, I will continue
4446.44s:  to reiterate is that us trying to do anything with swaps. It's good to know that they're there and
4451.72s:  that they how they work, but they're beyond that. They're generally meaningless. The reason why I
4458.12s:  say that is because they are the epitome of a black box. We have no idea what the structure of
4467.00s:  the swap is. They are negotiated between two parties. And the terms are not, we don't see them.
4474.84s:  They're an ago, it's a negotiated contract. It's a very sophisticated derivative in that it's
4481.08s:  not standardized. So the issue with swaps is this idea that as a big swap is coming due and people
4489.48s:  are going to have to go to the market to buy stuff, it doesn't fully hold because again, institutions
4496.92s:  are smart. If I, Eric, let's literally draw it out. As you all know, I am a, I'm a budding artist.
4507.48s:  And I, I just need to draw. I think that that's what happens. I just have to let it out via drawing.
4515.80s:  If I'm a, if I'm an entity that is on one end of the swap, that would lead me to have to go buy stock.
4523.88s:  Let's say that I was going to have to buy stock on this day. And let's say that the duration of
4528.84s:  the swap was this period. Do you think that I am going to wait until this day to buy the swap,
4538.68s:  to buy the underlying contracts that I would have to hold in order to satisfy my end of the swap?
4546.60s:  The answer is unequivocally no. You're not going to wait until the absolute last day to do something
4557.16s:  if you are planning to satisfy it in that manner, meaning to go to the open market to procure shares.
4565.48s:  It doesn't make sense. Because one, everybody can track it. We can see the dates of the swaps.
4572.20s:  So everybody can front run that move. That's, that's the whole point of a swap is for it to be
4578.28s:  non-standardized and more difficult to detect so that it can't be front ran. It's the same thing
4584.60s:  with dark pools. The purpose of those is to attempt to obfuscate movement so that they can't be
4592.68s:  front ran. That's a big problem for people that are conducting really big purchases.
4597.08s:  So the scenario of somebody that knows that they're going to have to satisfy it by going to the
4601.96s:  open market and waiting until the very last day to do so it literally is not logical. I wouldn't
4606.92s:  do that as a lay retail trader. There's no way that super smart institutions are just like,
4613.56s:  oh yeah, fuck, this just came up on the calendar today. I guess I have to go slam the buy button
4618.60s:  on this thing all day today and try to get myself out of it. It just doesn't drive.
4624.76s:  The next element, the more important element is as this contract is coming due, they can write
4634.84s:  another one. There's, there are no rules. So they can take the same contract. They can say,
4643.16s:  I still like this. I'm going to roll it out in time. And they can do this as much as they want
4648.04s:  for whatever reason. We also don't know if there's not an early satisfactory component to the swaps
4655.24s:  where if the swap is originally this duration, but at this point, they're like, eh, let me get out of
4661.16s:  the swap. It's done what I needed to do whatever that is. And I'm ready to exit the position here.
4667.40s:  So that's the, that's the problem with swaps is that they are literal black boxes.
4676.12s:  And it does not surprise me at all to see GameStop and a bunch of other stocks. Again,
4684.28s:  it's not just GameStop. There's tons of stocks like this that end up in swaps because it's
4688.92s:  really advantageous for people that are trying to do things with GameStop to use swaps to do them
4696.12s:  because they are a black box. So yeah, I would love to take a look at whatever the swap DD
4705.48s:  that came out from archaicos. But my expectation is that in terms of utility, it will be
4713.08s:  quite limited for us. And it's, I would love for them to be more useful. But I can definitely tell you,
4720.84s:  I even on the livestream with PBISdom, if I could take a look at the broader data set and see if
4727.48s:  I can come up with anything because I already know parts of what I'm going to find. I know that
4733.16s:  I'm going to find a entirely mixed bag of stuff. But if I can find anything with a decent correlation
4741.00s:  coefficient, I still would try to do something with that because why wouldn't we? The thing again,
4748.36s:  the difference between trading and a perfect science is trading is the art of using imperfect
4757.32s:  information to come up with ideas. So for example, if I found some sort of correlation between a certain
4767.00s:  day of the week and something happened in the market and hint hint, I've done this before,
4772.52s:  I will use that. Do I fully know why the day of the week does something? Do I fully understand
4778.04s:  that the background behind it more often than not know, but it doesn't matter to me. I'm just trying
4782.84s:  to trade the effect. Now you can go back later and figure out that some of it are window dressing
4787.96s:  effects and there's other things that lead to behavior like that. But it typically doesn't last forever.
4794.44s:  It could just be that there's a specific fund that's trying to gain entry into something and
4797.96s:  they're scaling in over time or whatever the case is. The point I'm trying to make is that even if
4803.00s:  it's a loose correlation, it's still a correlation and it's something that we should take a look at.
4807.00s:  I got some in my eye. So I'm hopeful that with the swaps, we might be able to find something. I
4813.80s:  just don't know what, but I don't think that they're quite as informative. I think as people are
4821.48s:  hoping for them to be. Archduke PC says the swap dates have already expired correlate to big GM
4828.44s:  GM moves like May this year in the sneeze seat, but that's the problem is that we're what we're
4835.00s:  doing is we're overfitting at that point because guess also what happened during those periods
4841.24s:  supposedly, obnox tailwinds, settlement periods also happened. We also had massive options trading
4848.84s:  activity. We also now have apparently Rex 068. So the problem is is what we're doing is we're looking
4856.68s:  historically at really strange scenarios. And then we're trying to isolate what caused the scenario
4865.08s:  and in reality, it's overwhelmingly likely a contributing factor driven by a ton of this shit.
4871.88s:  Different elements of all of these things coalescing at a specific period in time.
4876.52s:  Markets are not vacuums. Markets will continue to be extremely complex places that will always have
4883.32s:  these quirky style movements because of that. Now again, we should always look at this stuff and
4889.16s:  we should look at swaps. I've spent a long time looking at swaps because I find them very interesting.
4893.00s:  And even if they have a 10% input potential into a model like this, I'm certainly interested in
4899.72s:  that. But based on the original analysis that I've done, I just hadn't seen a massive input
4907.08s:  personally, but definitely open to it. And I hope that there is because the more observable
4914.12s:  elements that we can clearly identify positive correlation with, then the more predictable the
4918.92s:  event becomes, which is literally good for everybody. It doesn't fall on deaf ears that I know
4930.68s:  so many traders are trying to use GameStop as a way to change their current life.
4937.96s:  Now, it's not my approach. I would love for them to have a different approach personally.
4942.92s:  That's not to say don't trade GameStop, but I would just love for people to have a slightly
4947.32s:  higher probability approach to achieving that. But nonetheless, it is what it is.
4957.08s:  So a big reason why I spend so much time on this stuff is not just born out of my personal curiosity,
4963.64s:  but it's because I know that there are a lot of people that quite literally their livelihoods
4969.56s:  depend on elements of this. And I want nothing more than for them to succeed. I already told you,
4974.92s:  this is not the way that I trade GameStop is completely different than all of this stuff. And GameStop
4980.52s:  is still a small part of my book. It just is what it is. My primary purpose is I'm a trader. It's
4987.16s:  literally how I make a living. So I have to do things in a way that work for me. But I recognize that
4992.92s:  other people have different imperatives. And I see a lot of people trying to do something big with this.
4999.24s:  And I want them to I want them to have a solid, a solid approach. And something that makes sense
5008.92s:  for them. Starbeef, which is a hell of a name. Starbeef says, this is why I hope moving forward,
5015.96s:  you you use less Newton texting. A lot of these debunked theories people are saying come from Newton.
5021.32s:  He still pumps T35 and daily emphasize emphasis on Max Payne. Oh, fuck no. There's a 0% chance that I'm
5028.20s:  going to use less Newton. It's an information source. He and I don't agree on all of the elements of
5036.76s:  GameStop. It's and that's okay. We don't have to. But the way that you move closer to objective
5043.72s:  truth is through multiple information sources. So as long as he still remains like the completely
5052.28s:  grounded awesome dude that he is, there's no reason why I would stop listening to his opinion of
5058.92s:  things. He's he literally in my opinion is like that the GameStop scribe. That's what I call him,
5064.76s:  the GameStop scribe. And it's because he spent so much time collating all of this different data
5070.36s:  about GameStop. So there's no way that I would turn down the intelligence that he can provide. But
5077.72s:  as you can tell, I don't take him at his word or anybody at their word. You shouldn't. You
5082.44s:  should do your own research. But it's like it's the same thing in the military. Like we wouldn't
5089.16s:  turn down any intel. We'll listen to all of it. We're going to screen it. We're going to apply
5095.32s:  our thought process and our analysis to it as we should. But there's absolutely no reason why
5103.00s:  I would turn off an information source because what he does is at least researched and tracked.
5111.16s:  It's not completely random. Now it's the same thing I notice with other people that I'll interact
5116.36s:  with. And you guys will hear me do this. I will say, is this something we can prove or is this a
5123.24s:  hunch or is this a theory? And the reason why I asked that question. One is to check the framing
5131.48s:  so that people aren't misled. But the second is also to test the person. And how effective
5140.20s:  is the person at differentiating reality from something that we might think to be the case?
5146.84s:  Because something that we can objectively prove is different than a theory or something like that.
5152.76s:  So yeah, I totally dig new. I think he's rad. So yeah, I'm 100% going to ask his opinion on stuff like
5162.12s:  this, especially in things that I think he knows more than me for sure. And then I will always
5168.12s:  I will always backcheck everything. You guys see me do that literally with everything because it's
5173.40s:  how I apply my process. So yeah. Rapsh. Starbeef says this is why I hope oh, I already read that.
5184.52s:  Matthew says you're a good person Eric never changed. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I hope
5188.20s:  to be. And I hope to continue changing but hopefully for the better. Rapshush says even if Newton is
5194.44s:  Ron, it's how we learn I agree. Newton's data isn't his theories could possibly be but not the data
5200.04s:  he's noted. I don't know what that pertains to. Sorry, I probably move past it too fast.
5207.08s:  Notion says is market energy me going to rip or crash on my it's a great question. We're actually
5211.16s:  going to take a look at that in a half hour. So on the 1700 live stream, I'm going to go through
5216.92s:  the market prep for the week. And then when I get back from traveling what not, I'm going to start
5223.56s:  daily live stream every single day for the for the YouTube channel. And then the outlier pro live
5228.60s:  streams will still be on Sunday and Wednesday. I might actually bump up the frequency and just
5235.96s:  cut back the time on some of the other ones so that we can cover a little disparate data because
5241.40s:  for the pro live streams, we get more into like my specific portfolio actual trades trade adjustment
5246.28s:  stuff like that. And then working through individual people's trades as well to try and help. And then
5251.40s:  on the main channel, we do more broad analysis. We do scanning. We do like theoretical learning
5258.28s:  and stuff like that because I think that that's timeless applicable to everybody. And I
5262.76s:  my original objective for doing this whole thing is not changed, which is hopefully to spread
5267.16s:  and share information for people to arrive at their own conclusions for stuff.
5273.96s:  So thank you all for hanging out for being a part of the game. And also thank you for helping me
5279.48s:  learn. I enjoy this very much. I will see whoever wants to pop out for the market update or for
5285.40s:  the market outlook live stream in a half hour. We're going to look through the market as a whole,
5289.32s:  look through some news. See what's going on with the broad market. And then the pro members, I'll catch
5294.76s:  you all at 17 30 to go through some portfolio updates and whatnot. So we are packed. We out here.
5303.08s:  I'll see you all in a little bit. Be an outlier. Be an ape. Be an outlier. Ape. Be whatever makes you
5307.80s:  happy. I'll see y'all later.
