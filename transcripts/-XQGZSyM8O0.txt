0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
122.00s: you
126.00s: you
130.00s: what's up everybody
132.00s: happy
134.00s: saturday
136.00s: we are on to what episode is this now episode 32
140.00s: of GameStop Analysis and we are now into part 14
146.00s: of the game.
148.00s: So we just wrapped up a massive massive massive
154.00s: run through of the diamond handbook which is over 800 pages
158.00s: and we are getting right back into the weeds.
162.00s: So that's actually the gameplay for today is we're going to continue on
166.00s: working through the dd library. I figured that we would start with a quick overview of
170.00s: gamestop for those that don't know I am still doing the update every Tuesday Wednesday
176.00s: kind of depends on the week but on standalone video for gamestop on Tuesdays
182.00s: and this last week was a little bit of our make or break week and yeah it looks a little bit more on the
192.00s: break side but before we get too far into the weeds as always I'd like to say hello to everybody
196.00s: see who's hanging out looks like we got Alberto Dersh Lup
200.00s: Gustin dark mark
204.00s: what's up everybody dark mark says you got Strictlin or duplesey I would probably go
210.00s: with Strictlin I genuinely think Strictlin edgeed him out in that first flight
214.00s: um yeah I mean duplesey is so unorthodox with respect to a fighting style it's fascinating
222.00s: it really really is fascinating but at this point I'm just still sad boy because I haven't
230.00s: really been able to train anything for now six months it's been a long time with the
236.00s: whole herni at a desk it's getting better but it's still there I'm actually getting
240.00s: another epidural on Monday to continue trying to heal this bad boy definitely the longest
246.00s: injury I've ever had it's taught me a lot actually about myself about my life about
250.00s: dad which is a really strange topic not worth going into here but yeah that's been
257.52s: interesting but the cool part about not being able to train is I've been spending a lot of
261.92s: time kind of watching tape and just researching and doing the best I can to learn
269.20s: not through obviously being able to go through the physical pieces but being able to just
273.04s: monitor and been watch stuff and learn that by so yeah I just I think Strictlin won that first flight
280.48s: the the most frustrating part is like the UFC one things go to the judges you know the the
285.28s: biggest thing is damage and if you just look at the dudes faces at the end of that fight do
291.12s: plus he was fucked up Strictlin doesn't didn't really look like he had been touched so
298.56s: and then he obviously had the head but which cut his eye but other than a cut yeah
305.28s: interesting first fight but that that is also the the downside of somebody like Strictlin is that
310.08s: he is I mean generally more of a points fighter right like you're gonna see one two's and
315.76s: tips lots of one two tips which are good it's effective but that brings it and it puts it in a
323.04s: judges hands versus somebody that's just flooring people all over the place there's I mean that's
329.36s: mostly heavy weights but let's get over to the main screen and let's take peek at where game stop current
339.68s: is the game stop current analysis let's see this is unfortunate to me so this part is unfortunate for a
354.72s: few reasons this breakdown below this level and I already flagged it to you guys in my opinion as a
360.80s: pretty key level from just in accumulation distribution style perspective and it's looking very very
370.00s: I mean it's trading right down essentially to the 200 day MA this there's not a lot of volume here
377.92s: so one of the things I had noted when we spoke about this last time is I felt that this
385.60s: relationship in there was super important and that a break below this likely would mean a
393.20s: likely extension to the downside so as soon as it broke below this I actually had bought puts this is
400.00s: separate from the covered strangle that I talked to you all about and I had bought puts expecting
406.72s: something to this degree some sort of actual downside velocity picking up not that I'm you know long
412.72s: term bearish on game stop or anything but as I remind everybody I'm a trader right how I make money
421.04s: so I make money from movement I don't get to just trade the way that I want things to go I just
427.68s: trade them as they are so yeah I did buy puts I still have the covered strangle on we can run through
433.12s: obviously that whole position I normally do that on the Tuesday video so everything I mean no real
438.08s: changes with the covered strangle side of things I am glad that I scaled down a little bit on the shares
443.60s: that was in hindsight a smart move a lot of that was based on intuition but when you see something
449.52s: breaking down like this you generally have to wait until there's some sort of stronger catalyst for an
455.76s: upside this is distribution so this is some sort of larger entity or series of entities that are
463.76s: unwinding their positions this that's not to say that that's people trying to force the price down
469.12s: and stuff like that it could be a could not be I don't know but this is following a very standard
474.72s: blow especially with something like this where we had that really big down day that was on no news
480.80s: a lot of times that will be marked by selling from some sort of entity and there's a good chance
487.04s: that some sort of institutional trading firm made a lot of money on this because there was a ton
493.28s: of accumulation happening all through here and all through here so this absolutely can just be
499.92s: something that's like okay I see this starting to trail down I'm going to take my profits because
505.36s: again from the cover triangle perspective the way I trade that typically is not dissimilar to that
511.28s: because here's the way that it typically works especially from a trader's lens if let's say about
518.24s: in here and the stock rallies which is great and then it starts to roll over well from a trading lens
527.76s: what I don't want to do is just hold it while all of the gains that I accumulated here are
534.88s: road away I get nothing from that at the end of that position I essentially am back where I started
541.68s: the only thing that his occurred is time has passed and I have nothing to show for it so a lot of
547.12s: times what I like to do is if I'm scaling in and here the stock is rallying and then essentially
555.04s: I'll just regardless of what percentage move it is in regardless of all that kind of stuff what I do is
561.76s: I just monitor breakdowns and if the trend starts reversing I'll begin scaling out of the position
567.44s: to take up risk to realize the gain and if I realize that gain then I'm able to buy more when it
576.56s: starts consolidating but now that's really the game is to see like when this consolidation happens
584.16s: and I think it's a little early to tell I mean this is the next spot that typically
593.20s: would be flagged for consolidation would be something around here the 200 day MA that's a
597.68s: generally large moving average and then below that it's down here down in the 22 handle so I know
605.52s: a lot of people when I first was talking about the possibility of it going to 26 and a half and then
610.88s: 25 and a half I actually got some hate mail about that people I know people are so emotional about the stock
618.56s: and they don't want to even you know, fathom it going down but the reality is even game
626.16s: stopped like most other stocks it's still going to have an ebb and flow that's naturally going to
632.24s: occur with it it's just how things are and then you add the elements on top of that and there
638.32s: definitely are some suspicious elements with respect to manipulation like that that is absolutely
644.64s: something and I actually wanted to talk about a comment that I got one second two of them
655.04s: actually this one I thought was funny so I thought I would show you guys this one
661.92s: so this was a comment from somebody that I obviously don't know and it was on a YouTube short
670.00s: that I had made and it literally cracked me up because I was wearing like it was like a
676.32s: north phase zip up and this was talking about how sometimes understanding what returns are possible
683.12s: for traders can be uncomfortable like when you realize that you know 50% returns year over year
688.96s: probably aren't happening and this person says only thing uncomfortable here is that I sort of
695.60s: a shirt you are wearing just just think of where you have to be in life that this comment
708.40s: goes through your brain and then goes through your fingers I just love that so much so I thought
716.16s: I would share that joy with you but joking comments aside there is actually an important comment
724.24s: this one here and this is from oh that's funny I was wearing the same shirt in this one
733.20s: well done I missed it I wanted a highlighted for you guys this one this is a
739.68s: this is an interesting question so coffees coffee donuts and Homer had a really interesting question
753.84s: that I do think is worth discussing and they're saying after all you've seen with game stop how
760.48s: can you say the market makers don't want to hurt retail traders and the for those that didn't
766.72s: see the short this YouTube short is essentially saying the market is indifferent to you so what I mean
773.84s: by that is the market doesn't care that you need to make or want to make or trying to make one
778.24s: percent this week this month this year whatever that the market doesn't care what you are trying
783.44s: to do what your preferences are what your needs are that the market is indifferent to your existence
790.16s: so that's the context of that video I actually didn't even really talk much about market
794.00s: makers in there but I think that's why they added the market makers in there because they're
797.76s: bundling them in that broader market concept and it says the system is set up for the one percent
803.04s: there is no oversight ongrish trades on insider info for fucks sake as you see in FBI turn
809.04s: a blind eye when the buy button was turned off in game stop in 2021 so the first thing is I
818.96s: want to start with the way that I look at things there's a lot of emotion and understandably
829.44s: so in this comment I fully understand why they're so emotional and why that's coming through
836.48s: in this comment but here's the reality market makers they're not out to hurt retail traders
847.68s: now market makers are absolutely out to make as much money as they possibly can now
860.00s: the difference there might sound in it might sound like there is no difference but there is a
866.80s: difference there and it's subtle there's a big difference between a system that incentivizes different
873.36s: behaviors to make as much money as humanly possible which is what they do versus doing things to hurt
880.96s: in entity the reason why I'm flagging this difference is because this develops a victim mindset
888.56s: if we go into this thinking that people are purposefully trying to poach us that are trying to hurt us
895.60s: that are trying to say how can I fuck up this person over here it completely skews our perception
901.20s: of the game that we're playing so the reality is the market in general simply is indifferent to you
908.88s: that in difference can absolutely result in you having trades that lose or your piano going down yeah
915.68s: that in difference is a thing because it's a competitive space people are trying to make money
920.00s: then you overlay some of the fuckery that we clearly can see in game stop and not just game stop
926.24s: in other stocks with naked shorting and FTDs and the fact that they're playing the plumbing of the
934.64s: system again they're playing the plumbing of the system not to hurt retail traders outright
942.00s: it's because they can make more money doing so so it's an incentive based structure there isn't
948.48s: an incentive for them to hurt any entity and when I say her obviously I don't mean physical but
953.76s: in terms of like trying to screw them over the way that the system is incentivized is
960.32s: literally to play the game within the bounds as best as you can to make as much money as you possibly can
965.52s: and that actually goes into this here congress trading on insider information here's the reality
971.60s: what congress does as far as their trading is perfectly legal it's not insider trading it's perfectly
978.80s: legal I want to be super clear I couldn't disagree with it anymore if possible the fact when
986.32s: you're in professional services jobs as a peasant right like if you're a consultant at a consulting
993.28s: firm there's really strict requirements on what you can trade and as a consultant you don't see
998.72s: shit the only thing you're doing the only thing you're doing is moving shit on a slide deck around
1007.12s: and making sure everything is perfect that's it bro that is it but the appearance of any sort of
1016.96s: fuckery going on there is against the it really um opposed is the professional reputation of the
1023.44s: firm and they won't have it so the reality is congress does seem to trade on privileged information
1032.64s: and I don't disagree with it I don't like that I think it should be gone it to me it's a fucking
1037.28s: no brainer thing to be gone but it's not illegal so tying it to insider info which is illegal
1046.24s: is again just kind of crossing streams a little bit and this is what happens when we start to view
1051.68s: the entire system is stacked against us we look at everything through the lens of how well how is this
1058.80s: designed to screw me over and again I'm not saying that it's not I'm not saying that there are
1062.80s: disadvantages there are but it's not quite as adversarial to that degree now again in terms of the
1072.72s: system set up for the 1% I actually like I was actually just talking with my wife about this one of
1078.32s: the things I think about is why is it that if you're trying to contribute to a IRA you can contribute
1085.92s: 7000 dollars what the fuck like what if if we were actually designed to you know try to help people
1096.32s: get to retirement and not be strapped for cash and not have to live just off of social security like
1103.04s: why the fuck are we capped at 7 right like that's fucked but those kinds of things aside
1109.92s: the reality is there are a lot of inequities but that doesn't inherently mean that the
1119.20s: system is directly out to get you now one of the other things with respect to congressional trading
1125.92s: there's a few things in mind now again I want to be really clear I think first in foremost they
1134.80s: if they're to put on any positions they should only be able to put on ETFs right that's standard
1142.08s: most places abide by that kind of rule where anybody has any sort of insider level information
1148.72s: so definitely the case now there's another reality though and it's again it's up for a conversation
1157.44s: it depends on your belief systems and what you think but if you look at let's look at a few things
1164.80s: so I don't know about I don't really care about that for all members of the house of representatives
1182.48s: and senate they're getting $174,000 the majority party leader is 193 minorities 193
1193.68s: so on and so forth so they're not making bad money but they're not making great money and I know
1200.64s: that that might sound crazy for people that are like in a $30,000 pre-er job and I understand
1206.72s: how that can sound but the reality is a lot of these people are pretty high powered they have
1215.92s: strong backgrounds and if they were to work in a corporate equivalent they could make way more money
1224.32s: but a lot of them venture into government I honestly don't believe for altruistic reasons
1230.88s: but taking this back to the trading thing part of it is trying to set up an incentive structure
1238.72s: so that smart people that have better alternatives to make more money elsewhere still want to do the job
1246.16s: and I'm not saying that this is right and I'm not saying that they should trade they shouldn't
1249.36s: I'm just offering that as a thought process for the broader problem that exists here because a lot
1256.88s: of people look at government and they essentially just say well they shouldn't be able to make that
1260.64s: kind of money they shouldn't be able to trade they shouldn't be able to do this and then you start
1264.64s: adding a bunch of those should-ups on top of that and then when you actually have really highly qualified
1269.60s: people they're like well why the fuck what I do this right it just it doesn't make sense at that point
1277.36s: so again to be super clear I don't think they should be able to trade I don't I think it's crazy
1284.24s: that they can trade individual names I think it's fucked but I do think that this highlights one of
1289.52s: the underlying incentives and why they still are able to they could close that whole pretty quick
1297.36s: if they were so inclined but what ends up happening is a couple people rally together I know
1302.48s: AOC is one of them and you know another a couple other people banded together was actually bipartisan
1307.76s: it was over a public end and a Democrat that were like yeah this is done why why can
1312.40s: Congress trade like this is absolutely ridiculous and somehow those bills never go anywhere there's
1318.80s: never any law passed on that and it highlights some of again the incentive structure so
1325.36s: the main takeaway is I think looking at their ability to trade individual stocks I agree it's it's
1331.76s: crazy but I think to look at really complex problems in a really simplistic lens and just say you know
1340.32s: they shouldn't be able to do that then you really have to think about what the compensation and
1345.44s: stuff like that should be to have like actually genuinely qualified people in there to do a good job
1351.68s: so really really tricky tricky problem set I think that there's no world that they should
1357.44s: be able to trade individual names like that's absolutely crazy so and then he says SEC and FBI turned
1364.00s: a blind eye when the buy button was turned off and again like the SEC didn't turn a blind eye they
1368.56s: didn't investigation now even for that investigation I don't agree with the investigation
1375.28s: but like they're outcome but they did look at it now again how just how fair how accurate that's
1381.84s: different and I think that there's a conversation to be had there but yeah and the the other thing is
1389.36s: the turning a blind eye is really interesting and culpabilities also very interesting in that
1396.08s: scenario that that would be a really interesting thing to dive into at some point but
1400.96s: Lawrence's Trump slings coin and dimsling stocks they all kind of suck I completely agree and it's
1407.04s: not just Dems by the way that slings stocks is for Republicans too you can see them all you can look at
1411.68s: the house and send it and you can see there's really great tools that let you monitor what they trade
1416.48s: there was a couple of them I saw recently that just started picking up a bunch of obscure names a couple
1421.60s: of them I've not even heard of and I've added them to a watch list because it would not be all too
1427.92s: shocking if they magically did well but here's the other thing and again I enjoy making the jokes
1435.76s: as much as anybody else but I also understand the reality of things right we make jokes about Nancy
1441.20s: Pelosi and how Nancy Pelosi's putting on these crazy trades and her portfolios doing really well
1446.80s: like let's let's actually take a look at it really quick because you'll see you'll see
1453.28s: Clifford quant they do a good job here so Clifford quant has a look at Pelosi's portfolio right
1466.48s: and you can see that she's done a great job she's had a overall from what is it 16 May of 2014
1475.60s: is 778% return versus the spy at 2019 the great return but here's the reality
1483.04s: of what her husband is doing and that is an important no it's not her trading she doesn't trade
1491.20s: it's her husband and her husband is a professional so
1499.44s: I'm grabbing Paul's details I'll always want to say in this stuff is because again sometimes people
1506.32s: to my topic with respect to like you know just like a joke and we forget the lens of things
1515.52s: but let's take a look so he founded and runs the venture capital firm financial leasing services
1522.08s: which he and his wife had a personal fortune about 114 they invested in Oakland invaders
1529.12s: Oakland invaders actually don't want to what is that
1536.40s: I had never heard of that before I'm not really familiar with American football so I don't really
1540.48s: know much I thought it was like the Oakland Raiders or something though anyways
1545.60s: within the U.S. football league okay so it's got to be something completely different then
1551.28s: oh is this soccer
1556.40s: whatever
1558.80s: he purchased a franchise and then
1562.08s: closed these success and stock trading attracted media attention of 2021
1569.04s: so the the dudes in investor right and it absolutely begs the question okay like what should
1576.08s: he be able to do and you know those kinds of things and I don't disagree with with any of that stuff
1580.72s: like all of that is completely okay to talk about but it's just important to note this isn't
1586.48s: Nancy Pelosi slain trades this is actually her husband who is an investor and then the other
1591.36s: thing that's really important to layer on top of that if we look at most of these positions
1596.32s: they're just leveraged long tack will no shit leveraged long tack has worked tremendously well
1608.08s: over the last decade and it's a no brainer of a position so if you look at just QQQ
1613.44s: the index itself and we go out over the last 10 years
1621.52s: pretty good 84 up to 540 right oh so all I'm saying is it's not like they're in there with like
1628.56s: these really nuanced names and buy and really short term and swing and stuff based on some sort of
1634.56s: news that just came out and they're playing the rise and then dumping out and getting out
1639.36s: going all the way back I don't think they should be able to trade I'm reiterating that point because
1643.44s: when I talk about this stuff some people start to get really defensive and they think that like
1647.68s: I'm justifying what they're doing I'm not but I'm trying to add context to people because we
1653.04s: lose the ability to objectively evaluate stuff and we start to paint this picture like Nancy Pelosi
1658.40s: is personally on there making a bunch of trades based on insider information that only she knows
1664.16s: and she's profiting off of it the reality is the majority of their returns come from leveraged
1672.96s: long positions via deep in the money leaps in text stocks Amazon Google in video
1682.80s: this is a stratt apple like there's not a lot of magic going on here now I still prefer to be
1691.20s: able to play the game and just pretend that Nancy Pelosi is slang in trades because I think it's hilarious
1696.80s: but as I make those jokes I understand the broader context behind so all that stuff aside
1703.12s: time actually you have to update we haven't done this in a while the eight map any new people in
1708.56s: here from different places a zax says no it's spring league football what is spring league football
1716.96s: I don't know what that is Joe says you should have around your trader podcast guy that would be
1726.32s: so funny hey hold on somebody gave people stuff age big shout out to my brother be skin sorry
1732.00s: that I missed that shout out to I'd rather be skin for who can a bunch of people up
1736.08s: with some memberships and support in the channel awesome I see Arizona and chilly let's see
1744.00s: if we have Arizona where in Arizona are you by the way my brother he's in flagstaff
1750.16s: we do have Arizona let me know where in Arizona and then we're in chilly we don't have chilly that's
1758.96s: great that's a new ad oh yeah Matt says agree but when they knew in 2020 the pandemic we're
1772.56s: going to work from home and they bought zoom was that was BS I bought zoom I'm just saying it's like
1783.04s: that that's not again from like an investors perspective if you see a global pandemic and we
1788.80s: started getting rumors really quick that things were closing we know teleworks a big deal
1794.24s: I bought a bunch of stuff I bought zoom Microsoft I bought quite a few names that have to deal
1801.84s: with from Google with remote work so yeah I mean again don't disagree they should be able to trade
1807.84s: single stocks I completely agree with that but it's like that's not like inside our information right
1813.36s: we we can we can see the pandemic going on outside we can make a reasonable deduction past there
1819.76s: that remote work might go up so it's just a good bet I got to open the door for talk
1825.92s: all right I'd rather be seeing says FYI great skiing and chilly funny enough
1844.80s: me and a couple partners we operate two ski resorts out of chilly so very familiar with chilly that's
1850.56s: actually why I was stoked on that and then Greenland oh Greenland sick that's such a win
1859.20s: that's like one of the big ones I've been trying to add to this
1862.80s: fuck yeah oh I think we had maybe we had you already you might be calling in
1872.24s: from capis sillet hell of a name all right let's figure out
1877.68s: let's figure out where we're at in this dd library let's sort it by date and then I think we did
1892.24s: this one and I think this is where we are now the bigger short let's zoom in oh damn
1908.64s: all right let's see preface though I think you really should consider reading because it's
1920.32s: important understand what's going on the market crash of oh wait never finished it was can
1926.16s: kicked in the same people who caused the crash still had been running rampant I mean it's not really
1933.60s: true to be honest as the market continues to be unregulated you're profiting off of short term
1941.92s: gains at the risk of killing their institutions another global economy only this time it's much much worse
1951.68s: so this is the problem I have with stuff like this to be honest is the the doom and gloom blends
1957.92s: is always in vogue right it's always look at somebody like Michael Burry Michael Burry is built in
1964.80s: entire following around essentially his really significant play that actually was so poorly timed
1974.72s: that he almost had to close the doors to his fund and it worked so the timing obviously wasn't that bad
1981.60s: but we look past those parts and we forget the the reality behind it and Burry has had a lot of
1989.04s: stuff on Twitter in the not so distant past where he's you know talking about sell the crash is
1993.52s: coming this is like another it seemed to leb kind of thing where we're trying to play the tales the
1999.92s: the markets in general are pretty effective they tend to go up so a couple like this hasn't
2009.36s: happened right like their original perspective of that the crash is still on her way it's kind
2015.44s: of like well then when does it happen if it's tied to this and supposedly now it's much much worse
2022.08s: but the other thing just to reiterate here is that the markets are regulated and
2029.84s: they're not doing the same thing in the derivative markets that they were before what happened in
2035.04s: oh a obviously had to do with credit default swaps and the bundling of mortgage back securities and
2043.60s: again it was completely completely insane what they were doing they were over leverage and stuff like
2049.92s: that not defending them but it's just that that was heavily regulated post that move so
2057.20s: just again something to be aware of so the bankers abuse smaller amounts of leverage for the
2065.84s: O8 bubble and have since abused much higher now there is higher aggregate leverage I actually
2070.48s: agree with that covid came in rock the economy to the point where the Fed is now pin between a rock
2076.08s: in a hard place in order to buy more time they triggered a flurry of protective measures
2081.04s: yeah the rich made a fatal error in way overshorting stocks there is a potential for their
2088.72s: decades of sucking money out of taxpayers to be taken back okay let's give it a go
2100.16s: up so they're talking about the background between a late and different derivatives
2114.24s: they're talking about borrowing for leverage okay yep so derivatives obviously super
2128.08s: leverage and this is not wrong this is completely correct and the leverage today is is massive
2135.28s: that's actually one of my biggest spheres to be completely honest with you with the broader market
2139.76s: if I'm to not go obviously super far down the doom and gloom path but just a realistic analysis of
2148.00s: things if we take a look at actually let me start a new chat with GPT I want to ask it
2156.08s: what is the current level average how has it trended over time I want to see what it gives me as a source
2177.76s: so it's looking at margin debt
2186.08s: okay let's continue through here just the process Jimmy what about you we're looking at Jimmy
2196.80s: what you mean homie we're in the the DD library for Jimmy so they're talking about
2206.88s: the leverage what happened with the bundling of securities
2217.68s: this is talking about essentially how Wall Street had been wildly compensated super profitable
2225.36s: leading into the crash that actually fun fact I have a couple friends that used to work at
2230.88s: some larger firms and they said even during 2008 like a lot of them did really well the
2237.36s: the firms and like post 2008 but they actually had to stop doing like their Christmas parties
2243.36s: because they used to have these really big extravagant Christmas parties and they knew that the
2247.44s: optics on that were terrible that you know people are losing their houses during 2008 and the banks
2253.04s: were doing really well so they literally stopped doing their Christmas parties because of that which is
2260.08s: really interesting so this is about the credit default swaps yeah yeah so this is all about
2271.20s: their perception and their understanding of the crash of oh wait which is fine I think we know most
2277.84s: the details on that okay here we go so now let's talking about essentially the new CDO game I'm
2286.56s: actually really interested what their perspective is here so we we did the house of cards DD
2294.24s: actually we saw that there's citing the bigger shorts Wall Street's cooked books okay
2308.96s: so they're talking about essentially bullshit supporting and not actually having the assets that
2316.16s: they're talking about to back the leverage.
2322.56s: mortgage back security still the link when see rates skyrocketed
2334.16s: hey
2347.04s: they're talking of uh interesting this is actually an interesting correlation that they've
2354.88s: identified essentially saying that as SLR protection dropped off the reverse repo market started
2363.20s: expanding but the reverse repo market started expanding for a lot of different reasons but this is
2368.48s: saying it's not up at a quarter where the quarter end significant strain on the economy the build-up
2373.84s: over time implies that there's significant strain on the market as of Q2 which is April 1st through
2379.36s: June 30th which I mean really the market was still decent there but
2391.04s: let's actually read that. A comment on the subreddit may be revisited of rule paths by the
2396.88s: ICC flew under the radar another sign for our crash coming they passed a new rule effective
2404.96s: 1 June 21 but let's see the principal purpose proposes to to modify ICC's fee schedules to
2415.36s: introduce credit default swap credit default index swapshin incentive programs for the second
2425.04s: half of 21 they do not require any changes the ICC they're providing incentive programs to purchase
2431.68s: credit default swap indices they're like standard credit default swaps but packaged together like
2437.44s: an index kind of like an index. Yeah that's a great analogy and it's essentially saying this is
2442.80s: allowing them to bid against a wide range of credit uh a CDOs or other entities buying it a cheaper
2448.72s: rate they can now bet against a wide range of failures in any market and they're allowing upwards of 25
2454.72s: discount well this is also going to provide a stabilization effect though which is one of the reasons
2459.60s: why there's an incentive behind it. Game stop was never going to cause the market to crash this
2466.08s: is interesting let's you they say the game stop was meant to die off the rich bed against it many
2471.20s: folds over and it was on the brink of bankruptcy before many conditions led to where it is today
2474.96s: completely cracked that's exactly what happened as far as I could tell it was in the middle of being
2479.92s: seller box down to bankruptcy it was never going to cause the market crash and it will and it
2487.28s: never will cause the crash the short squeeze is a result of I abuse of the derivatives market over
2492.88s: the past decade we're all streets abuse of this market is prime the economy for another market crash
2497.84s: of their own. I agree with the abuse of the derivatives market and the overall risk there but
2507.36s: there we've we've seen some really smart people especially like CEO what was it of IB talking about
2514.88s: it I think that this is underselling the potential that game stop could have had on actually like
2520.64s: genuinely starting a broad scale might not be full crash it could have been a full crash we we don't really
2526.48s: know but I do think that there's a little bit more power behind it than what this might be
2534.88s: alluding to game stop was a non issue in the markets let's see failure 1% how game stop can
2544.32s: deal a fatal blow to wealth inequality Jesus so one of the things that I don't like with stuff like this
2557.04s: is it's creating such an us versus them mentality and it's broad just broad
2567.36s: bucketing people together which is almost always in ignorant perspective right so to something like
2575.12s: this say the failure of the 1% how they can deal a fatal blow to wealth inequality the the 1%
2585.52s: that that's not a small group of people there's a lot of people in that 1% so to summarize essentially
2595.92s: all of them into the same bucket is very frequently just a logical conclusion to come to
2604.96s: which again is worth noting I think if we're going to have accusations in a cost entities we should
2613.12s: be very specific we shouldn't say the 1% it's a very broad generalization and it's kind of
2619.12s: reckless to do something like that actually let's see real quick like what considers I'm probably in
2624.48s: that let me see what is considered the top 1% in the US I accidentally did you a one stick
2634.80s: what is considered the top 1% in the US typically defined by income and net worth
2647.92s: being in the top 1% of earners worldwide household generally needs an annual income of $787,000
2655.04s: yeah 2024 report by night frank indicates an individual requires a net worth of 5.8 million to
2667.44s: be in the top 1% other analysts suggest that threshold might be higher around 11.6 million that's a big gap
2674.72s: but there's a lot of people in that and based on some of those I I'm also in that so
2683.04s: the thing is there's a lot of people in this just pro generalizations are typically better to stay away from
2689.68s: in my opinion with something like this we should be very specific because we have some very specific
2694.64s: areas to point that not kind of a lazy generalization but anyway let's continue
2702.72s: 1% the short interest was 140% which we've done a bunch of duty on that we know that it
2711.84s: is even higher than that at points and it's insane right the fact that larger than the float is
2718.24s: short it is complete fucking bullshit there's no world where that should be even remotely possible
2725.20s: and a lot of that has to also do with the phantom shares that we were talking about so this is a
2730.64s: great callout maybe it's 2% 200% back then 480% who knows so essentially and I agree with the
2736.72s: point they're making here too the fact that the number literally was bullshit once you see it over
2741.28s: 100% it's all fucking fake and it's really difficult to tell how many fake shares are out there
2747.12s: and leading to all these fake proxies so I agree with this you can hopefully gather that wall street
2753.60s: takes on massive risks all the time they do not care as long as it turns out short term profits now
2758.48s: again this is also I think a mistake and a mischaracterization wall street really obviously
2766.00s: cares about short term profits but they're not thinking of how do I make a buck this month
2771.36s: they're strategic thinking and they're they're thinking of industry trends that are going
2776.56s: to unfold over the next decade to sell them short and undermine their overall intelligence to just
2783.84s: myopic focus on short term profits is a mixed mischaracterization of them wholly and again it's the
2791.44s: same thing in the military one of the most dangerous things you can do in the military is underestimate
2796.80s: your enemy a lot of times that's how you get dead so this I believe is underestimating the total
2804.88s: prowess of wall street quote unquote which is obviously a big grouping another broad generalization
2812.24s: but in this case I understand their general point they're not over archingly focused
2818.88s: on short term profits their dynasties they're thinking quite longer term
2828.48s: they sway policies fatal blow to wealth inequality yeah completely agree the wealth inequality is a
2835.28s: much bigger thing than even just the markets or even just the US economy or even just the US
2841.84s: wealth inequality is a pretty significant issue to tackle and that's a much broader topic than
2849.52s: for this stream but like a lot of things like that it's heavily complex so the one thing I always
2857.44s: try to remind people of is we you know passively discuss these really big topics like that is our
2865.44s: really simple explanations and desires for stuff like this tend to fall woofly short of just how
2875.92s: much goes into the problem itself it's very complex so the conditions that led to game
2882.72s: stop word is today is a miracle itself I agree the support of retail traders has led to
2887.44s: expose a fatal mistake of the rich again another really big characterization that I don't like
2894.40s: because a short position has infinite loss potential which is true but not true and the reason why
2902.16s: I tell people it's true but not true is the reason why it's not infinite sooner or later you literally
2910.56s: consume all available resources and I know it's a dramatic example but there's a difference between
2916.48s: that and infinite it was not actually infinite there's so much money in the world especially in
2922.88s: the derivatives market this should scream to you that any price that you think is low could
2927.36s: very will be extremely low on your perspective you might just be accustomed to thinking x dollar
2932.56s: price floors too much money no I can hit that the market crashing no longer was a matter of
2940.00s: simply scooping up defaulters it's not a fighting in smell of incited L.72 it's a battle against
2948.32s: the entire financial world that's pretty significant there's speculation from multiple people
2954.32s: that the Fed is going to be complicit right now helping suppress game stop that's another pretty
2960.16s: significant accusation don't you think they'd fight tooth and nail to suppress this and try to
2966.16s: get everyone to sell now this goes back to another current state deviation from this that I do
2974.24s: think is also worth pointing out and the current state deviation being with the the offerings
2981.92s: and game stop shares being less scarce I think it undermines a lot of these ideas now in terms of
2991.20s: essentially the float being locked up and then shares being scarce if shares are abundant then
2997.68s: it short circuits a lot of the potential ideas like this so the other thing is I honestly don't
3007.76s: really see see this is what I honestly don't like is that we spend a lot of time talking about
3018.08s: 2008 which is good I think everybody should be familiar with that but then the actual tying it to game
3024.16s: stop is essentially this page this page and then a meme it's like very shallow so let's anyway
3035.04s: finish this and see if maybe there's a big connecting dot here. Reverts to the other rules that
3040.64s: look good for my last I see them in a negative light they're passing others to prevent a game
3045.20s: such game stop situation from ever occurring again they realize how much power retail could have
3050.24s: from piling in a short squeeze play these new rules snap new emerging short squeeze is instantly
3056.40s: if the conditions of a short squeeze ever occur again it'll never be a game stop situation after this
3062.88s: well this wasn't true there was a situation this year it's their game after all they've been
3068.32s: abusing the derivative market that it had the rich again broad generalization are now at risk of
3076.88s: losing that money and insane amounts of cash that they've accumulated over the year the housing market of OA
3086.80s: yeah I mean okay so let's just do quick pros and cons pros I really liked the historical overview
3094.56s: of the 2008 crash I think that there's a lot to learn from that I also think that there's
3101.76s: good amount of discussion around various derivative products the cons a lot of the main premise is
3108.72s: they break down and it just becomes a lot of speculation and then it becomes a lot of
3114.88s: rooting and us versus them I think as much as we can keep things quantitative qualitative
3123.04s: I one more reporting out like this the better off we are because then it's not a game of I feel
3129.12s: blank is unfair or I don't like this or I don't like that and it literally becomes a game of
3135.04s: of pointing at things like we can with naked shorts for example like we can quantitatively point
3141.52s: at the short floating at 140% and be like what the fuck there's a hundred percent of the stock
3149.60s: you're telling me 140% of it is shorted make that make sense like that's a great data point
3156.40s: to point out into to pull out and extrapolate some of the broader themes that they're talking about
3161.36s: like the manipulation and whatnot but yeah okay interesting we'll take a look at another one
3169.28s: the bigger short was this one this one is a logo meme is it's just memes
3178.16s: it is memes okay this is a 140 pages let's get to work
3186.64s: and I'm stuck anybody give me the context behind this one
3201.04s: help HALP I love front butts I don't think you do I don't think anybody likes front butts
3211.60s: that's bad news why is game stop traded overnight and AMC is not is that the case
3228.72s: I'm just looking them up really quick
3241.68s: um
3250.08s: let me see
3264.96s: okay we know that game stop does obviously but I'm curious about
3270.88s: I mean it looks like AMC does trade after hours
3283.12s: here
3292.88s: so the reason why you might not see it is it could just be because it's really low volume
3298.56s: but it does look like it trades after hours as far as I can see
3305.68s: and it looks like we don't know this meme got it
3309.36s: HALGUS says what about making all short positions public what's your opinion
3314.56s: I don't think it should be public specific to the firm but I actually think the new
3318.56s: reg show release that's gonna force them to comply with reporting their short positions
3327.04s: and then the SEC essentially will combine them I think that's good I like that a lot but
3335.36s: I don't think every firm needs to publicly show every single position it has
3342.08s: that starts to create a little bit well perpetually I should say it starts to make it
3348.16s: really difficult for the firms essentially to do their job because they're playing a lot of games against
3353.12s: one another and that information could become difficult to manage that's one of the
3358.96s: advance of dark pools which dark pools are now being abused the the whole origin of a dark pool
3364.96s: was actually a very reasonable idea and it's because we would essentially see
3371.52s: we would essentially see entities front running big block trades and then they couldn't get
3380.88s: a actual trade through without being ran up massively so dark pools were built originally to fix that
3387.84s: but like I said that they definitely are being abused for sure
3401.52s: had to figure out in our order but we on it this is great mel ahead mel had a whole list of stuff
3414.24s: made it easy
3423.20s: all right
3425.84s: let me just get this plugged in quick
3444.96s: and we gooch there's like these two different kinds of
3451.36s: tacos that I typically get there's like a chicken one and then a carnius out of one with good
3461.76s: Fazi says confirmed with the second meme yeah it's actually hilarious if it's I thought it was going to be
3466.88s: more specific
3471.36s: okay unless you guys feel really compelled to like go through this I think we can fly through this pretty
3481.28s: quick
3485.92s: because it's honestly just kind of talking about doing lego meme
3500.96s: I don't know about most of the lego memes essentially just saying that they like lego memes
3510.48s: that that's kind of backwards to me
3516.24s: that's the kind of hilarious but
3522.80s: yeah yeah yeah yeah
3531.20s: this was one of my favorite memes that went around
3537.84s: that's terrible as a lego meme to be completely honest like this is not this looks fucking weird
3543.68s: but the the cat is just so good
3549.84s: okay
3566.72s: okay this is what we want super strong
3568.64s: everything is not awesome that's funny
3580.08s: okay this looks good
3599.68s: that last one was good all right on of the next with time we got we got time for one more
3609.60s: with all the kuntash that is like one of the most beautiful Lamborghini's ever
3619.92s: I love the kuntash
3624.56s: probably should take a quick look at the Lamborghini kunt
3639.60s: man look at that thing these are just gorgeous so so cool
3649.28s: I love these
3662.08s: oh they have like a bunch of car stuff in here this is kind of fun
3664.48s: good old erato man I'm really curious how much effort it takes to make these different
3675.04s: magazines
3677.52s: um
3690.64s: just trying to see if there's any like DD in here it looks just kind of like a
3696.00s: a series of retelling of hails that's actually really cool
3701.28s: but I didn't really see anything in here that was actual DD
3705.60s: we got how long are these ones
3708.96s: oh they're not that long all right let's we should at least finish this row
3724.56s: get the fuck out of here
3734.64s: so they're letting you know on every day we've looked at so far you're not selling
3744.08s: oh Docker
3753.52s: they'll not selling
3758.32s: okay this was an easy one
3760.72s: all right let's see what this is this looks like it might be DD
3766.00s: hey DD wait we read this one already
3772.08s: yeah we read this one
3774.32s: so this one was also in the diamond handbook I remember this one
3783.04s: this was the original issue yeah so this was talking about FDDs it was talking about the
3788.72s: issues that they have with DTC
3792.00s: I remember this one and then I'm assuming this one's the second part of that them yeah
3797.84s: I remember looking at this
3809.20s: this is them talking about the bullshit fines and then how many errors there were in reporting
3816.72s: okay the now we're on definitely think we saw this one too
3828.08s: yeah we saw we definitely read this one
3832.16s: this was talking about the miss pricing of shorts
3837.12s: or the uh that the miss reporting I should say okay so now we are on
3847.60s: column two
3851.04s: row four
3854.16s: leave off
3857.60s: column two
3859.36s: row four
3860.08s: swatese anything else you guys want to hit
3864.80s: game stop related not game stop related um anything that you want to take a look at
3869.04s: we could take a quick peek at the updated coverage triangle if you want we have a couple
3872.96s: minutes or happy to also wrap we can do the coverage triangle update in the Tuesday video
3877.12s: that's really where it goes anyways so far the DD library there's a lot of humor in it this is my
3884.24s: favorite so far by far the the diamond handbook because there is actually a lot of actual research in DD
3891.12s: in there and I actually think the bigger short although I there's a lot of stuff about it I didn't
3897.28s: like fully care for I like that it's actually again an attempt that due diligence and research I
3902.96s: like I appreciate that quite a lot and then the house of cards obviously but we've already seen that one
3908.00s: so I'm curious how much in here actually is going to be DD versus just kind of playing
3914.96s: there's a lot to go through for sure but if a lot of it is like memes and stuff like that will
3919.84s: probably roll through it pretty fast I think so awesome well then that's where we'll hang up for today
3928.72s: if you guys need anything let me know we have our outlier pro market prep stream tomorrow and then
3934.80s: standard live stream on Monday so see everybody around if you need anything hit me up
3940.88s: be an outlier being ape you'll learn
