0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  you
180.00s:  you
210.00s:  you
240.00s:  another epidural on Monday to continue trying to heal this bad boy. Definitely the longest
245.50s:  injury I've ever had. It's taught me a lot, actually, about myself, about my life,
249.64s:  about my dad, which is a really strange topic, not worth going into here. But yeah, that's
256.64s:  been interesting. But the cool part about not being able to train is I've been spending
261.52s:  a lot of time kind of watching tape and just researching and doing the best I can to
268.54s:  learn not through obviously being able to go through the physical pieces, but being
272.46s:  able to just monitor and watch stuff and learn that by. So yeah, I just, I think Strickland
279.10s:  won that first fight. The most frustrating part is like the UFC when things go to the
283.84s:  judges, you know, the biggest thing is damage. And if you just look at the dude's faces
289.38s:  at the end of that fight, do plus he was fucked up. Strickland doesn't didn't really
294.02s:  look like he had been touched. So. And then he obviously had the headbutt, which cut
301.48s:  his eye, but other than a cut. Yeah, interesting first fight, but that is also the downside of
308.52s:  somebody like Strickland is that he is, I mean, generally more of a points fighter, right?
314.50s:  Like you're going to see one, two's and teaps, lots of one, two teaps, which are good.
318.62s:  It's effective, but that brings it and it puts it in a judge's hands versus somebody
325.32s:  that's just flooring people all over the place. There's, I mean, that's mostly heavy weights.
330.46s:  But let's get over to the main screen. And let's take peak at where GameStop current is.
341.02s:  So GameStop current analysis. Let's see. This is unfortunate to me. So this part is unfortunate
353.52s:  for a few reasons. This breakdown below this level, and I already flagged it to you guys
359.96s:  in my opinion, as a pretty key level from just an accumulation, distribution, style perspective
366.20s:  and it's looking very, very, I mean, it's trading right down essentially to the 200 day
373.10s:  MA. This, there's not a lot of volume here. So one of the things I had noted when we spoke
380.74s:  about this last time is I felt that this relationship in there was super important in that
389.58s:  a break below this likely would mean a likely extension to the downside. So as soon as
396.46s:  it broke below this, I actually had bought puts. This is separate from the coverage
401.34s:  strangle that I talked you all about. And I had bought puts, expecting something to this
407.54s:  degree, some sort of actual downside velocity picking up, not that I'm long term bearish
413.30s:  on GameStop or anything, but as I remind everybody, I'm a trader, right? So I make money.
421.26s:  So I make money from movement. I don't get to just trade the way that I want things to
426.74s:  go. I just trade them as they are. So yeah, I did buy puts. I still have the coverage
431.74s:  strangle on. We can run through obviously that whole position. I normally do that on the
435.46s:  Tuesday video. So everything, I mean, no real changes with the coverage strangle side
440.18s:  of things. I am glad that I scaled down a little bit on the shares that was in hindsight,
445.54s:  a smart move. A lot of that was based on intuition. But when you see something breaking down
450.18s:  like this, you generally have to wait until there's some sort of stronger catalyst for
455.74s:  an upside. This is distribution. So this is some sort of larger entity or series of entities
463.46s:  that are unwinding their positions. This that's not to say that that's people trying to force
468.50s:  the price down and stuff like that. It could be it could not be. I don't know. But this
472.22s:  is following a very standard blow, especially with something like this where we had that
477.54s:  really big down day that was on no news. A lot of times that will be marked by selling
484.14s:  from some sort of entity. And there's a good chance that some sort of institutional
489.10s:  trading firm made a lot of money on this because there was a ton of accumulation happening
494.78s:  all through here and all through here. So this absolutely can just be something that's
500.70s:  like, OK, I see this starting to trail down. I'm going to take my profits because again,
505.58s:  from the coverage strangle perspective, the way I trade that typically is not dissimilar
510.66s:  to that because here's the way that it typically works, especially from a trader's lens. If
517.66s:  let's say I bought in here and the stock rallies, which is great. And then it starts to roll
524.70s:  over. Well, from a trading lens, what I don't want to do is just hold it while all of the
532.74s:  gains that I accumulated here a road away, I get nothing from that. At the end of that position,
539.18s:  I essentially am back where I started. The only thing that has occurred is time has passed
544.66s:  and I have nothing to show for it. So a lot of times what I like to do is if I'm scaling in
550.58s:  and here, the stock is rallying. And then essentially, I'll just regardless of what percentage
558.14s:  move it is and regardless of all that kind of stuff, what I do is I just monitor breakdowns.
563.90s:  And if the trend starts reversing, I'll begin scaling out of the position to take up risk
568.46s:  to realize the gain. And if I realize that gain, then I'm able to buy more when it starts
576.94s:  consolidating. But now that's really the game is to see like when this consolidation happens.
584.38s:  And I think it's a little early to tell. I mean, this is the next spot that typically would
593.78s:  be flagged for consolidation would be something around here, the 200 day MA. That's a generally
598.26s:  large moving average. And then below that, it's down here down in the 22 handle. So I know
605.50s:  a lot of people when I first was talking about the possibility of it going to 26 and a half
610.66s:  and then 25 and a half, I actually got some hate mail about that people. I know people are so
616.90s:  emotional about the stock and they don't want to even, you know, fathom it going down. But the reality
624.66s:  is even game stop like most other stocks, it's still going to have an ebb and flow that's
631.34s:  naturally going to occur with it. It's just how things are. And then you add the elements
636.94s:  on top of that. And there definitely are some suspicious elements with respect to manipulation.
643.70s:  Like that is absolutely something. And I actually wanted to talk about a comment that I got
650.38s:  one second. Two of them. Actually, this one I thought was funny. So I thought I would show
660.46s:  you guys this one. So this was a comment from somebody that I obviously don't know. And it was on
668.06s:  a YouTube short that I had made. And it literally cracked me up because I was wearing like, it was
676.22s:  like a North phase zip up. And this was talking about how sometimes understanding what returns are
682.62s:  possible for traders can be uncomfortable. Like when you realize that, you know, 50% returns
688.22s:  year over year probably aren't happening. And this person says only thing uncomfortable here is
695.10s:  I saw of a shirt you were wearing. Just think of where you have to be in life that this comment
708.46s:  goes through your brain and then goes through your fingers. I just love that so much. So I thought I
716.14s:  would share that that joy with you. But joking comments aside, there was actually an important
723.82s:  comment this one here. And this is from, oh, that's funny. I was wearing the same shirt in this one.
733.34s:  Hold on, I missed it. I wanted to highlight it for you guys this one. This is a, this is an
741.50s:  interesting question. So coffee's coffee donuts and Homer had a really interesting question that I
754.14s:  do think is worth discussing. And they're saying after all you've seen with GameStop, how can you
760.86s:  say the market makers don't want to hurt retail traders? And the, for those that didn't see the short,
768.14s:  this YouTube short is essentially saying the market is indifferent to you. So what I mean by that is
774.54s:  the market doesn't care that you need to make or want to make or trying to make 1% this week,
779.18s:  this month, this, whatever, that the market doesn't care what you are trying to do, what your
784.22s:  preferences are, what your needs are, that the market is indifferent to your existence. So that's
790.86s:  the context of that video. I actually didn't even really talk much about market makers in there,
794.62s:  but I think that's why they added the market makers in there because they're bundling them in
798.46s:  that broader market concept. And it says the system is set up for the 1%. There is no oversight.
804.54s:  Congress trades on insider info for fuck's sake, SEC and FBI turn a blind eye when the buy button
811.58s:  was turned off in GameStop in 2021. So the first thing is I want to start with the way that I
824.46s:  look at things. There's a lot of emotion and understandably so in this comment. I fully understand
832.86s:  why they're so emotional and why that's coming through in this comment. But here's the reality.
840.70s:  Market makers, they're not out to hurt retail traders. Now market makers are absolutely out to
852.38s:  make as much money as they possibly can. Now the difference there might sound like there is no
865.74s:  difference, but there is a difference there and it's subtle. There's a big difference between a
871.42s:  system that incentivizes different behaviors to make as much money as humanly possible, which is
876.38s:  what they do versus doing things to hurt an entity. The reason why I'm flagging this difference
884.38s:  is because this develops a victim mindset. If we go into this thinking that people are purposefully
892.46s:  trying to poach us that are trying to hurt us that are trying to say how can I fuck up this person
897.98s:  over here? It completely skews our perception of the game that we're playing. So the reality is
904.78s:  the market in general simply is indifferent to you. That indifference can absolutely result in you
912.54s:  having trades that lose or your P&L going down. Yeah, that indifference is a thing because it's
917.42s:  a competitive space. People are trying to make money. Then you overlay some of the fuckery that we
923.02s:  clearly can see in GameStop and not just GameStop in other stocks with naked shorting and FTDs.
931.26s:  And the fact that they're playing the plumbing of the system, again, they're playing the plumbing
937.66s:  of the system not to hurt retail traders outright. It's because they can make more money doing so.
945.26s:  So it's an incentive-based structure. There isn't an incentive for them to hurt any entity.
951.50s:  And when I say her, obviously, it won't be in physical, but I mean in terms of like trying to
955.02s:  screw them over. The way that the system is incentivized is literally to play the game within
961.90s:  the bounds as best as you can to make as much money as you possibly can. And that actually goes into
966.70s:  this here. Congress trading on insider information. Here's the reality. What Congress does as far
973.02s:  as their trading is perfectly legal. It's not insider trading. It's perfectly legal. I want to be
980.30s:  super clear. I couldn't disagree with it anymore if possible. The fact when you're in professional
987.50s:  services jobs as a peasant, right? Like if you're a consultant at a consulting firm, there's really
994.62s:  strict requirements on what you can trade. And as a consultant, you don't see shit. The only thing
1001.02s:  you're doing, the only thing you're doing is moving shit on a slide deck around and making sure
1007.66s:  everything is perfect. That's it, bro. That is it. But the appearance of any sort of
1017.02s:  fuckery going on there is against the, it really opposes the professional reputation of the firm
1023.58s:  and they will have it. So the reality is Congress does seem to trade on privileged information.
1032.54s:  And I don't disagree with it. I don't like that. I think it should be gone. It, to me, it's a
1037.02s:  fucking no brainer thing to be gone. But it's not illegal. So tying it to insider info,
1044.70s:  which is illegal is again, just kind of crossing streams a little bit. And this is what happens
1050.62s:  when we start to view the entire system is stacked against us. We look at everything through
1055.74s:  the lens of how, well, how is this designed to screw me over? And again, I'm not saying that it's
1061.74s:  not, I'm not saying that there are disadvantages. There are. But it's not quite as adversarial to
1069.34s:  that degree. Now again, in terms of the system set up for the 1%. I actually, like, I was actually
1076.30s:  just talking with my wife about this. One of the things I think about is why is it that if you're
1081.98s:  trying to contribute to IRA, you can contribute $7,000. What the fuck? Like what? If we were actually
1094.22s:  designed to try to help people get to retirement and not be strapped for cash and not have to live
1100.46s:  just off of social security, like, why the fuck are we kept at seven? Right? That's fucked. But
1107.98s:  those kinds of things aside, the reality is there are a lot of inequities. But that doesn't inherently
1118.70s:  mean that the system is directly out to get you. Now, one of the other things with respect to
1124.78s:  congressional trading, there's a few things in mind. Now, again, I want to be really clear.
1130.78s:  I think first and foremost, they, if they're to put on any positions, they should only be able to
1138.46s:  put on ETFs, right? That standard most places abide by that kind of rule where anybody has any sort of
1147.02s:  insider level information. So definitely the case. Now, there's another reality, though.
1154.78s:  And it's, again, it's up for a conversation. It depends on your belief systems and what you think.
1160.38s:  But if you look at, let's look at a few things.
1171.74s:  So, I don't know about, I don't really care about that.
1179.90s:  For all members of the House of Representatives and Senate, they're getting $174,000.
1186.14s:  The majority party leader is 193, minorities 193, so on and so forth. So, they're not making bad money,
1197.58s:  but they're not making great money. And I know that that might sound crazy for people that are
1202.54s:  like in a $30, $40,000 per year job. And I understand how that can sound. But the reality is
1211.26s:  a lot of these people are pretty high-powered. They have strong backgrounds. And if they were to work
1219.74s:  in a corporate equivalent, they could make way more money. But a lot of them venture into government.
1227.42s:  I honestly don't believe for altruistic reasons. But taking this back to the trading thing,
1234.22s:  part of it is trying to set up an incentive structure so that smart people that have better
1241.42s:  alternatives to make more money elsewhere still want to do the job. And I'm not saying that this
1247.02s:  is right. And I'm not saying that they should trade. They shouldn't. I'm just offering that
1251.10s:  as a thought process for the broader problem that exists here. Because a lot of people look at
1257.74s:  government and they essentially just say, well, they shouldn't be able to make that kind of money,
1261.18s:  they shouldn't be able to trade. They shouldn't be able to do this. And then you start adding a bunch
1265.26s:  of those should have is on top of that. And then when you actually have really highly qualified people,
1269.90s:  they're like, well, why the fuck would I do this? Right? It just doesn't make sense at that point. So
1279.98s:  again, to be super clear, I don't think they should be able to trade. I don't. I think it's crazy
1284.22s:  that they can trade individual names. I think it's fucked. But I do think that this highlights one
1289.50s:  of the underlying incentives and why they still are able to they can close that hole pretty quick
1297.42s:  if they were so inclined. But what ends up happening is a couple of people rally together. I know
1302.46s:  AOC is one of them and another, a couple of other people banded together was actually bipartisan.
1307.74s:  It was a Republican and a Democrat that were like, yeah, this is why why can Congress trade like
1313.26s:  this is absolutely ridiculous. And somehow those bills never go anywhere. There's never any law
1319.50s:  passed on that. And it highlights some of again, the incentive structure. So that the main takeaway is
1326.94s:  I think looking at their ability to trade individual stocks, I agree. It's crazy. But I think to
1334.22s:  look at really complex problems in a really simplistic lens and just say, you know, they shouldn't
1340.70s:  be able to do that. Then you really have to think about what the compensation and stuff like that
1346.06s:  should be to have like actually genuinely qualified people in there to do a good job. So
1353.02s:  really, really tricky tricky problem set. I think that there's no world that they should be
1357.58s:  able to trade individual names like that's absolutely crazy. So and then he says SEC and FBI
1363.82s:  turned a blind eye when the buy button was turned off. And again, like the SEC didn't turn a blind
1368.46s:  eye. They didn't investigation. Now, even for that investigation, I don't agree with the investigation.
1375.18s:  But like their outcome, but they did look at it. Now again, how just how fair how accurate.
1381.58s:  That's different. And I think that there's a conversation to be had there. But yeah. And the other
1388.06s:  thing is the turning a blind eye is really interesting. And culpabilities also very interesting in
1395.74s:  that scenario. That that would be a really interesting thing to dive into at some point. But
1402.14s:  Lawrence is Trump slings coin and dem slings stocks. They all kind of suck. I completely agree.
1406.70s:  And it's not just Dems. By the way, that's slings stocks. It's Republicans too. You can see them all.
1411.10s:  You can look at the House and Senate and you can see there's really great tools that let you monitor
1415.90s:  what they trade. There was a couple of them I saw recently that just started picking up a bunch
1420.22s:  of obscure names. A couple of them I've not even heard of. And I've added them to a watch list
1424.94s:  because it would not be all too shocking if they magically did well. But here's the other thing.
1432.14s:  And again, I enjoy making the jokes as much as anybody else. But I also understand the reality
1438.78s:  of things. Right. We make jokes about Nancy Pelosi and how Nancy Pelosi is putting on these crazy
1444.46s:  trades and her portfolios doing really well. Like let's actually take a look at it really quick.
1449.18s:  Because you'll see you'll see a quiver quant. They do a good job here.
1459.74s:  So quiver quant has a look at Pelosi's portfolio. Right. And you can see that she's done a great job.
1469.74s:  She's had a overall from what is it 16 May of 2014 is 778 percent returned versus the
1478.06s:  spy at 219. It's a great return. But here's the reality of what her husband is doing. And that
1487.58s:  is an important no, it's not her trading. She doesn't trade. It's her husband. And her husband is
1493.90s:  a professional. So I'm grabbing Paul's details. The only reason I'm saying this stuff is because
1504.30s:  again, sometimes people get a little too myopic with respect to like, you know, just like a joke.
1512.46s:  And we forget the lens of things. But let's take a look. So he founded and runs the venture capital
1519.90s:  firm financial leasing services, which he and his wife had a personal fortune. About 1114,
1526.78s:  they invested in Oakland invaders. Oakland invaders actually don't know what is that.
1534.54s:  I had never heard of that before. I'm not really familiar with American football. So I don't
1540.22s:  really know much. I thought it was like the Oakland Raiders or something. But anyways,
1545.58s:  within the US football league. Okay. So it's got to be something completely different than.
1551.26s:  Oh, is this soccer?
1552.54s:  Whatever. He purchased a franchise and then
1563.42s:  Pelosi's success in stock trading attracted media attention of 2021.
1568.94s:  So the dude's an investor, right? And it absolutely begs the question, okay, like what should
1576.06s:  he be able to do? And you know, those kinds of things. And I don't disagree with with any of
1580.22s:  that stuff. Like all of that is completely okay to talk about. But it's just important to note,
1585.98s:  this isn't Nancy Pelosi slaying trades. This is actually her husband who is an investor.
1590.54s:  And then the other thing that's really important to layer on top of that. If we look at most of
1595.18s:  these positions, they're just leveraged long tech. Well, no shit, leveraged long tech has worked
1606.14s:  tremendously well over the last decade. And it's a no brainer of a position. So if you look at
1612.54s:  just QQQ, the index itself. And we go out over the last 10 years.
1621.58s:  Pretty good. 84 up to 540. Right. So all I'm saying is it's not like they're in there with like
1628.54s:  these really nuanced names and buy in really short term and swing and stuff based on some sort of
1634.54s:  news that just came out and they're playing the rise and then dumping out and getting out going
1639.58s:  all the way back. I don't think they should be able to trade. I'm reiterating that point because
1643.42s:  when I talk about this stuff, some people start to get really defensive and they think that like I'm
1648.14s:  justifying what they're doing. I'm not. But I'm trying to add context to people because we lose
1653.26s:  the ability to objectively evaluate stuff. And we start to paint this picture like Nancy Pelosi
1658.38s:  is personally on there making a bunch of trades based on insider information that only she knows.
1664.06s:  And she's profiting off of it. The reality is
1670.14s:  the majority of their returns come from leveraged long positions via deep in the money leaps
1675.74s:  in tech stocks. Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Vista Strat, Apple, like there's not a lot of magic going
1688.14s:  on here. Now I still prefer to be able to play the game and just pretend that Nancy Pelosi is
1694.46s:  slaying in trades because I think it's hilarious. But as I make those jokes, I understand the broader
1699.02s:  context behind it. So all that stuff aside, time, actually, we have to update. We haven't done this
1705.50s:  in a while. The eight map. Any new people in here from different places? Azax says no, it's spring
1713.34s:  league football. What is spring league football? I don't know what that is.
1723.26s:  Joe says you should have her on your trade or podcast. God, that would be so funny.
1727.42s:  Hey, hold on. Somebody gave people stuff. Hey, big shout out to I'd rather be skiing. Sorry
1731.98s:  that I missed that. Shout out to I'd rather be skiing for hooking a bunch of people up with some
1736.38s:  memberships and support in the channel. Awesome. I see Arizona in chilly. Let's see if we have
1744.54s:  Arizona. Where in Arizona? Are you, by the way, my brother, he's in Flagstaff.
1750.14s:  We do have Arizona. Let me know where in Arizona. And then where in chilly? We don't have chili.
1758.70s:  That's great. That's a new ad. Hell yeah.
1768.70s:  Matt says agree. But when they knew in 2020, the pandemic, we're going to work from home and they
1773.90s:  bought Zoom was that was BS. I bought Zoom. I'm just saying. That's not, again, from like an
1785.26s:  investor's perspective, if you see a global pandemic and we started getting rumors really quick
1790.62s:  that things were closing, we know teleworks a big deal. I bought a bunch of stuff. I bought Zoom,
1796.06s:  Microsoft, I bought quite a few names that have to deal with Google with remote work. So yeah,
1805.42s:  I mean, again, don't disagree. They should be able to trade single stocks. I completely agree
1809.18s:  with that. But it's like, that's not like insider information, right? We can see the pandemic going
1815.18s:  on outside. We can make a reasonable deduction pass there that remote work might go up. So it's
1822.78s:  just a good bet. I got to open the door for the talk.
1835.66s:  All right.
1836.22s:  I'd rather be seeing says FYI great skiing and chilly. Funny enough, me and a couple partners,
1845.82s:  we operate two ski resorts out of chilly. So very familiar with chilly. That's actually why I was stoked
1851.26s:  on that. And then Greenland. Oh, Greenland sick. That's such a win. That's like one of the big ones
1860.38s:  I've been trying to add to this. Fuck yeah. Oh, I think we had maybe we had you already.
1869.26s:  You might be calling in from Capis, Cillet, hell of a name. All right, let's figure out
1879.18s:  let's figure out where we're at in this D.D. library.
1882.06s:  Let's sort it by date. And then I think we did this one. And I think this is where we are now.
1898.22s:  The bigger short. Let's zoom in. Oh, damn.
1912.86s:  All right, let's see.
1916.62s:  Preface though, I think you really should consider reading because it's important to understand what's
1921.10s:  going on. The market crash of 08 never finished. It was canned, kicked in the same people who caused
1927.50s:  the crash. Still have been running rampant. I mean, it's not really true to be honest.
1935.58s:  Because the market continues to be unregulated.
1940.46s:  You're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and the
1944.14s:  global economy. Only this time it's much, much worse.
1951.74s:  So this is the problem I have with stuff like this to be honest is the the doom and gloom
1957.34s:  lens is always in vogue. Right. It's always look at somebody like Michael Burry. Michael Burry is
1964.22s:  built an entire following around essentially his really significant play that actually was so
1973.90s:  poorly timed that he almost had to close the doors to his fund. And it worked. So the timing
1979.98s:  obviously wasn't that bad. But we look past those parts and we forget the reality behind it.
1986.86s:  And Burry has had a lot of stuff on Twitter in the Natsudistan past worries, you know, talking
1992.38s:  about sell. The crash is coming. This is like another Nassim Teleb kind of thing where we're
1996.78s:  trying to play the tails. The markets in general are pretty effective. They tend to go up.
2006.22s:  So a couple like this hasn't happened, right? Like their original perspective of that the crash
2013.98s:  is still underway. It's kind of like well, then when does it happen if it's tied to this? And
2019.90s:  supposedly now it's much, much worse. But the other thing just to reiterate here is that the markets
2026.54s:  are regulated. And they're not doing the same thing in the derivative markets that they were before.
2034.14s:  What happened in O A obviously had to do with credit default swaps and the bundling of
2041.58s:  mortgage-backed securities. And again, it was completely, completely insane what they were doing.
2048.62s:  They were overlavered and stuff like that, not defending them. But it's just that that was heavily
2054.38s:  regulated post that move. So just again, something to be aware of. So the bankers abuse smaller amounts
2064.54s:  of leverage for the O A bubble and have since abused much higher. Now there is higher aggregate leverage.
2070.06s:  I actually agree with that. COVID came in, rocked the economy to the point where the Fed is now
2075.18s:  pinned between a rock in a hard place in order to buy more time. They triggered a flurry of
2079.10s:  protective measures. Yeah. The rich made a fatal error in way over shorting stocks.
2087.10s:  There is a potential for their decades of sucking money out of taxpayers to be taken back.
2091.82s:  Let's see what they got.
2107.26s:  So they're talking about the background between O A and different derivatives.
2114.22s:  They're talking about borrowing for leverage. Okay.
2122.46s:  Yep.
2125.98s:  So derivatives, obviously, super leveraged. And this is not wrong. This is completely correct.
2130.62s:  And the leverage today is massive. That's actually one of my biggest fears to be completely
2138.38s:  honest with you with the broader market. If I'm to not go obviously super far down the doom and
2144.38s:  gloom path, but just a realistic analysis of things. If we take a look at, actually, let me start a
2152.70s:  new chat with GPT. I want to ask it, what is the current total leverage?
2165.66s:  How has it trended over time? I want to see what it gives me as a source.
2174.86s:  So it's looking at margin debt.
2187.18s:  Okay. Let's continue through here.
2192.14s:  Chris, the process, GME, what about you? We're looking at GME. What you mean, homie?
2198.78s:  We're in the DD library for GME.
2204.54s:  So they're talking about the leverage, what happened with the bundling of securities.
2217.74s:  This is talking about essentially how Wall Street had been wildly compensated, super profitable,
2225.34s:  leading into the crash that actually, fun fact, I have a couple of friends that used to work at
2230.94s:  some larger firms. And they said, even during 2008, a lot of them did really well the firms
2238.54s:  and post 2008, but they actually had to stop doing their Christmas parties.
2243.34s:  Because they used to have these really big extravagant Christmas parties, and they knew that
2247.26s:  the optics on that were terrible. That people are losing their houses during 2008, and the banks
2253.10s:  were doing really well. So they literally stopped doing their Christmas parties because of that,
2259.66s:  which is really interesting. So this is about the credit default swaps.
2269.42s:  So this is all about their perception and their understanding of the crash of, oh,
2275.50s:  eight, which is fine. I think we know most of the details on that. Okay, here we go.
2281.90s:  So now it's talking about essentially the new CDO game. I'm actually really interested
2288.06s:  what their perspective is here. So we did the House of Cards, DD, actually, we saw that.
2297.90s:  They're citing the bigger shorts Wall Street's cooked books. Okay.
2309.02s:  So they're talking about essentially bullshit supporting and
2313.26s:  not actually having the assets that they're talking about to back the leverage.
2322.54s:  Mortgage back security still.
2327.50s:  The Linquency rates skyrocketed.
2334.14s:  Okay.
2343.18s:  They're talking interesting. This is actually an interesting correlation that they've identified.
2356.22s:  Essentially saying that as SLR protection dropped off the reverse repo market started expanding,
2363.74s:  but the reverse repo market started expanding for a lot of different reasons. But this is saying
2369.34s:  it's not up at a quarter where the quarter end significant strain on the economy.
2373.26s:  The buildup over time implies that there's significant strain on the market as of Q2,
2377.74s:  which is April 1st through June 30th, which I mean, really the market was still decent there. But
2391.10s:  let's actually read that. A comment on the subreddit may be revisited of rule passed by the
2396.86s:  ICC flew under the radar. Another sign for our crash coming. They passed a new rule effective
2404.94s:  one June 21. But let's see. The principal purpose poses to modify ICC's fee schedules to introduce
2415.82s:  credit default swap credit default index. Swapion incentive programs for the second half of 21.
2426.30s:  They do not require any changes to ICC. They are providing incentive programs to purchase
2431.66s:  credit default swap indices. They're like standard credit default swaps, but packaged together like
2437.42s:  an index kind of like an index. Yeah, that's a great analogy. And it's essentially saying this is
2442.78s:  allowing them to bid against a wide range of credit CDOs or other entities buying at a cheaper rate.
2448.94s:  They can now bet against a wide range of failures in any market. And they were lying upwards of
2454.06s:  25% discounts. Well, this is also going to provide a stabilization effect, though, which is one of
2459.26s:  the reasons why there's an incentive behind it. GameStop was never going to cause the market to crash.
2465.82s:  This is interesting. Let's see what they say. GameStop was meant to die off the rich bet against it.
2470.94s:  Many folds over and it was on the brink of bankruptcy before many conditions led to where it is
2474.62s:  today completely cracked. That's exactly what happened. As far as I could tell, it was in the middle
2479.42s:  of being seller boxed down to bankruptcy. It was never going to cause the market crash.
2485.74s:  And it will and it never will cause the crash. The short squeeze is a result of
2491.02s:  high abuse of the derivatives market over the past decade where we're all streets abuse of this
2495.82s:  market as prime the economy for another market crash of their own.
2501.66s:  I agree with the abuse of the derivatives market and the overall risk there, but
2507.58s:  we've seen some really smart people, especially like CEO, what was it of IB talking about it.
2515.34s:  I think that this is underselling the potential that GameStop could have had on actually,
2520.54s:  like, genuinely starting a broad scale might not be full crash. It could have been a full crash.
2525.66s:  We don't really know. But I do think that there's a little bit more power behind it
2533.74s:  than what this might be alluding to.
2537.34s:  GameStop was a non-issue in the market. Let's see. Failure of 1% how GameStop can deal a fatal
2544.86s:  blow to wealth inequality. Jesus. So one of the things that I don't like with stuff like this
2557.66s:  is it's creating such an us versus them mentality and it's just broad,
2567.18s:  bucketing people together, which is almost always an ignorant perspective.
2573.26s:  So to something like this, say, the failure of the 1% how they can deal a fatal blow to wealth
2581.18s:  inequality. The 1% that's not a small group of people. There's a lot of people in that 1%.
2592.54s:  So to summarize essentially all of them into the same bucket is very frequently just a
2602.54s:  illogical conclusion to come to, which again is worth noting. I think if we're going to have
2610.06s:  accusations in a cost entities, we should be very specific. We shouldn't say the 1%.
2616.46s:  It's a very broad generalization and it's kind of reckless to do something like that.
2621.02s:  Actually, let's see real quick. What considers, I'm probably in that. Let me see. What is considered
2627.90s:  the top 1% in the US? I accidentally did you a one sec.
2635.42s:  What is considered the top 1% in the US?
2644.94s:  Typically defined by income and net worth, being in the top 1% of earners worldwide,
2650.46s:  household generally needs an annual income of $787,000.
2655.34s:  Yeah. 2024 report by night Frank indicates an individual requires a net worth of 5.8 million
2667.34s:  to be in the top 1%. Other analysts suggest that threshold might be higher around 11.6 million.
2673.50s:  That's a big gap. But there's a lot of people in that. And based on some of those, I'm also in
2681.18s:  that. So the thing is, there's a lot of people in this. Just broad generalizations are typically
2688.22s:  better to stay away from, in my opinion, with something like this, we should be very specific.
2692.78s:  Because we have some very specific areas to point at, not kind of a lazy generalization. But
2700.86s:  anyways, let's continue. One person, the short interest was 140%, which we've done a bunch of
2710.06s:  DD on that. We know that it was even higher than that at points. And it's insane, right? The fact that
2717.10s:  larger than the float is short, it is complete fucking bullshit. There's no world where that should
2723.10s:  be even remotely possible. And a lot of that has to also do with the phantom shares that we were
2729.10s:  talking about. So this is a great call out. Maybe it was 200% back then, 480% who knows. So essentially,
2736.14s:  and I agree with the point they're making gear to the fact that the number literally was bullshit.
2740.54s:  Once you see it over 100%, it's all fucking fake. And it's really difficult to tell how many
2745.42s:  fake shares are out there and leading to all these fake proxies. So I agree with this.
2751.58s:  You can hopefully gather that Wall Street takes on massive risks all the time. They do not care
2756.06s:  as long as it turns out short term profits. Now, again, this is also, I think, a mistake and a
2762.30s:  mischaracterization. Wall Street really obviously cares about short term profits, but they're not thinking
2768.54s:  of how do I make a buck this month? They're strategic thinking and they're thinking of industry
2775.82s:  trends that are going to unfold over the next decade to sell them short and undermine their overall
2782.06s:  intelligence to just myopic focus on short term profits is a mischaracterization of them wholly.
2789.50s:  And again, it's the same thing in the military. One of the most dangerous things you can do in the
2794.70s:  military is underestimate your enemy. A lot of times, that's how you get dead. So this, I believe,
2802.70s:  is underestimating the total prowess of Wall Street, quote unquote, which is obviously a big
2809.58s:  grouping, another broad generalization. But in this case, I understand their general point.
2815.18s:  They're not over archingly focused on short term profits. They're dynasties. They're thinking
2823.82s:  quite longer term.
2828.54s:  This way, Paul says fatal blow to wealth inequality. Yeah, completely agreed. The wealth inequality is
2835.18s:  a much bigger thing than even just the markets or even just the US economy or even just the US.
2841.58s:  Right. Well, the inequality is a pretty significant issue to tackle. And that's a much broader topic
2849.26s:  than for this stream. But like a lot of things like that, it's heavily complex. So the one thing I
2857.18s:  always try to remind people of is we talk as we even, you know, passively discuss these really
2862.70s:  big topics like that is our really simple explanations and desires for stuff like this
2872.14s:  tend to fall woefully short of just how much goes into the problem itself. It's very complex.
2881.10s:  So the conditions that led to GameStopward is today is a miracle itself. I agree. The support
2886.06s:  of retail traders has led to explosive fatal mistake of the rich. Again, another really big
2891.02s:  characterization that I don't like because a short position has infinite loss potential,
2898.22s:  which is true but not true. And the reason why I tell people it's true but not true is the reason
2906.62s:  why it's not infinite sooner or later, you literally consume all available resources. And I know
2913.02s:  it's a dramatic example, but there's a difference between that and infinite. It's not actually infinite.
2920.70s:  There's so much money in the world, especially in the derivatives market, this should scream to you
2924.94s:  that any price that you think is low could very will be extremely low in your perspective. You might
2930.70s:  just be accustomed to thinking X dollar price floors too much money. No, I can hit that.
2937.66s:  The market crashing no longer was a matter of simply scooping up defaulters.
2942.78s:  It's not a fighting in Smell of Incident L. .72. It's a battle against the entire financial world
2949.82s:  that's pretty significant. There's speculation from multiple people that the Fed is going to be
2955.34s:  complicit right now helping suppress GameStop. That's another pretty significant accusation.
2962.30s:  Don't you think they'd fight tooth and nail to suppress this and try to get everyone to sell?
2968.30s:  Now, this goes back to another current state deviation from this that I do think is also worth
2975.10s:  pointing out. And the current state deviation being with the offerings and GameStop shares being
2984.70s:  less scarce. I think it undermines a lot of these ideas now in terms of essentially the float being
2992.46s:  locked up and then shares being scarce. If shares are abundant, then it short circuits a lot of
2999.82s:  the potential ideas like this. So the other thing is I honestly don't really see.
3010.30s:  See, this is what I honestly don't like is that we spend a lot of time talking about
3018.06s:  2008, which is good. I think everybody should be familiar with that. But then
3022.22s:  the actual tying it to GameStop is essentially this page, this page, and then a meme.
3032.38s:  It's like very shallow. So let's, anyways, finish this and see if maybe there's a big connecting
3037.18s:  dot here. Regardless of the other rules that look good for Moas, I see them in a negative light.
3043.10s:  They're passing others to prevent a game, game stop situation from ever occurring again.
3048.38s:  They realize how much power retail could have from pying in a short squeeze play.
3052.54s:  These new rules snap new emerging short squeezes instantly. If the conditions of a short squeeze
3057.74s:  ever occur again, there will never be a GameStop situation after this. Well, this wasn't true. There
3063.90s:  was a situation this year. It's their game after all. They've been abusing the derivative market
3069.90s:  that. The rich again, broad generalization, are now at risk of losing that money and insane
3078.30s:  amounts of cash that they've accumulated over the year, the housing market of OA.
3086.70s:  Yeah, I mean, okay, so let's just do quick pros and cons. Pros, I really liked the historical
3093.42s:  overview of the 2008 crash. I think that there's a lot to learn from that. I also think that there's
3101.74s:  a good amount of discussion around various derivative products, the cons a lot of the main
3107.42s:  premises they break down and it just becomes a lot of speculation and then it becomes a lot of
3114.86s:  rooting in us versus them. I think as much as we can keep things quantitative, qualitative,
3123.26s:  I won't be reporting out like this, the better off we are because then it's not a game of I feel
3129.10s:  blank is unfair or I don't like this or I don't like that and it literally becomes a game of
3135.18s:  pointing at things like we can with naked shorts, for example, like we can quantitatively point
3141.58s:  at the short float being at 140% and be like, what the fuck? There's a hundred percent of the stock.
3149.58s:  You're telling me 140% of it is shorted, make that make sense. That's a great data point to point
3156.78s:  at and to pull out and extrapolate some of the broader themes that they're talking about, like the
3161.90s:  manipulation and whatnot. But yeah, okay, interesting. We'll take a look at another one.
3169.26s:  The bigger short was this one. This one is a logo meme. Is this just memes?
3177.18s:  It is memes. Okay, this is 148 pages. Let's get to work.
3193.34s:  And I'm stuck. Can anybody give me the context behind this one?
3198.06s:  Help. H-A-L-P.
3205.26s:  I love front butts. I don't think you do. I don't think anybody likes front butts.
3212.62s:  Then it's bad news. Why is GameStop traded overnight and AMC is not? Is that the case?
3228.22s:  I'm just looking them up really quick.
3249.82s:  Let me see.
3257.90s:  Okay. We know that GameStop does obviously, but I'm curious about.
3279.26s:  I mean, it looks like AMC does trade after hours. Here.
3287.90s:  So the reason why you might not see it is it could just be because it's really low volume.
3298.70s:  But it does look like it trades after hours as far as I can see.
3305.66s:  And it looks like we don't know this meme. Got it.
3309.34s:  Haggis says, what about making all short positions public? What's your opinion?
3314.30s:  I don't think it should be public specific to the firm, but I actually think the new reg show
3319.82s:  release that's going to force them to comply with reporting their short positions.
3327.02s:  And then the SEC essentially will combine them. I think that's good.
3332.94s:  I like that a lot, but I don't think every firm needs to publicly show every single position it has.
3342.06s:  That starts to create a little bit, well, perpetually, I should say, it starts to make it really
3348.30s:  difficult for the firms essentially to do their job because they're playing a lot of games against
3353.10s:  one another. And that information could become difficult to manage. That's one of the
3358.94s:  advents of Darkpools, which Darkpools are now being abused. The whole origin of a Darkpool was
3365.10s:  actually a very reasonable idea. And it's because we would essentially see
3375.02s:  we would essentially see entities front running big block trades. And then they couldn't get
3380.86s:  a actual trade through without being ran up massively. So Darkpools were built originally to fix
3387.50s:  that. But like I said, they definitely are being abused for sure.
3395.50s:  I had to figure out
3404.70s:  in our order. But we on it tonight. This was great. Mel had a whole list of stuff made it easy.
3415.18s:  All right.
3429.50s:  Let me just get this plugged in quick.
3445.02s:  And we go. There's like these two different kinds of
3452.54s:  tacos that I typically get. There's like a chicken one and then a carne asada one was good.
3461.82s:  Fazzy says confirm with the second meme. Yeah, it's actually hilarious. If it's, I thought it was
3466.54s:  going to be more specific.
3475.02s:  Okay. Unless you guys feel really compelled to like go through this, I think we can
3480.46s:  fly through this pretty quick.
3485.90s:  Because it's honestly just kind of talking about doing Lego meme.
3492.06s:  I don't know about most of the Lego memes essentially just saying that they like Lego memes.
3510.54s:  That's kind of backwards to me.
3514.22s:  That's also kind of hilarious. But
3534.78s:  this was one of my favorite memes that went around. But it's terrible as a Lego meme to be
3539.98s:  completely honest. Like this is not this looks fucking weird. But the the cap is just so good.
3558.30s:  Okay.
3566.62s:  Okay. This is what we want. Super stung.
3570.70s:  Everything is now awesome. That's funny.
3594.78s:  Okay. This looks good.
3596.78s:  Okay.
3599.66s:  That last one was good.
3603.74s:  All right. On to the next. What time we got? We got time for one more.
3609.58s:  What?
3612.22s:  Oh, the kuntosh.
3616.06s:  That is like one of the most beautiful Lamborghinis ever. I love the kuntosh.
3621.66s:  I probably should take a quick look at the Lamborghini coup.
3639.66s:  Man, look at that thing.
3643.66s:  These are just gorgeous. So so cool.
3648.38s:  I love these.
3661.98s:  Oh, they have like a bunch of car stuff in here. This is kind of fun.
3666.70s:  Good old Eldorado. Man, I'm really curious how much effort it takes to make these different
3674.06s:  magazines.
3690.70s:  Just trying to see if there's any like DD in here. It looks just kind of like a
3695.98s:  a series of retelling of hails. That's actually really cool.
3700.30s:  But I didn't really see anything in here. That was actual DD.
3705.90s:  Oh, we got how long are these ones? Oh, they're not that long. All right. Let's
3710.94s:  we should at least finish this row.
3724.54s:  Get the fuck out of here.
3731.10s:  So they're letting you know on every day we've looked at so far, you're not selling.
3744.30s:  Oh,
3746.38s:  jockeur.
3753.50s:  Still not selling.
3758.30s:  Okay, this was an easy one.
3763.10s:  All right, let's see what this is. This looks like it might be DD.
3765.98s:  Hey, DD, wait, we read this one already.
3769.10s:  Yeah, we read this one.
3774.22s:  So this one was also in the diamond handbook. I remember this one.
3783.10s:  This was the original issue. Yeah, so this was talking about FDDs. It was talking about the issues
3788.94s:  that they have with DTC. I remember this one. And then I'm assuming this one's the second part
3795.58s:  of that them. Yeah, I remember looking at this.
3809.18s:  This is them talking about the bullshit fines and then how many errors there were in reporting.
3816.94s:  Okay. So now we're on, well, I definitely think we saw this one too.
3826.14s:  Yeah, we definitely read this one.
3832.14s:  This was talking about the mispricing of shorts or the misreporting, I should say.
3842.78s:  Okay, so now we are on column two,
3848.30s:  row four, leave off,
3857.58s:  column two, row four, sweet. Anything else you guys want to hit? Game stop related, not
3865.90s:  game stop related. Anything that you want to take a look at, we could take a quick peek at the
3870.86s:  updated coverage strangle if you want. We have a couple minutes or happy to also wrap. We can
3874.86s:  do the coverage strangle update in the Tuesday video. That's really where it goes.
3878.38s:  Anyways, so far the DD library, there's a lot of humor in it. This is my favorite so far by far.
3885.82s:  The diamond handbook because there is actually a lot of actual research in DD in there.
3892.06s:  And I actually think the bigger short, although I, there's a lot of stuff about it, I didn't
3897.42s:  like fully care for. I like that it's actually again, an attempt at due diligence and research.
3903.18s:  I appreciate that quite a lot. And then the house of cards obviously, but we've already seen that one.
3908.06s:  So I'm curious how much in here actually is going to be DD versus just kind of playing games.
3914.86s:  There's a lot to go through for sure, but if a lot of it is like memes and stuff like that,
3919.66s:  we'll probably roll through it pretty fast, I think. So awesome. Well, then that's where we'll
3927.02s:  hang up for today. If you guys need anything, let me know. We have our outlier pro market prep
3933.10s:  stream tomorrow and then standard live stream on Monday. So see everybody around. If you need
3939.34s:  anything, hit me up. Be an outlier, be an ape. Feel it.
