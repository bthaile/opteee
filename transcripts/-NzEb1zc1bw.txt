0.00s: What's up outliers, quick market update?
2.56s: I want to talk about two things.
3.96s: The first thing is just some general broad market updates and flow as we're getting into
9.00s: this next interesting period next week of the Fed rate cuts expected on 18 September.
15.96s: And then I want to talk a little bit about game stop just because we came up on another
20.52s: expiration.
21.52s: So I'm going to get us prepped up for our game stop live stream tomorrow at 5 PM.
26.64s: So let's get right in.
28.52s: What's going on in the market?
30.12s: A pretty big turnaround.
31.44s: That's what I noticed this week, writ large.
34.00s: So if we take a look across the different sectors, we can see that the S&P 500 is now kind
38.72s: of hovering right near all time highs again.
42.00s: It's rallied right back up.
43.68s: It's had a fairly one sided move starting from the ninth.
48.40s: We can see tech is still rallying.
52.44s: It's lagging behind the S&P 500 still.
55.96s: It is still a bit away from all time, well, near term highs.
61.96s: I should say here as compared to spy.
64.68s: And then the Russell caught a really big bid today except it still is not even getting
70.24s: near its near term lower highs, let alone near term highs.
75.88s: So the Russell is also lagging quite a bit.
79.96s: Vix is down 16 and a half bonds are up.
84.92s: So what's going on here?
85.84s: Well, in my opinion, it looks like the market is starting to price in a little bit more.
92.32s: This whole probability of a cut and we're trying to see how things are going to settle.
96.24s: You can see for the New York Stock Exchange net highs lows, the net lows essentially evaporated.
103.32s: There's on a gross low basis.
105.08s: There's 10.
106.32s: So the New York Stock Exchange is really starting to take off pretty meaningfully here.
110.68s: If we take a look at the NASDAQ, it's still gaining momentum but nothing near like
116.96s: what you're seeing in the New York Stock Exchange.
121.20s: So from a broader perspective here, the market I find to be at still a very interesting
128.24s: point, I don't read into this move too much.
131.04s: I'm playing it.
132.04s: I'm both long right now, futures and options in all of the indices.
138.44s: I have positions in E minis, cues and Russell.
143.20s: And that's mostly just following the movement at this point.
146.40s: It's not that I'm fully sold and baked in on what this movement looks like because
151.28s: a big thing that's going to start getting factored into pricing soon is what we think
155.36s: about recession.
156.36s: It's a little too early to worry too much about it yet, but that is going to become
159.96s: increasingly topical.
161.28s: Last I saw from Goldman Sachs.
163.24s: They had an article out that talked about like a 20% chance of recession, which I argue.
168.28s: It seems a little low to me, not that I know better than them.
171.60s: I just can't help it think that after everything that's gone on to think that it would
175.96s: be that low just seems not highly probable.
179.48s: But again, that's just based on essentially intuition.
182.24s: So I wouldn't wait my opinion there too heavily.
185.00s: So that's that.
186.00s: Now as I already mentioned, we do have a big rate cut coming soon.
192.76s: And when I say rate cut, it's been priced in for some time now.
196.32s: We've been looking at essentially a hundred percent probability of a cut since this new
202.72s: expiration became the front expiration.
205.88s: So on 18 sap is what we're looking at now, you can see what bonds were pricing off of.
212.12s: And here's the interesting point.
214.84s: It used to be really high probability of 25 basis points.
218.48s: Now it's like 50 50 between 25 and 50 basis points.
222.72s: It's turned a relatively not exciting event in my opinion, and you quite in exciting event.
229.20s: The reason is because I felt the probability of a 25 basis point had been priced in for
235.00s: some time.
236.36s: And we can see that because across the futures, if we look at the bond futures, you
242.48s: can see that they've rallied, but their volume is already started dying down.
247.16s: It's not like the volume is pouring into bonds at this point.
250.04s: It's really not.
252.84s: There's this really interesting phenomenon that we're seeing because I think most of
258.76s: this probability of a 25 basis point cut probably started getting priced in pretty
262.48s: heavily back here.
264.72s: And we've been, you know, me entering sideways here, but the revival of a 50 basis point
270.20s: cut, I actually think starts to make this look a little more interesting.
274.48s: And the ability for that to have a little bit more of a market effect, I think is pronounced.
279.84s: But if we look across again 30 year bonds here for the last week, essentially, it's
286.00s: been running below both five day and 20 day average volume.
290.08s: If we take a look at something a little near term, and we use 10 years, you'll see the
295.20s: same exact thing.
296.20s: It's been below volume most of the week.
298.84s: And then if we go even closer still, look at the two year, it's about the same still.
304.56s: So bonds are being bought no doubt.
307.92s: And I think most people have already captured most of this move.
310.60s: This is again, of reflection of the market as a discounting mechanism for those that are
317.88s: thinking like, oh, I want to get in a bonds today because I think the Fed rate cuts
321.36s: going to move prices literally like not even days late over a month or two late.
327.76s: That already has happened.
328.96s: Again, you can see that back here, clear as day.
331.20s: That's exactly what this is.
332.56s: Now it continues to drift up.
333.56s: I'm not saying that this is the maximum of the move or at all that it can't continue
337.04s: at sure can.
338.36s: But what I'm saying is that if you're arriving to that conclusion now, you are late to
342.64s: the party.
343.64s: So that doesn't mean you can't play it.
345.72s: But it just means you now have a higher risk trade because if for whatever reason, the
350.52s: economy starts faltering, it starts looking a little bit ugly to the downside, then we
355.60s: don't really know exactly how bonds are going to behave there because the bond equity
360.12s: relationship had broke down pretty meaningfully throughout 2020 until almost present.
365.16s: It's just now just starting to normalize.
367.00s: So I don't even think it's fair to say like, oh, yeah, if you know, it starts looking
370.60s: like recession, bonds are going to look really good.
372.76s: Maybe.
373.76s: I mean, we might think that, but we also have to understand the rest of the conditions
377.40s: that are around us because again, correlations change over time and they did pretty massively.
382.68s: So for people that used to run risk on risk off portfolios using equities bonds, they
387.20s: were getting massacred over the last few years because the relationship broke.
392.72s: So yeah, that's kind of what I see going on with the bond market.
397.28s: Now the other thing I want to take a look at is the movement of capital between the sectors.
403.36s: I find interesting.
404.36s: So if we go to institutions and this is looking more like value institutions, I'll open
409.12s: this up a little bit so that you can see over here.
413.60s: There's a few things that jump out at me when I'm looking at this down here is when we look
419.36s: at where most of the exposure is, again, we can see technology is contracting.
423.92s: It continues to contract quarter over quarter.
426.56s: So it hits peak concentration like back in here, which is around Q3 of 21, Q2, 22 somewhere
436.16s: in that range and it's been contracting ever since.
439.36s: That's a lie.
440.36s: Did tick up here, my bad.
441.84s: I lied to you.
442.84s: Where is this?
443.48s: This is like, yeah, 23, Q2, ish.
447.80s: But then it's been contracting from there for real this time.
451.32s: So this idea that like we're heavy tech concentration, I actually think is a little misguided
457.32s: at this point.
458.32s: Now it's important to also understand this is looking at when we're looking at sector
463.44s: exposure and people, if we look at individual products, we can absolutely see that we're
469.28s: still very, very heavy into tech.
473.12s: And so if we sort this by ads, you can see Burke Shires coming up really big Google,
480.76s: AMSCI, ACN, Boba.
484.36s: So it's like a healthy mix of things.
487.08s: And if we take a look at offloads or kind of the smallest ads, it's been an energy,
494.08s: which, again, that's no big surprise because if you take a look at energy's composition
498.80s: in these portfolios, it's been super, super low for some time.
503.16s: So what I'm noticing from an expanding standpoint is if you look at industrials, they're
507.60s: starting to open up a little bit.
509.48s: You're seeing consumer defensive.
511.20s: It opened up, kind of started closing back down.
513.44s: I don't think there's a lot there that interests me at the moment, just from a flow perspective.
518.16s: And then we absolutely see financial services opening up.
521.48s: So when I say opening up, I mean, consuming more of transactions and the percentages of portfolios.
528.32s: So to recap all of that from what I see now, I think the market has already largely
534.12s: priced into 25 basis point cut.
535.84s: If not a 50 basis point cut probability at this point, I think if it is a 50 basis point
540.52s: cut, the market will probably move pretty heavy off of that because it will still be
544.24s: relatively new news.
546.52s: That's not fully priced in the exit.
547.76s: It's even still less than a 50% probability.
550.08s: But if it keeps trending that way, I think it becomes more probable.
553.80s: So interesting market behavior this week.
557.48s: And this is where, again, until the market decides if it's going to go left or go right,
562.76s: this is exactly where I like to trade these markets, but you got to be really careful.
567.76s: And I use really tight stops, even the stuff that I'm running in the NASDAQ.
571.64s: I just follow it all the way up.
573.84s: And for things that I typically would handle a previous retracement without batting an
577.48s: eyelash, I would rather just get out, watch, and then go back in.
580.68s: I haven't been knocked out yet, but I have literally orders resting right now to start
585.72s: dropping me out if need be.
587.40s: All right.
588.40s: So let's switch over to GameStop quick.
590.08s: And then for those that don't know, later today at 5 pm Pacific Time, we have the outlier
594.52s: options trading for beginners series.
597.04s: That's at 5 pm Pacific Time.
598.52s: And we dive into the world of options for beginners.
601.44s: So it's a chance to get your feet wet.
603.08s: We've been doing, I think this is going to be our 14th episode.
605.52s: So we're going to have a quiz.
607.32s: It's really just designed to help people sharpen the sword, get more familiar with options
610.76s: more comfortable with how they fit in the portfolio, understand the difference between things
614.20s: like profit mechanisms and how to capitalize on them with options.
617.88s: Because options get a bad rap, but it's because people jump into them too fast is what
621.72s: it boils down to.
623.24s: So going over to GameStop, a little bit of an update today.
625.84s: That was absolutely awesome to see inside day 1.23% up, but it's still hovering right above
631.92s: 20.
632.92s: So the fact that it's continuing to hold this is good to see.
637.24s: And if we take a look at volume, we can see that there was a spike of volume leading into
642.32s: earnings, post earnings, another spike of volume.
646.40s: And then if we take a look, even at these last two days, although these last two days
650.08s: seem insignificant compared to the prior four, these last two days are still much larger
655.32s: than a lot of what you saw in here.
657.96s: Right?
658.96s: So today we had 8 million volume 9.5 million volume yesterday.
662.16s: If we go back to a random sample during this period, it's 4.5, 3.5, so much, much, much less
668.84s: volume in here.
669.84s: So there's still elevated volume.
672.04s: And I think that that's an important note because it tells me that we're still supported
678.08s: here.
679.08s: Now whether it breaks down below this, TBD, don't know yet.
681.96s: But I like the fact that it hasn't yet.
685.40s: And I'm keeping a pretty close eye on that.
688.00s: Now let's jump over to the options chain.
691.16s: And we have a few things to go over in here.
692.84s: So today, we had 172,000 calls against 49,000 puts, so way more calls traded.
699.92s: And again, this looks like mostly moving out into the next expiration.
703.24s: Right?
704.24s: So we can see a bunch of these 13 September.
705.88s: These are almost assuredly trades that are coming down.
708.88s: And these 20 steps are going to almost all be opening trades for people moving out into the
713.84s: next primary expiration.
716.48s: Open interest, still hovering right around 730,000 calls against 361 on the put side.
724.04s: And it's still a healthy mix of call, open interest across different explorations.
730.32s: I'm not seeing any sort of massive concentration here that leads me to believe that, you
735.64s: know, the market is pricing something in or the market thinks something in particular
739.92s: is going on.
740.92s: I just don't get that sense at least as of right now.
744.96s: So let's take a quick look now at any interesting trade volume that we've had come through.
753.48s: I'm going to get rid of the puts for now.
755.28s: I'm going to get rid of the bids for now.
760.32s: And I'm going to limit it to just today to kind of clear out some of that noise.
764.76s: We had a couple trades that looked interesting to me.
768.68s: But so we have the 18th of next month, the 15 calls.
774.44s: I thought those looked a little off place, but not much.
778.64s: It is a bigger trade 200 and 87,000.
780.76s: Again, it's not big by typical game stop standards when things are really busy.
785.72s: But it's something I'm just looking at.
787.72s: And then we have another 174,000 dollar trade, but this is an out until 2025.
791.96s: So yeah, you know, future dated positioning totally fine, but beyond that, just pretty
796.28s: quiet in here.
797.28s: Not much to highlight that looks really interesting to me or anything like that.
803.16s: Now, I do want to take a look at the dark pool really fast and see what kind of transactions
807.28s: we had today.
809.16s: And if we take a look, there's a bunch of those 5,000s again.
813.16s: So I'm going to do a sort of spicy, see if the 5,000s are in here, typically they're not.
817.76s: Because there's a bunch of much bigger transactions like these.
820.64s: These are actually interesting.
822.48s: Well, for I'm going to look at just today though.
830.20s: And let's see.
831.44s: Yep, look at all these 5s again.
834.24s: This is like, this has been nonstop the last few days.
839.60s: So let's count.
843.56s: So and there's a couple over here that are like different sizes right, 5500, but these,
849.28s: what is this?
851.80s: It's like over 30, maybe like 35 or so.
856.40s: And then I see a couple of high force.
860.04s: So interesting.
866.20s: Really interesting.
867.20s: I don't know what to make of the 5s.
869.44s: Their activity has been ebbling and flowing.
871.88s: So if we look at this over the last week, for example, I'm going to filter by just those
876.48s: 5,000.
877.48s: And again, these are not options.
878.40s: These are shares.
881.96s: And now I'm going to sort it by date so that we can kind of see how it ups and flows.
886.72s: So you can see on the 12th was massive, right?
889.36s: Absolutely massive number of transactions.
892.80s: Then on the 13th, there's still, again, over 30, I would bet, but not like in insane
899.12s: amount like the 12th.
901.12s: Then if we go to the 11th, it's more than the 13th, less than a 12th.
907.72s: We go to the 10th, it's less than both of those.
910.00s: The 9th, less still, the 6th.
915.88s: And we run out of space at the bottom.
918.08s: We run out of returns.
919.68s: So I just can't help but find it interesting.
923.64s: I don't think that, again, I'm not suggesting that this is the same person trading here.
927.76s: Nobody has them in the napley on the size, but I just can't help but find it so interesting.
932.36s: So right now, my main goal here is to just continue following these shares through the
936.92s: Darkpool.
938.44s: I just want to see if there's a change in the number of 5000 returns.
943.48s: That's what I'm looking at right now.
944.72s: Obviously, that's what I see over the 12th to today.
948.36s: And that's what I'm keeping an eye by all on.
950.44s: Because the option of change right now is quiet.
951.96s: It is what it is.
952.96s: Is exciting as I would prefer it to be.
954.72s: Right now it's quiet.
955.48s: The stock price itself is quiet, which, again, is we know with game stop, it's quiet until
960.64s: it's not.
961.64s: So that's all we got for today.
963.20s: As always, let me know if there's anything I should take a look at being outlier.
966.20s: I'll see you guys later.
