0.00s: What's going on, everybody?
4.34s: So we got my best friend, David Hunter back here again.
9.22s: I say my best friend because every time I talk to you, I learn a ton.
13.08s: So first off, welcome back.
14.92s: I think this is your third time.
16.24s: So it's great to have you again.
17.52s: Yeah, thanks Eric.
18.52s: I'm glad to be back.
21.48s: And so pleasure.
22.48s: So obviously, the, you know, the last few times we spoke, we got a ton of general market
29.28s: context from you, just in terms of how you view things, why you view them that way, those
34.44s: sorts of things.
35.44s: And I figured that today would be really engaging to kind of follow along that same thought
40.62s: pattern.
41.62s: That's actually one of my favorite parts that we've kept this fairly regimented, you
45.32s: know, every three or four months because you get to see how you perceive information as
50.22s: it rolls out.
51.22s: And I think that's actually really informative for people.
53.72s: It's like we were just talking about just about everybody on the internet wants the
57.32s: magic answer.
58.32s: But unfortunately, you know, circumstances continually change.
62.04s: So what I really value in these conversations is you sharing your experience with us and
67.36s: essentially teaching people how they can think about things and come to their own conclusions,
72.16s: you know, again, leveraging your experience.
74.20s: So I'm really looking forward to chat with you.
77.04s: So I figured a great first softball starter question is how do you think the Fed is handling
86.96s: the current market?
87.96s: Yeah, that's one that might take the rest of the interview.
93.96s: It's a mixed bag for sure.
98.28s: You know, the Fed's got a tough job on their hands.
103.24s: We had inflation break out in the last year to the levels we haven't seen in 40 years.
110.48s: They kind of slow walked it initially and thought it was transitory.
115.68s: So all of a sudden in January, when I really started heating up, they had to play catch
120.52s: up and they've been playing catch up ever since.
124.20s: You know, I have probably a little bit different view than a lot of people and I've been a
128.52s: thought Fed watcher for all of my 49 year career.
132.40s: And I've seen all the various Fed make ups, you know, through that time and Fed chairman.
139.72s: I, and I've had a mixed review on Paul over his time here in the chair, you know, back
147.64s: in 2018, I was really critical of him.
151.28s: He was fairly early on in that role.
154.32s: And he made some blunders and, you know, the market sold off because of some of that.
161.32s: But more than that, he just, it was showing that he's an experience at that time.
167.32s: He'll fast forward to March of 2020 and he stepped right up to the plate.
172.20s: He did the job he had to do to save the system when we're shutting down the entire economy.
178.84s: So I gave him plot it for acting quickly and decisively.
182.40s: You know, you're not going to be perfect when you're in that kind of environment, but he
186.68s: did a good job.
188.72s: And then now, certainly these last few months, I fear he's doing what he has to do in terms
196.60s: of you can't ignore the inflation.
198.48s: You've got to tighten.
199.80s: So I agree with all that.
201.64s: But some of his rhetoric and, you know, they're kind of long runway for tightening and things.
210.12s: I think is showing that he does not really understand the magnitude of the risk that is
216.60s: out there.
218.00s: I feel they are over tightening.
220.56s: And frankly, it's funny to say that because they really are, you know, they've only
224.00s: hiked a few times.
226.32s: They're still way under what the market is in terms of market rates.
232.84s: But the market did the tightening for him and I'm not sure he understands that.
237.72s: So there's, you know, some concerns there.
241.56s: I do think they should pivot fairly soon.
246.72s: Whether a pivot means just a cause in the rate hikes after we get through July or whether
253.56s: he's going to, you know, take longer to recognize the needs to pause and the needs to pivot.
259.68s: It's hard to say.
261.52s: But frankly, I think the economy is rolling over.
264.80s: There's a lot of things I look at.
266.72s: It's not that you're going to see it immediately in the GDP number or, you know, every, every
273.68s: economic data point that comes out is going to be negative.
278.12s: But in general, we're seeing the things that lead to a pretty sharp downturn.
283.76s: And I'm not sure again, the Fed is doing enough forward looking.
287.68s: I think there's so caught in looking at the present looking backwards based on looking
293.08s: at data, which is telling you what happened last month.
296.76s: That I think they're going to end up being as they almost always are late in recognizing
303.32s: the needs shift.
305.00s: And so, you know, on that basis, I'd say he's, you know, he's back in my doghouse in terms
312.20s: of still learning on the job.
317.56s: You live up to your continued reputation as a contrarian because I think you're the first
322.88s: person.
323.88s: I truly have heard say that you're postulating that they might be over tightening at this
327.76s: point, especially, you know, there's even more conversation about the next rate hike
333.08s: a while.
334.08s: They were talking about 100 basis points.
335.76s: Then they said, nah, that's a little too much.
337.36s: Maybe, you know, 75 basis points.
340.36s: And it seems like your perspective is even that might be too much.
344.52s: But I would be really curious to understand you also mentioned, you know, that the market
350.20s: did some of the tightening, essentially on the behalf of the Fed.
354.64s: So when we think about July and we think about the next quarter, what do you think should
362.08s: happen with rates and more importantly, why do you think that?
366.40s: Yeah.
367.40s: So first of all, the reason I say the bond market has done a lot of the tightening for the
371.68s: Fed and did most of it prior to their first hike back in April is because you had a 200 basis
381.72s: point jump in rates in a very short period of time, just a few months time.
386.96s: So you went from, you know, extremely low rates to, you know, 200 basis points up on that
392.40s: low base was a huge jump, historic jump.
395.80s: Right.
396.80s: That's already showing up in terms of housing is rolling over.
401.16s: It's showing up in terms of retail sales and the inventory bill that we're seeing in
406.60s: retail.
408.60s: It's showing up in consumer confidence or consumer sentiment.
412.84s: The mission consumer sentiment is the lowest that series has ever been.
416.76s: I think those are all signs that that even though it's still historically low rates, when
424.52s: you have that magnitude of a change in a short time, it's that rate of change in the rate
430.40s: that can have a dramatic impact.
433.04s: I mean, simply put, a mortgage rate that was, you know, two and three quarters is all
439.64s: the sudden, six percent.
440.96s: Right.
441.96s: It's a huge change for home buyers and it really shut down activity.
447.76s: And maybe as important or maybe more important, it shut down, re-fi activity for a long time
454.60s: with rates so low, there was the ability for homeowners to re-fi, pull money out of their
462.64s: home and have spending power that didn't, didn't mean they were building credit card balances
469.20s: up.
470.20s: And because their home price were going up, they said, hey, this is, I'm just taking
474.20s: some of the equity out of my helps to do things.
477.40s: And now with rates where they are, there's hardly any, and probably no re-fi activity at
484.64s: all.
485.64s: That's a huge, huge drain of liquidity that had previously helped the economy.
492.92s: So those are the things I mean.
495.88s: And then the other tightening really isn't the bond market.
499.56s: It's the big run up in gasoline crisis and home heating oil prices.
503.92s: So that was another tax on consumers that really, you know, the Fed has to account for because
513.80s: it does take money out of the consumer's pocket and money that might have otherwise gone
520.52s: to going out to dinner, you know, buying, you know, new furniture would have you, people
528.08s: saying, I'm just getting by, I'm doing what I can to get by.
531.68s: And frankly, with the run up in credit card balances of late, I think they're not even
537.06s: getting by, they're finding the app to, you know, they've drained their savings, savings
542.08s: is down at sharply lower levels than it was last couple of years.
546.72s: And now they're turning to their credit cards because it's costing, you know, the cost
551.36s: of living is gone up so fast.
553.44s: So while I understand the Fed's focus on that cost of living and saying we've got to get inflation
559.56s: now, it's hitting the consumer, they also have to realize the other aspects of what that
565.08s: cost of living has done.
567.48s: It's, we're going to see, you know, their whole goal is to basically have demand destruction
575.44s: and then bring inflation down.
577.52s: That's the way the Fed can control inflation or have any impact on inflation.
582.36s: But they have to understand that you're going to see maybe a lot more demand destruction
588.76s: than you're counting on.
590.44s: And by the time you see it, if you wait for that, you've gone way past the time when
596.20s: you can turn this thing back up and have a soft landing.
599.56s: So that's the crux of the problem is I think the Fed is at risk of creating a hard landing
606.56s: here because as I say, they don't really understand the leads and lags to their policy.
613.84s: When you see them operating on the basis of a consumer price index that, you know, jumped
620.96s: up to 9% last week or a couple of weeks ago.
626.24s: And they're making a determination on rates, you know, two weeks, three weeks later, based
632.72s: on that number.
635.56s: They're operating on yesterday's news to determine policy for tomorrow's economy.
642.80s: That's not the best way to go.
644.80s: You really, as an economist, should be looking forward.
648.28s: And I'm just not convinced that they do enough of that.
653.64s: And just for a point of my own education, so I guess I always presumed that when the
662.08s: Fed released, you know, different metrics that they would have plenty of daily or even
670.04s: weekly, you know, internal updates leading into the actual release.
675.88s: Do they not have the toolkit to be able to kind of be more sensitive?
680.56s: As you rightly point out, and I think it's important to know, you know, two things.
684.76s: A lot of the indicators that they look at inherently are lagging, but the other component is
689.76s: if they're looking at lagging indicators so intermittently, it seems like they lose a
694.52s: ton of sensitivity when really, obviously, we all think they should gain more sensitivity
699.44s: to be more reactive in the current environment.
701.16s: Do they not just have that toolkit or like, what's the disconnect they're leading to
705.32s: them not getting data quickly enough?
708.72s: Yeah, well, they have hundreds of economists feeding them data.
713.16s: And those economists certainly are trained to look at leading indicators and understand,
720.00s: you know, how to forecast, et cetera.
722.88s: But I will say that what I see in this current Fed makeup, and again, it's not that unique.
729.92s: We've seen it in past Fed regimes.
734.88s: They're really focused on headline news.
737.72s: I mean, you know, once CPI gets so much attention on CNBC and Bloomberg, the Fed can't
744.44s: help but say, hey, we got to pay attention to this too.
747.88s: So it's not that they're not able to, you know, that they're not being economists or
752.68s: not getting good economic data.
755.32s: I just think their bias is towards what's in the headlines and what's, you know, kind
761.00s: of currently in, you know, at the forefront of the media and they're responding to that.
767.96s: And I just, some of that comes from maybe not being as market savvy a group.
774.20s: I've been a criticism for years that the Fed is more academic oriented.
779.48s: You know, you got academics running it so they're not as tuned into maybe market factors that
785.72s: can be leading indicators.
787.88s: You know, personally, I would like them to focus more on some of the things that are early indicators
794.44s: that maybe it's time to think, have we finished?
797.40s: You know, should we, should we start looking the other way?
799.72s: When lumber comes down from, you know, 17 and lumber future down from 1700 to 500 and below 500,
807.72s: actually, that's a sign that, you know, you've had a big impact on housing.
815.80s: You've had a big impact on construction.
818.84s: When, you know, when used car sales prices are falling pretty dramatically.
824.04s: It's a sign that maybe inventories, you know, we're finally getting a handle on,
828.92s: new car inventories are getting back in line.
831.32s: So that maybe, you know, that's not an, you know, maybe we need to realize that prices are going
839.80s: to come down as that, you know, as that supply chain situation clears up.
847.16s: When you see a big jump in inventories at Target and Walmart and other retailers to the levels
854.12s: that we've seen that are wavy on anything that's precedent, you need to set up and take notice of
860.92s: that and say, gee, because what a recession really is is an inventory correction.
866.12s: We've got some very big inventories building around the country.
870.60s: So, you know, it's just those kind of things that I think it's not that they're not seeing them.
875.88s: I just think they'll be in kind of distracted by the headline inflation numbers.
881.00s: And as I say, you know, there's leads and lags to policy.
885.40s: So you need to be looking, I mean, Greensfield was probably the one Fed German that I saw
891.08s: got this to a degree. And he was notorious early on in his career when he was a private
896.92s: economist. That's not being a very good market person and stuff, but he learned and
904.28s: during his reign as as Fed chairman, he was zicking and zagging earlier than was typical for
912.04s: for a Fed because he understood that if I wait for the, you know, the proof, it's too late. So,
920.60s: and that's kind of what gave us the first elongated cycle we had under his regime.
926.28s: And this one's very long, but that's for different reasons.
930.76s: And interestingly, you already read my mind on the next follow-up question, which is
936.52s: with seeing a lot of commodities coming down as aggressively as they are.
942.04s: Sometimes we could view that as a leading indicator of where inflation might be going.
949.72s: But with things crashing as hard as they are, I would be
955.16s: interested in your perspective on what is the propensity for a recession as you see it today
961.40s: right now. Yeah, I believe we're in recession right now.
966.76s: We're probably going to get a negative GDP print for the second quarter. So,
972.84s: by definition, the first quarter was negative. Second, that doesn't get revised. You can have two
977.40s: consecutive quarters of negative GDP. That's a recession. But even more than that, it's these
983.00s: other things we're seeing in the economy that suggest if we're not in recession, we're pretty darn
989.16s: close. And my concern is again that what's lining up is that from here, the drop gets a lot more
999.24s: aggressive. So housing is rolling over. I think it rolls over hard in coming months.
1007.72s: Autos could roll over hard. You're seeing retail having to correct that historic inventory
1017.80s: number. That's going to cause problems. The consumer has tapped out. I mean,
1021.56s: he's, you know, would gasoline at $5 now? Yes, it's come down, but it's still high.
1027.32s: He just doesn't have discretionary spending. And what I think we are seeing this summer is,
1033.80s: the pandemic has also made things harder to forecast probably or made it different.
1038.92s: What we're seeing this summer, I think, is consumers are switching. They don't have money for both.
1045.24s: So they're switching from the material buying that they did during the pandemic.
1049.72s: You know, a lot of money spent on the houses and their yards and things like that.
1058.36s: Yacht tries equipment, etc. of computers. Now they're switching to experiences.
1064.92s: You know, we're going to go on vacation. We haven't done a long vacation a long time. We're,
1069.48s: you know, we're going to take a, on air, you know, we're going to, we're going to take an airline
1076.52s: and go somewhere. We're seeing a lot more of that. We're going to do a cruise. So they're not,
1083.08s: now they're kind of backing off from the expenses on the home and other, you know, material purchases,
1091.48s: durable purchases and they're going to, you know, maybe a little more vacation type stuff
1097.88s: dining out. What have you, my concern is that's kind of probably more seasonal than anything.
1105.32s: It's because of summer and they're saying, hey, we didn't get to take a vacation last two years
1110.84s: because of the pandemic and they're doing it. But they may be kind of extending themselves to do it.
1117.00s: When someone gets done, that's gone, but it doesn't mean you flip, flop back to the, you know,
1123.64s: the material purchases. So you're still going to be, I think, in a situation where both are gone
1128.92s: and there goes the economy, you know, service and other word services and, you know, consumer spending
1135.88s: are gone. One of the interesting articles I read not too long ago, it was from one of the banks. I
1143.56s: don't remember if it was Goldman, I think it was Goldman, but they were talking about, this was
1147.96s: only a few months ago and they were talking about how consumers had unhistorically high
1156.12s: savings because of what they were seeing, you know, the stimulus from COVID, they weren't spending
1161.88s: a ton on like you were just highlighting a lot of vacations going out, things like that.
1166.28s: And it seems like the burn rate for that is much faster than they anticipated or it seems like
1173.88s: they might have been messaging that to try to get people to calm down a little bit. But when does
1178.68s: the pin drop in your mind when saying, yeah, consumers are tapped out, they've essentially
1184.44s: spent what they could, they don't have money to spend more. When, when does that occur? Like,
1190.12s: yeah, when is that occurring your mind? Yeah, I think it's about to occur or is it occurring?
1195.48s: So we're there. Frankly, you know, we had a 35% savings rate back in the pandemic because of
1203.24s: all the handouts, you know, you have a trillion of money going out to people in terms of the stimulus
1209.00s: checks. And we had, I mean, we're not impressive. We never saw money like we've seen come out of the
1215.80s: government. It got banked, it got put in savings. That has gone from a 35% rate down to 4.4% rate,
1225.08s: which is actually below the pre pandemic levels. That's to have that happen in a matter of months,
1232.92s: you know, I think a year is just unbelievable. And it's a sign of two things. One,
1242.60s: that the consumer is having trouble keeping up with cost-living. But secondly,
1248.84s: and this is the thing that's hard to get a handle on, is there are a lot of people who took that
1254.76s: money and said, hey, this is great. I don't have to work. You know, I'm staying home. And they,
1261.32s: they're at that level now where they used up that savings in many cases. And yeah,
1268.20s: there's still jobs out there right now. But that may not be the case six months from now. And,
1274.36s: you know, you are seeing, particularly in the technology sector, a lot to big layoffs in companies
1280.04s: that never had layoffs. You know, the Tesla is a little world, the Apple's a little world, the
1285.08s: Google's a little world, you know, the Facebook's a world. They're starting to have to look at costs
1292.44s: and cut costs. And I think that's going to be for them. For the younger generation,
1300.44s: you know, a place where it was always a source of jobs may not be anymore. And they, you know,
1307.96s: kind of anecdotally, you know, you, you, anywhere you go, restaurants are saying we can't get help.
1316.20s: You know, dry cleaners are saying we can't get help. You know, the targets of the world,
1322.68s: you know, their, their stores are messier because they don't have the same ability to get,
1329.00s: you know, part-time employees to do the work. Or what have you? So I think we have somehow the
1335.32s: pandemic has changed, particularly that entry level person, you know, or that crowd of people,
1344.52s: who particularly let's say part-time high school help, you know, some are help during your
1352.12s: college years, et cetera. We're just not seeing the same flow of people into those jobs. And I,
1359.64s: I don't hear anybody talking about that, but I think that is part of the story too.
1365.80s: Yeah, that's, it's an interesting perspective because as you were just sharing some of the places
1370.20s: that are short of help, even here, you know, you're on the East Coast, I'm on the West Coast,
1374.12s: and it's the same exact thing here in San Diego where we're seeing the same exact instances where
1378.44s: places are having a hard time finding people. And also to your point, you know, on revising
1383.56s: guidance, I don't know if you saw that Apple, you know, they just essentially advised revised
1388.36s: guidance a couple days ago. They're coming up on earnings soon. I think this week or next week.
1393.24s: And they were saying, you know, hey, we're kind of slowing spending, we're slowing,
1398.44s: developmental spending over the next year. We're kind of buckling up here. And I think that
1403.24s: shook a lot of people up because of exactly what you're talking about, you know, everybody looks at
1408.12s: Apple. I mean, Apple literally is a cash cow. I'm pretty sure they have like a swimming pool of
1413.96s: gold coins that Scrooge McDuck could swim in. But even they're talking about, they want to slow it
1420.20s: down. So I think everybody's looking at that as kind of a precursor that, you know, even the big
1425.64s: names with a ton and ton of support and resources are starting to slow it down. So I think that, yeah, go.
1433.40s: Yeah, I was going to say because I episode, you know, we're talking so much about the near term.
1438.44s: But as you know, I have a forecast for the next year of a global bust. So getting from here to there
1446.76s: may not be a, you know, complete straight line. We may have a bounce in one of these quarters.
1453.40s: But I think what is being overlooked is because I keep hearing
1460.36s: among a lot of pundits and elsewhere, a lot of people talking soft landing and saying, well,
1467.32s: the market's pretty much discounting that shallow recession. We're not looking for anything, you know,
1474.68s: deep. And I feel like everything is lining up for a very deep recession. In fact, what I call the
1480.52s: biggest downturn in the past 80 years. And, but it doesn't get there immediately, you know, it kind
1488.76s: of gradually gets there. It's, it's like things happen slowly and then all of a sudden they happen
1495.00s: fast. And, and I think at least from what my work shows right now, we're probably not going to see
1503.88s: that bust much before the end of the year and then it'll dominate 2023. But it's all one thing.
1512.04s: People on Twitter will ask me, you know, what happens between your recession and your bust. That
1517.80s: goes all one thing. It's all part of the same, you know, Fed tightening cycle. It's all part of
1523.56s: the same thing. It just, you know, doesn't necessarily all happen in a very linear way, not the one.
1531.00s: And number two, even if it is fairly linear, it takes time to get to that second stage where
1537.80s: it's, it's, of what's global and number two, it's very deep.
1542.52s: And there's kind of two different avenues I want to discuss off of that. I'll pivot more to
1547.72s: just your overall assessment first because again, everybody would string me up if I didn't
1554.60s: dive a little further into what you're expecting. And it's for good reason. You have a very
1559.72s: informed opinion. So I know the last time we spoke, we were talking about a meltup leading into
1567.40s: a global bust. And I know on Twitter, people are always at your throat, you know, asking, is this
1573.72s: to melt up? Is this the melt up? Is that the melt up? And one of the things I am wanting to
1581.40s: understand from your perspective is a lot of times we do see that, right? Where there is a pretty
1589.72s: profound movement in the broad scale markets before there's a even broader decline that's fairly
1595.56s: common throughout the history. But how much does the Fed interjection factor into your decision
1603.56s: if it does at all? I'm curious if what they're doing and what kind of impact that has on your
1611.08s: assessment of things. Yeah, first, I am still calling for that melt up. And I think, I think the
1617.16s: lows are in for this. There's no guarantees. I mean, it's true. It's quite possible that you could
1627.16s: undercut the 3650 on the S&P and go down to 3500. I can't roll that out. That could happen.
1633.96s: But I think the more likely scenario is that we saw the lows in June down at 3650, we've
1639.80s: been basically spending the last month kind of slowly working our way up from 3650, you know,
1644.76s: got up to 39, almost 4,000 today and backed off. I don't know where it is now, but
1653.56s: and so, you know, I think we can, you know, there's a pretty good chance that we saw the lows.
1661.48s: You know, if I were picking up a scenario and again, it could go any number of different ways,
1666.92s: but right now there's a setup where we could go to 41, 4,200 and then back off back to, you know,
1673.56s: the 38 or 900, but still stay above the lows so that you can say the bottoms in or the worst of the
1683.96s: correction is behind us, but that doesn't mean you're off to the races in the next two weeks.
1689.96s: Right. You know, you got the Fed meeting next week, etc. So that's what's confusing. When people say,
1696.52s: is the meltup beginning? Well, people might, if I said yes, people might take that to mean,
1701.96s: okay, we're straight up from here. No, it's probably still in a period where it's going to be back
1707.72s: and forth trying to sort this out, but I think the lows may may well be in. And I do believe over the
1715.16s: course of the next several months, we're going to head towards 6,000, the S&P 20,000 on the NASDAQ,
1722.60s: you know, 45,000 down. Those are huge historic moves. If they happen as fast as they could,
1730.20s: by the end of the year or, you know, it could spill over into next year, that's a very steep move
1736.04s: that's almost unprecedented. It's certainly only present. There's a couple times in history.
1743.24s: But I think that's what we're probably going to have. People go based on what I just talked
1748.04s: with you about Eric in terms of the economy. For a lot of people, that seems like it doesn't jive.
1754.44s: You know, how can you be talking about what I'm talking about such awful economy in the next year?
1762.12s: And what I think could happen is the Fed can pivot or the Fed can see some of what I'm talking
1767.24s: about coming in terms of the economy and say, hey, maybe we did go too far and they can either
1773.64s: just pause or they could even pivot. And the market is so bearish right now and so positioned for
1781.00s: the downside that they may have to, first of all, cover shorts and secondly come running back in
1789.00s: because they're out of sync with what's going on. I think we can have a very concentrated move.
1795.72s: And people say, well, if people see the bad news in the economy, how can they justify buying?
1802.60s: What will happen is they'll view this as the tightening cycle is over. The Fed's beginning to have
1809.32s: our back is the winds that are back again instead of in our face. We can look over the trough and
1816.28s: start seeing better times six months or nine months from now, markets discount six and nine months
1823.16s: in advance. Does that mean six or nine months from now things are going to be good? I don't think so.
1829.88s: I think they're going to be bad. But that's my expectation. That's my forecast. The street could
1836.36s: easily say, okay, the Fed did its job. We're having a soft landing and we can look over the soft landing
1842.12s: to better times. And that better times if they've, if inflation starts coming down as I think it will,
1849.48s: if the oil prices keep coming down as I think they may, as some of these things show up in inflation
1856.04s: numbers, people can start saying, hey, the Fed did its job. Now we have room for the next
1863.40s: part of the cycle, or it extends a cycle for a couple of few years. Again, I'm not forecasting that,
1870.44s: but that's what street expectation could become that could justify a big run in the market. And
1876.20s: what I think is pretty clear is that everybody right now, I should say everybody is certainly a
1882.84s: large majority of people expect lower lows, expect a longer tightening cycle. If that changes,
1892.12s: if people's expectations change, you will be very, I think people will be very surprised at how fast
1902.60s: we go from this negative environment we've had all through this year into a very positive environment.
1910.68s: Marked market-wise. Right. Yeah, it's a fascinating perspective and I could see the catalyst in that
1918.04s: scenario, especially because you're right. I do think the broad sentiment is everybody's buckling up
1925.00s: for a bumpy ride. So if it seemed like the Fed was starting to change or even soft in their tone,
1930.20s: I think the market, and they have a couple times the markets react already in some small ways
1935.08s: regarding potential rate raises. So that leads me to the next question then, which is if that
1942.28s: doesn't happen. So let's say we get to the next FOMC meeting and the Fed says, nope, inflation is
1949.48s: still too high. Do you still think that there's a scenario for the melt-up to occur before the
1956.44s: bust? And if so, what does that scenario look like? Yeah, I will tell you, and I've said this many
1962.36s: times on Twitter, I always say that the bond market leads and the Fed follows. So I'm not in the
1969.08s: business of trying to predict what Jay Powell is going to do or what FOMC is going to do on any,
1974.36s: you know, at any given time, I could give you a general idea of what I think they might do over time.
1980.04s: But how do I know what they're going to do? You know, I don't frankly, my guess is we'll see 75
1985.96s: base points, which is pretty much consensus right now and next week's meeting. But I can't say,
1992.68s: it couldn't be a hundred. You know, they're humans. They can make their mind up next week.
1998.60s: So I don't play the game of trying to predict exactly what they're going to do in a particularly
2003.72s: meeting. And I also don't play the game of saying, okay, I know July's last one and they're not
2009.80s: going to hike in September. I have no idea. But what I can do with some predictability is look at the
2016.84s: bond market. And I think the bond market is signaling lower rates. So I, you know, whether the Fed
2025.56s: is in sync with what the bonds are going to be doing over the next three months, I can't tell you.
2030.44s: But I'm pretty sure, you know, at least my confidence is that that in the over the next three months,
2037.16s: interest rates are coming down, treasury bond wise, you know, I think 10 years heading for two
2043.32s: and a half and maybe two percent by the end of the year, I think the 30 years heading, you know,
2049.16s: down from three percent down. Now right now, we're going to a little backup in rates last two days.
2055.08s: You know, we could go to 320 on the 10 year before we go down. That's, you know, it's currently,
2061.00s: you know, three percent are thereabouts. Because the Fed is behind the curve, they can hike.
2068.92s: And my, my, my forecast is not dependent on whether they stop after July or whether there's
2074.60s: another hike in September. It really doesn't matter as long as bonds are doing what I expect.
2081.32s: And I'm pretty confident that we're going to see lower rates, lower inflation.
2086.36s: And the Fed will, you know, maybe pause after July or maybe pause after September.
2092.20s: I think it's one or the other. And I don't think my scenario, you know, melt-up scenario depends
2099.72s: on which it is. So like I said, I just, I can give you my best guess that they pause after July,
2107.48s: but I'm not too, I'm not too confident that I can predict what Paul's going to do in the next two
2114.68s: months, three months. Yeah. So, so basically my forecast is a melt-up first and haven't changed.
2123.48s: Melt-up first to the same targets I've had all year. And then a global bust and 80 percent
2131.48s: bear market. So I think there were nowhere near the end of trouble. I just think there's a
2137.88s: respite here that's going to be some, surprisingly strong in terms of how it's reflected in the market.
2145.24s: Yeah, that's really helpful context to understand the catalyst specifically for the melt-up,
2150.20s: mostly coming from bonds. And whether or not the Fed has, you know, a contributing factor or not,
2158.60s: that's less so the focus for you, which is, it's interesting to watch that. So I'm actually really
2164.60s: curious to see how that will work out. And then we have, you know, a little less than five minutes left.
2169.40s: So I would love to understand what precedes the bust. How do you see the economy looking when
2178.76s: we start hitting your targets from the melt-up and what is the economic functions that start
2186.44s: leading to the actual bust? I'm assuming it has to come from a global scale. So there's probably
2191.64s: external factors as well. But yeah, love your thoughts. Yeah, so it's, there's a lot of different
2199.32s: aspects of this because it is a global bust. I think some of the trouble is going to be, the triggers
2206.92s: are going to come from overseas. Whereas, you know, in 2008-09, it was our subprime problem,
2212.36s: was the primary trigger. This time around, I think, Europe's in more trouble than we are.
2218.12s: Obviously, you know, everything going on in Ukraine and going on with natural gas. Those are all
2224.12s: things that are putting, you know, if we're in trouble, Europe's really in trouble, right? I mean,
2229.64s: they don't know whether they're going to have energy to, to heat homes next winter to the degree
2236.44s: they need. So, and inflation is really breaking out there as it is here. And they still are in,
2245.00s: on the short end, still in negative rate territory. And so they have to hike, you know, tomorrow the
2251.88s: ECB decides what they're going to do. There's, you know, talk of a 50-based point hike. We don't know
2259.24s: what they're going to do. You know, it's going to be a hike, I think, pretty definitely whether it's
2263.32s: quarter or 50, I don't know. But those are the kind of things that I think could be part of where
2272.20s: the bus comes from as well is they have to, they may be hiking into a very weak environment,
2278.52s: even more so than we are. And they may not have as much staying power as we did during this period
2286.68s: of higher rates, you know, that we had some resilience built in that they don't have. So, you know,
2293.00s: all of that you've got a more leverage financial system over in Europe this time around. You've got,
2301.00s: you know, weaker, you know, I think, hollow or economies for a number of reasons. The ECB,
2308.44s: you know, you've got different countries in different places so their policy can really hit some
2313.80s: of the country's hard and harder than others. And your strong points, you know, particularly Germany
2321.16s: is facing some pretty dire situation. So, there's lots of reasons to point to Europe as a problem.
2327.72s: I think Australia and Canada, if, if, you know, commodities start coming down here, that's going
2334.20s: to impact them. Canada's housing is where we were in 2008-09. They're much more leveraged than
2341.88s: than we are today. Australia's real estate is straight up for, you know, a long time. So,
2351.72s: they're very vulnerable. And, you know, we have Asia that's having to deal with a very strong dollar.
2359.00s: That's, you know, that's an unknown in terms of when are we going to have some accidents come about
2364.60s: because, you know, a lot of these, these particularly emerging countries, fund the debt in dollar
2371.96s: terms, you know, or a dollar, then I'll be at debt. And now you've got a dollar through the roof,
2377.48s: and they have to, they have to use those dollars to pay to service their debt. Some market will
2383.88s: make it. So, there's, those things are all working. They're all there. They can come at any time.
2388.84s: I'm betting that we're going to see the Fed recognize some of those problems and put some
2393.96s: pressure on the, you know, in 20 minutes, I expect maybe July's the last hike for a little while.
2401.16s: And, you know, it will impact the dollar on the in terms of pushing it back down something. So,
2406.76s: there's, there's lots of, you know, moving parts here, but I think generally what that's all
2411.88s: pointing to is, you know, maybe we've done all we can do on the downside here in the short run,
2419.72s: and that way, maybe we have a respite of three to six months where, you know, markets can,
2425.72s: can see the glasses have full. Man, it is no shortage of drama out there. It's, it really is
2434.20s: interesting just understanding the broader scale because a lot of times I feel like from the US
2439.00s: side, we think about the US, but we do forget, especially as retail traders in my opinion,
2445.16s: you know, from my community that there is a lot of interconnectedness and a lot of that has
2450.20s: profound impacts of scale. So, I appreciate you walking us through just a little bit of the broader
2457.64s: landscape. We are up at time here. So, I want to make sure we get you out the door on time.
2465.16s: For anybody that wants to find you, I know that you're on Twitter at Dave H. Contrarian. I'll throw
2471.80s: that link in the video description below for anybody who wants to find you there. And then there
2476.84s: are plenty of people that impersonate you. So, I will be very explicit about the right accounts
2483.40s: of follow-ups so that folks can find you. But thanks, Ahton, you know, for hanging out for a
2487.88s: little bit, sharing your thoughts, sharing the information you've amassed over a really long
2492.92s: career in the markets. It's extremely beneficial to us. So, thank you. Yeah, thanks, Eric. Enjoy
2500.12s: the last thing I'll say is we didn't talk about it in specific terms, but really,
2505.96s: psychology is a big part of markets. And that's what people have to understand is don't just focus
2512.28s: on what's the economy doing, what's the Fed doing, also understand what's already discounted. And
2520.12s: where is psychology at? Right now, psychology is very bearish. And that usually indicates that you're
2526.76s: pretty close to a turn in the other direction. We will soon find out. Thank you so much for your
2533.16s: time, David. Really appreciate it. Okay, thanks, Eric. Take care.
