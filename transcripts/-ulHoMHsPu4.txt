0.00s: If you have a small options account or trading account, please watch this.
4.00s: I'm doing you a super big favor.
6.00s: You have to throw out what you think you're trying to do and you have to realize that early on your superpower with a small account is saving money.
17.00s: It's not trading your super small account into a ton of money and let me show you why.
22.00s: If we have a $5,000 account and a $500,000 account for comparison,
28.00s: I'm giving you four different scenarios where we're saving 100, 200, 500, 1000 doesn't matter what time frame it could be monthly weekly.
35.00s: This is just one instance though.
37.00s: With a $500 account, if you save $100, you just grew your account by 2%.
44.00s: Then $200 get you to 4%, 500 bucks gives you 10% growth, $1,000 gives you 20% growth.
51.00s: If you do that on a $500,000 account, it's 0.02%.
56.00s: You're 0.04%.
58.00s: You're 0.10.02. What am I showing you?
60.00s: This doesn't last forever.
62.00s: Thankfully, what this means is in the beginning, you're saving's rate provides such insane growth of your account.
70.00s: It's not funny and it's a guaranteed return.
72.00s: This is a guaranteed 20% return.
74.00s: This slows down as your account gets bigger and bigger.
79.00s: The same contributions matter less and less.
82.00s: You go from a 20% add to 0.2%.
86.00s: Now, there's a big difference between returns as well.
92.00s: The funny thing is is what would consider it to be a really good return 20% 30% somewhere in here,
98.00s: especially if it's consistent over time.
100.00s: On a small account, it doesn't matter.
103.00s: It doesn't move the needle.
104.00s: If you get a 20% return on a $5,000 account, you're getting a $1,000 box.
108.00s: It's not bad, but it's over the course of a year.
112.00s: Nobody's really going to look at this, especially when you can save this over maybe a couple months
116.00s: if you're doing a good job with your savings rate.
118.00s: However, there's 20% on a $500,000 account.
122.00s: Now, it gives you 100 grant.
124.00s: The funny thing is, is most new traders are so focused on trying to jack up this return,
129.00s: that they blow their accounts.
131.00s: They're not spending the time focusing on building the skill set to achieve a consistent return
137.00s: while aggressively saving, which is way more prone to lead you to where you want to be if you give it some time.
143.00s: Be an outlier, see you guys later.
