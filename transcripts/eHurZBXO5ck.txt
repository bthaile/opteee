0.00s: This is the side of trading that all those fake ass influencers, fake influencers don't want you to see.
6.24s: I want to walk you through some very specific habits that I adopted in my early trading career back in 2007 that led to a massive change in my outcome.
16.40s: For those that don't know, I grew up in an area with two and a half times the national rate of violent crime.
21.92s: Fun fact, I actually got stabbed in my hand while in high school between classes.
26.72s: The reason why I bring that up is not for a sob story. I'm proud of my background. It shaped who I am today.
31.76s: However, it wasn't really that advantageous for making a bunch of money.
35.20s: So when I was looking at starting trading, it was very focused on changing my circumstance.
42.72s: It was more than just making money so I can buy a nice t-shirt or some shit.
47.68s: I was really focused on changing what my lot in life was going to look like.
52.72s: So I want to walk you through those habits right now. What's up everybody?
55.44s: Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and shout out to the Patreon family.
58.48s: If what I do helps you out, consider signing up in the notes below.
61.44s: All right, let's take a look at some foundational information.
64.32s: On the left hand side, these are just some recent news articles about my Alma Mater high school
69.28s: NFA. And I walk through metal detectors every single day.
72.88s: And there's a ton of violence there. It was what it was.
75.52s: However, I went from that to this where I was interviewed and business insider to talk about how I went about making a bunch of money in my 20s so that by my late 20s
85.12s: I was already a millionaire and then in my early 30s, 32 now, I'm just snowballing it.
89.68s: How did all of this happen? I want to walk you through the exact habits that I've deployed.
95.44s: The first one. Understanding the challenge. What does this mean?
98.40s: I talk about it all the time, but I reiterate it because it's probably one of the most important points on here.
103.28s: Trading is hard and not easy money. The reason why this is so important because when most of us start this,
108.64s: we start with the exact opposite mindset that it's a way to make fast money.
113.12s: It probably is more apropos to say this is a really fast way to lose your money as compared to make it.
119.60s: And I have a couple things I want to show you on that point specifically.
122.80s: On my website, I have a bunch of studies that I listed out because I think these are good references.
127.12s: That's why I'm starting to build out some of the references on my website, things that I commonly cite so that you can find them.
133.52s: And people throw out statistics all the time that they don't look up because they're lazy, but I actually do.
138.96s: And when we look at this first side over here, seven percent of traders remain in the markets after five years.
146.00s: So that means 93% quit within five years.
148.88s: Why am I saying all of this to you if I'm on a trading channel trying to help people trade?
153.68s: Well, in order to figure out how to do this successfully, it's important we understand the landscape.
158.64s: Now, a couple notes. You have to be really thoughtful about your reference benchmark because a lot of these 93% that quit, they're lazy.
167.28s: They don't care. They're not putting an effort.
169.20s: So that doesn't necessarily detract me.
172.24s: What I mean by that is I still see a chance because I know the majority of these people are average-ass people doing average-ass things and like this quitting.
183.36s: So I understand even though the most quit, there's a smaller subset in there that are probably trying and still failing.
191.36s: So it tells me that this is something that's possible, but probably pretty difficult.
196.16s: So what does this mean? It means that we have to shift our focus from how much money we're going to make.
202.40s: Getting enough money so that we could buy a nice car and we need to shift our focus from the outcome that we want
209.76s: and really emphasize the process we are going to leverage to get there because I cannot tell you how frequently I see traders say things like,
217.76s: oh, do you think it's possible to make 20% per year?
220.88s: I don't know for you. I know for me it's possible, but I also know the amount of effort I've put into doing this.
228.56s: Have you done that?
229.68s: So it's impossible for me to rationally say what is possible for you.
234.00s: You might be able to blow my returns out of the water which would be awesome.
238.00s: The fact of the matter is you have to figure out how to get yourself through this process.
243.44s: And the sooner you accept the fact that the only thing you can control in the markets is yourself
250.16s: and taking complete ownership of all of your interactions with the markets,
255.20s: this is the direct step you can take to start affecting your outcomes in a positive way.
260.72s: I have a thing on my website again that walks through some of the things I think new traders should be focusing on
266.56s: as it pertains to this concept of a process.
269.92s: Rufles accountability has got to be there.
272.56s: There can be no excuses. You are the boss.
279.68s: There's nobody that's looking over your shoulder.
282.16s: Maybe if somebody a partner that wants to know how you're doing in your wife cares if you lose
286.16s: it all the money, that's actually good. That's a forcing function.
288.72s: Again, the average person requires external forcing functions to do the right things that doesn't
298.32s: work in trading. If you need somebody to tell you what to do, when to do it, how to do it,
304.48s: to do it well, to go into detail, to do the hard things, this is not going to be for you.
310.40s: Because you are the only person that holds yourself accountable.
314.80s: So unless you have astronomically high standards, which you should, you're probably going to accept
322.00s: a lesser output, which doesn't both well in trading.
324.56s: How do we do this? Simple. Tracking.
327.20s: This is the ultimate way we can objectively review our performance.
332.88s: I can't tell you how many times traders that I talk to you, they say,
336.00s: oh, I think I'm doing well, or I don't think I lost that much, but they don't know.
340.72s: They don't even look. And it's because their ego doesn't want to be confronted with the reality
348.48s: that they might suck at this and that the thing that they've been doing for five years might not
352.80s: be working as well as they think it might, and they don't want to address it.
356.48s: The sooner you throw that out and you abolish your ego and you instead value truth,
363.36s: the sooner you can hold yourself to the correct standard and start doing the things to get you
369.36s: closer to you objective as compared to hiding like a fucking ostrich, which are head in the sand,
374.56s: which gets you exactly nowhere. Okay, I think we got that point done.
379.52s: The easy route doesn't exist. That is just a fact of trading.
384.24s: So on Reddit, which I love checking out because it's a great way to see how people think about
388.56s: this stuff. Somebody says this was in a post that I was responding to, but the person said,
392.88s: I don't understand how people are continually trading and yet don't expect to earn a basic
397.52s: amount like 5% a month, basic amount. This might be possible for somebody. The only person that can
405.68s: figure that out is you. What are you capable of producing? I can tell you up until this point,
412.32s: I've never even exceeded this. This will be my first year trading that I beat 60%. This is the
418.40s: first one I've been doing this for 16 coming on 17 years now. Again, that's what I'm capable of.
423.92s: Somebody else might be capable of more, but what I can tell you objectively is that the sooner you
429.04s: accept the fact that for me to achieve my returns, I've spent somewhere in the ballpark of 34,000
435.12s: hours on this stuff. Easy is not in the conversation here. There is so much information out there
442.16s: that unless you take some sort of approach to funneling down what you're focusing on, there is
448.24s: a extreme chance that you are going to be bouncing all over the place, not really absorbing much.
454.24s: So we'll get to this a little bit later, but I cannot overemphasize enough how important it is
460.08s: to create a learning plan so that you are moving in the right direction efficiently and not looking
465.76s: at whether or not you should use 1226 or 1227 on your MACD indicator. Discipline is what underpins
474.40s: all of this. If you are not a disciplined human being, this is not for you. Again, you have to hold
480.16s: yourself accountable. You have to be the person that forces yourself to do the hard things to
486.00s: violate what your ego would prefer and to spend a lot of time doing this. Most people do not have
492.80s: that level of discipline. And trading is kind of an anomaly because discipline in and of itself
498.80s: will not make you successful. You still have to find an edge, but discipline is what will likely be
506.16s: the tool that forces you to fill out your trading log. That forces you to review the results so that
511.84s: you can see even though you think you might be doing well, that you're actually not and that you
516.16s: have to make some adjustments. Discipline is what puts this whole thing into process. So there are
522.88s: a ton of studies out there, but take a look at this one. This is from Confidence and Investors
527.20s: Reliance on Discipline Trading Strategies. This I thought was interesting. This says, thus, investors
532.88s: may lack the discipline to rely on profitable trading strategies, particularly when recent trading
539.28s: successes increase their confidence in their own judgment. What this is saying, this is an entire
543.84s: study about investors, even when they have a profitable trading strategy, they still don't follow it.
551.12s: That ideally goes to show you how important it is to be discipline and accountable in this space.
558.00s: Your typical way of viewing the world and thinking about things does not work in trading. For
563.60s: example, let's take a look at the stock on the left hand side. In general, you are taught to bargain by.
569.28s: If I'm going to buy socks, I would rather buy them cheaper than more expensive. I might wait
574.96s: until there's a sale that does not apply well in trading. Because if you like buying things that
581.68s: are discount, there's a reason why things are going down. So if you're a really long-term investor
587.36s: five plus years, this might be part of your model that actually works really well. But if you are
591.92s: a trader entering an exit in sub-year periods, this is a way to throw most of your money away.
599.68s: Rather, we should be looking at buying things here as things are going up, as things are more
606.80s: expensive than reason, because this is where things are moving in the correct direction for our
613.60s: assumption being bullish. So that's just one example about how your standard thought process does
620.48s: not apply well to trading. Bargain buying doesn't work well. Next up, last one, let's take a look at
627.20s: details and why they matter. So like before I was telling you about this idea of creating a plan
633.68s: to focus your learning, there's a concept I refer to called 10X activities versus 1X. And here's
639.60s: the idea. When you are in the beginning of trading, I would focus far more of my time on things that
646.80s: take one unit of effort and give me 10 units of output as compared to the inverse. And the example
652.64s: I gave you earlier is whether using 26 or 27 days on your MACD indicator will make a break you.
658.24s: Do you think that that one day difference in your MACD indicator is a 10X activity or 1X activity?
664.08s: Probably a 1X. My point there is I'm not saying that that one day difference doesn't have any
668.32s: impact at all, but that's probably not going to lead you to a gross output. Why do I care so much
674.72s: about the details? It's for this right here. If we take a look at this account, this is looking at a
680.00s: 15% return over 20 years. And I think we're starting with $150,000 right there. If you earn that return,
688.16s: you're going to make about $2.5 million. If you make just 1% above that in your return, you are now
694.96s: at $2.9 million. Half a million dollars more on 1%. This is exactly why the details matter. This is
703.12s: why you have to emphasize the entire process and then your capacity to track your progress in that
710.40s: process. None of this is easy. However, these undoubtedly are nine of the habits that took me from
716.88s: my starting point of getting shanked in my hand in high school to being a multi-millionaire in my
722.80s: early 30s. Like, subscribe, be an outlier. See y'all later.
