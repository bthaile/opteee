0.52s: what up allers quick market update
2.40s: somebody asked if I could take a look at
4.76s: Palante here and you know the answer
6.60s: it's typically yes if I can take a look
9.16s: at something that folks are interested
10.40s: in I'm always happy to so there was
13.08s: actually an interesting article that
14.68s: lined up really well with why I wanted
16.76s: to do this video and I'll grab the
18.72s: article right now it's from Seeking
20.84s: Alpha I do not know this dude at all
24.32s: this is um just reviewing his work and
27.28s: then we're going to take a look at the
28.44s: stock but I just want caveat that this
32.60s: really lined up pretty well I have to
35.20s: say and there was a couple of them that
37.64s: seemed to be talking about the same
39.96s: thing right so if I look at this person
42.92s: unlikely to end well this one says uh
46.28s: from rights research again I'm
47.72s: unfamiliar with pretty much all of these
49.68s: this says needs an Nvidia moment to
52.36s: justify its valuation this person from
55.04s: the poll says I was wrong but I'm not a
57.88s: buyer so really interesting actually as
61.32s: I'm flipping through this I I didn't
63.56s: expect to see quite that level of
64.92s: negative sentiment overall from the jump
67.52s: especially for a stock that has made
72.20s: this level of a move we've gone from 21
77.52s: to
79.60s: 66 as of today in the last 6 months so
84.44s: this is always an interesting
86.56s: conversation and it's always an
88.68s: interesting um like differing of
90.96s: opinions between two different trains of
93.00s: thoughts and I can tell I haven't read
95.76s: through these yet we're going to but I
98.40s: can tell from a very high level there's
101.40s: probably a significant value component
105.08s: to the way that these people are looking
107.12s: at markets and I find it again really
110.88s: interesting when people challenge the
113.52s: valuation of things because we can see
117.08s: stuff like PE ratios have gotten blown
121.12s: so far out and PE ratios while important
127.16s: metrics they're very relative and this
130.36s: isn't Eric's opinion this is based on a
133.20s: breadth of research that's available
135.24s: literally to everybody to give you an
137.64s: idea of some of these um you can check
140.32s: out this one by East that talks about
142.64s: different kinds of earnings earnings
144.40s: growth ratios this one really talks
146.96s: about some of the simplistic nature of
149.32s: earnings
150.40s: by price and price earnings growth and
152.52s: that you actually need to expand a
154.64s: little bit more and include something
156.72s: like what this paper I is identified
159.16s: this is from um Brooks and Anderson and
162.80s: this is about using a long-term PE ratio
166.44s: as compared to a short-term PE ratio
168.20s: which is very skew prone so using
170.52s: something that's actually using um the
172.76s: past eight years as compared to the last
175.76s: year or two and then this paper from
179.92s: Zimmerman which talks about the
182.00s: interpretation of PE ratios again as it
185.64s: compares to growth so you can check
187.64s: these out at your own Leisure the main
189.32s: reason why I highlight though is that
191.68s: when we use just PE ratios we can find
195.92s: things that look crazy right like this
197.48s: is saying now it's trading at
206.74s: [Music]
210.24s: very high PE ratios for long durations
212.72s: of time now I want to be clear this is
215.44s: not me defending paler in any way this
218.16s: is me talking about PE ratios as a
221.84s: concept so that people can keep that in
224.16s: the back of their minds because when
226.44s: again we apply a standard value mindset
229.88s: as a Trader we see wow like this is a
232.80s: this is just a crazy Surplus if you
234.72s: apply this to like any standard debt
237.00s: metric that our minds are probably
238.36s: defaulting to this skews the way we
241.20s: receive the information whereas if you
242.80s: look at it objectively over a much
245.48s: broader data set you'll find stuff that
247.56s: has crazy high PE ratios especially in
249.92s: places like Tech and whatnot that just
252.36s: keep flying so that's not to say that
254.72s: they're a great bargain that's not to
256.48s: say that there's value but from a
258.80s: trading
259.80s: perspective what ultimately matters to
262.12s: somebody like me is does the price go up
265.72s: I don't care if it goes up because of
267.32s: momentum drift value because your grand
269.72s: grandma likes it and bought it and she
271.20s: has a bunch of money and drives the
272.52s: price up I couldn't care less what makes
275.00s: it go up as long as these candles keep
277.12s: going up that's what I ultimately care
278.72s: about so this I thought was really
281.28s: interesting and I wanted to poke through
283.56s: this one really quick and then actually
285.80s: take a look through the options chain
287.36s: and stuff like that and let's see let's
289.80s: see what this person has to say um it
292.48s: looks like they've been covering it for
294.20s: a while they rated it as a sell due to
297.60s: overvaluation limited growth
300.32s: bearish calls successful about a year
302.32s: see and again this is the problem right
304.72s: like this to me looks like somebody that
308.44s: is trying to cope a little bit because
311.84s: if you're talking about somebody that's
313.28s: using stuff like PE ratios that's not
316.00s: something that reflects in value
317.84s: overnight meaning this is inherently
320.20s: somebody that's talking about this from
321.68s: an investment time frame right and you
324.12s: can see that reflects well here might
326.48s: not end well for buyers in 2 to 3 years
329.40s: so this I find a little again just copy
332.76s: where we're saying that it's good for
334.08s: about a year and then it wasn't so I
338.08s: would rather just talk about stuff
339.40s: objectively but
341.16s: anyways um due to the persistent
343.32s: overvaluation couldn't upgrade paler to
346.92s: buy again I don't know if that's just
349.08s: like something with their model I don't
350.60s: know this person they could have a very
352.32s: specific model that they look to follow
355.28s: but I personally would find this a
358.40s: constraint in a model if this is the the
361.36s: premise for it or it might call into
364.36s: question what the system of valuation is
367.80s: if you have something that is considered
370.28s: overvalued but then uh let's see when
374.40s: they change I don't know when they
375.64s: change their
377.48s: rating
379.12s: um let's see this one says be realistic
383.56s: the stock is not worth it and this is
385.44s: from 5 October 21 now I want to be clear
388.44s: as I'm looking through this anybody can
390.52s: make a call that's wrong so I'm not
393.08s: getting on them at all for putting
394.96s: something out there that clearly ended
396.88s: up not being the case simply
399.64s: because it like just because they're
403.20s: putting their opinions out there
404.88s: publicly obviously it will get a little
407.00s: more scrutiny but like I've made plenty
410.00s: of wrong calls I am not pretending like
411.88s: I'm any better than anybody else at all
414.96s: but all that being said the I just want
418.52s: to see how this is moving since they
420.16s: talked about it so it was about 20s up
422.48s: until the 66 handle now okay so then um
427.72s: they upgraded to a hold in Feb of
432.92s: 23 so I don't really know what that
437.12s: means it's a good timing great timing on
439.88s: that quote unquote upgrade I mean this
441.96s: looks like it would be a buy but I can
444.24s: tell that they're using very much a
445.68s: standard value perspective right cuz
447.48s: they thought 25 too high they thought
450.08s: obviously there's value in here with it
451.84s: between 5 and 10 and then obviously
454.56s: there's been recent catalysts driving it
456.72s: up significantly since then so I would
458.84s: give this partial credit right I think
461.12s: upgrading it doesn't upgrading it to a
463.76s: whole doesn't mean buy so that
465.44s: essentially means that there's no
466.56s: purchase going on there so I I wouldn't
468.52s: call that correct but not putting it as
471.88s: like a sell or whatever they maintain
474.68s: that's good so uh let's see
480.08s: could give Bulls another Catalyst
482.28s: glowing overvaluation limited returns
484.96s: years
485.84s: ahead today we see the companies growing
488.16s: bounds and leaps Leaps and Bounds I
490.60s: guess Leaps and Bounds that sounded
492.60s: weird when I said bounds and
494.84s: leaps believe the current valuation is
497.64s: primarily driven by unrealistic hope and
499.32s: overextended expectations rather than
500.88s: tangible fundamentals and I don't again
503.08s: from one of the things that we have to
504.60s: keep in mind when we look at stuff like
505.92s: this are different perspectives they're
507.96s: applying a very different lens they're
509.92s: applying a value investing lens so
513.20s: there's I completely agree with them
514.92s: from a value perspective this absolutely
518.52s: looks very very very overvalued just on
521.80s: an objective basis with something with
523.40s: really high PE ratios and to go all the
526.76s: way back to the original point just
528.08s: because something has a high PE ratio
530.00s: does not mean that it can continue to go
532.20s: up but it does mean for somebody that's
533.80s: a value investor they're probably going
535.76s: to try to look other places where they
537.28s: can get better value super normal
540.08s: so let's take a quick look at actually
542.36s: what's going on here out of curiosity on
543.92s: a one-year time frame we've gone from 15
546.16s: to 67 on the six month we already looked
549.24s: at we've essentially tripled and on a
551.96s: 3-month time frame it's still in a
554.80s: really really aggressive growth phase
557.16s: the other thing I want to highlight is
558.68s: earnings smashed it was expected as a
561.72s: nickel and it came in at a dime so two
563.76s: times expected earnings is really really
565.80s: solid its earnings performance here also
568.72s: did a great job job it was expected at 4
570.60s: cents came in at 9 so the reason why
572.84s: that matters to me is because earnings
574.80s: growth is a big factor for stuff like
577.20s: this and this is a a from a a Trader's
581.40s: perspective changing the lens to My Lens
584.36s: positive post earnings announcement
586.48s: drift is a thing and it's exhibited it
589.48s: here so far it's exhibited it here so
591.76s: far it's a really dominant effect again
595.16s: that's well researched you can learn
596.72s: about it as much as you'd like online
598.48s: you can go to SSR and check it out so
600.08s: there's tons of information out there so
602.32s: from a chart perspective from a trading
604.48s: lens this looks great to me there's
606.76s: nothing I'm seeing that's freaking me
608.76s: out stuff is going to consolidate stuff
611.68s: is going to contract that doesn't mean
613.44s: it's straight up from here I have no
615.60s: idea that's not the way that I trade
617.32s: trying to predict with any sort of
619.28s: precision I try to play probabilistic
621.76s: moves and as long as it continues this
625.32s: sort of trajectory it looks bullish to
627.56s: me and then as soon as this starts l
629.32s: Ling off too much volume starts
631.80s: expanding and it's dropping those kinds
633.96s: of things that's not good and that makes
635.84s: me take some pause now I do see RSI is
640.24s: heavily overextended here without a
642.48s: doubt it's been overextended essentially
644.28s: from here which is pretty intense to be
646.40s: honest because the RSI with a 7-Day vwat
649.56s: moving average generally doesn't hold
651.40s: this kind of configuration so it is
654.36s: definitely um redlining on a relative
657.92s: strength index perspective I so let's
660.28s: take a look at some options here we have
662.92s: 1.7 million calls against 1.4 million
666.32s: puts and we are all over the map in
669.88s: terms of expirations we have stuff
671.60s: everywhere um we do absolutely have
675.28s: moderate call skew here now if we take a
678.36s: look at some of the near-term
680.00s: expirations for kind of a better look at
682.48s: what we're expecting near term over the
684.72s: next two primary expiration Cycles it's
687.04s: 740 versus 664
689.92s: and then in the 20D it's 308 to 272,000
695.52s: um oi so yeah I mean it's kind of in the
700.12s: short term people it's a mixed bag so
702.92s: that tells me that there's got to be
704.32s: larger skew that starts to emerge like
706.76s: as we get further out here 17 April this
709.04s: is typically a bigger expiration cycle
711.24s: about matched 129 to
714.00s: 125 and then out in 19 sap it's actually
717.40s: inverted with 55,000 puts against 51 on
721.44s: the call side that's the first we saw
723.52s: that same thing in O and then all the
725.60s: way out in Jan 26 you could tell people
727.36s: are pretty bullish where we have 165,000
730.48s: against 109 so yeah I mean overall
733.64s: positioning here definitely still looks
736.80s: slightly bullish I would call it
738.28s: slightly bullish and we do have decent
742.80s: IV but nothing is drawing my eye
746.60s: excessively now I want to take a look at
749.56s: the VA let's take a look at the averages
752.76s: first and then we'll do the out of the
756.80s: monies
759.80s: and yeah I mean this doesn't surprise me
764.20s: let's take a look at the out of the
765.16s: monies it's favor in the put side as per
767.88s: usual and yeah I mean there's nothing
771.48s: sticking out to me here from like a a
774.60s: weird Vault perspective or anything like
776.64s: that except this 20 June being this
779.24s: elevated relative to those but that's a
780.96s: v thing that doesn't really matter for
783.20s: this overall like just looking at
784.80s: broader positioning so yeah I mean this
788.84s: it looks fine to me I don't see anything
790.92s: in here that's leading me to believe
793.32s: that we're unwinding super fast or
795.44s: anything a couple other things to look
796.84s: at quick if we take a look at Insider
800.24s: sales for the past month there's a
803.16s: couple in here that are a little heavy
805.48s: so we can see like this changing 23% 18%
809.68s: of ownership this stuff doesn't look too
812.56s: crazy 5% 4% that's people generally
815.56s: taking comp out on things that are at
818.52s: really high levels on a relative basis
820.36s: so don't don't hate them for that at all
823.04s: but this is a little interesting because
826.04s: these are these are bigger these are
827.84s: absolutely bigger trades and let's see
830.88s: what they have going on and you can see
833.08s: that there's a little bit of a rationale
834.96s: here so this says uh transaction
838.52s: represents automatic sale of shares to
841.08s: cover required tax withholding
842.56s: obligations in connection with the
844.56s: vesting of restricted stock units so
846.76s: yeah nothing in here that is alarming to
850.60s: me then a lot of this looks to be
852.72s: structurally driven so yeah I mean from
855.36s: an insider trading perspective I like to
857.32s: see if there's big sponsorship flipping
859.16s: around and definitely more on the sell
862.48s: side than buy side there's absolutely no
864.40s: doubt about that but it doesn't look
867.88s: like there's a mass ACC or anything like
869.88s: that so when I think about Palante here
874.44s: I think about a stock that's had a
876.60s: really good run um who knows how far it
879.68s: goes there's a lot of wind at its back
882.12s: from a pure trading lens it's still
885.96s: showing strength so until it doesn't
888.36s: show strength that's when I change my
891.40s: opinion I apply basy and statistics I'm
894.00s: not out here making calls like people
896.48s: talk about I don't care at all about
898.12s: that I care about making money money and
900.08s: a big part of that when you come to
902.00s: analyzing the price of individual
903.64s: tickers is applying aasian analysis that
906.44s: means as new information comes out we
908.76s: then change what we're doing based on
911.12s: that new information and it's simply
913.76s: because it's difficult from a Traders
917.20s: perspective to project out what might be
919.60s: in 52 weeks I have no idea what can
922.48s: happen over 52 weeks so there's no way I
924.56s: could say I love this thing a year out
927.32s: from now because my job as a Trader is
930.76s: to trade movements as they're happening
932.92s: now from a value Traders or value
935.12s: investors perspective it's completely
936.68s: different they're looking to find things
938.68s: that are at really good relative values
940.84s: compared to the probability of the
942.36s: business doing really well in the future
944.32s: and they play those longer room longer
946.88s: moves dealing with the shorter term
949.12s: price variation so just a difference in
950.84s: approach really really interesting
952.44s: article there's nothing in there that I
954.36s: think is off just very different lenses
956.84s: which is fun to take a look at but yeah
959.28s: those are my thoughts on Palance here as
960.56s: always if you have any questions let me
961.92s: know be an outlier see you later
