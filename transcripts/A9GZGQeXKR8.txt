30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  the
96.20s:  your
104.88s:  what's up outlires just ran in here running a couple seconds behind we got a new TV sound bar
108.64s:  that I started trying to unpack and get all hooked up pretty stoked on it, but
114.10s:  There's a time and place for getting that set up and for looking at the markets, which is what we're going to do now. So
121.46s:  welcome in everybody. So what time we go? We got like two two that'll be our kickoff.
129.86s:  The game plan for today is really simple. The first thing I want to do is run through the markets pretty quick. Maybe spend 20, 30 minutes
138.34s:  rolling through seeing what we're seeing. There is, I mean, futures are up right now. So there is
143.78s:  a couple of things going on that I think are broadly interesting that we can start with.
148.50s:  And then we will pivot from there into this skill development session, which that is now Wednesdays
154.74s:  for those wondering what that's all about on Wednesdays now we're spending the tail half
161.54s:  very purposefully working on a skill of some sort, not necessarily in a particular order,
168.50s:  but the last two kind of are. And then for those that are in the outlier Patreon, the pro side,
175.46s:  then tomorrow this will expand into a natural case study where we will go much further into detail
182.66s:  and focus more on like the practical application side of things. This is more to introduce the
186.90s:  concept. So that everybody has an idea of, you know, the skill that we're talking about itself. So
193.86s:  that's the game plan here. The skill development segment for later today is going to be about building
200.58s:  a scalable trading approach. And there's a bunch of things that I want to talk about with respect to
205.94s:  that I was actually taking notes on it last night. And it's because there are a lot of things that go
213.06s:  into this process. I have like five major bullet points that I want to talk about. We're going to go
219.38s:  through the path that most traders take common mistakes that derail our ability to actually scale
228.18s:  our overall trading approach. And then setting a foundation for something that we feel comfortable
236.82s:  with scaling. So that's what we will get into on the tail half of the session. Let's see who we got
243.06s:  in the house. Looks like we got Hader Reese. We got Tommy Lauren travel. Shame Gar which is becoming
250.50s:  quickly one of my favorite things to say. It's just a fun, the fun thing to say I think. And then
255.86s:  we also got dark mark, Paulo, beautiful. We got the gang in town. So let's take a look at the
260.98s:  markets as a whole to start. We can see that the S&P 500 had a little bit of a down day, but it
267.06s:  has been on an absolute tear. So recently hit a high 610 fell off. And now it's been about level set.
274.10s:  Big Daddy J. Powell was talking earlier. We held rates. I don't think there was any shock there.
281.94s:  Some of his forward guidance, I think is somewhat topical because it started highlighting a
288.58s:  little bit more of an uncertainty element for the future, but overall pretty low impact on the
294.98s:  market today. I did trade volatility around it because the volatility was still there, but yeah,
299.78s:  just not a whole lot. Then for the cues we can see tech is following a very similar pattern.
306.98s:  The S&P 500 small caps is still just sucking wind. Small caps cannot catch a bid.
312.90s:  If we take a look at the movement in IWM on a slightly longer term time frame, actually even better.
322.02s:  Let's look at it in here and I'll change this grid. We'll do like a four by. And then let's do
328.50s:  spy. Let's do QQQ. Let's do IWM. And let's zoom these out.
343.38s:  Notice the difference. Everything from the slope of the standard deviation channels out to the
353.22s:  behavior that you see in this entire time frame. Small caps have been in a massively, massively,
363.54s:  massively consolidated position for some time now. So you can see if we take a look at IWM down here,
369.86s:  it's essentially been range bound in this time frame here. And then it started rallying up and
377.46s:  out just a bit. But even on this move in terms of severity, it's very light. So if we grab from
383.46s:  like the midpoint there, go to the midpoint here, about 13% move from when it actually started
389.38s:  to rally. If we take a look at the comparison from spy in the same thing, 44% move.
398.66s:  So small caps have not been the place to be for several years now, realistically.
407.78s:  Qs is 51%. The reason why I bring this up is because when we're trying to figure out,
415.30s:  especially for me, when I'm trading something like the coverage triangle, I have to figure out
418.42s:  where the money should be, where's the best place to commit the capital for obviously the optimal
424.26s:  return that I can find. And it's not small caps. And small caps are becoming a bigger question
432.98s:  mark for me to be honest with you. Now, if you take a look in terms of volatility, small caps
439.14s:  absolutely maintains much higher volatility. This is on display in terms of why I generally like to
444.98s:  trade something like IWM is if you take a look at the average daily ranges or average true ranges,
450.42s:  like you say in this scenario, they're much higher than the other two. And it is much better
455.86s:  diversified. The problem is is that even something like IWM is going to be tied to what the broader
463.06s:  economic landscape looks like and what the broader economic landscape looks like right now,
467.70s:  obviously is very rate focused and rates are kind of like the kryptonite for small cap companies,
474.50s:  small banks, all of those kinds of entities that exist there. So that becomes really important to
482.26s:  keep in mind. From when you decide to start coming up with thematic positions, we can kind of
490.10s:  identify that small caps are a questionable place for more thematic positions right now.
498.66s:  You can find volatility there. It's good for that. But for trying to trade more of like a
504.18s:  a positive drift style thing, I think it's a much harder a much harder sell. So weakness continues
512.90s:  there. Now, let's take a look back here. Let's see if anything sticks out to us. Palm services
519.86s:  up big. Financial is hitting new highs. I still do I still have that on? Yes. I still have the
527.06s:  visa ratio called diagonal right now. It's just long calls. But I still have that on.
536.42s:  And there was a couple that I put on over yesterday following up on the stream yesterday. There is
544.02s:  some stuff that we saw some really interesting unusual options activity in. But overall, not anything
551.86s:  looking too spicy, but financials are something to keep an eye on for upside because now it's
559.22s:  essentially challenging prior highs. Obviously, it posted term highs here on a three-month time frame.
565.06s:  But the you can see that it reeled back on this little tiny candle. So if it can sustain that,
571.14s:  then all of a sudden, financials start to look another interesting place to start allocating money
576.82s:  along with comm services for upside plays, industrials rolling over. Take a look at tech.
583.22s:  Heck ain't happy here. And this is funny because if we go back to Nvidia,
590.50s:  we talked about Nvidia on Monday. And now we've had a couple days to see what it's done since.
597.06s:  And Nvidia right now is I haven't re-drawn these from when we first looked at this, right? And
603.54s:  essentially saying this looks like the range that it needs to figure out where it wants to break in.
609.54s:  And I have to be honest with you, I thought on this breakout, I thought today it would have had
620.66s:  a little more continuation that did not see. So that starts to add some questions in my mind
630.34s:  is to why would we have had this really strong update and then just a complete lack of follow-through
637.22s:  on the next day? Like that, that I really think is slightly telling. And telling in terms of the
644.42s:  way that people are trying to position in something like Nvidia, people are not super ultra-bullet
649.78s:  in here right now, unfortunately, which is a pretty big change compared to what it was in the
656.58s:  beginning. Also, is the stream laggy at all for you guys? Because I'm looking at the little,
662.34s:  I'm looking at OBS and it looks generally okay, but after that issue yesterday, I want to make
668.10s:  sure that it's actually behaving as it should. I might need to turn this down potentially.
678.10s:  Overall is stream coming through decent? Okay, cool. Thanks, Paula. Yeah, great.
684.82s:  So that's how I'm thinking about Nvidia. Range bound here until we see a clear break above either
696.34s:  of these. Once we see a clear break above either of these, then I think we start to have a defined
702.02s:  trend that can be traded either direction up or down. Now, still for longer term investors,
709.46s:  unequivocally, great investment opportunity. I still think this is a great investment opportunity.
714.02s:  There's the way to think about this from an investor's lens is in five years, is Nvidia likely
720.82s:  going to be worth more now, worth more than than it is now. And I would feel pretty confident
726.18s:  making that wager to the upside. And that's just because of how well Nvidia has been positioned
731.38s:  to be involved in essentially everything that happens with all of the technological
736.98s:  technological innovation that's occurring right now between AI, AGI, general robot, like
743.54s:  every sort of big adoption or innovation within tech is essentially using some sort of Nvidia
752.18s:  product, whether it's processors chips, so on and so forth, it's heavily involved in the total
759.06s:  space. So from an investor's perspective, to me, this is like a no brainer for traders. Again,
764.98s:  we need to see some sort of movement. And right now, it's not really showing a whole lot of that
772.42s:  from a risk premium perspective. It doesn't look good, not touching it from there. And what I
777.22s:  mean by that is the total amount of risk premium given to the to the average size moves that you're
783.38s:  seeing on a daily basis is crazy. So if you take a look at the average daily range for a five day
790.34s:  window, it's six point eight three percent average daily range. This is not average true range,
798.10s:  is average daily range. And average daily range does not take into account these giant gaps overnight.
805.06s:  It's talking about the daily move in trade day. So six point eight three percent on a five day
810.98s:  average ADR. Take a look at the 90 day three point six three. So it is massive volatility compared to
819.46s:  what it tends to be. And right now, it's not really being priced then enough from a short-term
826.02s:  vol trading perspective. Unfortunately, because otherwise, I would much prefer to be able to trade
831.78s:  something like this. These are where you can get really, really interesting opportunities from a
836.18s:  vol trading perspective, but not always. And it's because right now, it's still just moving too
841.06s:  much. It needs to chill TF out before it starts to look more attractive. Take a look at the average
847.54s:  true range, which is five days nine point four one percent. The 90 day is four point four two percent
856.26s:  over double the average true range, which obviously accounts for overnight gaps. So
864.18s:  volatility and Nvidia has jacked up significantly. And while it's doing that trending sideways,
872.26s:  it can look kind of lucrative from a vol traders perspective. But my hunch is sooner or later,
877.70s:  it's going to get a break one way or the other. And I still have to maintain a slightly longer term.
883.62s:  I mean, a slightly bullish leaning in it just because of the company and where it's at. But yeah,
891.06s:  we'll see. Now, let's take a look at a couple other common tickers right now. So far, same same.
900.66s:  Honestly, so far, unimpressive here. It had earnings. It beat earnings slightly. And the stock
908.58s:  just didn't care. Unfortunately, I was hoping to see a little bit more of a kickoff for positive
914.50s:  drift, which isn't the case right now. So I'll actually drop a couple alerts here to see if it does
920.82s:  end up breaking. I still have a long side bias in so if I don't have a position on it right now.
925.78s:  But my general bias is more long. But again, just right now, not really suitable for a position.
932.90s:  And then there's not P and W. That's not what I'm thinking of. We'll look at it. But
942.02s:  I'll answer is what I wanted to look at it.
946.66s:  But this does not look good. This looks bad. Why does this look so bad?
950.26s:  This starts to look like a short candidate, doesn't it?
959.06s:  Why does this look so bad? What's wrong with them?
967.38s:  Trying to figure out what the deal is.
972.82s:  What did they say? What was this a video?
976.50s:  No. Any idea?
982.34s:  Reese says ADR versus ATR. What's the difference? ADR is average daily range. It looks at daily moves.
987.62s:  ATR is average true range. It accounts for overnight moves.
994.26s:  Reese says moves sympathetically with Nvidia. Not really. I don't think that's true.
1001.86s:  Let's take a look.
1006.50s:  We'll do a top bottom. We'll do
1012.42s:  the ADW. And then we'll do Nvidia. Yeah, I don't really think so.
1018.74s:  Nvidia had that big drop on the 27th. And this had an update on the 27th.
1027.70s:  I'm just curious why it's down so big today. It's down almost 4%.
1031.62s:  Anyways, I don't really care that much. I'm just curious.
1038.26s:  Weird. Let's take a look at a pounce here.
1045.14s:  Better but not good still. I really don't care for how
1051.70s:  this support is just teetering out as it gets up towards this top.
1057.30s:  Let's take a look at a couple other examples of recent directional moves.
1061.30s:  Here. So DVN, we talked about this. We talked about a perspective breakdown below this specific
1069.86s:  candle, which starts to signify, in my opinion, a lot of downside weakness. And we actually got,
1076.02s:  not a big move, but we got an okay move in a relatively short-term timeframe. Now,
1081.14s:  the cool part is with options, you don't need a big move. That's the whole point of trading
1084.58s:  options for directional stuff as you gain leverage. So in this case, it actually worked out pretty
1090.74s:  well. But this is something that like had a clear break and then continue through the break.
1096.02s:  Today, it's consolidating. I've already exited the trade, but this still looks generally
1102.42s:  downside focused. And there's some some pretty clear continuation in that direction.
1108.98s:  This is strange. We see a rally, gap down rally, back up. Like that's just
1119.22s:  really strange stock behavior. And it is coming into earnings, which another thing that you
1127.06s:  typically see for for companies as they're coming into the earnings cycle is they kind of trend sideways
1132.98s:  coming into earnings more often than not, barring other news, not being there and stuff like that.
1137.94s:  So that's just another element in here that drives at least some level of curiosity from my perspective.
1146.02s:  This still isn't suitable for a directional trade, again, for my trading windows. Longer trading
1154.18s:  windows, again, probably fine. I think balance here is probably really, really, really well positioned
1160.50s:  in a longer-term timeframe. But I think on a shorter-term timeframe, it's not ready yet.
1169.30s:  The name of trading is striking a balance between learning when to trade and when not to trade.
1180.26s:  And there are plenty of periods where it's literally better off not putting a trade on in
1185.70s:  something even if you have an idea behind it or some sort of thesis. Again, like,
1190.10s:  balance here, if somebody were to ask me where do I think it'll be in three years, I think
1193.78s:  it'll be higher for sure. And the reason why I think that is just because of where it sits in
1198.34s:  terms of the contracting space and it's doing a good job nessling up to the money printer that is
1204.82s:  federal government. But short-term sentiment and short-term sentiment is a little bit sporadic here,
1211.62s:  which I can't help but find slightly curious. Let's take a quick look at futures. So E-minis are
1220.98s:  up a little bit. Russell is up almost half a point kind of leading, which is
1226.74s:  fucking weird. Nasdaq is up almost half a point. That doesn't make sense to me on a relative basis.
1233.22s:  Vicks down half a point. Bitcoin still hovering around that 100,000 range. Gold really not changing
1242.74s:  crude up just a little bit, but massive downtrend. My guess is you'll continue to see crude run down.
1251.30s:  Actually, that leads me to a need to drop an alert in here.
1256.50s:  I had a crude trade not that long ago. And then I took it down, but I still think with the overall
1266.10s:  near-term expectation for Trump policies is obviously likely oil prices will continue to contract
1275.54s:  to a degree. Net gas big gap down. Fucking everybody's day up as net gas does. When from
1283.22s:  37 down to 31 ish. Good. You trade net gas. You should never be happy. That's the nature of trading
1292.18s:  that gas. And corn is still on an absolute tear.
1301.78s:  Curious. Very, very curious. Cool. So let's take a look at overall market internals now.
1312.98s:  And see if anything sticks out to us here. I don't know about this whole meta.
1325.14s:  The Zuck rebrand has been fucking crazy. He really does look like a straight fuck boy.
1331.14s:  Like at first, I thought that there was a couple joke,
1336.42s:  adult-erred images that were put up of him. But like he really is not to comment. I don't know.
1343.62s:  It's like I'm not trying to comment on his looks because I don't care that much, but he does have
1347.78s:  that vibe. Like he really, really does have that vibe, which is just, I don't know if it's just me.
1353.46s:  But yeah, like this is just weird. He's gone through like a very dedicated rebrand,
1367.62s:  though, which is really interesting. So let's take a look through meta earnings.
1372.90s:  So where are we at? We're at 23.
1383.78s:  Be the year when a highly intelligent personalized AI assistant reaches more than one billion.
1388.50s:  I expect meta AI to be the leading AI assistant. So they came in, god damn, 20.8 billion.
1396.74s:  It's just so much fucking money.
1401.14s:  802 a share solid, up 50%. You're over here. Man, you want to talk about like driving value.
1411.06s:  Revenue is up 21%. Here's the crazy thing. These companies have been growing at this pace for
1419.86s:  some time now. It is insane. How sustained these moves have been. Absolutely insane.
1431.94s:  Market is showing up like 20 points.
1437.14s:  It was expected out of 50 point moves. So right now within the expected move on the straddle.
1443.38s:  But man, what an absolute crush.
1450.10s:  They were expecting 676 and they came in at 802. So again, this might be a case where we could see
1460.58s:  we could see post earnings announcement drift even in mega cap companies, which has become more and
1465.54s:  more rare. Which is just so strange. Lauren says he gives 90% of women the creeps too. Well,
1476.10s:  he's married. So I feel like y'all are safe. He doesn't seem anything bad like that. He just
1483.70s:  just awkward. But I mean, I'm awkward too. We're all awkward in our own way.
1491.62s:  Think of it this way. He started as a tech nerd that had a cool idea that has now become one of
1500.34s:  the most powerful companies on planet earth. It's kind of like when you look in the corporate world
1508.02s:  and you see a lot of people that are in managerial positions and they've never actually been trained
1513.62s:  on being a manager. They just kind of stayed at the company long enough and they slowly got promoted.
1518.90s:  They might have been a really good individual contributor, but then they get promoted to manager.
1523.30s:  And it's kind of like, you're not very good at this. It's like he's not trained. Well,
1530.50s:  he's been in the role long enough to figure it out at this point. But I think a lot of
1536.82s:  I think a lot of people's criticisms of them early on. It's like, I don't fucking know what I
1541.94s:  would be doing if I ran a company this size when the original idea was something pretty mellow.
1549.54s:  It's actually funny. Somebody made it. They were asking me like, what would I do if the YouTube
1556.34s:  channel started to like, actually blow up, meaning just like really aggressively grow.
1561.30s:  Because right now it's been growing at a very steady rate and it's become like a comfort
1566.58s:  zone for me, right? Because when we do streams, I see familiar names. This is like a little
1571.22s:  little safe space, right? Comfortable. But you can just like expect if things started to scale
1578.82s:  massively, how much stuff that starts to change. One of the things that's really cool about being
1584.02s:  a smaller YouTuber is most people that pay attention to the content. They actually care about the
1589.54s:  content and the information and they understand the angle that I'm coming from and so on and so
1594.26s:  forth, which that's not the case. As you become a bigger YouTuber, you just have people that have
1598.98s:  fucking opinions that just want to say their opinions of you. And like you got to start dealing with
1603.62s:  more of that. That still happens now, but not anywhere near as much. So it's like there's a lot of
1609.70s:  big changes that can happen that you're not necessarily planning for or going into what the mindset of.
1616.66s:  So like when I don't know if you guys heard him on the Joe Rogan podcast, but it was really interesting
1622.18s:  because I had such a terrible perception of him on that on that podcast. It sounded so hard,
1637.22s:  like somebody that was like trying to come off as normal. And it just did not come off that way
1644.18s:  to me at all. And this whole idea about like the censorship stuff and all that bullshit,
1649.70s:  we don't have to get into all that nonsense. But the main thing is he flipped flopped on it.
1656.02s:  Right. In my opinion, he's talking about how the federal government compelled him to do certain
1661.70s:  things, take certain stuff down and that kind of stuff. And now afterwards, he's saying he's like,
1668.34s:  well, that's not right. We're not going to do that. But then it's like, well, that's what
1672.26s:  fucking happened when you were there. Right. Like the time to quote unquote stand up and do something
1678.50s:  is when it was happening, not afterwards that the landscape has changed. I just bring all that up
1684.02s:  because it strikes me as somebody who's still trying to identify their values and like the values
1691.46s:  that they want to apply to the broader company. Which includes things like how does he balance
1700.66s:  criticism? How does he balance things, you know, him making unpopular decisions and stuff like that.
1708.34s:  It's fucking weird. So yeah, I just, I do give him a little bit of grace, I guess, mentally,
1714.74s:  because he's doing a lot of, he's doing a lot of stuff that I'm not exactly sure that he got into
1722.18s:  this to do. But it's just fucking part of the job. Haters says his value is to make more money.
1728.74s:  See, like that's the thing. I actually don't really agree with that to be completely honest with you.
1734.10s:  There comes a point where you have so much money and it's actually money that's it's way less
1741.14s:  money than he has now that becomes just disgusting excess that it really is not about the money anymore.
1749.38s:  It be you don't even care about the fucking money anymore. That becomes down like in my opinion,
1755.22s:  that's tied to more stuff like power or just cerebral interest in something, whatever it is.
1762.66s:  But there's absolutely other drivers than just trying to make more money. Like he has more than he
1770.50s:  ever, yeah, he is more than he ever could have needed, which again, that's also why I'm so confused
1778.18s:  about the thing when he went on Joe Rogan and he was talking about how he he wasn't comfortable
1784.10s:  with what the federal government was asking him to do around the COVID vaccines and all that kind
1789.54s:  of stuff. But it's like, I just don't understand if you're that uncomfortable, why the
1793.22s:  fuck did you not make the decision then when it mattered versus now? That I just really don't understand.
1801.38s:  So and I probably won't. There's obviously a lot that he's thinking about and contending with that
1808.82s:  none of us will have any idea of. But I just find that all very strange. But like this, I think,
1817.30s:  is interesting, right? Because we're starting to get an understanding of where he's waiting things
1823.30s:  and what he really wants to see grow and what he wants meta to continue to become. Because if you
1832.10s:  remember, the whole idea of meta was tied to the metaverse, which I haven't heard shit about the
1838.66s:  metaverse. I don't know if you guys have. Now that's still I still think meta is, well, metaverse
1845.62s:  is still going to be coming increasing thing. I still think there's a lot of potential there. But
1849.46s:  it was like this crazy buzz that everybody was all on about. And then I just haven't seen shit about
1855.78s:  it. So to see the way that, you know, Facebook went through that original rebrand and obviously
1864.26s:  meta is not tied specifically to the metaverse meta is tied to meta, right? A much more meta concept.
1870.74s:  But I think I'm trying to understand more and more about where the companies trying to take
1877.86s:  things. Mel got me these meta. What the fuck is it? These meta, it's like these meta ray bands.
1886.58s:  They're just glasses. But at first, I thought it was going to be like augmented reality of some sort.
1892.18s:  But it's really not. It's just kind of like a glorified. It can like the sunglasses can take
1896.26s:  pictures, which I would never use. What I use those glasses for, which is actually a really nice
1900.74s:  thing. But it's when I do the hot tub so that I can listen to something and not have it playing out
1905.78s:  loud. And I just play it there instead of like earphones because I don't like earphones on
1910.26s:  my outside. So like that's interesting. But that doesn't, you know, that's not like a big weight
1916.82s:  for the company. Actually, let's take a quick peek at a big weight. I want to know what most of their
1923.70s:  values currently come. There you go. 97% from core Facebook advertising.
1946.02s:  I wouldn't have expected this to be honest with you. I knew. I absolutely knew
1953.38s:  that advertising obviously would be a dominant part of the business for sure. I didn't realize
1960.90s:  that it would be like 97% of the business. I thought that they would have some other
1969.62s:  some other irons in the fire.
1975.46s:  This does start to make a little more sense though with the decisions made during COVID.
1980.02s:  If you think of it from trying to protect this is the core business model. I can actually start
1985.70s:  to see that a little bit wild. Absolutely wild. So yeah, it's primarily from ads.
1997.54s:  Not even primarily like overwhelming majority, I should say.
2001.62s:  I'm not fucking crazy. Cool. Anything else we should take a look at quick before we pivot over to
2012.26s:  skills dev. I'll grab the pro workbook really quick just to see if any of you all had questions
2019.94s:  that we need to answer. It looks like we're good, good, good. We're good on pro questions. I don't
2026.02s:  see any trades that we want to hit. So that's ideal. So we are here now on skill dev.
2034.02s:  Let's grab this. Drop that in there.
2040.58s:  And keep the formats.
2043.94s:  I look at EIX because I don't fucking.
2055.22s:  What the fuck?
2060.90s:  Yo.
2065.46s:  What the fuck am I looking at right now? My brain is trying to comprehend what the hell this is.
2071.86s:  Okay, let me take a couple guesses. This looks like some sort of deal fell through.
2080.58s:  Some sort of big approval didn't happen. Or maybe a failed M&A.
2094.50s:  Any of I don't know if anybody knows. We'll find out. But like, the reason I'm saying this
2099.14s:  is because the stock has been around rotating between 88 and a half and 80 and a half. So a
2105.38s:  10 point range, or I'm sorry, yeah, 10% range for months. And then this, this started it.
2115.62s:  And then this just got massively accelerated.
2122.66s:  Paul says utility company being sued for allegedly causing CA wildfires. Boom, there you go,
2127.38s:  legal action. That will do it. That would fucking do it. When did that happen? Let's take a look
2132.66s:  at the eighth. I would expect to see something around the eighth. Yeah, boy, look at that.
2137.86s:  You're fucking spot on. Nice job, Paulo. That's exactly correct.
2142.50s:  Southern, oh, man.
2149.46s:  Look at this.
2153.14s:  That's exactly correct.
2154.58s:  Wildfires are prompting power shutoffs.
2168.34s:  Let's see.
2170.74s:  Creating lower amid wildfires in California. Is this normal?
2178.66s:  Oh, fuck. Sorry, we have to go on a side quest, everybody.
2184.74s:  Oh, let's take a look.
2191.14s:  Create a list of publicly traded utility companies that have operations where that provide
2208.02s:  service in California.
2214.66s:  What I'm doing is I'm getting a list. I need to update our thing because now we're
2221.06s:  definitely going to go down a little bit of a side quest here.
2224.34s:  So we're at 37 minutes. We'll call it side quest.
2232.50s:  And we're going to look at CA utility. Wildfires.
2239.70s:  Have to know.
2243.22s:  Too interesting.
2245.22s:  So for those that don't know what I'm doing, I
2251.22s:  I really want to know the relationship between these publicly traded companies.
2260.98s:  And
2263.94s:  why is EIX not on this list?
2269.86s:  I want to know if there's a relationship between these companies on average and wildfires.
2275.14s:  Because if so, that becomes a tradeable event.
2286.50s:  Okay. So next,
2289.70s:  create a list of large wildfire
2300.18s:  dates that impacted California.
2305.70s:  The reason why I'm taking the time to do this with you guys just in case like this is how you
2309.30s:  come up with ideas. This is exactly how you come up with ideas. This would be a less
2314.58s:  utilized idea potentially. But nonetheless, this is the process of being a trader and
2318.74s:  looking for effects that you can trade. This will be called the California wildfire effect.
2325.06s:  So what I'm doing is I want to see if there's a normalized relationship between these.
2334.66s:  So there's PCG. So we'll have symbol or ticker. PCG. SCE. SRE. EIX.
2349.70s:  EWT which is water. SJW which is water.
2359.46s:  So these are Nat gas electricity. These two are water.
2364.82s:  Okay.
2369.22s:  Provide the specific date
2374.66s:  fire started for each.
2390.02s:  So now what I'm doing is I'm figuring out the actual date that each started. So fire date.
2404.58s:  Format as a table.
2414.98s:  Conclude the little acreage and
2424.90s:  estimated.
2425.70s:  Well, so what we're going to do.
2435.38s:  Lightly reformat. I could have just used transpose but it can be in a simple tip.
2447.54s:  This is actually probably the decent focus.
2456.10s:  All right. Let's.
2461.94s:  Perfect.
2469.38s:  So right now you can see I'm essentially using chat GPT to help me.
2475.14s:  I'm figuring out when the actual dates were. I'm figuring out the total severity for each fire.
2482.66s:  And then I'm figuring out whatever the estimated cost was.
2488.66s:  Associated with each. And then what we can do is we can take a look at the ticker performance
2494.10s:  around these individual days. Now if I were to and this from a date at like an actual data
2498.50s:  analysis perspective, what I would be doing is just grabbing the stock data for each of these
2503.86s:  and quickly overlaying them. We literally can just eyeball it really fast.
2508.58s:  Just because I don't want to burn too much more time on this here. This will be something
2512.34s:  I'll probably finish as an extra curricular, you know, for for your boy.
2517.38s:  But let's take a look at a really long-term timeframe. We'll look at 10 year
2520.18s:  Jesus. We'll take a look at a 10 year monthly. And let's take a look at.
2526.50s:  So January 7th obviously, let's take a look at 13 July of 21.
2537.22s:  21 here. So it might be something there.
2542.18s:  The 16 aug of 20.
2549.46s:  Might be something here.
2554.42s:  8 Nov 2018.
2558.74s:  Clearly something here, right? Do you notice something so far?
2562.50s:  Like this is actually already something that I care about.
2572.74s:  So there's a clear effect here. Just fucking eyeball in one of these. Let's go to do one more.
2578.82s:  Men to see no, hey, that's not that far. That was a small one,
2582.02s:  $250,000,000,000. But that one is 27 July 18.
2588.26s:  That one didn't register. And then 4d 17.
2596.58s:  No shit.
2597.30s:  That's kind of big. If you look at the largest candles on this,
2607.14s:  at least a not significant sample of them are tied to wildfires.
2612.58s:  So I'm actually going to stop doing this so that we can take a look at this more closely together.
2617.70s:  But what I can tell you, that's a tradable effect, like for sure.
2622.02s:  Super fucking interesting.
2626.50s:  There you go. Pro tip on how to create and find tradable effects.
2635.94s:  Now let's pivot over and let's talk about this other topic.
2642.98s:  We'll keep that on our scratch.
2647.38s:  And let's add another scratch.
2652.50s:  Now the session for today is specifically tied to figuring out how to develop a scalable approach.
2669.14s:  And there's a few things I want to cover first. And then there are a bunch of questions and stuff
2678.10s:  that I have for you. So if you are able to type in, I would love if you're able to type in as we
2686.98s:  go through this because I want to kind of tailor this depending on the responses that we get.
2694.18s:  I think that that's generally more interesting and more useful, hopefully for you.
2700.42s:  So let's take a look at this.
2705.62s:  We have to grab our little drone pad.
2708.10s:  Here we go.
2723.46s:  Let's talk about this. What does this mean? A scalable trading approach. As always, we're going to start with an orientation.
2729.62s:  In a nutshell, this entire concept is to try and give more context for the average trader so that they make better decisions.
2748.50s:  The average trader will very often kind of commit a series of absolutely terrible choices.
2757.54s:  And it looks a lot like I'm just going to grab a trading account and I'm going to start trading and I'm going to hope that it works.
2769.70s:  Right. That's the idea. And the reality is obviously that's not how trading works. It's just not how this thing works. Thankfully.
2781.86s:  So the idea of trying to build a scalable trading approach is as we talk about all the time, the basics, right.
2794.34s:  Understanding the challenge like all that kind of shit. I don't really want to belabor those points because they've been made clear.
2801.14s:  I think for as many times as we talked about it. But here's the the cliff notes version for like this very high level opening concept.
2810.58s:  Markets.
2814.74s:  Offer. Big rewards.
2821.70s:  Here's the deal. You can make more than a fucking doctor. You can make more than a lawyer. You can make more than a doctor and a lawyer fucking combined.
2831.70s:  You absolutely can. It is a thing. The probability of that happening is not super high.
2838.58s:  There's a lot of nuance that goes into that. But the point is is that it is a truly possible scenario. I have.
2846.50s:  And I am a fucking idiot, which is hilarious. Very funny to me.
2852.58s:  The broader point though is markets allow a scalability that is not available other places.
2863.54s:  Even if you are a highly successful attorney, right. And let's say that that attorney is not running their own practice because obviously attorneys that run their own practice if they're successful can do way better.
2879.38s:  But let's just say that you're a standard attorney working at a big law firm. You will make a lot of fucking money.
2885.06s:  You will absolutely make quarter million dollars, half million dollars. And then once you become a partner, you're selling business definitely over million dollars well within the realm of possibility.
2895.38s:  That's a really, really solid path to take.
2899.54s:  In order to attain that, you have to go to school for a while. You have to do really fucking well in school. Then you got to go to law school. Then you get a pass bar.
2910.26s:  I don't know if that's the right order. You get the point.
2913.94s:  Well, yeah, it's the right order law school bar. And then you have to try to get in somewhere, right. That's a really high powered firm that's going to pay you those kind of amounts.
2925.94s:  But guess what? You get into one of those high powered firms. You are going to work. You're going to work.
2934.98s:  Fucking hard. Same thing with the doctor. You have a doctor that's going to the process learning a very highly technical skill.
2943.14s:  They spend years and years and years trying to develop this skill set. They finally do that. They get out into the world. They start building a brand name for themselves.
2954.02s:  And then they become a highly sought after doctor. The time where they're making those really big returns, meaning money from their expertise.
2963.54s:  Is after people have put in quite a lot of time and effort.
2967.70s:  Trading offers genuinely similar style rewards on average. I know traders that have absolutely done better than
2978.34s:  a non trivial amount of exceedingly high performing professional services jobs.
2986.18s:  I think most of us do okay once you're at a professional level. The rewards are there. But here's the problem. Most people they start here. Oh, my bad.
3001.22s:  Game on me.
3004.18s:  I have to get quiet when I do this because it takes a lot of focus to get the right proportions.
3017.70s:  There we go. So we have a trader here, non-descript trader, and they come across Robin Hood.
3027.30s:  And then they start pressing buttons on the phone, hoping to essentially have a pool full of money.
3038.82s:  That's the idea. You press enough of these buttons, you make enough money, then you could have a ton of money somewhere else.
3046.66s:  What that is trying to do if we think of this as a starting point, the start. If we think about these other careers,
3055.94s:  they'll have like a early middle to five year mark, kind of a tenured professional, and then you'll have a developed.
3064.66s:  What these people are trying to do is essentially go from here, skip over all this shit, and have the outcome of this bucket over here.
3078.02s:  Meanwhile, creating my opinion is actually best done in this fashion.
3094.26s:  Just like every other fucking career. It is a stair step pattern that's built on progressive
3106.18s:  expansion of our skills up until the point of your skill cap, not gap,
3114.10s:  cap. That's what's going to shortchange you from being able to take the next step is whatever your skill cap is.
3122.82s:  That skill cap can come in a lot of different shapes and forms. It can come from you being such a good trader
3130.42s:  that you make a bunch of money, you scale your account, and you scale the account so much that you
3136.66s:  no longer can trade the things that you traded in order to scale the account. That could happen.
3142.50s:  That's not the case for most people, but that can happen. The point is the idea of building a scalable
3148.66s:  trading approach is embracing this trajectory.
3160.42s:  The whole point of accepting this upfront is so that we can build a process that allows us to do this.
3174.90s:  What does that mean? Well, it means that our starting goal is not to take the $10,000 account we have
3185.46s:  in turn that into $10,000,000. It's accepting the fact that there's going to be a lot of things
3194.02s:  that has to happen between these two points. Let's talk about how we can set up our growth
3203.78s:  trajectory to then scale appropriately. We have to clear all this out.
3210.98s:  We know all of the basics at this point. I'm not going to belabor the points of trading plan,
3220.58s:  trading logs, risk management. I'm taking all of that for granted here, like the fundamentals
3226.42s:  of being a trader. Essentially, if we think of the starting point over here, starting point,
3233.38s:  I am talking to your you and this group as if we are about here. I would consider this year one
3247.06s:  to three somewhere in that time frame. This is again where we have the basics out of the way.
3254.74s:  We've now we've gone through this stage over here, which really is typically sub-year, I think is
3262.66s:  pretty fair. I call this blissful ignorance. This is where we tend to think this is going to be easy,
3277.06s:  this is going to be fast easy money. We're going to be able to just do this with low effort. We're
3281.94s:  going to trade this one strategy and we're going to make a ton of money. No problem. It's super easy.
3288.66s:  Blissful ignorance. That's this shaded area and this shaded area also happens to be
3297.62s:  where we start to see the overwhelming of majority of traders fail. Again, call this the 90%
3306.02s:  and then as we know, the five-year time frame, this is where the total attrition typically rises to
3313.70s:  the total of 95% ish, where then you have a 5% remaining ish, cohort of traders that have figured it
3323.22s:  out within this time frame have built something that they can continue to maintain and grow.
3330.58s:  It's now part of their skill set. It's a core competence. The majority of people are going to
3338.82s:  wash out in here. Let's talk about the traits of these different groups. I'm going to switch from
3350.02s:  that little ladder thing to a time series. That's supposed to be an s, not a five. I don't know why
3357.06s:  defaulted to that. We have a start and then over here, we're going to call this professional.
3365.06s:  Now for professional, there's not really a time amount. I'm ballparking it. Like we say in the
3371.78s:  Marine Corps, we trade into a standard, not to a time. You can become a professional faster than
3376.90s:  this, but for context, typically mastery is around the 10,000 hour mark for skilled effects. Again,
3387.38s:  give or take and for context that essentially is five hours per day for five and a half years
3397.86s:  without missing a single day. That's how you hit 10,000 hours.
3406.10s:  Yet most traders again mistakenly think that they're going to somehow hit mass really level
3413.46s:  within the first five years. But let's talk about this first five year mark that I talk about
3416.74s:  this fabled five year mark. Now this again is blissful ignorance.
3425.70s:  And this is essentially going to be coupled with randomness, mistakes.
3436.26s:  And the blissful ignorance section, I think, is about one year. So to tie that over here,
3445.78s:  this is where nothing is really happening. You're not doing anything really productive.
3451.86s:  You're just kind of fucking around and probably losing money. Like that's what's happening
3455.94s:  in this first year mark for most people. Now there are some people that take a different path.
3461.54s:  I absolutely did myself. And this is one of my very, very sincere hopes. This is why I'm doing this
3471.38s:  at 1,800 Anna. What is today? Wednesday night with you all is my sincere hope is to try to
3478.66s:  expose people to this sooner so that we don't have to waste this much time and money to figure out
3484.50s:  that there's some shit that we got to do in order to make this work. So now we come to
3491.70s:  an important turn after the first year marker. So and this is where I call the overwhelmed phase.
3505.38s:  And that essentially spans somewhere in here. The overwhelmed phase is kind of specific.
3521.62s:  This is typically post-gunning career.
3534.58s:  This is generally when we start to identify the challenge.
3541.46s:  We understand the opportunity.
3554.26s:  And we know that there's a lot of work to do.
3561.86s:  So this I generally would attribute to be essentially between year one, year two,
3568.02s:  something like that. And overwhelmed is tied with other things. It's going to be tied with fear.
3574.02s:  It's going to be tied with hesitation.
3579.54s:  And essentially this is the analogy that I think makes sense. I'm kind of making it up as I
3584.82s:  go. So it might not be the best analogy but work work with me. I'm thinking of it as imagine you're
3590.58s:  walking on a tightrope. And let's say that you stand on the tightrope or maybe it's like two by fours.
3598.02s:  Right. So it's maybe more applicable to people. Most people can walk on a two by four.
3602.10s:  And you're walking on two by fours and you're just kind of having some fun. You look down,
3606.82s:  you can see the ground on both sides. So it's low risk. If you fall off the two by fours,
3612.18s:  you're good, right? You just kind of walk on these two by fours because it's fun to balance.
3616.98s:  What ends up happening in the trading analogy is that some point you look down and you realize
3623.78s:  that it's not the fucking ground. It's fog. It's something else. But you now realize that there is
3631.70s:  a big asphalt that can happen on one misstep. You've been walking pretty comfortably on it.
3640.74s:  Blissful ignorance. You didn't think it was anything. Didn't think anything bad could happen if
3644.34s:  you fall. But then you finally realize that you can fall. And if you fall, you're fucked.
3651.46s:  This is when we hit the overwhelmed phase because now there are big stakes that we identify.
3659.94s:  The thing that we had been doing relatively successfully has now just gotten jacked up in our
3666.02s:  mind in terms of severity. And now we're struggling to even take the next step. We're scared.
3673.14s:  We don't want to take the next step because that one might make us fall. This is one where in the
3678.58s:  overwhelmed phase. And there's a couple things we can do to overcome it. I got to pop the door for
3682.90s:  Thor.
3694.66s:  And this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight with you all because I think for a lot of people,
3703.38s:  this is likely where a lot of people come across the outlier community, my community.
3710.18s:  And this is also probably where you start to get overwhelmed
3719.06s:  plus plus. Meaning even more overwhelmed. Because now we know that there's a lot of work to do.
3727.22s:  There's a long way to go. This stuff's complex. And then you're going to start hearing terms you
3731.46s:  don't know. You're going to understand that there's a whole other level to this stuff
3743.30s:  that you didn't know exists. You're going to see the business side of trading, which is kind of
3751.54s:  ugly. It's going to look like research, which is time consuming. It's going to look like trading
3760.42s:  plans, trading logs, AARs, all this shit that you have to do. And you're like, damn, damn.
3772.18s:  Not only do I have to learn the fucking markets, but there's all this shit that I don't even know
3777.78s:  where to go. I don't even fucking know where to go from here. This is the this is the cohort
3785.46s:  we're talking to today specifically. Because once you're past this stage, you're kind of good.
3792.34s:  You're generally on a glide slope. And if I grab the website really quick to give you an example of
3799.46s:  this. And I think it's on this one. Yeah.
3812.74s:  And if we take a look at essentially the Dunning Kruger effect as it exists here,
3819.46s:  you'll notice that we have the skill gap peak, Mountstupid, whatever you want to call it.
3825.22s:  We go through here and then we get to a point where this is known as the slope of learning,
3830.10s:  slope of enlightenment, again, whatever you like to call it. But the main point is that you start
3838.90s:  finding that this is doable. There's a way to approach it. That's scalable. That we can maintain
3846.42s:  going forward. That will eventually get us to where we're trying to go. So the hope is to tackle
3855.38s:  this stage where we need to start turning things into action in order to see the outputs that we
3862.82s:  want. So this is again specifically for this overwhelmed group, typically. So let's talk about
3872.42s:  the overwhelmed group and what's going on here.
3876.66s:  My guess is there's no shortage of you in the stream right now that have felt this or do feel this.
3893.14s:  So let me ask you, what are the main contributors to feeling overwhelmed?
3900.42s:  My guess is that there will be quite a few to pick from. So I would love to hear some of your
3905.78s:  thoughts. There is a bunch that come to mind. And we're going to talk about three of them from my
3911.86s:  perspective and the fixes for all three of them. But I want to see your perspectives as well.
3920.10s:  So talk to me. What is some of the primary contributing factors to feeling overwhelmed in your
3926.18s:  opinion? And I will list out a few of mine. So travel says big mistakes. I knew this was going to
3936.02s:  happen. So Thor heard something in the house. He thought it was Mel getting home. She's not home.
3941.94s:  So I opened the door to let him out. And then I closed the door again. And now he's scratching
3946.26s:  out the door because he's like, well, Dave, I went out. I look, there's nobody here. But now I want
3950.02s:  to come back in, bro. EHODGE says, no true understanding of concepts. So lack of competence.
3965.54s:  Re says learning one thing shows five things to learn.
3980.66s:  Fear of losing.
3995.62s:  Travel says too many choices.
4004.58s:  Lauren says legs are too fucking long.
4010.42s:  Jamgar says made it too difficult to fast. Let's.
4027.54s:  Huns notice how many inputs there are here to this concept of being overwhelmed.
4036.74s:  Now the cool part is like any sort of really big problem we can break it up into smaller pieces
4044.66s:  and then we can successfully navigate it. So we'll talk about that in a second. I got to pop the door
4049.62s:  and let this Gremlin in. I'll put you guys on this one so that you guys can hang out for a second.
4097.06s:  We back at it. I realize that Mel's not here to feed him. So if we go to we'll probably have to end
4104.74s:  in like at least 20 minutes so that I can feed this beast. So let's talk about three big fixes here.
4115.94s:  So first one, these are the three that I have listed out. One is two many voices.
4131.46s:  Two literally looking at my notes that I wrote out. Niles is paralysis.
4135.86s:  Three complexity.
4152.82s:  To me, the overwhelming number of inputs to being overwhelmed stem from these three buckets.
4165.06s:  And we've talked about a really simple framework before we're getting better at this thing.
4178.10s:  So let's talk about too many choices. Too many choices is stuff like you're trying to do everything.
4184.42s:  You're switching stuff at random. You're trying to redesign everything from your own perspective.
4191.30s:  Your own lens instead of leveraging what exists. It's when you can't create order out of the number
4198.74s:  of potential avenues because there's so many different avenues to pick. It's those kinds of things.
4204.58s:  Analysis paralysis is when you begin testing something or exploring something or learning something.
4210.58s:  And then you get into this unhealthy cycle where it becomes ad nauseam. You are just doing it over
4216.90s:  and over and over again in all these different permutations. And it's this process that continues
4222.26s:  to grow voraciously. And then for complexity, it's when we continue to try and add more elements to
4230.98s:  what we're doing in order to make it better. But it begins to slow us down in the broader sense
4239.22s:  because now there's an additional thing we have to do. Maybe RSI will make this strategy better.
4244.02s:  Well, now you have to go look at RSI and all the different instances. Yeah, it does. Oh, wow.
4247.46s:  I wonder how RSI would do compared to slow the castics. Let me go look at that and then so on and so forth.
4253.86s:  So there are some really simple fixes genuinely for all of these. And again, we're going to go
4260.42s:  over them now. I'm going to walk you through how to break through this overwhelmed path into create a
4267.38s:  scalable learning and trading approach, meaning you're trading in your one lots now, but you're
4273.78s:  scared to go to two lots or you're not trading it all now because you're scared to place a trade.
4277.94s:  This it's just a progression and we can outline and build the progression together. And then tomorrow
4284.82s:  for the case study, what I'm going to do is use an actual like an actual scenario on how to build a
4293.38s:  timeline and then the very specific steps to do in different windows for the timeline. And the
4300.10s:  reason why I'm telling you this on this stream is if you you should do that. And it's because I think
4306.50s:  going through that exercise is what starts to turn this stuff into action versus just ideation,
4314.74s:  which is good. But sooner or later you get us to start doing some shit. So let's talk about how we
4323.70s:  overcome too many choices. The easiest way to overcome too many choices first step is define
4337.70s:  objectives. We have to be specific. So an example of defining objectives is why are we trading
4351.38s:  trading to make money? Okay, great answer, superficial answer, pretty much useful answer.
4358.74s:  And getting to the base of true objectives is actually what I spend a lot of time with people both
4366.42s:  in the mentoring sessions on these kinds of conversations even when I'm talking to veterans is because
4372.50s:  most of us we throw out a very superficial objective and then it really doesn't help us. It adds
4379.46s:  no clarity because it's so superficial. So an example of trying to action on this and take it
4384.90s:  further is essentially what we talked about last week starting with the money mindset exercise.
4390.74s:  And it doesn't have to be that it can be anything. But the point is to start with an actual in-depth
4397.62s:  analysis of what the fuck you're trying to do. So here's an example of a good objective. Right now
4408.82s:  I am a person I've been saving a little bit. Let's say I have 25k. And let's say that I've been
4416.82s:  trading for four years now. I have a good job. I'm able to save a certain amount of money. Let's say
4423.06s:  I can save on average $800 per month. And I'm trying to figure out when the fuck can I retire?
4434.10s:  Let's say in this scenario, I don't know I have no idea what metrics apply to these numbers to be
4440.42s:  honest like what age this would be. If you have any idea for an average maybe what 20. This
4446.74s:  would probably be high for a 25 year old. This would probably be okay. Let's do like a 25 year old.
4455.86s:  I'm just fucking guessing but their savings aren't going to be this. I don't know what a 25 year old
4460.66s:  savings would be maybe $500 a month. Because at that point you should be in like a decent job.
4469.78s:  And we're trying to figure out how long do we have to do this game? How long do I have to keep
4474.02s:  sucking up to a boss that I don't really like or doing things that I don't really like in order to
4478.58s:  make a living and you know escape this rat race? Perfect time to define your objectives.
4486.66s:  So the objective is pretty easy. The objective is financial freedom.
4507.54s:  Okay. So now we have to do some more homework. We need to quantify what that means. And for those
4516.10s:  that are in the outlier trading pairs program when I had you all work on the financial or the
4522.34s:  the money mindset exercise and then the millionaire roadmap. This is where we take the outputs
4528.98s:  from the money mindset exercise. We quantify them and then we create a range. So when we quantify
4535.22s:  it we could say minimum viable threshold. Might be something like 3k a month.
4543.14s:  Optimal might be something like 7k a month depending on where you're at.
4557.22s:  So this is the next requirement is to sit down and do the fucking work. This is where people get
4569.06s:  gummed up. This is why we get stuck with too many choices is because we're sitting here
4574.18s:  letting ideas swirl around all these ideas, all these things that we want to do. But we're not
4578.82s:  taking the time to actually sit down and think about one of them through its entirety to what we
4584.34s:  need. And what you need from the objective of financial freedom is you need to quantify how much
4592.02s:  money you need. That's what you need. So now let's say we feed this input back up into this
4602.18s:  scenario into this person scenario. And we're trying to figure out how can I make 7k per month?
4608.82s:  Okay, guess what's next?
4610.26s:  We do some homework. I got a hype.
4627.30s:  It's literally why I built this calculator. It's because I use it straight up all the time.
4632.58s:  So we have 2500 bucks. We're saving on average 500 per month. Right now we're 25 so we got at
4640.50s:  least 20 years in the in the pipeline. And current rate of return 10%. Let's say that we get like a
4648.66s:  5% variance off of that. And let's see where that places us. Well, that places us in 20 years at
4657.06s:  511 thousand dollars. And if we said that we want 7000 dollars per month, we need to figure out
4663.94s:  what a reasonable rate of return would be required to achieve that. Now let's add that into our model.
4671.94s:  So 7000 dollars per month, we're going to need some sort of return in order to hit that. If we
4677.62s:  think about average market return, it's about 8%. If you're trading and doing this, ideally,
4684.26s:  we're outperforming that, but we want to plan conservatively. So maybe we plan using something
4688.74s:  like 8%, 8% target return. Now we literally just have essentially an equation we need to solve for.
4697.62s:  We need to figure out at what principle amount earning 8% per year gives us 7000 dollars per month.
4710.10s:  And this is how we quantify what we're trying to do. And here's the uncomfortable part about this.
4717.54s:  It's probably going to be a much bigger number than you want to hear, but it doesn't matter.
4723.70s:  This is another really common issue. There we go. Crude oil is dipping again. You guys see that?
4730.34s:  Yeah.
4732.42s:  About time to place a trade, eh?
4735.94s:  So if we take a look at what, 1.25 million, multiply that by 08. That's 100,000 divided by 12,
4744.74s:  gives us 8,300. So it's a little high, maybe 1150 times 0.092 divided by 1276. That's about right.
4755.86s:  So we need essentially 1.5, 0, 0, 0. This is what we need in order for this target.
4771.22s:  So now the question becomes back to our model. How do we get that? Well, I'm 25. I'm going to have
4780.58s:  20 more years. I'm a young professional. I take a look at the comps in my career field.
4787.30s:  And I see what's possible if I continue on the glide slope. If it looks like for the next 20 years,
4793.70s:  it's going to be about what it is now. And I can't save anymore because of whatever reason.
4799.46s:  Maybe I need to look at expanding my timeline a little bit.
4803.14s:  So instead of being able to pull the plug at 20 years, might have to do another 10.
4809.22s:  If those other things aren't possible. If those other things are possible,
4815.30s:  and we find that we're able to maybe expand our savings to try to salvage this time,
4825.14s:  this runway of 20%. And let's say that for the first five years, we expect it to be $500
4833.30s:  per month up until we're 30. Then for the next 10 years after that, we expect it to be $750 per month
4840.02s:  or whatever the math ends up working out based on the duration. Again, you can get as specific as
4846.26s:  you want. So then we can say so for year one, two, three, four, five. And I did six just because,
4853.70s:  you know, overachiever. And we go down here to 20. And for the first five, we think we're going to
4858.90s:  be able to save 500. What I'm doing is I'm literally just creating a weighted average of the
4864.02s:  savings amounts over the expected durations. So then the next 10 years, I think it'll,
4870.42s:  maybe the next five years, I think it'll average out to $750. Then might drop a kid, you know,
4877.06s:  go go for the album. And this might drop again to 500. And then at this point, I'm a pretty
4883.22s:  seasoned professional should be able to leverage my experience. And then this is what I think I should
4890.02s:  be able to save. So this, we now can sum this up. This is over a 20 year horizon. And on a
4904.66s:  per monthly basis, by the way, so it comes out to six, 87 and a half.
4916.10s:  So this becomes terminal. What we think we can do, six, 40, no good. So now we have some more
4923.22s:  choices. We have more things to look at. Again, one, we can extend the timeline. This is the worst case
4928.26s:  scenario. So based on this timeline, it looks like it'll probably be not, didn't mean that.
4934.90s:  It'll be about 26 years in the worst case scenario based on current balance,
4945.46s:  steady contributions that we've accounted for over the next 20 years on average,
4950.58s:  using a current expected return of 10% and cool. Then we can take a look at different return
4960.26s:  profiles. Maybe instead of 10%, we become good at trading. Maybe we can instead of 10% on
4967.30s:  average per year, we can earn 15. Well, if I take a look at 15%, where do I see that crossover
4975.22s:  for 1.1 million? I see it the 15 handle that occur here at year 20. So if I can hit that 15%
4987.46s:  return per year, maintain that for 20 years, along with the rest of the metrics from a savings
4994.18s:  perspective, I can cut six years off of this. So this is the broader planning perspective. I don't
4999.70s:  want to get too gummed up here because we don't have too much longer. But I'm giving you a
5004.50s:  literally specific example on how to actually build the goals that feed into this broader process.
5013.14s:  That's what that is. So we define our objectives, we quantify them, and then we actually have
5020.66s:  something to plan off of. From a trading perspective, now we have answers. From a trading
5029.78s:  perspective, we now know how much money we need to make on average per month in order to earn that
5034.98s:  10% or that 15% whatever the target is. So then we start from core principles. We don't
5043.06s:  worry about what ticker to trade. We don't worry about what expiration is best. We start with
5049.54s:  profit mechanisms. We start with how things actually make money. And then we steadily dial in from
5060.50s:  there. So from a choices perspective for our goals, we first need to start with building out whatever
5072.02s:  our targets are. From there, we need to figure out how do we hit those targets with respect to
5078.58s:  the actual skill set of trading. I think a great initial starting point is to pick a bullish,
5086.98s:  bearish, and neutrally direction, directionally neutral trading strategy to be able to essentially
5094.74s:  trade all directions. I think that's a great starting point. You can choose another starting point.
5101.54s:  You can choose to just try to be a day trader and to just trade a certain thing every day and
5106.74s:  see if that works for you. The point here is to pick a few things. How do we pick a few things and
5115.38s:  think that we're not wasting our time? This goes back to not reinventing the wheel.
5122.02s:  We have to, the reason why people bounce between day trading, swing trading, this other kind of
5127.06s:  trading that has another weird name and all of these other kinds of things is because there's no
5133.06s:  confidence in the actual strategy that's being ran. How do we develop that confidence? The way we
5140.02s:  develop that confidence is by starting with things that we know work and exist. Market exhibits
5147.94s:  positive drift. I just told you what the average market return is per year. Why is it that the
5156.02s:  average market return per year 8 to 12% depending on the time frame is what it is. But then so many
5162.66s:  traders can't be greater than fucking zero. Why is that? It's because the trader thinks they're
5169.78s:  better than that. They think, well, if I'm going to waste the time doing this, I should get a better
5174.50s:  return than that. That's a completely viable goal in the long term, but you're not better than
5179.70s:  that in the beginning. The market return is a great starting point because we know it's there and
5184.34s:  we know it's persistent. Then you can start building off of that if you're so inclined.
5191.22s:  But the market return is a great place to start. Whether you choose to expose yourself to that
5196.02s:  through direct beta, buying an index ETF, and then slightly optimizing it through a coverage
5200.90s:  triangle, or maybe you start to take a little bit more beta to get a better return and trade
5205.30s:  a leverage ETF. But that's a perfectly rational starting point. The thing is, is everybody's trying
5213.94s:  to find the super secret silver bullet that's going to make them a bunch of money super fast.
5220.26s:  It might exist, but it's going to take some time to find it. If you waste less time in the
5225.14s:  beginning, you'll be far better off for it. Then that blends us into the last two things. We now
5234.34s:  know what we're doing. We have our number that we need to hit. We have our reference time frames,
5242.58s:  26 years in a slower pace, quicker pace, could be something like 20 years if we're able to hit a
5250.02s:  15% return. So now we have a range that we can work in. We now know what we need to make on a
5256.26s:  monthly basis because we can reverse engineer where we are today compared to where we're trying to
5263.06s:  go in that 20 year time frame. We now know exactly what return we need, which is 15% if we want to
5269.78s:  hit it in 20 years. The next question is, how do we get 15% per year? We start by looking at known
5278.18s:  effects that have already been around and they're quantifiable. And we say, can I make this slightly
5285.14s:  better? Rather than buying hold, which will have really big down years, can I make this just
5290.66s:  marginally better? Maybe I don't have to have the same draw downs than the market. That can
5296.82s:  accelerate it quite a lot for me, actually. So we start there. Notice how this starts peeling away,
5304.74s:  analysis paralysis. This starts adding a lot of specificity to the complexity that exists
5312.34s:  because there is a defined path that we're trying to take that starts slow and then can ramp over time.
5322.50s:  The reason why this starts slow using a market return or something like that is because it's
5328.10s:  accessible and it's what you get essentially for doing nothing but taking the risk. You can use
5333.62s:  that as a planning factor. Then while you're looking to optimize or slightly enhance your market
5341.38s:  risk, then you can start tinkering with different ideas. You can be paper trading in the
5344.82s:  background. You can live test ideas and you can see maybe there's other things you can monetize.
5350.50s:  But the reason why you don't stick to those other things in the beginnings because you don't know
5354.10s:  if they fucking work because you haven't done anything to figure out if they work. So then you're
5358.82s:  just bouncing between things because there's zero confidence in any of them and you're hoping
5363.62s:  that something sticks. That does not work. Sorry, it is what it is. The sooner people can get over
5371.86s:  these kinds of details, the sooner you can start making meaningful strides in what you're trying
5378.90s:  to do as a trader. So now the next step in what we're going to do in the case study tomorrow is to
5387.70s:  add the actual structure around all of these concepts. We're going to start from a starting point.
5394.58s:  We'll pick whatever it is. We'll figure out what our objective is. We'll make it relevant to
5399.70s:  the people on the stream. And then we will literally get specific. We'll say, okay, how do we gain
5405.22s:  the market beta to start? What would make sense? How do we slightly optimize the market beta? What
5409.46s:  makes sense? What should we be doing in tandem while trying to optimize this market beta? How do we
5415.14s:  efficiently test ideas on the side, meaning as your main portfolio is working, how do we efficiently
5421.38s:  test ideas so that we're not bouncing all over the place? That's the next step. That's how you take
5427.70s:  these concepts and you build them out into something that is truly scalable and sustainable.
5437.62s:  What's not sustainable is randomly bouncing around, hoping that something is going to work.
5445.06s:  And if you don't know upfront what might work, you're already starting the game on hard mode.
5453.54s:  We already know what works. You can see it. You can see research about it. Momentum works.
5462.58s:  Post earnings announcement drift works. Market beta works. And if you don't like these ones because
5469.86s:  the returns aren't good enough for you, then guess what? You need to figure out something else that
5475.38s:  works better. Do that work then. If you don't know what else works and you're not sure what a start,
5481.70s:  guess what? You're not too good for these other effects that we know work. You're not too good for
5490.42s:  you can start there and then you could build your skill set as you grow.
5495.22s:  This is how we get through this overwhelmed stage where we're scared. We don't know what to do next.
5504.58s:  This is exactly the core concepts to apply to that. And then tomorrow we'll go through again,
5511.30s:  like the broader case study. But before we hop off, I want to see if there's any specific questions
5517.62s:  on what we talked about. Any areas that we are not clear on, I want to make sure that if you're
5524.50s:  going to try to do this exercise on your own, that you feel comfortable with what you want to try
5530.10s:  to do so that it at least makes sense. EHODGE says get nine streams revenue so you can save and
5538.26s:  study at the same time. Honestly, joking aside, if you look at the the millionaire roadmap,
5546.66s:  and if you look at the broader approach that I talk about taking to do this, like the
5553.22s:  actual path to become a millionaire, there's three primary levers you get to pull on.
5562.90s:  The first lever is your savings rate, meaning how much of your income are you saving.
5568.58s:  The second is your income. How much money do you make? How can you make it better?
5573.70s:  The third is your investing returns. How good are you at trading and investing to amplify the
5581.86s:  annual returns? The problem that people run into is that when we look at these things, they
5587.22s:  start to identify that there are actually some really difficult concessions that have to be made
5591.46s:  and more uncomfortable with that. Right? We don't want to wait 26 years. That's too long.
5596.26s:  Guess what, bitch? Get better. Make more money. Do something else. Well, I don't want to go back
5600.98s:  to school. That's annoying to make more money. Okay, bitch. Then wait 26 years. I still
5607.06s:  don't want to do that. That's a little bit too long. Okay, bitch. Get better at trading then.
5612.02s:  Well, I'm difficult. I really don't want to spend that much time on it. I really want to have
5617.30s:  my freedom. I don't want to be in front of a screen. This is what people do. This is the exact
5622.02s:  dialogue people have with themselves because they are trying to just build something that is purely
5628.58s:  optimal for them, not accepting the fact that in order to do this whole thing, it takes them
5633.30s:  compromise. So figure out the compromise. Be comfortable with it. If you can do that,
5640.34s:  that's why there's so much opportunity here. That's why for something that requires no education,
5645.54s:  it requires no certification. Literally can make more than doctors, lawyers, business owners. It
5651.46s:  literally can make more than all of these different things. There has to be a cost associated.
5658.58s:  This is the cost. So embrace that cost because most people don't. Most people wash out.
5664.34s:  Then that's why the opportunity is still there for you. Be thankful. It's difficult.
5670.26s:  I try to remind people of that exact concept. If this was not difficult, the opportunity
5674.98s:  would not be there. It would be priced out. The fact that it's difficult, you should be thankful for.
5680.82s:  I'm thankful for that. Plus also admittedly, it's kind of easy for me now. So
5686.02s:  it's easy for me to say that. Sorry. Oh, Lauren just hooked up five people with outlier trading
5694.82s:  memberships. Thank you so much, Lauren. We're hooking some people up and supporting the channel.
5699.86s:  We very much appreciate it. If you guys need anything, let me know. Hit me up. Be an outlier. I'm
5706.34s:  going to go feed Thor. See you all later.
