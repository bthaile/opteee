0.40s: what's up you guys this one's all about
2.20s: gme because it's kind of quiet out there
5.24s: so should be a relatively quick video
7.52s: just keeping the Cadence up taking a
9.28s: look at what's happening on a daily
10.80s: basis here so what did we see today well
13.96s: ended at
15.84s: 2550 up
17.96s: 1.11% on the day and we are in this
23.64s: consolidation section in here you could
25.84s: tell it is
27.64s: about as narrow as you can get we're
30.88s: range bound between 2570 and to the
34.04s: downside on the closes opens 2475 so
37.16s: like a buck we are just below the point
40.40s: of control and all this means to me is
43.08s: that a lot of people are still willing
44.44s: to transact here there's a lot of both
47.80s: buying and selling when we look at the
49.24s: overall average volume though it's
50.72s: pretty quiet it's below the 1 month
53.44s: average VA today has been the quietest
55.92s: it's been since it looks like
60.56s: looks like pre
62.60s: squeeze this might be close what was the
65.52s: volume here
67.68s: 9.5 to 7.7 yeah so this is the quietest
71.32s: been essentially since we saw this uh
73.72s: pop way back here in the beginning or in
76.12s: the middle of May I should say so quiet
80.64s: day out there moving averages are all
82.16s: starting to look flat and yeah I mean
85.84s: for me the way I'm looking at it right
87.48s: now I have no options out on the
88.92s: position and that's just because it's
90.48s: not really moving a whole lot but I do
93.80s: have shares on the position I actually
96.08s: just added some more shares the primary
98.64s: reason for that is just complimenting a
100.48s: little bit of the broader portfolio and
103.40s: specifically with this position I do
106.32s: have some short options out against it
108.76s: 90 days out for a couple different
111.12s: reasons but it's mostly to provide a bit
114.20s: of a short-term Tailwind in case we do
117.04s: get a pullback so this is not so much is
120.72s: so some sort of theta Decay play it's
122.56s: definitely much more of a downside hedge
124.76s: if needed and it guarantees a decent
129.00s: profit with where we're at right now but
133.08s: those will be managed more likely than
135.04s: not on either a pullback or they'll be
137.60s: moved out as we get closer in time so
140.04s: typically when I'm selling options
141.48s: especially like short calls against long
144.64s: Deltas whether it's long calls or long
146.28s: shares I like to be a little bit closer
148.08s: in time but I'm planning on playing both
151.32s: of these expiration Cycles when I start
153.12s: to see just a little bit more movement
156.28s: so that's why I'm moving these further
158.04s: out it fits the broader picture just a
160.60s: little bit better now overall volume
162.92s: today was very light we had 118,000
165.52s: calls trade uh looks like my strangle
169.00s: expired out of the money that's great
171.68s: news and we had the put side at
177.16s: 26,800 so very very quiet across Ross
180.04s: the board now when I look at the
182.32s: existing open interest this is still
184.72s: narrower than it's been historically
187.24s: calls 691 th000 against 384,000 puts so
192.56s: not a ton that I'm seeing there
195.32s: volatility is super low this is we
198.32s: haven't seen this front expiration below
200.68s: 100 for a hot minute and it's not above
204.32s: 100 until we get to the 16 a expiration
206.68s: so again I already talked about this the
208.80s: last couple days that it just seems like
210.36s: we're coming into a bit of a quiet
213.00s: period at least based on what I can see
214.84s: from the options markets and this
217.24s: continues to seemingly confirm that the
220.24s: other thing is take a look at the number
221.76s: of calls being sold here 34% of the
224.80s: volume today was sold calls I was part
227.84s: of that but I for people like me we're
230.56s: just looking at a way to take in a
232.16s: little bit of Premium the downside is
234.32s: it's not even really that sweet to the
236.68s: upside when I say that sweet in this
239.00s: context it's just kind of a cheeky way
242.16s: of saying expensive
244.12s: call
245.64s: options like these you you guys have
248.84s: seen me look at these enough by now look
250.40s: look how crazy these are this front
253.56s: exploration is all over the map and I
257.04s: find that very interesting we haven't
259.04s: seen this low of a ratio of calls side
261.36s: to
262.20s: putside in a really long time and then
266.08s: out here in the 16 all you can see the
269.00s: 120s are really being bit up pretty
272.00s: heavy but pretty much everything from
275.04s: like the 95s to the 115s they're really
278.52s: really suppressed so another opportunity
281.24s: down in here you can there you
285.84s: go just in case you wanted to see it a
288.04s: lot of people they get upset when they
289.20s: can't see the whole thing I'm looking at
290.44s: which I get so I'll get my fat head out
293.00s: of your way but yeah the the V curve
296.72s: here is interesting but mostly what I'm
299.96s: seeing across the board in this is stuff
303.24s: just quieting down that's overall what
306.04s: it looks like when I take a look at
308.12s: trades in this case I'm filtering by
310.24s: stuff that at least has 50 contracts I
313.28s: don't care if it's call or puts but you
316.12s: can see the overall sizes trading are
319.28s: small and the relative value of a lot of
321.92s: these is also very small right so we
324.12s: have 485 but these are 47 cents we had
327.60s: 372 of these 252 calls that were bought
331.36s: but there is 61 cents so like these
333.48s: aren't a lot of like really high
335.40s: conviction style trades there's a lot of
338.28s: Premium selling going on that I can see
340.40s: and then when we take a quick look here
343.52s: at our options flow from unusual wheels
348.44s: just kind of Aggregates this a little
350.08s: more cleanly for you guys looking at the
352.96s: call side on purchased calls everything
355.52s: is below $100,000 this is again one of
358.16s: the most quiet days that I've seen since
361.04s: if I look on the sales side again very
363.96s: very quiet all across the board now if
368.56s: we add quickly the put side
371.04s: in drop these calls out super quiet all
375.24s: below $100,000 and then on the purchase
378.28s: side also all below $100,000 so what I'm
381.64s: highlighting is we are coming into a bit
384.52s: of a quiet period it would seem and with
387.76s: something like GameStop you never know
389.20s: if it's actually quiet or if it's
391.04s: temporary quiet about to get real loud
393.40s: we do not know and I do think now's an
396.16s: interesting time to start looking at the
397.72s: positions that you have make sure that
399.04s: you have the exposure you want because a
401.16s: lot of times you can see something in
402.68s: here and you're like man it looks kind
403.84s: of boring and sometimes that's a good
406.04s: time to reconfigure your exposure
409.40s: because if you start trying to get long
411.80s: when things are up here it's much more
413.56s: difficult and your risk is much higher
415.28s: whereas if you're adjusting when we're
418.04s: down just hovering in these really
420.00s: Consolidated levels it's a little bit of
422.12s: a different story I set a bunch of
424.40s: different stops for me to phase out of
426.80s: my positions that's essentially what all
429.00s: these different alerts are to get me out
432.16s: when I don't want to hold when things
433.92s: aren't moving my Direction so take a
436.76s: look at what you got and as always if
439.32s: you have any questions or anything you
440.40s: want me to take a look at let me know I
442.04s: am here for it be an outlier I'll see
443.76s: you guys later
