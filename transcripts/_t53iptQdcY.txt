 What's up, outliers? Let's talk about how to literally revolutionize your trading with reframing the way that we think about how we're placing positions. We're going to talk about profit mechanisms. This is just a framework in a way of thinking that I've developed over my last 18 years in the markets. Nothing you're going to see here is novel, revolutionary, secret proprietary. This is all just basic stuff that most of you probably have bits and pieces, but I want to show you how in my brain I pull all of this together to make smarter trades that make more money. So what's up, outliers? Let's get into why you should care about what we're about to talk about. So first, let's start with a scenario. And we have to start with the basic understanding that our performance as traders is literally a reflection of what our skill level is and what our strategies produce over time. The reason why this is important to note is because if we get into this very first scenario and we have a trader that is built a strategy that's designed to profit from expanding volatility and they choose to buy a call, then the trade makes money. So in this case, we don't know yet if the stock went up or a volatility expanded, but at this point, most traders are happy with the scenario because they made money. What's the rub? So the question we have to ask ourselves is do I care if I made money because volatility went up or because price went up? And the answer to any discerning trader is absolutely if I built a strategy that's designed to make money from expanding volatility. And in this scenario, I happened to make money because price happened to move in my favor. That is pivotal information because it informs how my strategy performs. In this example, just because price went up, that actually could mean that the volatility in this trade contracted. So it means based on my idea, I was actually wrong, but I made money because the stock went up. So the reason why this is so important is because traders that are happy with making money regardless of the way that they made money when they're building an options trade, they're not going to be around for very long because they're going to think, oh, wow, this worked. Let me do more of this. Let me scale this up. Meanwhile, the actual idea that they were trying to express literally was wrong. It's dangerous. So now let's talk about what the hell a profit mechanism is. So for those that are familiar with the video that I did a while ago about the outlier strategy process, again, this is just a way of thinking. There's nothing novel here. But the very first step of this is understanding and identifying profit mechanisms. So if we look at this more broadly and how this fits into the scope of things, profit mechanisms lead into the way that we analyze things, the way that we match fitting option structures. And then ultimately, the way that we build strategies that can take the most advantage of the profit mechanism. So we're going to talk about this more in detail. So let's now get into examples of profit mechanism and profit mechanism types. The idea behind this is I want to give you some context on how you can integrate this into what you do as a trader. So let's start with some basics. The first one we have here is price direction up. This is pretty straightforward. This means if we're looking at a stock and it goes up, we make money. So if we pop over to a chart, this is an on demand. This is looking back in time, looking at so far. But price direction up, something goes up, it makes money really, really straightforward, right? However, you will notice that there are different magnitudes, different behaviors that things go up. So what are the types of price direction up profit mechanisms? Simple. We have things like breakouts. We have things like drift, momentum, value investing. We have things like mergers and acquisitions. We have things that are news driven. Maybe there is a new piece of information related to a company. They have a new product launch that then causes price to move. We have to think about each of these separately over time because the way that we might trade something like example value compared to breakout is very different. Now, in this example, you might be able to make money in either scenario if you buy a call that's, maybe it's a leaps, something that's longer than a year. You can make money in either scenario, but you can maximize how much money you make if you differ between these. So another example here would be something like price direction down. So these are trading things like breakdowns, things with negative drift, negative momentum, news driven. A great example of a news driven downside trade is if we pop over the platform, this is still back in time, but I think this will be in here, which was crouch strike. And if we take a look, funny enough, it's right around the time frame we're going to use for the example later. And this is when they had that systems issue that caused a lot of problems. That's a news driven event that ended up causing crouch strike to crater, understanding how news can impact stocks again leads to different kinds of tradable ideas. Now different kinds of profit mechanisms at a high level, volatility expansion, volatility contracting, transitory volatility, meaning as it's moving between clustering, variance risk premiums, which is the prevalence for volatility, implied volatility to trend elevated compared to historic volatility, especially in indices, especially on the put side. The fact that there's typically more volatility on the put side than the call side, different market inefficiencies as in how quick it takes things to be priced in. There are all different kinds of profit mechanisms that exist. And if you're curious about how to find some of these, you can just go into SSRN and research, come up with just some basic key terms stock market, stock market profit and breakouts, momentum value, you come up with all these different terms and look at what research is existing. You don't have to reinvent the wheel here. Then you can take some time to understand some of these different subtypes because for example, again, the way that I trade a breakout is different than the way that I trade something like momentum. And I want to show you that concept now, but a quick recap on what you know so far that being correct on a trade, meaning it's made money is not good enough. You have to also be correct and able to track your ability to be correct with respect to the actual profit mechanism you're trying to profit from. There are all different kinds of profit mechanisms and then all different kinds of profit mechanism types. The reason behind breaking things down this way is so that you can more accurately identify what you're making money from. This is a really important function. So now let's get into an example of how to actually integrate this whole thing into a process. And it's also pretty simple. Now let's start with the price direction up profit mechanism, meaning we make something, we make money as something goes up. And for the example that we're looking at, we're going to eyeball a breakout. The qualities associated with breakouts, you have to look at them for yourself and see what you find. Now to give you some, you know, I guess read ahead notes on what you will find. This is from my analysis of this specific profit mechanism and type. You'll notice that I tend to see things like consolidation with contracting volatility before we come into some sort of catalyst, whether it's news driven, really solid earnings release, something like that. And then we normally will see aggressive price movement relative to recent price movement. We'll see volume expand. We'll see moving averages steep and now we'll see oscillators start to turn over. And again, I'll show you an example of all of this. Now how do I know all of these things about it? Because I looked for tons of references of breakouts. Now this is something you can code and look at it within Python if you're interested. Or you can literally just go into a chart and see what you see. Now this is a great example of a break down. So this becomes an analysis point. We can come up with things like, well, I wonder how far this move was. Well, it opened here and it ran all the way down to here. So this represents a 47% drop in price for this specific stock. How normal is that? Well, I can open up a Google sheet and track this moving crowd strike. And I can analyze hundreds and thousands of these so that I now understand the tendencies for these kinds of moves on what to expect. This is important to do. And again, as always, if I'm saying these things and you're like, man, that sounds like a lot of work. No shit. Welcome to trading. This isn't free money. Get over it. Now let's continue with this example. After we figure out the profit mechanism, we identify the type. We start outlining different qualities from us being able to eyeball it. We look at charts. We look at broad research that already exists. Then we start just thinking of different signals that can help us find and measure the profit mechanism and the type. So for something like breakouts, we might use things like standard deviation channels. We might use price action. We might use moving averages. We might use the moving average slope, the width between them price relative to the moving averages. We might look at RSI. I like to use RSI with a seven day VWOT moving average. We might look at the prior earnings release data. We might look at price movements specifically with respect to this contracting behavior as it's consolidating. We might look at average volume, volume, profile, so on and so forth. These are things I look at actually specific to this one. But for this signal section, you just have to jot down ideas based on what you saw as you looked at it. So notice the way we come up with this is by taking the time to actually look at it. Then you can come up with ideas. Now finally, we outline different structures that we might use to help capture this. And let's use an example for this breakout concept. The question we might say is, well, do we want to sell puts or buy calls? What delta, what days to expiration, so on and so forth? So how do we answer this? How do we figure out if I want to sell puts or buy calls? Well, let's now look at an example. Let's go back to what we were looking at, which was so far. And we can see that this is following some of the broader tendencies related to that, not perfectly so, but some of them. And we can see that there's this light consolidation, although volume and overall size of the candles so average daily range was expanding in here. The reason why that matters is because that actually violates a little bit what we might expect to see. But these different traits, they're not universal and absolute. They're traits to look for. But really what I'm looking for here, and we're back in time right now. We're back in October of last year. What I'm looking for is price behavior relative to this near term price action. And then I'm trying to eyeball for a breakout. So let's say that we finally see that breakout. We see that there's a big volume node here. And we start to say to ourselves, if price really breaks above this level that we draw, we're going to consider it a breakout and trade it. Well, what does that mean? Well, now I need to decide between two different positions. I can either buy some calls or I can sell some puts. So the way I look at it, if you follow something like my ratio call diagonal strategy, which I'll throw a link to below for an entire playlist on it, you already know the kind of things I'm going to eyeball. I'm going to go out maybe 90 days or so. I'm going to look for something that's close to at the money, maybe one strike in the money. And let's analyze this as if this is a hundred thousand dollar account. And what that means is I'm going to size my loss at a point that's maybe a percent for a hundred thousand dollar account for this kind of trade again, based on understanding the profit mechanism and type were wrong a lot. So I'm actually going to size it down a little bit than whatever my standard risk control might be. So again, if we're using a one percent, maybe I'll go a little bit under that. So I'm going to size it so that I can place a 30 lot of the nine 17, Jean 25s. And get them for a dollar seven and at my exit point of eight 50, why eight 50? Because again, based on my research and understanding of this profit mechanism and type and corresponding signals that fall below, if it falls below this level, I'm just wrong. So it means my idea was wrong. It's time for me to get out. The reason why it's so tight is because it reduces the total risk and it's forcing me to be correct. If I'm wrong, that's okay. I want to be wrong. Quick. So if we go back into this and we're looking at this call scenario, we can see what our PNL might be. So let's say if we get a 15% move, we would make $2,600 and we lose 752, essentially, if it drops 5%. So this place is a really high premium on being correct in terms of our directional analysis. Let's comparatively look at this again, selling puts. For selling puts, we might do something that's like 35 days to expiration in this example. We're using the 26 delta, so the first strike at the money. So let's take a look at what we can make here, sizing it the same so that we lose the same amount of money if it falls to 850 and we take our exit. Because again, based on the profit mechanism and the type and signal, it's not dependent on whether I sell calls or I'm sorry, sell puts or buy calls. The way I exit this trade and manage the risk is by being directionally wrong. And that's the risk side of the equation. That's what I'm managing for it here. So if I size it to be about the same, I can put on a 50 lot of the eight puts out in 15 no. My max profit is 1600 bucks. So if I get that same 15% move, I make $1,000. So we can already see a difference based on these and based on what I expect to see. I already told you what this tends to look like, which is more aggressive price movement. So now let's fast forward a month and see all these perform. I'm going to go to the eighth of November and let's just compare them quickly and see how they do. So if we fast forward this as well, which is part of on demand, we have to make sure we're capturing the full profit potential. So if we take a look at this on our short put side, we make just about max profit because we're cherry picking a scenario here, but the stock goes up. It's still loading, but it does go up. So we can see that the stock actually rallies up. Now it's at like 1293. We're at like near max profit on these short puts. That's great. That's a fantastic outcome for this scenario. If we take a look at the call equivalent, you'll see that we're sitting at a profit of $8,000. What's the difference here? Well, based on what I expected to see, how I expected the price to behave and move, this was a more fitting strategy based on the idea to capture this kind of upside potential. So this goes all the way back. Why do you care about profit mechanisms? Because if you sold the put, you left so much on the table because you didn't take the time to understand the nuances of the profit mechanism and type that you're trying to trade. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. You're not there. I'll see you later.
