0.00s:  What's up, outliers?
1.64s:  Let's talk about how to literally revolutionize your trading with reframing the way that we
7.44s:  think about how we're placing positions.
9.72s:  We're going to talk about profit mechanisms.
12.12s:  This is just a framework in a way of thinking that I've developed over my last 18 years
18.48s:  in the markets.
20.56s:  Nothing you're going to see here is novel, revolutionary, secret proprietary.
25.04s:  This is all just basic stuff that most of you probably have bits and pieces, but I want
31.20s:  to show you how in my brain I pull all of this together to make smarter trades that make
37.68s:  more money.
39.00s:  So what's up, outliers?
40.96s:  Let's get into why you should care about what we're about to talk about.
46.72s:  So first, let's start with a scenario.
51.08s:  And we have to start with the basic understanding that our performance as traders is literally
56.40s:  a reflection of what our skill level is and what our strategies produce over time.
64.56s:  The reason why this is important to note is because if we get into this very first
69.16s:  scenario and we have a trader that is built a strategy that's designed to profit from
75.88s:  expanding volatility and they choose to buy a call, then the trade makes money.
84.48s:  So in this case, we don't know yet if the stock went up or a volatility expanded, but
90.48s:  at this point, most traders are happy with the scenario because they made money.
99.08s:  What's the rub?
100.40s:  So the question we have to ask ourselves is do I care if I made money because volatility
106.88s:  went up or because price went up?
110.24s:  And the answer to any discerning trader is absolutely if I built a strategy that's designed
119.72s:  to make money from expanding volatility.
123.12s:  And in this scenario, I happened to make money because price happened to move in my favor.
131.60s:  That is pivotal information because it informs how my strategy performs.
138.76s:  In this example, just because price went up, that actually could mean that the volatility
145.00s:  in this trade contracted.
147.00s:  So it means based on my idea, I was actually wrong, but I made money because the stock went
153.52s:  up.
154.52s:  So the reason why this is so important is because traders that are happy with making money
158.60s:  regardless of the way that they made money when they're building an options trade, they're
162.32s:  not going to be around for very long because they're going to think, oh, wow, this worked.
166.32s:  Let me do more of this.
167.32s:  Let me scale this up.
169.28s:  Meanwhile, the actual idea that they were trying to express literally was wrong.
175.40s:  That's dangerous.
177.48s:  So now let's talk about what the hell a profit mechanism is.
184.56s:  So for those that are familiar with the video that I did a while ago about the outlier
189.36s:  strategy process, again, this is just a way of thinking.
192.72s:  There's nothing novel here.
194.32s:  But the very first step of this is understanding and identifying profit mechanisms.
203.48s:  So if we look at this more broadly and how this fits into the scope of things, profit
208.20s:  mechanisms lead into the way that we analyze things, the way that we match fitting option
216.80s:  structures.
217.80s:  And then ultimately, the way that we build strategies that can take the most advantage of the
223.76s:  profit mechanism.
225.28s:  So we're going to talk about this more in detail.
228.00s:  So let's now get into examples of profit mechanism and profit mechanism types.
236.88s:  The idea behind this is I want to give you some context on how you can integrate this
242.00s:  into what you do as a trader.
245.20s:  So let's start with some basics.
248.32s:  The first one we have here is price direction up.
252.12s:  This is pretty straightforward.
253.76s:  This means if we're looking at a stock and it goes up, we make money.
258.08s:  So if we pop over to a chart, this is an on demand.
261.68s:  This is looking back in time, looking at so far.
264.16s:  But price direction up, something goes up, it makes money really, really straightforward,
268.32s:  right?
269.32s:  However, you will notice that there are different magnitudes, different behaviors that
274.16s:  things go up.
276.56s:  So what are the types of price direction up profit mechanisms?
281.56s:  Simple.
282.56s:  We have things like breakouts.
284.44s:  We have things like drift, momentum, value investing.
288.44s:  We have things like mergers and acquisitions.
290.32s:  We have things that are news driven.
292.48s:  Maybe there is a new piece of information related to a company.
295.88s:  They have a new product launch that then causes price to move.
300.48s:  We have to think about each of these separately over time because the way that we might trade
306.28s:  something like example value compared to breakout is very different.
312.76s:  Now, in this example, you might be able to make money in either scenario if you buy a
317.88s:  call that's, maybe it's a leaps, something that's longer than a year.
322.16s:  You can make money in either scenario, but you can maximize how much money you make if
326.84s:  you differ between these.
329.28s:  So another example here would be something like price direction down.
334.20s:  So these are trading things like breakdowns, things with negative drift, negative momentum,
337.88s:  news driven, a great example of a news driven downside trade is if we pop over the platform.
343.40s:  This is still back in time, but I think this will be in here, which was crowd strike.
349.08s:  And if we take a look, funny enough, it's right around the time frame we're going to use
352.24s:  for the example later.
353.96s:  And this is when they had that systems issue that caused a lot of problems.
358.68s:  That's a news driven event that ended up causing crowd strike to crater, understanding
365.04s:  how news can impact stocks again leads to different kinds of tradable ideas.
371.44s:  Now different kinds of profit mechanisms at a high level, volatility expansion, volatility
377.20s:  contracting, transitory volatility, meaning as it's moving between clustering, variance
382.32s:  risk premiums, which is the prevalence for volatility, implied volatility to trend
386.92s:  elevated compared to historic volatility, especially in indices, especially on the
391.16s:  put side.
392.16s:  The fact that there's typically more volatility on the put side than the call side, different
396.56s:  market inefficiencies as in how quick it takes things to be priced in.
401.52s:  There are all different kinds of profit mechanisms that exist.
405.28s:  And if you're curious about how to find some of these, you can just go into SSRN and research,
412.20s:  come up with just some basic key terms stock market, stock market profit and breakouts,
419.68s:  momentum value, come up with all these different terms.
422.36s:  And look at what research is existing.
425.20s:  You don't have to reinvent the wheel here.
427.56s:  Then you can take some time to understand some of these different subtypes.
432.60s:  Because for example, again, the way that I trade a breakout is different than the way
437.04s:  that I trade something like momentum.
439.20s:  And I want to show you that concept now, but a quick recap on what you know so far,
445.84s:  that being correct on a trade, meaning it's made money, is not good enough.
451.28s:  You have to also be correct and able to track your ability to be correct with respect
456.88s:  to the actual profit mechanism you're trying to profit from.
460.12s:  There are all different kinds of profit mechanisms and then all different kinds of profit mechanism
464.92s:  types.
465.92s:  The reason behind breaking things down this way is so that you can more accurately identify
473.36s:  what you're making money from.
475.88s:  This is a really important function.
478.24s:  So now let's get into an example of how to actually integrate this whole thing into a
483.24s:  process.
484.56s:  And it's also pretty simple.
486.16s:  Now let's start with the price direction up profit mechanism, meaning we make money
492.28s:  as something goes up.
493.84s:  And for the example that we're looking at, we're going to eyeball a breakout.
498.84s:  The qualities associated with breakouts, you have to look at them for yourself and see
505.40s:  what you find.
506.88s:  Now to give you some, you know, I guess read ahead notes on what you will find.
513.16s:  This is from my analysis of this specific profit mechanism and type.
519.40s:  You'll notice that I tend to see things like consolidation with contracting volatility
525.00s:  before we come into some sort of catalyst, whether it's news driven, really solid earnings
530.68s:  release, something like that.
533.36s:  And then we normally will see aggressive price movement relative to recent price movement.
539.60s:  We'll see volume expand.
540.92s:  We'll see moving averages steep and now we'll see oscillators start to turn over.
545.32s:  And again, I'll show you an example of all of this.
547.84s:  Now how do I know all of these things about it?
550.08s:  Because I looked for tons of references of breakouts.
554.92s:  Now this is something you can code and look at it within Python if you're interested.
559.80s:  Or you can literally just go into a chart and see what you see.
564.56s:  Now this is a great example of a break down.
567.56s:  So this becomes an analysis point.
569.72s:  We can come up with things like, well, I wonder how far this move was.
573.52s:  Well, it opened here and it ran all the way down to here.
576.96s:  So this represents a 47% drop in price for this specific stock.
581.96s:  How normal is that?
582.96s:  Well, I can open up a Google sheet and track this moving crowd strike.
587.96s:  And I can analyze hundreds and thousands of these so that I now understand the tendencies
595.52s:  for these kinds of moves on what to expect.
597.64s:  This is important to do.
599.32s:  And again, as always, if I'm saying these things and you're like, man, that sounds like
602.44s:  a lot of work.
603.96s:  No shit.
605.84s:  Welcome to trading.
606.84s:  This isn't free money.
608.68s:  Get over it.
610.00s:  Now let's continue with this example.
614.00s:  After we figure out the profit mechanism, we identify the type.
617.76s:  We start outlining different qualities from us being able to eyeball it.
621.44s:  We look at charts.
622.44s:  We look at broad research that already exists.
625.36s:  Then we start just thinking of different signals that can help us find and measure the
631.64s:  profit mechanism and the type.
634.08s:  So for something like breakouts, we might use things like standard deviation channels.
638.24s:  We might use price action.
640.04s:  We might use moving averages.
641.64s:  We might use the moving average slope, the width between them price relative to the moving
647.08s:  averages.
648.08s:  We might look at RSI.
649.08s:  I like to use RSI with a seven day VWOT moving average.
652.68s:  We might look at the prior earnings release data.
654.88s:  We might look at price movements specifically with respect to this contracting behavior as
661.04s:  it's consolidating.
662.04s:  We might look at average volume, volume, profile, so on and so forth.
665.72s:  These are things I look at actually specific to this one.
668.32s:  But for this signal section, you just have to jot down ideas based on what you saw as
674.04s:  you looked at it.
675.16s:  So notice the way we come up with this is by taking the time to actually look at it.
680.72s:  Then you can come up with ideas.
682.60s:  Now finally, we outline different structures that we might use to help capture this.
690.04s:  And let's use an example for this breakout concept.
694.48s:  The question we might say is, well, do we want to sell puts or buy calls?
698.96s:  What delta, what days to expiration, so on and so forth?
702.24s:  So how do we answer this?
703.92s:  How do we figure out if I want to sell puts or buy calls?
706.52s:  Well, let's now look at an example.
709.04s:  Let's go back to what we were looking at, which was so far.
712.76s:  And we can see that this is following some of the broader tendencies related to that,
718.00s:  not perfectly so, but some of them.
720.72s:  And we can see that there's this light consolidation, although volume and overall size of the candles
727.84s:  so average daily range was expanding in here.
730.36s:  The reason why that matters is because that actually violates a little bit what we might
734.08s:  expect to see.
735.36s:  But these different traits, they're not universal and absolute.
739.60s:  They're traits to look for.
741.36s:  But really what I'm looking for here, and we're back in time right now.
744.76s:  We're back in October of last year.
747.76s:  What I'm looking for is price behavior relative to this near term price action.
753.20s:  And then I'm trying to eyeball for a breakout.
755.88s:  So let's say that we finally see that breakout.
758.24s:  We see that there's a big volume node here.
760.80s:  And we start to say to ourselves, if price really breaks above this level that we draw,
765.92s:  we're going to consider it a breakout and trade it.
768.12s:  Well, what does that mean?
769.44s:  Well, now I need to decide between two different positions.
773.76s:  I can either buy some calls or I can sell some puts.
778.24s:  So the way I look at it, if you follow something like my ratio call diagonal strategy, which
782.68s:  I'll throw a link to below for an entire playlist on it, you already know the kind of things
788.20s:  I'm going to eyeball.
789.20s:  I'm going to go out maybe 90 days or so.
791.40s:  I'm going to look for something that's close to at the money, maybe one strike in the
794.72s:  money.
795.72s:  And let's analyze this as if this is a hundred thousand dollar account.
799.44s:  And what that means is I'm going to size my loss at a point that's maybe a percent for
804.96s:  a hundred thousand dollar account for this kind of trade again, based on understanding
809.44s:  the profit mechanism and type were wrong a lot.
812.60s:  So I'm actually going to size it down a little bit than whatever my standard risk control
817.20s:  might be.
818.20s:  So again, if we're using a one percent, maybe I'll go a little bit under that.
822.48s:  So I'm going to size it so that I can place a 30 lot of the nine 17, Jean 25s.
829.32s:  I get them for a dollar seven and at my exit point of eight 50, why eight 50?
835.36s:  Because again, based on my research and understanding of this profit mechanism and type and corresponding
840.08s:  signals that fall below, if it falls below this level, I'm just wrong.
845.16s:  So it means my idea was wrong.
846.36s:  It's time for me to get out.
847.68s:  The reason why it's so tight is because it reduces the total risk and it's forcing me
853.92s:  to be correct.
855.24s:  If I'm wrong, that's okay.
856.24s:  I want to be wrong.
857.64s:  Quick.
858.64s:  If we go back into this and we're looking at this call scenario, we can see what our
861.88s:  PNL might be.
862.88s:  So let's say if we get a 15% move, we would make $2,600 and we lose 752, essentially, if
871.12s:  it drops 5%.
872.88s:  So this place is a really high premium on being correct in terms of our directional analysis.
878.20s:  Let's comparatively look at this again, selling puts.
881.92s:  For selling puts, we might do something that's like 35 days to expiration in this example.
887.28s:  And we're using the 26 delta, so the first strike at the money.
890.68s:  So let's take a look at what we can make here, sizing it the same so that we lose the
895.88s:  same amount of money if it falls to 850 and we take our exit.
899.08s:  Because again, based on the profit mechanism and the type and signal, it's not dependent
905.04s:  on whether I sell calls or I'm sorry, sell puts or buy calls.
909.60s:  The way I exit this trade and manage the risk is by being directionally wrong.
913.60s:  And that's the risk side of the equation.
915.72s:  That's what I'm managing for it here.
917.56s:  So if I size it to be about the same, I can put on a 50 lot of the eight puts out in 15
924.60s:  no, my max profit is 1600 bucks.
927.48s:  So if I get that same 15% move, I make $1,000.
932.08s:  So we can already see a difference based on these and based on what I expect to see,
936.40s:  I already told you what this tends to look like, which is more aggressive price movement.
942.64s:  So now let's fast forward a month and see all these perform.
947.04s:  I'm going to go to the eighth of November and let's just compare them quickly and see
951.96s:  how they do.
953.88s:  So if we fast forward this as well, which is part of on demand, we have to make sure
957.64s:  we're capturing the full profit potential.
960.20s:  So if we take a look at this on our short put side, we make just about max profit because
967.24s:  we're cherry picking a scenario here, but the stock goes up.
970.20s:  It's still loading, but it does go up.
972.52s:  So we can see that the stock actually rallies up.
975.32s:  Now it's at like 1293, we're at like near max profit on these short puts.
980.32s:  That's great.
981.32s:  That's a fantastic outcome for this scenario.
983.40s:  If we take a look at the call equivalent, you'll see that we're sitting at a profit
988.02s:  of $8,000.
991.80s:  What's the difference here?
993.36s:  Well, based on what I expected to see, how I expected the price to behave and move,
1001.64s:  this was a more fitting strategy based on the idea to capture this kind of upside potential.
1009.52s:  So this goes all the way back.
1011.20s:  Why do you care about profit mechanisms?
1014.12s:  Because if you sold the put, you left so much on the table because you didn't take the
1018.96s:  time to understand the nuances of the profit mechanism and type that you're trying to trade.
1026.12s:  As always, if you have any questions, let me know.
1028.32s:  You're not there.
1029.32s:  I'll see you later.
