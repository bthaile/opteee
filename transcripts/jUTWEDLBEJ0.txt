616.44s:  bubble
618.44s:  bubble
620.44s:  bubble
628.44s:  to follow suit. I just can't imagine that this many people actually think that this thing
636.12s:  is worth anywhere close to this. And I mean, it's already plummeted essentially in half,
642.36s:  right? It was Saturday in the afternoon at 1,300, 73 bucks. And as of Sunday, 15, 45, 40.
654.00s:  So this thing's getting the altcoin treatment. This is just, yeah, fucking crazy to me.
660.64s:  So the memories when I bring it up is I think people should at least be aware of this,
664.88s:  not necessarily to have a strong opinion or to try and trade them and that kind of stuff.
671.60s:  But this kind of thing is interesting. And it's interesting because it shows investor behavior.
679.68s:  It shows trader behavior. It shows what FOMO looks like. It shows a lot of things about markets.
687.12s:  And this is putting something that we talk about pretty regularly on full display that markets
693.44s:  are not always rational. And more over all of that, it also means that there are a lot of people
707.36s:  that made a lot of fucking money from this thing so far. That's the other reality. So when we see
712.48s:  stuff like this, especially if you have a in and eight disposition like like or dislike, that's
717.44s:  okay. But just set that side for a moment and understand a very important market concept that
725.84s:  you have to be aware of in totality. People make money trading movement. You need movement.
734.72s:  If you see movement like this, people some are making a lot of fucking money. There's people
742.56s:  making a lot of money in this right now. So that's another thing to keep in the back of your mind
750.00s:  because when you're trading things like options, for example, there are things that you can trade
755.84s:  options on like biotech stocks that are not all too dissimilar to something like this that are
761.52s:  just super, super erratic, super, super volatile. And you can make money trading them. Now again,
767.52s:  I already made it clear, I've nothing in this. So I have no dog in this fight. But this is not
774.64s:  something to just scoff at and think, oh, Trump coin, that's ridiculous. Why would the incoming
780.80s:  president use his platform to launch a coin a couple days before and have spelling errors on the
785.12s:  website about the coin? Yeah, like you could have those opinions. But you always have to take things
792.08s:  back to base case fundamentals of what do we hear for? We're here to trade. We're here to make money.
798.16s:  So this is something you can make money in. Now it needs a completely different approach
803.36s:  because of how crazy it is. And you have to understand the securities that you're trading and
808.56s:  their behavior and whatnot, especially something that's a little bit lower float like this. But
815.20s:  man, absolutely insane movement. Now I haven't seen like any statements come out or anything,
821.68s:  which I would be really interested to understand. I wanted to go to the website really quick.
826.80s:  And then we can move on to something else because I really don't think we have to spend a lot of
831.04s:  time on this. I'm just curious, where's their website? Here we go.
835.52s:  That's not at all what this dude looks like.
849.44s:  It's interesting because I mean, Trump doesn't look bad, but he's 70 something
856.08s:  year old dude. He has a bit of a gut like this doesn't look anything like him. So it's just
861.12s:  another fucking weird thing to me. Official Trump meme. I want to see like what he
872.48s:  Trump memes are intended to function as an expression of support for and engagement with the
879.20s:  ideals and beliefs embodied by the simple Trump and the associated artwork are not intended to be
884.80s:  or to be the subject of investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.
892.48s:  Mart, get Trump memes is not political and is nothing to do with any political campaign or any
898.96s:  political officer government agency.
904.88s:  There are 200 million Trump available on day one and will grow to a total of 1 billion over
913.20s:  three years. Each group's allocated allocation are released on their own schedule over three years.
921.92s:  There's the emission schedule.
928.24s:  And then they're mostly up front supposedly unlocking primary liquidity provision, which is
935.12s:  interesting. It's a little bit like that whole hawk to a coin thing. The coin world is so
944.32s:  fucking curious. And if you're an options trader, you have to look at the coin world. The reason
951.60s:  why you have to look at the coin world is this coin stuff is kind of like when options were first
958.00s:  being brought and rolled out more broadly. There's opportunity here, but there's a lot of new ones.
964.48s:  You have to learn it a completely new thing, which old dog, new tricks, I'm good,
973.20s:  but I can definitely see that there's opportunity and stuff like this, even though it's not an
977.76s:  investment thing according to them. Clearly people think otherwise. So yeah, wild, absolutely wild.
986.64s:  Now let's take a look real quick at that Melania coin too. I'm just curious about this one.
994.64s:  So this one doesn't seem to be moving quite the same. I mean, obviously it went from
1005.04s:  0, 0, 4, 4, 9,
1010.16s:  peeking at 0, 4, 5. Again, it's the same thing. It's that volatility. There are people that are
1016.32s:  caching in big time on that volatility. And let's see this one really quick.
1025.84s:  America's comeback lady on ETH.
1037.28s:  This is crazy.
1046.96s:  What the fuck?
1058.32s:  The meme coin is a cryptocurrency project based created solely for satirical and humorous purposes,
1064.96s:  not affiliated with, sponsored by Melania Trump in any way. Oh, that's interesting.
1071.36s:  So who owns this project?
1076.88s:  Would we like an endorsement from Melania Trump? We really don't care to you. Whoa, did you guys know that?
1088.80s:  I did not, I genuinely did not know this.
1097.20s:  And they have all our shit up here. I see so parody, good. That's nuts.
1107.12s:  Weird. Super weird.
1111.20s:  Okay. Now that we got that out of our system,
1119.12s:  big ol' inauguration going on tomorrow. Hater says so they are writing hype that's exactly what
1126.08s:  they're doing. They're very, that's exactly what it is. I can guarantee you not insignificant
1132.56s:  number of people that bought into this did not know what we just found out. That's my guess.
1140.00s:  Like if we were to guess or if we were to pull a bunch of the people that bought this coin and say,
1145.76s:  like, hey, why'd you buy the coin? What do you think about this? My guess is a bunch of them would
1150.88s:  not know that that's not affiliated with Melania Trump in any fucking way.
1154.56s:  James says they'll dump on you. Oh, they're already dumped. They dumped, well, they got more to
1163.44s:  dump. It's still going up. There's probably a lot of people that don't know that. I didn't
1168.96s:  fucking know that until we just looked at it. So you have to imagine that there's a pretty
1173.68s:  significant number of people that are just getting into things. And that's super common, man. Like
1180.64s:  people will just start trading something that they either do or do not know much about.
1188.88s:  So I mean, I don't know. I don't necessarily feel bad for them because you have to pay attention
1193.84s:  to what the fuck you're doing. But yeah, whatever. That's that's their bag. Cool. Let's get out of this
1207.28s:  madness. And let's pivot over. I actually want to talk. I want to switch over to a focused
1213.76s:  topic for today. And it's a post that I came across on Reddit, essentially about like option.
1223.44s:  I'm typing it as I go for the timestamps, but it's something like
1228.56s:  option edges. Misconceptions.
1236.72s:  And I made a post about it in the newsletter for this this past week. So I'll also grab that
1244.08s:  so that we can take a look at that together. I think it's.
1249.04s:  How do I? There it is.
1254.40s:  Oh, yeah, also the TikTok man. I don't know if you guys know, but the TikTok man apparently
1258.40s:  is already gone because I literally that the humor behind all this stuff is just classic to me.
1266.72s:  So I used to do YouTube shorts. And then I stopped just because they weren't really doing anything.
1272.88s:  And I don't know, I didn't really care. And then I started doing TikToks just a couple months ago.
1282.00s:  And the reason why I started doing TikToks is because I thought, you know, new audience,
1286.88s:  probably not a bunch of traders over there might be a good place to, you know,
1292.16s:  connect audiences a little bit. And that that kind of thing. So I started making TikToks.
1298.80s:  And then I start finding out all this stuff about the ban. And I was just like, oh,
1303.44s:  fuck, of course, that's just my luck. Start something on a platform and then it just gets taken down.
1308.64s:  But they, they put it back up today. So earlier today, you couldn't log on. Then midday,
1316.32s:  I noticed that you could log on, but you couldn't post or I couldn't post at least, maybe because of
1320.48s:  a peasant account. And then this afternoon or towards evening, I guess, I don't know,
1325.76s:  it's five. So it's like late afternoon. I looked again and it said something about like working with
1334.00s:  President Trump or whatever. And they've restored connectivity for TikTok.
1342.48s:  So I thought that was really interesting.
1346.40s:  BDs will says the guy that imposed the ban back in 2020 is now bringing it back so weird. Yeah,
1353.76s:  it's, well, I think if, if I'm not mistaken, we'll take a look. We don't have to sit here and
1359.92s:  conjecture and misspeak about it. I think we can, I think we can look together. That's one of the
1365.92s:  things we're going to look at. And let me grab this. So tick, tick, talk, ban, update.
1378.40s:  So it went into effect. What? I literally think earlier today or some shit. Yeah, here.
1390.48s:  All right.
1391.92s:  I think that's great.
1392.96s:  Tiktok began restoring service to users in the US following a temporary and voluntary shutdown
1397.20s:  that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access
1404.40s:  after President elect Donald Trump vowed to try and pause the ban by executive order on his
1410.80s:  first day in the office. We think President Trump for providing necessary clarity and assurance
1415.76s:  to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok. So over 170 million
1420.72s:  Americans that had a TikTok side in the statement. It's a strong stand for the first amendment
1425.76s:  and arbitrary censorship. So I'm very curious though where they're going to land because of this
1433.76s:  is the main, this is the main problem is far as the government is being involved. They're saying we
1440.96s:  don't like that it's owned by a Chinese company because the other thing that I have learned about
1448.08s:  TikTok is that there are different versions and the US version is a hell of a lot different
1454.96s:  than the Chinese version which that's noteworthy. It's not purely surprising that there would be
1463.60s:  different versions for those that don't know just about everything is different in different places
1469.84s:  to try and tailor to that culture. A great example of this is Disney. If you go to Disney in the US,
1478.08s:  you'll get the US Disney experience. They tried when they first made Disney over in Japan,
1486.24s:  which were they were so excited about Disney in Japan. They spent tons in tons of money researching,
1494.96s:  finding where they're going to build in the perfect spot, erecting Disney and they launched it
1500.88s:  and it was a massive failure. Why was it a massive failure? Because they launched it and they
1507.68s:  tailored it to what they expected the Japanese culture to want and funny enough for Disney.
1515.20s:  They didn't fucking want that. They wanted the American experience. So then they revamped all
1521.20s:  of Disney in Japan and then it ended up being a massive success. The point is the default for
1528.40s:  companies is when you're rolling things out in different countries, you try and tailor whatever it
1534.48s:  is to the individual country that you're in because there are different cultures, subcultures,
1540.80s:  elements and artifacts of the way that they do things that you can connect more effectively.
1546.00s:  The fact that there's a difference between US TikTok and China TikTok, that's not all insanely
1552.64s:  surprising to me. But if you look at the kind of materials that are being moved through the algorithm,
1560.08s:  whether it's the actual people that are supporting it or if there's a back end process that's
1566.08s:  ghost handing it along, that's another question because we've seen that even with domestic-based
1571.36s:  social media companies where we know for a fact that they have a pretty significant hand in
1577.20s:  the processing of algorithms and what has bigger reach than other stuff. So a lot of really
1584.40s:  interesting intricacies behind this. And it says TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged
1592.08s:  the long court, but it was rejected by unanimous Supreme Court on Friday. So then Trump on Sunday
1597.68s:  posted that he would restore TikTok writing, save TikTok and then value to issue an executive
1603.84s:  order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there
1608.64s:  would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went
1613.52s:  into effect. Americans deserve to see our exciting inauguration on Mondays, as well as other events.
1620.48s:  I would like the US to have 50% ownership position in a joint venture by doing this. We save TikTok,
1627.04s:  keep it in good hands and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our
1632.56s:  approval, it's worth hundreds of billions of dollars, maybe trillions. This is one of the cool
1637.20s:  aspects of the way Trump does things is a lot of it are seemingly just standard deal making,
1646.56s:  but these are the kind of things that you don't really see happen that much. And it's because there's
1653.28s:  a ton of other competing interests. But the idea of having shared ownership alleviates a lot of
1660.08s:  those concerns, I think at least, but we'll have to see. So the court decision said in the
1667.12s:  investor ban does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its users, agreeing with the
1673.44s:  government position that the platform could be used by China to collect vast amounts of sensitive
1677.52s:  information on Americans. This doesn't fall on deaf ears, but this also begs the question,
1688.00s:  what kind of information is being collected then? And why is it so sensitive in the hands of China's
1693.04s:  compared to US corporations or whatever? Maybe we don't necessarily need to collect that amount
1698.00s:  of information. That's all theoretical shit. Don't have to get into it. To me, this just begs a couple
1703.60s:  of follow on questions as all. And let's see, Biden administration said enforcement of the law
1711.04s:  would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself, the company took itself offline
1716.72s:  shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline. Users in the US open up the app late Saturday night
1721.84s:  were greeted with the message, sorry, TikTok isn't available right now. Yeah, okay. Okay, here we go.
1729.76s:  Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books and companies like
1734.56s:  Apple and Google could be penalized on the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to save TikTok
1738.72s:  and 90 day extension is something that will most likely be done because it's appropriate.
1743.92s:  If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday. The law includes a provision that
1748.72s:  allows for short term extension if there is progress in sales. Interesting.
1758.24s:  Mochikens is team who collects more information on its users and there's absolutely no rush for
1762.56s:  Congress to ban its presence. Interesting. I honestly don't know much about it, so I can't comment
1769.28s:  intelligently, but if that's the case, interesting, it is per usual. There's pockets of stuff
1776.08s:  like that that seemingly don't fully drive or make complete sense.
1781.68s:  There is. Cool. Off we go on this. All right, let's talk about options.
1789.92s:  One of the recent posts that came across, actually, I'm going to grab that post again because I want
1796.24s:  to get rid of my comment first. I don't want you to see my comment prematurely. Let me
1804.88s:  move this over here and give me a second. Okay, cool.
1817.04s:  I just don't want you to be skewed by what I'm talking about here. Now, for everybody that was
1825.68s:  in the newsletter, you will see this down at the bottom. I went through essentially all of this
1831.20s:  and explained some of the elements, which is cool. I want you to be able to come up with your
1836.48s:  own conclusions and stuff, but I also want to spend a little bit doing it live with you so that
1840.80s:  we can go a little further into detail. The post was, do you use black sholes for actual trading?
1847.84s:  They say, I see some people posting about conference presentations on vol surface and whatnot.
1853.92s:  I've wanted to get surface models to see if there's any real advantage of knowing the surface
1859.84s:  patterns beyond just looking at 2D charts. I'm thinking you need to use black sholes to
1866.08s:  represent the theoretical 3D surface and also real-time data to map and compare. Do any of you
1872.40s:  actually do this in as there any point? Let's start with what this is and what we're talking about.
1881.76s:  For those that don't know, the black sholes,
1884.96s:  Martin model, and that's another thing that is always slightly annoying. It's not like a big deal,
1890.00s:  but Martin is on BSM is, Martin, black sholes, Martin, everybody just does black sholes.
1896.72s:  The reason why people do black sholes is because black sholes brought the model first and then
1901.84s:  Martin added to it, but Martin's inclusions were literally super important for the model actually
1908.24s:  working. Random ass thing, I suppose, but just for you, people out there to be aware,
1917.60s:  BSM is not black sholes model. BSM is black sholes, Martin, and you add the word model.
1924.16s:  There are three people that worked on the model. Again, a random thing to know.
1932.72s:  Before I go any further, I want you to spend 60 seconds. I want you to genuinely think about,
1944.80s:  write it out. You don't have to put it in the comments because it's probably too long of an answer,
1948.80s:  but spend 60 seconds answering this question. While you're doing that, I'm going to give you some
1953.04s:  context. The reason why I want you to do this exercise is because I'm going to reveal to you what
1958.80s:  the fuck my answer was. I want to talk about those details, but the reason why I want you to
1964.32s:  literally, literally write your answer out for yourself is it's such a great way to learn.
1971.76s:  Then you're also going to be able to compare whatever you write to what I write.
1978.16s:  We can have a conversation about the elements that we're discussing. You guys already know,
1983.04s:  I love using Reddit as a vector for learning because it continues to capture the experience
1992.64s:  of most traders. It's a great example. In general, honestly, it's kind of ugly to say,
1999.44s:  but it's the truth. It's like a great example of shit not to do. That's the reality.
2003.44s:  So take a few more moments, finish writing out your thoughts.
2014.80s:  And if you're like, I don't feel like writing out my thoughts, then don't. But you literally
2019.60s:  are wasting a good learning opportunity. I know that I do streams a lot and you guys are probably
2024.56s:  really used to at least being able to use these as a resource to help yourself learn. But
2030.80s:  you got to at least in my opinion, if you want to learn this stuff, you got to take advantage
2035.52s:  of the opportunities as they pop up. Because there's a fucking chance that I get hit by a bus tomorrow
2040.56s:  and there's no more streams. That's some shit that can happen. So what is that? Seize the day,
2047.12s:  whatever the fuck you're supposed to say. Hopefully I don't get hit by a bus. I will be honest,
2053.04s:  that would be that would be pretty fucking lame. Like a bus. I could see going out a lot of
2059.92s:  different ways, but the bus is just such a lame way. GCA says, no, stay away from the street. I
2068.08s:  might have to stay away from the street tomorrow because now that I put this out in the ether,
2072.24s:  that would be bad. And yeah, the whole bus thing. Anyways, let's highlight before I show you,
2082.32s:  before I show you my answer, let's highlight a few things. First thing,
2086.16s:  hosting about conference presentations on wall surface. Why conference presentations? Why does
2093.36s:  that matter? Well, it matters because they're taking it as professional approach. They're taking it
2100.00s:  as people are going to informed conferences and talking about a wall surface. So then we start
2106.16s:  to think that's what we should be doing. That's the inference there. I wanted to get surface
2113.52s:  models and see if there's any real advantage of knowing surface patterns beyond looking at simple
2118.80s:  2D charts. The surface is just a way to visualize things. And I will show you an example.
2128.16s:  If we go here in Qs and we can combine them, but if I plot this here is a volatility surface.
2141.68s:  It's 2D, but it gives you all of the details from a three-dimensional plot. It's just not as aesthetic.
2150.64s:  So what ends up happening with a volatility surface is rather than having multiple lines
2157.20s:  like this that represent the different explorations. The multiple lines are built into the model,
2163.04s:  so then it presents itself more so as an actual 3D surface. But this provides you all of the same
2169.68s:  inputs that a 3D surface is. So the very first thing is their focus on simple 2D charts compared to
2181.20s:  3D. There's fucking no magic there. There's literally zero magic there. The only difference is
2188.00s:  how it looks. You can see things a little bit differently for sure, but you can still see pretty much
2194.88s:  everything you want to see on something like this. Now this can look really noisy. It definitely is.
2199.92s:  So then we can look at averages. We can look at things like out of the monies. We can get rid of
2206.40s:  certain explorations. Maybe we focus on a front expiration and then the next primary
2211.76s:  explorations and see what that looks like. Interesting. The 21 Jan exploration looks fucking
2217.04s:  psychotic compared to these others. I can see inversions and gada gada gada all this other kind of
2221.84s:  shit. The main thing I want you to take away from so far is that there's no magic in a 3D
2230.40s:  representation of this data as compared to a 2D as compared to something else.
2234.24s:  It literally nothing. So I want to show you the inputs that they're using so that then you
2245.92s:  literally can make your own. You can make your own in Excel. You don't have to go somewhere.
2251.60s:  There's no, I need to figure out where I get the 2D versus 3D you make your own. There's no
2260.88s:  magic to this. The difference is and this is part of their fundamental, fundamental misunderstanding
2266.96s:  of how this thing works. So the first thing when we think about a 3D model is we have days to
2274.48s:  expiration, different durations. So that's your first axis. Your second axis once we click into
2282.72s:  one of these is going to be your strike price. Your third axis is going to be the actual volatility
2289.92s:  at that intersection. So we're connecting all those points together. We need to figure out if it's
2295.28s:  a call or put, you can plot them all again. Like I was showing you in the bottom of that other tool,
2299.68s:  you can plot them all as the same. It doesn't matter. You can just use the averages, the out of the
2303.12s:  monies, the end the monies, whatever you're trying to actually look at. But there are essentially
2309.44s:  those key elements that we're trying to plot. And that's what we're trying to visualize. And again,
2316.32s:  it's literally the same thing that they show you here. They show you strike price. They show you
2320.64s:  volatility, which is this axis. And then they just use different lines for different
2325.68s:  explorations, different durations. That's all. So if you want to create your own, all you do is
2333.44s:  first start with a graph. How do we build this graph? Easy. We start with days to expiration.
2343.04s:  Then we add a column for strikes. Then we add a column for vol. So then we go through and we fill
2351.20s:  this in. We say there's five days to expiration. And we're going to look at whatever is at the money
2359.36s:  plus a handful that are out of the money, lower strikes. Well, I'm not going to use money in this.
2365.20s:  We're going to pick whatever strike is at the money. And then we're just going to take a number
2368.64s:  off of that. So in this case, this looks like four to the upside and maybe four to the downside.
2373.92s:  Maybe it lined up well. And there's your at the money. So then whatever the at the money to strike
2381.04s:  is. So we could say the strike is 10. So then this is nine, eight, seven, six, and then so on and
2388.64s:  so forth. And then we go in and we find the five DTE, the six strike. And again, you can pick if
2395.04s:  you're going to do call, put average, whichever you want. And then you can plot it. A key right here.
2403.52s:  That's it. Then you literally just create a surface map with this. You literally can do it in
2409.36s:  Google Sheets. You could do it in Excel. You could do it in Python. You could do wherever you want.
2413.84s:  The whole point of visualizing a surface model is to help us understand where opportunity might be.
2425.04s:  I cannot emphasize the might enough in that sentence. This entire exercise is based on what might
2436.08s:  be because going back to this. First of all, black shows is black shows, Martin, second of all,
2449.76s:  this is a pricing model. When we're using an options pricing model, there are a handful of
2457.36s:  inputs that we have to know in order to successfully price an option. A lot of them are already known.
2467.20s:  There's only one. There's only one input, one input.
2473.04s:  That's unknown. Which means we need to come up with an estimate for this is volatility.
2486.96s:  So black shows, is it used in actual trading? No, markets are consensus driven. Second,
2493.92s:  there's nothing you could do with black shows unless you are creating your own plot of volatility.
2501.84s:  That's better than the market plot. I want that point to be crystal clear.
2510.08s:  When you're inputting your black shows, Martin model, which we have. So we're going to have things like
2516.08s:  the stock price, strike price, days to expiration, risk free rate, so on and so forth.
2525.52s:  Type, whether it's a caller puts that stuff. As we're inputting each of these that we literally
2532.16s:  can see in an options chain, we come up on one that we don't know. So unless this unknown,
2542.32s:  you have a better estimate for there's nothing to be seen here. There's nothing to be done here
2551.52s:  because the black shows, Martin model is just a way to take the pricing inputs of an option
2559.52s:  and give you an output. This option is worth one dollar. That's it. So their interest is really good.
2572.72s:  They're looking at the right things. Unfortunately, we already know the answer to what they're going
2579.68s:  to find, which is nothing. You're not going to get anything out of using the black shows,
2584.64s:  Martin model. You're not going to get anything out of using any other pricing model because the
2589.44s:  only way to use anything like this to derive an actual edge is if you are pricing the volatility
2598.16s:  input more accurately than everybody else. That's it. So back to this. Let's take a look at the response.
2613.20s:  We already talked about this, essentially saying that black shows, Martin, is a way to calculate a
2620.16s:  premium using the volatility of an option. The volatility surface simply is a plot that shows you
2630.56s:  the implied volatility across different strikes and expressions. So if you visualize a surface,
2637.36s:  if I take the options chain that we were just looking at together, plot out all of the volatility
2644.64s:  that we find. And let's say I was literally going to try to draw a, I don't even know how to draw
2651.28s:  like a 3D thing for you guys. But let's say I can show you this.
2657.52s:  Let's say here, I can see that the 21 March 540s are priced more richly than the 21 Feb
2677.12s:  540s. Let's see that. There could be a trade in there. There could be a reason why it's price
2689.44s:  like that. More often than not, there was a reason. That's price like that. You might not know what it is.
2696.40s:  Just like if you guys see me go through when I'm doing the GameStop analysis stuff on Saturdays,
2700.40s:  there's a lot of times I'll come across shit that is telling me something's going on. I don't
2705.04s:  exactly know what it is. You don't always know. But what I can tell you is that in general,
2712.24s:  we expect expiration cycles that are further out in time to have higher implied volatility.
2718.32s:  Not always the case. So then if you visualize this on a 3D surface or a 2D surface like this,
2724.16s:  this is a volatility surface. This is what we're looking at. If I visualize this and I see this,
2731.12s:  it could be something or it could be completely explained by a reason of some sort. We just don't know
2738.88s:  what. So plotting, the process of plotting or visualizing of volatility surface provides you
2747.20s:  precisely zero edge. You get zero edge. It's just a way to visualize stuff. What I want to highlight to
2757.68s:  is this is something that retail traders do all the time. Retail traders go through the process
2763.68s:  of learning and they feel once they've learned something that they're now entitled to some sort of
2771.04s:  output from that learning. If I know what a volatility surface is now I should be able to extract
2777.68s:  an edge from that. I put in the effort to learn the volatility surface. It's not how markets work.
2783.28s:  It's not calibrated based on the effort you think you put in. That's one of the beautiful
2789.28s:  things about markets. It's completely indifferent to you. So there's absolutely no edge in just
2798.40s:  visualizing the surface. So going through the process of plotting a surface can be really useful,
2812.16s:  just like I showed you we came across an example where there might be something found.
2818.72s:  We might see something there, meaning if I see a longer term expiration that's priced more
2824.24s:  richly to a near term expiration, there might be an opportunity there. Maybe I buy the
2830.48s:  vol on the further expiration and sell it on the near term expiration. There could be something there,
2836.96s:  but it doesn't inherently mean there's something there. So then anyways, we go down this thread a
2843.36s:  little bit more and there's a comment here. So this they then come and say yeah I haven't really
2859.52s:  delved into how it can be used. So I can tell right from the beginning there's a slight defensive
2865.68s:  element to the way that they're framing, but that's okay. But yeah, IV is an input for BS,
2871.92s:  but BSM, but it's calculated backwards from the actual premiums paid in actuality.
2880.88s:  What they're trying to say is you can use Black Sholes-Martin model to derive the derivative.
2890.00s:  It's a differential equation. You can derive components from it, so you can derive out what
2896.80s:  volatility is being priced at. But guess what your platform will do that for you.
2902.96s:  It's automatically going to do it for you because that's a base function. So what that means is
2908.96s:  the way that we're arriving at this implied volatility surface percentiles here,
2914.48s:  this isn't TD Ameritrade that's saying throwing their surface model out there and saying based on my
2921.76s:  calculations and my surface model implied volatility should be this. They're not doing that.
2927.36s:  They're taking the current price and then they're deriving out the volatility based on the other
2934.96s:  inputs which are known. We know that this is 33 days of expiration. We know that this is a 520
2944.80s:  strike. We know that this is a call. We know what the dividend is. We know what the risk-free rate is,
2950.96s:  so on and so forth. So we can take, it's just a basic differential equation. We can take elements
2957.92s:  out of it to isolate components. So that's what's happening here. And that's what your platform
2964.16s:  is already doing for you. So then it says, I'm just curious to know if there's any point to look at
2970.00s:  it. And again, they're confused with what they're looking at. Like, is there a point in looking at
2975.28s:  the volatility surface? Sure. Again, you can come across ideas in there, but there's no edge baked in.
2981.92s:  And then it says like a mismatch and call put parity, the probability that you as a retail trader
2988.32s:  are going to spot and be able to trade put call parity is about no. There are high frequency
2998.00s:  trading systems that are seeking to arbitrage those relationships immediately because that's an
3004.48s:  arbitrage and that can be an actual risk-free trade. So if there's a mismatch input call parity that
3010.88s:  you are seeing with your eyes as a retail trader, there's probably a reason for it because the
3018.48s:  on the overwhelming majority of instances, there's going to be
3025.92s:  high frequency trading algorithms that are going to see that light years, light years before
3031.44s:  you ever see it. I'm going to pop the door for Thorke because I'm just going to go back.
3049.12s:  And then there's second point. This is cool, right? Because they're taking it the next step,
3059.76s:  which they're saying, or certain areas of the wall surface being skewed. That's smart.
3065.84s:  And they should look for that. But again, there can be reasons why it's skewed. Just because it's skewed
3072.16s:  doesn't mean that it's mispriced. This is why as you trade options more and more, you realize
3081.44s:  that essentially the only thing you're trading is an option trader is volatility. That's what it
3087.92s:  boils down to because everything else is unknown. So the only element of that trade that's an
3094.80s:  unknown is volatility. Now that doesn't mean that you can't trade options for non-volatility purposes,
3103.44s:  you can trade them for leverage for sure. But the only reason why you're trading an option for
3108.64s:  leverage is compared to the underlying is typically a matter of efficiency of some sort. That's all.
3115.44s:  So, interesting so far. Next, you guys can take a look at my response here.
3125.84s:  And while you're eyeballing that, I got to eyeball what we're getting for dinner and send this over
3132.00s:  to the lady. Give me one second while you guys check that out.
3144.56s:  James says, what you get in I don't know yet. My aim is to figure that out quickly. I had one
3165.36s:  of these. I can't tell you the last time I had one these. I normally am not super into one
3173.28s:  these. I don't do a whole lot of fast food in general, but one these itself, I feel like doesn't
3182.64s:  normally have a great, like a great vibe to it. Maybe that's being unfair. It could be unfair.
3198.64s:  That is how I feel though. No, no, no. There's a place that does like
3209.68s:  and doory will probably get that. I don't really know what tendoria is, but like Indian of some sort
3214.80s:  that's typically pretty good. All right. Dinner locked on, sending to Mel.
3227.44s:  Oh, wait, oh, wait, nevermind.
3244.40s:  Hey, said Diaz. I don't know about no. Mel has been on the I haven't been able to talk or into it.
3258.00s:  She's been anti-Mexican, which is funny because she typically likes Mexican.
3263.60s:  Yeah, whatever. We all got their phases. All right. Dinner order sent. Let me throw my stuff
3268.88s:  in there real fast and then we'll be off. We'll be off to the races here.
3275.36s:  All right. We are Gucci. Perfect.
3306.16s:  Okay. Let's now talk about the next key element of this. We already talked about all this stuff.
3323.92s:  There's one more that I think is important. This is such an important point for people to understand.
3334.80s:  This person says, I think knowledge in how something is priced when you were both buying and selling
3341.12s:  is an edge in and of itself. I cannot express how wrong this is. And this goes back into that broader
3353.36s:  general retail trader entitlement thing. We're taught from when we're little tiny babies that if
3360.40s:  you work hard at something, you're supposed to get something out of it. And in general,
3365.20s:  it's a good reason to work hard at stuff, but it doesn't mean that you're granted something out of it.
3372.72s:  So this is a person that thinks if you work hard to develop the knowledge on how something is
3379.44s:  priced, that that is an edge. And it in no way is an edge just because you know how something is
3388.40s:  priced doesn't equal edge. And I you guys know that I come up with analogies all the time. I don't
3395.04s:  know why my brain does that, but I do. It's how I think about stuff. And this is the example that I gave
3401.44s:  them. I essentially told them that the knowledge of how something works is table stakes. You have to
3407.92s:  know how things work in order to do the thing just because you know how it works doesn't equal edge.
3415.52s:  So the example I gave them is if I'm playing basketball and I know the rules of basketball,
3421.68s:  I know that I have to dribble the ball. I know that if I pick the ball up, I get two steps,
3426.32s:  unless you're in the NBA, then you can get 14 steps apparently as long as it's followed by
3430.88s:  an incredible dunk. We could look over the 14 steps across half the court.
3435.36s:  Cool. Joking aside, we know that if you put the ball in the hoop, you get points. Now,
3442.48s:  depending on how far away the context of the ball going in the hoop, you get different amount of points.
3448.80s:  That being said, just because I know if I put the ball in the hoop, I get points. It doesn't mean
3454.48s:  that I get points. Still have to put the fucking ball in the hoop. I still have to do the thing
3460.08s:  that I understand. So I highlight this example because I cannot tell you how often I see this.
3470.88s:  And this is one of the main reasons why I like staying active on Reddit is because I literally
3477.20s:  use it as a proxy to understand where people are at. And this is a common one. This general mindset is
3488.16s:  so common for me to see where people will feel like once they do something enough or once they
3494.72s:  work hard enough that they're then again, owed some level of something and it's just,
3502.16s:  it's just unfortunately not the case. That's how she goes.
3511.52s:  All right, what else we have? We have a little bit of time left. So I'm happy to
3517.28s:  bullshit and talk about anything you guys want to take a look at. Were there any interesting posts
3522.64s:  or videos or trades or anything that you guys have come across? This is a hilarious. This is
3529.04s:  also another thing that's funny about Reddit is people are fucking hilarious. I have more of a
3535.60s:  talk to Shoals man myself. We got to up vote that. That's so good.
3546.24s:  Yeah, it's like a technical analysis because people use it for evaluation. So maybe the
3550.32s:  ruler is often some areas. Yeah, they're still confused.
3561.76s:  10 years options trading have no interest in black Shoals whatsoever. That's not a good thing.
3568.40s:  Like this is a good example of somebody who's just like touting ignorance and something is
3574.40s:  generally not a great vibe. Now, sometimes there's a place for it, right? Because sometimes people
3580.08s:  start to get off on how much they know about some shit, even though they might not do anything with
3585.68s:  it. That's not good either. You don't want to be that. But to say this, this is just dumb.
3592.48s:  Liquidity and monthly explorations, Ivy ranked general understanding of the fundamentals and
3596.32s:  at least 10% of the stock price in the at the money straddle. This, it looks like they're just
3601.60s:  saying in like a expectation of move while avoiding earnings and keeping size and delta in my
3609.84s:  comfort zone. I mean, that just this is a nothing comment. This doesn't mean anything.
3619.76s:  And these, I never understand these people like these are just shitty people.
3625.20s:  These are people that they want to say something online just to say words, but they add
3630.48s:  literally no value. No, okay. Fucking sick, bro. I've been learning more about options over the
3638.72s:  year. This is the first time I hear discussions about surface charting sounds like not all brokers
3643.12s:  give you. Toss was one that I found out. Toss does show you this. No, Toss does, yeah, Toss does
3651.36s:  show you this. It's just not 3D. It's 2D. This is also hilarious.
3671.20s:  Yeah, interesting.
3673.12s:  A continual reminder that the vast majority of what you read on the internet genuinely are just
3681.52s:  people that really are unsure of what they're talking about. That's, I mean, it's just this,
3687.12s:  what it is. I hate saying stuff like that because it's annoying and people always overvalue their
3692.72s:  own understanding of things and undervalue other people's understanding of things. But
3697.28s:  we just scroll through Reddit a bit. You'll kind of get a sense of that. Futures down a little bit
3701.52s:  here. Vix is popping actually not commensurately with the move that we're seeing in the equities.
3708.00s:  So that's interesting. Fruit oil not moving much. James says, what's your opinion on far out of
3713.52s:  the money put credit spreads like 5% chance of expiring and the money looks like 25% annually is
3718.56s:  reasonable with these trades. That sounds like smoking crack to me. If you can show me where you're
3729.84s:  seeing that, we can talk about it specifically. But no, I mean, think of, again, think of what you're
3736.56s:  saying. If I'm trading futures, that's okay. We can look at futures. Tell me, tell me which one
3744.96s:  you're looking at options on futures. My guess is you might be actually mispricing options on futures.
3750.72s:  They're priced differently. So you're probably going to be grossly sad when you go to enter the
3755.36s:  actual trade you're looking at. It's, it's not going to be worth anywhere near you think it's worth
3759.12s:  probably. That's my guess. What's the trade you're looking at? The multiplier for futures
3764.08s:  options is different than options. But back to the, back to the first point. Yeah, okay, let's
3775.28s:  take a look at MES. This is generally what I was expecting. Okay. And walk me to the expiration
3788.16s:  and then the trade that you want to look at. And while you're doing that for the rest of the folks,
3799.84s:  this is a, it's just a good reminder on why it's really important to always keep in mind the
3807.84s:  context of what we're trying to do. Think of it this way. If I told you that there's a 95% chance
3814.24s:  of you making 25% annual, what do you think about that?
3822.16s:  Pretty fucking sick, right? So then you have to, it begs the question, what am I missing?
3828.00s:  Something's missing. But the question is, what is missing? Because it's definitely something missing.
3834.88s:  I got to update our timestamps. Let me pop the door for a door real quick. I'll be right back.
3874.40s:  The next one is the expiration. It's about three to five percent probably of expiring in the money.
3877.28s:  What expiration though?
3887.84s:  Weekly, okay. So let's take a look at the end of week, which is what the here. And let's open these up.
3896.88s:  All right. So you're saying two standard deviations, so three to five percent probability.
3908.24s:  We'll go to 5% probability, which is here. Okay. So now what? I am at the,
3917.20s:  I am at the 58 15s and the 58 20s.
3922.16s:  So what's the spread that I'm doing?
3931.36s:  And before we get too far into that, we'll take a look at one other thing, just one down. Okay.
3938.88s:  So five points wide. Yeah, okay. Before we go further, what is this 58 20? What is this put
3948.32s:  worth? So what's the premium of this put in total dollars? You.
3969.60s:  Matthew says gigaday 69. James says, oh, on my platform, no, no, no, not on your platform,
3976.16s:  not on your platform, just right here.
3985.04s:  Hey, there says, I don't know, this is theoretical. Yeah, no, that's why he's, that's why he's bringing it to us.
3990.00s:  Okay. So James says three dollars got it. So, but what's the actual value? So like, if I were to just
3995.60s:  sell this put, do I get just three dollars? What's the number of dollars? You think I get
4002.72s:  if I sell just this put with nothing else? Matthew says 305. What about James?
4022.32s:  Wrong. James says times 100. So yeah, 305, right? Wrong.
4029.68s:  The multiplier on futures, on options on futures or futures options, depending on how you want to phrase it,
4037.04s:  is different, not 100. So the, and that's exactly if you remember, before we started doing this
4045.12s:  exercise, that's the exact thing I said is going on here is your misunderstanding what the multiplier
4051.68s:  is. The multiplier on MES is what? Not 10. What's the multiplier on MES?
4064.24s:  Five. No, it's not 50. The multiplier on SPX or ES, not SPX, ES is 50.
4075.12s:  The multiplier here is five. So what happens if I go again into this, this option right here,
4086.32s:  and I go to sell, how much am I going to get? Let's think peak. Let me make sure that nothing
4095.12s:  else is in here. Yep, okay. So my max profit here, $14.25.
4109.20s:  Hella different than 305, isn't it? Hella different. Or even if I move this to 305 to give us the
4117.36s:  midpoint, 305, 1525. So what's going on here? Where's the money? Is the multiplier is different.
4130.40s:  The multiplier on options futures, James says, no, I mean like you risk half your accounts so you
4138.88s:  increase lots, it doesn't matter. You're misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm trying to first teach you
4145.44s:  something about the pricing of options. I understand your point. I probably understand it better than
4149.68s:  you think I do. I understand the exact thing. I'm just going step by step and showing you the various
4155.52s:  faults in the process or in the strategy is you see it. And to be clear, what you're doing is great.
4164.40s:  I love that you're doing this. Hence why I'm literally spending time on the stream talking to you
4168.08s:  about it because I think it's a great learning factor. And you're also the person that is being
4174.88s:  willing to talk about this stuff. Obviously you're not afraid of looking dumb. I'm not saying you're
4179.28s:  dumb. I'm just saying you're not afraid to talk about it, which is good. Exactly what we're trying to
4184.24s:  do here. That's why I'm giving you the time. But yeah, no, I'm following what you're saying. I'm
4189.20s:  just making sure that this first point is understood. And the reason why this first point is so important
4195.92s:  is even if you risk half your account and it's a spread, the total amount of money that you're going
4200.80s:  to get is different than you think. Right. So let's pretend instead of MES, let's pretend
4210.16s:  that you're trading spy. And it's just because that has 100 multiplier. If I'm trading spy with 100
4217.12s:  multiplier and I'm using weekly options and I go to the five, five percent here. If I sell this,
4227.84s:  I'm making 26 bucks. And then if I buy this to spread it off, it's three pennies.
4235.92s:  Is what I'm getting. If I do this in forward slash MES, the same scenario, because we're spreading
4243.12s:  it off, it won't look all too dissimilar. But it will be different still. So this is sell this,
4252.16s:  buy this. And in this trade, your max profit is 75 cents. You see the difference. In the other
4269.68s:  trade, you at least made $3. In this trade, if you spread it off, you're making 75 cents. So,
4279.68s:  again, depending on what size account you think you're trading, it doesn't matter like half the
4285.84s:  account is arbitrary. Right. We're just saying half the account that doesn't really mean anything.
4290.40s:  So let's take a look at the actual numbers here. Let's say we have our 75 cents. The trade itself
4305.28s:  is going to require 24.25.
4323.28s:  So you're going to risk 24.25 to make 75 cents. So let's just do the math here. You have a $100,000
4333.36s:  account. You're telling me that we're going to risk 50% of it.
4344.48s:  So that tells me in terms of sizing, this divided by this,
4352.80s:  we need to use just a regular number. And we have to round down. You're going to do
4359.12s:  2061 contracts. Again, just playing the game. We're pretending that this could even go on.
4368.48s:  James says, I'm testing on a $2,000 account. My max loss is $500 and max profit is 15.
4375.12s:  Okay. So let's update this. So we're doing 2000.
4378.40s:  And you're saying putting up my max loss is $500 and max profit is 15 on a 19 long.
4399.28s:  So you're not using half the account. Is that correct?
4402.16s:  If you're risking the actual half the account, you would have 41 loss.
4411.44s:  You're telling me that you're doing a 19 long.
4418.16s:  So that I'm not fully understanding. But anyways, let's just do the math. On this 19
4424.00s:  lot, you make 75 cents. So you make $14 and 25 cents. You make $14 and 25 cents.
4433.60s:  And you're risking 460 75. So let's take a look at the return. So on the account,
4445.04s:  we would make $14.25 divided by the account value, which is $2,000. As a percentage,
4452.96s:  it's 0.71 per week. So if we make, where's my other here we go?
4463.52s:  Weekly is .07. If you take, I'm sorry, .7, I'm bad. So .7 per cent weekly would represent a 43.7
4476.80s:  per cent annual return. If you do this every week, 43.7. So as I tell you,
4491.68s:  just applying common sense. And then we'll explain why the whole there, James says,
4498.24s:  IDK is it wrong? Let's not wrong. It is what it is. But the risk exactly, the second,
4506.96s:  your last comment is exactly what it is. It's bogus. It's bogus in terms of it's not going to work well.
4514.64s:  And let's talk about why it won't work well. If we have this gain,
4521.20s:  sorry, let me fix this. If we have this loss against this size, guess what that means?
4531.04s:  One losing trade wipes out 32 winners. That's not including fees. That's not including commissions.
4538.80s:  That's not including slippage, including absolutely nothing. One losing trade wipes out 32.
4545.12s:  So then we have to figure out what the probability is of us experiencing a loss.
4553.60s:  And we can literally do the math. We can figure out exactly what this might look like.
4561.04s:  The way we can do that is we can use something like a simple model. We can look at pricing as it's
4568.32s:  today based on we can adjust it by volatility or something like that. And we can say,
4573.60s:  what would I need to see as far as underlying movement in order to absorb a max risk,
4580.80s:  meaning the stock would have to be below the bottom strike, whatever that is. So then in this case,
4588.32s:  let's figure out what that is. 58N. So it'd have to go to 58N.
4601.28s:  Is that worth the... Let's zoom this in.
4606.80s:  So with MES trading right now at 6026, 58N is about right here. And if you'll notice,
4625.60s:  58N is well within a potential large move. It's smaller. It's outside the expected move.
4637.28s:  But it doesn't require a massive move in order to hit that. And it's because we're so close in time.
4645.92s:  So James says, but we can split these up due three or four trades a day.
4652.64s:  So we risk 2% of the account on each trade. Yeah, the risk side of the equation here is,
4662.16s:  it's not terrible in terms of size. But let's take a look at what we think might happen.
4669.92s:  So we might make 1425. The probability of us making that is 95. And then the loss here would be 2425,
4680.72s:  5. You have a negatively expected strategy.
4690.16s:  That's just the reality. So then you would have to develop something else. There would have to be
4697.84s:  another element to this, a timing element. James says right, but most put credit, most put credit's
4704.96s:  spreads are negative. The point means nothing. Again, that's an entitled, it's an entitled statement
4714.08s:  just because most are negative doesn't mean that it makes it okay. Because we want this to work.
4722.80s:  Doesn't fucking matter. The fact that most credit spreads are negatively expected tells you something,
4728.88s:  and it reiterates the prior point that I was making that you need something else.
4735.44s:  James says, but with the right trade management, we can make money. Exactly.
4741.92s:  What's the edge here? Because the edge, you can't manage the rolling of these options. That's not
4748.56s:  going to magically make it profitable. So there's got to be something else.
4755.68s:  Because there's a couple other really important notes here. One of those notes is we're even
4763.84s:  pretending as if the liquidity would remain there for you to do this, which it won't. So granting
4773.12s:  that element, which I have to show you, the overall
4782.08s:  the overall open interest for both of these, the 518 and then the 510 is 0 and 11.
4790.56s:  So the first thing that tells you is that you're looking at something that's illiquid.
4798.96s:  That then becomes exacerbated during a down move. That's also exacerbated by the fact that you have
4806.56s:  two legs, both the short and then the long. And then the other problem you're going to face
4814.24s:  with something like this is when you're trying to roll a vertical. Rolling of vertical is
4819.76s:  essentially not going to happen. And that's general parlance. It could occur. But the
4827.12s:  probability of actually getting a well-priced roll on a vertical enough to actually help the
4831.44s:  vertical is about null. So there's serious practical application downfalls, unfortunately, to it.
4842.64s:  But without going into any of those, the primary issue that you're going to face is that this is
4849.44s:  a negatively expected strategy and that it would require a much more nuanced approach
4857.20s:  if we're to hope to make any sort of money on this. But in its current form, yeah, like this is
4863.12s:  no good, unfortunately. James says I had a massive losing trade on a zero and I was able to roll out
4870.80s:  90, 90 to instill one. So I know the max loss doesn't always happen. No, it doesn't necessarily have
4878.64s:  to always happen. But you're one scenario of rolling a zero DTE trade that was losing out to nine
4884.40s:  doesn't help you either. What that ends up doing, especially for something like this, that you're
4888.72s:  trying to rely on a statistical probability, right? A high probability trade, 95% is you now starting
4895.84s:  to wrap up a bunch of money into losing trades and rolling them out for nine times the duration
4901.28s:  of the original trade. That starts to compound in an ugly way really fast. And yeah, like
4908.48s:  that's its own can of worms that will be problematic for you.
4912.88s:  So yeah, I mean, the cliff notes version is this is the same thing. The Saint-The-Hackelberry.
4919.68s:  This can win a whole bunch of times, but the very few times that it does experience a loss,
4926.80s:  it's going to overtake 32 wins whenever that does happen. Even if you choose to roll it,
4932.96s:  and then it continues to fall further in the money, one of the problems that you'll have is the
4938.80s:  further something goes in the money. If it continues to move against you in a sustained move,
4942.72s:  then rolling becomes even more, more difficult. And then you actually end up booking a loss on the
4947.12s:  full trade and you will have a compounded loss, which is not good. So yeah, bad news bears,
4953.36s:  as far as I could tell, thanks for bringing it up though, as you know, love looking at this stuff,
4957.28s:  hope to help the whole point is to try to save people money from from burning money on stuff like
4962.64s:  this. So yeah, good job bringing it up. All right, gang, time to go eat some dinner. I'm out of here,
4969.92s:  being outlier. I'll see you later.
