0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  If you know all what's about
91.92s:  the
114.52s:  priorities
116.26s:  Is it
118.76s:  screen. We'll see when it pops back over though, as it always does. And welcome to another
125.76s:  operating basics live stream. So the game plan for today is to walk through some general
134.72s:  activity from the week. I want to run through Reddit because, you know, it's always fun
141.08s:  to use Reddit as a place to come up with conversation topics. And there was a couple
145.68s:  of actually today that really stuck out to me that I think will be interesting conversation
151.90s:  points for us. So I have a few of those that I want to talk about. I'm going to grab those
158.28s:  pull them up so that we can look through together. And then the other thing is whatever else
167.48s:  you want to talk about. So today's kind of like an open session, open Q&A with whatever
173.28s:  we feel like discussing. So that's what I have planned for us. And then we can dive into
180.76s:  the rest as we go along. So great to see everybody. So let's, oh, here's another one that
187.72s:  looks good. There's a ton on Reddit right now as I'm flipping through these. So let's
192.76s:  grab a couple of them. That's so funny. There's always, there's always a ton of people on Reddit
205.92s:  that I cannot help but get a kick out of. So we'll look at that one. We're going to look at
214.64s:  that one. And then we're also going to look at that one. Let's see, we got in the chat. Who's
223.00s:  here on Friday getting ready to learn about some options? Sharp in the old sword as they say.
229.12s:  It looks like we got some moda Shre black mamba, hater James Pepe gang's in town. It's like the
236.76s:  perfect, the perfect group. I think to learn about options to get a little closer to things.
244.16s:  And one of the things I was noticing is I was talking to people throughout the week. Oh, our
248.92s:  boy Benjamin just hit me up. Would we got here? Interesting. Oh, this was talking about,
261.92s:  um, this is Benjamin from the Benjamin YouTube channel. But we were talking about the United
269.52s:  Healthcare thing. So he just hit me up about that. That's still unraveling. It looks like they
279.12s:  think that he's fled New York. And it's like, no fucking shit. Like shocker that the dude who did
289.12s:  that would flee the place that he did it in. It's like the fact that that's even topical.
296.32s:  Well, not that's not what Benjamin's saying me. That's what one of the news article was saying.
299.92s:  It's just like, this is nuts. But yeah. So here's another interesting thing that I have to talk about.
310.08s:  Let me grab this screen actually. And because this, this blew my mind. So when we first looked at
327.20s:  United Healthcare, it was here. This was the day of the shooting. Nothing happened. Then this,
333.12s:  then the day after there was this big massive drop, I was so late to this party because I
341.20s:  genuinely believed if there was going to be a big massive move, it would have happened on the day
347.36s:  that the event happened. This is really interesting to me that it was essentially delayed
354.64s:  an entire day. And today was great for the fade. But this surprised the ever living shit out of me
365.68s:  because the shooting happened in the morning. So it's not like it happened at the close and the
371.52s:  market just got the news lay. And there wasn't enough time to digest it. This was like early morning
378.08s:  on the fourth was it or whatever. So this was absolutely nuts. Now we did see tons of puts rolling on.
388.88s:  And I didn't participate in those puts right away because again, like I really thought that if we
394.96s:  were going to start seeing this kind of movement, it would have happened on the day of. So then on
399.92s:  yesterday, when we started to see a move, I was like, kind of interesting. Don't know if this
407.12s:  is going to materialize. And then it was like, as soon as it dropped below 600, then that's like,
411.28s:  yeah, grab the puts. But normally for those kind of events, I'm pretty fast to getting something
417.36s:  on to trade the news. And that little bit of a head fake was very strange to me. And as always,
423.68s:  I aim to let you all see inside the world of what I would consider to be like a actual normal
430.56s:  trader. Not everything's perfect. Not everything is top-tick, bottom-tick rarely so actually. It's
435.28s:  normally a complete shit show. And we can come up with very simple ideas that end up panning out
442.40s:  at some point. But this one was just slightly confounding to me because I really thought we would
448.00s:  have seen much more of this style movement here. So in that, I don't want to go too far down the
457.84s:  deep end. But that almost seems like, yeah, I don't know, man. What I want to say, and I have
466.16s:  nothing behind it that I could ever possibly prove. But what's gnawing at me is it almost seems
475.36s:  like either one of two things happened. In order for the unwind to start, there must have been a
482.80s:  series of different approval processes that could have slowed things down tremendously and
487.84s:  led to a delay. I don't actually believe that would be the case because we've seen
493.52s:  sell-offs happen much faster than that. So I don't think that there's like a fucking one-day
496.88s:  approval process. But that's like the side of me that wants to be giving and not think
504.00s:  too deeply about the other thing, which is it does almost seem like there probably could have been
511.68s:  some collusion among some of the larger holders of this to dump this fucking thing at once.
518.80s:  Kind of believe that. And the only, again, the only reason why I believe that is I cannot,
524.80s:  I cannot find another explanation that would lead to this because my first thought process
533.12s:  was, huh, maybe there was a lot more information that came out from Wednesday into Thursday
542.72s:  that then led to this move. But the amount of information that came out Wednesday into Thursday
549.12s:  does not, it didn't justify it. And that was my original explanation to myself because that
554.88s:  would have made sense. If at first it just seemed like this was like a fucking cycle path that
559.12s:  did some shit, then sure that absolutely could be the case. But you can just watch the video and
567.20s:  know that that wasn't the case. You could tell that this wasn't like some sort of professional hit,
571.12s:  but you could tell that this is something that was at least moderately researched. So it was
576.16s:  purposeful for some reason or another. So the idea that, you know, that I just didn't see anything
584.40s:  come out over the course of the evening between here and here to justify this being a essentially
590.96s:  inside day with nothing. And then this being a day where we opened up at six of six in close
597.44s:  that five seventy eight nine, like that's a big move in something like this. And then for it to
602.96s:  continue. So anyways, the trade is going well. I'm completely fine with the performance of the
609.44s:  position and whatnot. But I just I always this is one of the things I find so fascinating about
615.92s:  markets is exactly what I just described in most stretches of my imagination at least. I fully
623.76s:  would have expected to see some of the move materializing here. And then since it didn't,
630.32s:  I was slow to get in not that slow to be honest, but I definitely was slower than I was expecting.
635.44s:  I got in just just as soon as a crack below six. And then so it's been a great move.
640.24s:  It's been a 50 point move. This will be a beautifully profitable trade. No, no gripes about any of
646.32s:  that. But you also have to understand for somebody that's a seasoned trader. It's these small details
652.56s:  that are very interesting to me. They're very intriguing. And I spent a lot of time pondering
658.32s:  what goes on in this kind of instance to lead to this.
661.60s:  Dutedo says, I think it was a pro hit trying to appear like an amateur. I don't see any benefit
668.32s:  from that whatsoever. Could be again, no, but literally nobody knows. It could be that, but I
674.00s:  don't see any benefit to that whatsoever for the quote unquote pro. It wasn't a pro. I can tell
680.88s:  you it wasn't a pro for a lot of the reasons we looked over in that video together, not just from
686.64s:  a performance standpoint, but also the fact of like going to fucking Starbucks. And I think they
692.72s:  have pictures now of them without his mask. So it's like, this is in no way a professional.
700.88s:  This is a, it's obviously not a haphazard amateur approach, but it's I absolutely would not call
709.12s:  professional. Let's look that up really quick though. United healthcare news.
718.96s:  I'm just kind of curious what the latest is. And then we'll get into the heart and soul for tonight.
723.60s:  I'm just genuinely curious about this. One of these websites that think it might have been CNN.
730.32s:  I'm not a big fan of CNN typically, but one of them is done a really good job. This isn't it.
736.00s:  One of them has done a good job. This isn't it either. There's a website. I don't remember which
740.96s:  the what what website it is, but there's one of them that like it keeps it tally of the news as it
747.36s:  comes out. So it's like, you know, it has the news block with what's known at that point. Then
752.48s:  a news block, what's known at that point above it, which was much easier to track the entire the
758.08s:  entire bit. Yeah. Okay. So here's the dude's face.
768.24s:  Where was this taken at?
775.20s:  I want to see if any of these places has that thing I'm talking about. It doesn't look like it.
780.00s:  These all suck. All right. Let's just read through. What do you guys want to do? Do you guys want
786.16s:  to do NBC? Do you guys want to see an end for NBC again? Looks like NBC will be it.
794.88s:  Because I like it. I did a video that I actually wanted to watch. Let me add captions here so
802.88s:  that we could watch this the other. Yeah. See, this is the problem with committing a hit in a place
811.84s:  like New York is like you cannot hide, bro. There is just there are cameras quite literally
818.96s:  everywhere. And unless you have perfect, literally perfect discipline in scene hygiene,
828.00s:  you would need to not have a mask. You would not have to take the mask off literally at any point
837.60s:  from the time you get even in the proximity of New York City until you and leave. And it's
842.32s:  entirety. There's no there's no other way to go about it. Like even if sitting in your like literally
852.16s:  even sitting in your hotel room that you would have had to pay for cash with a fake ID and a fake
857.92s:  name on a credit card to get into the hotel like all those details would have to be perfect.
864.56s:  So this is just crazy.
872.00s:  They took a Greyhound bus. Yeah. Okay. So they were taken as you're talking to a woman at the
880.48s:  desk of the hostel. So what the fucking hotel? How? Yeah. It's just it's straight amateur.
887.12s:  Do we have a name for this dude yet?
893.92s:  No, it's calling it a man. That's honestly pretty interesting.
904.96s:  That's really interesting because I have 100% would have expected there to be a name by now
909.44s:  with a face like like just having a face. Very interesting. Okay.
924.00s:  Here we go. And I think a couple of you commented on the video about this part.
933.60s:  Shell casings found with the Nye Defend and Depose. So this is obviously a statement.
949.76s:  It looks like the exact kind of soy boy that would do this too.
954.24s:  Like the designer little jacket and
959.20s:  fuck.
962.16s:  Unfortunate. I mean, he doesn't look that much better with like the two-collar thing to be honest.
968.40s:  I'm nobody to judge looks. I'm just saying based on like clothing. This is nuts.
976.72s:  Okay. So it looks like we don't have a name still. That's one of the things I'm going to keep
982.56s:  a pretty close eyeball on. All right. So let's get into options trading for beginners.
990.40s:  We'll see what the focus session is going to be for tonight. That will be
994.72s:  TBD. I think the last one we did was Futures for Beginners. And I think that that was a great time
1001.52s:  for a lot of people partially joking. It actually surprised me. I'm not even going to lie.
1007.28s:  Because some people were asking things about like managing risk and reward in a futures trade.
1013.12s:  But then as we were going through like the basics of futures, they were commenting that like wow,
1018.00s:  that's a lot. That's really heavy. Which tells me from a learning perspective for those people,
1025.04s:  the cart is so far in front of the horse. So just remember when trading any sort of complex
1031.44s:  instrument options, one of them futures and other one, you have to understand them. You cannot
1037.36s:  worry about anything else other than understanding them before you move on to other things. Because
1043.04s:  if you misunderstand them, you're going to lose money. It's all there is to it. You're going to
1048.80s:  lose money. So overall, I thought that that was interesting. But let's take a look. It looks like
1055.84s:  Jason has a question. Pretty new to options. Can you explain the best strategy in how to select the
1060.40s:  proper time frame strike price? Okay. Yeah. That's a great question. And there's a there's so much
1069.44s:  that goes into even a marginally realistic answer to that question. So what I'm going to do is give
1079.76s:  you an overview first. And then I'm going to give you two videos that are going to hopefully
1088.64s:  help a lot with this. That video is the first one you want to watch. And then this video is the
1095.92s:  next one you want to watch. So let's grab Jason's questions. So everybody could see it. And then we
1102.40s:  can talk about it. And for those that are hanging out in the chat, how would you guys answer this?
1108.16s:  What the fuck was I doing here? Oh, this was a short rolling a short call. That's what this was.
1113.28s:  I was wondering what the my scratch sheet got all taken up.
1119.76s:  So what do we think? This is a completely logical question. I 100% understand why this question
1128.00s:  would be asked because it's a natural starting point. And this is actually why I made those two
1134.72s:  videos that I shared in the chat before because this is such a common question. And because it's
1142.00s:  really nebulous to try to figure out the correct answer. So what I'm doing is I'm grabbing the you
1147.76s:  already know what I'm grabbing the super duper ugly insane disgusting massive. Look at this.
1155.04s:  That literally the text is starting to get so scooshed because there's a million things I'm adding
1161.92s:  to this. How big is this PowerPoint now? I haven't even 79 slides now. This is like a random. I
1167.84s:  just started taking notes in here and it's just it's straight up turning into an abomination.
1172.80s:  So for who was that? Who has that question? Were you at Jason? So for Jason,
1181.76s:  here's the way to think about it.
1184.80s:  In options, you need to understand how options behave to then decide what strategies
1198.64s:  quote unquote are most suitable. This here is the exact process that I would follow. I didn't have
1207.76s:  this framework. Nobody handed me this or this. This is shit that I've made after stumbling through
1213.60s:  the dark trying to figure this stuff out for a while. There's lots of I read a couple really great
1218.96s:  books, but even those books don't teach you an actual process to build a strategy. They teach you
1224.64s:  about different kinds of structures, how they behave, but the process of building a strategy is
1230.96s:  very specific. So the way that I would think about this Jason is I actually would worry way less
1238.56s:  about what strategy you think might make sense. And I would spend the time, especially if you're
1244.48s:  new to options, is first and foremost, understand how options work. The reason why is if you genuinely
1253.76s:  understand how options work, that the question literally will start to answer itself. And I know
1261.84s:  that sounds great, right? Literally a autonomously answering question, but I could give you like,
1269.60s:  based on what you said in there, long biased day and short swing, like I definitely could give you
1274.56s:  things that would make sense for that, but it genuinely wouldn't help you. It would do you no good
1279.12s:  at all. The reason why it would do you no good at all is because you would have no clue why they
1285.04s:  why they are what they are, how they behave, how to select between them. And it's because we have
1290.40s:  to start at the fundamental level. So let's use your question as a quick example. And we all know
1298.88s:  when I say quick talking about something even moderately detailed, this will probably be a
1303.20s:  fucking 45 minute bit, but we'll figure it out. The overall process here though is you've done a
1309.76s:  good job starting to define what you're trying to do. So you're telling me that it's your profit
1315.60s:  mechanism is long biased. So that means that we're trying to trade stuff to the upside. That's
1320.48s:  super helpful. You're also adding qualitative and quantitative data around it, not so much
1326.08s:  quantitative, but some qualitative data, things like day and short term swing trading. So now I
1331.44s:  understand our time frame. So that starts to inform what stuff might make sense for us.
1338.72s:  Holding period is a really big input for this process. Now one of the things that I think
1347.44s:  is really useful for people and I'm just going to make a blank slide in here so I can draw.
1354.16s:  We know that we got to get our draw on. What else would we be doing if there wasn't some drawing
1359.92s:  in here? And let me grab this little tool and I'm going to explain something to you.
1364.88s:  So we are trying to be long. We're trying to be time frame is day slash short term.
1385.52s:  Swing is one of those things that it can have a million different definitions. I'm just going to
1390.48s:  classify this as less than 10 days, something like that. It could be a million different ways.
1401.52s:  So then the question is, what strategy makes sense? Well, what's the next question that we want
1409.60s:  to ask ourselves here before we can even get into anything about this in terms of what strategies,
1417.76s:  what structures, before we can touch any of that? What's the next thing we need to ask ourselves?
1424.64s:  Well, we need to know this. What does this mean? Long. Long is good. So if I were to break this
1438.32s:  down into a profit mechanism, this equals price, direction, up. But as you guys know, if we take a look
1450.08s:  at this, looking at the profit mechanism, that's one of the inputs. The next input is the type.
1458.00s:  The reason why the type is so important is because it informs what things later down the line
1465.44s:  might make sense. So let's expand that point so it makes sense.
1472.48s:  Politude says the most thing I learned about options trading is that they are neither super high risk
1477.36s:  or easy money. What strategy you use dictates if it's yellow or low risk. I would take that one
1483.76s:  step further. It's a great point. But I would take that one step further and I would say it's not
1487.28s:  even dictated by the strategy. It's dictated by, well, let's take a step back. If you define strategy
1495.28s:  and structure differently, then fully agree, completely agree with that. But if we're kind of,
1499.84s:  because that's what I'm taking a little bit from Jason's point here, it looks like we're mixing
1504.88s:  structure and strategy a little bit and that's common. But yeah, fully agree with that if we're
1509.44s:  using strategy and structure as different terms. Politude says also you don't need to know all
1514.24s:  things when it comes to options. It's better to learn a few mechanics and strategies well and
1517.60s:  focus on those. That part, I guess it depends on what you mean by all things. And the reason why
1526.40s:  I think all things is so relative is because you need to have a solid foundation before you touch
1532.24s:  anything. So it doesn't mean that you need to know every strategy under the sun. I actually am a
1536.56s:  big fan of simplicity, but I don't think that that is the way to go.
1544.24s:  Politude says I have a decent options primer. I think we're good. I appreciate that. I'm
1549.20s:  actually going to kill that. The reason why is because I would have to go through it myself
1554.40s:  in order to feel comfortable for anything like that being around here. And I've already put out a
1558.64s:  ton of primer material. People have a lot that they can work through. So I don't think that people
1564.24s:  need more information at this point. I think people just need to sit down and actually progress
1569.20s:  through the work a little bit. But yeah. So back to Jason. Jason is talking about three to one
1579.84s:  risk to reward two K max loss per day. Those details don't even matter yet. This is again the
1584.80s:  definition of putting the cart in front of the horse. None of that stuff matters yet. Those are
1588.80s:  good things to know, but they don't matter. The reason why they don't know why they don't
1592.56s:  matters because we need to talk about this first. We need to talk about this and then the type.
1604.16s:  So when we're talking about price direction up, we can have a lot of things.
1610.64s:  We can have a lot of things that we can start with and we can put the way that we think the overall
1628.96s:  strategy could work based on up price direction up, but we need first to get to the type. The reason
1637.60s:  why this type comment is so important is because depending on the type, it will lead us down
1644.72s:  different paths. So let's take a look at two examples, two charts. This is chart one. This is chart
1649.92s:  two. So for chart one, let's say you have a stock that goes like this.
1659.12s:  And then let's say you have another stock that goes kind of like this.
1662.00s:  What do you notice about the difference between these two charts? A couple things, right? We can
1672.64s:  clearly see that there's this kind of motion. This is very different than what you see here.
1678.40s:  You can see that if we were to plot this as a slope, this has a steep slope. This has a mellow slope.
1686.64s:  Why does that matter? Why does that matter at all? Well, it matters because the appropriate
1693.04s:  strategy can be different based on the type of profit mechanism that we're looking at. So
1700.96s:  back over to Jason, can you, based on this descriptor that we just went through, can you explain
1708.48s:  a little bit more about the type of things that you're trading? So if you give me a couple examples
1715.52s:  of charts or tickers, I can take a look at those. And we can do a very quick analysis of the
1725.76s:  profit mechanism type so that then you can run the rest from their data. That's not it at all.
1732.88s:  I had to pop the door for Thor. He was losing his mind. So Jason, big recommendation, I actually
1747.36s:  think this is probably not going to make any sense to you, understanding the way that you're
1752.08s:  answering some of those. This isn't anything getting at you. I just want the material to be useful.
1759.52s:  So my biggest recommendation is watch those two videos first. Those two videos will go over
1766.00s:  what all this stuff means. And then this way, maybe on the next live stream, we can go through
1772.08s:  this process with you so that it's like more enriching because my guess is without that standard
1778.64s:  baseline, this stuff might not make any sense because I'm using my typical parlance
1783.76s:  in the way that I would approach the problem set. But I like I promised in the beginning,
1788.88s:  I'll give you a summary, happily give you a summary because this will apply literally to everybody
1793.12s:  that's in here. So when we're trying to figure out what strategy makes the most sense, we need to
1799.28s:  start with the profit mechanism. We already talked about that and the type. The type matters because
1804.56s:  it gives us the qualitative and quantitative behavior of whatever it is that we're trying to trade.
1812.40s:  So for example, a breakout is different than drift or even
1823.04s:  Pied post earnings announcement drift runs or value. These are all different types of a price
1832.00s:  direction of profit mechanism. So because there's these different types, they need different things
1838.88s:  in a strategy that could make sense. So step one, figure out the profit mechanism, you have that.
1846.08s:  The second is quantifying, qualify the type. That's your first step. Your second step is signals.
1855.44s:  This is where we figure out how do we find the thing? It sounds like you have that done already.
1860.56s:  So literally you can apply whatever signals that you currently use today. And then the third
1865.76s:  step is when we outline structures. So structures are the absolute base material that we start with
1878.88s:  when building a strategy. This is when we start with options in their simplest form. We add nothing
1885.52s:  on top of them. We're not worried about what what delta to use, what days expiration to use.
1891.92s:  We're literally talking about in your example, price direction up, some sort of short term trade.
1898.48s:  So that tells us we can do some sort of base with long stock
1907.44s:  with long options. Paul's specifically for short puts.
1913.84s:  Those would be the applicable base structures to start with. Then from there, once you identify
1924.64s:  which of those fits this stuff up here, the best, the profit mechanism and the type, then you build
1933.52s:  a strategy. So then you take, okay, as I look at my strategy, long stock that's too capital intensive,
1939.68s:  it doesn't do what I want. That one gets axed off the list for this specific thing that I'm looking at.
1945.20s:  The next thing is for short puts versus long calls. There's a structural difference between those.
1952.56s:  Long calls will have defined risk, undefined profit potential. Short puts are the inverse.
1958.48s:  That's naturally going to back you into a selection point based on this stuff up here. Because again,
1964.88s:  if I'm trading something that goes up like this, I don't want capped profit potential.
1971.60s:  I want unlimited profit potential because that's what I'm trying to trade. This massive movement.
1978.16s:  Whereas if I'm trading something that's a bit slower, then a short put with a wider profit zone
1988.80s:  might be more applicable. But this is the exact process you have to complete in the structure outlines
1994.32s:  to see what fits the circumstance best so that then you can decide long calls or short puts,
1999.60s:  which one of those do I like best? And you can start with that. Then you can start tinkering with
2005.36s:  slightly more advanced strategies. You can look at stuff like verticals if you have a smaller account.
2010.16s:  You can look at things like ratio diagonals, things that I like to run. But for a beginner trader,
2015.36s:  if you get into that level of detail, you start getting bogged down and stuff that isn't going
2021.76s:  to make a massive difference. Here's what I mean by that. If I trade a long call versus a short put,
2030.80s:  let's say it's price direction up and it's whatever it's drift.
2037.44s:  And let's say the stock goes up 10 points, something like that, whatever.
2044.40s:  It doesn't, it literally doesn't matter if I did this, if I did this, if I did a call,
2052.64s:  debit spread, if I did a put credit, it doesn't matter. All of these would make money.
2064.00s:  The difference is how much money, how much risk did we take to get there? The difference is in
2071.20s:  the profile. But in a nutshell, they all would make money. So I raised that point because getting
2080.08s:  two bogged down in a lot of the trivial details too early is focusing on the wrong thing.
2086.72s:  What I try to encourage people to do is get on the paper first. And what I mean by that is
2092.96s:  in a shooting context from like the military or target shooting, you have your bull's eye.
2098.24s:  And then this is just like your standard paper or whatever that goes around it. If you're
2104.16s:  citing in a new optic and you're trying to, normally we do a thing called bore citing first.
2113.28s:  Boer citing is done where you literally physically put either a laser or you look through the bore,
2121.12s:  the barrel, the gun, and you see where that laser is pointing. We need a different color for
2126.32s:  the laser. Let's say that we have a cool color laser like pink. And you see where the laser is
2131.84s:  pointing. Then for your scope, in case you didn't know this isn't a paper towel roll, this is a
2139.68s:  scope. And you have your turrets. There's a turret here too, which is what you change for a windage
2146.88s:  in elevation. So you have your turret. What you do is you twist these so that as you look through
2155.28s:  the scope, this is an eyeball looking through the scope so that it lines up with your laser.
2162.00s:  This is called bore citing. And I know you're thinking, whoa, this is about
2165.36s:  object trading, not about firearms and shooting. Well, it kind of is what I'm highlighting is notice
2172.64s:  how we're not worried about what holding pattern we need to use on our optic. We're not worried
2182.96s:  anything other than getting rounds on the paper. So that then after we make a small grouping,
2191.20s:  we shoot three times five times and we see they're all hitting over here. We have actual data
2198.56s:  to now adjust off of your six inches off to the right four inches down adjust. So then you come
2206.48s:  in, you spin your turrets so that you walk it back over where it needs to be. Take this all the
2212.16s:  way now to options trading. It doesn't matter if you're using a DTE of 30 or 32 or 35. This doesn't
2224.32s:  matter. Pick something, pick something and start to get something on the paper so that then you can
2231.76s:  adjust because again, here's exactly what I can tell you. If we're trading a long disposition
2239.52s:  and it's a swing like we're talking about. So we're talking about a holding period of maybe 10 day
2244.48s:  10 day holding. If you buy options that are this far out in time and they have at least a 40 or
2253.52s:  50 delta depending on how big of a move you're expecting and your signals are good, meaning you
2263.20s:  can reliably predict this thing pretty comfortably and you're pretty good at it. If your signals are
2268.32s:  good, it doesn't fucking matter. If you pick this with this, this with this, this with this, this
2274.88s:  with this, this with this, this with this, it doesn't matter where you pick. You're going to make money.
2278.96s:  It's going to make money. So get on paper first, then worry about fine tuning all the little trivial
2287.12s:  details because those come later. It doesn't matter if you spend all of your time figuring out which
2293.68s:  of these is optimal. If the signal's bad. If you don't have a good signal that you know what to put
2300.64s:  on when literally none of this matters. You lose. If it doesn't go in your direction, it doesn't
2307.44s:  matter if you're 30 days, 32, 35, you still lose. Again, there's caveats and details to this.
2314.64s:  The way you lose, how much you lose, all of that absolutely will differ. But again, if we're talking
2320.32s:  about a profit mechanism, which is price direction up and price direction goes down, you fucking lose.
2325.60s:  That's all there is to it. So as I like to say, first things first. So I hope that that's at least
2332.16s:  helpful overview on how you can start building a strategy, profit mechanism in type first,
2337.92s:  signal second, outline fitting structures, third, then build a strategy. The strategy does not matter
2345.44s:  until those first thing three things are done. Oh, as you literally just wasting your like you're
2350.88s:  straight up just wasting your time because you can build the best possible strategy on earth.
2355.44s:  But if we don't have a solid methodology to apply it to a signal that we are somewhat confident in,
2361.84s:  and to be clear, when we're talking about signals, it doesn't, a signal doesn't mean that you have
2366.40s:  to be right all the time. You can have a low hit signal, but very high severity, and it can still
2373.76s:  be a great signal. So don't immediately think signal means I have to be right a lot. You don't.
2381.44s:  You can absolutely have a much lower wind rate, but much larger wind size, and then it can work
2390.08s:  beautifully. Let me know if there's any questions on that. I hope that that's helpful.
2404.64s:  Now what I want to do is actually run through a couple of these first, and then also
2411.76s:  let's grab where we at. No, this. Let's grab this. I guess we can get rid of these old pictures of,
2420.80s:  I think those were from Lauren's soybean crop. Lauren does a bunch of soybeans in case you guys
2427.52s:  didn't know. And I'm going to drop these in here for you, and you guys can vote, just throw in the
2435.12s:  chat, which one you want to talk about. And then that'll be our focus topic for the latter half
2443.44s:  of the session. So take a look through those. Let me know what tickles your fancy, and then we can do
2448.32s:  that. So this one, I haven't read through this, but I want to, oh, yeah, no, I like. I definitely
2453.84s:  read through this one. I remember this one. Let's read, let's read through this one together,
2457.28s:  and let's see what we can learn. And for those that don't know why I do this, it's because as a
2462.08s:  trader, you have to become really good learning from other people. If you cannot successfully
2471.76s:  autonomously teach yourself, you are going to have a massive problem with learning and not losing
2479.36s:  fuck ton of money along the way. You have to be able to look at other people's stuff and learn from
2487.52s:  it. So let's start and see what you guys come up with here. So they're beating their goal,
2492.80s:  5,500 into 7,000. I've wanted to trade options, scared, finally decided to trade options. And for
2500.00s:  myself, thought it was worth to start with 500. In my first month, I've been nervous. In one
2505.68s:  account, I turned 500 to 7,000. The other, I turned 3,700 into 14,000. I get some FOMO unseen,
2513.92s:  these huge profits, but I'm wanting to be in this for the long run. I hope I continue to make
2518.80s:  wise choices to grow my accounts. So what do we think here? What are the thoughts? I have a bunch
2530.64s:  of things that stick out to me here, as you probably could surmise. Reece says he should thank
2539.44s:  the flying spaghetti monster, good old GOD or whatever you believe in. And then never trade again.
2544.24s:  That's awesome. Lauren says he's obviously smarter than me. I wouldn't say that, Lauren.
2548.64s:  Maybe he just has shorter legs so that he gets better blood circulation to his brain because your
2553.36s:  your body's obviously having a work double time to circulate blood all the way to your fucking
2558.00s:  toes that are several meters away from your head. But most of us have smaller circuitry. So maybe
2564.80s:  that gives us a slight edge. Mark says not sustainable. Here we go. Good. So what can we learn from this?
2574.32s:  What can we learn from this? We obviously can learn that the base options trader is unfortunately
2584.48s:  generally lay. And that's not a diss. That's not to be mean. What this means is that this person,
2593.28s:  do I have this in here? I think I might. I have a bunch of shit in here. Let me see if I can find
2597.68s:  it. I'm actually curious. I want to see. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
2617.36s:  perfect. Guess what? Yes, what gang? We get to add a new slide.
2629.84s:  And you already get a preamble into what's going in here.
2632.64s:  here. But this is exactly what I see going on here, like to a absolute T. So what's going
2651.00s:  on and the reason why I know this is because of this comment of I get some FOMO on seeing
2660.00s:  these huge profits, they don't realize that this scenario in this case is turning 500 into
2670.68s:  7000 is huge profit, like objectively speaking, it is huge profit. So we can clearly see that
2680.72s:  literally their reference benchmark is completely off. And that's why I think they're suffering
2687.40s:  from they're not even at this skill gap peak. I don't even think they're here. I think they're
2692.52s:  here. I think they're so far off from what they don't even know yet that they've not even got to
2701.76s:  this point. I don't think because normally this point takes a little while to get to and it's
2708.28s:  because you have to work at something for a while to then feel competent. So let's see what you
2715.92s:  guys say. Polar to says I think the person is wise to question whether they're using solid
2721.76s:  strategy or just getting lucky. I think that's correct too. I don't think they're questioning it,
2726.00s:  though. Are they? Because this looks like they're saying, let's hope I continue to make wise choices.
2734.56s:  So Polar to I actually don't think they're questioning it. I think they think that their skill set
2741.04s:  is somewhere that it probably isn't in their self analysis because they're attributing this to
2746.24s:  wise choices. And it could be wise choices. I'm not saying it's not. But that's what they're attributing
2751.68s:  it to. So that to me is a very telling sentence. I'd rather be skiing says I'd say luck doesn't last
2760.48s:  forever. He better define exactly what he's doing. Why? When? How? Etc. Or he'll run into serious trouble
2766.64s:  at some point. That's the overwhelming probability that I see here. And guess this is actually funny.
2772.32s:  I didn't even mean to have this one next. But here's the next one. Um,
2782.48s:  oh, what is how the fuck do I say this faux pocket full? I love these names. Also, if you guys know
2788.72s:  any of these people on Reddit, feel free to send them the clips that we're talking about their stuff
2794.40s:  because I like I absolutely hope that some of these things make it back to them because I'm trying
2800.08s:  to be helpful. I'm using their scenarios to teach a broader audience. But it's also obviously
2804.88s:  most applicable to them in their scenario. So if you guys know any of these people or if you ever
2810.24s:  interact on Reddit, feel free to let them know that we talked about this stuff so that they can
2815.20s:  hopefully at least onboard some of it. That would be great. So, but for every this,
2826.32s:  there's probably 10 times leading to this. So this person they bought Tesla's URDTE at 10 got beat
2835.20s:  the whole day lost 80% of net worth 90% of the portfolio went from 34 to under three. Feel so
2840.24s:  beaten lost on what to do now. So what do we think? This is there's a million things to pull from
2849.44s:  this all stuff that you guys already know. There's nothing overly novel from a high level overview
2856.80s:  of this. Now, I think the more interesting question to ask yourself is rather than looking at this
2865.60s:  and thinking all of the things that are wrong with it, which there's unlimited things wrong with
2870.40s:  it almost, what are some of the things that take this person out of the scenario? And let's just
2876.80s:  talk about the scenario because I noticed that happens a lot where if you look through the comments,
2881.36s:  the comments are always vicious and it's always people getting at the person. And I actually don't
2889.04s:  think that that's super productive. I think what's really productive using these kind of scenarios to
2894.08s:  learn is literally look at it as a scenario. Don't even worry about the person, their decision-making
2899.36s:  the way that they think about things. Just look at the scenario and think about the conditions
2904.08s:  that lead to that scenario. And then more importantly, what could happen here to change this? So one of
2912.08s:  the what's there's one thing you can do to change all of this that doesn't just apply to this trade
2919.84s:  that applies to every single trade that they would ever put on in the combination of all those
2926.32s:  trades in general. So what's one of the things that we can think of?
2936.88s:  Because what I'm trying to teach you here is the Pareto principle. We can teach things like
2943.92s:  position sizing. We can teach things like disposition effect. We can teach all sorts of nuanced
2950.88s:  things that absolutely will help this. However, there are a couple things that dominate this entire
2960.80s:  scenario and every other scenario that's like it. So what do we think that is? Yeah, Shrejie's
2967.52s:  already reading my mind as per usual. It's exactly correct. So Alex's stop loss. Stop losses are
2972.96s:  good, but they actually don't fix this. The reason why they don't fix this is because
2979.60s:  you can have things that fly past a stop loss and expand. I'm not saying that would have happened
2984.40s:  here. It probably overwhelmingly wouldn't. But that's not a structural fix. There's two structural
2991.28s:  fixes to this that will literally prevent this from happening ever again, period. The first thing
3000.88s:  is position sizing that's clear as day. If you size things appropriately, you immediately
3010.08s:  reduce your risk entirely because based on your position sizing, even if you're selling naked
3018.32s:  options, you can still size it such that you can reduce the total severity of a terrible move
3025.52s:  entirely. Even those stocks can conceivably go to 100 or a thousand or a million.
3031.92s:  It doesn't mean that they go though overnight. It takes some time to get there. So you have time
3036.40s:  to get out even on naked trades. So sizing, that's the first thing has to be there. The second thing
3044.88s:  is a portfolio level circuit breaker. The whole point behind that, and I have
3054.96s:  I think I have a video that talks about this. Yes, here. So this video talks about this exact process.
3064.40s:  It's not just for the portfolio. This talks about risk management and options trading writ large.
3069.68s:  But the concept of a portfolio circuit breaker is it forces you. It's just like a stock market circuit
3077.20s:  breaker. That's where the fucking name comes from. That's why I named it that. I'm just not original
3080.96s:  at all. But what happens in a portfolio is you can have a bunch of different positions that when
3086.56s:  you're putting them on, you're putting them on as individual positions. But then something big
3090.96s:  can happen in the market that then leads to a lot of your positions behaving like the same thing.
3097.44s:  So if that happens, you can have 30 individual positions that end up all starting to massively
3105.20s:  draw down together. And let's say that you were putting half a percent on of risk in each
3111.68s:  that you were going to manage your risk at. But the market starts tanking. They all start moving
3115.68s:  together. So rather than the 15% total risk you thought you had on, now your portfolio is down 22.5%,
3122.40s:  25% because everything got correlated and you're like, whoa, what the fuck happened here?
3128.00s:  The purpose behind a portfolio level circuit breaker is to prevent that exact thing from happening.
3133.20s:  So the way I do it is I have risk defined for every single strategy. Thus every single trade that
3140.56s:  goes on, there's a risk management protocol. It can be the size of the trade. It doesn't have to be via
3145.20s:  a stop loss. So there was a company that I was trading called G-SAT. And G-SAT is tiny. So there
3151.76s:  was no way that I was going to run a stop market in G-SAT because it's a sub two dollar stock when I
3161.92s:  got into it. The reason why I don't use a stop market order to get out is because I would get
3170.80s:  chewed alive on the spread. It wasn't even a big trade. It was like 50 lots and something like this.
3176.56s:  But that still is a massive amount of the total volume. And we talked about this when a while ago
3182.80s:  when I was first looking at it, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to put it on a big trade in
3186.80s:  it. That's just how it is. So the way that I manage the risk in this trade is by the size.
3196.00s:  The amount, the size that I put on was trivial. I was absolutely comfortable losing the entire
3202.56s:  thing because I knew that I was trading with a less liquid product. So I needed to build something
3209.04s:  that made sense for it. So there are different ways you can manage risk on individual positions.
3216.32s:  But you have to have risk management for the individual position. Then the portfolio level circuit
3222.56s:  breaker essentially applies it at the portfolio level. So say for example, you don't think you should
3228.48s:  have a greater than 25% drawdown on your portfolio. That means that at 25% drawdown, you start cutting
3235.60s:  everything. You take a machete and you start hacking and slashing everything. If it's winning
3244.16s:  cool, take the winner down. If it's losing cool, get the loser off hacking and slashing.
3250.08s:  Because what that means is something is gone terribly wrong. And because if we're successfully
3258.56s:  defining the size for each individual position carefully, your portfolio circuit breaker shouldn't
3266.16s:  hit. So say for example, going back to the 30 trade size at half a percent risk in each,
3272.80s:  you should have 15% total risk. So if all of those come off at your risk management point,
3279.92s:  your max portfolio drawdown at that point should be 15%. So then if you're running a 25% portfolio
3285.36s:  circuit breaker and you somehow magically hit that, that means you are fucking up somewhere.
3290.32s:  Either you missize something that's moving big. You put something on somewhere that's moving
3295.44s:  more than you thought it might. Your late, your stop didn't hit. So the loss is now growing because
3300.80s:  you use a stop limit like a fool and you didn't get out because the market was wide. All of those
3307.84s:  things can apply. So the circuit breaker is what in the military, what we call FPS final protective
3314.56s:  fires. That's essentially where you start shooting indirect fires almost onto yourself because
3320.72s:  shit is gone really, really bad. And that doesn't seem like a terrible idea. Right. So think about
3325.84s:  how bad something would have to be for that not to seem like a terrible idea. Pretty fucking bad.
3330.48s:  That's the entire purpose of a portfolio level circuit breaker. And it's really designed to protect
3337.04s:  people that don't necessarily know what they don't know yet. But you can objectively know that
3343.60s:  having a 30% drawdown in your portfolio is not good. You have to pick whatever it is because
3350.32s:  that your portfolio level circuit breaker has to be made relative to whatever your doing as a
3357.20s:  trader and whatever your strategies are. Because if you're a very risk open trader, you can absolutely
3363.76s:  have 30% portfolio swings. That can be just part of the game. That could be natural ebbs and flows for
3368.96s:  you. Or you can have a much tighter range because you're mostly trading for income. And you just
3376.24s:  don't want to get ran over in some ugly direction. So that's the way you're managing risk. You keep
3383.60s:  your portfolio drawdown to 10% or less or something like that. But you have to make it make sense.
3390.16s:  And what that means is if you're trading something like this, if we're trading something like
3394.96s:  MSTR. And then you're surprised because you're hitting your portfolio level circuit breakers.
3402.16s:  As this thing goes from 102 almost to 550 back down to 338. This thing's all over the fucking place.
3413.20s:  Right. So you can't use something like this and be like, well, I just want to have a 2%
3420.00s:  portfolio drawdown. This is not going to happen. Or you would just have to size this so small
3426.00s:  that then it doesn't hit that threshold for you.
3429.28s:  Main point got to be methodical about it. Super, super important.
3434.16s:  Elliott says what type of order should be used instead of a stop limit? Stop market.
3438.72s:  It's the only stop. That's the only stop.
3452.96s:  The reason why you have to use something like a stop market is because if you use a stop limit,
3461.76s:  it literally can skip over you. So if we hit if we get hit on a stop, we're essentially saying
3470.72s:  we should, this is where we need to get out. This is where we're managing the trade. We have to
3474.80s:  get out here. And then if you use the stop limit and it blows past your stop for whatever reason
3480.32s:  goes by your limit. And then you're still in the trade that you needed to get out of.
3487.28s:  That's a massive problem. That is a massive problem. So yeah, it's got to be, it has to be that.
3498.80s:  SimOTA says circuit breaker based on what total portfolio? Circuit breaker goes on the portfolio level.
3505.12s:  So again, that video that I dropped above will talk through all of it, the way that you can
3510.08s:  essentially build it. But you have to define what the circuit breaker is. So if you have a $100,000
3515.04s:  portfolio and you want to use a 10% circuit breaker, that means you can have at most $10,000
3520.96s:  drawdown, use 20% you have $20,000 drawdown, 30% 30,000, so on and so forth. You could pick whatever you
3526.32s:  want. The point though is that you have to pick something that makes sense relative to what you're
3533.84s:  doing. Because if SimOTA says yes, but portfolio total changes daily, I think that doesn't change
3544.72s:  anything. It literally doesn't change anything. So if you have a $100,000 portfolio and then tomorrow
3552.96s:  it's $102,000 portfolio, you can apply the circuit breaker off of either of those numbers. It doesn't
3558.00s:  really matter. But that's the point of doing it as something like a percentage. Again, there's
3566.08s:  nothing magical about it. Meaning it literally doesn't matter what you base it off of.
3571.68s:  The point is that you need to have something in place that if things are going against you
3577.68s:  in such a significant way that you're exceeding what you expected to occur, that's the point of it.
3585.68s:  So if you want to do it based on current portfolio value, weekly portfolio value, I think it's
3591.20s:  super easy. Just do it off of whatever the value is the portfolio today. But yeah, that's the point
3596.24s:  of using percentages is that it remains relative to what you're doing. But the main thing is that
3604.80s:  it should be a value that you're comfortable with. So if you have a $100,000 portfolio and then you
3613.68s:  open up the platform and then you see the next day, your portfolio worth whatever subset of that,
3622.32s:  the nature of feeling comfortable with this and having a good portfolio circuit breaker
3628.16s:  would be the portfolio as you look at it would be something that you're uncomfortable with,
3633.36s:  but you could survive. It's the scenario that's not this. I didn't read this one yet.
3640.32s:  So this one says, I can't cope huge options loss. So for this person that can't cope, that's too big.
3647.20s:  Whatever that was is too big. Let's actually see what they did. I bought 20 AVG O calls to swing
3655.44s:  today for 23 sold when it dropped to 19 because I got scared. The contract is now worth 530.
3664.16s:  Having trouble coping with mixed, missed, wave gains loss advice. This is also exceedingly common.
3674.32s:  So what do you guys think? How do we how do we answer this?
3688.96s:  This to me highlights a bunch of things. The first thing it highlights is somebody that
3697.92s:  quite like I again, I don't mean this in a rude way, but this is an emotionally unstable person.
3705.60s:  If somebody says I can't cope with X, it means we're literally not emotionally stable.
3715.92s:  So the emotional element of this is concerning because trading will expose all of your weaknesses.
3728.56s:  So if you're emotional for whatever reason, it's going to find it and it's going to punish you for
3734.72s:  it. Unfortunately, just the reality of markets. So that's the first thing I see. The second thing I see
3741.12s:  here is this because I got scared. So this tells me that we're trading a completely
3752.80s:  undefined strategy. We have no defined stop point. And we're putting something on to just see
3764.96s:  how it goes. We just have an idea and we're concerned more so about what we want to see happen
3774.80s:  versus what could happen. And I use that phrase a lot. The point of building an approach is so that
3785.52s:  when you're placing trades, you're not so focused on what you want to see happen, which is what I
3791.12s:  call the happy path. But you're actually keeping your eyes wide open for what and happen. Very,
3799.36s:  very important. So that tells me this person is not doing that. The next thing, this tells me
3808.64s:  two more things. The first thing is they likely were sticking the mud. So what this means is if
3818.80s:  they applied whatever analysis that they like to do and that led them into getting to this.
3824.96s:  And then they got out at the risk management point. As they see it rallying from this to whatever
3833.04s:  by the fuck not get right the fuck back in. This is one of the things that is so
3840.88s:  disgustingly simple yet so few traders do it and it genuinely blows my mind.
3848.56s:  So this goes back to good old bill. Good old bill.
3858.56s:  I've been out of this thing twice and what I already told you guys I'm already back in it as of
3865.04s:  here. As of the fourth. I got back in. So I originally got in here, got out at a small loss,
3872.80s:  got in here. I got out. I forgot somewhere. I got out. I think here, somewhere around here,
3879.12s:  or a profit weighted, weighted, weighted, started doing this got in here. So my idea is I'm trading
3889.68s:  something based on research analysis and a disposition. I know my timing is going to be fucked.
3897.92s:  It's always going to be fucked because I don't know what the market's going to do. I literally
3901.68s:  have no idea what it's going to do. So I put on things that are based on a probabilistic analysis.
3909.60s:  So just because the probabilistic analysis analysis leads to a unhappy quote unquote outcome,
3917.92s:  unhappy path, meaning it goes against me. That doesn't mean that the analysis is dead. It doesn't
3922.00s:  mean that the idea is shot. As long as it continues to look like how it should, it's still completely
3928.16s:  viable. And here's the funnest fact. You can see where I'd gotten in here. If I didn't touch it
3935.84s:  and just let it go, it's doing great. So I added unnecessary friction on my exits. Now, why then
3943.92s:  conduct those exits? It's because I don't know what's going to do this. This is the only reason why
3948.56s:  I conduct those exits. I otherwise wouldn't. But I have no idea if it's going to do this or if it's
3955.28s:  going to do one of these and just roll over completely sideways and then post new lows. I have no
3960.56s:  idea. So I have to play what it's giving me. But what I know I can do, and this is something I think
3966.24s:  that confuses a lot of people is just because we get just because we get stopped out on something,
3973.76s:  especially these kinds of trades, it doesn't mean you can't get back in. If it starts doing what
3978.72s:  it's supposed to do. So what I do in this kind of instance is have the trade. I have my predefined
3985.28s:  profit lost targets hits a profit target. It gets a stop. If it hits a lost target, that's it.
3991.28s:  So in this case, it hit a lost target based on an upward move. So it was what I call an improved
3997.84s:  lost target because the original lost target is going to be based on this data set here.
4002.32s:  This data doesn't exist yet. So then as this data comes into existence, then I update my lost
4009.92s:  target. So my lost target came up to something like this in here. So then I got out. I want to say
4013.68s:  here, I don't fully remember I have it in the log somewhere in here. I think this day.
4017.92s:  And it's because I don't know if it's going to roll all the way back over. But then if it starts
4021.60s:  coming back up, I can get back in. So that's the next thing is if they watched it go from 19 to 530
4032.08s:  based on an original analysis that happened to be mistimed ever so slightly because they got out
4037.60s:  after a four cent drop that tells me that they were a utterly and complete fucking stick in the mud.
4046.08s:  The second thing that I can tell from this is they do not have a process that they're confident in
4056.56s:  because here's the deal. People have asked me tons of times now. I've made videos about it.
4063.12s:  How to manage something like FOMO here of missing out. That's actually one of our focus topics if
4069.44s:  I'm not mistaken. So we talk about that real quick. FOMO is so easy to avoid. The way that you
4077.60s:  avoid FOMO is you build a skill set and a track record that you are confident in your ability to
4086.48s:  deliver and then all of a sudden FOMO is gone because what does that mean? When I first got stopped
4093.84s:  out of BILL, I at no point was like, oh shit, how am I ever going to make money in training again?
4103.36s:  How can I possibly find something that's going to yield me a profit? This is everything I had.
4110.32s:  That's not that's not the case at all. When I got stopped out of bill, I just popped over to
4115.28s:  APP which hasn't had a fucking down tick in months and be like, oh yeah, this shit does work.
4120.40s:  This one's gone just fine. So the point I'm making here is that if you have a process that you're
4130.88s:  confident in the skill set and your ability to deliver and propagate the process, there's no FOMO
4138.32s:  because you know you can find new shit all the time. There are literally unlimited opportunities
4146.80s:  in markets. Some of them are better than others. That will happen. And there are plenty of times
4152.56s:  that I've seen plenty of traders strike these massively big trades. And at no point do I feel FOMO?
4160.00s:  I genuinely feel happy for them. I genuinely also typically feel concerned unless it's somebody
4166.32s:  that I know is a trader that has a developed skill set. Then I don't really feel concerned.
4170.72s:  I'm just happy. But the reason why I feel concerned for other people is because you have the folks
4175.20s:  like this that because of their wise choices, they think because of these wise choices,
4184.88s:  they've turned a $500 account into a $7,000 account and having a 1,000% return in a month.
4191.84s:  I can fucking tell you it's not wise choices, dog. It's not wise choices. It's good. You made
4203.52s:  money. Very happy for that. It's not wise choices that led to this. Fucking luck, healthy dose of
4210.00s:  luck that does that. So if you get rid of overemphasizing the outcome of individual trades because you
4220.32s:  know that you have a process that you're confident in, super comfortable with, you know what it can do.
4225.20s:  Literally FOMO goes away. There's no FOMO. You know that you can find other things. A great example
4231.68s:  is so far. I got out of so far either yesterday or the day before. Let me see.
4242.96s:  I need to add like an exit DTE to these because I always try to find when I got out
4249.44s:  and I always have to do the math because I'm not calculating that. Oh, I do have that. What am I
4254.00s:  talking about? It's right here. The fifth. I got out yesterday. So I exited Sofie yesterday.
4264.08s:  And as I'm exiting Sofie, I didn't exit Sofie because I think Sofie is dead. It's never going to
4269.92s:  come back up and it's going to roll over and this is it. It's not why I exited at all. I exited
4276.56s:  because it's taking a breather. It's trending sideways. I can use my money elsewhere that's more
4282.40s:  applicable. One of those places right now has been Walmart. Still in fucking Walmart. Why?
4289.28s:  Is it going up? That's all. Like it's literally just going up. So as I'm exiting Sofie and rotating
4295.76s:  money into something like Walmart because it's doing what I want, I don't feel like as I'm exiting Sofie,
4301.76s:  like, Oh, how am I going to find something else? I'm just going to open my fucking eyes, run a
4307.20s:  few scans and find something that looks good. And if I don't, I'll just try another strategy.
4311.76s:  I'll do something else. But this goes back to my approach towards trading, which I have a video
4320.24s:  that goes over this in detail. Where did I? This. So what I do is I've created an approach
4332.00s:  that allows me to trade bullish bearish longval shortval structural vol. I don't care.
4338.80s:  And the reason why I create an approach that allows me to do all of these individual things is
4344.08s:  because I can always always find something to do. That's one of the beautiful components of being
4353.92s:  a retail options trader. You can move between whatever you need to move between
4365.20s:  in order to find something that makes sense. So back to this super simple. Take the exit. It's
4375.84s:  time to take the exit. Set alerts. I literally have three alerts above it. Notice this. If I zoom into
4382.08s:  a 30 day, I actually have to come in a little closer, I think, because they're pretty tight.
4386.40s:  So how tight are these alerts? I'm really curious. Not so five day. How are they still not
4397.04s:  disaggregated? What are these alerts? Oh, I just duplicated. I was like, what the fuck is that? Oh,
4406.24s:  no, disgustingly compressed. There we go. So what I do is I just set alerts to the upside.
4413.44s:  And as soon as the alerts start triggering, then I'm like, yeah, okay, maybe I need to take another look
4417.84s:  at so far. It's starting to behave correctly. And maybe I get back in. That's simple.
4427.04s:  So
4427.52s:  if I can be managed ever so simply just like that. Let me get caught up on the chat.
4441.36s:  Dan says, did Bill shoot to the shoot to the I'm assuming you mean shoot to the moon like that
4448.56s:  from an earnings beat? That's a big part of it. So if we go to BILL and you look at its original
4455.76s:  earnings play earnings time from here. So it went after the market closed on the seventh.
4462.64s:  So this initial gap is from its earnings. So it had crack earnings. It was expected to lose two
4470.08s:  cents. And it came in making 63 cents. That is a profound beat, profound beat. So this comes on to
4482.16s:  the playlist just for a post earnings announcement drift play to the upside, playing it to the positive
4488.80s:  because it had the primary conditions that I need to see, which is a certain percentage beat.
4496.16s:  And then a certain percentage gap based on prior movements. So it's kind of a relative metric.
4502.48s:  It's not a gross metric. So yeah, the earnings is what kicked this whole thing off. Now on an
4510.48s:  interesting perspective, this one confounds me. APP. I genuinely don't know why it's doing this.
4526.00s:  So I got into APP here literally when it was like a hundred bucks, it was sub 100. And it is
4535.20s:  gone from that on the 11th of September to today. It hit a high of 417.
4544.88s:  That's fucking crazy. I don't understand this one at all. And it's had great earnings. There's no
4554.56s:  doubt. There's no doubt. It was expected at 95 cents came in at a dollar 25 great earnings. Of course.
4562.72s:  But this is still a massive change in market cap. If you think of this kind of move as a reflection
4570.64s:  of the overall market cap of a company, this is a fucking cracked out move. So this thing has been
4581.44s:  very interesting to follow, very interesting to follow. It's had a bunch of price target increases.
4587.36s:  This is hilarious. Look at this. I didn't read through these yet. This is funny.
4592.16s:  McGuire raises app loving price target to 450 from 270. That was today. Isn't that a joke?
4606.08s:  That dude shouldn't have a fucking job. I'm just saying to be to be that far off. And then when
4614.08s:  it's literally at like 400 and be like, yeah, dog, maybe this can get maybe this can get to 450 instead
4621.36s:  of just to have any maybe like, what the fuck? How long do you have to be asleep at the wheel?
4626.80s:  I'm gonna come up with that today. That's so fucking funny. So fucking funny. But yeah, this thing has
4634.00s:  been on a absolute terror. This actually leads me into a scenario that I wanted to talk to you all
4639.60s:  about. It's a very interesting scenario. So let's move on to that. And then I got to get my dinner
4645.52s:  order out the door. Hold on. Dinner order is paramount. I don't think I've ever done a stake
4654.40s:  from DoorDash, but I fucking need your boy needs a good stake.
4660.72s:  So we'll see if we can find. I don't know if there would literally be any sort of self-respecting
4671.44s:  stake house that would do. That looks like they do. I don't know if I can get behind a $70
4681.12s:  Wagyu stake delivered though. I don't even like Wagyu. Wagyu's fucking gross.
4691.68s:  It's so it's so fatty. That's why I don't like about it. Wait too much fat.
4701.04s:  Ain't about all that fat. Don't this ain't it?
4706.32s:  Here we go. These guys should have a stake. Perfect. This is what we're talking about.
4722.32s:  This is funny because the place that I'm ordering from right now is it's a place called Chart House.
4726.64s:  It's like a really nice restaurant. So it's honestly comical to me to like order a fucking
4736.80s:  stake from a place like this. Make it gluten-sensitive. Is that real?
4744.48s:  That can't be real. For a fucking stake?
4752.24s:  Dude, people are weird as fuck. That's so weird. That's not weird.
4762.56s:  Feels bizarre to me. Don't feel comfortable with that at all. That is not it.
4778.32s:  Perfect. We have a
4782.00s:  perfect dinner. We gotta say.
4797.20s:  Harvey says not even a five. Yeah, no, I've tried it a bunch of times. There's actually,
4801.84s:  I don't know if you guys know Dave Lauer. This is one of our running inside jokes because I
4807.76s:  always, I literally always hate. Literally always hate the wagyu that I've tried. He's a
4817.76s:  dominant reason why I've even bothered trying it because he's convinced that wagyu is like
4825.12s:  this super great incredible stuff. I'm always like, dude, I just ain't got it like that.
4834.08s:  I just don't agree with this sentiment at all because I've tried it at Michelin star restaurants.
4840.88s:  I've tried it all kinds of places. All right, dinner order is launched.
4845.68s:  Alex says Texas Roadhouse is the best for stake. I just don't believe that man.
4850.40s:  Texas Roadhouse is fine, but that's like fine for like a budget stake.
4855.76s:  A good, a good stake is worth it, in my opinion. If you can find like a really good solid stake
4865.84s:  that they do a good job is worth it. Texas Roadhouse is fine, but I wouldn't consider that
4871.76s:  like a go-to. All right, let's talk about the position in APP. And I want to use this as
4885.12s:  an opportunity like what would you do? And let me grab my log.
4893.28s:  Tskien says have a Ruth Chris. Yeah, I've had Ruth Chris. Ruth Chris is good, but like they're still
4899.28s:  like, they're like, okay, I haven't found anything special there from my perspective yet.
4907.52s:  All right, so let's take a look. What I'm going to do is I'm going to reduce the size of the position
4913.84s:  for the example, just for the ease of talking about it. We'll do it at a one to two ratio,
4920.48s:  but it's a ratio, Paul diagonal at this point. It didn't have a ratio for a long time.
4927.04s:  And then I think I sold the ratio when it was basing in here because I foolishly thought that
4933.76s:  the stock was probably going to settle somewhere around here instead of taking off for another
4939.28s:  hundred point gain, slightly unexpected. And what I want to talk about is the management of
4950.80s:  the position. So let me grab this and then we'll talk about, I want to specifically talk about the
4961.20s:  the short calls. The long calls they're kind of all over the place because I've been scaling in
4967.04s:  and scaling out just a scotch. So the long calls just leave it for simplicity as they are deep in
4975.12s:  the money. And they're showing a tremendous profit right now. I think that's an easy way to leave
4981.92s:  that. So now for the important part though, which is the short calls because those are the ones we
4991.36s:  have to look at. So we have let's just do one one of the 20 Ds.
5004.32s:  Oh, I forgot it's not in here because I don't care in this. Hold on. We need to use the old
5010.72s:  the old phone. No, that's the run trick. Here we go. 20 Ds, three six.
5025.28s:  And we got that. Oh, great. Good for me. 1092. Beautiful. What a what a nice
5033.12s:  what a nice trade you might think, right? You might be sitting there thinking like damn
5037.04s:  damn boy, that's like that's magic. You really you really crushed it. Grabbing that 360 call,
5046.96s:  get a bunch of those for 1092, like $1,000 a pop. Not a bad not a bad payday, huh?
5054.40s:  Well, let's take a look at what those are doing now just for just for funsies just to see
5060.00s:  what this world could look like. So if we come in here and we go to the 20 Ds, the 360s,
5071.12s:  wait, did I say 360s? I literally already forgot the 350s, 360s, 360s. And don't you just love that?
5084.48s:  5550. 5550.
5094.16s:  So first, I for this, what would you do segment? I don't want to get bogged down in like trying to
5105.92s:  tailor the details for what we think I should do, what would fit my portfolio and those kinds of
5111.28s:  things. Let's start first by simply outlining what could be done. So don't even worry about if
5120.64s:  what you outline is optimal. I actually don't care about that. I just want to talk about what could
5127.12s:  be done. And again, this is getting you all in the repetition of seeing something in rifling
5134.32s:  through different things that would be done. And it's because that will help your decision-making
5142.80s:  massively. You'll be able to cycle through scenarios much more quickly if you get used to this
5148.88s:  process. So what could be done? Now, I'm going to take away the easy answer of do nothing because
5158.56s:  that's too easy. That takes just a couple of seconds. So we're going to say that do nothing is
5165.44s:  already known, understood. So then we can focus our effort on exploring other things we could do here.
5174.48s:  So let's see rather than like what would Jesus do, this would be like what could Jesus do
5184.72s:  if Jesus was an options trader. Also, massive shout out to I'd rather be skiing hooked 10 people
5191.44s:  up without I or trading YouTube memberships. That's awesome. Thank you for showing some love to
5196.72s:  the people. Alex says sell half. That is something that could be done. So let's grab
5205.36s:  our handy dandy notebook. And let's rifle it out. So the first thing that could be done. So our
5215.84s:  co-1 is nothing. Do nothing.
5224.48s:  So what's you?
5226.48s:  Del half. And when you say sell half, what do you mean Alex from this context? Because the
5239.84s:  call option that we're talking about here is a short call. So are you talking about sell half of
5247.68s:  the longs? And then do what with the shorts? What do you think? Okay, so we sell half of the longs
5261.52s:  that doesn't solve the short problem because they're still in the money shorts here, right?
5266.96s:  So then what do we do for the shorts?
5281.68s:  Elliott says it's a short call. So does that mean it's losing money right now? 100% correct.
5285.92s:  Nice job. That's exactly correct. So I originally sold the short calls here at 1092.
5293.92s:  And right now they're marked at 5550 per. So it is a lovely several thousand dollar loss for
5306.96s:  each one. It's delightful. Really? The ability to just look at that. Love that.
5316.48s:  Alex says I'm still relative new with shorting. I stick with long calls. That's okay. Yeah,
5321.36s:  that's I like that's why I'm that's exactly why we're doing this. And it's totally cool.
5326.24s:  So the problem that you that we have with your approach there is if we sell half of the longs,
5334.32s:  it doesn't actually fix or help us with these short calls because they're still there and they're
5340.32s:  still in the money. So it looked like Reese had the correct, which is something that I do with
5348.08s:  ratio call diagonals is we can close. We can close the short calls that are in the money.
5362.96s:  So that's the next thing that could be done here. The way that this works is the short calls
5369.68s:  right now are losing money. So what we can do is we can sell enough longs because these are in
5378.08s:  profit. We can sell enough longs to cover the cost of the shorts. So then you're realizing a loss here.
5390.64s:  You're realizing a profit here that overwhelms this loss so that when you have this net position come
5398.24s:  down, you're flat or up a little bit, but you're just not eating the loss on the chin. So that's
5406.08s:  absolutely a course of action. I see another course of action for rolling them. I dig that.
5414.08s:  So then we can roll out. We can go out and up. We can go out, up, size,
5428.40s:  add size. Those are kind of like the main rolling choices we have with respect to this.
5436.32s:  So now I think this is a pretty good list, at least as far as what I tend to do with this kind of
5444.08s:  position ratio call diagonals. So then let's talk about what we should do here. So now the question is
5451.76s:  what would you do? We have coa 1, coa 2 and coa 3.
5462.48s:  Which of these courses of action do you like? And I'll walk you through what I am likely to do here.
5471.76s:  And I also want to talk about another element of this trade once I see what you all are thinking about it.
5481.20s:  So what do we think? And then in the meantime, I see 2, I see 3. Let's do this. I'll throw it in
5493.44s:  because there's like 50 folks. So I'll throw it in as a pull.
5500.64s:  Coa for managing in the money short call.
5512.56s:  So 1 was nothing. 2 was close longs to finance shorts. 3 was roll.
5531.52s:  What's the pick here? I'd rather be skiing says if I can break even on the shorts by selling some
5544.64s:  longs, that's what I would do. Yeah. Well, and that's the beauty of a ratio call diagonal is because
5551.60s:  the longs at this point are multiple fold above what I bought them. So by doing that, you literally
5560.16s:  create essentially a risk free spread almost because you can sell enough shorts then to cover the
5567.52s:  downside if you're so inclined. But what I like to do if I wanted to realize the profit here,
5575.04s:  what we would do is sell a certain number of the longs to cover the cost of the shorts. And it
5582.96s:  would be at a pretty healthy ratio between them. So let's take a quick look. One of the base
5589.36s:  positions is in 16 May the two eighties. 16 May. We're out here and we have the 280s. So the
5600.40s:  two eighties are at an 81 delta. And they're essentially sitting at 14. I'm sorry, 14680. So going
5613.20s:  back to what we were just looking at. We have the 360 call. And we sold those for I think it was
5624.88s:  1090 if I'm not mistaken. They're currently at 5550. So then the net PNL here would be 4540. So these
5639.04s:  are losing per contract 4540 per lot. And the basis on this, there's a bunch of different ones.
5654.88s:  It doesn't really matter. I'm just giving you the portion there. The main thing I want to show you
5659.36s:  is this the long call right now for a couple of them. I have tranches at a few different spots.
5668.40s:  But for the long call that we're referencing here, this one is worth 146. I'm just going to call it
5675.60s:  147 and give it to the 90 is just a little easier 147. So these are worth 14700 per lot.
5687.12s:  So what this means is if you'll notice on these, I essentially need to cover 4540 per lot.
5695.04s:  So then we can just see how many of those fit into the 147. So if you have 147 divided by 45.4,
5705.12s:  you can cover 3.2. You can't use 0.2 of an option. So you can cover 3. So what that means is if you sell
5712.80s:  one of these, it covers 3 of these. This is at a gross number. This is not including the PNL.
5723.36s:  So the PNL is what I really want to use. So let's say that I got those, I'm just going to use 47
5730.48s:  because it's easier for the math. But let's say that these were bought at 47. So what that means
5736.72s:  is in terms of profit, 147 less than 47 that I would have got in at. It means I have $100 profit per
5744.72s:  lot. So then all I do is essentially the math relative to the profit. So that this way,
5752.40s:  I'm ensuring that I'm locking in a profit on the trade. So that means that for each one long call
5758.64s:  that I sell, I can cover two of the short calls and still have in that profit.
5764.72s:  You dig? I feel like that might have gotten a little heavy for some people, especially on like
5775.84s:  an option trading basics. So if that got a little heavy, don't worry. If you have questions,
5781.20s:  I'm happy to answer. It's nothing that you have to get too wrapped around the axel on upfront.
5786.80s:  That's something that if you're in the scenario where you're trying to like work through this,
5790.72s:  you can always hit us up in the discord, whether it's the Patreon section or the free section,
5795.92s:  it doesn't matter. There's plenty of people that are able to help out wherever you post.
5802.00s:  Yeah, I just want to make sure that you guys are generally comfortable with this. Cool.
5807.76s:  Alex follows and they follow in all caps, which is the really, that's the only way I know
5813.44s:  if somebody is truly following is if we're running in all capital letters. So that's fantastic.
5819.68s:  That's perfect. Good. Sweet. Yeah. So I'm actually going to use that as the focus session for tonight,
5826.40s:  because I think managing in the money short calls is a really solid topic for people managing in
5834.56s:  the money short calls and six. Because we also did this a little bit yesterday on the GME livestream.
5845.60s:  So I'll probably add both to be honest. Managing in the money short calls ratio covered calls
5860.24s:  covered calls are in the money. And then today's managing in the money short calls from ratio
5870.16s:  all diagonals. So we're learning all sorts of shit about managing calls. This is great.
5882.64s:  And then these are both on the standard YouTube channel. And then for those that don't know what I'm
5887.52s:  updating here is this list and a quick reminder of this list is it's literally available to you.
5899.12s:  So what you do is you go to my website and then you go to resources, the options trading guide for
5908.72s:  beginners. It takes a second to load because it's a big document. But if you scroll down to the
5914.88s:  bottom, you literally can see where it says focus topics as one of these tabs. So if you click focus
5921.84s:  topics, it'll show you where to get it from. So you can see all the stuff that we've covered
5930.00s:  at different points in time. And then you can go find it so that again, if you're interested in
5936.40s:  learning about it or whatever, you can grab the live stream that it's attached to. And then you can
5945.12s:  go find the information that you want. That's the at least that's the intent behind it. So I hope
5952.08s:  that's useful. Any other questions, anything else that you guys want to hit before we wrap up for
5960.24s:  this Friday evening, my dinner's not going to be here for a little bit. So I am going to hang out
5966.48s:  and probably just work on some analysis stuff. As always, I can just stay on the live stream to do
5973.60s:  that if you guys want, because it doesn't matter to me. It's just going to be less interactive because
5976.96s:  I'm going to be focusing on other shit. You guys are always welcome to hang out. But before we do that,
5982.08s:  let me know if you guys have any questions. And then I'm happy to field those before. The other
5989.92s:  thing that I'm doing right now is I'm actually going to update this guide so that you can access
5998.00s:  the different tabs, hopefully, from this top section so that you don't have to scroll to the
6006.48s:  bottom. I actually think that might be pretty useful. So insert cells, shift down. So this will be
6014.24s:  start here. This will be
6017.04s:  there are several tabs scroll to the end or use the shortcuts below.
6029.04s:  So we have start here, focus topics.
6031.84s:  We have beginner roadmap.
6043.36s:  We have
6044.08s:  excellent, complete.
6067.04s:  Maybe just four.
6067.76s:  Lauren says I have five billion questions. My questions have questions. Shoot them. Send them in.
6079.20s:  Let me know. I guess I have, we're, I'm just hanging out now. So I'm going to grab the chat. I'll
6084.56s:  put it over here so that I can keep an eyeball on you guys. And then I'm actually going to move
6090.96s:  you guys over to this screen so that I can use my other screens. And we can just
6096.00s:  bullshit about whatever you want. Elliott says you showed a Google slide deck earlier. Is that
6102.40s:  available anywhere I will pay? It's not available right now because it's not done. It's probably not
6108.24s:  going to be done. But what I might do at some point is include it as a, as a thing in the Patreon
6116.16s:  shop. Because right now anybody that's in the Patreon, they get access to everything in the shop.
6121.52s:  So what I try to do is just make it like a really great value for what it is. But the deck that I
6126.88s:  show you this thing, it literally is just all bullshit that I make for myself for like references.
6133.44s:  There's nothing. Everything that's in here is essentially available in a video somewhere.
6139.84s:  So it wouldn't really be worth anything. I don't think to anybody or at least it shouldn't be
6146.08s:  because you can grab all this stuff full frizzle somewhere else.
6153.12s:  But yeah, I mean, I'll think about it. Like you can definitely go on the Patreon shop someday.
6158.32s:  It's just not done. Reese says how close expiration to your mini short calls for ratio call diagonal.
6164.08s:  That really will depend more so on how much extrinsic value is left and what the underlying is doing.
6169.28s:  So the essentially it's less about how close and it's more about the conditions.
6176.32s:  I apply standard like rolling methodology. So if you take a look at this one is for you,
6188.96s:  Reese, this video about rolling and this video about rolling. I think those two will be most
6199.68s:  applicable to you. But the way it works is it depends on if I'm trying to get assigned or not.
6205.44s:  If I'm not trying to get assigned, I'll manage it not based on time necessarily, but I'll manage more so based on the stock
6213.68s:  relative to where the underlying is like how far and the money I am or stuff like that.
6219.12s:  And then if I'm okay with getting assigned, then I prefer to wait until almost all the extrinsic value is out of it.
6226.96s:  Good or bad. And then I'll either just let assignment go or I'll look to roll them.
6237.20s:  So notice is why did you let the APP short calls go so long? That's kind of the funny part.
6243.44s:  Hasn't been that long. So if you take a look at APP, one it crossed 360 was on the third.
6253.44s:  So one, two, three days post that. And the main reason why I've not done anything yet has to do with the way that we can manage in the money short calls in something like APP.
6270.08s:  So what I don't want to do and what I try not to do is I'll show you this is kind of an advanced thing. I don't really talk about this.
6283.04s:  I don't really talk much in most of the videos and stuff that I do because because it's kind of advanced.
6289.92s:  But it's the most simplistic way to do this for people that are comfortable holding shorts and kind of know what they're doing.
6296.88s:  So with that caveat, this is what I like to do. If we take a look at the 360s here, right, they still have over.
6307.20s:  I mean, let's just calculate what the extrinsic value is because I actually don't even know what it is. Hold on, let me see if I'm done here.
6313.28s:  Now, let me finish this first real quick. I realize I need to finish that little.
6318.40s:  In the guide, I'm trying to give people a way to.
6329.28s:  To quickly move through this sheet more easily.
6332.88s:  So this.
6336.16s:  Let's go to this beginner roadmap.
6342.88s:  Let's go to this.
6349.84s:  No wrong thing. Fuck me. I hate myself.
6353.92s:  I just have to do two of these.
6356.24s:  And then you'll just have to remind me what the fuck I was just talking about and then I can get back to it.
6360.48s:  There's the beginner roadmap.
6362.48s:  And then this is the full syllabus.
6365.76s:  So what will happen now is you'll be able to navigate from these.
6375.44s:  So that you don't have to scroll to the thing at the bottom, because that's kind of annoying.
6380.72s:  I realized the focus topics.
6390.24s:  We'll call this like the quick nav.
6397.92s:  There are several tabs.
6401.76s:  Use these links for quick navigation.
6406.88s:  Reset that.
6420.08s:  Well,
6427.28s:  what do I need?
6428.96s:  Three rows.
6436.96s:  And here.
6453.68s:  Wait.
6454.72s:  So now if you're on that sheet, you'll be able to navigate it quickly from the top.
6460.88s:  You just pop between all of them.
6464.16s:  I like that better for you guys.
6467.20s:  All right. So back to this discussion.
6472.48s:  What we're looking at here is another way to manage this that I don't really talk about in the
6477.12s:  videos. It's because it doesn't really matter quite that much. Although the way I'm about to show
6482.72s:  you is definitely more capital efficient. So one of the things that happens when
6493.20s:  you try to close these is you have to pay this back.
6505.44s:  Right. So let's say, what did I say? Sold them for $10.90.
6514.88s:  $10.90 is what I sold them for right now. They're running $55.50, I think I said.
6520.00s:  So what is this $45.40?
6525.44s:  So when you go to close these, you have to pay this.
6530.48s:  So even in the scenario on the long calls,
6535.52s:  and let's say that you're going to make what did I say? 10,000 per?
6541.84s:  No, 10,000 per?
6543.92s:  I'm a fucking remember.
6547.84s:  They're at $147.00. So it'd be $10,000 per.
6557.52s:  So even though you can sell a long call for $10,000, and then you can buy these back.
6565.44s:  So let's say that, let's just say that you have one in one to make this a simpler scenario.
6570.48s:  So you add this in $45.40. So then what is this? $6,460?
6584.56s:  $6,460? So I'm shit like that. I don't want to give you guys the wrong number.
6591.84s:  $10,000 minus $45.40. $50, $64.60.
6598.08s:  I was wondering, I was like, that fucking looks wrong.
6600.56s:  My mind is working on a couple different problem sets right now.
6605.44s:  So this should be a five. So this is your profit. This is a good scenario. There's nothing wrong
6611.28s:  with this. Now there's another scenario that's a little more complex. Let's pretend that it's
6618.00s:  now expiration day. Let's pretend that you don't do anything. So on expiration day, if you do
6625.68s:  nothing, you sold these for $10,90. Let's just pretend that they're trading for $55.50.
6635.20s:  And let's say you let it expire in the money there. What will happen if you let it expire in
6640.72s:  the money there? Well, the first thing is you keep this. You make $1,000.
6651.60s:  You make this for a lot. You don't own any shares at all. So you're going to end up short
6663.76s:  100 shares. And it's going to be at your basis, which is $360.
6673.36s:  So then you have to close this out. So you're going to go into the open market.
6678.24s:  And then you're going to buy to close these. And let's pretend it's trading where it is right now.
6684.24s:  40150. So essentially, you have to eat this loss, which is your intrinsic value. So let's do
6695.44s:  401.5 less. The 360 gives you 4150 times 100. Oops.
6706.00s:  So you notice, do you notice something here? By taking assignment and then closing it at
6727.04s:  spot price, you save yourself a little bit of money, a tiny little bit of money.
6735.44s:  Now, the time that I typically will use this is if I'm trading something that's really
6742.16s:  illiquid, or if I'm trading, if I'm literally willing to roll the dice on something,
6749.68s:  that I'm going to try to roll, which is going to be the case here. My plan here is,
6756.64s:  because the other thing also, you have to add is whatever the carry cost is, because you're
6762.56s:  going to be charged interest for the carry, which is going to reduce that take. So
6771.12s:  compared to the 4540, this will save you a few bucks. Again, trivial. It's really not much.
6776.88s:  That's why I typically just talk about trading the longs and the shorts. Now, if you wait until
6784.48s:  expiration and then there's essentially no extrinsic value left, then it doesn't matter,
6790.48s:  because this is more optimal if there's no extrinsic value left. But this scenario,
6797.68s:  it allows me to not care about early assignment because I know how this process works,
6803.52s:  so then I can wait until as much of this value comes out as humanly possible.
6810.48s:  So the more efficient approach, in a case like this, where early assignment is not a fear,
6815.68s:  it's not a parable, and I don't really care, because I would unwind the long to make sure that
6822.08s:  I'm still getting out of a profit, by waiting until much more of this extrinsic value comes out,
6829.04s:  is really, really important. Because again, if we're trading at 401, 50, and our basis or our
6838.72s:  strike is 360, that means our total intrinsic value of this is 41, what was it, 4150 I think,
6849.60s:  4150, and this is trading at 5550, 5550. So 5550 less the 4150, that leads us our
6868.56s:  intrinsic value. So notice this assumes no further move though, it doesn't matter if there's a
6874.64s:  further move, because you have the longs. So if there's a further move in this scenario,
6883.20s:  it doesn't, you're already at essentially a scenario where the longs are going to overwhelm
6887.92s:  the dollar for dollar move, because you move to a delta one product. And then if it goes down,
6892.64s:  that's just bonus. So if you can buy it to close at a slightly better point, all the better,
6899.28s:  but you have a built-in hedge with the longs that are already deep in profit.
6906.00s:  Does that make sense to Moda? That's a really important point. That's the only reason why this works,
6910.80s:  at least the unwind scenario that I'm talking about.
6913.52s:  And then in the meantime, back over to this, what I'm showing you is that there's still a decent
6923.28s:  amount of extrinsic value that I don't want to buy back yet, because I don't care if I'm assigned,
6933.92s:  because I can unwind early on the short calls, like if they fall super far in the money.
6939.92s:  If I care about early assignment risk, I have to watch these and make sure that I'm getting
6946.08s:  out when extrinsic value starts to be low, so I can eyeball a roll. But the other thing is there's
6952.96s:  a ton of rolls available right now. So if we look at the trade as it sets, even if we wanted
6962.24s:  a roll right now, again, it's trading for $55.50, and we go out to like 42 days or whatever.
6967.60s:  You can see that I can straight up improve my basis 10 points. I can go from the 360s to the
6972.72s:  370s by just going out a little bit further in time, like 30 days from still having 14 days left
6981.20s:  to go. So the roll opportunities, because I'm still very close to spot price on something like this,
6989.44s:  it gives me more choice and flexibility. So that's why I'm waiting here. And that's why that
6997.28s:  the scenario that plays out doesn't matter because there's a course of action built in for literally
7003.36s:  every scenario that could play out. This is the part that I talk about with trading that
7008.96s:  genuinely, hopefully, emphasizes why trading like good trading itself genuinely should be very
7019.20s:  easy, because all of the work for trading is done before, literally before you put on the position.
7029.44s:  And if you do a good job, then trading itself is exceedingly simple.
7037.20s:  All right, so I think I'm all done there. The other thing that I want to do
7042.00s:  is I wanted to go back through this earnings cycle and test a few things. So I'm waiting for my
7050.72s:  dinner to get here. Like I said, you guys are free to drop whenever I'm just kind of bullshit now
7054.32s:  and walking through my stuff. I'm just keeping the camera rolling because some folks I think
7060.00s:  like to hang out for this, which is cool with me. I enjoy the company. Thor is great company though.
7065.04s:  Oh, he's not even in here. I didn't know it. He's probably getting dinner.
7071.04s:  So what I want to do is create a list of company.
7080.56s:  What I'll do is this. And I'm just going to create like a little
7088.96s:  earnings tracker. And I want to I'm going to turn this into a video at some point. So
7094.32s:  if you guys don't want the surprise spoiled, click off now. But my goal is to try to teach people
7101.92s:  how they can test this stuff for themselves on the full free angle. How like specific trades might
7110.40s:  work. So it's the LSK. What I'm doing is I'm just picking a handful of tickers from this past week.
7116.08s:  And I'm going to run through trades on them. PLCE CRM, okay, TA, MRVL. MRVL is a really
7125.68s:  interesting ticker, by the way. That's I'm going to talk about this in the procession on Sunday.
7132.72s:  But there's a bunch of trades from this past week that look really interesting to me.
7138.32s:  From an earnings perspective. And there's a handful of names in here that I think look really,
7143.84s:  really good. DLTR, DH, WY, AEO, maybe CHPT. If that looks okay. DG, SIG, KR,
7158.88s:  SON, DOC, Q, HPE. And what I'm doing is I'm trying to show somebody if they were to trade
7168.32s:  options for earnings. Like how many on average you need to trade in order for the math to work out.
7177.04s:  That's essentially all it is. It's just a fucking numbers game. And we can pick what we might
7184.24s:  want to trade. And I'm going to apply that same natural screening process. Like this.
7191.44s:  I don't know if I changed my email for this. Did I? Oh, I did. That's great. Good.
7205.52s:  What I'm doing is I'm grabbing another tool that I like to use for this. I guess we could also use.
7210.96s:  Oh, this might actually be even better because some of these I don't know what they did.
7215.92s:  I don't know if the earnings school will work. Let's see. Those stock price.
7226.40s:  What do I care about? Next free.
7233.68s:  We're put delta, short call delta.
7236.80s:  I mean, this is going to look at strangles. Let's start with this. I want to see if
7249.68s:  this tool works. Oh, I forgot. It's probably not going to let me go back to on demand on Thursday.
7253.76s:  That's kind of annoying. There's a bunch that happen. That would be from DG on. Damn,
7259.20s:  that's like, that's as far as most. That's okay. We'll start with these. And then let's go to
7265.04s:  Monday, the second of December. Yeah. It's normally let's go back to Thursdays, whatever.
7278.64s:  These are both after the market. So CLS, K and ZS. Maybe we'll just add ZS.
7284.40s:  So what I'm doing right now is I'm applying two different approaches. Yes. But I do need to see
7295.68s:  if I can do the analysis. So let's see if we can go here. Let's go to earnings.
7305.20s:  Fuck. That would have been great.
7313.76s:  So what I wanted to do was to be able to go into the prior earnings data and see what it was.
7319.92s:  But I can't. I would have to flip back and forth. So what I'm going to do is actually put
7326.00s:  O rats on this screen over here. And this is just for efficiency. So what I'm actually going to do
7333.52s:  is put the chat back in the box over there. I'm going to squeeze this down. And then I'm going to
7341.68s:  move this over here. And all I'm going to do is add a standard filter for earnings.
7353.20s:  I'm not going to go too crazy because the earnings filter can be a little bit long. But what I'm
7360.48s:  going to do is look at the expected move. And then I'm going to look at
7374.08s:  the count of RV greater than IV past 12 past 12 instances. And we'll use that as a
7390.80s:  complimentary data point. There's more than I like to track, but I'm going to skip it for now just for
7397.68s:  simplicity. Lauren says, is there a paper trading app or a stock test app there should be?
7406.88s:  Well, you could do that like think or swim has paper trading as a paper trading version.
7413.04s:  You can log into or you can use on demand. But my biggest recommendation for paper trading
7418.88s:  anyways is genuinely to do it this way. Exactly. This is exactly why I'm doing it this way.
7424.08s:  And the reason why I'm doing it this way is because you maintain the data. And that's a big drawback
7432.88s:  for people that paper trade through an app or something like that is you lose the data. And that's
7439.84s:  really detrimental. So this is trading at 14. 49. And what I'm going to do is not fully
7450.96s:  optimize this, but I still will partially optimize it. So what that means is I'm going to change
7457.68s:  my entry time to be closer to market close. So we'll do like a 12 normally like 1230. But I'll
7465.28s:  just do like yeah, 1230 is closer to what I would actually do. 1230 maybe even closer 1245.
7471.68s:  The reason why I do this is because I want to do my best to isolate the actual earnings move
7479.12s:  itself. So then what I do for stuff like this is I'll add a comment for myself. And I'll be like
7485.60s:  um entry time at 1245. Pacific time.
7494.96s:  Something like that. Anthony says don't you still have the data if you use on demand not so much.
7500.80s:  The reason is because on demand you're going to run out of money in the portfolio and whatnot.
7506.64s:  And you can't you can't connect any other data analysis to it within on demand.
7515.20s:  So the options once they expire, if you go past the options, X-Berry, they're gone. That kind of
7521.12s:  stuff. So the idea here is to like actually maintain the data. All right, so for CLSK.
7539.52s:  I think I have to use my other account. That's kind of annoying.
7545.68s:  Yeah, I think I need to reach out to them. I thought that I moved the email to this.
7564.32s:  All right, CLSK. Yeah, let me email Tyler super fast.
7575.20s:  All right.
7577.20s:  So let's see. Oh, my dinner just got here. That's great news.
7599.92s:  So let's see what we have in here though. So the expected move was.
7618.00s:  Wait, why is this you're like this? So the ex, wait, was that the expected move? 14?
7624.96s:  14.6%. And then of the past 12, there's one before five six, six of the past 12,
7642.96s:  exceeded. Then I would jump in here, go to six, these,
7647.92s:  you can look at something wrote like a 10 delta, eight delta. What's the closest? Yeah,
7661.60s:  we have eight on the side. So we're run the eights. This would be 0.08.
7669.04s:  This, and this, so it gives me about 22s.
7682.72s:  And what I would do here for a lot of size is just default to one, because that's, you can scale it.
7688.08s:  And then this would be the stuff that's calculated. So this would be credit.
7699.20s:  No, no, this would be days expiration.
7702.48s:  And credit. We also need exit. This would be exit date, talk price.
7732.56s:  And then another just credit private credit private credit.
7737.36s:  I did to e credit debit, you know, but also typically track like margin requirement.
7762.36s:  So then this would be this would be stock percent move.
7790.36s:  And then I would add a couple more. I would do all percent strike, but percent strike.
7810.36s:  And the reason why I'm adding this stuff is so that later I can aggregate a bunch of data.
7816.36s:  This would be stock percent realized.
7823.36s:  This will be we already have the expected range. So this would be stock low range.
7837.36s:  Stock high range.
7843.36s:  So what these do. It'll allow me to run a little bit of a broader analysis.
7853.36s:  And then once I get this generally set up how I want, I'll slide it down a little bit.
7859.36s:  So that I can do summary statistics up here. Or I'll do summary statistics off to the side.
7865.36s:  That's another common one.
7868.36s:  Well, all right, gang, I'm gonna stop here so I can go eat my dinner, but I'm gonna keep this up after dinner for a little bit.
7874.36s:  So maybe tomorrow I'll hop on a live stream to follow through with kind of testing some earnings plays.
7880.36s:  Let me know if you need anything being out there. I'll see you later.
