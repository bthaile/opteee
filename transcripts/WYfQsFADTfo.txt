0.00s: What's up outliers? Quick market update for today was going to do it via a regular video,
5.96s: but I figured might as well open it up to the pro community in case you guys have anything
10.02s: you want me to take a look at. Feel free to throw it in the chat as we move along. But
14.32s: in the beginning, I want to talk about the broad market behavior for today. Talk about
19.92s: some earnings moves. And then I also want to talk about some earnings moves from earlier
24.04s: today. And then also after the close. So let's dive right in. So first things first,
31.16s: looking across the broad markets, we continued a little bit of a recovery today, which is slightly
37.56s: interesting because if you were paying attention to the release of broad economic data,
44.76s: you saw GDP come in quite negative, negative 0.3%. It was consensus at 0.3% or has 0.5%. So this is
59.96s: one of the first actual declines that we've seen like this since I want to say around 2020 or so.
68.04s: So this means, yeah, so it's first declines since early 2022. I mean, so this is driven primarily
77.32s: from imports ahead of tariffs and that absolutely craters net exports. And funny enough,
85.08s: there's actually a little bit of debate going on with the courts regarding Trump's implementation
91.56s: of the tariffs, which is also worth noting. We'll see how that pans out. It looks like Senate
99.24s: badded it down, but we'll see how that all flushes out through the system. Now the market after
106.84s: hours is actually up a little bit. We see Eminis Russell and Nasdaq all up specifically focused,
114.84s: though, within Eminis and Nasdaq Nasdaq leading the group. What's going on here? Well, so far,
120.92s: it looks like some positive post-close earnings. So we'll talk about those in a little bit too,
126.68s: but a couple more economic data points that I think are worth your time. The first one,
132.60s: ADP employment change, quite light. So came in at 62K against the consensus at 115 and
142.92s: forecast of 110. It was about half what it was expected to be. This shows that overall
148.92s: employment is actually starting to slow a little bit. And the reason why this matters is because
157.00s: this is obviously tracking the private sector. So you get a slightly different view of employment
164.36s: unemployment here. And this is growing slower than expected. And there's also the very strong
170.60s: likely impacts of things like automation going forward. And I wonder how this will incorporate
179.32s: all that. By the way, it's not like they're not thinking about that. It's not that big of an impact
183.08s: just yet. Anyways, I'm thinking longer term because it's very likely to see this metric guy down
189.32s: on average in the longer run due to the net probably contraction impact of artificial intelligence
200.04s: integration into different workflows because it will definitely lead to some job hiring.
205.48s: But I think it will lead to broader unwinding realistically. Now, if we take a look at personal
212.76s: income, this came in a little bit better. So the consumer looks to be in a fairly okay spot here.
220.68s: It came in at 0.5%. And you can see compared to what it was essentially year over year-ish,
228.84s: quite a bit, quite a bit different. I think now when we look at this metric more broadly,
238.68s: it's a early warning system when it comes to how the consumer is positioned. So to see income being
246.68s: a little more resilient, however, spending also ticked up a little bit. So we have to see how this
252.68s: flushes out. Overall, I think the main headline on the day is GDP. This is obviously our first look
260.52s: at GDP. And I mean, you can just take a look, right? Like absolute massive, massive change compared
268.36s: to effectively what you've seen since 2022, early 2022 I should add. We have to zoom it out a
274.28s: little bit further to actually see the full effect. So that's the broad economy, not a lot
282.92s: highlight beyond this. Now, tomorrow, Thursday, you have manufacturing, PMI,
289.64s: and then jobless claims. So now let's take a look at some of the bigger stories so-called on the day
296.60s: we'll click in and see just what we recap from bar chart before we take a look at a couple other
302.04s: things if anything jumps out to us here. We get economic news. We know this, stagnation risks,
309.40s: increased undercut stocks after Wednesday's reports. We already know about the GDP move,
315.72s: corporate earnings, Wednesday mixed. I think mixed is, I think that's selling it a little short.
322.36s: I guess super micro did kind of collapse. So I guess, okay, fine. And Norwegian cruise lines,
328.36s: they also collapse 7%. This is actually interesting because Norwegian cruise lines,
336.20s: this might be, let's take a look. This might be reasonable for a fade.
347.08s: So let's take a look at these guys. NCLH.
353.40s: What was it expected at?
364.44s: Be it a little bit, it was expected to come in at two cents. So this is all on the forecast then.
369.24s: The fact that it's down, gap down like this, it is definitely way more to do with forecast than
376.28s: anything. Let's take a look. Inplied volatility percentile still 72%. Big, big, big,
383.08s: vol contraction on the day though relative. This is 1.7 standard deviation down move for vol.
392.84s: And that yesterday was a 1.1 standard deviation down move on vol. So vol is contracting. That's
398.84s: 30 day vol, by the way. And let's take a look at NCLH. Just take a look at the options chain really
405.08s: quick. A little bit of put skew. A lot of activity today on the put side coming in at the offer.
413.40s: So those were being bought. And then also calls being bought though,
417.40s: majority. So I don't necessarily see the market leaning super heavy one way or the other.
422.92s: Has like a quick overview of it. If we take a peek at the broader movement today. Let's see.
432.84s: All I'm doing is I'm seeing if there's a potential post earnings announcement trip to the downside.
437.96s: It doesn't technically qualify. But sometimes in the near term, there can be
444.36s: reasonable continuation to the downside. So like this, I actually don't love for a downside play.
451.40s: The fact that you see call premiums and the day slightly positive means that we're starting
459.80s: we being the broader market starting to bake in potentially a floor, not expecting like a massive
465.40s: velocity continuation to the downside. So nothing there that leads me to think that there's
472.36s: a some sort of great opportunity there. We could then expect to manufacture activity China negative
479.08s: for global growth prospects after once they knew show China's April manufacturing PMI fell. Well,
485.56s: there's a lot of turmoil going on between the US and China from a manufacturing import export
492.20s: dynamic. So this doesn't surprise me. Mortgage applications collapsed actually quite a lot. They
500.92s: came down 4.2%. And the housing market hasn't been quite as topical yet. But there's a good chance
511.16s: that we'll see the housing market become a little more integrated into the broader conversation,
515.56s: especially as the broader market seems to be holding okay. We start looking at other potential
521.72s: leading indicators like movement into housing market and stuff like that. So going back to the
527.48s: broad market though, if we take a look at the primary indices, you will notice that most of them
534.60s: are pretty happy after hours. But take a look at the overall movement here both in spy and QQQ.
542.76s: Both of them are hovering off. And neither one of them are really decisively breaking above
549.72s: these term highs that you have to take out to resume this broader uptrend. Now it's still early
556.20s: right because we're still posting higher lows higher term lows. So that's a good thing. It's a
562.60s: sign of consolidation. But this isn't anything that's knocking my socks off in terms of yeah,
567.32s: this looks like velocity. This still looks like a very edgy market. And you can see that confirmed
572.12s: by volatility still hovering in the mid 20s. This typically doesn't happen if the market is rallying
581.16s: decisively. You normally will see vicks falling off a little bit more. But it's not. And it's because
586.68s: pretty much anything that's going on right now is about the exact opposite from decisive that I
592.36s: could think about. So if we take a look though after hours, some of the drivers, I was just looking at
601.16s: meta, you can see meta actually had pretty solid earnings. They're trading right now at 578, 579
609.96s: closed at 549 right on the nose, which is super rare, kind of fun to see. And they came in at 643
619.40s: expected at 521. So I mean, that's a pretty massive beat. So right now if we just eyeball where this
628.20s: is set to open, if it continues this into tomorrow, it'll be somewhere around here. So pretty
634.04s: significant up move now the game is to see how it reacts after the open to see if that move is
641.08s: sustained or to see if that move starts weakening off. Because again, this is also still very much so
649.56s: in a broad decline, right? So if we look at just this general trend line from where we sit today
658.20s: compared to prior highs, this is absolutely still in this broader downtrend. So that's one name
667.40s: that seems to be doing pretty well after hours. And then another that's my eye was Microsoft.
678.84s: So Microsoft also had really solid earnings. They came in at 346. They were estimated at 320.
691.56s: And after hours right now they're trading at 422 after closing at 395. So 422 literally puts them
699.48s: up here. The big move if this is held tomorrow. So these are really big companies. The propensity
707.08s: for post earnings announcement drift and stuff like that a little bit up in the air. But nonetheless
712.52s: something worth keeping an eye on. Now last couple notes before we just have an open conversation if
718.60s: there's anything that you would like me to take a look at. Last couple notes. One of them is talking
725.72s: about some of our recent earnings plays that were on our hit list. We had three on the hit list for
734.60s: Tuesday PM Wednesday AM. I want to talk about those that came out this morning. The ones they
740.60s: AM group of that. So there was Caterpillar. And this one overall actually was a really
750.60s: solid trade. I'm mentioning this one because I almost chose not to take this trade. And I'll show
757.16s: you why. And it has everything to do with the severity of these prior moves that we see. So you
765.24s: can see that it moved outside the range essentially five times out of the last year or last 12 reports.
771.16s: I should say not last year. And a big difference though is when I'm measuring this I like to wait
778.28s: the near term earnings a little heavier than the really longer term earnings. So the out of the
785.80s: last six releases there was two instances and out of the last four releases there was one.
792.04s: So this isn't anything I would consider like a prime candidate like we've talked about in some
796.12s: other names. But this one stayed with this stayed inside its expected range. WDC is one that did not
805.32s: stay within the expected range. This was tracking in implied move about 7.2%. And if we take a look
814.12s: at WDC, they came in at 7.98. So about eight. So this was a small loss
823.72s: on the short strangle. Not bad. And the reason why it's not bad is because Vols still had a pretty
830.52s: good sympathetic move here. But in the front expiration, I should clarify, longer term Vol actually
838.60s: expanded a little bit, which is a little bit telling, believe it or not. And then a net new add to
844.28s: the list that I typically do not trade is IP. And this one actually looked completely fine.
850.36s: So it moved down 4.09%. Again, this is at the close. This also isn't at the open or midday,
857.32s: which is worth noting because even something like WDC, it didn't do too bad because I didn't wait
864.60s: until the end of the day to close it. But this was an expected move in this one of 8.1%.
870.68s: So about half the expected move, plenty of edge in this trade. And yeah. So now we have our
878.04s: earnings list to take a look at for entries tomorrow, all of the Wednesday PM Tuesday trades,
884.60s: Tuesday AM are already on. So the last group of trades to take a look at are all of the Tuesday PM
891.24s: or Thursday PM trades flash Friday AM. I normally don't like to trade Friday PM, although you
900.28s: you generally will see a couple of them. They're just not my favorite. So this will be the last
905.64s: group of stuff really for this earnings week. So for Tuesday PM, we eyeball this quick. We see
913.40s: Apple. I don't know why I keep saying Tuesday PM. It's Thursday PM. So regardless,
918.60s: that my brain apparently can't grasp that fact, believe. So Apple, AIG, AM Gen,
927.88s: Amazon, BB AI. I'm just eyeballing the names that I generally have a relationship that I might
933.96s: trade. And then I'll go back through if I need to. LUMN will take a look at probably not though
941.08s: MNST almost assuredly not, but we'll look at it, reddit. That's actually one I'm very eager to
947.48s: take a look at riots for sure. We'll look at Roku, sure. TWLO will look at X. We will look at
957.80s: and let's take a look at Friday AM. I see
962.60s: the CVX, DD, XOM, maybe they haven't been as attractive to me. So we'll see if we'll see.
981.40s: But this gives us a pretty good list to start with. So we'll just run through those. I'll run
988.68s: through those later and then I'll share an output with you all on how these end up looking. But
993.64s: that's the broad list that I'm looking at. Last couple notes I think worth mentioning. So I was
1003.00s: eyeballing a potential move from SSO into Upro for the coverage triangle. Not done yet. But I am
1013.00s: starting to eyeball making that switch not for a long term change, but for a shorter term change.
1021.32s: And the main reason for that is because with the size of the down move, I've positioned myself
1028.12s: in SSO in an okay place. But I still expect potential for broader market down move. So by moving
1038.12s: from SSO into Upro, I essentially can maintain the same position that I have on now using a little
1043.88s: bit less money, which gives me greater scaling capability. So it's kind of like what's going on in
1048.20s: T-Triple Q's. It's not time to do it just yet, but it is something that I'm taking a look at.
1054.68s: So that's mostly what we have going on. We're mostly going to be looking at earnings tomorrow and
1061.08s: to see if there's any other random ideas that pop up. So if there's anything that you'd like to
1065.64s: take a look at, feel free to let me know. And then in the meantime, I'm just going to run a run
1071.32s: through a couple scans that I get to see if anything looks interesting. So this one is consecutive
1077.16s: down days. We looked at this recently and something I like to do here is just see if there's
1084.28s: continuation potential for some of these names. So I'm kind of just popping through like this one
1088.36s: right here. So this kind of drift post earnings, although not a ton of move is actually
1095.80s: tradable. And this 173 expected and a miss at 136 is actually advantageous.
1107.00s: Or not necessarily some sort of big giant downside move, but generally for short calls,
1112.92s: the downside to this is if you take a look at the open interest, there's effectively nothing.
1118.60s: There's very little to do here. 2,000 calls against 1,000 puts 56 contracts traded today. So
1125.96s: this trade so thin that I mean, if you had a small account and you were tinkering with like single
1131.88s: lots, maybe, but really nothing to do there. Let's take a look at consecutive updates because there
1140.44s: are a few team us is on our list. And this is following a post earnings gap down on a B.
1152.20s: That's real curious. So this is a leave it alone kind of name. I mean, it's had consecutive
1161.32s: updates. It was great and all for it. But this continues to be the freaking gold mine. The most
1167.16s: unassuming name on planet earth that continues to perform pretty well is Kroger, man, like Kroger
1174.36s: throughout this entire thing. Look at it. Kroger don't care about not tariffs. Kroger continues
1183.80s: to just reliably expand. So this is one I've been trading. It's so slow. It's so boring.
1193.72s: But it's decent from providing a slightly non correlated return source. It's not the most
1199.56s: liquid thing. But in this name, I'm specifically leaning on selling as compared to buying. And it's
1206.76s: just because it really doesn't move that much. Right. So you can even take a look at this reference
1210.92s: move from like 69 to 73. It's not a bad move. But it's not much. So because of that, I prefer just
1218.20s: using some short options. And it's not it's not uncommon to just rotate in and out of positions
1226.04s: in this for me. Let's take a look at just a couple more. I want to look at some of the longer term
1236.60s: performances. So here, let's take a look at one year. This is one year performance up.
1243.08s: Palantir is picking up steam here. So Palantir is scaling back up to term highs. And it has earnings
1254.12s: on the fifth. So we'll have to see how that's panning out. Let's take a look at what the options
1261.24s: positioning into earnings looks like. I mean, just massive call ski relative. And 29% of calls came
1270.04s: above the offer. 32% of the puts came in. Bit or below. So these are just people building out
1278.60s: bullish positions, which is this has been on a tear recently. Right. So if we take a look
1285.64s: over what is this from the seventh of April. So essentially the last month.
1291.80s: It's a 80% move in a month. So bad. So this continues to be a really high growth name. I'm
1304.60s: trading it via long calls. And it's just to get some direct upside exposure, but still not having
1313.16s: a ton of capital out to allocate into some other ideas. So that's what I got for you all today.
1322.84s: As always, if you need anything, you can let me know. Hit me up in the discord. I'm going to go
1326.76s: finish cooking dinner, be an outlier. See you guys later.
