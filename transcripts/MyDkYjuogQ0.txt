444.00s: do
446.00s: I
448.00s: So what's up? Good to see you. Glad that you are in Miramar. That's good. Miramar is
460.20s: right down, not that close, but close enough. I go to the gym there sometimes. What are
465.12s: the other things? Lauren says, I'm still trying to figure it out. That's a fair response.
470.16s: Well, okay. Let's go to the tape and joking side. Let's actually take a look at some of
477.60s: the things people say other places. So let's grab Andy Dandy. Reddit, one of my favorite places
487.04s: for stuff like this. H says the anatomy of how options function and what mechanisms you want
492.48s: to profit from. Cream says, don't risk what you can't afford to lose. I actually like that one
498.56s: so far. None of these are what I would necessarily go with, but I think cream is very close.
507.36s: To where I probably would take it. Jordan says find the right fit options are not always it.
514.96s: That is good. That is good advice. I definitely think that that's something a lot of people skip over.
521.92s: So I'm glad that you mentioned that one as well. When I think about
530.00s: the most important concept for an options trader, the very first thing, because I get people
536.48s: to ask me all the time, a lot of my friends will ask me things like, Eric, how do I do what you do?
543.04s: Can you teach me what you do? And as much as I would love to say yes to those kinds of people,
549.04s: I know the reality of things. And we're going to talk about what the reality of things actually is.
554.80s: And in order to do this whole thing, we need to again go back to what the point of the session
562.08s: today is. And the point of the session today is to give us an orientation on this world of
568.40s: trading and to give us a starting point to have a conversation. So let's do that. What I'm going
573.36s: to do is go on to theta gang and options. And we're literally just going to pull through. We're
578.16s: going to see I literally typed in the word start. And I'm just seeing what advice people give other
585.36s: people when they're looking to start trading options. I haven't looked at this yet. I just grabbed
589.52s: a bunch from right before we started. So let's see. I'm going to let Thor out because I just got home.
602.56s: I got to get like a doggy door for him or some shit. So let's see, this person says, where to
608.72s: start for beginners? It looks like they're looking to get this person as a few years ago.
613.44s: So first comment here, bit advanced. That's fair. There's specific about selling options.
622.80s: Theta gang makes sense. It's fun. I like it. Understand what you're doing. Understanding the
628.96s: basics is important. Start off paper trading. That's good advice. Starting off paper trading.
634.32s: Trying to sell a call, sell a putt singular. Do it again. Something not too expensive from
638.96s: aggressive. Those four plays. So this, this feedback as I just eyeball over it. I think this is way
649.68s: too tactical of a starting point for somebody that says, I'm interested in getting started with
655.60s: investing. I think this is way too tactical. And we'll talk about why that is. Let's click another
660.64s: one. This one says, this is also Theta gang. We'll just poke through this new here. Haven't found
666.96s: any introductory material pins. Basics about options. They're looking to familiarize themselves with
674.80s: trading. This person says, read this book. I don't know what this is, but I'm not clicking it.
683.20s: Tasty trade option alpha. Great beginner material. Mike and his whiteboard series. I like that.
689.36s: Nadenberg's option pricing volatility must have for any serious trader. I don't like what,
695.20s: I don't like this. And it's not because I don't like Nadenberg. I actually like Nadenberg.
699.76s: My guess is this person simply recommending it just to recommend it because they've heard other
704.40s: people recommend it. And they think that you are supposed to recommend it. Otherwise,
709.60s: you're not really an option trader. I, again, I like options pricing and volatility. It's a good book.
715.12s: But I don't inherently think that you have to have it. I think if you are a serious trader,
720.16s: like looking to do this professionally, you definitely should read it. But I think for somebody
724.80s: like in this circumstance, it might not be a great starting point for them. I like the concept
731.12s: about be careful with Reddit advice that is really, really solid of what YouTube gurus
737.76s: anyone touting secret catch all strategy. They're full of shit that is fantastic advice.
742.16s: I love these, I love these, I love these here. And the reason why I love these here is because
749.92s: this is giving slightly higher meta level advice, which is actually think the better starting point.
755.92s: That's the effective foundation for a new options trader. It is nothing to do with options.
761.60s: It has everything to do with understanding this broader scope of the landscape we play in.
768.40s: And we'll talk more about that in a second. One of the things I will say I have changed my mind on
775.52s: is the courses thing. I still have not taken one. I've taken free ones through MIT open course,
782.32s: where in places like that. But one of my friends, Benjamin, from the Benjamin YouTube channel,
788.96s: he and I keep in touch. And I always told him that the courses are kind of bullshit. And he
798.88s: expressed a few courses that he's taken that he's actually gotten significant value out of.
805.52s: So my opinion on it is changing to the degree that I can absolutely see value in a good course
816.80s: emphasis on good course. I think the overwhelming majority of courses that exist are straight trash.
825.04s: And I think that for anybody that's a new option trader, you don't need to pay for a course.
830.56s: You can literally get a good course through MIT open course, where for free.
836.96s: So there's a little more nuance in my opinion. I learn through reading. And I mean,
843.20s: if you think about it, a good course is effectively interactive reading. That's what it should be.
849.36s: But the reality is most of the stuff I've ever come across has been hot trash. But when I was
854.88s: talking to Benjamin about it, I understood his perspective and I can adopt that as part of my
860.64s: paradigm now. But there's no reason to pay, especially if you're a brand new options trader,
865.44s: there's no reason to pay for a course. You literally can go take free stuff online through
871.04s: really reputable institutions via open courseware and just get a good start there. So I actually like
876.96s: that. All right, let's click through a couple more. This one says is $1,000 enough.
881.36s: This is a terrible answer.
892.24s: This is also a terrible answer. These are bad answers. The reason why these are bad answers
898.24s: is literally the way that they're saying to start trading calls and puts literally the way
903.12s: that they frame that tells me they're not ready. The fact that you would say these words in this
910.48s: way immediately tells me that you are very new and you probably should take a little more time
917.36s: to learn with respect to is it $1,000 enough enough is whatever, right? Like you can start with
923.60s: $0 in paper trade. So I don't really care about the dollar amount. I do still think that the more
929.52s: money you can start with provided that you have a good foundation, the safer you actually can be
934.48s: because your portfolio isn't inherently in a compromised position. But starting with more money
940.16s: is risky because a lot of people start before they're ready and blow up their money. So by starting
943.60s: with a smaller amount of money, you really manage your maximum drawdown potential. So it's kind of
949.52s: pick your poison in that sense. I actually think starting with more capital, but after a longer
956.32s: period, paper trading is probably slightly more efficacious than this. A couple more.
962.72s: 50,000 savings start trading options safely. I don't want to use all 50 for options, which
968.08s: strategy is better for safe trades. Again, by the phrasing of this, this person needs the paper
974.00s: trade. They're not even ready to start trading for a quote unquote safe trade. So I want to target
978.64s: average to return 2% return on risk monthly. That's actually a good caveat. I like that they said
984.96s: 2% return on risk because that's actually way more achievable, especially for a new trader.
990.08s: 2% return on your risk is not crazy for a new trader to be returning 2% on the portfolio
998.48s: every month. They'd still doable, but for a new trader's probably not going to happen.
1002.88s: But for return on risk, it's much more doable. But let's see, there's no such thing as safe options.
1010.40s: I actually disagree with that. I think there absolutely are. Getting 2% is very, very
1014.72s: unachievable in my opinion. If it was all hedge fund managers would be doing it, these are the
1018.64s: worst comparisons on earth. So this is again, somebody that knows a little bit, but really is missing
1026.16s: a lot. The concept of if it was all hedge fund managers would be doing it is kind of silly.
1036.48s: And it's just because I agree with their broader point of returning 2% and safely, depending on
1044.32s: what safely means, they don't really go along with one another. However, this they're talking about
1052.40s: 2% compounded month over month. And the compounding calculation, I actually like that.
1058.64s: But the issue is they're applying a lot of like bullshit interpolation. This is one thing I've
1063.36s: learned from just interacting online is everybody is lazy as an interactor. They lazily express
1071.28s: their ideas strictly from their own paradigm without taking any time to consider what the other
1077.60s: people might read. And then when we're reading other people's stuff, we then lazily interpolate
1083.52s: it in our own paradigm without taking the time to understand where the other person is coming from.
1088.32s: Why do I say that here? This says, safely, this person is now drawing safely equals risk free.
1096.00s: They didn't say without risk. They said safely. They're two different things. But this person
1101.20s: just kind of like reading what they want. The other thing that they're reading is 2% compounded
1105.76s: on the portfolio. The point is this is the exact kind of advice. This is the common shit people
1111.44s: are going to see when they're trying to figure out where to start. This is if you could start over
1117.04s: what you would what would you do different buying options sold them? I don't hate that. That one's
1121.20s: okay. Allocation 5% of my account on any single trade. I don't like that advice.
1129.44s: Work on trading completely divorce from emotion as a priority from day one. I like the idea
1136.00s: I don't like the way that they frame it. These still aren't really what matters for a new
1146.40s: option straighter in my opinion. This is about specific risk management protocols for a specific
1152.96s: strategy. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it's very specific. The idea of being
1157.68s: completely divorced from emotion is bullshit. You cannot be. So this immediately is giving
1163.36s: somebody a task that is quite literally unachievable. You cannot be completely divorced from
1168.32s: emotion. What your job is as a trader and this is something we spend a lot of time in the military
1173.04s: working on is managing emotions. That's not suppressing. That's not ignoring. That's not pretending
1179.04s: it doesn't exist. That's not divorcing from them. It's understanding them. And then when they come
1184.80s: managing them, mitigating them, that's a completely different thing. The reason why this is the
1189.92s: wrong scenario is because let's say you actually follow this advice and then you got emotional during
1196.64s: a trade. You notice some sort of emotionality. Then you sit there and you start saying to yourself
1200.88s: things like, well, fuck, I can't get rid of this emotion. I'm supposed to be a robot. I'm supposed
1205.04s: to be completely divorced from this emotion. How am I going to do this? I can't seem to grasp how
1210.88s: to just get rid of my emotions. And fun fact, you fucking can't. That's why it's bad advice.
1216.72s: The rest of this, let's see, where to start.
1225.12s: This looks fine. I don't know. They're just giving them like good, good direction. I like that.
1232.40s: 20-year-old starting with $1,000. Let's see. Listen to everyone on here that says, start with
1236.40s: long-term stocks. Open a paper-training account and use that to learn options.
1240.08s: That's pretty fucking solid, be honest. When you say, fuck all that good advice, I'm going to trade
1249.84s: options anyway. That's fucking accurate. Start by selling options, not buying them. I don't love that.
1255.84s: Learn basic credit and put spreads. Call credit spreads, iron condors. Don't get greedy. 4%
1261.04s: return per week would be great. What the fuck? We've gone off the rails. We've gone entirely off
1269.12s: the rails. Research as much as you can, watch as many tutorials as you can. I think that's generally
1276.40s: okay. I actually don't hate this first one. The reason why I like this first one a lot is because
1283.60s: it takes some of the pressure, takes some of the weight off. And I noticed that a lot, especially
1289.44s: with coaching clients and stuff like that, where people feel like they're far behind.
1294.16s: And then they're trying to do stuff quickly to get caught back up. That's a terrible mentality
1298.96s: to approach the world of trading from, which we're actually going to talk a little bit more about
1302.96s: mentality. But to summarize all of what we looked at, this is what people are receiving from other
1310.08s: people when they're asking the question of effectively, how should I start? How should I start
1316.56s: trading? And what should I do? What should I do to start with? And again, it's a mixed bag,
1323.68s: but I would say on balance, it's not really great here. And the reason is because a lot of these
1333.84s: kinds of people that are giving this advice, they are the group that typically are at a point
1340.40s: where they should be focusing more on learning themselves versus trying to instruct and teach
1345.36s: other people. Again, that's not always the case. Like you can give really good advice and guidance
1351.76s: even as somebody that's brand new to something. But what happens is you get these really skewed
1359.20s: contexts from people baked into the responses and something like this start by selling options.
1365.28s: That is so skewed. That is so skewed. I don't, I think that's don't even start by even
1372.64s: worrying about options as somebody already directly pointed out in the chat, which I do agree with,
1378.16s: if you're at that point in the stages, start thinking about stuff like profit mechanisms before
1384.00s: you even concern yourself with what option strategy, whether I buy or sell. It's a little too
1391.20s: off kilter for the beginning because again, you have to remember by even starting this,
1396.40s: we're skipping some really, really important stuff, which we're going to talk about.
1401.04s: So the first thing here is let's talk about the landscape of trading.
1407.92s: The landscape of financial markets in general, let's say, is that they're highly complex,
1414.96s: super competitive. And when I refer to the concept of open here, what I mean is that it is just you
1425.68s: walking off and being a money manager. That's what you are. When you trade your own account,
1432.08s: when you invest or trade, you're a money manager. Now you're not managing other people's money,
1436.64s: but you're managing your own money. You're now a money manager, which is always interesting to me,
1442.00s: because if I am sick, I definitely do my best to do my own research. But then I typically try to
1449.92s: find somebody that is more knowledgeable than I am to then figure out what's actually wrong with me
1455.84s: and maybe what I should be doing. It's the same thing what happened with my hernated disc. I literally
1460.40s: flew out to Florida across the fucking country to go see somebody that I respected and think is a
1468.00s: better information source on that injury. So the openness becomes a lot of people's downfalls,
1476.32s: because there really isn't a lot of structure out there. So it is something to pay attention to.
1484.24s: And it's something that you should really, really guard against. So what I mean by that is it's
1490.24s: guarding against the impulse to just start doing shit by taking the time to take a step back
1498.56s: and thinking through what you're trying to do and then building at least a rudimentary plan
1505.28s: on how to get there is going to work a lot better. But I want to linger on this point of the stock
1510.88s: market landscape a little bit more. And specifically this one. So if we look across the different
1518.32s: entities and markets and stuff, there's a lot of them. And this isn't even close to a comprehensive
1525.36s: list. This is literally just to give an idea of what's out there. And one of the most important
1532.80s: things to draw from as you look at this list of different participants and what the participants
1541.44s: might be doing. That's where you are, by the way, in the little retail trader space here. And
1551.92s: you can see how much money these other institutions put into doing to literally playing in the same
1561.20s: landscape that we do. This is what happens when you go to the Olympics. What countries typically
1567.12s: win the Olympics? It's kind of the fucking same ones. And if you look at the countries that tend to
1572.48s: win the Olympics, they tend to be countries that have pretty good resourcing. So when you have
1579.12s: these other countries that don't inherently have the same resourcing that are dealing with a smaller
1584.40s: population, trying to put out their best and be as competitive as they can be, it's much more
1589.68s: challenging. But they're competing in the same landscape as these other entities that can spend
1595.20s: tons of money on their Olympic programs. The analogy there is designed to try and give you a
1602.32s: little bit of context about like we are the third world countries that are just eating rice because
1609.68s: it's accessible. And we're running the de-Cathalon against other countries that have near unlimited
1618.72s: resources. Just about give or take. So you start from a disadvantaged position and it's really,
1630.40s: really important to know and accept that. So now let's take a look at the starting point for traders.
1641.92s: Most traders come into the market desperate because they want to make money. They're hopeful
1648.40s: that they might make money. They're misguided in what they've heard their friends say about that one
1653.76s: stock that they bought in a doubled in two days. They don't know what they don't know. So they're
1659.12s: ignorant. Like we all are when we start something new and most of us are impatient. Just like that
1663.92s: example you saw in that how to start look at just 4% per week. Don't be greedy. Don't be greedy.
1672.08s: Greedy is bad but you know target something more humble like a 4% weekly return compounded. And
1680.48s: the polarity of that is it's a 669% return. That's what that humble return of 4% per week is.
1692.64s: So again we're starting this from the exact wrong spot. So let's take a break right now.
1701.44s: And let's think about what we've covered so far from the broad landscape.
1705.84s: We know that markets are complex. They're competitive and it's not the fast easy money that you
1711.28s: thought it was going to be. We know that our starting point tends to be skewed from a bunch of
1717.92s: different factors. So now the question becomes what is a good starting point? What is a good place
1726.64s: to start? And this is again about options trading. But in this level of the conversation there's
1733.20s: not a lot to talk about with respect to options. It really isn't because we are focusing on the
1741.20s: foundation. What actually will create a sustainable thing? When I approach these conversations
1750.56s: about trading you have to remember I have seen hundreds of people come and go. Hundreds. I mean
1759.36s: thousands even. I don't pay attention quite that close to thousands but definitely hundreds
1765.68s: that I've actually followed along with either known directly or slightly and directly. And I've
1770.88s: seen them come and go. And it's because of a lot of these other factors are all misplaced.
1777.68s: The very first thing I think is a good starting point or an aspiring options trader
1784.56s: is to talk about these expectations. What do you think is going to happen?
1793.12s: For that person that says that they want to start trading safely. What's that mean?
1800.40s: Maybe it's possible. Maybe it's not. But we need to understand the expectations.
1805.60s: As we go through outlining our expectations as a new trader it's going to add a lot of clarity
1816.24s: around what we're doing. What I mean really what we hope to do. So here is what I typically tell people
1826.08s: with respect to how to set good expectations. One to two years,
1836.24s: greater than zero. This equals rock star.
1843.68s: Literally nobody likes hearing that because it is about as unsexy as it can get. Don't lose money.
1859.36s: And you think like man two years what the fuck. I'm going to sit here and just try to not lose
1865.52s: money for two years. Yeah. Definitely. And I always go back to the landscape. You are competing
1876.72s: in the adult arena. There's no kiddie starting place. There is no training wheels. You are out
1884.96s: there in the open with everybody else. So again, going back to the Olympics conversation.
1892.24s: You as a brand new trader just going out there trying to trade and get this really big return is
1898.24s: literally the same as maybe a high school athlete attempting to compete directly in the Olympics.
1905.04s: And winning. Some might be able to. There are physical
1910.32s: phenomena like that every once in a great while. I'm not really sure how many high school people
1915.68s: compete at like a high level and do well. I'm not that familiar with the Olympics. But I would
1919.28s: imagine it would be infrequent. However, when we're first starting options trading,
1932.16s: the reason why your expectations should be greater than zero is because this is not your focus
1938.40s: in terms of how much money you're making. How much money you're making is a new options trader
1942.72s: literally doesn't matter yet. It doesn't. It sounds crazy to say it, but it doesn't. The reason why it
1948.16s: doesn't is because you have other things you have to focus on. So let's talk about some of these
1954.88s: other things that you have to focus on such as. Let's just think about and throw them in the chat
1965.44s: as well to help me brainstorm some of these. But as a new options trader, what are some of the things
1970.64s: you have to learn? Right? Let's just spit ball them. What are some of the things you have to learn
1975.84s: as an options trader? There's a bunch I can think of, but let's see what you have. And it can be
1981.12s: really anything. Just think of the lens from a brand new options trader. What are some of the things
1988.00s: that you have to pick up the Greeks? That's correct.
1996.48s: We already saw on the other one, we need to pick up return potential.
2006.56s: Because that new person got advice from somebody that's like, just don't be greedy and do 4% per week,
2012.88s: which is a 669% annual return. That's not fucking realistic.
2018.96s: Reese says flow of the markets. So kind of.
2025.92s: Market structure. Well, everything froze. Market structure.
2030.32s: And operations.
2039.12s: Each says how they work and when to use different strategies profit mechanisms. So kind of different
2045.60s: strategies.
2051.68s: Lauren says profit mechanisms.
2054.08s: Ems.
2057.92s: Lauren Titty, what up says risk management.
2065.76s: Prem is exactly going the next direction I was thinking, which is just analysis, not even necessarily
2071.60s: just options. But that's exactly correct. How to read an options chain. How to do other basic
2078.88s: analysis. So again, think think of what we're saying right now. We're saying a new trader has to
2088.32s: do. And this is a short list. This is a summary list of things. This is a short list of shit
2095.60s: that an options trader needs to learn. Let's just pick one to zoom in just for funsies. Let's pick
2102.56s: the reason one. How to read an option chain. I just didn't video on that.
2109.84s: I'll throw a link into the notes for you guys. The reason why reading an options chain is funny
2120.80s: because it's also timely is because one of the like reading an options chain was a 16-minute video
2134.16s: that I made a 17 video that is designed to cut out all of the ancillary stuff and to give you
2142.16s: a to Z everything to at least have a starting understanding. It's a 17-minute video for context.
2148.64s: The reason why I'm harping on that is because most content style videos like instructional and
2153.28s: stuff like that are like eight minutes. But that's me cutting stuff out trying to make it digestible.
2160.56s: So in order to read an options chain, you have to understand what a bit is, what an offer is.
2168.48s: You have to know what a strike is. You have to know what an expiration is.
2175.52s: You have to know what a midpoint is. You have to know what size is with respect to what's offered.
2182.48s: You have to know what a premium is in how to read a premium. So if we're talking about something
2187.52s: zooming into something like how to read a premium, this is now where we get into multipliers.
2194.64s: You also need to be able to read things like delta. And I'm not talking at a mastery level.
2200.80s: This is like a rudimentary understanding level. Delta, gamma, data, Vega.
2209.28s: So as you click into something like delta, for example, we now understand that there's in the money
2217.92s: out of the money, at the money. This is a completely foreign concept that you have to learn. And it's
2224.40s: also inverse for calls and puts. We also know that delta has a different behavior over time.
2232.40s: Because if we plot a time series, I guess delta can't be negative time series for delta.
2241.28s: And let's use delta level here. And then we have time. And let's start with t zero to t 100.
2254.08s: And this is delta for an at the money option. Or let's do a out of the money option, like maybe
2260.32s: 5% out of the money. Either way, well, what ends up happening is as we get closer to expiration,
2268.96s: delta you'll notice actually decays. Oh shit. I don't know shit about charm. Guess what? You now
2278.32s: just got introduced to another Greek to a second order Greek charm.
2283.84s: What I'm showing you is that this is one single fucking talk track from one single component
2295.44s: of one single stage that a new trader has to learn. All of this just stem from how to read a
2303.60s: fucking options chain. And you're now swimming around in the world trying to figure out what the
2309.20s: fuck is charm. What an insane series of tasks that a new trader has to complete. So going back to
2322.08s: this landscape analysis, just think about how much a new options trader needs to do yet. We're so
2330.64s: focused on how much money we're going to make where it doesn't it literally doesn't fucking matter.
2337.60s: You have to get all of this other stuff down first before you're even remotely concerned
2343.28s: with how much money you might make because you need to learn the tools of what you're doing.
2348.88s: A great example for this is if you are a jujitsu practitioner and you go as a brand new white belt
2357.28s: one week into training and then you decide I'm going to go compete, which is very cool. By the way,
2363.68s: it's a great genuinely is a great decision. But when you go to compete, your your target is to
2371.60s: submit everybody to win all of your matches through via submission. Again, guess what probably ain't
2381.68s: happening even remotely that if somebody that's new to jujitsu asks me like, Hey Eric, you
2390.16s: recommend going to a competition early. Why is that? It's for the experience and it's to get it
2394.88s: out of the way to get your first competition jitters out of the way doing it as a white belt.
2399.04s: There's no expectations of you. It's a really safe place to go get that first one done.
2404.24s: You get rid of all the pregame jitters. You have an idea of what the process looks like. So that is
2408.72s: you continue competing over time. It's not like this big thing that now you're nervous about even
2413.12s: though you might be good. You have to get over the nerves. You just knock that out right out of the gate.
2417.84s: The reality of that white belt going to that jujitsu competition and subbing anybody let alone
2425.20s: everybody is about zero. So a new trader having a healthy focus early on is absolutely vital to their
2438.88s: long-term success because what's uncomfortable to face for all new traders is that the results of
2446.40s: your initial trades literally don't matter. They straight up don't matter. The results of your
2451.84s: first few years of trading really don't matter because you are laying the groundwork for something
2458.24s: that's way more important. You're laying the groundwork on how to be organized, how to develop a
2466.16s: process. If somebody asks me what is the defining factor for whether or not somebody is able to
2476.40s: be successful as an option trader. It is literally these two boiled down to this.
2496.32s: The ability to iterate into optimize that is what entirely boils down your successes and
2509.44s: option trader. There is nothing else that becomes more important than this because if you are capable
2520.00s: of successfully iterating that means you can receive feedback from some sort of activity as a
2526.56s: trader. You can integrate that into your planning. You can then run your next iteration with that
2533.04s: new integration. You can then get the next series of feedback and you can continue this cycle of
2539.20s: iteration because here's what happens when people say like oh you need to master how to trade an
2545.92s: opening range breakout. Sure that could be a viable strategy. That doesn't matter. Literally
2551.60s: doesn't matter because your ability to just shoot from the hip and run an opening range breakout
2558.64s: approach without running into problems is about zero as a new trader because here's what happens during
2565.12s: this process here. We have an action. There's going to be an outcome. There should be an analysis
2580.56s: and then this is where optimization slash iteration is. This cycle is effectively what allows you
2598.16s: to figure shit out as a trader. So if you have an action where you oversize the trade,
2606.40s: undersize the trade, whatever it is, if you have a good process and you can ingest that outcome
2616.88s: and objectively identify what the fuck happened, then you can make logical refinements that
2626.08s: eventually will literally walk you onto target eventually. It's not about being able to trade like
2634.64s: a robot. What ends up happening is if you can adopt this process driven mindset, you inherently stop
2641.92s: caring about the outcome of any one individual trade. You now are already innately managing your
2650.24s: emotions because you're not hyper focused on the outcome. You care more about your application of
2657.28s: a process. So in my opinion, the most important thing for a new trader to keep in mind for laying
2666.72s: a healthy foundation is setting good expectations. If you can set good expectations, it's literally what
2674.24s: leads to the rest of this cycle. That eventually is what we expect to lead to the ultimate success of
2682.96s: the trader. But the funny thing is if traders actually adopted this kind of thing,
2690.64s: the entertaining part to me is all of the questions start to shed, meaning should I buy options
2697.52s: or should I sell options? Should I go 60 days out? Should I go 40 days out? All of those questions
2704.24s: start to go away. If you conduct an action, observe the outcome, analyze it and then iterate off
2711.20s: of what you've learned from that cycle. Does that mean you have to do it with real money? No.
2715.68s: Everybody here already knows that I am an evangelist for paper trading. And it's because I think it
2721.36s: literally is the optimal way to learn most of this stuff. But this to me is the actual foundation
2730.80s: for successfully being able to learn to trade options. Notice how very little of this has
2736.16s: really anything to do with options. And it's because it doesn't matter yet. If you're trying to build
2741.76s: a successful approach, you get into the details of options, how to integrate them later.
2750.40s: But in order to be able to even healthily be able to do that and to get something out of it that's
2756.16s: usable for you, this is where we start. We start by managing our expectations and developing a focus.
2763.44s: I have a post. I'll show it to you on Reddit.
2772.24s: And it's a similar post style thing to what I have on my website. Get rid of all that stuff.
2779.28s: So on my website, the very first thing under there is a options trading guide.
2797.68s: Here.
2798.72s: I kind of optimized for mobile view. So it looks kind of silly here. But it's literally a step by
2811.44s: step list of things in order that I think makes sense in order to build a successful relationship
2821.68s: with trading option. And then I have another that's actually even more in depth that includes things
2829.76s: like sub topics like what to focus on in different time frames. So here it's this is that structure
2840.16s: phase. And this is just a proposed structure. This isn't the structure. This isn't the right way to do
2846.72s: it again. It's really going to be up to you. But what I'm showing you is the importance of this
2852.64s: segment here. Your ability to focus your efforts, especially that's a new issue today that didn't
2859.92s: exist when I was trading is you guys now deal with information overload, which I'm not even
2867.52s: suggesting is like some sort of easy problem to deal with, especially if you're highly analytical
2871.92s: or trying to figure out the quote unquote best thing to do. This is actually like a really
2878.32s: frustrating problem to try to deal with without a doubt. Like I truly truly believe that. So I don't
2886.24s: envy the the difficulty that's baked into this because it is absolutely challenging. That being said,
2894.40s: it is absolutely manageable. And it is something that you can work your way through. So
2901.44s: I'm going to take a pause on all of that. And I just want to have a conversation with you guys.
2905.76s: And I want to understand, especially for the newer traders on where are you right now
2913.20s: in your options trading career, meaning do you feel like you're starting to get it? Are you
2920.24s: brand new? And then the second question I want to know is what are you working on right now?
2926.24s: My goal by asking this is literally to spend another 15 minutes with you guys talking about your
2932.32s: specific scenario and trying to give you some direct feedback on based on where you're at and what
2939.12s: you're trying to work on. If what you're working on may or may not make sense in some different
2943.04s: ways to think about what you're working on. So now we have an open chat style conversation that is
2950.32s: intent for the rest of the stream. Ayo, Cryptado, thank you so much for the dinner supply. We haven't
2958.08s: figured out what we're doing for dinner yet. So if you guys have any recommendations, let me know.
2962.56s: I don't really know what I'm feeling. I'll have to have to manifest off to think on it,
2968.48s: figure out what what I literally have no idea what I would want for dinner. We'll see.
2973.68s: So for those, especially for those newer traders, I definitely want to know what you're trying to
2984.64s: work on right now so that literally we can talk about it. And hopefully see if we can have some
2990.32s: breakthroughs. That's what I would love to do. Let me get caught up. Roryntady says, Charm, what the
2998.08s: fuck is that? That's a great question. That's a fantastic question. So if we take a look at our
3004.00s: handy bandied man, this, this PowerPoint thing is getting kind of crazy. Good lord this.
3016.80s: So Charm, as you can tell, is a second order Greek. Essentially we refer to it as Delta decay.
3024.88s: It's the rate of change of Delta due to the passage of time.
3029.92s: If I were to think about some of the more important second order Greeks, really it's these three.
3035.92s: Gamma, Charm and Vanna. Volga can matter if you're trading a lot of like really big vol. But these
3043.68s: three is what I would spend time focusing on. And then like third order Greeks, they're good to know.
3050.24s: But you really don't have to worry about them quite that much color. I do think matters. But
3056.48s: yeah, I mean, I, I don't, there's even more than this believe it or not. But these are the ones that I,
3062.56s: I use the most. And of these that I use the most really row is I barely use row. But Delta, Theta,
3070.40s: Vega, Gamma, Charm, Vanna. Don't care about Vera, Veda, Volga and Vama. All of those count color speed.
3080.56s: Ultima and Zama. So anyways, Charm effectively Delta decay. I wanted to think about it.
3090.72s: Damn, this, this is kind of crazy. So what I've, what I've started doing is moving out of
3096.16s: Critta. And I'm starting to move more into this slide deck because I think it's kind of fun to
3102.16s: have like a million slides and hear about pretty much anything that we're going to use. So that's the
3107.04s: goal. H says getting practice in adding options to my buy and hold portfolio. Lots of practicing,
3114.40s: selling calls to get a hold of short premium strategies, moving to short strangles,
3121.76s: been using a small percent for long calls. Trying to optimize credit received on the short
3128.00s: trades versus the risk and learning to get better at managing feels like I do too much when I should
3133.84s: do nothing and not enough when I should act. That's a fascinating, that's a fascinating analysis.
3141.76s: There's a couple of things that I think of. The first question I would have for you H is what
3149.52s: is the goal of adding options to your buy and hold portfolio? As you know, I am a really big
3158.16s: fan of beginning with the end in mind. So by clearly defining what we're trying to achieve
3166.00s: through in this case adding options to the buy and hold portfolio, we can actually gain a lot of
3171.52s: clarity around what we're trying to do. Because I think there's quite a lot to pull away from
3185.12s: there. So I'm happy to dive into that a little bit with you. But that's my first question for you.
3192.48s: Is how do options even fit into your broader trading approach? What are you trying to do there?
3206.32s: Your response matters because let's say for example, you're trying to use options for leverage.
3213.60s: Or let's say that you're trying to use options to reduce risk. Or you're trying to use options to
3220.40s: amplify an existing buy and hold position. There's like a million things that you could conceivably do.
3228.64s: I was literally talking with a friend earlier today about a position that they have.
3233.92s: And they're holding shares of a stock that they really like. And they ended up selling a string
3241.12s: of calls over the last few weeks. And it's like, they're all pretty deep in the money now.
3248.80s: And I was asking how many calls did you sell against the shares? And they said, well,
3254.64s: they're all covered because they were learning about a covered call. And then I asked, I was like,
3260.16s: oh, interesting. I was like, so are you like trying to get rid of your shares? And they said, no,
3265.04s: I don't want to get rid of my shares. So then I'm sitting there thinking to myself,
3270.00s: that's kind of backwards. Why would you sell calls on all the shares if you're trying to keep your shares?
3276.48s: And that it's like that kind of lapse simply from not starting from first principles,
3282.40s: which is again, defining what we're trying to do. So H says the goal is to reduce drawdown slash
3287.44s: generate income on top of my holdings. The income being to size up and eventually leverage the
3293.36s: position via timing, rotating in and out of options and equity. Okay, that makes sense.
3297.84s: So then when we think about reducing drawdown in generating income, those two things are slightly
3305.92s: counter opposing. So then the next question for you is which one of those matters more. And then
3313.84s: by going through this kind of exercise, you can very clearly literally dial in exactly what makes
3322.72s: the most sense. When you hear me talking about trading and you hear me talk about this idea of
3328.48s: getting backed into a trade, it's effectively this because let's say let's go through the trade
3336.48s: process up here. It's a great example that's somewhere in here. Don't worry. I don't know where it is,
3344.32s: but it's somewhere in here. So notice how I start by just looking at the portfolio.
3353.60s: The reason why this matters is let's think about the different strategies that I trade.
3361.04s: Most of you are familiar with most of them. So I'm not going to list them all out. But I effectively
3365.28s: has stuff to trade most directions. So the war is literally just sitting outside my door. That's
3375.12s: hilarious. Mel just sent me a picture of them. So the way that we know though is that I have something
3384.64s: that I use for pretty much all different market conditions, right? So bullish bearish volatility,
3390.64s: okay. So let's start with this portfolio fit idea. Let's use literally what the portfolio looked
3396.96s: like earlier this week. It's a fantastic example because it's very current. So I had recently gotten
3403.12s: back from traveling last week, I think. I don't remember. I think it was last week. And before I go to
3409.36s: travel, I typically have a generally blank slate, not blank slate in that all my trades come off,
3415.28s: but I pretty much just keep my course stuff on. So then when I got back from traveling,
3422.32s: my imperative when I looked at the portfolio was I need risk. Okay, that doesn't help me much,
3432.40s: but it does tell me that I need to use some money. So then the next thing I need to figure out
3438.48s: is what do I think about the broad market? What is my current broad market assumption?
3447.28s: And based on this, I essentially need to overlay all of those other details. So for example,
3458.56s: this really starts from this stage here where we're thinking about how something will fit into
3465.84s: the portfolio based on the broad market assumption. So here, essentially, I would say before you begin
3473.36s: the scanning process in this stage, we need to assess market. I guess it's really not even
3483.52s: assess, it's just analyze. So this would be analyze the market, create a hypothesis, then we would
3506.72s: begin the scanning process and ask, how does this trade fit with the portfolio?
3517.92s: I like that. So after I looked at the portfolio and I say, I need risk, I conduct that market analysis.
3528.96s: And as I'm looking at the market, I'm saying, well, short term price up, short term price is going up,
3534.56s: longer term, there's a lot of pressure. So I don't really have an opinion, but I favor the
3538.48s: downside right now. So what does that tell me? Well, as I look at the overall portfolio, I'm long
3544.64s: beta-weighted delta's to spy. So I'm overall long, but that kind of contradicts my longer term idea
3552.80s: here. So then what I start doing is I start looking for other kinds of things that fit the broad
3558.88s: portfolio based on this idea. So by clearly defining upfront, not by going out looking at the
3566.48s: market, I do that anyways, but by literally starting the process from a point of what does the
3572.64s: portfolio need based on my current overall market assessment and the current portfolio construction,
3579.68s: I can naturally back myself into different things. So like, for example, am I going to go out there
3583.76s: and sell puts on spy? No, I know that. Am I going to go out there and start selling short puts or
3589.44s: long calls on any of the mag seven? No. And it's because I'm already exposed to them via SSO T
3596.16s: triple cues, which is the bulk of the portfolio that I'm sharing with you guys right now, the model
3600.64s: coverage triangle portfolio. So that risk is already there. So I already know I need to look in
3605.92s: other places. So when you clearly define these things, it literally naturally starts limiting some
3611.12s: of your selection criteria. It makes the problem so much easier to solve. So that's the purpose
3619.76s: of that definition phase. So for H, that's literally what I think is next is going through and
3626.48s: running that from A to Z. And then once you get to the bottom of that, you can then figure out what
3632.24s: kind of positions make the most sense. So H says, I want to keep the shares build a position
3638.40s: as comfortable trading in and out. I guess the income generation. But to have dry powder and you
3644.08s: see like you notice how you use the phrase, I guess, it means it's not to find. And that's the exact
3650.56s: kind of thing. This is exactly the kind of thing that I work through in the coaching calls is to try
3656.40s: and make sure that everything that we're doing is aligned with the broader objective. And then
3662.16s: we dial in and drill in deep on how to figure like how to actually execute. But that process of
3670.08s: figuring out how to execute really becomes very simple once you have everything pretty clearly
3675.60s: defined. So going back to H's example, understanding if I care more about generating income or
3682.00s: reducing risk, because what I would tell you is that short calls are a terrible way to reduce risk.
3687.04s: It's a really common misconception. People say like, oh, sell calls to reduce the risk on the portfolio.
3694.00s: And it's not wrong in the sense that it can help. But it's not like this. It's really not the primary
3701.44s: purpose of what that is. So let's take a look at a company. Let's take a look at Nvidia. And
3708.56s: let's go back in time. Let's go back to the 14th of April. And let's take a look at
3720.80s: this scenario operationalized. We're going to go to 14 Feb.
3729.20s: And let's say that we wanted to buy shares.
3738.32s: And we'll track them in here for the sake of this example.
3750.16s: Now this one's good. This really doesn't have anything.
3753.60s: So let's say we have whatever size portfolio. Let's say that you have $100,000 portfolio.
3760.24s: That's our go-to. I need to clear all the formatting so that I don't have to redo this for everything.
3768.32s: Okay. Or I still need to do that. Why? Just clear the formatting, bro.
3776.00s: This percentage is whatever. Okay. So we have $100,000 right now in videos trading at 136.
3784.00s: 61. And let's say that we just want to essentially consume the portfolio here. So we'll get 732 shares.
3792.80s: Obviously you can't. Well, you can have partials, but you shouldn't. Partials are a complete bullshit thing.
3806.32s: So you have your 732 shares. It means we can sell up to seven calls. So let's do kind of standard
3812.64s: protocol. We go out 35 days. We go to like a 30 Delta here. 153s.
3822.96s: So we're going to have the 153 strike. The premium on those is 442. Notice what I'm doing here,
3831.84s: by the way, for this entire exercise. I'm literally doing it in Google Sheets. I'm not, I don't have
3840.00s: to paper trade on here at all. I look at it to get the pricing, but literally don't have to
3845.52s: paper trade on here at all. Just a note. So here we have a seven lot. That's seven lot.
3857.44s: Obviously covers 700 of these shares. So let's see how much money we take in.
3863.44s: 3094. Okay. So now let's just take a look at what this overall looks like. 732, 732.
3883.60s: So let's analyze this. And then we're saying that we're going to be short. Seven of these.
3895.36s: Here. And I always forget I have to change one of these. I just don't remember which one.
3902.56s: Think this one. And today, yeah, beautiful. And let's get rid of these extra prices.
3912.16s: Get rid of the noise. So what do you notice here? If we buy at spot price right here at
3921.84s: 136, 61. And we use the short calls. And you've heard that if you do that with short calls,
3931.36s: you get a bit of a hedge to the downside. Which again is not fully wrong. But how far to the
3937.04s: downside does this actually help you? Well, you can literally just effectively take this off
3944.00s: from whatever your basis is. And that's when you're going to start to be in trouble. So if you
3949.52s: take a look at where your break even is here, that like 132, 36 ish, right? So literally all we're
3957.04s: doing is taking our cost basis less the overall premium received. So our cost basis is 136.
3968.40s: We know that we're going to get protection in this case down to 132. Protection being we would make
3974.40s: money off of the short calls enough. So let's see what kind of downside move we can absorb.
3981.92s: 3.4% down move. That's your downside protection. This is why short calls are not good for downside
3988.88s: protection. For a retail trader to even give a shit about hedging a 3.4% downside move is completely
3999.84s: folly. So this is not to talk out against short calls, short calls and covered calls and ratio
4007.52s: covered calls are great. But again, this goes back to setting good expectations and clearly defining
4012.64s: what the fuck we're trying to do. And the use case for short calls in this context, sure, it does
4020.64s: absolutely scrub a little bit of downside, but it scrubs so little downside that it effectively
4026.56s: doesn't even register that it's scrubbing downside. It doesn't fucking matter because the time
4031.36s: that you need this protection is not when the stock is down 3.4%. It's when it's down 15 fucking
4038.32s: percent. So let's take a look at what happens as we go forward. And we'll just go to like March 25th
4048.32s: because I like that number. And the stock is now at 120. So what's happened here? Well, pretty simple.
4060.64s: Right now you are enjoying a $12,000 loss. You did get to keep this premium. You're still down
4074.72s: 9 grand. Sick bro. Fucking awesome. Right. So if we look at this as a percentage, you're still down
4087.76s: pretty big. And again, if we just compare the difference between these, you'll find this as the
4093.44s: variance between those. So that's kind of the funny thing about this idea of short calls as
4102.72s: some sort of downside hedge. They're really not. They're the reason why people do that is because
4110.00s: they want to make them out to be again, it's Goldilocks analysis. People want to be able to say
4116.00s: things like, Oh, well, I get to hold a stock that I like and I get to sell something and collect
4120.16s: money for it. And it hedges me to the downside. Sounds sick. But kind of again, not really representative
4128.40s: of reality. Reese says not on topic, but have you ever overcome not taking losses personally? I've
4136.56s: had a remind myself it should hurt a little. I mean, honestly, it doesn't hurt. It really doesn't
4142.64s: hurt. I don't care. The concept of wins and losses for somebody like me as a trader is,
4154.48s: it is all about the system. I can literally guarantee you what would make me very upset with myself
4166.32s: is if I made a bunch of money on something that I executed poorly, I would I genuinely would be
4175.68s: upset. That would frustrate me because that shouldn't happen. But the broader world
4187.76s: of taking trades any type of way. And when I say that, I literally mean winning trades,
4195.68s: losing trades like genuinely agnostic between them. Like it doesn't really matter to me. What
4203.12s: matters to me entirely is the execution. If the execution is good, then I'm okay with it. But
4214.08s: if the execution is poor, then I am entirely not okay with it. That's ultimately what matters to
4222.40s: me. And the way that you get there is you just literally train yourself on limiting your reactions
4231.76s: to both winning and losing trades. You even the keel of the ship. You have a winning trade,
4237.20s: you look at it and you immediately focus on that, that I execute how I should have here. And you go
4242.48s: to your trade log and you fill it in. Doesn't matter what the numbers are, you care about the execution
4247.20s: side of the trade. If you apply that to both winning and losing trades, then you'll naturally
4252.40s: start to mute that response a bit. But there there really shouldn't be a massive, a massive
4262.48s: emotional response in either direction, wins or losses. It typically means that we're off base.
4268.08s: Lauren says I lost one K of 5K last month, almost built it back, but very chaotic. Like a cow trying
4281.28s: to ice skate. Well, Lauren, I think you're also in that scenario where you're still probably
4288.32s: just bouncing around and not like my guess is if I ask you if you have a written trading plan
4294.64s: and a developed trading log. Again, I don't know. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but my guess is
4299.76s: you would say no, that would be my guess. And the reason is because that kind of drawdown doesn't
4308.56s: necessarily that doesn't happen that naturally. It's not like a terrible drawdown like you're fine.
4313.44s: But the that kind of drawdown with otherwise where you likely are at shouldn't necessarily be
4323.28s: that frequent unless it was some sort of risk that you knowingly took, knowingly accepted,
4330.56s: and then chose to still say, okay, like this is a big risk or whatever, but I'm comfortable with
4337.28s: it. And I'm going to take it anyways for whatever reason. That's a bit of a different scenario
4344.00s: on a comparative basis. But the way that we simplify that learning process is by
4354.48s: stop worrying about how much money you stand to make on any one individual trade because it literally
4360.24s: doesn't matter. And by entirely focusing on the process, your approach as a trader. If you do that,
4369.28s: that will naturally lead to you starting to size down your trades because you don't need to put
4373.76s: on a big trade because of the $5,000 account, it literally doesn't matter. Lauren says, I have a
4381.76s: log, but it's written in a notebook. I'm basically a boomer. That's good. And I'm actually glad that
4386.40s: you like that's still better than nothing. But unfortunately, that isn't really going to serve
4391.44s: the purpose that you need it to because the whole point of having a log is to be able to conduct
4396.72s: like data analysis. If you go back to one of the recent points in that little slide show that I
4403.92s: made for you guys, objectivity is very important. This is our ability to look at things as they are,
4411.28s: not how we think they are, how we think we remember how they were, but it's to literally remember
4416.88s: them as they are. And that's very difficult to do for most traders. Like we really don't have
4424.64s: that solid of a memory. And our memory is highly, highly skew prone, so skew prone.
4433.68s: So putting it in a notebook, honestly, is good. I'm actually happy to hear that you're doing that.
4440.08s: But it's still really not enough. And it's specifically for that reason. You kind of need to have
4447.28s: a slightly better, a slightly better way to log your stuff so that you can actually conduct
4455.28s: that kind of analysis because otherwise you're just putting yourself in a compromised position where
4459.92s: you're kind of guessing and hoping that whatever it is that you're doing is working. And it's very
4465.44s: difficult to pivot the again, that feedback loop that I described to you like that is life.
4473.92s: That feedback loop is ultimately what matters like entirely. So that's really what I would tell you
4483.28s: with respect to that. The paper log is good because it's a log, but it's not good enough. And you
4491.04s: would be better off taking that process that you're doing and at least taking it one step further.
4496.80s: Now you can maintain the paper log if you like, if you prefer writing it down, but then I would
4500.80s: still have a transcribing process to get it into the like a Google sheet or an Excel sheet so that
4508.96s: then you can actually make decisions. Risa says over corrected, I'm worried I don't care too much.
4519.68s: Yeah. So back to your example, the thing that I would focus on and evaluate my performance about
4527.04s: is not the outcome. So I actually don't think that there's any reason to care or not to care
4532.72s: about the outcome of an individual trade. I think that there's a really important function to care
4539.04s: a lot about the way that you executed. That's what matters in my opinion.
4546.00s: Just as says I wonder if would hate that he lost seven of time in aggregate at bats. I don't
4556.24s: know shit about baseball. I don't really know nothing, but it seems hard. The way that they
4565.52s: kind of swing them bats at that fast ass moving ball. That's about all I got for you guys there.
4570.56s: Okay, so real quick before we wrap, I want to show you at least, let me duplicate this. I haven't
4581.12s: built the next slide yet, but I want to talk to you about what the next one roughly is going to
4588.72s: cover and I want to get some of your opinions. So this one is going to be about approach.
4596.80s: And my vision for this one is to talk to you about things like how to actually make money as a
4604.40s: trader, how to build an options portfolio, how to manage risk. So the next step in this is actually
4614.64s: building the building blocks and the approach that we intend to take as a trader. And then after
4623.12s: that we'll talk about the actual execution of those things. And then we'll talk about how to
4629.60s: continually iterate so that we can ingest new information about what we're doing and optimize.
4637.52s: The biggest takeaway for today that I want to make sure you walk away with is that as an
4644.24s: options trader, you are in a very competitive space that's complex. You are the captain of your
4652.00s: own ship. You have to align yourself internally to avoid these very common starting points for
4661.04s: traders, moderate your expectations, figuring out what to focus on and when and again, if you
4669.28s: have no idea, you can go to my website. There's that options trading guide. And then after that,
4674.72s: you can go to again, things like MIT OpenCourseWare and grab a course on their options trading.
4681.60s: You can grab options as a strategic investment. Before you do anything else, you should do one of
4687.12s: those three things. And for those that are like, well, I like to learn this way or I'm more of a
4692.00s: practical learner, you're not. You're not going to magically be a practical learner in the option
4697.04s: space. It's just not how it works. You have to understand some of the concepts of it first.
4703.36s: So before you do anything else, that education has to come here. And then you start working on
4709.44s: the rest of your requirements as a trader organization. This is the basis for iteration,
4715.36s: tracking, and analysis. That process that we talked about is how you ingest everything and then
4721.20s: always remembering that you absolutely have to be able to objectively analyze what you're doing,
4728.64s: otherwise this feedback loop becomes completely meaningless.
4733.52s: So that's what I got. That's what's in store for next Friday. Tomorrow we have the GME live stream.
4741.76s: And then on Sunday, we have the pro trading prep live stream. So I hope you guys enjoy your weekend.
4750.16s: I'll see you all around on the stream to be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
