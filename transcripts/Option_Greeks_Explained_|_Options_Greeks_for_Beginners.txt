0.08s: there are a lot more than the five
1.80s: Greeks most options Traders are used to
4.24s: seeing so the goal of this video is to
6.24s: give you a deeper understanding of the
8.96s: primary Greeks and then give you a
11.00s: cursory overview of the second and third
14.16s: order Greeks that you might be less
16.08s: aware of this will be generally less
18.68s: applicable to most people good reference
20.56s: material and if you're a sophisticated
22.48s: Trader some of this stuff will actually
24.24s: be quite useful to you so we're going to
26.64s: go through what these different orders
28.32s: mean then we're going to get into some
29.56s: miscon ceptions up front and then we're
31.12s: going to dive into the Greeks themselves
32.52s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
33.92s: back to the outliers shout out to the
35.64s: patreon family if what I do helps you
37.48s: out consider signing up let's get
39.60s: straight to it so what do these
41.52s: different orders mean well when you talk
44.52s: about options we're generally going to
46.28s: be talking about different factors in
48.76s: the context of a differential equation
50.44s: we're not going to go deep into that
51.72s: world in this video today but just know
54.24s: that that is essentially what we're
55.80s: doing so the first order Greeks they
58.72s: give you various factors sensitivity
62.32s: with respect to price that's what WT
65.28s: means with respect to you're going to
67.00s: see that a lot so just earmark what this
70.08s: means second and third order Greeks
72.96s: simply take the next step of that
75.44s: derivative so second order Greeks are
78.08s: the derivative of first order with
80.56s: respect to an additional factor and then
83.68s: third does that to second if that makes
85.44s: no sense to you don't worry we're going
87.24s: to get through it together and it gets
88.88s: easier when we get to the breakdown
90.60s: before that let's talk about some
92.08s: misconceptions first off Greeks make you
93.76s: money no they don't second Greeks
95.64s: provide Edge no they don't what do
97.20s: Greeks do they measure things that's it
99.48s: you have to figure out how you can
101.92s: structure things to make money the
103.80s: Greeks can give you some ideas about
105.60s: that but there is no inherent Edge in
107.84s: knowing the Greeks or any way that the
110.68s: Greeks outright make you money they
112.60s: simply measure things now that we got
114.32s: that aside let's get into these Greeks
116.88s: notice we are starting with the first
119.04s: order Greeks and that is because these
121.04s: are the most common if you'll notice
122.60s: there's four of them here but at the
124.64s: beginning of the video I said the five
127.00s: primary Greeks so are we missing one no
129.88s: one of the five primary Greeks is
132.36s: actually a second order Greek which
134.92s: we'll get to that in a minute so we have
137.40s: Delta Theta Vega and row Delta and row
143.20s: have another Greek in parenthesis next
145.92s: to it so Delta has Lambda row has
148.16s: Epsilon why is that you'll find out in
150.72s: just a minute but just know that that is
152.64s: another Greek so we'll start with Delta
155.48s: this is pretty commonly understood that
157.36s: is the premium rate of change per
159.96s: onepoint move in the underlying price
162.80s: movement it's also a proxy for
165.16s: probability of an option expiring in the
166.76s: money which is actually kind of useful
169.48s: but also grossly inaccurate in other
171.68s: instances I'll throw a video in the
173.40s: notes below that walks through Delta as
176.16s: an approximation of being in the money
178.44s: so that you can be more well versed on
180.68s: that and then it also represents the
183.32s: notional value that you are trading so
185.48s: let's take a look at a quick example I'm
188.00s: going to use apple and right now we're
190.28s: looking at the 19 Jan expiration chain
193.04s: this is Delta now when you look at an
195.48s: option chain this is always in the
197.04s: context of if you were to buy the option
200.64s: so when we're looking at this column
203.16s: that shows the range of these different
205.44s: Figures it's in that same context as if
207.60s: you were to buy that option if you
210.36s: choose to sell the option the inverse
213.64s: sign applies so let's take a look at
216.60s: this 190 put in apple the Delta of that
220.04s: is negative 0.30 so going back to
223.36s: options 101 every contract that you
226.32s: trade a standard contract a one lot
229.88s: represents up to 100 shares of the
233.12s: underlying however when you trade
235.16s: options it doesn't behave like that full
237.80s: 100 shares right out of the gate so in
240.36s: this case this is telling you that this
242.36s: contract this 190 put right now is
246.00s: behaving as if it was short 30 shares
249.96s: that's also where the rate of change of
252.56s: the premium will come per dollar move in
254.96s: the underlying so if you sold this
258.00s: option what happens to this sign it
261.56s: becomes a positive so if you sell this
264.56s: 190 put that means your position is
267.56s: behaving like long 30 shares of Apple
271.40s: now the further you go out of the money
274.16s: Delta is going to approximate to zero
276.68s: the deeper in the money you go Delta is
279.04s: going to approximate to one or negative
281.32s: 1 you'll notice on the call side Delta
283.92s: is positive on the put side Delta is
286.36s: negative again if you on the call side
289.20s: and you choose to sell this 47 Delta
293.00s: call you would then be holding a
295.36s: position that's behaving as if you were
297.44s: short 47 shares of Apple at this price
301.52s: so the punchline here is that when
303.68s: you're looking at an options chain all
305.44s: of the Greeks are provided in a sense
308.96s: that you are buying so if you choose to
310.96s: sell all of them flip Delta gamma Theta
314.96s: Vega row all flip okay a couple other
318.64s: things about Delta it is typically about
321.72s: a 50 Delta if you are at the money and
324.84s: Delta doesn't really care if you are at
327.88s: 1 DTE or if you at 50 DTE it's still
332.28s: going to behave generally the same where
334.80s: about 50 Delta is going to be at the
336.32s: money further you go out Delta is going
338.40s: to approximate to zero and then to one
340.32s: the further in the money you go now
342.24s: let's talk about Theta Theta is the rate
344.92s: of change in premium from the passage of
346.88s: time and we measure that by one DTE so
350.84s: each time one day passes Theta is
354.08s: decaying out of the option so again
356.36s: using the same example of these 190s
359.56s: will go back to the 22 DTE and the 190
363.36s: that 30 Delta option it has a Theta of
368.12s: 0.06 so this means every day that passes
371.76s: everything else remaining the same you
373.96s: are losing six cents out of that options
376.32s: premium notice how I said everything
378.68s: else being the same this is a really
380.56s: important note the Greeks are only as
383.04s: good as when you look at them what that
384.88s: means is markets move all of the inputs
388.04s: that go into the Greeks are constantly
390.08s: changing so it's not a static figure
392.16s: more often than not some of them are
394.16s: more resilient to intraday movement
396.44s: others are not so a couple notes about
399.12s: Theta you'll notice that it's highest at
402.28s: the money and the further out of the
404.32s: money you go or the further in the money
406.48s: you go the further down it goes why is
408.96s: that because an option has the highest
412.12s: extrinsic value at the money the most
415.16s: time value the further something is out
417.16s: of the money the less time value it has
419.48s: has no intrinsic value so Theta can't be
422.12s: high cuz there's not much left to Decay
423.80s: out same thing if you go super deep in
425.80s: the money there's not a lot of extrinsic
427.76s: value so there's not a lot of theta to
429.92s: Decay out a couple other notes about
431.80s: Theta the rate of theta Decay looks a
434.60s: lot like this graph this is taken from
436.36s: an actual options chain notice how
438.92s: really long DTE 100 days to expiration
441.60s: Theta does not Decay that much day over
443.88s: day even 20 30day blocks notice when you
446.56s: go from 90 to 60 it starts to Exel
449.36s: accelerate and then as you go 60 and in
451.80s: it parabolically approximates to zero
455.08s: because every single option expires at
457.96s: that point it can have no more extrinsic
460.40s: value so Theta accelerates the closer to
464.48s: expiration that you are this is
466.28s: precisely why when I'm trading things
468.32s: like the ratio call diagonal ratio put
470.72s: diagonal I use longer dated options for
473.56s: my Longs so that I'm not wasting away
476.88s: with Theta and when I'm selling I tend
479.52s: to sell shorter term time frames to
482.00s: capitalize on that curve now let's move
484.72s: on to Vega Vega is the premium change of
489.00s: an option per 1% move in volatility and
493.08s: a super annoying nerd fact Vega isn't a
496.40s: Greek it actually would be considered
498.40s: Kappa but that doesn't apply as cleanly
502.04s: as Vega volatility so they went with
504.60s: Vega Theta time Delta Direction row
508.40s: rates that work for Kappa and volatility
511.96s: so anyways useless fact for you and I
514.24s: appreciate that Vega is the highest at
518.00s: the money and it's constant it behaves a
520.24s: little bit different than the other
521.80s: Greeks so if we grab Vega right here
524.60s: notice how Vega is highest at the money
527.24s: the further you go out of the money it
528.68s: drops same thing the further in the
530.32s: money you go it drops this is kind of an
533.40s: important figure because depending on
536.08s: the time frame that you're trading
537.68s: shorter term time frames are going to
539.88s: see Vega moving more and you'll notice
542.12s: that a lot of these kind of behave that
544.48s: way where if we go further out in time
546.96s: you'll have more Vega in the options
549.84s: notice how it Peaks up to this why is
551.80s: that well because there's more extrinsic
554.08s: value but is a percentage of the
556.80s: remaining premium it gets to be a little
558.88s: bit jacked up when there's at the money
561.04s: not that much time left it's also
562.72s: product dependent but it's just an
564.72s: important note notice how with something
566.56s: that's trading for
568.12s: $237 38 cents the Vega here is 18 so in
572.48s: this case the 78 DTE this represents
574.88s: like 6.8% of the premium the Vega and
579.24s: out here it's closer to like
581.24s: 7.6% so again just kind of a a general
585.24s: data point that's useful to be aware of
587.44s: and then if we look at row this is the
589.28s: premium change from a 1% move in the
591.32s: risk-free rate which is used to price
593.08s: options this is less impactful to most
595.52s: Traders this generally is going to
597.56s: impact longer term options far more so
601.12s: this is less used by most Traders now
604.40s: notice how Lambda and Epsilon are here
606.80s: Lambda is essentially the percent
609.08s: equivalent of Delta so Lambda takes the
611.88s: premium percent change per 1% change in
616.68s: the spot price and Epsilon does that for
619.44s: row so those are technically two more
621.60s: Greeks so far first order Greeks are
624.32s: down did we miss one cuz I said that
626.48s: there's five primary Greeks but as we
629.28s: talked about no the next that you will
631.68s: be familiar with is gamma gamma is the
634.68s: Delta rate of change to a one point move
637.48s: in the stock price so when we think
640.00s: about Gamma there are a couple things
642.12s: that will strike you the first one is
643.92s: gamma is much higher the closer we get
646.52s: to expiration so if we take a look at an
649.48s: at the money option 78 DTE notice the
652.24s: gamma is 02 if we take that into 8 DTE
655.56s: the gamma is 8 why is this the case well
658.48s: if gamma is the rate of change of Delta
662.00s: and we know that as we get closer to
664.64s: expiration every option has to make a
667.00s: choice it's either going to have a Delta
668.72s: of zero and be out of the money or it's
671.08s: going to have a Delta of one plus and be
673.80s: in the money so in this case you notice
675.96s: that all of the in the money options
678.12s: have Deltas of about one and everything
680.60s: that's out of the money has a Delta
682.20s: approximating to zero so gamma is higher
684.92s: the closer you get to expiration because
686.84s: every single option has to make that
688.44s: choice so this is typically what helps
691.20s: buyers and hurts sellers okay so now
694.16s: we're going to move on to charm which is
695.80s: also known as Delta Decay so this is the
698.08s: Delta rate of change per one point move
700.24s: in days to expiration so as each one day
703.24s: moves and it is the derivative of
706.04s: Premium to Delta and Theta it is also
709.24s: the derivative of theta with respect to
712.04s: spot price so what do we use charm for
715.00s: it gives us an idea of how Delta is
717.32s: going to behave with respect to time
719.04s: time that's it next we have Vana which
721.56s: is known as D Vega dpot and that is the
724.36s: ratio of Vega changing from a onepoint
727.64s: move in the spot price it's also known
730.28s: as D Delta dvol which is the rate of
732.52s: change of Delta per 1% change in
735.40s: volatility so what we're getting an idea
738.28s: of here is how volatility is interacting
743.32s: with both Vega spot price relationship
746.64s: and then also Delta and volatility
749.44s: relationship Vera which a lot of people
751.84s: have probably never heard of that's the
753.56s: row change to a 1% change in volatility
757.56s: and a 1% change in interest rates so it
760.88s: is value premium of an option with
763.88s: respect to volatility and interest rates
766.32s: Vera again probably not useful to most
768.64s: of you so we'll move on now to vaa which
771.08s: is also known as Vega Decay this one's
772.80s: actually kind of interesting so it is
775.12s: the Vega rate of change to a 1% move in
779.16s: volatility and a 1% move in DTE so as
782.96s: you get closer to expiration Veta
786.60s: increases and the way to think about
789.08s: most of this as as an option gets closer
791.76s: to expiration things move more because
794.32s: there's a lot that has to happen like we
796.52s: talked about with respect to Delta of
799.24s: everything needing to make a choice
800.64s: between being a Delta of one or Delta of
802.88s: zero you're either going to be in the
804.00s: money or out of the money so there's a
805.40s: lot of other changes that are occurring
807.36s: as we get closer then we have VMA which
809.88s: is also known as vulga and that kind of
812.56s: reminds me of Helga from Hey Arnold uh
815.36s: but this is Vega convexity also known as
818.28s: D Vega Devol so this is your Vega rate
821.52s: of change from a 1% move in volatility
824.60s: so it gives you how Vega behaves as
828.04s: volatility itself is moving now we move
831.80s: in to the third order Greeks we have
834.04s: color speed Ultima and z and if you
837.40s: don't know there's actually more than
839.72s: this it's insane man that starts tying
842.68s: the Greeks and the behavior between two
844.56s: different products together but I'm
846.36s: sticking with these because again most
848.64s: of these at this point probably don't
850.52s: apply to most of us but they're good to
852.56s: know so let's get to color which is
855.00s: gamma Decay so it tells us the gamma
856.84s: rate of change per onepoint move in DTE
859.92s: then we have speed which is the gamma of
862.36s: gamma and you'll notice a lot of these
864.80s: especially in the third order all of
866.48s: them are tied to volatility that is
868.84s: because volatility is quite literally
871.32s: the lifeblood of options so people that
874.40s: manage different kinds of portfolios
876.32s: especially at a professional level you
878.40s: actually care quite a bit about some of
880.80s: these especially if you trade
881.96s: derivatives because volatility can
884.48s: completely unpack a beautifully built
887.96s: position pretty quickly so that is
890.92s: exactly why we have all of these
892.48s: different measures of volatility's
894.52s: impact to these other things so speed is
897.76s: the gamma rate of change per one point
899.40s: move in spot price then we have Ultima
901.76s: which is dma Deval which is the VMA VMA
905.12s: I want to make sure I'm pronouncing that
906.96s: well for you guys vama rate of change
909.12s: per 1% move in Vega or Vega convexity
912.80s: when you think about convexity in these
914.68s: definitions it's giving you a sense of
916.92s: the shape of the measurement so if
918.96s: something's convex it typically has this
921.28s: kind of shape to it then we have Z which
923.84s: is D gamma DV gamma rate of change per
927.20s: 1% move inv vol ility so why do we care
930.72s: about all of these because they are
932.92s: giving you insight to how fast something
936.28s: like gamma is going to start to move
938.68s: which actually matters quite a bit to
940.68s: sellers so if you sell options do we
943.40s: really care about color speed ultimate
945.68s: Zama well potentially but depending on
948.84s: the strategy it's more likely than not
951.56s: gamma will suffice in a pretty big way
954.48s: however if you interested in tinkering
956.48s: with the rest of these here they are for
958.36s: you and for the patreon folks if you go
960.40s: to the shop you can download this exact
963.92s: reference sheet and it's for free for
966.28s: everybody that's silver and above and if
968.36s: you're not on there you can literally
970.20s: just screenshot this and then build your
972.16s: own if you would like a reference so if
974.04s: you have any questions on these let me
975.76s: know the punchline is for most Traders
978.96s: Delta Theta Vega row and Gamma and even
982.20s: row is a kind of sus because for a lot
984.40s: of people that trade shorter term
985.48s: options less so but I still would give
987.16s: it credit here these five are going to
989.92s: be the most important and then from here
991.80s: you can take a look at depending on the
993.28s: strategy how important changes in
995.52s: volatility will impact your position but
997.76s: these five are probably your most
1000.40s: important ones once you understand these
1002.48s: if you want to dive deeper and deeper
1003.88s: into the world of creating graphs that
1006.56s: show how these move it's actually pretty
1008.36s: fun I guess in a really nerdy way can't
1010.12s: believe I just said that so if you have
1012.48s: any questions let me know be an outlier
1014.12s: see youall later
