0.00s: And no point have I expected in my life, I would be attempting to decipher a series of
6.18s: emojis that then try to infer potential trades by an online kind of Robin Hood joker juxtaposition
17.40s: our boy, Roy and Kitty, obviously, to see what moves might be happening.
22.32s: It's absurd and I love it.
24.68s: It's hilarious.
25.68s: Now, I want to be clear, as I've said a bunch of times, I don't have the lore or the background
29.26s: that you guys do.
30.26s: I'm not going to pretend to.
31.26s: I'm actually going to spend very little time on this.
33.10s: I want to spend way more time looking at theory and I'm going to focus more on what I do,
39.66s: which is looking at the options markets and looking at the underlying itself.
44.98s: But this stuff is kind of funny.
46.70s: So there was a member from the discord MP that was asking if I win over Siri and I have
52.26s: not.
53.26s: But I'm happy to and funny enough, I actually have a trade on in Siri that I took most of
58.74s: it down and left a little bit of it back on.
61.86s: But again, as per usual for me with this stuff, I had no idea that this was even going
66.74s: on.
67.74s: I simply saw it pop up on a couple of my scanners.
71.06s: So I established a position, very small speculative trade, take advantage of what looked to be
77.54s: a bit of a breakout.
79.26s: So let me show you what that looks like to start, which is on the chart.
85.18s: Basically, if I zoom this in from a one year to like a three months, I saw two things
91.06s: that really interested me.
92.54s: The first thing was here on the 21st of June, there was a massive skyrocket in volume
101.90s: for the underlying itself.
103.58s: So what that means is if I look at the day before, the volume was 38.8 million.
109.58s: I look at the volume on the 21st, it's 330 million, massive expansion.
118.58s: This triggered an initial alert for me.
120.94s: I get a lot of these to be clear.
122.70s: It's not like each one of them is a unicorn and they all work out great.
125.38s: A lot of them don't.
126.86s: But I'm very willing to monitor products that make these kinds of movements because there
131.62s: is activity.
132.86s: And from an options trading perspective, volatility is my friend.
137.78s: Whenever I'm buying options or selling options, I need things to move in order to make money.
143.54s: So when I see stuff like this, I'm interested.
146.30s: So this popped off and what I did was immediately set an alert at this price level right here,
154.02s: the 298 handle.
156.26s: Now this originally was screened out because it was sub $5.
162.38s: I very rarely will trade things that are sub $5.
167.18s: When I saw this happen, I dropped this price alert.
172.54s: So I didn't buy or do anything here.
175.18s: And it was originally an alert that looks just like this.
177.74s: So I literally will set an alert that if there's a break above this previous level,
183.26s: it was a little bit lower.
184.46s: It was like right here at like $2.95 right at the open, the previous open on this handle.
190.22s: And if there was a break above that, I just wanted to know about it.
193.98s: So what I get an alert on then is on the second July.
198.94s: And on the second of July, we see a break above that was pretty consistent.
204.86s: And we still have much lower volume than we saw here,
210.30s: but much higher volume than average all the way over here.
214.86s: So what I do is I use this average volume to give me some context.
220.14s: It was skewed a little bit by this day obviously, but because it was only one day,
223.74s: came right back down. And the thing that really stuck out to me here, though,
227.90s: was the fact that this was overwhelmingly by volume, both of these days.
233.42s: So as soon as I see a bunch of generally higher volume coming into the product,
238.54s: that's majority by volume.
240.06s: I see a break above.
241.50s: This becomes a small trade for me in asymmetric play.
245.02s: I want to take it to the upside.
247.18s: And I'm going to set a really tight stop.
249.66s: And in this case, the stop was $2.95.
252.62s: It was using this prior point of perceived resistance now turned support.
258.46s: Again, I feel like what's stuff like this you have to be so careful applying standard
262.46s: technical analysis. But this is a much smaller subset of what I do as a trader looking for,
268.14s: anomalous things like this and mostly trading things like momentum, which this falls directly
273.10s: into that bucket. We start seeing some really strong momentum with a breakout.
277.50s: This is early stages, though.
279.42s: So then we get a follow on move on the third.
282.62s: I end up exiting a good portion of the position there.
285.58s: And I have some runners that I left on.
288.30s: Now those runners will essentially get stopped out at three and a half or less.
292.54s: And that's it. They're just going to go go do their thing.
295.98s: Now what's going on here? I have no idea.
299.42s: There's a ton of speculation that Roryn Kitty's emojis translate.
305.10s: This everybody was sure was the fourth of July from what I saw from people sending
310.30s: me things in asking what they thought. Fourth of July could have meant because this
314.38s: coast corresponded with that well.
316.78s: And there was a new theory that came out that this stood for America.
320.70s: And then this microphone stood for broadcasting, which is if you look up theory, apparently on
325.58s: the Wikipedia page, it shows just like American broadcasting.
329.02s: So okay, maybe that's the case.
331.34s: This is honestly one of the problems with attempting to interpret emojis to make trading
336.62s: decisions. It's not what I do. But I find it entertaining to look at.
341.42s: So I know a lot of people are curious is Roryn Kitty now potentially building a position here
347.50s: in Siri? And a lot of people are going all over the place with this because Roryn Kitty's been
352.62s: radio silent since essential in terms of positions. And since the 13th of June.
359.18s: So everybody's kind of speculating, especially after the chewy movement and some of the movement
365.02s: that we're seeing here, everybody's wondering what's going on and trying to figure it out,
369.02s: rightfully so because it's very, very interesting. So if we take a look now at the options,
375.10s: change themselves. There's a couple things worth calling out here. The very first thing is,
381.90s: this is a very small product. There's not a ton of explorations. There's not a ton of option.
386.94s: If we take a look at the total open interest across these very few explorations,
392.38s: it's over 800,000 balls to 570,000 puts. So to clarify what I said in case it was misleading,
400.70s: when I say that there's not a lot of options, there's a ton of open interest relative to the number
406.78s: of options available. Like if I open up this chain, there's a handful. You go from 0.5 to 6,
415.10s: right? So like in comparison, just for context, if you look at something like spy,
420.38s: and we open up the options chain, there's tons. And there's even, right, there's tons of option.
426.94s: So that's what I mean here when I say that there's not a lot of options in Siri,
431.90s: is that there's just not a ton of explorations and within those explorations, there's not a lot
437.10s: of chains to pick from. Now what I find interesting here is there are a couple very, very active
447.02s: chains, specifically individual strikes that think are worth talking about to a degree.
453.10s: Although when I look at this in a broad brushstroke, I don't see a lot of anomalous activity that
460.54s: would lead me to believe super informed, sized, convicted by, meaning people like R&T, coming in,
467.10s: and placing, because especially something like this, if you compare to something like GameStop,
471.18s: where he was coming in with 5,000 lot, 10,000 lot pieces to establish his position.
476.70s: This is a fraction of, but you would, you would have to be pushing some weight in order to get
483.18s: a meaningful position on in here. Now that's from the options perspective. That's not to say that
489.42s: there are not shares transacting because this is above average transactions. There's no doubt.
494.78s: Like even this, again, if we go back to kind of this this pre-jacked up period here,
499.82s: we go back and here, it's like 15 million, 19 million, and then essentially from this point forward,
506.70s: it doesn't get below 30 million. So there's absolutely elevated stock transaction. But from an
515.02s: options perspective, I'm not necessarily seeing that because even though that there's a lot of
519.90s: options relative to how few, or I'm sorry, a lot of open interest relative to how few
527.18s: chains and strikes there are to select from, there's not a lot of correspondingly large sizes.
534.54s: Because again, this looks like a big number, 820,000 calls, and it is a lot of OI. But you're talking
540.86s: about something that's trading for $3. So if you want to put on anything of size, you need to put
545.42s: on a ton of the, so let's take a look at some of the chains and then some of the individual.
553.34s: What I do find interesting from the jump, I should say, take a look, this is five days to
558.62s: expiration, take a look at how high the implied volatility is. 195. Why do I find that so interesting,
565.66s: simple. If we come over here and we take a look at something zoomed out a little bit more,
571.58s: this earnings coming up on the first of next month, I would expect the,
578.38s: the expiration cycle that includes this to be the highest IV in the near future. I would
586.78s: expect this expiration cycle to be the highest. So if I go there, we know it's the first of August,
593.34s: so the very first expiration cycle that would include it would be the second of August,
596.86s: which is a weekly. So maybe it, you know, sort of slid out to the monthly for more liquidity,
602.70s: sometimes you'll see that happen more even though this contains earnings, the ones around it
606.46s: also can be elevated or even slightly higher if that's where people are going to play earnings.
611.26s: I don't see any of that. I see 195 here, 166 here, and then it dumps the 145, 144, 133, 135.
621.34s: So if we check out the chain that actually has earnings in it directly, it's this one.
627.02s: It's only 144, 66 compared to the next upcoming two in order, 12 July, 19 July at 155,
636.86s: in 166. That's big. Now there's obviously a lot of IV in this front cycle because of this.
646.30s: This is a giant move. This is not a small move, even though it is a very small product.
652.46s: It's gone from 245 from the 13th of last month to 416 was the high hit here.
659.34s: The big move. That is a big move relative to the size of this product.
664.70s: So the implied volatility for the expiration cycles is interesting to me, and this is abnormal,
671.58s: for sure. I would expect the earnings to be much, much higher. Now pivoting over and taking
677.58s: a look at the volatility smile for specifically the out of the monies, and let's use kind of these
683.26s: near two terms and then where we see earnings. A couple of things. One, these are all jacked up.
689.74s: Normally you don't see them crisscrossing all over the place like this. And what I can tell you
693.98s: is from the one that includes the earnings cycle, notice how high the put side is relative to the
699.18s: call side. This is an expectation of downside. If I go in here to the 12th and the 19th July,
708.22s: so for those wondering it's the blue and kind of the pink is too, they still lean very put heavy.
719.10s: So the market as far as I can tell broadly is pricing in downside. Then when I look at the
726.22s: transactions that occurred on Friday, I see a few things. I see the vast majority of puts transacted
734.70s: at the offer or higher, meaning we're buying puts lots of them. And when I look at the call side,
742.14s: the majority 39% to 36% so a slight majority are on the bid side selling calls.
749.66s: So that still tells me we're looking a little bit more to the downside here.
754.86s: So what does this mean? Well, this pop. Very interesting timing. And I also think some of this might
761.74s: have corresponded with a couple posts that were on Reddit. From the options perspective, it doesn't
767.66s: look super interesting. There are a couple heavy cycles. And I also wanted to show you this now that
775.66s: I became in a field with unusual whales because this is a little easier to use for kind of quick
782.46s: research like this. I still prefer pulling things down, dropping it in Excel or Google Sheets so
787.90s: that I can analyze it a little more in depth. But this is super useful to be able to check out something
791.98s: like. So what I did is I just looked back essentially over all of last month and the beginning of
798.62s: this month. And I'm looking at things that transacted at the offer or higher, meaning that we're buying
805.10s: on the call side specifically. I'm looking at calls. And I want premium that's at least $25,000.
811.18s: If it's under $25,000, it is even this is low for me from identifying like big players that are
819.66s: trying to speculate here. So this is a low threshold. And the reason why I use a low threshold is so
825.58s: that maybe I can see if there's a bigger player that's entering with a series of these smaller
831.98s: traits. The way you can detect that is you can see when they're coming in, how close they are to
836.46s: one another and you can pick up on buying pattern. You'll see centralization within the same strike.
842.46s: You'll see consistent sizing to a specific degree, things like that. So when I look at the buying
850.46s: activity centrally over the last entire month, the biggest trade that populates in here is this one
855.82s: right here at $195. So if we sort these instead by premium, there's not a lot of big traits. There's
864.78s: a $195. This is not small, by the way, this is absolutely a large trade. No doubt. And this
874.14s: looks curious to me because it's way far out. So this is a long-term play. That's what this tells me.
881.66s: You don't go out that far at that size because it's not very liquid. Notice how wide that market is.
887.50s: That's crazy. $0.66 to $0.80 on something we're evolving on a three and a half strike. That's wildly
894.86s: so they want leverage exposure to the upside. That's what this is. No doubt. But it's all the way out
900.22s: in 2025. So they're giving it plenty of time to. In terms of the next largest, there's essentially
906.78s: $75,000 position much tighter, still very liquid for the size of this product. But this is a little
914.46s: near term, but still pretty far out. So the vast majority of these larger trades are kind of spread
921.58s: across these different expiration cycles with some decent weight out here in 2025. But that doesn't
928.46s: bode well for what a lot of people are very interested in is what does this mean for me today,
932.54s: this week coming up now. And as I look across all of this, again, not saying nothing's going to
938.86s: happen, I have no idea. But what I do know is the options chain right now isn't showing me anything
944.86s: that looks supremely interesting. Anything indicative of strongly convicted upside
951.02s: bias trading, the majority of volume that we saw on Friday, today's the seventh of July,
956.62s: the majority of volume from Friday was actually trading it to the downside, looking to either
962.38s: buy puts or sell calls into it. So very interesting. Do I think that this is roaring kitty? I have no
969.50s: idea from an options perspective. I would lean no, but from an equity perspective potentially. But
975.42s: I have no idea. He seems really convicted around trading, GameStop, and I had a long conversation
982.78s: with Richard about that not too long ago to understand his behaviors in terms of moving into
988.30s: other products. And it's not outside the realm of possibility. But right now we have no way to
993.10s: know we haven't seen any portfolio updates. We haven't seen any more filings outside of Chewie.
998.46s: So he's obviously looking at other things. But we don't know exactly what that buying pattern
1004.30s: entails other than the fact that I do think it's somewhat telling that when we look at this little
1010.94s: chain and we had the dog emoji, then we see the filing for Chewie. And then we do see this. I
1020.30s: don't think it's that far fetched. Assume there could be activity going on by him in there.
1025.42s: I just have no idea. So I'm is eager to find out as you guys are. But my small contribution to
1032.54s: the puzzle set would be from an options perspective. I don't see anything interesting to
1036.54s: indicate to me that there's Lauren Kittier, really any other large player in their transacting.
1043.18s: It would be more on the equity side that I could tell. And even that is relatively late for
1048.46s: something that's so cheap, but who knows? So as always, if you have any questions or anything
1053.02s: that ad drop it in the comments, be an outlier. I'll see you later.
