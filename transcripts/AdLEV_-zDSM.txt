776.00s:  you
778.00s:  you
808.00s:  day change, you will find things that are still showing strength.
813.12s:  So MOH is a really solid example that's showed strength and persistent strength.
818.96s:  B and Y is another that has shown persistent strength.
822.44s:  So if I show you these two names really quick to give you the example, MOH, you can see
827.72s:  it's been on an absolute tear.
829.04s:  It's actually taking out these near term highs and it's posting new highs.
834.40s:  If we take a look at another example, B and Y, this is one that I've traded for a while
838.96s:  now.
839.96s:  And it's just because it's operating completely different and idiosyncratic to the rest
845.04s:  of the market.
846.16s:  So if you prefer to trade things to the long side, you can find them.
850.32s:  But the holding duration for them is really nowhere near what it typically might be, at
856.44s:  least for me.
857.88s:  Because even if you take a look at this move here, this is gone from on the 18th to today.
864.28s:  So 15 trading days, two weeks.
867.20s:  That's a little bit actually on the longer side.
869.60s:  Most of my directional holdings have been right around two weeks.
873.00s:  So I didn't obviously bottom tick this.
875.52s:  I've never really bottom ticked anything in my entire life.
881.08s:  But the entries and exits I take are typically breakouts, right, above prior congestion
886.20s:  periods like this here is where I got on B and Y.
889.56s:  So that's one way to approach things.
892.72s:  The other way to approach things is finding different kinds of weakness.
899.44s:  Now typically during a bearable a bull market, you have to look really carefully for weak
905.52s:  sectors and then weak individual tickers within those sectors.
909.48s:  And the reason why it's so important to structure it that way is because it's the inverse
913.24s:  of what's happening now.
914.92s:  Typically during a bull market, a lot of things can rally even generally just because the whole
919.16s:  market's going up.
920.76s:  So you have to be really selective.
922.44s:  Now it's almost like a stone's throw and you're going to hit something that's going down,
926.72s:  which makes it easier.
928.68s:  But the way that I tried to time my downside trades is when the market starts to show rallies,
938.56s:  like we saw last week.
940.80s:  So if you see on Friday, there is a little bit of a rally happening in the S&P 500 and
947.40s:  same thing in the queues.
949.08s:  The reason why that's an important days because what I do is I go inside the sectors and
953.06s:  I see on those rally days, what tickers are just kind of treading water or even rolling
958.88s:  over still.
960.40s:  And those names become prime targets for shorts.
965.60s:  And I'll give you an example of one of them that exists right now, which is CCL.
975.68s:  So CCL was originally entered here on the fourth and then it was reentered on the sixth
985.24s:  and then reentered on the seventh.
988.20s:  So those are the series of different points where I've scaled in to CCL.
994.84s:  And here's exactly why this one gets honed in on because this is something that's shown
1003.36s:  in uptrend and then it's something that is shown significant weakness against this
1010.24s:  near term broader market correction.
1013.04s:  This is a different approach than I typically apply when I'm attempting to stack strength
1020.36s:  for longer term ideas.
1022.68s:  If I'm trying to hold something for six months to a year, even three months, three months,
1028.84s:  six months to a year, this doesn't qualify for that kind of trade.
1033.44s:  So it's important to remember when we're talking about stacking strength, it is relative
1038.00s:  to the time frames of our trading.
1039.24s:  And if you remember, the majority of my holdings right now for directional plays were less
1042.72s:  than a month, two to three weeks.
1044.72s:  So what that means is we actually have to zoom in way more.
1047.56s:  This is now my long term chart.
1049.72s:  A three month daily is the long term chart or something that I might hold for two, three
1054.80s:  weeks.
1055.80s:  And you can see that this has absolutely been showing significant weakness over this
1059.32s:  time frame.
1060.40s:  So then as we zoom into the more relevant time frames, the 30 day and then the 15 day
1066.12s:  typically, you'll see that it's been effectively just a one sided move down here.
1075.04s:  So now it's just follow the trend, but there are so many names that look like this right
1082.84s:  now.
1083.84s:  It is so easy to find things to trade to the downside.
1088.88s:  The important part is to make sure that you have good risk management.
1093.44s:  The cool part is with the broader market showing this kind of weakness.
1097.28s:  It actually gives you quite a bit of space in order to trade things differently.
1101.80s:  So for example, CCL, this is on via long puts, which I knowingly overpaid for a couple
1108.68s:  other trades that I have short deltas on are like geo, but geo is via short calls.
1115.44s:  And geo is one of the ones that we reviewed together during I want to say one of the pro
1120.72s:  live streams not that long ago.
1122.84s:  So geo is one of them.
1124.56s:  Another that falls into that same bucket is ET phone home.
1128.68s:  ET is an example though of a ticker that actually would have been better via long puts.
1134.48s:  I didn't know that.
1136.24s:  So the way that I was trading ET definitely was via the volatility component here.
1142.32s:  You notice implied volatility in ET is 98%.
1146.72s:  So a big part of what I'm doing here is just literally trading both the direction and
1154.40s:  volatility.
1155.40s:  But this I use this as an example to show you that again, like I've been doing this a long
1161.40s:  time.
1162.40s:  Anybody that pretends that they always make the right move and you know that that's it's
1166.48s:  complete bullshit.
1167.72s:  And this is a good example like I was correct here, but the strategy that I picked whole
1174.24s:  holistically, if I were to look at just this one instance is suboptimal.
1178.28s:  Now for the broader portfolio, it's exactly what I needed, which is a big reason why I went
1183.20s:  into credit strategies.
1186.48s:  But there are two lenses to apply when we're evaluating stuff.
1190.64s:  So this now is also closing below its 200 AMA.
1195.36s:  Another really great filter to apply to identifying things that are going down are things that
1201.00s:  are just getting through their 200 AMAs because it's just like a bunch of names are just
1205.44s:  getting there now.
1206.80s:  Or other names that have fallen below a longer term moving average.
1210.68s:  In this case, this is a 100.
1212.16s:  You can use the 50s going to lag too long now.
1215.04s:  So you can't really rationalize using a 50, but using the gap between the 100 and a 200
1219.92s:  is completely viable here to target things to the downside.
1224.52s:  So trades are literally abundant.
1229.80s:  I could not find more names if I tried.
1233.84s:  One of the other things to keep in mind is the volatility side of things.
1238.00s:  I'm working on a video that's going to come out in a little bit that talks about the
1242.60s:  change.
1243.60s:  Maybe I'll work on it today a little bit more.
1246.92s:  But I'm talking about the change in zero DTE and one DTE trends over the last three
1254.08s:  years because daily's were launched in May of 22.
1259.00s:  And there's been a lot of different market movement over those time frames and profitability
1263.92s:  for the subsequent strategies.
1266.00s:  So the reason why I'm bringing this up is because one of the trades that I trade a lot is
1271.12s:  a weekend trade.
1274.16s:  Without going super far into the details, the crux of that is the weekend trade in SPX
1280.88s:  this week actually didn't work.
1284.36s:  But because volatility is so high, it still gave me an incredible chance to exit the trade
1291.92s:  and essentially reduce the max loss by 50%.
1295.88s:  That's because of volatility.
1297.92s:  So one of the things to keep in mind is even what the market moving as it is, depending
1304.44s:  on the strategies that you use, some of them build in these little guard rails inherently
1309.92s:  because of the volatility component, which you're going to see more and more of.
1313.72s:  So just something to keep in mind is you're kind of going through your portfolios figuring
1317.88s:  out what you want to do and what makes sense, what might not make sense because the market
1326.16s:  writ large, I really, really believe is offering a lot of opportunities right now.
1334.32s:  But it's not always easy to dip your toe in if you're not used to seeing these things,
1339.56s:  which leads me to the last general point I wanted to mention, which is now is literally
1345.48s:  the perfect time to paper trade to test ideas, to see how things work, to try different
1353.72s:  ideas.
1355.32s:  And it's not just because we might not know how something behaves, it's also because
1362.44s:  it helps you build a data set using actual market conditions like this.
1370.64s:  And the reality, like I was telling you at the beginning of the stream, you don't see
1373.12s:  this many of these.
1374.72s:  So it's really important to get as much data for these as you possibly can.
1378.28s:  So what I'm doing right now is I've ramped up my paper trading data collection massively.
1384.00s:  And I have literally single, single one delta variance between the different strategies
1390.52s:  that I have on.
1391.52s:  So what that means is if the base strategy is me selling 28 put, 28 delta put, if the
1397.28s:  volatility is over a 30% threshold for this specific option, then I'm literally doing
1403.68s:  28 27 26 25 24 23 literally all the way down and same thing up to a 50 delta.
1409.96s:  And it's because it costs me nothing.
1412.60s:  I literally just put them all on a paper trade and then I can monitor and see how they
1416.80s:  do.
1417.80s:  And then it allows me to conduct broader data analysis.
1420.96s:  And I can say, okay, when the VIX has moved from 15 to 20 over the course of X period
1427.80s:  of time, where do, where does that typically bleed out into the delta is that subsequently
1433.28s:  show optimal for whatever strategy it is that I might be looking at?
1436.88s:  It's just an example.
1438.44s:  So the message there is similar to what you've heard me say previously, but literally
1446.56s:  get everything you possibly can out of the experience, everything.
1452.68s:  If you are not paper trading right now and collecting data, I'm telling you, you are
1457.60s:  making a massive mistake, especially if you are trying to trade seriously, right?
1466.24s:  If your goal is to be a professional trader that makes actual money doing this, this
1473.40s:  is the exact work that needs to be done.
1476.08s:  And this is the exact time to get a live look at an example like this, which is solid.
1482.96s:  So make sure you do that.
1484.40s:  Okay, so I got a set 17 22.
1488.20s:  I still have time, obviously, but I want to talk about what you guys want to talk about.
1492.92s:  So feel free.
1494.24s:  If there's any questions you have, if there's stuff that you want to look at, let me know
1498.88s:  absolutely happy to poke through things.
1503.00s:  Okay, so yeah, Tommy before was talking about three year treasuries, I think even before
1508.12s:  we get into three years, I think we can just look at bonds in general and eyeball what
1515.96s:  we think broader bonds look like right now.
1522.88s:  And I don't have ZB, let's just add that here.
1536.00s:  So for those that don't know, this is forward slash ZT, which is a two year forward slash
1544.24s:  oops, forward slash ZN, which is a 10 year, I'm actually going to reorganize this ZT and
1550.16s:  then ZN.
1551.16s:  DB.
1553.68s:  So this is a two year 10 year 30 year.
1557.60s:  And bonds right now are finally rallying a little bit.
1563.60s:  The problem with the rally that I see in the bonds is that it still isn't as strong as
1570.68s:  it should be at this point in time.
1574.20s:  So the play of trying to find your way into bonds here via a leverage, I think is okay.
1581.80s:  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.
1584.28s:  But I still don't really care for bonds to the upside personally.
1590.20s:  So if we use the 10 year and we zoom this out, it's still at like a really important
1599.00s:  crux.
1600.00s:  Now again, it's made a great move.
1601.24s:  So if you're one of the people that bottom ticked it here, that's great.
1604.44s:  That's absolutely fantastic move.
1607.04s:  But the way that I always look at this kind of stuff is if it starts posting higher,
1615.00s:  higher than this, then I become interested.
1618.48s:  So this is actually hit a couple alerts specifically the 10 year for me, but it hasn't really
1626.28s:  shown up to where I would enter in.
1629.00s:  Now the other entry point that did alert me, but I didn't enter was in here.
1633.90s:  And it was on a breakout against this.
1637.48s:  It would have been fine.
1638.72s:  It absolutely would have been fine.
1640.24s:  But one of the issues with bonds as of lately is you have to trade them very carefully because
1644.84s:  of how strange the relationship to equities has been.
1648.96s:  So it really depends on the longer term perception.
1654.04s:  Now I think trading it with leverage is okay, but that induces a significant timing element.
1663.76s:  Like your timing has to be pretty good.
1665.76s:  If you're trying to trade these with a kind of lazy timing based approach and you're just
1671.60s:  trying to get long bonds via a leverage GTF, that can start hurting really bad, really
1677.84s:  fast.
1678.84s:  And because this is still going to be highly, highly sensitive to the different inflation
1683.96s:  metrics that we get going forward.
1686.12s:  So the relationship between bonds and equities, I don't view it as normalized yet.
1691.16s:  I view it as trending towards normalized, but still not there.
1695.20s:  And I think because of that, trying to trade the direction and bonds, you almost have to
1700.96s:  look at it as just bonds.
1703.36s:  And the new paradigm and relationship for just bonds versus trying to say, well, equities
1709.92s:  are going down a lot of times that means you can go long bonds.
1712.72s:  I wouldn't feel super confident in that just yet personally.
1715.84s:  Ayo James, what up?
1717.80s:  Good to see you.
1719.96s:  Paulos says, what's propping up BMY?
1723.68s:  It's a great question.
1725.68s:  And a lot of it is future driven expectations.
1731.40s:  So if you poke through, and there's really two time frames that I think are relevant,
1740.72s:  it's not just Friday and today.
1743.16s:  Like today was on more medical drug expectations for the future.
1752.84s:  But let me go, I want to go to like in here, which is where this is where like things
1759.20s:  really started bucking the broader trend in this area.
1765.40s:  So like the seventh, let's see what it says in here.
1770.28s:  Announce that the European Commission has approved up divo plus year boy for the first
1777.72s:  line of treatment of adult patients with un, what the fuck is that word?
1786.72s:  Resectable or advanced epitome cellular carcinoma.
1795.24s:  To hell of a word, I do not pretend, by the way, to know how to say any of these fucking
1804.84s:  words.
1805.84s:  Obviously, I don't.
1806.84s:  Oh, whatever this is.
1807.84s:  I can say carcinoma.
1808.84s:  I know that one.
1810.48s:  But so that's a big price driver that you saw on the seventh.
1818.92s:  The medical sector in general has been showing a lot more strength.
1824.44s:  So that's part of what you're seeing in B and Y specifically.
1828.88s:  But like I was showing you, one of the things that you can do to assess total strength
1833.44s:  is like you can see like what's up over a month, right?
1836.32s:  Billy add his up, CVS is up, B A X is up, Ab V is up.
1840.36s:  Like there was a ton of stuff in the medical sector that's doing well.
1844.56s:  So they're also going through a little bit of like varied reasons for the group of these.
1853.28s:  But there's a little bit of periodicity to it.
1856.52s:  So you're capturing some of that.
1859.32s:  So I mean, a lot of these look strong.
1863.32s:  The Ab V is essentially hovering near 52 week highs.
1873.52s:  Another absolute killer.
1874.84s:  I'm not trading this one, but this one also looks fantastic.
1879.80s:  Now these look interesting from a short premium perspective because these don't tend to move
1885.16s:  a whole lot.
1886.16s:  So in order to build a position in these at least for me, you kind of have to size up
1891.20s:  because the total move severity is much lighter, which is fine.
1895.12s:  But with implied volatility at 90%, I wouldn't be as jazzed to start getting a bunch of
1901.36s:  long calls or something here.
1903.04s:  So this is one that I would be looking via stuff like short puts and just trading the
1908.72s:  broader momentum.
1910.24s:  For sure.
1916.24s:  Paul says you bought just a plain long put.
1920.32s:  I don't remember what we're talking about, but yeah, I buy single options all the time.
1925.04s:  Again, the way that I view single options for me is that I always mentally bucket them
1930.28s:  as diagonals because that's always the potential route that they'll go.
1936.48s:  The only place that I won't really bucket long options as diagonals is like if I'm trading
1941.12s:  something for an expected earnings move, which I really just bucket those is Dgen options,
1949.44s:  but we'll just see how it goes, which is typically not super well served.
1956.24s:  But yeah.
1958.88s:  Paul says our companies that breached 52 week lows are close to it.
1963.60s:  Good candidates for downside trends or downside trades.
1968.24s:  So, Paul, for your scenario, I think it depends on how you trade things to the downside.
1976.80s:  That's not like giving you a depends.
1980.16s:  It depends answer to not want to answer.
1982.16s:  It is because it really is highly relevant and I'll explain why.
1986.32s:  If we're looking for things, let's do just a price performance scan and I'll show you.
2003.28s:  We'll build
2007.76s:  Yeah, this one's fine.
2008.80s:  So, I'm going to do negative over a year.
2016.96s:  Yep, this is okay.
2018.48s:  And I want to show you the difference of behavior that you'll see in this group.
2023.12s:  So, first thing is let's take a look at different distances off of 52 week highs.
2031.52s:  And let's sort this by things that are essentially just hovering near lows like these.
2039.52s:  And let's take a look.
2041.52s:  So, I'm going to cite what I was just showing you.
2044.00s:  I'm just moving it off the screen so I can click through these faster.
2047.28s:  So, M A X N is one of them.
2050.32s:  Here's one of the issues that you will find with stuff like this.
2055.84s:  So, when you find things that make lows below 52 week lows,
2061.44s:  depending on what the company is, sometimes you will find weakness that is nearing a floor,
2072.24s:  a perceived floor of some type.
2075.12s:  So, then if something is hovering or establishing new 52 week lows,
2081.04s:  the way that it's doing that matters a lot.
2084.16s:  And depending on exactly the velocity and where the 52 week low is in relation.
2090.00s:  So, that's why 52 week lows, at least for my approach,
2094.80s:  tends to be a little bit too low, specifically for trying to trade like a big downside trend.
2102.40s:  52 week lows is a good place for me when I'm hunting for things to sell short calls.
2107.92s:  That's very common.
2109.20s:  But it's because things that tend to get down to 52 week lows,
2112.56s:  you're kind of late to the dance at that point.
2116.00s:  So, and it's, again, not saying that it couldn't be done,
2119.60s:  but it's just the way that I typically think of it and how I approach it.
2123.44s:  It's generally going to be a lower severity move potential for stuff like that.
2127.92s:  And again, this is in general.
2129.84s:  There are a lot of companies that over the last five years have had seen insane growth
2136.64s:  that then have a material change.
2138.72s:  So, there 52 week lows can be very high.
2141.68s:  And then if something is breaking through, it's 52 week low,
2144.08s:  that can just be the beginning of the party.
2146.40s:  But I'm just saying in general, like if you run a scan to look at a bunch of them,
2150.40s:  this is more the kind of stuff that you'll find,
2153.04s:  which is stuff that's just like really hovering near lows.
2157.44s:  So, yeah, definitely could do.
2160.64s:  I don't think there's anything wrong with it,
2162.16s:  but let's take a quick look, actually.
2164.48s:  Let's just see if we can...
2170.56s:  What do we want to do?
2174.08s:  Let's do...
2176.24s:  Yeah, I mean, we can modify this one.
2178.48s:  So, total open interest, we definitely would want to increase this.
2189.20s:  Options, we really don't need that.
2193.12s:  Volume price probably raised this.
2196.64s:  We want stuff.
2198.24s:  We really don't care how it did for the last year, to be honest.
2204.56s:  So, this one I would actually delete.
2206.72s:  I don't care so much about that.
2208.96s:  And then we'll add like 52 week lows.
2222.48s:  Here we go.
2229.36s:  New low date.
2230.80s:  One year low date.
2238.16s:  So, we want something that's posted lows recently.
2241.92s:  So, we'll do it within the last two sessions.
2248.72s:  And then the other that we can do is the number of new lows
2257.12s:  for a year.
2261.12s:  And let's say over the last year, we want something that's made at least five.
2269.44s:  And what I'll do is I'll modify this number so that we can look at different versions.
2276.32s:  All right, so let's...
2277.76s:  We'll save this as like 52 week lows.
2283.60s:  This will be like new.
2286.00s:  52 week lows.
2287.60s:  This is fine.
2290.24s:  I don't want an alert for it though.
2293.92s:  So, let's see.
2300.96s:  I'm going to move this over and then we'll flip through this.
2304.08s:  There's not a ton of them.
2305.28s:  So, we'll see.
2307.12s:  Let's take a look at CORZ.
2309.52s:  This has been on the docket a few times.
2313.20s:  And then let's zoom this out over a year.
2317.52s:  So, like for this, over the last 52 weeks, this would have a ways to go
2325.36s:  before it's actually hitting the lows.
2327.44s:  Actually, why would this even be in here?
2330.56s:  New year to date...
2332.08s:  Oh, that's why.
2334.32s:  Because I clicked the wrong thing.
2335.52s:  I was like, this shouldn't be in here.
2338.16s:  This should be...
2338.96s:  New low date, one year low date, that's better.
2349.04s:  That's better.
2349.84s:  Okay, sorry.
2350.56s:  I have to redo this scan.
2352.40s:  Okay, we're back at it.
2353.60s:  So, Microsoft is one of them.
2358.48s:  So, now, this just hit its first 52 week low.
2364.32s:  Notice the difference with Microsoft.
2366.88s:  Microsoft is super high, meaning the price level.
2372.56s:  So, this posting a new 52 week low, I think is entirely viable as a candidate.
2382.24s:  So, a way you can fix this in your scanning.
2386.64s:  If you wanted to be efficient and you wanted to use new 52 week lows, which I do think is
2391.92s:  viable, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head.
2394.00s:  It's something that's easy to study.
2396.48s:  But what I would do is I would actually add another filter that requires over the last five
2403.52s:  years, the stock to have gained a certain percentage.
2408.80s:  Because then, over the last five years, it's gained enough where over the last one year,
2412.96s:  it's now hitting lows.
2414.08s:  It means it still potentially has a ways to go to the downside.
2417.28s:  Whereas a lot of the other things that you will find near 52 week lows,
2420.56s:  if you scan for that outright, it's stuff that just kind of looks shitty.
2424.48s:  I mean, the interesting thing here is that if we zoom this out to a year,
2429.92s:  you can see how flat even the 200 day moving average is.
2435.44s:  So, I find that interesting because this new low is posted, like,
2442.40s:  immediately following earnings.
2444.72s:  Had a good earnings, too.
2445.76s:  It actually beat a little bit, which is interesting.
2448.72s:  So, yeah,
2452.40s:  super high implied volatility percentile, too.
2454.80s:  This actually looks like a good work call.
2458.32s:  Great.
2461.52s:  People are betting it to the upside.
2471.60s:  You can do like a 25 delta,
2474.32s:  less than 50% chance of a touch at the 405s.
2478.08s:  I think this.
2478.72s:  I will add this to my list.
2493.20s:  Oh, what is this?
2494.56s:  MSFT.
2496.96s:  Worked.
2500.24s:  This one's interesting, too, because what was it?
2502.40s:  Just yesterday, we talked about cores, CORZ.
2506.72s:  And this one still looks really good for like short premium as well.
2512.88s:  I ended up not entering today.
2514.88s:  I still have it down on my notes or something to take a look at.
2519.20s:  And then another one that we looked at for shorts from yesterday is not this.
2526.80s:  This.
2530.80s:  SWKS, which this one.
2534.40s:  No dice.
2535.12s:  This one leave alone, because this one is absolutely rallying on the last two days.
2540.88s:  And then we also had, I think we looked at CMTG yesterday.
2546.32s:  This one is short puts.
2548.48s:  This one still looks good for short puts, but this is more of a reversion trade.
2552.56s:  I ended up not putting anything on in it in the primary count, just because it's way too small,
2557.20s:  but I ended up trading this one in my brother's account.
2560.72s:  So yeah, anyways, kind of got off rails there, sorry.
2567.60s:  Kenny says, sorry, I'm late to this.
2569.12s:  Did you do a market recap kind of in the beginning, not like the same market flow,
2572.96s:  like I typically do, just because I was mostly highlighting the specific relationships between stuff.
2579.36s:  Tommy says, Trump is trying to lower the 10 year bond yield.
2585.04s:  Yeah, I mean, Trump might want to do that, but with somebody like Trump,
2592.32s:  it's very important to listen to what he says and to kind of digest what he says,
2597.20s:  but then to also understand the reality and the implications of what he says.
2602.08s:  Because it's the same thing like one of the things that he talked about doing was
2606.24s:  ending the war in Ukraine within the first 24 hours of him getting into office, right?
2610.48s:  Like you have to understand that there's a bit of gamesmanship.
2614.16s:  So that's actually one of the, that's why you see so much volatility in the markets is because
2618.88s:  the markets is trying to do their absolute best to discern between the shit that matters a lot
2625.20s:  and is probably going to happen and Trump is taking seriously versus the shit that Trump is
2629.20s:  kind of just saying because that's what he does is say shit.
2632.32s:  So yeah, I think it's, I don't know if I would essentially take that as a trade idea personally.
2639.20s:  Reese says calendar spread thoughts was looking at them slightly out of the money on Nvidia,
2644.08s:  seems like a solid way to capture volatility with limited risk, but figure out missing something.
2648.64s:  No, I mean, that's about right. That's the nature of calendar spreads.
2653.52s:  The difference is is that again, it's like any other trade that you're doing to attempt to capture
2659.52s:  volatility is that it's going to take a directional tilt and it's really important at
2664.24s:  least to have a game plan. That's why most of us that will trade term structure of all, which
2670.00s:  I absolutely do. I'll give you an example of something like that. Let's see if we can find,
2675.12s:  normally it's stuff that has really distorted volatility. So let's see if we can find something
2681.28s:  that has high vol really fast. Let's do five volatility percentile. Let's see what this gives us.
2692.72s:  Let's take a look at MT. Yeah, 100% implied volatility percentile. Actually, this is a losing trade.
2701.36s:  I had, I got stopped out today because I traded it on this breakout above. I added to it and then
2709.92s:  gap down today. So that one's dead. But anyways, let's take a look at the vol in here.
2720.56s:  We'll do that out of the monies. Let's do the main explorations. Like this. This is a great example.
2728.32s:  The 42s. So the 42s in 20 June look expensive relative to the 17 Aprils, the 42s. So there's different
2737.12s:  ways that you can set this up. But we can essentially say in April, we like the 42s. So we try to
2745.36s:  get them at something that's even remotely reasonable. And then the 42s in 20 June look expensive to us.
2757.84s:  20 June, 42s, super wide bid aspect. That's actually why it's like this. The market price is
2765.12s:  stuff pretty well. So that's the reason why you see that peak. It's just a bit of spread gap.
2770.16s:  But we can eyeball what this might be. So 40, 30, 25, 55, 40. The the ask on this side is probably
2779.52s:  like 50 cents or 45 cents. So I would guess that this would actually be closer to like 40 cents.
2786.48s:  If you were to sell it, something like that. So you can attempt to trade the capture of the
2794.80s:  volatility in here. Now it looks really wacky because of the super wide bid aspect.
2800.64s:  But there's different ways to try to play that relative volatility between them. Now I want to show
2805.84s:  you the downside of this though is because if you take a look at the delta's here,
2811.52s:  the and this won't be a 25 delta. By the way, the delta here will be much lower again. It's because
2816.16s:  the bid aspect is super, super contorted. But if we even just try to get a context of what the
2821.76s:  delta might be here for the 42s, let's just go to the one 93s and let's see what the 42s delta is.
2829.20s:  So it might actually be it's the oh no, because these are also super wide bid aspect as just
2834.24s:  super liquid. That's why. So anyways, the broader point being when you're trading these kinds of
2841.12s:  positions, right? And we're trying to gain exposure to the same strike across terms.
2846.40s:  You're going to have different Greeks that impact both of these differently. So the problem with
2851.76s:  that is that if we're shorter long the front month, it doesn't matter, right? The impacts will be
2855.60s:  different depending on the position. But depending on what you choose to do in the front month,
2859.36s:  it's going to have an accelerated Greek profile than the stuff that's further out in time. But the
2863.52s:  stuff that's further out in time is going to have a higher Vega impact. So you have to have methods
2869.36s:  effectively to manage all of that if you're trying to actually isolate volatility. So yeah,
2877.68s:  absolutely can do, but it's a little bit challenging and it requires way more delta hedging.
2887.04s:  This is when I'm trading things like short straddles or strangles, I rarely will delta hedge.
2892.80s:  I'll kind of just run different bands. But beyond the bands, I widen the mouth quite a lot.
2900.24s:  Whereas if I'm trading things calendarized across terms, you kind of have to delta hedge a lot more.
2905.84s:  And that's just so that you can actually maintain the exposure that you're ultimately wanting to
2910.40s:  maintain. So I think he said that he was looking at slightly out of the money on Nvidia. I'm not
2915.60s:  sure which direction he means, down or up. But let's say that we're going on the call side.
2926.00s:  Let's see.
2933.12s:  So this, I'm just curious what it automatically has us do. It has us go into
2938.72s:  25 April and 17 April. That's funny. The decent example anyways.
2952.72s:  So this kind of trade where we can actually get it on for a debit, which is also kind of important
2961.84s:  for the or a slight debit, not a not a really large debit. This kind of thing will work.
2969.28s:  Just fine. Especially resting at the same strike. You obviously have to find the same strike that
2977.28s:  you're interested in though. Because for example, if I take a look at the 15 strikes in Nvidia,
2983.52s:  just at a curiosity across these two terms, 25 and 17 April.
2990.56s:  And we take a look at the 115s, like they're priced appropriately.
2995.60s:  So the vol that you're going to collect here is going to be very different than the
3001.20s:  vol that you might be trying to collect, which again, depending on what kind of volatility
3008.00s:  risk is trying to capture, this will be a different trade than just trying to collect the elevated
3013.92s:  volatility in Nvidia if we think that implied is going to trend over realized or whatever.
3019.60s:  So it's a it's a different approach. Nothing wrong with it. It's going to move slow.
3024.96s:  And if you're really like actually trying to isolate, vol you have to have a plan in place to
3029.92s:  actually isolate, vol. Otherwise, you're going to get a bunch of other Greek effects pretty fast.
3035.12s:  EHODGE says, how about commodities like gold and silver? Yeah, gold and silver. Gold has been on
3042.48s:  an absolute tear. So this move here is literally profound. If I zoom this out to give
3054.72s:  you like a broader context over a one year time frame, like take a look at this severity of this
3060.08s:  move comparatively from here to here, like a 15% move over a month or so, which is again massive
3067.12s:  for gold. So this near term congestion doesn't surprise me. Even though that the market is showing
3074.72s:  a lot of weakness on a near term time frame, and it's literally because of how much this thing
3080.64s:  is moved otherwise. It's had such a massive move. So you kind of have to expect this to take
3087.44s:  a pause at some point, especially with the relationships also between equities and metals being
3093.36s:  a little bit distorted. Now, silver, I think, offers a slightly different value proposition,
3098.40s:  because silver has been notoriously lagging, but it's still not responding as well. So I think
3104.80s:  unless you have a direct position or hypothesis on silver directly, I don't think it's really suitable
3112.64s:  for something to offset an equity trade right now. And then depending on again, what kind of move
3118.64s:  you might think you can get out of it. But silver has been so slow and boring that I haven't traded
3124.40s:  silver in quite some time. Now, one way you can trade silver is through the volatility, because
3130.72s:  silver maintains really, really steady risk premiums. So you can trade it from that lens. But yeah.
3143.84s:  Ben says, can you explain the different volatility metrics you're given by the platform? Sure.
3148.48s:  What volatility metrics are you referring to? Talk to me. I guess we'll just go back to
3154.48s:  this one. Which of all metrics, senior Ben? Mateusz says, what do we think of the continued
3166.32s:  bleeding of Tesla during aftermarket now at 215? Now, my biggest issue with Tesla is I closed out
3175.28s:  two-thirds of the short idiot. Go back to my example before of essentially never timing things
3182.88s:  the way that I want. There's a prime example of that. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Now joking aside,
3191.28s:  I think Tesla is just going to continue to get punished here. I mean, implied volatility is
3198.64s:  about as high as it can possibly get. So I think you're very likely to see that
3205.76s:  continueated move for sure. And then it looks like Ben is asking about what you see in the chain?
3217.92s:  Oh, easy. We talked about this not too long ago. One second, let me grab the stream for you.
3224.88s:  This one. So Ben, this stream goes through all of that. I don't want to waste a bunch of time,
3232.00s:  just because people will be mostly familiar with it. But the way to think about it inside the chain,
3237.04s:  you have term-vol for the specific volatility. You have specific option-vol here. You have underlying
3244.16s:  vol here, which is IV, IV percentile. And again, the IV percentile is actually IV rank. But this is
3251.28s:  30-day vol. That's what you see here. So that's like the cliff notes version of what you'll find.
3257.12s:  But that video goes through all of it more in detail.
3262.16s:  Scott says, GME crashing into earnings. Scott is shocked. I mean, I don't even think this is
3272.32s:  necessarily GME crashing, to be honest with you. I think that this is very much
3278.16s:  broader market is collapsing. The and GameStop is going for the ride. Most things right now are
3286.32s:  going for the ride. So this doesn't surprise me in the least to see this kind of price movement
3292.56s:  from GameStop, especially because if you think of things that are going to be more or less resilient
3298.32s:  in a bear market and then depending on how we think about the broader economy, GameStop is in a very
3305.76s:  delicate stage right now where it's trying to pivot. It's trying to figure out how to use money.
3310.56s:  So it does not surprise me at all to see something like GameStop really cratering right now.
3316.72s:  In the broader context of the market. So yeah, I don't love that it dropped below this though.
3326.16s:  Yeah, I don't love that at all. Because now it's essentially resting on the next primary volume
3331.28s:  node, which is right here, which I don't love. But market doesn't care what I want.
3342.48s:  What else would God? Mateo says the reason I asked about Tesla is because today it was just about
3349.12s:  to buy a leap because they were highly discounted, highly discounted to what are you talking about?
3355.52s:  Good thing I didn't as it keeps going down, but my bias is still same opportunity.
3365.76s:  Mateo, can you expand on that a little bit? Like what do you mean it's highly discounted?
3370.88s:  It's at like, I think the forward PE right now is like 93, isn't it?
3381.28s:  Let's see.
3389.28s:  88. My bad 88.
3404.48s:  The trailing 12 months is 129.
3410.32s:  So what's the like, I'm just trying to understand the idea like where you're seeing a discount.
3416.00s:  And it's because I'm expecting to hear a common error, but I don't know. So I want to want to hear
3425.12s:  you out in case, in case it's not that. Well, it says Tesla's PE is in triple digits. No,
3434.24s:  I just told you what it was. Is 88. The trailing 12 months is 129.
3446.24s:  Here. Trailing 12 1229.
3449.60s:  Forward. 88 and a half. 89.
3456.32s:  All right, looks like we lost Mateo. I don't want to. Mateo, if you come back,
3461.04s:  just let me know what you're talking about in terms of. I just want to understand the
3464.40s:  way you're thinking about it because I want to be able to give you an answer that's more relevant
3471.28s:  to your perspective. Alberto says I'm late to the stream. I forgot about daylight savings.
3479.36s:  The latest was yesterday. Yeah, fucking latest hell. Elizabeth says for time and sales for
3486.48s:  VOD, which pretty sure is Vodafone, right? Good old VOD. Vodafone.
3493.60s:  How do you interpret the first line of data, the 0, 6, 48, 41? Let's see.
3506.48s:  How do we interpret this? 17, April 25, eight calls. So these are slightly in the money.
3517.04s:  And by slightly, are these adults of one? Oh, yeah, synthetic stock.
3527.28s:  This is stock position. 150 came in at the mid. Yeah.
3536.72s:  Slightly closer to the bid. So it could be synthetic short stock.
3546.32s:  That's probably it. I would obviously have to look at more of the broader context
3556.56s:  to see if that trade itself is holistically more anomalous so we can do that really quick.
3570.72s:  VOD
3576.72s:  Those are the eights you hit. These are not part of a spread.
3585.12s:  And they're capturing towards the bid. Yeah, so it could be synthetic.
3593.36s:  It could be a synthetic position or it could be expecting for it could be expecting downside.
3600.96s:  And selling calls against a long equity position for a larger player.
3606.48s:  But that's a really, really large trade on a relative basis.
3617.12s:  I didn't see this one today, but I actually haven't gone through my scanner yet.
3620.80s:  So my guess is when I go through my email in a second, this will be in there.
3627.36s:  Yeah, huge. The absolutely massive size trade relative.
3631.52s:  So this leads me to believe that this is somebody that knows something.
3637.04s:  And this looks like a
3642.96s:  again, expectation of downside one way or the other, whether it's somebody that has stock that
3648.96s:  they're selling options against or whether they're just buying the options to expect a pretty big
3656.56s:  down move. Great fine, by the way, who was that? Elizabeth, great fine.
3667.12s:  That's a very interesting trade.
3675.12s:  I'm actually going to set an alert here because to see, essentially, if you looked at the highest
3682.64s:  size trade over the, you know, proceeding 90 days plus, like $100,000 here and there,
3689.20s:  like this is a $5 million trade.
3694.24s:  So that definitely, definitely garners my interest in, yeah, very interesting. Good find.
3711.12s:  Let's see.
3712.08s:  Tommy says just because the stock drops 50% doesn't mean it's cheap. Yeah, exactly.
3719.60s:  I agree with that. That's why I wanted to see what Mateo is saying. Here we go.
3722.96s:  Mateo says I'm here. So my way of thinking is that 18 D 648 days out, leap contract at 70 delta
3730.16s:  delta or down 33%. I really see such a big drawdown on a two year out leap.
3736.16s:  Way I see it's two third of the price. Yeah, so that's actually exactly the way I was expecting
3741.92s:  you to look at it, which is exactly wrong. The reason why it's wrong is because that leap reflects
3750.96s:  the current value and sentiment of Tesla. And the recent value and sentiment of Tesla is a stock
3762.08s:  that has gone, wait for it, it has gone down 55.7% over the last month and a half.
3778.88s:  So the reason why you see those relatively so cheap is because the stock has become relatively
3787.68s:  cheap compared to where it was before. So I think a massive part of what you see there is not
3797.20s:  them being actually cheap. It's them reflecting the current price, which is again, it's a really,
3803.52s:  really common error. New traders make or just inexperienced traders, I should say, it doesn't
3808.96s:  necessarily mean, doesn't necessarily mean new trader. And it's because the value of that option
3815.76s:  represents the what's going on with the stock. If you found some sort of pricing discrepancy and
3822.08s:  that was the angle you took it, I could see that a little bit differently. But since that's not
3828.24s:  the angle you took, don't see it differently. And if we take a look at in terms of the overall value
3835.36s:  of it, and I assume when you say 12, 18, 26 here, if we take a look at this options chain,
3847.28s:  take a look at 75% vol, whereas the underlying upfront is 102% vol. So if you had framed your
3856.72s:  response as I think that this vol is cheaper relative to the stock vol, that would be an example of
3864.32s:  an objective lens where it is cheaper. But this is also very expensive relative to one
3870.00s:  expiration above it and a couple below it. So even this otherwise is expensive. So yeah, I wouldn't,
3878.24s:  I would retrain the way your brain thinks about cheap versus expensive because looking at it that
3887.04s:  way, just comparing something to its prior value, it really foregoes the analysis that needs to be done
3893.28s:  in terms of what is led to that change in value and why that's super, super important in this
3898.16s:  context. So good question though. All right, gang, it got me as two minutes over. I'm a pivot
3905.36s:  over star working on videos. If you need anything, let me know being out there. See you later.
