652.16s: Прisit
657.68s: looking for opportunities. And there are a lot of them. Now a very important note, however,
667.36s: with respect to market opportunities in this kind of context is actually very specific.
674.64s: The reason why it's very specific is because when markets go through these kinds of broader
680.32s: down moves, the way to trade them is very different than, again, what a lot of people are used to
687.04s: trading, which is the steady state constant climb up of the rest of the market. So we'll talk a
693.84s: little bit about how to find opportunities. Now this is more for a diversified options trader
703.60s: approach. And the reason why I emphasize that point is because there's nothing wrong if you
709.12s: prefer to be a long, only or a bullish side trader, like that's completely okay. The problem is,
716.16s: is if you trade that way, the market right now is going to be very challenging for you. Because
720.64s: even if you find pockets of strength, rising tide lifts all boats and lowering tide lowers all boats.
728.56s: And when you have the broad market breadth looking as poor as it does right now and rolling over,
734.16s: that makes it very challenging, even for the really strong names to do well. So what I've actually
740.08s: identified is the overwhelming majority of my directional plays now have absolutely pivoted
747.60s: to bear side players, a bearish side plays. And I think that's not always intuitive for people.
758.56s: So to summarize that thought, the way that I view it, you kind of have two main paths you can
765.12s: choose to go here. The first path is you can, if you prefer to be a long side only trader,
771.52s: it's a disadvantaged path. You're going to miss a lot of opportunities right now. But the way that
775.92s: I would be trading that is very short term holdings and trading things that are showing supreme
781.12s: strength, which does exist. So for example, if we look inside healthcare,
788.24s: just to elucidate the point,
797.52s: yeah, look at the breadth. The breadth is just overall rolling over. But anyways,
802.08s: let's take a look inside healthcare real fast. Within healthcare, if we sort this by five day change,
808.64s: you will find things that are still showing strength. So MOH is a really solid example that's
817.12s: showed strength and persistent strength. BNY is another that has shown persistent strength. So if
822.56s: I show you these two names really quick to give you the example, MOH, you can see it's been on
828.16s: an absolute tear. It's actually taking out these near term highs and it's posting new highs.
834.08s: If we take a look at another example, BNY, this is one that I've traded for a while now.
839.52s: And it's just because it's operating completely different and idiosyncratic to the rest of the
845.12s: market. So if you prefer to trade things to the long side, you can find them. But the holding
851.36s: duration for them is really nowhere near what it typically might be, at least for me. Because even
858.24s: if you take a look at this move here, this is gone from on the 18th to today. So 15 trading days,
865.68s: two weeks. That's a little bit actually on the longer side. Most of my directional holdings have
870.96s: been right around two weeks. So I didn't obviously bottom tick this. I've never really bottom ticked
877.20s: anything in my entire life. So, but the entries and exits I take are typically breakouts, right,
884.40s: above prior congestion periods like this here is where I got on BNY. So that's one way to approach
892.00s: things. The other way to approach things is finding different kinds of weakness. Now typically
900.24s: during a bearable a bull market, you have to look really carefully for weak sectors and then weak
907.20s: individual tickers within those sectors. And the reason why it's so important to structure it that
911.20s: way is because it's the inverse of what's happening now. Typically during a bull market, a lot of
916.16s: things can rally even generally just because the whole market's going up. So you have to be really
921.60s: selective. Now it's almost like a stone's throw and you're going to hit something that's going down,
926.48s: which makes it easier. But the way that I tried to time my downside trades is when the market starts
936.16s: to show rallies like we saw last week. So if you see on Friday, there's a little bit of a rally
945.44s: happening in the S&P 500 and same thing in the queues. The reason why that's an important days
950.72s: because what I do is I go inside the sectors and I see on those rally days, what tickers are
956.16s: just kind of treading water or even rolling over still. And those names become prime targets
964.16s: for shorts. And I'll give you an example of one of them that exists right now, which is
973.84s: CCL. So CCL was originally entered here on the fourth and then it was re-entered on the sixth
985.20s: and then re-entered on the seventh. So those are the series of different points where I've scaled in
992.80s: to CCL. And here's exactly why this one gets honed in on because this is something that's shown
1003.28s: in uptrend. And then it's something that has shown significant weakness against this near-term
1011.12s: broader market correction. This is a different approach than I typically apply when I'm attempting to
1019.04s: stack strength for longer term ideas. If I'm trying to hold something for six months to a year,
1027.36s: even three months, three months, six months to a year, this doesn't qualify for that kind of trade.
1033.36s: So it's important to remember when we're talking about stacking strength, it is relative to the
1038.24s: timeframes we're trading. And if you remember, the majority of my holdings right now for directional
1042.24s: plays were less than a month, two to three weeks. So what that means is we actually have to zoom in
1046.80s: way more. This is now my long-term chart. A three month daily is the long-term chart for something
1052.64s: that I might hold for two, three weeks. And you can see that this has absolutely been showing
1058.08s: significant weakness over this time frame. So then as we zoom into the more relevant time frames,
1063.36s: the 30 day and then the 15 day typically, you'll see that it's been effectively just a one-sided
1073.44s: move down here. So now it's just follow the trend. But there are so many names that look like this
1082.64s: right now. It is so easy to find things to trade to the downside. The important part is to make sure
1091.76s: that you have good risk management. The cool part is with the broader market showing this kind of
1096.64s: weakness. It actually gives you quite a bit of space in order to trade things differently. So for
1102.00s: example, CCL, this is on via long puts, which I knowingly overpaid for. A couple other trades that I
1109.92s: have short deltas on are like geo, but geo is via short calls. And geo is one of the ones that we
1117.36s: reviewed together during I want to say one of the pro live streams not that long ago. So geo is one of
1123.76s: them. Another that falls into that same bucket is ET phone home. ET is an example though of a
1131.28s: ticker that actually would have been better via long puts. Didn't know that. So the way that I was
1137.20s: trading ET definitely was via the volatility component here. You notice implied volatility in ET is
1144.56s: 98%. So a big part of what I'm doing here is just literally trading both the direction and
1154.40s: volatility. But this I use this as an example to show you that again, like I've been doing this
1161.04s: a long time. Anybody that pretends that they always make the right move and you know that that's
1166.24s: it's complete bullshit. And this is a good example. Like I was correct here. But the strategy that I
1172.88s: picked whole listically, if I were to look at just this one instance is suboptimal. Now for the
1178.64s: broader portfolio, it's exactly what I needed, which is a big reason why I went into credit
1184.96s: strategies. But there are two lenses to apply when we're evaluating stuff. So this now is also
1192.32s: closing below it's 200 AMA. So another really great filter to apply to identifying things that are
1199.28s: going down are things that are just getting through their 200 AMAs because it's just like a bunch
1204.64s: of names are just getting there now. Or other names that have fallen below a longer term moving
1210.24s: average. In this case, this is a 100 you can use the 50s going to lag too long now. So you can't
1215.36s: really rationalize using a 50, but using the gap between the 100 and a 200 is completely viable
1221.60s: to target things to the downside. So trades are literally abundant. You I could not find more names
1232.16s: if I tried. One of the other things to keep in mind is the volatility side of things.
1237.84s: I'm working on a video that's going to come out in a little bit that talks about the change.
1243.36s: Maybe I'll work on it today a little bit more, but I'm talking about the change in zero DTE and
1251.36s: one DTE trends over the last three years because daily's were launched in May of 22. And there's been
1259.44s: a lot of different market movement over those time frames and profitability for the subsequent
1264.56s: strategies. So the reason why I'm bringing this up is because one of the trades that I trade a lot
1270.72s: is a weekend trade. And without going super far into the details, the crux of that is the weekend
1279.68s: trade and SPX this week actually didn't work. But because volatility is so high, it still gave me
1288.64s: an incredible chance to exit the trade and essentially reduce the max loss by 50%. That's because
1296.16s: of volatility. So one of the things to keep in mind is even with the market moving as it is,
1303.92s: depending on the strategies that you use, some of them build in these little guard rails
1309.36s: inherently because of the volatility component, which you're going to see more and more of.
1313.52s: So just something to keep in mind is you're kind of going through your portfolios figuring out,
1318.48s: you know, what you want to do and what makes sense, what might not make sense. Because I mean,
1324.32s: the market writ large, I really, really believe is offering a lot of opportunities right now.
1334.00s: But it's not always easy to dip your toe in if you're not used to seeing these things,
1339.36s: which leads me to the last general point I wanted to mention, which is now is literally the perfect
1346.00s: time to paper trade to test ideas to see how things work to try different ideas. And it's not
1356.56s: just because we might not know how something behaves. It's also because it helps you build a
1364.32s: data set using actual market conditions like this. And the reality, like I was telling you at the
1372.00s: beginning of the stream, you don't see this many of these. So it's really important to get as much
1376.48s: data for these as you possibly can. So what I'm doing right now is I've reempted up my paper trading
1381.60s: data collection massively. And I have literally single, single one delta variance between the different
1389.92s: strategies that I have on. So what that means is if the base strategy is me selling a 28-put,
1395.68s: 28 delta put, if the volatility is over a 30% threshold for this specific option,
1402.32s: then I'm literally doing 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, literally all the way down. And same thing up to
1408.64s: a 50 delta. And it's because it costs me nothing. It's I literally just put them all on a paper
1414.32s: trade. And then I can monitor and see how they do. And then it allows me to conduct broader data
1420.24s: analysis. And I can say, okay, when the VIX has moved from 15 to 20 over the course of
1427.12s: X period of time, where do where does that typically bleed out into the delta that subsequently
1433.28s: show optimal for whatever strategy it is that I might be looking at? It's just an example. So
1440.80s: the message there is similar to what you've heard me say previously. But literally get
1447.12s: everything you possibly can out of the experience, everything. If you are not paper trading right now
1455.04s: and collecting data, I'm telling you, you are making a massive mistake, especially if you
1463.52s: are trying to trade seriously, right? Like if your goal is to be a professional trader that
1470.64s: makes actual money doing this, this is the exact work that needs to be done. And this is the
1476.48s: exact time to get a live look at an example like this, which is solid. So make sure you do that.
1484.16s: Okay, so I got a set 1722. I still have time, obviously, but I want to talk about what you guys
1492.00s: want to talk about. So feel free. If there's any questions you have, if there's stuff that you want
1497.04s: to look at, let me know absolutely happy to poke through things. Okay, so yeah, tell me before
1505.20s: it was talking about three-year treasuries. I think even before we get into three years,
1510.72s: I think we can just look at bonds in general. And eyeball what we think broader bonds look like
1519.60s: right now. Do I don't have ZB. Let's just add that here.
1535.84s: So for those that don't know, this is forward slash ZT, which is a two-year forward slash
1544.08s: oops, forward slash ZN, which is a 10 year, I'm actually going to reorganize this ZT and then ZN
1552.24s: ZB. So this is a two-year 10 year 30 year. And bonds right now are finally rallying a little bit.
1563.44s: The problem with the rally that I see in the bonds is that it still isn't as strong as it should be
1572.08s: at this point in time. So the play of trying to find your way into bonds here via a leverage,
1580.64s: I think is okay. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I still don't really care for
1587.44s: bonds to the upside personally. So if we use the 10 year and we zoom this out, it's still at
1597.36s: like a really important crux. Now again, it's made a great move. So if you're one of the people
1602.40s: that bottom ticked it here, that's great. That's absolutely fantastic move. But the way that I always
1609.28s: look at this kind of stuff is if it starts posting higher highs than this, then I become interested.
1618.24s: So this is actually hit a couple alerts specifically the 10 year for me. But it hasn't,
1625.20s: it hasn't really shown up to where I would enter in. Now the other entry point that did alert me,
1631.52s: but I didn't enter was in here. And it was on a breakout against this. It would have been fine.
1638.48s: It absolutely would have been fine. But one of the issues with bonds as of lately is you have to
1643.20s: trade them very carefully because of how strange the relationship to equities has been. So
1650.40s: it really depends on the longer term perception. Now I think trading it with leverage is okay. But
1659.28s: that induces a significant timing element. Like your timing has to be pretty good. If you're trying
1666.00s: to trade these with a kind of lazy timing based approach and you're just trying to get long bonds,
1673.12s: the leverage GTF, that can start hurting really bad really fast. And because this is still going
1680.72s: to be highly, highly sensitive to the different inflation metrics that we get going forward. So
1686.88s: the relationship between bonds and equities, I don't view it as normalized yet. I view it as
1692.00s: trending towards normalized, but still not there. And I think because of that,
1697.28s: trying to trade the direction and bonds, you almost have to look at it as just bonds. And the
1704.08s: new paradigm and relationship for just bonds versus trying to say, well, equities are going down.
1710.64s: A lot of times that means you can go long bonds. I wouldn't feel super confident in that just yet,
1714.80s: personally. Ayo James, what up? Good to see you.
1719.92s: Paulos says, what's propping up BMI? That's a great question. And a lot of it is future driven
1729.28s: expectations. So if you poke through and there's really two time frames that I think are relevant,
1740.48s: it's not just Friday and today, like today was on more medical drug expectations for the future.
1752.40s: But let me go, I want to go to like in here, which is where this is where like things really
1759.44s: started bucking the broader trend in this area. So like the seventh, let's see what it says in here.
1767.36s: Announce that the European Commission has approved up divo plus year boy for the first line of
1778.00s: treatment of adult patients with un, what the fuck is that word? Resectable or advanced
1789.60s: epitome cellular carcinoma. To hell of a word, I do not pretend, by the way, to know how to say any of these
1804.48s: fucking words. Obviously, I don't. Whatever this is, I can say carcinoma. I know that one. But
1810.32s: so that's a big price driver that you saw on the seventh. The medical sector in general has been
1822.32s: showing a lot more strength. So that's part of what you're seeing in B and Y specifically.
1828.56s: But like I was showing you one of the things that you can do to assess total strength is like,
1833.68s: you can see like what's up over a month, right? Gilead is up CVS is up B A X is up, Ab V is up.
1840.08s: Like there's a ton of stuff in the medical sector that's doing well. So they're also going through
1846.16s: a little bit of like varied reasons for the group of these. But there's a little bit of periodicity
1855.84s: to it. So you're capturing some of that. So I mean, a lot of these look strong Ab V.
1866.00s: Ab V is essentially hovering near 52 week highs.
1873.12s: Another absolute killer. I'm not trading this one. But this one also looks fantastic.
1879.60s: Now these look interesting from a short premium perspective. Because these don't tend to move
1885.12s: a whole lot. So in order to build a position in these at least for me, you kind of have to size up
1891.04s: because the total move severity is much lighter, which is fine. But with implied volatility at 90%.
1898.00s: I wouldn't be as jazzed to start getting a bunch of long calls or something here. So this is one
1903.52s: that I would be looking via stuff like short puts and just trading the broader momentum.
1916.08s: Paul says you bought just a plain long put. I don't remember what we're talking about, but yeah,
1921.68s: I buy single options all the time. Again, the way that I view single options for me is that I always
1928.72s: mentally bucket them as diagonals because that's always the potential route that they'll go.
1936.24s: The only place that I won't really bucket long options as diagonals is like if I'm trading
1941.12s: something for an expected earnings move, which I really just bucket those is Dgen,
1947.36s: options trading. We'll just see how it goes, which is typically not super well served. But yeah.
1958.88s: Paul says our companies that breached 52 week lows are close to it. Good candidates for
1964.56s: downside trends or downside trades. So, Paulo, for your scenario, I think it depends on how you
1975.44s: trade things to the downside. That's not like giving you a depends it depends answer to not want
1981.60s: to answer. It is because it really is highly relevant and I'll explain why. So if we're looking for
1987.36s: things, let's do just a price performance scan and I'll show you.
1994.56s: We'll build. Yeah, this one's fine. So I'm going to do negative over a year.
2017.04s: Yep, this is okay. And I want to show you the difference of behavior that you'll see in this group.
2022.16s: So first thing is let's take a look at different distances off of 52 week highs and let's sort this
2033.04s: by things that are essentially just hovering near lows like these and let's take a look.
2041.52s: So I'm going to cite what I was just showing you. I'm just moving it off the screen so I can
2045.68s: click through these faster. So, M A X N is one of them. Here's one of the issues that you will find
2053.12s: with stuff like this. So when you find things that make lows below 52 week lows, depending on what
2062.72s: the company is, sometimes you will find weakness that is nearing a floor, a perceived floor of some
2074.16s: type. So then if something is hovering or establishing new 52 week lows, the way that it's
2082.24s: doing that matters a lot. And depending on exactly the velocity and where the 52 week low is in
2088.80s: relation. So that's why 52 week lows, at least for my approach, tends to be a little bit too low,
2098.32s: specifically for trying to trade like a big downside trend. 52 week lows is a good place for me when
2104.88s: I'm hunting for things to sell short calls. That's very common. But it's because things that tend to
2111.20s: get down to 52 week lows, you're kind of late to the dance at that part at that point. So,
2116.80s: and it's again, not saying that it couldn't be done, but it's just the way that I typically think
2122.16s: of it and how I approach it. It's generally going to be a lower severity move potential for
2127.12s: stuff like that. And again, this is in general. There are a lot of companies that over the last
2132.88s: five years have had seen insane growth that then have a material change. So, there 52 week
2139.68s: low can be very high. And then as something is breaking through its 52 week low, that can just be the
2144.80s: beginning of the party. But I'm just saying in general, like if you run a scan to look at a bunch of
2150.16s: them, this is more the kind of stuff that you'll find, which is stuff that's just like really hovering
2155.68s: near lows. So, yeah, definitely could do. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. But let's
2163.20s: take a quick look, actually. Let's just see if we can... What do we want to do? Let's do... Yeah, I mean,
2176.64s: we can modify this one. So, total open interest, we definitely would want to increase this.
2189.20s: Options, we really don't need that. Volume price probably raised this. We want stuff. We really
2198.80s: don't care how it did for the last year, to be honest. So, this one I would actually delete.
2206.72s: I don't care so much about that. And then we'll add like 52 week lows.
2222.48s: Here we go.
2229.44s: New low date.
2233.76s: One year low date.
2238.16s: So, we want something that's posted lows recently. So, we'll do within the last two sessions.
2244.00s: And then the other that we can do is the number of new lows for a year.
2263.92s: And let's say over the last year, we want something that's made at least five. And what I'll do
2270.64s: is I'll modify this number so that we can look at different versions.
2276.32s: All right, so let's... We'll save this as like 52 week lows. So, be like new. 52 week lows.
2289.60s: This is fine. I don't want an alert for it though.
2293.92s: So, let's see.
2300.96s: I'm going to move this over and then we'll flip through this. There's not a ton of them. So, we'll see.
2307.12s: Let's take a look at CORZ. This has been on the docket a few times.
2313.20s: And then let's zoom this out over a year.
2317.44s: So, like for this, over the last 52 weeks, this would have a ways to go
2325.28s: before it's actually hitting the lows. Actually, why would this even be in here?
2330.56s: New year to date. Oh, that's why. Because I clicked the wrong thing. I was like, this shouldn't be in here.
2338.24s: This should be...
2343.92s: New low day, one year low date. That's better. That's better. Okay, sorry. I have to redo this scan.
2352.40s: Okay, we're back at it. So, Microsoft is one of them.
2355.52s: So, now, this just hit its first 52 week low. Notice the difference with Microsoft.
2366.88s: Microsoft is super high, meaning the price level. So, this posting a new 52 week low, I think is
2377.76s: entirely viable as a candidate. So, a way you can fix this in your scanning.
2386.64s: If you wanted to be efficient and you wanted to use new 52 week lows, which I do think is viable,
2392.32s: I don't have the numbers off the top of my head. It's something that's easy to study.
2396.48s: But what I would do is I would actually add another filter that requires over the last five years,
2404.64s: this stock to have gained a certain percentage. Because then, over the last five years,
2410.24s: it's gained enough where over the last one year, it's now hitting lows. It means it still potentially
2415.36s: has a ways to go to the downside. Whereas a lot of the other things that you will find near 52
2420.08s: week lows, if you scan for that outright, it's stuff that just kind of looks shitty. I mean,
2425.20s: the interesting thing here is that if we zoom this out to a year, you can see how flat even the
2432.88s: 200 day moving averages. So, I find that interesting because this new low is posted, like
2442.40s: immediately following earnings. I had a good earnings, too. It actually beat a little bit,
2447.20s: which is interesting. So, yeah, super high applied volatility percentile, too. This actually looks
2455.60s: like a good work call. People are betting it to the upside.
2471.60s: You can do like a 25 delta, less than 50 percent chance of a touch at the 405s.
2486.08s: I dig this. I will add this to my list.
2493.20s: What is this MSFT worked?
2500.24s: This one's interesting, too, because what was it just yesterday? We talked about course,
2505.04s: CORZ. And this one still looks really good for like short premium as well.
2512.64s: I ended up not entering today. I still have it down on my notes for something to take a look at.
2519.20s: And then another one that we looked at for shorts from yesterday is not this.
2530.72s: SWKS, which this one, no dice, this one, leave alone, because this one is absolutely rallying on
2539.12s: the last two days. And then we also had, I think we looked at CMTG yesterday. This one is short puts.
2548.48s: This one still looks good for short puts, but this is more of a reversion trade.
2552.64s: I ended up not putting anything on in it in the primary count, just because it's way too small,
2557.28s: but I ended up trading this one in my brother's account. So, yeah, anyways, kind of got off rails
2562.96s: there. Sorry. Kenny says, sorry, I'm late to this. Did you do a market recap kind of in the
2570.88s: beginning, not like the same market flow, like I typically do, just because I was mostly highlighting
2576.88s: the specific relationships between stuff. Tommy says Trump is trying to lower the 10 year bond yield.
2585.20s: Yeah, I mean, Trump might want to do that, but with somebody like Trump, it's very important to
2593.68s: listen to what he says and to kind of digest what he says, but then to also understand the
2599.04s: reality and the implications of what he says, right? Because it's the same thing, like one of the
2603.84s: things that he talked about doing was ending the war in Ukraine within the first 24 hours of him
2609.20s: getting into office, right? Like you have to understand that there's a bit of gamesmanship. So,
2614.96s: it's that's actually one of the, that's why you see so much volatility in the markets is because
2618.96s: the markets is trying to do their absolute best to discern between the shit that matters a lot and
2625.44s: is probably going to happen and Trump is taking seriously versus the shit that Trump is kind of just
2629.76s: saying because that's what he does is say shit. So, yeah, I think it's, I don't know if I would
2635.52s: essentially take that as a trade idea personally. Reese says calendar spread thoughts was looking
2642.16s: at them slightly out of the money on Nvidia seems like a solid way to capture volatility with
2646.88s: limited risk, but figure out missing something. No, I mean, that's about right. That's that's the
2651.68s: nature of calendar spreads. The difference is is that again, it's like any other trade that you're
2657.20s: doing to attempt to capture volatility is that it's going to take a directional tilt and it's
2663.28s: really important at least to have a game plan. That's why most of us that will trade term structure
2669.36s: of all, which I absolutely do. I'll give you an example of something like that. Let's see if we
2674.32s: can find normally it's stuff that has really distorted volatility. So, let's see if we can find
2680.80s: something that has high-volved really fast. Let's do five volatility percentile. Let's see what this
2688.80s: gives us. Let's take a look at MT. Yeah, 100% implied volatility percentile. Actually, this is
2700.72s: a losing trade I had. I got stopped out today because I traded it on this breakout above. I added to
2708.16s: it and then gap down today. So, that one's dead. But anyways, let's take a look at the volum here.
2719.60s: We'll do that out of the monies. Let's do the main aspirations. Like this. This is a great example.
2728.32s: The 42s. So, the 42s in 20 June look expensive relative to the 17 Aprils, the 42s. So, there's
2736.80s: different ways that you can set this up. But we can essentially say in April, we like the 42s.
2743.20s: So, we try to get them at something that's even remotely reasonable.
2753.04s: And then the 42s in 20 June look expensive to us. 20 June, 42s, super wide bid S spread. That's
2762.24s: actually why it's like this. The market prices stuff pretty well. So, that's the reason why you see
2767.12s: that peak. It's just a bid S spread gap. But we can eyeball what this might be. So, 40, 30, 25, 55,
2775.28s: 40. The ask on this side is probably like 50 cents or 45 cents. So, I would guess that this would
2783.28s: actually be closer to like 40 cents if you were to sell it, something like that. So, you can attempt
2791.76s: to trade the capture of the volatility in here. Now, it looks really wacky because of the super wide
2799.04s: bid S spread. But there's different ways to try to play that relative volatility between them.
2804.96s: Now, I want to show you the downside of this though is because if you take a look at the
2809.92s: delta's here, and this won't be a 25 delta, by the way, the delta here will be much lower again.
2815.68s: It's because the bid S spread, it's super, super contorted. But if we even just try to get a context
2821.36s: of what the delta might be here for the 42s, let's just go to the 193s. And let's see what the 42s
2828.00s: delta is. So, it might actually be. It's the, oh no, because these are also super wide bid S spread.
2833.84s: That's just super liquid. That's why. So, anyways, the broader point being when you're trading these
2840.24s: kinds of positions, right? And we're trying to gain exposure to the same strike across terms,
2846.40s: you're going to have different Greeks that impact both of these differently. So, the problem with
2851.76s: that is that if we're shorter long the front month, it doesn't matter, right? The impacts will be
2855.60s: different depending on the position. But depending on what you choose to do in the front month,
2859.36s: it's going to have an accelerated Greek profile than the stuff that's further out in time. But the
2863.52s: stuff that's further out in time is going to have a higher Vega impact. So, you have to have methods
2869.36s: effectively to manage all of that if you're trying to actually isolate volatility. So,
2877.28s: yeah, absolutely can do, but it's a little bit challenging and it requires way more delta hedging.
2887.04s: This is, when I'm trading things like short straddles or strangles, I rarely will delta hedge.
2892.80s: I'll kind of just run different bands. But beyond the bands, I widen them out quite a lot.
2900.24s: Whereas if I'm trading things calendarized across terms, you kind of have to delta hedge a lot more.
2905.84s: And that's just so that you can actually maintain the exposure that you're ultimately wanting to
2910.40s: maintain. So, I think he said that he was looking at slightly out of the money on Nvidia.
2914.96s: I'm not sure which direction he means, counter up. But let's say that we're going on the call side.
2926.00s: Let's see.
2933.12s: So, this, I'm just curious what it automatically has us do. It has us go into
2939.12s: 25 April and 17 April. That's funny. The decent example anyways.
2952.64s: So, this kind of trade where we can actually get it on for a debit, which is also kind of important
2961.60s: for the, or a slight debit, not a, not a really large debit. This kind of thing will work.
2969.28s: Just fine. Especially resting at the same strike. You obviously have to find the same strike that
2977.28s: you're interested in though. Because for example, if I take a look at the 15 strikes in Nvidia,
2983.52s: just out of curiosity across these two terms, 25 and 17 April.
2990.56s: And we take a look at the 115s. Like they're priced appropriately.
2995.60s: So, the vol that you're going to collect here is going to be very different than the
3001.20s: vol that you might be trying to collect, which again, depending on what kind of volatility
3008.00s: risk is trying to capture, this will be a different trade than just trying to collect the elevated
3013.92s: volatility in Nvidia if we think that implied is going to trend over realized or whatever.
3019.60s: So, it's a, it's a different approach. Nothing wrong with it. It's going to move slow.
3024.96s: And if you're really like actually trying to isolate, vol you have to have a plan in place to
3029.92s: actually isolate, vol. Otherwise, you're going to get a bunch of other Greek effects pretty fast.
3035.12s: EHODGE says, how about commodities like gold and silver? Yeah, gold and silver. Gold has been on
3042.48s: an absolute tear. So, this move here is literally profound. If I zoom this out to give
3054.72s: you like a broader context over a one year time frame, like take a look at this severity of this
3060.08s: move comparatively from here to here. Like a 15% move over a month or so, which is again massive
3067.12s: for gold. So, this near term congestion doesn't surprise me. Even though that the market is showing
3074.72s: a lot of weakness on a near term time frame, and it's literally because of how much this thing
3080.64s: is moved otherwise. It's had such a massive move. So, you kind of have to expect this to take
3087.44s: a pause at some point, especially with the relationships also between equities and metals being
3093.36s: a little bit distorted. Now, silver, I think, offers a slightly different value proposition,
3098.40s: because silver has been notoriously lagging, but it's still not responding as well. So, I think
3104.80s: unless you have a direct position or hypothesis on silver directly, I don't think it's really
3112.08s: suitable for something to offset an equity trade right now. And then depending on, again,
3117.84s: what kind of move you might think you can get out of it. But silver has been so slow and boring
3122.88s: that I haven't traded silver in quite some time. Now, one way you can trade silver is through
3129.20s: the volatility, because silver maintains really, really steady risk premiums. So, you can trade it
3137.36s: from that lens. But yeah. Ben says, can you explain the different volatility metrics you're given
3147.28s: by the platform? Sure. What volatility metrics are you referring to? Talk to me. I guess we'll just go
3154.08s: back to Nvidia for this one. Which of all metrics,
3161.04s: senior Ben? Mateusz says, what do we think of the continued bleeding of Tesla during aftermarket
3168.48s: now at 215? Now, my biggest issue with Tesla is I closed out two-thirds of the short
3177.52s: idiot. Go back to my example before. I've essentially never timing things the way that I
3183.44s: want. There's a prime example of that. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Now joking aside, I think
3193.12s: Tesla is just going to continue to get punished here. I mean, implied volatility is about as high
3199.36s: as it can possibly get. So, I think you're very likely to see that continuated move for sure.
3209.68s: And then it looks like Ben is asking about what you see in the chain? Oh, easy. We talked about this
3220.80s: not too long ago. One second. Let me grab the stream for you. This one. So, Ben, this stream
3228.64s: goes through all of that. I don't want to waste a bunch of time just because people will be
3233.28s: mostly familiar with it. But the way to think about it inside the chain, you have term-vol
3238.16s: for the specific volatility. You have specific option-vol here. You have underlying-vol here,
3245.36s: which is IV, IV percentile. And again, the IV percentile is actually IV rank. But this is 30-day
3251.76s: vol. That's what you see here. So, that's like the cliff notes version of what you'll find. But
3257.28s: that video goes through all of it more in detail. Scott says, GME crashing into earnings.
3264.56s: Scott is shocked. I mean, I don't even think this is necessarily GME crashing to be honest with you.
3274.88s: I think that this is very much broader market is collapsing. And GameStop is going for the ride.
3284.24s: Most things right now are going for the ride. So, this doesn't surprise me in the least to see
3291.44s: this kind of price movement from GameStop. Especially because if you think of things that are
3296.72s: going to be more or less resilient in a bear market and then depending on how we think about the
3302.00s: broader economy, GameStop is in a very delicate stage right now where it's trying to pivot. It's
3308.80s: trying to figure out how to use money. So, it does not surprise me at all to see something like GameStop
3314.00s: really cratering right now in the broader context of the market. So, yeah.
3322.24s: I don't love that it dropped below this though. Yeah, I don't love that at all.
3328.24s: Because now it's essentially resting on the next primary volume node, which is right here.
3338.40s: Which I don't love. But, market doesn't care what I want. What else would God?
3345.36s: Mateo says the reason I asked about Tesla is because today it was just about to buy a leap because
3350.72s: they were highly discounted. Highly discounted to what are you talking about?
3355.52s: Good thing I didn't as it keeps going down, but my bias is still same opportunity.
3365.84s: Mateo, can you expand on that a little bit? What do you mean it's highly discounted?
3370.88s: It's at like, I think the forward PE right now is like 93. Isn't it?
3381.28s: Let's see.
3398.80s: 88. My bad. 88.
3404.48s: The trailing 12 months is 129.
3407.44s: So, what's the like, I'm just trying to understand the idea like where you're seeing a discount?
3415.92s: And it's because I'm expecting to hear a common error, but I don't know. So, I want to hear you out.
3425.52s: In case, in case it's not that.
3428.24s: Well, it says Tesla's PE is in triple digits. No, I just told you what it was.
3436.16s: Is 88. The trailing 12 months is 129.
3446.24s: Here. Trailing 121229.
3450.40s: All right. Looks like we lost Mateo. I don't want to. Mateo, if you come back,
3461.04s: just let me know what you're talking about in terms of. I just want to understand the
3464.32s: what you're thinking about it because I want to be able to give you an answer that's more relevant
3471.12s: to your perspective. Alberto says I'm late to the stream. I forgot about daylight.
3479.04s: Saviit daylight. Saviit was yesterday.
3481.68s: Here, fucking late as hell. Elizabeth says for time and sales for VOD, which pretty sure is
3487.68s: Vodafone, right? Good old VOD. Vodafone. How do you interpret the first line of data, the 0,
3498.96s: 648 41. Let's see. How do we interpret this?
3511.20s: 17 April 25. Eight calls. So these are slightly in the money.
3518.00s: And by slightly, are these a delta of one?
3524.32s: Oh, yeah, synthetic stock. This is stock position.
3529.92s: 150 came in at the mid. Yeah.
3536.72s: Slightly closer to the bid.
3540.96s: So it could be synthetic short stock.
3546.24s: That's probably it.
3550.88s: I would obviously have to look at more of the broader context
3555.60s: to see if that trade itself is holistically more anomalous. So we can do that really quick.
3570.72s: VOD.
3577.68s: Those are the eights you hit. Ah, these are not part of a spread.
3585.28s: And they're capturing towards the bid.
3589.52s: Yeah, so it could be synthetic.
3593.36s: It could be a synthetic position. Or it could be expecting for it could be expecting downside.
3601.04s: And selling calls against a long equity position for a larger player.
3609.44s: But that's a really, really large trade on a relative basis.
3616.16s: I didn't see this one today, but I actually haven't gone through my scanner yet.
3620.80s: So my guess is when I go through my email in a second, this will be in there.
3627.36s: Yeah, huge. The absolutely massive size trade relative.
3631.52s: So this leads me to believe that this is somebody that knows something.
3636.16s: And this looks like a, again, expectation of downside one way or the other,
3646.72s: whether it's somebody that has stock that they're selling options against or whether they're
3652.64s: just buying the options to expect a pretty big down move.
3657.76s: Great.
3662.64s: Great fine. By the way, who was that Elizabeth? Great find.
3667.20s: That's a very, it's a very interesting trade.
3672.88s: So I'm going to, I'm actually going to set an alert here because to see,
3680.72s: essentially, if you looked at the highest size trade over the, you know,
3684.64s: proceeding 90 days plus, like $100,000 here and there, like this is a $5 million trade.
3694.24s: So that definitely, definitely garners my interest in, yeah, very interesting.
3704.80s: Good find.
3705.36s: Let's see.
3716.08s: Tommy says just because the stock drops 50% doesn't mean it's cheap. Yeah, exactly.
3719.60s: I agree with that. That's why I wanted to see what Mateo is saying. Here we go.
3722.96s: Mateo says I'm here. So my way of thinking is that 18 D 648 days out, leap contract at 70 delta
3730.16s: delta or down 33%. I really see such a big drawdown on a two year out leap.
3736.24s: Way I see it's two third of the price. Yeah. So that's actually exactly the way I was
3741.44s: expecting you to look at it, which is exactly wrong. The reason why it's wrong is because that
3749.20s: leap reflects the current value and sentiment of Tesla. And the recent value and sentiment of
3758.24s: Tesla is a stock that has gone, wait for it, it has gone down 55.7% over the last month and a half.
3778.88s: So the reason why you see those relatively so cheap is because the stock has become relatively
3787.68s: cheap compared to where it was before. So I think a massive part of what you see there is not
3797.20s: them being actually cheap. It's them reflecting the current price, which is again, it's a really,
3803.52s: really common error. New traders make or just inexperienced traders, I should say, it doesn't
3808.96s: necessarily mean, doesn't necessarily mean new trader. And it's because the value of that option
3815.76s: represents the what's going on with the stock. If you found some sort of pricing discrepancy and
3822.08s: that was the angle you took it, I could see that a little bit differently. But since that's not
3828.24s: the angle you took, don't see it differently. And if we take a look at in terms of the overall value
3835.36s: of it, and I assume when you say 12, 18, 26 here, if we take a look at this options chain,
3847.28s: take a look at 75% vol, whereas the underlying upfront is 102% vol. So if you had framed your
3856.72s: response as I think that this vol is cheaper relative to the stock vol, that would be an example of
3864.32s: an objective lens where it is cheaper. But this is also very expensive relative to one
3870.00s: expiration above it and a couple below it. So even this otherwise is expensive. So yeah, I wouldn't,
3878.24s: I would retrain the way your brain thinks about cheap versus expensive because looking at it that
3887.04s: way, just comparing something to its prior value, it really foregoes the analysis that needs to be done
3893.28s: in terms of what is led to that change in value and why that's super, super important in this
3898.16s: context. So good question though. All right, gang, it got me as two minutes over. I'm a pivot
3905.36s: over star working on videos. If you need anything, let me know being out there. See you later.
