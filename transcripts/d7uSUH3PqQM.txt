 I used options to make $26,000 last week on the SVB bank downfall and I want to walk you through the trades I made, same thing I typically do for my trade management videos. I want you to see why I did what I did, how I managed it, how I thought about the positions and so on and so forth. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. Let's take a look at some trades. So first thing we have here is the product I chose for this trade was XLF and if you know why, throw it in the comments below, but there is a specific reason why I chose XLF versus something else. Now for those that don't know, if we take a look at SIVB, which is SVB's ticker, you'll notice that on the 9th of March, we fell from 265 down to 100 and it hasn't traded since. And there's a bunch of different reasons for that, but long story short, it was halted and not reopened. So even though I wanted to trade SIVB, I was unable to obviously because it was halted. So then I decided to take a look at what else is tightly correlated to SIVB. And the reason why this is such an important note is even though my hypothesis was really centered on SIVB and the overall hypothesis is as simple as you think it is. I saw the bank failing and I figured I would be able to get in and take a little bit of a ride at least until I could get out. There's a lot of momentum with stuff like this and a lot of times it takes a few days to play out and I was getting in on 10 March. So a lot of the news broke on 9 March still developing. People are still synthesizing information. I want to walk you through only two of the trades I put on. I put on probably maybe close to 14 trades around this event in its entirety, but I want to specifically talk about two trades. So as I saw the opportunity here, I needed to find something I could trade to gain me exposure, but not be just market exposure. I did end up trading broader market exposure on Monday in the afternoon and then Tuesday, Wednesday. But that was kind of a follow on hypothesis. My initial hypothesis was that there would be a ton of volatility around the event and that financials would look weak. So with that, I started coming over here and I wanted to get an eyeball on what opportunities were there in the financial sector. So I went into the S&P 500 and I was specifically focused down here at capital markets, but also banks. I wasn't necessarily super concerned about bank liquidity, follow on bank failures. That wasn't the key of my overall trade hypothesis here, but I was specifically looking at two things. The first one is what was tightly correlated with SIVB. And then too, I had some reversion plays I was looking at the same time. So again, I'm not going to go super far into the trades, but like in Schwab. Schwab was one of the few trades that I actually structured appears trade to counterbalance all of the risk I had out that was short XLF. And this was actually a long play and it turned out to work out pretty well. But most of what I ended up trading was an XLF in its entirety. Now, I could have done something in the banks themselves or capital markets themselves, but XLF provided enough liquidity, especially in a high volatility event. So what I want to show you now is XLF, not ZLF XLF. And this is why when we started seeing all of this news breaking notice how far implied volatility skyrocketed. It went from trending around 18.8% for seven day vol implied vol and it skyrocketed up to 52%. So I knew that there was going to be some opportunity in here, even though it's a little insulated because it's the entire financial sector, it was still exposed enough that this provided a viable trade. So now I needed to check the correlation. And that's actually what you see here. This is how I validated the correlation. So if you take a look and I'll come over here actually to make it hopefully just a little bit easier for you to see. But if you take a look at the this is SIVV compared to XLF and if you take a look at the correlation for three day in a five day, the three day correlation is 0.996957 unbelievably high. And then the correlation for a five day is 0.9196 also very high. I'm looking for something 85% plus. And then what made me like this even more was the longer term correlations. I knew this was going to be a short term trade. But I wanted to see is this a new phenomenon that started to pop in or was this fairly persistent. And if we take a look at the 10 day, it was 92, yeah, 92, 93% and then at the 30 day was 89%. I didn't care so much about the 60 and 90, even though those were also very high. The main thing I'm highlighting here is that there was a lot of built in opportunity and XLF turned out to be kind of the primary product that I wanted to trade. So now what strategy am I going to use here? Well, there's a couple of things that come to mind. And the first thing though is I at the time I was placing this trade, I had no idea how all of this was going to come out in the wash. I had no idea. So I wasn't comfortable trading short calls. Now in a scenario like this short calls look very attractive. But the risk is not worth it to me, even though you have a couple of things working in your favor, specifically the expansion and volatility. It's the good short delta zone and so forth. The other thing is I wanted to trade the velocity and you don't get that with short calls short calls have a capped max profit. So you might get the move in your favor short call pale looks something like that, except this is typically flat. And as the underlying moves down, you hit a max profit zone. That's not what I wanted. So in this case, I actually did a few things. I ended up shorting XLF, but it became hard to borrow and it was expensive. So then I also had the long puts and I want to specifically talk about two long put strategies that I had around this. I had a bunch of other things at play, but this is kind of a really good example on how I like to play extreme moves like this with leverage is why I use options. And there's a specific way I structure these trades. So here they are on the 10th of March XLF was trading around 33 ish. Obviously moving all over the place, but it was around 33 and I bought to open 100 of the 17 March 34 puts at 87 cents. So what this means is those were like an 88 slash 100 delta that delta's were flying all over the place. They were in the money obviously. But yeah, they were pretty firmly in the money. So somewhere around high 80s low 90s and at points when I saw the trade, it was at a one delta before the move. This comes out to be an $8700 outlay. And then I also bought 400 of the 30 puts at seven cents. As you can tell by the price here, these were a very low delta seven delta. And that's a $2,800 outlay. So what's going on here? I'm exposing myself to two different functions of options that I'm very interested in. I wait this trade because there's less risk involved. And what I mean by that is since it's in the money, it's going to be slightly slower in terms of theta decay. If I didn't get the move on Monday, but it came Tuesday, but as you can tell, the trade was entered on 10 March. These were only one week long. So I was exposing myself obviously to a ton of long volatility. That's what I wanted to see. But I needed to move quickly. So by trading a higher delta here, this is very stereotypical to the way that I buy options. Anybody that follows the channel knows that I prefer to go further in the money. It's more expensive. But I start to get a dollar for dollar move faster. And that's just because of the delta. So for every $1 move in XLF in my favor, not paying attention. Any changes in volatility. But looking at just the delta, if XLF moves a dollar, I'm getting a 88 cent move. So it's pretty close. Now this is the trade that is more important. This is what I like to call a kicker and other options traders call it the same thing. But it's exactly what that sounds like. I am putting a smaller amount of money, but I'm going further out of the money. Why is this? If you know why I'm doing this, throw it in the comments below before I answer. Because there's two specific reasons. The first reason is this is a cheap way for me to speculate. And what I mean by that is the payout on these options, as you'll see in a minute, pretty handsome. But if you give them just a little bit of delta, meaning these aren't like a two delta or a one delta. I actually like to talk about a 10 delta, but those were a little too overpriced. So that's why I went to a seven delta. But in the scenario, it's a cheap way for me to speculate heavily. Even if this whole thing expires worthless, I'm only losing $2,800. I don't care. Now the other note here is in terms of the management on both of these. I'll talk about that in just a second. But the second reason is because of gamma. If I start to get a move in my favor, gamma is going to pick up rapidly. And as gamma picks up rapidly, it means I get bigger and bigger delta much more quickly. This is where you get those huge compounding returns in options is when you buy something that's pretty far out of the money and it moves in your favor with velocity, the payout is handsome. So that is why I staggered two different trades together. This was all part of like the same strategy that I was running, which was the long puts side of my speculation in Excel. In this case, the way I'm managing this trade, the trade plan here is I'm willing to lose all of this. And the reason why is I acknowledge the fact that I'm trading around a highly volatile event. I limit some of my systemic risk by not trading unsystemic risk, sorry, by trading the index ETF. I'm talking about things like something halting and getting stuck with an option that otherwise would be in the money, but it's not in the money because it was halted and not reopened before expiration. There's squarely things like that that can happen. Now the way that I think about these though is it's gone. This is an entire speculation amount of money. It's gone. And the reason why I think about it that way is if there is a big issue with liquidity or something like that, you can get stuck. So I didn't want to walk into this thinking, oh, I'm going to be able to pull, you know, in salvage the trade, especially on these because they move fast. Now my ideal management plan was these were going to I was just going to let these go. But if I saw them trade down to essentially a thousand dollars remaining value and I wasn't getting the move, I would have looked at taking them off. But this is a small enough amount of money. I essentially just wrote this off. Now this was going to be taken off at a 50% loss if I hit it. And if I could, but I want to make that abundantly clear when you're trading big events like this. There is always the opportunity for things to not work the way that we want to work. And if my entire strategy success was predicated on getting out of this at 50% it would have been a problem. And the reason why it would have been a problem is if for whatever reason I was locked out, then my trade falls apart. So that's why I have in specifically these highly volatile style trades. I'm going to have two different points. I'm going to have whatever size I put out. I am more likely than not going to allow that to be my maximum risk. And then I'm going to have my controlled risk portion. Whereas if I'm able to get out and I'm not seeing the conditions playing out as I thought they were. I will pull the trigger and exit at that point that applies very specifically to these. And this is also different than how I used to do it when I was rapidly trying to grow my account. I would trade on leverage. And that essentially means you have to have risk control and you have to have the ability to get out. But the other thing I was always prepared to do in those other scenarios was hedge. I would have other products queued up to hedge if I couldn't get out stuff like that. I wasn't looking to do all that here. So that is why size was my first risk control metric. And the second risk control metric was, like I said, exiting 50% on these right here. And then these I essentially was just going to write them out. But if I saw them trading down at a thousand total value, I would have accident if I could have to be clear. Alright, so what ended up happening? Let's take a look real quick at XLF. So this is the 10th of March. And you can see the way that it ran. This is the 13th. So this is Monday. This is actually when I got out. And if you kind of think about it, I got out early because I didn't deal with this day, but there would have been a lot of other great exit periods based on what I was trading. Nonetheless, I got out. And the reason why I got out on Monday is because it made my move when I was thinking about where I want this thing to go. I didn't have a specific price target because when volatility gets injected at that level, it's very, very difficult to pick a specific price target, especially when you're trading options because you might get to the price target. But then the options might not be having the way you think that they should. But I expected to see a pretty sizable move. And I got it to some degree. I actually thought I would have seen a little bit more of a move. So essentially on Friday, we closed at 3293. And then on Monday, we opened at 3176, we hit a low of 3137 and close at 3163. So it wasn't like this big giant move, but it was enough because I also got this beautiful implied volatility accommodation. So here's what ended up happening. Those 34 puts. So these ones right here that I bought for 87 cents or 87 dollars per contract. I sold for 232. So that comes out to be about $145 per contract. I had 100 contracts. And this is a 167% return on invested capital. Beautiful trade. The second trade here is I sold to close these 30 puts. These are the these are the cool ones because this is how options work. I bought those for seven cents sold them out for 38 cents. It doesn't seem like a bunch of money. It's only $31 per lot. But again, I had a bunch of them 400 contracts. So that represents a 443 return on invested capital. Those kind of moves. Obviously, they always look really cool because it's like, wow, seven cents to 38 cents, a 443% return on invested capital. What a great return. And as a just return basis, that is a good return. But the problem is is a lot of people, unless you trade those at size, not really walking out with a bunch of money, which you'll see in a second, it was okay. But it wasn't, you know, what you might expect for something that shows a 443% return on invested capital. What I mean by that is, I mean 14,500 on the 34 puts. And I made 12,400 on the 30 puts. So it's good, but it's still not as good as the something that was deeper in the money and cost more money on the initial outlay. But nonetheless, it was a great kicker because I only had a put 20 hundred bucks out. So this is why I really like combining these two strategies. If you get a big enough accommodating move, it can be very lucrative, especially if you trade the low delta options at leverage. However, if you don't get that move, there's a high chance that this just evaporates, which is why I like to tie this in because more often than not, if I'm trading speculative direction via long options, I will go in the money and then something at or out of the money. And even if the out of the money options start to decay away and they're not really doing what I need them to do fast enough. The in the money trade typically, as long as I get a little bit of accommodation, they typically will at least cover the cost of the speculative outlay at least not always, but that's part of the overall plan here. So came out to be in 11,500 outlay with a 26,900 return as a 234% return on invested capital. So this overall obviously simple trade. If you have any questions on it, though, let me know. I'm happy to dive into these. This is definitely different than what I typically do, but this is also why I think it's so important to be flexible as a trader because this isn't a place for me to trade the coverage of the trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade trade Can keep a short Dionys Hamilton economy Nash
