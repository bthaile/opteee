0.72s: what's up outliers quick Market recap I
2.68s: want to walk through what we're seeing
3.92s: today because I think a lot of people
5.16s: are starting to feel a little bit of
6.32s: pressure so I want to talk about that
8.20s: and then we're going to take a look at a
9.96s: little bit of GameStop because we had an
11.64s: expiration today and I will be stepping
15.56s: away from the daily videos for about a
17.44s: week and then I'll be back online
19.64s: getting right back after it towards the
21.28s: middle of August so let's get into
25.08s: detail here for those that don't know
27.72s: I'm in the process of going through a
28.96s: Rebrand so you notice that the channel
30.76s: is no longer es invests it's outlier
32.88s: trading I'm just trying to remove myself
35.32s: from the center of things es or my
37.00s: initials and I wanted to be about the
38.92s: community so this whole thing is grown
41.04s: in a completely different direction than
42.48s: I originally started the channel for
44.08s: which was literally just sharing some
45.52s: information with my military friends and
47.52s: I'm stoked to see it but I want to make
49.12s: sure I'm moving with the way that our
51.96s: community is moving so you'll notice I
53.48s: have a new website outlier
56.88s: trading. and pretty much everything else
59.08s: is going to be rebranded towards the
60.84s: outlier trading so yeah nothing really
63.48s: specific but in case you need to get a
64.96s: hold of me new email address Eric
67.80s: outlier
68.96s: trading. that kind of thing but anyways
72.32s: let's talk about the markets so we're
74.36s: seeing broad selloff across the board
76.68s: and a lot of this in my opinion is
79.28s: stemming from continued General weakness
83.28s: across the market and the funny part
86.76s: about this is I don't even view things
89.08s: as quite that that week like what I'm
91.84s: seeing right now I'm not saying oh wo
95.36s: this is crazy but what I am seeing is
99.52s: non-farm payrolls has absolutely
103.08s: cratered we can see that unemployment is
106.20s: going up we can see that essentially the
111.08s: rate that was expected was 4.1 came at
113.44s: 4.3 so this is just continued General
117.44s: broad weakness against what we saw
120.80s: yesterday which was also a layer of
123.48s: weakness and there's an interesting
125.52s: thing that you'll notice because of this
127.88s: if we grab the FED watch tool here and
130.00s: we compare the probabilities you'll now
132.48s: notice that the probability of a 50
136.32s: basis point decrease is now up to
140.96s: 75% for the 18th of September why is
144.40s: this happening well it's because as
146.12s: we're getting economic data that
148.60s: indicates econ IC weakness the
151.08s: expectation is that big Daddy jpow will
153.60s: then be forced to do something a little
156.60s: more drastic a little faster because
159.72s: these kind of weaknesses are just
161.12s: showing cracks but remember these are
163.44s: all lagging indicators so if it's not
166.00s: looking good now even if we make a
167.68s: change right now next month it's not
169.64s: going to look good the month after that
170.92s: it's probably not going to look good and
172.04s: you don't know exactly how bad it's
173.72s: going to get so to me that's also
176.68s: another reason why we're seeing the
177.68s: market behave this way because we we've
180.12s: had one of the strongest first 6 months
184.48s: that we've ever seen it was almost
186.48s: parabolic the market was up the S&P 500
189.40s: was up almost 20% in 6 months that's
191.68s: insane so when we're seeing some of this
194.60s: weakness coming out the market already
197.16s: in my opinion was at a point where it
199.16s: was very frothy people were buying
200.88s: Handover fist things still were very
203.32s: uncertain but we were kind of just
204.92s: following the information we had at the
206.64s: time and now that we're starting to see
208.80s: some weakness I think you're seeing the
210.48s: market react essentially as it should I
212.56s: don't even think that this is an
213.72s: overreaction if we take a look
215.72s: specifically at spy to start I know a
217.32s: lot of people use spy people will hit me
219.60s: up when I use SPX and they'll say like
221.12s: bro nobody uses that point taken so
224.52s: looking at the Spy you'll notice four
226.76s: days into the year we hit a low of 466
229.48s: and then we essentially just went on a
231.44s: parabolic rally up until 522 in the
235.12s: beginning of April then we went from 522
238.24s: is down to a low of 493 so a very very
243.44s: minor pullback and then back parabolic
246.00s: up to 565 so we're up almost 100 points
249.44s: on the year low to high and then now
251.80s: we're down to
253.40s: 53290 we're not even down 10% yet we
256.52s: haven't even entered a correction and
258.20s: people are losing their minds and part
260.72s: of this is rightfully so we've been in a
263.12s: very straight upwards moving Market but
266.48s: if this recent move is causing you any
269.72s: sort of stress concern your portfolio is
271.92s: behaving in a way that you weren't
273.52s: expecting take this as a shot across the
277.40s: bow that you have problems meaning the
279.96s: way that you're structuring your
281.40s: portfolio your trades your risk is not
284.20s: good because if this is freaking you out
288.16s: just imagine if this was actually bad if
291.16s: we actually had a terrible hopefully not
293.92s: but a terrible series of events similar
296.36s: to Black Monday where we're down 20%
299.08s: plus in a
300.44s: day that can happen so if you were so
304.88s: well positioned because you got overly
307.08s: complacent because the market was
308.72s: showing you one thing this is good for
311.40s: you this is a really good time to
313.40s: reassess what you're doing and make sure
315.68s: that your approach makes sense and
318.04s: always always remember the market goes
320.72s: two directions the worst day is always
322.80s: ahead of us we haven't seen it yet so if
325.04s: you position way too bullish because
327.00s: things are just overall too good cuz you
328.80s: don't want to miss out yeah well get
331.28s: ready for the shitty part of that this
333.60s: is why you'll see me when the market is
336.04s: getting towards highs that I become more
338.24s: cautious because things are at a pretty
341.16s: pricey point there so I won't comp out
344.68s: of the market because I never know when
346.40s: it's going to start to capitulate but I
347.92s: watch very closely and anybody that's in
350.16s: the Discord they knows that I've already
352.04s: started rotating out of positions
353.44s: earlier this week part of it is because
355.64s: I'm you know taking a little bit of a
356.96s: break but the other reason is just
359.00s: because we're near highs and that's very
362.28s: standard fair for me but we need to keep
365.32s: an eye on where these things go now
367.24s: something like NASDAQ has a slightly
369.44s: different experience and I think it's
371.56s: because it's had an even more aggressive
373.12s: move it's gone from 395 low up to
376.72s: 53 that's a massive massive move for
380.28s: this product and from there it's selling
382.88s: off hard I think a lot of this has to do
385.68s: with the fact that Tech is at a critical
389.12s: point here
390.32s: and it has been so so so overbought with
394.64s: people just speculating upside profit
397.08s: potential just focusing on the good
398.40s: stuff as they should typically I think
400.64s: but then when we have earnings and we
402.52s: have this broader Market weakness
404.36s: starting to show well stuff that's high
407.08s: flying typically is going to get burnt a
409.60s: little bit more so if we take a quick
412.44s: look at what we're seeing it's kind of
416.24s: just some continued weakness so
418.24s: yesterday on the 1 we had some weak
421.08s: manufacturing data we had some weak
423.60s: productivity come through stuff like
425.92s: that didn't necessarily wow anybody and
428.52s: then today we had a reinforcing of
431.88s: things like this non-farm payrolls
434.92s: cratered we saw unemployment rate going
438.28s: up from 4.1 to 4.3 so the market is at a
441.92s: point now where it's just so interested
444.56s: in how this thing plays out and you have
446.16s: to remember there's leads and lags so if
448.36s: we're starting to see this kind of
449.88s: weakness now the overwhelming
451.32s: probability is that what we see next
452.80s: month is not going to be super great and
455.16s: until there's some sort of functional
456.84s: change so the market now is trying to
459.80s: price in what they think big daddy jpow
461.72s: is going to do and if we take a look at
462.96s: the FED watch tool you can see that the
465.08s: probability now of a 50 basis point cut
469.20s: in September is over 70% that's a
472.48s: massive change to what it was before so
475.00s: if we compare that literally to just a
477.12s: day ago that was a 22% probab ility it's
480.12s: jumped up to
482.08s: 68.5% probability of this cut massive
485.52s: massive change in the reason for that is
488.88s: because we're seeing this weakness and
490.60s: the expectation then is that it's going
492.20s: to force daddy jpow to do something
495.00s: about it and part of it is now the
497.28s: market is getting a little skittish
498.76s: because we don't know exactly what he's
500.04s: going to do about it and we don't know
501.88s: how long it's going to take or to what
503.48s: degree so what that means for me when I
506.32s: look at the broad market now is just be
508.56s: cautious with the risk this isn't a time
510.56s: to freak out nothing's gone that
512.96s: terrible yet it definitely has the
515.16s: potential we're absolutely at a point
517.60s: now where the q's isn't a correction it
519.56s: just dropped a little over 10% total
521.84s: from this high so that bears respect but
525.28s: take a look the 200 day moving average
527.12s: is still positive sloping we're coming
529.20s: in on this giant point of control again
531.56s: that's not to say that it can't go lower
533.16s: I wouldn't be surprised at all if it did
535.24s: but this also isn't some crazy bearish
538.32s: configuration
540.72s: yet yet it can be it can become but the
544.80s: idea as me and the way that I look at
546.92s: this as a Trader is I'm not going to
549.88s: trade necessarily those projections
551.68s: until I start to see more evidence that
553.48s: they're coming to fruition although I
555.04s: will consider them and I'll be ready to
557.56s: adjust to them when they come up so long
561.24s: story short Market pullback definitely
563.88s: underway broad across everything and
566.92s: this is one of those things that if I
568.28s: take a peek through the very sectors it
570.84s: is impacting just about everything there
573.32s: are some slight slight areas of strength
576.60s: still like xlu and I go back to this
580.00s: perpetually with you guys you can see
581.92s: exactly where I was eyeballing getting
583.60s: in and the thing with stuff like this is
588.44s: there are typically pockets of strength
591.36s: even when there's broad weakness and I'm
592.92s: showing you one right here there's
594.52s: plenty of others right now believe it or
595.88s: not you just have to look for them so
597.80s: there's always opportunity whether you
599.48s: want to go long whether you want to go
600.72s: short whatever you want to do there's
603.32s: stuff in the market that can accommodate
605.44s: those positions you just got to look a
607.04s: little bit all right now let's get over
609.52s: to what the homies care about shout out
612.96s: to my eight peeps gam stop inside day
618.28s: very inside day so it was good to see
621.96s: just I mean it even minor semblance of a
624.92s: green candle but I didn't like that it
627.00s: opened below this we are still in this
629.08s: down onward Trend it's continuing now
631.36s: when I take a look at the volume today I
633.92s: am a little happier to see more of a
636.00s: clean split so there was 54% buy volume
639.44s: against 46% sale volume that's good that
642.52s: means that we're starting to get into
644.04s: these levels that people are interested
645.52s: in transacting at and I've talked to you
647.16s: guys about this quite a few times where
648.52s: I see those currently we can see this
650.60s: volume node building out right here
652.60s: still it's not all the way developed but
654.96s: at 1968 so it looks like something
657.08s: around 20 bucks is interesting to people
659.52s: and then after that the next volume note
661.40s: is at like 1798 but what this tells me
663.92s: is that there are still people at least
665.52s: interested in transacting but we are
667.72s: still negative sloping like there's you
670.52s: can't it's an objective reality as I
673.00s: look at this I know sometimes people
674.32s: don't like hearing that stuff but I'll
676.80s: reiterate it to you for the millionth
678.36s: time I'm not here to spread hyperf fud I
681.24s: am just trying to share the information
683.52s: as objectively as I see it and then you
685.72s: can take with it whatever you will I see
687.72s: something that's downward sloping from
690.28s: this peak high or this term High I like
692.96s: to call them on uh 17th July so what is
697.28s: this mean well we need to see where
699.12s: people are more and more interested in
701.64s: transacting and right here you can see
703.80s: some pockets of that right the fact that
706.40s: there was 54% buy volume mean that there
708.96s: are buyers interested at these levels
710.76s: which is kind of exactly what I was
712.40s: expecting somewhere right around in here
715.20s: and I think when I look at the the
718.36s: prospects for GameStop stop going
719.68s: forward the other problem that it's
721.48s: facing right now is just small caps are
723.32s: getting hammered small caps are
726.40s: struggling and I think that people have
729.12s: to keep that in mind as we're looking at
732.44s: their future and their future impact on
735.60s: something like GameStop so when I look
738.04s: at something like GameStop's options I
742.28s: see
743.40s: this the 20 September 22 puts there was
748.16s: 1,600 of them bought at
750.68s: 345 1,600 might not seem like a giant
753.76s: trade but it's not that's a massive
756.64s: amount of
757.52s: money so if I'm not mistaken I think
760.28s: this trade is like over half a million
762.72s: dollars it's like
764.72s: 552k so somebody is trying to take
769.32s: GameStop to the downside via some long
771.56s: puts which is really interesting to me
774.32s: because GameStop puts are still very
777.40s: expensive for what they are so the fact
779.76s: that somebody's willing to pay up like
781.28s: that I can't help but find curious and I
785.12s: feel like the only reason why you put on
786.48s: a position that size with something
788.80s: that's already gone down quite as much
790.52s: as if you expect more but I have to look
792.64s: at it as I mean how much more do you
795.92s: expect it to go maybe down again to like
798.40s: this 18 handle before you might look at
800.60s: managing that trade or something but
802.12s: that that's an interesting one that I'm
804.08s: going to keep an eye on now as always we
807.04s: got to pour one out for the homies
808.84s: because because there's a ton of options
811.04s: that expired today worthless tons of
813.84s: them tens of thousands gone salute to
818.36s: the
820.28s: homies it's a Arnold Palmer by the way
823.20s: very good so this again not shocking at
827.60s: all kind of standard fair for GameStop
830.16s: where this near-term expiration gets
832.08s: hammered pretty good now for total oi I
835.56s: am seeing thankfully the call side
837.92s: expand but so as the put side so we have
840.64s: 723000 calls to 390,000 puts and you can
844.64s: see a lot of these puts are being put on
847.12s: get it further out in time so we're
849.88s: seeing much more diversification in
851.80s: terms of the put expiration Cycles as
854.08s: compared to the calls the calls are very
856.28s: centered in 16 OG still so it looks like
860.80s: next week N9 OG is
863.24s: qu it does not look like there's a whole
865.68s: lot going on for the options chains Vol
868.04s: is pretty low 103.8 4% but we can see 16
872.36s: Aug Vol is already higher there 109
874.76s: definitely more active and much more
877.32s: position building going on in here so
880.36s: this is I think where I'm keeping an
882.56s: eyeball on going forward now last thing
885.72s: I want to note really really quick is
887.88s: when I'm playing something like GameStop
889.44s: personally I still have the shares I've
891.72s: talked about them before but I am not
893.84s: long any options right now and I'm
895.68s: waiting to go long options and what I'm
897.92s: doing is As game stop is going down like
900.08s: this I like to set alerts like this and
903.16s: as I see it cross above these different
905.52s: thresholds then I will consider starting
908.48s: to build out and add a position but I
911.84s: like to wait until it's starting to move
914.32s: in the correct direction as compared to
916.12s: buying it on the way down because I do
917.64s: not know when it's going to stop but
920.00s: that's me as Trader for other people the
922.40s: idea is to dollar cost average in on a
924.16s: regular basis and that can work out
925.64s: really really well but that's what I'm
928.60s: looking at as always any questions
930.24s: anything let me know the next live
932.76s: stream is tonight at 5:00 pm Pacific
934.52s: time it's outlier options trading for
936.96s: beginners we got a bunch of stuff to
938.20s: cover there be an outlier I'll see you
940.52s: guys later
