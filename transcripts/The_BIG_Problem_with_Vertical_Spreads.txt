0.12s: I hate videos like this it's because I'm
2.12s: going to be punching holes in one of the
4.28s: most common option strategies for new
7.16s: and small Traders this can
9.40s: disenfranchise people from Trading which
11.40s: is not my objective however above all my
14.72s: commitment to you all is investing
16.48s: without the so contrary to all
19.20s: the YouTube searches that you'll find if
21.28s: you throw in this strategy you're going
23.60s: to see tons of people talking about free
25.64s: money monthly income make a lot of money
27.84s: on a little money it's all that kind of
29.48s: nonsense and it's just not how this
31.44s: works what strategy we talking about
33.36s: today it's going to be vertical credit
35.68s: spreads this can be vertical spreads in
37.96s: general but I'm specifically talking
39.84s: about vertical credit spreads here and
41.76s: I'm going to walk us through five things
43.52s: quick recap on what they are the
45.24s: structure itself Pros cons then I'm
47.64s: going to talk about the big problems
49.12s: specifically and at the end of the video
50.76s: the fifth thing is I want to give you
52.20s: some Alternatives I'm not just going to
53.96s: leave you high and dry talk about all
55.80s: the problems with this and then leave
58.00s: you nothing to go off of but there's
60.76s: probably a lot of stuff in here people
62.24s: don't really understand when they're
63.84s: trading something like this and that's
65.24s: my hope to share information with you
67.20s: all so that you can make informed
68.40s: decisions so we're going to see whether
70.72s: or not you can handle the truth you
72.92s: can't handle the truth so what's up
75.68s: everybody Eric here welcome back to all
77.72s: the outliers and a specific shout out to
79.48s: the patreon family you guys make content
81.24s: like this possible for everybody and you
83.16s: guys also are the one that pay my video
85.12s: editor so he thanks you and if what I do
87.36s: helps you in any way consider signing up
89.20s: so that we can make better and better
91.40s: information and content for people all
93.96s: right let's get straight to it quick
95.96s: recap on what vertical credit spreads
98.40s: look like and this is a put credit
100.96s: spread here what you'll notice is that
103.44s: this is going to be a short option that
106.16s: is closer to the money a long option
109.08s: that is a little further out of the
111.04s: money they're going to be the same
112.76s: expiration the same type meaning both
115.40s: will be calls or puts and then there
117.16s: will be the same number of Longs and
119.48s: shorts
120.36s: so this specific example here is looking
123.28s: at a spy put credit spread you'll also
126.76s: hear them referred to is bll put spreads
129.96s: stuff like that I really stick to put
133.32s: credit spreads or put credit vertical
135.80s: spread put credit spreads to me is
137.56s: easier so I'm going to refer to it as
139.32s: that so in this case we are going to be
141.68s: selling to open one 29 December 448 put
145.36s: at
146.00s: $3.25 this is a 30 Delta option then
148.92s: we're going to buy to the 29 December
150.84s: 447 put for $32 this is a 28 Delta
154.80s: option and the net credit here is 23
158.16s: bucks that's what we're going to take in
159.76s: these are the payoff diagrams for the
161.64s: individual options in case you forgot
163.68s: what these look like so this is going to
165.48s: be the underlying price this is the p&l
169.56s: as always the short naked put is going
173.12s: to have unlimited downside that's a big
174.76s: problem that's why people like to trade
176.20s: these because when you combine them this
178.40s: is what your payoff diagram looks like
180.32s: and it's pretty cool you whoa not sure
183.24s: how I did that but we got it back
184.84s: because in this kind of strategy you
186.56s: going to have defin both profit and
189.88s: losses so that kind of gives us a
191.88s: Prelude into the attractiveness of the
193.76s: strategy the very first thing is you'll
196.04s: notice is that it is risk defined so as
198.84s: we reference this trade that we were
200.56s: just looking at when we think about what
202.68s: you can lose in this case if you're
204.56s: collecting $23 up front the most you can
207.24s: lose is $77 and you know that right out
209.48s: of the gate that is a great quality
212.12s: especially for new Traders because not
215.24s: blowing up is probably the primary
218.16s: priority for new traders in my opinion
220.72s: the other thing in this case is they're
222.04s: very cheap so the margin for this trade
225.16s: is literally your max loss so in this
228.40s: case it's $77 in this trade they're very
232.16s: high probability trades this one
234.00s: specifically has a 72% chance
236.64s: probability of profit which is great and
238.64s: they're efficient if you make your max
241.52s: profit here which is $23 that would be a
244.80s: 29.9% return on invested Capital if you
247.44s: annualize that it's really really good
250.60s: in terms of efficiency now let's talk
253.40s: about some of the primary issues before
255.76s: we get into the big one this is a low
258.76s: gross returning strategy in this case
261.32s: for a dollar wide vertical you're making
264.16s: $23 that's not that much money it also
267.88s: has more friction because there are
270.64s: multiple legs if you think about your
273.84s: commissions let's say you pay 65 cents
276.28s: per leg that means on the way in you are
279.24s: paying a130 for those that don't realize
282.96s: how massive that is on a
285.40s: $23 potential return that's
289.36s: 5.7% of your max profit gone just on the
292.52s: entry that doesn't include the exit and
295.04s: this also doesn't include the slippage
297.40s: that you are inevitably going to pay
298.88s: because of the spread
300.20s: so they're very expensive for what they
302.16s: are they also have a contradictory
304.72s: thesis in my opinion or they're just
306.60s: inefficient in their expression so what
308.20s: I mean by that is sometimes you'll hear
310.28s: oh if IV is high then you sell credit
313.64s: spreads well aren't you buying the exact
316.52s: thing you are saying is too expensive it
319.40s: kind of doesn't make sense and more
320.96s: important than that they're not the most
322.92s: efficient way to capture these different
324.88s: kinds of Expressions so we'll talk a
326.92s: little bit about that later and the
328.44s: other thing you are risking relatively a
332.20s: much larger sum of money to make a much
334.92s: smaller amount of money this is exactly
337.28s: why they tend to be high probability
339.08s: strategies so that leads us now into
341.64s: what the big problem here and it's
344.52s: negative expectation so this is running
348.12s: a back test from 2015 to today which is
352.76s: the middle of November of 2023 and it's
355.44s: looking at $1 wide options this does not
359.56s: include cost of commissions and you can
362.32s: see that total strategy p&l is netive
365.36s: 142 bucks this just looking at one Lots
367.80s: you lose money that's what this comes
369.68s: down to this is not even including fees
371.92s: which I was just explaining to you are
373.80s: really really bad so what's going on
376.44s: here well if we take a look at that
378.48s: previous example that I was showing you
380.84s: and we get back to $1 wide where you're
384.12s: collecting 23 cents in this case right
387.52s: out of the gate you have a negatively
390.32s: expectant strategy the reason being is
393.12s: because the neutral credit this means
395.64s: again sans's Feast not including fees
398.12s: the neutral credit you would have to
399.68s: receive for this to have a 50/50
401.96s: probability a zero sum over the long run
405.60s: is 31 cents you are collecting 23 cents
409.36s: you are nowhere near where you need to
411.24s: be in order to capture a neutral credit
413.64s: this is using again dollar wide 35 days
416.32s: to expiration so you might say well what
418.72s: about 3D pte what if we go shorter term
421.56s: same same this is a dollar wide
424.20s: collecting 19 the problem with most of
428.28s: these is that they are not going to be
430.32s: priced favorably to you that's by Design
433.44s: so even if you look at wider spreads
436.56s: let's say $5 wide $10 wide you're going
440.00s: to find the same thing in general you
442.72s: are not even going to be able to capture
445.40s: a neutral credit trade let alone
448.44s: something that has any sort of positive
450.68s: expectation baked into this so what does
453.40s: that mean well it means that you would
454.80s: have to get really really good at
456.96s: trading directionally right because this
459.00s: is a bullish strategy in this case when
461.56s: we're talking about the put credit
463.44s: spreads if you're trading call Credit
466.16s: spreads it would be bearish and in those
468.20s: instances there are much better ways to
470.56s: express that hypothesis than these so
473.48s: what does this all amount to death by
475.76s: 1,000 paper cuts you're not going to
477.76s: blow up on anyone's single trade which
480.16s: is actually a great component to these
482.92s: however you're not really going to make
484.56s: any money on them as you're trading them
486.40s: which is unfortunate because I came
488.24s: across them they were touted as some
489.84s: sort of really great approach for small
492.72s: accounts and then I was thinking oh man
495.00s: I'm winning a lot this is great then I
497.04s: started looking at the numbers in the
498.60s: long run when I started taking this
500.20s: stuff more seriously and I was just like
501.84s: oh I'm not doing anything here
505.00s: other than racking up commissions so
507.68s: this is the big problem with them they
509.56s: are deceptive you will win a lot very
512.28s: small amount of money each time you are
514.32s: paying way too much in terms of the
517.08s: friction for commissions and even the
520.36s: spread because you have two legs that
521.72s: you're dealing with so like I promised
524.12s: you what are some of the Alternatives
526.88s: well if you're bullish this is what I
528.80s: would do the covered strangle ratio
530.88s: covered calls ratio call diagonals
533.44s: buying shares you could even buy calls
536.00s: if you want and I have videos that talk
538.16s: through literally all of these which I
539.80s: will throw them in the notes below for
541.32s: you they all have their drawbacks a lot
543.40s: of these are more expensive so you're
545.60s: going to have to pick products very
547.92s: carefully they're not as efficient
549.72s: you're not going to have as great return
551.20s: on invested Capital however you can
553.92s: create better expectant strategies using
557.60s: these structures now looking if you're
559.72s: bearish again just a few ideas you can
562.04s: trade ratio put diagonals long puts both
564.80s: of those are completely fine or if
566.92s: you're trading volatility outright AKA I
569.36s: want to capture variance risk premiums
571.24s: you can trade short straddles short
572.80s: strangles I have videos in the notes
575.00s: Below on those as well and again for any
577.68s: of these if you have to buy the wings
580.44s: either to protect catastrophic loss the
583.00s: idea here is to go much further out of
585.32s: the money so that you are not giving up
588.12s: as much of the credit you're receiving
590.44s: specifically for vertical credit spreads
592.84s: again there's no free lunch here that's
594.68s: the problem that's the uncomfortable
596.24s: reality of trading options is just
598.08s: because vertical credit spreads or what
600.00s: are accessible to you it doesn't mean
602.24s: they're good there's a reason why you're
604.20s: not going to see a lot of Pros trading
606.32s: these and it's because of these reasons
608.28s: they're inefficient they really do not
611.20s: capture any sort of Advantage from the
614.08s: broad market in terms of positive
615.92s: expectancy in the strategy it is what it
617.60s: is man so you have to see whether or not
619.72s: you can reconcile that and make
621.24s: something of it again this isn't to say
623.28s: that there's never a point where this
624.80s: could fit into account but in general it
626.84s: is nowhere in my portfolio
629.45s: [Music]
633.64s: and after looking back at the amount of
635.48s: time I wasted trading them that's truly
637.68s: what it was a absolute waste so if
640.20s: there's anything I left out let me know
642.00s: if there's any questions you have on the
644.40s: video here any of the specific
646.12s: strategies throw them in the comments
647.60s: below I answer all of them because I
649.76s: love interacting with you guys don't
651.48s: forget be an outlier put in the work you
654.84s: can absolutely make this stuff work it's
657.36s: just going to take some effort see y'all
659.56s: later
