0.00s: What's up everyone?
1.50s: Run it through a quick market outlook for this coming week.
4.74s: We have a few things coming up and then I want to talk about DJ T, the stock.
9.58s: I want to talk about CRWD crowd strike and what's going on there as I'm still learning
14.74s: a little bit more about the technicalities behind it.
16.74s: So I thought we could do that together.
18.94s: And then I want to talk a little bit about how things like GameStop are looking for the
23.38s: week out ahead.
24.88s: So we have a few things that we're going to touch.
27.18s: First off, we can start with kind of a broad market overview of what events we have
33.34s: coming up this week, which you can see up here.
36.50s: We'll filter this out to be this coming week.
40.34s: And there are a few things that I think are worth directing your attention towards.
45.42s: The very first one is starting on the 23rd and it looks like really Monday is kind of
53.30s: super quiet.
54.82s: There are a couple earnings coming out.
56.78s: I think there's a Verizon stuff like that.
60.26s: So there's not a ton that I'm seeing there of significant interest.
64.94s: The 23rd is mostly home sales.
67.06s: So a couple of those will be larger impact, but not massively impactful either.
72.42s: The 24th is when we start getting some more inflation level data.
78.54s: This is really important.
80.42s: So things like the PMI from S&P, we will absolutely want to keep an eye on those when those
86.74s: are coming out.
87.74s: The market will probably be fairly sensitive to them as well.
91.26s: Then we have Fed Bowman speaking on the 25th PCE QOQ coming out GDP QOQ.
97.82s: Those are going to be massive really, really, really informative figures along with jobless
101.42s: claims.
102.42s: So as I look at this kind of boring Monday, Tuesday, then the 24th starts to pick up.
107.94s: The 25th has some important information.
110.58s: And then the 26th does as well with PCE month of Vermont personal income spending, the
116.74s: balance sheet core PCE.
119.78s: So yeah, this tail end of this coming week has a little more economic activity going on.
126.02s: And a lot of this stuff is still just very, very topical to the market.
130.50s: And it boils down to where we think rates are going.
135.74s: A quick look at the Fed watch tool.
137.74s: It shows us still with a 95% probability now of no change in 31 July.
145.30s: And then 18 September, it's a 97% probability of an ease, which this is even kind of interesting
152.98s: because the no change probability was pretty high.
155.98s: Then it dumped down is low as 1.92.
158.46s: And now it's back up to 2.86.
160.54s: Still insignificant.
161.54s: Still very, very low probability.
163.66s: And right now it looks like a 25 basis point cut as compared to the 50 basis point, which
170.42s: would be down here.
171.90s: So if we take a look at the just aggregate probabilities, you can kind of see what the
175.70s: market is looking at.
176.70s: Obviously here is where we are now.
178.66s: It's looking at essentially a 25 bips cut in the September meeting.
183.82s: Then another 25 bips cut in November.
187.18s: And then another 25 bips cut in December.
190.14s: My guess is after this first one goes through, we probably would see a pretty, I think a
198.18s: pretty significant change in these probabilities would happen there.
201.34s: Based on what I'm seeing from the Fed, I would find it hard to believe that they would
204.22s: just immediately go through this cutting campaign, although I think it makes sense.
208.82s: But if they've been so data oriented, I should say.
214.74s: And that includes leads and lags.
216.38s: That's kind of why I paused when I was saying that.
218.94s: Because sometimes it looks like they're being indecisive or slow to respond.
223.18s: And I think that that's part of it.
225.22s: But they continue wanting to see data.
227.14s: So that's why I lean, especially if they're doing these smaller cuts, like 25 basis points,
232.14s: sure you could do two of them back to back.
233.70s: But then I have to imagine you probably would take a pause depending on what data is coming
237.86s: in.
238.86s: It's really difficult running the leads and lags of these kinds of economic systems.
242.50s: I'm not going to pretend that I have any idea what they're looking at or how they're
245.54s: looking at it.
247.42s: But really for the market, this boils down to the market wants cuts.
250.74s: So if this starts changing where the market is not seeing the probability of a cut remaining
255.14s: is high, you'll probably see that flow through to the market.
257.58s: That's essentially the way that I look at it.
259.90s: All right.
260.90s: So that's kind of the main stuff coming up this week.
263.54s: Let's take a quick look at DJT because this is the easier one to start with.
267.66s: So we have our folks over here at Austin Private, relatively unknown, realistically before
272.18s: this.
273.18s: They do have some good Google reviews though, good for them.
275.26s: And you can see that there was a really interesting trade that came through at some point.
280.94s: So essentially right before this assassination attempt underwent, there was a massive, massive
288.94s: trade that came through.
291.86s: People thought that was interesting timing.
294.82s: And there's a little bit more to it than that.
297.18s: It doesn't boil down at least as far as I can see to that.
301.58s: So what happened here?
303.94s: Pretty simple.
305.02s: We saw this trade come through and this was the filing date.
308.98s: That is important to differentiate from when the trade went on.
313.22s: There are leads and leads and lags to when trades are placed versus when they are filed.
320.14s: So in this case, the position was on since 30 June.
324.22s: And this is when they chose to file.
326.82s: And this fell in line with when they tend to file their stuff historically.
332.58s: The other thing that we noticed here is that there was a pretty interesting unilateral
338.22s: issue with their data.
340.74s: And you can see that they use a third party vendor and they applied essentially a 10,000
349.34s: contract multiplier for everything, not just DGT, all their stuff.
353.58s: So this does look like a fantastically strangely timed clerical error.
359.30s: And this does happen.
361.06s: This is one of the issues when we have a little too much coincidence and we start going down
365.70s: the rabbit hole too fast, too deep because it is also not overwhelmingly insignificant that
374.26s: this fund is tied to BlackRock, which had some sort of relationship with the shooter that's
380.62s: now dead, thankfully.
383.38s: And that I think is interesting.
386.62s: But BlackRock owns pretty much everything.
389.46s: So it's not like that crazy.
391.54s: The other thing I want to point out to people is that if we take a look at DGT, the idea
396.46s: of putting on like a bearish position in here is it's not crazy.
401.66s: It's been going down since the end of March.
405.26s: It's literally had lower highs, successively and persistently.
409.18s: The lower lows is starting to chill out right here as compared to here.
413.10s: So you could argue that it's starting to gain a little bit of a footing.
416.50s: But this isn't something that you look at it and you're like, again, from a trading
419.46s: perspective, I don't look at this and be like, ah, bullish.
421.90s: This is going up.
423.22s: It looks like it's struggling and it looks like it's vastly going sideways if not slightly
427.34s: down.
428.34s: So I mean, this doesn't look great to me.
431.34s: So the prospects of somebody putting on a bearish trade in here in general is not crazy
436.10s: to me.
437.10s: Now again, if it were actually at that size, that would be nuts.
441.46s: But it doesn't necessarily look like that's so much of the case.
443.98s: So I just wanted to share that with you all.
445.70s: You guys can check out these articles at your own leisure so that as always, you can come
449.94s: to your own conclusions.
451.42s: That is my goal is to put information in front of you and then maybe help interpolate it
456.98s: as best as I can, but leave it up to you all to arrive at what you think happened or
462.14s: did not happen.
463.58s: Now the other thing that we do have to talk about though is this whole crowd strike business.
468.06s: And it is not insignificant.
471.06s: And you can see that it is massively impacting the stock.
475.14s: It has been falling off a cliff.
477.54s: Essentially from the 16th of July, we closed here at 369 giga and we hit a low of two
489.94s: like sub to 90 over the next three days.
493.62s: That is a massive down move.
496.02s: And this whole thing has a really, really big impact.
498.98s: So I thought I would play a little bit of this video that I've been watching because
503.42s: this dude knows way more about this stuff than I do and we can learn a little bit together.
506.86s: So let's get after it.
507.86s: It's by businesses.
508.98s: This has caused impact.
510.14s: I could never have imagined everything from business meetings falling apart to news networks
515.18s: being in a pretty funny state to the absolute chaos with flights.
521.42s: So what he's highlighting here is the broad based impact, which is really important to
526.30s: note by the way, for interconnected systems like this, when you have that level of impact,
533.30s: it is really difficult to isolate and fix things.
538.98s: So essentially there was this giant blue screen of death that started track just hitting
545.38s: essentially everything like this right here.
547.94s: So what's been going on with it?
550.34s: Let's see what else he has to say.
551.74s: I think he gets a little bit more into it here.
553.86s: Estigating breaches.
554.98s: So when a company gets hacked, they're the company you would call in to figure out why they
558.54s: were hacked, what happened and what the impact is.
561.26s: So if you were affected by something like ransomware attacks, this is the company that would
564.18s: come in and help clean up the damage.
566.54s: Because of that, they started creating a lot of software, think like Norton or malware
570.78s: bytes, but way deeper and their goal is to make sure anything that even looks like it
575.38s: might be one of the pack like that.
577.78s: A lot of companies require you to use this software.
580.70s: It's not like, oh, you can choose one.
582.82s: So what he's talking about is how pervasive it is and essentially how many companies are
587.80s: experiencing outages from it.
589.98s: We know that this is really widespread.
592.14s: It's across industries.
594.10s: We saw the airports getting hammered because of this right here.
597.06s: I saw a lot, a lot of news about it.
600.10s: So we know that the overall issue is significant.
604.50s: And I think the problem is exactly that I saw here based on the breadth of evidence that
608.98s: I see.
610.70s: This doesn't look like an easy fix at all.
613.30s: So I saw this come up on, what was this Friday that this came out, I think.
619.82s: And this is actually the CEO of CrowdStrike.
622.18s: So let's hear from him.
623.18s: Jim Kramer.
624.18s: This is what we have to speak right now that George curts the CEO.
627.50s: Due to a George, thank you so much for coming on.
629.66s: Turn around your company very well.
631.26s: First Jim, let me, let me start with, I want to personally apologize to every organization,
636.18s: every group and every person who's been impacted by this.
638.70s: A little bit more sure file that drives some intent.
642.62s: And what that means is there's a single file that drives some additional logic on how we
648.62s: look for bad actors.
652.26s: And this logic was pushed out and caused an issue only in the Microsoft environment, specific
660.86s: to this bug that we had.
667.22s: So that's an important note, right?
669.62s: As we talk about the overall impact and even from this other video when he was walking
674.14s: through the impact on the plane tracking that they saw this, it's clear that it's not
680.78s: fully impactful, right?
682.26s: Because if that's what it looked like before the strike or the issue, I'll leave it
686.26s: as now.
687.66s: That's what it looked like before.
689.22s: And then that's what it ended up looking afterwards.
691.42s: I can't get the time perfectly.
692.74s: So we're going around before this issue occurred and that there's after.
696.78s: There's still planes up there, right?
699.10s: Like it's still tracking something.
700.70s: So that tells us that obviously not everything is routed onto that.
704.38s: We identified this very quickly and rolled back this particular content file.
710.62s: Obviously many organizations are impacted, rebooted and we've fixed the issue.
717.70s: So the systems are coming up and running.
720.34s: The good old turn it off, turn it back on.
722.26s: I mean, I think that is about as classic as you could possibly get with having an issue.
726.34s: And it's really good to see that even the CEO of companies like CrowdStrike lean on the
732.30s: same thing that I do.
733.30s: That's great.
734.30s: Systems may not fully recover and we're working individually with each and every customer
738.70s: to make sure that we can get them up and running and operational.
742.14s: But to be clear, it was not a cyber attack.
744.86s: It wasn't anything related to that.
747.90s: It was a content bug or update that we sent out that we identified and we rolled back.
756.26s: So I think that's important to hear and that's the reason why I wanted to walk you all
759.26s: through this because it's something that I saw a lot of people talking about.
763.14s: And again, we get super deep into speculation in terms of how deep it goes.
767.18s: And anyways, that's what they're reporting right now as of the latest, right?
770.38s: Now, this is a really interesting event from a trading perspective because we, for me,
777.58s: I like to see the dust settle to make sure that we're not necessarily in any sort of
782.38s: giant problems, but I do really like to play reversion plays on stuff like this.
788.78s: So the way that would look is I would be setting stops something again like this.
794.26s: So it creates a really tight range for us to move.
797.62s: And if we start getting a break back up this way, I like that to the upside, at least
801.82s: to get back into generally where it was before.
805.30s: These news driven kinds of events provide really interesting pricing opportunities and far
810.66s: as far as market extremes.
812.70s: So anyways, that's something I'm looking at here.
815.42s: Now let's talk about GameStop quickly because we just ran through an expiration cycle and
821.14s: we had our live stream yesterday with my boy Newton.
823.14s: That was super fun.
824.62s: Learned a lot more about the company I continued to do so, which I'm enjoying greatly.
829.34s: And there's a couple really interesting things that we're seeing going on primarily in
833.66s: that we did see a decent move, right?
836.42s: So from the first of July up here, it's about a 20% move.
839.98s: And now it is falling back off.
841.66s: We're getting near a couple key levels as far as moving average and stuff like that.
845.22s: I don't care so much about that in something like GameStop necessarily to be completely
849.10s: honest with you.
850.10s: It's primarily because as I always say, I think it is different, really different price
856.06s: driving factors.
857.54s: So volume has been very light.
859.66s: This is looking at a one month volume scheme.
862.98s: And you can see that we're still declining pretty massively from what we were seeing even
867.86s: back in here, right?
869.54s: On the late, it's kind of like mid to late June.
874.10s: We saw almost double the volume that we're seeing now to a degree.
878.30s: So I'm keeping a really close eye on volume expansion.
881.06s: I actually have a couple scans specifically on GameStop hunting for that specifically.
886.78s: And from a trading perspective, there are a few things that I want to look at with you.
893.46s: First off is we have shed a lot of options.
899.22s: So across all series, all strikes, we have 571,000 calls and 350,000 puts.
908.58s: This is much, much lighter than what it tends to be.
912.54s: And my expectation is that I think we're coming into a quieter period.
917.18s: That's what seems to be happening here.
919.42s: A couple of things do stick out the volatility again for the front expiration.
924.30s: Just it tends to tick up week off.
926.02s: This is almost, it's pretty rock steady at this point.
930.06s: You can almost expect to see it.
931.42s: It's actually something I've been trading because I continue to see it.
934.46s: Now the other thing that I look at is where we see the next centralization of volatility,
941.58s: which is out in 16 August.
944.54s: So a couple of other things as I look at it are where do we see the majority of this volume?
951.06s: And you'll notice that the majority of what we have now is kind of split all over the
955.14s: place.
956.14s: We see that there's stuff out in 16 August that becomes the next main expiration cycle.
961.70s: So that doesn't surprise me.
963.50s: And then we see some of these pockets.
965.86s: And these are the 26 July's.
967.58s: There are some decent sized positions here in 26 July, although it is much slower to be
972.34s: abundantly clear than most of what else we've seen.
974.90s: But like this right here is not insignificant.
977.70s: The 30s expiring five days from now currently have 21,400 July with 16,000 volume from Friday.
989.10s: So this is people that are just sliding out a week.
991.82s: They're not going out super far, which again, you all know how I feel about that by now.
996.70s: But it's what's happening.
998.30s: And if we take a look at the further out strikes because these are the weeklies in not the
1002.78s: monthly, you'll notice if you go to the monthly, you'll take you out to 125 on the weeklies,
1007.54s: they keep you into the 95s.
1009.02s: That's just for liquidity.
1010.34s: As I continue to remind you guys, a lot of this is you're going to see less liquidity in
1015.54s: these weeklies, more liquidity in the monthlies.
1018.42s: And you'll see that expressed in the number of contracts that are there, the number of
1022.10s: volume per day.
1023.42s: You'll see that in the number of strikes offered.
1025.58s: It's a function of liquidity.
1028.18s: So anyways, all the way out here at the 95s, there's 14,000 contracts with another 5,600
1033.58s: traded on Friday.
1034.58s: And it looks like they're still building.
1036.70s: So there's more people moving out into these super far out of the monies as well.
1041.10s: Smaller positions.
1042.10s: The last I looked, nothing that looks heavily sizable.
1046.94s: And the last thing, well, let me summarize this at least.
1050.06s: So right now it looks like in terms of an overall participation standpoint, the options
1053.94s: chain is slowing down a bit.
1055.62s: We're seeing a slight expansion in near term, vol with the next real look coming out at
1059.94s: 16 August.
1061.62s: And the other thing I'm noticing is the disparity between calls and puts is much lower.
1067.42s: There's used to be two times two and a half times, three times more calls than puts.
1072.22s: And now it's almost even this is the closest I've seen it across all expiration cycles
1076.66s: in a while.
1077.86s: The next primary expiration cycle is starting to get built out.
1081.74s: Although there are a couple larger lingering positions in the 26 July's at the 30's and
1087.14s: then at the 95's.
1089.74s: So the last thing I want to show you guys is back over here.
1094.58s: And I want to take a look at not crowd strength.
1096.78s: I want to take a look at GME.
1098.42s: And I specifically just want to look at the volume for the previous week.
1102.58s: And the reason why I think that that's helpful is to see how people are positioning in the
1107.22s: near term.
1108.38s: So this you'll see that there are some still really large positions.
1114.90s: Most of these large positions are still on notice that these are still set 19 DTE 26,
1120.38s: 26, 544.
1122.14s: These ones have come off 89 26.
1124.78s: So a lot of these larger premium overall positions still exist.
1129.90s: So that matters to me because we didn't go through a massive exodus of open positions
1136.22s: that are backed by a pretty significant values.
1139.58s: They're still open and out there.
1141.50s: So I'm going to keep an eye on this.
1142.86s: I'm still is always looking for options activities and keeping an eye on everything else because
1146.86s: there's a lot going on right now.
1148.22s: Biden just dropped out.
1149.54s: Kamala looks like she's got the nod from him.
1152.14s: So that'll be interesting the way the market reacts to that.
1155.02s: So far it doesn't look like much.
1157.02s: The market's actually up with futures right now.
1159.90s: I see that you minis up 0.3%.
1162.94s: So Russell's trailing a little bit tiny little bit 0.28.
1166.54s: And then the NASDAQs recovering pretty well at 0.5% up so far.
1170.74s: Now these overnight opens.
1172.62s: They don't necessarily translate highly informatively to the next day, but it's not the inverse.
1178.18s: Where if you see these down really big the night before a lot of times, you'll see them
1182.18s: not looking great the next morning.
1183.66s: So there's not much to read into this in terms of what this does to price tomorrow.
1188.02s: But it does mean that standard behavior is really what I'm seeing here.
1191.38s: A little bit of a recovery at least because the market writ large last week went through
1197.22s: a little bit of a game.
1198.86s: Definitely.
1199.86s: We saw pretty uniform sell-offs across pretty much everything.
1205.14s: So there were a couple sectors showing strength, but seldom.
