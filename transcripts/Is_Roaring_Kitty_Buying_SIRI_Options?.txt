0.68s: at no point have I expected in my life I
3.84s: would be attempting to decipher a series
6.04s: of emojis to then try to infer potential
10.64s: trades by an online kind of Robin Hood
15.36s: Joker jucks to position our boy roaring
18.20s: Kitty obviously to see what moves might
21.28s: be happening it's absurd and I love it
24.52s: it's hilarious now I want to be clear as
26.40s: I've said a bunch of times I don't have
27.88s: the lore or the background that you guys
29.68s: do I'm not going to pretend to I'm
31.00s: actually going to spend very little time
32.24s: on this I want to spend way more time
34.60s: looking at Siri and I'm going to focus
38.16s: more on what I do which is looking at
40.56s: the options markets and looking at the
42.72s: underlying itself but this stuff is kind
46.04s: of funny so there was a member from the
48.44s: Discord MP that was asking if I win over
51.04s: Siri and I have not but I'm happy to and
54.76s: funny enough I actually have a trade on
57.36s: in Siri that I took most of it down and
59.72s: let a little bit of it back on but again
62.88s: as per usual for me with this stuff I
65.20s: had no idea that this was even going on
67.64s: I simply saw it pop up on a couple of my
70.24s: scanners so I established a position
73.28s: very small speculative trade take
75.44s: advantage of what looked to be a bit of
77.88s: a breakout so let me show you what that
80.36s: looks like to start which is on the
84.28s: chart basically if I zoom this in from a
87.36s: one year to like a 3 months I saw two
90.64s: things that really interested me the
92.68s: first thing was here on the 21st of June
96.48s: there was a massive Skyrocket in volume
101.80s: for the underlying itself so what that
104.04s: means is if I look at the day before the
107.04s: volume was 38.8 million if I look at the
110.08s: volume on the 21st it's
113.56s: 330 million massive expansion this
118.84s: triggered an initial alert for me I get
121.52s: a lot of these to be clear it's not like
123.16s: each one of them is a unicorn and they
124.64s: all work out great A lot of them don't
126.76s: but I'm very willing to monitor products
129.96s: that make these kinds of movements
131.24s: because there's activity and from an
133.52s: options trading perspective volatility
136.24s: is my friend whether I'm buying options
138.76s: or selling options I need things to move
141.48s: in order to make money so when I see
144.40s: stuff like this I'm interested so this
147.44s: popped off and what I did was immed
149.88s: immediately set an alert at this price
153.16s: level right here the 298 handle now this
157.76s: originally was screened out because it
160.92s: was sub5 I very rarely will trade things
164.04s: that are
165.08s: sub but when I saw this happen I dropped
171.52s: this price alert so I didn't buy or do
174.04s: anything here and it was originally an
176.40s: alert that looks just like this so I
178.24s: literally will set an alert that if
180.28s: there's a break Above This previous
182.84s: level it was a little bit lower it was
184.64s: like right here at like 295 right at the
187.52s: open the previous open on this candle
190.44s: and if there was a break above that I
192.32s: just wanted to know about it so what I
195.16s: get in alert on then is on the 2nd July
199.00s: and on the 2nd of July we see a break
201.68s: above that was pretty
204.08s: consistent and we still have much lower
208.20s: volume than we saw here
210.36s: but much higher volume than average all
213.32s: the way over here so what I do is I use
216.32s: this average volume to give me some
219.16s: context it was skewed a little bit by
221.56s: this day obviously but because it was
223.08s: only one day it came right back down and
225.76s: the thing that really stuck out to me
227.20s: here though was the fact that this was
229.80s: overwhelmingly by volume both of these
232.52s: days so as soon as I see a bunch of
235.60s: generally higher volume coming into the
237.84s: product vast majority buy vol volume I
240.28s: see a break above this becomes a small
242.96s: trade for me an asymmetric play I want
245.36s: to take it to the upside and I'm going
247.84s: to set a really tight stop and in this
250.32s: case the stop was 295 it was using this
253.72s: prior point of perceived resistance now
257.24s: turned support again I feel like with
259.92s: stuff like this you have to be so
261.12s: careful applying standard technical
263.04s: analysis but this is a much smaller
265.60s: subset of what I do as a Trader looking
267.52s: for anomalous things like this and
270.24s: mostly trading things like momentum
272.08s: which This falls directly into that
273.56s: bucket we start seeing some really
275.60s: strong momentum with a breakout this is
277.92s: early stages though so then we get a
280.76s: follow-on move on the third I end up
283.32s: exiting a good portion of the position
285.36s: there and I have some Runners that I
287.36s: left on now those Runners will
289.60s: essentially get stopped out at three and
291.48s: a half or less and that's it they're
293.48s: just going to go go do their thing now
296.88s: what's going on here I have no idea
299.72s: there's a ton of speculation that
301.84s: roaring kitties emojis translate this
306.04s: everybody was sure was the Fourth of
308.00s: July from what I saw from people sending
310.32s: me things in asking what they thought
312.36s: Fourth of July could have meant because
314.12s: this Co corresponded with that well then
317.08s: there was a new theory that came out
319.12s: that this stood for America and then
321.12s: this microphone stood for broadcasting
323.36s: which is if you look up Theory
325.32s: apparently on the Wikipedia page it
326.68s: shows just like American Broadcasting so
330.04s: okay maybe that's the case this is
331.92s: honestly one of the problems with
333.76s: attempting to interpret emojis to make
336.40s: trading decisions is not what I do uh
338.96s: but I find it entertaining to look at so
341.96s: I know a lot of people are curious is
343.72s: roaring Kitty now potentially building a
346.24s: position here in Siri and a lot of
349.28s: people are going all over the place with
350.92s: this because roaring Kitty's been radio
353.20s: silent since essential in terms of
354.72s: positions in since the 13th of June so
359.84s: everybody's kind of speculating
361.48s: especially after the chewy movement and
364.44s: some of the movement that we're seeing
365.80s: here everybody's wondering what's going
367.92s: on and trying to figure it out
369.12s: rightfully so because it's very very
370.92s: interesting so if we take a look now at
374.60s: the options change themselves there's a
377.32s: couple things worth calling out here the
380.32s: very first thing is this is a very small
382.96s: product there's not a ton of expirations
385.60s: there's not a ton of options if we take
387.44s: a look at the total open interest across
389.56s: Ross These very few expirations it's
392.84s: over
394.24s: 800,000 calls to 570,000 puts so to
398.92s: clarify what I said in case it was
400.28s: misleading when I say that there's not a
401.68s: lot of options there's a ton of open
404.20s: interest relative to the number of
407.12s: options available like if I open up this
409.20s: chain there's a handful you go from 0.5
414.00s: to 6 right so like in comparison just
416.84s: for context if you look at something
418.76s: like spy
420.52s: and we open up the options chain there
422.08s: there's there's tons and there's even
424.80s: right there's tons of options so that's
427.76s: what I mean here when I say that there's
429.28s: not a lot of options in Siri is that
432.48s: there's just not a ton of expirations
435.16s: and within those expirations there's not
436.96s: a lot of chains to pick from now what I
439.96s: find interesting here is there are a
443.80s: couple very very active chains
447.88s: specifically individual strike
450.04s: that I think are worth talking about to
452.00s: a degree although when I look at this in
454.60s: a broad brushstroke I don't see a lot of
458.88s: anomalous activity that would lead me to
461.40s: believe super informed sized convicted
464.20s: buying meaning people like ran Kitty
466.48s: coming in and placing cuz especially
468.92s: something like this if you compare it to
470.24s: something like GameStop where he was
471.76s: coming in with 5,000 lot 10,000 lot
474.44s: pieces to establish his position this is
477.24s: a fraction of size so you would you
479.68s: would have to be pushing some weight in
482.44s: order to get a meaningful position on in
485.12s: here now that's from the options
488.00s: perspective that's not to say that
489.44s: they're not shares transacting because
491.44s: this is above average transactions
493.72s: there's no doubt like even this again if
496.44s: we go back to kind of this this preed up
499.00s: period here we go back and here it's
501.16s: like 15 million1 million and then
504.60s: essentially from this point forward it
507.00s: doesn't get below 30 million so there's
510.40s: absolutely elevated stock
513.52s: transaction but from an options
515.60s: perspective I'm not necessarily seeing
517.80s: that because even though that there's a
519.44s: lot of options relative to how few or
522.88s: I'm sorry a lot of open interest
524.88s: relative to how few chains and Strikes
529.08s: there are to select from there's not a
531.92s: lot of correspondingly large sizes
534.72s: because again this looks like a big
536.36s: number 820,000 calls and it is a lot lot
539.60s: of OI but you're talking about something
541.40s: that's trading for $3 so if you want to
543.40s: put on anything up size you need to put
545.44s: on a ton of these so let's take a look
549.44s: at some of the chains and then some of
551.36s: the
552.56s: individual what I do find interesting
554.92s: from the jump I should say take a look
557.80s: this is 5 days to expiration take a look
559.64s: at how high the implied volatility there
563.20s: 195 why do I find that so interesting
565.80s: simple if we come over here and we take
568.76s: a look at something zoomed out a little
570.84s: bit more there's earnings coming up on
573.04s: the 1st of next month I would expect the
578.48s: the expiration cycle that includes this
582.76s: to be the highest IV in the near future
586.56s: I would expect this expiration cycle to
589.16s: be the highest so if I go there we know
592.36s: it's the 1st of August so the very first
594.24s: expiration cycle that would include it
595.60s: would be the 2 of August which is a
597.28s: weekly so maybe it you know could have
600.12s: slid out to the monthly for more
602.20s: liquidity sometimes you'll see that
603.72s: happen where even though this contains
605.16s: earnings the ones around it also can be
607.00s: elevated or even slightly higher if
608.68s: that's where people are going to play
610.40s: earnings not seeing any of that I see
613.52s: 195 here 166 here and then it dumps to
617.84s: 145 144 133 135 so if we check out the
623.12s: chain that actually has earnings in it
625.44s: directly it's this one it's only 14466
629.64s: compared to the next upcoming two in
632.84s: order 12 July 19 July at 185 and6 that's
638.12s: big now there's obviously a lot of
641.72s: IV in this front cycle because of this
646.48s: this is a giant move this is not a small
649.60s: move even though it is a very small
651.76s: product it's gone from 245 from the 13th
655.44s: of last month to 416 was the high it hit
658.68s: here it's a big move that is a big move
662.40s: relative to the size of this product so
665.60s: the implied volatility for the
667.92s: expiration Cycles is interesting to me
670.48s: and this is abnormal for sure I would
672.96s: expect the earnings to be much much
674.72s: higher now pivoting over and taking a
677.76s: look at the volatility smile for
680.36s: specifically the out of the monies and
682.36s: let's use kind of these near two terms
684.48s: and then where we see earnings a couple
687.36s: things one these are all ja Up Normally
690.20s: you don't see them crisscrossing all
691.68s: over the place like this and what I can
693.68s: tell you is from the one that includes
695.36s: the earning cycle notice how high the
698.00s: put side is relative to the call side
700.44s: this is an expectation of downside if I
703.92s: go in here to the 12 and the 19 July so
708.92s: for those wondering it's the blue and
711.36s: kind of the pink these
713.88s: two they still lean very put heavy so
719.76s: the market as far as I can tell broadly
723.44s: is pricing and downside then when I look
726.08s: at the transactions that occurred on
728.68s: Friday I see a few things I see the vast
732.08s: majority of puts
733.84s: transacted at the offer or higher
737.28s: meaning we're buying puts lots of them
740.08s: and when I look at the call side the
742.56s: majority 39% to 36% so a slight majority
747.12s: are on the bid side selling calls
749.76s: so that still tells me we're looking a
751.92s: little bit more to the downside here so
755.28s: what does this mean well this pop very
759.36s: interesting timing and I also think some
761.28s: of this might have corresponded with a
762.72s: couple posts that were on
765.16s: Reddit from the options perspective it
767.48s: doesn't look super interesting there are
770.12s: a couple heavy cycles and I also wanted
773.16s: to show you this now that I became an
777.52s: affiliate with unusual whales because
779.96s: this is a little easier to use for kind
781.92s: of quick research like this I still
783.84s: prefer pulling things down dropping it
786.04s: in Excel or Google sheet so that I can
788.32s: analyze it a little more in depth but
789.96s: this is super useful to be able to check
791.56s: out something like so what I did is I
794.36s: just looked back essentially over all of
796.88s: last month and the beginning of this
799.00s: month and I'm looking at things that
801.28s: transacted at the offer or higher
803.72s: meaning that we're buying on the call
805.76s: side specifically I'm looking at calls
808.36s: and I want premium that's at least
810.28s: $25,000 if it's under $25,000 it is even
814.20s: this is low for me from identifying like
818.36s: big players that are trying to speculate
821.08s: here so this is a low threshold and the
823.84s: reason why I use a low threshold is so
825.72s: that maybe I can see if there's a bigger
828.56s: player that's entering with a series of
831.20s: these smaller Trad the way you can
833.52s: detect that is you can see when they're
835.04s: coming in how close they are to one
836.64s: another and you can pick up on buying
838.24s: pattern you'll see centralization within
841.16s: the same strip you'll see consistent
843.76s: sizing to a specific degree things like
846.60s: that so when I look at the buying
850.56s: activity essentially over the last
851.80s: entire month the biggest trade that
854.48s: populates in here is this one right here
856.20s: at 195 so if we sort these instead by
861.44s: premium there's not a lot of big trades
864.40s: there's a 195k trade this is not small
867.68s: by the way this is abs absolutely a
869.60s: large trade no doubt and this looks
874.96s: curious to me because it's way far out
878.52s: so this is a long-term play that's what
881.08s: this tells me you don't go out that far
883.04s: at that size because it's not very
885.40s: liquid notice how wide that market is
887.64s: that's crazy 66 cents to 80 cents on
890.64s: something revolving around a three and a
892.64s: half strike that's wildly so they want
895.88s: leveraged exposure to the upside that's
897.56s: what this is no doubt but it's all the
900.04s: way out in 2025 so they're giving it
902.28s: plenty of time to in terms of the next
905.68s: largest there's essentially $75,000
908.04s: position much tighter still very liquid
911.12s: for the size of this product but this is
913.96s: a little near term but still pretty far
916.28s: out so the vast majority of these larger
919.48s: trades are kind of spread across these
922.44s: different expiration Cycles with some
924.36s: decent weight out here in 2025 but that
928.16s: doesn't bode well for what a lot of
930.04s: people are very interested in is what
931.52s: does this mean for me today this week
933.20s: coming up now and as I look across all
936.24s: of this again not saying nothing's going
938.76s: to happen I have no idea but what I do
941.20s: know is the options chain right now
943.72s: isn't showing me anything that looks
945.60s: supremely interesting anything
947.72s: indicative of strongly convicted upside
951.04s: bias trading the majority of volume that
953.28s: we saw on Friday today's the 7th of July
956.76s: the majority of volume from Friday
959.00s: Friday was actually trading it to the
960.72s: downside looking to either buy puts or
963.28s: sell calls into it so very interesting
967.32s: do I think that this is roaring kitty I
969.28s: have no idea from an options perspective
971.20s: I would lean no but from an equity
973.64s: perspective potentially but I have no
975.84s: idea he seems really convicted around
978.64s: trading GameStop and I had a long
982.32s: conversation with Richard about that not
984.68s: too long ago to understand his behaviors
987.40s: in terms of moving into other products
989.12s: and it's not outside the realm of
990.28s: possibility but right now we have no way
993.04s: to know we haven't seen any portfolio
994.88s: updates we haven't seen any more filings
997.08s: outside of chewy so he's obviously
999.72s: looking at other things but we don't
1002.00s: know exactly what that buying pattern
1004.32s: entails other than the fact that I do
1006.76s: think it's somewhat
1008.04s: telling that when we look at this little
1011.00s: chain and we had the dog
1015.88s: Emoji then we see the fining for chewy
1018.92s: and then we do see this I don't think
1020.76s: it's that far-fetched to assume there
1022.76s: could be activity going on by him in
1024.72s: there I just have no idea so I'm as
1027.80s: eager to find out as you guys are but my
1031.00s: small contribution to the puzzle set
1033.28s: would be from an options perspective I
1035.24s: don't see anything interesting to
1036.64s: indicate to me that there's roaring
1039.36s: Kitty or really any other large player
1041.72s: in their transacting it would be more on
1044.16s: the equity side that I could tell and
1046.52s: even that is relatively light for
1048.48s: something that's so cheap but who knows
1051.36s: so as always if you any questions or
1052.88s: anything to add drop it in the comments
1055.08s: be an outlier I'll see you guys later
