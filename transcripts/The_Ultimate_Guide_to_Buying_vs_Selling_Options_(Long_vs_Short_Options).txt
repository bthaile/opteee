0.44s: chances are you're leaving money on the
1.92s: table as an options Trader especially if
5.28s: you don't carefully differentiate
7.44s: between buying premium and selling
10.24s: premium at the end of this video you're
12.16s: going to have a really solid
14.24s: understanding of the tradeoffs between
16.00s: both of them and to see what is a better
18.88s: fit for what you're doing what's up
21.00s: everyone Eric here welcome back to the
22.36s: outliers let's get right to it so buying
25.28s: versus selling options you'll hear all
26.80s: sorts of stuff if you are familiar with
28.92s: Theta gang you'll hear Theta gangers
31.08s: convinced that Theta in and of itself is
34.00s: an edge which fun fact it unequivocally
36.80s: is not and then you'll have the people
39.36s: from Wall Street bets that are yoloing
41.36s: on cheap options that swear their Lotto
44.64s: that ended up luckily hitting for them
47.08s: is the way and it's way better than
48.84s: selling premium so how do we get to the
51.32s: bottom of this well we need to
52.88s: understand in detail the difference
54.96s: between buying and selling premium as
56.96s: you can see on the Y AIS here I broke it
60.84s: out across a bunch of different metrics
64.88s: so that at the end of the video once I
67.40s: go through an example with you you'll be
69.60s: able to follow along pretty close in
71.64s: detail and see exactly how to come to
74.48s: the correct decision for what you're
76.76s: doing whether you want to buy or sell
79.04s: premium so first let's start with some
81.80s: general practice admin stuff and it's
85.36s: kind of real simple up front to buy
87.84s: Premium versus selling premium the entry
89.96s: and exit trades just for those that
91.84s: don't know if you're buying premium
93.64s: you're buying to open and then if you
96.32s: are selling premium you're selling to
98.48s: open and then to close it's the inverse
101.08s: now let's get into the important stuff
103.48s: the risk profile now when you buy
107.20s: premium you are defining your risk your
109.84s: risk is going to be defined as whatever
112.52s: you bought your option for let's look at
116.44s: an example if we pop over to the chart
118.72s: and we take a look at pal here let's say
121.24s: that you're an enterprising Trader and
123.64s: let's say that you saw paler had a
125.92s: really good earnings and a gap up and
128.40s: you're like ah post earnings
130.20s: announcement drift looks like it might
132.00s: be in order here let me speculate with
133.88s: some long calls well let's say you go in
137.24s: and you buy a handful of the long calls
139.96s: and you pick the 50s that are out in 17
142.12s: genan 25 pure hypothetical and you got
144.40s: those for $543 at the time and if you're
148.08s: curious what the time was that would
150.04s: have been on the 5th of November and
153.56s: notice though the downside risk is
156.88s: capped this line here levels off and it
160.92s: can go no lower it shows you that your
164.72s: risk is defined that is very different
167.24s: than for example if we sold a put if we
170.36s: switch that and now you take a look
172.44s: you'll actually see that your profit now
175.76s: is capped and your loss is now uncapped
181.08s: so that's a really big difference
182.92s: between buying and selling premium this
184.80s: is probably one of the biggest
186.60s: differentiators this is probably one of
189.16s: the things you should really pay
190.68s: attention to because as we come back
192.96s: later to figure out tips on how to
194.76s: decide between buying and selling
196.12s: premium that's going to be one of the
197.88s: major decisions it's going to be based
199.56s: on the risk and reward profile now let's
202.72s: talk about the break even point and what
204.20s: that means so if you buy premium it
207.08s: requires an accommodating move in order
209.44s: to make money if you sell premium you
212.00s: have a built-in buffer so what does that
213.96s: mean plainly when you buy premium you
216.76s: have a slightly lower probability of
218.56s: profit depending on where you choose to
220.04s: buy and if you sell premium depending on
222.72s: where you choose to sell you will have a
224.52s: higher probability of profit so what
226.84s: does that actually look like well let's
228.48s: go back to this example and if we look
231.52s: at selling a put today as it sits in
234.88s: Palante here you can see that right now
237.96s: this is current price our Max profit is
241.68s: anywhere above 55 and our break even is
245.48s: down here at
246.88s: 5247 meanwhile paler is trading at
250.96s: 5985 so that means that it literally can
253.44s: move all the way from 5985 down to
257.88s: 5247 and you can still be profitable now
261.32s: this always sounds better than it
264.36s: actually behaves and it's an important
266.00s: note a lot of people get twisted up on
267.84s: this because take a look at this purple
270.88s: line this purple line represents today
274.08s: and then this blue line represents at
276.04s: expiration so yes at expiration as long
279.64s: as it's above 52 52 and change you would
283.20s: essentially walk out at a break even up
285.52s: until that point though you're losing
286.96s: money and in this case you would be
288.36s: losing
290.04s: $34 that can be really painful if you
292.88s: have a bigger trade so you might be
294.40s: thinking oh okay great I have such a big
296.44s: buffer it starts to feel a lot different
299.32s: when that buffer getting eaten up it
301.72s: moves down to your break even you're
303.44s: holding a big loss and now you're
305.08s: looking at a choice you're like well
306.32s: crap if I hold this it would be a profit
309.56s: if it doesn't go down lower but if it
311.36s: goes down lower now we're getting into
313.00s: the nasty part of the undefined risk
315.40s: aspect of the trade which is again not
318.52s: inherently good or bad but it's
320.28s: something a lot of Traders mistakenly
322.68s: give themselves a false sense of
323.96s: confidence then they think they have
325.20s: this big buffer and sometimes they don't
327.24s: now the other admin note from a pedantic
330.04s: standpoint is for selling a put a stock
332.72s: can only go down to zero so if we squ
335.72s: this all the way in and then we slide
338.20s: all the way down to like you can see
339.72s: that there's actually a defined loss all
342.12s: the way down here and it's just because
344.68s: it can only go down so far until it gets
348.52s: to zero at which point you're done now
352.40s: that's not the same for short calls
354.20s: stuff that is uh to the upside there's
356.64s: no cap so the way to think about these
359.80s: to is it really depends on the movement
363.16s: Factor but it's really important to
364.68s: remember that the built-in buffer for
366.68s: selling premium comes at a cost the cost
369.60s: is undefined risk and sometimes that can
372.28s: sneak up on you a little faster than you
374.04s: think and it can cause a little bit more
376.56s: of a problem in terms of an expected
378.44s: return what does that mean well let's
380.44s: take a look in this same example if we
384.00s: sell this put we're collecting
386.48s: $260 let's just say that bance your
388.96s: tanks for what reason it goes down to 40
391.40s: well now we've just lost
395.00s: $1,270 in pursuit of making 260 right so
399.40s: it's a big loss for a very small gain
401.52s: and this is the pennies in front of a
403.56s: steamroller analogy you'll hear from
405.28s: Theta gang where we're playing a a
407.92s: delicate game and a lot of Traders rely
411.08s: a little too heavily on their expected
414.04s: probabilities and they're not managing
416.36s: the trade which still needs to happen so
420.32s: so far you can see that there's some
422.44s: very clear differences between these
424.12s: let's talk about the relationship with
425.96s: volatility so volatility when you buy
428.92s: premium it helps you if it goes up hurts
432.00s: you if it goes down remember as
434.36s: volatility increases in an underlying
436.96s: all options appreciate inv value and
440.56s: inverse if it goes down and then
442.68s: obviously the inverse will help if you
444.52s: sold premium because when you're selling
446.00s: premium the game is you want to sell
448.12s: premium whatever you're selling it at
450.24s: higher and you want to buy it back lower
452.00s: whether you sell a put sell a call it
453.40s: doesn't matter in terms of the premium
455.28s: outlay so if we have volatility that
457.96s: contracts that decreases the premium
461.04s: that benefits our trade now from a
464.00s: capital requirement perspective it's a
466.68s: little bit different here because for
468.80s: buying premium the capital requirement
470.76s: is going to be whatever you purchase the
472.24s: option for meanwhile for selling premium
475.60s: there's going to be a margin requirement
477.32s: and the margin requirement is going to
478.64s: depend on if you have margin account
480.56s: what margin positions you uh permissions
482.52s: you have in this case I'm using a pass
484.48s: through Ira so what that means is
486.68s: there's nothing in the account but more
488.56s: importantly than that you'll notice that
489.80s: the margin requirement for this 55 put
492.00s: is
492.64s: $5,500 because in the IRA account you
495.12s: can't have naked puts it has to be cash
496.76s: secured if you have a margin account
498.60s: then maybe you have regulation t or if
500.32s: you have a slightly bigger account you
501.80s: can have portfolio margin the one thing
504.08s: to note about this specifically the
507.40s: margin requirement for selling premium
509.12s: is that it changes as the broker
511.72s: perceives more risk they are going to
514.32s: expand the margin requirement they're
516.56s: not going to take the risk for you so
518.28s: they're going to give you the leverage
519.60s: meaning you can control X size position
522.68s: putting up a smaller amount of money
524.32s: whatever that margin is but they're
526.60s: going to adjust it based on their risk
528.76s: and they're going to pass that on to you
530.92s: that doesn't happen when you buy options
532.92s: buying options is whatever it is right
535.04s: from the jump and a quick note just on
538.32s: the Greeks for those that are curious
540.76s: when you buy premium you're short Theta
543.52s: this simply means as time passes your
546.16s: options lose value in the form of feta
548.76s: Decay when you buy premium you're long
552.68s: gamma that means that moves in your
556.08s: favor if you buy a call and you get a
558.04s: move up it helps your position compound
561.16s: quickly I have a trade that I recently
563.60s: did in djt I'll throw a link below that
566.44s: is actually built around what we call
567.88s: building units it's a gamma play Then
571.44s: long row is already what we talked about
573.48s: in terms of volatility I just wanted to
575.60s: add it there for a general note in case
577.36s: you were wondering now for selling
579.72s: premium you are long Theta that means
582.24s: you're collecting the Theta Decay from
584.68s: somebody else however you're
588.56s: also not long short that sounds like a
592.28s: bit of a tough position to put on I
594.04s: guess you could put it on um but you're
596.52s: short gamma that means big moves tend to
599.84s: hurt you again it does depend on if
602.04s: you're short of single option or short
604.64s: um like a straddle or strangle in those
606.92s: instances but the way to think about the
609.28s: gamma relationship is if you're long
610.88s: gamma you want a big move in your favor
612.56s: if you're short gamma you want Little
614.24s: movement now you also understand already
617.64s: the relationship with volatility so now
619.40s: let's get into some of the tips here for
622.88s: you to on board and at the end of this
625.96s: you should actually have a really clear
628.16s: way and framework to think about do I
631.44s: want to buy premium here or do I want to
633.44s: sell premium so the first one is use
635.88s: both there's no inherent advantage to
640.60s: either one of these so buying has a use
644.84s: case selling has a use case I'm going to
647.36s: show you an example in a second of this
650.56s: I used to think selling was better than
652.60s: buying like a lot of enlightened Traders
655.60s: as they go through a few years of
656.88s: trading they really think that selling
658.56s: has an edge
659.88s: and it can but it's not because of
661.84s: selling in and of itself it's because of
664.12s: other factors that have to be carefully
665.76s: tracked I actually find really great
668.92s: success using both of these this is why
671.24s: my overall approach to trading which
672.96s: I'll throw a link to that below as well
675.92s: I actively use both and it's because
679.12s: they each have a use case for me so now
682.76s: what's the next primary tip here it's
685.24s: don't default one of the things that I
687.96s: find people will do is they will
690.36s: automatically think oh I'm going to sell
693.24s: premium here I'm going to buy premium
695.40s: and what I think about instead is
698.04s: fitting The Profit mechanism and your
700.76s: risk preference and this is part of
703.52s: something I call the outlier strategy
706.44s: process I have a video as well that I'll
708.28s: link to Below on this but the thing I
710.40s: really want to focus on here is this
712.24s: idea of outlining fitting structures
714.44s: this is step three so let's take a quick
716.92s: look at an example together if we pop
719.44s: over into here and we take a look at
722.36s: Palance here if for whatever reason we
725.20s: had that position we talked about that
726.84s: perspective trade that came in on the
728.40s: 5th and we think that paler is going to
731.04s: have a big move if we think that there's
734.16s: going to be a big move would we rather
738.64s: have defined or undefined profit
743.08s: potential in that case I would rather
745.36s: have undefined profit potential because
748.12s: if it's going to be a big move I don't
750.04s: want to be limited by just getting the
751.96s: credit that I received or as I'm
755.04s: building a broader portfolio and I'm
757.80s: being aware of the impacts of Greeks on
761.32s: the portfolio and I realize well I have
762.80s: a bunch of long options I'm losing money
765.28s: every day in Theta maybe I want to try
767.68s: to sell some options in order to offset
770.56s: some of that Theta Decay so the idea is
774.60s: don't default to buying or selling use
777.40s: both of them in the context that it Mak
779.40s: sense so let's take a look at another
781.32s: example quickly if we take a look at
783.64s: something like Qualcomm which
785.36s: essentially has been trending sideways
786.92s: for the past three months straight even
788.88s: through earnings doesn't really look
791.00s: like it's making big moves to the upside
792.60s: or to the downside well I don't want to
794.64s: buy options because it's not moving
796.84s: enough so maybe this becomes an an
799.24s: instance where selling options can be a
801.88s: great add to the overall portfolio adds
804.52s: a diversification in terms of different
806.32s: profit mechanisms and it offsets some of
809.72s: the Theta it gives me positive Theta so
813.16s: if we take a look at some of the common
815.72s: misconceptions we already talked about
817.64s: one not being better than the other but
819.00s: the other thing we have to highlight
820.16s: here is overweighting volatility there
822.60s: are a lot of traders that will
824.76s: automatically default to selling premium
827.56s: if implied volatility or implied
829.88s: volatility percentile is high and they
832.76s: will default to the inverse if it's low
835.44s: via buying and that's a mistake the
837.96s: reason why it's a mistake is Because
839.48s: unless you are actively Delta in gamma
842.32s: hedging to truly isolate volatility
845.92s: Delta is still the more important input
849.32s: to your formula what does that mean well
852.28s: let's take a look if we take a look at
854.88s: qualcom we might say implied volatility
856.76s: percentile is 54 let's just say that
859.24s: this was really low let's say implied
860.88s: volatility percentile was 10 if you're
863.28s: an option seller you would look at that
864.60s: and say oh well that's super low I don't
866.60s: want to sell volatility there it's too
868.72s: cheap and if volatility expands it'll
870.80s: hurt my position it will however it's
873.96s: temporary because as long as Qualcomm
876.72s: remains range bound if we sell a
878.40s: strangle for example even if your
880.56s: position temporarily hurts because
882.84s: volatility has gone up data is still
885.12s: going to Decay and as long as it remains
886.88s: range bound you're going to have a full
888.72s: profit at the end of it so volatility is
891.80s: a massively important consideration when
895.92s: you are looking to buy or sell options
898.76s: it's a a massive input is a decision
900.88s: Factor however it should not be the
904.88s: decision Factor it shouldn't be default
907.96s: to selling or buying based on volatility
910.24s: alone unless again you're deploying a
913.36s: specific volatility trade that's
915.80s: different of course volatility then
917.88s: becomes the primary input that is your
919.72s: actual profit mechanism so that is
923.56s: exactly how I think about buying versus
925.44s: selling premium the main decision it's
927.32s: going to come down to is what kind of
929.36s: risk profile do I want I'm going to
931.00s: manage it whether it's bought or sold so
932.72s: it doesn't matter quite that much and
935.00s: then the second is how do I feel about
937.16s: the profit potential given the
938.84s: corresponding tradeoffs if I have
941.68s: something that's an undefined profit I
943.40s: know I'm going to have a lower
944.60s: probability of profit I'm going to have
946.20s: to be better at picking Direction and
948.08s: it's going to have to move in my favor
949.48s: within the expected time frame and I
951.92s: have a video Down Below on buying
954.80s: options smarter that shows how to
957.48s: balance some of these things
959.64s: or inversely if I'm fine defining the
963.16s: profit I'm not necessarily expecting a
964.92s: big move and I just want to benefit from
966.48s: the passage of time then selling premium
969.52s: can make a lot of sense so as always if
971.60s: you have any questions anything you want
973.12s: me to go over let me know be an outlier
974.80s: I'll see you later
