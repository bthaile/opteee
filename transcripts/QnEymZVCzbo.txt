0.00s: What's up to all the outliers Eric here?
2.64s: I'm going to show you two market beating portfolios in less than seven minutes.
7.08s: I had to pick seven because the last one ran a little long.
9.92s: But I want to show you some good detail and most importantly,
12.92s: how you can play with some different variables to find the portfolio that fits your risk
19.32s: or reward profile.
20.48s: So whether you are a buy and hold investor,
23.36s: just looking to set something up that you don't have to worry about and you can stop paying
27.12s: the mutual fund managers more than they deserve.
30.52s: Or if you're a trader like me, especially for newer traders,
34.76s: you don't know if trading is going to be a right fit for you.
37.16s: You don't want to burn all your money trying to figure out if it's a right fit.
40.60s: So setting up a buy and hold while your paper trading learning to trade is a great approach
46.00s: and super efficient.
47.16s: So with that, let's dive straight in.
50.32s: First off, why buy and hold?
51.72s: As I mentioned, we know it works.
54.12s: We know it works.
55.96s: Most traders fail statistically speaking.
59.16s: So with that, buy and hold should have a place in most people's portfolios.
64.44s: And then the other cool thing as I was alluding to just before is it can be modular in nature,
70.52s: meaning you can structure these to have different risk reward profiles based on what you want exposure to.
77.76s: Okay, so let's get on to actually setting this thing up.
81.12s: I'm assuming you have a broker picked out and you have an account opened up.
84.72s: Once that's happened, you need to figure out the amount of money you're going to put into your account, drop that in.
89.84s: And then we're going to pick some tickers.
91.28s: What we're going to do is split that principal amount between two buckets, equity and debt.
97.12s: I offer you a list of some different products here.
100.08s: However, I'm going to be focusing on a few of these in the following pieces.
105.12s: Now, you can be as creative as you want and see what works for you,
109.84s: even down to sector ETFs are adding individual stocks,
113.76s: which might be a great idea for people with a little higher risk tolerance.
118.48s: So with that, let's get a look at the first portfolio here.
124.56s: This is an 80 20 split between an equity ETF and bonds.
130.72s: The equity ETFs that we're going to be looking at is spy IWM and QQQ.
136.08s: That's the S&P 500, the Russell 2000, and then the NASDAQ.
140.16s: And then down at the bottom, we have a control, which is the spy itself, the S&P 500 index ETF.
146.56s: Now, this study goes from 2003 until the end of April.
151.60s: And there's some important data points I want to show you here.
155.20s: The starting balance for all of them is $10,000.
158.16s: I picked something that's easy to scale, just do a little bit of math and you can see what this would be worth.
162.96s: The final balance is what was the portfolio worth at the end of the study.
166.96s: Ideally, we want this number to be higher means we're going to walk away with more money.
171.12s: The Kagger Compound Annual Growth Rate is a super useful tool that tells you essentially how much
176.88s: you would be earning each year to end up with the principle from the initial balance.
182.08s: Then we have standard deviation.
184.64s: This we tend to look for lower numbers, meaning there's a lower variance in our returns,
190.08s: more consistency and less volatility.
193.04s: The best year, we want that number to be higher.
195.44s: This is the highest returning year against the worst year.
198.48s: The lowest returning year for that portfolio.
201.28s: The max drawdown is the worst drawdown that the portfolio faced, meaning the most money at
208.48s: loss on a percentage basis throughout the life cycle of the entire study.
212.56s: And then we're going to be focusing more on the Sortino ratio, which is a risk-reward assessment
219.76s: where we're focusing on how much good money are we making on bad risk,
225.20s: or another way to think about it, especially for the Sortino ratio, is the higher the Sortino
230.32s: ratio is, the more money we're making on the risk that we have out focusing on downside risk,
236.48s: not just upside risk.
237.92s: So the Sortino ratio does not punish volatility necessarily, whereas sharp ratio tends to.
245.44s: Okay, so with this, you can see hands down, the cues wins.
248.96s: It walks out almost double the nearest competitor, and it's the only one that actually beat the S&P 500.
255.04s: But not all that glitters is gold.
257.92s: It has a couple detractors compared to the other portfolios, meaning that the worst year is worse
265.52s: than something like IWMTLT split, things like that.
270.00s: So we'll see a couple different comparisons in a minute,
274.16s: so that you can get an idea of some, how some of these different portfolios flush out against
278.88s: one another. So on the top here, I have a 100% of the index ETF compared to one another.
286.80s: The only nuance to call out here is this is looking from 2001 to present.
292.48s: So that's why you're going to see a slightly different figure than these bottom two.
295.52s: But I just wanted to give you a general idea in terms of best year, worst year, those kinds of
299.12s: things. Let's turn our attention down here, though, to the 8020 and 6040 split.
304.56s: So the 8020 is what you just saw. And then the 6040 takes instead of, you know, 80% spy and 20% TLT down here,
314.40s: it's 60% spy, 40% TLT, 60% IWM, so on and so forth.
320.00s: So you'll notice a few things. The final balances on all of these has come down.
324.96s: However, even this final balance 6040 of Q's to TLT outperforms everything up here.
332.96s: That's an important note. The other thing to keep in mind is our compound annual growth rate
338.96s: is really healthy for this 6040 split. Now, a couple other things to note, we see some
345.60s: difference in our standard deviations in max drawdowns. So again, for example, this 6040 TLT split
353.20s: comes in at a 12% cager compared to the 13.8% for the 8020, but the max drawdown is actually
361.36s: quite a bit better. The max drawdown for the 6040 split is down 22% as compared to down 36%.
369.12s: And then the same thing for the worst year, we have a 6% better worst year for the 6040 split.
375.12s: However, you'll also notice we have a 6% worse best year for the 6040 split.
381.52s: So what you'll notice is as you add more money to TLT, we're going to expect a few things.
388.32s: We're going to expect our cager to go down. We're going to expect your standard deviation to
392.48s: decrease. We're going to expect our best year to decrease. We're going to expect our best year
399.12s: to get better. And we're going to expect our max drawdown to also get better. So I want to leave
406.08s: you with two ideas. The top portfolio here, I call it the 25s, which is 25% spy IWM in QQQ.
415.84s: And then 25% TLT. And then the bottom is that same portfolio. I've showed you a couple times
421.28s: the 80% Qs against 20% TLT. This is kind of set up in a heat map way so that you can get a sense
429.52s: for what risk or word profile works best for you. The reason why I offer you this is tech might
435.76s: not be hot forever. And that is a primary reason why you're seeing the Qs just being far and
442.72s: beyond everything else. Tech has been so hot. So if you are still on that same thought process,
450.00s: cool. There's a great portfolio for you. If not, I offer you this other portfolio that also
455.28s: beats the market with lower standard deviation, a better worst year and a better max drawdown.
461.12s: Doesn't quite outperform the 80 20 Qs portfolio. But again, maybe in a different market it would.
466.88s: So let me know what you think. And if you enjoy this kind of content, make sure you subscribe
471.84s: and like the video so that we can emerge in the YouTube algorithm and get some more people into
476.16s: the outlier community. And I look forward to catching you all later. Be an outlier.
