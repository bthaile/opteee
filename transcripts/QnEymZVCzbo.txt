 What's up to all the outliers Eric here? I'm going to show you two market beating portfolios in less than seven minutes. I had to pick seven because the last one ran a little long. But I want to show you some good detail and most importantly, how you can play with some different variables to find the portfolio that fits your risk or reward profile. So whether you are a buy and hold investor, just looking to set something up that you don't have to worry about and you can stop paying the mutual fund managers more than they deserve. Or if you're a trader like me, especially for newer traders, you don't know if trading is going to be a right fit for you. You don't want to burn all your money trying to figure out if it's a right fit. So setting up a buy and hold while your paper trading learning to trade is a great approach and super efficient. So with that, let's dive straight in. First off, why buy and hold? As I mentioned, we know it works. We know it works. Most traders fail statistically speaking. So with that, buy and hold should have a place in most people's portfolios. And then the other cool thing as I was alluding to just before is it can be modular in nature, meaning you can structure these to have different risk reward profiles based on what you want exposure to. Okay, so let's get on to actually setting this thing up. I'm assuming you have a broker picked out and you have an account opened up. Once that's happened, you need to figure out the amount of money you're going to put into your account, drop that in. And then we're going to pick some tickers. What we're going to do is split that principal amount between two buckets, equity and debt. I offer you a list of some different products here. However, I'm going to be focusing on a few of these in the following pieces. Now, you can be as creative as you want and see what works for you, even down to sector ETFs are adding individual stocks, which might be a great idea for people with a little higher risk tolerance. So with that, let's get a look at the first portfolio here. This is an 80 20 split between an equity ETF and bonds. The equity ETFs that we're going to be looking at is spy IWM and QQQ. That's the S&P 500, the Russell 2000, and then the NASDAQ. And then down at the bottom, we have a control, which is the spy itself, the S&P 500 index ETF. Now, this study goes from 2003 until the end of April. And there's some important data points I want to show you here. The starting balance for all of them is $10,000. I picked something that's easy to scale, just do a little bit of math and you can see what this would be worth. The final balance is what was the portfolio worth at the end of the study. Ideally, we want this number to be higher means we're going to walk away with more money. The Kagger Compound Annual Growth Rate is a super useful tool that tells you essentially how much you would be earning each year to end up with the principle from the initial balance. Then we have standard deviation. This we tend to look for lower numbers, meaning there's a lower variance in our returns, more consistency and less volatility. The best year, we want that number to be higher. This is the highest returning year against the worst year. The lowest returning year for that portfolio. The max drawdown is the worst drawdown that the portfolio faced, meaning the most money at loss on a percentage basis throughout the life cycle of the entire study. And then we're going to be focusing more on the Sortino ratio, which is a risk-reward assessment where we're focusing on how much good money are we making on bad risk, or another way to think about it, especially for the Sortino ratio, is the higher the Sortino ratio is, the more money we're making on the risk that we have out focusing on downside risk, not just upside risk. So the Sortino ratio does not punish volatility necessarily, whereas sharp ratio tends to. Okay, so with this, you can see hands down, the cues wins. It walks out almost double the nearest competitor, and it's the only one that actually beat the S&P 500. But not all that glitters is gold. It has a couple detractors compared to the other portfolios, meaning that the worst year is worse than something like IWMTLT split, things like that. So we'll see a couple different comparisons in a minute, so that you can get an idea of some, how some of these different portfolios flush out against one another. So on the top here, I have a 100% of the index ETF compared to one another. The only nuance to call out here is this is looking from 2001 to present. So that's why you're going to see a slightly different figure than these bottom two. But I just wanted to give you a general idea in terms of best year, worst year, those kinds of things. Let's turn our attention down here, though, to the 8020 and 6040 split. So the 8020 is what you just saw. And then the 6040 takes instead of, you know, 80% spy and 20% TLT down here, it's 60% spy, 40% TLT, 60% IWM, so on and so forth. So you'll notice a few things. The final balances on all of these has come down. However, even this final balance 6040 of Q's to TLT outperforms everything up here. That's an important note. The other thing to keep in mind is our compound annual growth rate is really healthy for this 6040 split. Now, a couple other things to note, we see some difference in our standard deviations in max drawdowns. So again, for example, this 6040 TLT split comes in at a 12% cager compared to the 13.8% for the 8020, but the max drawdown is actually quite a bit better. The max drawdown for the 6040 split is down 22% as compared to down 36%. And then the same thing for the worst year, we have a 6% better worst year for the 6040 split. However, you'll also notice we have a 6% worse best year for the 6040 split. So what you'll notice is as you add more money to TLT, we're going to expect a few things. We're going to expect our cager to go down. We're going to expect your standard deviation to decrease. We're going to expect our best year to decrease. We're going to expect our best year to get better. And we're going to expect our max drawdown to also get better. So I want to leave you with two ideas. The top portfolio here, I call it the 25s, which is 25% spy IWM in QQQ. And then 25% TLT. And then the bottom is that same portfolio. I've showed you a couple times the 80% Qs against 20% TLT. This is kind of set up in a heat map way so that you can get a sense for what risk or word profile works best for you. The reason why I offer you this is tech might not be hot forever. And that is a primary reason why you're seeing the Qs just being far and beyond everything else. Tech has been so hot. So if you are still on that same thought process, cool. There's a great portfolio for you. If not, I offer you this other portfolio that also beats the market with lower standard deviation, a better worst year and a better max drawdown. Doesn't quite outperform the 80 20 Qs portfolio. But again, maybe in a different market it would. So let me know what you think.
