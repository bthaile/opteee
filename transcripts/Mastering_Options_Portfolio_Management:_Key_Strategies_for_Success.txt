0.48s: managing an options portfolio is
3.32s: completely different than pretty much
4.80s: any other portfolio you can think of
6.84s: because options behave very differently
10.88s: so what I want to walk you through on
12.80s: the leftand side here is some Core
14.56s: Concepts then I want to walk you through
17.44s: the three levels that I manage my
20.88s: portfolio through and then at the end of
23.20s: the video I'm going to walk you through
25.28s: exactly how I split out my portfolio and
28.40s: think about deploying it what's up
30.40s: everyone Eric here welcome back to the
32.12s: outliers shout out to the patreon family
34.24s: consider signing up for weekly workshops
36.56s: all sorts of fun extra content but let's
40.12s: get right in so what are the Core
42.12s: Concepts here for managing a portfolio
44.60s: well it all starts with this begin with
48.92s: the end in mind what does that mean well
51.72s: you kind of have to Define what you're
53.72s: trying to do in order to stand a good
57.00s: chance at completing it so if you think
59.72s: about what most of our goals are in
61.76s: trading it's things like achieve a
64.00s: certain percent return per year it's be
67.16s: able to make a certain amount of monthly
68.92s: income it's reduce portfolio draw down
73.08s: those are great goals but you have to
74.80s: figure out what works for you and what
77.04s: makes the most sense and you might be
78.76s: wondering how to do that and it's really
80.48s: really simple you can navigate to my
82.92s: website come over here to the resources
85.04s: go to the compound interest calculator
87.84s: and you can figure out what you need
90.60s: this is it this is beginning with the
92.12s: end in mind so if you're starting with a
93.60s: $155,000 trading account you want to
96.24s: have a million in 25 years let's say
101.20s: well at this current run rate 10% per
103.56s: year your $115,000 is going to give you
105.92s: 162 520 we have a long way to go so now
109.24s: maybe we need to focus on saving some
111.16s: money maybe we can get to $1,000 per
114.08s: month on average over the long run and
116.44s: then boom all of a sudden we're there
118.28s: maybe you don't want to do ,000 per
120.40s: month because that's a little expensive
122.04s: you want to do something like
124.96s: $750 a month and then you think okay
128.80s: that gets you there too maybe you could
130.32s: do a little bit better maybe instead of
132.40s: 10% you think you could do maybe
134.80s: 15% and see where that lands you so the
138.32s: point is is this shouldn't be completely
140.40s: random you should figure out what your
142.88s: road map looks like and then you have to
145.80s: ask yourself these two
148.84s: questions are your goals
151.04s: realistic what makes you think they're
153.20s: realistic so are they realistic means if
155.76s: a Trader says to me I want to make 25%
157.88s: pree totally cool is it doable of course
161.16s: is it doable for that Trader I have no
163.36s: idea does that Trader know probably if
165.80s: they're asking the question I imagine
167.32s: they don't know either which probably
168.84s: tells me that they're shooting way too
171.20s: aggressively in my opinion in the
174.28s: beginning the best Target is avoiding
176.80s: draw downs and that's simply because
179.04s: they set you too far back and it you
181.44s: don't gain that much from trying to have
184.00s: these crazy good returns early on if
187.12s: you're drawing your account down in
189.04s: pursuit of them so once you have a bit
192.60s: of a track record 3 months paper trading
195.44s: 6 months paper trading and you have some
197.36s: ideas of what you're able to do then you
200.48s: can decide whether or not your 25% is
202.88s: realistic but you can have whatever goal
205.16s: you want that doesn't mean that it's
206.84s: going to happen it's up to you to make
209.28s: it happen and manifesting only gets you
211.80s: so far so now as we move in closer we
215.68s: have our objective we need to approach
218.68s: this entire thing understanding that
221.12s: options move you might be thinking no
223.88s: kidding as you should but the problem is
226.28s: so many people they think about the
228.20s: trade as they're putting it on and
229.56s: they're not thinking through the life
231.48s: cycle of the trade so that's going to be
233.16s: a core concept that you got to keep in
234.56s: mind as we go through this the next
236.40s: couple for me I like to think about
238.44s: breaking my portfolio into different
240.16s: allocations a core and speculative we'll
242.68s: get into more detail on that later you
244.64s: just have to come up with a general
247.00s: guiding feature for how you're going to
249.04s: use your money the next thing here is
252.08s: making sure that as we're looking at our
253.80s: entire portfolio we want to De conflict
257.32s: positions we want to use stuff that
259.60s: behaves differently that we have
261.04s: different profit mechanisms that we're
262.60s: tapping into that we have different
264.24s: durations that we're looking at
266.16s: different correlations that's my
268.64s: Approach other people people can have a
270.60s: fast ball meaning they have one specific
272.52s: style trade and they like one specific
274.76s: duration that's okay too but the idea
277.24s: here is to make sure that whatever
278.88s: you're doing fits into the broader
280.72s: portfolio
282.08s: effectively expected returns is going to
284.48s: come up a million times during this when
286.56s: you're looking at managing a portfolio
288.40s: you're looking at the culmination of a
290.80s: bunch of different positions that
292.20s: interact with one another over time
294.44s: sustained so we need to really focus on
297.16s: how these different positions behave in
299.76s: relation to one another so the kind of
301.96s: big takeaway from this concept section
305.28s: is that there's no right answer it's
307.12s: dependent completely on you if your goal
309.32s: is to aggressively grow your portfolio
312.20s: you might have a different approach if
314.28s: your goal is to defensively manage your
316.80s: portfolio meaning avoid draw Downs
318.28s: you're going to have a different
318.92s: approach you have to figure out what
321.08s: you're trying to do and then start
323.28s: solving the problem from there which
324.80s: we're going to get into on this side the
327.16s: other thing is just avoid this idea of
329.00s: blanket rulle rules they're stupid so
331.76s: things like oh nobody ever went broke
334.08s: taking profits the problem is eventually
336.24s: you can as soon as risk is eventually
338.16s: realized it can be enough to wipe out
339.80s: all your profits and you can lose money
342.52s: all I'm highlighting here is make it
344.32s: make sense go back to this expected
346.28s: return if you're putting on risk in
347.96s: managing a portfolio with expected
349.96s: return that it makes sense but trying to
352.84s: stick to General blanket rules like that
354.84s: I think are too boxy and they miss too
358.04s: many potential details for a Trader so
361.04s: as we move through the rest of this
362.56s: these are the three questions you should
364.28s: be able to answer at any given point in
366.32s: time about your portfolio do you
368.72s: understand your portfolio's entire risk
371.32s: at a given point in time and we'll take
373.20s: a look at how to do that well does your
375.60s: portfolio reflect your disposition take
378.40s: a look at what that means do you need
381.48s: manage anything we'll take a look at
383.04s: that let's start with the top level this
385.00s: idea of disposition what is this this is
387.88s: where I look at these different Market
390.36s: inputs like what's the economy doing do
392.88s: we have an expanding or Contracting GDP
395.88s: we in a high inflation period or a
398.32s: deflationary period are jobs growing
401.92s: effectively or not all those details
404.76s: matter and as you'll notice it moves
407.52s: from zoomed really far out economy then
410.08s: we're going to look at the stock market
411.40s: as a whole the individual indices and
413.44s: their relationships to one another the
415.64s: sectors what sectors are outperforming
417.88s: underperforming the sub sectors what are
420.92s: the primary themes of the current
424.20s: environment that you're investing in and
426.44s: are there any events coming up this is
428.60s: the first layer of developing a
430.92s: disposition and now it might sound like
432.28s: a lot but once you get good at looking
434.80s: at things this takes just a few moments
437.04s: so you can say well right now some of
438.76s: the primary themes is AI has been coming
441.08s: out really hot and that there's a lot of
443.08s: speculation around that Tech has been on
445.84s: an absolute tear and it's going to need
447.64s: to deliver extremely well in order to
451.00s: not have a pretty significant drawback
453.64s: so those kinds of things can paint the
456.32s: way we think about the entire market and
458.92s: then how we choose to structure our
462.44s: portfolio so our portfolio should align
466.72s: with the way that we think about our
468.56s: disposition so for example if I go
470.12s: through the disposition phase and I look
472.20s: at a Contracting economy the market
474.76s: looks really weak we're seeing a lot of
476.72s: negative breadth we're seeing the
478.96s: indices trending down I'm going to have
481.24s: a generally bearish disposition do I
483.84s: want to have a really long bias
486.76s: portfolio if I have a bearish
488.60s: disposition probably not so the idea
491.36s: here is to make sure that what you're
492.96s: doing in your portfolio aligns with what
495.12s: you think the market and the economy
497.80s: looks like it's doing now at the
499.40s: portfolio level there's a bunch of
501.04s: things we need to look at we need to
502.68s: look at how we're allocating our money
505.88s: so what trades get what amount of money
507.96s: and on the next part of this you'll get
509.68s: a look at how I think about that
511.68s: utilization how much money you want to
513.60s: move at a given point in time so if
516.00s: you're in a disposition where you think
519.28s: we're in kind of a transitory phase and
521.76s: you want to see what the Market's going
522.92s: to do well maybe you lighten up your
525.24s: utilization at that point or if there's
527.56s: something that has you really convicted
529.28s: and you want to use way more money
530.84s: because you have strong conviction well
532.40s: maybe we jack up our utilization so that
534.84s: aligns with our disposition beta weed
537.48s: Deltas this is a really great way way to
540.08s: assess your portfolio risk it takes all
543.20s: of the different positions that you have
544.52s: and it puts it into a Common Language
546.36s: I'll drop a video in the description
548.12s: below that walks through beta weighted
550.00s: Deltas in detail this is a go-to for me
552.76s: so in a nutshell these first three are
555.72s: super important to me this is going to
557.44s: tell me how much money am I ready to use
559.24s: in my portfolio how much money am I
561.32s: currently using right now and what is
563.44s: the directional disposition of the
565.80s: portfolio so if I look at my Beta
568.44s: weighted deltas and and their 10 spy
571.84s: beta WEA Deltas all that means is that
573.60s: the entire portfolio is behaving like 10
575.80s: shares of spy is that a lot is that a
578.68s: little does that align with my
580.04s: disposition that's going to be a
581.44s: starting point for what I do here on out
584.36s: I'm going to review the number of
585.96s: positions I have what their sizing is
588.20s: because again remember options move so
590.80s: as they move around the notional size of
593.48s: your positions can change as your Deltas
595.40s: change so you have to make sure that the
597.32s: position is sized and operated as you
599.88s: want I like to look at broad level
602.72s: portfolio Greeks what's my portfolio
605.12s: Theta am I taking in net money or am I
607.84s: paying net money I prefer to be positive
610.40s: Theta in the portfolio what's my
612.56s: portfolio gamma how fast is my portfolio
615.92s: Delta going to change and you can devise
618.60s: all of that from your portfolio Greeks
620.56s: which are really useful tools the
622.32s: correlations is really important as
623.96s: you're putting on new positions and
625.40s: adjusting old positions because let's
627.36s: say that you have 10 positions on but
629.68s: nine of them behave like the same thing
632.04s: well you might have more risk than you
634.16s: think you do beta weighted Deltas will
636.28s: help you see that but so will monitoring
638.28s: the correlation between the different
639.56s: products that you have on because the
641.40s: relationships change great example of
644.04s: this is the way that bonds behaved
645.84s: against equities during 2020 to
649.32s: essentially
650.84s: 2024 that way now to a degree kind of
653.36s: normalizing more recently but that
656.04s: relationship changed so you might have
657.84s: been banking on it behaving a certain
659.36s: way but then it didn't I like to
661.88s: diversify my strategies so that I'm
664.56s: using different kinds of strategies
666.08s: because I know that they will behave
667.32s: differently that's more of a preference
668.84s: and then circuit breakers circuit
670.72s: breakers is saying at the portfolio
673.04s: level if I experience a
676.32s: x% portfolio level draw down I'm going
679.24s: to start closing positions it's a tough
681.72s: decision and you have to figure out what
683.08s: that might look like for you the reason
685.24s: why I like to use circuit breakers is
687.00s: because it keeps me from becoming
688.60s: paralyzed if things are not going well
691.24s: and I need to make some changes to what
692.72s: I'm doing so thinking of those ahead of
695.64s: time and understanding that there's a
697.36s: possibility that you run through your
698.60s: circuit breakers if it's 25% your
700.52s: portfolio draws down 25% you start
702.76s: cutting positions and then it rebounds
704.56s: back up that might feel absolutely
707.32s: terrible but if that's the way that
709.64s: you're perceiving the markets you're at
711.24s: a disadvantage from the jump because
713.92s: just as you might be going through a 25%
716.00s: draw down here well guess what you might
718.40s: have gotten out at 25% when it drops
721.00s: another 25% or you could get out at 25%
724.52s: and then it rallies back up and you're
725.72s: like damn I didn't need to take that
727.20s: loss you have to figure out what's right
728.84s: for you and your risk tolerance you
730.60s: might not even really need to have big
732.60s: portfolio circuit breakers but it's
734.20s: really to make sure that you're not
735.36s: missing anything that's going to hurt
736.92s: you last thing position so now we have
740.04s: our disposition towards the market the
741.64s: economy we now know how we want our
744.20s: portfolio to look and what we're looking
746.12s: at in the portfolio now we just need to
748.64s: make sure that each individual trade
750.92s: fits the puzzle of the portfolio so the
753.84s: first thing I'm going to look at with
755.08s: every single position is do I need to
756.56s: manage it from p&l or days expiration
759.08s: meaning am I at a profit management
761.28s: point a loss management point or have I
763.24s: been in the trade long enough that I
764.52s: need to manage it based on time what are
766.76s: the Greeks of the individual position do
769.08s: all of those look align with my
770.52s: expectations based on when I entered it
772.16s: and does it still make sense for the
773.60s: portfolio do I have any events coming up
775.96s: that I have to be aware of is earnings
777.40s: coming up soon based on all those things
780.36s: if I'm still in the clear there's
782.20s: nothing has to be done with the position
783.44s: I'm going to make sure that my thesis is
785.08s: still good and once I'm done with the
787.88s: position I'm going to update my trade
789.40s: log I'm going to make sure that there
791.12s: were no events that I missed that popped
793.92s: up in the middle of this thing that I
795.16s: wasn't aware of and always ensure that
798.88s: the trades that I'm putting on have a
800.32s: positive expected return so that's just
803.24s: a general flow for what this can look
806.40s: like so again we have our disposition to
809.08s: towards the market we figure out how we
810.80s: want our portfolio to look and then we
812.60s: make sure each individual position fits
814.56s: into this so if we're bullish we want to
817.68s: have long spy beta weighted Deltas we're
821.36s: going to look for positions that
822.88s: complement that now we start putting on
825.16s: a bunch of positions we long a bunch of
826.68s: calls and different things but I said I
828.76s: like being long Theta meaning I'm
830.76s: collecting Theta on a daily basis so
832.80s: that means I'm going to have to put on
833.84s: some positions that bring in Theta that
836.36s: maybe tamper down some of my risk
838.32s: because after I put all of those long
839.76s: calls I'm actually a little bit too long
841.76s: for what I
843.04s: want and I can use that as an
845.04s: opportunity to tie in two different
847.72s: things I need a position that gains me
849.36s: Theta and I also need something to
851.04s: Tamper down my risk a little bit so I'm
852.64s: not too long it's exactly how all of
854.92s: these fit in with one another so now
857.12s: quickly I want to walk you through just
859.80s: how I split my portfolio between these
861.68s: two buckets core and speculative
863.92s: allocation across a few metrics so
867.04s: what's the total allocation I'll give to
869.56s: my score my score my core in speculative
873.28s: trades I guess it's the combination of
875.12s: both of those for the core allocation it
877.20s: gets up to 100% I'm happy to use the
879.28s: entire portfolio on a core allocation
881.20s: for speculative I'm okay using up to 60%
884.32s: of my Capital this gives me a lot of
887.76s: room now I very rarely would get
890.12s: anything close to that and more
891.44s: importantly this is going to be
892.84s: completely dependent on how speculative
895.00s: you like to be as a Trader and how you
896.80s: like to set up your risk for position
900.72s: sizing I will use up to 100% on the core
904.52s: allocation for an individual speculative
907.32s: trade I will risk no more than 10% of
910.80s: the portfolio value so while I might be
913.44s: using a lot of the portfolio I'm not
915.92s: going to allow the risk that's in each
919.76s: trade to exceed 10% so what's up with
922.36s: this why do I do this well the core
924.72s: allocation for me is the primary way I'm
927.64s: looking to meet my annual return
930.28s: objectives now I can't always get it
933.20s: through the core allocation because in
935.84s: these next two you'll see the profit
938.44s: mechanisms that I'm using are things
940.16s: like positive drift sector rotation and
942.08s: momentum so I'm trading things like
945.92s: indices and
947.68s: ETFs if we're in a bare Market this
950.76s: ain't going to work that well so I need
952.80s: to lean more heavily and use more money
956.64s: in my speculative allocation in order to
958.64s: make a the difference using some of
960.68s: these other kinds of strategies so you
963.36s: can see the strategies that I use in
964.84s: both the different kinds of profit me
966.52s: mechanisms that I'm looking to take
967.76s: advantage of but what I'm looking to do
969.88s: is lean on the core allocation as much
971.92s: as I can and then as soon as that's
974.20s: coming up short on my monthly targets
976.44s: because I take my annual targets and
977.72s: break them down into smaller targets
