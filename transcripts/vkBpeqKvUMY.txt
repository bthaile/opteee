 you you you you you you rally so set great to see you. Jacobi says no sound that is by design. It is so that the video does not become copyright infringed. The main issue with that is they literally can pull the whole video down. It's not just that it gets demonetized. That's annoying, but that's whatever. It's that they'll literally pull the video. So, um, and T.C. M. King says he leaves sound off so no copyright. Yep. That's exactly correct. And then T.C. M. King, views videos like this should be fine. Yeah. So it's really tricky. The problem with stuff like this is that it is entirely up to discretion. So big other larger entities get a little bit more of a pass than smaller entities like me because smaller entities like me are more, more likely to use somebody else's brand or information to grow our own brand. It's obviously not what I'm doing at all, but that's the angle. Whereas larger entities, they typically add audience into the sphere. So they get a much bigger pass. Fun fact, I was actually really, really surprised because T.C. M. King to your point, one of the videos that got copyrighted on from a live stream and they literally pulled the whole video down was that video that we talked about the different vaccines. And after that video, like I went through the section that they flagged and they said a couple things about it. And I listened to the section and I realized that it's just kind of like a topic that is really sensitive to a lot of entities. And then I was looking at, I was listening to a podcast with Joe Rogan on that was on YouTube. And his podcast was actually kind of smashing some of them. And that video was still up. And I'm glad that it is. I'm not saying that I'm upset that there's a double standard or anything like that. That's not it at all. But it does highlight that size, sorry, fellas, size does matter. So it applies in this space very much. So yeah, that's why I'm super careful about it. Now for those that are curious about things like fair use, fair use, that's the problem with fair uses. It doesn't have a definition. Fair use is like a very open-ended, laissez-faire thing. So I am convinced that I could easily play clips of this. Like if we wanted to listen, right, like we can listen to that just fine. There's no problem if I play a little bit here and there and then I add some transformative overlay language on top of it. But what I do for you guys when I start like the holding room is I just prefer to have something on in the background for you all to take a look at. And if it's just playing by itself all the way straight, that's when it becomes much more problematic. This is all shit that I don't know anything about man. Like I literally I'm just kind of figuring this all out as I'm floating along on this space rock. And it's very entertaining. But this, what do you guys think? Did, did we're in Kitty listen to this? Like when he was talking about it at a curiosity. Because I have no idea what the cat does or does not do. But I am curious because that's what they were just speculating that the cat might have been listening in. And so what's the agenda for today? Well, the agenda is pretty damn pretty damn simple. TCM kids says listen to what the news don't know to left because this they were literally here. I'll play the section for you. Give me a sec. This section right here. Listen. Hey, if you will, it clearly hasn't started. Maybe he's listening to our interview now. Maybe he's hearing you cast doubt on him on the trading, the company itself. I mean, if you could speak directly to him, what would you say? What would he say? What are you thinking about? So that's the section. I'm actually curious if you guys think that he was listening to that one. Because that's kind of funny. That would be like a giant, just a inception moment where like they're waiting to watch him, but he's watching them. That's pretty pretty funny. Lauren says that's not the one where left cries. Where? Where is that? I don't actually think he cries. I would love to see it. I just I've never seen it. Which one does he actually cry in? And then for those that don't know tonight, we're adding a isy into the mix. And it's very good, but it tastes like straight diabetes. It's like 14 grams of sugar and eight ounces. It's a shit ton of sugar. The one he's all red faces from 2021. We have to find that one eventually. I need to see that. That's just so damn funny. If there's like a whole grown ass man crying about this, I yeah, I have to see that. All right. Oh no, it's time it is man. It's time to get to work. We got some we got some stuff to do. While I'm getting this gend up, we do need to update our map. Do we have any new map ads? So if you're new listening in and you've not popped on these before. I like to add where people are dialing in from where people are listening in from so that we can see just how expansive this whole thing is. We officially had somebody from Greenland, which is pretty fucking sick, I think. And we have the US is a shotgun blast. South America looks quiet. Africa still blank. But in fact, my good friends actually go into Africa. So I might have to have him dial into one of these live streams at a obscene time so that I can at least put a little pin on the map in good faith. We got Australia. I think there was somebody that said they were from New Zealand. There's New Zealand. So we have good coverage. So if you've not let me know where you're from, throw it in the chat at any point. And I can update this as we go. All right. So let's start with a quick recap of GameStop. I talked a little bit about it on Thursday. And then we did a live stream Thursday. So I just want to talk specifically about the close. We have a couple of events coming up pretty soon. This thing shows delayed data. So this might not load anything if it's going through an update phase, which it looks like is exactly what it's doing. Give me one sec. I'll dump you guys on the spare screen real fast. I'll close this down and see if I can reopen it back up. If not, I can just use something like trading viewer or whatever. Well, I can't literally win even close. There goes. That was super weird. All right. Let me log back in. Scott says Massachusetts. Well, while think her swim is loading, let's see. Yeah, it looks like we have Massachusetts. Where Massachusetts are you? What city? We can we can wrap your city on the map. Right now think her swim is just installing updates. I don't know if it's going to actually work or not. We'll give it a couple seconds. Framing ham. Oh, it's different than what I would have expected. That's very different than what I expected. Okay. So it's just West of Boston. My my really good friend. He went to Northeastern. So I spent I spent several a drunken night stumbling around Boston. Oh, that's funny. And I typically would take like the 95 and 100 or something. A CDJ says you have my amy. We could take a look. My amy. We don't. We had Florida like just general Florida, but we didn't have. We didn't have my amy. Okay, so I don't know if think her swim is just down for me or not. We'll pivot away from it. We'll just use trading viewer or something. I'll leave it on in the in the background. While it's trying to get its life together, we don't really need it. I wanted to use it for some charting and for some options analysis, which we can kind of talk about it anyways. Does trading view have options? That would be kind of cool. Can you look at options on training view? You know, trading views not opening either. What the fuck is happening right now? This is madness. Zach says isn't left in prison. No, he deferred his case. I want to say for his trial isn't until next year now. It's not until like October of next year. All right. So trading view. My internet might be going down because I don't know what's happening right now. I can't literally I am like gridlocked. I can't do shit. There it goes. Okay, so trading view just loaded. Damn. I'm not going to lie. I don't see oh, they do have options. This is great. So we could just use trading view. Fantastic. All right. So let's grab this map over here now. We'll just let think her swim continue to ground on the background until it gets its act together. Move you guys over here in case you're wondering above my head here, this is Iceland. This is one of the glacial slides that we cruised up on. This is from my drone. Game stop. There we go. The joke is they're trying to keep me down as I'm trying to look at this stuff. Sometimes joking aside, it can feel like that. Obviously, it's not what's actually happening, but it makes me feel generally annoyed. All right. So let's see what I've never looked at options in here before. Oh, Lord. This is a they have a surface, which is kind of nice. I mean. Yeah. I don't know if we're going to be able to do much with this guys. This is pretty rough. I can't see like oh, I can see shit. I can see shit in here. All right. Let's just take a look at the chart. We'll just go to a chart. All right. Great week. Great week for GameStop. So GameStop. It landed up ever so slightly. Here's what I saw. This obviously was highly anomalous when the cat chose to post. That sent things in a fervor. And we talked about that. I literally made a video about that specifically because of genuinely how topical I think it kind of is because it definitely beyond the shadow of a doubt highlights the fact that there are algorithms specifically stalking when he posts. Like that is it. You guys know that I do my absolute best to be as objective as humanly possible. And unless there's something that I'm very confident in, I won't call it straight. I would always caveat things as like I could be wrong. And I can be wrong about this to be very clear. I'm no fucking pressy and omnipotent being. There's no like heroes in this story. This is all of us just trying to figure it out as we go. But with something like this, I feel very confident to say that the price action that we saw when he posted to me made it very, very clear that there are algorithms stalking and trying to front run his posts and the expected impact of his posts. And I mean, right, wrong and different doesn't really matter what I think. But what does matter is that's also a highly tradable effect. And it's objectively a tradable effect. It's actually something that is not too difficult to catch as it's happening. You just to be very fast. But if we go into can we do like a one minute, one second chart would be hella intense. We need to go here. So you can see at 1045 when the cat dropped his nuts on the table via a non-descript meme with no text and no specific information about anything, obviously would send game stop flying. And this volume jacked over this one minute candle. And then it subsequently drifted over a little bit of time. This actually begs the question since this can go even shorter. Let's go to like 30 seconds. Oh, I can't go to 30 seconds because I have the the peasant version of this. Maybe somebody that has the paid version of this to take a look in terms of seconds. That would actually be kind of neat to see. And then I got to pop the door for Thorke because I'll just got home. He's losing his mind. All right. Yeah. Zach says, what do you think back to back days, the 1045 minute candles 24 hours apart? What do you mean? 1045 here or you mean the day after? 1045. I don't see anything sticking out to me there. I see here. Okay. So initial thoughts is I don't fucking know. That's very strange. Now there are and the reason why I went silent for a second is because part of what I do when I'm trying to analyze something that I can't necessarily identify and affect very quickly is I start to think of it in terms of probabilities. And I think of it in terms of different styles of explanations. So in this case, what I was doing is I was looking at all the different times around it to see if there's anything even close. And I don't see that. Now the other thing to note is this had a clear catalyst. This did not as far as we can see. And it also had, yeah, that's like a massive spike in volume. My guess it has something to do with like a 24 hour holding thing. I don't know why, but that would be my that would be my best guess. I don't know why the volume itself. Oh, interesting. So it looks like think or swim is still having issues turning on. Are other people able to get on to think or swim at a curiosity? Because mine just gave me like a proxy error. I don't actually seen those see those too frequently. But T. seems as some some some it could be. Let's take a look at what fuck I wish I could get on the damn platform so I could look at stuff. Let's take a look at 1045. We can look at unusual wheels and see what we can find in there. Let me grab unusual wheels. It's under it's down for maintenance until 12 am. I hate it when they do this. I do so much of my work when the market is closed. That is so annoying. They need us. Lauren says what is some thumb thumb that's the thing that Roy and Kitty put up this thing. This is from I forgot what movie you guys will know all of this stuff. I literally don't remember the movie name. I've watched some of it. I didn't get through. Oh, dude, that's it. I didn't get through all of it. But yeah, you put in like this little thing in the ground. It pulls the sand worm and then he has to like hook on to it to go for a ride with these little baby graphing hooks. That doesn't even really make sense to me. It's like I feel like to get on a worm that size. You need some fucking pikes of grappling hooks like those little baby grappling hooks ain't going to do it. You need like two pickaxes. Maybe pickaxi would be the name. Like you really feel like you got to be on there. And is this is he supposed to be able to steer it? Is that the idea? He's standing, but can he steer it? Was he steering it or just riding it? Because I feel like if you're trying to steer it by pulling them little lines man, that's a big ass worm. You would need a big old hook in order to get that thing to move. That worm probably doesn't even know you're on there. Big ass worm. It reminds me of tremors. You guys ever see tremors? That was a fantastic movie. I love that one. Big, big fan, but that's what thumb, thumb, thumb is. So there's an idea that the cat is doing something on the back end to cause disruption or movements for hedge funds and what not like the larger institutions, which I do think that there could be some corollary there. But let's take a look. So let's go, let's say objective about it for now. You know we can grab the tinfoil hat. I still have the fucking tinfoil hat. It sits there right there. I'm a printer. So we can get into tinfoil, but I really try to keep my feelings and thoughts about stuff aside and look at stuff objectively for you all so that you can then decide what you think. So let's go here. Let's go to what was it? So Thursday's when he posted so was it Friday? Wait, was that Friday? I don't think we need this one. It was Friday. The other trick here is this could be something to do with pop-axe. I don't know what, but let's see. And I do like a specific time. I can do a specific time. Great. And I want to do it from 10, 40, to 10, 50. No big, no big dark pull trades. That's actually kind of interesting. I would have expected, I would have absolutely expected to see more movement there. Oh, fuck is it giving me these weird-ass times, bro? I could just want the whole time. I guess this would leave a day off. That's annoying that you can't just easily update those times. Now let's do a pipe. Yeah, nothing, nothing crazy there. And I know from an options perspective, there wasn't anything that stuck out to me. I don't think it's that. Yeah, I don't think it was that. So this, man, that's very curious. Let's go back. Let's find another previous Friday. Here. Friday, November 29th. Wait, why does this- is it a half day? Oh, we got to go back more. Friday, the 24th. Oh, interesting. When is this spike? 57, 45, nothing. Okay. So that's probably just chasing ghosts. I could do a broader statistical analysis on intraday. But I kind of want to do it. I don't want to waste your guys' time, but I kind of want to do it. Because what I would like to do is grab intraday minute-level data from GameStop. And I can go back like at least the past month. And I can look at the number of instances where GameStop has higher than average intraday volume at 1045. The problem is there's not a ton we learn from it. But it's just kind of like a nong curiosity that I have. Maybe, yeah, let me do it real quick. It's not going to take me that long. I actually can probably get GPT or something like that to do this. So let me grab GME. And then let's go to historical data. And then we need minute-level. We can do 15 minutes. That'll be a lot easier. 15 minutes. And then we'll see how far back. Maximum 20,000 records. So it's not going to be able to go back very far, but that's okay. I'm just going to try to make it go back a couple months. I won't go back that far though. That's not good. All right. And let's see what we have here. Where does this go back to? Yeah, okay. So it goes back a couple months. This is fine. So what I'm going to do now is just kind of clean this a little bit so that we can dump this into pet GPT. So this looks okay. Save that. Kill it. Save that. I think I said, you're just safe, bro. What the... am I tripping? This looks like I'm hitting safe. What the fuck? Dude, it's the weirdest things whenever I'm doing shit for this fucking stock. I'm telling you, every fucking. It's always something weird. All right. And then for this, we want to use GPT. Let's grab this. I'm going to see... I want to see first if that's saved. If it didn't save, then GPT typically has an issue with it. Oops, didn't mean to do that. It didn't save it. It's a fucking hater. Can you please save? I think it's saved. Okay. Great. Now it's saved. Maybe they just had to ask nicely instead of insulting it. It's almost like there might be something to that. Okay. So now I'm going to have it. Analyze... plot the... plot the volume... volume at 1045 to 1100 against the one-day average. Let's do against the average 15-minute volume for the same day. Identify the dates where there is anomalous volume at 1045. Exceeding the average 15-minute volume by at least 2x. Do that says. I'm curious how well this will work for me. A little C. In the meantime, I'm going to keep eyeballing a little bit. Okay. So it has a handful of instances. This is interesting. This is very interesting. So let's go to November 7th. I'm going to change this to 15 minutes so it's easier to navigate 15 minutes. Let's go to November 7th. There's one other thing I'm going to look at. I mean, the volume doubled there, but that doesn't... that's not that crazy. Okay. So now what I want to do is create a plot to identify the three most common 15-minute periods where volume expands at least. What do you want to look at? What is this? How do you view the volume on this other? It is okay. Volume is 720 to 740. So at least 2x from the intraday 15-minute average. Okay. So to run down what I just found from the original looking at 1045, there are a few days that 1045 had anomalous volume. More than I would have expected, honestly, in a relatively short sample, it was at least five instances, six instances. So there's probably something from a programmatic standpoint when things are set to go. Now what I'm doing is I'm trying to identify and it's exactly what I would expect. So the three most common 15-minute periods with volume expansion is 0,930. It's exactly what you would expect 1545 exactly what you would expect and then 0,945, which is not what you would expect necessarily. So this seems this seems generally in line with expectations. So what that tells me from this movement that we saw over the last couple days, we would need to see more of it is what it summarizes to. Like I wouldn't feel comfortable saying that without a doubt there's something going on here. Like at the 1045 handle, because it's just two data points, it's weird. And in the world of data analysis, a lot of times what we do is we find things that are weird and then we pay close attention to them because we want to know if it's something that's persistent, if there's something behind it for some reason. But I do think there's something potentially behind that time frame. I just don't know what. But that's also not a bizarre time frame for transaction activity to start picking up. We're getting into like the last trading couple hours of the day. Volume will often expand during that time frame. So yeah, interesting. But not totally anomalous because again, one of the reasons why I wanted to see how many instances did we see volume for the 1045 candle expanding the average 15 minute volume by at least two times and it happens quite a few times. I see six instances where it was way more than that. And quite a few more instances were at at least occurred. So yeah, I don't necessarily see anything jumping out at me there, but very interesting. What I find most interesting to zoom this out and to talk about the chart from, I wish I had think her swim up said, oh my shit, it feels like I'm in like a foreign house right now. It feels like I'm in somebody else's office trying to do my work. It's just not the same vibe. But I mean, we'll we'll make it happen. The main thing is I have a few price levels that I think are really relevant and interesting. So we can see one of them creating a bit of a floor here. We can see blue. Why the fuck would it be blue? Blue is terrible. It needs to be like gold or something something cool. Blue. We got time for blue. Stop that immediately. Blue is trash. Absolutely trash. The line is as thin as possible. It's good. Okay. So we can see price is clearly picking levels, which is again, really, really nice to see. I would love to throw a volume profile on this, but I don't think I can because again, I have the peasant version and I think that you only get like two indicators. I could take the, I forgot. I have RSI on here. We could drop the RSI really fast and then we can add volume profile if it has it. That would be cool. I don't really care about RSI here. Indicators volume profile. What the fuck auto anchored? That sounds right. Most important price points and volume levels depending on the chart current timeframes. Yeah, that's right. We want that. That damn it. Why can't I use this? Yeah, these guys are haters. You can't put shit on this chart without buying it. Bastards. What's this thing do? That's not the same, but that would be fine if I can use this. Yeah, fine. Whatever. This is whoever made, whoever made this thing, I appreciate your effort. It is not at all what I want. This is Boive. Never mind, gang. Let's just get rid of that. Let's just do that. Let's just search VRVP. Let's see. VRVP. Visible range volume proof. Yeah, this is closer. Still not what I want, but they got damn it. Trady View. These guys are haters. I only have one indicator. They won't even let your boy get a second indicator on the four free. You got to buy some shit. Damn it. Think her swim. Think her swim needs to be up right now. All right. Well, this is what we're relegated to is we can have RSI, which is great, I guess. Beautiful for us. What I wanted to see are there's a handful of price levels here that I think are really, really relevant. We can't see them right now, but they're there. What I'm noticing is prices consolidating pretty well. I want to drive that point home because since prices consolidating pretty well, I find that to be really positive. I find it to be so positive, even though it was a little bit of a down day, a couple down days, I find it to be positive because this is literally the assumption of more normal price activity. I just think that's good for trading view. I don't see a scenario where that's negative for trading view here or trading view for GameStop. I don't know why I would say trading view right now. I wouldn't say that I don't like them as much as Robinhood because I still like their stuff. I would just love it if they would let me get a second indicator on the chart for fucking free. I'm not asking for more than two, but you know, beggars cannot be choosers. We only get these. So if you guys can though in the background, if you can keep trying think her swim because it might pop up while we're on here, I'll keep running it up once in a while and see, wait a minute, the web platform. The web platform, think her swim has a web platform. Fuck that one's down to. I really thought I outsmarted them there. I really thought I had them going, but I didn't damn it. We tried. All right, let's get into this. Dusty, dusty, dusty, you don't like trading view. I think trading view is fine. I don't use them. I use them obviously as like a backup, but you could tell how clujee me getting around in it is. So yeah, like I typically just use think her swim because think her swim is completely fine and does everything I need. But trading views like the only one I've used so far is like a backup. So from that perspective, it's good. All right, so I remember this now. We have a way to find bingo. See, look how efficient we're getting here. We know we're leaving off. Let us get in. I think we did this. Okay. So it looks, it looks good. That Paul Revere has been definitely a staunch supporter of GameStop going back to his famous ride in the middle of the night, letting everybody know first that the British were coming and he's also letting us know that the attendees are coming, which is great. It's always good to have like really prolific figures a part of the journey and a part of the path here. So big fan. And let us now see what this person, oh, I forgot. I remember don't worry. I remembered our cheat code to get through this. And again, if there's any one of these that I'm supposed to go slower on, let me know. And then I'm more than happy to dive into the ones that look really interesting. What I'm doing now is I'm just grabbing the text. I'm going to dump it into chat GPD in this case perplexity and then use chat GPD's engine to summarize. Well, I actually probably use perplexity or clogged. I think, then that clogged probably use perplexity for this. Perplexity is pretty good at this kind of stuff. And I'm going to have it summarize for us what this is talking about. The point is to get to the big level details quickly because this document is absolutely massive. It's over 800 pages. And this isn't even the whole DD library. This is literally like in a malgamation of DD at one point in the library. We still have like straight up the whole library to go through. I didn't realize what I was signing up for when I said that we're going to go through this DD library. But I also, I'm one of those people that once I start doing something, I'm going to fucking finish it. So this could take me into next year eat. Well, it's definitely going to take me into next year. I don't know if it'll take me through next year. That would be kind of nuts. We'll see. I don't fucking know. But if it does, it does so be it. You boys here for the boys here for the ride. And then I was texting with Newton a little bit. I need to get like a bunch of information from him on like a leave off period for what he's thinking will be really pertinent going forward because I want to try to help track some of those things just so that people can monitor some of the same metrics because I know he's doing stuff like the swaps and whatnot. But yeah. Okay, here's the TL TLDR at the bottom. So another thing is the TLDR being at the bottom is just a vicious move. Normally, those would be more towards the top. So, you know, I've got to feel some type of way about this. Okay, so summarize, summarize this and dump this whole thing in. TCM King says I would be interested in seeing you skip and go over when the river runs dry, more options focus. Oh, I'll definitely get there. But part of the reason of me doing this is for my own education and benefit. So I am a significant, significant, proponent of getting to base level data by ourselves individually on your own. That's why I do this on live streams with you all is because this is exactly what I would be doing anyways. The difference is I just live stream doing it so that you all can hopefully find some more first layer information for yourselves as well. I just think that's so important to get to first hand level information because it's all of us have played the game of telephone. And the problem with telephone is as you go through 3, 4, 5, 6 people, the message is fucking completely different than what you started. You could be like, Ayo, the attendees are coming and then at the end it'll be like, yo, I want to make gang bang. It's just be completely fucking different than what you started as. And it's not due to anybody necessarily trying to be lame. It's due to the passage of information and it changes over time naturally. So I am a really significant supporter of first level, first contact information. So that's exactly what I'm doing here. All right. That's not it. That's not it at all. So this got all fucked up. Summarize this post. It went back to the data analysis so I think I needed to start like a new thread. Okay, here we go. And then I'll move this over so that you guys can see it too. This can go like that. Without the platform, I actually don't know how wide the screen is. So you guys will have to let me know I'm assuming this will be completely off your screen. How far can you see you could see to there? Yeah, okay. So it looks like this. This will work. Great. Okay. Dusty Dusty is happy to hear he's not stopping his stream. He is inspirational. Oh, is he not? That's great if he's not. I hope he's not. I haven't talked to him about. I literally didn't even know that he was stopping. I don't watch all of his videos. That's literally just because I don't really watch anybody stuff. But I'll try to catch some of his stuff sometimes or I'll ask him some messages like we'll text back and forth. But you guys are the ones that told me that he was talking about stopping. So if he has now decided not to, that would be fantastic. I would love that. Okay, so this is what it says. April 2020 GameStop price bottomed under two COVID-19 impacts, shorting, triple to six. So this just looks like it's talking about. This looks like it's just talking about like the price path of it. Dusty Dusty says he said to him in his video. That's awesome. That's great news. That's just a win across the board. Did he say what made him change his mind? I'm just going to text him. I'm really curious. Okay. Okay. So, what is this? Most argues that GME's leadership likely supports a share recall. Okay. Well, that didn't happen. See, this is the kind of thing I am genuinely kind of happy that we can skip through some of it. Because if the ultimate thesis turns out to be something that's just not what happened, is this another post that I did I go too far? Fuck. I'm lost now. Hold on. Nope. Didn't mean to do that. And this. Okay. So this is the next post. I just want to read their TLDR. Activists in the Lester, large vote, short interest over 100%. Jimmy does a share recall ahead of his meeting. Okay. Yeah. So it just didn't happen. Okay. Good enough. T.C. M. King says I get that. I think there's just too much and a lot of it. It's just the same. Yeah. There definitely is a lot. There ain't too much dog. You guys don't understand. Well, maybe you do. Maybe you don't. But the literally the world of a trader is sifting through massive amounts of information, quickly trying to decipher as much as you possibly can and then making decisions off of it. So for me, this really isn't that much work. And here's the cool part. If I'm not mistaken, built in AI assistant, it needs the stuff just to be less than I think it said 400 pages, which we're coming up on that. So what I'll do is I'm literally going to split this PDF into two different PDFs so that then we can use the native AI, which I think will be much quicker. That's my that's my ultimate game plan. If not, you're just going to see your fucking boy doing a lot of fucking reading. All right. Let's see what this says. So this we can clear this had this summarized this next talk. Nope, that's the wrong one. That is the wrong one. I summarize the second piece. Well, let's see if it can do this. I have I have faith. Maybe I don't fucking have faith. I've lost all faith. We have to do another thread. Summarize this. There's got to be a better way to do that though. You guys you guys know how to fucking get it. Maybe I need to name the sources. That could be it. Spectative analysis, game stop, potential future events could trigger short squeeze again. So this we can kind of flip through a bit. Yep. So co-in joining all that stuff. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lead to a significant price move in a game stop technical indicators potential cattle. Yeah. So this is again to I think this was to dust to dust point very much the same as kind of the last one. The next one the naked shorting scam in numbers. I think we can comfortably move through this one pretty quickly because I feel most of us are appraised. Does this have a TLDR in it? Maybe I'll just scan through it super fast. This one I feel like we have a pretty good grasp on at this point. Why would it go to 101? That's so frustrating. 100 is great. Thanks. All right. Let's flip through this. Oh, here we go. Hold. Okay. Great. Built an AI deep in the money calls to create naked shares. Yep. So one of the things to know as I look at this is I don't think you can make this claim. Like I and I'm actually very curious how they're going to make this claim. Keep in the money call covering seems to be the last resort of illegal desperation. It's so easy to spot. Okay. Investigated Mary put naked shorting at the Jan mini squeeze open interest the creation of millions of naked shares with married put trades. Put volumes appear to be sustained at higher levels to keep rolling over. I don't agree with this conclusion outright. Up to 400 million naked shares created in total. Look through 13 F. Finally. Here we go. Clear idea who's on which side of the battle. Okay. Dark pool data from finra which we have access to massive changes in trade behavior since Jan huge increases in shares traded by each trade is of a few shares. Okay. All right. Let's see what it says. Yeah. Let's do this deep in the money call thing. I'm really curious about this. Want to share sold short without being owned or borrowed. It is sold naked. Yep. Can happen as part of normal market activity. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. We know all this. They can resolve the F. D.s without actually covering is through locates. Yes. Deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately to acquire the shares and close F. D.s. Let's take a look at this. That have been observed. Appeared to circumvent certain requirements of reg show. Okay. Hard to borrow securities can be subject to pricing disparity relative to options trading on the same security makes it ton of sense. Typically they may be seen in synthetic positions trading at lower price than the underlying security that creates an arbitrage. Yep. This is exactly yep. This creates a potential of profit. Yep. For short sellers of the underlying security. If they can avoid the high cost to typically associated with obtaining for delivery, that's right. Risk alerts highlights observed trading strategies that can be designed to circumvent certain requirements of reg show among other things. Reg show requires fail to deliver positions resulting from short sale transactions to be closed out by a specific date either by borrowing or purchasing securities of a like kind. Yes. Okay. Reg show. No. Trading strategies could be used to impression purchasing by the short seller of satisfied closed out requirements of the clearing firm with the broker dealer. Okay. Reality. The purchase shares in a position are oftentimes not delivered because of subsequent options trading used to reestablish or otherwise extend the broker to release fail position without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose such that the clearing firm broker dealer allocated a fail to deliver position does not satisfy was that requirement. Okay. Yep. Same page so far. As I'm going through this, if you guys have any questions, let me know. This makes this this looks completely great forward to me. The locate requirement which we know purposes for market maker, must also be a market maker security being sold yes, yes. Okay. Provides that it constitutes a manipulative or deceptive device or and try vans. Fuck yeah. Look at that fucking word. Contribence. I don't know what y'all know about. I don't know what you guys know about anything, but I'm here trying to talk about some contrivance. I'm here also trying to order some dinner. What do you guys think is for dinner tonight? The steak last night was good. I'm almost I'm almost tempted to kind of run it back, but I'm not set on it. Honestly, maybe Ian says burgers. I could do a burger. I was thinking maybe Chinese. Chinese sometimes like really, really scratches an itch. Might be Chinese, yeah. Burgers is another definitely another potential. I don't really know what leaks are, but that's kind of a I like the name leaks. I've had leaks before. I don't really know what they are. I like them. Dan Dan noodles, sardines and crackers. I do like sardines on a Caesar salad. If you can get a nice sardine on a Caesar salad that is on fleek, I think we're going Mexican because it's fast. Leaks are like green onions. Oh, interesting. Yeah, anytime I have them, I don't really recall like a bunch of flavor from them. I just kind of know that I eat them. Perfect. All right. I'm going to wait for Mel to turn down that because I know she's not going to want it, but I have to send a tour out of just being thoughtful. Rowing to these is cashew chicken. Oh, you mean from Chinese? I'm like a chicken with broccoli. Chicken with broccoli is good or sesame chicken. If it's like spicy, you could put a little spice in there. That's pretty good. Yep. So she's passing on this. I'm going to ask her up pennies. See if she wants that instead. All right. Let's get back into this while she's sorting her life out. Okay. Bye, right. Here we go. Simultaneous sale of calls with the purchase of equivalent amount of shares underlying. So this is a really, really common. This is a really common strategy for larger style funds and things like that or people that are trading for income. I was actually just going to open up the Thinkerswin platform to show you the risk profile of it. And obviously I cannot do that. So what I can do is draw a perfect Mel would do Chinese. So we're going to audible it and we are going to roll with Chinese. Every once in a while, I just have to like row a random other thing by her. And every once in a while, it'll connect. And it looks like we we got it tonight, which is great. Do you guys like like a PF Changs kind of Chinese or like a local Chinese place? I like the local stuff way better. Signature domain that looks good. Sesame chicken that is 100% happening. We don't need any extras with that. And then I think we need chicken with broccoli. Perfect. Local New York has the best. Yeah, New York has really, really good Chinese food. That's one thing I do miss about New York in general is New York is kind of like a melting pot for all different kinds of foods. And there are a lot of really, really good foods there. I'm a massive fan. Okay, so let me draw this for you. Does everybody know what a buy right is? Because if you do, then I can skip over this. But if you don't, then I can draw it out super fast. You guys can let me know what you're what you're leaning is. Willie says need. Okay, so Joe doesn't that's totally cool. As long as we have one know, then it's worth the time. So let me grab this. We'll do this, this, and this. So you guys should be able to. Perfect. So here's a buy right. I can buy it open 100 shares of GameStop. And the risk profile for this, are you guys familiar with what a risk profile is? Risk profile just plots the PNL of something. So this is a zero line. This is your negative return. This is positive return. And then this is stock price. This is stock at zero, which is today right now. And then this is stock as it goes up. And then this is stock as it goes down. So when you buy 100 shares at spot price, it'll look something like not that, that, right? So what this does is it means as GameStop goes up, you make money as it goes down, you lose money. I think everybody's pretty comfortable and familiar with that. Now, a buy right is when we do this first trade, and then we pair it with the second trade, which is when we sell to open one. And then it can be whatever strike call. So X call at one dollar, whatever the price is. So what this means is we're going to collect a $100 credit upfront. And then our new risk profile will look like this. So rather than having unlimited upside potential, like you see here, the other trade would look like this. This one takes this departure. And it's because you're collecting money upfront on the call. So a lot of people will do this when they are getting into stocks that they really like, that they want a hold, that they don't mind holding. And it's a way to collect a little bit of a premium literally while you're getting into something that you want to be in anyways. So there's no love lost on buying the shares selling the call against it. That's the idea behind it. Buy rates associated with the activity at issue employee deep in the money calls. A married put is the simultaneous purchase of a put and purchase of equivalent amount of shares in the underlying. So a married put by comparison is this. Back to the risk profile that you all experts on now. This is price again, this is the zero line. And what a married put is designed to do is you buy to open 100 shares. And then you buy to open one X strike put at whatever a dollar. So in this case, you're going to pay $100. But what this does is if you remember the first line, this here is stock at zero. This is what long stock looks like. When we look at the buy right, it looks like this. Let me use a different color. Buy right will look like this. And then a married put will instead look like this. The won't go past the zero line. So this is the difference. This is what a buy right will look like. If I were to extrapolate it out by itself, it would be like this. And the purpose of this is you limit your downside. So this means if GameStop goes down to zero, your max loss is capped here. And it looks great, right? Like why wouldn't everybody do this? Well, most people don't do it because it's really expensive to buy the puts. It's really, really expensive on a relative level. So that's what those two look like in conjunction with one another. So now let's take a look at the rest of this because I'm actually really curious what it thinks the the total connection is. I've not seen the description through this yet. I'm not looking through this whole thing. Joe says, okay, I do know what I do know what buying to open covered calls and so on. I didn't know it was a buy right. It's just called a buy right. And it's not right as in right or left. It's right as in writing. Like you're writing an option. That's a that's an old way of saying selling an option. People don't really use that anymore writing an option, but that's an old way of saying selling an option. You write an option. So that's why it's called a buy right because of just older school language. Okay. When associated with the activity issue, Mary puts typically employee deep in the money puts likes options are exchange level options that have non-standard customizable contract terms. The main features of flex options compare to standard traded options or the ability to specify strike price and expiration date. Yep. Price at the market. Pull call parity. Yes. And that X. Yes. Here we go. Periodically, security's become hard to borrow and where the large and persistent fails to deliver in a security end up threshold security list. These situations give rise to pricing differentials and the options of these securities and the pull call parity equation may appear out of balance, which is in part a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities. When the shares become hard to borrow, the synthetic position typically trades at a price that are less than the actual shares. This reflects the risk that shares cannot be borrowed and will have to be bought in compliance with the right show closeout requirements. In the extreme, these price differences can be quite large creating profit, potential profit opportunities and certain options trading strategies for those who are able to short the underlying equity securities without paying the high cost typically associated with obtaining delivery hard to borrow security. That result short. Yep. Makes total sense. I dig all of this. This is really like, I think they did a good job outlining this because it's super, super clear. One strategy could be designed to get manage of potential profit opportunities. Rowing, Rowing, what up, Rowing, Titty? Rowing, Titty says Rob Kitty, who logs up on 125's every expiration. Kitty is the decent master. That's funny. I highly doubt it, but it could be and they would be fucking hilarious. But yeah, I severely doubt that it's him. Why am I getting added to these fucking WhatsApp groups, dude? WhatsApp is super annoying. Trippy says maybe that's what they were doing with those massive 125 puts. Do you mean 125 puts or calls? Because I most people are typically talking about the super far out of the money calls, which is generally just unit building. I'm not sure about the put scenario that you're referring to, but we could take a look at it. All right. Activity, most often, number broker dearers who claim to rely on the exceptional locate requirement for options market makers, options market makers claim they can enter into the short stock position without first. Locating the shares to borrow because it's part of a bona fide market making activity. Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an exemption or exception to the locate to comply with right. So the options market maker still must deliver in shares in settlement or if in a field of deliver position results in a clearing firm that failed to deliver must be closed out in accordance with right. So maybe a violation. Yeah. Where the market maker does not deliver shares and engages in second subsequent insurance actions in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firms obligations to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting field of settlement. That's fascinating. In addition, we're a clearing firm subject to close out requirements purchases or borrow securities applicable close out. Yeah. All right. So they're talking about building a synthetic long time. Assuming XYZ is hard to borrow trader A or its broker dealers unwilling to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares. It may result in FTD rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position. They may enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the close out requirements. But in reality allows trader A to maintain the short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often this is done through the use of buy right, but may also be done as merit put. Interesting. It's a commonly referred to as reset transactions. They have the effect of reset in the time that a broker dealer must purchase or borrow it. Yep. And we know that this is happening. And this is one of the, this is one of the main issues because we look at this, we know that this is happening. And we also know that to the degree that this is happening, there's nothing that technically can stop it unless it's regulated out because you can just perpetuate the position. That's the whole point of it. Rowing City says, are there even 125 puts? Yeah. Well, if there's 125 call, I would pull it up on the platform. But if there's 125 calls, there would be 125 puts. They are side by side with one another and an options chain. So very interesting. I'll drop this in here for you all to take a look at at your leisure. But I like that one. That was interesting. I think we can close that. Let's see where we're at in this thing. Look, look at this. We're literally halfway through the third row. Flock in hell. This is a big project we started. I won't go into all the details, but points you towards God tier DD. Okay. Well, gotta look at God tier DD. Okay. Can't look at God tier DD. One way naked short can resolve deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately. Yep. Yeah. 140 million FDDs being hidden since January. Add detection of option volumes used to hide FDDs and FDD values. Let me see. So I see the point that he's making. Yeah. So I like the this. I agree with totally suspicious deep in the money call volumes. I completely agree with this as suspicious and definitely correlated to a degree. Completely agree with that. But the problem with these kinds of things when we're conducting this style of analysis is there's a lot. There is a lot of stuff going on. And when we start to see FDD starting to skyrocket, there's typically other things going on in the underlying at that point in time. So thus the problem here is we're looking at two indiscreet variables discreetly. There's other stuff at play when we're looking at this. And then we're trying to design a causal relationship that may or may not be there. So I completely agree on the suspicious element of this. I and I 100% agree with that. But I think that we can't make the leap that we're saying this is that it's evidence that there's 140 million FDDs being hidden because FDDs happen to coincide with call activity because we can see that FDDs also skyrocket here. And then there's really no significant rise in the call activity. So same thing here. So as a causal relationship, I don't know if it gets that. Now when things get to an extreme like this, which looks like during the 2021 move, it's no surprise that you would see everything start to get out of whack at that point. So that's not to say that there's nothing behind this. I completely agree. But I just I think that you can't make a causal relation a definitive causal relationship. We can speculate. We can say that this is suspicious. We can say that we think that this is tied. We can say that we think this is going on. But I think that's different than saying something like this. And again, this is the nature of how I analyze things. Is I'm very reluctant to discreetly decide Ye-Ear-Nay or to qualify something as something until I have a really rigorous analysis behind it. And this is just missing a couple pieces. So I think this is on the right track. I think it's looking at a clear problem completely agree with all that. But I don't think that it necessarily leads to the discreet conclusion that they're coming with. Here we see that suspicious deep in the money call volumes often proceed big price increases. This is suggests that this illegal trick is used as a last resort. So easy to see even by eye looking at options change when shorts go desperate. They go deep. Keep calls. Yes, I agree with using options even just to offset the potential margin requirements and stuff that they would have from the shorts. But here's one of the problems I see with this is that again, if we're assuming that the shorts are able to see a head of these really big moves and then they're using options ahead of these known big moves, my guess is the shorts would do one of two things. They would either just close the shorts and then reopen them. Their basis is not sensitive in that way. Or they might just wade through the perceived short squeeze and size the trade so that they can withstand what they would again preemptively be thinking is going to happen in front of these big moves. So this is really tricky because you can see volume and you can see options activity in general expand ahead of big moves. And part of it, I think 100% is likely due to some of this activity for sure. But I also think a lot of it is people speculating things get active progressively. And we can pick up on those artifacts in the options chain. That's exactly and I've told you guys this a million times. This is exactly how I found game stop when I started as a content creator is because I happened to have caught it on a few different scans. I traded it and then I made a couple videos about the stuff going on because it was interesting. And then obviously that now is me reading a fucking 800 page DD library on Saturday night with everybody. It's not a funny how shit progresses. But me detecting some options volume is what originally drew me into this most recently. We see that SI decreased massively after all the suspicious call activity and late Jan as well as getting FDD under controls. And here's the other problems that there's other ways that they can kick these FDDs around. So yeah, I'm sure that once the FDDs get to an extreme that they're probably moving. Mary puts reverse conversions abuse the stuff. Yep, we read this. Where's Melvin capital at today? That's a lot of put without any GME shares or calls. They had six million shares and puts. Meebling had two million. Okay. So big short losers have no shares. Large put positions. Okay. Melvin takes the biggest prize six million shares here are the main offenders. This is this is a solid DD. I like this one a lot. They have a lot of they have a lot of really good information. In gorge war chests, I'm assuming that was war chest or shire, but it got cut off. I have no idea the GME price. It depends on what your little grapes are telling you. I don't know if it's like cherries or grapes, but I'm not yeah, whatever value that they give you in your tummy. That's probably the correct value. By the way, great to see you as per usual. How can bonafide market maker privileges be used? Yeah, so we just read all this. Again, this is the cool part is we read all this firsthand. Yeah. Okay. That's a solid DD. So a couple things I picked up from that that I think really are pertinent specifically are the use of options to perpetuate FTDs. And I think the relationship between FTDs and deep in the money call trading activity is reported by them is definitely interesting. I think that it's multivariate. It can't be broken down to just those variables unfortunately, but overall, I think that it's still really, really decent information. This seems like it's going to be, yeah, this is kind of what I was expecting. Let's go through these conclusions. All right. Okay. Hedge funds are indeed deep in a hole have not covered in our trading high volumes and dark pools and attempt to kick the can down the roll. All this explains the low volume. And the OTC data post user shows institutions involved at these dark pools do in fact, home shares of GME they are trading over 100,000 shares they own. I don't understand this conclusion. First I said GME is one of the hardest stocks to short right now, but the reason the bar rate is so low is because there's almost zero demand. The part that I don't understand this can all be right the fact that hedge funds are deep in a hole have not covered that I can all see. But this is the part that I don't understand is trading high volumes and dark pools in an attempt to kick the can. I don't understand the relationship that they're making here with the volume in dark pools and how that kicks the can. If you guys know the answer to that I would love to know. I just don't understand that one. GME isn't insanely hard to bar right now. A very little demand to short it. Dark pool activity helps us further explain the FDD cycle. Why do we see these spikes in price and volume every 35-ish calendar days? They've been talking about these cycles for years now. SEC regulation forced them to cover but why does it keep happening? They'll make it shorting. Why else there would be this much potency activity? I agree with that. I think the other thing to at least highlight from something like this without a doubt is there's other shit that happens into the 35 calendar day cycle. There's also standard options, explorations and movement of the underlying that's going to feed into this. But I absolutely agree with this. They're going to naturally just continue to move things down down the road. So yeah, I think that that's a completely fair point. RRTD says that effects price discovery, especially when 80-90% of the trades are in the dark pool. Yeah, no, no, I don't just agree with that. The part that I'm saying that I don't understand is I don't understand how the dark pool volume kicks the can down the road. I understand what dark pools are, how dark pools obfuscate things. And the other thing just to keep in mind is like dark pool trades still hit the tape. I feel like that's something that a lot of people don't understand. There's just a delay and it's not that long, typically. So dark pool trades absolutely do not help price discovery. But it also eventually, typically pretty shortly thereafter, is integrated into the consolidated tape. The stuff that really fucks price discovery is internalization. That butchers price discovery holistically because that stuff will not hit a consolidated tape. So to me, it's interesting that dark pools, it's probably because the name, the name sounds so much more nefarious than it actually is. But dark pools are visible to everybody. It's just a slightly delayed reporting structure and it is combined with the consolidated tape. Most of the buys go to the dark pool and the cells go to the market. Yeah, but I still understand that because they both will be integrated into the consolidated tape. So I don't see how high volumes in dark pools kicks the proverbial can of open shorts down the road. Like that, I just don't get. Where Inclity says volume can hide FTDs. If you buy and sell, you can settle the old FTDs so they can do this in the dark pools. That I totally get. That makes sense. Thank you. That's a perfectly rational description. So the idea is that not necessarily the fact that it's dark pools, but that they're transacting to satiate the requirement and then they're subsequently unwinding to maintain the original position. Where Inclity says because they do shady shit in the dark pools, spoofing for example, spoofing is not relegated to the dark pools. Spoofing happens all the time on on broad markets. And that's more of a high frequency trading thing. So dark pools themselves are no more prone to something like spoofing them anything else, but on a standard brokerage platform, you're going to see spoofs all the time. That's just a game played between high frequency traders and market makers. What DC says visibility doesn't really matter here though. It's about the average retail traders thinking they're buying shares in a company, but it's actually getting FTD. That's kind of different. Like those are two different things. The function of a retail trader buying something is different than the FTD function that's happening. In my opinion, the big issue with the FTD function is that it is artificially going to suppress price. And the way that it artificially suppresses price is because these otherwise entities would be forced to go and purchase the shares to satisfy the short, which increases demand drives price up. So the fact that that is not happening in the shorts are being maintained. That is a massive problem. Warren Clity says, have you read anything about Dr. Trimbath? I think I did. She has a ton of good info on all the issue work for the DC upcrypt, the DRS process wrote a book about FTD's naked trinity. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I watched an interview with her. But yeah, your description for this is completely satisfactory. It makes a ton of sense. OTC data adds credence to the idea that FTD cycle is getting more and more expensive. Shortening the positions rapidly passes. I don't disagree with that. They purposely side on themselves and are waiting for proposed regulatory rules to take effect. So the squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system. The courts are using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly, yes. So this would make sense by rapidly trading. The thing that makes this work is not the fact again that it's dark pools to suppress. This is just the conclusions here, a little misleading to me because this is the function rapidly trading between each other. That absolutely would do it. FTD cycle is persistent, exemplifies naked trinity problem as Dr. Trimbath discussed, which you guys already highlighted. February rise with as a result of forced coverings, January drop, these still have large positions. Funds are working in tandem because they're both into deep and it's futile and just delaying the inevitable activity on GME containing ETFs to demonstrate how desperate they are getting. Yep, I think we've seen that. Because the other thing that I don't know if it was known at this point in time in here, but one of the things that was really, really interesting is the ETF creation redemption cycle. Because that's also literally like a glitch to satisfy FTDs. And that's another massive, massively abused process as far as I'm concerned. Super interesting. I like this one. Cool. It is about time for me to hop off, but before we do that, is there anything else that we should take a look at? I'm down to take a peek at anything else real fast. I need to add my note for where we left off, which is here. Stop point point 7Ds. Post. But God our spot where we're going to pick back up from. All right, let me see what you guys have. Unvaxmas says, do you believe in synthetic shares in hidden short interest? Yeah, definitely. 100%. Synthetic shares are used all the time and synthetic shares are a really cost-effective way for them to do things. That's actually what that other thing we were reading earlier that I posted in the chat is all about. So 100%. It's not even like, do I believe in it? It's like straight up proven. It's factual. The hidden high-short interest, I absolutely have suspicions that it's a thing. It's harder for me to prove it, but I absolutely think it's a thing. So that one is a little bit larger of a leap of speculation on my end because I can't discreetly prove it like I can some of this synthetic process, but I absolutely think it's occurring. I also think anytime that you have a company that is over 100% shorted, which we absolutely have seen, is fucking crazy. Like that's just fucking crazy. Rantini says, synthetic shares are counterfeit shares unless you're a market maker. I think that's a little bit too big of a leap personally because retail traders can use synthetic shares. There's like, there's genuinely used cases for them. You can create synthetic long, synthetic shorts. It's a viable strategy. Now, to your point, which I fully agree with, I don't want to demonize synthetics because synthetics, there's nothing inherently wrong with them. The problem with synthetics in the context of market making is complete in utter bullshit. It's literally being used to hide and defer FTDs. So the problem in that process in my opinion is not synthetics, but it's the FTD process in the deferral. And synthetics happen to be a vector that they've exposed that they can do it through. And again, in my opinion, like that's complete madness. That is complete fucking madness. But it's a fucking unfortunate thing as it is, I suppose. Yeah. WTDC says trade should be settled. We've had the tech do that for over a decade, but it is in profitable market plumbing like hedge funds, market makers brokerages completely agree with that. And I also think that it's fucking crazy that and this is in un like it is the absolute problem when you have an entire market structure system that is solely cared about liquidity. Like that being the primary focus is a massive problem because it contorts what policy goes into effect that then enable liquidity and sometimes liquidity should dry the fuck up in a natural process as it should. So I completely agree with that as well. Rointitie says they're selling shit. They don't own and didn't borrow. So again, synthetics can be done different ways. So I just I would caution you against demonizing synthetics because say, for example, as soon as you're integrating options, you still are taking on a liability depending on what you build. The problem that I have with them is that they're doing it in the context of trying to cover a position that they have not covered. Like that's utter and complete bullshit. It literally is bullshit, especially from an entity like market makers, they should literally be forced to satisfy those positions because it's the only way that you can maintain legitimacy of the system. So yeah, I completely agree with that element of the point. I just don't think synthetics are the I don't think synthetics are the demon here. I think the problem is the way that they're being used is complete bullshit. All right, gang. Awesome. Hang in out. As per always, if you guys need anything, hit me up. Be an outlier. I'll see y'all later.
