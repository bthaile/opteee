0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  you
150.00s:  you
180.00s:  really
210.00s:  that the video does not become copyright infringed.
212.72s:  The main issue with that is they literally can pull the whole video down.
215.72s:  It's not just that it gets demonetized.
217.52s:  That's annoying, but that's whatever.
219.48s:  It's that they'll literally pull the video.
222.08s:  So, and T.C. M. King says he leaves sound off.
226.80s:  So no copyright, yep, that's exactly correct.
229.00s:  And then T.C. M. King, news videos like this should be fine.
236.20s:  Yeah, so it's really tricky.
240.12s:  The problem with stuff like this is that it is entirely up to discretion.
246.04s:  So big other larger entities get a little bit more of a pass than smaller entities like
253.44s:  me because smaller entities like me are more likely to use somebody else's brand or information
262.28s:  to grow our own brand.
264.40s:  It's obviously not what I'm doing at all, but that's the angle.
268.28s:  Whereas larger entities, they typically add audience into the sphere.
273.16s:  So, they get a much bigger pass.
275.72s:  Fun fact, I was actually really, really surprised because T.C. M. King to your point, one of
284.08s:  the videos that got copyrighted from a live stream and they literally pulled the whole
289.64s:  video down was that video that we talked about the different vaccines.
296.00s:  And after that video, like I went through the section that they flagged and they said
302.64s:  a couple things about it.
304.64s:  And I listened to the section and I realized that it's just kind of like a topic that
308.32s:  is really sensitive to a lot of entities.
313.72s:  And then I was looking at, I was listening to a podcast with Joe Rogan on that was on
318.52s:  YouTube.
320.04s:  And his podcast was actually kind of smashing some of them and that video was still up.
327.36s:  And I'm glad that it is.
328.48s:  I'm not saying that I'm upset that there's a double standard or anything like that.
331.72s:  That's not it at all.
333.32s:  But it does highlight that size, sorry fellas, size does matter.
340.56s:  So it applies in this space very much.
346.08s:  So yeah, that's why I'm super careful about it.
348.84s:  Now for those that are curious about things like fair use, fair use, that's the problem
353.12s:  with fair uses.
354.12s:  It doesn't have a definition.
355.12s:  Fair use is like a very open-ended, laissez-faire thing.
358.32s:  So I am convinced that I could easily play clips of this like if we wanted to listen, right,
368.56s:  we can listen to that just fine.
371.08s:  There's no problem if I play a little bit here and there and then I add some transformative
375.96s:  overlay language on top of it.
378.48s:  But what I do for you guys when I start like the holding room is I just prefer to have
384.20s:  something on in the background for you all to take a look at.
386.92s:  And if it's just playing by itself all the way straight, that's when it becomes much
390.60s:  more problematic.
391.76s:  This is all shit that I don't know anything about, man.
394.60s:  Like I literally, I'm just kind of figuring this all out as I'm floating along on this
397.88s:  space rock and it's very entertaining.
401.36s:  But this, what do you guys think?
406.20s:  Did, did we're in Kitty listen to this?
410.76s:  Like when he was talking about it, out of curiosity.
416.96s:  Because I have no idea what the cat does or does not do.
425.80s:  I am curious because that's what they were just speculating that the cat might have been
428.64s:  listening in.
431.12s:  And so what's the agenda for today?
432.92s:  Well, the agenda is pretty damn, pretty damn simple.
439.92s:  TCM KED says listen to what the news don't know to left because this, they were literally
445.60s:  here.
446.60s:  I'll play the section for you.
447.60s:  Give me a sec.
448.60s:  This section right here.
449.60s:  Listen.
450.60s:  I'm going to have a page if you will.
452.32s:  It clearly hasn't started.
453.76s:  Maybe he's listening to our interview now.
457.08s:  Maybe he's hearing you cast doubt on him, on the trading, the company itself.
464.20s:  I mean, if you could speak directly to him, what would you say?
467.60s:  What would he say?
468.60s:  What are you thinking about?
471.72s:  So that's the section.
472.72s:  I'm actually curious if you guys think that he was listening to that one.
476.68s:  That's kind of funny.
477.68s:  That would be like a giant, what's the inception moment?
484.60s:  We're like, they're waiting to watch him, but he's watching them.
488.24s:  That's pretty pretty funny.
490.12s:  Lauren says that's not the one where left cries.
493.12s:  Where?
495.12s:  Where is that?
496.12s:  I don't actually think he cries.
497.28s:  I would love to see it.
498.28s:  I just, I've never seen it.
500.52s:  Which one does he actually cry in?
504.60s:  And then for those that don't know tonight, we're adding a easy into the mix.
509.96s:  And it's very good, but it tastes like straight diabetes.
514.48s:  It's like 14 grams of sugar and eight ounces.
518.20s:  It's a shit ton of sugar.
520.52s:  The one he's all red faced is from 2021.
523.28s:  We have to find that one eventually.
525.76s:  I need to see that.
526.76s:  That's just so damn funny.
527.76s:  If there's like a whole grown ass man crying about this, I, yeah, I have to see that.
534.80s:  All right.
535.80s:  I'll know what time it is, man.
537.92s:  It's time to get to work.
539.92s:  We got some, we got some stuff to do.
543.80s:  While I'm getting this gend up, we do need to update our map.
552.12s:  Do we have any new map ads?
554.16s:  So if you're new listening in and you've not popped on these before, I like to add where
563.12s:  people are dialing in from or people are listening in from so that we can see just how
567.72s:  expansive this whole thing is.
569.96s:  We officially had somebody from Greenland, which is pretty fucking sick, I think.
574.20s:  And we have the US is a shotgun blast.
577.88s:  South America looks quiet.
579.76s:  Africa still blank.
580.76s:  But in fact, my good friends actually go into Africa.
583.52s:  So I might have to have him dial into one of these live streams at a obscene time so that
590.60s:  I can at least put a little pin on the map in good faith.
594.52s:  We got Australia.
595.52s:  I think there was somebody that said they were from New Zealand, there's New Zealand.
598.60s:  So we have good coverage.
599.64s:  So if you've not let me know where you're from, throw it in the chat at any point.
604.32s:  And I can update this as we go.
606.60s:  All right.
607.60s:  So let's start with a quick recap of GameStop.
610.68s:  I talked a little bit about it on Thursday.
614.08s:  And then we did a live stream Thursday.
615.80s:  So I just want to talk specifically about the close.
618.80s:  We have a couple of events coming up pretty soon.
621.44s:  This thing shows delayed data.
622.96s:  So this might not load anything if it's going through an update phase, which it looks
627.12s:  like is exactly what it's doing.
629.68s:  Give me one sec.
630.68s:  I'll dump you guys on the spare screen real fast.
633.64s:  I'll close this down and see if I can reopen it back up.
636.92s:  If not, I can just use something like trading viewer or whatever.
639.28s:  Well, I can't it literally won't even close.
641.88s:  There goes.
643.48s:  That was super weird.
645.08s:  All right.
646.08s:  Let me log back in.
648.44s:  Scott says Massachusetts.
650.32s:  Well, while I think her swim is loading, let's see.
654.60s:  Yeah, it looks like we have Massachusetts.
656.40s:  Where are Massachusetts are you?
657.92s:  What city?
659.64s:  We can we can wrap your city on the map.
668.24s:  Right now, think her swim is just installing updates.
670.12s:  I don't know if it's going to actually work or not.
672.64s:  We'll give it a couple seconds.
674.20s:  Framing ham.
677.84s:  Well, it's different than what I would have expected.
681.12s:  That's very different than what I expected.
683.76s:  OK, so it's just West of Boston.
685.56s:  My my really good friend, he went to Northeastern.
688.52s:  So I spent I spent several a drunken night stumbling around Boston.
697.16s:  Oh, that's funny.
697.76s:  And I typically would take like the 95 and or something.
701.88s:  A CDJ says you have my amy.
703.60s:  We could take a look my amy.
708.84s:  We don't.
711.08s:  We had Florida, like just general Florida,
713.32s:  but we didn't have.
716.40s:  We didn't have my amy.
717.32s:  OK, so I don't know if think her swim is just down for me
720.08s:  or not.
720.60s:  We'll pivot away from it.
721.92s:  We'll just use trading view or something.
724.04s:  I'll leave it on in the in the background.
727.88s:  While it's trying to get its life together,
731.24s:  we don't really need it.
732.28s:  I wanted to use it for some charting
734.76s:  and for some options analysis, which we can kind of talk about it
740.92s:  anyways.
742.84s:  Does trading view have options?
744.20s:  That would be kind of cool.
747.32s:  Can you look at options on trading view?
754.72s:  You know, trading views not opening either.
756.48s:  What the fuck is happening right now?
760.16s:  This is madness.
762.20s:  Zach says isn't left in prison.
763.88s:  No, he deferred his case.
765.60s:  I want to save for his trial isn't until next year now.
769.68s:  It's not until like October of next year.
772.64s:  All right, so trading view.
776.08s:  My internet might be going down because I don't know what's
778.28s:  happened right now.
779.36s:  I can't literally I am like gridlocked.
781.44s:  I can't do shit.
783.68s:  There it goes.
784.28s:  OK, so trading view just loaded.
785.48s:  Damn.
787.36s:  I'm not going to lie.
789.72s:  I don't see all they do have options.
791.16s:  This is great.
791.84s:  So we could just use trading view and plastic.
795.96s:  All right, so let's grab this map over here now.
799.36s:  We'll just let think or swim continue to ground on the background
803.40s:  until it gets its act together.
805.68s:  Move you guys over here.
806.60s:  In case you're wondering above my head here, this is Iceland.
810.76s:  This is one of the glacial slides that we cruised up on.
814.48s:  This is from my drone.
816.76s:  Game stop.
819.76s:  There we go.
820.76s:  The joke is they're trying to keep me down as I'm trying to look
825.24s:  at this stuff.
826.24s:  Sometimes joking aside, it can feel like that.
828.44s:  Obviously it's not what's actually happening, but it makes me feel
832.20s:  generally annoyed.
833.20s:  All right, so let's see what I've never looked at options in here
836.56s:  before.
837.56s:  Oh, Lord.
838.56s:  This is a.
841.56s:  Oh, they have a surface which is kind of nice.
844.76s:  I mean, I don't know if we're going to be able to do much with this
859.20s:  guys.
860.20s:  This is pretty rough.
862.64s:  I can't see like, oh, I can't see shit.
867.72s:  I can't see shit in here.
869.88s:  All right, let's just take a look at the chart.
871.88s:  We'll just go to a chart.
878.88s:  All right.
885.24s:  Great week.
886.84s:  Great week for GameStop.
888.80s:  So GameStop.
891.12s:  It landed up ever so slightly.
898.84s:  Here's what I saw.
901.16s:  This obviously was highly anomalous when the cat chose to post.
907.44s:  That sent things in a fervor and we talked about that.
910.36s:  I literally made a video about that specifically because of genuinely how topical I think it
918.60s:  kind of is because it definitely beyond the shadow of a doubt highlights the fact that
926.32s:  there are algorithms specifically stalking when he posts.
931.44s:  Like that is it.
933.16s:  You guys know that I do my absolute best to be as objective as humanly possible and
939.00s:  unless there's something that I'm very confident in, I won't call it straight.
942.88s:  I would always caveat things as like I could be wrong and I can be wrong about this to
947.32s:  be very clear.
948.32s:  I'm no fucking pressian omnipotent being.
951.28s:  There's no like heroes in this story.
953.76s:  This is all of us just trying to figure it out as we go.
957.20s:  But with something like this, I feel very confident to say that the price action that we saw
964.08s:  when he posted to me made it very, very clear that there are algorithms stalking and trying
972.60s:  to front run his posts and the expected impact of his posts.
979.76s:  And I mean, right, wrong and different doesn't really matter what I think, but what does
985.72s:  matter is that's also a highly tradable effect.
990.80s:  And it's objectively a tradable effect.
992.76s:  It's actually something that is not too difficult to catch as it's happening.
998.44s:  You just to be very fast.
1000.60s:  But if we go into can we do like a one minute, one second chart would be Ella intense.
1011.16s:  We need to go here.
1019.32s:  So you can see at 1045 when the cat dropped his nuts on the table via a nondescript meme
1029.40s:  with no text and no specific information about anything, obviously would send game stop
1035.92s:  flying.
1037.56s:  And this volume jacked over this one minute candle.
1043.64s:  And then it subsequently drifted over a little bit of time.
1047.76s:  This actually begs the question since this can go even shorter.
1050.48s:  Let's go to like 30 seconds.
1055.44s:  I can't go to 30 seconds because I have the peasant version of this.
1059.44s:  Maybe somebody that has the paid version of this.
1063.52s:  To take a look in terms of seconds, that would actually be kind of neat to see.
1067.24s:  And then I got a pop the door for Thorke is not just got home, he's losing his mind.
1074.88s:  All right.
1084.00s:  That says what do you think back to back days, the 1045 minute candles 24 hours apart?
1091.88s:  What do you mean?
1099.88s:  1045 here or you mean the day after?
1105.40s:  1445.
1106.40s:  I don't see anything sticking out to me there.
1109.52s:  I see here.
1113.52s:  I.
1135.40s:  Okay.
1141.12s:  So initial thoughts is I don't fucking know.
1149.76s:  That's very strange.
1151.36s:  Now there are and the reason why I went silent for a second is because part of what I do when
1157.48s:  I'm trying to analyze something that I can't necessarily identify in effect very quickly
1163.72s:  is I start to think of it in terms of probabilities.
1169.60s:  And I think of it in terms of different styles of explanations.
1173.84s:  So in this case, what I was doing is I was looking at all the different times around
1178.44s:  it to see if there's anything even close.
1183.04s:  And I don't see that.
1185.00s:  Now the other thing to note is this had a clear catalyst.
1192.00s:  This did not as far as we can see.
1199.08s:  And it also had, yeah, that's like a massive spike in volume.
1204.48s:  My guess it has something to do with like a 24 hour holding thing.
1208.60s:  I don't know why, but that would be my that would be my best guess.
1212.24s:  I don't know why the volume itself.
1216.48s:  Oh, interesting.
1217.48s:  It looks like think or swim is still having issues.
1222.32s:  Turning on our other people able to get on to think or swim at a curiosity because mine
1228.16s:  just gave me like a proxy error.
1229.96s:  I don't actually seen those see those two frequently.
1236.60s:  But T seems as some thumb thumb.
1239.84s:  It could be.
1242.04s:  Let's take a look at what fuck I wish I could get on the damn platform so I could look
1246.04s:  at stuff.
1247.04s:  Let's take a look at 1045.
1249.04s:  We can look at unusual wheels and see what we can find in there.
1253.40s:  Let me grab unusual wheels.
1263.12s:  It's under it's down for maintenance until 12 a.m.
1265.60s:  I hate it when they do this.
1268.00s:  I do so much of my work when the market is closed.
1277.04s:  That is so annoying.
1279.32s:  They need to.
1281.52s:  Lauren says what is some thumb thumb?
1283.64s:  That's the thing that Roy and Kitty put up this thing.
1288.76s:  This thing.
1291.24s:  This is from I forgot what movie you guys will know all of this stuff.
1295.36s:  I literally don't remember the movie name.
1297.32s:  I've watched some of it.
1298.32s:  I didn't get through.
1299.32s:  Oh, dude, that's it.
1300.48s:  I didn't get through all of it.
1305.64s:  Oh, yeah, you put in like this little thing in the ground.
1307.72s:  It pulls the sand worm and then he has to like hook on to it to go for a ride with these
1312.28s:  little baby graphing hooks.
1314.20s:  That doesn't even really make sense to me.
1315.88s:  It's like I feel like to get on a worm that size.
1318.12s:  You need some fucking pikes of grappling hooks like those little baby grappling hooks ain't
1323.20s:  going to do it.
1324.20s:  You need like two pickaxes.
1326.24s:  Maybe pickaxi would be the name.
1328.56s:  You really feel like you got to be on there.
1334.96s:  And is this, is he supposed to be able to steer it?
1337.20s:  Is that the idea?
1341.92s:  He's standing, but can he steer it?
1353.04s:  Was he steering it or just riding it?
1354.92s:  Because I feel like if you're trying to steer it by pulling them little lines, man, that's
1362.68s:  a big ass worm.
1364.00s:  You would need a big old hook in order to get that thing to move.
1370.84s:  That worm probably doesn't even know you're on there.
1373.60s:  Big ass worm.
1374.60s:  It reminds me of tremors.
1376.52s:  You guys ever see tremors?
1378.12s:  That was a fantastic movie.
1379.68s:  I love that one.
1383.40s:  Big, big fan, but that's what thumb, thumb, thumb is.
1386.60s:  So there's an idea that the cat is doing something on the back end to cause disruption
1393.56s:  or movements for hedge funds and whatnot, like the larger institutions, which I do think
1401.56s:  that there could be some corollary there, but let's take a look.
1407.80s:  So let's go, let's say objective about it for now.
1411.20s:  You know we can grab the tinfoil hat.
1412.64s:  I still have the fucking tinfoil hat.
1414.40s:  It sits there right there.
1415.40s:  I'm a printer.
1416.40s:  So we can get into tinfoil, but I really try to keep my feelings and thoughts about
1422.96s:  stuff aside and look at stuff objectively for you all so that you can then decide what
1428.52s:  you think.
1429.52s:  So let's go here.
1431.24s:  Let's go to what was it?
1432.24s:  So Thursday's when he posted so was it Friday?
1435.80s:  Wait, was that Friday?
1439.40s:  I don't think we need this one.
1452.96s:  It was Friday.
1461.88s:  The other trick here is this could be something to do with, um, pop-ax.
1467.80s:  I don't know what, but let's see.
1481.92s:  When I do like a specific time, I can do a specific time.
1488.84s:  And I want to do it from 10, 40, 2, 10, 50.
1509.36s:  No, no big, no big dark pull trades.
1517.52s:  That's actually kind of interesting.
1519.52s:  I would have expected, I would have absolutely expected to see more movement there.
1539.36s:  Oh, fuck isn't giving me these weird-ass times, bro.
1546.36s:  I could just want, want the whole time.
1557.60s:  I guess this would leave a day off.
1565.76s:  Let's know that you can't just easily update those times.
1571.84s:  Let's do a pipe.
1575.84s:  Two, four, fuck.
1577.84s:  Yeah, nothing, nothing crazy there.
1581.16s:  And I know from an options perspective, there wasn't anything that stuck out to me.
1585.40s:  I don't think it's that.
1588.40s:  Yeah.
1589.40s:  I don't think it was that.
1594.68s:  So this, man, that's very curious.
1602.68s:  Let's go back, let's find another previous Friday.
1624.68s:  Friday November 29th.
1631.68s:  Wait, why does this?
1634.68s:  Is it a half day?
1637.68s:  We got to go back more.
1652.68s:  Friday, the 24th.
1659.68s:  Oh, interesting.
1664.40s:  What is this spike?
1666.68s:  57, 45, nothing.
1672.68s:  Okay.
1673.68s:  So that's probably just chasing ghosts.
1675.28s:  I could do a broader statistical analysis on intra-day.
1682.52s:  But I kind of want to do it.
1685.72s:  I don't want to waste your guys' time, but I kind of want to do it.
1693.68s:  Because what I would like to do is grab intra-day minute level data from GameStop.
1699.96s:  And I can go back like at least the past month.
1702.44s:  And I can look at the number of instances where GameStop has higher than average intra-day
1711.20s:  volume at 1045.
1713.92s:  The problem is there's not a ton we learn from it.
1718.18s:  But it's just kind of like a non-curiosity that I have.
1723.20s:  Let me do it real quick.
1725.80s:  It's not going to take me that long.
1726.80s:  I actually can probably get GPT or something like that to do this.
1731.28s:  So let me grab GME.
1735.72s:  And then let's go to historical data.
1740.24s:  And then we need minute level.
1745.40s:  We can do 15 minutes.
1746.40s:  That'll be a lot easier.
1748.92s:  15 minutes.
1751.40s:  And then we'll see how far back.
1755.88s:  Maximum 20,000 records.
1757.12s:  So it's not going to be able to go back very far.
1758.64s:  But that's okay.
1759.64s:  I'm just going to try to make it go back a couple months.
1761.48s:  I won't go back that far though.
1762.96s:  That's not good.
1764.96s:  All right.
1768.08s:  And let's see what we have here.
1772.80s:  Where does this go back to?
1776.20s:  Yeah, OK.
1776.68s:  So it goes back a couple months.
1778.92s:  This is fine.
1780.40s:  So what I'm going to do now is just kind of clean this a little bit
1783.84s:  so that we can dump this into PetruPT.
1789.28s:  So this looks OK.
1790.32s:  Save that.
1791.84s:  Kill it.
1794.84s:  Save that.
1796.76s:  I think I said, you're just safe, bro.
1800.80s:  What the?
1802.48s:  My tripping.
1803.64s:  This looks like I'm hitting safe.
1810.00s:  What the fuck?
1812.00s:  Dude, it's the weirdest things whenever I'm doing shit
1814.36s:  for this fucking stock.
1816.72s:  I'm telling you, every fucking.
1820.40s:  It's always something weird.
1823.12s:  All right.
1826.36s:  And then for this, we want to use GPT.
1831.44s:  Let's grab this.
1833.16s:  I'm going to see.
1834.32s:  I want to see first if that's saved.
1836.84s:  So if it didn't save, then GPT typically has an issue with it.
1843.12s:  Oops, didn't mean to do that.
1845.84s:  It didn't save it.
1847.56s:  Is it the fucking hater?
1848.96s:  Can you please save?
1853.04s:  I think it saved.
1854.04s:  OK, great.
1854.64s:  Now it's saved.
1855.80s:  Maybe I just had to ask nicely instead of insulting it.
1858.48s:  It's almost like there might be something to that.
1861.44s:  OK, so now I'm going to have it analyze plot the average plot
1875.20s:  of volume at 1045 to 1100 against the one day average.
1894.56s:  Let's do it against the average 15-minute volume for the same day.
1905.76s:  Identify the dates where there is anomalous volume at 1045,
1918.84s:  exceeding the average 15-minute volume by at least 2x.
1928.80s:  Do that says.
1931.16s:  I'm curious how well this will work for me.
1943.80s:  Little C. In the meantime, I'm going to keep eyeballing a little bit.
1959.96s:  OK.
1960.28s:  So it has a handful of instances.
1966.64s:  This is interesting.
1971.36s:  This is very interesting.
1972.36s:  So let's go to November 7.
1977.24s:  I'm going to change this to 15 minutes.
1979.08s:  So it's easier to navigate 15 minutes.
1985.64s:  And let's go to November 7.
1996.36s:  And there's one other thing I'm going to look at.
2003.60s:  I mean, the volume doubled there, but that doesn't.
2006.12s:  It's not that crazy.
2007.52s:  OK, so now what I want to do is create a plot.
2014.72s:  To identify the three most common 15-minute periods where volume expands at least.
2029.92s:  What do you want to look at?
2031.20s:  What is this?
2035.28s:  How do you view the volume on this other?
2036.72s:  It is OK.
2039.04s:  Volume is 720, 740.
2045.20s:  So at least 2x from the intro day, 15-minute average, proceeding.
2058.12s:  OK, so to run down what I just found from the original looking at 1045, there are a few days that 1045 had anomalous volume.
2068.32s:  More than I would have expected, honestly, in a relatively short sample, it was at least five instances,
2073.92s:  six instances.
2075.52s:  So there's probably something from a programmatic standpoint when things are set to go.
2084.64s:  Now what I'm doing is I'm trying to identify, and it's exactly what I would expect.
2089.04s:  So the three most common 15-minute periods with volume expansion is 0,930.
2093.76s:  It's exactly what you would expect 1545 exactly what you would expect.
2097.28s:  And then 0,945, which is not what you would expect necessarily.
2101.16s:  So this seems generally in line with expectations.
2108.36s:  So what that tells me from this movement that we saw over the last couple days,
2113.32s:  we would need to see more of it is what it summarizes to.
2117.40s:  Like I wouldn't feel comfortable saying that without a doubt, there's something going on here,
2126.52s:  like at the 1045 handle, because it's just two data points.
2135.16s:  It's weird.
2136.76s:  And in the world of data analysis, a lot of times what we do is we find things that are weird.
2141.96s:  And then we pay close attention to them because we want to know if it's something that's persistent,
2147.16s:  if there's something behind it for some reason.
2149.80s:  But I do think there's something potentially behind that time frame.
2157.16s:  I just don't know what.
2158.92s:  But that's also not a bizarre time frame for transaction activity to start picking up.
2163.56s:  We're getting into like the last trading couple hours of the day.
2173.08s:  Volume will often expand during that time frame.
2179.72s:  So yeah, interesting.
2185.48s:  But not totally anomalous.
2189.96s:  Because again, one of the reasons why I wanted to see how many instances did we see volume for
2197.48s:  the 1045 candle expanding the average 15 minute volume by at least two times.
2203.80s:  And it happened quite a few times.
2206.60s:  I see six instances where it was way more than that.
2211.08s:  And quite a few more instances where it at least occurred.
2214.92s:  So yeah, I don't necessarily see anything jumping out at me there.
2220.20s:  But very interesting.
2221.88s:  What I find most interesting to zoom this out and to talk about the chart from,
2227.48s:  I wish I had think her swim up because it has all my shit.
2229.88s:  It feels like I'm in like a foreign house right now.
2232.44s:  It feels like I'm in somebody else's office trying to do my work.
2235.96s:  It's just not the same vibe.
2237.48s:  But I mean, we'll make it happen.
2239.80s:  The main thing is I have a few price levels that I think are really relevant and interesting.
2245.96s:  So we can see one of them creating a bit of a floor here.
2253.16s:  We can see blue.
2256.28s:  Why the fuck would it be blue?
2257.80s:  Blue is terrible.
2260.12s:  It needs to be like gold or something, something cool.
2263.32s:  Blue.
2264.12s:  I know we got time for blue.
2266.68s:  Stop that immediately.
2272.52s:  Blue is trash.
2275.32s:  Absolutely trash.
2285.32s:  The line is as thin as possible.
2287.88s:  It's good.
2289.88s:  Okay.
2291.48s:  So we can see price is clearly picking levels, which is again, really, really nice to see.
2300.36s:  I would love to throw a volume profile on this, but I don't think I can because, again,
2306.12s:  I have the peasant version and I think that you only get like two indicators.
2310.36s:  Oh, I could take the, I forgot.
2311.72s:  I have RSI on here.
2313.00s:  We could drop the RSI really fast.
2315.40s:  And then we can add volume profile if it has it.
2317.88s:  That would be cool.
2320.04s:  I don't really care about RSI here.
2321.96s:  Indicators volume profile.
2328.68s:  What the fuck?
2331.00s:  Auto anchored.
2332.36s:  That sounds right.
2340.36s:  Most important price points and volume levels depending on the chart current time frames.
2343.80s:  Yeah, that's right.
2345.72s:  We want that.
2346.60s:  That damn it.
2351.88s:  Why can't I use this?
2355.88s:  Yo, these guys are haters.
2359.00s:  You can't put shit on his chart without buying it.
2363.00s:  Bastards.
2365.00s:  What's this thing do?
2367.72s:  That's not the same, but that would be fine if I can use this.
2373.88s:  Yeah, fine. Whatever.
2375.08s:  This is whoever made, whoever made this thing, I appreciate your effort.
2379.72s:  It is not at all what I want.
2383.00s:  This is.
2387.32s:  Poe Vey.
2389.88s:  Never mind, gang.
2390.92s:  Let's just get rid of that.
2392.76s:  And let's.
2398.44s:  Dust to dust to search VRVP.
2400.92s:  Let's see.
2403.80s:  VRVP.
2405.88s:  Visible range volume proof.
2410.20s:  Yeah, this is closer.
2411.32s:  Still not what I want, but.
2413.16s:  Big.
2413.72s:  God.
2415.64s:  Damn it.
2416.44s:  Trating you.
2419.40s:  These guys are haters.
2423.40s:  I only have one indicator.
2424.84s:  They won't even let your boy get a second indicator on the four free.
2431.00s:  You got to buy some shit.
2433.24s:  Damn it.
2433.72s:  Think her swim.
2434.84s:  Think her swim needs to be up right now.
2436.36s:  All right, well, this is this is what we're relegated to is we we can have RSI, which is great, I guess.
2448.60s:  Beautiful for us.
2450.76s:  What I wanted to see are there's a handful of price levels here that I think are really,
2455.64s:  really relevant. And we can't see them right now, but they're there.
2461.08s:  And what I'm noticing is prices consolidating pretty well.
2465.32s:  And I want to drive that point home because since prices consolidating pretty well,
2470.76s:  I find that to be really positive.
2473.64s:  And I find it to be so positive, even though it was a little bit of a down day, a couple
2477.88s:  down days, I find it to be positive because this is like literally the assumption of more normal
2486.28s:  price activity. And I just think that's good for trading view.
2491.48s:  Like I don't see a scenario where that's negative for trading view here or trading view for GameStop.
2499.08s:  I don't know why I would say trading view right now. I wouldn't say that I don't like them as much
2503.16s:  as Robin Hood because I still like their stuff. I would just love it if they would let me get a
2508.52s:  second indicator on the chart for fucking free. I'm not asking for more than two, but you know,
2515.48s:  beggars cannot be choosers. We only get these. So if you guys can though in the background,
2521.80s:  if you can keep trying thinkorswim because it might pop up while we're on here, I'll keep
2527.16s:  running it up once in a while and see, wait a minute, the web platform,
2533.80s:  the web platform, thinkorswim has a web platform.
2540.20s:  Fuck that one's down to.
2542.52s:  I really thought I outsmarted them there. I really thought I had them going, but I didn't
2548.04s:  damn it. We tried. All right, let's get into, let's get into this.
2559.08s:  Dusty, dusty, dusty, you don't like trading view. I think trading view is fine. I don't use
2562.60s:  them. I use them obviously as like a backup, but you could tell how clujee me getting around
2569.32s:  and it is. So yeah, like I typically just use thinkorswim because thinkorswim is completely fine
2575.40s:  and does everything I need. But trading views like the only one I've used so far as like a backup.
2586.60s:  So from that perspective, it's good. All right, so I remember this now. We have a way to find
2595.16s:  Bingo. See, look how efficient we're getting here. We know we're leaving off.
2601.48s:  Let us get in.
2607.96s:  I think we did this. Okay. So it looks good. That Paul Revere has been definitely a staunch
2617.24s:  supporter of GameStop going back to his famous ride in the middle of the night, letting everybody
2624.60s:  know first that the British were coming and he's also letting us know that the attendees are coming,
2628.68s:  which is great. It's always good to have like really prolific figures a part of the journey
2634.92s:  and a part of the path here. So big fan.
2640.92s:  And let us now see what this person, oh, I forgot. I remember don't worry. I remembered our
2650.60s:  cheat code to get through this. And again, if there's any one of these that I'm supposed to go
2655.96s:  slower on, let me know. And then I'm more than happy to dive into the ones that look really
2661.88s:  interesting. What I'm doing now is I'm just grabbing the text. I'm going to dump it into chat
2668.52s:  GPT in this case perplexity and then use chat GPT's engine to summarize. Well, I actually
2673.64s:  probably use perplexity or clogged. I think then that clogged. I'll probably use perplexity for this.
2678.12s:  Perplexity is pretty good at this kind of stuff. And I'm going to have it summarize for us what
2684.36s:  this is talking about. The point is to get to the big level details quickly because this document
2692.60s:  is absolutely massive. It's over 800 pages. And this isn't even the whole DD library. This is
2697.56s:  literally like an amalgamation of DD at one point in the library. We still have like straight
2704.28s:  up the whole library to go through. I didn't realize what I was signing up for when I said that we're
2707.88s:  going to go through this DD library. But I also, I'm one of those people that once I start doing
2714.44s:  something, I'm going to fucking finish it. So this could take me into next year eat. Well,
2719.00s:  it's definitely going to take me into next year. I don't know if it'll take me through next year.
2722.52s:  That would be kind of nuts. We'll see. I don't fucking know. But if it does, it does so be it.
2728.60s:  You boys here for the you boys here for the ride. And then I was texting with Newton a little bit.
2738.84s:  I need to get like a bunch of information from him on like a leave off period for what he's thinking
2748.28s:  will be really pertinent going forward. Because I want to try to help track some of those things
2753.48s:  just so that people can monitor some of the same metrics because I know he's doing stuff like
2758.52s:  the swaps and whatnot. But yeah. Okay, here's the TL TLDR at the bottom. So another thing is
2772.36s:  the TLDR being at the bottom is just a vicious move. Normally those would be more towards the top.
2779.88s:  So you know, I've got to feel some type of way about this. Okay, so summarize, summarize this
2788.76s:  and dump this whole thing in.
2794.04s:  TCM King says I would be interested in seeing you skip and go over when the river runs dry,
2798.12s:  more options focus. Oh, I'll definitely get there. But part of the reason of me doing this is for
2803.08s:  my own education and benefit. So I am a significant, significant
2811.24s:  proponent of getting to base level data by ourselves individually on your own.
2816.36s:  That's why I do this on live streams with you all is because this is exactly what I would be doing
2820.28s:  anyways. The difference is I just live stream doing it so that you all can hopefully find some more
2825.96s:  first layer information for yourselves as well. I just think that's so important to get to first
2831.08s:  hand level information because it's all of us have played the game of telephone. And the problem
2839.08s:  with telephone is as you go through three, four, five, six people, the message is fucking completely
2844.28s:  different than what you started. You could be like, Ayo, the attendees are coming and then at the end,
2850.12s:  it'll be like, yo, I want to make gang bang. It just be completely fucking different than what you
2854.68s:  started as. And it's not due to anybody necessarily trying to be lame. It's due to the passage of
2861.08s:  information and it changes over time naturally. So I am a really significant supporter of first
2870.28s:  level, first contact information. So that's exactly what I'm doing here. All right.
2876.28s:  That's not it. That's not it at all. So this got all fucked up.
2887.40s:  Summarize this post. It went back to the data analysis so I think I needed to start like a new thread.
2895.08s:  Okay, here we go.
2895.88s:  And then I'll move this over so that you guys can see it too.
2911.40s:  This can go like that without the platform, I actually don't know how wide the screen is. So
2918.36s:  you guys will have to let me know I'm assuming this will be completely off your screen.
2925.40s:  How far can you see? You could see to there. Yeah, okay. So it looks like this.
2935.32s:  This will work. Great.
2938.68s:  Does the dust is happy to hear he's not stopping his stream. He's inspirational. Oh, is he not?
2949.48s:  That's great if he's not. I hope he's not. I haven't talked to him about. I literally didn't
2953.88s:  even know that he was stopping. I don't watch all of his videos. That's literally just because I
2958.92s:  don't really watch anybody stuff. But I'll try to catch some of his stuff sometimes or I'll ask him
2964.12s:  some messages like we'll text back and forth. But you guys are the ones that told me that he was
2968.36s:  talking about stopping. So if he has now decided not to, that would be fantastic. I would love that.
2979.72s:  Okay, so this is what it says.
2983.00s:  April 2020 GameStop price bottomed under two COVID-19 impacts, shorting, triple to six.
2989.80s:  So this just looks like it's talking about.
2998.44s:  This looks like it's just talking about like the price path of it.
3008.20s:  Dusty Dust says he said to him in his video. That's awesome. That's great news.
3011.80s:  That's just a win across the board. Did he say what made him change his mind?
3015.48s:  I'm just gonna text him. I'm really curious.
3019.96s:  Okay.
3031.16s:  Okay. So, what is this?
3036.20s:  Most argues that GME's leadership likely supports a share recall.
3040.52s:  Okay. Well, that didn't happen.
3049.56s:  See, this is the kind of thing I am genuinely kind of happy that we can skip through some of it
3054.44s:  because if the ultimate thesis turns out to be something that's just not what happened.
3066.04s:  Is this another post that I did I go too far?
3070.60s:  Fuck. I'm lost now. Hold on. Nope. Didn't mean to do that.
3076.92s:  I meant this.
3085.80s:  Okay. So this is the next post. I just want to read their TLDR.
3094.20s:  Activists in the Lester, large vote, short interest over 100%.
3100.28s:  Jimmy does a share recall ahead of his meeting. Okay. Yes. So it just didn't happen.
3105.16s:  Okay. Good enough.
3118.20s:  T.C. M. King says I get that. I think there's just too much and a lot of it. It's just the same.
3122.20s:  Yeah. There definitely is a lot. There ain't too much dog.
3125.48s:  You guys don't understand. Well, maybe you do. Maybe you don't.
3129.56s:  But literally the world of a trader is sifting through massive amounts of information,
3138.52s:  quickly trying to decipher as much as you possibly can and then making decisions off of it.
3145.32s:  So for me, this really isn't that much work. And here's the cool part. If I'm not mistaken,
3153.24s:  built in AI assistant, it needs the stuff just to be less than I think it said 400 pages,
3159.32s:  which we're coming up on that. So what I'll do is I'm literally going to split this PDF
3165.08s:  into two different PDFs so that then we can use the native AI, which I think will be much quicker.
3173.80s:  That's my that's my ultimate game plan. If not, you're just going to see your fucking boy doing a lot
3178.92s:  of fucking reading. All right. Let's see what this says.
3182.92s:  So this we can clear this had this summarized this next talk.
3197.96s:  Nope. That's the wrong one. That is the wrong one.
3213.72s:  I
3215.72s:  summarize the second piece.
3221.80s:  Well, let's see if it can do this. I have I have faith.
3229.56s:  Maybe I don't fucking have faith. I've lost all faith. We have to do another thread.
3234.92s:  Summarize this. There's got to be a better way to do that though. You guys,
3242.44s:  you guys know how to fucking get it. Maybe I need to name the sources. That could be it.
3249.80s:  Spectative analysis, game stop, potential future events, could trigger short squeeze again. So
3254.44s:  this we can kind of flip through a bit. Yep. So co-in joining all that stuff.
3265.48s:  Okay.
3274.84s:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3281.32s:  Lead to a significant price move in a game stop technical indicators potential cattle. Yeah. So
3285.64s:  this is again to I think this was to dust to dust point very much the same as kind of the last one.
3294.84s:  The next one, the naked shorting scam in numbers. I think we can comfortably move through this one
3303.40s:  pretty quickly because I feel most of us are appraised. Does this have a TLDR in it?
3312.44s:  Maybe I'll just scan through it super fast. This one I feel like we have a pretty good grasp on
3318.44s:  at this point. Why would it go to 101? That's so frustrating. 100 is great. Thanks.
3325.80s:  All right. Let's flip through this. Oh, here we go. Hold. Okay. Great.
3330.76s:  Built an AI deep in the money calls to create naked shares. Yep.
3336.04s:  So one of the things to note as I look at this is I don't think you can make this claim.
3348.04s:  Like I and I'm actually very curious how they're going to make this claim.
3355.00s:  Deep in the money call covering seems to be the last resort of illegal desperation. It's so easy to
3361.16s:  spot. Okay. Investigated, Mary put naked shorting at the Jan mini squeeze open interest. The
3368.92s:  creation of millions of naked shares with married put trades. Put volumes appear to be sustained at
3373.88s:  higher levels to keep rolling over. I don't agree with this conclusion outright. Up to 400 million
3381.48s:  naked shares created in total. Look through 13 F filings. Here we go. Clear idea who's on which
3388.76s:  side of the battle. Okay. Dark pool data from Finra, which we have access to massive changes in
3396.76s:  trade behavior since Jan huge increases in shares traded, but each trade is of a few shares. Okay.
3403.24s:  All right. Let's see what it says. Yeah. Let's do this deep in the money call thing. I'm really
3412.20s:  curious about this. Want to share sold short without being owned or borrowed. It is sold naked. Yep.
3422.04s:  Can happen as part of normal market activity. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. We know all this.
3430.68s:  They can resolve the FDs without actually covering is through locates. Yes.
3437.48s:  Deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately to acquire the shares and close FDs.
3444.92s:  Let's take a look at this.
3460.44s:  That have been observed. Appeared to circumvent certain requirements of reg show. Okay.
3466.36s:  Hard to borrow securities can be subject to pricing disparity relative to options trading on
3470.44s:  the same security makes it ton of sense. Typically they may be seen in synthetic positions trading
3475.00s:  at lower price than the underlying security that creates an arbitrage. Yep. This is exactly
3478.60s:  yep. This creates a potential of profit. Yep. For short sellers of the underlying security.
3483.88s:  If they can avoid the high cost to typically associated with obtaining for delivery, that's right.
3490.36s:  Risk alerts highlights observed trading strategies that can be designed to circumvent certain
3494.44s:  requirements of reg show among other things. Reg show requires fail to deliver positions resulting
3500.20s:  from short sale transactions to be closed out by a specific date either by borrowing or purchasing
3505.16s:  securities of a like kind. Yes. Okay. Reg show.
3513.88s:  No.
3518.68s:  Trading strategies could be used to impression purchasing by the short seller of satisfied closed
3523.24s:  out requirements of the clearing firm of the broker dealer. Okay.
3528.44s:  Reality. The purchase shares in a position are oftentimes not delivered because of subsequent
3532.92s:  options trading used to reestablish or otherwise extend the broker to release fail position
3539.16s:  without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose such that the clearing firm broker dealer
3547.96s:  allocated a fail to deliver position does not satisfy was that requirement. Okay. Yep.
3553.80s:  Same page so far. As I'm going through this, if you guys have any questions, let me know. This
3559.80s:  makes this this looks completely great forward to me. The locate requirement which we know
3568.68s:  purposes for market maker, must also be a market maker security being sold yes, yes. Okay.
3576.60s:  Provides that it constitutes a manipulative or deceptive device or
3580.12s:  and try vans. Fuck yeah. Look at that fucking word. Contribence. I don't know what y'all know about.
3585.64s:  I don't know what you guys know about anything, but I'm here trying to talk about some contrivance.
3591.16s:  I'm here also trying to order some dinner. What do you guys think is for dinner tonight?
3595.48s:  The steak last night was good. I'm almost I'm almost tempted to kind of run it back, but
3603.08s:  I'm not set on it. Honestly, maybe
3611.80s:  Ian says burgers. I could do a burger. I was thinking maybe Chinese.
3615.56s:  Chinese sometimes like really, really scratches an itch.
3627.24s:  Might be Chinese, yeah.
3631.80s:  Burgers is another definitely another potential.
3636.68s:  I don't really know what leaks are, but that's kind of a I like the name leaks.
3648.92s:  I've had leaks before. I don't really know what they are. I like them.
3654.36s:  Dan Dan noodles, sardines and crackers. I do like sardines on a Caesar salad.
3661.64s:  If you can get a nice sardine on a Caesar salad that is on fleek, I think we're going Mexican because
3667.48s:  it's fast. Leaks are like green onions. Oh, interesting. Yeah, anytime I have them, I don't really
3676.04s:  recall like a bunch of flavor from them. I just kind of know that I eat them.
3681.96s:  Perfect. All right. I'm going to wait for Mel to turn down that because I know she's not going to
3686.12s:  want it, but I have to send a tour out of just being thoughtful.
3692.44s:  Rowing to these is cashew chicken. Oh, you mean from Chinese? I'm like a chicken
3696.92s:  with broccoli. Chicken with broccoli is good or sesame chicken. If it's like spicy, you could
3701.64s:  put a little spice in there. That's pretty good. Yep. So she's passing on this. I'm going to ask her
3707.56s:  up pennies. See if she wants that instead. All right. Let's get back into this while she's
3716.52s:  sorting her life out. Okay. Bye, right. Here we go. Simultaneous sale of calls with the purchase
3725.64s:  of equivalent amount of shares underlying. So this is a really, really common. This is a really
3731.56s:  common strategy for larger style funds and things like that or people that are trading for income.
3738.60s:  I was actually just going to open up the thinkorswim platform to show you the risk profile of it.
3744.84s:  And obviously I cannot do that. So what I can do is draw a perfect Mel would do Chinese. So
3754.84s:  we're going to audible it and we are going to roll with Chinese. Every once in a while, I just have
3760.68s:  to like row a random other thing by her. And every once in a while, it'll connect. And it looks
3767.16s:  like we we got it tonight, which is great. Do you guys like like a PF Changs kind of Chinese or
3778.20s:  like a local Chinese place? I like the local stuff way better. Signature domain that looks good.
3790.68s:  Sesame chicken that is 100% happening. We don't need any extras with that.
3803.16s:  And then I think we need chicken with broccoli.
3811.08s:  Perfect. Local New York has the best. Yeah, New York has really, really good Chinese food. That's
3817.64s:  one thing I do miss about New York in general is New York is kind of like a melting pot for all
3823.64s:  different kinds of foods. And there are a lot of really, really good foods there. I'm a massive fan.
3833.64s:  Okay, so let me draw this for you. Does everybody know what a buy right is? Because if you do,
3839.24s:  then I can skip over this. But if you don't, then I can draw it out super fast.
3843.16s:  You guys can let me know what you're what you're leaning is.
3853.16s:  Willie says need. Okay, so Joe doesn't that's totally cool. As long as we have one know,
3858.04s:  then it's worth the time. So let me grab this. We'll do this, this, and this. So you guys should be
3866.12s:  able to. Perfect. So here's a buy right. I can buy it open 100 shares of GameStop.
3879.72s:  And the risk profile for this, are you guys familiar with what a risk profile is?
3885.88s:  Risk profile just plots the PNL of something. So this is a zero line. This is your negative return.
3895.00s:  This is positive return. And then this is stock price. This is stock at zero, which is today right now.
3904.84s:  And then this is stock as it goes up. And then this is stock as it goes down.
3916.04s:  So when you buy 100 shares at spot price, it'll look something like not that, that, right?
3924.76s:  So what this does is it means as GameStop goes up, you make money as it goes down, you lose money.
3931.48s:  I think everybody's pretty comfortable and familiar with that. Now, a buy right is when we do this
3936.60s:  first trade, and then we pair it with the second trade, which is when we sell to open one.
3942.92s:  And then it can be whatever strike call. So X call at $1 or whatever the price is.
3951.40s:  So what this means is we're going to collect a $100 credit upfront.
3955.16s:  And then our new risk profile will look like this.
3963.40s:  So rather than having unlimited upside potential like you see here,
3969.08s:  the other trade would look like this. This one takes this departure.
3975.72s:  And it's because you're collecting money upfront on the call.
3979.56s:  So a lot of people do this when they are getting into stocks that they really like,
3984.12s:  that they want a hold, that they don't mind holding. And it's a way to collect a little bit of a
3990.04s:  premium literally while you're getting into something that you want to be in anyways. So there's
3996.12s:  no love lost on buying the shares selling the call against it. That's the idea behind it.
4007.32s:  Byrates associated with the activity at issue employee deep in the money calls.
4012.44s:  A married put is the simultaneous purchase of a put and purchase of equivalent amount of shares
4017.16s:  in the underlying. So a married put by comparison is this back to the risk profile that you all
4029.56s:  are experts on now. This is price. Again, this is the zero line. And what a married put is designed
4038.12s:  to do is you buy to open 100 shares. And then you buy to open one X strike put at whatever a dollar.
4054.60s:  So in this case, you're going to pay $100. But what this does is if you remember the first line,
4065.24s:  this here is stock at zero. This is what long stock looks like. When we look at the buy right,
4076.92s:  it looks like this. Let me use a different color. Buy right will look like this.
4088.68s:  And then a married put will instead look like this.
4096.12s:  So won't go past the zero line. So this is the difference. This is what a buy right will look like.
4105.96s:  If I were to extrapolate it out by itself, it would be like this.
4118.84s:  And the purpose of this is you limit your downside. So this means if GameStop goes down to zero,
4127.00s:  your max loss is capped here. And it looks great, right? Like why wouldn't everybody do this?
4134.44s:  Well, most people don't do it because it's really expensive to buy the puts. It's really,
4140.04s:  really expensive on a relative level. So that's what those two look like in conjunction with one
4148.44s:  another. So now let's take a look at the rest of this because I'm actually really curious what it
4156.28s:  thinks the the total connection is. I've not seen the description through this yet. I'm not
4167.24s:  looking through this whole thing. Joe says, okay, I do know what I do know what buying to open
4179.56s:  covered calls and so on. I didn't know it was a buy right. It's just called a buy right.
4185.08s:  And it's not right as in right or left. It's right as in writing. Like you're writing an option.
4191.00s:  That's an old way of saying selling an option. People don't really use that anymore writing an
4197.40s:  option, but that's an old way of saying selling an option. You write an option. So that's why it's
4202.92s:  called a buy right because of just older school language. Okay. When associated with the activity
4213.32s:  issue, my inputs typically employ deep in the money puts. Flex options are exchange level options
4220.76s:  that have non-standard customizable contract terms. The main features of flex options compare to
4225.88s:  standard traded options or the ability to specify strike price and expiration date. Yep.
4231.48s:  Price at the market. Pull call parity. Yes. And that X. Yes.
4237.00s:  Here we go. Periodically, security's become hard to borrow and where the large and persistent
4243.32s:  fails to deliver in a security end up threshold security list. These situations give rise to
4248.44s:  pricing differentials and the options of these securities and the pull call parity equation may
4251.96s:  appear out of balance, which is in part a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities.
4257.64s:  When the shares become hard to borrow, the synthetic position typically trades at a price that are
4261.80s:  less than the actual shares. This reflects the risk that shares cannot be borrowed and will have
4266.60s:  to be bought in compliance with the right show closeout requirements. In the extreme, these price
4271.48s:  differences can be quite large creating profit, potential profit opportunities and certain
4276.44s:  options trading strategies for those who are able to short the underlying equity securities
4279.88s:  without paying the high cost typically associated with obtaining delivery hard to borrow security.
4283.32s:  That result short. Yep. Makes total sense. I dig all of this. This is really like, I think they
4290.92s:  did a good job outlining this because it's super, super clear. One strategy could be designed to
4297.08s:  get manage of potential profit opportunities. Rowing, Rowing, what up, Rowing, Titty? Rowing, Titty says
4303.56s:  Rob Kitty, who logs up on 125's every expiration. Kitty is the decent master. That's funny. I highly doubt
4311.16s:  it, but it could be and they would be fucking hilarious. But yeah, I severely doubt that it's him.
4321.16s:  Why am I getting added to these fucking WhatsApp groups, dude?
4325.96s:  WhatsApp is super annoying.
4327.96s:  Tribi says maybe that's what they were doing with those massive 125 puts. Do you mean 125
4334.92s:  puts or calls? Because I most people are typically talking about the super far out of the money
4341.72s:  calls, which is generally just unit building. I'm not sure about the put scenario that you're
4350.68s:  referring to, but we could take a look at it. All right. Activity, most often,
4360.68s:  number broker dearers who claim to rely on the exceptional locate requirement for options market
4365.24s:  makers, options market makers claim they can enter into the short stock position without first.
4371.48s:  Locating the shares to borrow because it's part of a bona fide market making activity.
4375.24s:  Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an
4379.24s:  exemption or exception to the locate to comply with right. So the options market maker still must
4384.28s:  deliver in shares in settlement or if in a field of deliver position results in a clearing firm
4390.36s:  that failed to deliver must be closed out in accordance with right. So maybe a violation. Yeah.
4399.48s:  Where the market maker does not deliver shares and engages in second subsequent
4403.00s:  insurance actions in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firms' obligations
4407.24s:  to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting field of settlement. That's
4411.80s:  fascinating. In addition, we're a clearing firm subject to close out requirements purchases
4416.68s:  or borrow securities applicable close out. Yeah. All right. So they're talking about building
4428.84s:  a synthetic long.
4433.64s:  Assuming XYZ is hard to borrow trader A or its broker dealers unwilling to borrow shares to
4439.64s:  make delivery on the short sale of actual shares. It may result in FTD rather than paying the
4445.32s:  borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position. They may enter into a
4449.88s:  trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the close out requirements. But in reality allows
4453.72s:  trader A to maintain the short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often this
4457.88s:  is done through the use of buy right, but may also be done as merit put interesting.
4463.80s:  It's a commonly referred to as reset transactions. They have the effect of reset in the time that a
4467.80s:  broker dealer must purchase or borrow. Yep. And we know that this is happening. And this is one of the
4474.60s:  this is one of the main issues because we look at this. We know that this is happening. And we also
4482.04s:  know that to the degree that this is happening, there's nothing that technically can stop it unless
4487.08s:  it's regulated out because you can just perpetuate the position. That's the whole point of it.
4498.04s:  Rointitys says are there even 125 puts? Yeah. Well, if there is 125 call, I would pull it up on
4504.52s:  the platform. But if there's 125 calls, there would be 125 puts. They are side by side with one
4513.64s:  another and an options chain. So very interesting. I'll drop this in here for you all to take a look
4520.68s:  at at your leisure. But I like that one. That was interesting. I think we can close that.
4527.32s:  Let's see where we're at in this thing. Look, look at this. We're literally halfway through the
4533.08s:  third row. Clock in hell. This is a big project we started.
4544.44s:  Funds have FDDs outstanding required. I won't go into all the details, but points you towards
4548.92s:  God tier DD. Okay. Well, gotta look at God tier DD. Okay. Can't look at God tier DD. One way
4559.48s:  naked short can resolve. Deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately. Yep.
4580.12s:  140 million FDDs being hidden since January.
4584.20s:  A detection of option volumes used to hide FDD values. Let me see.
4592.60s:  So I see the point that he's making. Yeah. So I like the this I agree with totally suspicious
4601.80s:  deep in the money call volumes. I completely agree with this as suspicious and definitely correlated
4608.52s:  to a degree completely agree with that. But the problem with these kinds of things when we're
4614.04s:  conducting this style of analysis is there's a lot. There is a lot of stuff going on. And when we
4621.24s:  start to see FDD starting to skyrocket, there's typically other things going on in the underlying
4626.76s:  at that point in time. So thus the problem here is we're looking at two in discrete variables
4635.00s:  discreetly. There's other stuff at play when we're looking at this and then we're trying to
4640.04s:  design a causal relationship that may or may not be there. So I completely agree on the suspicious
4646.52s:  element of this. I and I 100% agree with that. But I think that we can't make the leap that we're
4654.36s:  saying this is that it's evidence that there's 140 million FDDs being hidden because FDDs happen
4664.52s:  to coincide with call activity because we can see that FDDs also skyrocket here. And then there's
4670.44s:  really no significant rise in the call activity. So same thing here. So as a causal relationship,
4679.64s:  I don't know if it gets that. Now when things get to an extreme like this, which looks like during
4687.00s:  the 2021 move, it's no surprise that you would see everything start to get out of whack at that point.
4694.52s:  So it's not to say that there's nothing behind this. I completely agree. But I just I think that
4699.48s:  you can't make a causal relationship a definitive causal relationship. We can speculate we can say
4703.88s:  that this is suspicious. We can say that we think that this is tied. We can say that we think this
4707.96s:  is going on. But I think that's different than saying something like this. And again, this is the
4718.92s:  the nature of how I analyze things is I'm very reluctant to discreetly decide Yeh or Nay or
4726.44s:  to qualify something as something until I have a really rigorous analysis behind it. And this is
4733.16s:  just missing a couple pieces. So I think this is on the right track. I think it's looking at a
4737.56s:  clear problem completely agree with all that. But I don't think that it necessarily leads to the
4745.40s:  discreet conclusion that they're coming with. Here we see that suspicious deep in the money call
4752.20s:  volumes often proceed big price increases. This is suggests that this illegal trick is used as
4756.60s:  the last resort. So easy to see even by eye looking at options change when shorts go desperate, they
4760.28s:  go deep deep calls. Yes, I agree with using options, even just to offset the potential
4774.52s:  margin requirements and stuff that they would have from the shorts. But here's one of the problems
4780.60s:  I see with this is that again, if we're assuming that the shorts are able to see
4789.00s:  you know ahead of these really big moves and then they're using options ahead of these
4793.24s:  known big moves. My guess is the shorts would do one of two things. They would either just close
4798.60s:  the shorts and then reopen them. Their basis is not sensitive in that way. Or they might
4808.28s:  they might just wade through the perceived short squeeze and size the trades that they can
4815.96s:  withstand what they would again preemptively be thinking is going to happen in front of these
4819.72s:  big moves. So this is really tricky because you can see volume and you can see options activity
4830.20s:  in general expand ahead of big moves. And part of it, I think 100% is likely due to some of this
4838.36s:  activity for sure. But I also think a lot of it is people speculating things get active progressively.
4846.92s:  And we can we can pick up on those artifacts in the options chain. That's exactly and I've told
4854.20s:  you guys this a million times. This is exactly how I found GameStop when I started as a content creator
4860.76s:  is because I happened to have caught it on a few different scans. I traded it and then I made a
4866.44s:  couple videos about the stuff going on because it was interesting. And then obviously that now is
4871.64s:  me reading a fucking 800 page DD library on Saturday night with everybody. It's kind of funny how
4877.08s:  ship progresses. But me detecting some options volume is what originally drew me into this most
4884.76s:  recently. We see that SI decreased massively after all the suspicious call activity in late
4891.48s:  Jan as well as getting FDD under controls. And here's the other problems that there's other ways
4895.64s:  that they can kick these FDDs around. So yeah, I'm sure that once the FDDs get to an extreme that
4900.44s:  they're probably moving. Married puts reverse conversions abuse is thought, yep, we read this.
4917.72s:  Where's Melvin capital at today? That's a lot of put without any GME shares or calls. He had six
4925.80s:  million shares and puts. Meebling had two million.
4940.76s:  Okay.
4945.48s:  So big short losers have no shares. Large put positions. Okay.
4956.12s:  Melvin takes the biggest prize six million shares here are the main offenders. Okay.
4966.28s:  This is this is a solid DD. I like this one a lot. They have a lot of.
4975.24s:  They have a lot of really good information. In gorge war chests, I'm assuming that was war
4981.48s:  chest or shire, but it got cut off. I have no idea the GME price. It depends on what your
4994.12s:  little grapes are telling you. I don't know if it's like cherries or grapes, but I'm not,
5001.00s:  yeah, whatever value that they give you in your tummy, that's probably the correct value.
5007.24s:  By the way, great to see you as per usual.
5011.48s:  How can bonafide market maker privileges be used? Yeah. So we just read all this. Again,
5018.92s:  this is the cool part is we read all this firsthand. Yeah.
5028.60s:  Okay. That's a solid DD. So a couple things I picked up from that that I think really are
5046.28s:  pertinent specifically are the use of options to perpetuate FTDs. And I think the relationship
5056.44s:  between FTDs and deep in the money call trading activity is reported by them is definitely
5062.84s:  interesting. I think that it's multivariate. It can't be broken down to just those variables
5069.48s:  unfortunately, but overall, I think that it's still really, really decent information.
5074.60s:  This seems like it's going to be, yeah, this is kind of what I was expecting.
5093.16s:  Let's go through these conclusions. All right.
5098.04s:  Okay. Hedge funds are indeed deep in a hole have not covered in our trading high volumes
5104.52s:  and dark pools and attempt to kick the can down the roll. All this explains the low volume.
5111.32s:  And the OTC data post user shows institutions involved at these dark pools do in fact,
5116.28s:  home shares of GME, they're trading over 100,000 shares they own.
5122.28s:  I don't understand this conclusion.
5124.68s:  First I said GME is one of the hardest stocks to short right now, but the reason the bar rate
5130.84s:  is so low is because there's almost zero demand. The part that I don't understand this can all be,
5138.68s:  right? The fact that hedge funds are deep in a hole have not covered that I can all see.
5143.08s:  But this is the part that I don't understand is trading high volumes in dark pools in an
5149.24s:  attempt to kick the can. I don't understand the relationship that they're making here
5154.36s:  with the volume in dark pools and how that kicks the can. If you guys know the answer to that,
5159.40s:  I would love to know. I just don't understand that one. GME is insanely hard to bar right now,
5165.88s:  a very little demand to short it. Dark pool activity helps us further explain the FDD cycle.
5175.96s:  Why do we see these spikes in price and volume every 35-ish calendar days?
5180.36s:  They've been talking about these cycles for years now.
5190.52s:  SEC regulation forced them to cover, but why does it keep happening?
5195.24s:  They'll make it shorting. Why else there would be this much potency activity?
5199.32s:  I agree with that. I think the other thing to
5207.64s:  at least highlight from something like this without a doubt is there's other shit that happens
5213.56s:  into the 35 calendar day cycle, right? There's also standard options,
5217.48s:  explorations and movement of the underlying that's going to feed into this.
5221.00s:  But I absolutely agree with this. They're going to naturally just continue to move things down
5226.92s:  down the road. So yeah, I think that that's a completely fair point.
5232.28s:  RRTD says that effects price discovery, especially when 80-90% of the trades are in the dark pool.
5237.80s:  Yeah, no, no, I don't just agree with that. The part that I'm saying that I don't understand
5242.20s:  is I don't understand how the dark pool volume kicks the can down the road. I understand
5248.44s:  what dark pools are, how dark pools obfuscate things. And the other thing just to keep in mind is like
5254.36s:  dark pool trades still hit the tape. I feel like that's something that a lot of people don't
5258.92s:  understand. There's just a delay and it's not that long, typically. So dark pool
5265.16s:  trades absolutely do not help price discovery, but it also eventually,
5271.16s:  typically pretty shortly thereafter, is integrated into the consolidated tape.
5275.48s:  The stuff that really fucks price discovery is internalization. That
5281.72s:  butchers price discovery holistically because that stuff will not hit a consolidated tape.
5287.64s:  So to me, it's interesting that dark pools, it's probably because the name, the name sounds so
5292.92s:  much more nefarious than it actually is, but dark pools are visible to everybody. It's just a
5299.08s:  slightly delayed reporting structure and it is combined with the consolidated tape.
5304.04s:  Most of the buys go to the dark pool and the cells go to the market. Yeah, but I still
5313.16s:  understand that because they both will be integrated into the consolidated tape.
5317.96s:  So I don't see how high volumes in dark pools kicks the proverbial
5326.12s:  can of open shorts down the road. Like that, I just don't get.
5331.16s:  Where Inclity says volume can hide FTDs. If you buy and sell, you can settle the old FTDs so they
5336.76s:  can do this in the dark pools. That I totally get. That makes sense. Thank you. That's a perfectly
5343.48s:  rational description. So the idea is that not necessarily the fact that it's dark pools,
5349.80s:  but that they're transacting to satiate the requirement and then they're subsequently unwinding
5356.12s:  to maintain the original position.
5360.12s:  Where Inclity says because they do shady shit in the dark pool, spoofing for example,
5363.40s:  spoofing is not relegated to the dark pool. Spoofing happens all the time on on broad markets.
5368.44s:  And that's more of a high frequency trading thing. So dark pools themselves are no more prone to
5374.68s:  something like spoofing them anything else, but on a standard brokerage platform, you're going
5379.00s:  to see spoofs all the time. That's just a game played between high frequency traders and market
5385.32s:  makers. What DC says visibility doesn't really matter here though. It's about the average retail
5395.64s:  traders thinking they're buying shares in a company, but it's actually getting FTD.
5401.16s:  That's kind of different. Like those are two different things. The function of a retail
5406.76s:  trader buying something is different than the FTD function that's happening. In my opinion,
5412.28s:  the big issue with the FTD function is that it is artificially going to suppress price.
5418.04s:  And the way that it artificially suppresses price is because these otherwise entities would
5424.52s:  be forced to go and purchase the shares to satisfy the short, which increases demand drives price
5431.32s:  up. So the fact that that is not happening in the shorts are being maintained. That is a massive
5438.28s:  problem.
5442.44s:  Warren Clity says, have you read anything about Dr. Trimbath? I think I did. She has a ton of good
5447.88s:  info on all the issue work for the DC upcrypt, the DRS process wrote a book about FTD's
5451.96s:  naked trinity. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I watched an interview with her. But yeah, your description
5456.68s:  for this is completely satisfactory. It makes a ton of sense.
5462.12s:  OTC data adds credence to the idea that FTD cycle is getting more and more expensive.
5465.96s:  Short short term, increasing the positions rapidly. I don't disagree with that. They
5469.80s:  purposely sit on themselves and are waiting for proposed regulatory rules to take effect. So the
5473.56s:  squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system.
5477.08s:  Short short term using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly. Yes.
5483.08s:  So this would make sense by rapidly trading.
5485.40s:  The thing that makes this work is not the fact, again, that it's dark pools to suppress.
5489.72s:  This is just the conclusions here are a little misleading to me because this is the function
5498.20s:  rapidly trading between each other.
5500.84s:  That absolutely would do it.
5503.84s:  FDD cycle is persistent, exemplifies the Neutrality Problem as Dr. Trimbath discussed, which
5511.16s:  you guys already highlighted.
5516.32s:  Very rise with this results of force coverings, January drop, these still have large positions.
5523.04s:  Funds are working in tandem because they're both in too deep and it's futile and just
5525.80s:  delaying the inevitable activity on GME containing ETFs to demonstrate how desperate they are
5531.88s:  getting.
5532.88s:  Yep, I think we've seen that.
5536.76s:  Because the other thing that I don't know if it was known at this point in time in here,
5542.24s:  that one of the things that was really, really interesting is the ETF creation redemption
5547.80s:  cycle.
5548.80s:  That's also literally like a glitch to satisfy FDDs.
5554.44s:  And that's another massively abused process as far as I'm concerned.
5565.44s:  Super interesting.
5566.44s:  I like this one.
5570.16s:  Cool.
5573.48s:  It is about time for me to hop off.
5576.44s:  But before we do that, is there anything else that we should take a look at?
5579.80s:  I'm down to take a peek at anything else real fast.
5583.00s:  I need to add my note for where we left off, which is here.
5595.28s:  Stop point.
5599.04s:  Seven Ds.
5602.28s:  Post.
5603.28s:  But God our spot where we're going to pick back up from.
5606.88s:  All right, let me see what you guys have.
5609.48s:  Unvaxmas says do you believe in synthetic shares and hidden short interest?
5613.68s:  Yeah, definitely.
5614.68s:  100%.
5615.68s:  Synthetic shares are used all the time and synthetic shares are a really cost effective way for
5620.84s:  them to do things.
5621.84s:  That's actually what that other thing we were reading earlier that I posted in the chat
5624.80s:  is all about.
5626.04s:  So 100%.
5628.04s:  It's not even like do I believe in it?
5629.68s:  It's like straight up proven.
5630.96s:  It's factual.
5633.76s:  The hidden high short interest.
5635.92s:  I absolutely have suspicions that it's a thing.
5640.40s:  It's harder for me to prove it, but I absolutely think it's a thing.
5644.76s:  So that one is a little bit larger of a leak, a leap of speculation on my end because I can't
5653.36s:  just screely prove it like I can some of this synthetic process.
5657.32s:  But I absolutely think it's occurring.
5658.60s:  I also think anytime that you have a company that is over 100% shorted, which we absolutely
5662.96s:  have seen is fucking crazy.
5666.12s:  Like that's just fucking crazy.
5667.84s:  Rantitti says synthetic shares are counterfeit shares unless you're a market maker.
5673.44s:  I think that's a little bit too big of a leap personally because retail traders can
5679.04s:  use synthetic shares.
5680.04s:  There's like there's genuinely use cases for them.
5683.84s:  You can create synthetic long synthetic shorts.
5686.60s:  Like it's a viable strategy.
5688.48s:  Now to your point, which I fully agree with, I'm just, I don't want to demonize synthetics
5693.80s:  because synthetics, there's nothing inherently wrong with them.
5697.28s:  The problem with synthetics in the context of market making is complete and utter bullshit.
5702.76s:  It's literally being used to hide and defer FTDVs.
5707.44s:  The problem in that process in my opinion is not synthetics, but it's the FTD process
5713.00s:  and the deferral.
5715.08s:  And synthetics happen to be a vector that they've exposed that they can do it through.
5719.96s:  And again, in my opinion, like that's complete madness.
5722.76s:  That is complete fucking madness.
5725.72s:  But it's a fucking unfortunate thing as it is, I suppose.
5731.64s:  Yeah.
5734.28s:  WTDC says trade should be settled.
5739.08s:  We've had the tech do that for over a decade, but it is in profitable market plumbing,
5742.60s:  like hedge funds, market makers, brokerages completely agree with that.
5745.68s:  And I also think that it's fucking crazy that and this is in on like it is the absolute
5753.56s:  problem when you have an entire market structure system that is solely cared about liquidity.
5759.68s:  Like that being the primary focus is a massive problem because it contorts what policy goes
5766.60s:  into effect to then enable liquidity and sometimes liquidity should dry the fuck up in a natural
5774.24s:  process as it should.
5776.36s:  So I completely agree with that as well.
5779.76s:  Rointitie says they're selling shit.
5783.96s:  They don't own and didn't borrow.
5787.76s:  Again, synthetics can be done different ways.
5793.24s:  So I just I would caution you against demonizing synthetics because say, for example, as soon
5798.36s:  as you're integrating options, you still are taking on a liability depending on what you
5804.96s:  build.
5805.96s:  The problem that I have with them is that they're doing it in the context of trying to cover
5813.12s:  a position that they have not covered.
5815.52s:  Like that's utter and complete bullshit.
5817.40s:  It literally is bullshit, especially from an entity like market makers, they should literally
5822.44s:  be forced to satisfy those positions because it's the only way that you can maintain legitimacy
5828.96s:  of the system.
5830.44s:  So yeah, I completely agree with that element of the point.
5833.00s:  I just don't think synthetics are the I don't think synthetics are the demon here.
5838.40s:  I think the problem is the way that they're being used is complete bullshit.
5844.08s:  So.
5845.08s:  All right, gang.
5847.88s:  Awesome.
5848.88s:  Hanging out as per always, if you guys need anything, hit me up.
5851.32s:  Be an outlier.
5852.32s:  I'll see y'all later.
