0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you
210.00s: that the video does not become copyright infringed.
212.72s: The main issue with that is they literally can pull the whole video down.
215.72s: It's not just that it gets demonetized.
217.52s: That's annoying, but that's whatever.
219.48s: It's that they'll literally pull the video.
222.08s: So, and T.C. M. King says he leaves sound off.
226.80s: So no copyright, yep, that's exactly correct.
229.00s: And then T.C. M. King, news videos like this should be fine.
236.20s: Yeah, so it's really tricky.
240.12s: The problem with stuff like this is that it is entirely up to discretion.
246.04s: So big other larger entities get a little bit more of a pass than smaller entities like
253.44s: me because smaller entities like me are more likely to use somebody else's brand or information
262.28s: to grow our own brand.
264.40s: It's obviously not what I'm doing at all, but that's the angle.
268.28s: Whereas larger entities, they typically add audience into the sphere.
273.16s: So they get a much bigger pass.
275.72s: Fun fact, I was actually really, really surprised because T.C. M. King to your point, one of
284.08s: the videos that got copyrighted on from a live stream and they literally pulled the whole
289.64s: video down was that video that we talked about the different vaccines.
296.00s: And after that video, like I went through the section that they flagged and they said
302.64s: a couple things about it.
304.64s: And I listened to the section and I realized that it's just kind of like a topic that
308.32s: is really sensitive to a lot of entities.
313.72s: And then I was looking at, I was listening to a podcast with Joe Rogan on that was on
318.52s: YouTube.
320.04s: And his podcast was actually kind of smashing some of them and that video was still up.
327.36s: And I'm glad that it is.
328.48s: I'm not saying that I'm upset that there's a double standard or anything like that.
331.72s: That's not it at all.
333.32s: But it does highlight that size, sorry fellas, size does matter.
340.56s: So it applies in this space very much.
346.08s: So yeah, that's why I'm super careful about it.
348.84s: Now for those that are curious about things like fair use, fair use, that's the problem
353.12s: with fair uses.
354.12s: It doesn't have a definition.
355.12s: Fair use is like a very open ended La Zay fair thing.
358.32s: So I am convinced that I could easily play clips of this like if we wanted to listen.
365.24s: Right.
368.56s: We can listen to that just fine.
371.08s: There's no problem if I play a little bit here and there and then I add some transformative
375.96s: overlay language on top of it.
378.48s: But what I do for you guys when I start like the holding room is I just prefer to have
384.20s: something on in the background for you all to take a look at.
386.92s: And if it's just playing by itself all the way straight, that's when it becomes much
390.60s: more problematic.
391.72s: This is all shit that I don't know anything about man.
394.60s: Like I literally I'm just kind of figuring this all out as I'm floating along on this
397.88s: space rock and it's very entertaining.
401.36s: But this, what do you guys think?
406.20s: Did, did we're in Kitty listen to this like when he was talking about it at a curiosity?
416.92s: Because I have no idea what the cat does or does not do.
425.80s: I am curious because that's what they were just speculating that the cat might have been
428.64s: listening in.
431.12s: And so what's the agenda for today?
432.92s: Well, the agenda is pretty damn pretty damn simple.
439.92s: TCM kids says listen to what the news don't know to left because this they were literally
445.60s: here.
446.60s: I'll play the section for you.
447.60s: Give me a sec.
448.60s: This section right here.
449.60s: Listen.
450.60s: Page if you will.
452.32s: It clearly hasn't started.
453.76s: Maybe he's listening to our interview now.
457.08s: Maybe he's hearing you cast doubt on him on the trading, the company itself.
464.20s: I mean, if you could speak directly to him, what would you say?
467.60s: What would he say?
468.60s: What are you thinking about?
471.72s: So that's the section.
472.72s: I'm actually curious if you guys think that he was listening to that one because that's
476.76s: kind of funny.
478.08s: That would be like a giant.
483.08s: What's the inception moment?
484.60s: We're like, they're waiting to watch him, but he's watching them.
488.24s: That's pretty pretty funny.
490.08s: Lauren says that's not the one where left cries.
493.08s: Where?
495.08s: Where is that?
496.08s: I don't actually think he cries.
497.32s: I would love to see it.
498.32s: I just, I've never seen it.
500.52s: Which one does he actually cry in?
504.60s: And then for those that don't know tonight, we're adding a easy into the mix.
509.96s: And it's very good, but it tastes like straight diabetes.
514.48s: It's like 14 grams of sugar and eight ounces.
518.20s: It's a shit ton of sugar.
520.52s: The one he's all red faced is from 2021.
523.28s: We have to find that one eventually.
525.76s: I need to see that.
526.76s: That's just so damn funny.
527.92s: If there's like a whole grown-ass man crying about this, I, yeah, I have to see that.
534.76s: All right.
535.76s: I'll know what time it is, man.
537.92s: It's time to get to work.
539.92s: We got some, we got some stuff to do.
543.76s: While I'm getting this gend up, we do need to update our map.
552.12s: Do we have any new map ads?
554.16s: So if you're new listening in and you've not popped on these before, I like to add where
563.12s: people are dialing in from or people are listening in from so that we can see just how
567.72s: expansive this whole thing is.
569.96s: We officially had somebody from Greenland, which is pretty fucking sick, I think.
574.20s: And we have the US is a shotgun blast.
577.88s: South America looks quiet.
579.76s: Africa still blank.
580.76s: But in fact, my good friend's actually going to Africa.
583.52s: So I might have to have him dial into one of these live streams at a obscene time so that
590.60s: I can at least put a little pin on the map in good faith.
594.52s: We got Australia.
595.52s: I think there was somebody that said they were from New Zealand, there's New Zealand.
598.60s: So we have good coverage.
599.64s: So if you've not let me know where you're from, throw it in the chat at any point.
604.32s: And I can update this as we go.
606.60s: All right.
607.60s: So let's start with a quick recap of GameStop.
610.68s: I talked a little bit about it on Thursday.
614.08s: And then we did a live stream Thursday.
615.80s: So I just want to talk specifically about the close.
618.80s: We have a couple of events coming up pretty soon.
621.44s: This thing shows delayed data.
622.96s: So this might not load anything if it's going through an update phase, which it looks
627.12s: like is exactly what it's doing.
629.68s: Give me one sec.
630.68s: I'll dump you guys on the spare screen real fast.
633.64s: I'll close this down and see if I can reopen it back up.
636.92s: If not, I can just use something like trading viewer or whatever.
639.28s: Well, I can't it literally won't even close.
641.88s: There goes.
643.48s: That was super weird.
645.08s: All right.
646.08s: Let me log back in.
648.44s: Scott says Massachusetts.
650.32s: Well, while I think her swim is loading, let's see.
654.60s: Yeah, it looks like we have Massachusetts.
656.40s: Where are Massachusetts are you?
657.92s: What city?
659.64s: We can we can wrap your city on the map.
668.24s: Right now, think her swim is just installing updates.
670.12s: I don't know if it's going to actually work or not.
672.64s: We'll give it a couple seconds.
674.24s: Framing ham.
677.88s: Oh, it's different than what I would have expected.
681.16s: That's very different than what I expected.
683.80s: OK, so it's just West of Boston.
685.56s: My my really good friend, he went to Northeastern.
688.56s: So I spent I spent several a drunken night stumbling around Boston.
697.20s: Oh, that's funny.
697.80s: And I typically would take like the 95 and or something.
701.96s: CDJ says you have my amy.
703.60s: We could take a look my amy.
708.84s: We don't.
711.08s: We had Florida, like just general Florida,
713.32s: but we didn't have.
716.44s: We didn't have my amy.
717.32s: OK, so I don't know if think her swim is just down for me
720.08s: or not.
720.60s: We'll pivot away from it.
721.92s: We'll just use trading view or something.
724.08s: I'll leave it on in the in the background.
727.88s: While it's trying to get its life together,
731.24s: we don't really need it.
732.28s: I wanted to use it for some charting
734.76s: and for some options analysis, which we can kind of talk about it
740.92s: anyways.
742.84s: Does trading view have options?
744.20s: That would be kind of cool.
747.32s: Can you look at options on trading view?
754.72s: You know, trading views not opening either.
756.48s: What the fuck is happening right now?
760.16s: This is madness.
762.20s: Zach says isn't left in prison.
763.88s: No, he deferred his case.
765.60s: I want to save for his trial isn't until next year now.
769.68s: It's not until like October of next year.
772.64s: All right, so trading view.
776.08s: My internet might be going down because I don't know what's
778.28s: happened right now.
779.36s: I can't literally I am like gridlocked.
781.44s: I can't do shit.
783.68s: There it goes.
784.20s: OK, so trading view just loaded.
785.52s: Damn.
787.36s: I'm not going to lie.
789.68s: I don't see all they do have options.
791.16s: This is great.
791.84s: So we could just use trading view and plastic.
795.96s: All right, so let's grab this map over here now.
799.36s: We'll just let think or swim continue to ground on the background
803.40s: until it gets its act together.
805.68s: Move you guys over here.
806.60s: In case you're wondering above my head here, this is Iceland.
810.76s: This is one of the glacial slides that we cruised up on.
814.48s: This is from my drone.
816.68s: Game stop.
819.76s: There we go.
822.68s: The joke is they're trying to keep me down as I'm trying to look
825.28s: at this stuff.
825.80s: Sometimes joking aside, it can feel like that.
828.48s: Obviously, it's not what's actually happening,
830.20s: but it makes me feel generally annoyed.
834.24s: All right, so let's see what I've never looked at options
836.40s: in here before.
837.88s: Oh, Lord.
841.40s: This is a, oh, they have a surface which is kind of nice.
845.68s: I mean, I don't know if we're going to be able to do much
850.40s: with this guys.
852.68s: This is pretty rough.
861.68s: I can't see like, oh, I can't see shit.
867.72s: I can't see shit in here.
869.68s: All right, let's just take a look at the chart.
876.68s: We'll just go to a chart.
881.68s: All right.
884.68s: Great week.
886.68s: Great week for GameStop.
888.68s: So GameStop.
890.68s: It landed up ever so slightly.
898.68s: Here's what I saw.
900.68s: This obviously was highly anomalous when the cat
905.68s: chose to post.
907.68s: That sent things in a fervor.
909.68s: And we talked about that.
910.68s: I literally made a video about that specifically because of
913.68s: genuinely how topical I think it kind of is because it
921.68s: definitely beyond the shadow of a doubt highlights the fact
925.68s: that there are algorithms specifically stalking when he posts.
931.68s: Like that is it.
932.68s: You guys know that I do my absolute best to be as objective
937.68s: as humanly possible.
938.68s: And unless there's something that I'm very confident in, I won't call
941.68s: it straight.
942.68s: I would always caveat things as like I could be wrong.
945.68s: And I can be wrong about this to be very clear.
947.68s: I'm no fucking press in omnipotent being.
950.68s: There's no like heroes in this story.
952.68s: This is all of us just trying to figure it out as we go.
955.68s: But with something like this, I feel very confident.
960.68s: To say that the price action that we saw when he posted to me
965.68s: made it very, very clear that there are algorithms stalking
970.68s: and trying to front run his posts and the expected impact of his
976.68s: posts.
977.68s: And I mean, right wrong and different doesn't really matter
982.68s: what I think.
983.68s: But what does matter is that's also a highly tradable effect.
989.68s: And it's objectively a tradable effect.
991.68s: It's actually something that is not too difficult to catch
995.68s: as it's happening.
996.68s: You just to be very fast.
998.68s: But if we go into can we do like a one minute.
1002.68s: One second chart would be.
1004.68s: Hello intense.
1009.68s: We need to go here.
1019.68s: So you can see at 10 45 when the cat.
1024.68s: Dropped his nuts on the table via a nondescript meme with no
1029.68s: text and no specific information about anything.
1032.68s: Obviously would send game stop flying.
1036.68s: And this volume jacked over this one minute candle.
1042.68s: And then it subsequently drifted over a little bit of time.
1047.68s: This actually begs the question since this can go even shorter.
1050.68s: Let's go to like 30 seconds.
1054.68s: I can't go to 30 seconds because I have the peasant version of
1058.68s: this.
1059.68s: Maybe somebody that has the paid version of this.
1062.68s: To take a look in terms of seconds that would actually be kind of
1066.68s: neat to see.
1067.68s: And then I got a pop the door for Thorac is not just got home.
1070.68s: He's losing his mind.
1077.68s: So I'm going to go back to the table.
1080.68s: All right.
1083.68s: Zach says what do you think back to back days the 10 45 minute
1087.68s: candles 24 hours apart.
1091.68s: What do you mean?
1099.68s: And 45 here or you mean the day after.
1104.68s: 45.
1105.68s: I don't see anything sticking out to me there.
1110.68s: I see here.
1113.68s: I.
1134.68s: I don't know.
1140.68s: Okay.
1141.68s: So initial thoughts.
1144.68s: Is.
1146.68s: I don't fucking know.
1149.68s: That's very strange.
1151.68s: Now there are and the reason why I went silent for a second is
1155.68s: because part of what I do when I'm trying to analyze something
1158.68s: that I can't necessarily identify.
1161.68s: And I think that in effect very quickly is I start to think
1166.68s: of it in terms of.
1169.68s: Probabilities.
1171.68s: And I think of it in terms of.
1174.68s: Different styles of explanations.
1176.68s: So in this case what I was doing is I was looking at all the
1179.68s: different times around it.
1181.68s: To see if there's anything even close.
1184.68s: And I don't see that.
1188.68s: This had a clear catalyst.
1191.68s: This did not as far as we can see.
1198.68s: And it also had.
1200.68s: Yeah, that's like a massive spike in volume.
1204.68s: My guess it has something to do with like a 24 hour holding thing.
1208.68s: I don't know why, but that would be my that would be my best guess.
1212.68s: I don't know why.
1214.68s: I think that's a great question.
1217.68s: I don't know why.
1218.68s: Volume itself.
1220.68s: Oh, interesting.
1221.68s: So it looks like.
1223.68s: Tinker swim is still having issues.
1226.68s: Turning on.
1227.68s: Are other people able to get on to think or swim at a curiosity?
1229.68s: Because mine just gave me like a proxy error.
1232.68s: I don't actually seen those see those two frequently.
1237.68s: But.
1238.68s: T seems as thumb thumb thumb.
1241.68s: It could be.
1242.68s: I wish I could get on the damn platform so I could look at stuff.
1246.68s: Let's take a look at 1045.
1248.68s: We can look at unusual wheels and see what we can find in there.
1252.68s: Let me grab unusual wheels.
1262.68s: It's under it's down for maintenance until 12 am.
1265.68s: I hate it when they do this.
1267.68s: I do so much of my work when the market is closed.
1271.68s: I think it's hard to tell if it's going to work on that.
1273.68s: So you want to know.
1274.68s: That is so annoying.
1277.68s: They need us.
1280.68s: Lauren says.
1284.68s: What is thumb thumb.
1285.68s: That's the thing that.
1287.68s: Roar and kitty put up this thing.
1289.68s: This thing.
1292.68s: This is from.
1294.68s: I forgot what movie you guys will know all of this stuff.
1297.68s: I literally don't remember the movie name.
1299.68s: I watch some of it.
1300.68s: didn't get through all of it. But yeah, you put in like this little thing in the ground,
1307.72s: it pulls the sand worm and then he has to like hook on to it to go for a ride with these
1312.28s: little baby graphing hooks. That doesn't even really make sense to me. It's like, I feel
1316.36s: like to get on a worm that size, you need some fucking pikes of grappling hooks. Those
1322.04s: little baby grappling hooks ain't going to do it. You need like two pickaxes. Maybe pickax
1326.84s: eye would be the name. Like you really feel like you got to be on there.
1334.68s: And is this, is he supposed to be able to steer it? Is that the idea?
1341.72s: He's standing, but can he steer it?
1352.76s: Was he steering it or just riding it?
1357.64s: Because I feel like if you're trying to steer it by pulling them little lines, man,
1362.36s: that's a big ass worm. You would need a big hole hook in order to get that thing to move.
1370.60s: That worm probably doesn't even know you're on there.
1374.36s: Big ass worm. It reminds me of tremors. You guys ever see tremors? That was a fantastic movie.
1379.56s: I love that one. Big, big fan. But that's what thumb, thumb, thumb is.
1386.44s: So there's an idea that the cat is doing something on the back end to cause disruption or
1393.72s: movements for hedge funds and whatnot, like the larger institutions, which I do think that there
1401.88s: could be some corollary there. But let's take a look. So let's go, let's say objective about it for
1410.76s: now. You know we can grab the tinfoil hat. I still have the fucking tinfoil hat. It sits there
1414.76s: right there. I'm a printer. So we can get into tinfoil. But I really try to keep my
1421.72s: feelings and thoughts about stuff aside and look at stuff objectively for you all so that you
1427.32s: can then decide what you think. So let's go here. Let's go to what was it? So Thursdays when
1433.00s: he posted so it was a Friday? Wait, was that Friday? I don't think we need this one.
1449.96s: It was Friday. The other trick here is this could be something to do with
1465.00s: with pop-ax. I don't know what, but let's see.
1481.72s: And I do like a specific time. I can do a specific time. Great.
1486.20s: And I want to do it from 10, 40,
1496.20s: 50,
1509.72s: no big dark pull trades.
1517.24s: That's actually kind of interesting. I would have expected, I would have absolutely expected to see
1523.32s: more movement there.
1543.48s: Oh fuck is it giving me these weird-ass times bro? I could just want the whole time.
1553.48s: I guess this would leave a day off.
1565.40s: That's annoying that you can't just easily update those times.
1571.40s: Let's do a pipe.
1575.16s: Two, four, fuck. Yeah, nothing, nothing crazy there. And I know from an options perspective,
1582.52s: there wasn't anything that stuck out to me. I don't think it's that.
1589.40s: Yeah, I don't think it was that. So this, man, that's very curious.
1602.44s: Let's go back. Let's find another previous Friday.
1613.40s: Here.
1624.76s: Friday November 29th. Wait, why does this- is it a half day?
1636.92s: Oh, we gotta go back more.
1642.52s: Friday the 24th.
1661.16s: Oh, interesting.
1663.16s: What is this spike?
1668.92s: 57, 45, nothing. Okay. So that's probably just chasing ghosts. I could do a broader statistical
1677.16s: analysis on intra-day. But I kind of want to do it. I don't want to waste your guys this time,
1686.84s: but I kind of want to do it.
1693.40s: Because what I would like to do is grab intra-day minute-level data from GameStop.
1699.72s: And I can go back like at least the past month. And I can look at the number of
1704.28s: instances where GameStop has higher than average intra-day volume at 1045.
1713.72s: The problem is there's not a ton we learn from it. But it's just kind of like a
1719.56s: gnawing curiosity that I have. Yeah, let me do it real quick. It's not going to take me that long.
1726.68s: I actually can probably get GPT or something like that to do this.
1731.00s: So let me grab GME.
1735.40s: And then let's go to historical data. And then we need minute-level.
1743.16s: We can do 15 minutes. That'll be a lot easier.
1749.72s: 15 minutes. And then we'll see how far back.
1755.56s: Maximum 20,000 records. So it's not going to be able to go back very far. But that's okay.
1759.48s: I'm just going to try to make it go back a couple of months. We won't go back that far though.
1762.68s: That's not good. All right.
1765.96s: Let's see what we have here. Where does this go back to?
1776.12s: Yeah. Okay. So it goes back a couple of months. This is fine.
1780.28s: So what I'm going to do now is just kind of clean this a little bit so that we can dump this
1786.20s: into pet GPT. So this looks okay. Save that.
1791.72s: Kill it. Save that. I think I saved. You'll just save, bro.
1800.76s: What the? My tripping? This looks like I'm hitting save.
1809.88s: What the fuck? Dude, it's the weirdest things whenever I'm doing shit for this fucking stock.
1816.68s: I'm telling you, ever fucking.
1820.20s: It's always something weird. All right.
1826.20s: And then for this, we want to use GPT. Let's grab this. I'm going to see. I want to see first
1835.24s: if that's saved. If it didn't save, then GPT typically has an issue with it. Oops, didn't mean to do that.
1845.80s: It didn't save it. It's a fucking hater. Can you please save?
1852.92s: I think it saved. Okay. Great. Now it's saved. Maybe they just had to ask nicely instead of
1857.16s: insulting it. It's almost like there might be something to that. Okay. So now I'm going to have it
1863.32s: analyze plot the plot the volume at 1045 to 1100
1884.20s: against the one day average. Let's do against the average 15 minute volume for the same day.
1902.76s: Identify the dates where there is anomalous volume at 1045.
1914.68s: Exceeding the average 15 minute volume by at least 2x.
1928.60s: Do that says. I'm curious how well this will work for me.
1934.12s: A little C. In the meantime, I'm going to keep eyeballing a little bit.
1950.36s: Okay. So it has a handful of instances. This is interesting. This is very interesting.
1972.28s: Let's go to November 7th. I'm going to change this to 15 minutes so it's easier to navigate.
1985.48s: Let's go to November 7th.
1996.20s: There's one other thing I'm going to look at.
2003.24s: I mean, the volume doubled there, but that doesn't. That's not that crazy. Okay. So now what I want to do is
2011.88s: create a plot to identify the three most common 15 minute periods where volume expands at least.
2029.72s: What do you want to look at? What is this? How do you view the volume on this other? It is okay.
2039.00s: Volume is 720 to 240. So at least 2x from the intro day 15 minute average.
2055.08s: Okay. So to run down what I just found from the original looking at 1045, there are a few days that 1045 had
2067.24s: anomalous volume more than I would have expected. Honestly, in a relatively short sample, it was at least
2072.60s: five instances, six instances. So there's probably something from a programmatic standpoint when things
2081.64s: are set to go. Now what I'm doing is I'm trying to identify and it's exactly what I would expect.
2088.92s: So the three most common 15 minute periods with volume expansion is 0,930. It's exactly what you would expect.
2094.68s: 1545 exactly what you would expect. And then 0,945, which is not what you would expect necessarily. So this seems
2105.96s: this seems generally in line with expectations. So what that tells me from this movement that we saw
2111.80s: over the last couple days, we would need to see more of it is what it summarizes to.
2117.32s: Like I wouldn't feel comfortable saying that without a doubt, there's something going on here.
2126.44s: Like at the 1045 handle, because it's just two data points, it's weird. And in the world of data
2138.20s: analysis, a lot of times what we do is we find things that are weird. And then we pay close
2142.84s: attention to them because we want to know if it's something that's persistent, if there's something
2147.80s: behind it for some reason. But I do think I do think there's something potentially behind that
2156.60s: timeframe. I just don't know what. But that's also not a bizarre timeframe for transaction activity
2162.76s: to start picking up. We're getting into like the last trading couple hours of the day.
2168.28s: Volume will often expand during that timeframe.
2181.64s: So yeah, interesting. But not totally anomalous. Because again,
2191.64s: one of the reasons why I wanted to see how many instances did we see volume for the 1044
2198.60s: candle expanding the average 15 minute volume by at least two times. And it happened quite a few
2205.48s: times. I see six instances where it was way more than that. And quite a few more instances where
2213.32s: it at least occurred. So yeah, I don't necessarily see anything jumping out at me there. But very
2220.68s: interesting. What I find most interesting to zoom this out and to talk about the chart from, I
2227.64s: wish I had think her swim up said, oh my shit, it feels like I'm in like a foreign house right now.
2232.44s: Feels like I'm in somebody else's office trying to do my work. It's just not the same vibe. But
2237.96s: I mean, we'll make it happen. The main thing is I have a few price levels that I think are really
2243.80s: relevant and interesting. So we can see one of them creating a bit of a floor here. We can see
2254.12s: the blue. Why the fuck would it be blue? Blue is terrible. It needs to be like gold or something,
2262.68s: something cool. Blue. We got time for blue. Stop that immediately.
2269.32s: Oh, it's trash. Absolutely trash.
2286.52s: The line is as thin as possible. It's good. Okay. So we can see price is clearly picking levels,
2297.08s: which is again, really, really nice to see. I would love to throw a volume profile on this,
2303.88s: but I don't think I can because again, I have the peasant version. And I think that you only get
2309.16s: like two indicators. I could take the, I forgot, I have RSI on here. We could drop the RSI really
2314.36s: fast. And then we can add volume profile if it has it. That would be cool. I don't really care
2320.68s: about RSI here. Indicators, volume profile. What the fuck? Auto anchored. That sounds right.
2340.36s: Most important price points and volume levels depending on the chart current time frames. Yeah,
2343.96s: that's right. We want that. That damn it. Why can't I use this?
2355.88s: Yo, these guys are haters. You can't put shit on his chart without buying it.
2363.00s: Bastards. What's this thing do? That's not the same, but that would be fine if I can use this.
2373.96s: Yeah, fine. Whatever. This is whoever made, whoever made this thing, I appreciate your effort.
2379.72s: It is not at all what I want. This is.
2387.40s: Poe Vey. Never mind, gang. Let's just get rid of that. And let's.
2393.96s: Does the does this search VRVP? Let's see.
2403.72s: VRVP. Visible range volume proof.
2410.20s: Yeah, this is closer. Still not what I want, but they got.
2415.64s: Damn it. Trading view.
2417.40s: These guys are haters. I only have one indicator. They won't even let your boy get a second indicator
2428.60s: on the four free. You got to buy some shit. Damn it. Think her swim. Think her swim needs to be
2435.80s: up right now. All right. Well, this is this is what we're relegated to is we we can have RSI,
2443.48s: which is great, I guess. Beautiful for us. What I wanted to see are there's a handful of price
2454.12s: levels here that I think are really, really relevant. And we can't see them right now, but they're
2460.12s: there. And what I'm noticing is prices consolidating pretty well. And I want to drive that point
2467.00s: home because since prices consolidating pretty well, I find that to be really positive.
2473.64s: And I find it to be so positive, even though it was a little bit of a down day, a couple
2477.88s: down days, I find it to be positive because this is like literally the assumption of more normal
2486.36s: price activity. And I just think that's good for trading view. Like I don't see a scenario where
2494.04s: that's net negative for trading view here or trading view for GameStop. I don't know why I would
2500.04s: say trading view right now. I wouldn't say that I don't like them as much as Robinhood because I
2504.04s: still like their stuff. I would just love it if they would let me get a second indicator on the chart
2510.12s: for fucking free. I'm not asking for more than two, but you know, beggars cannot be choosers. We
2517.64s: only get these. So if you guys can though in the background, if you can keep trying think her
2523.32s: swim because it might pop up while we're on here, I'll keep running it up once in a while and see,
2529.08s: wait a minute, the web platform, the web platform, think her swim has a web platform.
2540.20s: Fuck that one's down to. I really thought I outsmarted them there. I really thought I had them
2547.00s: going, but I didn't damn it. We tried. All right, let's get into, let's get into this.
2559.16s: Dusty, dust says you don't like trading view. I think trading view is fine. I don't use them.
2563.16s: I use them obviously as like a backup, but you could tell how clujee me getting around in it is.
2571.32s: So yeah, like I typically just use think her swim because think her swim is completely fine and
2575.80s: does everything I need. But trading views like the only one I've used so far is like a backup.
2586.68s: So from that perspective, it's good. All right, so I remember this now, we have a way to find
2595.24s: bingo. See, look how efficient we're getting here. We know we're leaving off.
2599.48s: Let us get in.
2607.96s: I think we did this. Okay, so it looks good. That Paul Revere has been definitely a staunch supporter
2617.64s: of GameStop going back to his famous ride in the middle of the night, letting everybody know first
2625.72s: that the British were coming and he's also letting us know that the attendees are coming,
2628.76s: which is great. It's always good to have like really prolific figures a part of the journey and
2636.52s: a part of the path here. So big fan.
2640.84s: And let us now see what this person, oh, I forgot. I remember don't worry. I remembered our cheek
2651.88s: code to get through this. And again, if there's any one of these that I'm supposed to go slower on,
2656.60s: let me know. And then I'm more than happy to dive into the ones that look really interesting.
2662.92s: What I'm doing now is I'm just grabbing the text. I'm going to dump it into chat GPT in this case
2669.48s: perplexity and then use chat GPT's engine to summarize. Well, I actually probably use perplexity
2674.52s: or clogged. I think then that clogged. I'll probably use perplexity for this. Perplexity is pretty
2678.92s: good at this kind of stuff. And I'm going to have it summarize for us what this is talking about.
2686.12s: The point is to get to the big level details quickly because this document is absolutely massive.
2693.88s: It's over 800 pages. And this isn't even the whole DD library. This is literally like in a
2699.16s: malgamation of DD at one point in the library. We still have like straight up the whole library to
2705.24s: go through. I didn't realize what I was signing up for when I said that we're going to go through
2708.44s: this DD library. But I also, I'm one of those people that once I start doing something,
2714.92s: I'm going to fucking finish it. So this could take me into next year eat. Well, it's definitely
2719.56s: going to take me into next year. I don't know if it'll take me through next year. That would be
2723.00s: kind of nuts. We'll see. I don't fucking know. But if it does, it does. So be it. You boys here
2730.04s: for the boys here for the ride. And then I was texting with Newton a little bit. I need to
2740.76s: get like a bunch of information from him on like a leave off period for what he's thinking will be
2749.08s: really pertinent going forward. Because I want to try to help track some of those things just so that
2754.36s: people can monitor some of the same metrics. Because I know he's doing stuff like the swaps and whatnot.
2760.28s: But yeah. Okay, here's the TL TLDR at the bottom. So another thing is
2772.44s: the TLDR being at the bottom is just a vicious move. Normally those would be more towards the top.
2779.88s: So, you know, I've got to feel some type of way about this. Okay, so summarize,
2785.32s: summarize this and dump this whole thing in.
2794.04s: TCM King says I would be interested in seeing you skip and go over when the river runs dry,
2798.12s: more options focus. Oh, I'll definitely get there. But part of the reason of me doing this is for
2803.00s: my own education and benefit. So I am a significant, significant,
2809.40s: and a component of getting to base level data by ourselves individually on your own.
2816.36s: That's why I do this on live streams with you all is because this is exactly what I would be doing
2820.28s: anyways. The difference is I just live stream doing it so that you all can hopefully find some more
2826.04s: first layer information for yourselves as well. I just think that's so important to get to first
2831.08s: hand level information because it's all of us have played the game of telephone. And the problem
2839.08s: with telephone is as you go through three, four, five, six people, the message is fucking completely
2844.28s: different than what you started. You could be like, hey, oh, the attendees are coming. And then
2849.40s: at the end, it'll be like, yo, I want to make gang bang. It's just be completely fucking different
2854.28s: than what you started as. And it's not due to anybody necessarily trying to be lame. It's due to
2860.36s: the passage of information and it changes over time naturally. So I am a really significant
2868.12s: supporter of first level, first contact information. So that's exactly what I'm doing here.
2875.32s: All right. That's not it. That's not it at all. So this got all fucked up.
2887.48s: Summarize this post. It went back to the data analysis. So I think I needed to start like a new thread.
2895.08s: Okay, here we go. And then I'll move this over so that you guys can
2905.24s: see it too. This can go like that without the platform, I actually don't know how wide the screen is.
2918.20s: So you guys will have to let me know I'm assuming this will be completely off your screen.
2925.40s: How far can you see you could see to there? Yeah, okay. So it looks like this.
2935.32s: This will work. Great.
2938.68s: Okay.
2944.68s: Dusty Dusty is happy to hear he's not stopping his stream. He is inspirational. Oh, is he not?
2949.48s: That's great if he's not. I hope he's not. I haven't talked to him about. I literally didn't
2953.88s: even know that he was stopping. I don't watch all of his videos. That's literally just because I
2958.92s: don't really watch anybody's stuff. But I'll try to catch some of his stuff sometimes or I'll ask him
2964.04s: some messages like we'll text back and forth. But you guys are the ones that told me that he was
2968.28s: talking about stopping. So if he has now decided not to, that would be fantastic. I would love that.
2979.72s: Okay, so this is what it says.
2983.00s: April 2020 GameStop price bottomed under two COVID-19 impacts, shorting, triple to six.
2989.80s: So this just looks like it's talking about.
2998.44s: This looks like it's just talking about like the price path of it.
3008.20s: Dusty Dusty says he said to him in his video. That's awesome. That's great news.
3011.88s: That's just a win across the board. Did he say what made him change his mind?
3015.48s: I'm just going to text him. I'm really curious.
3019.96s: Okay.
3031.16s: Okay. So, what is this?
3036.20s: Most argues that GME's leadership likely supports a share recall.
3040.52s: Okay. Well, that didn't happen.
3049.56s: See, this is the kind of thing I am genuinely kind of happy that we can skip through some of it.
3054.44s: Because if the ultimate thesis turns out to be something that's just not what happened,
3066.04s: is this another post that I did I go too far?
3070.60s: Fuck. I'm lost now. Hold on. Nope. Didn't mean to do that.
3076.92s: And this.
3085.80s: Okay. So this is the next post. I just want to read their TLDR.
3094.20s: Activists in the Lester, large vote, short interest over 100%.
3100.28s: Jimmy does a share recall ahead of his meeting. Okay. Yeah. So it just didn't happen.
3105.16s: Okay. Good enough.
3118.20s: T.C. M. King says I get that. I think there's just too much and a lot of it. It's just the same.
3122.20s: Yeah. There definitely is a lot. There ain't too much dog.
3125.48s: You guys don't understand. Well, maybe you do. Maybe you don't.
3129.56s: But the literally the world of a trader is sifting through massive amounts of information,
3138.52s: quickly trying to decipher as much as you possibly can and then making decisions off of it.
3145.32s: So for me, this really isn't that much work. And here's the cool part. If I'm not mistaken,
3153.24s: built in AI assistant, it needs the stuff just to be less than I think it said 400 pages,
3159.32s: which we're coming up on that. So what I'll do is I'm literally going to split this PDF
3165.08s: into two different PDFs so that then we can use the native AI, which I think will be much quicker.
3173.80s: That's my that's my ultimate game plan. If not, you're just going to see your fucking boy doing a lot
3178.92s: of fucking reading. All right. Let's see what this says.
3182.92s: So this we can clear this had this summarized this next talk.
3197.96s: Nope, that's the wrong one. That is the wrong one.
3213.72s: I
3215.72s: summarize the second piece.
3221.80s: Well, let's see if it can do this. I have I have faith.
3229.56s: Maybe I don't fucking have faith. I've lost all faith. We have to do another thread.
3234.92s: Summarize this.
3239.96s: There's got to be a better way to do that though. You guys you guys know how to fucking get it.
3244.12s: Maybe I need to name the sources. That could be it.
3249.88s: Spectative analysis, game stop, potential future events could trigger short squeeze again. So
3254.44s: this we can kind of flip through a bit. Yep. So co-in joining all that stuff.
3265.48s: Okay.
3274.84s: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3281.32s: Lead to a significant price move in a game stop technical indicators potential cattle. Yeah. So
3285.64s: this is again to I think this was to dust to dust point very much the same as kind of the last one.
3294.84s: The next one the naked shorting scam in numbers. I think we can comfortably move through this one
3303.40s: pretty quickly because I feel most of us are appraised. Does this have a TLDR in it?
3312.44s: Maybe I'll just scan through it super fast. This one I feel like we have a pretty good grasp on
3318.44s: at this point. Why would it go to 101? That's so frustrating. 100 is great. Thanks.
3325.80s: All right. Let's flip through this. Oh, here we go. Hold. Okay. Great.
3330.76s: Built an AI deep in the money calls to create naked shares. Yep.
3336.04s: So one of the things to know as I look at this is I don't think you can make this claim.
3348.04s: Like I and I'm actually very curious how they're going to make this claim.
3355.00s: Keep in the money call covering seems to be the last resort of illegal desperation. It's so easy to
3361.16s: spot. Okay. Investigated Mary put naked shorting at the Jan mini squeeze open interest the creation
3369.32s: of millions of naked shares with married put trades. Put volumes appear to be sustained at higher
3374.20s: levels to keep rolling over. I don't agree with this conclusion outright. Up to 400 million naked
3381.80s: shares created in total. Look through 13 F. Finally. Here we go. Clear idea who's on which side of
3389.08s: the battle. Okay. Dark pool data from finra which we have access to massive changes in trade
3397.00s: behavior since Jan huge increases in shares traded by each trade is of a few shares. Okay.
3403.24s: All right. Let's see what it says. Yeah. Let's do this deep in the money call thing. I'm really
3412.20s: curious about this. Want to share sold short without being owned or borrowed. It is sold naked. Yep.
3422.04s: Can happen as part of normal market activity. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. We know all this.
3430.68s: They can resolve the F. D.s without actually covering is through locates. Yes.
3437.48s: Deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately to acquire the shares and close F. D.s.
3444.92s: Let's take a look at this.
3460.44s: That have been observed. Appeared to circumvent certain requirements of reg show. Okay.
3466.36s: Hard to borrow securities can be subject to pricing disparity relative to options trading on
3470.44s: the same security makes it ton of sense. Typically they may be seen in synthetic positions trading
3475.00s: at lower price than the underlying security that creates an arbitrage. Yep. This is exactly
3478.60s: yep. This creates a potential of profit. Yep. For short sellers of the underlying security.
3483.88s: If they can avoid the high cost to typically associated with obtaining for delivery, that's right.
3490.36s: Risk alerts highlights observed trading strategies that can be designed to circumvent certain
3494.44s: requirements of reg show among other things. Reg show requires fail to deliver positions resulting
3500.20s: from short sale transactions to be closed out by a specific date either by borrowing or purchasing
3505.16s: securities of a like kind. Yes. Okay. Reg show.
3513.88s: No. Trading strategies could be used to impression purchasing by the short seller of satisfied closed
3523.24s: out requirements of the clearing firm with the broker dealer. Okay.
3528.44s: Reality. The purchase shares in a position are oftentimes not delivered because of subsequent
3532.92s: options trading used to reestablish or otherwise extend the broker to release fail position
3539.16s: without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose such that the clearing firm broker dealer
3547.96s: allocated a fail to deliver position does not satisfy was that requirement. Okay. Yep.
3553.80s: Same page so far. As I'm going through this, if you guys have any questions, let me know. This
3559.80s: makes this this looks completely great forward to me. The locate requirement which we know
3568.68s: purposes for market maker, must also be a market maker security being sold yes, yes. Okay.
3576.60s: Provides that it constitutes a manipulative or deceptive device or
3580.12s: and try vans. Fuck yeah. Look at that fucking word. Contribence. I don't know what y'all know about.
3585.64s: I don't know what you guys know about anything, but I'm here trying to talk about some contrivance.
3591.16s: I'm here also trying to order some dinner. What do you guys think is for dinner tonight?
3595.48s: The steak last night was good. I'm almost I'm almost tempted to kind of run it back, but
3603.08s: I'm not set on it. Honestly, maybe
3611.80s: Ian says burgers. I could do a burger. I was thinking maybe Chinese.
3615.56s: Chinese sometimes like really, really scratches an itch.
3627.24s: Might be Chinese, yeah.
3631.80s: Burgers is another definitely another potential.
3636.68s: I don't really know what leaks are, but that's kind of a I like the name leaks.
3648.92s: I've had leaks before. I don't really know what they are. I like them.
3654.36s: Dan Dan noodles, sardines and crackers. I do like sardines on a Caesar salad.
3661.64s: If you can get a nice sardine on a Caesar salad that is on fleek, I think we're going Mexican because
3667.48s: it's fast. Leaks are like green onions. Oh, interesting. Yeah, anytime I have them, I don't really
3676.04s: recall like a bunch of flavor from them. I just kind of know that I eat them.
3681.96s: Perfect. All right. I'm going to wait for Mel to turn down that because I know she's not going to
3686.12s: want it, but I have to send a tour out of just being thoughtful.
3692.44s: Rowing to these is cashew chicken. Oh, you mean from Chinese? I'm like a chicken
3696.92s: with broccoli. Chicken with broccoli is good or sesame chicken. If it's like spicy, you could
3701.64s: put a little spice in there. That's pretty good. Yep. So she's passing on this. I'm going to ask her
3707.56s: up pennies. See if she wants that instead. All right. Let's get back into this while she's
3716.52s: sorting her life out. Okay. Bye, right. Here we go. Simultaneous sale of calls with the purchase
3725.64s: of equivalent amount of shares underlying. So this is a really, really common. This is a really
3731.56s: common strategy for larger style funds and things like that or people that are trading for income.
3738.60s: I was actually just going to open up the Thinkerswin platform to show you the risk profile of it.
3744.84s: And obviously I cannot do that. So what I can do is draw a perfect Mel would do Chinese. So
3754.84s: we're going to audible it and we are going to roll with Chinese. Every once in a while, I just have
3760.68s: to like row a random other thing by her. And every once in a while, it'll connect. And it looks
3767.16s: like we we got it tonight, which is great. Do you guys like like a PF Changs kind of Chinese or
3778.20s: like a local Chinese place? I like the local stuff way better. Signature domain that looks good.
3790.68s: Sesame chicken that is 100% happening. We don't need any extras with that.
3803.16s: And then I think we need chicken with broccoli.
3811.08s: Perfect. Local New York has the best. Yeah, New York has really, really good Chinese food. That's
3817.64s: one thing I do miss about New York in general is New York is kind of like a melting pot for all
3823.64s: different kinds of foods. And there are a lot of really, really good foods there. I'm a massive fan.
3833.64s: Okay, so let me draw this for you. Does everybody know what a buy right is? Because if you do,
3839.24s: then I can skip over this. But if you don't, then I can draw it out super fast.
3843.16s: You guys can let me know what you're what you're leaning is.
3853.16s: Willie says need. Okay, so Joe doesn't that's totally cool. As long as we have one know,
3858.04s: then it's worth the time. So let me grab this. We'll do this, this, and this. So you guys should be
3866.12s: able to. Perfect. So here's a buy right. I can buy it open 100 shares of GameStop.
3879.72s: And the risk profile for this, are you guys familiar with what a risk profile is?
3885.88s: Risk profile just plots the PNL of something. So this is a zero line. This is your negative return.
3895.00s: This is positive return. And then this is stock price. This is stock at zero, which is today right now.
3904.84s: And then this is stock as it goes up. And then this is stock as it goes down.
3916.04s: So when you buy 100 shares at spot price, it'll look something like not that, that, right?
3924.76s: So what this does is it means as GameStop goes up, you make money as it goes down, you lose money.
3931.48s: I think everybody's pretty comfortable and familiar with that. Now, a buy right is when we do this
3936.60s: first trade, and then we pair it with the second trade, which is when we sell to open one.
3942.92s: And then it can be whatever strike call. So X call at one dollar, whatever the price is.
3951.40s: So what this means is we're going to collect a $100 credit upfront. And then our new risk profile
3959.00s: will look like this. So rather than having unlimited upside potential, like you see here,
3969.08s: the other trade would look like this. This one takes this departure. And it's because you're
3976.76s: collecting money upfront on the call. So a lot of people will do this when they are getting into
3982.84s: stocks that they really like, that they want a hold, that they don't mind holding. And it's a way
3988.44s: to collect a little bit of a premium literally while you're getting into something that you want to
3994.12s: be in anyways. So there's no love lost on buying the shares selling the call against it. That's
4005.08s: the idea behind it. Buy rates associated with the activity at issue employee deep in the money calls.
4012.44s: A married put is the simultaneous purchase of a put and purchase of equivalent amount of shares
4017.08s: in the underlying. So a married put by comparison is this. Back to the risk profile that you all
4029.72s: experts on now. This is price again, this is the zero line. And what a married put is designed to do
4038.36s: is you buy to open 100 shares. And then you buy to open one X strike put at whatever a dollar.
4053.64s: So in this case, you're going to pay $100. But what this does is if you remember the first line,
4066.12s: this here is stock at zero. This is what long stock looks like. When we look at the buy right,
4076.76s: it looks like this. Let me use a different color. Buy right will look like this. And then a married put
4094.84s: will instead look like this. The won't go past the zero line.
4099.40s: So this is the difference. This is what a buy right will look like. If I were to extrapolate it out by itself,
4108.36s: it would be like this. And the purpose of this is you limit your downside. So this means if GameStop
4124.28s: goes down to zero, your max loss is capped here. And it looks great, right? Like why wouldn't everybody do
4133.80s: this? Well, most people don't do it because it's really expensive to buy the puts. It's really,
4139.80s: really expensive on a relative level. So that's what those two look like in conjunction with one
4148.44s: another. So now let's take a look at the rest of this because I'm actually really curious what it
4156.28s: thinks the the total connection is. I've not seen the description through this yet. I'm not
4167.24s: looking through this whole thing. Joe says, okay, I do know what I do know what buying to open covered
4179.96s: calls and so on. I didn't know it was a buy right. It's just called a buy right. And it's not
4186.28s: right as in right or left. It's right as in writing. Like you're writing an option. That's a
4192.52s: that's an old way of saying selling an option. People don't really use that anymore writing an
4197.48s: option, but that's an old way of saying selling an option. You write an option. So that's why it's
4202.92s: called a buy right because of just older school language. Okay. When associated with the activity
4213.32s: issue, Mary puts typically employee deep in the money puts likes options are exchange level options
4220.76s: that have non-standard customizable contract terms. The main features of flex options compare to
4225.88s: standard traded options or the ability to specify strike price and expiration date. Yep.
4231.48s: Price at the market. Pull call parity. Yes. And that X. Yes.
4237.00s: Here we go. Periodically, security's become hard to borrow and where the large and persistent
4243.32s: fails to deliver in a security end up threshold security list. These situations give rise to
4248.44s: pricing differentials and the options of these securities and the pull call parity equation may
4251.96s: appear out of balance, which is in part a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities.
4257.64s: When the shares become hard to borrow, the synthetic position typically trades at a price that are
4261.80s: less than the actual shares. This reflects the risk that shares cannot be borrowed and will have
4266.60s: to be bought in compliance with the right show closeout requirements. In the extreme, these price
4271.48s: differences can be quite large creating profit, potential profit opportunities and certain
4276.44s: options trading strategies for those who are able to short the underlying equity securities
4279.88s: without paying the high cost typically associated with obtaining delivery hard to borrow security.
4283.32s: That result short. Yep. Makes total sense. I dig all of this. This is really like, I think they
4290.92s: did a good job outlining this because it's super, super clear. One strategy could be designed to
4297.08s: get manage of potential profit opportunities. Rowing, Rowing, what up, Rowing, Titty? Rowing, Titty says
4303.56s: Rob Kitty, who logs up on 125's every expiration. Kitty is the decent master. That's funny. I
4310.36s: highly doubt it, but it could be and they would be fucking hilarious. But yeah, I severely doubt that
4317.00s: it's him. Why am I getting added to these fucking WhatsApp groups, dude? WhatsApp is super annoying.
4327.96s: Trippy says maybe that's what they were doing with those massive 125 puts. Do you mean 125
4334.92s: puts or calls? Because I most people are typically talking about the super far out of the money
4341.72s: calls, which is generally just unit building. I'm not sure about the put scenario that you're
4350.68s: referring to, but we could take a look at it. All right. Activity, most often,
4360.68s: number broker dearers who claim to rely on the exceptional locate requirement for options market
4365.24s: makers, options market makers claim they can enter into the short stock position without first.
4371.48s: Locating the shares to borrow because it's part of a bona fide market making activity.
4375.24s: Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an
4379.24s: exemption or exception to the locate to comply with right. So the options market maker still must
4384.28s: deliver in shares in settlement or if in a field of deliver position results in a clearing firm
4390.36s: that failed to deliver must be closed out in accordance with right. So maybe a violation. Yeah.
4399.48s: Where the market maker does not deliver shares and engages in second subsequent
4403.00s: insurance actions in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firms obligations
4407.32s: to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting field of settlement. That's fascinating.
4413.08s: In addition, we're a clearing firm subject to close out requirements purchases or borrow
4417.16s: securities applicable close out. Yeah. All right. So they're talking about building a synthetic long
4430.68s: time.
4433.64s: Assuming XYZ is hard to borrow trader A or its broker dealers unwilling to borrow shares to make
4439.80s: delivery on the short sale of actual shares. It may result in FTD rather than paying the borrowing
4445.80s: fee on the shares to make delivery or unwinding the position. They may enter into a trade that gives
4450.44s: the appearance of satisfying the close out requirements. But in reality allows trader A to maintain
4454.52s: the short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often this is done through
4458.68s: the use of buy right, but may also be done as merit put. Interesting.
4463.80s: It's a commonly referred to as reset transactions. They have the effect of reset in the time that a
4467.80s: broker dealer must purchase or borrow it. Yep. And we know that this is happening. And this is one of
4472.44s: the, this is one of the main issues because we look at this, we know that this is happening.
4480.44s: And we also know that to the degree that this is happening, there's nothing that technically
4486.20s: can stop it unless it's regulated out because you can just perpetuate the position. That's the whole
4495.00s: point of it. Rowing City says, are there even 125 puts? Yeah. Well, if there's 125 call, I would
4504.04s: pull it up on the platform. But if there's 125 calls, there would be 125 puts. They are
4512.36s: side by side with one another and an options chain.
4517.08s: So very interesting. I'll drop this in here for you all to take a look at at your leisure.
4522.44s: But I like that one. That was interesting. I think we can close that.
4527.32s: Let's see where we're at in this thing. Look, look at this. We're literally halfway through the
4533.08s: third row. Flock in hell. This is a big project we started.
4541.56s: I won't go into all the details, but points you towards God tier DD. Okay. Well, gotta look at
4554.20s: God tier DD. Okay. Can't look at God tier DD. One way naked short can resolve
4562.04s: deep in the money calls can be bought and exercised immediately. Yep.
4572.04s: Yeah.
4580.04s: 140 million FDDs being hidden since January.
4584.68s: Add detection of option volumes used to hide FDDs and FDD values. Let me see.
4592.68s: So I see the point that he's making. Yeah. So I like the this. I agree with totally
4600.28s: suspicious deep in the money call volumes. I completely agree with this as suspicious and
4606.92s: definitely correlated to a degree. Completely agree with that. But the problem with these kinds of
4613.56s: things when we're conducting this style of analysis is there's a lot. There is a lot of stuff going
4619.48s: on. And when we start to see FDD starting to skyrocket, there's typically other things going on
4625.72s: in the underlying at that point in time. So thus the problem here is we're looking at two
4633.56s: indiscreet variables discreetly. There's other stuff at play when we're looking at this. And then
4639.32s: we're trying to design a causal relationship that may or may not be there. So I completely
4645.40s: agree on the suspicious element of this. I and I 100% agree with that. But I think that we can't
4652.60s: make the leap that we're saying this is that it's evidence that there's 140 million FDDs being
4661.32s: hidden because FDDs happen to coincide with call activity because we can see that FDDs also skyrocket
4669.00s: here. And then there's really no significant rise in the call activity. So same thing here.
4678.12s: So as a causal relationship, I don't know if it gets that. Now when things get to an extreme like
4684.28s: this, which looks like during the 2021 move, it's no surprise that you would see everything start
4692.68s: to get out of whack at that point. So that's not to say that there's nothing behind this. I completely
4697.00s: agree. But I just I think that you can't make a causal relation a definitive causal relationship.
4702.76s: We can speculate. We can say that this is suspicious. We can say that we think that this is tied.
4706.92s: We can say that we think this is going on. But I think that's different
4713.80s: than saying something like this. And again, this is the nature of how I analyze things.
4721.32s: Is I'm very reluctant to discreetly decide Ye-Ear-Nay or to qualify something as something
4728.92s: until I have a really rigorous analysis behind it. And this is just missing a couple pieces.
4734.76s: So I think this is on the right track. I think it's looking at a clear problem completely agree with
4739.00s: all that. But I don't think that it necessarily leads to the discreet conclusion that they're coming
4746.68s: with. Here we see that suspicious deep in the money call volumes often proceed big price increases.
4754.28s: This is suggests that this illegal trick is used as a last resort. So easy to see even by eye
4758.60s: looking at options change when shorts go desperate. They go deep. Keep calls.
4764.36s: Yes, I agree with using options even just to offset the potential margin requirements and
4775.80s: stuff that they would have from the shorts. But here's one of the problems I see with this is that
4783.00s: again, if we're assuming that the shorts are able to see a head of these really big moves
4791.24s: and then they're using options ahead of these known big moves, my guess is the shorts would do
4796.76s: one of two things. They would either just close the shorts and then reopen them. Their basis is not
4802.04s: sensitive in that way. Or they might just wade through the perceived short squeeze and size the
4815.00s: trade so that they can withstand what they would again preemptively be thinking is going to happen
4819.24s: in front of these big moves. So this is really tricky because you can see volume and you can see
4828.44s: options activity in general expand ahead of big moves. And part of it, I think 100% is likely
4837.56s: due to some of this activity for sure. But I also think a lot of it is people speculating
4843.16s: things get active progressively. And we can pick up on those artifacts in the options chain.
4852.84s: That's exactly and I've told you guys this a million times. This is exactly how I found
4857.16s: game stop when I started as a content creator is because I happened to have caught it on a few
4863.88s: different scans. I traded it and then I made a couple videos about the stuff going on because it
4868.36s: was interesting. And then obviously that now is me reading a fucking 800 page DD library on Saturday
4875.40s: night with everybody. It's not a funny how shit progresses. But me detecting some options volume
4882.92s: is what originally drew me into this most recently. We see that SI decreased massively after all
4889.32s: the suspicious call activity and late Jan as well as getting FDD under controls. And here's the other
4894.60s: problems that there's other ways that they can kick these FDDs around. So yeah, I'm sure that once
4899.16s: the FDDs get to an extreme that they're probably moving.
4901.72s: Mary puts reverse conversions abuse the stuff. Yep, we read this.
4917.72s: Where's Melvin capital at today? That's a lot of put without any GME shares or calls. They had
4925.56s: six million shares and puts. Meebling had two million.
4940.76s: Okay.
4945.48s: So big short losers have no shares. Large put positions. Okay.
4956.20s: Melvin takes the biggest prize six million shares here are the main offenders.
4966.28s: This is this is a solid DD. I like this one a lot. They have a lot of
4975.24s: they have a lot of really good information. In gorge war chests, I'm assuming that was war
4981.48s: chest or shire, but it got cut off. I have no idea the GME price. It depends on what your
4994.12s: little grapes are telling you. I don't know if it's like cherries or grapes, but I'm not yeah,
5001.16s: whatever value that they give you in your tummy. That's probably the correct value. By the way,
5008.12s: great to see you as per usual. How can bonafide market maker privileges be used? Yeah,
5017.00s: so we just read all this. Again, this is the cool part is we read all this firsthand.
5027.80s: Yeah.
5028.60s: Okay. That's a solid DD. So a couple things I picked up from that that I think really are
5046.28s: pertinent specifically are the use of options to perpetuate FTDs. And I think the relationship
5056.44s: between FTDs and deep in the money call trading activity is reported by them is definitely
5062.84s: interesting. I think that it's multivariate. It can't be broken down to just those variables
5069.48s: unfortunately, but overall, I think that it's still really, really decent information.
5074.60s: This seems like it's going to be, yeah, this is kind of what I was expecting.
5093.16s: Let's go through these conclusions. All right.
5098.04s: Okay.
5099.72s: Hedge funds are indeed deep in a hole have not covered in our trading high volumes and dark pools
5105.24s: and attempt to kick the can down the roll. All this explains the low volume.
5111.32s: And the OTC data post user shows institutions involved at these dark pools do in fact,
5116.28s: home shares of GME they are trading over 100,000 shares they own.
5122.28s: I don't understand this conclusion.
5124.68s: First I said GME is one of the hardest stocks to short right now, but the reason the
5130.52s: bar rate is so low is because there's almost zero demand.
5136.28s: The part that I don't understand this can all be right the fact that hedge funds are deep
5140.20s: in a hole have not covered that I can all see. But this is the part that I don't understand
5146.52s: is trading high volumes and dark pools in an attempt to kick the can. I don't understand the
5152.12s: relationship that they're making here with the volume in dark pools and how that kicks the can.
5157.96s: If you guys know the answer to that I would love to know. I just don't understand that one.
5164.12s: GME isn't insanely hard to bar right now. A very little demand to short it.
5171.96s: Dark pool activity helps us further explain the FDD cycle. Why do we see these spikes in price
5177.48s: and volume every 35-ish calendar days? They've been talking about these cycles for years now.
5190.52s: SEC regulation forced them to cover but why does it keep happening?
5195.24s: They'll make it shorting. Why else there would be this much potency activity?
5199.32s: I agree with that. I think the other thing to
5207.64s: at least highlight from something like this without a doubt is there's other shit that happens
5213.56s: into the 35 calendar day cycle. There's also standard options,
5217.48s: explorations and movement of the underlying that's going to feed into this.
5221.00s: But I absolutely agree with this. They're going to naturally just continue to move things down
5226.92s: down the road. So yeah, I think that that's a completely fair point.
5232.28s: RRTD says that effects price discovery, especially when 80-90% of the trades are in the dark pool.
5237.80s: Yeah, no, no, I don't just agree with that. The part that I'm saying that I don't understand
5242.20s: is I don't understand how the dark pool volume kicks the can down the road. I understand
5248.44s: what dark pools are, how dark pools obfuscate things. And the other thing just to keep in mind is like
5254.36s: dark pool trades still hit the tape. I feel like that's something that a lot of people don't
5258.92s: understand. There's just a delay and it's not that long, typically. So dark pool
5265.16s: trades absolutely do not help price discovery. But it also eventually,
5271.16s: typically pretty shortly thereafter, is integrated into the consolidated tape.
5275.48s: The stuff that really fucks price discovery is internalization. That
5281.72s: butchers price discovery holistically because that stuff will not hit a consolidated tape.
5287.64s: So to me, it's interesting that dark pools, it's probably because the name, the name sounds so
5292.92s: much more nefarious than it actually is. But dark pools are visible to everybody. It's just a
5299.08s: slightly delayed reporting structure and it is combined with the consolidated tape.
5304.04s: Most of the buys go to the dark pool and the cells go to the market. Yeah, but I still
5313.16s: understand that because they both will be integrated into the consolidated tape.
5317.96s: So I don't see how high volumes in dark pools kicks the proverbial
5326.12s: can of open shorts down the road. Like that, I just don't get.
5331.16s: Where Inclity says volume can hide FTDs. If you buy and sell, you can settle the old FTDs so they
5336.76s: can do this in the dark pools. That I totally get. That makes sense. Thank you. That's a perfectly
5343.48s: rational description. So the idea is that not necessarily the fact that it's dark pools,
5349.80s: but that they're transacting to satiate the requirement and then they're subsequently unwinding
5356.12s: to maintain the original position.
5360.12s: Where Inclity says because they do shady shit in the dark pools, spoofing for example,
5363.40s: spoofing is not relegated to the dark pools. Spoofing happens all the time on on broad markets.
5368.44s: And that's more of a high frequency trading thing. So dark pools themselves are no more prone to
5374.68s: something like spoofing them anything else, but on a standard brokerage platform, you're going
5379.00s: to see spoofs all the time. That's just a game played between high frequency traders and market
5385.32s: makers. What DC says visibility doesn't really matter here though. It's about the average retail
5395.64s: traders thinking they're buying shares in a company, but it's actually getting FTD.
5401.16s: That's kind of different. Like those are two different things. The function of a retail
5406.76s: trader buying something is different than the FTD function that's happening. In my opinion,
5412.28s: the big issue with the FTD function is that it is artificially going to suppress price.
5418.04s: And the way that it artificially suppresses price is because these otherwise entities would
5424.52s: be forced to go and purchase the shares to satisfy the short, which increases demand drives price
5431.32s: up. So the fact that that is not happening in the shorts are being maintained. That is a massive
5438.28s: problem.
5442.44s: Warren Clity says, have you read anything about Dr. Trimbath? I think I did. She has a ton of good
5447.88s: info on all the issue work for the DC upcrypt, the DRS process wrote a book about FTD's
5451.96s: naked trinity. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I watched an interview with her. But yeah, your description
5456.68s: for this is completely satisfactory. It makes a ton of sense.
5462.12s: OTC data adds credence to the idea that FTD cycle is getting more and more expensive.
5465.96s: Short short short increasing the positions rapidly passes. I don't disagree with that.
5469.56s: They purposely sit on themselves and are waiting for proposed regulatory rules to take effect.
5473.32s: So the squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system,
5477.00s: shorts are using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly.
5482.52s: Yes. So this would make sense by rapidly trading. The thing that makes this work is not the
5487.48s: fact again that it's dark pools to suppress. This is just the conclusions here are a little
5492.36s: misleading to me because this is the function, rapidly trading between each other. That absolutely
5501.24s: would do it. FDD cycle is persistent, exemplifies nicoturity problem as Dr. Trimbath discussed,
5510.92s: which you guys already highlighted. February rise with as a result of forced coverings, January drop,
5520.04s: these still have large positions. Funds are working in tandem because they're both
5524.36s: too deep and it's futile and just delaying the inevitable activity on GME containing ETFs
5530.44s: demonstrate how desperate they are getting. Yep, I think we've seen that.
5536.36s: Because the other thing that I don't know if it was known at this point in time in here,
5541.88s: but one of the things that was really, really interesting is the ETF creation redemption cycle.
5548.36s: Because that's also literally like a glitch to satisfy FDDs. And that's another massive, massively
5557.32s: abused process as far as I'm concerned. Super interesting. I like this one. Cool.
5570.28s: It is about time for me to hop off, but before we do that, is there anything else that we should
5577.96s: take a look at? I'm down to take a peek at anything else real fast. I need to add my note for where we
5584.76s: left off, which is here. Stop point, 7Ds. But God, our spot where we're going to pick back up from,
5606.76s: all right, let me see what you guys have. Unvaxmas says, do you believe in synthetic shares
5612.20s: and hidden short interest? Yeah, definitely. 100%. Synthetic shares are used all the time.
5618.04s: And synthetic shares are a really cost effective way for them to do things. That's actually what
5621.96s: that other thing we were reading earlier that I posted in the chat is all about. So 100%. It's not
5628.44s: even like, do I believe in it? It's like straight up proven. It's factual. The hidden high-short interest,
5635.24s: I absolutely have suspicions that it's a thing. It's harder for me to prove it, but I absolutely
5643.48s: think it's a thing. So that one is a little bit larger of a leap of speculation on my end,
5651.80s: because I can't discreetly prove it like I can some of this synthetic process. But I absolutely
5657.80s: think it's occurring. I also think anytime that you have a company that is over 100% shorted,
5661.88s: which we absolutely have seen, is fucking crazy. Like that's just fucking crazy.
5668.52s: Burntittie says, synthetic shares are counterfeit shares unless you're a market maker.
5673.24s: I think that's a little bit too big of a leap personally, because retail traders can use synthetic
5679.72s: shares. There's like, there's genuinely use cases for them. You can create synthetic long,
5684.92s: synthetic shorts. Like, it's a viable strategy. Now, to your point, which I fully agree with,
5690.84s: I don't want to demonize synthetics, because synthetics, there's nothing inherently wrong with them.
5697.08s: The problem with synthetics in the context of market making is complete in utter bullshit.
5702.52s: It's literally being used to hide and defer FTDs. So the problem in that process, in my opinion,
5709.08s: is not synthetics, but it's the FTD process and the deferral. And synthetics happen to be a vector
5717.32s: that they've exposed that they can do it through. And again, in my opinion, that's complete madness.
5722.60s: That is complete fucking madness. But it's a fucking unfortunate thing as it is, I suppose. Yeah.
5736.12s: WTDC says trade should be settled. We've had the tech do that for over a decade, but it is
5741.00s: in profitable market plumbing like hedge funds, market makers, brokerages, completely agree with that.
5745.40s: And I also think that it's fucking crazy that and this is in un like, it is the absolute
5753.48s: problem when you have an entire market structure system that is solely cared about liquidity.
5759.48s: Like that being the primary focus is a massive problem because it contorts what policy goes into
5766.92s: effect to then enable liquidity. And sometimes liquidity should dry the fuck up in a natural
5774.28s: process as it should. So I completely agree with that as well.
5782.44s: Rointit he says they're selling shit. They don't own and didn't borrow.
5788.60s: Again, synthetics can be done different ways. So I just I would caution you against demonizing
5795.96s: synthetics because say, for example, as soon as you're integrating options, you still are taking
5802.52s: on a liability depending on what you build. The problem that I have with them is that they're
5809.56s: doing it in the context of trying to cover a position that they have not covered. Like that's
5815.96s: utter and complete bullshit. It literally is bullshit, especially from an entity like
5820.60s: market makers, they should literally be forced to satisfy those positions because it's the only
5826.92s: way that you can maintain legitimacy of the system. So yeah, I completely agree with that element
5832.36s: at the point. I just don't think synthetics are the I don't think synthetics are the demon here.
5838.20s: I think the problem is is the way that they're being used is completely bullshit.
5843.88s: So all right gang, awesome hanging out as per always if you guys need anything, hit me up,
5851.08s: be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
