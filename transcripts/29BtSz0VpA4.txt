0.00s: You ask I answer.
2.24s: We have three questions from Zach.
3.64s: We're going to hit the first one in this video,
5.12s: and it is why are there often large options orders
9.32s: right before closing?
10.48s: I'm assuming to minimize theta decay.
12.92s: Money and off, it's actually not due
14.40s: to that assumption, although it's a great guess.
16.48s: This, however, is a fantastic observation
19.00s: that we see large option orders right before the closing.
21.76s: I'll actually notice this with stocks as well.
24.84s: If we plot a time series of just typical volume,
28.60s: and this is the open, and this is the close,
30.52s: what you'll find is volume typically starts off real hot.
34.72s: And then it kind of trails off into the midday,
38.16s: and then the last hour or so real hot again.
41.64s: And this is for a bunch of different reasons,
43.36s: which we'll talk about.
44.76s: The very first one is the simple auction process.
48.28s: And this is where, when we have specific order types
52.16s: like market on close, or VWOP orders for algorithmic,
56.48s: trading a lot of these are done towards the end of the day.
59.44s: So during this process,
60.52s: they're matching these with counter parties,
62.36s: and that time frame is generally constrained
65.36s: at the beginning slash end of the day.
66.64s: Part of it is a natural self-fulfilling cycle,
71.08s: where these periods tend to be more liquid due
74.00s: to some of these reasons, and then other people
76.72s: say, well, I'm just going to transact
78.76s: during these periods with my larger orders,
80.48s: because other people are doing the same thing.
82.88s: The other thing is that if we have things
85.20s: like earnings releases,
86.52s: or if we have some sort of catalyst,
89.60s: what ends up happening is we want to gain either
93.48s: specific exposure or hedge specific exposure around the event itself.
100.12s: So you wait, because you don't put your trade on earlier
103.12s: in the day, because it has other factors
105.28s: that you're not really trying to trade,
106.84s: you're trying to isolate these effects.
108.32s: And again, this happens both to speculate,
110.44s: and also to hedge during those.
112.04s: Great observation, we will hit the next two,
115.16s: in a follow-up video, being out there, see you later.
