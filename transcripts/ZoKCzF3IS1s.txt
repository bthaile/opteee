0.00s: Build a habit and don't stop. This applies to the primary wealth levers like saving,
6.80s: investing and expanding your income. One of the biggest mistakes people say is like,
11.44s: oh, I'll start investing when I have X number of dollars. Literally fuck that. Start immediately
19.20s: with whatever you can afford. The most important thing early on is not you saving a thousand dollars
25.52s: to invest. It's you building the habit that you value investing. Once you build that habit,
33.12s: sure, then you can start worrying about how to invest optimally, stuff like that. But getting
37.92s: into something like an index ETF, which is what most people do anyways, retirement account,
42.48s: primary brokerage account. The first thing is to build the habit. Don't wait until you have X number
47.68s: of dollars open up a brokerage account and just start the process. Then you can begin optimizing,
53.68s: but the habit's got to be built first. Being all our seal later.
