0.96s: what is quadruple witching and why
3.36s: should you care we're going to go
4.44s: through exactly that I got this DM
6.40s: essentially asking if we could talk
8.52s: about quadruple witching and you know it
10.08s: doesn't take much to get me ready to
12.08s: talk about some options and derivatives
13.80s: so here we go in short it's pretty
18.08s: simple it's when we have multiple kinds
20.56s: of derivatives that expire on the same
23.64s: day so options Futures single stock
26.92s: futures stuff like that I actually made
29.56s: a little table to make it easier to tell
31.88s: and you'll notice there's actually more
32.96s: on here than just quadruple witching and
34.68s: I'll explain exactly why double witching
36.72s: essentially happens monthly and it is
39.32s: not a big impact so you could just
40.96s: essentially drop that off the bottom of
42.60s: your mind it doesn't matter just know
44.52s: it's a thing then there's triple
46.32s: witching this is kind of phased out when
49.52s: we started launching single stock future
52.60s: expirations when this was added it
54.96s: essentially all became quadruple
57.08s: witching so triple witching is Legacy
59.20s: you'll hear people referred to that but
60.96s: really they're referring to quadruple
63.20s: witching and when does it happen it's
66.24s: the standard expiration cycle for
68.56s: derivatives which is the third Friday of
70.20s: the month what months you might ask
72.32s: March June September and December so
76.16s: what's happening here on quadruple
78.52s: witching days which one of them is
80.08s: coming up very soon today's the 19th of
82.40s: June we have stock options stock index
85.44s: options stock index Futures and single
87.84s: stock futures all that expire on the the
90.08s: same day a lot of expirations that all
92.24s: kind of line up with one another the
94.28s: reason why this matters is because a lot
96.96s: of institutional driven Market activity
99.32s: will kick off there will be a lot of
102.72s: transactions that are coming in two
104.96s: different forms we have market makers
107.32s: that are going to be hedging positions
109.44s: coming into expiration for a lot of
111.92s: individual products that may or may not
113.60s: correspond with one another but then
115.60s: you're also going to have the
116.68s: speculators the position holders again
118.76s: on the institutional side
120.52s: that have positions that are closing
122.44s: down that they have to reopen further
124.76s: out in time this actually leads to
126.60s: different kinds of Arbitrage and trading
128.80s: opportunities for more sophisticated
131.00s: Traders which we could do a video on at
132.56s: some point but I want to walk you
134.40s: through most
135.76s: importantly what the impact is to the
138.08s: market it's kind of twofold you'll
140.04s: notice that volume is typically going to
142.32s: go up and you'll notice that volatility
144.64s: tends to spike and then contract again
147.72s: depending on the rest of the broad
149.56s: Market cycle but there definitely is a
152.60s: higher probability of Market volatility
155.16s: starting to kick off so let's take a
158.04s: look at a few things the first thing is
159.36s: I want to show you some data this is
160.68s: from the past
162.76s: 10 years of quadruple witching cycles
166.68s: and if we look in 2023 the dates for
168.88s: these we have March 17th June 16th
171.60s: September 15th December 15th so again
174.56s: you can kind of see a trend there right
176.56s: 16th 15th 17th third Friday of the month
179.44s: so we'll see what date that typically
182.20s: Falls around and then you can see
183.96s: obviously we're just confirming these
185.76s: months so what this is actually looking
188.16s: at is the S&P 500 performance for each
190.68s: of these 5 days before on the day of 5
193.40s: days after I also look at that for the
195.40s: Vex this isn't really designed to be
197.48s: parsed through one by one I've
199.88s: aggregated it for you here and again for
203.44s: anybody that's into patreon you can
205.20s: download these I'll throw a post and
207.00s: then for those that are not you can just
208.12s: grab a screenshot now this is kind of
211.40s: the the summary and what matters a
213.00s: little bit more so you can see again we
214.80s: have those same things the S&P 500 and
216.64s: the vix 5 days before on the day of 5
219.00s: days after we have the average percent
220.88s: move the percent positive moves percent
223.20s: negative moves Max and Min percent moves
226.84s: now the S&P 500 for essentially around
230.08s: the event it doesn't really move that
231.80s: much it doesn't care quite a lot what we
234.92s: do see that is kind of important is the
239.04s: number of positive events for the S&P
242.08s: 500 before is statistically significant
245.36s: 70.83% of the time but this can also be
248.12s: attributed to other things like positive
249.72s: drift so it's not necessarily quadruple
252.72s: witching yields this that's not so much
255.04s: the case and we could do a little bit of
256.48s: a deeper study to control for that
259.04s: hypothesis none of it really matters
261.16s: that much I'm just giving it to you for
262.36s: some general data points then on the day
265.64s: of the S&P 500 actually has more
268.72s: negative days then positive and the
271.24s: average move is
274.24s: 0.38% negative so on the day of we
278.44s: typically see the S&P 500 contract a bit
280.76s: and then 5 days after we actually still
283.88s: have a little bit of a negative skew but
285.76s: overall positive average return again
288.00s: that just means that the positive moves
289.80s: are bigger than the larger occurrence of
293.00s: negative moves so positive drift very
296.68s: large in terms of direct tradable event
299.40s: here the main things would be 5 days
301.36s: before on day of you can come up with a
303.20s: simple hypothesis or you could try to
305.44s: trade the volatility so then you can
307.32s: also take a look again at the vix
309.36s: metrics one thing I notice here that's
311.40s: actually very interesting is 5 days
313.96s: before we see the vix tends to move down
318.16s: and that generally aligns with the
320.56s: normal relationship between the S&P 500
322.92s: and the vix S&P 500 very frequently when
325.24s: it goes up the vix will go down not
326.64s: always there's always exceptions and
328.68s: funny enough there's an excep baked into
330.44s: this if you look on the day even though
334.48s: there are more negative days for the S&P
336.24s: 500 the vix also tends to contract so
340.20s: this very commonly is due to the market
344.08s: is seeing a slightly heightened sense
347.48s: coming into the event potentially then
350.36s: during the event itself it's not
352.52s: necessarily producing a whole lot of
354.16s: fireworks so then volatility also will
357.04s: contract even though the S&P 500 has a
359.16s: very very small down day on average so
363.80s: the impact to you as a Trader is kind of
366.40s: simple you should be aware that it
367.96s: exists your positions likely depending
371.32s: on the position not likely to be blown
373.44s: up because of this this isn't something
375.64s: that should freak you out scare you
377.36s: anything like that you should simply be
379.64s: prepared for increase Market volatility
382.40s: potentially increase in Market volume we
386.04s: also might not want to trade a whole
388.16s: bunch on the day because as volatility
390.08s: tends to increase bid ask spreads will
392.68s: widen out a little bit but again it's
395.04s: not that big of a change so it really
397.88s: doesn't matter a ton the way I look at
400.56s: this is this is kind of like a secondary
402.28s: Force at this point markets have become
404.04s: way more efficient as you go through
405.56s: this data you'll actually see that the
407.84s: impact decreases as we get closer in
410.44s: time so it used to be kind of a bigger
412.12s: deal back in the day fewer expirations
414.28s: bigger deal not so much now still
417.48s: something to be aware of but not a
419.76s: massive driver so as always if there's
421.80s: any other follow-up questions you have
423.04s: on this or want me to take a look at I
424.56s: am happy to be an outlier I'll see you
426.72s: guys later
