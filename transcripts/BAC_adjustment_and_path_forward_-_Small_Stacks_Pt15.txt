1.12s: hey everyone eric here wanted to do a
3.28s: quick
3.60s: update on the small stacks portfolio
6.72s: so in short this is relatively going to
9.60s: be a quick video
10.48s: not much going on but i'm doing my best
13.60s: to
14.00s: try to make these videos as i'm making
16.40s: adjustments hopefully at least same day
18.24s: or within a few days so
20.00s: let's jump over the screen and take a
22.00s: quick look so
23.04s: big change from today is essentially i
25.20s: just took down
26.08s: the bac short puts
29.68s: so in there i was short the 24 puts i
33.20s: got a dollar 22 and i closed them today
35.04s: for a nickel
36.00s: um that was more or less a no-brainer i
38.08s: was essentially going to take it to
40.08s: expiration but once i started seeing a
42.64s: couple
43.44s: down moves after its gap up you know
46.08s: just took it down
47.04s: took the profit in and we'll redeploy
49.36s: the capital once i see something
51.60s: um and then if we take a quick look
54.88s: at the diagonals this is
58.32s: also essentially status quo
61.84s: so let's take a quick look at these
64.16s: products
64.88s: just so that you can kind of see an idea
67.36s: of
68.80s: what i'm seeing in bank of america as
71.20s: you could tell we've had this
72.48s: gap up and then um
75.84s: kind of more inside day here starting to
78.72s: come down a little bit here
80.16s: so really what i was just trying to do
82.32s: is ride out
83.84s: as long as i could to collect as much
86.00s: premium out of it as i could and taking
88.08s: it down for a nickel today
89.36s: like i said it's essentially a
90.56s: no-brainer um
92.64s: so really just after this kind of big
96.00s: up move i wouldn't want to stay in there
98.16s: my basis was
99.36s: you know down here so that was
102.16s: relatively simple
103.52s: straightforward trade and then we look
105.84s: at take a look at kroger
107.92s: right now in there if we pull this back
110.88s: up
111.28s: i am short the 35 calls
115.20s: so we're still way up here on those
118.48s: short calls with my basis
120.40s: which obviously is an idea i'd rather be
122.48s: a little closer to the money but
124.40s: it's just kind of how it goes sometimes
126.32s: with the diagonals you might get a move
128.00s: that slides against you a little bit
130.00s: like we're seeing right here but that's
131.36s: okay
132.24s: so what i'm doing is essentially just
134.40s: leaving those on
135.52s: until either they expire in the money
137.76s: which looks extremely unlikely
140.00s: or until i can take them down for 90
141.92s: plus
143.04s: prop 90 plus profit
146.08s: and that's really all there is in here
149.68s: now the one thing i will
151.04s: highlight in kroger is the fact that i
154.40s: do have two leaps
157.44s: and i'm short only one right now so it's
160.64s: still
161.28s: in uncovered position and i still have
163.68s: the ability to add
165.20s: another leap or i'm sorry at another
168.24s: short call
169.60s: if we start to get some sort of rebound
171.84s: and i can get some additional premium
173.52s: but
174.00s: right now for me it just makes the most
175.84s: sense to hold on to
177.92s: having it at a ratio so that um
180.96s: i can experience a little more upside
183.28s: that's what i'm prioritizing in this
185.68s: and then if we take a look at intel
188.96s: this trade is still doing well
192.48s: um that's kind of the good thing about
194.56s: these diagonals is that things that
196.24s: remain range bound like this
198.24s: tend to stay healthy for us so right now
201.84s: the leap that i have is trading at ten
204.08s: dollars we got in at 10 35
206.08s: so we're essentially at par there and
209.28s: we're short the
210.32s: 20 no 47 call
213.52s: against and that's trading about app
216.32s: parity right now
217.60s: so same price as when i put it on
220.96s: nothing really to be done in here just
223.20s: yet other than
224.24s: simply waiting and allowing i just
226.48s: realized my face is in the way
228.32s: uh there you go and allowing the
231.60s: um the trait to just you know
234.96s: run its course see some theta bleed out
238.56s: um and then kind of going forward from
240.96s: there but
241.76s: with intel obviously i still really like
244.48s: this product long term
246.40s: um and the other thing that i'll
249.04s: definitely note
250.16s: is that we still have a really really
252.40s: good
253.44s: basis in here for our critical strike
256.32s: which is
257.20s: 46 right now so that puts us
260.72s: right in the mix if we take this short
264.00s: call in
264.56s: and look to add another we're really
267.04s: well positioned to collect a bunch of
268.88s: premium being able to sell right at the
270.64s: money
271.84s: so those are the main positions we have
274.32s: right now let's close this off and take
276.00s: a just
276.56s: quick look at the macro view so right
279.84s: now
281.20s: total pnl the portfolio is 11.56 which
284.64s: is
285.20s: uh almost a 19 return the account is
288.40s: doing really well
289.92s: um capital total is 61.56 like i said
294.48s: um just essentially adding on to the 5k
297.36s: so that's
297.92s: that's where we started for those of you
299.60s: that might be joining in
301.60s: and then utilization we're only
304.08s: consuming
305.32s: 23.92 right now which is less than 40
308.00s: utilized so we got cash to use so right
311.20s: now i'm essentially just going to go
312.56s: shopping the reason why
313.76s: i haven't found something just yet is
316.24s: with the market making the moves it has
318.32s: the last few days
319.36s: i'm not not really rushing to get into
322.40s: anything especially because this
324.00s: is if i stopped right now making 19
328.00s: over the course of a year is a good
329.52s: return so i'm not
331.68s: again in any rush to just throw risk out
334.32s: there trying to chase something
335.76s: i'm gonna continue to pick my shots
337.92s: carefully
339.52s: um and you can see the breakdown from
343.20s: which is returning the most diagonal
345.36s: still outperforming which
346.88s: makes total sense it's way more capital
348.80s: efficient and
350.64s: with the credit outstanding as it is
353.04s: right now
354.24s: we stand and make another 121 bucks
356.40s: which is about two percent
357.92s: return on um return on account so
362.48s: overall again it's still looking to be
366.96s: pretty healthy and when we take a look
370.88s: at when we take a look at
375.60s: where we're going forward essentially
377.28s: for the rest of the year i'm gonna
379.52s: continue
380.08s: to try to find longer term plays that i
382.64s: really like
383.84s: and just offering those out whether it's
386.96s: you know the cash that you're put or the
389.28s: diagonals
390.48s: and if you'll notice i'm not trading any
392.32s: verticals whatsoever
393.68s: none of those have come out i'm not
395.12s: really trying to swing trade anything
397.44s: i'm not sitting here um trying to scalp
400.24s: in here
401.44s: and the the reason is is just smaller
403.68s: accounts struggle with that
405.04s: it's really difficult for smaller
406.72s: accounts to maintain a healthy
408.72s: risk profile in those scenarios so
411.44s: that's why
412.32s: i continue to beat this drum of doing
415.20s: our best
416.80s: to trade this small account in a similar
419.84s: way to when you
421.12s: grow your account because right now the
423.76s: most important thing
425.12s: is practicing and developing a skill set
428.32s: this five thousand dollars is not going
430.56s: to turn into a bunch of money
432.48s: now again if we take a look at the
435.12s: return that we achieved
436.64s: in this account if this instead
439.92s: of being a 61
443.20s: 56 account you know in terms of overall
446.64s: capital as soon as you know you start
451.36s: expanding that out if we had something
454.96s: closer to let's say a million dollars
459.44s: all of a sudden that return starts to
461.60s: mean a hell of a lot more
463.84s: instead of it just being you know um
468.00s: thousand bucks in this account it
471.44s: immediately starts to grow and now
473.52s: you're talking something over
475.04s: what 185 000 something like that
478.16s: so the again what we're focusing on here
481.84s: is the skill set
483.28s: and then as you continue to save find
486.80s: you know compound returns in the account
489.68s: find
490.08s: other sources of income that's really
492.16s: what makes this whole investing thing
494.16s: pretty powerful
495.60s: so that about wraps up this session um
498.56s: if anybody's any questions or anything
500.00s: let me know
501.12s: and for i'm probably going to take this
503.84s: through
504.48s: into the new year but i probably will
507.36s: stop
508.08s: this somewhere in january i think most
511.12s: folks
511.52s: more or less get the point now um so
514.08s: it's not really
515.52s: anything earth shattering but with that
517.44s: in mind if there is anything that you
519.68s: want to discuss
521.20s: with this you know with kind of january
523.92s: being the end
525.12s: uh make sure you let me know because
527.44s: i'll end up developing another portfolio
530.40s: like this maybe
531.84s: you know like a midsize or a large size
535.44s: but that's kind of tbd i'll i'll chat
538.80s: with you all and see what
540.08s: you would like to see what would be more
542.00s: helpful for you
543.60s: i think for me what i would like to do
545.28s: is you know just pick a larger account
548.16s: um maybe open up a portfolio and just
551.04s: move maybe like
552.08s: one maybe one mill or like
556.16s: five six hundred thousand dollars
557.44s: something like that and i think
559.44s: that would be helpful because that
561.28s: really is a completely different skill
563.44s: set
564.08s: when you're trading with a larger amount
565.76s: of capital so i think that'd be really
567.20s: helpful
568.16s: to take a look at one of those style
570.32s: accounts as compared to
571.76s: just the micro accounts so if there's a
574.88s: preference there
576.08s: obviously let me know and we'll catch
579.20s: everybody later
