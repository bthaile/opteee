0.66s: I used options to make twenty six
2.64s: thousand dollars last week on the svb
4.98s: bank downfall and I want to walk you
7.38s: through the trades I made same thing I
9.30s: typically do for my trade management
10.38s: videos I want you to see why I did what
12.90s: I did how I managed it how I thought
14.88s: about the positions and so on and so
16.14s: forth so what's up everybody Eric here
17.64s: welcome back to all the outliers let's
19.56s: take a look at some trades so first
22.62s: thing we have here is the product I
25.20s: chose for this trade was XLF and if you
29.88s: know why throw it in the comments below
32.10s: but there is a specific reason why I
33.72s: chose XLF versus something else now for
36.84s: those that don't know if we take a look
39.84s: at sivb which is svb's uh ticker you'll
45.06s: notice that on the 9th of March we fell
49.32s: from 265 down to 100 and it hasn't
52.62s: traded since and there's a bunch of
55.26s: different reasons for that but long
56.46s: story short it was halted and not
58.08s: reopened so even though I wanted to
61.74s: trade
62.90s: civb I was unable to obviously because
66.36s: it was halted so then I decided to take
69.54s: a look at what else is tightly
71.94s: correlated to sivb and the reason why
76.50s: this is such an important note is even
79.14s: though my hypothesis was really centered
82.20s: on SBB and the overall hypothesis is as
85.32s: simple as you think it is I saw the bank
87.96s: failing and I figured I would be able to
90.60s: get in and take a little bit of a ride
93.18s: at least until I could get out there's a
96.78s: lot of momentum with stuff like this and
98.58s: a lot of times it takes a few days to
100.50s: play out and I was getting in on 10
103.02s: March so a lot of the news broke on nine
105.66s: March still developing people are still
107.34s: synthesizing information so I want to
109.50s: walk you through only two of the trades
111.24s: I put on I put on probably maybe close
114.06s: to 14 trades around this event in its
117.30s: entirety but I want to specifically talk
119.28s: about two trades so so
121.50s: as I saw the opportunity here I needed
125.10s: to find something I could trade to gain
126.66s: the exposure but not be just Market
129.30s: exposure I did end up trading broader
131.58s: Market exposure on Monday in the
133.62s: afternoon and then Tuesday Wednesday but
136.38s: that was kind of a follow-on hypothesis
138.66s: my initial hypothesis was that there
141.72s: would be a ton of volatility around the
144.24s: event and that financials would look
146.16s: weak so with that I started coming over
150.00s: here and I wanted to get an eyeball on
153.62s: what opportunities were there in the
157.20s: financial sector so I went into the S P
159.66s: 500 and I was specifically focused down
161.94s: here at Capital markets but also Banks
164.70s: um I wasn't necessarily super concerned
166.44s: about Bank liquidity follow on bank
168.78s: failures that wasn't the the key of My
172.14s: overall trade hypothesis here but I was
174.84s: specifically looking at two things the
177.48s: first one is what was tightly correlated
180.06s: with sivb and then two I had some
183.90s: reversion plays I was looking at the
185.82s: same time so again I'm not going to go
187.38s: super far into the trades but like in
189.30s: Schwab Schwab was one of the few trades
192.18s: that I actually structured a pairs trade
194.22s: to counterbalance all of the risk I had
196.50s: out that was short XLF and this was
199.20s: actually a Long play and it turned out
200.64s: to to work out pretty well but most of
203.94s: what I ended up trading was an XLF in
206.58s: its entirety now I could have done
208.74s: something in the banks themselves or
210.42s: Capital markets themselves but XLF
212.82s: provided enough liquidity especially in
215.34s: a high volatility event so what I want
217.08s: to show you now is XLF not zlf XLF and
222.18s: this is why when we started seeing all
225.66s: of this news breaking notice how far
228.24s: implied volatility skyrocketed it went
231.06s: from trending around uh 18.8 percent for
234.54s: seven day Vol implied ball and it
236.82s: skyrocketed up to 52 so I knew that
240.30s: there was going to be some opportunity
241.80s: in here even though it's a little
243.66s: insulated because it's the entire
245.90s: financial sector it was still exposed
248.64s: enough that this provided a viable trade
250.86s: so now I needed to check the correlation
252.90s: and that's actually what you see here
255.30s: this is how I validated the correlation
257.28s: so if you take a look and I'll come over
260.16s: here actually to make it hopefully just
262.62s: a little bit it easier for you to see
265.46s: but if you take a look at the this is
268.98s: sivb compared to XLF and if you take a
273.18s: look at the correlation for a three day
274.92s: and a five day the three-day correlation
276.66s: is
278.30s: 0.996957 unbelievably high and then the
281.40s: correlation for a five day is
283.70s: 0.9196 also very high I'm looking for
286.68s: something 85 percent plus and then what
289.74s: made me like this even more was the
292.20s: longer term correlations I knew this was
293.94s: going to be a short-term trade but I
295.80s: wanted to see is this a new phenomenon
297.90s: that started to pop in or was this
299.70s: fairly persistent and if we take a look
302.04s: at the 10 day it was
304.56s: um 92 yeah 92 93 and then at the 30 day
308.88s: was 89 I didn't care so much about the
310.80s: 60 and 90 even though those were also
312.72s: very high so the main thing I'm
314.82s: highlighting here is that there was a
317.10s: lot of built-in opportunity and XLF
320.40s: turned out to be kind of the the primary
322.26s: product that I wanted trade so now what
324.84s: strategy am I going to use here well
326.94s: there's a couple things that come to
328.32s: mind and the first thing though is I at
332.94s: the time I was placed in this trade I
334.92s: had no idea how all of this was going to
338.34s: come out in the wash I had no idea so I
341.10s: wasn't comfortable trading short calls
343.44s: now
344.82s: in a scenario like this short calls look
348.06s: very attractive but the risk is not
351.06s: worth it to me even though you have a
352.62s: couple things working in your favor
353.88s: specifically the expansion and
355.32s: volatility
356.70s: um it's the Good short Deltas so on and
358.68s: so forth the other thing is I wanted to
360.72s: trade the velocity and you don't get
362.64s: that with short calls short calls have a
364.92s: capped Max profit so you might get the
367.50s: move in your favor short call payout
369.18s: looks something like that except this is
370.86s: typically flat and as the underlying
373.32s: moves down you hit a Max profit Zone
376.62s: that's not what I wanted so in this case
379.26s: I actually did a few things I ended up
381.48s: shorting XLF but it became hard to
384.18s: borrow and it was expensive so then I
386.58s: also had the long puts and I want to
388.68s: specifically talk about two long put
390.24s: strategies that I had around this I had
393.06s: a bunch of other things at play but this
394.86s: is kind of a really good example on how
397.80s: I like to play
399.32s: extreme moves like this with leverage
402.18s: it's why I use options and there's a
404.82s: specific way I structure these traits so
407.46s: here they are on the 10th of March XLF
411.36s: was trading around 33-ish it was
413.22s: obviously moving all over the place but
414.60s: uh it was around 33. and I bought to
417.48s: open 100 of the 17 March 34 puts at 87
421.92s: cents so what this means is those were
423.96s: like an 88 slash a hundred Delta the
426.36s: Deltas were flying all over the place
427.62s: they were in the money obviously
429.78s: um but yeah they were pretty firmly in
431.52s: the money so it's somewhere around high
433.62s: 80s low 90s and at points when I saw the
436.26s: trade I was at a one Delta before the
437.76s: move this comes out to be an 8 700
440.52s: outlet and then I also bought 400 of the
444.90s: 30 puts at seven cents as you could tell
447.18s: by the price here these were very low
449.10s: Delta 7 Delta and that's a 2800 outlay
452.40s: so what's going on here I'm exposing
454.80s: myself to two different functions of
457.38s: options that I'm very interested in
459.90s: I wait this trade because there's less
464.52s: risk involved and what I mean by that is
467.52s: since it's in the money it's going to be
470.16s: slightly slower in terms of theta Decay
472.56s: if I didn't get the move on Monday but
474.18s: it came Tuesday but as you can tell the
477.06s: trade was entered on 10 March these were
478.86s: only one week long so I was exposing
481.56s: myself obviously to a ton of long
484.14s: volatility that's what I wanted to see
485.88s: but I needed to move quickly so by
489.30s: trading a higher Delta here this is very
491.82s: stereotypical to the way that I buy
493.80s: options anybody that follows the channel
495.54s: knows that I prefer to go further in the
497.76s: money it's more expensive but I start to
500.40s: get a dollar for dollar move faster and
503.76s: that's just because of the Delta so for
505.38s: every one dollar move in XLF in my favor
507.84s: um not paying attention to any changes
509.16s: in volatility but looking at just the
511.44s: Delta if XLF moves a dollar I'm getting
513.90s: a 88 Cent move so it's pretty close now
517.80s: this is the trade that is more important
520.32s: this is what I like to call a kicker and
523.50s: other options Traders call it the same
525.30s: thing but it's exactly what that sounds
526.86s: like I am putting a smaller amount of
530.16s: money but I'm going further out of the
533.10s: money why is this if you know why I'm
535.32s: doing this throw it in the comments
537.00s: below before I answer because there's
539.40s: two specific reasons the first reason is
543.36s: this is a cheap way for me to speculate
546.36s: and what I mean by that is the payout on
548.94s: these options as you'll see in a minute
550.38s: pretty handsome but if you give them
553.14s: just a little bit of Delta meaning these
556.20s: aren't like a two Delta or a one Delta I
558.84s: actually like to Target about a 10 Delta
560.58s: but those were a little too overpriced
562.14s: so that's why I went to a seven Delta
563.94s: but in the scenario it's a cheap way for
567.18s: me to speculate heavily even if this
569.58s: whole thing expires worthless I'm only
571.92s: losing 2 800 I don't care now the other
574.68s: note here is in terms of the management
577.38s: on both of these I'll talk about that in
579.18s: just a second but the second reason is
582.24s: because of gamma if I start to get a
586.32s: move in my favor
588.18s: gamma is gonna pick up rapidly and as
592.14s: gamma picks up rapidly it means I get
594.60s: bigger and bigger Delta much more
596.22s: quickly this is where you get those huge
598.74s: compounding returns in options is when
601.08s: you buy something that's pretty far out
602.88s: of the money and it moves in your favor
604.74s: with velocity the payout is handsome so
608.16s: that is why I staggered two different
611.10s: trades together this was all part of
612.96s: like the same strategy that I was
614.76s: running which was the long puts side of
617.28s: my speculation in XLF
620.52s: so in this case the way I'm managing
623.40s: this trade the trade plan here is I'm
627.06s: willing to lose all of this and the
629.40s: reason why is I acknowledge the fact
631.86s: that I'm trading around a highly
633.72s: volatile event I limit some of my
637.26s: systemic Risk by not trading unsystemic
640.20s: risk Sorry by trading the index ETF and
643.62s: I'm talking about things like something
644.82s: halting and getting stuck with an option
647.58s: that otherwise would be in the money but
649.08s: it's not in the money because it was
650.34s: halted and not reopened before
651.72s: expiration there's squirrely things like
654.12s: that that can happen now the way that I
658.08s: think about these though is it's gone
659.94s: this is an entire speculation amount of
662.22s: money it's gone and the reason why I
664.20s: think about it that way is if there is a
666.96s: big issue with liquidity or something
668.82s: like that you can get stuck so I didn't
671.64s: want to walk into this thinking oh I'm
673.62s: going to be able to pull you know and
675.48s: Salvage the trade especially on these
677.76s: because they move fast
679.62s: now my ideal management plan was these
683.46s: were gonna I was just gonna let these go
684.96s: but if I saw them trade down to
687.60s: essentially
688.74s: um a thousand dollars remaining value
690.42s: and I wasn't getting the move I would
692.70s: have looked at taking them off but this
695.04s: is a small enough amount of money I
696.84s: essentially just wrote this off now this
699.24s: was going to be taken off at a 50 loss
701.52s: if I hit it and if I could but I want to
704.40s: make that abundantly clear when you're
705.96s: trading big events like this there is
708.30s: always the opportunity for things to not
712.26s: work the way that we want to work and if
714.84s: my entire strategy success was
716.94s: predicated on getting out of this at 50
719.78s: it would have been a problem and the
722.28s: reason why it would have been a problem
723.72s: is if for whatever reason I was locked
726.24s: out then my trade falls apart so that's
729.36s: why I have in specifically these highly
732.72s: volatile style trades I'm gonna have two
735.12s: different points I'm gonna have whatever
737.52s: size I put out I am more likely than not
741.48s: going to allow that to be my maximum
743.70s: risk and then I'm going to have my
745.68s: controlled risk portion whereas if I'm
748.50s: able to get out and I'm not seeing the
750.60s: conditions playing out as I thought they
752.28s: were I will pull the trigger and exit at
754.38s: that point that applies very
755.82s: specifically to these and this is also
758.10s: different than how I used to do it when
759.90s: I was rapidly trying to grow my account
761.82s: I would trade on Leverage and that
764.64s: essentially means you have to have risk
766.80s: control and you have to have the ability
768.72s: to get out but the other thing I was
770.40s: always prepared to do in those other
771.66s: scenarios was hedge I would have other
773.76s: products queued up to hedge if I
775.38s: couldn't get out stuff like that I
776.94s: wasn't looking to do all that here so
778.62s: that is why size was my first risk
780.72s: control metric and the second risk
782.40s: control metric was like I said
784.80s: um exiting 50 on these right here and
788.40s: then these I essentially was just going
790.02s: to write them out but if I saw them
792.18s: trading down at a thousand total value I
794.46s: would have exited if I could have to be
796.80s: clear
797.64s: all right so what ended up happening
799.56s: let's take a look real quick
801.60s: at XLF so this is the 10th of March and
805.20s: you can see the way that it ran this is
807.96s: the 13th so this is Monday this is
809.52s: actually when I got out and if you kind
811.44s: of think about it I got out early
812.58s: because I didn't deal with this day but
815.58s: there would have been three other great
817.92s: exit periods based on what I was trading
821.10s: nonetheless I got out and the reason why
824.40s: I got out on Monday is because it made
826.92s: my move when I was thinking about where
829.92s: I want this thing to go I didn't have a
833.40s: specific price Target because when
835.80s: volatility gets injected at that level
838.02s: it's very very difficult to pick a
840.72s: specific price Target especially when
842.40s: you're trading options because you might
843.96s: get to the price Target but then the
845.94s: options might not behaving the way you
847.50s: think that they should but I expected to
850.80s: see a pretty sizable move and I got it
853.92s: to some degree I actually thought I
856.74s: would have seen a little bit more of a
858.18s: move so essentially on Friday we closed
860.40s: at 32.93 and then on Monday we opened at
865.44s: 3176 we hit a low of 31.37 and close at
868.56s: 31.63. so it wasn't like this big giant
871.74s: move but it was enough because I also
874.20s: got this beautiful implied volatility
876.42s: accommodation so here's what ended up
879.00s: happening those 34 puts so these ones
881.94s: right here that I bought for 87 cents or
884.88s: 87 per contract I sold for 232.
888.66s: so that comes out to be about 145
890.70s: dollars per contract I had 100 contracts
893.58s: and this is a 167 percent return on
897.54s: invested Capital beautiful trade the
900.60s: second trade here is I sold to close
902.64s: these 30 puts these are the these are
904.98s: the cool ones because this is how
906.30s: options work
907.92s: um I bought those for seven cents sold
910.26s: them out for 38 cents doesn't seem like
911.94s: a bunch of money it's only 31 dollars
913.38s: per lot but again I had a bunch of them
914.94s: 400 contracts so that represents a 443
918.84s: return on invested Capital those kind of
921.96s: moves obviously they always look really
924.90s: cool because it's like wow seven cents
927.12s: to 38 cents a 443 return on invested
930.96s: Capital what a great return and as a
933.84s: just return basis that is a good return
935.88s: but the problem is is a lot of people
937.98s: unless you trade those at size
940.50s: really walking out with bunch of money
942.12s: which you'll see in a second it was okay
944.10s: but it wasn't you know what you might
946.50s: expect for something that shows up 443
948.42s: return of S capital what I mean by that
950.16s: is I mean 14 500 on the 34 puts and I
954.42s: made 12 400 on the um 30 puts so it's
959.22s: good but it's still not as good as
961.02s: something that was deeper in the money
962.52s: and cost more money on the initial
964.02s: outlay but nonetheless it was a great
966.84s: kicker because I only had to put 2800
969.36s: bucks out so this is why I really like
971.94s: combining these two strategies if you
974.34s: get a big enough accommodating move it
977.58s: can be very lucrative especially
979.62s: if you trade the low Delta options at
982.44s: leverage however if you don't get that
985.80s: move there's a high chance that this
988.20s: just evaporates which is why I like to
990.72s: tie this in because more often than not
993.00s: if I'm trading speculative Direction via
995.34s: long options I will go in the money and
997.68s: then something at or out of the money
999.60s: and even if the out of the money options
1002.18s: start to Decay away and they're not
1004.10s: really doing what I need them to do fast
1005.54s: enough the in the Money Trade typically
1008.36s: as long as I get a little bit of
1009.80s: accommodation they typically will at
1011.90s: least cover the cost of the speculative
1014.06s: outlay at least not always but that's
1016.88s: part of the overall plan here so it came
1018.86s: out to be in 11 500 outlay with a twenty
1022.94s: six thousand nine hundred dollar return
1024.02s: it's a 234 percent return on invested
