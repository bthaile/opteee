 What's up everyone we're on the mobile setup figured expiration day time to take a look at game stop and see what's going on and I think to everybody's delight we are above 30 and for those while I think everybody has to be aware of by now but we also did get a visit from the cat. He popped out on 25 December what time did he post this at 0 7 am so again that I don't know if that's a scheduled post or just like him being very very specific with his timing but he posted this and as per usual I have no idea what it means it seems like maybe just Christmas post but lots of people are digging in I saw people posting the the polar hex codes and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to try to figure out what that might mean so if you have a theory on what this is I actually would love to know because I don't know and actually let's poke through this really quick since trending and let's see what everybody says oh it's because it's above 32 which is great. I'm sure this is talking about black rock adding so it looks like everybody stout that we're above 30 which is absolutely great love that. Yep perfect and this is one of the things we talked about truly on one of our recent live streams because game stop here is really interesting to me because I know a lot of people thought that the 30 handle was going to be a bit of a challenge for it and it blew right through it and it's been steady above 30 ever since 23 December it's been steady steady steady then even on the down tick today although a really big candle meaning the the wicks are big people are battling over price it's still a very small body inside move and we cracked 32 so it wasn't even pushed down below 32 which is pretty interesting and we expected some of this because the post roaring kitty pop from his post on Christmas which I genuinely do believe that's probably one of the larger catalysts here and the reason for this move both the mix of retail participants and then also probably algos getting involved and as we've seen before because we've seen when he posted that stuff about chewy and what not I mean as soon as he posts there's millions of volumes in seconds so there's just that's not retail that's way too fast and today on the down tick post it really hung within the shadow of the prior candle which is pretty interesting to me because this means that even though this had a pop based on that as a catalyst the market is still kind of respecting it and it's not being rejected all the way back down. So if we take a look at a RSI so this is using RSI along with a seven day moving average we can see that RSI is at 6155 and it's still above the moving average and the moving average is a seven day VWO moving average so these are pretty effective for detecting downside to when it's used to build and the moving average is still upward sloping. VALTILITY is still very high 62% and if we zoom this out to a year we can see a few things. The main thing is there is a beast of a volume node now built at 2837 that range there so this becomes like the new floor for GameStop provided that there's not some sort of massive new information that changes the fundamentals of the company this becomes like the accepted fundamental value floor of a company because it's been transacting at this level for at least a month now and it's not been pushed down even with its earnings it definitely had a bit of a down tick but it performed okay during earnings because of interest earned on the cash toward it sitting on so really really strong performance from GameStop that's what I see here the fact that we're going on this and it kept it and it's still hanging above 30 it does look like 30 starts to become the next handle to beat we can see there's two volume profiles there's one here 28 36 or I'm sorry volume nodes on the volume profile then there's another here 2888 but this 30 handle looks to be pretty well respected now let's take a look at the options and really high near term vol short term vol is dips a lot and then we see it picking way back up on 17 jam and a big reason that you see the 17 jam volatility like that is because there are a lot of options there so right now there's 800 92 thousand calls against 280 thousand puts and if we take a look at that 17 jam literally half 428 thousand balls are in the January expiration so January is going to be spicy as it comes up now if we take a look at today's expiration first off this is like the first time in a long time we didn't have to pour one out for the 30s that expired out of the money and they're in the money and actually happy here we can also see that the market had a cough up for the 31s because another 7000 were added so that means there's another at least 1000 added on top of this and then take a look at the volume on the 32s 24,700 against 7960 so that means is the overwhelming majority of this volume today was stacked onto these 30s use and that kind of buying activity by the market makers likely is a contributing factors to why price held so strong that it did because with that amount of volume coming in at the money on expiration day that forces essentially direct hedging activity in the open market in order to to be able to cover these positions for those that are going to take assignment on the shares now again a lot of people will probably flatten out their positions to capture the profit but there's a lot of people that will be taking shares at 32 which looks really interesting to me so now let's go out to 3 Jan really quick and see what's going on here so it's 62k against 14 so 3 Jan is also really really stacked on the call side 10 Jan 21 K against 4700 less so and let's take a look at volatility and see if we still have this standard let's look at the out of the money specifically and I want to look and see if we have calls queue we don't on 3 Jan we don't on 10 Jan and we don't on 17 Jan so that's a little bit different that we have now puts queue dominating a little bit more there's the call skew finally 7 fed pretty heavy call skew by the way and then same thing here and again a quick reminder why I look at this call skew because it lets me see where the market is pricing in movements so when I see heavy call skew to the upside it means that the market is expecting larger upside moves which is why it prices those options more expensively because that's where the expectation is so it's not until a bit further out in time 17 April and then it's so it's essentially from that period on that we see the call skew which was what 7 fed interesting so the market is definitely going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more expensive so it's going to be a little bit more and then they should get a motorcycle course which is going to be expensive now what's going to be listed as going to be a little bit more expensive now like we can see on those 32s that ended up expiring in the money. So really, really interesting. Now, I also wanted to take a look at two other things. Thing is the general options flow that we saw for this past week. So we can see a few things that kind of stuck out to me. The first thing is there were a handful of wave further out in time, massive puts being traded coming in at the offer. So these are people buying puts in the 120 expiration way out in 2026, $908,892,450. This is probably the same entity that's building into this position that would be my guess. But I mean, this has gone on a little while now. We've seen this, these puts being tacked out here. Again, you can see being transacted at. So that's something I've been keeping an eye on. There's a lot of different reasons why that can be a target for people. It can be used for broader folial purposes, depending on the entity and what they're holding. It can be done for directional speculation. So there's a lot of different ways that this can be used even to help with locates as part of synthetic positions we've seen now coming up a little bit more. So the size of these is interesting just because it doesn't represent a lot of shares. And when you're trying to use stuff for like locates and stuff like that, you wouldn't necessarily want to go out this far in time. And this isn't that big of a position. So if you're trying to acquire locates for a 50 lot, it's just really, really small shares in order to do that. So it, to me, seems more of a speculative directional play as far as I can see. And those are like the biggest trades that I saw come through. I always sort this by premium. And there wasn't a ton on the call side except we did have the 15s also out in 2026. And you can see that this is still over half a million dollars between these two positions, two minutes apart, probably the same entity. I would feel pretty confident guessing at that. And then the other thing I wanted to take a quick look at is Max Payne. And you can see that Max Payne today was 2950. And we definitely closed deep within Max Payne again, Hooverminder, Max Payne does move throughout the day. But my guess is a lot of the hedging activity was probably done by the market makers propped the stock up a little bit more today because they had to acquire a lot with those 20,000 plus contracts coming through. That's not an insignificant amount. So really, really strong day for GameStop, even though the broader market was down extensively, GameStop had a generally inside day which on a relative basis in the cage strength, there was down just 2.39%, which is pretty solid. So as always, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
