0.00s: Let's up everyone. We're on the mobile setup, figured expiration day, time to take a look at
5.68s: game stop and see what's going on and I think to everybody's the light. We are above 30.
13.96s: And for those, well, I think everybody has to be aware of by now, but we also did get a visit
21.04s: from the cat. Key popped out on 25 December. What time did he post this at? 0 7 AM. So
29.24s: again, I don't know if that's a scheduled post or just like him being very, very specific
34.60s: with his timing, but he posted this and as per usual, I have no idea what it means. It seems,
42.60s: like maybe just Christmas posts, but lots of people are digging in and I saw people posting
48.12s: the the holer hex codes and then trying to figure out what that might mean. So if you have a
55.80s: theory on what this is, I actually would love to know because I don't know. And actually, let's
60.44s: poke through this really quick. It's trending and let's see what everybody says. Oh, it's because
64.60s: it's above 32, which is great. This person is talking about black rock adding. So it looks
75.00s: like everybody's stoked that we're above 30, which is absolutely great. Love that. Yep, perfect.
81.32s: And this is one of the things we talked about, truly, on one of our recent live streams,
89.16s: because GameStop here is really interesting to me because I know a lot of people thought that the
95.24s: 30 handle was going to be a bit of a challenge for it and it blew right through it and it's been
103.16s: steady above 30 ever since 23 December. It's been steady, steady, steady. Then even on the down
109.96s: tick today, although a really big candle, meaning the the wicks are big people are battling over price.
116.28s: It's still a very small body inside move and we cracked 32. So it wasn't even pushed down below 32,
125.56s: which is pretty interesting. And we expected some of this because the post-roaring kitty pop
132.68s: from his post on Christmas, which I genuinely do believe that's probably one of the larger
139.40s: catalysts here. And the reason for this move, both in mix of retail participants and then also
145.32s: probably algos getting involved. And as we've seen before, because we've seen when he posted that
151.00s: stuff about chewy and whatnot, I mean as soon as he posts, there's millions of volumes and seconds.
156.92s: So there's just that's not retail. That's way too fast. And today on the down tick post, it really
165.48s: hung within the shadow of the pirate candle, which is pretty interesting to me, because this means
170.68s: that even though this had a pop based on that as a catalyst, the market is still kind of respecting it
176.36s: and it's not being rejected all the way back down. So if we take a look at a RSI, so this is using
185.48s: RSI along with a seven day moving average, we can see that RSI is at 61.55.
193.72s: And it's still above the moving average. And the moving average is a seven day
197.56s: V-watt moving average. So these are pretty effective for detecting downside, but someone
204.20s: it still looks to build. And the moving average is still upward sloping.
208.28s: Also, it's still very high, 62% and if we zoom this out
215.96s: to a year, we can see a few things. The main thing is there is a beast of a volume node now built
223.96s: at 2837 that range there. So this becomes like the new floor for a game stop,
231.88s: provided that there's not some sort of massive new information that changes the fundamentals of the
237.80s: company. This becomes like the accepted fundamental value floor of a company, because it's been
243.80s: transacting at this level for at least a month now. And it's not been pushed down even with its earnings.
250.84s: It definitely had a bit of a down tick, but it performed okay during earnings because of interest
256.52s: earned on the cash court it's sitting on. So really really strong performance from games,
262.60s: that's why I see here. The fact that we're going on this and it kept it and it's still hanging
267.88s: above 30. It does look like 30 starts to become the next handle to beat. We can see
274.04s: there's two volume profiles. There's one here at 2836 where I'm sorry volume nodes on the volume
279.80s: profile. Then there's another here 2888, but this 30 handle looks to be pretty well respected. Now let's
287.40s: take a look at the options and really high near term wall. A short term wall is dips a lot and
299.64s: then we see it picking way back up on 17 Jan. And a big reason that you see the 17 Jan
306.60s: volatility like that is because there are a lot of options there. So right now there's 890,000
314.36s: calls against 280,000 puts. And if we take a look at that 17 Jan literally half 428,000
322.52s: calls are in the January exploration. So January is going to be spicy. Is it comes up? Now if we take a
330.60s: look at today's exploration first off, this is like the first time in a long time, we didn't have to
337.08s: pour one out for the 30s that expired out of the money and they're in the money and actually happy
342.12s: here. We can also see that the market had a call for the 31s because another 7,000 were added.
349.56s: So that means there's another at least 1000 added on top of this and then take a look at the
353.64s: volume of 32s 24,700 against 7960. So what that means is the overwhelming majority of this
363.24s: volume today was stacked onto these 32s and that kind of buying activity by the market makers
371.40s: likely is a contributing factor as to why price held so strong that it did because with that amount
376.68s: of volume coming in at the money on expiration date that forces essentially bit direct hedging
382.36s: activity in the open market in order to be able to cover these positions for those that are
387.56s: going to take a Simon on the shares. Now again, a lot of people will probably flatten out their positions
393.24s: to capture the profit. But there's a lot of people that will be taking shares at 32 which looks
401.64s: really interesting to me. So now let's go out to 3 Jan really quick and see what's going on here.
408.44s: So it's 62k against 14. So 3 Jan is also really, really stacked on the call side. 10 Jan, 21k against
415.96s: 4700 less so. And let's take a look at volatility and see if we still have this standard.
424.76s: Let's look at the out of the money specifically. And I want to look and see if we have call skew.
429.56s: We don't on 3 Jan, we don't on 10 Jan and we don't on 17 Jan. So that's a little bit different
437.16s: that we have now put skew dominating a little bit more. There's the call skew finally 7 Fed
443.56s: pretty heavy call skew by the way. And then see anything here. And again a quick reminder of why I
448.44s: look at this call skew because it lets me see where the market is pricing in movements. So when I see
455.24s: heavy call skew to the upside it means that the market is expecting larger upside moves,
462.04s: which is why it prices those options more expensively because that's where the expectation is.
467.48s: So it's not until a bit further out in time, 17 April and then it's so it's essentially from
472.60s: that period on that we see the call skew which was what some Fed. Interesting. So the market is
478.84s: definitely pricing in further dated upside moves. But just not super near term. Volume today,
487.88s: 247,000 calls can spend 56,000 puts massive call volume a lot of call sales, which makes sense
496.12s: people closing their calls at a profit because there is pretty significant profit taking up
501.08s: toonities. Most of the volume as expected would be for today, 27 December, that's people
505.88s: either closing positions rolling them out or building new positions like we can see on those 32s
512.36s: that ended up expiring in the money. So really, really interesting. Now I also wanted to take a look at
517.56s: two other things. The general options flow that we saw for this past week. So we can see a few things
529.00s: that kind of stuck out to me. The first thing is there were a handful of wave further out in time
537.88s: massive puts being traded coming in at the offer. So these are people buying puts in the 120
545.80s: expiration way out in 2026, $980,000, $892, $450. This is probably the same entity that's building
556.28s: into this position that would be my guess. But I mean, this is going on a little while now. We've
561.08s: seen these puts being tacked out here. Again, you can see being transacted at. So that's something
568.12s: I've been keeping an eye on. There's a lot of different reasons why that can be a target for people.
576.12s: It can be used for broader folio purposes depending on the entity and what they're holding.
583.08s: It can be done for directional speculation. So there's a lot of different ways that this can be used
589.40s: even to help with low-cates as part of synthetic positions we've seen now coming up a little bit more.
595.80s: So the size of these is interesting just because it doesn't represent a lot of shares. And when
601.72s: you're trying to use stuff for like low-cates and stuff like that, you wouldn't necessarily want to go
605.24s: out this far in time. And this isn't that big of a position. So if you're trying to acquire
611.32s: low-cates for a 50-lot, it's just really, really small, in order to do that. So to me, seems more of a speculative
624.60s: directional play as far as I can see. And that was really the biggest trades that I saw come through.
631.72s: I always sort this by premium. And there wasn't a ton on the call side except we did have the
637.88s: 15s also out in 2026. And you can see that this is still over half a million dollars between these two
645.00s: positions, two minutes apart, probably the same entity I would feel pretty confident. Guessing at that.
651.56s: And then the other thing I wanted to say good quick look at is Max Payne. And you can see that Max Payne today
656.52s: was 2950 and we definitely closed deep within Max Payne again.
662.60s: Boomerminder. Max Payne does move throughout the day. But my guess is a lot of the
668.12s: hedging activity was probably done by the market makers, dropped this stock up a little bit more today,
673.40s: because they had to acquire a lot with those 20,000 plus contracts coming through.
679.40s: That's not an insignificant amount. So really, really strong day for a game stop,
684.52s: even though the broader market was down extensively, a game stop had a generally inside day
691.24s: which on a relative basis indicates strength. There was down just 2.9% which is pretty solid.
696.84s: So as always, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know, be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
