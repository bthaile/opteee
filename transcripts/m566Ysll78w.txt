0.00s: Got it. All right. What is up everybody? So I am super stoked. I got Tobi here. He is calling in. You're in Denver. You said?
8.00s: Yes. I mean, never. Thanks for having me by the way. Perfect.
10.88s: Yeah. Absolutely. It's it's an absolute pleasure to have you on. I have a chance to go through your Twitter a little bit as I do and stock people.
18.56s: And you have a lot of really interesting perspectives, especially as it comes to kind of like a just macro market discussions and some of the other things that we're just kind of doing a preamble to some of the precious metals.
30.48s: Topics and things like that. So I'm looking forward to diving into those with you for sure. But first off, welcome to the channel.
38.08s: Thank you. Yep. Second off, I would love to start with just a little bit of your background. So I saw that you're from what's up, Paul?
46.96s: Yes. I was born and raised in Brazil, lived in the state of Sao Paulo for until my age of 20, I guess 19.
57.52s: Then I moved to the west to play tennis in college. And then the rest is history. I guess I've been here for for some time now.
65.68s: Yeah, man. So did you do Jiu Jitsu while you were there? No, believe it or not, I am probably the only Brazilian who doesn't know how to do Jiu Jitsu or play soccer very well. So.
78.32s: What? Yeah. So I train a lot at Victory MMA down here in San Diego. I'm in San Diego. And the grappling coach there is Dean Lister who spent a lot of time in Brazil. So he talks about, you know, just growing up there and whatnot. So I had to ask. But all right, maybe we can convert you into Jiu Jitsu. You know, I'm hopeful. I would love to.
100.80s: It's so fun. It's physical chess is what it comes down to you right now. I'm like 235 pounds. Like I mean, you're really strong. But I've never felt like such just a whos compared to like some of these 160 pound dudes that are just so well versed. That's why I love Jiu Jitsu because you could be strong, but it's very, very mental.
122.56s: Well, I am the huge fan of MMA and UFC. I'm not going to lie. So you're already there. Yeah.
129.92s: I just can't do anything on in terms of that, but certainly watch it a lot.
135.88s: Yeah. Well, good. Jiu Jitsu is a perfect entrance into that. There's no like face punching and stuff. So it's a gentle intro.
144.52s: I need that. Yeah, exactly.
147.32s: So you came to the US. Was it was it the US for college, you said?
153.52s: Yes. So I moved to Liberty University in Virginia. I was recruited play tennis in college. I played tennis, started playing tennis when I was 14 and then when I was 18 or 19.
167.68s: I was started to move or look for universities in the US. I knew there was ways of getting scholarships here.
176.08s: To play sports and then perhaps get education in a cheaper way than in Brazil and also learn English and so forth.
186.16s: And I was I always loved the American culture. And so it was a very easy move when he comes to that and you know, I fell in love with it.
195.96s: And I'm still I'm still here. Yeah, that's awesome. So talk to me about how you got kind of started in the finance space.
204.28s: It's it's stuff to pinpoint exactly when it all started, but I think I've always been, you know, I've always seen money as as a not so much as as a glorious way of showing off people, but more as a security and safety feature of my life, given the fact that when I was 13 or 14 maybe yeah, 14.
228.44s: My dad had his own business. He was very successful. He did very well, especially in the 90s and early 2000s and and then things turn south and when things turn south.
241.68s: Whereas you know, I was I was a teenager and I was very difficult to see everything, you know, just literally going from everything to nothing. And so for me, I always helped him in many different ways of being very dynamically.
258.24s: And so I was really involved in his business along with my parents and my mom as well. And so the entire family had really get together to go through that pain of of a downturn economically and financially.
271.24s: So after that, I think of how has been fascinated by financial markets and I think in college was really when I started to read a lot about finance and read a lot about the economy and then I started investing my own money and loss of money and that was part of a lot of experience in that period started to move forward and really I mean, I remember back in college.
300.24s: I was just I had very good grades and I was studying for a business administration, but I was I was really not too focused on college as much as focus on learning about finance and I loved it. I mean, I just think the strategy side of it is is one of the most fascinating things of this industry and figuring out the markets is going to be an endless learning curve that I think, you know, I mean, I wake up every day.
327.24s: I'm extremely fortunate for the job that I have and I'm always happy to be part of this. But then let's see, I think when I move to Colorado after college, I actually met Kevin in a tennis court. Kevin is the CIO and founder of Crasuke Capital.
346.24s: After working in finance and other as an intern in other places, I really started working with them and got most of his principles when he comes to approach of investing and learning about quant models, which he always used a lot of his proprietary quant models in order to run or really manage capital.
371.24s: So I began to learn from him and started to apply the same principles in macro. And so that is when I started to really really add value to, I think, to to Crasuke and this is this was kind of the beginning of me going from an analyst to a portfolio manager and then starting sharing some of my research to the rest of the world.
398.24s: A lot, a lot of things, a lot of turns in that in, you know, I'm just telling you the very short story, but that has been a lot that happened in that period. But now after what 11 years maybe I've been, you know, with Kevin now working pretty, you know, pretty good relationship with him and now Quentin Haney as well. So the company has grown. The fund is now we're managing
423.24s: some more close to 300 million dollars of capital today. So a lot of things have changed since the beginning. I mean, we went from a 50 million, you know, AUM to a 300 million AUM in the course of three to four years.
438.24s: So things have gone a lot of a lot of big changes in my life. And I think in the whole companies, you know, since the beginning of it, I think we've done a lot of changes.
450.24s: And so very happy and very proud of it. And now as a partner, now my goal is to continue to grow here and make this one of the best macro shops in the world. That's the whole goal.
465.24s: That's awesome, man. So I want to talk to you a little bit about a Crescat. But before that, you said something that really, really resonated with me because it was, I don't know, just a perspective that I've never really thought much about. And you were talking about that you had, you know, your dad was very successful in business.
485.24s: And the economic downturn, you know, is really where you all went through like this adjustment period. And I'm just personally curious about that because I find like most of my circle that I know most of us came from almost an inverse where we started like I had a single mom who was working two jobs trying to keep the lights on essentially.
509.24s: So we kind of started from not quite the bottom, you know, it's not that bad, but definitely a more impoverished state. I am just very, very interested to understand just I don't know what that transition was like for you all when you know your dad had this really successful business. And then the out external forces, right, the market at large started to negatively impact that you were talking about some of those adjustments and whatnot.
535.24s: I'm just really curious like your thoughts about that time period and how that has fueled the rest of your trajectory in the finance space. I know you said it got you interested, but you know, just again from a personal perspective, curious about that cycle in your life.
550.24s: Well, I think, you know, first of a wealthy or emerging wealthy family in Brazil would be considered perhaps in international standards more of middle class, especially in the US, but not sure what is worth what's worse is if it's you starting from zero or starting from something and then go into zero when you were 14 15.
576.24s: I think I haven't done the other side of it. So I'm not sure, but that was painful for the age and not being really knowing how to how to behave in such a set up nature. But for me, I think there are there were a lot of lessons that happened back then.
593.24s: Number one is the lesson of leveraging up when when you were against a secular trend. So basically, well, my dad, I think there was a lot of lessons and one of the mistakes was you started with a retail business that was doing very well.
609.24s: And what and then basically we started to see Chinese Chinese products being imported to date to Brazil, or imported to Brazil, reducing his margins.
621.24s: And then we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started
651.24s: to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to be one.
681.24s: we had nice cars, we had to sell everything and go from there to driving the worst cars.
688.36s: And so, you know, going from the best schools to the worst schools and being a tennis player
693.32s: where it's a very rich kind of sport in Brazil, meaning only wealthy people play in
700.44s: not being able to afford play in tennis anymore. So, or through all that it was brutal.
706.44s: But certainly, it's definitely necessary. And now my dad is doing very well.
711.08s: I think they were just fine. And so, just the rest is history.
716.12s: That's, I honestly, I think that's worse than like what I grew up with because I think, yeah,
722.76s: it's really what I like that. I do not need to say what's what's
726.12s: what's not at all. Not at all. It just, I for my mind, I was like really empathizing
732.92s: with that experience because I think the part to me that would make it so devastating
738.36s: is obviously your dad had risked so much even to get to that point. And then to have this huge
746.12s: unwinding essentially of all of it, like that to me is just that's devastating. So, I mean, I can't,
753.72s: I mean, and then your dad obviously just kind of bootstrapped it, right? Like he decided,
758.28s: okay, okay, well, we got to make some changes here and we'll get back together. And you said he's
761.96s: doing great now. It's just that's a really inspirational cycle because that's tough. That's one of the
767.24s: biggest issues I think people have with taking risk is that they're scared of that so they don't
772.92s: take the risk. But you have somebody like your dad that took the risk got hit along the way,
777.80s: but able to turn out of it and kind of emerge. And like to me, that is the true focus of that story.
782.92s: That's incredible. Yeah, I mean, if I always make sure I wasn't good, you know, good education in
788.36s: Brazil, I always had very good. I was always attending good places in terms of learning from
795.08s: different people. And that was always, I think, a key part of building up, you know, this foundation
803.56s: to where we are today. However, yeah, it messes with you, especially psychologically. And
811.00s: it's incredible that my parents' marriage went through all that and they really got together
819.88s: and things were fine. But it was not key. So awesome. It's very challenging. And now it's
828.36s: like it's just like putting on a trade that you're taking on too much leverage and then things
834.36s: don't go the way you expect it. And you know, where do you go? So it's tough.
839.16s: That's well, thank you for sharing it like sincerely. Thank you for sharing that story because
842.84s: it's like that I haven't I've never personally thought about that cycle before. So that was actually
849.16s: kind of interesting to explore that a little bit with you. And it really is kind of motivating to
854.68s: hear, you know, your dad was able to just face the risk, got hit by it, but then when past it,
860.52s: like that's I think just really, really cool. So then you, you know, we fast forward and now you're
869.32s: at Crescat. You kind of started there and talked to me about just what Crescat is all about,
878.68s: you know, you reference more that as kind of a macro focus. Like I said, I had a chance to go
883.88s: through your SEC filings and stuff like that. But just for, you know, the elevator pitch version
889.64s: for everybody else, what what are you guys all about? Well, I guess learning lessons from what
896.20s: happened when I was younger, I think the biggest goal of the firm has been nailing and figuring out
901.32s: identifying the big secular trends and being in front of them and really trying to capitalize
906.44s: from them as best as we can. And so we started from a macro perspective. We built models and different
912.92s: tools in order to help us to get to those views. We are also using a lot of value principles of
921.08s: value investing and and really figuring out what are the best ways of expressing those views when
927.16s: it comes to what are the companies we should be purchasing and are selling short and so forth.
932.60s: So it's really a mix of global macro with value principles where we use proprietary tools in order
939.72s: to reach to those conclusions. And so we also bring expertise when we think it's time to be
946.68s: branching out and and and and starting and whole new strategy. So precious metals is a great example
952.84s: when 22, 2018 we thought this was kind of the right time to be investing in precious metals and
961.88s: we launched a new strategy and that was the separate managed account of precious metals. And
967.08s: and then later on we launched the hatch fund and this was where we bought a partnership with
972.44s: Quentin Henney, a geologist to help us navigate the space. And so it's sort of, we do a lot. I mean
979.24s: it's you know it's like a question we get the most hot you guys do it all. You know what I mean
984.20s: certainly starts from macro and you know as we it's it's great when you have various unbiased
990.76s: ways of validating your thesis. And so in a lot of ways I think you know the precious metals and
998.68s: the commodities companies now all score really well in our in our quant models are fundamental
1004.44s: equity models. And so you know that is completely unbiased and just happens to be the case that
1010.04s: also envelop very bullish on tangible assets and and commodities as a whole. And so you know a lot
1017.56s: of so basically I think was the idea was figuring out that the quant models that Kevin was building
1022.68s: back in the days was leading him to macro views. And so we kind of swaffer and started using the
1029.32s: macro models to then confirm those views along with the the the fundamental equity models. And
1036.28s: that really helps. And so we were able to build a very diversified portfolio with a lot of
1043.56s: you know big macro themes and then we have sub themes within those those big ideas.
1049.96s: And you know our goal is to find out what are the best ways of expressing those and that's
1056.28s: that is an ongoing conversation on the daily basis. And per full it was always changing. So
1062.36s: it's a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah. So what are some of the like common products that you guys like
1071.08s: if you can look at? Okay. So large cap it was when Kevin started. So we're one of the few funds
1077.48s: that go back to the 90s. And so large cap is our long only strategy that was basically built
1084.20s: by selecting companies part of this fundamental equity model. This scores the most liquid
1091.48s: companies all over the globe. And we only buy the ones that score at the best and that rank change
1097.64s: on a daily basis. And it helps us to manage risk. Okay. But that's one strategy. And then in 2000
1105.24s: we launched the long short. And this was Kevin Smith at the time who was running this.
1110.76s: The long short is is you know very few long shorts go back to 2000. It was launched back then
1116.36s: because he was very concerned about the equity markets. And he wanted to be flexible and able
1122.52s: to short stocks at that time. And then in 2006 most of the actually the equity model was telling us
1131.40s: that we should be short most of the home builders and some of the banks in the US. And so that
1136.92s: opportunistically speaking he was like well I guess it's a maybe a great time to be launched
1142.68s: in a global macro fund that gives us even further flexibility to now purchase outside of equity
1149.48s: only instruments. We can buy you know affects we can buy commodities and you can really express
1156.92s: any of your macro views in any way you would like to. And so that was the beginning of the global
1161.56s: macro in 2006 and absolutely nailed the housing bust. And then and then you know from there
1169.16s: it did other things such as the oil markets when things turn south or when we had the commodities
1175.72s: boom market in 2011 or 2010 and 2011 or we've had shorts in the Chinese markets back in 2015-16.
1188.12s: So a lot of themes that played out in our favor since then and in 2018 given the fact that we're
1194.52s: so bullish on precious metals we decided to then launch a precious metals focus fund. And then by
1201.00s: diving into that industry we figure out as well and we thought that the the best way to be expressing
1206.60s: that idea was to be buying with everyone else is not buying which is exploration assets. And so
1213.08s: the majority of the industry is really most of the capital has been sucked into the big minors. And so
1221.08s: you know there's a lot of issues that we can get into from a macro perspective of why we think
1226.44s: the exploration assets are going to be outperforming the entire industry. But that's really a macro trend
1232.68s: that we think you know we'll play it out in the following years when it comes to gold and silver prices
1238.04s: moving higher and allowing those companies to do very well. So I think that gives you a sense of
1243.96s: of how we're basically positioned right now. Yeah definitely and I think that's a great recap. I
1250.28s: can tell that you're pretty familiar with running through that stuff because that's very polished.
1254.12s: So a following question I have for you is you mentioned really really briefly some of the
1264.52s: exploration versus minor stuff which we'll get into in just a minute but I'm just generally
1268.28s: curious when you're talking about all of these different funds what what kind of time frames do
1274.36s: you all like to play in. We have definitely a more of a long term time framing fact that precious
1280.92s: metals fund and the global macro fund have a partial lock up for investors where they can put their
1287.80s: money into the funds and they have one year lock up full lock up they cannot take their money out
1293.56s: after a year to take 25% after another year to take another 25% they can take the whole and the
1301.48s: entire amount that they invested initially. So we're looking for long term investors or go is to
1309.00s: you know especially the precious metals thesis where we're dealing with more illiquid assets we
1314.84s: have to have it's not just it's the goal is not just to be big is to be big with a bright
1322.12s: right type of capital with the right mentality in mindset. So and that is a difficulty is to find
1328.04s: long term investors that are willing to take that bet for the next five to 10 years.
1333.96s: And so it will depend I would say the most of the big macro themes may take three to five years
1340.52s: to play out but there's a lot of sub themes within those ideas that may play out in six months to
1347.64s: 12 months and so I would say the turnover of the sub themes is much larger than the turnover of
1355.32s: the big themes. So I think that gives you a sense of open point if we're getting really you know
1363.96s: I guess optimistic about that theme or a certain theme that we think will really play out in the
1369.80s: following years. I think you know the whole goal is to be flexible enough to launch a whole new
1375.64s: strategy and bring expertise from outside to partner with us and then and then hopefully I
1382.84s: hopefully this will be a new business model for Crasket. So I know we don't want to stop just
1387.80s: in precious metals we've been doing that with oil but it's not a separate fun it's part of
1392.76s: global macro and so right there's a lot more to do here I think. Right so then just another kind
1401.48s: of ground setting conversation I we obviously don't have to go super far in a detail but I'm curious
1407.88s: to understand the quantitative models just a little bit more in terms of how they've been evolving
1415.24s: over time and I asked that question because I feel like we're going through different periods in
1421.80s: the markets and you know we were talking a little bit about this before we started just where
1425.88s: things don't necessarily behave as we might expect them to. So I'm just curious about the evolution
1431.96s: of the quantitative models to kind of cope with that. Oh my goodness it's been a crazy evolution I mean
1438.12s: it as far as you know we've been building models to figure try to figure out the inflation area
1444.04s: and you know what is the real attention in the system or or especially where we are in the
1450.12s: business cycle I think the correlations change over time and what is the right asset
1457.32s: asset connection that you need in order to to perform in this in this environment so it's been
1465.24s: it's been a crazy evolution period and I would say the fundamental equity model it's a lot of
1471.64s: backtesting it's a lot of backtesting because the majority of the point indicators that have worked
1478.68s: in the past most likely will not work in the future and you'll have to kind of link your macro
1484.76s: reviews along with the quant views in other words what are other times the biggest challenge for
1491.16s: quant strategies today is the fact that it's very very difficult to find data going back to other
1497.56s: macro regimes such as inflationary regimes and so looking for company data from the 70s and 60s
1505.40s: good luck there's very very few companies that provide that to you and so you know the granularity
1512.52s: of most of quant funds entering this macro regime change that we think we're in of inflationary
1519.72s: environment is is going to be challenging for them as well so you know I have my guesses of what I
1526.76s: think the factors that are going to be most useful in this in this setup which I think it's going to
1533.24s: be profitability you know companies with a cost of capital rising you're going to have issues with
1539.32s: large balance sheets so companies are going to get squeezed by wages and salaries so by using those
1547.24s: models to search for what are the companies that can get most squeezed in in a you know let's say
1553.24s: company using free cash for a relative to the amount of employees a very thin margin business that
1559.40s: also have issues with cost of capital and more I guess more reflective of of of the cost of capital
1568.76s: into their balance sheets and how much that can potentially squeeze their earnings and so I think
1575.40s: there's a lot of ways to to to twist is and and you know we're very open minded but it's it's not easy
1583.16s: it does help quite a lot to have models we're building now models in regards to exploration assets
1589.72s: and trying to figure out how do we how do we reach the ultimate value of what is in the ground
1596.92s: of of a certain project and so now empirically there are many ways you can do that and so we've
1603.88s: been seeking for different forms of of of when do we reach that peak evaluation of an asset relative
1613.96s: to what is in terms of minerals in the ground and so the work in there is endless I'm not trying
1621.40s: to say it's impossible right now there's certainly a lot of work to do and curiosity will always
1627.00s: drive your this this process I guess yeah I mean that's it's a fair statement and it's something I
1633.64s: actually talk a lot about on the channel for anybody who's an active trader is back testing and
1638.36s: anybody who does it knows it's you even getting the data is expensive and once you have it it can
1645.16s: be really time consuming to parse through so yeah I can only imagine you know what you guys especially
1650.76s: the level of detail I'm sure you go into trying to get that information just to be such a pain in
1655.96s: the ass I do not envy you it's it's fun if you like to if you like to have a view I think it's
1663.16s: important to dive in yeah the best ideas come from those those real analytical moments in in our
1670.76s: quant models and so it's I think it's very important yeah and I think that there's also to you
1677.24s: know something to be said about a lot of traders you've been around for a while you know start to
1683.16s: come across this phenomenon where like you know the markets are ever evolving but there's a lot of
1689.80s: things that repeat themselves over and over and over again across the markets so taking the time to
1695.88s: kind of review some of the you know past cycles and how the markets have reacted to that to what we're
1701.24s: seeing now I think there's a lot of value in that which kind of flows into my next question yeah sure
1707.08s: so kind of in the context of previous market behavior not necessarily dictating but potentially
1715.48s: informing future market behavior especially during unprecedented times at least in recent
1720.76s: history we're at seven and a half percent inflation just I'm curious your perspective on kind of a
1726.84s: broad level market overview of where the markets are at today and just your general thoughts on what
1734.68s: they look like throughout the rest of the year hmm I think it's important to go back and understand
1740.84s: what what is happening with the US especially I think it's the first time in history that I know of
1746.92s: at least 120 years of history that we're facing three macroing balances all at once it's at to GDP
1754.84s: problem that we had back in the 40s it's it's an inflationary environment that we had in the 70s
1761.00s: but it's also the speculative environment that we had in the late 90s and the three those three
1767.00s: issues are certainly not only explosive in their own but they also create a lot of political constraints
1774.68s: in regards to what the Federal Reserve could do in order to keep a keep a lead on inflation
1781.24s: at the same time as not allowing cost of capital to rise and so we're not able to to have
1788.36s: interest rates rising too much otherwise you you you cannot justify the excessive valuations
1796.36s: in risky assets along with the leverage in the system but at the same time you've got an inflation
1803.88s: problem where copper oil agricultural commodities could not care less if interest rates are at two
1811.96s: or three percent in terms of the Fed funds rate and so we're seeing on top of that a chronic
1821.00s: period of under investments in natural resources that have created a lot of in balances when it
1828.28s: comes to supply constraints that cannot be fixed in the short term so I think what we're seeing
1835.08s: today is one of the most bullish environments for owning tangible assets that we've seen in history
1842.12s: and so what are the big themes here so I think one of the big themes is inflation is here to stay
1849.00s: number one number two is if that's right then you've got to be careful with what is the leadership
1855.32s: of the market going to look like when it comes to where most of capital allocators have parked
1860.60s: their money into which is long duration assets what does that mean it's mostly technology related
1867.40s: companies along with fixed income and so with we've seen most scaper allocators burning money
1874.28s: into technology and in order to hatch that risk they bought also a lot of treasuries and other fixed
1880.44s: income like junk bonds and investment grade bonds and so forth and so most of the portfolios in the
1889.40s: world kind of look like that technology and bonds and I'm pretty sure what's going to happen in the
1896.28s: future here or I would say at least my view is is that this macro puzzle is going to cause
1903.56s: a shift of capital allocation into things that don't have such a long duration meaning things that
1911.08s: actually make money today like natural resource industries where profitability is going to come back
1918.52s: where capital is going to be chasing businesses that actually make a lot of money
1924.28s: and don't have a lot of debt and so natural resource industries is one of the places where I think
1930.28s: most of the capital is going to chase and it's going to be coming out of the growth stocks and so
1936.60s: you're going to see very likely the continuation of a out of growth stocks into value companies
1945.72s: kind of like what we saw back in 2021 where oil and gas companies EMP's exploration and production
1953.00s: companies had their best year in 30 years and so it's going to be a continuation of that pattern
1960.28s: I think and you can add the geopolitical problem with inflation which is the degolabolization
1968.76s: patterns that we're seeing that I think will continue to press on this inflationary pressure
1974.60s: in the system and so I don't think this is a bite of dip environment in equity markets I think
1983.96s: a leadership change and with technology being almost 40% of that's in B500 if I'm calling for
1992.68s: outflows of technology and inflows to let's call it energy at 3.8% of weight of that's in B500
2001.56s: you know you don't even want me to get started on what's gold weight or gold miners weight in
2007.40s: this and Peter's only one of them you want and so I'm starting thinking about this right but I
2012.68s: mean global equity markets at 120 trillion dollars today if you look at natural resource industries
2019.32s: that about 10 trillion dollars if you take out energy it's only three trillion dollars and so
2026.52s: there is a mismatch here that I think will create an incredible opportunity for investors
2033.00s: as money flows into those less of I would say natural resources but also more profitable
2042.12s: business models that have been you know that I think are very unloved especially in the last
2049.16s: of five to 10 years and are now in this beginning of a move here so you know obviously that is all
2056.36s: linked to the underlying tangible asset of each of those businesses oil companies linked to the oil
2062.68s: prices and so is gold miners with gold and so I think we're at the beginning of this outperformance
2069.64s: of commodities relative to overall equities that are extremely expensive and so you know it's
2076.20s: buying cheap and selling expensive I think that's that will continue to work and so there's you
2083.24s: know too many I think there's a lot of ways to to play this but I you know we think that
2089.00s: I gave you some examples already I think agricultural commodities look very attractive I think there's
2094.20s: a risk for food a food crisis is this is the first time we're seeing food and energy prices rising
2100.76s: at the same time and it's almost like the 70s on steroids and so right it's it's a very interesting
2108.44s: environment in central banks have zero control over this so right it's not the end of the world I
2116.52s: mean there's a lot of very opportunistic themes to capitalize on and I think you know there's a
2125.96s: lot of ways to do it yeah speaking of that can you talk to me a little bit about your thought
2132.28s: process on like the gold exploration versus you know just physical gold or even the miners for example
2142.12s: well I think there's a lot of things to unpack there first of all the industry is you know is is
2150.28s: just left for that meaning it's you know majority of capital has been chasing the major companies
2156.36s: and so there's about $550 billion of aggregate market cap for public companies in the in the gold
2163.56s: and silver space and what you find here is that companies have been under investing in exploration
2172.68s: because of the fact that they have been called you know they've been bleeding capital for many many
2177.16s: decades in lost money and never made any money and finally because of that conservatism coming
2183.56s: from management we're now seeing this shift towards you know really becoming more profitable
2190.44s: and certainly that is shown in most of the profitability measurements that you can look at such as
2197.16s: medium for cashful yield or aggregate for cashful yield of for the overall industry and which are
2204.04s: some of the best ones we've seen in history so there is an accumulation of of cash balance and
2211.72s: position from most of the majors at a time when they've been depleting their reserves in order to
2218.12s: generate free cash flow by producing more and so the lack of exploration and using less and less
2225.16s: of an exploration budget and and and I mean just think about when was the last time we've seen
2231.16s: any of the majors build a whole new project in precious metals metals I mean we haven't seen any and so
2239.16s: all those issues are creating a setup where companies are going to have to be looking for exploration
2245.24s: assets in the future and quick question sorry no no go ahead just a quick question on that like
2253.00s: if we're looking out 10 years do you think gold is more or less valuable in 10 years from now
2258.84s: I think it will be a lot more valuable I the whole reason why you want to be in my opinion
2266.60s: investing in smaller microcaps stocks today in the gold space is what is the risk of gold being at
2276.04s: lower prices 10 years from now I you know given the reckless amount of fiscal and monetary
2283.56s: stimulus worldwide ending balances in the constraints that we have in the in a place where we do have
2291.48s: that valuation and inflation problem you know where do we go from here so I think it's going to be
2297.16s: very difficult to fly inflationary problems we're going to have to run inflation rates much higher
2303.88s: than we saw in the last 30 years with financially repressed environment of trying to suppress
2311.08s: interest rates as much as we can at the same time and so this in my view will create kind of a
2316.68s: supercharged environment for commodities it's it's very bullish and so I think if you have if
2324.68s: you are of the view that gold and silver will be more valuable if you start with gold and
2330.76s: think about what's happening with the crypto market just just not to digress but it's all
2336.12s: yeah no I'm actually curious about that yeah yeah so it's all linked the crypto market and the
2341.56s: community of crypto in general is started with a libertarian movement more you know probably the
2348.04s: biggest we've seen in history I don't remember any other one that was as popular as the crypto
2354.68s: market where people are basically saying look I mean fee occurrences have zero value you know and I'm
2361.96s: saying mostly from the Bitcoin community that likes to say that there's no anchor to the dollar
2368.76s: there's no anchor to euro or brazilian rial or the Chinese you want and so what is causing here
2375.64s: is the lack of credibility from central banks where think about this I mean most of the central
2382.12s: banks in the world the most the ones that have the best credibility is out there are the ones that
2387.48s: hold treasuries of the US US treasuries in other words it basically owned debt right we've been
2396.12s: we've went so far on going out of the gold standard to now giving credibility to economies that
2405.00s: buy debt from another in-datate economy and so at what point do we see such a libertarian movement
2413.16s: which I think already you know we're already across the rubicon in terms of that is starting to
2418.28s: pressure central banks to improve the quality of their international reserves a currency is
2426.92s: anchored by the the quality of their international reserves where today international reserves
2433.56s: the majority of that is mostly on the US treasuries and under treasuries of other developed
2438.60s: economies and so at what point do we see central banks are starting to buy gold right so I think
2445.48s: historically we I don't think central banks would be buying bitcoin personally I think bitcoin has
2451.16s: its own uses and demand that will be under drive at higher but central banks probably will
2457.80s: buy at least in the next five to ten years maybe in 30 years will be buying bitcoin or some other
2463.08s: crypto asset but I think in five to ten years we'll see gold playing that role again and if you
2469.56s: think that that's going to be the case that is really what drives gold let's say 20 30 40 50 percent
2475.80s: higher if you were of that view then what do you think silver is going to be worth and so you
2482.60s: start extrapolating that domino effect of gold moving higher and what are the most levered ways
2490.12s: to be loaned that commodity or that currency whatever you want to grow so that's where it started
2495.88s: this whole thing is staying balances drive and this movement drives the the need for a credibility
2502.76s: improvement from central banks that would drive assets of things like gold silver and other
2509.40s: commodities significantly higher from here at a time when any central bank needs to suppress rates
2515.80s: and allow inflation rates to run hotter than other times historically and so
2522.36s: so I think you know and they're differently sublates you can buy big miners that's that's they're
2529.72s: have consistent you know consistently shown that they can produce in a certain level and also
2537.08s: perhaps even have very consistent free cash flow profile for many many decades in depending on
2544.92s: the company um the issue with this is is that we're also seeing a rise of energy prices and a rise
2552.76s: of wages and salaries where it's going to also squeeze the miners you know there's no way around
2558.20s: this and so in my view I think that you want to own minerals that are in the ground minerals in
2566.68s: the ground have a levered way not in the sense of that but in the sense of leverage to the price
2573.08s: and so I think this is the best way of empirically as well has been the best way of playing the
2579.56s: bull market for gold and silver so that is basically what we're doing at a time when more than any
2585.40s: under timing history we've seen this chronic under investments from the majors onto exploration assets
2593.16s: and so I think you know this industry and the exploration side is it's tiny tiny and so you know
2600.28s: this mark capital is capable of entering that market and and buying large portions of those
2606.84s: businesses you know large states up to 20% and own the vast high quality projects in the world
2613.64s: that can perhaps be purchased by those big miners in the future right right yeah that makes a lot of
2620.28s: sense and it's it's interesting to hear your perspective I actually echo a lot of that just
2625.16s: I was curious how you were fitting it in terms of the role of gold short term and long term because
2630.36s: I personally do question even the value of gold in 30 years because for a long time you know we
2639.08s: were using it in manufacturing for a lot of different components obviously super precious but
2643.32s: you know everything is changing especially as you noted in terms of how most countries are
2649.08s: starting to value the currencies and back their currencies I mean look at China with this whole
2654.60s: business going on with Ukraine being invaded by Russia China's sitting there saying like hey let's
2659.48s: find a good solution here because China is holding a ton of our debt so I can't imagine you know
2666.60s: that any sort of significant escalation in the war will benefit them at all which leads me to
2672.12s: my next question which is you know we have about less than 10 minutes left so there's two big
2677.00s: questions I want to ask you the first one is talk to me a little bit about your perspective on
2682.84s: Russia invading Ukraine as it pertains to impacting just the economy both in the US and globally
2691.24s: oh well I think first and foremost now just looking at me you you're you come from the military
2697.88s: environment you know that spending in that space has been declining in a declining rate for many
2704.20s: many decades has been in the secular decline all the way back to the 60s which is you know like it
2711.40s: or not like it and I think when we have geopolitical tensions one of the outcomes out of there is
2718.76s: that increase in spending and fiscal and military spending and it's important to know that we're
2725.72s: we're going to probably see that in my view in developed economies this is happening across the
2730.92s: world Germany now just announced they're going to be increasing the military budget by about $100
2735.72s: billion two percent of GDP right which is the minimum to being part of NATO and so forth and so
2743.80s: we're probably going to see this across the board but what does that mean to
2748.84s: increase your military spending when you also have fiscal spending already at the levels that we
2755.40s: have and I think this is inevitable you know it's it's what we're going to probably see is the
2760.52s: fiscal imbalance and balance getting worse and the fiscal agenda has never been so extensive
2765.88s: you've got peak inequality happening at the same time you have geopolitical issues you have the
2771.40s: green revolution you have this infrastructure developments and need in a west and so all that is
2779.48s: going to feed into also the military spending with the fiscal being big relative to the GDP where
2788.76s: it's going to need further financing from someone to be financing and purchasing the US debt and
2796.36s: after what we've seen so far with Russia in Ukraine I think it's going to be more more difficult
2802.60s: for us to be funding funding things in general and so it's going to create a role for the central
2810.28s: banks of the world to start financing some of those operations which just means you know monetary
2818.12s: delusion in general and so ultimately I think we're going to go there I think this is a big shift
2826.52s: geopolitically speaking and showing how strategic commodities have become and just a course of three
2833.80s: to four months and we've seen this in history in the past but now more than any other time oil is
2841.96s: such a strategic asset today to have and food you know whoever country that owns enough agricultural
2851.08s: commodities and oil and other even copper and some other other things other minerals that will
2859.48s: play into a bigger role in the future I think are going to be in good hands and so you have to think
2867.48s: about you know China India that are not in that position relative to a place like Brazil for instance
2876.12s: and maybe even the U.S. and Canada and so I think I think there's going to be a lot of changes
2883.64s: in terms of physically what we're going to see here you know I think there's no way around this
2890.76s: I have no idea what Russia is going to do but it is questionable what you know how much more
2897.08s: dangerous you know the leadership of Russia becomes when when you have one of the most perhaps the
2903.64s: most embarrassing moment for Russia of of Putin's career I think I mean it's it's been a total failure so
2911.80s: far what he has done so in my opinion and so what is he going to do now to restore the credibility inside
2920.68s: of Russia and and into the rest of the world with a message that he wanted to send but unfortunately
2926.84s: that that message didn't come across yet and so it's it's a little scary in that sense yeah
2934.92s: now I hope we're not going to see a world that a lot of people think we'll see but you know the best
2941.08s: that I can do as an investor is to continue to buy and you know take advantage of that volatility
2947.16s: that we're seeing I think rallies needs to be sold not not not buying the dip is is a strategy that
2955.00s: I'm not sure will work the same manner it it happened in the in the past and I think there are
2961.16s: places that are uninvestable you know I've always thought that I mean it's giving you another idea
2966.76s: of how principles are important and even though China is chief I do not we do not invest in
2973.80s: Chinese assets I mean we we can only at Crescat only shorts China if makes sense and so we are not
2981.32s: long China and we're not long Russia I don't care how cheap it is right it's not you know not
2989.56s: part of our moral views in general and so I think you know we don't we don't finance communism
2998.36s: across the globe I'm sorry to get there but it's just not not what we do and so we don't invest in
3004.68s: Russia we don't invest in China we invest in other places in the world that we think could
3011.24s: potentially do well and if they ever start to become like Russia and China we'll exit from those
3018.44s: places too and so I think strategically we got to think about China in Taiwan you know I think I
3027.72s: think there's quite a lot of books about the situation of the Taiwan I think certainly has
3034.12s: opened the path for such a potential invasion or takeover of Taiwan I think the best way to do that
3043.88s: is as we started those issues with Ukraine we have not seen the changes in FX in the Chinese market
3051.64s: just yet and so meaning the Chinese currency has been very stable so far we added short
3059.40s: positions in the Chinese currency we've been short the Chinese currency for many years
3063.80s: and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work and but we think it's one of the most
3069.40s: overvalued assets in the world today and it is a major imbalance when it comes to banking assets
3077.88s: relative to GDP I have a very different view than most people that think China and Russia are
3085.32s: you know are playing the long the long-term game I actually don't I'm sure they are but I think
3091.24s: I think you know Russia has been a total failure I mean just look at the currency and just look at
3097.24s: the China the the Russia market in general it's been a total failure so the Rubell what dropped
3102.92s: like 20% or something overnight when all the sanctions started coming through what type of long
3107.48s: long-term game is that I mean that's right then the worst performer in one of the worst performing
3113.96s: countries in the world I think and and and so and so have Chinese equities too and so I don't know
3122.44s: I I have a very different view I find it difficult to see large capital allocators going into China
3129.72s: especially in the next five or 10 years given all that's happening and so you have to question
3135.48s: what is going to drive those economies to continue to perform very well in an environment where
3141.64s: commodity prices are rising you know where is China going to keep up growing at what ever they
3147.56s: number do they tell you that they're growing at 10% rate every every year when oil prices in
3155.88s: in Chinese you want terms is that the most expensive has been in like seven years or so and so
3161.88s: and I think it's all questionable no current accounts are going to become more on the deficit side
3167.56s: for China relative to the rest of the globe that is all very negative for China not positive
3173.16s: India is in the same spot by the way and so I much rather belong Brazil than belong China by the way
3180.52s: so there's a lot of developed macro developments here unfolding at the same time but hopefully I
3188.28s: shared some of my views oh it's awesome I literally love hearing just these kind of conversations
3195.00s: and how other people view what's going on today and where the opportunities lie excite yeah I mean
3201.48s: what oil hit 107 today you know it's just there there's a lot of things making moves that are
3207.88s: just very fascinating to me so thank you very much for sharing your perspective on it we are at
3213.32s: time so I promise you I'd get you out the door so I will honor that however before we sign off I do
3218.92s: need to say because I didn't say it yet I love your beard I need to compliment the beards that I see
3223.96s: support the beard movement so it's very nice it's beautiful beard's coming all different shapes
3233.64s: and sizes and I'm a big fan so yeah thank you so much for your time I know people they can find
3241.32s: you on Twitter just like I did which is at Tavi Costa yeah which I'll also throw in the video
3249.48s: description for people that want to just follow along you share a lot of great information I think
3253.24s: so it'd be you know cool for people that are interested in following along so thanks again for
3257.88s: coming to hang out for a bit really had a great time hey thank you Eric and thanks for serving
3262.20s: in the military we know being a Brazilian and I also appreciate that quite a lot so thanks for
3267.64s: doing that my pleasure yeah it's awesome thank you perfect you know it's super fun yeah hopefully
3276.20s: you enjoy that yeah I
