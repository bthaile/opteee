 Got it. All right. What is up everybody? So I am super stoked. I got Tobi here. He is calling in. You're in Denver. You said? Yes. I mean, never. Thanks for having me by the way. Perfect. Yeah. Absolutely. It's it's an absolute pleasure to have you on. I have a chance to go through your Twitter a little bit as I do and stock people. And you have a lot of really interesting perspectives, especially as it comes to kind of like a just macro market discussions and some of the other things that we're just kind of doing a preamble to some of the precious metals. Topics and things like that. So I'm looking forward to diving into those with you for sure. But first off, welcome to the channel. Thank you. Yep. Second off, I would love to start with just a little bit of your background. So I saw that you're from what's up, Paul? Yes. I was born and raised in Brazil, lived in the state of Sao Paulo for until my age of 20, I guess 19. Then I moved to the west to play tennis in college. And then the rest is history. I guess I've been here for for some time now. Yeah, man. So did you do Jiu Jitsu while you were there? No, believe it or not, I am probably the only Brazilian who doesn't know how to do Jiu Jitsu or play soccer very well. So. What? Yeah. So I train a lot at Victory MMA down here in San Diego. I'm in San Diego. And the grappling coach there is Dean Lister who spent a lot of time in Brazil. So he talks about, you know, just growing up there and whatnot. So I had to ask. But all right, maybe we can convert you into Jiu Jitsu. You know, I'm hopeful. I would love to. It's so fun. It's physical chess is what it comes down to you right now. I'm like 235 pounds. Like I mean, you're really strong. But I've never felt like such just a whos compared to like some of these 160 pound dudes that are just so well versed. That's why I love Jiu Jitsu because you could be strong, but it's very, very mental. Well, I am the huge fan of MMA and UFC. I'm not going to lie. So you're already there. Yeah. I just can't do anything on in terms of that, but certainly watch it a lot. Yeah. Well, good. Jiu Jitsu is a perfect entrance into that. There's no like face punching and stuff. So it's a gentle intro. I need that. Yeah, exactly. So you came to the US. Was it was it the US for college, you said? Yes. So I moved to Liberty University in Virginia. I was recruited play tennis in college. I played tennis, started playing tennis when I was 14 and then when I was 18 or 19. I was started to move or look for universities in the US. I knew there was ways of getting scholarships here. To play sports and then perhaps get education in a cheaper way than in Brazil and also learn English and so forth. And I was I always loved the American culture. And so it was a very easy move when he comes to that and you know, I fell in love with it. And I'm still I'm still here. Yeah, that's awesome. So talk to me about how you got kind of started in the finance space. It's it's stuff to pinpoint exactly when it all started, but I think I've always been, you know, I've always seen money as as a not so much as as a glorious way of showing off people, but more as a security and safety feature of my life, given the fact that when I was 13 or 14 maybe yeah, 14. My dad had his own business. He was very successful. He did very well, especially in the 90s and early 2000s and and then things turn south and when things turn south. Whereas you know, I was I was a teenager and I was very difficult to see everything, you know, just literally going from everything to nothing. And so for me, I always helped him in many different ways of being very dynamically. And so I was really involved in his business along with my parents and my mom as well. And so the entire family had really get together to go through that pain of of a downturn economically and financially. So after that, I think of how has been fascinated by financial markets and I think in college was really when I started to read a lot about finance and read a lot about the economy and then I started investing my own money and loss of money and that was part of a lot of experience in that period started to move forward and really I mean, I remember backing college. I was just I had very good grades and I was studying for a business administration, but I was I was really not too focused on college as much as focus on learning about finance and I loved it. I mean, I just think the strategy side of it is is one of the most fascinating things of this industry and figuring out the markets is going to be an endless learning curve that I think, you know, I mean, I wake up every day. I'm extremely fortunate for the job that I have and I'm always happy to be part of this. But then let's see, I think when I move to Colorado after college, I actually met Kevin in a tennis court. Kevin is the CIO and founder of Crasuke Capital. After working in finance and other as an intern in other places, I really started working with them and got most of his principles when he comes to approach of investing and learning about quant models, which he always used a lot of his proprietary quant models in order to run or really manage capital. So I began to learn from him and started to apply the same principles in macro. And so that is when I started to really really add value to, I think, to to Crasuke and this is this was kind of the beginning of me going from an analyst to a portfolio manager and then starting sharing some of my research to the rest of the world. A lot, a lot of things, a lot of turns in that in, you know, I'm just telling you the very short story, but that has been a lot that happened in that period. But now after what 11 years maybe I've been, you know, with Kevin now working pretty, you know, pretty good relationship with him and now Quentin Haney as well. So the company has grown. The fund is now we're managing some more close to 300 million dollars of capital today. So a lot of things have changed since the beginning. I mean, we went from a 50 million, you know, AUM to a 300 million AUM in the course of three to four years. So things have gone a lot of a lot of big changes in my life. And I think in the whole companies, you know, since the beginning of it, I think we've done a lot of changes. And so very happy and very proud of it. And now as a partner, now my goal is to continue to grow here and make this one of the best macro shops in the world. That's the whole goal. That's awesome, man. So I want to talk to you a little bit about a Crescat. But before that, you said something that really, really resonated with me because it was, I don't know, just a perspective that I've never really thought much about. And you were talking about that you had, you know, your dad was very successful in business. And the economic downturn, you know, is really where you all went through like this adjustment period. And I'm just personally curious about that because I find like most of my circle that I know most of us came from almost an inverse where we started like I had a single mom who was working two jobs trying to keep the lights on essentially. So we kind of started from not quite the bottom, you know, it's not that bad, but definitely a more impoverished state. I am just very, very interested to understand just I don't know what that transition was like for you all when you know your dad had this really successful business. And then the out external forces, right, the market at large started to negatively impact that you were talking about some of those adjustments and whatnot. I'm just really curious like your thoughts about that time period and how that has fueled the rest of your trajectory in the finance space. I know you said it got you interested, but you know, just again from a personal perspective, curious about that cycle in your life. Well, I think, you know, first of a wealthy or emerging wealthy family in Brazil would be considered perhaps in international standards more of middle class, especially in the US, but not sure what is worth what's worse is if it's you starting from zero or starting from something and then go into zero when you were 14 15. I think I haven't done the other side of it. So I'm not sure, but that was painful for the age and not being really knowing how to how to behave in such a set up nature. But for me, I think there are there were a lot of lessons that happened back then. Number one is the lesson of leveraging up when when you were against a secular trend. So basically, well, my dad, I think there was a lot of lessons and one of the mistakes was you started with a retail business that was doing very well. And what and then basically we started to see Chinese Chinese products being imported to date to Brazil, or imported to Brazil, reducing his margins. And then we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to see that, and we started to say that, we started to say that, well, what happens is, that we started out by looking at full occidental events, or Governance, or different�, women, Imperialratic abilities and sort of like Ms. Problem Cake. And the way he tuned you was really đâyiful, and you know from your point of view, it was really quite a huge unique, and so I was at the beginning of the question that you look into, right there. building, we had a stop building and selling it, we had nice cars, we had to sell everything and go from there to driving the worst cars. And so, you know, going from the best schools to the worst schools and being a tennis player where it's a very rich kind of sport in Brazil, meaning only wealthy people play and not being able to afford play in tennis anymore. So, or through all that it was brutal, but certainly, it was definitely necessary. Now my dad is doing very well. I think I'm doing just fine and so just the rest is history. That's, I honestly, I think that's worse than like what I grew up with because I think, yeah, it's true. I think that I did not need to say what's what's. No, no, no, no, not at all. It just, I for my mind, I was like really empathizing with that experience because I think the part to me that would make it so devastating is obviously your dad had risked so much even to get to that point and then to have this huge unwinding essentially of all of it. Like that to me is just, that's devastating. So, I mean, I can't, I mean, and then your dad obviously just kind of bootstrapped it, right? Like he decided, okay, well, we got to make some changes here and we'll get back together and you said he's doing great now. It's just that's a really inspirational cycle because that's tough. That's one of the biggest issues I think people have with taking risk is that they're scared of that so they don't take the risk. But you have somebody like your dad that took the risk got hit along the way but able to turn out of it and you know, kind of emerging like to me, that is the true focus of that story. That's incredible. Yeah, I mean, if I always make sure I wasn't good, you know, good education in Brazil, I always had very good, I was always attending good places in terms of learning from different people and that was always, I think, a key part of building up, you know, this foundation to where we are today. However, yeah, it messes with you, especially psychologically and it's incredible that my parents' marriage went through all that and really got together and things were fine. But it was not key. That's so awesome. You know, it's very challenging and now it's just like putting on a trade that you're taking on too much leverage and then things don't go the way you expect it and where do you go from here. So it's tough. That's well, thank you for sharing it. It's sincerely, thank you for sharing that story because I've never personally thought about that cycle before. So that was actually kind of interesting to explore that a little bit with you and it really is kind of motivating to hear, you know, your dad was able to just face the risk, got hit by it, but then when passed it, like that's, I think, just really, really cool. So then you, you know, we fast forward and now you're at Crescat. You kind of started there and talked to me about just what Crescat is all about, you know, you referenced more that as kind of a macro focus. Like I said, I had a chance to go through your SEC filings and stuff like that, but just for, you know, the elevator pitch version for everybody else, what are you guys all about? Well, I guess learning lessons from what happened when I was younger, I think the biggest goal of the firm has been nailing and figuring out identifying the big secular trends and being in front of them and really trying to capitalize from them as best as we can. And so we started from a macro perspective. We built models and different tools in order to help us to get to those views. We are also using a lot of value principles of value investing and really figuring out what are the best ways of expressing those views when it comes to what are the companies we should be purchasing and are selling short and so forth. So it's really a mix of global macro with value principles where we use proprietary tools in order to reach to those conclusions. And so we also bring expertise when we think it's time to be branching out and starting and whole new strategy. So precious metals is a great example when 20 2018, we thought this was kind of the right time to be investing in precious metals and we launched a new strategy and that was the separate managed account of precious metals. And then later on we launched the Hedge Fund and this was where we bought a partnership with Quentin Henney, a geologist to help us navigate the space. And so it's sort of, we do a lot. I mean it's like a question we get the most hot you guys do it all. I mean certainly starts from macro and as we, it's great when you have various bias ways of validating your thesis. And so in a lot of ways I think the precious metals and the commodities companies now all score really well in our Quentin models are fundamental equity models. And so that is completely unbiased and just happens to be the case that also enveloped very bullish on tangible assets and and commodity as a whole. And so a lot of, so basically I think was the idea was figuring out that the Quentin models that Kevin was building back in the days was leading him to macro views. And so we kind of swaffer and started using the macro models to then confirm those views along with the fundamental equity models. And that really helps. And so we were able to build a very diversified portfolio with a lot of big macro themes. And then we have sub themes within those big ideas. And our goal is to find out what are the best ways of expressing those. And that's that is an ongoing conversation on the daily basis and portfolio is always changing. So it's a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah. So what are some of the like common products that you guys like to take a look at? Okay. So large cap it was when Kevin started. So we're one of the few funds that go back to the 90s. And so large cap is a long only strategy that was basically built by selecting companies part of this fundamental equity model. The scores the most liquid companies all over the globe. And we only buy the ones that scored the best and that rank change on a daily basis. And it helps us to manage risk. Okay. But that's one strategy. And then in 2000, we launched the long short. And this was Kevin Smith at the time who was running this. The long short is very few long short. It's go back to 2000. It was launched back then because he was very concerned about the equity markets. And he wanted to be flexible and able to short stocks at that time. And then in 2006, most of the, well actually the equity model was telling us that we should be short most of the home builders and some of the banks in the US. And so that opportunistically speaking, he was like, well, I guess it's maybe a great time to be launching a global macro fund that gives us even further flexibility to now purchase outside of equity only instruments. We can buy you know, effects. We can buy commodities and you can really express any of your macro views in any way you would like to. So that was the beginning of the global macro in 2006 and absolutely nailed the housing bust. And then, and then you know, from there, it did other things such as the oil markets when things turn south or when we had the commodities boom market into 2011 or 2010 and 2011. Or we've had shorts in the Chinese markets back in 2015, 2016. There's a lot of themes that played out in our favor since then. And then 2018, given the fact that we're so bullish on precious metals, we decided to then launch a precious metals focus fund. And then by diving into that industry, we figure out as well. And we thought that the best way to be expressing that idea was to be buying what everyone else is not buying, which is exploration assets. And so the majority of the industry is really most of the capital has been sucked into the big miners. And so, you know, there's a lot of issues that we can get into from a macro perspective of why we think the exploration assets are going to be outperforming the entire industry. But that's really a macro trend that we think, you know, will play it out in the following years when it comes to gold and silver prices moving higher and allowing those companies to do very well. So I think that gives you a sense of how we're basically positioned right now. Yeah, definitely. And I think that's a great recap. I can tell that you're pretty familiar with running through that stuff because that's very polished. So, a follow-on question I have for you is you mentioned really, really briefly some of the, you know, exploration versus miner stuff, which we'll get into in just a minute. But I'm just generally curious when you're talking about all of these different funds, what kind of timeframes do you all like to play in? We have definitely a more of a long-term time-framing. In fact, the precious metals fund and the global macro fund have a partial lockup for investors where they can put their money into the funds and they have one year lockup, full lockup, they cannot take their money out after a year to take 25 percent after another year. They can take another 25 percent and they can take the whole and the entire amount that they invest initially. So we're looking for long-term investors or go is to, you know, especially the precious metals, theses where we're dealing with more illiquid assets. We have to have. It's not just, the goal is not just to be big. It should be big with the bright type of capital with the right mentality and mindset. And that is the difficulty is to find long-term investors that are willing to take that bet for the next five to 10 years. And so it will depend. I would say the most of the big macro themes may take three to five years to play out, but there's a lot of sub themes within those ideas that may play out in six months to 12 months. And so I would say the turnover of the sub themes is much larger than the turnover of the big themes. So I think that gives you a sense of open-to-one. If we're getting really, you know, I guess optimistic about that theme or a certain theme that we think will really play out in the following years, I think, you know, the whole goal is to be flexible enough to launch a whole new strategy and bring expertise from outside to partner with us and then hopefully, I think, hopefully this will be a new business model for Crasket. So I know we don't want to stop just in precious metals. We've been doing that with oil, but it's not a separate fund. It's part of global macro. And so there's a lot more to do here, I think. Right. So then just another kind of ground-setting conversation, I obviously don't have to go super far in detail, but I'm curious to understand the quantitative models, just a little bit more in terms of how they've been evolving over time. And I asked that question because I feel like we're going through different periods in the markets and, you know, we were talking a little bit about this before we started, just where things don't necessarily behave as we might expect them to. So I'm just curious about the evolution of the quantitative models to kind of cope with that. Oh, my goodness. It's been a crazy evolution. I mean, as far as, you know, we've been building models to try to figure out the inflation area, you know, what is the real evolution of the system or, or, or especially where we are in the business cycle. I think the correlations change over time and what is the right asset, asset, a connection that you need in order to, to perform in this, in this environment. So it's been, it's been a crazy evolution period. And I would say the fundamental equity model, it's a lot of backtesting. It's a lot of backtesting because the majority of the, uh, quant indicators that have worked in the past, most likely will not work in the future. And you have to kind of link your macro views along with the quant views. In other words, you know, what are other times that the biggest challenge for quant strategies today is the fact that it's very, very difficult to find data going back to other macro regimes such as inflationary regimes. And so looking for company data from the 70s and 60s, good luck. There's very, very few companies that provide that to you. And so, you know, the granularity of most of quant funds entering this macro regime change that we think we're in of inflationary environment is, is going to be challenging for them as well. So, you know, I have my guesses of what I think the factors that are going to be most, uh, useful in this, in this setup, which I think it's going to be profitability, um, you know, companies with a cost of capital rising, you're going to have issues with large balance sheets. So, um, companies are going to get squeezed by wages and salaries. So, by using those models to search for what are the companies that can get most squeezed in, in a, you know, let's say, a company using free cash for a relative to the amount of employees, a very thin margin business that also have issues with cost of capital and more, um, I guess, more reflective of, of, of the cost of capital into their balance sheets and how much that can potentially squeeze their earnings. And so, I think there's a lot of ways to, uh, to, to, to, to WISTAs and, and, you know, we're very open minded, but it's, uh, it's not easy. It does help quite a lot to have models. We're building now models in regards to exploration assets and trying to figure out, um, how do we, how do we reach the ultimate value of what is in the ground of, of a certain project? And so, you know, empirically, there are many ways you can do that. And so we've been seeking for different forms of, of when do we reach that peak evaluation of an asset relative to what is in terms of minerals in the ground? And so the work in there is endless. I'm not trying to say it's impossible, but there's certainly a lot of work to do and curiosity will always drive your this process, I guess. Yeah, I mean, that's a fair statement and it's something I actually talk a lot about on the channel for anybody who's an active trader is back testing. And anybody who does it knows it's, even getting the data is expensive. And once you have it, it can be really time consuming to parse through. So yeah, I can only imagine, you know, what you guys, especially the level of detail I'm sure you go into, trying to get that information, you just gotta be such a pain in the ass. I do not envy you. It's fun. If you like to have a view, I think it's important to dive in. Yeah. And the best ideas come from those real analytical moments in our quant models. And so I think it's very important. Yeah, and I think that there's also to, you know, something to be said about a lot of traders who've been around for a while, you know, start to come across this phenomenon where like, you know, the markets are ever evolving, but there's a lot of things that repeat themselves over and over and over again across the markets. So taking the time to kind of review some of the, you know, past cycles and how the markets have reacted to that to what we're seeing now, I think there's a lot of value in that, which kind of flows into my next question. Yeah, sure. So kind of in the context of previous market behavior, not necessarily dictating, but potentially informing future market behavior, especially during unprecedented times, at least in recent history, or at seven and a half percent inflation. Just I'm curious your perspective on kind of a broad level market overview of where the markets are at today and just your general thoughts on what they look like throughout the rest of the year. Hmm. I think it's important to go back and understand what is happening with the US, especially. I think it's the first time in history that I know of, at least 120 years of history, that we're facing three macroing balances all at once. It's at the GDP problem that we had back in the 40s. It's an inflationary environment that we had in the 70s, but it's also the speculative environment that we had in the late 90s. And the three, those three issues are certainly not only explosive in their own, but they also create a lot of political constraints in regards to what the Federal Reserve could do in order to keep a lead on inflation at the same time as not allowing cost of capital to rise. And so we're not able to have interest rates rising too much, otherwise you cannot justify the excessive valuations in risky assets along with the leverage in the system. But at the same time, you've got an inflation problem where copper, oil, agricultural commodities could not care less if interest rates are at two or three percent in terms of the Fed funds rate. And so we're seeing on top of that, a chronic period of under-investments in natural resources that have created a lot of in balances when it comes to supply constraints that cannot be fixed in the short term. So I think what we're seeing today is one of the most bullish environments for owning tangible assets that we've seen in history. And so what are the big themes here? So I think one of the big themes is inflation is here to stay. Number one, number two is if that's right, then you've got to be careful with what is the leadership of the market going to look like when it comes to where most of capital allocators have parked their money into, which is long duration assets. What does that mean? It's mostly technology-related companies along with fixed income. And so we've seen most capital allocators spreading money into technology. And in order to hatch that risk, they bought also a lot of treasuries and other fixed income like junk bonds and investment grade bonds and so forth. And so most of the portfolios in the world kind of look like that, technology and bonds. And I'm pretty sure what's going to happen in the future here, or I would say at least my view is, is that this macro puzzle is going to cause a shift of capital allocation into things that don't have such a long duration, meaning things that actually make money today, like natural resource industries, where profitability is going to come back, where capital is going to be chasing businesses that actually make a lot of money and don't have a lot of debt. And so natural resource industries is one of the places where I think most of the capital is going to chase. And it's going to be coming out of the growth stocks. And so you're going to see very likely the continuation of a out of growth stocks into value companies, kind of like what we saw back in 2021, where oil and gas companies, EMPs, exploration and production companies had their best year in 30 years. And so it's going to be a continuation of that pattern, I think, and you can add the geopolitical problem with inflation, which is the de-globalization patterns that we're seeing that I think will continue to press on this inflationary pressure in the system. And so I don't think this is a bite-a-dip environment in equity markets. I think this is a leadership change. And with technology being almost 40% of that's in B500, if I'm calling for outflows of technology and inflows to, let's call it energy, at 3.8% of weight of that's in B500, you don't even want me to get started on what's gold weight or gold miners weight in this and Peter's only one of them, you want. And so I'm sort of thinking about this, right? I mean, global equity markets at $120 trillion today, if you look at natural resource industries that about $10 trillion, if you take out energy, it's only $3 trillion. And so there is a mismatch here that I think will create an incredible opportunity for investors as money flows into those less of, I would say natural resources, but also more profitable business models that have been, you know, that I think are very unloved, especially in the last five to 10 years, and are now in this beginning of a move here. So obviously that is all linked to the underlying tangible asset of each of those businesses, oil companies linked to the oil prices, and so is gold miners with gold. And so I think we're at the beginning of this outperformance of commodities relative to overall equities that are extremely expensive. And so, you know, it's buying cheap and selling expensive. I think that's, that will continue to work. And so there's, you know, too many, I think there's a lot of ways to play this, but I, you know, we think that, I gave you some examples already. I think agricultural commodities look very attractive. I think there's a risk for food, a food crisis. This is the first time we're seeing food and energy prices rising at the same time. And it's almost like the 70s on steroids. And so, it's a very interesting environment. And central banks have zero control over this. So, it's not the end of the world. I mean, there's a lot of very opportunistic themes to capitalize on. And I think, you know, there's a lot of ways to do it. Yeah, speaking of that, can you talk to me a little bit about your thought process on like the gold exploration versus, you know, just physical gold or even the miners, for example? Well, I think there's a lot of things to unpack there. First of all, the industry is, you know, is just left for that meaning. It's, you know, the majority of capital has been chasing the major companies. And so, there's about $550 billion of aggregate market cap for public companies in the gold and silver space. And what you find here is that companies have been under investing in exploration because of the fact that they have been called, you know, they've been bleeding capital for many, many decades and lost money and never made any money. And finally, because of that conservatism coming from management, we're now seeing this shift towards, you know, really becoming more profitable. And certainly that is shown in most of the profitability measurements that you can look at, such as medium for cash flow yield or aggregate for cash flow yield for the overall industry, which are some of the best ones we've seen in history. So there is an accumulation of cash balance and position from most of the majors at a time when they've been depleting their reserves in order to generate free cash flow by producing more. And so the lack of exploration and using less and less of an exploration budget. And I mean, just think about when was the last time we've seen any of the majors build a whole new project in precious metals, I mean, we haven't seen any. And so all those issues are creating a setup where companies are gonna have to be looking for exploration assets in the future. And- Quick question. I'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, go ahead. Just a quick question on that. Like if we're looking out 10 years, do you think gold is more or less valuable in 10 years from now? I think it will be a lot more valuable. The whole reason why you wanna be, in my opinion, investing in smaller microcap stocks today in the gold space is what is the risk of gold being at lower prices 10 years from now? I, you know, given the reckless amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus worldwide, ending balances in the constraints that we have in a place where we do have this debt evaluation and inflation problem, you know, where do we go from here? So I think it's gonna be very difficult to fight inflationary problems. We're gonna have to run inflation rates much higher than we saw in the last 30 years with financially repressed environment of trying to suppress interest rates as much as we can at the same time. And so this, in my view, will create kind of a super charge of the environment for commodities. It's very bullish. And so I think if you have, if you are of the view that gold and silver will be more valuable, if you start with gold and think about what's happening with the crypto market, just not to digress, but it's all, I mean, no, I'm actually curious about that. Yeah, so it's all linked. The crypto market and the community of crypto in general is started with a libertarian movement. More, you know, probably the biggest we've seen in history. I don't remember any other one that was as popular as the crypto market where people are basically saying, look, I mean, the occurrences have zero value, you know, and I'm saying mostly from the Bitcoin community that likes to say that there's no anchor to the dollar. There's no anchor to euro or Brazilian Riau or the Chinese you want. And so what is causing here is the lack of credibility from central banks where think about this. I mean, most of the central banks in the world, the ones that have the best credibility is out there are the ones that hold treasuries of the US, US treasuries. In other words, it basically owned debt. Right. We've been, we've went so far on going out of the gold standard and now giving credibility to economies that buy debt from another in-dat economy. And so at what point do we see such a libertarian movement, which I think already, you know, we're already across the Rubicon in terms of that, is starting to pressure central banks to improve the quality of their international reserves. Accurrency is anchored by the quality of their international reserves, where today international reserves are the majority of that is mostly on the US treasuries and under-treasuries of other developed economies. And so at what point do we see central banks are starting to buy gold, right? So I think historically, I don't think central banks would be buying Bitcoin personally. I think Bitcoin has its own uses and demand that will be under-drive at higher. But central banks probably will buy at least in the next five to 10 years, maybe in 30 years we'll be buying Bitcoin or some other crypto asset. But I think in five to 10 years, we'll see gold playing that role again. And if you think that that's gonna be the case, that is really what drives gold, let's say 20, 30, 40, 50% higher, if you were of that view, then what do you think silver is gonna be worth? And so you start extrapolating that domino effect of gold moving higher. And what are the most lavert ways to be loaned that commodity or that currency? Whatever you want to grow. So that's where it started this whole thing, is staying balances drive and this movement drives the need for a credibility improvement from central banks that would drive assets of things like gold, silver, and other commodities significantly higher from here. At a time when any central bank needs to suppress rates and allow inflation rates to run hotter than other times historically. And so I think, you know, and there are different ways to play this, you can buy the big miners, that's their have consistent, you know, consistently shown that they can produce in a certain level and also perhaps even have very consistent for cash flow profile for many, many decades in depending on the company. The issue with this is that we're also seeing a rise of energy prices and a rise of wages and salaries where it's gonna also squeeze the miners. There's no way around this. And so in my view, I think that you wanna own minerals that are in the ground. Minerals in the ground have a lavert way, not in the sense of that, but in the sense of leverage to the price. And so I think this is the best way of empirically as well, has been the best way of playing the bull market for gold and silver. So that is basically what we're doing at a time when more than any under timing history, we've seen this chronic under investments from the majors onto exploration assets. And so I think, you know, this industry and the exploration side is tiny, tiny. And so, you know, this market capital is capable of entering that market and buying large portions of those businesses, you know, large states up to 20% and own the vast high quality projects in the world that can perhaps be purchased by those big miners in the future. Right, right. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it's interesting to hear your perspective. I actually echo a lot of that. Just, I was curious how you were fitting it in terms of the role of gold short-term and long-term. Because I personally do question even the value of gold in 30 years. Because for a long time, you know, we were using it in manufacturing for a lot of different components. Obviously, super precious. But, you know, everything is changing, especially as you noted in terms of how most countries are starting to value the currencies and back their currencies. I mean, look at China with this whole business going on with Ukraine being invaded by Russia. China's sitting there saying like, hey, let's find a good solution here because China's holding a ton of art debt. So I can't imagine, you know, that any sort of significant escalation in the war will benefit them at all, which leads me to my next question, which is, you know, we have about less than 10 minutes left. So there's two big questions I want to ask you. The first one is, talk to me a little bit about your perspective on Russia invading Ukraine as it pertains to impacting just the economy, both in the US and globally. Oh, well, I think first and foremost, now just looking at me, and you come from the military environment, and you know, that spending in that space has been declining and a declining rate for many, many decades has been in the secular decline all the way back to the 60s, which is, you know, like it or not like it. I think when we have geopolitical tensions, one of the outcomes out of there is that increase in spending and fiscal and military spending. And it's important to know that we're, we're going to probably see that in my view in developed economies. This is happening across the world. Germany now just announced they're going to be increasing the military budget by about $100 billion, 2% of GDP, which is the minimum to being part of NATO and so forth. And so we're probably going to see this across the board, but what does that mean to increase your military spending when you also have fiscal spending already at the levels that we have? And I think this is inevitable, you know, it's, it's, what we're going to probably see is the fiscal imbalance, and balance getting worse. And the fiscal agenda has never been so extensive. You've got peak inequality happening at the same time, you have geopolitical issues, you have the green revolution, you have this infrastructure developments and need in a U.S. And so all that is going to feed into also the military spending with the fiscal being big relative to the GDP where it's going to need further financing from someone to be financing and purchasing the U.S. debt. And after what we've seen so far with Russia in Ukraine, I think it's going to be more and more difficult for us to be funding, funding things in general. And so it's going to create a role for the central banks of the world to start financing some of those operations, which just means, you know, monetary dilution in general. And so ultimately, I think we're going to go there. I think this is a big shift geopolitically speaking and showing how strategic commodities have become in just a course of three to four months. And we've seen this in history in the past, but now more than any other time, oil is such a strategic asset today to have. And food, you know, whoever country that owns enough agricultural commodities and oil and other, even in no copper and some other things, other minerals that will play into a bigger role in the future, I think are going to be in good hands. And so you have to think about, you know, China, India that are not in that position relative to a place like Brazil, for instance, and maybe even the U.S. and Canada. And so I think there's going to be a lot of changes in terms of physically what we're going to see here. You know, I think there's no way around this. I have no idea what Russia is going to do, but it is questionable what, you know, how much more dangerous, you know, the leadership of Russia becomes when you have one of the most perhaps the most embarrassing moment for Russia of Putin's career, I think. I mean, it's been a total failure so far, what he has done so in my opinion. And so what is he going to do now to restore the credibility inside of Russia and into the rest of the world with a message that he wanted to send, but unfortunately that message didn't come across yet. And so it's a little scary in that sense. Now, I hope we're not going to see a world that a lot of people think we'll see, but the best that I can do as an investor is to continue to buy and take advantage of that volatility that we're seeing. I think rallies needs to be sold, not buying the dip is a strategy that I'm not sure will work the same manner. It happened in the past. And I think there are places that are uninvestable. I've always thought that. It's giving you another idea of how principles are important and even though China is cheap, I do not, we do not invest in Chinese assets. I mean, we can only at Crescat only shorts China, if it makes sense. And so we are not long China and we're not long Russia. I don't care how cheap it is. Right. It's not, you know, not part of our moral views in general. And so I think, you know, we don't finance communism across the globe, I'm sorry to get there, but it's just not what we do. And so we don't invest in Russia, we don't invest in China. We invest in other places in the world that we think could potentially do well. And if they ever start to become like Russia and China, we'll exit from those places too. And so I think strategically we gotta think about China in Taiwan, you know, I think I think there's quite a lot of books about the situation of the Taiwan. I think it certainly has opened the path for such a potential invasion or takeover of Taiwan. I think the best way to do that is, as we started those issues with Ukraine, we have not seen the changes in FX in the Chinese market just yet. And so meaning the Chinese currency has been very stable so far. We added short positions in the Chinese currency, we've been short to Chinese currency for many years. And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. And but we think it's one of the most overvalued assets in the world today. And it is a major imbalance when it comes to banking assets relative to GDP. I have a very different view than most people that think China and Russia are playing the long term game. I actually don't, I'm sure they are, but I think, you know, Russia has been a total failure. I mean, just look at the currency and just look at the China, the Russia market in general. It's been a total failure. So. Well, Rubel what dropped like 20% or something overnight when all the sanctions started coming through? What type of long term game is that? That's been the worst performer in one of the worst performing countries in the world, I think. And so and so have Chinese equities too. And so I don't know, I have a very different view. I find it difficult to see large capital allocators going into China, especially in the next five or 10 years given all that's happening. And so you have to question what is going to drive those economies to continue to perform very well? In an environment where commodity prices are rising, you know, where is China going to keep up growing at tan, whatever they number, do they tell you that they're growing at 10% rate every year when oil prices in Chinese yuan terms is that the most expensive has been in like seven years or so. And so, and I think it's all questionable. No current accounts are going to become more on a deficit side for China relative to the rest of the globe. That is all very negative for China, not positive. India is in the same spot, by the way. And so I much rather belong Brazil than belong China, by the way. So there's a lot of macro developments here unfolding at the same time, but hopefully I shared some of my views. Oh, it's awesome. I literally love hearing just these kind of conversations and how other people view what's going on today and where the opportunities lie. Excite, yeah, I mean, what oil hit 107 today, you know, it's just there's a lot of things making moves that are just very fascinating to me. So thank you very much for sharing your perspective on it. We are at time. So I promise you I'd get you out the door. So I will honor that. However, before we sign off, I do need to say, because I didn't say it yet, I love your beard. I need to compliment the beards that I see support for beard movement. So it's very nice. It's not like you're, but it's beautiful. Beards come in all different shapes and sizes, and I'm a big fan. So yeah, thank you so much for your time. I know people, they can find you on Twitter, just like I did, which is at Tavi Costa, which I'll also throw in the video description for people that want to just follow along. You share a lot of great information, I think. So it'd be cool for people that are interested in following along. So thanks again for coming to hang out for a bit. Really had a great time. Hey, thank you, Eric. And thanks for serving in the military. Being a Brazilian, and I also appreciate that quite a lot. So thanks for doing that. My pleasure. It's awesome. Thank you. Perfect. You're that super fun. Yeah, hopefully you enjoy that. Yeah.
