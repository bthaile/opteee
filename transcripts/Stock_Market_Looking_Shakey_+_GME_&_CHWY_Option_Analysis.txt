0.25s: [Music]
0.48s: what up outliers we are back in the
3.48s: studio it's really just an office it's
5.04s: not a studio let's not church this up
7.08s: it's just a standing desk but we're back
9.48s: and I'm stoked we have a lot to look at
11.44s: today I want to go through the market
13.04s: with you all take a look at some options
15.48s: see what's going on out there I do want
17.16s: to highlight this new addition to the
20.00s: art collection this is a piece of
22.60s: scrimshaw it's like 2,000-year-old
24.92s: walrus tusk that they uh chisel into if
28.48s: you guys are interested I can show you
30.04s: closeup of it super super cool but that
32.28s: goes pretty well with the old mammoth
34.36s: tusk so apparently your boy just likes
37.28s: old stuff because that is slowly what is
40.36s: being accumulated behind me all right
42.44s: let's get into it first you know I will
46.04s: share another piece of the trip this was
50.60s: a helicopter tour I booked for us of
53.28s: bear Glacier that actually included a
55.96s: landing this was a private tour which is
58.48s: pretty cool we had a chance to go check
60.56s: out the glaciers in a different kind of
62.44s: way so I'll let this play for you it's
64.00s: like 15
65.26s: [Music]
78.84s: seconds so essentially we do some laps
83.04s: around up on the glacier here and then
85.32s: you can actually see where the glacier
86.72s: is feeding into this Lake I've learned
88.56s: that it's called caving where the
91.28s: glacier breaks off and falls in to make
93.40s: those big ice cubes I got a bunch of
94.96s: pictures of those and Drone footage down
96.60s: there that's uh really really cool and
98.68s: then we ended up flying down this way
100.92s: and then we've landed the helicopter
102.88s: somewhere over here kind of on the bank
105.00s: I had a chance to fly the Drone a little
106.68s: bit you know check out the glaciers a
108.28s: little closer overall fantastic
110.48s: experience I show you guys this stuff
112.08s: because for me this is this is literally
114.84s: all powered through trading none of this
117.64s: was uh even on my radar for the vast
121.60s: majority of my life and the funny thing
123.84s: about this helicopter tour is we didn't
125.96s: even really book it ahead of time we
127.88s: were just figuring out what we were
129.00s: going to do that day based on some last
131.00s: minute change of plans and we're like
133.16s: this looks cool and the ability to just
135.68s: go book this cuz it looked cool is
138.48s: something I never would have expected
140.24s: and I think it's really cool so while I
143.12s: actually think I probably spend more
145.32s: time beating you over the head with the
148.28s: difficulties of trading
150.72s: this is the cool part and this is what I
152.76s: try to remind people is that for me
155.68s: trading is interesting the markets are
157.80s: interesting however the real enjoyment
160.56s: again for me is outside of markets when
162.72s: I can withdraw my money and go do stuff
165.56s: like that with it which is really neat
167.16s: so I like sharing that with you all to
169.16s: kind of balance out the Doom and Gloom
171.16s: side of things because I am quite a bit
172.60s: of a realist and trading is hard work
175.24s: but there are really cool benefits to it
179.00s: once it's figured out so that's that all
181.20s: right now for those interested when I
183.40s: get the Drone video all put up I can
185.52s: share a Google Drive Link for those that
187.40s: want to check that out I did one for
188.76s: Iceland which is really really fun I
190.40s: don't think I posted the Norway one
192.12s: which is also really cool maybe I'll
194.12s: I'll get that up for you guys if you're
195.68s: interested but the Drone stuff is just
197.96s: kind of neat it's a cool way to
199.60s: experience the area and in a slightly
203.08s: different way all right so what's going
205.52s: on this week let's start with some
208.72s: general out look information so that you
212.84s: all have an idea of what to expect we'll
216.68s: go to the
217.88s: events and let's get this set up to this
221.72s: week and take a look through I haven't
223.96s: looked at this yet so I am getting
225.84s: caught up real time with you all this
228.08s: will be a chance for us to see kind of
230.36s: what's going on together so when I look
232.88s: at the 12th I see OPEC I see inflation
236.84s: expectations which that metric I am
239.12s: interested in and here we go this is
241.88s: really where things are going to start
243.28s: getting spicy is this block here on the
246.24s: 13th and the 14th PPI CPI month over
249.28s: month year-over-year it feels like these
251.36s: metrics just keep on coming out but they
253.12s: do and they're super important right now
255.80s: the market is at in my opinion such a
259.80s: delicate balance the fact that when we
263.56s: take a look at let's go into the
265.28s: flexible grid let's take a look at this
267.36s: the fact that when I look at this and I
270.56s: see how the market sold off in here is
275.04s: extremely telling to me extremely
277.68s: telling to me I'm zooming it into 3
279.44s: months and switching over to the regular
280.72s: indices so it's not blocked out by noise
282.84s: although the feuds are up just a little
284.72s: bit right now with Vick's down about uh
288.52s: 1.74% so I'm coming down a little bit
290.92s: bitcoin's down 2 and
292.68s: 3/4% pretty significant actually so
296.16s: anyways Sidetrack aside this is
299.16s: interesting me the fact that the market
300.96s: sold off this heavy and then had this
303.16s: kind of rebound so let's talk about that
305.92s: when I see the market get to these
307.44s: nosebleed levels I expect to sell off
309.52s: sooner or later just normalization of
311.40s: price taking profits like all of that is
313.36s: so normal then the market needs to fall
316.16s: enough to get to a point where people
317.92s: are interested in transacting again
320.28s: buying and that started happening here
323.32s: you can see this volume note is really
325.36s: really deep actually and then it fell
327.56s: off a cliff this downside move was
330.48s: pretty severe and this was driven by a
332.96s: bunch of different things the bank of
334.36s: Japan they had that unexpected rate cut
337.00s: or I'm sorry rate high can not cut wrong
339.08s: way and those kinds of things really
341.56s: start to shake things up against the
344.08s: broader perspective of what's going on
346.40s: on the US side of things which is we're
350.04s: still in an inflationary period
352.20s: inflation is still elevated we still
354.44s: have high rates we still haven't seen a
356.48s: cut and things are starting to show
359.76s: cracks we're seeing unemployment numbers
362.28s: coming in not in line with expectations
364.44s: we're seeing different economic
366.40s: efficiency indicators and just overall
368.84s: production indicators not coming in line
370.56s: with expectations really causing people
373.24s: to take pause and say okay this actually
375.76s: looks kind of not good now we finish
379.32s: this selloff we get a low of 510 after
383.28s: literally 2 days before we're hanging
385.16s: around like
386.32s: 550 and then it starts ring all the way
388.96s: back up to 5 32 and this is looking at
390.72s: spy so why why am I going into all this
393.12s: Preamble it's because I think this is
395.64s: showing you how delicate the market is
399.16s: and just how much this kind of
402.44s: information can have an outsized impact
406.04s: on what the price looks like in the
408.32s: short term and I emphasize that
410.16s: shortterm component because I am
413.00s: generally a perable and I think in the
415.56s: long run the US economy is going to
417.12s: continue to grow expand innovate and I'm
419.84s: just very bullish on the American
422.20s: economy until I see evidence that leads
424.28s: me otherwise but up until this point
426.20s: even during the darkest of times we've
428.44s: seen the US economy pull through so I do
430.92s: believe it's extremely
432.80s: resilient that doesn't mean in the short
435.08s: term it can't look pretty nasty and I
437.68s: think that that's quite likely the
440.16s: reason why I think that's quite likely
442.24s: is we have to also take a look at the
444.36s: Divergence now between spy and the
447.24s: Russell meaning small cap stocks take a
449.36s: look look at small cap stocks here they
451.60s: recovered as well but this small cap
454.40s: move does not look like what you see
456.88s: over here in the large caps and that's
459.16s: an important note so to me it still
462.32s: looks like small caps are under a bit of
464.48s: pressure they essentially gave up
466.08s: everything they gave us this was
468.28s: actually a really interesting series of
469.88s: trades for me because I played the
472.00s: majority of this runup via ratio called
474.04s: diagonals and I got chopped up in here I
476.32s: got stopped out a few times try to
478.12s: reenter got stopped out because I
480.60s: thought we were getting closer to the
483.28s: ultimate move that I expect occurring
486.00s: and then it did not occur just yet at
488.64s: least and well I guess it kind of did
490.84s: and then it undid itself I should say
492.68s: because this is a massive move this is
494.64s: one of the largest moves the Russell has
496.16s: seen in this reference time frame but
498.32s: then it gave it all up and if you take a
500.36s: look essentially it fell pre up move
503.64s: levels so I still view small caps as
507.44s: kind of the canary and the coal mine and
509.08s: if we can't see small caps in a healthy
511.60s: Place operating well that tells me a lot
514.32s: about the broader economy now notice if
516.64s: you recall during some of the update
518.08s: videos I did while I was on my trip I
520.88s: was really keying in on how these
523.88s: different days mirrored one another
526.64s: across the indices they look so similar
529.08s: right so if we look at the the fifth if
531.32s: you look at spy Q's or iwm it looks so
535.48s: similar in terms of the price
536.72s: performance then if you look at this the
538.80s: sixth very similar seventh so on Eighth
542.08s: so on and then the ninth what happens on
543.80s: the ninth Divergence we see S&P cues
548.48s: move in line very similar we see Russell
551.68s: turn tail start rotating over when
554.24s: everything else is going up so I key
556.96s: into that stuff pretty carefully because
559.04s: in my opinion we're at a point in the
561.08s: market where you really have to pay
562.88s: attention because it is so easy to get
565.72s: caught off sides in this kind of Market
568.96s: because of how visceral it's moving and
573.04s: what I again I'm talking about these
574.60s: kinds of moves the fact that over a
576.96s: series of
578.88s: relatively known Goods right there was
581.52s: not a bunch of shocks that came out here
584.12s: but it is starting to flag the
586.44s: conversation of recession
589.20s: and again I'm not here to try and scare
592.44s: people or make people feel good I try to
594.40s: look at things objectively and it's very
597.80s: clear to me at least that we are not out
600.08s: of the woods yet that the probability of
602.20s: a recession in my opinion is actually
604.56s: expanding the longer that this goes as
606.68s: it is and we see that starting to come
610.60s: into light here where if we take a look
613.00s: at the FED watch tool and we take a look
615.84s: let's look at the
617.12s: comparison and we take a look at 18 St
620.48s: notice we're at 100% probability of an
622.96s: ease that's already a change from a
625.20s: month ago where there was a 7%
627.48s: probability of no change not massive but
629.48s: still enough that it's worth noting this
632.16s: is really what's different the
634.00s: probability of a larger cut is expanding
637.64s: pretty meaningfully now this just
640.08s: waffled back this was a much weighted
644.52s: probability of a 50 basis point cut now
649.00s: it's looking like a quarter point which
652.56s: again it's just kind of interesting to
655.08s: see with where we're at now and how this
658.44s: is starting to line up I think most
661.48s: people are of the opinion that the FED
665.24s: is late and it's really easy to cast
666.96s: stones and throw at the FED but when I'm
669.52s: looking at the bond markets I'm looking
671.64s: at just the way that the market is doing
674.04s: I'm looking at earnings which is highly
675.84s: highly informative and you'll notice
677.76s: that from the newsletter this this past
679.76s: weekend or past weekend literally
682.48s: today if you'll notice in the
685.16s: newsletter there's really strong
687.88s: performance on a relative basis
689.80s: for S&P 500 companies big companies
692.52s: they're doing okay and they tend to do
694.72s: okay in these kinds of markets but again
697.76s: this is why it's so important to have a
700.36s: slightly Diversified view of markets and
703.88s: include things that also flash us some
707.88s: different perspectives AKA The Russell
710.76s: really helps with that quite a lot so if
713.36s: we take a look at Russell year-to date I
716.28s: mean we're essentially
719.40s: hanging right around we're like within
721.12s: five six points of where we opened on
722.96s: the year which is crazy it essentially
725.00s: hasn't moved so all of this is to
728.60s: summarize I think we are at a
732.00s: capitulation point I think that the
734.16s: market is going to be heavily heavily
736.52s: sensitive to information coming out like
739.52s: this PPI CPI month over month year-over
742.52s: year I think those data points are
743.72s: really really important I also think
746.80s: jobless claims really big deal retail
749.20s: sales really really big deal all of
751.88s: these standard inflation SL economy
755.56s: metrics that we've been using as a proxy
758.72s: are now I think under a microscope
762.04s: because again I direct you to this kind
764.16s: of movement we at a point where this
766.16s: thing can move pretty meaningfully in
768.68s: either direction now one thing I will
770.88s: say is I don't necessarily see this same
775.92s: downside profile from here the main
778.88s: reason Reon is because we've already had
781.36s: a a decent size selloff from being up at
784.48s: 565 now down to 530 in the S&P 500
788.76s: specifically in spy so this drop can be
792.00s: a little more aggressive when you're at
793.48s: what I would call nose bleeds highs like
795.44s: really really high on a relative basis
797.56s: near-term Highs but you can see that
799.40s: we're falling into these value areas
801.20s: where people really were stepping into
803.16s: buy so if I move my head out of your way
806.12s: and you look at this giant down day here
808.68s: look at the buyers that stepped in we
810.88s: had massive massive overall volume show
815.20s: up here which was people just saying
817.36s: okay yeah sell off got it but I really
819.92s: like this here long term that's mostly
821.68s: the positioning that you see there this
823.08s: is not retail Traders I mean of course
825.56s: retail Traders are mixed into this but
827.44s: retail Traders are not moving our volume
830.24s: from an average of 57.6 million shares a
833.32s: day to 146 million shares per day that
836.52s: is institution stepping in big time so
839.72s: they're kind of showing their hands a
841.56s: little bit now does this mean that I
843.52s: think that we're parabolic up from here
845.28s: probably not not unless we get really
847.12s: good information and I think it is going
849.00s: to be news dependent at this point I
851.04s: don't think that this is just kind of
852.40s: standard good earnings stock market
855.24s: moves up I think we are now heavily
857.12s: dependent on these other metrics so a
860.44s: lot of General ancillary background
862.52s: information based on how I'm viewing the
864.12s: market I wanted to share with you all
865.52s: because I do think that there's a lot
867.16s: going on right now and I think it's
868.60s: really important for us to have a pretty
871.08s: good sense of what's Happening how to
873.56s: position in light of this I'm going to
875.04s: go over this really far in detail later
877.36s: today with the outlier Pro members
879.24s: because I need to position my portfolio
881.60s: I'm just getting back from my trip I
883.16s: need to get risk back out there working
885.40s: but I'm not necessarily you know jumping
888.32s: out to throw a bunch of money in the
889.72s: market here I really need to get into
892.72s: the Weeds on where my capital is going
895.20s: to be used and I need to get really
897.52s: specific because I'm at a great point on
899.52s: the year I'm well ahead of my annual
902.04s: Benchmark but the other part of trading
905.08s: is not giving your gains up which I made
907.88s: a video not too long ago talking about
910.28s: some really prolific traders that were
912.60s: able to make literally hundreds of
914.20s: millions of dollars but they weren't
915.60s: able to keep it that's the other part of
918.16s: trading is not just making the money
920.48s: it's keeping the money and both are
923.24s: difficult in the process so that's that
926.84s: now let's take a quick look at up
929.24s: earnings because there are still things
931.84s: coming out we are definitely tail half
934.00s: of this so we have like 15ish per of S&P
937.80s: 500 companies left to go this is not
939.92s: limited to S&P 500 companies by the way
942.04s: this is looking at things with weekly
943.56s: options that's my general
945.20s: screener and we have a bunch of names
948.84s: coming up Friday super quiet with
950.80s: absolutely nothing that interests me but
953.32s: on Monday we have a few things that you
955.52s: can look at R ly spwr those are
959.08s: typically okay it's difficult to trade
961.92s: them but I don't dislike those I do like
965.48s: HD I do like Hut I do like Nu I like SE
970.40s: now these are not like in terms of the
972.52s: company to the upside it's just I like
973.88s: trading earnings in here I'll have to
975.64s: get a little more specific by looking at
978.08s: them and at their individual profiles to
979.96s: see you know what they look like to me
982.36s: but these are the names at least that
983.92s: I'm shortlisting to look at cah WK HSS
988.52s: Cisco go Stone all of those essentially
990.72s: are on Play Baba John Deere for sure JD
996.20s: no problem Walmart a mat for sure so
1000.04s: yeah there's a handful of names in here
1002.04s: that still look really really
1003.16s: interesting to me but I'm not at the
1005.56s: point where I'm going to be forcing
1006.76s: anything what I can say is that a lot of
1008.84s: the previous names I've been trading
1010.72s: this has been a really productive
1013.40s: earning cycle that's been really uh kind
1016.40s: of more in line with General
1018.16s: expectations we went through a couple
1019.52s: quarters not too long ago or it just
1021.12s: seemed like everything I was trading was
1022.88s: going way off into this new unfounded
1025.76s: territory but it seems like we're
1027.08s: getting back into standardized profiles
1029.04s: so that's what's earnings are looking
1032.40s: like to me coming up this week now I did
1035.96s: get a couple questions about a few other
1038.72s: names um one of them was a question
1043.32s: about let me grab it
1045.88s: specifically we were looking at uh Sofi
1050.44s: so let's take a look at Sofi quickly
1052.88s: this is for Oscar from the Discord and
1056.12s: he's asking about a ratio called
1057.80s: diagonal which this is a no-o for me
1059.36s: it's literally as simple as it's going
1061.52s: down so yeah I mean there's essentially
1065.04s: absolutely
1067.04s: no no other work required for me here
1070.28s: like it's in a downtrend again does that
1072.40s: mean that it can't go up does that mean
1073.96s: that this down move was overdone and it
1075.76s: can't go up from 664 to 73 no it can but
1079.36s: one that's a tiny move that I'm not
1080.92s: interested in and two again it just has
1083.80s: the the broader wind in its face not at
1086.28s: its back like this does not look very
1088.28s: interesting to me to the upside again
1090.72s: totally can go up I wouldn't surprise me
1093.20s: if we saw some sort of return to Value
1095.04s: up towards this point of control to be
1096.56s: completely honest but the other
1098.20s: assessment I have to make is based on
1100.32s: this movement it looks like it's
1101.68s: building a floor in somewhere around
1103.32s: here like 628 63 is so the downside is
1107.28s: generally limited but the upside Target
1109.52s: that I would have would be somewhere
1110.80s: right around this point of control which
1112.88s: uh essentially going from 664 to 730 is
1115.48s: just not an interesting move to me I
1117.48s: would want to see something that offers
1119.36s: more movement than that so yeah I don't
1122.96s: like it for a ratio called diagonal
1124.32s: personally that would be a absolute pass
1128.28s: the other question we got from the
1129.72s: Discord is from wrath asking about the
1132.08s: vix and we're they're asking um a lot of
1135.64s: volatility has been pulled out of the
1136.76s: market with no new money flow coming in
1139.76s: could that suggest that we're starting
1141.44s: to lean more bearish uh sort of it
1144.44s: absolutely could but I mean the vix
1146.60s: itself is also coming
1149.72s: down right the vix is not at this crazy
1153.52s: high elevated level anymore it's kind of
1156.44s: at a what I consider to be a generally
1158.56s: sad level for where where I would love
1160.68s: to see it we Zoom this out let's do like
1163.00s: a 5year daily I mean even at this
1165.80s: generally elevated level in terms of
1167.76s: this recent time frame which has been
1169.68s: obscenely low it's really not that high
1174.20s: so I'm not sure that I think much about
1178.12s: actually that money flow argument I
1181.96s: again would argue kind of the opposite
1184.36s: so if we go back to
1186.76s: spy take a look at the volume on this
1189.56s: day again this is that day I was showing
1191.80s: you where it had massive massive overall
1194.36s: volume 146 million volume and I'm
1197.84s: highlighting the
1199.20s: of that volume node for you guys in this
1201.04s: little tiny graph you're looking back 5
1202.72s: years this was higher volume with 51% of
1207.12s: that volume being by volume and you
1210.00s: don't really see that volume until you
1211.68s: get back over here which was another dip
1214.04s: that was heavily bought so I'm not
1216.48s: really convinced on the money flow thing
1219.56s: it really you know if you're using like
1221.16s: a money flow index depending on what
1222.52s: kind of oscillator you use it's going to
1224.32s: look at this differently but I'm just
1226.08s: looking at the the gross movement of
1227.68s: shares and there was lot that were
1229.88s: bought here so yeah there's that to me I
1233.08s: I don't actually think that we have a
1234.88s: bunch of money rotating out it does look
1236.40s: like that there's profit taking there
1237.80s: was money rotating out here no doubt
1239.96s: about it but then we had some serious
1242.48s: buying going on we had serious buying
1244.16s: going on on the eth and also on the 9th
1246.76s: so on the on the eth it was 93% buy
1250.64s: volume and on the 9th it was 74% by
1252.88s: volume and still on the eth it was above
1255.64s: the 20-day average for volume
1259.16s: so yeah I mean overall still really
1261.44s: aggressive positioning the other
1264.24s: question we got is about our fan
1266.96s: favorite GameStop and the main reason
1269.16s: why I want to look at this is because we
1270.88s: are coming up at least on the next
1274.00s: exciting week which is an expiration
1275.64s: week it's 16 a um I was talking with
1279.00s: Newton a little bit I actually need to
1280.76s: to chat with him a little bit more he's
1282.28s: not feeling well so make sure you send
1283.96s: your wishes that it feels better feel
1286.08s: better my boy but I want to understand a
1290.28s: little bit based on his assessments of
1293.20s: this next cycle what he thought was
1295.36s: going to happen cuz I think he felt that
1297.04s: the eth was supposed to be a pretty big
1299.56s: day I have to be honest I haven't caught
1301.16s: up on his videos maybe he talked about
1302.68s: this already but I mean there was a move
1305.56s: to his credit it just isn't really much
1308.72s: and I I think there's a lot going on
1310.52s: here GameStop still is part of small
1312.76s: caps which are not doing really that
1314.84s: great they're well small midcap but
1317.52s: they're just in a tough spot I would
1320.24s: argue and the broad Market is not
1322.72s: offering this a
1324.72s: massive back SL Tailwind now it does
1329.56s: look like we're starting to create a
1331.68s: little bit of a new base here which is
1333.32s: really good to see you can see where I
1335.56s: was originally expecting it to go like I
1337.44s: talked about before people were actually
1338.96s: really upset at me that I even talked
1340.88s: about it going to like 18 which I again
1344.60s: I I'm just looking at it as objectively
1346.32s: as I can I know people love the company
1347.80s: I know people want to to go up I want it
1349.20s: to go up I I have shares in it but I
1351.60s: still do my best to look at things
1353.16s: objectively regardless of what I want it
1355.20s: to do or not and just look at what it
1357.20s: might be likely to do and again not
1360.68s: exactly to where I thought it was going
1361.92s: to go here it hit a low of 1873 so I was
1366.32s: uh about a dollar off but this made
1369.52s: sense to me because we came down into
1371.40s: another value area that people became
1373.36s: interested but here's one of the
1374.84s: problems I'm finding is this I'll get
1377.76s: myself out of the way and you can see
1381.60s: that volume is just anemic volume is so
1385.12s: light it's so low even relative to its
1388.52s: 20-day average 20-day average is about
1390.36s: 12 million shares and what you're seeing
1392.56s: is half of that on most of these days or
1395.16s: even less so volume is is pretty light
1399.80s: and I think that's an important note
1401.80s: because it's just kind of like a slow
1403.44s: period for the stock as I see it now it
1406.64s: does have oscillators starting to come
1408.16s: on line so the CCI is starting to turn
1410.68s: positive again I'll get myself out of
1412.00s: your way but it's still not where I
1414.24s: would consider to be in by territory
1415.92s: just yet to the upside but this is
1418.60s: something that if it continues to hold
1421.24s: it becomes more appealing for me from an
1422.96s: options perspective but it's just not
1425.60s: doing what I would need it to do so I'm
1429.28s: looking at 640,000 calls against 334,000
1433.20s: puts so still call skew still a little
1436.48s: bit lighter than what it typically would
1438.12s: be for for a really bullish
1439.16s: configuration but this is still
1442.20s: noteworthy I don't want to diminish the
1444.04s: fact that it's almost you know 2 to one
1447.12s: here that's pretty meaningful but when
1450.32s: we see GameStop in like a really bullish
1453.12s: configuration it'd be like really really
1455.20s: high so I'm not necessarily seeing that
1458.36s: now when I look at this coming
1459.80s: expiration cycle we do have a pretty
1463.00s: stacked options chain now the 24 and a
1465.72s: halfs are really light but other than
1467.28s: that I mean we have 6,000 6,000 4,000
1471.56s: 23,000 and then it gets light out here
1473.84s: to the 30s does this look like a giant
1476.92s: gamma ramp to me honestly no it would
1480.00s: probably need a quite a bit more density
1482.68s: here but it could be if there is a lot
1485.92s: more activity but it just seems like it'
1487.72s: probably be fairly quiet as far as I can
1490.28s: tell now the other thing I wanted to
1492.24s: touch on quickly was chewy I had a
1494.16s: couple questions on this and one thing I
1496.12s: did look up is for the 13g that ran
1498.92s: Kitty filed if he wanted to trade if we
1503.20s: you know are postulating whether he's in
1504.96s: or out he would have to file an
1507.36s: amendment to the 13g if his position
1510.12s: fell below the reporting threshold so we
1513.04s: know at least up until now that the
1516.24s: position is still on to some degree and
1518.84s: we still don't fully know if he's using
1521.28s: options or shares it seems like shares
1523.56s: is my best guess but we just can
1527.68s: generally postulate that he's still in
1529.76s: it now whenever the transaction happens
1531.92s: I think there's a 10day window or so you
1533.76s: guys probably know that a little better
1534.84s: than me I I don't want to give you bad
1536.88s: information this what I think it is
1538.16s: about a 10-day window from the the day
1540.44s: that the change happened so it could
1542.56s: have happened 8 days ago and then we
1545.72s: wouldn't know until the filing if he
1548.08s: waited the full 10-day period in order
1550.48s: to file it but it does look like he's
1553.08s: still there the reason why that matters
1554.56s: is because there is a reality where
1556.68s: roaring Kitty is a Catalyst it's crazy
1559.56s: to say that that an individual Trader is
1561.40s: a catalyst but he is and what he does in
1564.12s: GameStop does serve as a catalyst for
1566.56s: movement I still don't necessarily think
1569.08s: that he's pivoted away it doesn't seem
1570.56s: like he's turned his back on the stock
1571.84s: at all my guess is he's just kind of
1573.16s: exploring the space he's looking around
1574.72s: the dance floor and he's playing things
1576.76s: as he sees it but it seems like based on
1580.68s: all of his social media history and
1582.44s: everything he's done previously it
1584.72s: doesn't seem like he's fully pivoted at
1586.84s: least I I wouldn't think that to be the
1589.32s: case until I saw something definitive
1591.84s: meaning something directly from him but
1594.16s: until then to me it just looks like he's
1595.96s: kind of playing opportunities as he can
1597.48s: find it which makes again from a trading
1599.20s: perspective it makes a lot of sense and
1601.04s: it looks like he's trying to play a lot
1602.20s: of structural Behavior there was some
1604.96s: interesting call activity that we
1606.88s: reviewed already in chewy and what that
1610.12s: means for chewy we don't know yet but to
1612.84s: me it looks like it's starting to run
1615.28s: right up against near-term resistance
1617.68s: which would be right about there and the
1619.92s: reason why I say that is because it's
1621.32s: right on this next volume node the next
1623.60s: resistance would be down a little bit
1625.16s: further it' be like right here off of
1627.88s: this volume node there so it's 24 handle
1632.20s: looks like the next general area of
1634.40s: congestion that it's going to be bumping
1635.80s: up into so we'll see how it runs from
1637.72s: there but this is kind of in a different
1639.64s: configuration right it's above the point
1641.20s: of control it's still has volume coming
1643.60s: in that's generally long volume so if we
1646.56s: look at the eth it was 99 % buy volume
1649.32s: that's a lot of buy volume which is
1652.48s: generally interesting to me when we look
1654.12s: at the options
1656.16s: chain I see
1658.04s: 256,000 calls against 184,000 puts so
1661.36s: way way less variance between call put
1665.60s: oi and their calls are kind of all over
1669.20s: the place right you can tell by all
1670.44s: these different colors which represent
1671.96s: these different expirations it's kind of
1674.04s: a mixed bag as far as I see it so we're
1676.72s: going to keep an eye on it the other
1677.88s: thing note though is that earnings is
1679.36s: coming up and that was my best guess for
1681.00s: that trade that I saw in chewy because
1682.40s: it was four right after earnings if I'm
1684.68s: not mistaken so to me it again it makes
1687.88s: total sense if you want to trade
1689.40s: earnings in chewy to build a position
1692.48s: that essentially expires right after it
1694.28s: it's on the
1696.08s: 28th and it's before the market so you
1700.52s: can gain exposure right around this
1703.36s: earnings release and that seems to be
1706.12s: what that position was but we'll find
1707.48s: out soon enough enough so quick kickoff
1711.04s: to the start of the week we have a bunch
1712.52s: of stuff to look at all of the live
1714.44s: streams are back online I'm going to
1716.80s: keep up with Newton to see if we're
1718.20s: going to do the gme live stream on
1719.80s: Saturday if we are not I might shift it
1722.60s: again to Thursday and just do another
1724.52s: solo one where I kind of flounder around
1727.04s: by myself with the help of you all to
1729.28s: help me figure out what I should be
1730.48s: looking at and continue learning but um
1733.28s: yeah I'm still talking with new we'll
1734.56s: figure out when we're going to connect
1735.64s: again hopefully he feels better but if
1738.12s: you guys need anything is always let me
1739.28s: know be an outlier see you guys later
