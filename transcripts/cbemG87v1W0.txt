620.00s: and
622.00s: that
624.00s: I
626.00s: I
628.00s: snake. There was a bunch of like these elephants. I actually forgot the names of these trees,
634.00s: but they obviously have like the specific Serengeti trees. That was like more of a juvenile elephant.
639.80s: He was kind of, oh yeah, thank you, Reese. This was the Moss I kid that was telling you
648.80s: with the snake. Then this is the elephant. I was telling you the more juvenile one. Thank
653.88s: you for letting me know Reese. We're not going to spend a lot of time doing this. I just
660.84s: want to show a couple since Lauren was asking. Going through Tanzania was super, super interesting,
669.16s: but not so much part of the safari. Getting out to the safari was super not fun. It was like
677.80s: literally several hours on this bumpy ass road. You just suck it up. Didn't enjoy that part too
686.84s: much, but like the overall experience was super fun. There is a bunch of these baboons running
692.92s: around and then there's a little black face monkeys. This is the cool stuff. There is a bunch of
698.04s: these like groupings of seemingly odd animals in some of these places. Then I have a couple photos.
706.92s: These ones are zoomed in super far. Those guys were far away. I have stuff I'll show you in a
711.24s: second. That's much higher resolution. But this, okay, so these are some cool photos.
722.76s: So that dude was being hunted. And in here, I was catching photos of all these different lions.
731.56s: The funny thing is, is like, as you look in this photo, this one I'm showing you right now,
735.32s: you're kind of like, yeah, okay, there's not a whole lot going on here. But literally this field
741.00s: is full of animals as you look further out. And these fields are full of freaking lions.
747.48s: And the lions are so, so, so cool. I'll show you some pictures of them in a second.
752.44s: Then I like this guy, the water buffalo just because they have these birds that like to hang out
757.00s: on their back. And then I like this dude, because is this super sleepy cheetah hanging out next to mom?
763.88s: There's mom actually like doing the cheetah thing. And then here's a little baby like,
768.84s: let me take a nap and a little tired. So I want to show you this was another juvenile elephant that
775.32s: was wrangling these guys. So do you notice the back of their heads? The only way you can see these
782.04s: freaking lions in the grass is their dark spots behind the ears. Otherwise, you literally
789.40s: cannot see them. So it's funny because when you're out in the serengeti, it like, you have to go
795.64s: pee, right? And it's like, you just hop out the truck, but you don't go that far from the truck.
800.68s: And one of the spots I was peeing like, I just looked out and I saw this. And they were having a
806.76s: bit of a standoff with that elephant that I was just showing you. Those interactions are just
813.48s: incredible. So like, he was just chasing him around. Oh, I actually have a video of it. Hold on.
824.44s: I'll kill the volume here. So he, oh shit, he was getting really, really grumpy with the lions.
839.16s: So take a look. This is essentially the distance that you see. So this pride had like eight
848.20s: lions hanging out. He was just walking along. This is one of the interesting things about this.
853.00s: There wasn't like a water source directly nearby here. The serengeti's huge and somehow this
858.28s: elephant just happened to walk across these lions and have this very interesting interaction.
864.76s: So you can see that he sees them. They're all like, oh shit, lions are pretty damn lazy. They
871.32s: don't want to move. You see how that one got up and just like immediately laid down
875.56s: all conservation of energy for them. And he's like deciding how he wants to go about this.
881.24s: And you could tell he clearly is not scared or threatened by them in the sense of approaching them.
887.00s: The lions are like, yo, let me get the fuck out of here. Layers is ears out. And the interesting
892.44s: thing about this dude is he was by himself. The reason why the camera's so shaky is because we're
896.20s: moving to keep up with them. It doesn't look like they're moving that fast, but they are.
900.52s: So we had to like keep scooting up to keep pace with them. But anyways, super, super, super interesting
907.00s: interaction between those guys. And then maybe I'll show you one more, maybe two more. Because this
915.16s: was a cool shot. I thought of again, whatever that tree is called. I forgot the name. The
921.32s: the giraffes were dope. They were like literally reaching over the vehicle in order to eat on the
928.28s: other side. I thought that was pretty novel. And I want to show you one other thing. The hippopotamai
934.68s: were dope. Big, big fans of them. This guy, this guy was cool. So this dude was just hanging out
946.20s: pretty close by us. But if you take a look at his freaking face, like this guy has been through it.
953.32s: It's to me, stuff like this is a really good reminder of how ruthless the rest of the world
960.84s: can be. We in Western society get so used to being comfortable and, you know, pretty much
968.44s: is good as you could possibly have it. And then this is a reminder, at least to me, I have this
973.88s: one blown up that for a lot of animals literally just surviving is a freaking struggle.
981.40s: So and then this is the last one I'll show you and then we'll move on. But this one was really
985.32s: cool. This one zoomed in super far about as far as I could zoom in on this camera. This is like a
989.48s: black horn rhinoceros insanely rare. So this was that in Gor-Gor Crater. And there's only a handful
997.24s: of these. I don't know how many there are now. Again, this was a while ago that I took these.
1001.88s: But this was like one of two or three that were left because of poachers. Poachers want the horns.
1009.80s: So a lot of times what they do in the parks is they tranquilize the animal. I had a buddy that
1014.12s: used to do this after the Marine Corps. They tranquilize the animal. They go cut the horns off
1018.84s: so that then the poachers aren't incentivized to kill the rhinoceros. The poachers weren't trying
1023.64s: to kill the rhinoceros because they cared about the rhinoceros. They just wanted the horns.
1027.64s: So if you get the horns off the rhinoceros preemptively, then it's so facto decreases the
1034.04s: need or desire to go cut us horns off. But it's super rare to see them with the horns like this.
1041.00s: They just very, very, very rare. So yeah, have done so far. That was super, super cool, really,
1048.28s: really fun. The elephants and stuff gets so close to the vehicles and that's pretty humbling.
1055.08s: You realize that you can literally just tip your ass over and there's like quite literally
1059.64s: nothing you could do about it. It just would be whatever it is. And then there's Pumba. I didn't
1065.40s: see Timon, but I did see Pumba. So super fun. All right. Lauren, I hope you enjoyed this slideshow.
1073.96s: But now it is time for us to enjoy a different slideshow and get into the markets.
1082.36s: Now, like I was talking about with GameStop in the beginning, the resilience of GameStop,
1089.64s: I do think is pretty noteworthy because GameStop right now is behaving a little more
1096.12s: idiosyncratically than I would have expected from the rest of the market. And that's actually a good
1101.16s: thing. That's actually led to a couple of adjustments I've had in my position, specifically
1105.72s: increasing the allocation because these lines, these are the same lines I've shown you a million
1112.68s: times now. I'm not drawing anything new. And if I do, I would tell you. But what I'm trying to
1117.64s: postulate here is where are the different areas of support and resistance where people are
1122.36s: interested in transacting? That's what I care about. Now, a couple of things stick out to me here.
1128.28s: This break below 22 was pretty aggressive. And then I actually remember quite a while ago,
1135.48s: where I was talking about at least where I perceived the potential near-term floor being around
1141.64s: this 20 and a half handle, specifically because that's where a ton of volume has transacted.
1147.96s: And a lot of people didn't like when I said that. They, I actually got an insignificant amount
1155.00s: of hate mail or even talking about GameStop, respectively, going down towards this handle. And as
1161.08s: you all know, I know that the community is so used to hearing people just trying to push down
1167.96s: GameStop. They refer to the Michils. So I get all that. It doesn't offend me, but it does give me
1174.04s: some idea of sentiment. And my angle obviously is completely different. My angle is just trying to
1179.64s: look at it objectively from as what I promise you guys from a traitor's lens. So the reason why I
1185.64s: think this 20 and a half handle is important is because so far it has held. And this now does serve
1194.44s: as what I would consider to be the near-term price floor depending on what news comes out.
1201.24s: Now this pullback doesn't look crazy to me. The stock, this is the weird thing about this stock,
1208.68s: is that it doesn't inherently look like it's moving a ton at any given point in time, right? Because
1213.80s: of the scale, but and it's because of these moves that distort everything. But if you actually
1219.88s: look at the existing scale here, these are still pretty significant moves that it's having. So if we
1225.32s: convert this to a log scale, you'll see that this is actually a really healthy move. So this kind of
1233.48s: price behavior, I actually think is pretty strong news for GameStop specifically. Now we know that
1244.44s: we already talked about its earnings. There wasn't a whole lot that stuck out to me from there. But
1251.48s: I want to take a look now at some positioning and I want to take a look at what the broader market
1258.36s: is kind of talking about with respect to GameStop. So one of the things I am going to do really quick
1263.32s: is literally pop through the news and see just anything that looks interesting. We can go back,
1271.64s: we don't really have to go back that far. Let's see. So 15 of April, Cohen,
1280.36s: ramse up 1 billion bet with margin-long, we know this GameStop's 150% yearly jump.
1287.40s: I didn't read this one yet.
1293.08s: So this is talking about its annual price performance and some of the recent breakdowns.
1299.72s: These kinds of lines are always funny to me, like outperforming tech behemoths such as Nvidia,
1304.52s: Tesla, Microsoft. This is really just stuff. It's like talking points. It's designed to sound
1311.32s: impressive, but comparing the price behavior of something like GameStop to Nvidia is just crazy.
1317.80s: And the reason why it's crazy is just the scope and scale. What would have to happen in order
1324.76s: for GameStop or I'm sorry for Nvidia, for example, to make these kind of price movements is just
1331.08s: tremendous. So it's not good, bad, and different. The reason why I'm pointing this out to you is
1337.08s: this is just pure fluff. This doesn't mean anything. It doesn't actually provide usable context,
1342.44s: not a competition between these. It's completely different stuff. I just want you to be able to
1346.20s: identify pure fluff when you see it. This is that. The combination of factors, working the company
1351.08s: favors. We know we're in Kitty came back. I was actually getting some people that were saying that
1356.20s: there was talk about the cat coming back soon. I didn't dig into that as to why that might be
1363.00s: the case or what the overall theory was behind it. But I just don't know anything about it.
1368.92s: Just relaying stuff that I've heard in case you guys have heard it. And if you have any information
1373.00s: on it, I would love to know. But I just don't understand the premise behind it.
1380.60s: This talks about the move. We know this.
1388.28s: Yeah, there's, I mean, there's really nothing else in here. It's just kind of talking about
1391.32s: the previous performance. This says that there is some pretty big trade activity. What is this?
1400.60s: Now, this isn't big. It's weird that they're calling a $40,000 trade a whale. This is actually
1408.52s: a lot of like pretty small trades comparatively. LVS is a pretty big trade, but that's about it
1419.00s: from here. So this is again, it's just people trying to come up with stuff to talk about.
1422.68s: That's the problem with financial news media is they have to come up with stories. And it's just
1428.12s: like any other news source, like they need to continually come up with stories. And you have to
1433.24s: generate stuff. So that's some of what I'm seeing here. I'm going to pop the door. So Thorgen
1438.04s: goes ahead and now.
1448.12s: All right. Let's see. Let's see. So this one is from the 17th.
1460.52s: We know that he added to his position. I think we already talked about that.
1470.60s: There's the margin long for Schwab.
1478.44s: I see. So he started getting in after the dead offering, which makes sense.
1490.04s: He has 170 million acquiring game stops stake.
1498.44s: And it looks like Allen, a tall, expanded, another 10,000 shares on the 10th.
1505.96s: So his ownership is 572,000. I mean, this is good.
1513.08s: And this actually explains a little bit of the recent price behavior. Because this honestly
1517.48s: is a little bit more of like a vote of confidence more than anything. The fact that Cohen is expanding
1524.44s: this far into game stop, it does demonstrate a level of confidence. And it is confidence inspiring.
1533.88s: This is why traders very often tracked insider transaction. Insider transactions actually
1541.80s: matter to us quite a lot because we can learn really important details from insider trading.
1550.68s: So the however, internal people choose to hold matters. So let's see if we can find.
1560.84s: Let's grab game stop.
1565.80s: And let's take a look at a few things really fast.
1573.00s: All right. So first thing, let's take a look at insider transactions.
1577.56s: So there's, I mean, just a pretty significant bias towards purchasing here.
1595.08s: So you can see over the last three months, there's three buys for 515,000 shares,
1601.08s: only two cells for 6,300. So it's been pretty quiet in this time frame. So let's see
1607.72s: if we can find. Yep. So he grabbed 500,000 and grabbed five.
1616.44s: And it looks like these guys obviously talked to do it on the same time.
1630.68s: And a lot of these sales are dealing with options.
1637.88s: Yeah. So I mean, this really does have a pretty strong
1642.60s: accumulation lean for the insiders, which I think at a time like now that actually matters more
1649.56s: than it typically would, specifically because with really the overarching lack of guidance in terms
1656.68s: of like, like, what again, like what is the fucking game plan for game stop? That still remains as
1662.36s: a very significant question in my opinion. So the fact that we still don't have any clarity
1668.84s: around that, but we do see internal accumulation like this that is good. Now again, like Chang's
1675.00s: position is actually like pretty small comparatively, right? It's $107,000. But
1682.52s: Allen, they came in at 257. That actually matters quite a lot because that's a fairly meaningful
1689.24s: expansion. And they hold now 0.13% of the flow. And then obviously Cohen came off the top rope with
1697.88s: 10.7 million dollar position. So much, much more significant accumulation there. So that all
1703.64s: makes sense to me. I love these ones. These are my favorites. These are just other like bullshit
1709.32s: meaningless posts, to be honest, pure fluff. If you did this 20 years ago, here's how much you'd
1714.28s: have today. It's literally always a complete waste of everything to care about those.
1721.32s: Okay. So now let's look through a couple other things though. I do want to see
1729.88s: what's the latest here.
1731.48s: Interesting. So overall volume looks to lean a little more, here, so that's actually kind of
1747.56s: interesting. Let's take a look on, I don't want to actually know, yeah, let's look on opX.
1761.80s: So all I'm doing is I'm eyeballing really quick to see if anything in here is like sticking out.
1769.16s: There are some actually pretty sizable trades going on as compared to the historic behavior.
1776.20s: So that'll be worth taking a look at. Let's take a look at
1781.64s: that vol overall.
1789.96s: And I want to see how this has changed. Okay. So the tail came down. No surprise.
1796.44s: So my guess is probably... Oh, interesting. Let's go to the beginning of the week.
1817.16s: What was that? The 14th.
1823.80s: Yeah, so frontfall is still running super high.
1833.72s: Super strong risk premiums as per usual. This thing that you see here is the entire reason
1840.68s: why the covered strangle is such a great strategy for GameStop. It's literally for exactly what
1847.08s: you see here. It really does maintain quite strong risk premiums fairly pervasively as you can see
1854.92s: here. This period obviously would trail down. The reason why this period would trail down is because
1861.96s: of the expansion and the move that you saw. This is all the way back in March. So it's not really as
1871.56s: as pertinent to like right now. Vol still remains generally elevated.
1883.24s: Okay, so let's take a look at just overall positioning.
1894.28s: Yeah, nothing's sticking out to me there.
1910.44s: Let's take a look at this. Interesting. So this is actually a little more aggressive
1918.68s: or delta decay and then Vanna. Yeah, nothing that's surprising to me there. Okay.
1936.04s: Let's see if there's any new readings. I don't see anything.
1940.12s: Let's take a look at one other thing. Just want to see that volume that we saw
1958.36s: where that is. Let's take a look at the last week.
1964.68s: Yeah, see like this is a big trade. This is a really big trade.
1970.20s: $853,000 trade 61 DTE.
1978.28s: The calls came in. Those are at the bid. That's a little harder to discern.
1987.64s: If we're being honest and the reason for that is because
1992.28s: we would innately assume that those would be sold calls, probably part of like a covered call.
2000.92s: Style position, but we don't know with certainty that that's the case, but that would be the assumption.
2008.12s: Now selling these deep in the money like this is for a few different reasons. This can be part
2014.52s: of actually building a synthetic position. What's the total amount of data? Where are these at?
2030.04s: 620? Yeah, so this looks like a synthetic.
2039.32s: The selling the call this far in the money, there's really no extrinsic value.
2045.72s: You're not even being able to really capture the risk-free rate on that.
2051.80s: That looks like a synthetic position being built.
2060.12s: Yeah.
2060.92s: The largest trade looks to be more on that.
2075.16s: Overall, really bullish premium, short premium for the 25th expiration, which is coming up.
2084.20s: The tails are actually really, really light. Notice how light the tails are here.
2090.92s: The 125 is only 33K there, which is actually really, really light comparatively.
2096.44s: This is that big trade you saw come through with the tens, which again is a synthetic.
2102.12s: You can't really read into that here. It doesn't add much value to us in our overall analysis.
2114.52s: Let's take a look.
2119.48s: Here.
2127.80s: Same same. So what we saw on Friday was broadly bullish net net.
2137.48s: 13 mil against 11 mil. So broadly bullish.
2141.32s: All right. Let's chill.
2148.20s: A little surprised that the options volume this past week picked up the way it did.
2155.48s: Again, not just the top size being 800K, but some of the rest of these I actually think are
2164.20s: quite large. I mean, there's periods where just getting something over six figures was otherwise
2175.64s: what we would have considered to be a larger trade. So that I do think is worth identifying.
2182.68s: We need to move this up. This is easier to see. This will go in front of DTE.
2191.40s: The premium information is a little bit more important than a lot of these.
2197.64s: And then all over OI. Yes.
2210.44s: All right.
2214.36s: Haggis says thoughts on RC putting shares in his name. I think we talked about that previously.
2218.68s: We actually spent a little time exploring the rationale and like the different reasons why,
2226.44s: but obviously you can see some of that coming through via the margin loan and stuff like that.
2230.20s: So it just looks like a broader financial positioning move on his behalf. That's how I'm looking at it.
2239.16s: Zach says theory was due to those 5,000.
2243.00s: Lock calls two weeks ago similar to last April along with the 420 date.
2249.56s: Interesting. Let's take a look at those really quick.
2255.00s: You said that those were two weeks ago. We'll just look at the last month.
2260.52s: And then I'll sort this by size. Let's move.
2267.16s: Size here.
2280.20s: This way we can sort by size.
2288.60s: 313233 and 516 expiration.
2291.88s: I don't see them.
2304.60s: Was it earlier?
2315.24s: Yeah, I don't see the 5k blocks.
2321.96s: Like at all.
2328.92s: Week of 4, 7.
2332.28s: Yeah, that's captured here.
2335.88s: Do you have a post or something that we can look at?
2345.08s: These? Because this isn't a 5k block.
2351.96s: Yeah, thank you. That'll be helpful. I think it'll be annoying for you to try to
2356.60s: like YouTube doesn't let you share links. I think in the chat here, but you can just drop it
2361.08s: in the in the discord. And then I'll be able to see it. So I would like to see if we can get
2366.60s: to the bottom of that. That's kind of interesting. The reason why it's kind of interesting is
2370.84s: because I also think people seem to think that there's like a monopoly on 5,000 lot size,
2377.72s: just think is honestly just a big mistake. It doesn't really make sense.
2382.52s: Because when you think about position sizes, humans really like round lots.
2388.92s: Like that's just the reality of it. So like these, right? 1,500 tons of 1,500.
2395.00s: So was it, wait, was it 5,000 block of options or stock? As I'm seeing you say that I'm thinking
2403.08s: you might be referring to stock flow. Call option. Oh, no, you get it because you're right.
2414.44s: You see you get me an expiration. Sorry. I'm just trying to make sense of it because I don't see it.
2423.72s: Let's sort these by size.
2427.48s: If there's any.
2434.44s: And we literally ran it. Let's cap it up 5,000.
2440.44s: Yeah, I mean, there's tons of stock transactions at 5,000.
2444.92s: So that would be easy, but it's not that.
2447.32s: Oops, one.
2454.60s: They were on 4, 10. Let's take a look.
2462.68s: 4, 10.
2463.40s: 33, 33.
2477.16s: Let's limit this really quick to the 33.
2486.44s: 33.
2493.56s: And time to those go through those went through effectively the same time.
2510.92s: Where we see in 5,000.
2514.92s: This is including all three of these is 4,432.
2523.64s: So where's the.
2526.28s: Where's the 5,000 coming from?
2531.32s: Adding the 31s and the 32s.
2540.04s: All right, the 3380, 2869, 720,
2549.56s: far, 840,
2569.96s: 11,0969,
2578.92s: Chris said all three strikes had five thousands.
2585.64s: Could you guys show me where?
2587.00s: Because based on what I'm seeing,
2588.28s: I would say that that's not correct.
2590.12s: I would say that that's inaccurate.
2594.64s: Based, like I just combined all of these
2598.38s: except for this 199 down here,
2600.88s: which we can add that in as well if we'd like.
2602.64s: It looks like it might be part of it plus 199.
2605.84s: So that takes us to 12,168.
2609.92s: Now, one thing we can absolutely piece together
2616.12s: is that this all looks like the same trade.
2621.68s: Coming in at the 31s, right?
2623.64s: All of these came through it like the same time,
2625.48s: but this isn't anywhere close to a 5,000 block.
2628.28s: So that's why I'm trying to understand
2629.76s: where the 5,000 is coming from.
2632.76s: Like that's not the case.
2635.68s: At least for what I'm looking at now,
2637.68s: there might be more here to look at.
2645.56s: But I don't see it.
2650.40s: So if you have any other details
2652.00s: unlike where that came from,
2653.40s: yo, could you drop that in the discord?
2656.36s: Yo, yo, rollo so that we could look at it together?
2661.12s: Or you can shoot me an email or whatever.
2663.96s: I don't know where you're connected to me from,
2669.12s: but I would absolutely love to take a look.
2676.88s: Yeah, I just, I don't see it.
2681.16s: And as you can tell, I don't look at it as when I can't see it
2684.12s: that it means that whatever it is is wrong.
2686.36s: It just means the first thing I try to do
2688.24s: is understand it a little bit better,
2690.80s: but right now I don't see it.
2694.68s: Maybe the 500 blocks, but even that was both different strikes.
2700.96s: Yeah, unsure, very unsure.
2706.96s: Zach says I posted the expose.
2708.60s: I got the info from, okay, perfect.
2709.92s: Thank you. Let's take a look.
2711.44s: This one. All right, let's see.
2714.76s: Where is this from?
2716.76s: This just says, I don't see anything in here.
2733.64s: That means anything to me.
2738.36s: He's talking about the 33s.
2740.76s: But yeah, this doesn't mean anything.
2742.76s: I don't think at least in my opinion, let's see what else
2747.76s: there might be in here.
2754.76s: Is he saying 5000?
2771.64s: Oh, because he's talking about, it looks like he's talking
2776.36s: about like the total volume maybe.
2784.00s: Maybe that's the case for the 32s.
2792.76s: I see it better now.
2794.12s: So what he was looking at was the candle volume,
2797.68s: the problem with looking at the candle volume like that,
2799.76s: those you can't, like that doesn't inherently mean,
2807.84s: but he just means that there were transactions there.
2810.60s: So that doesn't really surprise me that much.
2814.80s: And when was this?
2815.88s: This was on the 10th of April.
2817.80s: So let's take a look.
2825.44s: Here.
2830.68s: Yeah, I don't, I don't think there's anything here to be honest.
2835.68s: Because these are also pretty far out of the money.
2839.68s: On the 10th of April,
2843.68s: these were trading at 24.
2847.68s: So these would be six strikes, depending on which.
2852.68s: It's a little far out of the money, I think.
2856.68s: That doesn't, that looks like something very different to me.
2860.68s: Because for those that don't know,
2862.68s: we went through a pretty broad exercise a while ago,
2864.68s: where we literally went through all of the trade history
2867.68s: for the cat.
2869.68s: And there's a bunch of things about this that leads me to believe.
2874.68s: It doesn't,
2876.68s: it doesn't look like anything even remotely close to the cat.
2881.68s: The first one has to do with the sizing.
2886.68s: The second has to do with the strike selection and the DTE.
2892.68s: But there's a bunch of things about it that looks off to me from that.
2896.68s: That's not to say that it couldn't be.
2898.68s: As always, I will always, always, always provide the disclaimer.
2901.68s: Because there are things that do line up marginally.
2905.68s: But I mean, even the trade size is so light.
2909.68s: That means that I shouldn't go back to that.
2912.68s: Ortier area?
2913.68s: Ortier area?
2915.68s: And so there are a lot of things.
2918.68s: I'm sorry.
2919.68s: Follow-up would be important.
2922.68s: I just cannot pay attention to third terms.
2924.68s: Ormanninated area.
2925.68s: Has he posted this all a morning or four hours before 1976?
2928.68s: Will that have particular interests or some thought?
2930.68s: Why suggestion to them?
2932.68s: If you're interested about that,
2935.68s: interest. Remember, volume represents what traded on that day. Open interest reflects the actual
2942.72s: contract sizing, contracts being opened and then being maintained. So the fact that there was
2948.80s: that much volume on the day tells us that the contracts transacted that much, but it doesn't
2954.16s: inherently mean that it's opening or sustained contracts. Like it clearly, a good number of those
2959.92s: were actually closing contracts because if we take a look at the sizing that actually stuck
2967.44s: it's sub sub 5k. So yeah, interesting nonetheless. I absolutely say interesting nonetheless,
2978.80s: but yeah, thank you. Thank you for showing me because again, like I was saying, it makes it makes
2984.00s: way more sense now. I at least understand the lens that they're looking at it from.
2990.96s: Yeah, cool. And then I think there was something else you guys were saying about 420. Okay,
3000.48s: along with the 420 date. Is there talk to me about the 420 date? Is that just when you guys
3008.88s: typically hear from the cat? Does he normally post on 420? Just like a troll?
3013.68s: Or is there something else tied to that? It's also interesting that 420 this year is on Sunday.
3022.80s: I don't know if that means anything for the historic references from his time post. Oh, I see.
3030.72s: I see. I think people, I honestly think people. Yolo Rolo says, yeah, 109 to 420. Yeah, I see.
3043.68s: I think based on that, I mean, that theory just hasn't really played out, right? Like,
3049.20s: at least from what we've seen so far, I think what we saw on the timeline was literally a joke
3057.84s: to say 69 420.
3065.28s: But because I mean, nothing happened on the 9th of Jan.
3071.60s: And I know that a lot of people were trying to I saw a bunch like I got a bunch of emails
3075.44s: shortly after that came out with people, you know, sharing different ideas. And I don't think any of
3080.80s: them. I don't think any of them really led to anything. But it's exactly as Yo-Yo says true
3089.12s: to age, but it's so much fun. And that's exactly it because we know that the apes just love
3095.20s: trying to read into it and then see what they can piece together. Here's the funny thing I
3100.56s: find about that is I think the collective ape community is so much smarter than any one individual
3111.60s: person that I think the apes are able to create things that people wouldn't even conceive of on
3120.88s: their own. I've seen this happen time in time again, where the apes will say they'll come up with
3130.64s: a theory based on, you know, the different things that they see. And my guess is a lot of times the
3136.72s: creator of whatever it is that the theory's being based on is just completely unaware of the levels
3143.12s: to it like that. But it's really interesting to watch. I've had some of the most insane. And I
3150.96s: don't mean that in a denigrating way. But I mean, in terms of like overall complexity, I've had
3158.40s: some of the most insane theories shared with me. One of them was deconstructing the hex code of
3164.56s: colors and tying it, I kid you not to fucking hydro glyphs. And I was just like, whoa,
3173.12s: this is like some ultra instinct level analysis, whether or not, you know, it means anything is
3181.68s: a whole other story. But it is fucking awesome that somebody even does that level analysis is super
3188.32s: interesting. Yo, Yo says I thought it might be the end of a swap cycle. I don't, I just don't
3195.36s: think there's anything there. I don't, I don't think that the cat is sitting here posting about
3200.32s: the swap cycles. I think the swap cycles really is a, I think it's really a rabbit hole that yields
3212.08s: very little if any predictive value. And I spent a while talking with Newton to understand
3220.48s: what his thoughts were on the swaps. And we spent actually a while together pretty early on on
3226.32s: on a couple calls going through the tracker line by line trying to overlay the various swap
3234.56s: explorations. And the problem with swaps and the problem with any custom product like those
3244.08s: is when a swap comes due, there is nothing that prevents us at all from simply writing a new swap,
3256.32s: just extending it. That's one of the difficulties here. Unlike an options market where everything is
3263.92s: open ended, you can see the volume, you can see if people are rolling out, you can see what's
3270.16s: happening. Common expiration cycle and options. And you know that there's actual settlement also
3275.28s: on the table because it's standardized because swaps are not that they're effectively a black box.
3281.76s: And it's literally impossible for us to really pull much usable data from the swaps other than
3288.80s: knowing they exist because a swap expiration date really doesn't mean anything. There's absolutely
3295.76s: nothing that says that that swap literally can't just be rolled into a new swap. And because it's
3302.80s: not standardized. So I think that that's an important thing to keep in mind when we're looking at the swaps.
3309.36s: Haggit says FDDs all time high, XRT. Now the FDDs I think is a different story. The FDDs I do think
3318.00s: shows something. Again, I think there's two different lenses to look at this from. I think the FDDs
3325.36s: shows something from a activity slash market function basis. Now what they show with respect to
3333.92s: like a tradable event, I think that that's a little bit muted as well. The reason why I say that
3341.20s: is because again, we did a similar exercise going through periods where we found FDDs and try to
3348.40s: track the highest FDD timeframes that we could find. And in doing that, we still see instances where
3356.24s: price doesn't necessarily do anything. So because of that, you can't necessarily pull
3362.80s: high
3369.76s: high FDDs yielding some sort of price behavior. So if we take a look at
3378.32s: FDDs here, like this is a good example. FDDs here, we start seeing
3388.00s: absolutely massive, massive, massive amounts on a relative basis. But then price doesn't really
3398.08s: go on to do a whole lot. Now we can go down this list and kind of do this pretty regularly.
3408.16s: Like this is another instance where this metric was really, really high on a relative basis and price
3415.36s: really didn't do that much. So one of the problems that I find with the broader analysis people do
3423.20s: with this kind of stuff in the broader community is we really do kind of abandon
3430.96s: basic research protocols where we don't start the exercise trying to prove what we want to see.
3439.60s: But we start the exercise with ideas on what inputs we think might impact the market.
3447.04s: And then simply observing the price performance, volume performance results of those inputs.
3457.04s: And then objectively analyzing the output. So because I've downloaded this whole thing and I've
3462.88s: done different kinds of correlation and regression analysis on five day, three day, two day, one day,
3468.48s: follow on price movement based on percentiles of FDDs or what we would expect to see some sort of
3477.52s: hypothesation of shares. But so like this one, XRT, op-ax, this is considered a tailwind here.
3487.76s: And then we're supposed to go up 33 days from here. So this is the sex.
3499.20s: So if we do that, I mean, price had been rallying this entire time anyways. Looks like for a bunch
3506.16s: of different, a bunch of different reasons. One of them here is obviously the cat tweeting.
3512.80s: So yeah, I still think that there's a lot going on. And the market activity element of this
3521.28s: is important to track because I think it starts to show this game of naked shorting and some of the
3528.56s: ways that they're able to successfully manipulate and navigate around requirements for actual
3536.64s: locates and stuff like that. But I also think with everything that we've seen so far,
3543.92s: the probability that there are like these massive shorts that are just still out there sitting
3548.80s: open, I do struggle to see that. Why that would be the case given how low GameStop is gone during
3557.44s: these different periods. And with the prevalence of shares to be able to close out that risk
3564.00s: would be probably advantageous. So that's another one of those things where I wouldn't say it
3572.64s: couldn't happen, certainly could. But I don't necessarily think that it makes a tremendous amount
3580.24s: of sense to start the assumption from all of the shorts are still open. That doesn't mean some
3588.16s: of them aren't there absolutely could be. But there's been ample opportunities to close them as well.
3594.48s: And it's pretty clear at this point like the company's not necessarily going out of business,
3599.12s: right? Like the company is pivoting. We can see it. So the idea of just holding on to these
3605.04s: short positions, which still do require money literally for decades, hoping that the company ends up
3611.04s: going bankrupt really just doesn't make financial sense for those kinds of places. If they thought
3615.60s: that that would happen, they would just pile on the shorts as they thought it was actually going down.
3620.56s: But it's like super clear that's not happening. A company that has the position in that GameStop
3624.72s: does is not going out of business for the foreseeable future unless the CEO just rolloly
3631.20s: fuxx it up, which I don't think Cohen would do. So kind of a nuanced
3638.80s: kind of a nuanced circumstance all around is I think about it. But a lot of these
3645.28s: different triggers that I think that we've tried to tie and find correlations of so far have
3649.76s: been really soft. Now I don't know the historic price performance of GameStop around
3656.88s: for 20, which actually we can literally figure that out really fast together. That's easy to do.
3662.88s: So I'm going to grab some historic data. I'm going to move you guys over to this screen real
3670.88s: for. All right. No modes. All right. So what I'm going to do first, I'll just see if
3692.32s: chat GPT can handle it. If chat GPT can handle this, that would be excellent. It would be much
3696.88s: faster. If not, I'll just run it through Python. But this will be a little bit faster.
3704.08s: I'm analyze and plot GME's price behavior on
3714.24s: the line for 20 over its trading history include a standard deviation plot and forward price
3735.52s: performance. No. And price performance for five days into 428 close and five days after 428.
3755.76s: All right. Let's see. So all I'm doing is I'm just getting some really basic context of how does
3767.12s: this thing even tend to behave around for 20. So right now let's see how well chat GPT can handle that.
3778.96s: Oh, this is good. So it's doing, wow, this thing's coming a long way.
3785.68s: I'm impressed with this so far. So when you download.
3796.64s: No, I don't want that. I don't want April. I don't want 420 2025. I want each instance of the day
3810.72s: for 20 from each year in the sample.
3825.20s: Okay, cool. It looks like it's adjusting that.
3832.88s: Yo, yo, roll O says, but the price would have risen drastically if they had closed.
3837.44s: Not necessarily to be honest, because again, right now we really going into it, we have no idea
3845.12s: what the actual short position might have been. And we have no idea what time frame that the short
3853.12s: positions could have been slowly being closed over what duration. So there's a really big
3860.88s: difference between shorts closing all at once because of a margin call or because of some
3866.72s: sort of broader risk management requirement. It's a completely different scenario than if they're
3871.68s: just slowly closing a short position because the idea is now no longer invalid to take the idea off,
3878.88s: meaning, you know, thinking game stop, for example, is going to go insolvent. So the way to think
3884.32s: about that is like this, if we zoom this out, let's do 10 year monthly. If you look across the volume
3893.36s: over the past 10 years on a monthly cadence, it's hundreds of millions of shares during low
3901.44s: vol periods. This is a low volatility period leading into the squeeze that we saw in 2021.
3909.20s: And you're seeing volume still at 200,400,000, 222 million. I'm just giving you an example for
3917.12s: that's a lot of volume. So depending on how big the short flow actually was, which honestly,
3923.68s: we have no idea. That's another thing. We know it was over shorted beyond the flow. So like we
3929.44s: have no idea how big the short position fully was, which could have been fucking insane.
3935.92s: But that aside, as you look through stuff like this here, this month during 21 when we had the
3943.76s: squeeze, this represented a 5 billion volume. That's a lot of short covering happening right there
3950.88s: during this squeeze. And then that same amount of activity does sustain to a pretty significant
3958.08s: degree, 3.3 billion, 2.7 billion. This is all short covering as well. That's happening during these.
3965.28s: So an important thing to remember is like during the short squeezes themselves, there's going to be
3971.04s: short covering. But then following that time frame as well, there's absolutely going to be short
3976.32s: covering all throughout this time frame. Now does that mean that all the shorts are closed again?
3981.76s: We have no idea. That's the problem with trying to hypothesize any of this is like we're just guessing.
3987.20s: It's all pure guessing because we genuinely don't know. But I think it would be naive to think that
3996.16s: all of the shorts that were originally opened have just sustained and been on and have been carried
4005.84s: for essentially the whole duration. That's not to say again that it couldn't happen,
4010.72s: but I think it's naive to assume that. The reality is the things have probably moved quite a bit
4017.12s: more than that. But how much? We have no idea. Now going back to ChatGPT, we have our results so I
4029.36s: would like it to plot these. plot the performance. And include the percent price performance on the
4045.36s: specific date as well. So it's ChatGPT is going to make us a couple plots real quick.
4054.32s: And one of the things is when I show you guys these plots, I'm obviously doing it live right now
4058.80s: with you so I'm not vetting it. I don't know how accurate these are. I would absolutely
4064.32s: have to validate them. The first thing I can tell you though is we do need to access, used to access.
4074.40s: So we can better see the five day performance metrics. So this is an example of a shortfall with
4091.20s: ChatGPT. It did exactly what I asked it to do, but it doesn't know something pretty simple.
4099.52s: Like in this case, this you can't see pretty much anything. So really what this needs to do here is
4108.64s: have two access. The other thing is this access makes literally no sense.
4115.28s: Negative 5%, 15%, it's like completely fucking random. So it needs to also order these not by the date
4124.00s: because that's what it's doing, but to order it by the percent move. This otherwise it's kind of confusing.
4132.16s: Good. Next. Yeah, this is much better.
4143.76s: So I'll show you the revised one. This one looks much better. So what we're looking at now is
4150.32s: five day price performance leading into the 20th of April and then coming out of the 20th of April.
4157.12s: And that's your two access. So this second Y-axis, this is showing you the actual price performance
4165.20s: on April 20th. And again, you can see that it's chunking these by different year periods. So it
4173.36s: gives you a little bit of ideas on how it behaves. This is also just because of where 420 lands.
4180.40s: I would have to clean all of that to like fully trust this. But let's see.
4190.80s: So I mean, in general, the performance after is kind of flat.
4200.56s: And then the price performance going into it is a little elevated. We can draw some trend lines to more easily visualize this.
4213.84s: Draw trend lines for the five day performance lines and the day up.
4226.00s: So now I'm just putting some trend lines on it. So it's easier to visualize.
4232.96s: Okay.
4256.64s: Okay, it's struggling. It doesn't matter that much.
4259.52s: The takeaway from this is there's not really like this massive clear trend coming into or coming out of
4267.60s: the 428. And this is going back to 2004. There's it's seemingly a slight
4276.56s: positive side severity. But not not like a tremendous amount.
4289.20s: Cool. So we are pretty much at time. But I didn't have a chance to go through the positions. That's okay.
4298.40s: But before I bounce, I do want to just touch base with you all and see if you have any questions
4304.64s: or anything that you want to take a look at quickly together before I do actually bounce.
4311.68s: Yeah, we'll have time. We'll have time to go through and actually talk about like the positions on the adjustments that you kind of an idea of what's going on.
4327.28s: Joe says happy 30k. Did we hit it? Is it done? Last I saw it was like 2999 and change. No, we're not there yet. 29991.
4337.28s: So we are close, but not quite. Appreciate it though.
4350.08s: Zach says for sure I mentioned the other day to someone that I think the cat got out of GME went into Chui and went off on me. Oh, yeah, that's funny.
4357.20s: Yeah, well, I mean that move into Chui, I think definitely confused a lot of people, but it doesn't.
4366.88s: It's not like a. I could understand it now. Some of it seemed like it was partially just for a troll for some fun.
4376.00s: But yeah, I think I do think that probably surprised a lot of people.
4382.96s: All right, so let me just give you a quick rundown on where things set with the coverage strangle as we're looking in GameStop.
4395.92s: So things today it's still as the $25,000 allocation.
4401.44s: And this puts us at 79% utilized right now.
4410.32s: So the key changes from what you probably will have seen historically really stem from this.
4416.96s: There are no current long shares. I am completely out of the actual shares.
4425.36s: And I took the most recent bit of shares down for a loss on the 7th of April. So I'll show you.
4433.52s: And I'll walk you through what was going on here.
4435.92s: So if we take a look at the 7th of April, which is this date, we start to get a little bit of a rally, which is really, really solid.
4444.56s: But the basis for those options was 25 75.
4449.04s: So it's still underwater. And at this point, those options were originally purchased going back to.
4458.08s: Eight know eight know of in 7 Jan, those are kind of like the two time frames where it first started to be built out.
4470.56s: So here's why this matters is because as that position was being built from out here, you can see GameStop has been in a steady downtrend just down.
4480.00s: So that doesn't work well for my position in the coverage triangle naturally.
4486.08s: Now, as you'll see from what I discussed earlier, one of the benefits of GameStop is the fact that it has really high volatility.
4500.08s: That high volatility is really useful problem is if I'm holding long shares, I don't really get to benefit from the volatility that much just in shares.
4513.20s: As conditions look right now, I'm not seeing any artifacts or hints that there might be some sort of really large potential for a squeeze coming up.
4524.08s: I never know. Nobody ever knows. But there are precursors that have always happened before every single squeeze going back for GameStop's entire history.
4534.16s: We can see it clear as day. The first thing is volume.
4537.76s: So with volume actually contracting that leads me to believe probably low propensity right now for a squeeze.
4547.60s: And for those that might be a little confounded by what I'm saying here, we go back 10 years.
4556.16s: Let's zoom this in.
4557.20s: And let's go through some of the prior squeezes that we've seen.
4570.08s: So nothing in here, I wouldn't really qualify as a squeeze.
4575.28s: But this I absolutely still would qualify this up move.
4579.04s: And again, I'm going to squish the rest of this down because it doesn't matter right now.
4583.20s: I want you to just take a look at the volume.
4586.00s: So take a look at the volume well before it got anywhere near its peak in here, right in the low 30s.
4594.32s: Take a look at the slopes of short term volume five day average and then 20 day volume average.
4601.68s: What do you notice? I noticed that the five day is above the 20 and they're both upward sloping.
4607.36s: And I noticed that the five days growing rapidly.
4610.16s: I noticed that there were pretty significant volume spikes relative to prior history at this point.
4615.20s: That led from and again, this isn't like cherry picking the thing that happened the next day.
4622.16s: This is stuff that's happening within the first phases of this move.
4626.16s: So if you're looking at it here, there's not a ton going on and then all of a sudden volume
4630.72s: starts jacking. So then somewhere in here, you might be saying, okay, this looks interesting.
4636.00s: This puts you starting to look to enter around the 25 25 75 handle.
4641.20s: You absolutely would not have top ticked it necessarily at the 24 or bottom ticked at the 24
4645.92s: handle, but you still would have had a really good entry around 25 and three quarters for a ride up
4651.60s: to the low 30s. Okay. What I'm showing you is specific. What do you notice about the squeeze here?
4657.92s: What do you notice about the volume before the squeeze? It's the same fucking thing.
4663.44s: Quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet. Then interesting day. Very high relative to the other days.
4669.84s: It looks mute compared to the rest because of scale on scope. But the day preceding this was at 2.7
4677.52s: mil volume here 8.6 mil. So four times effectively the volume. This is on this day.
4686.48s: Then the next day it goes from 8.6 to 36.3 on the day. So again, you're not bottom-ticking it,
4695.92s: but this still looks at you starting to be interested around the 13 handle before it starts running
4701.92s: over 65 all the way over here. This goes this continues throughout literally the entire history
4707.92s: for this name and quite literally every other name with short squeezes. It's why when I
4716.00s: find interest and I'm paying attention to these other theories on how things might be going and
4721.04s: you know why things might be what they are on the cycle analysis and stuff like that.
4729.28s: There are interesting ideas, but none of them matter to me at all because I already know that
4734.56s: I'm going to see what I need to see before it moves, which is volume. So anyways, all the way back
4738.56s: to the original premise of this entire soliloquy and it's that volume is low and it's actually
4743.84s: contracting in 20s above 5. So all of that is what leads to the current assumption and then
4751.76s: thus the current reason to rotate from the equity position that I had into a short put position.
4761.12s: So right now I am short essentially a five-lot in a three-lot. All I did was look at the total
4770.08s: loss that I was going to take on these options or on the equity side of the trade, which is a
4775.44s: thousand seventy bucks and I said okay, what can I do from an options perspective in order to cover
4780.56s: this with options? That's exactly what this is. So I'm effectively taking in 1177, which over
4789.04s: compensates this loss on the shares and that's it. So I'm going to manage these short puts just
4797.60s: like I would as a short put component of the coverage strangle. You'll notice that there are no
4801.84s: short calls right now. That's actually temporary because my plan here is if slash when we see game stop
4810.24s: start to rotate back down to sub 25. That's where I'm interested in starting to accumulate some shares
4818.40s: preferably for me below 24. Now that doesn't inherently look super likely right now because what
4828.64s: you see here is a confirmed downtrend lower lows lower highs, then you see an attempted move
4837.28s: beyond that here that then rolls back down and confirms a second lower low and now it's in the
4844.96s: middle of a transition. Either it's going to start posting higher lows to complement this higher
4853.28s: relative high compared to this or it's going to roll back over and then start posting new lower lows.
4861.44s: I right now I'm planning more so for that second scenario because again going back to the original
4866.80s: concept for this whole thing I am a trader. I need to make money. I know that there's a lot of people
4872.08s: that do the whole little thing because they like just holding the stock wholly understand it
4876.96s: that is completely cool. It's just a completely different style than what I do and why I do what I do.
4883.28s: I need to be able to make money from the trade. So from the time that I was getting in with the equity
4888.88s: side of the trade it was a good time to get in when I was getting in based on the price activity but
4893.92s: it's slowly gone against what I needed it to do. So by rotating back into these put positions it gives
4901.36s: me a lot of things to work with. The first thing is I now am actually able to make money from the
4908.88s: passage of time via the short premium side of the equation. The second thing is I now have a
4916.72s: mobile basis to work with before I did not. Mobile basis super simple. With my original entries I had
4927.04s: an entry. I bought on the seventh Jan 25 I bought 100 shares at 32 23 and I'm sorry I bought it
4940.56s: looks like 200 shares there. Let me see 152 3 4 I bought 100 shares there.
4953.20s: So the reason why that matters is because that original purchase for the coverage
4961.20s: strangle that I was discussing with you guys here for the sake of the series. There was an original
4968.72s: purchase for 24 and then follow on purchase for 32 27 and then 22 21 and a half. Because of these
4976.56s: different trades I can adjust my basis by dollar cost averaging in and value cost averaging out
4982.24s: to the upside. However that's really the only way you can adjust your basis and the bigger your
4987.44s: position gets the more money you have to use the dollar cost average in and have any sort of
4992.40s: meaningful change in your basis. That's not the case right now. The case right now is the position
4996.96s: has a completely mobile basis from the short put side of the equation because right now I'm short
5002.64s: the 26s and the 24s. So let's take a look at what that looks like then. So if we go into the
5010.80s: trade tab we go to 16 May this is where the position is now the 26s. Those were originally sold for
5018.24s: a dollar 57. So those are about unchanged here and then the 24s those were sold for a dollar 41
5029.28s: which these are clearly making decent money not a ton but decent money. So
5038.64s: what happens is as I decide as time comes up to adjust the trade what I'll do is I'll start
5047.28s: looking at 30 May or whenever the next primary expiration opens up and I'll say where can I take
5052.40s: those 26s. So again for example the 26s are trading for the dollar 82. So let's see where I can
5061.60s: get a dollar 82 and get a dollar 82 easily here at the 25s. So I can take that trade book a profit
5068.88s: slide it down another point the 25s without adding any size. That's a mobile basis. So then if I
5077.92s: decide I end up wanting to close that position and then buy the stock because the stock starts
5082.08s: moving I can always do that. But what this allows me to do is make money as the stock is doing what
5087.76s: I don't want it to do going down and going sideways. You can't make money like that as a stock trader
5093.04s: or holding the stock you need it to go up. So this is a way to make money while it's not doing that.
5099.84s: So that's where we're at with the coverage triangle in GameStop. I'll actually probably make a video
5105.60s: actually I'll pop off after this and make a video on that since it's been a little while since I
5109.76s: did like an actual like thorough update video on GameStop. I hope what I'm explaining here at
5115.68s: least makes sense you'll probably get most of this but I'll show you some of the math behind
5120.32s: what I'm doing and why. But yeah that's what I got this what I got for this. Any questions
5129.44s: on any of that any stuff that we should take a look at before we wrap up.
5139.44s: H says let's try to get one person to sub to break 30k that would be sick. 30k is like
5146.88s: it's not really that big right from a trading lens but it's just absolutely fucking crazy to me
5153.84s: that there are that many people interested in options and it's a massive it's a massive motivator
5162.56s: for me to continue trying to innovate and to try to appeal to a broader and broader group to try
5168.16s: to bring this world that literally changed my life to other people. So it's really fun in that way.
5175.68s: Never would have expected even to be anywhere near any of this and again let's all be honest it's
5180.24s: not really like any of this is that significant but it still is interesting for me in my lens
5185.52s: because I'm not a social media person. I literally started all of this stuff in order to do this.
5190.88s: I didn't have like a presence before kind of funny but awesome gang well it looks like we're all
5197.12s: caught up. Tomorrow we have the outlier pro trading prep for the week ahead. I have to put on a
5202.88s: bunch of stuff. So the goal for tomorrow will be scanning the markets so that I can get a good
5208.64s: sense of some opportunities to put on because right now the portfolio is absolutely underutilized
5214.64s: compared to what I would like it to be at the moment. So that's the plan for tomorrow and then
5219.84s: for the rest of next week. We are back on to standard stream cadence so that means there will be
5226.40s: YouTube live streams on Monday and Friday Wednesdays kind of ad hoc. I'm not committing to it but
5236.72s: it'll either be like a market update video or a stream. That's the idea for Wednesday
5242.72s: and then for Friday we are starting a new segment which is a little mini series about outlier
5249.04s: options trading foundations. So the goal for the Friday segment for those that don't know the
5253.52s: Friday stream is really geared towards beginners. It's a super beginner friendly environment. We
5257.28s: spend time going into the most basic of things to give people a healthy space to learn about options
5264.48s: to not worry about getting ribbed for asking questions or feeling weird about any of that stuff.
5269.36s: But the whole premise behind the foundation series is I want to try and provide a good bedrock
5275.92s: for people to lean on as they start learning about options because they're complex. But before you
5283.44s: even think about learning to touch your first option, there's actually a lot of housekeeping that
5289.84s: needs to be done in order for anything you do in options trading to be even remotely worthwhile.
5296.08s: So that's the idea behind that series that'll be for probably the next four Fridays is the plan.
5302.16s: So that's what's coming up. If you have any questions you can always hit me up, be an outlier. See you
5307.28s: guys later.
