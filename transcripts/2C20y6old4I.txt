1710.00s:  Let's just take a look at standard market beta.
1713.98s:  And let's contextualize this.
1716.22s:  So if we go into spy, or not, we're going to nothing,
1721.60s:  we go into spy,
1725.72s:  and analyze the movement here.
1733.58s:  We can look at and actually calculate
1736.92s:  the compound annual growth rate, right?
1739.20s:  So we can see what the overall risk is,
1741.48s:  but this will also show you draw downs.
1751.76s:  Here.
1754.56s:  So if we take a look at downside deviation,
1759.08s:  it'll move around 2.8,
1761.76s:  the maximum draw down that you had was 24% in this time frame.
1766.20s:  And this time frame wasn't that nasty, by the way.
1769.80s:  So without getting into skew,
1773.08s:  the kurtosis, those kinds of metrics,
1776.72s:  what I want you to pay attention to
1779.12s:  is that in the pursuit of getting your standard return
1785.42s:  and let's see what that was here in this context,
1790.36s:  14%,
1792.88s:  ish, for the period 14.59%.
1799.32s:  So its compound annual growth rate was 14.6%.
1803.16s:  So to get your 14.6%,
1806.88s:  you had an 18% down year,
1810.64s:  and you also had a 24% draw down.
1815.04s:  Yet, there are still traders out there under the guise
1820.20s:  that they're going to be able to smash the performance
1823.08s:  of the benchmark and have less risk doing so.
1829.92s:  I regret to inform you,
1832.20s:  Santa Claus also is not fucking real.
1836.20s:  And neither is this.
1841.64s:  Now what we can do is structure portfolio
1846.00s:  that makes sense and that's robust and resilient
1849.52s:  so that as it goes through draw down,
1851.84s:  and as it experiences risk, it's tolerable
1854.40s:  and it doesn't hurt us, that's good.
1857.20s:  So all that stuff aside,
1859.80s:  let's take a quick look through and see what comes to our mind.
1865.56s:  Well, a few things really stick out to me.
1868.20s:  Right now is a literally perfect time
1872.84s:  to start setting alerts.
1875.44s:  I have more alerts on right now than essentially ever before.
1879.80s:  And what I'm doing is I'm just perusing through
1883.68s:  a watch list of things that I'm interested in
1887.32s:  and I'm literally tracking them on their way down.
1890.68s:  So IonQ is one that I'm interested in
1893.24s:  and it's actually up a little bit today, interestingly.
1896.00s:  IonQ is a ticker I'm interested in.
1898.00s:  I really do want to gain exposure to this.
1901.20s:  So what I'm doing is I'm setting all these different alerts
1907.16s:  so that as it starts to gain life,
1911.76s:  and I actually need another one now above the point of control,
1914.60s:  as it starts to gain life, I will know about it.
1917.44s:  And then I can start phasing into positions to the upside.
1923.44s:  But right now, take a look at Amazon.
1926.00s:  When did we spoke about Amazon a while ago
1930.36s:  back when it was like up here?
1932.56s:  And we had talked about I want to put a ratio
1936.28s:  called diagonal on in here, because I like Amazon.
1939.52s:  But the issue is when this was happening,
1943.80s:  it was impossible for me to rationalize it.
1946.40s:  It couldn't be rationalized at this juncture.
1949.76s:  And I haven't redrawn this line
1951.92s:  and it's just been cratering.
1955.44s:  Now it just closed below a 100 day moving average
1959.00s:  and it has a ways to go at this point,
1961.72s:  which is actually a little deeper than I would have expected.
1966.12s:  But what I can tell you is man, am I fucking glad
1970.88s:  that I didn't get into this way up here?
1974.52s:  I have no problem waiting,
1976.96s:  accepting the fact that I will never bottom tick stuff
1980.84s:  or top tick stuff, even the shorts that I put on Friday.
1984.88s:  Like I told you, those are prospecting positions.
1987.64s:  So those are positions that are put on to gain exposure,
1990.96s:  but they're not sized up as like full trades.
1994.32s:  And it's because again, uncertainty working
1997.32s:  with an ambiguous environment.
1999.84s:  Now today I was able to scale in,
2001.60s:  but guess what that means?
2003.28s:  Even though they were showing a profit from Friday into today,
2006.48s:  they're not showing anywhere near the size of profit
2008.44s:  that they would have if they were full size trades.
2010.72s:  That's the drawback of my style of trading
2013.76s:  is I don't wait for excessive confirmation,
2017.16s:  but I absolutely wait for base level confirmation
2021.72s:  so that I'm not playing the game of putting trades on
2025.88s:  that continually move against me and stop me out,
2029.64s:  that just increases transaction costs,
2032.40s:  which for larger portfolios is kind of annoying.
2038.20s:  Because even to put on trades at size,
2041.96s:  even with pretty solid negotiated commissions is not easy.
2047.04s:  So you get in a bit of a sticky spot
2051.40s:  with a portfolio trying to phase into a position.
2055.40s:  Now this here still looks interesting,
2060.72s:  but this is no good.
2062.52s:  This is not a company that I would want to take
2064.60s:  to the short side personally.
2066.60s:  I like Amazon and I think that in the longer run,
2070.88s:  they're way more likely to look solid,
2074.68s:  but not right now.
2076.84s:  So this is another example of just taking a tactical pause.
2081.56s:  This is the same thing in this QBTS.
2085.76s:  QBTS I liked it and it actually looked like
2088.68s:  it was starting to behave well.
2090.32s:  And it still might because it's still
2092.52s:  in a general ascending pattern,
2094.72s:  but now what I need to do is set up a bunch of alerts
2097.44s:  really quick so that I can monitor how it behaves
2101.28s:  against this broader trend line that looks to be developing
2104.36s:  from here, here, here, here.
2106.76s:  I'm a down here.
2109.76s:  Not so much.
2110.76s:  I would prefer to draw it from here.
2114.04s:  I think that this is more relevant.
2119.76s:  So this is now another one that we need to watch,
2126.52s:  or at least I need to watch.
2128.52s:  But this is also a wait.
2133.00s:  And then there was another one that we came across last night
2137.36s:  in the pro stream that I'm also interested in is VST.
2141.68s:  And VST, again, another name looks good overall,
2146.92s:  strong company in general overall, right now, that ain't it.
2152.12s:  So what I'm finding and the reason why I'm going through this
2154.76s:  kind of annoying process probably to listen to,
2157.00s:  because I'm saying the same thing about different names,
2159.52s:  is I'm trying to show you that looking at different things
2161.92s:  right now, I'm seeing generally the same thing.
2164.64s:  So that tells me that this is not a really solid time
2169.12s:  to be prospecting on new trades in terms of bullish direction
2174.84s:  until this digests out.
2178.00s:  Now I still do have exposure like I already told you
2181.96s:  via the coverage triangle on a couple other ratio
2184.04s:  called diagonals, like I still have that ratio
2185.92s:  called diagonal and palancier, it's looking ugly now.
2188.56s:  It's no longer a profit at all, it wasn't profit previously,
2191.48s:  but not no more.
2192.76s:  And unlike what I've been doing with the covered
2197.92s:  strangle and phasing out of the profitable position
2202.80s:  as it's contracting so that I'm locking in a profit
2206.56s:  and decreasing total risk until I get to my desired risk allocation,
2211.56s:  which is what I'm at now.
2213.16s:  So for SSO, I'm in 13% equity, T triple Q's 12% equity,
2221.04s:  this is of the total allocation.
2222.84s:  And then I bit down to 14% equity.
2225.68s:  That was over 70% previously.
2228.92s:  So most of the risk that I'm carrying right now
2232.00s:  in all of these is through the cash secured puts.
2235.64s:  Now, one of the notes though is I absolutely
2240.80s:  and willing to continue phasing these positions on.
2246.32s:  The problem is I can't fully rationalize it right now.
2252.28s:  And what I do is I settle alerts so that as they start
2256.28s:  to recover and look healthy, then I can get back in.
2260.28s:  And the reason why I use short puts is because it's a way
2263.92s:  for me to monetize the downside move,
2266.76s:  the expansion and volatility.
2269.72s:  Most of those, I mean, I'm less than,
2274.76s:  I'm about 54% utilized in TQ's,
2278.04s:  50% utilized in SSO, 48% utilized in IBIT.
2282.68s:  Yet for all of them, the cheapest premium return on capital
2288.16s:  that I'm getting right now for the duration,
2289.88s:  which is 30 days for most of them, around 30 days or so,
2296.20s:  is over 3%.
2299.04s:  So it means that on those puts for the allocated capital
2302.80s:  I'm making 3% of the money.
2305.04s:  And that's okay for me.
2307.08s:  Now that's not gonna pace if the market is flying,
2310.44s:  which is why I phased into equity during those phases.
2313.88s:  But this is exactly how I use two different methodologies
2319.24s:  at well, three different methodologies in one strategy.
2321.88s:  When I'm trading the covered string goal,
2323.80s:  I'm trading via dollar cost averaging,
2326.84s:  short puts below basis, value averaging,
2330.56s:  trimming off risk from selling equity position
2334.20s:  as I get favorable moves,
2336.04s:  and then also risk premiums through the short options legs.
2342.72s:  So maintaining that total split,
2348.44s:  it gives me a way to make money even though,
2352.28s:  for example, while I've been in T-Triple Q's,
2356.20s:  the underlying is had a 6.5% positive move
2360.68s:  from when I first entered,
2362.64s:  but the covered string goal position that I'm in right now
2364.84s:  is up 11.2%.
2367.12s:  So it's almost double.
2368.56s:  And then if I look at SSO, SSO is up 0.33%,
2372.84s:  and the return on invested capital for the covered string goal
2376.24s:  is 2% is of now, which is obviously with that contraction.
2382.32s:  So a lot of these based on,
2384.56s:  that's based on the open position as well, by the way,
2387.04s:  because I've phased out of quite a lot of these.
2392.24s:  And it's just so that I'm not holding stuff
2394.52s:  as it's going down, it's bad practice,
2396.08s:  tough way to make money that way.
2398.96s:  So that's what I'm seeing in general.
2402.64s:  Now we can take a couple minutes
2405.00s:  if you have specific questions that you have.
2407.52s:  Now's a great time to do that.
2408.92s:  Probably have like another 10 minutes or so
2411.16s:  before I got a hop off.
2413.44s:  If there's specific things that you would like to look for,
2416.20s:  happy to do that now.
2418.24s:  But I think the market to summarize all that
2422.32s:  we're at a point where we need to wait and see
2425.04s:  how this settles out.
2426.60s:  I'm not a big fan of the recent price action in Spy.
2432.72s:  It's aggressive enough and broad enough
2436.48s:  that this is why I'm not nibbling on the way down.
2440.00s:  It needs to normalize a little bit.
2443.16s:  Dark Jen says, look at GME, exclamation point.
2446.44s:  Unfortunately, you're missing literally the golden way
2451.40s:  to phrase that.
2453.52s:  The way that your grandma would force you to phrase that
2458.52s:  in order to get what you want with a higher likelihood.
2464.32s:  So we'll see if you can spot your error.
2467.24s:  There you go.
2468.72s:  Of course we can look at GME.
2470.16s:  Let's do that.
2472.56s:  Bad.
2474.32s:  Yeah, GME is bad.
2475.92s:  So I will still do my GME update video tomorrow.
2480.16s:  I literally talked about this exact,
2483.40s:  expected behavior to move into these value areas.
2487.44s:  The dip below is not too different than what we saw here,
2492.84s:  with price challenging some of this.
2497.52s:  To the bottom end.
2500.48s:  But it's now closing below really long term moving averages.
2505.20s:  Breath is not looking good.
2507.16s:  It's effectively rolling over.
2509.64s:  So we need to see if it starts to consolidate anywhere in here.
2516.16s:  And if so great, but right now it's simply not.
2521.68s:  So it's been on a pretty steep decline,
2525.16s:  even given its slight breath of air on Friday.
2529.88s:  So I'll do a deeper analysis with GameStop tomorrow.
2532.60s:  If you have any specific questions on it,
2534.20s:  happy to take a look.
2535.48s:  But I'll save like the the thorough looking through the option,
2539.00s:  showing you the volatility and all that stuff.
2540.60s:  I'll save all that for the video tomorrow.
2544.24s:  Shamgar says, when you place covered calls in your strangles,
2546.64s:  do you use, do you use your cost basis based on your purchase
2551.40s:  of your puts without the premiums you collected?
2553.72s:  Or do you figure in your premiums for your cost basis?
2556.08s:  If you watch the videos from the covered strangle playlist,
2560.52s:  it'll walk through all of that for you.
2562.60s:  So let me grab and then obviously I'll give you a cliff notes
2565.52s:  version, but the covered strangle playlist
2569.24s:  will go through all of that.
2570.36s:  Where's it at?
2573.76s:  Here.
2576.28s:  So Shamgar, that playlist is for you that's on the covered strangle.
2580.36s:  Here's here's the reality.
2582.52s:  Adjusted cost basis is fucking fake.
2586.00s:  It's literally fake.
2587.52s:  It doesn't mean anything.
2589.60s:  It is the massive, it's the most massive coping mechanism
2595.56s:  for people that cannot handle losing positions.
2598.40s:  It's literally like a child that's covering their ears
2601.76s:  and closing their eyes because they don't want to see something
2604.96s:  except instead of it being a monster that's in your,
2609.04s:  in your mind, it's your parents telling you to do something
2612.64s:  you don't want to do.
2614.00s:  It's literally children.
2617.44s:  And here's why it's children because when you sell options,
2626.64s:  so if we grab our handy dandy notebook.
2631.40s:  So if I sell, let's say I sell to open a put,
2637.24s:  a put, so it's supposed to open one put,
2641.08s:  which is called like a 10 put and I get a dollar.
2646.24s:  If big if if you wanted to include this
2652.24s:  into this basis, if you're assigned, I don't hate that.
2656.72s:  I don't do it.
2657.72s:  I don't hate it though.
2659.28s:  I can see a more logical tie to this.
2663.68s:  And the way that I think about it is use
2668.08s:  what your brokerage platform gives you.
2671.20s:  The majority of brokerage platforms don't do this.
2676.32s:  Here's the issue.
2679.60s:  The basis is whatever the basis is.
2686.04s:  That's it.
2687.60s:  People don't like that.
2689.44s:  People will say my basis is 20,
2694.36s:  but the stock is at 10,
2698.08s:  but I sold all these calls over here.
2702.44s:  So my basis isn't 20.
2704.60s:  My basis is actually 15.
2707.12s:  So I'm doing better.
2709.76s:  It doesn't mean anything.
2712.48s:  It literally doesn't mean anything.
2714.72s:  What we're doing is taking money from another trade
2719.24s:  and just applying it in another spot.
2721.52s:  It's it is the quintessential definition
2726.00s:  of bullshit mental gymnastics
2728.20s:  because you don't like reality, not you personally,
2730.80s:  but the person that does this.
2733.28s:  If you show me somebody that does this kind of accounting
2737.64s:  and does this adjusted cost basis bullshit for selling calls,
2742.00s:  I guarantee you I can show somebody
2744.44s:  that has a problem with losing trades.
2747.28s:  That is completely immature
2749.52s:  with respect to the realities of trading.
2752.44s:  That's facts.
2755.04s:  So what we're like to make this example a little more clear
2760.04s:  maybe is let's say that I also bought an option
2764.20s:  and something else.
2765.12s:  Let's say I bought to open a call
2767.76s:  and let's say that this one's an XYZ or XYZ
2772.36s:  and I'm dyslexic and started writing that way.
2775.64s:  So let's say you bought your call
2777.40s:  and let's say while this one went down, XY went up
2780.92s:  and let's say you made a dollar on this one.
2784.92s:  Do we take the dollar from this one
2787.32s:  and put it into this one?
2790.68s:  No, it's a different fucking trade.
2795.12s:  So the ultimate summary for all of this though
2799.88s:  is that regardless if you do it this way
2803.48s:  or if you just keep your basis at whatever it is,
2807.28s:  it's all gonna come out in the wash.
2809.12s:  Your aggregate PNL is the exact same.
2814.24s:  So I think it's so much better
2816.64s:  and way more beneficial to the trader
2819.20s:  to just accept the basis as whatever it is.
2825.60s:  Don't do this bullshit of trying to adjust your basis
2830.64s:  using money from other trades
2832.96s:  because then if we're rolling the call,
2835.12s:  do we adjust our basis up?
2837.20s:  I've never heard of anybody do that, which is interesting.
2844.80s:  Weird, huh?
2846.80s:  But we're okay with adjusting it to the side
2848.88s:  that's favorable to us.
2850.88s:  Doesn't make any sense.
2853.96s:  Reese says, Nike, what do you make of names
2856.32s:  that show strength in a market like this?
2858.76s:  Well, I think Nike has just been looking really terrible
2863.12s:  I think it's too early to tell in terms of showing market strength
2867.60s:  because they're also moving on news.
2870.56s:  So it's not the same thing.
2872.84s:  If it's something that is moving because of overall strength,
2879.20s:  that's one story, but I don't think that's the story
2882.96s:  as it sits right now with Nike.
2886.16s:  Because if I look at Nike in a broader context,
2891.20s:  it's terrible.
2893.12s:  So I think the movement that you're seeing in Nike is
2897.60s:  movement that's coming from a company that's been cut in half plus
2902.88s:  over the last three years.
2904.88s:  And they still have a viable business.
2908.28s:  They can only go so low.
2910.56s:  And I think it's mostly that tied with some news.
2914.76s:  So I like I do think that to your broader point
2918.36s:  that there are pockets of strength that you will find
2920.96s:  right now today.
2922.16s:  We can literally run a scan and see what did that exact thing
2926.48s:  for us because it exists.
2928.24s:  I look at it every single day and there are always names
2934.80s:  that do this for us that perform.
2937.16s:  But this wouldn't be one of them in my world personally.
2945.44s:  So if we take a look at things that have had a pretty solid day
2949.64s:  that have had a completely different story, I was so stupid.
2954.52s:  So I literally was going down to type in the ticker,
2958.44s:  but I forgot that I pulled out this little drawing pad here.
2961.88s:  This is what I draw on for you guys.
2963.88s:  And I was like about to type in on the drawing pad
2968.44s:  instead of the keyboard.
2970.20s:  Totally, totally miss that.
2974.04s:  But something like this.
2975.96s:  CYD.
2977.00s:  CYD is been crushing it.
2980.76s:  And it's been crushing it since the 14th.
2983.40s:  This popped up on my list on this day.
2986.36s:  And this is a simple literally just long trade.
2991.88s:  Now I don't love the overall ticker.
2995.72s:  The reason I don't love it is because I'm not a big fan
2999.24s:  in investing in Chinese companies.
3002.68s:  It's just because I don't have enough confidence in the reporting.
3008.36s:  I just know that the way that they do accounting is different.
3012.12s:  And there is some fuckery of foot sometimes.
3015.64s:  But I won't deny movements either.
3018.20s:  So as soon as this thing started showing this kind of strength on this kind of volume,
3022.20s:  volume literally went from 23,000 up to 270,000 over the course of a day.
3030.04s:  Right?
3031.00s:  So with that kind of movement,
3033.72s:  that was an easy choice.
3035.24s:  So there's and there's a lot of strength right now in Chinese companies.
3038.92s:  L&D or I'm sorry, L&C is another that's been showing strength for a while now.
3046.92s:  Another is CMPX.
3049.08s:  All of these are up on the day, by the way.
3053.72s:  The reason why CMPX is on here, by the way,
3055.72s:  it might not look as impressive because it's down 8% over the last five days.
3060.44s:  But over the last year, it's 73% six months is 146%.
3065.16s:  So the company is still doing very, very well.
3068.20s:  CURI is another one.
3071.40s:  HIMS just got smashed. HIMS just got taken out to the wood shed.
3078.92s:  So yeah, HIMS is a different story.
3082.04s:  HIMS just got castrated is what I would frame this as.
3087.24s:  I got to pop the door for Thor.
3090.28s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3106.28s:  And yeah, anyways, there's a ton of names like this.
3109.48s:  And you'll also find like I showed you a little bit earlier
3114.12s:  that there is strength in utilities.
3120.44s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3122.28s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3124.28s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3126.28s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3128.28s:  HIMS just got smashed.
3130.28s:  Here.
3132.28s:  Same thing with staples, by the way.
3138.28s:  Here, actually instead, oh, I forgot it's on this.
3142.28s:  I'm going to run a scan.
3144.28s:  And then we'll just look at utilities directly versus just that.
3148.28s:  Let's do to factor scan.
3152.28s:  And then let's find some sort of utilities.
3154.28s:  Yeah, this thing,
3156.28s:  you don't know why this continues to lock up when this is going.
3162.28s:  Makes mad though.
3164.28s:  All right, so let's see what utility companies are running it right now.
3172.28s:  L-I-N-C funny enough we literally just talked about that one.
3176.28s:  The RKS is doing it.
3180.28s:  CURI.
3182.28s:  So there's a bunch of these names that you can see that are clearly showing.
3188.28s:  So you can find pockets of that pretty much all over.
3192.28s:  All right.
3196.28s:  H says, what's your opinion on automating strategies?
3198.28s:  I have a team that wants to get their feet wet automating.
3202.28s:  But in testing systems for them to automate, it's much harder than I thought.
3208.28s:  That's a tough one.
3210.28s:  I don't really know what you mean by a team.
3212.28s:  Like, do you just mean like other friends or do you mean like what does that mean?
3218.28s:  I think the broader answer though for you,
3222.28s:  send your H is
3226.28s:  the only reason really to automate as a retail trader
3230.28s:  is if you find some monochrome of convenience from it,
3236.28s:  but you're not going to find like edge automating.
3240.28s:  Your edge is going to have to be found somewhere else.
3242.28s:  Now, what I would say is that if I personally had a passion
3248.28s:  for automating things,
3250.28s:  I would go work at a quant fund
3254.28s:  or I would go work at a high frequency trading firm.
3257.28s:  And literally just make money for the firm on a salary.
3261.28s:  You'll definitely do way better than that.
3265.28s:  H says a few well-versed coders.
3267.28s:  Yeah, okay.
3269.28s:  Yeah. Then I think other than you guys being able to conveniently build
3275.28s:  stuff to help simplify stuff,
3277.28s:  like you're not going to be able to automate anything that's going to be even remotely competitive.
3281.28s:  So I think in that kind of scenario,
3283.28s:  if you guys want to do it, it's like a project because it's fun,
3287.28s:  then sure, I get that.
3289.28s:  But if I wanted to do that and actually make money,
3291.28s:  I would go into the prediction markets or I would go into crypto
3295.28s:  and find ways to essentially market make.
3299.28s:  Because that's a way to use your automation for good.
3303.28s:  And obviously by good, good for you.
3305.28s:  I mean, not general good,
3307.28s:  but you can monetize it, right?
3309.28s:  You can make some money from it,
3311.28s:  which is clearly the goal.
3313.28s:  So I think in that sense, that's cool.
3315.28s:  But outside of that,
3317.28s:  it's just going to be for your convenience.
3319.28s:  There's the ability to code is definitely a weapon.
3325.28s:  But it doesn't help with edge.
3329.28s:  Edge is understanding market mechanics and forces.
3333.28s:  And unfortunately,
3335.28s:  you're not going to compete with any of the actual,
3337.28s:  because as soon as you're starting to try to get the right idea,
3339.28s:  because as soon as you're starting to try to compete from the lens of execution speed,
3343.28s:  right?
3345.28s:  And competing in a speed-based realm.
3347.28s:  Now you're fighting people.
3351.28s:  It's beyond David versus Goliath.
3353.28s:  It's like David versus Godzilla.
3357.28s:  These firms,
3359.28s:  they literally bid to be closer to the exchange
3363.28s:  so that their latency is decreased.
3367.28s:  Literally via physical proximity.
3371.28s:  It's a whole other level to this shit.
3377.28s:  Edge says, thanks for the feedback.
3379.28s:  We've considered and built systems for alerts for arming between books on prediction markets,
3385.28s:  but have them messed with market making the hope was to create a system.
3389.28s:  Yeah.
3391.28s:  I think you'll find way, way, way more opportunity in the prediction markets.
3395.28s:  This is exactly what I would do.
3397.28s:  And it's because in the prediction markets,
3399.28s:  there are new enough
3401.28s:  that you can absolutely build your own edge.
3405.28s:  There now is a retail trader.
3407.28s:  And it's because institutions have not bled into it yet.
3411.28s:  So the time is actually ticking, though,
3415.28s:  in order for you to be able to do that.
3417.28s:  The reason why I don't personally do it honestly is because the markets aren't big enough for it to make sense for me.
3421.28s:  I make more money trading regularly.
3423.28s:  If I didn't and I was enterprising, that is 100% what I would be doing right now.
3427.28s:  Is I would either be cross exchange, arbitrage,
3431.28s:  or making sure to pay very close attention to the contract terms.
3435.28s:  You have to pay attention to the contract terms.
3439.28s:  Because I've seen people not look at that closely enough.
3441.28s:  And they think they're running an R, but they're not.
3445.28s:  So that's a fun fact.
3449.28s:  But I think that's exactly where I would go.
3453.28s:  But yeah, the issue is is like you can make a maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars a year if you have a good setup,
3459.28s:  a quick system and good risk management, but it's just not worth it.
3463.28s:  But you'll be way better off there than somewhere like trying to automate anything on an actual exchange.
3469.28s:  You'll get fucking rate. There's just no way.
3475.28s:  Joseph says does Mark to market accounting apply to options trading if you elect it.
3481.28s:  Yeah, it's up to you.
3485.28s:  Lauren says can you look at B B.
3489.28s:  Look yeah.
3493.28s:  Oh, this is funny. I literally looked at this today myself.
3499.28s:  Lauren, talk to me. What's the idea in here?
3501.28s:  What are we trying to do?
3503.28s:  Right now I'm just getting my bearings.
3513.28s:  Reuse.
3519.28s:  When was this?
3523.28s:  23.
3527.28s:  23.
3531.28s:  So it's already broken through this overhead resistant, which is good.
3539.28s:  It has another volume node up here.
3546.28s:  But there's not a lot of overhead resistance for anything that's like near term.
3550.28s:  I know that there is this deep stuff from a long time ago out here.
3556.28s:  But yeah, it looks like this looks like it's generally generally moving.
3564.28s:  I think this like these breakouts are really, really solid form right sideways consolidation for a couple days, narrowing bars, volume expansion, like all those read really, really well.
3575.28s:  So I like that.
3579.28s:  I think now I don't like this move that much.
3583.28s:  I would be in the camp of really wanting to see how it consolidates here and then decide if it's viable for another breakout.
3593.28s:  But I haven't like actually done a thorough analysis on it.
3598.28s:  Give me one sec.
3599.28s:  I want to take a look.
3601.28s:  Where did I do?
3609.28s:  Let's see.
3619.28s:  Market analysis for BB.
3624.28s:  Want to know what the latest is.
3628.28s:  So what I do is in chat GPT.
3630.28s:  I have a project called market research and then within those projects.
3633.28s:  I have different conversations.
3635.28s:  So then what I do is I build essentially templates to templatize as it's doing.
3643.28s:  Different analysis for me.
3651.28s:  Let's read this article.
3665.28s:  So the announced plan six for options for its silence business, aiming to redirect investments towards high growth areas.
3673.28s:  And some of the orders in the movie if there were distractions and easier to tell how that works,
3676.28s:  are doing the implementation that is talking about with a list ofphon Nichole team and those things.
3680.28s:  Okay.
3688.28s:  I would have to say, like pretty well,
3690.12s:  they've been the premiere for a long time.
3696.80s:  So entities that require any sort
3700.76s:  of secure style communications,
3703.76s:  they really do frequent blackberry for that.
3705.96s:  So they have a good sitting for it.
3712.16s:  Exploring options for the silence business
3714.24s:  sending shares of the Canadian company
3715.92s:  more than four percent.
3719.88s:  It was looking to read our expenings,
3721.32s:  so we already talked about that.
3722.76s:  It expects silence, which uses machine learning
3725.36s:  to pre-empt security breaches.
3726.84s:  That's coolest fuck.
3728.56s:  The post and adjusted core loss of 51 million
3731.28s:  during the fiscal year.
3734.52s:  It's primarily transitioned to selling software
3737.00s:  for devices and autonomous vehicles
3739.12s:  and bought silence in 19 from 1.4.
3742.00s:  This is an interesting example though
3743.72s:  of a company that's trying to pivot.
3746.80s:  And like it's doing okay on the pivot.
3755.04s:  Let's take a look at the options chain.
3760.52s:  Yeah, people are super bullish.
3764.88s:  Look at that.
3766.36s:  362,000 calls against 62,000 puts.
3772.60s:  So yeah, I mean, this thing's really, really well positioned.
3776.64s:  Most of the people funny enough
3779.40s:  are playing way near, oh no, they're not.
3782.52s:  They're out in 20 June and 16 Jan.
3784.28s:  Okay, that makes me more sense.
3785.68s:  I thought it was 21 March.
3786.80s:  I was like, yo, that's way earlier than I thought.
3790.32s:  Yeah, most of these were 16 Jan.
3794.16s:  Yeah.
3795.96s:  I like this.
3796.80s:  Honestly, from like a pot odds perspective kind of play.
3800.96s:  I mean, this is also super cheap, right?
3803.44s:  I think the ball out here is a little cheaper 82%.
3807.00s:  So the surface will be a little expensive, but not crazy.
3813.92s:  Yeah, I like it.
3815.28s:  I think it's good.
3816.60s:  I think the name of the game here for it is,
3820.96s:  I wouldn't want to see it really fall below this previous surge up,
3828.96s:  right?
3829.96s:  If it starts falling below this,
3832.12s:  then the trend looks kind of dangerous.
3834.60s:  Like I actually don't like that it's falling below this consolidation.
3838.56s:  That's this line that I drew here.
3840.76s:  It's kind of this little zone that you see between these three candles.
3845.00s:  This consolidation matters because this is after it had its little surge,
3848.84s:  couple of trickle updates, then when sideways,
3852.12s:  normally when we have stuff that's behaving like really well
3858.04s:  from a breakout slash near term momentum style play,
3863.88s:  you'll see them stay within this range versus starting to take to play with it
3869.56s:  and to fall below it.
3871.24s:  So I don't fully love that end of it,
3874.12s:  but I mean, I still think that's okay.
3876.04s:  Yeah, I think it looks good.
3878.60s:  It's pretty solid.
3882.12s:  All right, take a look maybe at one more before I got a balance.
3888.92s:  Let me see.
3892.92s:  Tommy says EXC.
3898.68s:  Yeah, EXC looks great.
3904.20s:  How they do on earnings?
3905.32s:  Man, look at these.
3906.12s:  These are old.
3910.84s:  These are old.
3911.48s:  These are completely irrelevant.
3914.68s:  How do you do on earnings?
3915.96s:  Good earnings beat.
3919.64s:  Solid behavior on a dividend day.
3921.64s:  Yeah, this looks great.
3925.08s:  The other thing that I like about this is that it's behaved really well over the last.
3931.80s:  I mean, essentially from mid-December,
3935.48s:  which is where a lot of other utilities companies were suffering.
3940.92s:  So these guys have been looking really, really good.
3945.32s:  Great call.
3946.68s:  Let's learn about the business.
3962.92s:  So they are like the majority of their industry's market cap.
3970.12s:  They are competing with Duke, which is interesting.
3974.84s:  Let me go to chat you PT.
3979.80s:  Talk analysis for EXC.
3985.88s:  EXC.
4000.28s:  It's like completely locked up.
4007.40s:  No, I wanted to use my format, bro.
4017.00s:  So they expect to invest $3.8 billion over the next four years into infrastructure upgrades.
4024.44s:  The company has identified over 11 gigawatts of potential data-centered
4030.36s:  demand growth within its service areas.
4032.68s:  Fuckin' a.
4034.68s:  That's awesome.
4040.44s:  That's awesome.
4047.24s:  I'm waiting for the rest of
4048.92s:  chatGPTs analysis.
4058.68s:  Here.
4066.20s:  Talk analysis for EXC.
4075.48s:  And then let's go through here.
4079.08s:  I don't like when utilities have too high of a yield.
4082.12s:  And that's primarily because I prefer utilities companies that are successfully expanding and growing.
4106.36s:  So if we take a look.
4117.16s:  Yeah, their net income looks good.
4123.16s:  A little high on liabilities, but that's not abnormal for companies like this.
4128.68s:  Yeah.
4133.72s:  Yeah, I think this one looks really, really solid to be honest.
4144.12s:  And I love that they're pretty deeply involved in the nuclear power space.
4149.80s:  Because that's about to be much, much less deregulated.
4155.72s:  So that'll favor this company pretty heavily.
4159.00s:  Awesome.
4159.88s:  Yeah, great call out.
4161.32s:  I love that name.
4162.04s:  Good find.
4165.56s:  That might be one to add to the ratio called diagonal list.
4169.16s:  Because a couple of the others that I would prefer to trade have been moving too slow.
4175.32s:  Kind of like the SMRs, the CEGs.
4177.40s:  Right?
4178.20s:  So like if we take a look at CEG, right?
4180.92s:  Wrong way.
4181.64s:  SMR, wrong way.
4183.08s:  So the fact that
4185.88s:  these also trade a little bit like tech, not quite like tech, but definitely a little more tech
4192.28s:  than what we see in EXC.
4194.76s:  So yeah, I do get.
4198.28s:  Sweet.
4199.48s:  All right, gang, time for me to wrap up.
4201.80s:  If you need anything, hit me up in the discord.
4204.44s:  Don't forget we have our skills development stream on Wednesday
