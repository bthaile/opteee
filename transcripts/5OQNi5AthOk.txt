0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.20s: So it's a little bit later.
3.90s: That's why I got the lights on,
5.14s: but I'm trying to do my best to stay a little closer
8.26s: to when I'm making the updates to the SmallStacks account.
11.30s: So that is why we are currently hanging out,
15.34s: even though it's a little bit later unusual.
16.90s: So let's jump over the screen and take a look at what we did.
20.66s: Now, if you'll notice, I currently have no covered strangles
25.50s: or cash secured puts out.
27.04s: We were empty on that as of right now.
30.74s: So today, I took down the XLE29 puts,
36.58s: and I paid 58 cents.
38.34s: It was a little bit lower than what I wanted,
41.14s: but realistically, it was pretty close to 20% capture.
48.38s: And the trade was on for a little bit longer
53.38s: than I was anticipating.
55.14s: So the reason why I wanted to take this down
57.74s: is as I was seeing the market kind of moving around today.
60.78s: I set it before I really would prefer not
64.70s: to be an XLE long term.
66.34s: So I kind of took the few bucks I could get out of it
69.98s: and went on my way.
72.82s: Typically, I would have left this on a little bit longer,
76.86s: but like I said, when I saw about 20% capture
81.82s: in a week or so, 10 days-ish, well, eight days,
86.14s: I didn't wanna leave it on for the rest of the duration.
88.38s: So that is why that is down.
92.22s: So right now, nothing on the cash secured put front,
96.70s: hunting, especially with the market coming down
99.10s: a little bit towards the end of the day today.
101.14s: So we'll see if any opportunity comes up.
104.34s: Of note, I did make an adjustment to CROGOR,
108.38s: and then I also established a diagonal and forward.
113.02s: Now, I wanna be clear, when I look at Ford,
117.54s: I'm not too excited about it.
119.10s: This is kinda like the XLE trade.
121.54s: The company itself, I think, is doing fine,
126.58s: but this isn't something that I'm like, yes,
128.94s: this thing's gonna be just the next thing that blows up.
131.58s: I don't really feel that way whatsoever,
133.98s: but it's providing a really good return.
136.18s: So that's why I ventured into Ford.
139.34s: So what I'm looking at here is,
142.50s: I'll pop back over to the screen
144.14s: and we can take a look at Ford.
146.36s: That's this one, yeah.
147.70s: So what we're looking at is on the 30th of September,
151.82s: I jumped in the 21 Jan 22, four calls.
156.22s: I got three of them and I paid $3 and two cents.
159.58s: This is for 88 Delta, which is really good.
162.78s: Nice and liquid on the leaps, which I love to see.
166.54s: And I sent out two of the 30 October seven calls,
173.66s: collect them 36 cents, which was a Delta of 53.
178.10s: And that's bringing in $72 or about an 8% return
182.26s: on invested capital, it's a great return.
183.74s: So that's really what brought me to this trade.
185.78s: When I was looking through the financials for it,
187.58s: I really like the overall return on capital for the trade.
192.50s: It's strong and then I also, if you notice,
196.18s: it's an uncovered diagonal.
198.02s: So if it continues above seven,
200.50s: then we can continue cruising along from there.
205.54s: And the current price is in $3.55.
208.34s: So the current price for Ford is $6.98.
211.22s: So you can see what I'm doing here.
212.86s: I'm specifically structuring this trade,
216.10s: so that there's a very high probability
217.90s: that it's gonna close above my strike.
219.90s: And I'll take the trade down essentially for a profit.
223.06s: And that's the name of the game here.
226.38s: Right now, both the leap and the short call
231.38s: are looking good.
232.74s: The leaps are trading right now for $3.55.
236.54s: So there is a bit of an unrealized gain there.
240.98s: And the short calls are about same,
245.98s: you know, about same, same, not much of a change there.
249.98s: So that is what we're looking at in Ford.
253.26s: Next up is Croger.
255.98s: Not anything crazy in here, pretty simple adjustment.
259.02s: What I ended up doing is adding another short call.
262.94s: Just because it's exactly what I was talking about before.
265.46s: Sometimes I like to add these short calls
267.30s: when I see premium really skyrocket.
269.98s: So that's what I did here.
271.46s: So in this scenario, it started as an uncover diagonal.
276.18s: I had two long calls, one short call.
280.38s: And then when I saw premium start floating above $1.25
284.02s: for that $3.55, six no call,
287.10s: that's when I decided I wanted to add another.
289.42s: So now we're at a one-to-one ratio,
291.26s: which is still a no upside risk in this trade.
295.70s: But I have $185 of credit out,
300.30s: which I'm very happy with.
302.02s: So we'll keep rolling this diagonal around as needed
305.50s: and see what it turns out to be.
307.70s: But so far, the Croger diagonal is essentially doing exactly
311.50s: what I would hope for it to do.
313.50s: Okay, so looking at the entire portfolio right now,
316.22s: quick wrap up.
317.42s: Overall capital in the account is $56.82.
322.34s: And we're utilizing just under $2,300.
326.70s: So we're only using 40% of the account.
329.62s: We have plenty of cash to deploy when we see some opportunity.
333.14s: So like I said, I'm going to continue looking for things
336.54s: that look interesting, hopefully for a cash secure put.
341.02s: But I'm not going to force it if I don't see anything.
343.54s: As always, the biggest pain in the ass here
345.86s: is finding something I can cash secure
348.18s: that fits the size of the account.
350.26s: It's just the name of the game when you're working
352.50s: with such a small account.
354.14s: It's very difficult to trade the products
356.22s: that I like to trade in this account.
359.22s: So that's why we're starting to see me trading more diagonals,
363.94s: just because they're more cost efficient
366.18s: for getting the account moving forward.
369.86s: There's also a chance that I'll start throwing in a couple long calls.
374.58s: I like to do that in things like VXX when I see the market
378.82s: capitulating a little bit.
380.70s: So if I start seeing volatility or getting the sense of volatility
383.62s: is going to start moving up or continue to move up,
386.94s: there's a good chance I'll add some long VXX calls.
390.02s: I typically don't like buying out of the money calls,
392.54s: but again, in this scenario, I will be relegated
395.82s: to some sort of that trade.
397.90s: But ideally, I will find a cash secured put that I like
401.66s: to use up $20 or less.
404.98s: So about $2,000 to cash secured is what we're looking at.
408.82s: Overall, return for the portfolio since starting
412.18s: on one September's 12%.
414.30s: I am so happy with that.
416.74s: I think that that is a great return for an account
421.78s: this size, even for an annual return.
424.66s: So overall, I'm really, really happy with that.
429.10s: The vast majority of return is coming from the diagonal,
432.94s: as I was talking about, just more efficient.
435.38s: And as we're looking forward,
438.34s: I currently have $124 in credit outstanding.
441.70s: So that represents just shy of a 2.2% return on the account.
446.50s: So in general, we're looking good.
449.82s: The account is moving along as expected,
452.38s: actually a little better than expected.
454.22s: We haven't really had to work through anything, honestly, yet.
458.50s: So plenty of room to continue developing the account.
462.82s: If you guys see anything that looks interesting
464.50s: for cash secured put, let me know.
467.30s: I'm on the hunt right now.
468.98s: And when I do find something, obviously,
471.38s: I'll throw it on and then I'll send out another update.
473.98s: So as always, if you have any questions
475.90s: on what I'm doing, why I'm doing, drop me a line,
477.78s: let me know.
478.62s: The whole point of this account is to have a dialogue.
481.06s: I'm straight up not doing this for me.
483.10s: I don't really get anything out of it.
484.98s: It's challenging and it's fun, so there's that.
487.78s: But I would rather investing to just be very boring
490.66s: like it is in my margin account.
492.38s: So let me know what I can do to make this
496.66s: a better experience for you guys,
498.26s: or if there's anything that you have
500.90s: wanna talk through, let me know.
503.10s: Because again, that's the whole point of all this.
505.30s: All right, so I hope everybody enjoys the rest of the week
508.10s: and I will talk to everyone later.
