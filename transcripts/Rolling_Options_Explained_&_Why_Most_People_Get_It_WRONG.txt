0.00s: rolling options in how it actually works
3.24s: I thought we were past this I really
5.52s: thought we were onto bigger and better
7.80s: things and then when I was looking for
9.96s: my next video idea I just threw into
12.42s: YouTube Rolling options and I want to
15.06s: show you something because it's actually
17.22s: scary the amount of misinformation
20.64s: around this concept is staggering and it
24.66s: promotes some of the most unhealthy
27.30s: options trading habits that exist so I
30.90s: want to walk you through exactly what
32.94s: I'm seeing why it's blatantly wrong and
36.66s: then I'm going to walk you through in
38.64s: depth what rolling options actually is
42.06s: so at the end of the video there's a
44.10s: little quiz that I want to see if you're
45.72s: following along and staying up to speed
47.76s: so what's up everybody Eric here welcome
49.74s: back to all the outliers shout out to
51.78s: the patreon family you guys make content
53.70s: like this possible and let's talk about
56.52s: rolling some options hopefully for the
59.46s: last time I doubt it though for being
61.26s: honest okay so as I said I threw rolling
64.50s: options into Google I'm not trying to
66.36s: pick on nobody I literally put in the
68.64s: words rolling options and these are the
70.98s: first two videos that popped up for me
72.90s: the first one says option rolling
75.72s: strategy is free money how to roll
79.08s: options for beginners free money that's
81.90s:  news to me that sounds pretty
83.52s: sick but I could turn down
86.04s: I'll have to check that video out and
88.02s: then the second video here is avoid
90.42s: losses by Rolling options that also
93.54s: sounds pretty sick to me too
95.04s: both of these seem great from a new
97.86s: Trader perspective who doesn't want free
100.32s: money and who doesn't want to avoid
102.48s: losses which if you remember loss
105.60s: aversion is a massive psychological
108.78s: function of all human beings but Traders
111.84s: really face this on a regular basis this
114.36s: is biological in nature but anyways
116.58s: without running too far down that rabbit
118.86s: hole what's going on here what are we
120.60s: seeing well let's check out a couple
122.64s: things on Reddit the first one here says
125.34s: rolling in Iron Condor I'm gonna skip a
128.22s: couple lines and then it says I consider
130.26s: the amount currently showing as a loss
133.50s: in quotations then when we look down
136.50s: here it says I would look for the credit
139.08s: at sell to open to be higher than the
141.90s: loss plus debit to close I hope you're
144.42s: picking up what I'm putting down here so
145.80s: far far but if not let's take a look at
147.90s: another one here infinitely rolling of
151.02s: short options I open a Tesla short put
153.48s: it's underwater this person says I know
156.00s: this comes up often but people always
157.44s: seem to talk about in the point of view
159.00s: of a full-time Trader essentially saying
162.12s: that there's an opportunity cost which
163.62s: is accurate and then it says majority of
165.42s: the people don't have the time skill or
167.70s: patience to do the DD at least I sure do
170.34s: not uh that's hilarious but then it says
172.74s: for someone that is just looking for a
174.36s: decent trade once in a while and at
176.34s: least happy with the profit which is the
178.32s: wrong mindset mind you again loss
180.90s: aversion that is what you're seeing
182.78s: laced through all of this avoid losses
187.08s: this person can't even say the
189.00s: word loss without quotes around it
191.10s: because that's that's subconscious pain
193.08s: literally that's going through there
194.52s: they cannot reconcile some of the actual
197.52s: details of rolling options which is just
199.68s: wild to me and then this person is
201.60s: talking about looking for decent trades
203.70s: once in a while and happy with the
205.38s: profit loss aversion it again what stops
208.92s: them from Rolling infinitely further for
210.96s: a credit until you can get out with the
212.70s: net gain or at worst a small loss and my
215.64s: favorite part is in when it says
216.78s: infinite rolling it says further out of
218.70s: the money for more time or both well at
221.76s: the end of this video You're Gonna Know
223.26s: The Definitive answers to all of these
225.72s: in how they are blatantly wrong and I'm
228.42s: not even going to tell you how they're
229.32s: blatantly wrong just yet we're gonna
230.82s: answer it for yourself at the end but
232.80s: with all of that let's move on now to
236.04s: our next topic I want to talk about the
238.32s: anatomy of a role what is a rolled
240.72s: option because what you just saw up
243.00s: there was a lot of about what
245.88s: rolling options really isn't so I'm
248.04s: going to tell you exactly what it is and
249.42s: it's going to be super short and sweet
250.74s: and it's probably going to make a lot of
252.00s: you upset because it's nothing sexy down
254.28s: here in the bottom left we have trade
255.66s: one entry trade two exit trade three
257.94s: entry where did the roll happen here
260.58s: right there that's it that's it that's
262.80s: all a roll is it is a closing trade that
266.88s: is mentally tied to an opening trade the
270.18s: reason why I say mentally is because
271.92s: your broker does not track roles your
275.28s: broker doesn't give a about a
277.56s: rolled position so when we're talking
279.12s: about rolling options it literally is
281.76s: just a convenience based concept meaning
284.76s: what's actually how happening is we are
287.22s: closing a trade we are closing trade one
289.80s: which was the entry trade two is the
292.08s: exit for trade one we are out of this
294.72s: position this position is closed and we
296.88s: are opening up a brand new one
299.28s: Standalone trade and what we're doing is
302.22s: linking the accounting to this trade
305.28s: loss aversion again that's the whole
306.90s: purpose of this it's convenience based
308.88s: but really the short answer here is what
310.74s: is a role it's just when we close the
312.48s: trade and we open up a new one very
314.58s: frequently it's gonna be either the same
317.64s: strike option the same type of option
320.58s: like those kinds of details typically
322.32s: are what carries over so if you sell a
324.90s: put and then you buy that put back and
326.64s: then you sell another put in the same
328.26s: product maybe it's a different
329.40s: expiration maybe it's a different strike
331.20s: but that's what we're considering a role
333.90s: in general so let's get into the details
336.00s: now I know this is the part that nobody
337.68s: really likes it kind of sucks because we
339.24s: have to put on our thinking cap but this
341.16s: is actually why the details matter so
343.44s: let's take a look we have an example
344.76s: trade one we saw to open a 10 put at a
347.70s: dollar keeping it simple I'm an idiot
349.68s: it's easier for me to do math with even
351.36s: numbers these numbers really aren't
353.46s: super likely but anyways so trade one we
356.46s: sold to open a template collecting a
358.32s: dollar trade two we bought to close that
361.08s: put at two dollars so for those at home
363.54s: what's happened so far what have we done
365.58s: well on this trade one we collected a
368.46s: credit on trade two we closed our
371.40s: position for a 200 debit let's math for
374.52s: Marines here let's get through this
376.08s: together so this is 100 coming in this
379.08s: is one two hundred dollars going out the
381.48s: door so what's just happened is we
383.52s: realized a 100 loss we lost one hundred
387.54s: dollars I can't put it any more plainly
389.28s: than that a lot of people struggle with
390.78s: that but anyways let's take a look at
392.70s: what you're seeing here avoid losses by
395.28s: Rolling options okay well by my again
397.86s: rudimentary math that's not at all
399.90s: what's occurred here same thing over
401.46s: here with the loss in quotations these
404.82s: don't look like they're in quote
405.78s: Haitians to me it looks like that's a
407.94s: realized loss on the books now what
410.40s: we're going to talk about is what these
412.08s: people actually mean what they actually
414.66s: are attempting to convey albeit poorly
417.54s: so this is exactly what's occurred so
421.44s: far we simply have lost 100 okay fine
424.80s: that point is now beaten to a dead pulp
427.08s: now the role if you remember the role
429.72s: occurs between two trade two trade three
431.52s: here's trade two here's trade three
433.44s: here's our roll so now we sold to open
436.92s: whatever it doesn't matter we'll just
438.36s: call it the same the 10 put you can roll
440.46s: out you can roll out and up out and down
443.34s: meaning when we say out it means adding
445.98s: days to expiration going out in time up
448.50s: or down just means that's where you're
449.70s: moving your strike compared to where you
451.32s: are at so very frequently if you sold a
454.26s: put that's bullish we want it to go up
456.00s: and if it's challenged technically
458.82s: that's when we are going to be rolling
460.92s: these kinds of options we get into a
462.84s: whole game of words because
464.16s: realistically you can roll up profitable
466.50s: trade too but in kind of common parlance
469.62s: when we're using the terms it's
471.30s: generally associated with the losing
473.10s: trade that we're rolling but you can
475.26s: roll a winning trade again it doesn't
477.54s: matter if this trade here comes down at
479.94s: a profit or a loss literally the role is
482.46s: just this transaction that's it so
484.62s: anyways trade three we sold to open now
486.84s: we collected three dollars so what's
490.26s: happened now well we took in three
492.18s: hundred dollars before this 300 we had a
495.12s: 100 loss on the books so now we have the
498.44s: opportunity to make 200 the opportunity
502.56s: notice how I phrase it that way very
504.66s: purposefully because this is an
506.66s: unrealized position it's an open trade
509.94s: this is an unrealized game so we have
512.70s: collected enough money to result in what
515.88s: we would call a net credit and this is
518.28s: exactly what rolling tends to look like
520.74s: if we're executing it kind of to try to
523.26s: enhance our positions now I want to take
525.12s: a quick moment and let you all know that
526.98s: I like rolling rolling is a fantastic
529.38s: approach to trading options but it is so
532.62s: important to actually understand what it
534.48s: is and acknowledge the transactions as
536.52s: they're occurring so I want to help us
538.56s: understand that point just a little bit
541.02s: more so over here I have a question for
543.78s: you where is the break even premium so
545.64s: if we sold this option for three dollars
547.86s: what does this need to be trading at in
551.22s: order for us to be flat on this series
553.80s: of transactions if you know the answer
555.96s: throw it in the comments below and if
558.60s: you don't that's cool I'm going to show
560.22s: you the answer it's two dollars because
562.32s: what's happened here is we sold to open
564.60s: this option again for three dollars we
567.42s: want to make 100 to get back to break
570.66s: even so if this decreases from three to
572.82s: two you now have a 100 unrealized gain
575.82s: that brings you to break even on the
578.04s: position so on this series of Trades if
581.28s: in trade three this option now is
584.16s: trading at two dollars you are at break
586.98s: even as soon as it falls below two
589.32s: dollars you are now in profit and your
592.38s: maximum profit potential again in this
594.90s: rolled trade is up to 200 so that's
597.66s: exactly where the money's going now
599.34s: let's do some accounting because this is
601.80s: the part that a lot of people up we
603.90s: need to understand the difference
605.10s: between net liquidating value and cash
607.98s: and sweep if you are unsure what those
609.90s: terms mean simply put net liquidating
612.30s: value is if you flattened your entire
614.88s: account your entire portfolio right now
617.04s: that's how much it's worth passion sweep
618.90s: is how much cash you have sitting in
621.48s: your account the part that trips people
623.94s: up is your cash and sweep can be greater
627.60s: than your net lick sounds confusing
629.64s: we're gonna get to the bottom of it
631.02s: right now so let's say you have a one
632.64s: thousand dollar account we have trade
634.92s: one here that we sold to open that put
637.38s: for a dollar so our net lick is still
640.56s: one thousand dollars nothing has changed
642.72s: this net lick will change as the value
646.50s: of this open trade changes but at the
649.44s: onset nothing's changed however we've
651.48s: collected 100 your cash and sweep is now
655.14s: eleven hundred dollars trade two our net
658.56s: lick is now nine hundred dollars we
662.10s: realized a 100 loss it's gone your cash
666.12s: and sweep is now also nine hundred
669.00s: dollars you just lost a hundred dollars
671.04s: why is this not a thousand dollars in
673.38s: your cash and sweep because you closed
675.66s: it for two hundred dollars so you give
678.60s: back your dollar and then you give
681.06s: another dollar because it's two dollars
683.70s: so this is exactly how the money is
686.94s: moving in your account so now for trade
689.82s: three your net lick is still nine
693.00s: hundred dollars this is an uh this is a
695.46s: realized loss this is now an open trade
698.28s: so as this trade moves around your net
701.52s: Lake will move around your cash and
703.38s: sweep is gonna remain steady at 12 200
706.50s: dollars why twelve hundred dollars
708.30s: because you collected 300 bucks this is
711.60s: how the money is moving in your account
713.10s: so if you're not totally understanding
715.80s: what's going on here your cash and sweep
717.90s: is just holding money that can be all
720.06s: over the place your net lick is going to
722.16s: be tied to the value of your open
724.38s: positions as they move around so as you
727.50s: book this loss we booked a loss notice
730.68s: how after you rolled your option your
733.38s: cash and sweep is up it's up to twelve
735.60s: hundred dollars but your net lick is
737.28s: down at nine hundred dollars this is
740.34s: exactly why you will be unable to roll
744.42s: an option into perpetuity okay twist
747.24s: time does rolling avoid losses yes or no
752.82s: it doesn't what Traders like this are
755.88s: attempting to capitalize on is the
758.58s: profit potential down the line but
761.28s: they're Crossing two very important
763.80s: streams of money unrealized gains and
766.86s: realized gains so as you follow through
769.62s: that math that we just did together in
772.14s: no way shape or form does rolling avoid
775.62s: losses it realizes the value of the
778.74s: trade that's exactly what's going on
780.42s: here next can you roll forever
783.78s: no you can roll for a really long time
786.72s: you cannot roll forever again I
789.12s: encourage you go back to that section
790.38s: that we went through the math because
791.88s: what's happening is each time you roll
793.74s: for a loss your net liquidating value is
797.04s: slowly getting trimmed down because the
800.22s: value of the positions have gone down as
802.32s: you're flattening them so sooner or
803.94s: later you might have a giant cash and
806.04s: sweep vehicle a ton of money in there
807.54s: but it's all tied to an open trade that
810.84s: may or may not actually be in profit and
812.70s: sooner or later you can become insolvent
814.62s: your broker can say hey you're not
816.54s: meeting your margin requirements you
818.16s: can't put that trade on now you have to
819.54s: book the whole thing at a loss what is
821.52s: expiration liquidity this is an
823.20s: important concept because a lot of
825.24s: Traders you have to be careful how far
827.40s: out in time you roll essentially
829.08s: expiration liquidity is the idea that
831.72s: The Closer you are to expiration the
833.94s: more options there are available because
835.50s: there's a lot of liquidity in those
837.06s: options that's where most people are
838.26s: trading so what that means is if you're
839.70s: trading SPX and you go out zero days one
842.34s: day two day three day four four day five
844.68s: day seven day ten days sooner or later
846.78s: as you get further out in time it's
848.40s: going to go from 45 days to 60 days to
851.64s: 70 days so instead of being in one day
854.22s: increments the further out in time you
856.38s: go the greater the days to expiration
858.78s: becomes between the subsequent
860.40s: expiration Cycles this becomes a problem
862.38s: because the idea of rolling for a credit
864.48s: as you fall super far in the money means
867.48s: you have to go super far out in time and
869.82s: then all of a sudden you might have to
871.02s: roll out 180 days in order to get a
874.44s: credit even at the same strike so it's
876.42s: important to understand that expiration
878.52s: liquidity becomes an important concept
880.50s: when you're rolling options the last one
882.54s: this is kind of a trick question I'll
884.04s: give it to you up front but we can
885.90s: always roll up or down yes or no and you
889.50s: always roll up or down yes or no yes you
892.92s: can there are no rules so if we go back
895.44s: to the example trade that I gave you you
898.08s: can absolutely choose to roll this 10
901.50s: put up or down you can always roll up or
904.32s: down it doesn't always make sense the
906.30s: goal is to try and roll for a credit or
909.18s: break even if you have to but you can
911.46s: always roll any direction you want it
913.92s: just might be for a debit and you might
915.48s: be locking in a loss if you're not
917.76s: capturing the math appropriately so I
920.28s: hope you pass that exam I have a couple
922.26s: other videos that go through rolling
924.18s: options in depth if you need a refresh
926.76s: but hopefully this is the last time I
928.50s: got to go through one of these because
929.76s: there are a lot of nuances and strategy
932.04s: but this is how the math works and
933.66s: that's the important part because most
935.40s: people get this wrong because of loss
936.96s: aversion and because they're preying on
939.18s: a psychological function where people
940.68s: don't like having losing trades and the
942.18s: idea of free money who doesn't don't
943.80s: forget like subscribe be an outlier I'll
945.54s: see you guys later
