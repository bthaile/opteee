0.00s: All right. So we got the recording going. I know it actually says your name down there in the bottom left is info at the trading book.
9.00s: Yeah, I know you have a hyphenate a name, Anne Marie, do you go by one or the other people by?
15.00s: Yeah, I go by Anne Marie. Yeah, and my last name is Latvian. And so everybody has a really tough time with it.
23.00s: I can't even ask about it. Yeah, it's banned like rubber band or marching band or whatever the eye and the why are silent.
32.00s: What's the origin of that? Latvian. Oh, wow. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. You don't run into a lot of folks, especially.
41.00s: Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah.
44.00s: And then I didn't expect to go down this rabbit hole, but I got to ask.
49.00s: Did you were your folks from there or grandparents from there? I'm curious how you ended up.
54.00s: We had really that name is.
59.00s: I was there for generations back and then so we've just had a lot of males in the family that got the name came down, but we're really Eastern European and Mediterranean.
73.00s: Right. And so we are a little bit of I wouldn't be surprised if there was some Turkish floating around in there, but we haven't done, you know, 23 and me or
84.00s: or I just had to ask that's really you don't run into a lot of many Latvians. Yeah.
92.00s: No, no, absolutely not. I am primarily German and Polish word, I'm a dozen. You know, you can't find.
100.00s: Well, it depends where you are. Yeah, I guess that's true. I think you throw a rock. You're going to hit one, but anytime I find people from different areas.
110.00s: I like to learn a little bit about it. So thanks for thanks for sharing.
114.00s: And then otherwise, thank you for coming on and chatting with us for a little bit and welcome to the channel.
120.00s: So you and I were doing a little bit of, you know, just level setting before we started the recording, just talking about kind of the purpose of things and whatnot and just to recap the ideas just to have conversation to explore, mostly you and kind of your approach to the markets and trading.
136.00s: So this way, whoever is watching the videos, the ability to just see some different perspectives and I think that that's really powerful as folks are trying to figure out or even redefine, you know, their approach to trading.
149.00s: So if you don't mind, I would love to start there and just get a, you know, broad understanding of, you know, pretty much when you started trading, what got you into it?
160.00s: So we're a family of business owners and so we've no really maybe we've had two people work for other people, but most of us have been just business owners for a lot of generations and I'd had a couple of companies.
176.00s: I started as a neuroscience researcher, but that doesn't pay very much because you're, you know, low man on the totem pole and all I had was my background work in statistics.
186.00s: And so I actually took a hard left turn and went into recruiting and recruiting technical people like myself statisticians neuroscientists and then that moved into programmers and that's it space.
201.00s: And so I had a recruiting company for 14 years and I really was very tired of always being on and in front of people all the time and in a space of convincing someone to, you know, consider your options and then somebody flaking out or, you know, somebody popping positive with a cocaine screen.
230.00s: Wait, did you know that so you know all those sorts of things that happen out of the blue. I was just very tired. It's an exhausting place to work, but I learned a lot about people a lot.
246.00s: And so that combined with my statistics and my background in behavior mathematics.
256.00s: I just said, you know what I want to do something different. My husband said, hey, why don't you look at this. Let's go check this out. And so we saw trading seminar. I can't even remember where it was been so long ago.
271.00s: I was in 2005. And I thought to myself, how hard could this be because of course everything was in hindsight. They were drawing the little pictures and they said, no, this is where you would buy and this is where you would sell and I thought, man, even a monkey could do this. I'm perfect.
291.00s: I said to myself, I will take all the money that I've been saving and working with having a business for 14 years. And I'm going to just absolutely go straight into the market and I can do this. I can do anything. Right. A lot of confidence in myself lost millions of dollars because I figured out that
320.00s: it's not as easy. And that's why they have the pyramid of people on the top and people on the bottom. It's really bad on the bottom. Really skinny on the top. And so I really spent a couple of years failing abysmally.
339.00s: And then I stepped back and I tried to figure out what what do you know to be true. What is anecdotal and what is statistically significant. And what I found out through the years is most of the stuff that we think about in terms of giving us direction.
362.00s: It's anecdotal. It's and by that, I mean, it's the closest thing that you can pick up and go, oh, you know what, the last two times I saw that this happened. And so obviously that's the relationship.
375.00s: One of the best books that I ever read was the book thinking fast and slow by Daniel.
381.00s: I love that book.
383.00s: Yeah.
384.00s: And I think it's really fantastic. My fiancee. She actually turned me on to it. And she was reading it and I checked out it is a good book.
393.00s: It is so, so good. But it made me see that those two systems, the fast thinking system and the slow thinking system.
432.00s: And so I think that's the end of everything as we want to get to a solution.
438.00s: Our mind, another really great neuroscientist is a guy named David Eagleman. And he's a professor out of the University of Texas at Houston.
450.00s: He's a professor of neuroscience work and he says, listen, the brain does not like anything that's not solid.
460.00s: So you can look at a landscape and your brain will actually only see your mind will only connect two or three things and your brain fills in the rest with whatever it is.
474.00s: And so we have this tendency to believe that we're seeing a full picture in the moment in time.
484.00s: So when after the fact we go there and we go, why didn't I see that it could be that your brain never saw it in the first place.
491.00s: It just glossed over that edge.
494.00s: It's sort of like that.
497.00s: Have you have you read that quick little book called the invisible gorilla?
501.00s: Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw the video on it, but the book was really about how much the brain can miss when it's not a paying attention to a specific thing and how I witnessed testimonies like the worst testimony ever.
522.00s: So that notion of all of that started making me think, wait a second, I'm looking at a landscape in real time, making decisions in that real time space.
537.00s: And then after the fact, because everything is static and not dynamic, it's no longer moving, my brain says, oh, obviously this must have been there then and I should have seen this and this is what I need to do.
552.00s: And so they're really two completely disconnected systems.
557.00s: And when you're an active day trader like me, I was just losing gobs of money before my husband said to me, I think you should stop because I'm not really sure you know what you're doing, which you know, my best and greatest confidant is my my husband.
579.00s: So when he said that to me, it was vastly offended, but it was absolutely true, absolutely true.
588.00s: And it sent me on that journey of pulling in all the things I'd learned about how people were from 14 years in the recruiting business and then pulling all the mathematics of hey, how do you actually solve a problem?
606.00s: You go one, two, three, four, and where the area is gray, what you do is have a series of if then statements, right.
616.00s: So that's how I started looking at the market and one of the most fabulous things I ever read was the biography of John Boyd, who was the current Oodle loop, yep.
633.00s: Yes. And the Oodle loop is a part of my every day motion.
639.00s: You got to be a marine then because that's like one of our central principles is the loop.
645.00s: You know, Marines were the only people that showed up to his funeral.
649.00s: Nobody from the Air Force did. So I just love the guy because he just, I mean the focal strength to do to make something so incredibly complex just come down into these tight things that go one, two, three, four, and then stop and make sure you go through.
673.00s: Hey, you've observed, but did you actually orient and that's what we don't do.
678.00s: We observe all the time, but it's that orientation that gives us trouble. Oh, we just crossed over the 50. Yeah, well, that's great. Is that 50 trending up or down is the overall motion of the market coming off of the deep support or hard resistance.
694.00s: There are things that will shift what the cross of that 50 will mean. And so for me, it always comes back to listen, can you see what the players are doing.
710.00s: If you can't tell what the players are doing, you better sit on your hands because the number one thing for me is I'll think to myself, all right, here's what you're thinking you're thinking that when it gets to hear a bunch of sellers are going to come in.
725.00s: And if they come in, then it's going to drive it down to this level of support and you'll be able to turn around and move back up with the direction of the overall trend.
736.00s: And so I used to plan everything out and then take the trade and then go what happened because I was never thinking about my opponent.
748.00s: What was the other side of the equation doing to circumvent my path to where it was that I was going. And so for me, I've stopped looking at the market in terms of indicators, but more of OK, a lot of traders accomplished X today, like for instance, in the futures, we had a support edge that really came down and tested.
777.00s: Hard, well, all the sellers are done because they've said, hey, that was our major target. We went in and this was our objective, 123, 4, we're going to hit these and we get to hear and it's going to be mission accomplished.
795.00s: We're out of there, right. And so when that happens, the balance will shift between the buyers gaining more force because the sellers have accomplished their goal. They're headed back up the hill to find the next resistance spot that they can do it again.
812.00s: And so for me, it's always about the game of the storyboard of players as opposed to look at this crossing this look at that crossing that that storyboard helps me synthesize.
829.00s: Much more accurately than simply looking at a group of technicals or just looking at price.
839.00s: Yeah, and that's definitely interesting. And you started dovetailing kind of into another topic I want to hit before I do that.
848.00s: You you talked about your start and it's fascinating, I think, because you started with a different paradigm than most folks specifically on my channel, which is you started with capital that you had built from over a decade of running your own business.
868.00s: You know, most folks that I end up talking to their started with nothing, you know, I'm just going to save.
873.00s: So if it's okay with you, I'd love to explore that paradigm just a little bit because I think it's really unique.
880.00s: So one of the things I'd be really curious to understand is, you know, you went to that trading seminar, you decided that you wanted to give it a shot.
889.00s: When you first started trading, what was your general approach, if you could just summarize it, I don't need specifics or anything.
900.00s: Wow, you know, I would, I was sort of like a cocker Spaniel looking at a bunch of birds outside the window.
914.00s: And so it was, I'll try that I'll try this I'll try that.
919.00s: And so although I thought I had a strategy, I really didn't right.
926.00s: I did not approach the market in a systematic way. I thought about the market.
934.00s: And I really only realized it in hindsight, but I thought about the market as a little bit of a slot machine.
941.00s: Sure.
942.00s: I thought, hey, this guy's talking about this.
947.00s: And I love the option space.
950.00s: I think options will turn a flat surface into a fully three dimensional topology.
963.00s: We can see all the landscape and just everything. And you can move and manipulate gears.
970.00s: Absolutely loved it.
971.00s: And so I began playing with options, not realizing how much damage you can do to yourself.
982.00s: See, because I had a lot of cash.
986.00s: So when you have a lot of cash, you lose some of it and you, well, that stinks, but it's okay.
994.00s: I got it.
995.00s: Right.
996.00s: And then it happens again and you know, that's terrible, but I got it.
1000.00s: And you almost, you forget how long it took to put it away.
1011.00s: And then it was a lot of money.
1021.00s: And then it was a lot of money.
1024.00s: Which was a travesty, right?
1026.00s: Because it took me 18 months to lose millions of dollars and, you know, six years.
1034.00s: I was, you know, a lot of money.
1044.00s: I was losing millions of dollars.
1049.00s: I was losing millions of dollars because, uh, loose with my risk as say the person who comes in with a thousand dollars and says, hey, you know, I want to, I want to turn this into two thousand bucks by the end of the month, I'm like, well, good luck with that one.
1055.00s: But people forget that risk and reward is on a thread.
1059.00s: And it was high.
1061.00s: Yes.
1062.00s: And so when you look at those things and you're okay,
1066.00s: well, I want my reward to be this,
1068.00s: well, your risk is not only going to expand by that same amount,
1072.00s: but by even more.
1073.00s: And so, you know, the thing that,
1077.00s: so what I did poorly was,
1080.00s: I overestimated my ability.
1084.00s: I overestimated the knowledge that I thought I had.
1091.00s: I overestimated the fact that I thought my intellect could take me through the emotional space.
1100.00s: Listen, there's nothing, there's not a worst gut punch than really studying and putting a position in and it going absolutely sideways.
1113.00s: Right.
1114.00s: And so that sort of, you know, all of that,
1119.00s: if I could build a list of, please don't do this.
1123.00s: It would be the first 18 months of my career and every single thing I did.
1128.00s: The only thing I've never done is going all in on margin or I probably wouldn't be here today.
1135.00s: Right.
1136.00s: I stopped with enough capital that I didn't blow anything up.
1142.00s: And so I could go, all right, start, start over and I would start and go,
1147.00s: okay, what is it that you know to be true?
1151.00s: What simple things can you look at and go,
1154.00s: okay, when this happens and the probability of this happening is higher based on X.
1161.00s: So everything I went right back to my statistical background and said,
1166.00s: let's just look at this as a game of cards,
1171.00s: a game of probabilities, a game of dice rolling and just take a look at these correlations,
1178.00s: not causations, but correlations and work from that.
1184.00s: And so that really has been my bread and butter.
1187.00s: It's what's allowed me to stay in and stay green and continually trend up.
1196.00s: The biggest thing that's happening right now in the markets though is there's so much intraday volatility that even if you know where the cycles are going to run,
1207.00s: if you don't get in at just the right spot,
1211.00s: you're going to sit on a heavy bit of risk.
1215.00s: And so making my cycles just a little bit smaller these days because I think the market is different than I've ever seen it.
1229.00s: It's funny. So as you were kind of sharing some of that, there is a,
1234.00s: I start to get a kick out of these segments because for folks that have done this a long time,
1240.00s: you start to hear a lot of the same things and it's fun because you and I have never talked before.
1246.00s: And a lot of the stuff that you were just talking about is stuff that I talk about and pretty much everybody that's come on the channel so far has talked about risk and reward.
1255.00s: There are relationships, things like that.
1257.00s: And one of the things that I also found interesting is, you know, when you were sharing a little bit about your original approach,
1263.00s: where it was just kind of like shotgun blast, you know, all over the place, different things.
1268.00s: I find that very interesting because I think for just about all of us, because I started with like no money.
1277.00s: And for a lot of us that first starting out, it's like we were doing the same exact thing just with less money.
1283.00s: Yeah.
1284.00s: And you kind of hit on that as well with the one to $2,000 example.
1288.00s: Yeah.
1289.00s: So I think that it's interesting to hear you say that now, the one thing I would be really interested to learn about is,
1297.00s: obviously you had your trade logs or, you know, your record forever.
1303.00s: And then at some point, your husband is the one that said, well, maybe we should shift gears a little bit and try something different.
1310.00s: I'm curious, like, what was the aha moment for you where you started to like regain your confidence after you realize that, okay, what I'm doing right now is not working.
1319.00s: So let me try something new.
1321.00s: When, when did that like click for you?
1325.00s: It's like, it's clicking.
1328.00s: It's, it's that tumbler that keeps going and going because there's a click and then you go, oh, wait, I think I got it.
1335.00s: Yeah.
1336.00s: Okay, no, I don't really have.
1338.00s: And then I, what this is it?
1341.00s: Okay, no, not exactly.
1344.00s: So it's, it's sort of a plateau event.
1348.00s: I'll tell you what made me and my husband say, hold the phone.
1354.00s: You've got to pump the brakes here.
1358.00s: I was trading earnings into, they make the DaVinci machine.
1367.00s: What is their name?
1370.00s: Crud.
1371.00s: Anyways, starts with an eye.
1374.00s: Anyway, so I'm trading this.
1377.00s: Yes, that's it.
1379.00s: Okay, so this is really the worst trade of my trading career.
1385.00s: It's, I went into earnings, everybody was like, oh, it's great.
1388.00s: I mean, I even called the investor.
1391.00s: The investor relations line there.
1395.00s: I'm like, okay, this can be great.
1398.00s: I'm ready for it.
1399.00s: I am so heavy.
1408.00s: I'm going to be able to make a short puts and long calls in a synthetic long.
1416.00s: And they opened up $100 a share lower.
1423.00s: And so literally it's that deer in the headlights.
1429.00s: And then I couldn't move and the whole day and then it was the end of the week.
1434.00s: I was talking to my husband and he was like, yeah, this is not going well.
1440.00s: And so that made me go, okay, you got to stop.
1444.00s: And so the aha moments were really aha.
1449.00s: Face the fact, look at yourself in the mirror and go, you think you know what's going on,
1455.00s: but you don't really know what's going on or you'd have different results.
1458.00s: I think every single one of us has gone through that.
1461.00s: And so I'm going to be able to identify with you there because I, yes.
1467.00s: Absolutely.
1468.00s: And so that was the first thing.
1470.00s: And then I said, all right, you've got to trim this down.
1473.00s: And one, you've got to figure out what I had broken all my emotional capital.
1480.00s: I had no emotional capital left.
1482.00s: Meaning I was so broken spirited.
1487.00s: I actually had to turn my sound off on my machine because if I heard the ding,
1494.00s: it was like Pavlov's dog.
1496.00s: This is going to be bad.
1498.00s: Right. So I literally turned it off.
1500.00s: Even today, so many years later, I still do not have sound on my machine for telling me a trade.
1510.00s: I will have a flashing pop up.
1513.00s: Uh huh.
1514.00s: I'm going to be able to see you there.
1516.00s: Yeah.
1517.00s: Yeah.
1518.00s: Yeah.
1519.00s: Yeah.
1520.00s: Yeah.
1521.00s: Yeah.
1522.00s: Yeah.
1523.00s: I just find that interesting.
1524.00s: Yeah.
1525.00s: Very, very, very far back.
1526.00s: Yeah.
1527.00s: I don't want to hear it again.
1528.00s: So.
1529.00s: That.
1530.00s: And then I said to myself.
1532.00s: All right.
1533.00s: Just because.
1535.00s: You haven't done this right.
1536.00s: Doesn't mean that you can't find out the right way to do it.
1539.00s: Because.
1540.00s: I mean, it's not.
1541.00s: I mean, it's not going to be a good way to go and honestly.
1550.00s: To have grit and perseverance and be, oh, I love the dog go.
1555.00s: Love the dog.
1556.00s: I would.
1557.00s: He's just sitting there chewing my hand.
1559.00s: So, you know, they're so great.
1561.00s: So great.
1563.00s: So if you don't have that grit.
1566.00s: And the market beats you up because it will beat you up.
1568.00s: And then you will be able to get back to the point where you are.
1572.00s: You will be able to get back to the point where you are.
1574.00s: And then you will be able to get back to the point where you are.
1578.00s: Being.
1579.00s: A great golfer.
1581.00s: You're.
1582.00s: Still going to shank it.
1584.00s: Right.
1585.00s: You're still going to kick it in the sand.
1587.00s: It's how you triage yourself out of that that makes you the expert.
1591.00s: How do you take that.
1594.00s: So it's about высώ
1620.36s: You're not good enough, you're not, you're not.
1623.80s: And so you've got to look at yourself in the mirror
1627.04s: and here's the great thing.
1628.92s: If you've literally ever done this.
1631.32s: Look in the mirror and try to tell yourself a lie.
1637.56s: You can't, you can lie,
1640.40s: but the solar plexus will go, and you'll know,
1645.76s: okay, in this whole body, this is a lie.
1649.12s: I know this is a lie.
1650.16s: So if you, if you can look at yourself in the mirror
1654.48s: and say exactly what you are without using language
1659.52s: that is deriding or demeaning and say, okay,
1665.84s: what you know is that you can put the work in.
1669.52s: If you've got a good work ethic and you work and work
1674.24s: and work, but work smart, you're going to get to where you want to go.
1678.60s: You just have to look at yourself in the mirror and say, today,
1681.96s: I'm going to work smart.
1683.88s: And believe it and do it.
1686.08s: And I think that you hit a really important point
1689.56s: that I also think it's really just, it's irreplaceable
1696.04s: in people's progression as a trader
1698.28s: where we go through that phase where you feel like you know what you're doing
1702.20s: and then you start to come across signs that, that, you know,
1704.88s: you might not have the same handle that you think you do.
1708.20s: And I love, you know, your discussion just kind of about that self analysis.
1713.00s: Yes.
1713.48s: Because it's one of the, one of my favorite things to do is just kind of read
1717.72s: through different white papers and research on the trading community at large.
1723.32s: I find it very interesting.
1725.00s: And one of the, I would really like to, oh yeah, I literally can send you a ton.
1730.60s: Actually, Google has a super, super cool feature
1734.84s: where you can literally search white papers, collegiate articles, stuff like that
1738.68s: on a topic that you want.
1741.16s: So it's literally an entire repository of different research
1744.36s: that different folks have done on different aspects of trading.
1746.84s: And one of the most common pieces, it's exactly something I'm sure you know exists
1751.96s: where, you know, we want to really focus on the positive events
1756.28s: and we kind of want to pretend the negative event didn't happen.
1759.88s: And then that leads to kind of that sustained space of losing.
1764.76s: Right.
1765.80s: And I just, I really identify with that self analysis portion.
1769.40s: That's one of the, one of the main things I think goes into being a long-term
1774.52s: trader is the ability to kind of agnosticly take a look at what you're doing.
1779.16s: Yes.
1779.96s: Be honest with yourself.
1781.08s: Yes.
1781.32s: Because otherwise I like to say it a lot.
1783.48s: The whole trading thing, it's a, it's a one V1 sort of sport.
1787.40s: You verse yourself.
1788.44s: Yes.
1789.24s: You can lie all you want.
1790.36s: That's fine.
1790.92s: But money's not going to grow from that.
1792.52s: That's exactly right.
1793.72s: You kind of have to get the, you go out of the way early so that you can focus more on the growth.
1800.12s: Yeah.
1800.68s: Well, you know the hard thing, sorry.
1802.68s: No, please.
1803.40s: No, no, no.
1804.44s: I think the hard thing for us is to look at the difficult things
1808.52s: or the things that we aren't doing right and not judge ourselves.
1813.72s: The judging event creates an internal space of mental
1820.28s: division, you idiot, you moron, you, what the heck were you looking at, that sort of thing.
1827.08s: If you, if you say to yourself, all right, if my goal is always self-improvement and we know
1835.08s: that trading makes us better human beings, right?
1839.32s: It does because it makes us look at ourselves and go, why did you just do that?
1845.40s: And so if you can look at yourself without judgment and say, listen,
1854.28s: this you did incorrectly.
1856.76s: Let's look at why.
1859.24s: And you strip that judgment, finger pointing thing that we have a tendency to do
1866.36s: because we, we're just terrible to ourselves.
1870.76s: And my philosophy is always, I tell my kids all the time, listen, do your best not to have
1879.40s: negative self-talk because there's going to be somebody out there that is going to just,
1886.28s: they can't wait to knock you off your game.
1890.76s: Don't you be doing it.
1892.36s: Let them do it.
1893.32s: You don't do it.
1894.20s: And so, and I talk a big game, I won't say, but I still say
1899.96s: to myself, you were just an idiot right there.
1902.84s: But the question is, when you get back at the end of the day and you do the homework,
1907.64s: which is super important, you got to do that homework.
1910.60s: A lot of us do not like the homework part of trading,
1914.44s: but it's sort of like being a professional athlete and never going to the practice field.
1918.60s: I make that exact parallel all the time.
1922.04s: I literally just quoted Ronnie Coleman the other day.
1927.64s: You know, he is that I love the saying.
1929.96s: I like to work out and his saying is, you know,
1931.80s: everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody,
1934.04s: nobody want to lift this heavy ass weight.
1936.28s: It's the same thing.
1937.08s: Everybody ready to make a buck.
1940.28s: Nobody wants to put it in order.
1941.48s: Yeah, it's absolutely true.
1944.44s: And so because it's not exciting, it's boring to look over that sort of stuff.
1951.64s: But I got to tell you, it pays off in space.
1954.52s: So when you think to yourself, what's my edge?
1960.68s: You know, we all have to have that edge because we are trading against the smartest people
1966.84s: and the fastest machines in the world.
1970.04s: And so we have to respect our opponents in terms of saying, all right,
1975.24s: what are you going to put up your sleeve here that I'm going to see?
1980.04s: And I'm going to be able, because I have a skiff,
1983.08s: and you've got a battleship, I can move a lot faster than you.
1986.76s: And that's going to be my edge.
1989.24s: And so if I'm looking at that and I go, what is that edge?
1994.52s: The biggest part of it is going to be your mental strength in terms of saying,
1999.64s: all right, have I framed this out to say,
2004.52s: if I'm right, then this will happen.
2006.76s: If I'm wrong, then this will happen.
2009.48s: And if I'm wrong and I see this going to happen,
2012.36s: I have a choice in between the gap of Oli Cow,
2017.00s: I just see that I might be wrong.
2019.40s: What's the triage here?
2021.00s: Do I cut and run?
2022.92s: Or do I figure out some sort of hedging event?
2028.12s: And most of us have a trading plan and it goes like this,
2033.00s: I'm going to buy here and my stop is going to be here and my target's going to be here.
2038.20s: And what is that military saying?
2042.36s: No plan survives.
2045.16s: First contact, yeah.
2046.36s: Yes, there we have, right?
2048.84s: That's trading in a snap.
2051.64s: I absolutely.
2052.84s: So we get into that and we think we have a trading plan because we know our stop,
2060.44s: we think we know our entry and we think we know our target.
2063.24s: And that's not a plan at all.
2065.80s: The plan is okay.
2068.44s: What if you come off the rise and there's a bunch of stuff there that you didn't think you're going to see?
2073.56s: So everything is about contingency planning,
2078.84s: but at the same time, not second guessing.
2083.32s: Right.
2084.04s: There's a difference, right?
2085.80s: To orient and observe or to observe and then orient.
2090.68s: Orienting doesn't mean second guessing.
2093.80s: It means always looking at the landscape and saying,
2098.44s: has anything changed to materially affect my initial trajectory in this case?
2108.28s: And slow and easy.
2109.96s: Slow and easy.
2110.68s: I used to throw 50 things of spaghetti at the wall and whichever ones hit were great.
2118.52s: Now I'm much more of a sniper rifle approach.
2123.96s: Right.
2124.68s: I'm just over focused, one or two things.
2129.80s: And you know, it's a grind if you do it.
2135.56s: The rewards are great, but the work is intense.
2142.52s: The work is there.
2143.24s: Yeah.
2143.64s: Yeah.
2144.76s: You hit on a couple good things that I definitely, I definitely identify with one of one of the main
2152.44s: things is you're kind of just talking about is the idea of just being thoughtful on what you're
2159.48s: going to choose to kind of expose yourself to.
2162.92s: Yeah.
2163.72s: And that's one of the things that I talk a lot about.
2166.92s: And at the end of the day, I think the number one trait of a long-term traitor is there
2173.32s: a risk manager that's it's got to come first.
2175.80s: And like you were talking about with your contingency plans, the two things you mentioned
2180.60s: adding a hedge or exiting the trade, both risk management, just a really, really important
2187.40s: concept for people to kind of get their their arms around and I'm glad you brought those up.
2193.32s: Now we are coming up.
2195.80s: We have about 20 minutes left.
2197.40s: So what I would love to do is dig a little bit more into kind of just your general trading style.
2203.96s: What do you like to do?
2205.00s: You know, you can go as far in depth or as not far in depth as you want, but I would love to just
2209.64s: learn a little bit more about your approach to the markets.
2212.92s: Sure.
2214.28s: I like, I trade the futures because of the leverage.
2218.68s: I love the leverage.
2221.56s: And you know, leverage works for you when you know what you're doing and against you when you don't.
2227.16s: Or you get yourself in a pickle, but I like that.
2230.36s: And what I've noticed is even though I trade
2234.92s: intra-day, several times a day, I always look at the following.
2240.44s: I look at how did this instrument close on the quarter?
2245.72s: Right.
2246.36s: What is the high?
2247.00s: What is the low?
2247.72s: What's the open?
2248.28s: What's the close?
2249.32s: How did it close last month?
2253.16s: High, low, open, close.
2254.92s: And so I'll do everything and I'll map those on my chart.
2260.04s: And I will not count overnight trading.
2263.64s: So I will put a chart that only has the regular trading hour.
2267.72s: Right.
2268.12s: It's a very extended hour too.
2269.80s: Yes.
2270.76s: And so that's where the heaviest volume is going to be.
2273.64s: Except for things like gold and maybe oil once in a while because you know,
2278.04s: those are all traded across the pond also.
2280.84s: So when we take a look at that, I will always look at a chart and go
2286.92s: I'll establish prevailing trend and then near-term behavior.
2293.72s: So for instance, let's pick something that we both might have familiarity with.
2301.80s: You pick.
2302.36s: I was going to say any any future.
2304.36s: I trade on pretty much daily myself.
2306.52s: So yeah.
2307.00s: Right.
2307.40s: So let's take a look at the ES.
2309.00s: Okay.
2309.96s: Okay.
2310.68s: And so the ES had a spike up into 37, 14 or 37, 16 a couple of days ago.
2324.04s: And that actually was the gamma traders sort of told us what was going on with this.
2333.48s: What there's a really side note.
2336.20s: There's a very interesting.
2337.88s: I'm going to send you some stuff on gamma.
2339.56s: Cool.
2340.20s: So that you can see where they're going to pull price to before it collapses.
2348.12s: Yeah.
2348.60s: And so this month it was 3700.
2353.00s: And I went and looked at the option chains and I said, yeah,
2356.60s: but we've got about 3710 to 3715.
2361.56s: I see a lot of collection right there.
2364.84s: I bet you we stretch over this 3700.
2368.04s: And so we put the high end.
2371.00s: And so my question is I come into the next day is always the following.
2375.72s: Am I seeing strength or weakness relative to the prior day?
2380.36s: That means it's strength if it's up over the close of the prior day.
2386.84s: And did you got a toy?
2389.24s: Yeah, I just saw him with popcorn.
2390.84s: He's just whipping that thing around.
2392.44s: Sorry.
2393.64s: Oh no.
2394.44s: I do.
2395.24s: I absolutely love animals.
2397.16s: So we take a look at the strength.
2400.36s: The moment it starts losing either the high or the close,
2403.96s: we have to think about why.
2406.60s: Right.
2407.24s: But why does price lose a level anyway?
2410.20s: It means that the pressure of sellers is more than the pressure of buyers.
2416.44s: Now there's this storyboard where people go, you know, for every seller there's a buyer.
2422.60s: Yes, of course.
2423.88s: We know that to be true.
2425.48s: However, there are sellers that have the ability to sell five contracts
2431.48s: and sellers that have the ability to sell 5,000 contracts.
2436.68s: And so that's what we're looking at from that strength perspective.
2441.00s: The moment weakness begins to occur, I will start saying, all right,
2446.20s: if the buyers are finished with getting to the top of the range,
2451.24s: they'll pull backwards and they'll go, I need to go find a value spot.
2457.48s: I don't know where it is, but it might be the prior days open.
2461.48s: It might be the weekly open, but those levels I have plotted on my chart.
2467.32s: Got it.
2468.04s: And so I will simply trade from one stair step to the other.
2472.36s: Got it.
2473.24s: And I'll get in and I'll get out.
2476.28s: I used to run cycles where I would go, okay,
2479.40s: I know it's going to fade a little bit and then bounce.
2483.16s: I'm not really sure where it's going to fade, but I know I've got a fairly good risk threshold
2488.12s: and what's been happening is the volatility expansion from the Algos has been brutal.
2496.84s: Absolutely.
2498.52s: I mean flying through support levels and not recovering for two days, which is terrible.
2506.60s: I'm terrible.
2508.44s: And so I just move from the one cycle to the next in the direction of trade and I'm always thinking,
2516.12s: okay, and Marie, if you're right, what are you going to see right after you engage?
2524.28s: And if you're wrong, what are you going to see?
2527.88s: So you better be looking for where you might be wrong.
2531.24s: Because that's the stuff that you know, slaps us when we don't even notice that it's we don't
2537.96s: even know it's coming and then all of a sudden, bam.
2540.44s: And so we have to, I mean, you're on high alerts looking for something that might tell you the rug,
2549.72s: might get pulled out from you.
2551.48s: Otherwise, you just go slow and easy and you get to where you're going and you get out.
2557.32s: My thought is because we are small retail traders and we're not playing with nine and 12 zeroes,
2566.52s: we really want to sit back and say, where can I dash out, grab my piece of cheese and then
2577.40s: head back for cover.
2578.92s: Right.
2579.16s: And so I'll, you know, I used to trade maybe 30, 40, 50 trades a day.
2585.08s: Now I'm maybe now I do four.
2587.56s: Okay.
2588.44s: So I've been just slowed that down.
2590.68s: Do you just size up on those as compared to when you were doing like 30 or
2594.44s: okay, so the way I decide the way I decide to size up means
2599.64s: have I hit an important sport level and I'm coming off of that sport level.
2604.28s: If I have, I could size up.
2607.64s: Okay.
2609.08s: If I am moving counter trend, I will always be half size.
2613.96s: Got it.
2615.40s: Because you never know with counter trend motion.
2618.76s: Sure.
2619.24s: You don't know if it's going to, so I don't want to have a great morning,
2624.04s: take a counter trend trade in the afternoon and then end up negative for the day,
2629.88s: which has happened to me more times than I cared accounts.
2633.24s: Sure.
2633.88s: So I'm always looking at all right, if I'm going in the direction of broad trend,
2640.04s: meaning is my VWAP up, am I moving weekly highs.
2647.56s: If all of that is there, I know in very deep support zones,
2651.48s: I'm going to be able to add with size to move up the chain.
2655.32s: Right.
2655.80s: If I come into resistance and it's heavy resistance,
2660.04s: like where all those gamma traders were, I can trade heavy.
2664.36s: But otherwise, I will trade small and often, but not very often.
2674.60s: Right.
2675.16s: You're right.
2675.32s: My thought is always to push the envelope enough that you feel like you're
2686.60s: really having to be fully engaged, but not so much that you've got butterflies in your
2692.20s: space.
2693.32s: Right.
2694.20s: That you're stressed out and what.
2695.56s: Because what happens from a biological space, what happens is that floods the brain with cortisol.
2704.76s: And cortisol short circuits the prefrontal cortex.
2709.72s: The prefrontal cortex is where we make all complex decisions.
2713.32s: And so I really try to not get myself in that kind of space where my emotions are going to make me
2725.48s: click the button when I shouldn't be.
2728.12s: Yeah.
2728.76s: I think that that's another great point.
2732.12s: Do you, when you're kind of doing your daily trades, do you like to trade futures outright?
2738.04s: Or do you trade options on futures?
2739.96s: I like to trade the futures outright.
2746.04s: You know, I don't know why I never pick the futures options.
2750.44s: I know there's even more leverage there.
2754.44s: I just don't know why I haven't done it.
2757.88s: Yeah, it's definitely something that I like to take a look at.
2764.20s: If if I'm just intraday scalping, I will tend to just trade the future itself.
2770.28s: And the main reason there is just liquidity.
2772.44s: It's a little easier.
2773.48s: Yeah.
2774.60s: But if I'm looking at any sort of slightly longer term style trade, I'll typically go to options
2781.08s: on futures just for the really the leverage.
2784.60s: In terms of settlement, how is the settlement?
2790.84s: Does it take longer for the settlement of the futures option versus the future?
2798.60s: And it depends on obviously on what you're trading, what the settlement style is, cash for
2803.48s: the major indices that settle to cash, same same.
2807.48s: And then for the kind of commodities backed product stuff like that, it'll just settle to the
2813.64s: futures contract itself.
2815.48s: And then whenever that contract is due to expire,
2818.36s: then whatever will happen on that underlying contract.
2823.72s: Yeah, based on the contract itself.
2825.48s: Yeah, somebody just said that to me a couple of weeks ago, they were like, why don't you do
2829.80s: the options?
2830.68s: And I just listen, I love options.
2833.08s: I do.
2833.64s: I just have not ever looked.
2836.04s: We'll have to we'll have to chat offline about a couple of those things because
2841.24s: yeah, I just want to.
2843.88s: Yeah.
2844.76s: Yeah, happy to.
2846.20s: I think that they're they're really cool products, the options on futures.
2849.96s: I'm definitely a fan of them.
2852.44s: So with our last few minutes here, there's two other questions I wanted to ask you.
2858.04s: The first one is what did you think about the past year?
2870.84s: Certainly one for the record books.
2873.40s: Um, for me,
2878.04s: I'm a sort of very pragmatic.
2881.80s: I think to myself, what can I do to change what's happening here in my personal space?
2888.84s: Right? Is there anything I can do to affect or influence anything big?
2895.56s: And it turns out like, no, I can't.
2900.04s: And so I have this thought in my mind of, you know, I really can't do anything.
2906.12s: So I'm not going to fret about it.
2908.52s: I'm just going to I'm going to chill.
2911.56s: Somebody wants me to do this.
2913.00s: Fine.
2913.64s: My thought is, especially with a family and that sort of thing, my thought is,
2920.44s: can I keep the people around me from spinning up?
2926.84s: Because we're all sort of, I don't know, we're a family that's very,
2935.80s: and so I have to go, wait, let's, can we just calm down?
2942.36s: We can't, we can, you know, like the the theories, especially my sons, they are just,
2949.80s: I'm like, wait a second.
2952.44s: We can't change any of that.
2954.04s: So just don't think about packing a weapons bag and head off to outer Montana or wherever.
2963.08s: Right?
2963.80s: And so that that really has been my goal for the year.
2968.28s: Am I concerned about what I perceive happening?
2975.40s: Yes.
2976.68s: Sure.
2977.72s: And so I try to be as liquid as I can be and fluid as I can be and just not to be mentally locked
2989.24s: in a box.
2990.52s: So again, I think trading has done that for me.
2994.12s: It's allowed me to go, hey, don't spin up.
2997.64s: What are you seeing?
2999.96s: What can you influence here?
3002.36s: Where is your direct
3006.68s: sphere and what do you need to do in your space?
3010.36s: And the rest of it, I'm like, you know, you're just going to see people go
3018.12s: guano crazy.
3019.96s: Yeah.
3020.44s: Yeah.
3021.00s: We are.
3022.92s: And you just have to, you know, you got to, you got to roll with it.
3028.20s: Just got to watch, yeah.
3029.64s: Yeah, exactly.
3030.60s: And prepare.
3032.20s: Watch and prepare and not be
3036.60s: not be overly complacent.
3038.76s: And so, you know, it's just like sitting in your trade, you know, if you go,
3043.96s: and I, you know, what this thing is going to turn around, it's, and then every day goes
3047.96s: lower and lower and you're like, okay, maybe I ought to think about what I need to do with this trade.
3054.12s: So we really don't want things like that to happen with the real world.
3058.84s: So, you know, you just prepare and there are days coming that I think are going to be
3067.48s: probably darker than we would want to them to be.
3073.16s: But, you know, the sun will rise again.
3077.40s: And those of us that are
3081.48s: directed shall prevail.
3083.80s: Yeah, I think that's fair.
3085.00s: I think, uh, maybe it's a life goes.
3087.80s: Yeah.
3088.76s: The, uh, the last question I wanted to ask you for at least for me when I look back at the past year,
3097.96s: kind of in general, like you were talking about, I've just seen a bunch of volatility.
3101.88s: Not like not even just from a trading perspective, just the world.
3105.40s: Yeah, just like.
3107.80s: But then kind of drawing that parallel to trading itself,
3113.08s: this last year has been fascinating to me.
3116.12s: Yes.
3116.84s: Because just about everything that, you know, I base my decisions on and whatnot,
3121.16s: it's all different this year.
3122.36s: Yes, out of window.
3124.12s: So the, the kind of last thing I wanted to ask you is just what were maybe one or two things
3131.08s: that you saw throughout this year that were just extremely unique, uh, compared to what you've seen
3137.72s: in previous years?
3139.56s: Well, I think the biggest thing is that it's the stuff, you know, people are talking about it now,
3149.32s: but we started seeing it shift maybe towards June, July.
3154.20s: How much the option, how much the option space is actually driving the market versus the market
3163.00s: driving the option space.
3165.40s: That is the most remarkably different thing that I've seen.
3171.16s: It's been a, a very tough year for me because I feel like there are no natural rhythms of
3179.72s: ebb and flow that have appeared in times past.
3183.80s: Right.
3184.68s: And so there's a lot that I've had to change.
3188.36s: But you know, adapt or die, right?
3191.56s: And so the big things that I've seen, the biggest thing is what
3198.28s: options are doing to drive the market because the market maker who is seeing the call options
3205.48s: just continually rise in order for his delta not to be savagely negative because he's got the
3213.16s: other side of that.
3213.96s: He's got to go by the stock.
3216.12s: And so that is really driving this motion.
3221.48s: You know, every person I talk to in the options pits are like, I've never seen anything like this.
3227.40s: You know, they're buying calls in mass, $200 out of the money in, you know, something like
3237.24s: Apple or Tesla or whatever, right?
3239.72s: It's just extraordinary motion.
3243.48s: And here is the biggest thing.
3247.00s: When moves get very fast, it's like blowing a bubble very quickly.
3256.36s: It will snap without any notion that it's going to snap.
3264.44s: If you blow a bubble with the bubble come and you blow it slowly,
3269.32s: you can see those edges and you can go, all right, this is.
3275.40s: But it's moving so fast that when it comes, I mean, we're going to get up and it's going to be
3280.84s: limit down for days.
3282.60s: Right.
3284.28s: It's just a matter of time.
3286.68s: The big thing I just read before I got on this call with you is what's going on with
3294.52s: China and the loans and everybody having reading about that.
3300.28s: It's a restructure all the loans.
3303.48s: And so the only thing that makes a market crash is illiquidity.
3308.28s: That's the only thing.
3310.36s: And so it's going to come.
3312.20s: The reason they say, you know, the credit guys are the smartest guys in the room
3317.16s: is because they're seeing where people are getting in big trouble and they can hedge in that space.
3323.88s: And we're going to start having these pockets of illiquidity and it doesn't matter how much money
3328.36s: they print. The more money they print, the less reliable the whole system becomes.
3338.52s: And so, you know, it's, but these things sometimes can take 15 years to unwind.
3346.60s: So, you know, I mean, the 2006, 2007 crisis we had, it started in 1985.
3356.04s: So, who knows?
3359.40s: Yeah. I've been.
3360.44s: They need today, maybe tomorrow.
3362.28s: I've been blown away just the the overall move of the move of the market this year and kind of like you
3369.16s: in a very similar way.
3370.44s: I've been very, very mindful of how much risk I need to put out and realistically most months,
3377.72s: I would put out the minimum I needed, you know, just kind of a sooner money.
3382.36s: Exactly.
3382.68s: You're not the same way.
3384.20s: Yeah.
3384.68s: I'm the same way.
3386.20s: Just very small exposure to the market because you know, I'm old.
3392.76s: And so I don't, I mean, although I want to trade until I die, I don't want to have to trade
3398.76s: until I die.
3399.88s: Right.
3400.04s: Right.
3400.36s: And so how I make money now is just that slow and easy space and say, you know, I would love to pat
3408.92s: myself on the back and get a great big home run someplace.
3413.72s: But it's just, it's just not wise right now.
3416.84s: It's pretty, really not wise.
3418.60s: Like you're talking about with your background with probabilities and statistics.
3421.80s: It's just not, it's not, not great right now.
3424.68s: Yeah.
3425.48s: Yeah.
3426.36s: Well, this was such an enjoyable conversation.
3428.84s: Oh, this is awesome.
3430.12s: Glad I got to talk to you.
3432.12s: I look forward to keeping in touch some more.
3434.92s: Yeah, that would be absolutely great.
3436.84s: And then if there's anything that you want to share with the group, if you have any,
3442.76s: like Instagram handles or Twitter, whatever you like to use, just I'll throw it all in the
3448.12s: description.
3448.68s: But you know, I'd love to just essentially expose folks to do your work.
3453.64s: Well, I thank you very much.
3455.24s: I think it'll be great.
3457.16s: And I'll make sure to share the link when this gets through and have some folks get to hear
3464.60s: from you guys.
3465.16s: I think the, I love the military community that you have there because, you know, it's,
3472.84s: it's important, right?
3475.64s: It's important that they get the chance.
3479.56s: And, you know, I trade with a couple of my kids.
3484.44s: I've taught a couple of them to trade.
3487.00s: And I just think it's exciting to be able to share that information and have people
3494.20s: learn from each other in important ways.
3497.16s: It is.
3497.56s: Yeah.
3497.88s: And the thing that gets me with the military folks in general is a lot of them just don't have
3502.84s: the natural exposure, right?
3504.28s: There's not a lot of traders, especially in derivatives.
3507.32s: But at the end of the day, what I do find is the folks that I do come across.
3511.64s: Most of them are pretty damn good at it once they get going.
3514.36s: They, they want to learn and then they have discipline when they're in their
3517.24s: execution.
3518.04s: That is it.
3519.64s: Yeah.
3519.96s: It's discipline is all.
3522.20s: It is absolutely the anchor to the work.
3526.68s: Yep.
3527.16s: I absolutely agree.
3527.96s: So it was awesome chatting with you.
3530.76s: And then, yeah, until next time.
3533.56s: Yes.
3534.52s: Yeah, I'm sure we'll be in touch.
3536.36s: All right.
3536.92s: Take care.
3537.72s: Take care, I'm right.
