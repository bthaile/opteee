0.44s: what's up all quick market update we're
2.12s: going to talk about the market as a
3.48s: whole super fast then I want to talk
5.04s: about djt and then I want to talk about
7.48s: GameStop because we had some news pop
9.32s: today that's actually pretty cool so
11.12s: from a broad Market perspective we saw a
13.04s: little bit of downturn today the
14.72s: interesting part about this downturn is
16.92s: that it's mixed within the sectors from
19.60s: within the S&P 500 this simply means
21.52s: that it's not like this Universal broad
24.40s: scale selloff because we can see things
27.68s: like xlc XLF xli all hit highs today so
32.56s: there are sectors within the S&P 500
35.32s: that actually are still hitting highs
37.36s: even though we saw a bit of a rotation
38.92s: over so what really led to that rotation
41.24s: over because if we take a look at xly
43.48s: XLV xlu all of those were up slightly on
46.60s: the day XL re was up on the day xlp was
49.44s: up on the day so was xlb so if you look
51.80s: at it most of the sectors were up
54.20s: generally on the day we have XLF and xli
57.48s: which were red on the day but both still
59.12s: gapped up and started much higher so
62.08s: this is the problem Tech we saw xlk had
65.60s: a pretty significant down day today so
69.00s: technology continues to be a bit of a
71.72s: pain now taking a quick look at just the
75.20s: heat map again you can see an elements
77.00s: of what I'm talking about in terms of
78.88s: what's doing well what's not energy in
80.92s: and of itself is generally red we're not
83.68s: seeing like massive sell-offs but
86.04s: definitely downside pressure and
88.08s: Consumer Staples looks like it's
89.44s: performing well well financials
90.80s: performing well Schwab had a pretty big
93.52s: gap up today even though it was red on
95.84s: the day it still very much is up so
98.76s: overall we're getting into earnings and
100.84s: the market looks quite mixed so if we
103.36s: take a look at City group and Goldman
105.32s: Sachs from yesterday they both performed
107.16s: well with respect to EPS versus
110.12s: estimates versus actual and then today
112.56s: we saw a continuation of that so PNC BAC
116.24s: even Schwab Schwab had a really
118.44s: interesting move if we pull up schw we
121.56s: can see again had a a pretty big gap up
124.56s: but then ended down on the day so from a
127.88s: broad Market perspective all this means
130.64s: keep risk front of mind we are not in
134.28s: this really calm persistent bull market
137.88s: we are hovering near highs here and
140.20s: people start to get really jittery and
142.52s: Things become slightly tenuous if we
144.60s: take a look at vix on a 6-month time
146.28s: frame we can see that the average price
148.88s: is about what is this
151.36s: 1951 relatively high if I look at this
153.96s: on a 5-year weekly time frame which does
156.40s: include 2020 the average in this is like
160.08s: 1515 so what I'm flagging for you it's a
162.60s: little higher actually I'm sorry it's
163.64s: like 16 and a quarter I was using the
165.04s: point of control like yeah maybe 16 what
169.72s: I'm flagging for you is volatility is
172.76s: expanding at this point even though
174.88s: we're hovering at all-time highs that
176.80s: kind of Divergence is something to be
178.48s: aware of okay cool
180.40s: now let's take a peek at djt really
182.32s: quick because we came across some
184.32s: interesting stuff yesterday during the
186.16s: live stream that I want to highlight for
187.96s: everybody and djt has been essentially
191.08s: this big proxy for Donald Trump
193.52s: potentially winning the election and if
195.16s: we take a look at the prediction markets
196.92s: as it sits it does look like that's
199.76s: right now the favorite outcome so I'll
202.56s: grab poly markets for us and we
204.68s: literally can look at it together so
207.24s: here's poly market and if we take a look
210.52s: at
211.68s: the presidential election we can see
215.28s: that the winner right now and this
216.60s: actually went up over yesterday so their
218.92s: pricing winner is Trump 57 a half Cala
221.64s: is 42.1% is the winner so the reason why
226.04s: I use prediction markets for this is
228.00s: because prediction markets aren't Laden
231.20s: with different political bias like
233.76s: prediction markets don't care
235.56s: necessarily who wins we're just trying
237.68s: to be able to price it as efficiently as
239.48s: possible and then to trade it that's a
241.16s: Trader's mindset you should like whoever
243.60s: you like that's cool I still want to try
245.76s: to make money on the event itself so
248.28s: that's why this is actually a really
250.24s: really great tool to forecast
252.44s: probability of thing probabilities of
254.60s: things because really smart people that
256.76s: are trying to make a lot of money are
258.72s: going to be here and you can see there's
259.96s: $570 million in here so well that's just
263.52s: on the Trump side by the way so the
265.00s: market here is liquid there's definitely
266.56s: people participating you can see up here
268.12s: it's 1.9 billion to total volume in this
270.96s: so lots and lots of people interested in
274.76s: the outcome so that takes us back then
277.12s: to djt being this proxy for Trump
280.84s: winning the election now it contracted
282.48s: massively today who knows this is
284.08s: essentially a meme stock at this point
285.96s: this will EB and flow as its popularity
288.08s: es and flows but what I can say is it's
290.40s: made a move from 11 and 3/4 and it
292.76s: almost hit 35 I mean we're not that far
295.92s: off from 35 here so people are playing
297.84s: this for the general movement now if we
300.20s: take a peek at the options chain we can
302.44s: see a few things that it's kind of a
305.16s: even split calls and puts we can see
306.96s: 421,000 calls against 445k puts and you
310.52s: can see that the Lion Share of these
313.04s: bigger positions are 15 no which is
315.40s: obviously following the election so if
316.92s: we limit this by the election expiration
319.72s: you can see that it's 158 versus 153,000
323.88s: for both um calls and puts respectively
327.84s: so yeah people are speculating here here
330.08s: lots of people are selling calls as we
331.88s: can tell 25% of the volume today was
334.44s: calls being transacted at the bid or
336.04s: below typically a sale so this is
339.00s: overall just an interesting thing to
341.04s: follow along and if we grab unusual
343.68s: whales really quick we'll take a look at
346.32s: just the options volume in here to give
348.44s: you a sense of how that's been going on
351.12s: a recent basis so what I'm going to do
353.44s: is flag month to date which is today's
357.16s: the
358.28s: 15th so let's let's see what kind of
360.32s: Trades we have coming in so there's one
363.92s: really big trade $935,000 in the
369.56s: 15 nove 24 21 calls so these would have
374.00s: been up quite a lot yesterday uh I don't
376.32s: know where they're at today but this
379.00s: person obviously this looks like a
380.92s: speculative play to the upside and we
382.72s: can see elements of that both to the
384.40s: upside to the downside and we can see
386.60s: that this option chain has gotten really
388.80s: active in the last month or so so that
391.88s: is djt it's exhibiting pretty
394.40s: significant volatility implied
395.80s: volatility percentile is literally at
397.40s: 100% pegged up and it's at
400.32s: 33.6% IV super super
402.88s: high now over to GameStop we can see
406.12s: that it had a little bit of an inside
407.96s: day it was down just about a quarter
410.12s: point but there was some cool news now I
412.68s: am not going to pretend to know much
414.88s: about any of this because I don't but
417.24s: it's cool to see some activity and for
419.68s: anybody looking to understand what this
421.28s: means more the only person I could think
423.16s: of that would be the guy to talk to is
425.08s: Richard Newton so go check out his
426.92s: YouTube channel for sure because I'm
429.00s: positive I haven't looked but I'm
430.16s: positive he's going to be talking about
431.48s: this and he knows a lot about
434.48s: Collectibles cards and stuff like that I
436.88s: do not so anyways though this does look
439.32s: cool where we can see that there's a
441.36s: collaboration that's started between
442.68s: GameStop and PSA and you can see that
445.48s: it's going to become an authorized PSA
447.24s: dealer and PSA will provide grading
449.20s: servic for trading cards through select
451.68s: GameStop stores so this doesn't look
455.24s: like massive news but it looks like some
459.24s: sort of activity which is what people
461.88s: are trying to see we're trying to see
463.96s: what the future looks like for gametop
466.00s: based on different pieces of trickled
468.80s: out information like this that gives
470.64s: some insights into what the future is
472.28s: going to look like because it's been
473.84s: very quiet we do know that they're
476.04s: sitting on quite literally billions in
478.40s: cash so they
479.96s: have tons of money to do things and what
484.20s: the structure of this deal is going to
485.60s: look like I'm not sure yet I haven't
488.36s: seen a lot of detail on it but you can
492.40s: see that GameStop is now starting to
495.80s: make a little bit of action and that's
498.88s: awesome to see so I'm keeping an eye on
501.44s: the news to see if there's any you
503.60s: know really big takeaways from it I
506.84s: haven't seen anything that pops out to
509.28s: me yet and just from a market
511.00s: perspective I haven't really seen a a
513.84s: really significant change in price so
516.20s: typically if this is like a massive
517.80s: announcement you would see price start
520.28s: flying all over the place but this this
522.72s: Pikachu looks really cool I can't read
524.84s: any of that I'll be completely honest
526.36s: and I also have to be honest this
527.68s: Pikachu looks a little chubby we might
530.04s: need to get Pikachu some salad but I do
532.28s: like Pikachu maybe he's getting bulked
534.48s: up maybe it's because we're rolling into
536.24s: fall season thus winter bulking season
539.76s: trying to get massive for then the
541.92s: summer cut I would accept that as an
543.84s: answer but who knows so yeah I am really
548.40s: really interested to see what this grows
549.92s: into it wouldn't be overly surprising to
552.64s: see some sort of different card
554.72s: offerings they I'm sure GameStop could
556.96s: start their own if they were so inclined
558.44s: and people chew it up kind of like what
560.40s: we've seen somebody like Trump do with
561.80s: his collectible cards the fact that
563.28s: people are buying those astonishing to
566.08s: me but people really like the stuff that
568.32s: they like so I could see that being a
570.48s: future Direction I have no idea which
572.84s: way it's going to go and the other thing
574.40s: is I honestly have absolutely no idea if
577.28s: this is what what this means in terms of
579.92s: price you guys will have to tell me in
581.20s: the comments is this expensive is this
583.52s: not expensive I've never done this so I
586.60s: have no reference for how impactful this
589.76s: is but it does look like an an
593.20s: interesting thing and it gives the
595.04s: stores a physical purpose now because
597.88s: again like peripherals and stuff like
599.48s: you can argue there a physical purpose
600.80s: for sure but they can still be shipped
602.72s: and a lot of this stuff could be shipped
604.48s: but there's actually a lot more risk in
606.60s: shipping your precious card that's
609.28s: collectible I would be really nervous to
612.32s: ship something like that around so this
614.32s: is actually kind of cool to me that you
616.00s: can find more of these locally that PSI
618.92s: PSA is pretty widely accepted and you
621.20s: can go walk in and have them evaluated
623.44s: again I don't know if this is expensive
624.76s: or not but to me 20 bucks a card seems a
627.48s: little steep especially if the card is
629.80s: you know comes out to not be worth a
631.60s: whole lot but my guess is they probably
633.32s: have some sort of effective way to make
636.88s: this palatable for people to go get
638.60s: their cards looked at but you guys will
639.96s: have to let me know more about it from
642.20s: an options perspective GameStop has been
645.40s: relatively quiet so let me grab the
648.80s: options chain and I'm going to look at I
651.52s: don't care about the sales here I want
653.64s: to look at um transactions for calls
656.80s: people accumulating so there was was a
660.56s: pretty big trade yesterday for 500 of
664.24s: the 10 calls but these are out in 2026
666.68s: 2025 for the next biggest so these are
669.36s: people building out longer term
670.84s: positions which again that's a little
673.56s: more um overall price accumulation style
676.56s: play versus this really near-term focus
679.48s: that we tend to see in GameStop options
682.36s: so if we take a look at the trade tab
684.16s: for GameStop and we look across
689.52s: open interest for everything still a ton
692.44s: of calls 712 713 th000 against 290k on
697.20s: the put side and if we take a look at
699.24s: what concentration of those is in the
700.72s: front expiration 338,000
703.44s: half so there's still just this massive
706.80s: massive exposure to front expirations
709.88s: which I cannot help but find that to be
712.96s: so curious because um for those that
715.88s: don't know on Saturday I've been doing a
719.72s: live stream looking at all of roaring
722.44s: Kitty old trades and I'm grabbing the
725.00s: workbook right now so that I can show
726.48s: you because this activity of playing
730.40s: this front expiration so heavy is so
733.96s: interesting to me because for the people
736.08s: that are trying to emulate what the cat
738.64s: did that's really not what he's done so
742.20s: if we take a look at his options plays
744.52s: what I started to do is actually build
746.64s: out a view over here that shows me the
750.08s: nearest expiration for all of these
752.48s: different options plays that he's made
754.24s: again this is now literally going back
755.80s: to the very beginning the very first
757.52s: post that he made and we're still
759.48s: working through the 2024 stuff what I
761.64s: want to highlight from what I've seen so
763.32s: far is he did a 3 DTE trade one time and
767.88s: that was around an earnings event so
770.60s: this was a event driven near-term play
773.80s: and he ended up essentially having that
775.56s: option expire worthless so I just bring
778.12s: that to people's attention because as I
779.64s: go through the rest of all these
781.36s: different trades that I've seen him made
783.24s: you can see 94 DTE these are 107 DTE
787.64s: these are 52 DTE he first put these on
790.84s: at 495 DTE so a lot of these trades that
794.28s: he's building even later into the time
796.20s: here like this one 137 DTE he's building
799.48s: things with pretty longterm expirations
802.84s: that's playing the value up which again
806.04s: I just find it slightly interesting when
808.28s: I look at how most people are playing
810.16s: GameStop here which is playing it like
813.08s: all the front week which is just a way
815.20s: to light money on fire and for a smarter
817.28s: way to buy options I'll link to a video
819.44s: below it's literally just to give you
821.40s: other ideas on how to potentially play
823.04s: this versus just buying super cheap far
825.24s: out of the money options and hoping
826.44s: something happens as always if you need
828.16s: anything let me know be an outlier see
829.48s: you later
