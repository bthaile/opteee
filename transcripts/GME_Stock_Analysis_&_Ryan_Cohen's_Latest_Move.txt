0.48s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.64s: we're taking a look at GameStop today
4.12s: for your weekly fix we're going to run
5.76s: through quick stock analysis we're going
7.36s: to talk about what we covered on the
9.68s: live stream last Saturday for anybody
11.84s: unable to make it give you a quick recap
13.68s: there we'll take a look at the options
15.20s: chain and then I'll give you a couple
16.52s: updates on the coverage strangle that I
18.64s: personally am running in GameStop so you
22.04s: can see some different ways to approach
24.12s: it so what's the latest well ever since
28.12s: we had this big massive down day 10 % in
30.40s: a day that was completely nondescript
32.28s: not tied to any sort of news interesting
35.24s: the stock continued down for a few days
37.60s: post that and then since this term low
40.52s: here that did dip below 265 it's now
43.52s: started consolidating and trending
45.12s: sideways so we did get a lower local
49.16s: high so this does confirm a downtrend
52.16s: and this now is all eyes on how we
55.76s: behave here there's two dominant ways it
59.28s: can go and again you can see I didn't
60.68s: draw any of these lines today these
62.08s: lines have been here for a little while
63.96s: actually drawn off this originally and
67.96s: we can see either it might decide to
71.40s: consolidate sideways for a little bit
73.60s: hovering around this 26 and A2 handle
76.00s: which I do think is fairly likely we can
79.16s: see that there's a really big volume
80.52s: note here and we can also see that this
82.44s: has been defined as support for a little
84.60s: while now this 26 and a and a half
86.60s: handle it's essentially all these
88.00s: transactions there so it did break break
90.08s: out of this descending Channel now the
93.00s: question is does this new breakout day
98.36s: start showing appreciation and
101.56s: challenging this lower local high which
103.72s: would then sign signal a shortterm trend
106.64s: reversal or does this move sideways
111.12s: consolidate purely or does this actually
113.88s: begin a downward move here now from my
117.52s: best analysis which again I'll always
120.00s: the caveat GameStop is very unique in
122.52s: the way that technical analysis applies
124.80s: to it in that it generally doesn't well
127.32s: that's actually a lie it generally does
129.24s: but a lot of the important times it
131.60s: doesn't so with that caveat aside this I
136.76s: think would be more likely to either
139.72s: consolidate sideways or consolidate and
142.68s: start to show some sort of trend
144.08s: reversal whether the trend reversal to
145.88s: the upside happens after today tomorrow
149.08s: next couple days it's hard to say it
150.64s: really depends on where order flow comes
152.68s: in but the fact that it punched below
155.84s: this 262 here it got close to it here
158.84s: and here and it kind of just was
161.20s: navigating above it that kind of shows
163.00s: us that the General accepted value for
165.00s: GameStop right now even from a
166.76s: short-term sentiment perspective is
168.40s: above the 26 a half handle so of those
171.32s: three Co courses of action I would
174.08s: presume the least likely would be a
176.36s: significant drop below the 262 and
179.44s: assumption of this downtrend could
181.28s: happen don't know but I personally think
183.32s: that's lower lower likelihood and then
186.32s: higher likelihood sideways consolidation
188.84s: followed by some sort of new approach to
191.56s: these local highs to see if if price
193.56s: will recapture those the way I look at
195.92s: this is there was no real material
198.20s: change anywhere in here and yet there
200.92s: was a lot of people willing to transact
202.80s: at these levels so with no true
205.04s: fundamental change in the company I
206.44s: don't see why people wouldn't be willing
208.56s: to transact at these levels though now
210.84s: another random piece of information that
213.56s: I came across from the Discord actually
217.24s: from just want to give credit to where I
219.68s: saw it from TCM King so shout out to TCM
223.48s: King from the Discord but he was
224.84s: essentially saying that Ryan Cohen just
227.04s: moved all of his shares out of RC
230.36s: Ventures into his personal name and if
233.88s: I'm not mistaken I actually think his
235.52s: personal entity is outside the country
238.76s: which I find that is very interesting I
241.00s: actually put an ask out on X to see if
245.44s: we know why this might be it looks like
247.76s: the entity is in Canada if I'm not
249.68s: mistaken so I I honestly don't know what
252.20s: to make of that I'm very eager to see
253.76s: what people think of
255.68s: it genuinely don't know I'm trying to
258.44s: understand what the potential pros and
259.96s: cons could be of making this kind of
261.76s: move there's lots of ideas I have but
264.16s: the ideas that I have don't really
265.60s: matter what matters is what I know and
267.48s: can prove and unfortunately right now
269.28s: there isn't much that I can prove with
271.36s: respect to why he might do this so my
273.64s: guesses will have a little bit more
275.08s: clarity about this throughout the week
276.92s: it's definitely something I'm going to
278.00s: look at and this is definitely something
279.20s: we'll look at on the Saturday stream but
281.44s: just in case you didn't know now
283.56s: speaking of the Saturday stream we had a
285.28s: really really fun series of
287.08s: conversations we spent a while talking
289.20s: about this AMA with Lucy kissar had a
292.32s: chance to learn a little bit about her I
293.88s: actually reached out to her and she's a
296.24s: journalist that deals a lot with
297.84s: offshore entities and she started tying
301.56s: some really interesting Trends between
304.48s: offshore entities ftds and naked
306.72s: shorting which then led us to find this
310.36s: video which is called The Wall Street
312.52s: conspiracy movie which we're going to
314.00s: continue next weekend uh we spent a
316.40s: while just kind of poking through this
318.32s: maybe almost 15 20 minutes and there's a
322.36s: lot of really interesting details in
324.80s: here and there's
326.56s: also um Susan trimbath who I've reached
329.40s: out to as well I'm hoping to do a
331.08s: podcast episode with her to just explore
333.60s: this whole thing a little bit more man
335.20s: look at that real thoughtful very
337.96s: pensive but it's you you kind of need to
341.12s: pay attention to when you're looking at
342.48s: this stuff because the rabbit hole goes
343.92s: deep real fast and I ain't that smart so
345.92s: we need all brain power applied as you
347.96s: could tell is happening right here so
350.32s: really interesting learning about more
352.20s: of the naked shorting the offshore
354.52s: component to it and the fact that this
356.16s: thing has been going on now for over 20
358.44s: years and this same damn conversation
362.80s: continues to be brought up it's actually
365.32s: a little disheartening but change can
367.76s: sometimes take a long time longer than
369.12s: we might like so the fact that there are
370.80s: still people actively fighting against
372.60s: this Dave laow from Iran Finance they
374.76s: just launched a lawsuit to start to try
376.64s: to highlight just more of this
379.44s: so it's a long fight got to keep on it
381.80s: that's all there is to it got to keep
382.92s: the pressure the the thing that ends up
384.68s: happening is people try to apply
386.04s: pressure they don't see the results that
387.52s: they want fast enough and then they fall
389.00s: off that can't happen because then it
391.32s: continues to happen unfortunately so
394.72s: let's take a peek over now at GameStop
397.36s: options and see if anything sticks out
399.20s: to us
401.00s: specifically uh big expansion actually
403.76s: in call open interest this was in the
405.40s: 500,000 before not big move on the put
407.88s: side I mean we are we are this is what I
410.96s: find interesting we are hovering at some
413.16s: of the highest call open interest skew
416.32s: that we've seen historically it's over
419.04s: three times
420.48s: the calls to puts but I'm not seeing any
423.84s: sort of significant series of
425.92s: transactions that
427.52s: indicate something's going on on the
429.64s: back end and that's both good and bad it
432.04s: means in the short term right now it
433.80s: doesn't look like people are positioning
435.88s: for some sort of anticipatory squeeze
439.08s: but it does look like people are trying
441.32s: to play this thing fairly directionally
443.80s: now you can see the volume today is huge
445.92s: 90,000 calls against 1650 puts but the
449.16s: vast majority of those are being sold my
451.64s: expectation for those is people trading
454.28s: uh covered calls I have those out right
456.60s: now and there's a benefit to trading
460.40s: stuff like that when the market is going
461.92s: through these kinds of down moves
463.76s: because the move that you saw in
464.88s: GameStop this isn't novel right this has
467.08s: been going on for several weeks now
468.84s: where it's starting to contract down and
472.40s: it offers an opportunity at least to
474.00s: take in some premium from a short call
475.64s: perspective make a little bit of money
477.04s: again and then you can choose to do with
478.92s: that whether it be buy more GameStop
480.68s: shares at a lower price as it's going
482.16s: down so on and so forth there's a lot of
483.96s: opportunities there so the main takeaway
486.48s: from an open interest perspective is
488.68s: really big call skew but I'm not seeing
490.76s: insane call volume meaning in terms of
493.80s: size and overall net premium the other
496.52s: thing is if we take a look at expiration
498.76s: Cycles it is all over the place this is
501.48s: anomalous compared to what we often see
503.28s: in GameStop where we see concentration
506.40s: heavy concentration in singular
508.88s: expiration typically the front
510.84s: expirations so if we take a look there's
512.96s: 643,000 calls if we take a look at the
515.40s: 31 gen there's 160k in the front
518.08s: expiration which is a lot to be very
519.56s: clear but for GameStop that's not the
521.16s: majority of this options chain which is
523.20s: interesting there's positioning out in
525.52s: 21 Feb there's light positioning 21
528.68s: March 17 April is heavier 20 June is
531.64s: heavier so these two combined are
533.68s: playing longer term ideas that's why
535.64s: they're that far out really light 18
537.64s: July that's common and then 16 Jan is
539.96s: pretty heavy and six uh 15 genan 27 is
544.64s: light and I would expect this one to
546.00s: stay light I would expect this one to
547.52s: continue to build out for those longer
549.24s: term ideas what I'm highlighting is that
551.40s: in terms of volatility dispersion it's
553.56s: across the expirations which again that
556.48s: tells us that people are playing a lot
558.36s: of different ideas it's not all crowded
560.68s: front expiration people expecting some
562.72s: really strong short-term movement if we
565.16s: take a look at volatility across the
566.68s: term structure we can see near-term Vol
570.16s: is actually starting to jack up a little
571.72s: bit which is interesting and we can see
573.24s: earnings right now is shown on the
576.08s: platform at the 25th of March after the
579.96s: close and if we take a look out here it
583.56s: Market doesn't look like it's buying it
585.44s: because we can see it's 78% Vol here
587.80s: only 80.7 6% Vol here I would expect the
591.44s: expiration cycle to contain this
593.12s: earnings release which would be this um
597.24s: 17 April I would expect this to be
599.68s: higher but what what will end up
601.84s: happening is as we get closer weeklys
604.68s: will be added so you'll see actually
607.40s: weeklys around this that will probably
609.08s: pop up andol pretty significantly all
611.80s: right last thing I want to show you
613.64s: quick update on the coverage strangle
615.64s: that we have built and this is currently
619.20s: what it's looking like so we still have
621.80s: the same $25,000 original allocation
624.52s: right now we're using 18,000 of that so
627.48s: about 73% utiliz
630.24s: we have the same options out there's
632.88s: essentially been no change over the last
634.32s: time you've seen this I know that's not
636.20s: sexy that's not super fun there's not a
637.96s: lot to dive into but this is what
639.88s: trading is sometimes it's a lot of
642.72s: putting stuff on and then just kind of
644.28s: letting it go now one admin note is this
648.00s: position is coming up on time on needing
650.60s: to be managed and we can see that I I
653.04s: have the 25s which are still out of the
655.20s: money even though it's at 27 A2 and it's
658.00s: been contracting so these have gotten
660.44s: slightly more expensive but volatility
663.24s: and time will continue to Decay out of
665.16s: those so this is a little bit of a
666.36s: waiting game on the put side on the call
669.28s: side it's just hanging out these will
671.48s: come down soon enough though because
673.44s: they're showing a a a pretty decent
675.52s: profit and now the main question is when
677.80s: do we add more shares and it looks like
681.08s: it's coming up on time so what I do now
683.68s: is I set different alerts on where I
686.12s: might want to start nibbling with shares
687.96s: to start using some more of the overall
690.40s: utilization based on where the perceived
692.96s: floor is right now which is again about
695.08s: 262 so with that as the case if it
698.44s: starts to channel in here sideways or if
700.56s: it starts to appreciate in here over the
702.36s: next day or two then we will look to add
704.36s: some more shares right now it's just a
706.08s: little too early these three days boded
709.04s: well so we're coming up on the decision
710.68s: Point again probably tomorrow the next
712.48s: day we're we're right on top of when I
715.32s: would want to see if this is looking
716.72s: like it's going to fall through down
718.04s: further to which I would would wait
719.76s: until it consolidates but right now it
721.52s: is consolidating so again probably
723.64s: tomorrow the next day the decision will
725.32s: be made on adding some more shares if I
727.24s: do add some more shares it'll be a
728.48s: relatively light
730.48s: allocation and that's simply because we
733.24s: are running out of capital right now we
734.92s: only have you know a little over 25% of
737.40s: the capital remaining and I definitely
739.60s: don't want to go over 85% utilized
742.60s: that's just in case there's some sort of
744.52s: really big down move maybe 90% maybe 90%
747.60s: we'll give it 90% but for this kind of
750.40s: strategy it's really important to keep
751.68s: some cash on the side to be able to add
753.52s: to things if puts get stuck and we need
755.60s: to add some size and stuff like that so
758.36s: leaving about actually looking at the
759.88s: size of the underlying 10K is about
761.64s: right to leave that'll allow me to add a
763.88s: few Lots if I need to not really
766.52s: expecting to have to do a whole bunch of
767.88s: that but that's more just from a options
770.60s: management perspec so as always let me
773.64s: know if there's any questions anything I
774.92s: should look at be an outlier I'll see
776.56s: youall later
