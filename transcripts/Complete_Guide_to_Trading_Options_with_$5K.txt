0.12s: what's up outliers let's talk about
1.80s: trading options with a $5,000 account
4.28s: this is a really tricky video because
7.60s: you're going to see a lot of the issues
10.40s: with this now I started with a small
12.08s: account most of us do but the problem is
14.44s: most of us start not knowing what we
16.64s: don't know and I just wrapped up my 18th
19.04s: year of trading and looking back over my
21.60s: trading career thus far I realize how
24.48s: much risk there is in this process right
26.96s: here so the goal of this video is to
28.44s: give you an orientation a framework on
31.76s: how to think about trading options with
34.00s: a $5,000 account so that you have
35.96s: something to show for it at the end
40.16s: let's start first with a quick overview
42.40s: so why do we trade options they're
44.96s: highly adaptable that means that you can
49.24s: build positions to represent every
52.68s: permutation of what your idea is compare
56.04s: that to equities you can buy stock you
57.84s: think it's going to go up it's
59.20s: essentially going to move dollar for
60.52s: dollar with the underlying and that's it
61.92s: you just buy it it goes up you hope you
63.72s: make money if it goes down you lose
65.12s: money a one toone ratio options are
67.12s: different you can trade options that pay
70.44s: you out a lot of money on a little bit
73.08s: of movement you can trade options that
76.00s: make money if the market goes sideways
78.52s: it's completely different so because of
81.28s: that they offer a lot of opportunity
83.84s: options are also really efficient
86.40s: because they provide leverage even if
88.56s: you're selling options Maybe a cash
90.32s: secured put so you're setting aside
92.32s: money that would be tied to an open
95.12s: trade you still earn interest on that
97.28s: money that's tied to an open trade
99.20s: that's also earning you a return so the
102.68s: overall leverage provided combined with
105.00s: the liquidity that it can give you is
107.40s: really attractive and the last thing
110.20s: that options do is allow you to truly
113.76s: isolate profit mechanisms and if you're
115.64s: unfamiliar with this concept I'll throw
117.08s: a link in the description below that
118.92s: talks about profit me Mech isms but the
121.80s: concept here is if I think a stock is
124.40s: going to go up a lot I can build a
127.24s: specific trade for that if I think a
129.68s: stock is going to go sideways and I want
132.36s: to trade volatility by itself and remove
135.96s: my exposure to the underlying stock
138.28s: movement I can do that you cannot do
141.72s: those kinds of Trades with equities it's
144.28s: just a limitation of the Securities
146.28s: themselves options grant you that so one
148.60s: of the things you'll notice as I'm
150.32s: talking about this stuff is options are
152.92s: complex this is part of the challenge
155.60s: these first two points are probably the
158.64s: biggest issues that all new options
160.92s: Traders will face they are really
163.52s: complex and they take a lot of time to
165.88s: learn but there is a extremely low
170.80s: barrier to entry what that means is
173.12s: anybody can be an options Trader all you
175.52s: need to do is go to a place like Robin
178.24s: Hood sign up they have an app and now
180.76s: you're an options Trader think of
182.68s: anything else that requires a lot of
185.56s: skill anything else normally there's
188.76s: education there's exercises there's
192.28s: projects there's tests there's
195.24s: certifying exams before you can actually
198.16s: do the skill set that's not the case for
200.28s: options and trading is no less complex
204.24s: than a lot of those other things there's
206.16s: just not that barrier to entry which is
207.72s: really confusing to people couple that
210.28s: with Point number three which is there
213.00s: is a massive lagged feedback mechanism
216.60s: so if I'm playing basketball and I shoot
219.32s: a ball when I shoot the ball I get
222.20s: immediate feedback did it go in the hoop
225.84s: or did it not immediate feedback and
228.88s: based on the outcome in the hoop or not
232.00s: I can then conduct a self-analysis was
235.04s: my elbow tucked in as it should be was
237.36s: my forearm straight up was I jumping too
240.00s: much at an angle instead of vertical I
242.36s: can think about all these little things
244.24s: that I have to get right in order to
246.64s: have a good jump shot but trading is
249.36s: different you can be trading a really
251.92s: good strategy and go through a long
254.12s: losing Stak just because of the sequence
257.56s: of returns this is called path or you
260.08s: could be do something completely wrong
262.64s: abysmally wrong but you can make money
265.08s: so then you're being positively
266.80s: conditioned to think you're doing
267.76s: something right even though you're being
270.16s: tricked again through this idea of path
273.56s: so not only are you dealing with
275.32s: something that's really complex there's
277.44s: no certification before you can start or
279.80s: anything to vet your understanding and
282.12s: it looks like it's really easy to do
284.04s: because of slick internet marketing by
286.20s: people trying to take advantage of you
287.92s: couple that with the fact that there's
290.12s: drastically lagged feedback in the
292.88s: systems that's a recipe for disaster
295.04s: within the first three we got three more
296.80s: to go the next thing about trading that
298.76s: makes it so difficult is you have to
300.76s: wear a lot of hats you have to be risk
303.32s: taker the person putting on the trade
305.40s: you have to be risk manager to make sure
307.72s: that the trades make sense and if you
309.36s: look at something like an investment
310.60s: bank they literally have entire entities
313.04s: designed to these different tasks they
315.48s: have researchers that are designed to
317.60s: come up with the ideas and then the
319.08s: traders that are meant to execute them
320.64s: and then a risk management desk that
322.36s: makes sure that what all the Traders are
323.84s: doing Mak sense together you have to do
325.92s: all of that and you have to be super
328.12s: self-aware you essentially have to be
329.68s: your own psychologist to identify all of
332.04s: the small little quirks we all have as
334.08s: humans so add that onto the bucket then
336.96s: going back to that really slick internet
338.96s: marketing stuff like this these kinds of
342.44s: things are so dangerous now I'm in an
344.48s: incognito tab on Chrome so it's not
347.08s: skewed by anything that I typically
348.96s: would look at and after scrolling a
350.64s: little bit and this is no dig at any of
352.80s: these people I'm just talking about the
354.48s: marketing which is this options trading
357.20s: in 10 minutes how to make $1,000 day at
359.96s: 19 for beginners what does that Prime
362.28s: you to do mentally right that's
364.40s: completely tricking you the next thing
367.52s: $4,000 in 10 minutes not saying that
370.36s: this person did or didn't make $4,000 in
372.28s: 10 minutes it's absolutely possible and
374.36s: doable for sure but for new Traders
377.04s: especially with small accounts this sets
379.16s: you up for the entire wrong mindset
382.52s: coming into this thing going all the way
384.44s: back to this we think we're going to
386.12s: turn a small amount of money into a
387.56s: bunch of money and then the last thing
389.24s: lack structure anybody that follows my
391.60s: work you know that I am an evangelist
394.60s: for things like trading plans trading
396.72s: logs I'll even throw a video about them
399.16s: below but we're trading things that are
401.40s: really complex that have lagged feedback
404.20s: that there's a really misleading low
407.60s: barrier to entry so we think it's going
409.20s: to be much easier than it is there's a
411.28s: lot of different tasks we have to
413.00s: perform most people don't track anything
415.52s: they do and then they're wondering why
417.32s: it doesn't work you have to track what
419.68s: you're doing otherwise how on Earth
422.72s: would you think that this is going to
424.16s: work again it's because you're primed in
426.92s: a really unhealthy Way by people trying
429.60s: to essentially just bait your eyeballs
431.80s: to get you to click on stuff for their
433.80s: own growth and it's unfortunate but it's
435.88s: the reality let's take a look at a
438.44s: couple studies and I recommend you check
440.68s: these out so this one is about the
443.60s: performance of different kinds of
444.68s: options Traders this one talks about
446.36s: retail options trading this one talks
448.24s: about risk premium
450.08s: in the markets the reason why these
451.64s: studies are relevant to you is because
453.64s: if you want to be an options Trader you
457.28s: have to understand the place that you're
459.52s: operating you have to understand the
461.04s: tools you have to understand the
462.32s: landscape it's the same thing as going
464.16s: back to the basketball example if you
465.56s: want to be a basketball player you have
466.52s: to understand the positions you have to
468.28s: understand different plays you have to
469.60s: understand offense and defense you have
471.20s: to understand positioning all of those
472.76s: things apply here again the difference
474.80s: is is nobody's going to tell you any of
476.52s: it you have to figure it out because
478.24s: it's all on you you are a one man or
482.44s: woman banned out there doing it all by
484.72s: yourself you don't have a coach that's
486.48s: telling you do this do that it's you you
488.92s: are the coach you're also the player
491.12s: that is what makes it so tricky okay so
493.40s: now that we understand trading options
495.88s: is tricky that is just the nature of
497.96s: this thing I now want to talk about some
500.16s: goals for a small account what are
502.92s: things to focus on that are a good use
505.52s: of your time the first one is to focus
507.60s: on saving I know this isn't about
509.52s: trading at all here's the reality the
511.68s: probability of you turning a $5,000
514.92s: account into your future wealth is about
517.64s: zero it's not zero it could be done but
521.20s: the probability of that happening is
523.76s: really freaking low so in the beginning
526.36s: with small accounts you have to focus on
529.08s: saving because let me show you something
531.96s: if we take a look at two accounts as an
533.72s: example we have a $5,000 account and a
535.48s: $5 million account if we save $1,000
538.88s: that $5 $1,000 account just grew by
542.00s: 20% just by Saving $11,000 with a small
545.84s: account your savings have an
548.80s: outstanding impact on your overall
551.48s: principle on a $5 million account you
553.92s: save that same, you just grew by
556.88s: 0.02% what ends up happening is when
559.12s: your account gets bigger and bigger your
561.76s: returns start to matter more than your
564.52s: savings with a small account it's the
567.04s: inverse your savings will matter so much
571.44s: more than your returns when you compare
574.08s: these on a return basis if you get a 10%
577.48s: return on this $5,000 account you get
580.36s: 500 bucks you get a 10% return on a $5
582.92s: million account you have $500,000 same
585.56s: return notice how different that is in
587.20s: the beginning small accounts must save
589.52s: towards the end when you have a more
590.80s: developed account your return matters so
593.68s: much more just keep that in mind so we
596.24s: have to save all right that stuff aside
598.04s: let's actually talk about this the next
600.20s: thing is I already explained that this
601.56s: is kind of difficult this is not easy
603.44s: it's not what it's made out to be it's
604.72s: going to take a lot of effort just like
606.12s: getting good at anything else you have a
608.04s: choice either do it or don't do it what
610.16s: does not work well is kind of
611.68s: half-assing it seeing if like maybe
613.56s: you're the next Savant that's just going
615.48s: to pick it up and be supremely good at
617.08s: trading it could happen but it's
618.80s: unlikely so you either make the choice
621.76s: to do it and you accept that it's going
623.80s: to be a lot of work it's going to be
624.84s: frustrating it's going to take a lot of
626.04s: time and effort to learn this thing and
628.44s: that's great because is trading in my
630.36s: opinion is entirely worth it but what
632.96s: will screw you up the most is if you go
635.24s: into it half ass you trade a little bit
637.60s: you start losing a bunch of money that
639.24s: could have been compounding in a Buy and
641.68s: Hold index ETF that works well for most
644.20s: people long term it's just a waste of
646.28s: time and you'll have little to show for
647.60s: it so either commit or don't this isn't
651.24s: something to kind of do kind of not make
653.80s: the choice your first goal is to learn
656.96s: options notice how I don't say your
659.52s: first goal is to return 10% 5% 20% 50%
663.28s: that's not your goal you don't even get
664.48s: to have that goal yet because you have
666.00s: to learn the skill set the only way you
668.48s: can learn the skill set is if you focus
670.16s: on learning versus the returns you need
672.64s: to build an approach that's part of
675.04s: learning we're going to prioritize the
678.36s: process of trading because again going
681.24s: back to this example if we have that 10%
685.08s: return 10% on $5,000 is very unappealing
689.64s: 500 bucks who really cares but if you're
692.80s: able to maintain a 10% return every
696.00s: single year without missing a single
697.60s: year that all of a sudden becomes really
700.04s: meaningful when you're able to give
702.28s: yourself half a million dollars after
705.12s: you continue to save really aggressively
707.52s: don't have any losing years and scale
710.36s: really effectively so that's why we care
713.20s: about prioritizing the processes because
715.08s: again when you're trading a $5,000
716.72s: account it's not about the $5,000 you're
718.88s: learning next up you got to track your
720.84s: work we already talked about that this
722.24s: is a great time to test ideas both via
724.44s: paper trading and live trading you want
726.56s: to limit draw Downs draw Downs are going
729.36s: to happen but with small accounts
731.40s: they're a killer because they require a
733.64s: much larger percent to get back to break
737.28s: even if you pop over to my website I
740.04s: have a display built for this it's under
742.20s: resources and down here under volatility
744.32s: Decay and loss recovery chart if you
745.92s: take a look at the loss recovery chart
747.72s: if you with your 5 ,000 account if you
750.40s: draw it down by 25% you now need a 33.3%
754.88s: return to get back to break even you've
757.20s: made Z in this case you've actually
759.00s: still would have lost money once you
760.72s: include friction meaning fees but what
763.44s: I'm showing you is that the more you
764.68s: draw down the bigger return you need to
767.60s: literally get back to break even you
770.44s: have to avoid that and again going back
772.64s: to exhibit a we're not trying to grow
774.60s: this into our future wealth we're trying
776.20s: to build a s skill set that's
778.12s: sustainable that when coupled with
780.72s: aggressively saving growing our income
783.28s: will yield future wealth last thing
786.08s: focus on learning already belabored that
788.24s: point enough all right let's now talk
790.84s: about some strategies the first thing is
793.04s: you do need to outline profit mechanisms
795.00s: again you can check out that video below
796.80s: but this is just to clearly identify
799.44s: what you're trying to trade are you
800.48s: going to try to trade directionally are
801.96s: you going to try to trade long-term
803.28s: strategy short-term strategies value
805.24s: it's all up to you but you have to
806.56s: Define it and have a sense of what
809.24s: you're trying to do risk management is
810.88s: going to be super important the way that
812.32s: we avoid those draw Downs is by managing
814.92s: risk and there are a few things you can
816.68s: do to completely revolutionize your
818.84s: trading in a few simple steps it sounds
821.60s: gimmicky but it is the absolute honest
823.84s: truth I'll throw a link in the notes
825.80s: below about a few simple things you
827.80s: could do but one of them is every single
830.84s: trade from now on forever before you
833.32s: enter you define your exit points before
837.24s: you enter so for a 5,000 account you're
839.84s: not truly going to be oversized you
841.40s: can't avoid it but we don't want to have
843.48s: a 10% draw down on an individual
845.84s: position that's just too much money so
848.72s: you can think about things maybe 5% draw
851.28s: down and even that for a developed
853.32s: account for a big account that's a lot
854.92s: on a seven figure account you're way
856.76s: more looking at typically things like
858.88s: half a percent to maybe 2% it obviously
861.60s: depends on your approach and your
862.84s: strategy but you have to balance it with
865.48s: expected return allocation and
867.12s: utilization this is a way that I think
869.12s: think about using a portfolio again I'll
871.20s: throw a link to this in the notes below
873.48s: allocation is how much money you're
875.20s: going to use at a given point in time
876.92s: for a strategy and utilization is how
878.80s: much you're actually using at a given
880.28s: point in time with a $5,000 account you
882.76s: have to be very very cautious with this
885.32s: because you're going to have to
886.12s: essentially use most of the portfolio
887.96s: almost all the time but you have to pay
890.88s: close attention to the portfolio
892.16s: structure what that means is we don't
893.80s: want a bunch of Trades that are
895.40s: mirroring one of another so let's say if
897.36s: you're able to put on five trades that
899.24s: are at $1,000 Capital utilization each
902.52s: well if they all behave as the same
905.00s: thing maybe they're all in Tech well if
907.20s: tech goes down your portfolio structure
909.52s: is trash you have no diversification
911.96s: within them and your probability of
913.84s: blowing up is Big we have to balance our
916.92s: return expectations for smaller accounts
919.52s: it's typically best to focus on percents
922.04s: the reason again for this is going off
924.36s: of what I showed you here uh 10% return
928.28s: is pretty solid
929.68s: the $500 is Trivial that's not exciting
932.24s: so focusing on the percent return is a
933.96s: little bit better when you have a bigger
935.60s: account we generally use both but
938.68s: focusing on the dollar amount starts to
940.24s: make more sense because it's less about
941.88s: what the percent is and it's more about
943.80s: how much income do I get what what am I
945.96s: spending this month or this year and how
947.72s: much am I putting back so we EB and flow
950.60s: between these but just for your context
952.96s: picker selection is going to be
954.32s: challenging one of the things that I do
956.96s: is use scanners so in this example I'm
960.04s: using bar chart and you can go in and
962.48s: limit your tickers I'm using things that
964.52s: are optionable that have gone up over a
966.68s: time frame but they're trading at $15 or
969.52s: less the reason being is because I want
971.64s: to be able to put on a few trades if
974.32s: you're trading things that are too
975.52s: expensive you run out of choices
977.76s: strategies vertical spreads ratio
980.48s: diagonals coverage strangles and single
982.84s: options single options kind of bubbles
985.36s: up under ratio diagonals let's first
987.84s: start with verticals we're going to go
990.04s: over to the platform and let's say after
993.20s: going through a scan you come across
995.56s: SoundHound and you're like oh I think
997.56s: that this is interesting they're getting
999.00s: involved in AI I think there's a future
1001.16s: here now it's rolling over right now but
1002.92s: let's just use it for an example it's uh
1005.16s: $18 stock the first thing you could do
1007.60s: is trade verticals you can go long or
1011.32s: short them depending on what you want
1013.00s: I'm not a big fan of verticals but we
1014.44s: can look at one so let's say you think
1016.36s: it's going to go up so we're going to
1018.12s: look at selling a put vertical so it's a
1021.08s: dollar wide why does this matter well
1023.12s: verticals give you access to a lot more
1025.68s: tickers that are more expensive and it's
1027.72s: because the width of the spread becomes
1031.84s: how much money you need essentially so
1034.36s: in this case you stand to make what $59
1037.84s: risking 41 that's actually really good
1040.00s: typically it's going to be way less than
1041.32s: that but this can give you access to
1044.40s: much more expensive tickers because
1046.56s: again you determine the risk by the
1049.60s: width of the spread so let's use Apple
1052.08s: for an example and if we come in here we
1055.84s: take a look at the same 45 DTE and these
1059.36s: are automatically $5 wide but let's take
1061.48s: a look because it's a $242 stock if we
1065.64s: put on a single $5 widespread in here
1068.88s: let's get rid of this old example you're
1071.04s: risking 365 that falls closer to our
1075.12s: risk profile again that's a little too
1076.72s: high we don't want to be at 10% almost
1079.40s: we want to be closer to 5% at the max
1082.16s: but just showing you that using a
1084.28s: vertical can get you into much more
1085.92s: expensive underlyings the way I think
1087.88s: about verticals is that they are a way
1089.92s: to learn that's not really the strategy
1092.84s: I would try to use longer term the ideal
1096.68s: strategy that I used when I did a small
1099.04s: stack segment not too long ago using a
1101.44s: $5,000 account was ratio called
1103.52s: diagonals I'll throw a link to those in
1106.60s: the notes below but this is where we go
1108.92s: out I would probably use something like
1110.40s: a 90day diagonal and it would be
1113.36s: actively managed and I'm using the long
1117.32s: option as the equity and you can see
1121.88s: that this trade takes 485 the thing is
1124.88s: I'm not going to risk all of that I'm
1127.08s: going to plan to manage this trade what
1129.12s: I mean by that is I'm going to apply my
1131.28s: technical analysis and I'm going to say
1132.96s: okay well if SoundHound drops below 1685
1136.80s: I'm wrong means it's continued to go
1139.00s: down too far and I wouldn't want to get
1141.24s: in it and just for an admin no I
1143.08s: wouldn't get in here I'd wait until it
1144.48s: bases but let's say maybe I had gotten
1146.68s: in here or something so what I'm going
1148.56s: to do is I'm going to see what my risk
1150.24s: is here so let's just call the risk at
1152.24s: 17 if we go in here and we take a look
1154.56s: at $17 my risk is about 55 bucks that's
1158.88s: well within my risk tolerance I actually
1161.32s: can put another one of these on now this
1163.44s: is the difference between allocation
1165.24s: utilization here because in order to buy
1167.72s: these two I'm going to to use
1169.96s: $970 so I'm using a fifth of the
1172.40s: portfolio putting on this one trade but
1174.24s: in terms of actual risk I'm risking
1176.72s: about a 100 bucks that's well within
1178.96s: risk tolerance and then I can come in
1181.08s: and I can sell calls against it if I'm
1184.12s: inclined to try to offset some of the
1186.92s: Theta again you can check out the video
1188.60s: on diagonals you can trade ratio
1190.80s: diagonals both to the upside and to the
1193.28s: downside coverage strangles are really
1195.52s: difficult to do in here but they're
1196.92s: better suited for long longterm Holdings
1200.28s: but again with a $5,000 account in order
1202.48s: to trade the coverage jungle you have to
1203.96s: be able to buy more than 100 shares so
1206.28s: that means you're essentially going to
1207.32s: have to be trading5 six7 stock at the
1209.68s: most so you're going to be kind of stuck
1212.24s: and then the last one is long singles
1214.32s: which essentially again I would trade
1216.56s: them just like I trade the ratio
1218.04s: diagonals I just wouldn't add the short
1220.92s: leg element so this is trading options
1223.60s: with a $5,000 account it's doable it's
1225.92s: real tricky if you want to see a
1227.76s: follow-up video that goes through these
1229.60s: with actual examples for a 5k account
1231.88s: let me know we can do a followup if you
1233.68s: have any questions let me know be an
1234.88s: outlier I'll see you later
