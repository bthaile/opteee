0.00s: The Greeks in options trading,
2.16s: they're way more mysterious than they actually are.
5.12s: They're kind of like the instrument cluster to your car.
7.96s: It tells you details about the instrument that you're using.
12.08s: So for example, we have Delta,
13.96s: which tells us the rate of change of premium.
16.24s: And so on and so forth.
17.72s: So there's no inherent edge in understanding the Greeks.
22.56s: It's kind of like there's no inherent way to avoid an accident
27.56s: if you can read your instrument cluster.
30.76s: However, if you cannot read your instrument cluster,
33.92s: you might overheat your car and it might stop working for you.
37.52s: So the point is, you have to know the details,
40.84s: but it doesn't inherently lead to making profitable decisions.
44.88s: That still has to happen on its own.
46.92s: So take time to learn the Greeks
48.76s: because you're gonna need them to build your trades.
51.52s: But just remember that there's no one baked in edge to them.
54.76s: Be an outlier, see you later.
