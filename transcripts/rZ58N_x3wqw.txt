0.00s: Happy Friday, everybody. It's the 5th of July. And I want to talk through the
5.24s: expiration cycle for today. A lot of options came off. We can see a lot went back
11.76s: out over 200 and 39,000 calls transacted today, which is a heavy number
18.76s: compared to what we saw back on the 3rd of June, which it was actually starting
23.68s: to slow down for a couple days. And we definitely accelerated back up today
27.72s: being over 200,000 calls again. We did see puts also expand. We have 75,000
34.84s: puts traded today. Heavy, heavy, heavy callsque. No doubt about it in terms of
42.16s: transactions. Now, if we take a look at where the majority of these transactions
46.92s: occurred and calls notice 37% of the transaction today were at the bid or
54.80s: below. These are sales. These are people selling calls. Then the 29, those
59.28s: are people buying calls. If we look on the put side, most people came in slight
64.72s: edge by one point over the bid where 32% came in at the offer, those people
70.52s: buying puts. So this is expectation of downside by a very slight edge. And then
76.40s: this is not necessarily expectation of downside. This can be covered calls, but
81.04s: that still would benefit from a slight down move on the options perspective.
85.60s: Obviously, if you sell a covered call, you still want the underlying to go up.
89.84s: That's where Max profit in the trade lies. So let's take a look at what's going on here,
96.24s: quick recap of the week. Now, when we see what open interest is about to fall
102.80s: out of these, before today, well, before today's the volume is integrated into this,
109.04s: I should say, we had 894,000 calls against 526K puts. Now, if we go into this
116.88s: expiration of the five July, we're going to lose almost 200,000 calls. They're
120.96s: going to expire. They're going to be gone. And then on the put side, we're going to lose 84,000.
126.00s: So what's going to happen here is this essentially 900,000 calls is going to drop almost by 200K.
135.68s: So there's still going to be really heavy call, oh, I skew. But we're starting to move out
143.60s: obviously into the next cycles, 12 July, which I know right now has been sent into me a few times
150.00s: that that's apparently an expiration cycle to look out for based on the T 35 cycle.
155.60s: And it looks really quiet from an options perspective so far. We see 79,000 calls versus 40,000
163.76s: puts small, very small. Now, the reason why this matters is, I told you guys this a lot now,
170.16s: but it's important to reiterate, these non-standard expiration, the weeklies, especially in smaller
175.44s: products like GameStop are going to be slower. And it's because of liquidity, markets look for
181.76s: liquidity. So if we go out to the 19 July, I will bet you these will be much higher. And they are.
187.68s: These are at 256, triple six. Uh-oh, there's that number again. I guess it's quad six, so it doesn't
194.32s: really count. There goes that. No need to do any burning sage around here, I suppose.
200.56s: So we have 256,000 calls versus 141K on the put side in 19 July.
208.64s: We go out to 26 July. It's 45 to 15 to aug 15 to five.
215.36s: Nine aug is 1900 to 500 super quiet and nine aug and then 16 aug is the next one I really wanted
221.84s: to look at was 124 to 71. So we are maintaining call skew still. This is important to keep a close
228.96s: eye on because it's very telling in terms of how people are positioning going into the future,
236.00s: which is a big part of what we're trying to monitor here because if we look at GameStop and if we
240.72s: zoom in, let's do like a three-month daily, we have been sideways for almost in, oh, wrong thing.
247.76s: We've been sideways for a really long period of time here. So if we take kind of from there
253.76s: to there, it's really hard to see just because there's such a distortion here. I'm not using a
259.60s: log chart, but this will help a little bit. You can see that like we're essentially hovering 27
265.28s: to 23. It's just bouncing in between there. Slight decline through there again. I really don't
270.96s: believe much of standardized technical analysis with products like this because of how unique it is,
276.56s: but it is good to look at. All the moving averages are super compressed. I have a bunch of
282.96s: different moving averages. There's like a 714 21 50 200. I essentially do a visual MACD. I don't use
291.52s: the oscillator. I can just see it here and track the widths, but they're also compressed. They
295.52s: essentially look like one line. It's just heavy consolidation, supremely heavy consolidation.
301.52s: Going back now to the options though, what does this mean going forward? Well, it means a few things.
308.16s: The very first thing is we need to pay pretty close attention to where we're starting to see volume
314.24s: flowing in. So we can see that there's a lot of volume today. This is probably people trying to
319.12s: get out of positions and collect a few pennies to save what money they can. Notice all these
324.08s: blue dots. Those are for today's expiration. So if we kill that and we look at the next
329.92s: series of interesting expressions, now the blue dots are 12 July and that's kind of people are
335.20s: just moving out one week. That's what we're seeing. Everybody's trying to maintain as much
340.56s: sensitivity to the front expiration cycle because that's where the perception is of these really
345.44s: big moves happening, which right now it's generally quiet. Inplied volatility is high,
355.04s: but it's low on a relative basis. So what that means is if we take a look up here and we take a
360.00s: look at the IV by itself, it's at 127. The IV rank is all the way down at 23 and then the IV
367.76s: percentile is up at 73. If you're unfamiliar with IV rank versus percentile, IV percentile is
373.52s: less prone to skew whereas IV rank is very prone to skew. That's actually why IV rank looks so
381.12s: low compared to IV percentile. But for something like GameStop, implied volatility can fly off the
387.92s: handle any second. So even though IV percentile is still showing elevated here, I think it's because
395.20s: if we look back over the past year, it had such periods of supremely depressed volatility.
400.56s: So I actually think a better metric is to kind of use from like the third of May forward and
405.12s: project your volatility out of this, which would be a little bit more representative of kind of
411.36s: this near term paradigm that we're in with respect to volatility for GameStop.
417.36s: So when I look at this, I'm not seeing anything jumping out at me in terms of huge positions
424.40s: being built. I'm seeing lighter volume for these at the monies out in 16 August. I see in the 19
432.48s: July's a little bit of heavier volume here at the 25s here again at the 30s. So there's some
439.84s: standard buildout happening, but it's not to the same degree. We do see these super far out of
445.44s: the monies still seeing a lot of activity at the 125s. The thing with the 125s again to remember,
452.08s: we've had a couple conversations about this in the comments, which are really, really good to have,
456.72s: I think. There's a mix of reasons why these 125s go on, or the really far out of the money,
463.44s: so it's not unique to the 125s. It really boils down to a cheap position that can do a lot of
470.16s: different things for you. So some people speculate that the majority of this volume is coming from
475.28s: institutions, and I still don't see that. The reason being is because you can use these for
483.20s: kind of a locates synthetic. The problem with that theory is that there's very few instances
491.60s: that those locates are going to correspond in less than 10 lot contracts, which is the majority
497.68s: of what you see here. And then the argument I hear kind of in retort to that, which is a good
501.92s: argument is, well, couldn't they split up their orders? They can. The problem if they do that,
507.12s: and you're trying to fill something that's worth several tens of thousands of shares of
512.16s: GameStop with respect to locates, is this would have to essentially be a constant feed of less than
520.00s: 10 lots. It would have to be all day in order for them to put a position on, which also becomes
524.56s: detectable, right? Because we can then see, well, wow, there's been a lot of volume at specific
530.96s: strikes in a given day, you can pick up on those cues. And that's what this does down here. I can
536.72s: say, well, okay, there's obviously a big activity going on. And this is out in the 19 July
543.20s: at the 125's, but it's still only 10,830 volume. That's not insignificant, but that's still not
551.04s: going to clear a meaningful amount of locates if somebody is using it for that purpose. They would
557.20s: need a much larger position. So I'm not saying that that's not happening, but I don't think that's
563.76s: the only thing that's happening. As I look through this specifically, when I see all of these one
568.88s: lots, two lots, three lots, to me, a lot of these instances boil down to small retail traders,
577.04s: hoping to hit a big. These are, this is the quintessential purchasing behavior of retail traders.
582.80s: And there's a lot of studies on SSRN on this exact topic that you should check out because
588.56s: there's a certain tendency to look for cheap alternatives. And the people that are going out
594.80s: really short explorations, 12 July, 19 July going super far out of the money. Yeah, I mean,
600.64s: they're paying $9 for the option. But the overwhelming probability there is that it is going to
606.64s: vaporize over the next couple days. Now again, to steal man that perspective,
612.40s: if we do get the move in that time frame, those cheap options are going to fly off the handle.
618.16s: And they're going to be worth a ton of money. That's if it's a very different style to
623.52s: approaching than my personal take. And I will always remind you guys the way I look at things,
627.84s: the way I do things is not the only way. There's other ways to do this stuff. But I care about
633.60s: creating success over a long term time frame. I've this my 17th year of trading. And it's
639.76s: literally changed my life doing this stuff. And it's very cool to see people that find those
645.76s: one off positions that happen to take off into the stratosphere. That's really fun. But it's very
651.60s: similar to playing the lotto in being the winner of the lotto. That's a tough way to predicate your
657.20s: future wealth on being the winner of the lotto. That's why a lot of times when you'll see my
662.16s: positions on here and off here, I go to all different kinds of time frames. So now I'm out even
666.72s: further to the 105s. And the reason why I'm out here is because that's where I found liquidity for
671.44s: the options that I wanted, which were slightly in the money. It's just a different approach. And again,
675.76s: not saying mine's right or wrong. But the other thing you'll notice about why I'm at is volatility is
681.04s: quite a bit cheaper than some of these shorter slash midterm exploration cycles. But I'm getting a
686.40s: lot of deltas by going at slash in the money so that if there is a big move, yeah, I have a higher
691.52s: deductible and paying more upfront. But I will actually see a higher gross profit. So that's the way
698.56s: I'm looking at this. And I am trading all the small moves. When you see me do these different videos,
703.04s: this will be here. This will not be here. Sometimes I use the dummy account to not have any noise on
708.32s: here in terms of positions. But the point I'm trying to make here is that there's a lot of different
712.96s: ways to play it going super far out of the money is a style. It's a low probability trade. So
721.20s: you have to figure out what's right for you. I am absolutely keeping a really close eye. I actually
726.64s: just partnered with my friends over at unusual whales, which takes kind of that spreadsheet you've
733.04s: guys seen me do before. And it makes it a little easier. I still like being able to download the data
738.48s: to aggregate it and stuff like this. But this does let me comb through specific date ranges very
743.76s: quickly to look for interesting positions. So that part I enjoy and you can see essentially what
751.04s: I showed you in that platform. The majority of volume that we're seeing are at those even strikes
758.32s: the 2025 30s. And there's not a lot of massive dollar value trades. There are some. But none of these
768.80s: huge right? This is a pretty big trade. The 20s that are out in 16 of October. That's a $100,000
777.20s: position that starts to get a little bit of interesting. That's the kind of thing that I like to
781.28s: keep an eye on. Because as people are trying to build positions, this is kind of telling to see
786.56s: this style of activity. If it's persistent because $100,000 position is big, but it's also not
793.04s: crazy. So this is absolutely something that I want to keep an eye on until you notice this little
800.16s: thing right here. You see there's says multi leg. That matters to me. The reason why that matters
805.76s: to me is because if I'm looking for straight up positions that are gaining direct exposure,
811.04s: I don't want there to be multiple legs because they're looking to offset some of the risk of that
816.08s: position. So I'm typically looking for straight buys that really display conviction in the direction.
823.36s: So there's a little bit of support there for it, but there's nothing
828.48s: very interesting happening yet. That's what it boils down to. I continue to say this to you guys
832.64s: all the time. My hope is to share information as objectively as I can see it and let you guys
837.60s: come to your own conclusions. I'm not trying to pump anything up and I'm not trying to suppress
842.00s: anybody's hopes and dreams. I want you to have objective data to then make informed decision.
848.48s: So as always, if there's any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
