0.00s: Inverse lose name appears to be holding up.
4.56s: They say this market euphoria will be short-lived.
7.24s: They worked in the industry for two decades so far.
10.04s: I'm astonished the market movement over the last nine to ten sessions.
12.96s: We aren't getting rate cuts, tariffs are only paused, not canceled.
16.60s: And it looks like they're buying puts for a three to six months out, maybe even less.
20.96s: The point that I want to make here is if we take a look at price performance over that
25.48s: timeframe.
27.20s: This is the S&P 500 over the last six months and you can see the last month or so,
31.88s: it's essentially been going straight up.
34.80s: So if this person did buy puts, they're getting smashed right now.
38.60s: That doesn't mean that their puts wouldn't eventually be vindicated if the market crashes
43.16s: in the next five months based on their timeline.
47.16s: But they would have gone about it a really inefficient way.
51.12s: And this highlights two things.
52.96s: Looking in the industry, it really doesn't mean that you know what's going on any
57.28s: better than other people.
58.48s: It means that you might have more experienced more access information.
61.88s: But you'll see this all the time and it's why from the retail trading lens, you have
66.00s: to be so careful with the standard appeal to authority that people will use.
70.56s: And I'm not saying that that's what this person was doing.
72.56s: They're just saying that I look at this every day and they're surprised.
74.60s: And I don't blame them.
75.60s: I totally get that.
77.44s: The thing is is you, I find as a trader, if you learn to focus more on what the market
83.60s: is doing and less on what you think it should do, your way, way better off.
90.24s: Because if you see it's going up and you just decide to ride that momentum instead of
94.32s: fighting it because it's incredulous movement.
97.20s: And you think that it's not going to last, then ride it on the way up.
100.52s: And then when it starts flipping and going down with severity, ride it on the way down.
105.36s: By buying puts as it's going up because we just don't think that it should be going up,
110.80s: even though it is, we're stepping in front of the moving train.
114.40s: And even if we start to get that down move that they might be thinking, they have a ways to go
119.68s: to recoup the data that they overpaid for because implied volatility will be high on those puts.
126.72s: And then until they even get back to break even.
129.44s: So I simply try to look at what the market is doing and follow along with it to a degree.
136.48s: As it moves, I move.
138.16s: Being outlier, see you later.
