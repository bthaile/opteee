0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here and I'm back with my friend Tom Bassow.
6.76s: Although your name says Thomas, which is very formal, but it's good to have you back
9.92s: again.
10.92s: Welcome to the outlier podcast.
11.92s: It's great to have you on again.
12.92s: Thank you to be here.
15.84s: So this year, last year, it's been super busy and from a kind of macro level standpoint,
25.16s: it seems like the market is in this transition period, whether or not we hold here, move
31.26s: higher, hold here, start to collapse down.
33.68s: What are your thoughts on where we stand in the markets literally right now?
37.52s: Well, you're speaking of the stock market, no doubt.
40.48s: But you have to remember, I trade 26 futures markets.
43.68s: I trade anything.
44.96s: The metals, currencies, ag products, meats, and so on.
51.92s: So a lot of markets are going through transitions.
54.80s: I would say that earlier in the year, I saw a lot of commodity markets tending to do
63.28s: all right.
64.28s: They were starting to get the inflation thing going.
67.40s: There were some disruptions.
68.84s: There was some drought in the ag area.
72.00s: In the case of the stock market itself, you certainly had a really lousy last year and
77.12s: then you transition to this sort of, we're going to have a recession and we're going
84.72s: to, at the same time, the Fed is going to absolutely clamp down on inflation.
91.76s: So people didn't trust the rally.
97.36s: I think we could take a little side trip for the traders that were watching this down
101.48s: the road and say that this is a great example of why you shouldn't predict.
106.96s: You shouldn't try to guess what's going to happen because the vast majority of traders,
111.64s: I think, guessed that we were going to have either a recession and therefore the stock
116.96s: market will be weak or we're going to have the Fed just killing all the joy of higher
122.44s: interest rates.
125.24s: So they stood aside and just were absolutely convinced that this thing is not going to
130.88s: rally.
131.88s: I took the hedges off.
134.28s: I don't even remember now.
136.08s: January, February or something, a long, long time ago.
140.24s: And I've been unhedged and just almost fully invested the whole way doing very well
145.60s: in a great year so far.
149.16s: I didn't predict it.
152.24s: I mean, I would have said that I would have agreed with everybody's predictions, but
156.20s: from a trader's viewpoint, I don't worry about what I think the market's going to do.
161.32s: I look at the prices, it cuts through the indicator, hits my stops.
166.08s: I'm long, move the stops up when you can control your position sizes and risk and wash,
176.68s: wash rinse and repeat over and over again for the last 50 years.
182.48s: And so it becomes a bit as easy as breathing at this point, but I think that that's what
189.72s: I've seen now.
190.72s: And now we're getting to the point where I'm starting to see some cracks in the foundation.
197.72s: I'm seeing out of my nine strategies, one of them dedicates itself to being long or short
204.68s: NQ, which would be NASDAQ futures, either long or short.
210.00s: And it's the indicators I use there are nine day indicators.
214.72s: And so it's a little shorter term than a lot.
217.64s: My long term sector timing or my longer term futures trading is so I kind of call it sort
226.40s: of the intermediate term because I have one other program that I'm down in two to three
230.80s: year or two to three day time frame.
233.44s: But this nine day indicator is already going over to the to the downside.
237.88s: I'm short NQ futures.
240.32s: I've sold off.
241.28s: I was fully invested 30 out of 30 for at least a few days in the sector timing.
248.44s: So that's 30 different sectors, all stocks with one set right.
256.84s: Yeah, one bond fund is in there.
261.16s: So 29 stocks and one bond.
264.76s: And out of those now, we've backed off to 27 out of 30.
269.24s: So that's starting to go, you know, starting to sell itself off.
274.20s: And we're getting pretty close now that if you look at my head chart on enjoy the right
281.04s: dot world, my website on the hedge page, you'll see the stops on my new hedge going on,
288.88s: keep coming up higher and higher and the market keeps going lower and lower.
292.88s: And they look like they're going to come close to each other here in another few days
297.08s: or a week hard to say.
299.68s: So I'm keeping my eye on it because if that goes over, I'm now fully hedged.
305.32s: And I'll take off that amount of risk.
307.12s: So in that point, who knows, you know, things starts rolling downward and people get panicked
313.84s: and all these people who have now predicted that we're not going to have a recession
319.16s: and we're definitely going to have the South landing.
321.72s: And the Fed is not going to raise anymore.
325.20s: Might find themselves completely wrong again.
329.08s: And then scrambling to get out of the kitchen because it's too hot.
336.28s: Yeah. And it's interesting.
337.52s: The, you know, probabilistic outcome right now on futures shows another increase.
341.84s: And it's slowly starting to change for a while.
344.64s: It was no change and it's slowly starting to ratchet up for another increase.
348.80s: But you mentioned one thing on the bond funds, which are bond index that maybe want to ask you,
354.68s: what do you think about 30 year treasury yields right now?
357.68s: They had that giant pop.
360.76s: And I thought that was really interesting movement.
363.56s: Obviously, there's a little bit of impact coming on from the Fed and, you know, removing liquidity.
369.16s: But I'm curious, like, what do you make of that movement?
371.24s: Because essentially, you know, looking at the beginning of July, it was, you know,
377.80s: 3843 and now it's up at like 43.
381.00s: So it's a pretty meaningful move.
385.00s: Yeah, I would say bonds in general, though, have had, if you think about close to 40 years of the wind that they're back,
393.64s: going back to Reaganomics in 1980.
396.92s: And just recently in the last few years, with the inflation and the fighting inflation and the Fed increasing the rates and all that,
404.96s: bonds have had the wind in their face.
408.32s: And so the question is, where are we on the whole scheme of things?
413.16s: I don't see inflation going away anytime soon.
416.48s: Every a lot of people predicted sticky.
418.92s: My, I guess, elementary level economics brain tells me that we're probably going to be fighting inflation for some time.
429.36s: I don't think it'll ever get to, unless we get into like a depression or something,
434.40s: maybe it just collapses and we're all in that, then you're, you're going to want your 40 acres in the woods.
443.48s: But other than that type of scenario, I don't see in any normal times,
450.16s: interest rates going down a huge amount.
452.80s: I can see them going up more to fight inflation that we've continued to have and continues to seem sticky.
460.60s: So I think bonds are, I wouldn't want to have a lot of, a lot of money at them right now.
467.20s: I think the return to risk could be lousy.
470.40s: Right.
471.28s: And you bring up another point that's actually the note that I was jotting down.
474.36s: I'd love to get your perspective.
476.28s: The tightening cycle that we went through with the Fed is unprecedented.
480.60s: It's literally one of the first series that we've seen like that.
484.40s: And I am very curious.
488.56s: It's easy to say the Fed's stupid.
491.28s: The Fed doesn't know what they're doing.
492.64s: You know what I mean?
493.04s: Like I already just complains about the Fed, but like they're not dumb.
496.28s: They're doing the best they can with a lot of information.
498.84s: They're obviously arguably little late to the party.
503.60s: But when we're looking at the way that this continues forward,
508.52s: Powell has been very steady on the drumbeat of we're going to continue tightening
514.60s: until the job is done.
516.56s: How do you view that kind of phrasing against some of the early cracks we started
523.08s: to see in the banking sector?
525.48s: And then at what point would you imagine the Fed would say, I understand this is my silver bullet,
531.56s: but I'm breaking everything with it.
534.08s: When, when does that happen?
535.96s: And then what happens at that juncture?
538.80s: Yeah, I would also be a Fed basher.
541.76s: I think they waited too long to do anything.
544.12s: And I think that's partially political problem.
547.12s: They seem to be political animals more and more.
551.56s: They used to be independent back when I was a lot younger.
556.16s: Nowadays it seems as though they're just trying to always act in political fashions.
562.44s: And so they're too late to take action against inflation.
567.68s: And they're probably going to be too late or overdo it to the other side too.
572.00s: And they're going to be panicking when they start seeing some big banks go into trouble.
577.20s: And they're going to have to scramble and say, I don't know.
579.48s: I guess we ought to ease back a little bit.
581.28s: We've overdone it.
582.88s: And they'll probably be too late doing that too.
586.68s: They seem to be looking in the rear of the mirror as they drive.
590.80s: So I don't know.
594.08s: I think that I agree that he has been a Powell that has been very consistent with the message.
601.96s: And that's good because half of his job is convincing others that they're serious about whatever it is that they're trying to talk about.
610.96s: If he doesn't stay consistent with his message, he'll get ripped apart and probably replaced by somebody who can stay consistent to his message.
621.12s: Yeah, I just think got a tough job because they've painted themselves into the corner.
628.12s: They have allowed inflation to rear its ugly head.
634.12s: And at the same time, they have expanded their book to the point where they need to start backing off the book and sell that stuff.
645.12s: And when they sell stuff like that, they are taking money out of the money supply.
652.12s: And so that's sort of a double whammy.
656.60s: If they keep the industry high and are reducing the money supply, you're going to choke any chance that you would have to get the economy rolling.
665.64s: And growth of the economy in my mind is the only logical, super good way to lift all everybody's incomes across all sorts of sectors of the economy to have a growing economy.
683.64s: And what I see happening in Washington with Congress and the administration, along with what I see happening with the Fed, all speaks to killing the growth in the economy.
694.64s: And that's not going to be a long term recipe for success.
698.64s: Sadly.
701.64s: And I'm kind of really curious about here is last week we had some, was it last week the week before we had some pretty good wage numbers come out.
710.64s: And then today we had CPI, PPI come out and CPI looked okay.
716.64s: It I have the same sensation as you do in terms of the overall assessment that I have, but I am surprised to see continued economic resilience thus far at least.
731.64s: What do you make of kind of the dichotomy between those two.
737.64s: Sort of momentum, I think, people get into habitual lifestyle and it takes some pain or some shock.
749.64s: Like, you know, take the stock market, for instance, and let's say people are used to just lately click and along and making 10 to 20 30%.
759.64s: And then we had to do a throw a October 19th, 1987 that I experienced firsthand as a money manager into the mix where stock market goes down by 23% or something in one day.
773.64s: And now you got circuit breakers, I understand all that good stuff. But let's say it goes down 40% in, in what two weeks.
784.64s: And would that shock the world? Yeah, it would. Would it probably change people's plans, you know, instead of buying that second home, maybe we just hunkered down now.
795.64s: And everything just kind of let's get a little bit closer to home, let's make sure our families okay, let's not take that extravagant vacation to Europe.
805.64s: And then suddenly, you know, you know, you know, you know, we can be doing this in the same room.
815.64s: And if we wanted to, we could be doing this live on like a Twitter live feed or something.
834.64s: And then we had a couple of Saturdays ago, I was on an interview session where I think he said there was something like 10,000 people signed up for it all around the world.
846.64s: Crazy. And so you get that word out and panic starts to spread.
853.64s: And look out, it could happen. Just like a wildfire in the wind.
858.64s: Right. How do you think about your positioning here? For me, very similar to you, I've been like quite utilized most of the year. But when we come into times like this, especially over the last month, I've been pretty selective.
873.64s: I still have risk out, I'll continue to maintain risk out, but I don't know the way you think about rotating your risk or is it just rotating in between your different strategies here.
885.64s: No, what I already preset all of the commitment, each of the nine strategies. Then what I do to control the risk on an ongoing basis is to control the exposure to risk and volatility.
899.64s: By way, my position sizing covered in my position sizing books, successful traders size their positions, why and how.
908.64s: The actual formulas are in there. It's easy to use. I don't think twice about it. And then I just keep in times where it seems to be transitional like this. If you think about it, I built a larger and larger risk structures because of the profits, the profitable moves that I've been in.
926.64s: So as those get over a certain level and it's different for every single strategy and different for every all sorts of different markets, but each specific strategy has its own level of allowable risk.
941.64s: I would take an example of in my futures trading, I would have like a half a percent risk to get into the position. And I would allow each position to grow to be 1% of my portfolio risk as long as that was due to profits.
956.64s: And my stop is struggling to keep up with how fast I'm making money. So then what I do is as soon as it gets to 1% or higher, I peel off, however many positions and futures that I need to to get back down to 1% allowable.
972.64s: So as markets like what we've experienced this year have come along, I've just been reducing position sizes. Now that solves part of the problem.
982.64s: The second part of the problem is solved in my mind or at least it's addressed by continuing to have movable trailing stops that are large logical.
994.64s: I'm giving the market enough room and if the market becomes more volatile, I give it plenty of space. I use things like ATR average true range to try to measure the volatility and keep my stops at least a volatility or sometimes two times volatility away from
1011.64s: where the market is. And that is usually sufficient to stay out of the noise. But as the market keeps rolling along like it has been, I keep moving those stops up. So I'm moving the stops up, I'm peeling positions off.
1026.64s: I'm always getting ready and I've those stops. So in many cases are stopping reverse as soon as those stops are yet. I'm now short.
1034.64s: Well, as you have nine strategies and some like NQ futures now are already short, but I'm 27 out of 30 long on my sector timing.
1045.64s: I'm starting to get a mixed bag. So it transitions myself automatically and I don't even have to think about it.
1052.64s: And it sounds like the beauty there too, obviously, is by having those kind of balanced deltas, obviously you're managing the size and whatnot. It's still it stays true to your roots, right? You're you're making sure that you have some protection against systematic risk.
1070.64s: Yeah, when you think about whenever this unwind comes from the Fed, what trading themes come to mind for you when that inevitably does occur?
1086.64s: Well, you're talking the interest rates staying. I wouldn't say bonds would be a great place unless you're just trying to find a place to park cash. I would keep it on short term bonds, not long term.
1101.64s: If anything, one year or less maturity in my mind, what themes come to mind?
1111.64s: Well, one thing that strikes me that's been decent and could get exciting if it broke out would be the crypto futures could be an interesting game to play because there's no really limit on how much they could move and they've been very volatile and volatile instruments tend to be a trader's best friend because after all we all have to buy and we have to sell.
1135.64s: And the farther and faster something moves, the more profitable it can be if you're on the right side of it. So I'd be watching those markets for starters.
1144.64s: I like silver. It seems to move quickly.
1148.64s: And if we have a situation where inflation is persistent, perhaps that could have a move right now. It's not. It's on downside.
1156.64s: But it could perk up and people who get excited about that, especially if the stock market was selling off and people thought, all right, the world's going to an end. I better buy gold now or something.
1167.64s: That might be another play. Energy seems to be the way I'm trading, unleaded gas. I'm trading natural gas futures and I'm trading many crude oil futures.
1181.64s: And all three of those look like they have the potential to be headed upward now. And they.
1192.64s: I could see where if we have an inflationary environment, you got the price of the commodities products, the energy products could easily go up against the dollar.
1206.64s: Going down inflation, reducing the value of the dollar.
1212.64s: The only thing that there's the caveat there is you can have a.
1217.64s: If you do get a recession, you get a slow down the economy that all of a sudden people don't need oil.
1222.64s: During COVID, oil got to a negative price.
1226.64s: Because there was nobody using the stuff.
1228.64s: I didn't want to throw it out of storage. So it became a problem.
1233.64s: And for a few days, it actually went negative on the future. So those are some areas to watch.
1240.64s: You know, as usual, what I do is I just have my indicators already onto those markets and they start caving in and going south, I'm short.
1249.64s: And if they continue on the upside, I continue to be long to move my stops, control my position sizes. It's like a broken record.
1258.64s: I'm not doing anything today different than what I did during say the COVID crash or the COVID recovery or, you know, the markets in 2019.
1269.64s: I do the same thing every day.
1272.64s: Do you create like a broad market thesis as a backdrop and then look at the individual sectors? Or is it just specific to each individual sector?
1282.64s: I kind of get a broad market.
1285.64s: Read a little bit by how the different time frames on measuring the stock market.
1290.64s: In some of the strategies and how I end up longer short, you know, I can see situations where right now.
1297.64s: And the next day, I'm going to be talking about the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the next day, the
1327.64s: happy or glad days, the happy and glad 13 days, the happyíamos that 14 days, the happy
1329.84s: times for surely smaller than 20 days, getting省ed for someone, there's a budget and loans, there's a budget, a budget and those
1332.54s: that you imagine, 1 day compared now and the big e Boiong Engels, there's a budget and a budget that you need to pay for.
1343.96s: It is a budget that dreams about how you treat yourself with someham скор along without it even being a
1345.94s: budget and that's a budget that dreams about how you treat yourself with someham скор along without you being a budget.
1348.34s: three different indicators. It'd be a calculator,
1351.30s: dungeon, and bollinger, and I would use 21 days
1355.94s: and 2.3 times the calculator, 2.0 times the bollinger,
1362.94s: and just this straight 21 days dungeon
1366.78s: to give me my upside, buy signal for my sectors.
1371.38s: And then I, because the stock market is upwardly biased
1375.74s: over the very long term due to inflation
1378.74s: and declining value of the dollar and everything
1381.14s: in my opinion, I use a 50 day indicator to get out,
1386.54s: same indicators.
1388.54s: So I just changed the 21 to 50, and I run it that way.
1394.14s: So I lean towards the upside more than I lean towards the downside,
1398.34s: but if it's a bad bear market, I want to get out of this stuff.
1403.14s: Right. And then you, even those indicators themselves,
1406.94s: right, they integrate a lot of volatility to them.
1408.94s: Do you isolate and trade volatility itself as well?
1411.94s: Nope.
1412.94s: Got it.
1414.34s: Just through the products.
1415.74s: All of those indicators and everything I do
1418.94s: has an aspect of volatility to it.
1421.54s: And I try to control that because I don't want my portfolio
1425.14s: and retirement, keeping me up at night.
1427.94s: So I try to be careful on how much exposure
1430.94s: I have to volatility and to risk.
1434.34s: So that's, I think, part of the reason
1436.94s: for my consistency over what, 50 years of trading now,
1442.94s: I think you have to be able to maintain that
1445.94s: and have the mental.
1446.94s: You either have to be, you know, have a lead line stomach
1452.34s: and a real, real need for excitement and stress
1459.34s: to leverage yourself and to be put in the high risk situations
1463.94s: and try to make as much money as you possibly can
1466.94s: and be stressed out all the time.
1469.14s: But if you're going to be Mr. Serenity,
1471.14s: you have to, you have to control your risk of volatility,
1476.54s: you have to make sure you're very diversified.
1478.94s: And any one day, I mean, I never have all 50 to 60 positions
1484.74s: going in my favor or against me.
1486.94s: It's always a mixed bag.
1488.54s: And I'm just looking to try to make that, that total number
1492.94s: when the portfolio is all added up green as many days as I can.
1497.34s: I run, I keep track of the last running a year on a spreadsheet
1502.34s: every afternoon.
1503.14s: I'm running about 51% of the days I have profitability.
1508.94s: Got it.
1509.74s: That's more than I have.
1511.34s: If I can make my days that are profitable larger
1514.34s: than my negative days and I'm running over 50% profitable days,
1519.34s: you know, that's, I think you're airing on the correct side
1523.94s: and it keeps life pretty simple and easy.
1526.94s: It seems like the Mr. Serenity theme would apply pretty cleanly there.
1531.54s: Yeah.
1532.54s: Another thing I wanted to ask you is when it came to your hedging,
1535.94s: do you with a book of 50, 60 positions, whatever it is?
1539.54s: Do you prefer to hedge in the individual positions
1542.34s: or do you apply some sort of broader portfolio hedge against like weighted?
1547.34s: Yeah, what I do there is I'll take the, my largest exposure long term
1551.74s: on the equity market would be the sector, I use sector ETFs.
1555.34s: And I do that simply because, I mean, I could obviously go out and buy
1560.54s: the Amazon's and the Metas and all that and deal with it.
1563.74s: But what I'm seeing in my later years here, the last say,
1568.04s: five or 10 is you're seeing, you're seeing individual securities have just an earnings announcement
1576.94s: or you know, it could be lukewarm or their, their prediction for the next quarter
1582.44s: isn't as, as, abumant as it was the quarter before or something.
1587.84s: And all of a sudden, boom, down 17% on the open, it's insane.
1593.44s: Now, some of these issues have lots of volume.
1596.24s: I could get in and out and I could try to diversify that away by running some automated strategies
1604.14s: in the stock area.
1605.64s: And let's say I had a 50 stock portfolio, well, then I could diminish some of that corporate rest
1611.14s: so that if a stock went down 20% on the open, it would only be one 50th of my portfolio
1618.34s: or something like that.
1620.14s: And I could deal with it and I could do that, but it just seems to me that if I instead want some tech stocks,
1627.44s: I could go do XLK as a spider.
1631.34s: It's the technology spider.
1633.44s: And now I own all of these stocks and I don't have that corporate risk anymore.
1637.64s: I just have an ETF that has a focus on technology.
1641.94s: I buy it when it breaks out to the upside and I sell it when it goes to the downside.
1646.14s: Now to answer your hedging question then.
1648.64s: If I have 20, excuse me, 30 different sectors of all these things that range from energy sectors
1654.64s: to even a junk bond sector, international, small cap, large caps,
1662.14s: agricultural, all sorts of different sectors, I can be longed or I can go to cash on all of those.
1670.64s: Well, as we start getting the stock market to cave in, the hedges go on.
1677.64s: What I'm doing there is I'm using an ES index broadly diversified index short to go against all these individual sectors long.
1692.64s: So what the way I do that is I look at what my exposure is the day I have to put the hedge on.
1698.64s: And let's say I'm now down to 21 out of 30 sectors.
1703.14s: I calculate what that exposure is and I put on a hedge that balances that and I'm essentially out of the market.
1710.64s: Got it.
1711.64s: Yeah.
1712.64s: Rather than do individual trades times 21, I can do one trade and get a pretty good clamping down on risk.
1720.64s: We just one trade. It's super simple.
1723.64s: Yeah, and that's actually the particular reason why I asked that question.
1727.14s: So I know a lot of people that listen to this, they tend to manage smaller books, right?
1730.14s: A lot of newer retail traders, they're probably 15 positions or less, but I think it's good for them to understand some of the tradeoffs that come when you can kind of create inherent diversification via all of the products you carry.
1743.14s: But like you said, if we wanted direct hedges, sure, they're slightly more accurate, but then you have to run through all of these products and hedge them individually.
1752.14s: Well, and you also have to be careful tax wise in the US.
1756.14s: If you hedge something directly, then you could get into strange situations where the IRS could say, and I'm not a tax expert.
1765.14s: So let's add that to sclaim or don't take this ask your own tax advisor to see if I'm correct.
1771.14s: But it seems to me that that becomes the equivalent of possibly selling your position now.
1777.14s: And then the IRS says, well, you know, you hedged it. So you had zero risk and no chance for anything other than zero risk.
1786.14s: So therefore we're going to say, you really sold that stock, even though you didn't.
1791.14s: And we want to our piece of the action.
1794.14s: In my case, I've got 21 sector funds or something 30, whatever I have it at the moment.
1804.14s: And then I got a short sale position in a standard course 500 futures. Those are completely different things. However, my analysis of how the stock market's been correlated over my lifetime.
1819.14s: If you looked at international stocks, all the stocks in the world, that's I.
1824.14s: And we're down when I first started in the business back in the late 70s, early 80s.
1830.14s: You probably were down in the 60 something percent correlations around the world, especially if you had international stocks in the mix.
1841.14s: You're approaching 85 plus now.
1846.14s: And I think it's largely because we have so many of these broad based indexes now when all these stocks are part of these indexes.
1857.14s: And there's lots of index funds that have tons of money that they have to go out and buy all these issues and put them in the indexes.
1864.14s: In the ETFs and all that stuff. So everything's just becoming correlated.
1869.14s: And it's hard to find a lack of correlation to truly be diversified in a straight stock portfolio long only.
1877.14s: But if I know that most stocks, like if we go into a, let's say 2000, where a text stocks go down 80% on the NASDAQ.
1889.14s: And you know, that hurts pretty badly.
1894.14s: If you're short the NASDAQ against its text stock portfolio, you just kind of doing okay.
1900.14s: You might lose a little. You might make a little leave in the NASDAQ index futures short might make more than your portfolio loses.
1908.14s: And you might come out a little ahead on the deal.
1911.14s: And the day of the crash of 87.
1915.14s: We were managing a pension plan that I put in my book, the all weather trader, I cited this example.
1922.14s: We were short.
1924.14s: Well before going into the crash day.
1929.14s: And we had the portfolio. It was a couple million dollar portfolio of stocks completely hedged and we ended up at the end of the day of the crash.
1937.14s: And we had a portfolio ahead about a fraction of 1%. So the hedge worked pretty well.
1944.14s: Actually made a little more of the hedge that we lost on the portfolio.
1949.14s: And you know, that's what you can achieve with one position you just knock down your risk.
1955.14s: It's hard to with a huge portfolio, a couple million dollars, lots and lots of positions to try to sell out all that and take taxable consequences.
1965.14s: And it is very difficult.
1967.14s: And especially if some of the issues don't trade a lot, we were into some small cap stuff at that point.
1973.14s: That was our specialty and you don't have the liquidity.
1976.14s: But you have a liquidity in the ES futures.
1981.14s: Multiple times per second.
1984.14s: No problem.
1986.14s: What do you think of small caps kind of so far this year, but then also looking forward.
1992.14s: And I think it's like, you know, persistent inflation would basically hurt smaller companies like that pretty meaningfully, but a lot of people are speculating that the unwind will, you know, really lift them up a bit.
2004.14s: Is that kind of what you're seeing or something else.
2006.14s: I like to think that a small company and I was one when I was a money manager had 10 employees. I was small.
2015.14s: And so the flexibility to do things a lot quicker and a lot faster and a little more innovative. You don't have to answer to, you know, a board of directors and a committee of 10 trying to find on every aspect of this particular decision.
2031.14s: And there's a lot of advantage that a small company has versus a larger competitor, the large competitor on the other hand has staying power financing expertise, perhaps in house that they don't have to go outside of house to get.
2049.14s: And so they can tend to squash some small competitors.
2054.14s: And what I like to think of small cap stocks is if they're just in a same industry and competing for the same product and it's a generic product of some sort, there's nothing special there.
2069.14s: I lean towards the liquidity of the larger company, because I think that then you have that ability to survive perhaps tough times.
2078.14s: On the other side of it, if you have a small company that has done something like a niche, you know, like back in the days of COVID zoom became a household.
2089.14s: It's now, you know, not if we're going to do a teleconference call, it's, are we going to zoom. It's almost become like zero oxies became copying something you zero access.
2102.14s: Even though zero ox was a brand name, you were zero oxing the piece of paper and held down the south, my wife is fond, she's from Jackson, Mississippi originally, and she's fond of telling me that when you in my northern New York terms, would say that you'd want a soda pop.
2125.14s: No, in the south, you get a coke. Right. Right. What kind of a seven up or do you want a doctor pepper or you want a Coca-Cola or a Pepsi, but they're all coax. Right.
2137.14s: And so I think that's what we face with small cap is finding those interesting stories that are supplying a niche that the big guys haven't figured out yet.
2152.14s: Those are the ones that are really the, you know, the thousand baggers that you can really do very well with and establish long term positions. So those are the ones I would always try to see kind of I was trying to go into small cap land.
2166.14s: Got it. I know we're coming up on time here, but do you trade orange juice features. Yes.
2175.14s: What what's going on there? I was looking at the movement. I don't trade orange juice features myself very much, but I can't help but not see that move and follow the move at this point. But what do you like. Yeah, what's the deal?
2187.14s: I'm not a fundamentalist, so I'll be just taking some pot, pot guesses at this.
2197.14s: But there's two things that seems to always affect the long term of orange juice.
2204.14s: One, it's the weather in Florida during the winter, because it seems like perpetually all the trips I've ever made to Orlando, I get there in the middle of January or something of frost hits.
2216.14s: And everybody's got the smudge pots out and they're trying to warm up the air over top of the orange crop, the orange trees.
2224.14s: And then invariably you get these issue, these super winter freezes that would knock out whatever 20% to pick a number 10 20% of all the orange trees would just die.
2240.14s: They can't take the cold. Right.
2243.14s: So then what usually happens because Florida is growing so fast is, you know, if the orange grow happens to be on the outskirts of Orlando, the guy says, you know, I'm tired of until the farming thing and losing 10 20% of my orange crop every so often.
2263.14s: This is a worth it. My property is now worth millions. I can retire and go by a place in the Bahamas and enjoy life. I'm done with this. And so one more orange crop goes so long term what ends up happening is the the amount of orange crop keeps kind of struggling to be as prolific as it was back in the day.
2292.14s: So I think those two factors are creating a lot of uncertainty in exactly the supply and demand of orange juice.
2300.14s: And I think there's been some nice moves. So traders that like to just measure a trend and go with it.
2308.14s: It's been very, very good this year both up and down.
2312.14s: Yeah, it's yeah, I because it popped up back like early this year. I want to say like February March where it had like that one just vertical set. And then I was like, wow, that's kind of interesting.
2323.14s: And then ever since then I watched it March from 200 to over 300 over the course of, you know, like March to now and it's like man.
2330.14s: I want to one of my posts on Twitter back in probably February or run in there when it was going vertical was orange juice futures remind me of a B22 taking off after a Chinese spy balloon.
2345.14s: You know, it takes off. It's the after burgers and that's kind of the way the chart looked.
2353.14s: Yeah, yeah. Of course, we let the spy balloon just drift across the entire country, but you know, that's a whole other story.
2360.14s: Well, one we want to take it out. It's done.
2364.14s: Pretty quick. Well, Tom, thank you so much for hanging out. Like I said, it's always fun. It's really cool getting your perspective on a lot of these different products.
