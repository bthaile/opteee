0.08s: here are my top two option strategies
2.12s: for small accounts if you have a small
4.56s: trading account you are at a perilous
7.68s: point in your trading career because it
9.68s: is very difficult to create logical risk
13.20s: reward relationships with such
15.76s: constrained Capital so the goal of this
17.52s: video is to walk you through the exact
19.16s: two strategies that I would use and did
21.84s: use when I did the small stack segment a
24.36s: long time ago that tested a $5,000
27.12s: account the goal at the end of the video
29.28s: is for you to have two more tools to add
31.36s: to your toolkit so that you can
33.12s: hopefully find different approaches
35.36s: other than the vertical spreads that are
37.32s: slowly losing you money and not making
39.68s: you enough for them to make sense what's
41.80s: up everybody Eric here welcome back to
43.40s: all the outliers shout out to the
44.56s: patreon family let's get straight into
47.24s: the top two option strategies for small
49.36s: accounts okay first let's talk about the
51.36s: scenario that we're in because it's not
53.12s: good small accounts in my world are
55.72s: anything below $150,000 $200,000 it
58.48s: doesn't really matter you might see that
59.68s: number be like Oh okay that's giant
61.68s: number it's not the point the point is
63.60s: is that anything really below portfolio
66.08s: margin there are different things that
67.88s: apply to you but the smaller your
70.40s: account is on this spectrum the more
73.12s: constrained you are and that's why you
76.04s: are compromised at the starting point
78.88s: because you are unable to put on enough
82.40s: trades in order to diversify your risk
84.96s: you're constrainted in terms of the
86.76s: products you can even trade the list
89.32s: goes on on not to mention what you see
92.52s: here if you have a small account you're
94.24s: probably new to trading so that means
96.20s: that your skill set isn't there yet
98.64s: you're still learning that and then
100.60s: probably your expectations are broken
102.80s: because just about all of us that are
104.56s: new to trading have really bad
106.64s: expectations no that's interesting
109.12s: so all of these things together create a
112.00s: pretty tenuous starting point for most
114.56s: Traders so I would offer to you a quick
117.72s: exercise to help us base our
119.40s: expectations if we have a $5,500 account
122.40s: which is the average US brokerage
124.88s: account and you make a 30% return on
128.20s: your money that's only
130.40s: $1,650 this does not seem like a giant
134.56s: return it's only 1,600 bucks but a 30%
137.44s: return literally is outperforming my
140.60s: compound annual growth rate from 2007
143.56s: that's not to say that that's any
145.04s: significant Benchmark but I've spent a
146.84s: lot of time doing this stuff and I have
148.68s: just over a 20% compound annual growth
151.20s: rate so what I'm trying to highlight
152.64s: here is even with an outstanding return
155.64s: the money the raw dollar is not that
158.40s: appealing yet if you look at what I
160.08s: would consider to be a very reasonable
162.36s: return for an account 10% it's only 550
165.12s: bucks nobody cares about that
167.28s: unfortunately so why do I think your
170.60s: primary objectives here should be
172.08s: preservation of capital skill set
174.00s: development and data collection it's
175.92s: because even if you get this crazy good
178.40s: return it's not a lot of money so in
180.16s: order to get this crazy good return
182.16s: you're probably going to take on quite a
183.88s: bit of risk and again it's not worth the
186.44s: payout so for small accounts the number
188.96s: one thing you need to do is save money
190.92s: that is without a doubt your top
192.84s: priority now in the actions of trading
195.84s: these in my opinion are great goals for
198.84s: you to have reservation of capital skill
201.16s: set development data collection so let's
203.32s: take a look at some context here if you
205.96s: have a small account and you suffer
208.28s: let's say uh4 % draw down you now need
211.52s: to make
213.00s: 66.7% return in order to get back to
215.48s: break even so these kinds of draw Downs
218.68s: can be catastrophic and to further make
221.04s: this point if you take a look at
222.56s: portfolio 1 here it returns
225.48s: 7.35% compound annual growth rate with
228.20s: an ending balance of
229.88s: $142,000 550 bucks and if we take a look
232.64s: at the average return it's only 7.4% but
235.08s: if you take a look at portfolio 3 it has
237.36s: a better average return of 8.6% % but a
240.56s: compound annual growth rate 6.8% and the
243.80s: ending value is only 139 so in portfolio
246.80s: 1 even though you have a worse average
249.32s: return because you didn't have this draw
252.64s: down you made more money and to drive
254.76s: this home just a little bit more if you
256.40s: have the same exact portfolio
258.68s: performance between portfolio 1
260.20s: portfolio 2 the only difference is this
261.92s: right here portfolio 2 in year three
264.92s: lost 5% and portfolio 1 made just 2%
268.72s: notice the difference between the
270.52s: performance here so what I want you to
272.72s: take away from here is that you can win
275.52s: in trading via three things create
278.16s: better returns that's very difficult but
280.16s: doable up to a certain degree avoiding
282.64s: draw Downs those two things combined are
286.36s: actually a really efficacious way to
288.84s: make a lot of money trading so it's not
291.04s: just about making better returns but
293.04s: avoiding draw Downs so all of that to
295.20s: set the table let's talk about these two
296.80s: strategies the first one is the coverage
298.36s: strangle there should be no surprise to
300.08s: anybody at all you can say that again
302.24s: pal the second is a ratio diagonal so
304.80s: what I want to walk you through now is
306.36s: kind of a comparison of these two
308.12s: strategies so that you understand how
309.84s: they may or may not fit into your
311.36s: toolkit so the coverage triangle and
313.76s: ratio diagonal I have videos an entire
316.56s: playlist around both of these I'll throw
318.16s: them in the notes below but quick
319.88s: refresh the structure for the coverage
321.80s: triangle is that it's going to be a cash
323.64s: secured put that you cycle until you are
326.32s: assigned at which point you will deploy
328.44s: a ratio covered call plus additional
331.12s: cash secured puts so really this uncaps
333.68s: upside potential here and then this
335.32s: helps us manage our bases by essentially
337.24s: dollar cost averaging in now the ratio
339.36s: diagonal little bit different it's going
341.20s: to be either a long call plus a short
344.20s: call or a long put plus a short putut
346.52s: there's some specific details that I
348.08s: typically deploy for these strategies
349.96s: which again you can check out in the
351.24s: Standalone videos but you'll notice
353.08s: right out of the gate these are
354.36s: structured quite a bit differently and
356.28s: that's for a reason for something like
357.84s: the coverage strangle I use it to build
359.96s: a core position so I like to trade
361.88s: things like index ETFs sector ETFs and
364.56s: even for a small account you can find
366.92s: products that makes sense for trading
369.28s: something like the coverage strangle
370.60s: which I'll actually go into at the end
371.84s: of the video when we look at something
373.36s: like the ratio diagonal again little bit
375.64s: different here in this case we're
377.12s: looking at something that allows us to
379.00s: trade directionally either bullish or
380.92s: bearish so coverage Triangle Building a
383.20s: core position that we might hold for a
384.92s: long period of time also for neutral
386.64s: market conditions ratio diagonal we want
389.00s: to be directional here what are the
391.08s: benefits of these different strategies
393.20s: well the coverage strangle it's super
394.92s: forgiving because if you're wrong on
397.20s: your cash secured put and you're
399.00s: assigned you're assigned an asset and if
401.44s: we're trading something like an index or
403.00s: sector ETF or a strong stock that's not
405.56s: the worst case you could just hold on to
407.28s: that position plenty of people hold on
408.72s: to trades for really long periods of
410.28s: time but that gives you plenty of time
412.56s: to be right and it offers inherent
414.36s: diversification depending on what you're
415.92s: choosing to trade which is great when we
417.60s: look at something though like the ratio
419.12s: diag Al it's very Capital efficient you
421.96s: expose yourself to leverage return
423.96s: potential and these are defined risk
426.04s: right out of the gate so you can
427.40s: immediately understand what your risk
429.16s: profile is on entry and it's pretty
431.84s: efficient whereas if we look at
433.20s: something like the coverage strangle
434.88s: it's a little bit different because in
436.76s: here they're very expensive if you're
439.08s: looking to cash secure a position you
441.20s: have to put aside quite a bit of money
443.12s: in order to do that so they also can
446.08s: work very slowly let's say you're
447.80s: assigned on something and it continues
449.56s: to Plum it down you could choose to have
451.72s: some sort of stop loss in place there if
453.52s: you want to be able to redeploy your
454.80s: capital or you might be holding
456.16s: something underwater for sometime again
458.44s: depending on how you set it up it can
459.96s: take a little bit of time for the
461.00s: strategy to work out for you now if we
462.72s: look at something like the ratio
464.28s: diagonal little bit different these you
466.88s: have to be right in the correct amount
468.80s: of time so there's two things that are
470.96s: happening you have to pick a direction
473.84s: successfully in the correct amount of
475.76s: time while time Decay is working against
478.00s: you that's actually why we do things
479.52s: like go deep in the money go further
481.32s: than 3 months out in time because that
483.16s: limits our Theta Decay exposure but it's
485.84s: still working against you so when we
487.88s: think about the allocation for these two
489.96s: different strategies what does that look
491.48s: like well for me for the coverage
492.88s: strangle it's up to 100% I would be
494.76s: happy to put 100% of my portfolio small
498.04s: account into an index ETF or a sector
500.44s: ETF and Let It Go just see how it does
503.08s: longer term now for the ratio diagonal
506.00s: it's a little bit different because
507.16s: these are speculative they offer us
508.96s: great growth potential but you have to
511.32s: be good at picking Direction so until
513.28s: you identify whether or not that's you
515.52s: in this case I would be a little bit
517.04s: more comfortable only allocating up to
519.04s: 75% of the portfolio which again that's
521.52s: still a ton to allocate but if you're in
524.48s: a really small account sometimes that's
526.88s: what you are stuck doing so one choice
529.60s: here is to use a standard scan I like to
532.52s: pick individual stocks that are within
534.32s: the S&P 500 for the coverage triangle
536.44s: they're just bigger companies and I
538.36s: really prefer them to be typically
540.36s: strong performers so normally what I'll
542.28s: do is I'll look at a sector rotation
544.88s: strategy where I will see the top
546.80s: performing sectors for the past 3 months
549.68s: and look for individual tickers within
551.68s: those sectors that meet some basic
553.40s: criteria in this case looking within all
555.80s: of the S&P 500 for stocks that are under
557.84s: 50 bucks you'll see that there's two
560.16s: that emerged at the end of my view and
563.68s: I'm looking for things that have EPS
565.80s: growth Revenue growth that are within
567.68s: the S&P 500 and again I'm going to look
570.04s: to see which sectors are the strongest
572.20s: performing and if we take a look at a
573.84s: quick chart you'll see that Wells Fargo
575.88s: actually looks pretty good here so that
577.96s: would be something that I could do now
580.00s: if you look at this and you say well if
581.76s: I traded a cash secured put and that
583.60s: would take $4,000 of my dollars and
585.40s: that's essentially my whole portfolio in
586.96s: one trade again that's the trade-off of
589.28s: a small account you have to determine if
590.80s: you're okay centralizing that much into
592.60s: an individual stock or you could do the
594.76s: next best next best thing you could take
597.92s: that previous scan and open it up to non
600.24s: S&P 500 products or you could look at
602.92s: ETFs the reason why I like ETFs is
605.16s: because they definitely offer way more
607.76s: exposure to diversify risk so that
611.24s: you're not so centralized in an
612.84s: individual product and you can find
614.40s: cheap ones you have to go through and
616.28s: find things that have options which is a
618.84s: little bit of a trick you could do that
620.16s: in whatever platform but in this case
622.00s: what I did is I just scanned for ETFs
625.12s: that essentially traded for less than 50
626.80s: bucks that are trading within the top
629.24s: 20% of the category and they were ranked
632.68s: in the top 20% of the category so you
634.48s: can find things like this and scan
636.12s: through and look for things that fit
637.68s: into your account size this is one of
640.48s: the problems of small accounts is that
642.40s: you have to do this you have to scan for
644.72s: things and it's a bit more work to find
646.64s: things that make sense the spiders ETFs
649.68s: are some of my favorites for smaller
651.60s: accounts this is where you can grab
653.28s: something like XLF which is the entire
655.80s: financial sector and it's only 30 bucks
657.80s: so this is a great candidate it for the
660.08s: coverage triangle same thing you're
661.52s: going to get used to seeing some of the
662.84s: same names Well Fargo Ford like there's
665.04s: a bunch of individual companies that
666.88s: definitely still fall within this range
668.72s: and the great part about the ratio
670.68s: diagonal however is that you really
671.96s: don't have to fight the struggle you
673.84s: gain efficiency you're not going to be
675.04s: able to trade everything but a lot of
676.84s: products are quite approachable for even
679.72s: very small accounts with that but you
681.20s: have to be good at getting direction
683.04s: correct so if you have any questions
684.76s: comments concerns as always let me know
686.52s: if this video is helpful consider liking
688.40s: it sharing in it leaving a comment below
690.32s: so that we can emerge from the YouTube
692.08s: algorithm and help other people find
694.16s: decent information other than the
695.72s: stereotypical make a gajillion dollars
697.96s: on your $100 account every 7 days which
700.56s: typically results in just people losing
702.04s: all their money because they're set up
703.52s: for failure by some really predatorial
706.48s: YouTubers who suck so let's not do that
708.68s: be an outlier see you guys later
