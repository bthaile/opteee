0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.46s:  and
100.96s:  you
105.68s:  you know what up gangsters? This is
109.36s:  showing a ton of dropped frames
111.66s:  Let me see if I can figure this out.
117.66s:  This asks for 6,800.
120.66s:  Give me one sec. Let me see if I can fix this.
124.66s:  And...
127.66s:  I'll put streaming.
131.66s:  Just trying to turn up what kind of resource this is getting.
135.66s:  I have no idea why this is showing such a weak connection.
139.66s:  Normally it's a okay.
142.66s:  Strange.
143.66s:  Let me know if this is even coming through for you guys,
146.66s:  or if it's like super choppy or something.
151.66s:  All right, there we go.
153.66s:  This looks like we should be good.
155.66s:  I'm seeing zero drop frames.
157.66s:  I'm seeing solid connection.
161.66s:  Let me know if we are looking okay from your end.
164.66s:  From what I can see, it looks all right.
167.66s:  I will kick us off.
168.66s:  Strange.
169.66s:  Always something.
170.66s:  I gotta say.
171.66s:  But the age old approach of not knowing how to fix it
177.66s:  and just turn it off and turn it on still remains undefeated.
181.66s:  All right, so let's get over to the main screen
183.66s:  and let's run through the agenda.
190.66s:  The game plan for today is I want to do a quick market overview.
195.66s:  Just walk through what I was seeing.
199.66s:  In the overall market today, I want to run through some general news.
202.66s:  Then I want to dive into a couple portfolio updates, not too many.
210.66s:  Because there's not a whole lot going on.
212.66s:  And then I want to pivot to running through some scans,
216.66s:  seeing if we can find anything.
218.66s:  And then I'm going to talk to you all a little bit about kind of the upcoming
223.66s:  content schedule.
224.66s:  I'm going to each month I typically try some different things.
229.66s:  So that's the game plan at least is to walk you through some of the adjustments I'm making.
236.66s:  One of them is going to be the primary weekly videos going to come out on Sundays.
240.66s:  Now I'm actually going to probably tick up the number of pro live streams throughout the week.
246.66s:  So right now we're typically doing two.
251.66s:  And I'm going to try to round that out probably to at least three.
255.66s:  I want to spend a little more time talking about like the ins and outs of trading
260.66s:  and try to spend a little time diving deeper into that.
264.66s:  So more to come on all of that.
267.66s:  Before we get too far as always, you know, we've got to say hello to everybody.
271.66s:  Make sure you say hello to your friends that you see in the chat.
275.66s:  Hopefully you have some friends.
277.66s:  Most of us do.
278.66s:  I feel like most people that come hang out on the streams at this point have a pretty good
283.66s:  sense of one another.
284.66s:  And it looks like we have Tommy David April.
289.66s:  What up April been looking for a while excited to join a live great to have you here.
296.66s:  We also got Zachariah Lawrence out here making everybody pissed off doing dumb things.
302.66s:  We'll talk about that.
303.66s:  Whatever that was.
304.66s:  We also have travel, Ursula Jimmy, Shrey and James and H got everybody.
313.66s:  Literally have everybody could ever on a live stream.
316.66s:  So let's talk about the market at a high level first flexible grid.
321.66s:  You know what's up.
322.66s:  What do we see today?
324.66s:  Big, big move realistically.
326.66s:  So we saw a pretty massive jump in the S&P 500.
330.66s:  We saw it in cues.
332.66s:  We did not see it yet again in the Russell.
335.66s:  The Russell continues to lag.
337.66s:  Very important point.
339.66s:  Vicks contracted a bit bonds are three month lows at this point.
344.66s:  Bitcoin is still trending up hovering just over 100 K.
349.66s:  We have materials making lows, calm services, pivoting leading a little bit of this short term
360.16s:  turnover.
361.16s:  It looks like energy down day, although it opened up financials down day, industrials down
368.86s:  day, tech big up day staples massive down day netting new lows.
374.96s:  This is still primary weakness whenever we're trying to find things to run to the downside.
380.76s:  This continues to be the honey pot tons to do.
383.16s:  They're same thing with real estate real estate at this point is trending sideways a little
387.40s:  bit better for risk premium plays.
391.40s:  Utilities rolling over after their slight recovery still showing a ton of weakness and then
398.50s:  health care is still chopping a little bit.
403.40s:  I mean, it's like showing some slight slight recovery from 137 up to 139, but trivial at
410.10s:  that best.
411.10s:  And then discretionary is still massively outperforming staples, which I still continue to find interesting.
418.86s:  And then defense sector is trending downside chopping a little bit.
425.34s:  If I were to summarize where I'm seeing strength right now, it's the same places we've seen
428.94s:  it for some time.
429.94s:  Tech AI has been really, really big.
431.94s:  You can find a lot of things, even things like Palantir interestingly enough, I've been
437.74s:  I'm trying to get a reentry here, but I just can't justify it.
442.22s:  So my hope is Palantir will start behaving a little bit better so that I can justify
450.86s:  a reentry, but it looks fine, but it's just not rallying as I think it should be.
458.50s:  So that's a little frustrating to see.
461.26s:  Same thing with Sofie.
463.70s:  These two I've been keeping a pretty close eyeball on.
466.02s:  Sofie had a really great day today up 3% but still I mean like in a broader context
470.94s:  that's not doing well.
472.26s:  So neither of these deserve any money from me at this point.
475.68s:  It'll be a little especially for Sofie.
479.46s:  They're becoming it's becoming a little too choppy right.
482.30s:  So we can see that it's getting this decent size rally.
485.58s:  If we look at I want the daily range, if we look at a five day daily range average daily
491.22s:  range, it's 5.12% 20 days 5.78, but a 90 days 4.9.
496.94s:  So leading into this, we were actually seeing Sofie behaving pretty well with more inside
504.46s:  days consistent movements, but this is not good.
507.58s:  So this is price discovery happening kind of real time.
511.26s:  People trying to figure out what they value the stock at.
514.62s:  And so yeah, these have been unfortunately nothing too interesting.
520.78s:  Now of interest from the discord today, I actually learned who was it from?
526.06s:  Let me see.
527.06s:  I want to give.
529.06s:  Reddit.
531.06s:  Where who was it.
541.46s:  From Reese.
544.46s:  So Reese mentioned that meta has taken Dana White onto the board, which is really, really
554.02s:  smart move, just a really, really smart move by meta because I think Dana White is a fantastic
560.46s:  leader.
561.46s:  He does a great job running a business like the UFC and he even kept it going during
565.26s:  something like COVID.
566.74s:  He's really effectual.
568.78s:  Now I don't think he would do as well in something like meta just because of how big it is
574.34s:  like the UFC does a lot of money, but it's not a big company.
579.30s:  Now meta is just massive.
581.30s:  So from that element, very, very different, but it's also a really smart decision because
588.10s:  Trump is friends with Dana and that just helps.
594.02s:  So my guess is it's a pretty wise political decision being made by Musk, not Musk, sorry,
601.94s:  by Zuckerberg, which interestingly Zuckerberg also has gotten into Jits himself.
606.90s:  So I think that yeah, I think because Zuckerberg's been to a bunch of the fights at the UFC,
614.54s:  he's even walked out with Volker before.
619.94s:  So yeah, he does like the UFC.
622.22s:  I'm sure he has an existing relationship with Dana, but interesting.
627.74s:  Interesting all around.
628.74s:  I have to say.
630.54s:  So meta looks good.
634.54s:  Really what looks great is Nvidia today.
636.82s:  Nvidia is just smashing it.
639.26s:  It's creeping up on all time highs, massive, massive, massive volume today on a relative
645.82s:  basis.
646.82s:  And it is just up and out, which looks really, really good.
649.98s:  So I have my ratio called diagonal that's been down.
654.06s:  So unfortunately, I did not participate in this move through a direct play, but I do
658.98s:  have my leverage stuff via T-Triple Q's and Upro, which obviously is a lot of Nvidia
664.30s:  inherently.
665.50s:  So I still participated in directly through those.
669.30s:  But yeah, really, really interesting movement today.
671.90s:  And speaking of the leveraged coverage strangles, we have Q's is still rotating a little bit.
678.98s:  This gap looks good, but this is an embryonic turnaround in my opinion because we really
685.74s:  need to challenge this lower high and this needs to exceed it.
691.14s:  And I mean, if right now it doesn't feel like that to me, it feels like it might come
696.38s:  up close to it, hover around before rolling back over.
699.58s:  The reason why I say that is just because this move wasn't really sponsored overly heavily.
706.86s:  It definitely wasn't expansion and volume for sure, but it's kind of split.
711.50s:  And you can see that 57% of the volume today was on the sales side.
715.02s:  And you can see that this is a tiny little body of a candle.
717.70s:  That's not great.
718.70s:  That means that buyers are coming in, but they're being controlled by sellers and vice versa.
723.10s:  But that means that it's about equal distribution of interest at this point.
727.10s:  So that is something to be aware of.
729.62s:  I did add a little bit more risk into Upro and into T-Triple Q's for the coverage
737.14s:  triangle.
738.14s:  I'll go more into that stuff a little bit later, but that's where the market's kind of
744.06s:  sitting as of today as far as I see it.
747.18s:  And yesterday we ran through all of this stuff for the week coming ahead and all that
751.78s:  stuff.
752.78s:  So I'm not going to go through that again.
754.06s:  Now I do want to talk a little bit about my performance for last year.
760.78s:  And the reason why I want to talk about this is just so everybody knows, right?
764.78s:  I'm on here talking about stuff and I feel like everybody at least should have an idea
772.38s:  of what I do and what it potentially does so that people are comfortable with it.
778.82s:  Now, I don't have my consolidated 1099 yet.
783.14s:  So I'm just going to give you a verbal overview right now.
787.06s:  The reason is because I'm going to just take a screenshot of the top of the consolidated
792.58s:  1099, right?
793.58s:  So that you can actually see what it was.
795.90s:  But I track all of my stuff way more detailed than what the broker does in Excel and Google
802.20s:  Sheets.
803.20s:  So that's what I will share with you at least with where we landed.
810.50s:  So I think I have a screenshot of it.
813.82s:  Let me grab this really quick.
815.50s:  I should be able to pull up the screenshot.
818.06s:  Yeah, right here.
823.58s:  So this is where we landed for 2024 and I'll zoom in and I'll talk a little bit about
831.50s:  it.
832.50s:  I think it's going to resize as soon as I move it.
835.06s:  Oh, no, it doesn't.
836.14s:  That's great.
837.14s:  Okay.
838.14s:  That's a little too much.
840.54s:  That's probably fine.
841.54s:  I think you guys can see this.
843.58s:  No surprise here.
845.38s:  And I had been giving periodic updates as we were going through the year.
851.30s:  And what I noticed was a few things.
857.30s:  Last year was really, really strong for trading directionally.
865.58s:  The other thing that helped me out a ton last year was rotating into the leveraged coverage
874.14s:  triangles.
875.78s:  So I had started the leveraged coverage triangles.
880.06s:  I've traded them for a long time, but I flow into an out of them for different reasons,
887.14s:  different market conditions.
888.90s:  So last year moving into them was really efficacious.
894.02s:  That's where a lot of this return came from the core allocation was from the leveraged
900.46s:  coverage triangles.
901.46s:  And why it's not as strong as what they should have been is because I didn't stay in them
906.54s:  all year.
907.54s:  I didn't start in them right away.
909.02s:  I was still trading other things before I pivoted over to them.
913.78s:  Then the remainder of the movement really came down from the speculative allocation.
920.14s:  That's what this top section is.
922.18s:  So 58% of the total return on the portfolio came from speculative allocation.
928.38s:  And within that speculative allocation component, the majority of it came from ratio-called
933.86s:  diagonals trading things directionally.
935.94s:  I had talked a little bit about that trade in APP.
939.18s:  I was going back and forth on whether or not I was going to do a video of it.
943.18s:  I still am generally undecided to be completely honest.
946.46s:  If we want to review it, I would be down to review it during maybe one of the pro livestreams
951.22s:  or something.
953.46s:  The reason why I'm not super jazzed about talking about it is because I didn't really
959.50s:  do anything.
961.26s:  So there's not much to talk about.
963.62s:  It's like it's throwing darts at a dartboard and that one happened to stick well, right?
969.74s:  So I don't necessarily feel warm and fuzzy about doing anything special with the trade.
975.30s:  The management of the trade was whatever.
977.42s:  It yeah, there just wasn't a whole lot.
980.14s:  But that trade did account for a non-trivial amount of this 29% in that one trade because
987.14s:  that one trade was significant.
992.82s:  And for those that didn't see how APP moved, you can see, I think I got into it on like
996.98s:  the 11th of September and I traded pretty much the bulk of that run up.
1002.78s:  So that's where that was.
1004.66s:  The other thing I noticed that's worth mentioning is this bucket.
1009.14s:  Actually my short volatility trading does better than this.
1015.98s:  Now this is also kind of mislabeled.
1018.70s:  I realized because there is long wall tied to this, but it's such a small subset.
1024.06s:  So I do trade long wall coming into earnings, but it's a really small section of this.
1030.98s:  It's like maybe 2% of the total return ish.
1033.42s:  I think it's sub 2%, but like high 1%.
1037.94s:  So this I thought was interesting though and something that's topical because normally
1045.54s:  trading earnings is a much bigger part of my annual book.
1050.58s:  And trading earnings generally offers a fantastic return profile because it's completely
1057.58s:  decoupled generally from market beta.
1062.22s:  It's not tied to what the rest of the market is doing, which is what makes it so attractive
1066.38s:  to me.
1067.38s:  I have non correlated returns, but I kept coming across instances where things did not
1075.62s:  look lucrative.
1077.02s:  So my overall trading activity in earnings play specifically was very, very light compared
1083.42s:  to what it typically is.
1086.42s:  I track what I would trade.
1089.30s:  I have my live trades that go on, but then I also track what I would trade, meaning just
1095.98s:  put on paper traits for all of them.
1098.38s:  And the discernment was rewarded because had I executed a more systematic approach and
1107.98s:  not applied discretion, the overall return for this would almost be negative once I included
1114.14s:  everything, including fees from the paper trading component.
1119.58s:  That's interesting.
1120.86s:  And it makes me a little concerned because I've seen years like that before, but not that
1126.50s:  frequently.
1127.90s:  So what makes me nervous about that is it, I really hope that that is not a new market
1135.86s:  norm.
1137.46s:  That would be bad because this is still hopefully going to be a significant driver of performance
1145.62s:  for this coming year, but VAL is just not priced well.
1150.30s:  So it leads me to be a little uncomfortable with scaling into the strategies and really
1157.10s:  leaning on it as a strategy, just because the edge is really declining a bit.
1165.94s:  Now zeroes, I notice a little bit of the same.
1169.78s:  And going forward, you're actually going to notice that this bucket, the zero DTE is
1174.10s:  going to grow.
1175.42s:  What I mean by that is this is going to be like zero to 14 DTE.
1180.34s:  I'm going to bucket all of them the same.
1182.54s:  Now I break them down more discreetly in my spreadsheets, but like this would get way
1188.58s:  too noisy, noisy.
1190.14s:  If I listed like every permutation of what I did here, it'd be really difficult to even
1196.02s:  track visually.
1197.46s:  So that's why I'm just kind of bundling all of those short term index style strategies.
1203.58s:  That's what zero DTE means to me here.
1205.82s:  That's only going to be done in the indices themselves, specifically things like SPX.
1210.70s:  And I wonder how well it's going to perform this year because last year without starting
1218.26s:  to pivot to other time frames, zeroes did not impress me either.
1223.10s:  Again, you can see what worked hands down the best on a relative basis.
1228.54s:  And it was taking market beta, obviously, it's the market flow off the handle to the upside.
1235.58s:  And the trend following, which just find that a little bit interesting to me.
1244.26s:  So this year, I'm essentially starting with a clean slate like everybody does.
1249.94s:  And I still have a bunch of levered cover triangles on.
1253.62s:  I will continue to run those.
1255.70s:  And then based on the recent live stream that I did for GameStop this last Saturday, I've
1261.78s:  actually increased the allocation for the coverage strangle for GameStop to 25K.
1269.38s:  I was originally planning on just doing a 15K coverage strangle, but it was about 50% of
1278.26s:  the total group had 25K plus positions in there.
1283.38s:  So it becomes a little bit more relevant to do it with the slightly larger allocation.
1288.98s:  Now to be clear, 25K versus 15K, this is the same shit.
1292.50s:  It really is.
1293.62s:  The only difference is the total number of shares and lots I will be transacting at.
1298.34s:  So for those that have a smaller portfolio or even smaller than 25K, don't feel any
1304.06s:  type of way about it because we will still absolutely be able to track this together.
1309.70s:  You'll be able to see what I'm doing and how I'm doing.
1311.86s:  But I do need to now add more risk into GameStop.
1315.38s:  That's for damn sure.
1317.10s:  So first things first, let me take a look.
1320.78s:  I want to make sure that my log is updated and then I'll port it over into this for us
1325.70s:  to take a look at.
1326.70s:  Yeah.
1327.70s:  So I grabbed a couple of hundred shares of you pro today at 9435.
1332.42s:  I bit is the same.
1335.06s:  And then GameStop is good.
1339.14s:  I need to add more risk into GameStop now.
1343.86s:  And let's pull this over into my workbook and then we can take a stroll together.
1349.50s:  We're going.
1351.70s:  Okay.
1355.14s:  So this I think we can probably fly through pretty quick unless anybody has any questions
1361.38s:  as always happy to go into them.
1363.06s:  There's just really nothing that exciting going on.
1366.14s:  So for T triple Q's, there's literally been no change.
1370.26s:  The main thing for T triple Q's is I do have this in the money short call.
1374.42s:  This in the money short call expires on 17 Jan of this year.
1380.58s:  And that's a little problematic because you can see this is already a rolled short call.
1388.14s:  So the original role, I can tell you happened right here, right?
1391.66s:  As I can see that there's a massive debit to close this trade out that tells me right
1396.30s:  away that this is a role position.
1399.98s:  So this has already been rolled once and is likely going to need to be rolled again.
1406.18s:  Now let's take a look at what that actually looks like the option itself.
1410.94s:  So we'll go in here.
1411.94s:  We'll go to T triple Q's.
1415.42s:  And we are in the 17 Jan 25's 11 days out and we have the 82's.
1421.10s:  So these are about ready to be rolled to be honest.
1424.74s:  They're pretty deep in the money.
1425.82s:  There is 67 Delta.
1427.22s:  I will be able to close them for a pretty handsome profit.
1431.62s:  So if you take a look, the way that this will work is let me add some over here.
1440.42s:  Just so that I can show you some scratch math so that you can follow along with what's
1443.46s:  going on.
1445.46s:  And if this is like, if I'm talking about this stuff and you're like, yeah, what the fuck
1449.18s:  is this dude talking about?
1450.86s:  Ask because this stuff is honestly pretty simple, but I know a lot of people are brand
1455.70s:  new to options.
1457.22s:  Don't literally don't feel any type of way.
1459.02s:  You're not going to ask me a dumb question.
1460.86s:  I will give shit to people that I know should know better, but for people that I know don't
1466.42s:  know better, then you guys get all the grace in the world because you deserve it.
1471.50s:  Picking up options for the first time or being, you know, a couple of years into trading
1475.10s:  options is not easy.
1476.50s:  Okay.
1478.02s:  So we started with one and we had 320 credit and then we closed it for 985.
1489.54s:  So what I'm doing is I'm going to show you how to track the math for all of this.
1495.10s:  So this is the first trade.
1499.82s:  The second trade now is one and we got it for 985.
1508.58s:  And we can close it right now for 525.
1522.46s:  So what we can do is we can do some math here and we can figure out what our required
1530.62s:  sizing is in order to get out at a break even.
1535.38s:  So you can see all I'm doing is multiplying across and then I'm going to sum these just
1540.62s:  like this.
1541.90s:  So I essentially need to get at least $2.05.
1546.02s:  If I can get $2.05, that is my break even point for exiting this, right?
1553.10s:  So the way that this would work is like this.
1557.42s:  Just so that you can see the example all the way through.
1559.54s:  So let's say that I can sell something for $2.05 and then let's say I can close it out.
1564.58s:  It comes to expiration for nothing.
1568.10s:  Now if we sum all this up, you can see we're at break even.
1576.82s:  So what I'm doing is I'm able to very clearly articulate and identify how much I need to
1584.34s:  take in in order to be at first a break even before finding way into profit.
1590.90s:  Now for selling short calls like this, the goal isn't to be break even.
1594.14s:  It's to make money.
1595.14s:  But it's also really, really important to remember where we started.
1598.50s:  We started with a basis of 80, then we changed it to 82, right?
1604.30s:  So we started here and then we were able to move it to 82.
1607.98s:  So what I like to do is track what the total percent changes between these so that I have
1615.34s:  a little bit of context as I'm moving forward.
1618.34s:  And I have a specific tracker that does all this stuff just more neatly.
1622.66s:  I'm showing you literally the back of the napkin math here so that you can create your
1626.38s:  own versions of this.
1627.38s:  That's why I spend the time walking you through this thing.
1630.14s:  So I was able to collect a credit and I was able to increase my basis by 2.5%.
1639.70s:  It's considerably large because again, let's do some other scratch math to make this even
1644.34s:  more confusing.
1645.58s:  If we have 100 shares and our original sell price was going to be 80 because this was
1653.50s:  the original strike price.
1655.22s:  It doesn't matter what our basis is.
1657.10s:  Our basis is 7332.
1658.78s:  We would make money no matter what, right?
1660.66s:  That's great.
1661.66s:  But we can also figure out what the difference is in terms of how much money, how much more
1667.58s:  money I stand to make.
1668.94s:  Now obviously the math here is really easy.
1671.06s:  We just take the new price that I would be able to sell at, multiply, you take the new
1676.42s:  price I'd be able to sell at less the prior price.
1678.58s:  So 82 minus 80 times 100.
1681.30s:  So I make $200 more on the total profit potential in the trade.
1686.06s:  So even though in this role, I rolled for flat money.
1690.70s:  It didn't make anything.
1692.38s:  It was 985 out.
1694.26s:  It was 985 in by still making this role and increasing my basis by 2.5%.
1701.06s:  I increased my total profit potential by $200.
1704.26s:  I will take a pause there.
1705.26s:  I realize that I'm talking, well, I don't think it's too fast.
1709.58s:  But talking a lot and I have absolutely no idea if this makes sense or not.
1715.18s:  I know some people, like I think I saw Shrein here.
1717.66s:  I know Shrein's following, but I don't know for everybody else if this shit makes sense
1723.78s:  or not.
1724.78s:  Okay.
1725.78s:  So James is following.
1726.98s:  That's great.
1728.98s:  Cool.
1735.74s:  So it seems like so far so good.
1741.34s:  Shin Sasu says, yeah, the point is not to ignore the underlying.
1745.74s:  Yeah.
1746.74s:  And the broader point is to think a little more tactically about our roles because one
1755.02s:  of the things that you're taught or people will tell you, let me know.
1760.14s:  Let me know genuinely if you've heard from I'm going to put it as a poll because I'm
1763.74s:  literally curious about this.
1770.74s:  Okay.
1782.14s:  There's a poll there for you.
1783.86s:  The poll is make sure you roll for a credit.
1787.46s:  You've either heard this before or you're asking to fuck is this either of those.
1793.02s:  And I'm, my guess is most people that have at least heard about rolling will be familiar
1802.90s:  with this concept.
1803.90s:  And I'm going to explain to you why it's completely wrong.
1808.38s:  So for those that are saying, the fuck is this great question.
1812.18s:  Let's talk about it.
1814.18s:  For those that are voting or for those that have voted to fuck is this.
1819.22s:  My first question for you is, are you familiar with what the idea of rolling is?
1826.20s:  And again, if you are cool, if you're not, tell me.
1829.54s:  And I literally will explain, okay, perfect.
1832.30s:  So Lauren says, this is why we love Lauren, not only because she has long legs and she's
1837.46s:  in a long distance relationship with Day Swag, but because she is willing to help everybody
1845.82s:  learn.
1846.82s:  So we're on the standard set up now.
1850.54s:  So that means you guys get the Eric special, which is, well, you guys know what the Eric
1859.82s:  special is.
1860.82s:  It's a shitty drawing.
1861.98s:  It's obviously with the Eric special is going to see how much you guys can see of this.
1866.26s:  Let me squish this so that I know exactly.
1869.06s:  Go right.
1870.06s:  Lovely.
1871.06s:  That means I've just pushed this down to you.
1874.66s:  That's annoying.
1876.30s:  The screen is like just missized.
1879.02s:  Just the worst.
1881.74s:  All right, let me grab this.
1888.38s:  The first thing's first, we need to change our color.
1891.78s:  And we have a person.
1906.30s:  So there's our person.
1911.94s:  You can see that they have a head and they have arms and those are obviously these are
1918.82s:  the legs.
1920.42s:  So if you have any idea who this person is, you can shout them out in the chat.
1926.90s:  This is one of our, one of our favorite people.
1930.70s:  Trace says, bling, we don't have bling yet.
1933.30s:  And I'll explain why we don't have bling yet.
1935.90s:  We need some money for bling and we're working on getting the bling, but we're not quite
1940.58s:  there yet.
1941.98s:  We have a couple, a couple of things that we need to do in order to access the bling.
1948.18s:  Lauren says, I also like your newest video.
1951.18s:  It was zoomed in into tiny numbers.
1952.82s:  Yeah, that's awesome.
1953.82s:  So I'm working a lot with with the new editor to try to make the videos more consumable.
1959.58s:  Again, the disposition for editors is to try to drive up engagement, which is great.
1964.46s:  But as you know, I much, much prefer just good content and good information.
1971.30s:  So I don't like a ton of like screen switches and big noises because a big thing that they
1979.14s:  do is they insert a ton of stock images of like a dude like grabbing his face or some shit.
1984.30s:  Like I don't care about any of that.
1986.46s:  So yeah, I'm glad that so far that stuff's been good.
1989.30s:  I'm hoping to continue dialing in.
1991.94s:  So this is correct.
1993.26s:  This would be Lauren.
1995.18s:  So this is everybody can shout out Lauren in the chat.
1998.94s:  But Lauren is reported that she has long legs and she's also still never giving me a
2003.46s:  fucking haircut, which is complete bullshit.
2005.46s:  I just went to a new barber when I got back and he was great.
2009.90s:  So I'm still happy with the dude that I got.
2013.50s:  But Lauren is holding out on me.
2016.30s:  So you cut hair, bullshit.
2021.10s:  Okay.
2022.10s:  Lauren sells to open an option.
2024.38s:  So we're going to sell to open.
2028.54s:  Why is my undo button not working?
2030.42s:  We go.
2031.42s:  Sell to open.
2033.02s:  One.
2034.02s:  Doesn't matter if it's call or put call slash put.
2039.26s:  And we got a dollar.
2042.70s:  Rolling is fake.
2046.46s:  Rolling means nothing.
2048.62s:  That aside.
2050.66s:  It is a common term used for a specific accounting method.
2057.98s:  Rolling is simply when we close this option.
2062.86s:  So bought to close and let's say that we closed it for two dollars.
2068.46s:  It doesn't even have to be two dollars actually.
2069.86s:  Let me do a different scenario.
2071.10s:  Fifty cents.
2072.10s:  We've made money.
2074.06s:  Rolling is simply the process of tying these trades together.
2078.62s:  So we have trade one, which is the open trade one, B, which is the close.
2086.46s:  And then we have trade two.
2089.22s:  I guess we'll do trade one C to keep the thread the same, right?
2092.86s:  So it's the same.
2093.86s:  We're tying the accounting together.
2095.94s:  And then we sell to open a new option for one dollar.
2100.98s:  This right here is where the role is.
2104.46s:  When we close a prior trade and open a new trade that's tied to a prior trade, that's
2112.74s:  all a role is now there's a bunch of commonalities and inferences with a role.
2119.82s:  So one of the inferences and this is this tells you everything you need to know about
2123.62s:  rolling.
2125.18s:  The standard inference for rolling is if I close this trade here, this trade we would
2136.62s:  have made fifty bucks.
2138.38s:  If I close this and open this one, the overwhelming majority of people would not refer to this
2145.26s:  as a role.
2146.34s:  The overwhelming majority of people would refer to this as closing a trade and opening
2150.58s:  a trade.
2151.58s:  That's what they would refer to it as.
2154.46s:  Now let me show you what people typically refer to as a role.
2158.98s:  We have T1A, again, sell to open the caller put.
2164.42s:  T1B, buy to close the caller put this one.
2170.74s:  T1C and this one, let's say we did it for a dollar, this one we do it for two dollars,
2178.94s:  and then this one we sell to open for two fifty.
2184.78s:  This just about everybody would refer to as a role.
2191.46s:  What do you notice?
2192.46s:  What's the difference here?
2193.98s:  The difference is the common inference for when somebody says I rolled is that it was
2200.42s:  a losing trade.
2202.50s:  It doesn't have to be a losing trade.
2205.10s:  Again, going back to the beginning, Stelio is right on it, same thing with David.
2211.82s:  Perfect, nice job.
2216.18s:  The context of a role in a nutshell is simply when we're tying the accounting between
2222.98s:  two different trades together.
2226.14s:  The reality of things is that they are two different trades.
2230.78s:  That's it.
2232.02s:  The rolling is a massive mental gymnastic.
2236.74s:  Now that being said, I roll all the time.
2240.18s:  I'm talking about this rolled short call right now.
2244.70s:  The reason why we use rolling is it helps us consolidate the PNL for an individual trade
2251.38s:  or position.
2252.46s:  But again, we normally would not refer, let's say that I closed this one.
2264.34s:  I closed this trade in this example and I made $126 and then I sold this one.
2272.58s:  I wouldn't refer to this as a role.
2276.34s:  Functionally that's what it is.
2278.98s:  That's not what I would refer to it as.
2280.86s:  This would just be closing a trade, opening a new one.
2283.74s:  This example up here would be what we would refer to as a role.
2289.18s:  First, follow up question for Lauren.
2294.06s:  Do you understand what a role is now, at least in concept?
2300.18s:  I need to open my window.
2311.02s:  That's our first question.
2312.10s:  Do we feel comfortable with what a role is in concept?
2319.50s:  Simply closing a trade, opening a new one, tying the accounting together.
2329.10s:  I'm going to clear this out while Lauren is confirming or denying if she's on board with
2335.18s:  us.
2336.50s:  A little, the fuck is a little.
2341.66s:  Lauren, give me an example, a hypothetical of a rolled trade, a rolled option to the
2352.14s:  best of your ability.
2355.90s:  If you were to roll an option, what would it look like?
2360.30s:  You have a couple examples right here to work off of.
2365.50s:  A couple notes while Lauren is doing that is, okay, so Lauren says, I understand what
2371.10s:  the role is, I don't understand the why.
2373.82s:  The true reason why is to tie the accounting together so that you can track the overall
2382.54s:  movement of a position.
2385.86s:  Here's essentially what this means.
2387.66s:  I will close this.
2392.94s:  In this example, I had the 20 dees 80 calls.
2401.34s:  I sold them for 320 and I bought them back for 985.
2404.02s:  That realizes $665 loss.
2407.38s:  The purpose of rolling is to put on new positions that can overcome this loss that are essentially
2416.62s:  tied to this original trade.
2419.30s:  That's the purpose of rolling.
2421.58s:  So it allows us to tie the accounting together for something.
2426.74s:  So then at the end of this, I can see whether or not the adjustments made to this individual
2433.70s:  position either move me into profit or not.
2437.94s:  Now to the broader point, you don't need to track it this way.
2441.50s:  You literally can track them just like I do right here and track them as each individual
2446.42s:  short call and just see how it comes out in the wash.
2449.98s:  That is entirely, entirely reasonable viable.
2453.66s:  But the purpose of rolling is to hone in on individual positions a little bit more closely.
2459.18s:  So that's the idea behind rolling.
2463.54s:  Now one of the things that people are told is what I put in the poll, which is when you
2472.78s:  roll, you're told that you have to roll for a credit.
2478.54s:  You have to roll for a credit.
2480.70s:  And what you're told is that if you don't roll for a credit, you are potentially or you
2486.18s:  are locking in a loss.
2491.26s:  Does that sound familiar to anybody specifically that has answered the 62% that has answered
2496.86s:  heard this to the poll?
2499.74s:  This is what I just say sound familiar where you were told that if you don't roll for
2505.42s:  a credit, you're locking in a loss.
2507.50s:  Okay.
2508.50s:  So Reese is familiar with it.
2509.78s:  Anybody else?
2510.78s:  I just want to see how common that element is.
2515.66s:  Yep.
2516.66s:  Okay.
2517.66s:  Cool.
2518.66s:  So what if I told you that you can roll for a debit and not.
2529.22s:  Lock in a loss and still have a net profitable role at the end of it.
2535.26s:  Does that sound wrong?
2536.82s:  Does that sound off from what you've heard?
2556.06s:  Does what I just say does it sound like what's the reaction to it?
2561.98s:  Does that sound normal?
2562.98s:  Okay.
2563.98s:  So travel ursul says need an example.
2568.58s:  So but so then travel ursul.
2571.74s:  Let's say that I was just an internet dude, meaning you don't know who I am.
2575.26s:  You don't know my background.
2576.74s:  You don't know that I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading.
2581.58s:  And I kind of know what I'm doing at this point a little bit.
2585.26s:  Let's say that I was just a random dude on Reddit that was posting.
2588.94s:  And I said, you don't have to roll for a credit in order to have a profitable role at the
2595.42s:  end of it.
2596.86s:  Would you say that person is right or wrong?
2602.74s:  Any any input there?
2606.82s:  Shana also says because the underlying makes more profit than the credit would be that's
2610.10s:  not it.
2611.10s:  That's actually not it at all.
2613.78s:  The best answer is to why it is is from Tommy.
2619.50s:  Tommy has the correct response.
2629.34s:  So Kai says roll down into the money or out in time.
2635.38s:  Those are different ways you can roll.
2637.70s:  What I'm emphasizing though is that the statement that you've heard before, the statement
2642.58s:  of you have to roll for a credit.
2644.94s:  Otherwise you're locking in a loss is patently false.
2647.94s:  It's wrong.
2648.94s:  It's dead wrong.
2649.94s:  It is not correct.
2651.98s:  You can roll for a debit and still have a profitable role.
2657.26s:  That's the point I'm trying to make here.
2659.90s:  You do not have to roll for a credit.
2663.10s:  You do have to track the basis of your roles.
2672.18s:  So let me show you.
2677.34s:  If we take a look and we see $3.20 to $9.85, $9.85 to negative $5.25.
2687.82s:  So this if we needed to roll for a credit, that means this number would have to be at least
2696.18s:  $5.26.
2698.34s:  That's the only spot that I would get a credit is if this was $5.26, that gives me a one
2706.86s:  penny credit over this.
2709.98s:  But what I just showed you is I only need 205.
2716.82s:  So that means if I sell this for 250, if I sell this for 250, that is a debit from this.
2728.18s:  That means I'm buying to close this for $5.25.
2731.30s:  I'm giving out $525 and now I'm only taking back in 250.
2738.42s:  That's less.
2739.42s:  That's not a credit that's rolling for a debit.
2742.02s:  But I still make money.
2746.50s:  I would have made $45 in this trade.
2750.42s:  So you do not need to roll for a credit.
2754.50s:  So what that means is in this example, when I go to close this trade to roll my short
2760.14s:  call that's in the money, I do not need to get $525 or better.
2765.74s:  I need to get 205 or better.
2769.42s:  That's to make a profit to better than 205.
2773.30s:  205 would put me at break even.
2774.82s:  So 205 or better was incorrect.
2776.90s:  I should have said 205 for break even or better than 205 for profit.
2783.30s:  So as long as I make 205 or better, I'm now making profit on the roll.
2789.74s:  Super important.
2791.26s:  Super, super important.
2792.58s:  And I'm going to show you why this is so important.
2797.30s:  Let's say I thought and let me close this.
2803.78s:  Let's say that I thought I needed to make the difference here.
2809.58s:  So I need to make $525.
2811.82s:  So now I need to eyeball where can I get $5.25?
2816.62s:  Well I can get it out here at 87.
2820.98s:  So let's use this for the example.
2825.70s:  So now let's say this goes here.
2837.78s:  I realize I grabbed the wrong ones.
2851.94s:  And I'm going to give you two examples.
2854.90s:  So first thing is we know we need to make 205.
2866.42s:  This is what we require.
2868.14s:  So I'm going to give you two example rolls.
2870.02s:  One here, one here.
2872.26s:  I just showed you that we could do the 87.
2875.94s:  That would make us 255.
2884.46s:  So that means from here, we get a 6% change in our basis.
2897.38s:  And then our total profit increase.
2916.38s:  Is this starts at 200.
2922.62s:  And then in this case, in addition to the 200.
2926.54s:  So we can look at this one of two ways.
2929.62s:  We can look at either from what our basis increase
2932.90s:  from the original strike is or from the additional strike.
2936.42s:  So from the additional strike would be this minus this divided
2940.42s:  by this.
2941.26s:  Oh no, times about, let's read, doing the other thing, times this,
2946.14s:  times 100.
2948.90s:  So now it's $500.
2951.10s:  So that means from our original position,
2962.66s:  we've now increased our total profit potential by $700.
2966.34s:  I want to make a really important point here.
2969.66s:  So here, this could be 525.
2977.58s:  That's dyslexia kicking.
2980.22s:  So here, this shows me I would have made, hold on.
2986.46s:  No, I think I messed that up.
2987.34s:  Give me one sec, sorry.
2988.62s:  What is this?
2989.94s:  555, that's it, I bet.
2991.54s:  I knew it was 555.
2995.70s:  So that means we have a 30 cent credit here, right?
2998.02s:  So this plus this.
3000.14s:  So in this transaction, this is worth $30.
3011.06s:  So here's what's happened.
3017.94s:  And let me update, this will be our focus topic for today.
3024.78s:  Rolling options.
3026.02s:  And so we've officially dove down this rabbit hole, which
3029.10s:  is, you know, I'm happy to.
3030.90s:  So we've increased our total profit potential by a certain amount
3037.42s:  of money.
3038.10s:  And I'll show you how we track that.
3043.38s:  This shows our net PNL.
3046.98s:  So this will pretend we'll be $0.
3063.38s:  And what I'm doing is I'm going to sum this
3065.22s:  and then I'm going to give us two scenarios to look at.
3068.62s:  So scenario one will be this scenario.
3073.02s:  Scenario two will be this scenario.
3075.06s:  And I want you to compare something
3076.70s:  so that you can see what my brain sees.
3080.14s:  So hopefully you'll be able to analyze this stuff more
3084.30s:  efficiently.
3088.14s:  So what my brain sees here is if I allow assignment,
3095.06s:  that would be this plus this.
3100.86s:  This I can get rid of because I don't really care.
3105.34s:  So I would sum these two together.
3110.10s:  So that means I would get this amount of money, $350,
3116.50s:  from the options premium.
3119.42s:  And then I would get $500 from the share basis improvement.
3124.90s:  So my total PNL, if I allow assignment in this role,
3129.22s:  is $850.
3131.10s:  And this is me ensuring that I rolled for a credit.
3140.42s:  So this whole thing is scenario one.
3144.38s:  Let's take a look at scenario two.
3146.26s:  Scenario two, we've already identified
3149.98s:  that we just need 205.
3153.18s:  That's all we need in order to get out of this for profit.
3157.02s:  So let's take a look instead at where we can get 205.
3163.34s:  So for 205, we can go all the way out here to the 96.
3170.74s:  So let's take a look at that.
3173.42s:  Actually, no, I want to do it for a small debit, my bad.
3177.06s:  For the example, here, this is a small debit, 97.
3180.14s:  We get it for 204.
3184.14s:  So here we go to the 97.
3189.26s:  This would represent
3196.34s:  an 18% improvement in our basis.
3204.34s:  I should have wrote this formula correctly
3207.54s:  so that I don't have to keep doing this.
3211.02s:  Here we go.
3216.02s:  And then what did I say we get 204?
3220.02s:  So if we close this out for no money,
3229.02s:  we make 204,
3232.02s:  let this down one.
3234.02s:  So from the option side of things,
3238.02s:  we make this plus this.
3244.02s:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
3245.02s:  I said we needed at least 205.
3247.02s:  So that's already rolling for a debit.
3249.02s:  That was my bad.
3250.02s:  So we need this one, my bad.
3252.02s:  We need the 96 for 209.
3254.02s:  That gives us a small total credit.
3257.02s:  So we need the 96 for 209.
3262.02s:  Because again,
3264.02s:  just a quick reminder,
3265.02s:  because I kind of messed that up.
3269.02s:  This represents rolling for a credit.
3271.02s:  This represents rolling for a debit,
3274.02s:  but paying attention to this,
3276.02s:  which is what we actually need
3278.02s:  in order to break even.
3280.02s:  So in this scenario,
3281.02s:  you would have made $4
3286.02s:  on your premiums.
3293.02s:  But guess what you make
3297.02s:  on the trade in total.
3304.02s:  This is the outlier way of rolling option.
3314.02s:  Notice the difference.
3324.02s:  Which one would you prefer to walk away with?
3326.02s:  Would you rather roll for a debit
3329.02s:  and make way more money on your trade?
3332.02s:  Or would you rather follow blindly?
3335.02s:  The statement you've heard of,
3337.02s:  I have to roll for a credit
3340.02s:  and make less money.
3342.02s:  And that's what I'm saying.
3344.02s:  I'm not going to make it.
3346.02s:  I'm not going to make it.
3348.02s:  I'm not going to make it.
3349.02s:  I'm not going to make it.
3350.02s:  I'm not going to make it.
3352.02s:  You're nobody.
3353.02s:  You're going to make it.
3355.02s:  You're going to make it.
3357.02s:  I'm not going to make wished money.
3359.02s:  That's the question here.
3360.02s:  Travel says so you can close for a loss
3364.02s:  and use that capital
3365.02s:  for another trade
3366.06s:  Ultimately making money.
3367.02s:  That could be vued as a roll for credit to.
3369.02s:  That's no.
3370.02s:  That's not this at all.
3376.02s:  Unless you're.
3378.02s:  It might be you might be talking about
3380.02s:  all about how you track some role with a different underlying because ultimately it is to earn
3385.42s:  money and use the capital for the best trade at the time. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah. I don't
3390.34s:  know anybody that would roll into a different underlying because that breaks the purpose of
3394.06s:  a role, right? The again, like, actually, let's just look it up really quick. I bet you
3398.54s:  would be on Investopedia option, rolling, invest the pdf. So Investopedia tells us, oh, here
3415.86s:  we go. This is better because it's not just about rolling down, about rolling in option. Let's
3423.26s:  get rid of this one. This definitely my bad. A role down is accomplished by closing the
3439.70s:  initial contract and opening a new contract for the same underlying asset at a lower strike price.
3444.74s:  Then I think that's like the general understanding of a role is that it's not tied to different
3453.08s:  tickers. Like I don't roll from trading gold into S&P, like they're completely different things.
3458.12s:  The entire premise behind a role is that you're trading a specific ticker. Travel says, yeah,
3467.04s:  but the point is if you get stuck in thinking you must roll for a credit, may not be the best
3470.60s:  thing to do. It's time to look at the bigger picture. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. That's, but that's a
3474.20s:  completely different thing. I would just clarify those two different concepts. Rolling is in the same
3479.08s:  ticker. It's not rolling in different tickers. If you move to a different ticker, it's no longer a
3483.24s:  role. You're just closing for a loss, which you do want to roll anyways, but then you're trading
3488.20s:  something different. The point I'm making more broadly back here is that you don't actually have to
3497.48s:  roll for a credit in order to make money on the trade. That's the main point. You literally make
3504.52s:  65% more money rolling for a debit and prioritizing the basis improvement here from 82 to 96, which
3516.52s:  is a 17% basis improvement versus 82 to 87, which is a 6% basis improvement. Yes. In this scenario,
3525.56s:  the option holder made way more money on the option for the option seller. In this case,
3532.20s:  me, this is what I would do. The option seller made $4 on the options. Doesn't even matter.
3540.76s:  But I would have made $1400 on the underlying. This person doesn't make anything close to that
3550.36s:  on the underlying. They make $500. So almost a third. So that's the broader point here. Is that
3557.48s:  the statement that you've heard at some point of rolling for a credit is complete bullshit.
3563.08s:  You do not have to roll for a credit. Shannan also says so so people who talk about that roll for
3568.44s:  a credit in the quote only talk about each trade, but ignore the whole chain that led there. That's
3574.12s:  exactly correct. And it's a giant mistake in accounting. And this is one of the bigger problems I
3581.56s:  have with trying to come up with blanket rules for things as a trader.
3587.64s:  The blanket rule of roll for a credit is designed to protect you from you. Because if you do not
3595.48s:  track this number right here, you absolutely can roll and lock in a loss, a losing position.
3605.40s:  So the reason why you're told to roll for a credit is literally to give you a generalized
3613.88s:  base rule that over it's just overfitting. It means it allows everything to work in it. But you
3620.28s:  lose so much specificity. You lose a ton of money potential in the trade. So this is showing you
3630.12s:  you don't have to roll for credit. You have to pay attention to the money in and the money out
3635.56s:  throughout the entire trade. And always remember in this instance, when we're talking about short
3640.52s:  calls, is that it's tied to an equity position. And that's always going to be the basis primary driver
3648.76s:  profit mechanism of a covered call or a ratio covered call. This is why I insist that outlier
3657.64s:  traders understand the concept of profit mechanisms. Because if you don't, you might get too wrapped
3664.36s:  up in trying to manage this short call that's in the money. And you might be sitting there saying,
3670.68s:  well, I got to make money on these options. I got to make sure I make some money on these options.
3675.64s:  And it's completely misplaced. You're focused on the wrong thing. This is the quintessential
3682.52s:  example of focusing on the tree and not the forest. That's what happens here, which we obviously
3690.68s:  want to avoid. There's no reason to get so myopic with something like this. So that's the concept
3699.72s:  of rolling and why what you've heard about needing to roll for credit is completely wrong.
3705.88s:  Sean also says, I'm going to be honest, I think you just saved me a lot of money.
3713.48s:  Gonna have to change them things tomorrow at open for sure. Definitely. And this is again,
3722.04s:  this is something it's an artifact of people being told one thing that's just not accurate.
3729.08s:  So yeah, hopefully useful. Cool. So that all aside though, I actually do need to look at,
3737.24s:  let me clear, oops. Clear that out. And I need to look at what I'm actually going to roll this to.
3745.72s:  So we know based on that previous ensemble that I need to make at least two or five,
3755.72s:  because I need this plus this plus this, whatever it is for the net here, hold on.
3766.12s:  No 320. So I need 320. That's what this represents. So now I need to see where I can get that.
3780.36s:  Let's take a look.
3785.16s:  We are right now at the 82. So we can get a really strong basis improvement all the way out here
3792.60s:  to the 93s or the 92s. So this is where this is where I will go. I will probably take them in
3800.52s:  tomorrow. And I have no problem kicking these out 46 days. It's a little bit long. These are paying
3807.08s:  six cents a day in theta. Let's see what the 25s are paying. Actually, I lied. I'm probably going
3812.92s:  to want to come into 25 and tighten these up a lot. So I can take these in. And again, I still need
3819.56s:  that 320, which I can get here at the 88 and a half. So I'll probably take this trade instead.
3827.24s:  I typically prefer rolling less further out in time. So that I maintain strike price,
3835.24s:  spot price sensitivity, meaning I can stay relevant to what the current price of the underlying is.
3840.84s:  So that is likely what this looks like. Fill. What up, fill? Talking about freak a leak. Do you think
3848.76s:  GME is ready to bone? 38. Take a look. And as always, thank you for the $1.99. You know I'm cheap.
3859.40s:  $1.99. I'll drop what I'm doing and take a look at what you want me to. The bout is said,
3865.24s:  I mean, it's kind of sad to realize how cheap that is, but I'm thankful for it.
3871.32s:  38 looks unlikely to me, at least in the near term.
3879.48s:  What do we have? What's the probability?
3883.32s:  Let's say the probability within two weeks of 38, 42%, so less than 50% chance. That does get a lot better.
3905.24s:  If we move out about a month, no, I'm sorry, just over two weeks. It's just a 46.
3911.96s:  And then if we look at about a month,
3917.64s:  that's where it looks possible. 60 and a half, 64% percent.
3924.60s:  So it looks like 38 is less likely in the short term. And I mean, that was my instinct looking at
3931.00s:  the chart, just seeing where things are. It's still doing a great job consolidating, churning, grinding up.
3936.76s:  This is exactly what we want to see, but this kind of behavior just doesn't lend itself to like
3943.32s:  really fast short term moves. That's not what this is at all in its construction. So you can see
3951.80s:  that it has a really steep aggressive trend line here, but it is not looking like it's going to
3960.20s:  lie up and out. So good question. This actually leads into the GME covered strangle. And what we need to do,
3973.08s:  which is I need more risks now, because I've since sized it up to 25k, we're only using 13.
3979.96s:  So that means I need to sell more short puts. Tommy says GME need to buy Bitcoin. That would
3985.56s:  cause a spike. Yeah, I think everybody's obsession with GameStop buying Bitcoin. Honestly,
3991.00s:  it's a little bit misplaced. Like I really, I think that there's nothing wrong with it, but GameStop
3998.28s:  is still a company that has to create revenue. And if it starts going around and buying Bitcoin,
4005.80s:  it again, starts to transfer more into a holding company, which could be fine. Like if that's what it
4011.00s:  wants to do, but that kind of company just takes an entirely different form than a company that's
4021.08s:  still trying to generate and drive revenue. So yeah, my opinion is that
4030.76s:  while nothing wrong with it, I don't think it would be the optimal move as compared to
4037.80s:  finding ways for the stock and the company to drive more revenue. I think ultimately that's
4047.64s:  what it needs. That's my point. Oh, two, I need to get our dinner order rock and roll in here.
4054.92s:  What are you guys thinking for dinner? I think Mel was talking about pizza before, which
4062.04s:  I am not afraid of some pizza. We can do pizza. Oh, no, we'll do Carl Strauss again.
4070.92s:  I bet you that this will, I bet you that this will get through first try.
4076.60s:  We'll see what Mel wants. It's funny. Her and I spend a slightly embarrassing amount of time
4086.28s:  texting one another for two people that live in the same house. It's a little ridiculous,
4091.32s:  but it's kind of hilarious at the same time.
4096.20s:  Especially with the way that our house is set up, you can kind of not know where each other is
4101.48s:  in the house, which is kind of fun. All right, cool. So that wraps up most of the stream. So for
4109.48s:  anybody that feels like popping off, feel free. That's the main stuff. I'm going to hang on for a
4113.64s:  few minutes because I want to run through a few scans. And then I'm happy to take a couple questions
4119.88s:  as well if I'm able to. So if you have anything that you would like us to hit that we didn't feel
4125.88s:  free to throw it in the chat, I'll take a look. And then in the meantime, your boy is going to start
4132.52s:  running through trying to look for some scans. Lauren says I had pizza pizza. That might be tomorrow.
4140.84s:  Yeah, Mel already ordered. It was great. Fast and efficient. Just the way we like it. Let's add this
4152.12s:  beautiful. All right, let me go grab Thor really quick. I'll be right back.
4170.84s:  You
4187.48s:  Well, I thought he was outside the door. But he is not. So he's probably he's probably getting his
4195.64s:  his mom, Sean, which is sick. Travel says yes, I WM, cover what we need.
4203.40s:  Need small caps to participate. I don't think additional rate cuts are it. I think that it is
4210.44s:  recovering. So the fact that it's basing here looks good. But yeah, I mean, it needs a little bit
4217.96s:  more than this. So the thing about small caps is they're likely going to be negatively impacted
4225.64s:  by this for a little while. And things tend to move slow. So that's the that's the cliff notes
4234.68s:  version is I think that we continue to need the company itself or the company, the companies,
4241.24s:  small cap companies, the perform well, which I just don't think the environment is super rich for
4248.60s:  it just yet. So yeah, good question.
4255.96s:  Reset. Hold on, let me get.
4262.28s:  Tommy says when rolling short calls with a ratio called diagonal, do you make sure to roll before
4266.68s:  they go deep in the money? No, not necessarily. It doesn't matter. They don't have to be deep in the
4271.16s:  money. You just have to track the the basis carefully. So a lot of it depends as always on how
4277.24s:  you're wanting to manage the trade and your disposition towards the underlying. But they can be
4281.72s:  super deep in the money. And it's it's really not a problem provided that you're again doing your
4286.28s:  math correctly. What I mean by that is if we go back to this and we think this is fine, I could do
4295.08s:  it over here. Let's say on the long option side of things, you're making $500. But on the short
4301.32s:  call that's in the money, you're losing $200 as it goes deeper and deeper in the money.
4306.44s:  This ratio, let's say that you have five here and two here, these started at an 80 delta,
4314.52s:  these started at a 30 delta. This like these aren't going to overwhelm these delta's provided that
4322.12s:  it's set up properly. So the only time that I would be cautious about the short calls falling
4330.28s:  deep in the money is if you start seeing no extrinsic value and something like a dividends coming
4337.16s:  up. Then yeah, just because you want to avoid assignment, but again, assignment doesn't even really
4341.72s:  matter because you still have this part of the position to offset the risk. So whenever you're
4348.36s:  assigned, you can just sell the calls. Because again, if you get assigned, your risk profile is literally
4355.40s:  the exact same because you have these, you're just not short options anymore, you're short the stock.
4360.36s:  But at the delta ratio is already set. So these, if they're deep in the money, these would be
4366.84s:  trading close to a one delta. You get assigned at a negative one delta, but that variance is already
4373.48s:  captured because these would be in so much profit. So it doesn't really matter. It's just slightly
4380.04s:  more annoying. So if you think that you're at risk of early assignment, then yeah, I would definitely
4386.20s:  roll the calls if I don't want to unwind the position. But that being said, if they fall deep in the
4392.92s:  money, it doesn't matter. The same rules for short calls still apply where the further in the money
4399.96s:  they go, the more you're going to have to fight to get a meaningful adjustment out of them, the
4403.56s:  further out in time, you're going to have to go to get a meaningful adjustment out of them.
4407.00s:  So it really is just going to come down to what you feel like doing with the position, but
4411.40s:  there's no additional risk in reality. If you get assigned early on them, it's just more steps you
4418.60s:  have to take. Tommy says, Matthew says, popped in a high, great to see you, Matt, thanks for jumping
4426.84s:  in. H says, what effect is being added to the chain usually have on a stock if any? Notice 65
4435.80s:  calls were added a few dates for GME, which I was scanning around and not really too much,
4440.92s:  especially because they're so far out of the money. So it's not really going to drive any significant
4445.56s:  underlying behavior from the market makers themselves. They'll just get added as liquidity comes in
4455.00s:  for them. That's why you don't see a ton of strikes offered on stuff that's super far out in time.
4460.68s:  They wait until it comes closer in time where there will be demand for it.
4467.40s:  Reese says when to add kicker options, when you think the underlying is going to run a lot,
4472.28s:  that's the that's the easiest way to answer that. If you think it's going to be a slow,
4477.00s:  steady grind up, then kicker options don't really do you anything. But if something starts moving
4483.56s:  a lot, or if you expect it to have a big aggressive move, then kicker options, that's normally when
4489.88s:  they become part of the equation for me. Lauren says, Fubo did great today. So glad I sold my options
4496.20s:  on Friday. Let's see Lauren, how you did mostly want to see that you sold at a good point. I don't
4503.24s:  care what they did today. Friday. Yeah, I don't see why you would have sold Friday, to be honest.
4513.88s:  Not knowing, you know, that this was going to happen. This is crazy. This is just pure luck. But
4520.04s:  um, this is still not the right time to sell. I feel like you know this enough by now. You should
4525.16s:  know this. It's still going up. You could have scaled out a little bit. That's always okay. But
4534.44s:  when it's doing what you want it to do, you typically don't want to cut yourself short. And
4540.76s:  that's you continue to do that. You've done that a few times now. So I actually would identify that
4546.84s:  as something you have to control for before you put these trades on in the future.
4553.56s:  Again, that's not even accounting for the move that happened today, right? Like you can't tell
4558.36s:  that this is going to happen. It looks like it popped up out of nowhere. There was no expansion and
4562.44s:  volume. So I'm not hindsight being knowing it's going to go up to 506. Nobody knows. But
4568.92s:  the fact that it went from $1.26 to $1.37 to $1.46, like that's still the correct direction.
4577.00s:  Each day, successively.
4582.52s:  Lauren says, I sold it because I thought it was a dud.
4586.20s:  Did you define that before you enter the trade? Meaning if it doesn't do what I wanted to do
4592.12s:  in X time frame, then I'm going to get out. Because if you did that, then I have no problem
4599.56s:  with the trade with you making that decision. But if it was based on like a gut feel or just
4606.12s:  something that's random, then yeah, I would have a problem with that because it doesn't really
4609.40s:  mean anything. It's just based on randomness. It's actually why in Nvidia, why I took my ratio
4619.88s:  called diagonal down. It started doing what I wanted it to do. And I had scaled out on strength,
4626.52s:  which is not my norm. But for me, it was defined by time because trading a ratio called diagonal,
4633.88s:  there was a long option component. So if it's not doing what I needed to do in the correct amount
4637.96s:  of time, then I start taking on risk. So this is an example of managing by time, not so much the price
4645.16s:  movement. So if you Lauren ended up taking that down because it was like a predetermined spot for you
4652.60s:  to take it down, I literally love that. I think that's awesome. That's good following the plan.
4657.08s:  If it was random, which it sounds like by you saying I was cleaning my portfolio for the new year,
4662.12s:  then that's straight trash. And you are better than that. Don't do that. That is a straight trash move.
4669.08s:  Straight trash. And you are better than straight trash. You have to define this stuff before you go
4677.16s:  on. You know this by you already knows it. All right. So I'm going to just spend some time
4690.28s:  doing shit that I normally would do. I need to go on Reddit. I need to respond to a post that I made.
4695.88s:  So I'll keep the stream going just because I'm going to work on stuff. But this is also again,
4700.36s:  a reminder for another great exit point because I'm not going to be looking at the chat quite as much.
4705.40s:  I still will see if you guys have anything that pops out. But otherwise, if you guys feel like
4710.44s:  creeping by all means, if you don't feel like creeping, thank you for coming to hang out. And
4716.12s:  the I think the cadence for this week will be the same. I'm going to look at changing the cadence
4723.88s:  a little next week, I think. And the other thing is for those that are in the outlier pro Patreon,
4731.00s:  I just launched a post and posted in the discord that I'm starting a program outlier trading pairs.
4739.08s:  So what I'm going to do is collect information from you all and I'm going to link you up with a
4743.88s:  trading partner that you're going to meet with every single week for at least 30 minutes up to
4749.40s:  whatever you feel like, but at least 30 minutes you have to commit. And I will give you each week,
4755.16s:  I'll give you an agenda literally for the month ahead of time of what you should be focusing on with
4759.40s:  your partner. So things like focusing on technical analysis, and then I'll give you some ideas on what
4764.92s:  you can do during the calls. It's just to give you ideas so that the calls are productive. So if
4769.48s:  you feel like participating in that and being paired with somebody and you're willing to make that
4773.40s:  commitment, then definitely grab that link. And um,
4781.64s:  and sign up. I hope that you guys will enjoy it. All right. So now I'm just going to run through
4788.20s:  some scans. You already saw one that I had on in the beginning GEV. So this was entered here.
4795.88s:  And I actually think it's probably time for scaling in. So what I'm doing is setting an alert
4803.32s:  to see if there's any sort of pullback, but this is confirmed upside move. It has
4812.68s:  terrible earnings that still reported well somehow. That part I don't fully understand,
4817.88s:  but it absolutely smashed earnings back here. So this one is on the short list of stuff I need to do.
4829.24s:  So this one is. Oops.
4841.48s:  Okay. And oh yeah, I forgot. I was supposed to talk to you guys about doing like the annual
4849.16s:  performance audit. I'm probably just going to have to do that in like a newsletter or something.
4854.20s:  I got a lot of shit I'm supposed to do with respect to videos. So this one I think is just
4861.64s:  going to get added to my writing topics.
4869.88s:  This one.
4871.40s:  All right. And let's run through some of these now. So SMMT. Definitely consolidating.
4891.24s:  And tightening a little bit too. But another fucking therapeutics.
4897.00s:  I need to get rid of these. I think I'm going to update my skin. I just want to get rid of health.
4905.16s:  This health does this too much and it dominates the report is yes.
4912.92s:  This still looks weak man. Lower high. Lower high. Lower low. Higher low. Lower low.
4919.88s:  So this I actually not even going to lie prefer this for a fade.
4927.24s:  Not a lot you can get to the downside. But with a little bit of leverage, it can make sense.
4932.84s:  We'll do that.
4941.16s:  Too wide of ranges. This is done fucking nothing.
4950.44s:  Still as good VRP. I've traded this.
4954.60s:  A couple times it's so liquid though like insanely difficult. I have nothing on in it right now
4962.28s:  because you can't trade it. That's.
4967.32s:  This is definitely consolidating but not in the way that I would want. I need to change
4974.12s:  this consolidation scan. So I'm actually going to update this now while we're on here.
4980.04s:  The issue I have with the consolidation scan is what I'm specifically looking for are things
4988.04s:  that are potentially setting up for breaking out. The other thing that I use the consolidation
4992.60s:  scan for is to search for things that might be good for risk premium style trades.
5003.24s:  Because things that are consolidating, training sideways, they tend to have some sort of
5007.96s:  news or information that's pending that's not out yet. So I might update that. Let's continue
5016.12s:  A and F. No good. He. No good. Man. He chillin. Yeah, like none of these are really.
5031.32s:  I don't really like it. So what I'm doing right now is looking for generally long delta.
5037.32s:  So I don't want any of this. Like this looks interesting.
5045.64s:  Wrong breakout today. So this will also get added to my hit list, the GVWGF.
5055.88s:  And what I look to do is have at least a few.
5062.04s:  Let me grab the chat, by the way, I can at least see you guys over here.
5074.52s:  Okay. David says GV is going nuclear. Is that a pun or are they actually like adopting nuclear
5082.92s:  energy? Did you guys see the thing by N Ron? This.
5089.16s:  Himmit. This. You guys see this?
5103.40s:  Micro nuclear reactor for your home. That is about as fucking cool as it can get.
5112.36s:  That is so sick. I didn't retweet this yet.
5117.72s:  I'm a need. A couple of these eggs.
5127.64s:  Fucking sick.
5131.72s:  The Johnson's look up their history. I mean, they've been around for a long time. They've had
5135.72s:  issues before. But super cool. I just thought that technology is speaking of going nuclear.
5142.60s:  That just looks awesome. All right. Let me get back into my screeners.
5149.16s:  VGS. So this one's on the list.
5154.76s:  Rocket lab. How's rocket lab doing? Ah, rocket lab looks okay. Finally.
5160.20s:  Soft breakout. But I don't hate this at all.
5180.36s:  So this looks like what do you think got to the June's a little more liquid?
5186.20s:  What is this? 798 and got the July's about the same with.
5203.80s:  Yeah, this looks good. 40 cents. The liquid on some of these though.
5211.16s:  I have to be pretty discerning. The atom ones are okay.
5214.92s:  The data is about two pennies. Two pennies all the way out. So I would favor the gamma on these.
5224.20s:  I would take something with like a three. Oh no, hold on. I'm fucked up.
5230.44s:  The data is three pennies. Gammas two. Yeah, okay. Gammas two all the way around.
5237.16s:  I would take the slightly cheaper.
5243.00s:  The data. Look at this bad Larry.
5252.12s:  Stop.
5252.60s:  Stop.
5257.48s:  Seven.
5261.88s:  Oh, lace.
5264.68s:  Initial stop would be here. 25.
5268.28s:  One. Oops.
5271.24s:  Add.
5273.88s:  25.
5278.44s:  21.
5282.68s:  This is good. So then for standard modeling, $100,000 account, something around half a percent,
5293.16s:  something like this. You get like a three lot. Your pain.
5300.20s:  Two pennies a day in theta.
5302.20s:  So if you come in to like 25 days,
5310.76s:  here, you're getting five pennies, four pennies.
5315.96s:  So I would come in to something like this. These 37s, whatever is most liquid when the market
5320.28s:  is trading. You get your 84 cents. This covers the entire extrinsic value while you're in.
5332.52s:  For six, we need a little bit more. We need these sixes.
5339.00s:  A bed. So for those that don't know what I'm doing here is I'm seeing what my extrinsic value is
5344.12s:  here. So on these, I'm paying on the 29s that I would be buying. I'm paying two pennies a day.
5350.68s:  And I'm getting a three contract. So that means I need six cents a day to overcome that theta.
5358.12s:  So if I come in here, I can get six pennies at a 35 delta. That's a little too much for me.
5364.52s:  I don't want to be at a 35 delta. I come in.
5373.32s:  These are also 35 delta. So I probably would take it.
5377.80s:  Take these or these slightly less. I think that's okay. I'm not worried too much about the theta
5383.56s:  because the primary profit mechanism in this is still direction. It's not for
5389.64s:  expecting it to be rotating sideways for too long. I just want to offset some of it if it does,
5394.76s:  which is exactly what these do. So this, for example, would leave me exposed on a penny.
5402.20s:  That's a jet. So rocket lab will be added to the list.
5407.00s:  And back to this.
5411.08s:  Enter.
5416.36s:  And videos back on. I still think it needs to overcome that recent move. UAL.
5428.44s:  Has earnings coming up.
5436.60s:  And CEG. I've been in and out of these guys for a while. This looks really good.
5446.76s:  They have super cool tech.
5452.36s:  TSM is showing up. Yeah, boy. Solid break.
5460.28s:  Really solid break up. The stop goes here.
5466.54s:  Let's look at see.
5471.72s:  Fucking a.
5477.88s:  These literally breaking out. That's nuts.
5482.92s:  I was expecting that right?
5487.88s:  The ultraviolet or cathode darling on Совert,
5490.52s:  by the way, allowed this Artable Knowledge.
5495.08s:  For them you'll often find it the winner
5496.20s:  What is the positioning for earnings?
5506.72s:  The earnings are what?
5509.84s:  15th for the 17 Jan?
5516.44s:  Polish really bullish for something like this?
5525.04s:  Let me take a bite on that.
5527.40s:  I don't really have exposure to financials.
5530.80s:  Okay.
5534.80s:  All right.
5542.80s:  Wait.
5543.80s:  All right, gang.
5544.80s:  I'm a hop off.
5545.80s:  I'm going to work on a couple of videos.
5547.80s:  Thanks for hanging out, taking a look at some stocks.
5549.80s:  If you guys need anything, hit me up in the discord.
5551.80s:  Be an outlier.
5552.80s:  I will see you all later.
