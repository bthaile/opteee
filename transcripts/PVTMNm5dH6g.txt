0.00s: The ratio put diagonal is my hands down favorite bearish options trading strategy.
6.96s: So I'm going to walk you through how it makes money, how to set them up, how to scan for
11.28s: them, how to manage.
12.28s: I'm going to give you an example of a trade that I had earlier this year that shows the
15.88s: full life cycle and decision cycle along the entire path.
18.96s: I'm going to show you trade that I have on right now so that you can see how I found
22.32s: it.
23.32s: And then at the end of the video, I'm going to go through a couple questions from our
25.92s: Discord members, which you should join.
28.60s: And as you can tell, there's a lot of detail going to be in this video.
31.60s: That's by design.
32.60s: So it's going to be long feel free to skip around as needed.
34.96s: But I want you to have a good reference benchmark for the ratio put diagonals because
39.44s: this is a staple of mine.
41.16s: Now if you're familiar with the channel ratio diagonals will be very familiar to you
45.12s: because I trade them quite literally all the time.
47.76s: It gives me a bit of a more adjustable risk reward profile, which we'll talk about.
52.88s: So the ratio put diagonal in a nutshell, it's a directionally leveraged trading strategy
58.76s: designed to benefit from the downward price direction of something, whatever it is that
63.60s: you're trading.
65.00s: And it has a few legs.
67.20s: You'll see that there's two primary legs and then there's kind of this optional leg,
71.40s: which we'll get into in a little bit.
72.76s: But the primary leg to start with is an in the money put that's greater than 60 days
77.72s: to expiration.
78.72s: So let's talk about those two components specifically.
81.92s: Why in the money?
83.12s: Why greater than 60 days to expiration?
85.64s: Great questions.
87.28s: The first question of why in the money?
92.12s: This allows me to do two things simultaneously.
96.44s: The first thing is I limit my theta decay.
99.96s: The further in the money you go, the more expensive your option will be, but the less time
106.16s: value and the more intrinsic value will be in that option.
110.84s: So if you get the moves that you want, you're paying more upfront, but you're going to
115.08s: recoup the vast majority of that cost, even if it doesn't move much, because it's intrinsic
120.04s: value that doesn't decay.
121.84s: The second most important thing is you get a better dollar for dollar move in the underlying.
127.72s: What does that mean?
128.72s: Let's take a look.
129.72s: The example that we're going to use for the previous trade is oh, and I originally started
136.24s: trading this to the downside a while ago when real estate was doing really poor, the beginning
140.52s: of this year.
141.68s: So what I had on will walk through all of that.
144.92s: I'm just going to use it as an example now for some of the options selection criteria.
151.08s: So if oh goes down by one dollar, if I have something like these 91 delta puts, I get
158.04s: 91 cents for the dollar.
160.80s: So that means that as oh is moving, I'm seeing as much of that same move as I can with the
166.20s: options.
167.20s: What's the downside?
168.20s: They're more expensive.
170.12s: The other downside is your options aren't going to get those massive thousand percent
174.88s: compounding returns without a huge move.
178.24s: So you have to figure out what's right for you.
179.76s: And this is why we also add those kicker options sometimes.
184.56s: And the way to think about those kicker options, at least for me, is if I have some sort of
189.80s: stronger conviction and I really want to try to amplify the potential move, if I'm correct,
194.68s: I will buy cheaper out of the money options.
197.72s: Either the same expiration or closer in time, depending on what the chains look like.
202.48s: And what those do is they don't give me a big profit if we get a smaller move.
208.72s: So if oh moves two, three bucks, let's say we grab these 50s delta puts is the kicker
214.84s: is it doesn't really matters.
215.92s: Not going to benefit us that much.
217.84s: But if oh for whatever reason, craters in falls out of bed, these will compound very quickly
223.48s: gain a lot of gamma very quickly.
225.72s: And then these can actually add a lot of profit potential.
229.08s: So this is kind of like a lower probability play that can amplify the overall return profile.
236.00s: So we now know why I select the delta that I do.
240.80s: My general approach here is in the money.
243.76s: So that means greater than 50 delta.
245.76s: The vast majority of the time it will be greater than a 60 delta.
249.36s: Sometimes I will go as far as a one delta.
251.56s: My typical target is around 80 delta.
254.84s: Now this is completely predicated on the options chain.
258.60s: So for example, if this was the trade I was looking at 94 DTE, which we'll talk about
263.08s: why that DTE is compared to something else in a second.
267.36s: But if we take a look, the 59s or the 91s, which would I pick, I actually would pick
273.48s: the 59s.
275.00s: Why?
276.00s: Because of liquidity.
277.20s: This is something that a lot of traders, especially smaller traders don't think much about
280.80s: because fortunately, if you're trading a one lot of two lot, it doesn't really matter.
284.40s: But if you're trading a 50 lot, a hundred lot, this is actually super limiting.
288.76s: So you'll find that these odd strikes, like the 57 and a half, the 62 and a half, they
294.48s: will have much lighter liquidity than the standard strikes, like 60, 55, so on and so forth.
300.80s: So part of it is finding the right mix, balancing all these different things, which does absolutely
308.56s: include liquidity.
310.04s: The reason why liquidity is so important is because as you go further out in time, liquidity
313.96s: will lighten.
314.96s: As you go deeper in the money, liquidity will lighten.
317.52s: So you can't be two hands off with your attention to liquidity because you need to exit
327.24s: the trade.
328.56s: That's how you make money in this thing.
329.84s: You have to be able to sell the long options for a big profit.
333.92s: So if you're trading something that you're really forcing, trying to get your way in, that
338.20s: can be really difficult in order to find a reasonable exit point.
343.76s: So that's why you have to find a balance specifically with respect to liquidity in the
348.04s: options chain.
349.44s: Now as we look at the different expirations, we know Theta decay accelerates once you
354.20s: get within 60 DTE.
356.52s: So the vast majority of the time, my long options will be greater than 60 DTE.
363.04s: I will then bracket by how long I'm expecting to hold the trade.
367.60s: Sometimes I'll go 90 DTE.
369.72s: Sometimes I'll go 180.
371.12s: Sometimes I'll go way out over a year.
373.28s: If it's something I'm really expecting to hold for the long term to the downside.
377.96s: So it's completely variable depending on how long I expect to hold the trade.
383.32s: Sometimes I'll even go into 30 DTE.
385.52s: If it's something I'm expecting to hold for a week, maybe up to two weeks, but about
389.44s: a week, 30 DTE is fine because you're not holding it that long and by going deeper
394.88s: again in the money, you still limit your Theta decay.
397.84s: So you can again figure out what expiration makes sense for you.
402.60s: The further out in time you go, the longer your trade has to work in your favor, the lighter
409.20s: your Theta decay is going to be, the more expensive your options are going to be.
414.80s: So you got to figure out what's right for you there.
418.20s: Now let's talk about the rest of this structure.
422.52s: I just walked through all of the details essentially on thinking about the put that you might
427.68s: purchase for the short out of the money puts.
431.36s: These are secondary.
433.56s: So the primary profit mechanism, the driver of profit in this trade is the long puts.
439.04s: You cannot forget that.
440.68s: So when we're adding these short puts, they're designed to amplify the returns.
445.20s: They give us a little bit of premium upfront.
446.92s: They help us offset the cost of gamma or leverage depending on what delta you pick for
452.12s: your longs.
453.88s: These are designed simply to supplement the position.
457.36s: I bring that up because what you don't want is to try and get too greedy and collect
462.36s: too much money upfront via the short options and then cap or even worse, induce more risk
470.32s: if you get an accommodating move, which I'll show you what that looks like in a second.
474.64s: So the short options, it's kind of the inverse thought process as the end of money options.
478.80s: I'm going to go less than 60 to E for short.
480.80s: The vast majority is going to be less than 40 even closer around 20 days maybe.
484.12s: They're going to be out of the money because I want them to decay as quickly as possible.
488.08s: Now there's some considerations around what strike price you pick.
492.04s: This strike price is selected via delta.
494.68s: This strike price is kind of baked off of this one.
499.40s: So we have to be thoughtful and it's not as simple as if we buy, let me grab this.
508.56s: It's not as simple as if we buy, let's say, this 57 and a half.
514.16s: It's not as simple as just saying, well, we sell something lower than that because the
517.68s: delta's matter actually quite a lot and we'll get a little further into detail on how
522.84s: to think about the delta's in the position.
525.20s: So if I go to a risk profile, just to show you what this thing could look like.
529.76s: Here we have the standard ratio, but diagonals.
534.96s: Let me give you another way so it's a little easier for you to see.
538.12s: You don't have to worry about all of these other boxes and stuff.
541.24s: This is actually the old positions that I had, but here's our base trade, the long puts.
547.64s: As you can tell, we have unlimited profit potential.
551.24s: We have cap downside risk and we suffer theta K. Then we can add short options on top of
556.92s: it.
558.56s: In this example, for the short options, I went out 31 days to expiration and I picked
564.12s: something that was like a 12 delta.
566.08s: Again, you can go closer to add the money and if we want to take a look at what an example
571.44s: of that might look like, if I grab five of these and throw them in, I'm sorry, the further
578.32s: out of the money ones.
581.76s: These ones.
584.08s: So this is essentially the difference between those two and it won't look like much on this.
588.64s: You need to actually look at the P and L of the open if we get in a accommodating move.
593.36s: So let's say this line right here, if we go down by one standard deviation, this trade
600.16s: makes $8500.
601.76s: That's using the further out of the money puts.
604.56s: If we use the closer puts and we get that one standard deviation move, we get $79.80.
610.48s: So why is that?
611.44s: Well, because these are a higher delta, they're going to start chewing into your profit factor
616.08s: a little bit quicker because of the delta.
618.40s: So what's the trade off here?
620.08s: Well, if you go closer to the money, you're going to make a little bit more money up front.
623.44s: I'm getting 72 cents here as compared to 15 cents here.
627.60s: Again, that's the next threshold you have to cross when you're choosing what options to select.
632.32s: We know how to select the long option for the short option.
635.92s: Once you get your expiration, depending on what fits in with your portfolio,
640.32s: then you have to figure out which delta within there.
643.52s: And this is the first trade off.
645.12s: The trade off is the higher delta you pick for your short puts.
648.88s: You're going to collect more money up front, but you're going to give up more profit potential.
653.76s: You've got to find what works for you.
655.28s: For me, it'll typically baked around a 30 delta or less.
659.52s: I really want to give as much possible profit potential to the base of the position, which is the
665.44s: long put.
666.64s: The other thing you'll notice is notice how light of a ratio this is.
670.96s: In this scenario, we're long 30 of these in the money puts and only short five.
677.60s: Why is that?
678.64s: Well, we're not going to collect a bunch of money up front.
681.20s: That's pretty clear.
682.40s: However, if we start adding more, let's say we do 10, you collect way more money up front.
688.88s: But then notice what happens to your P&L if you get that one standard deviation down move.
693.20s: Now it's at 7,016 as compared to what you just saw at 7980.
701.04s: So this becomes an assessment of your conviction of the trade and how you want to produce returns.
708.48s: This is exactly the name of the game here.
711.28s: Now, the reason why I do a ratio is because if you look at a standard diagonal, which might have
718.00s: one to one or something like that, you actually end up with risk if it goes too far in your
725.20s: favor.
725.68s: And I don't want that.
726.80s: I want to have as much profit potential as possible, but I don't want any risk in my direction.
732.64s: Now, quick admin note.
734.24s: The reason why in this case with the 30 longs and the 30 shorts, it's the same,
738.64s: meaning there's no risk to the downside, which is where I would make profit,
742.72s: is because of the delta I picked.
744.16s: These are such a high delta they will cap out before these, but that will change as the long
748.80s: delta's move.
750.32s: So just an important note, the ratio is important to maintain.
753.60s: It might be a little bit misleading in the beginning of the trade because of something like that.
756.96s: If you're selecting your delta's really carefully.
759.60s: So, then comes the question, how many of them do you sell?
764.72s: It depends entirely on how much money you want to collect upfront, and then how much profit
769.04s: potential do you want to give up to collect that money upfront?
772.00s: Only you can answer that.
773.44s: For me, I typically would try to keep a few shorts on to offset some of the cost of time decay,
781.04s: but it is a secondary profit factor.
784.32s: Another thing is a lot of times the short option won't even go on at the same time as the long.
789.20s: Again, it depends on the underlying and what it's doing, but very frequently,
792.88s: I'll buy the longs and give them a day or two, even to see if my move is confirmed before I
798.40s: start adding the shorts, and then I'll add the shorts, and you'll see a little bit more about that
802.56s: in a hot minute.
805.44s: So, that's the base structure.
807.28s: You now know a little bit about the kickers.
809.04s: I don't want to spend too much time on that because it's really a tertiary profit factor,
813.68s: but you know enough about them now to understand why they exist and why they're part of this.
819.68s: So, what's the overall management approach here?
822.40s: For me, it's really simple.
823.44s: It's based on the charts.
824.88s: I'm going to primarily focus on technical analysis in selecting where I think something might go,
831.20s: how I'm going to manage risk, and then I'm going to attempt to follow the trend.
834.72s: That's the main management approach here.
837.28s: So, my profit target will be defined before I enter, as will my stops.
842.88s: They will be defined before I enter.
845.44s: Now, a couple other notes that are important to track with this kind of strategy,
849.44s: and this is where it starts to get a little complicated, you can simplify it if you want,
853.36s: and I'll explain how when we get to that.
855.44s: But, the way you simplify this entire strategy is if you're in the scenario where your short
864.40s: puts fall in the money, meaning it's moved in your favor a lot, and now the underlying you
870.72s: have short puts that will be losing money.
873.84s: The way you simplify this entire strategy is if that happens, you buy to close the short puts,
882.88s: get rid of them, and then you sell to close the long puts the entire position.
888.72s: That's the simplest way to trade this, again, if you want to keep it super simple.
892.56s: Once you get your move, you close the shorts, close the longs, move on with your day.
898.08s: Now, quick, add me a note on that.
900.16s: More often than not, what I will do is sell maybe five of the longs first.
907.12s: I just want to assess liquidity, get a sense of where the market is, so that I know what I'm
911.52s: walking into with the rest of the exit of the trade, and then I'll unwind the short options,
918.00s: and then go back and finish unwinding the long options.
921.68s: Again, minor detail, not a huge deal, but something to be aware of.
925.60s: That's the simple scenario here.
927.60s: Now, the more complex scenario includes if your short options fall in the money,
933.36s: we don't want to just book a loss on the short options.
936.96s: So going back to this as an example, let's say these 52 and a half puts, which are trading for
942.48s: 72 cents now. Let's say that the underlying, we get a big move in our favor and the
947.84s: underlying is now down at 50. Well, these 52 and a half are going to be showing a loss,
953.20s: because they will be worth more at this point. So if you close those, you're just going to
957.68s: eat that loss. And I don't like doing that because I also want to make sure that I'm not realizing
963.36s: losses and not realizing corresponding gains that then can go away and also be losses.
970.80s: That's a terrible scenario. So what that could look like to play that out is if O drops,
976.64s: it goes down here to again, 50, you're like, okay, this is moving big in my favor.
981.44s: I want to get rid of the drag from the short options and just let it be all long options from
986.40s: here. Let me get rid of these. I'll buy them at a loss. It's okay because these are making a bunch
990.96s: of money. Okay, so then you do that. But then what happens if O just rallies back?
996.56s: Now the profit that you were using mentally to cover this loss is now gone. And now this can
1002.16s: even turn to a loss. So whenever I'm adjusting in the money, short puts in this trade, I'm either
1009.84s: going to be rolling them to defer the loss or I'm going to be selling long puts to cover that loss,
1016.72s: which is important to track. And that actually leads into what this concept of a critical strike is.
1022.08s: So this is again, a quick synopsis of what we just looked over. So I'm giving this for you kind
1028.32s: of a general reference. We can skip over it. And I want to give you some important kind of formulas
1034.56s: and stuff. Don't let this overwhelm you. You can take your time looking at it and you can even
1039.04s: modify some of these. But I'm going to walk through what the critical strike is. What the long
1044.72s: option basis is and what the short put lots are. Here we go. The critical strike tracks the overall
1056.32s: position so that we know where we can sell short puts against the longs without potentially locking
1066.96s: in a loss. That's the purpose here. So at the beginning of the trade, you can sell pretty much
1072.48s: anything at the money. But what happens is as the trade moves around, as these deltas move around,
1080.88s: sometimes unfavorably, it changes where you can sell short options against the longs and not
1090.08s: lock in a loss. Now the other cool part is depending on your platform and you don't want to do that
1095.44s: math. You don't have to. The platform can do it. So in this case, our short put strike is 52 and a half.
1101.28s: If we go to 52 and a half, we can clearly see that we have a profit there. Great. No problem.
1106.00s: But you have to pay really close attention to that because there can be instances where if you're
1111.04s: getting more and more aggressive with your short puts that you can lock in a loss and especially
1116.64s: with my methodology of selling the longs to cover the shorts, that can absolutely lock in a losing
1122.64s: position. So that's what this is designed to do and this is how you calculate it. You take the strike
1126.80s: price, the stock price, sorry, stock price, less, the long option basis, minus the long option value,
1134.24s: divide that by the long option delta. That essentially tells you where your critical strike,
1138.16s: where you can start offering short options. Now to get over to this one to skip to this for a second,
1145.92s: this tells us how many you can sell at the current delta. So essentially, if I input a delta here,
1155.44s: this will populate a number for me. Now again, you don't even have to do this. You can just
1160.88s: essentially assess based on what your preference is for P&L, where you want to set your shorts up.
1167.76s: Do you want to have five, 10, 15, 20? If you're doing anything in this trade, you've got to be able to
1172.80s: buy more than one long option, at least two, so that you can at least maintain some sort of ratio,
1179.68s: right? You can have two longs one short. This just makes sure that we're not selling too many
1187.04s: shorts against the longs, that if we get a big move in our favor, that we can eventually start
1193.68s: looking at a loss. And again, to show you what that looks like in the platform, if I start clicking
1199.52s: this, essentially when there's up in this case, downside risk to the trade, I'm just doing way too
1206.88s: many just to make it more apparent. But when there's risk in our profit favor, meaning down on the
1213.92s: long puts, when there was risk in that direction, there's too many. That means that your short
1218.48s: deltas can overwhelm your long deltas, leading to again, risk in that direction that I don't want.
1226.72s: So that's what allows me to track that. And again, your platform can do it just like I'm doing it
1232.08s: right there by clicking that button. No big deal. Next up, we have the adjusted long option basis.
1240.00s: This is also really simple. When I'm looking at this, I want to make sure I know what the actual
1247.28s: basis of the long option is, including the total cost of the trade. So what I do is I modify the
1254.96s: total cost. This is the total cost of the open options. And then I will take a look at the PNL
1263.12s: include those. And then I will divide that by the number of long options remaining times 100,
1270.00s: because that's the multiplier for options. And then this will help me understand what the basis I
1274.56s: can work with on the long options, accounting for the closed in the money puts. In this case,
1281.92s: this should be put not called that's that. So again, some of this stuff might be a little
1289.76s: confusing. Take your time looking at it. This is just all internal tracking for me. You don't have
1295.68s: to do this. If you have a platform like think or swim like I showed you, it literally will show you
1299.84s: all of this for you. You don't have to worry about it. I think it's a good exercise to build this
1304.48s: personally, but you don't have to. So that's kind of the basis of the trade. Now I want to work
1311.36s: through an example with you. So let's take a look at this. This is O back on 22 Jan. O is trading
1320.96s: around 5575. You can see kind of where it was right here. And this was the opening trade. These were
1328.96s: in the money, the 60 puts. I bought them for $5.25. And then I sold 10 of the 55 puts against it
1336.48s: at 87 cents. So this was designed to be about a $20,000 trade in total. And the initial debit was
1343.84s: kind of the majority of the position. And I tend to like to do it that way. I like being able to
1349.52s: phase into the trade if I get minor moves against me or if I get a big price accommodating factor
1355.60s: in my favor. I like having some money to be able to add to the trade depending on my hypothesis.
1360.80s: And this is what it looked like. The way that I found this trade is it showed up on a break
1366.88s: down scanner that I run. And this was also within an underperforming sector. I like to stack
1374.56s: strength with respect to my directional trades. So if I want to trade something to the downside,
1379.92s: I like it when other things that are like it are also going down. Just adds a lot of weight to it.
1385.52s: It helps things move in my favor in general. So the overall outlay for the position here was
1392.40s: that 15 750. And then I collected a 870 credit. So in this case, 30 longs 10 shorts. I'm weighing
1399.92s: way more heavily the profit potential for the longs. Now the way I look at establishing a stop in
1407.04s: something like this is I will either use the high of the day depending on what that looks like in
1413.44s: the individual ticker or I'll use near term resistance wherever I can best see it. That's how I
1419.84s: will make sure that I'm using stuff that makes sense on the chart. And then I will make sure that
1425.92s: I'm okay with the resulting potential risk to the position. So for example, if I look at these 30 60
1433.12s: puts and I put them on for 525. And then I look at where I think let's just say let me grab this.
1440.72s: Let's just say that I think it's something around the resistance. Let's just say I think it's
1447.92s: something like way up here, whatever. If I use this and I think, okay, that's where my stop would be.
1453.92s: What would my P and L on this position be at that stop? And am I okay with it? If I'm not, I either
1460.24s: need to have a tighter stop accepting the fact I'm probably going to get stopped out or I need to
1465.44s: size down the position so that the risk makes sense for what I'm putting on. So on the 26 of Jan,
1473.76s: there was kind of an interesting scenario where there was an immediate small price accommodation.
1480.88s: Once we started accelerating to the downside. So I like this example because it walks through
1488.16s: how I try to remain sensitive to the position. So when I entered on the 22nd of Jan,
1495.84s: a few days went by it started breaking down and I started seeing this weight carrying it down.
1502.80s: So when I saw that I could get out of those shorts for the cheap, right? The difference here is
1509.20s: minimal. The overall debit paid 950. I lose 120 bucks, but this is a scenario where it's starting to
1516.32s: break down. I want to let it break down and I don't want these shorts to get in the way.
1521.44s: So in this case, I don't add more shorts to the position. I want to let it break down. And that's
1527.52s: why I cleared these out earlier. Again, you don't have to do that. You can just let it run its course
1532.24s: until you get to the expiration of the options, but I'm very involved in the position personally.
1537.60s: So at this point, the realized P and L for the position is negative 120 bucks. And then the long
1542.96s: put unrealized P and L unrealized is 1200 bucks. This is important. So at this point, I'm eating $12
1550.64s: and I'm very carefully monitoring it. Now, if I was being by kind of the standard textbook or if
1557.52s: this was a bigger loss that I just don't care about, I absolutely would have unwound some of these
1563.68s: longs to cover the cost, the loss of this short. So in that scenario, I would say, okay, out of my 30,
1571.12s: how many do I have to sell to make more than $120? That's how I would net that out.
1577.52s: For me, this is a small enough loss that I just don't care. It didn't matter to me into the position.
1583.12s: This didn't balloon enough. You'll see an example of those others in a second. So we fast forward time.
1591.20s: Here is essentially day after and we see this candle. What do you guys think? Do you think I should sell
1598.80s: more short puts here? Should I not sell more short puts? Any thoughts?
1603.76s: From in the comments, what I ended up doing here was waiting. Why did I wait even though it looked
1609.04s: like it was starting to base is I wanted to see. So for example, if this started heavily trending
1615.36s: sideways, I absolutely would have been okay with selling puts at that point, but it just started
1622.32s: to break down. So I wanted to give it time to continue breaking down. So we fast forward. And again,
1628.88s: those that let me take this away, you can see essentially how this trail down and then what it
1637.12s: turned into from that point, which was pretty big update, but then it came back down.
1643.52s: So overall, giving the trade as much room to move in my profit factor is the goal. So you can see now,
1649.76s: what I'm doing is sliding down my stops. I'm following the trade down. Now these aren't hard
1657.84s: stops. These are soft stops. My hard stop would still be at this point at the original P&L of the
1663.12s: trade, meaning I would want to be able to get out at flat at worst now that I've had this much
1669.04s: of a price accommodation. But I want to give it enough room to work, but I'm going to follow along
1673.60s: with it pretty closely. So the way I would use these is by phasing out until I get to a hard
1679.28s: cut point, because as I phase out, essentially what happens is I now have the ability to book a profit
1689.52s: at a higher level at the lower stops and then a slightly lower level at the medium stops and
1694.32s: all the way up. It allows the position to walk out of these some profit, even if I'm being stopped
1698.72s: out on the way up. Now on the 16th of Feb, what I ended up doing was now selling to open 15
1706.32s: of the 15 March 50 puts. Why do you think I did that? Well, because it clearly started showing
1713.84s: signs of strength. Take a look at the difference in these scenarios. In this case up here,
1720.00s: it started showing a little bit of strength and then it fell off a cliff. Here we have one day,
1726.96s: two day, three day, and then a big green upward candle on this fourth day. So that means that it
1734.16s: opened way down here and then it surged all the way up and closed up here. So to me, this looks
1739.84s: like it's starting to post some near term strength, which is exactly why on this candle specifically,
1745.92s: I was willing to offer more of these short puts. So those brought in a credit of 6.75. I still
1751.68s: had a realized loss of 120 from up here and then an unrealized PNL now of 8775. So here's the net
1759.44s: on the trade. Next, we go to 8 March. So as you can see, this is where I sold those puts and you
1766.96s: can see how the underlying behaved since I sold those puts. You can see where my stop is now,
1772.08s: we are starting to get real, real close. So in this case, what I ended up doing was taking these
1777.52s: puts down for a pretty big profit. I sold them for 45, took them in for 8 cents. So that gives me
1783.52s: 555 bucks. That'll clear this loss out and put something in my pocket. And then the unrealized on
1790.08s: the long options came down a little bit. And the reason why that came down a little bit is because
1795.92s: the underlying started to go up. So that was the wrong direction for the thesis here. Involatility
1801.36s: started contracting. So I offered 10 of the 19 April 52 and a half for $1.20 that brought in
1810.56s: $1,200. These were a higher delta now. I'm getting closer to the current spot price. Notice
1815.92s: it was trading at $5288. I got an empty $525. Why did I go so close? Because I can collect way more
1821.68s: money and it looks like the move might be about done. So this is exactly why I take it from here to
1828.40s: here. And as I sense it's starting to base. This is a long time that's trending sideways now.
1834.24s: As I sense it's starting to base and the trade might be drying up, I will start repositioning
1839.20s: the way that I set the trade up. But notice how I don't close the trade because I think it's
1843.20s: drying up. Who knows? This could fall off a cliff and keep going to the downside. As you could tell
1848.40s: on purposely pulling up the charts at the time so that you could see what I saw at the time.
1853.36s: In hindsight, everything is super clear. But right now I don't know. It looks like it's
1857.68s: basing. It looks like it's starting to gain some strength. But it also does absolutely look like
1862.88s: it could roll over if it can't break up above this. That was the thesis at the time. And
1869.36s: we get stopped out. So it trends sideways for a bit more. It looks like it's starting to accelerate
1875.04s: to the downside. And then it gains its feet back. And then we get stopped out right up here.
1881.28s: So this was the closing trade. I bought to close the puts that I sold for a dollar 20,
1888.00s: closed them at 55. And then I sold all of the long options for $6.80. So this trade came out up
1897.04s: $57.35, which is a 36.4% return on invested capital. Pretty simple trade overall. I didn't go
1906.80s: through the cycle of selling some of the longs to cover the shorts. I only had one scenario where
1911.36s: I was closing in the money shorts. And this is more so how I kind of prefer these trades to unfold
1918.08s: in their entirety. Like pretty simple. Now the big thing that I want you to notice here is this
1923.28s: isn't a small move, but it's not a big move. So we're ended up entering. It was trading around
1927.68s: 56. And I only got like a three point move. It's not much. But it was still enough with leverage to
1932.96s: walk away with something on that money. Again, making 57 hundred bucks on 16 is not bad at all.
1939.12s: So that's how that trade essentially played out. It popped up via a breakdown scan. I knew it was
1945.12s: going to be a shorter term trade. And by selecting essentially the delta that I did, which was around
1952.80s: is 75. It found a really good basis and the days to expiration on the original leg. You can see
1960.24s: again, the out to 17 main from Jan. So I ended up going here for the sake of liquidity. Because
1968.96s: when you're trading these kinds of things, you cannot forget about liquidity. All right, let's take
1974.08s: a look at some of these questions. The first one from Don't Ask is how much time and effort do you
1979.52s: put in thinking through the path of the trade about zero? It doesn't matter. I have a hypothesis
1985.04s: when I enter the trade and then I am defining my profit and loss on entry based on my best guess.
1990.48s: But the path it takes to get to either of those two points and don't really care about. I'm going
1994.72s: to kind of see how it flows. Then this one is if your long option moves to at the money, meaning
2002.16s: it's going in the wrong direction. And you honestly think you were just early. Do you reset it or
2007.28s: ride it out? It's a moot point, right? Because again, the PNL is defined on entry. So this will be
2012.16s: defined before I even enter. If it's at the stop, I get out. If it's not at the stop, I don't get
2016.16s: out. Simple as that. Can you go too far out in time with the long option where the structure doesn't
2021.84s: make sense? This supplies if you're using a really low delta. The reason why it applies if you're
2026.24s: using a really low delta is if you go super far out in time and you have like a 10 delta, there's no
2031.92s: gamma there either. So even if you get a big move, you're not going to see most of it. If you have a
2037.36s: long in the money option with a high delta at 90 plus 80 plus, you're going to see most of the move
2042.88s: anyways. So it doesn't really matter. The next thing would be liquidity here.
2046.80s: Situation where you would consider adding the kicker at any point during the trade between the short
2051.12s: and long option. I think I covered that a little bit before. That's mostly just if I'm expecting
2056.16s: some sort of big directional move in my favor. And I want to be able to compound more efficiently.
2062.40s: Next question from a boy, Shreja, Shreja says, I think it pretty much covers it. Maybe you could
2067.04s: highlight differences in management compared to a ratio called diagonal. Not much. I mean, it's obviously
2072.24s: trading to the downside. So the way that you analyze downside moves might be slightly different. It
2076.64s: is for me, a stock can really fall under its own weight as compared to what it needs to be supported
2082.64s: up through these really voracious up moves. And the other thing is being mindful of the volatility
2088.08s: interaction with the position, which is very different from a ratio called diagonal.
2091.52s: Again, in the trade that I showed you, I got again, not a big price accommodation was less than
2096.08s: 10%. But I still got enough. And as it started to trend back up and fall was bleeding out,
2102.00s: it really took a lot of the P&L out of the trade. So gotta be aware of those impacts, I think.
2108.32s: Last one. Rik says, you talk about critical strike. Can you go more into that? I think that overall
2114.88s: we covered that pretty far in depth here, actually. So I imagine we're probably good on that as
2121.84s: well. So that's ratio put diagonals. And again, this honestly is kind of surface level. This is
2126.80s: at a really, really high level. There's a ton to go into. Now, the last thing I do want to show
2132.08s: you guys is a trade that I have on right now, which is in Roku. And the way that I found this trade
2139.44s: was really simple. This popped up on a breakdown scan here. So I entered here. Original stop was at
2146.56s: near term resistance, at least what I deemed it as. And then as I started getting a price
2151.68s: accommodation, I start sliding it down, sliding it down. And this is where it's at now. And again,
2157.04s: today is the 18th of June. We'll see how it goes right now showing a profit, but not much. I haven't
2161.76s: gotten a giant move yet, but I will follow it to the downside. I have inverted moving averages,
2166.80s: nice and wide, negative price trend. It definitely fell out below this near term resistance.
2172.80s: After we cracked below this kind of short term resistance, I front ran front ran the move just a
2177.44s: little bit. And yeah, the main reason why I got in here versus here is because this was a big
2183.92s: massive down day, a giant rejection at this level. So that to me was pretty bearish. And I was
2190.64s: willing to play this move, even though I typically would have waited for a drop below here. I also
2196.08s: looked back. This is really where there's way more support, right? There's one touch at this level.
2201.28s: Over here, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, a ton of
2208.40s: interactions with this level. So it was way more relevant to me anyways. So we'll follow this one
2213.28s: all the way through. And right now, that's looking like long 15 of the 60s at 626, in short five
2223.20s: of the 51s. And again, these are out in 16 August. The shorts are at 5 July. That's all to capitalize
2230.00s: on those details we talked about before. And it gives me way more profit potential. I'm waiting
2237.04s: the long options as much as I can. So that's that. If you have any questions, let me know. Don't
2242.00s: forget to subscribe, like the video. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
