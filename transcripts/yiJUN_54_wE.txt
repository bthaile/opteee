0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here? I'm back yet again with you on St. Clair and we're going
7.08s: to talk a little bit about the markets. We're going to talk about a course that he's
10.72s: launching up coming pretty soon here. But before we start diving into all of that, you
16.12s: and welcome back yet again. I convinced you slash trick you to come on again. I suppose,
21.68s: but it's awesome to have you on. Thank you for joining us.
23.80s: Yeah. Thanks. It's great for me. It's probably not as good for you. You really should have
27.60s: more friends, I guess. Yeah. Well, the problem is as soon as I start talking to people about
32.48s: options, their eyes promptly roll to the back of their head and then they fall asleep. So
36.96s: it is a small cohort of people who find any interest in these products. So yeah, I'm fortunate
43.60s: that you are one of those people. But with all that, before we get into this stuff on
49.68s: the course, I do want to talk just a little bit about the broader markets as per usual,
53.88s: because I think there's a lot of really interesting things going on. And I know that you have
57.76s: a different view on a lot of those things. So one of the things I want to talk about specifically
62.52s: is SVB, obviously, just a really interesting case. And at least for me, this is the second
69.64s: time I've seen this kind of scenario. The first time was back in 2008. And that was like my
74.44s: second year trading. So I had a very different eye on it. I wasn't trading around those events
79.88s: in 2008 too much, whereas what's been going on SVB at least as far as I've been able to decipher,
86.12s: I've been trading a lot around it. So I'm curious from a just structural standpoint,
92.12s: what do you think of the bank failure? What jumps to your mind? I think it's okay. First of all,
98.76s: I don't think any of us should be thinking about this shit because we don't know enough about it
103.64s: to make informed decisions that are better than the market. We just don't, because if you think
108.36s: about it, it's going to be like, well, sooner or later we'll find out what really happened.
113.08s: So we were really, if you're honest with yourself, you don't know really what happened. You're waiting
117.64s: for someone like Lewis or whoever to write the book. And it's really dangerous to look at stuff
123.80s: from the outside. I mean, seriously, what do we know? We've read the newspaper. I haven't even done
128.92s: that. But also, I think it's dangerous to take major singular events and
138.12s: say this is like 2008. I mean, it has some commonality with 2008, but it's not the same thing.
149.00s: This is a regional retail bank as opposed to an international investment bank. It's a different
156.92s: beast. Also, Dodd Frank is in place now. I know they weakened it because this clown and charge
165.00s: of SBB was part of the lobbying group who tried to get it weakened. Good job there. But regulations
171.72s: are there for a reason. And after 2008, back when there was some sort of bipartisan consensus
179.24s: where we could get something done, people actually looked into what the problems were and
183.96s: addressed some of them. So I don't think we're going to see the same contagion. And I'm only saying
189.08s: that not because I know anything, just because of the regulations in place. It doesn't seem like
196.52s: that is going to be the same sort of situation. And we're also, this isn't driven by
202.44s: sort of a collapse in a retail market and exacerbated by a whole bunch of, you know,
209.80s: credit derivative swap derivatives. Really a very old fashioned issue as far as I can tell.
216.68s: It's a run on a bank. So yeah, that's sort of what I think. I think it's always dangerous to
224.36s: attach too much significance to how this is similar to a previous event.
231.40s: One of the real problems with being long-vol, being long-volved, everything is different all
237.00s: the time because you're never going to fight the same war twice. So are there commonalities
244.68s: sure, but I think we have to be cautious about what we really know. Even from a statistic standpoint,
253.64s: right? Even if this is exactly the same as 2008. What's your sample size?
260.12s: Why? Right. So good luck drawing inferences from that. The markets are hard enough to draw inferences
266.28s: from when you've got hundreds of data points. So having said that, I did take money out of
274.60s: bank accounts if it was above the FDIC limit and stuck them into safer places like bookmaker.eu
282.28s: and bet online and draft kings. I think for the short term, they legitimately had less risk
291.40s: than a bank. So that was the only thing I did as any result of this stuff.
297.08s: Oh, that's interesting. So you didn't trade anything in, well, you can't really trade a SavB,
303.48s: but anything like XLF, the financials, anything like that? Not because of this.
308.92s: Got it. You know, almost certainly did trade some of that stuff. Well, certainly stuff that had
313.48s: financial links, but it was only based on what those stocks did. I don't want to say technically,
322.44s: but yeah, you know, how they moved around and what their volatility was. What the implied vol was,
326.92s: it wasn't based on any particular view ahead. But couldn't the argument be made that a lot of
334.44s: those things made those moves because of what happened? Oh, sure. Yeah, okay. But I don't need to
340.04s: know the cause to know the thing. Right. So yeah, I don't know. I can come up with some tortured
347.80s: analogy, but I really just care what happened rather than why it happened. And to be honest,
355.00s: I'm almost always long the financials anyway. They typically trade very cheap in terms of the
361.88s: bulk premium. I'm talking about the big financials like, you know, JP Morgan, American Express,
367.32s: that kind of stuff. It's almost always a core at my lungs. This leads me to a follow on question,
376.60s: because I've noticed this kind of course in our previous dialogues part of the way that I
383.48s: think about the markets, I have it like split into two pieces. There's like the tradable stuff and
388.36s: then there's stuff that I just find interesting. And it sounds like you really wait the tradable
395.08s: practical side of things. Is there like a general interest that you have in like what happens in
401.16s: the market or what happens in the economy? And if so, like, what does that look like for you?
405.64s: I don't care about it. Yeah, figured. I mean, it's not that I don't care about it so much as I find
410.92s: it ridiculously uninteresting. Like I've never read the Wall Street Journal or the financial times.
418.52s: I couldn't care less. I mean, I'm much more interested in the,
424.12s: well, the sort of stats-based stuff, the gambling based stuff.
428.36s: Yeah. I come that up from that point of view. I mean, to me, this is no different from putting
433.88s: that on women's cricket. You know, it's, although actually it is a little bit different,
438.52s: it's like quite like watching women's cricket as opposed to business. I hate it when people
444.76s: find out that I'm a trader and then they start talking to me about like business stuff.
451.72s: From like seriously, I would much rather talk about how the bears are going to screw up the draft
456.04s: or the cubs or anything. Like, you know, we'll talk about Greek history, anything.
463.40s: But I think it's about the most boring thing on earth.
466.52s: Yeah, I agree with that, especially if you're talking about like analyzing
469.80s: financials or like looking at a CEO statements. I think the part that I find interesting is when
475.40s: you have like incredibly complex systems and the relationships between things. I just find
480.52s: that interesting. It's the same reason why I personally like I'm fascinated by space. And it's
485.96s: because of this giant complex system and the relationship between things. But I actually
491.24s: really respect the way that you view the markets also because I do think for a lot of people,
495.24s: they start diving into causation causality. And then they're trying to essentially make really
501.80s: simple summations of extremely complex systems and turning that into a tradable event,
507.32s: which I think that that kind of sets people up for failure more often than not. But
511.80s: Also, they've got to be better at that than the market.
515.00s: Right. I mean, and there's plenty of evidence like being a domain specific expert
521.80s: isn't usually enough to make money in the market. I see.
525.88s: The point where I know people who are on the board of biotech companies and they can't make money
532.68s: trading biotech companies. But you don't know more than these people. And what they know is baked
540.20s: into the market. It's not, I don't know, it's people are going about people. And this is one of the
549.16s: things we, it's very much in my philosophy, is you've got to pick an angle that's beatable.
556.44s: You know, you don't do the hardest thing just for the sake of it. And that's even a sports
562.36s: betting, right? I know a couple of professional sports gamblers. It's not about whether they think
568.36s: the bears are a good team. It's none of that. It's the total is this. The bear's point spreaders
575.96s: this. So what should the point spread be in the first quarter? That's that's the sort of thing
581.48s: they're doing. It's not about, it's got nothing to do with football. It's all about relative
588.12s: prices between all these other things. And I think a lot of people tend to miss that. They get into
593.16s: sports gambling because they like sports, which is fine, but that's not going to make you money.
600.12s: That actually leads me to a following question is you were explaining some of your interest in sports.
605.48s: Obviously, you like sports. Why do you trade the markets then as compared to sports? Is it scale?
611.88s: Is it accessibility? Like what? Yeah, what leads you to that versus trading or gambling around
617.48s: things that you find more interesting? When I first started, there was no sports gambling
624.92s: in the companies I lived in. There wasn't in the US outside Vegas either. Unless, you know,
631.08s: there was no market, you'd say. And I got a job in the financial markets, basically. That's how I
637.32s: started there. I still do sports, but not to the extent I have done from the past. It takes a lot
646.84s: of work. It's a huge amount of work. And I think it's harder than trading. That was my following
652.20s: question. Why is that trading? There are a lot of pretty clear risk premium that you can jump on.
662.04s: Like stocks go up. There you go. You've got a tide. You've got 8% a year to play with.
668.60s: Options are too expensive. So there you go. That gives you a head start. And also the transaction
674.04s: costs and trading are minimal compared to gambling. I was just doing some golf gambling a while ago.
683.24s: And the markets are like, you know, 1.15 on each side. That's a huge spring. If that was a
690.20s: financial market, it would be like 101 on each side. You know, the spread in the spiders, for example,
696.92s: is practically speaking zero. And that's a big difference.
704.60s: Right. Yeah. That makes sense. It's, in part of the reason why I ask is, I mean, I don't bet on
709.40s: sports at all. I don't really watch sports. I like to play them. But I do find it really interesting.
715.16s: I like martial arts. And I see I don't know if you bet on any of that stuff. But I mean,
719.88s: they're coming up with insane bets, like whether or not these dudes will touch clubs, whether or
724.28s: not they'll sit down in between like it's that I find just so cool that they find all of these
731.24s: different things to bet on. But does that lead to more or less opportunity in sports betting?
739.80s: Because then to me, it also means that there would be decreased liquidity because there's so
743.48s: many different things people can bet on that it's difficult to like make a better market. Or
749.32s: again, I don't know how many of it works, but I find it interesting.
754.92s: A lot of those kind of bets are just complete sucker bets. Yeah. Like literally, you can bet on
760.36s: the coin toss at the Super Bowl, which is like absolutely insane, particularly because you know,
767.72s: it's a 50-50 bet. But the odds that are paying you are terrible. If you just want a 50-50 bet,
773.64s: you know, go and play roulette. You know, the odds there are a lot better. So
782.68s: I don't remember the question there. Most of that stuff is just complete garbage and any
786.68s: a pros not going to touch that. Prok bets on like, will this player run for more than this many yards?
794.36s: That's a lot of pros bread and butter because those lines can be really soft because the bookies
800.44s: put up hundreds of them. And it's like being a market maker in a way. It's like as a customer,
807.16s: if you're a smart customer, you look at the market maker's lines and you're like, good price,
810.44s: good price, good price, good price, good price. Oh, you fucked that one up. Done. And that's exactly
815.16s: the same as sports betting the bookies as well. They just, they can't get everything right.
821.32s: But the problem is, as a gambler, you've got to go through 300 lines. Probably you've got 20 minutes
828.76s: to do it before the market changes and it gets knocked into line. So that's not the sort of thing
836.20s: you can just do by, you know, typing some numbers into a spreadsheet for every single thing. It's
842.52s: it's a lot of data processing, a lot of work. Right. That makes sense. So then to bring us back now
849.64s: towards the financial markets, we talked a little bit about SVB. I, I'm wondering from again,
860.36s: not not to suggest causality or anything like that. But from your experience, when there are
867.48s: these kind of events, do we have any data sets around the performance of volatility post the event
875.24s: as in it tends to remain in this kind of range for this number of days? That's part of the,
880.60s: the thing I was looking to discuss a little bit earlier is I have a lack of reference points. So
887.56s: I'm really curious if you create any of your own based on your experience of the studies that
892.12s: you've done on again, understanding that the events are different, but sometimes they can have
895.96s: a similar catalyst. Yeah, that would be an interesting study. Again, I don't think you're going to
901.72s: find enough data points to come up with something that's rock solid, but it's an interesting thing to
909.00s: look at. I, yeah, I haven't done it, but I think that that is a legitimate actual study as opposed
919.00s: to sort of, you know, guessing about stuff. So yeah, you look and see, you know, during 2008,
925.96s: look at all the financials that survived. What was the relaxation time for their vols, that kind of
931.88s: thing? Don't be interesting to look at. Haven't done it, but yeah, okay. Yeah, because I started,
937.08s: I actually started just trying to compile some of it myself, but I don't have good enough data to,
941.88s: like, get a fair up. But that's what I'm curious if you looked at it because I know your stuff's
945.56s: obviously way more advanced than mine. I'm not showing, but it might just be the same as any other shop.
951.72s: You know, because like a garch model is basically a vol model that has relaxation built into it.
957.48s: And for a given stop, the relaxation times are relatively constant no matter what the stop,
965.56s: what the shop was driven by. I don't know that, but in this case, but I do know that as a general
973.48s: phenomenon, that's why garch models work so well is because they are relatively stable like that.
980.92s: Interesting. I had not thought about that. That's interesting.
988.12s: So another thing I wanted to talk to you about, again, this is, I know slightly outside of your
994.60s: preferred topics, but I am curious about your input nonetheless. I do find following the fed's thought
1002.92s: process. Interesting. Again, this isn't to forecast what the fed's going to do. This isn't to
1007.80s: forecast what the market's going to do in reaction to the fed. It's literally just the function of the
1012.76s: fed I find curious. And I've been really surprised with the way that they've kind of
1020.84s: jumped around based on these data points, you know, that we got from the bank failure,
1025.40s: then from some of the numbers that came out today. Does this, again, if you follow this stuff for
1031.96s: any duration of time, is this like what you would expect from the fed decision cycle? Again, just
1037.00s: is like a acting institution. I'm curious. Because I mean, first we were essentially pricing in no
1044.20s: chance, you know, of 25 or no chance of essentially stay. And then that's essentially completely
1051.96s: reverted over the course of a day. So I'm curious, yeah, if you've had experience with those kind of
1056.76s: moves before and just, yeah, a little detail around that. No, I mean, I can't tell you how many
1064.44s: fed governers there are. I find the fed very interesting though, because people get very angry
1070.60s: about it. And it becomes where people want the world to be a certain way. Yes, in simple.
1079.64s: During the wire, I can't remember who it was who said to one of the others, you want it to be that
1084.68s: way, but it's not that way. So people, I don't know if it's political, but I don't think it is,
1093.00s: because this went before we got so hyperpartisan, people got really mad about the fed. And
1103.56s: I don't pretend to know what they do, but you've got a few different options. The fed has hundreds
1111.16s: and hundreds of PhDs. All they do is study this stuff. So there's no way you can tell me that
1120.12s: they're dumb. And economics now, it's not, it's not economics 101. They understand all the
1128.04s: limitations in the models and people are working on all of that stuff. So I think your options are,
1134.20s: the economy is a really different, difficult thing. And it's possible to figure out a really small
1141.56s: amount of signal from that noise. And if you can, then those hundreds of full-time employees
1149.80s: might come up with that signal. Or you can say, it doesn't matter what you do, the economy is
1155.56s: completely random system, in which case nothing really matters. And all we're wasting is what
1161.88s: they're getting paid. Or the final one is you, Joe Traitor, think you understand this better
1171.00s: than they do. Like one of those alternatives is far less likely than the other two.
1177.56s: That's the thing I find odd. The fed is stupid, the fed is corrupt, pals and idiot. Now pals
1184.68s: is not an idiot. You might disagree with what he said. But no. And he's got so much more data than you.
1191.56s: And it's, yeah, I like watching fed days, but I like watching it on Twitter because people just
1199.40s: get so angry about it. And it's, I don't know, gotta get your amusement where you can, right?
1207.40s: It is entertaining. And it's actually interesting to hear you say that because whenever I talk about
1211.80s: the fed, I literally always come to that same conclusion that sometimes I don't understand what
1217.08s: they're doing, but I also always acknowledge that I, they have more information and they're smarter
1222.68s: than I am. So sometimes connecting the gap between those is what I find interesting to try to
1228.44s: understand like their movement patterns a little better. And they are trying as well. I think you've
1233.48s: got to, you've got to come at this with some sort of generosity of spirit. Right. Grace, yeah.
1240.76s: You've got a bit like, look, how all knows what his legacy is going to be. He's not trying to blow
1246.68s: up the economy because he's long a 50 lot of SPX puts. You know, it's like, that's not what he's
1253.72s: trying to do. It's like he's not a politician. He's a professional economist in a civil servant.
1261.24s: And he will be remembered for how the economy does. You know, not whether he's going to new beach house.
1268.28s: So I think you've got to remember that these people are trying. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's
1276.44s: an important point because, and I think it just goes back to everybody's thirst for a super simple
1281.24s: narrative that dismisses all nuance, which is yeah, I agree with you. It is always entertaining.
1286.92s: I also think it's always funny when the conjecture before those events is so high and it's to your
1292.68s: point, I always think it whatever is going to happen is going to happen. The part that I really
1297.08s: take interest in is yeah, like the functioning of the body and why it does what it does. Just because
1302.84s: anytime I think about markets of the economy, it again, like I make the parallel to space because
1309.64s: it's just so massive and so many things are correlated in ways that you might not know. That's
1315.00s: one of the things that got me interested in markets personally, that it's a cool way to like learn
1319.00s: about our world around us. But so speaking of learning, you guys have your course coming up. So
1328.20s: talk to me just about the origin of the course to get us started and kind of give us an overview.
1333.32s: And then I want to get into some details about it so that people can kind of learn, you know,
1337.40s: a little bit more about what to expect. I know a lot of my audience like I was telling you before
1341.48s: we started, they're super stoked about it. They're very curious and they want to learn more. So yeah,
1345.32s: what's like a high level overview to kick us off? Okay, so this came about because people were
1352.36s: asking me, can you teach me this? Can you teach me that? Like, can you be a full-time mentor? And the
1358.76s: answer to that is always no because I'm busy doing other stuff. But eventually I decided, look,
1363.88s: I'll put this together. This is literally based on stuff I used to teach at real trading firms,
1372.20s: right? So a couple of the biggest option market makers. Now we're not doing the same,
1377.56s: we're not talking about dynamic hedging and that kind of stuff because
1381.80s: retail people can't do it. Like you don't have the cost structure, you don't have the technology
1387.40s: structure. And that's an example of if you try to play that game, you're going to lose to Susquehana
1393.80s: and James Street. That you don't want to go up against those guys in that game. So
1399.80s: I'm going to try, or we, me and James, are going to try and teach things that actually work
1409.16s: statistically valid based on phenomena we are very confident in and use that as the basis of
1417.72s: trading strategies. Now the problem with options is there's an awful lot of details you've
1421.88s: got to learn first before you can learn why trading strategy works or why it doesn't. And I think
1430.28s: I think there are two main ways people screw up trading, right? There's the phoenix gang side of it
1436.92s: who think that there's edge line around everywhere and it's just free money and all you've got to
1442.04s: do is go and pick it up by selling an iron condor every week. And that's really wrong. And then there's
1448.76s: the the quant academic thing at the other end where people are looking for this all-encompassing
1455.96s: model of the market or this perfect option pricing thing or whatever. And that's sort of lacking
1463.48s: in street smarts because you got to remember it really just comes down to all of these things are
1469.64s: just going up and down because other people are trading them, right? It's all driven by supply and
1474.52s: demand. So you're looking for dislocations from their value. And you don't even you've got a rough
1481.08s: idea of what their value is but only a rough one because if you know it started here and then there's
1487.16s: a massive spike to up here there's a reasonably good chance that someone's overreacted and it's
1494.20s: driven up there by an liquidity issue. That's what market making is. Market making all these little
1499.96s: micro squeezes. And I think this is one of the traps people fall into. They'll see a big move and
1506.12s: they're like, ah, someone knows what they're doing. Well, what they were really doing is they put
1511.00s: a huge order into the market and it moved the price. You know, that's the the important thing
1516.52s: what they were doing. It's not so much they bought all these VIX calls because they think this
1521.56s: this and this. It's like the important thing they did is they bought all these VIX calls which
1526.76s: bump all the prices up. So it's based on kind of simple sort of observations like that.
1535.48s: So I think it's professional level but it's not teaching you exactly the same things that a
1541.64s: professional option trader would generally do. And well, I don't mean professional like you who
1547.40s: make your money from doing this. I mean professional like Susquehara or Citadel or James Drain. Got it.
1555.96s: So when you think about your like your target audience, your target demographic. Who who are we
1561.56s: targeting? You know, that would if I was a good businessman, I would have kind of made that
1568.04s: decision early and tailored things specifically to those people. I think it's more of a matter of
1573.64s: me telling people what I think they need to succeed in the markets. And I think that applies to anyone.
1579.96s: This is not in any way a cheap course and I acknowledge it is not cheap. I do think however it's
1588.68s: got enormous value. And if you compare it to the things of comparable level, there are a few MFE
1598.68s: classes that you could do. A lot of MFE classes, their option stuff is just mathematics and it's
1606.12s: just pointless. There are a few good ones that you will typically charge you between six and 10,
1611.64s: thousand dollars per unit. So compared to that, I think it's pretty good value.
1620.52s: And I can't remember where the rest of my thought train was going with that.
1625.08s: No, it's really cool because I have a follow on anyways to the target. So at a high level overview,
1632.04s: what are we expecting them to learn over the course? It sounds like there's going to be a little bit
1638.36s: of, and I look through the coursework and thank you for sending it ahead of time. So I had a chance
1642.36s: to get some familiarity and there's good intro to option stuff in there to help build that baseline,
1647.88s: things about the Greeks, so on and so forth. So kind of like building a foundation, then you
1652.04s: guys start getting into some other things. But I'd be curious to hear your summation of,
1658.44s: you know, before you take this course, you're starting at x point and it seems like that point
1662.12s: can be just about anything, maybe a general familiarity with markets and options. And then at the end,
1667.72s: you should know this. Yeah, in theory, you could start without knowing what a call or a put was.
1674.84s: In reality, if you tried that, you'd get very lost very quickly because this, yes.
1681.08s: I think you can see this with my books as well. I don't try and a lot of times with books,
1685.72s: people say the same thing four times. I don't. It's very dense. I say it once. You might have to read
1691.72s: it four times, but my stuff tends to be very dense. So there are, I think 300 slides in this.
1700.76s: And there's a lot of information in there. So we have to start with the mechanics of options,
1707.00s: because we can't really talk about a lot of the, where the edges are coming from unless you
1711.72s: understand that. So that's where the big problem with theta is. As people think theta is an edge.
1720.04s: It absolutely isn't. And if I could get people to understand one thing about options, that would be it.
1726.04s: But then in order to find out where there are edges, you have to know about implied volatility,
1730.36s: you have to know about realized volatility, you have to know how that connected, you have to know
1736.84s: the characteristics of them. So I often say it's kind of like being a hunter.
1743.48s: Except you don't have to get up early in the morning. Actually, you do. Right? Being an option trader
1747.72s: is very much like being a hunter. But the thing you have to understand is you have to understand
1751.88s: the characteristics of what you're trading. It's not the math that's important. You know,
1757.56s: a hunter isn't a biologist, but they have to know the characteristics of this is where ducks are.
1764.68s: If this kind of food is around, you're more likely to find a duck. If this kind of water is around,
1770.28s: you're not going to find ducks because they're not going to be in a rapid situation or a waterfall
1774.52s: or something. And it's like that would volatility. You kind of have to know how it all behaves.
1779.96s: And then once you've got that foundation, then we can look at specific trades like
1787.48s: time-based trades, like selling options overnight, selling them over the weekend, trading equity
1794.36s: earnings, some longer dated stuff like cover calls, risk reversals, zero DTE stuff we go into.
1804.04s: And a lot of this stuff I've talked about in my half an hour, hour seminars. But the big
1812.28s: difference here is I'm just presenting results there. Here I'm taking you through, this is the
1818.52s: phenomenon. This is the actual way you have to make the decisions to trade there. So I tell you
1825.48s: Volts over PRIST. Now what do you do? Which options do you sell? When do you rebalance them? What do you
1832.60s: do if this happens? What do you do if that happens? What do you stop from blowing up? All these kind of
1837.32s: it takes it from a theoretical high level thing to this is exactly what you do to have to do this trade.
1846.44s: So I think that's the big difference because James is completely a trader. I don't know what you
1855.88s: call me. I certainly trade. And I think that experience is the big difference. So if you go to an
1863.24s: MFE course, you're going to be taught by a math professor. It's not the same thing. And I do acknowledge
1873.08s: this as expensive. And you get this, you get a strange pushback from people in the markets where
1880.12s: you try to teach someone something. And that like, well, if you've got all this money, why are you
1885.72s: charging for the course? Which I always find odd because no one says to a doctor, you've got all
1892.84s: this money, why are you still charging to go to work? I mean, there was a huge amount of work that
1897.88s: went into this, which is why we're charging for it. It's like, I wouldn't have done this if there
1902.84s: was nothing in it for me. It's not that interesting. But I think it's great value. So expensive, yes,
1912.68s: but good value. I think so. So let's talk about that real quick. You're tuned.
1920.52s: Well, just while we're on the cost, I figured that's definitely an interesting point for a lot of
1925.40s: people, obviously. And it's because at least like I was telling you before, a lot of my demographic,
1931.48s: something around $3,000 is probably a sizeable portion of some of their bank rolls.
1937.24s: And for a lot of the people that would be interested in this kind of course, definitely, at
1942.76s: least from my community, like I was telling you, a lot of my community is a big fan of you because
1947.08s: I follow a lot of your work and talk about your work with them. Because I think you're a great
1950.60s: reference point for them. So one of the things that I think you were highlighting before when we
1956.20s: were talking about the structure of the course is some of the value. And I think it would be good
1961.24s: for people to kind of get a total idea of the cost perspective. So what is the total cost for the
1967.72s: course? Total cost is 2,995. Obviously, there were marketing guys involved and they didn't want to
1976.84s: say 1,000. And for that, you get it's meant to be 12, one and a half hour lessons, but it's
1985.88s: going to be more than that. This thing is just grown. I think it's probably more like 14 to 16,
1992.76s: but we're not going to rush through it just for the sake of rushing through it. Then the,
1998.44s: one of the things I think is a really good selling point is we're going to have a Slack channel.
2002.92s: And it's going to be a closed Slack channel for people who've been from this group. And it's
2010.52s: going to be where you can ask me questions, you can DM me. And hopefully we'll get a community of people
2016.92s: who are evidence-based options traders. And I don't really know if such a place yet around,
2027.24s: I mean, it's certainly like we were talking about before. If you want to talk about your opinions
2033.24s: on the Fed and how you think X, Y, Z politician is screwing up the world, that's great. That's for
2040.12s: you, but we're not doing it here. This is going to be like a real, we're only here to make money
2045.56s: trading options based on actual things like numbers, not crazy opinions. Well, you know,
2053.32s: they might not be crazy, but you know, so it's going to be very clean. It's going to be basically
2059.00s: the only place you're going to be able to contact James and I going forward, I think. I mean,
2064.36s: talk to people. But yeah, that makes sense. So we have the upfront cost, we have kind of the
2071.80s: main things that are included with it. A couple of other questions specifically on the pre-limc
2075.56s: cost, and then I want to get into some other aspects of it. So the first thing is,
2079.56s: do you guys have like a course syllabus or something that you're going to publish so people
2083.48s: can look through that before they choose to buy the course so that they can have an idea of what's
2087.56s: in there? A little bit. I can send you our sort of sales cheat sheet, which has like literally
2098.76s: a bullet point course list. Sure. What people can also do though is they can sign up, see the first
2105.48s: class, and if they don't like it, they can just cancel at that point. So it's not so much what we
2113.48s: teach you. It's more like the style of how we teach it. If you think that's going to work for
2118.60s: you, that's fine. If not, that's cool. You know, you can watch the first one and then just quit.
2123.56s: That's probably the easiest way to sort of get an idea of what's going on.
2131.00s: It's going to be a VIX trade. So it's not going to be options at all, but it's a good sort of
2137.48s: example for a lot of other things we're going to get to.
2142.68s: Right. So that leads then to a follow-on question. So one of the things that I notice in a lot
2151.48s: of your books is there's obviously a good deal of theory that then attempts to bridge the gap
2160.04s: to practical application. In the course, can people expect to see practical application of these
2167.88s: different theories that you guys are going to be talking about, i.e. not just back tests, and these
2173.08s: are the results of that. But as in, this is a trade that I did at xpoint, and this is how it went
2177.88s: like that kind of stuff. Some of them, one of the problems with options is that the trades play out
2186.84s: over much longer periods than that typically would be used. But yeah, we certainly have some real
2194.20s: examples in there. And we do talk people through, these are the actual decisions you will need to
2201.08s: make if you do this trade. So a lot of the actual strategies I mentioned in my last book,
2206.04s: you know, like the weekend effect. I think it's a paragraph, whereas the weekend effect in this,
2210.92s: I think it's probably going to be about an hour and a half. So that's sort of one of the big
2216.36s: differences. But we definitely do that. We've got about, I don't know, eight different strategies in
2222.36s: there. And I can't promise that I do all of them at any given time because I have, at sometimes,
2232.12s: I'm not allowed to trade certain kinds of options, or I have a mandate to do something else, or
2236.60s: my boss tells me to do something else. But these are all things that I have traded or would trade if
2241.64s: I could. And I don't know about six of them. The effect is part, is one of the inputs into my
2249.56s: vol model anyway. So I guess if we want to use Talib's phrase, there is skin in the game. We believe
2258.44s: into the point that we do it ourselves. Right. Cool. Yeah. And I just wanted to elucidate that point
2264.20s: for people because I do think that that's a strong consideration for people that take courses like
2269.24s: this is to actually get the, you know, this is the real stuff. How we're actually doing it.
2275.08s: Because in, I know you've talked about this and I agree with that, like back testing and studying
2279.16s: stuff like that is good. It gets you somewhere, but not the whole story. So I think it's cool that
2284.04s: you guys are in. This is very problematic actually. Right. It's technically difficult because there's
2290.44s: a lot of data and it's noisy data and you've got to clean it up. And there's a lot of technical
2296.20s: problems you can run into. The bigger problem is though, we don't actually have that much data.
2304.60s: Because we're not trading options. We're trading implied volatility. And it doesn't move
2309.48s: as quickly as stocks do. It goes into regimes and stays there. So it's really dangerous to,
2317.32s: you might think if you test something over the last four years, you've got a thousand data points.
2323.32s: In volatility terms, you might only have 10. Right. And it's really difficult. It's easy to
2329.72s: fool yourself into making an inference from that that really isn't there. So we're talking about
2334.60s: as well and the dangers of back testing. And yeah, I can't guarantee if you do this, you'll make money.
2340.36s: But I can't guarantee if you do this stuff and don't make money, I'm not making money either.
2345.08s: If that makes you point. Right. That's actually a cool phrase.
2352.12s: Is there open enrollment? Like if somebody doesn't make the first course, can they still join for
2357.48s: the second, third, you know, so on and so forth? And also, are they recorded if somebody misses it?
2363.88s: It's definitely recorded. And obviously, if you watch the recordings, we had people from
2370.52s: Europe ask about this. And so for Europe, it's much more of a big deal because people aren't going
2374.36s: to get up at two o'clock in the morning. It's all recorded. And if you need to ask questions,
2380.92s: which you can't do live, you can do it through DMing me through the Slack. So that's true. We haven't
2386.76s: talked about the idea of diving in and out of the course. I'm not sure that would be workable.
2396.28s: But like I said, we do have this first free class thing. Sure. Yeah. That makes total sense.
2404.68s: And then another thing you mentioned earlier was the duration of the course. But then before we
2408.44s: started recording, you were talking about kind of the your thought process on the duration of
2412.60s: like the Slack channel and the interactions. Can you talk about that real quick and just clarify
2416.44s: that? Because I think it's an important point for people. Yeah. I intend the Slack channel the last
2420.84s: forever unless you know, Slack goes away or you know, something genuinely unforeseen happens.
2430.28s: I still get emails a couple of times a year asking if my old Slack channel is still around. And I don't
2438.68s: that company that that channel was based on hasn't existed for about six years. So if you get a good
2445.40s: community going like that, it has a lot of value when it really does add to things.
2450.12s: Right. Yeah. And I think that that's actually a big sales point for people in case they didn't know
2455.40s: the the fact that you know, you get the course, you get the interactions, but then there's also a
2459.56s: sustained interaction period post, you know, when the when the sessions are over, which I think is
2463.88s: useful. Yeah. And I'm going to keep that closed because you know, it's people are paid for the course.
2470.68s: That's the access they're buying if you like. Yeah.
2475.48s: Cool. And then the the last question I got from some of my folks is, is there like a resource
2481.24s: library or what kind of is there any documentation they can expect to get? Obviously you guys have
2485.24s: the slides and you guys will have the videos recorded, but are there like any handouts, anything
2489.96s: like that that you're expecting to tie into the course? No, we're informed that it's kind of a
2496.68s: it's a decent idea. Let me think about that. I mean, certainly for things like extra reading,
2507.16s: we could certainly put stuff together like that. I hadn't considered that in any other way. We are
2512.28s: going to have I don't want to call them homework problems, but kind of the sort of thing where if
2519.16s: you want to do them, that's fine. So it's like at the end of a question on say put call parity.
2524.76s: We go through it and it's very easy for someone to say this is complete garbage. I don't need to
2529.88s: know this. I'm not a professional trader and we're going to show you why you do need to know it.
2535.08s: And we're going to give you a question in this little homework thing for how you would then use it
2539.80s: as an actual trader in real life and how it's actually a useful thing. And so if people want to do
2544.60s: that, that's great. Well, obviously we're not going to mark them. We're not going to I mean,
2549.24s: we'll give you the answers, but we're not going to sort of there's no passing grade here.
2554.36s: Right. Yeah, that makes sense. And yeah, because another thing that we use, at least in the like,
2559.80s: I run a free discord for people. And we have like a big resource list and people love going
2566.20s: through that. So if you guys have anything like that, I'm sure people would really enjoy that,
2570.76s: you know, like a reading list, useful websites, stuff like that. I should put in the in the slack.
2577.00s: I should have a channel for, you know, a library channel. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think people
2584.12s: would love that. Cool. Well, that's awesome. Is there anything else that you think people should
2588.44s: should know or you want to talk about with regards to the course?
2596.52s: I think when I first started this, I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about the whole thing
2603.80s: because I thought there are a million different courses out there. There are a million people who
2610.28s: claim to teach you about options. But it's kind of go up to the point where it's a bit like my books.
2617.88s: And saying this sounds arrogant, except if you've been a writer book, that's a very arrogant thing
2623.40s: to do to start with, right? Because you're putting yourself out there as some sort of expert. So
2628.36s: I really think this is the best course of its kind. And I think that's partly because it's written
2637.00s: by two traders who really genuinely trade, but also understand the theory. We understand the problems
2643.40s: you'll fall into. But we've just put a lot of work into it. I think if there was something better,
2650.44s: I think we would have tried to write that. Like I think genuinely this is as good as can be done
2656.36s: for what we're trying to teach. And I've told a lot of this stuff to trading firms and things.
2662.44s: So I kind of know what's useful and what isn't. I think I can do it all the time, but I can write
2673.32s: the slides on it. Well, I think one of the things in what I consider with a service like this
2680.84s: anyways is people are getting to tap into kind of your collective experience in a very condensed
2685.72s: focused manner, which that in and of itself is like pretty valuable, in my opinion. So
2691.56s: I'm really stoked to see the course here. How it's going and stuff like that. I think especially
2696.28s: for the traders, this kind of thing is really valuable because and I've talked to you about this
2701.16s: and gave you this compliment before. But I'm happy to reiterate because I think it's cool to give
2705.16s: people compliments that deserve them. And with your books and whatnot, you really strike a good
2711.08s: balance between theory and practical application. And when I was looking through the slides,
2715.72s: I saw that same thing. And I think that that's really useful for people because they get to
2720.28s: get a distilled version of theory from somebody who's already pre-filtered. This is the important
2727.40s: theory from this is all of the theory. And then this is how to practically apply it. So
2732.12s: yeah, I think that's right. That's what that needled. It's like on one hand you've got the YouTube guy
2737.08s: who's like free money, free money, free money, and he doesn't even know what an option is.
2740.92s: And at the other end you've got the professor who thinks his option course, I mean it's just a
2747.64s: stochastic calculus course, you know, it's low level grad maths. And I think we're in the middle
2753.24s: where like we're not telling you this is easy. We're actually telling you it's hard, but we're
2757.88s: also going to tell you how to do it. And there's no magic to it. And you can learn it. And to do it,
2764.12s: you have to learn all this other stuff. So if you're prepared to put the work in, yeah, I mean it works.
2771.32s: It's like alcoholics anonymous, right? It works if you work it.
2777.32s: That needs to be my alcoholics anonymous, but I've heard that.
2781.00s: Well, hey, hey, hey, no, I'm just kidding. The last question I had for you is specifically
2786.92s: on the courses, like, is there any like pre-work? Is there anything that somebody that might be
2791.56s: less familiar with options should do before they jump into your course? Because when I was looking
2797.00s: through the slides, at least in my opinion, that would probably help them to a pretty significant
2801.24s: degree. But again, I don't know if that's anything that you guys have thought through.
2805.64s: Yeah. At a minimum, you should have read Nate and Berg. You need that level just in the
2815.32s: manclature, right? If I say Delta, you shouldn't be like, whoa, what the hell is that? You might,
2819.80s: we're going to tell you what it is, but it's going to be coming way too fast if you don't
2823.40s: nothing. So I'd say Nate and Berg is the absolute minimum. I would probably recommend you read my
2830.04s: option trading book. I think it's better than Nate and Berg, but it's also, despite my best efforts,
2838.04s: more advanced. So that would probably help as well. But I think if you've gone through those two,
2844.76s: I think you'll have no trouble following it. There's no math in it. You can't be frightened of math,
2851.40s: like, you can't see it and like, freeze up, but you don't have to understand anything particularly
2857.88s: deep. I think I use Taylor's theorem. I think that's the most complicated thing. And if you don't,
2862.60s: if you don't understand that, you don't really need to, you can sort of jump over that as well.
2869.40s: If you see what I mean, we can tell you that you're pushing this without you having to derive the
2873.40s: equations. Right. Well, that's awesome. Cool. Well, I know from my folks and whatnot, it's super
2879.40s: helpful to get just an overview, right? Of the course, what to expect. When people, when people
2885.40s: like sign up, do you have a link that you can share with me so I can throw it in the video
2888.44s: description and stuff like that? Or what's the easiest process to get people signed up?
2893.32s: We are meant to be coming up with a sign-up page. It's got, we haven't done it yet. It's like,
2898.60s: it was meant to be done Monday. Things were going very, very slowly and then they started going
2903.64s: very quickly. So the sign-up page isn't here. When I get it, I'll send it to you and you do whatever
2910.44s: you need to do with it. And I would encourage people, even if they're not going to sign up, right?
2914.84s: And I understand all the reasons why they might not. Even if they're not, I think tuning into the
2919.72s: first lesson would be, I think people will learn from that. That can't hurt, right?
2926.12s: Hour and a half of your time. Yeah, I think that's awesome. So I'm looking forward to it. And
2933.40s: yeah, when I get all the links and stuff, I'll throw it in the notes below for people and then
2936.44s: also throw it in our discord. But you and I always, honestly, a pleasure to chat, looking forward
2941.96s: to catching up and seeing how the course is going. And yeah, we'll talk soon.
2945.72s: Right. Thanks very much. Take care.
