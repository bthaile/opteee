0.66s: the skies have parted and a unicorn has
3.30s: arrived on scene I put on a ratio call
6.48s: diagonal in apple and it has worked
8.70s: literally perfectly from when I entered
10.68s: the trade I want to walk you through
12.36s: three things the first thing is why this
14.34s: structure is so much better than the
17.40s: commonly sought after Alternatives that
19.68s: people typically use for this kind of
21.60s: hypothesis the second thing I want to
23.64s: talk you through is how I analyze the
25.14s: trade how I structure the trade how I
27.06s: intend to manage the trade and then the
29.28s: third thing at the end of the video I
31.26s: want to walk you through the exact
32.70s: thought process I use for winning trades
35.94s: to identify how can we maximize our
39.66s: profit potential I spend so much time
42.06s: doing videos management videos on
44.34s: managing losing trades how to get out of
46.50s: this thing unscathed or make a few bucks
48.06s: I like those but this is a different
50.28s: kind of problem set to work through
51.96s: which is how do we maximize The Profit
54.18s: potential here and I'm going to walk you
55.20s: through exactly that and
56.94s: shout out to the patreon family thank
59.16s: you guys so much for your support you
60.48s: make videos like this possible and just
62.46s: for your viewing pleasure I just kept my
64.56s: shirt off today so you're welcome and
67.14s: let's get right into the details so the
70.08s: ticker as I mentioned is Apple we are
72.12s: trading the ratio called diagonal if you
74.46s: are unfamiliar with this structure
76.26s: that's okay I have an entire playlist on
78.24s: it and I will link to it in the notes
80.16s: below but essentially we're going to use
82.26s: a long call that's deep in the money
83.94s: that's further out in time and then sell
87.00s: near-term short calls against it it's
89.04s: similar to a covered call not the same I
91.56s: hate the terminology Poor Man's covered
93.30s: call because that's not what this is the
95.88s: strategy is a diagonal and it's
98.10s: specifically a ratio called diagonal so
100.56s: let's talk very quickly about the
102.96s: general principles of the trade and then
105.18s: I'm going to get into some specific
106.74s: details on the remainder so the first
109.50s: thing is I entered this trade on 10 May
112.56s: I add a 10 000 allotment so super small
116.34s: trade it was mostly to speculate on a
120.36s: movement that's really what this is I
122.58s: fully anticipated this trade not working
124.62s: out in my favor but I've been
126.84s: delightfully surprised so
129.42s: I entered in with the vast majority of
132.72s: the capital for the trade 95 and this
135.36s: essentially the reason why I make this
136.56s: allocation is it just prevents me from
138.12s: getting stupid if things don't go in my
139.80s: direction but this is my average entry
142.32s: so there is a two lot at 47.45 so I
146.82s: bought two of the 130 calls expiring 17
151.74s: nove for 47.45 those were about a 90
154.68s: Delta when I first put them on right now
156.90s: they're about an 83 Delta
158.94s: so what this means is I wanted to gain
163.68s: long exposure why well this is bullish
167.88s: this is a six month daily on Apple and
171.78s: there's a lot of interesting things
173.16s: going on but first post earnings we got
176.64s: this nice big gap I didn't enter right
179.70s: away I wanted to see how it reacted
182.22s: about this Gap and if you'll notice I
185.04s: actually entered on this day not the one
187.08s: that the arrow is pointing to because
188.34s: that would be too simple I actually
190.20s: entered here
191.46s: on the fourth day this is the 10th of
194.52s: May and it's because it held this level
197.64s: so what I did was set up what I consider
201.00s: to be a high probability trade what that
203.40s: means is in this trade I set my initial
207.24s: stop here so first stop is right here
209.76s: this was the initial now my new stop is
211.74s: here so my first stop was at 164.47 it's
215.58s: kind of at this next level of resistance
218.28s: and it's attached to this big volume
220.02s: node that you see permeate all the way
221.52s: over here because if we fell below that
223.50s: then it's kind of telling that I'm just
225.24s: completely directionally wrong I've
226.98s: since moved this stop up which we'll get
228.90s: into in just a minute that's part of the
230.22s: profit taking approach but the reason
232.98s: why I do this very clearly is because I
236.16s: have super clear bounds I have a ten
238.62s: thousand dollar max value trade I'm
240.24s: using 94 99.50 whatever it was
244.94s: 94.90 I the one permutation that I
248.04s: didn't say
249.30s: um but I'm essentially using you know
250.98s: the vast majority of the money 9 500
252.96s: bucks
253.86s: so I want to be correct and that's why
256.98s: this is a pretty tight window for me to
259.38s: operate in before I place the trade I
262.02s: wanted to see how it handled this level
263.40s: I also wanted to see what the volume
265.32s: looked like throughout that period I
267.66s: also wanted to identify how it did most
269.82s: recently with its earnings Trends and
272.04s: expectations and overall I had a
275.28s: positive bias I liked the way it looked
277.80s: on the linear regression channels the
279.66s: moving averages were all aligned
281.64s: beautifully exactly as I wanted and that
284.16s: was actually the first kind of warning
287.16s: stop that I had configured which is this
290.70s: 50-day moving average which is very
292.92s: common for me to use that as a stop for
294.78s: longer term trades but it lined up
297.36s: pretty well with this resistance Zone
298.98s: which is kind of why I moved myself
300.66s: there
301.62s: that's the overall thought process it's
303.66s: again nothing super complex here just
306.06s: bullish I like what I saw so to set up
310.38s: the stop metrics I typically like to use
313.26s: the stock because this is a directional
316.08s: trade some people like to use a random
318.12s: number for the long calls I.E if the
320.76s: long call Falls by X dollars in terms of
324.84s: its premium then I get out to me that's
327.06s: arbitrary our volatility is going to
328.98s: move lots of stuff is going to move
330.18s: that's not the right way for me to set
332.16s: these up so what I like to do is use my
334.14s: hypothesis this is a directional
335.70s: hypothesis if it fell to this level I
337.86s: knew I was wrong at at that level I
340.38s: risked losing 1600 bucks that doesn't
342.96s: include the premium I would have
344.52s: collected on these short calls
346.44s: essentially because those would make
348.06s: money as it goes down but this is just
349.92s: for the long calls to tell me what I'm
351.24s: getting out so essentially if these long
354.48s: calls went from 47.45 down to 39.45 Eric
357.84s: is exiting the trade easy
359.94s: so that sets up the Lost side of my
363.00s: structure now
364.86s: the original Short call outlay is down
368.88s: here so on the 10th of May I sold the
372.24s: two June 175 calls I sold two of them
374.82s: collected 2.38 cents
377.40s: those were originally a 42 Delta so
379.56s: slightly out of the money from when I
381.00s: entered first entered the trade and you
383.70s: can see when I entered the trade uh
385.86s: Apple was trading at 172.73
388.74s: so what what's going on here why did I
392.10s: get in at 238 and then out at 204. great
395.52s: question good question and it's tied to
398.52s: this if you look at 26 May is when I
401.22s: adjusted this trade so if we pull this
403.62s: back up and we go over here to 26 may we
408.72s: can see again that this is the 10th of
410.52s: May when I entered 26 May is this candle
413.16s: right here this is right when we started
415.44s: running up above 175.
418.14s: I was in a very fortunate scenario it's
421.26s: one of my favorite things to see where
423.54s: my short calls were in the money these
426.48s: were in the money but I was still able
429.30s: to exit this trade at a profit for two
432.84s: reasons one volatility contracted two
435.90s: time had passed they kind of it's the
438.00s: same mechanic to make money volatility
439.74s: and time operate in the same space in
441.60s: terms of the value it provides to an
442.98s: option but because of both of those
444.66s: moving in concert in my favor even
447.36s: though directionally in isolation this
450.24s: trade is wrong I still was able to get
452.64s: out at a profit which is beautiful so I
455.70s: didn't look the gift horse in the mouth
457.44s: I took the trade off and I said let me
460.02s: reconfigure slightly so I went out from
462.84s: 2 June to 9 June and I stayed at that
466.32s: same 175. why did I stay at the 175 it's
469.32s: simple because it had a pretty damn good
471.42s: run it had this Gap up and then it
474.00s: started accelerating in here so I didn't
477.30s: want to slide my strike too far out of
479.64s: the money because I was able to get 327
483.78s: and I only essentially needed to do a
486.30s: one lot here because in this case for a
488.88s: two lot I made what call it 480 that
493.08s: would have been my Max potential there
494.34s: in this case I have a one lot and I
497.28s: still collected 327. decent percentage
500.16s: on this with one entire less lot the
503.28s: reason why this change in lot matters is
505.56s: because it unlocks additional upside
508.38s: potential which again this is a bullish
511.02s: trade
513.12s: so now if we take a look at the p l
515.04s: graph as we can see we're pretty much in
517.32s: Max profit this trade can make a total
519.24s: of 991 and I'm making 9.54 these short
522.54s: calls expire the 9th of June we got a
525.48s: few days left so you're actually going
527.22s: to see at the end of the video how I'm
529.56s: deciding what to do here which is one of
531.42s: the most kind of beneficial parts of
533.28s: this in my opinion now the other part I
537.24s: promised to talk to you about was
538.74s: comparing this to an equivalent position
540.66s: and explaining why this is better a lot
543.24s: of people would trade a covered call
544.74s: here or attempt to and this trade makes
549.02s: significantly more money than the
551.40s: covered call equivalent why
553.44s: let's use the same principal amount of
555.36s: money 94.90 that's what I have invested
557.70s: if we look over here at the covered call
560.04s: equivalent 94.90 when I got into the
563.58s: trade when Apple was trading at 172.73
565.98s: so this is saying we have 94.90 when
568.02s: Apple was trading at this price you can
569.58s: get 54 shares if I bought those 54
572.64s: shares first there is no short calls
574.80s: against it because you don't have enough
577.02s: for a covered call you would need at
578.58s: least 100 shares so you're losing that
580.86s: profit Target right out of the gate the
582.72s: second thing that's happening the p l at
585.18s: this point is three hundred and forty
587.04s: dollars whereas this trade is up 900
589.50s: that's leverage working in my favor the
593.16s: third thing is I control a much larger
596.40s: position that's why I'm making more
597.72s: money again leverage so overall the
600.96s: covered call in this scenario is far
603.12s: inferior
604.32s: there are instances where this looks
607.14s: better one if there's a good dividend
609.36s: two if you don't have a specific time
612.54s: frame you're operating in I did my my
616.86s: hypothesis wasn't apple is going to go
619.08s: up over the next five years after I saw
621.96s: this move my hypothesis was Apple is
625.26s: going to go up soon meaning over the
627.72s: next quarter at least which is exactly
630.48s: why I went out about six months it gives
632.34s: me plenty of room to give it some space
634.44s: but I'm not going out into Infinity
637.50s: which is one of the benefits of the
639.00s: covered call the point being is in this
640.98s: scenario if you can get the direction
642.96s: correct you can make way more money on
645.84s: these than these okay the next thing I
649.08s: want to talk to you about is this what
651.48s: are my choices here so I talked to you
653.40s: about wanting to maximize my profit
655.20s: potential how I've been managing this
656.76s: trade how I went from a two lot to a one
660.00s: lot it gives me more upside potential so
662.22s: that's what I'm doing so far to to
664.68s: maximize my profit potential but now
666.60s: we're at kind of a sticky spot because
669.60s: apple is trading at 179.21 and I have
673.02s: 175 short calls so what can I do to
675.54s: manage these well I have three choices
677.88s: that I like there's more than three but
679.56s: I like these three
680.88s: the first one I can roll out this short
683.16s: call and we'll look at an example of
685.26s: that in a second the second I could
687.72s: close the short call for a loss and sell
690.90s: one of my long calls to cover the cost
693.78s: it essentially makes sure that I'm
695.94s: blocking in a profit
697.56s: so what this means is let's say I buy
700.08s: back this uh 175 call and right now
704.64s: they're not super expensive let's take a
706.20s: look
706.92s: so if I look at
709.38s: this 175 short call which still is about
711.90s: 20 cents left that's why I haven't done
713.22s: it yet but we're gonna pay four dollars
717.00s: fifty cents
718.08s: so I'm gonna essentially give back this
722.24s: 327 and I'm gonna give them another what
726.60s: dollar ish 75 cents something like that
729.00s: depending on where it lands tomorrow
730.26s: after the Theta decays out about a
732.42s: dollar so what this means is I need to
736.20s: cover that 100 loss there's different
738.30s: ways I can do it and one of those ways
740.52s: is by selling one of these calls long
742.68s: calls at a profit I realize the profit
745.56s: it overwhelms the cost here I make sure
748.14s: I'm realizing again as I'm realizing a
750.12s: loss that gain supersedes the loss in
752.10s: terms of value so overall I'm still net
754.92s: green that's one choice
756.48s: then the third choice here is to close
758.82s: the whole thing down at a profit so
760.68s: let's talk about these three scenarios
762.42s: the very first one is I'm not super
764.70s: inclined to do this just yet the reason
766.86s: why I'm not super inclined to do option
768.66s: number two
769.86s: is because there's still decent profit
772.50s: left to be made in this trade and this
774.84s: would allow me to take advantage of some
776.34s: of it but not quite as much as I could
778.62s: if I choose to stay in the trade so it
781.32s: really comes down for me do I want to
783.54s: stay in this trade or do I want to take
785.04s: my ball and go home now if we look at
787.38s: closing the trade again let me pull this
790.44s: up
791.28s: we're gonna walk out making about a
793.56s: grand and again that's also on top of
796.32s: the 68 that we made before so overall if
799.92s: this thing closes out on time it's about
802.26s: a 10 12 return on invested Capital once
805.20s: we factor in whatever this loss is going
806.88s: to be so there's that or I can roll out
811.14s: this short call so again if we pull up
814.02s: the platform and we take a look at our
815.52s: choices let's pretend that this 20 cents
818.58s: decays out so we wait a little bit
820.32s: longer we're not really at any sort of
822.90s: risk of the dividend X div coming up
826.38s: forcing some sort of early option
828.60s: exercise nothing like that
830.52s: so if we let this 20 cents come out and
833.70s: that takes our option essentially down
836.28s: to four dollars and 30 cents if we're
839.52s: meeting it at 450. so what I'm looking
841.98s: for is at four dollars and thirty cents
844.14s: how far out in time do I have to go to
846.42s: make a profit and I essentially could go
849.66s: out a couple weeks and I would make some
852.00s: money I would actually make decent money
853.44s: roll these out to the 175 same strike a
855.66s: little further out in time that would
857.22s: increase Max profit potential I could
859.26s: even go a little further up so I can go
861.24s: from the 175 to 177 and a half that's a
864.24s: math problem and if you're still
865.68s: watching the video which one of those
867.18s: makes more money you tell me or I could
871.02s: always do another strategy where instead
874.14s: of just selling one of these at the
876.54s: let's just call it six dollars I could
878.64s: sell two of them and go even further out
880.80s: of the money to collect enough of a
882.84s: credit and I still would have upside
884.58s: potential because I'm moving this
886.20s: further out and up the short call strike
889.08s: so we have three choices here this is
892.44s: definitely the one I'm leaning towards
894.06s: and I will resolve this trade probably
896.64s: on expiration as I see what the market
900.42s: has done where we're settling how much
902.64s: extrinsic value is left in the option so
904.44s: it's a little bit of a TBD but this
906.42s: gives you a preamble to what I'm doing
908.64s: how I'm thinking about it and as always
910.44s: if you have any questions let me know
912.36s: throw them down in the comments don't
913.62s: forget to like subscribe be an outlier
915.72s: share with some friends we just crossed
917.70s: 12 000 subscribers thank you guys so
919.20s: much for the support and I'll see you
921.00s: guys later
