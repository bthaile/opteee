2.28s: what's up everybody Eric here and I'm
4.68s: back with my friend Tom basso although
7.20s: your name says Thomas which is very
8.64s: formal but it's good to have you back
10.14s: again welcome to the outlier podcast
12.18s: it's great to have you on again hey good
14.22s: to be here Eric
15.66s: so this year last year it's been super
19.56s: busy and
21.30s: from a kind of macro level standpoint it
25.50s: seems like the market is in this
27.96s: transition period whether or not we hold
30.54s: here move higher hold here start to
32.70s: collapse down what are your thoughts on
35.10s: where we stand in the markets literally
36.90s: right now
37.98s: well you're you're speaking of the stock
39.78s: market no doubt and we have to remember
41.70s: I trade 26 Futures markets I trade you
44.58s: know anything from Metals currencies uh
47.16s: AG products uh meats and so on softs so
52.50s: a lot of markets are going through
54.12s: transitions I would say that earlier in
56.94s: the year
59.28s: I saw a lot of commodity markets tending
62.34s: to do all right they were starting to
65.10s: get the inflation thing going there were
67.74s: some disruptions there was some drought
70.20s: in the AG area in the case of the stock
73.32s: market itself you sort of had a really
75.42s: lousy last year and then you
77.58s: transitioned to this
80.06s: sort of we're going to have a recession
83.52s: and we're going to at the same time the
87.24s: FED is going to absolutely clamp down on
90.36s: inflation
91.62s: so uh people didn't trust the rally
96.72s: um I think we could take a little side
98.88s: trip for the traders that would be
100.68s: watching this down the road and say that
103.62s: this is a great example of why you
105.72s: shouldn't predict you shouldn't try to
107.82s: guess what's going to happen because the
110.22s: vast majority of Traders I think guessed
113.22s: that we were going to have either a
115.74s: recession and therefore the stock market
117.36s: will be weak or we're going to have the
119.64s: FED just killing all the joy with higher
122.76s: interest rates
124.68s: and so they stood they stood aside and
127.50s: just were absolutely convinced that this
130.32s: thing is not going to rally and I've
132.54s: been I took the hedges off I don't even
135.00s: remember now it's a January February or
137.88s: something a long long time ago and I've
140.52s: been unhedged and just almost fully
142.68s: invested the whole way
144.36s: doing very well they had a great year so
147.00s: far and
149.16s: I don't
150.96s: I didn't predict it I mean I would have
153.42s: said that I would have agreed with
155.10s: everybody's predictions but from a
156.78s: Trader's Viewpoint I don't worry about
159.66s: what I think the Market's going to do I
161.70s: look at the prices it cuts through the
163.68s: indicator hits my stops I'm long
167.88s: the stops up when you can control your
171.48s: position sizes and risk
173.64s: and and wash with wash rinse and repeat
177.72s: you know over and over again for the
180.48s: last 50 years you know and um so it
184.38s: becomes about as easy as breathing at
186.42s: this point but uh
188.22s: I think that that's the what I've seen
190.32s: now and now and now we're getting to the
192.12s: point where
193.50s: uh I'm starting to see some cracks in
196.86s: the foundation I'm seeing
199.44s: out of my nine strategies one of them
201.66s: dedicates itself to being long or short
204.42s: NQ which would be Nasdaq futures
207.90s: either long or short and it's the
210.78s: indicators I use there are nine day
212.88s: indicators
214.26s: and so it's a little shorter term than a
217.50s: lot of my long-term sector timing or my
220.98s: more longer term Futures Trading is so I
225.12s: I kind of call it sort of intermediate
227.40s: term because I have one other program
229.32s: that I'm down in the two to three year
231.12s: or two to three day time frame but this
234.60s: nine day indicator is already going over
236.34s: to the to the downside I'm short NK
239.22s: Futures I've sold off I was fully
242.58s: invested uh 30 out of 30 for at least a
246.30s: few days in the sector timing so that's
249.06s: 30 different sectors all stocks with uh
254.28s: one
256.02s: is that right yeah one uh bond fund is
260.40s: in there so 29 stocks and one Bond
264.66s: and out of those now we've backed off to
267.78s: 27 out of 30. so that's starting to go
270.90s: you know it's starting to sell itself
272.70s: off
274.08s: and uh we're getting pretty close now
277.56s: that if you look at my heads chart on
280.26s: enjoy the ride.world my website on the
283.08s: Hedge page you'll see the uh stops on my
287.88s: new hedge going on keep coming up higher
290.40s: and higher and the market keeps going
292.14s: lower and lower they look like they're
293.82s: going to come close to each other here
296.04s: in another few days or a week hard to
298.74s: say so I'm keeping my eye on it because
301.62s: if that goes over I'm now fully hedged
305.16s: and I'll take off that amount of risk so
307.74s: yeah and at that point who knows you
309.90s: know thing starts
311.28s: rolling downward and people get panicked
314.04s: and all these people who have now
316.92s: predicted that we're not going to have a
318.72s: recession and we're definitely going to
320.34s: have a soft landing and the feder is not
323.40s: going to raise anymore
325.14s: might find themselves completely wrong
327.60s: again
329.04s: and then scrambling to uh get out of the
333.24s: get out of the kitchen because it's too
335.22s: hot
336.24s: yeah and it's interesting because the
338.04s: you know probabilistic outcome right now
339.48s: on Futures shows another increase and
342.42s: it's slowly starting to change for a
344.58s: while it was no change and it's slowly
346.32s: starting to ratchet up for another
348.12s: increase but you mentioned one thing on
350.40s: the bond funds which
352.26s: um Urban index that made me want to ask
354.54s: you what do you think about 30-year
356.40s: treasury yields right now they had that
358.50s: that giant pop and I thought that was
362.28s: really interesting movement obviously
364.20s: there's a little bit of impact coming in
366.54s: from the fed and you know removing
368.82s: liquidity but I'm curious like what do
370.44s: you make of that movement because
371.58s: essentially you know looking at the
374.10s: beginning of July it was you know 38.43
378.96s: and now it's up at like 43. so it's a
382.02s: pretty meaningful move
384.90s: yeah I would say Bonds in general though
387.84s: have had if you think about close to 40
390.78s: Years of the wind at their back going
394.20s: back to Reaganomics in 1980
396.78s: and just recently in the last few years
399.56s: with the inflation and the fighting
402.00s: inflation and the FED increasing the
403.68s: rates and all that bonds have had the
406.14s: wind in their face
407.84s: and so the question is
410.46s: where are we on the whole scheme of
412.38s: things I don't see inflation going away
415.62s: anytime soon and every a lot of people
417.42s: predicted sticky my uh I get I guess
420.78s: Elementary level economics brain tells
424.26s: me that we're probably going to be
426.14s: fighting inflation for some time
429.30s: I don't think it'll ever get uh unless
431.70s: we get into uh like a depression or
434.16s: something maybe it just collapses and
437.10s: we're all in uh Then You're Gonna Want
439.50s: Your 40 acres in the woods
443.16s: um but other than that type of scenario
447.06s: I don't see in any normal times
450.00s: interest rates going down a huge amount
452.54s: I can see them going up more to fight
456.18s: inflation that we continue to have and
458.58s: continues to seem sticky
460.56s: so I think bonds are I wouldn't want to
463.92s: have a lot of uh a lot of money in them
466.80s: right now I think the the return to risk
469.02s: could be lousy
470.34s: right and you bring up another Point
472.68s: that's actually the note that I was
473.88s: jotting down I'd love to get your
475.26s: perspective the tightening cycle that we
477.72s: went through with the FED is uh
479.66s: unprecedented it's literally one of the
482.16s: first series that we've seen like that
484.10s: and I am very curious
488.40s: it's easy to say the fed's stupid the
491.58s: FED doesn't know what they're doing you
492.90s: know what I mean like everybody just
493.68s: complains about the FED but like they're
495.66s: not dumb they're doing the best they can
497.46s: with a lot of information they're
499.50s: obviously arguably a little late to the
502.74s: party but when we're looking at the way
506.40s: that this continues forward Powell has
509.46s: been very steady on the drum beat of
512.64s: we're gonna continue tightening until
514.86s: the job is done
516.48s: how do you view that kind of phrasing
520.02s: against some of the early cracks we
522.78s: started to see in the banking sector and
525.84s: then at what point would you imagine the
527.82s: FED would say
529.62s: I understand this is my Silver Bullet
531.54s: but I'm breaking everything with it when
534.66s: when does that happen and then what
536.88s: happens at that juncture
538.62s: yeah I would also be a Fred Basher I
542.10s: think they waited too long to do
543.54s: anything and I think that's partially
545.34s: political problem
547.02s: they seem to uh to be Political Animals
550.68s: more and more they used to be
552.24s: importantly independent back when I was
553.86s: a lot younger uh nowadays it seems as
557.70s: though they're just trying to always
560.10s: act in political Fashions and and so
563.94s: they're too late to take action against
566.16s: inflation and they're probably going to
568.80s: be too late or overdo it to the other
571.26s: side too and they're going to be
573.48s: panicking when they start seeing some
575.16s: big Banks go into trouble and they're
577.92s: going to have to scramble and say oh I
579.84s: guess we ought to ease back a little bit
581.28s: we've overdone it and they'll probably
584.34s: be too late doing that too they seem to
587.64s: be looking in the rear view mirror as
589.56s: they drive
591.78s: so
593.28s: I don't know I I think that I agree that
597.30s: he has been Powell that is has been very
600.12s: consistent with the message and that's
603.36s: good because half of his job is
605.94s: convincing others that they're serious
608.70s: about whatever it is that they're trying
610.26s: to talk about and if he doesn't stay
612.36s: consistent with his message he'll get
613.86s: ripped apart
615.36s: uh and probably replaced by somebody who
617.88s: can stay consistent to his message
620.76s: um
621.42s: yeah I just think
623.88s: got a tough job because they've painted
626.70s: themselves into the corner
628.56s: they have
630.66s: allowed inflation to rear its ugly head
634.02s: and at the same time
636.38s: they have expanded their book
640.62s: to the point where they need to start
642.48s: backing off the book and sell that stuff
645.24s: and when they sell stuff like that
648.08s: they are taking money out of the money
651.42s: supply and so that's sort of a double
656.16s: whammy if they keep the interest rates
657.78s: high and are reducing the money supply
659.90s: you're going to choke any chance that
662.94s: you would have to get the economy
665.10s: rolling and growth of the economy in my
667.98s: mind
668.82s: is the only logical
671.34s: a super good way to lift all everybody's
675.74s: incomes across all sorts of sectors of
679.56s: the economy to have a growing economy
682.62s: and what I see happening in Washington
685.08s: with Congress and the administration
688.02s: along with what I see happening with the
690.12s: FED all speaks to killing the growth in
693.84s: the economy and that's not going to be a
695.88s: long-term recipe for success
698.34s: sadly one of the questions I'm kind of
702.72s: really curious about here is last week
705.84s: we had some or was it last week the week
708.12s: before we had some pretty good wage
709.74s: numbers come out and then today we had
712.44s: CPI PPI come out and CPI looked okay
716.58s: it I have the same sensation as you do
720.06s: in terms of the overall assessment that
723.00s: I have
723.90s: but I am surprised to see continued
727.44s: economic resilience thus far at least
731.16s: what do you make of kind of the
733.92s: dichotomy between those two
736.80s: uh sort of momentum I think people get
741.18s: into habitual
743.64s: lifestyle and it takes some pain or some
748.14s: Shock
749.22s: like you know you take the stock market
751.14s: for instance and let's say people are
753.24s: used to just lately clicking along and
755.82s: making 10 20 30
758.72s: all you got to do is throw an October 19
762.32s: 1987 that I experienced firsthand as a
765.66s: money manager
767.16s: into the mix where the stock market goes
770.10s: down by 23 percent or something in one
772.38s: day
773.28s: and now you got circuit breakers I
775.74s: understand all that good stuff but let's
777.30s: say it goes down
778.92s: 40 percent in
781.80s: in uh what two weeks
784.44s: would that shock the world yeah it would
787.14s: would it probably change people's plans
790.08s: you know instead of buying that second
792.12s: home maybe we just hunker down now
795.00s: and everything just kind of let's get a
797.76s: little bit closer to home let's make
800.40s: sure our family's okay let's not take
802.38s: that extravagant vacation to Europe
805.02s: all of a sudden
806.64s: um
807.36s: your decisions start changing slightly
810.00s: and that's that can happen very quick
812.34s: and across an entire economy
814.98s: and especially with the the immediacy of
819.72s: you know we could be doing you and I
822.54s: could be you're in San Diego I'm in the
824.76s: mountains of Arizona and we're chatting
827.40s: like we're right in the same room and if
829.92s: we wanted to we could be doing this live
831.84s: on like a Twitter live feeder so then
834.84s: have
835.74s: couple Saturdays ago I was on an
838.50s: interview session where I think he said
841.62s: there was something like 10 000 people
843.72s: signed up for it all around the world
846.42s: crazy
847.74s: and uh so you get that word out and the
851.52s: Panic starts to spread man you look out
854.28s: it could happen
856.20s: just like a wildfire in the Wind
858.60s: right
859.98s: how do you think about your positioning
862.50s: here for me very similar to you I've
865.44s: been like quite utilized most of the
867.72s: year but when we come into times like
869.40s: this especially over the last month I've
872.04s: been pretty selective I still have risk
874.86s: out I'll continue to maintain risk out
876.72s: but I don't know the way you think about
880.98s: rotating your risk or is it just
883.02s: rotating in between your different
884.28s: strategies here no what I I already
887.76s: preset all of the commitments to each of
890.04s: the nine strategies
891.84s: then what I do to
893.94s: control the risk on an ongoing basis is
896.88s: to control the exposure to risk and
898.92s: volatility by way of my position sizing
901.92s: covered in my position sizing book
904.38s: successful Traders size their positions
906.60s: why and how
908.28s: the actual formulas are in there it's
910.50s: easy to use I don't think twice about it
913.20s: and then I just keep in times where it
915.60s: seems to be transitional like this if
917.82s: you think about it I've built up larger
920.76s: and larger wrist structures because of
923.04s: the profits the profitable moves that
925.44s: I've been in so as those get
929.16s: over a certain level and it's different
931.56s: for every single strategy and different
933.54s: for every all sorts of different markets
935.40s: but each specific strategy has its own
938.34s: level of allowable risk so let's take an
942.24s: example of in my Futures training I
944.52s: would have like a half a percent risk to
946.50s: get into the position and I would allow
949.14s: each position to grow to be one percent
951.18s: of my portfolio risk as long as that was
954.00s: due to profits
956.04s: and my stop is struggling to keep up
958.92s: with how fast I'm making money so then
961.62s: what I do is as soon as it gets to one
963.42s: percent or higher I peel off however
966.00s: many positions and Futures that I need
968.34s: to to get back down to one percent
970.68s: allowable
972.30s: so as markets like what we've
974.76s: experienced this year have come along
976.92s: I've just been reducing position sizes
979.62s: now that solves part of the problem
982.44s: second part of the problem is solved in
985.86s: my mind or at least it's addressed by
988.58s: continuing to have movable trailing
992.46s: stops that are large logical
994.86s: I'm giving the market enough room and if
997.26s: the market becomes more volatile I give
999.42s: it plenty of space I use things like ATR
1002.72s: average true range to try to measure the
1005.42s: volatility and keep my stops at least
1007.82s: the volatility or sometimes two times
1009.86s: volatility away from where the market is
1013.12s: and that is usually sufficient to stay
1016.16s: out of the noise but
1018.56s: as the market keeps rolling along like
1020.84s: it has been I keep moving those stops up
1022.76s: so I'm moving the stops up I'm peeling
1025.16s: positions off
1026.72s: I'm always getting ready and I've
1028.88s: they'll stop so in many cases are stop
1031.16s: in Reverse as soon as those stops are
1033.08s: hit I'm now short
1034.82s: well as you have nine strategies and
1037.16s: some like NQ Futures now are already
1040.52s: short but I'm 27 out of 30 long on my
1044.06s: sector timing
1045.62s: I'm starting to get a mixed bag so it
1048.62s: transitions myself automatically and I
1051.14s: don't even have to think about it
1053.06s: and it sounds like the beauty there too
1054.74s: obviously is by having those kind of
1057.82s: balanced Deltas obviously you're
1059.90s: managing the size and whatnot it's still
1062.18s: it stays True To Your Roots right you're
1064.76s: you're making sure that you have some
1067.58s: protection against systematic risk
1070.28s: um yeah when you think about whenever
1074.60s: this unwind comes from the Fed
1077.84s: what trading themes come to mind
1081.98s: for you when that inevitably does occur
1086.36s: well you're talking the interest rates
1089.36s: staying here
1091.42s: uh I wouldn't say bonds would be a great
1095.00s: place unless you're just trying to find
1096.92s: a place to park cash I would keep it on
1099.68s: short-term bonds not long term if
1102.50s: anything one year or less maturity in my
1104.90s: mind
1106.34s: um
1107.06s: what themes come to mind
1109.58s: um
1111.14s: you know well one thing
1113.66s: that strikes me that's been decent and
1116.90s: could get exciting if it broke out would
1119.30s: be the crypto Futures could be an
1121.46s: interesting game
1122.66s: to play because there's no really limit
1125.18s: on how much they could move and they've
1127.40s: been very volatile and volatile
1129.74s: instruments tend to be a Trader's best
1131.90s: friend because after all we all have to
1134.06s: buy and we have to sell and the farther
1136.64s: and faster something moves the more
1138.98s: profitable it can be if you're on the
1140.72s: right side of it so I'd be watching
1142.46s: those markets for starters
1144.44s: I like silver it seems to move quickly
1148.34s: and if we have a situation where
1150.14s: inflation is persistent perhaps that
1152.66s: could have a move right now it's not
1154.76s: it's on the downside
1156.50s: but it could perk up and people get
1159.38s: excited about that especially if the
1161.48s: stock market was selling off and people
1163.22s: thought all right the world's going to
1165.38s: an end I better buy gold now or
1167.00s: something that might be another play
1169.64s: energy seems to be the way
1173.90s: I'm trading unleaded gas I'm trading uh
1177.62s: natural gas Futures and I'm trading many
1180.68s: crude oil Futures and all three of those
1183.38s: look like they have the potential to be
1186.20s: headed upward now and uh
1190.64s: the
1192.56s: I could see where if we have an
1195.92s: inflationary environment you got the the
1197.78s: price of the Commodities products the
1201.74s: the Energy Products could easily go up
1204.38s: against a dollar
1206.84s: uh going down
1208.58s: inflation reducing the value of the
1211.16s: dollar uh the only thing that is the
1215.18s: caveat there is you could have a
1217.28s: if you do get a recession you get a slow
1219.68s: down the economy then all of a sudden
1221.36s: people don't need oil during covid oil
1224.06s: got to a negative price because there
1227.18s: was nobody using this stuff yeah I
1229.34s: didn't want to store it out of storage
1230.62s: so it became a problem
1233.62s: and uh for a few days it actually went
1236.36s: negative on the future so those are some
1239.24s: areas to watch
1240.98s: um you know as usual what I do is I just
1243.26s: have my indicators already onto those
1245.36s: markets and if they start caving in and
1248.66s: going south I'm short and if they
1251.24s: continue on the upside I continue to be
1253.76s: long to move my stops control my
1256.10s: position sizes it's like a broken record
1258.20s: I'm I'm not doing anything today
1260.44s: different than what I did during say the
1263.06s: covid crash or the covid recovery or you
1267.02s: know the markets in 2019 I do the same
1270.86s: thing every day
1272.12s: so and do do you create like a broad
1274.82s: Market thesis as a backdrop and then
1277.88s: look at the individual sectors or is it
1279.86s: just specific to each individual sector
1281.66s: I kind of get a broad Market
1284.44s: read a little bit by how the different
1287.42s: time frames on measuring the stock
1289.64s: market in some of the strategies and how
1292.58s: I end up long or short you know I can
1294.98s: see situations where right now sector
1297.80s: timing which is a longer term is still
1300.08s: cling to the upside 27 out of 30 but the
1303.86s: nine-day
1305.08s: NASDAQ which has been a little weaker
1307.28s: than some of the other indexes anyway
1309.14s: like Russell and those
1311.26s: uh the Dow has been probably the
1314.24s: strongest I think the last few days out
1317.18s: of all the other indexes nasdaq's been
1319.22s: the weakest and not surprisingly it
1321.74s: kicked through its stop losses and uh my
1325.16s: it took me short so I've now got some
1328.16s: short I've got some long I can see the
1330.50s: transition sort of occurring I don't
1332.72s: have to predict it it just sort of
1334.22s: happens naturally
1335.84s: I see and then when you're using kind of
1339.56s: your your sector themes what time frames
1341.72s: do you typically play with those uh
1344.18s: that's also on the Hedge page I use the
1346.04s: same indicators I use for the hedges so
1347.90s: it'd be three different indicators it'd
1350.18s: be uh Keltner doncian and Bollinger and
1353.96s: I would use 21 days
1356.68s: and uh 2.3 times the Keltner 2.0 times
1362.12s: the Bollinger and just a straight 21
1365.90s: days dungeon
1367.64s: to give me my upside uh buy signal for
1370.64s: my sectors
1371.96s: and then I uh because the stock market
1374.48s: is upwardly biased over the very long
1377.30s: term due to inflation and declining
1380.06s: value of the dollar and everything in my
1381.74s: opinion
1382.64s: I use a 50-day indicator to get out
1386.66s: same indicators
1388.58s: so I just changed the 21 to 50.
1392.66s: and I run it that way so I lean towards
1396.08s: the upside more than I'd lean towards
1397.82s: the downside but if it's a bad bear
1399.50s: Market I want to
1401.06s: I want to get out of this stuff
1403.04s: right and then you obvi even those
1406.16s: indicators themselves right they
1407.48s: integrate a lot of volatility to them do
1409.22s: you isolate and trade volatility itself
1411.02s: as well nope got it is through the
1415.10s: products all of those indicators and
1417.74s: everything I do has an aspect of
1420.14s: volatility to it and I try to control
1422.90s: that because I don't want my portfolio
1425.18s: in retirement keeping me up at night so
1428.48s: I try to be careful on how much exposure
1431.00s: I have to volatility and to risk
1433.76s: uh so that's I think part of the reason
1437.06s: for my consistency over what 50 years of
1440.54s: trading now
1442.18s: uh I think you have to be able to
1444.68s: maintain that and have the mental you
1447.32s: either have to be
1449.18s: you know have a lead-lined stomach and
1453.08s: uh a real real
1455.90s: need for excitement and stress uh to to
1459.98s: leverage yourself and to be put in high
1462.62s: risk situations and try to make as much
1465.50s: money as you possibly can and be
1467.60s: stressed out all the time but if you're
1469.76s: going to be Mr Serenity you have to you
1472.88s: have to uh
1474.56s: control your risk of volatility you have
1477.14s: to make sure you're very Diversified and
1479.42s: any one day I mean I never have all 50
1482.78s: to 60 positions
1484.58s: going in my favor or against me it's
1487.46s: always a mixed bag and I'm just looking
1489.86s: to try to make that that total number
1492.56s: when the portfolio is all added up green
1495.68s: as many days as I can I run uh I keep
1498.92s: track of the last running year on a
1501.98s: spreadsheet every afternoon I'm running
1503.60s: about 51 of the days uh I have
1507.44s: profitability
1510.82s: if I can make my days that are
1513.32s: profitable larger than my negative days
1515.66s: and I'm running over 50 percent
1517.66s: profitable days
1519.74s: you know
1521.24s: that's I think you're airing on the
1523.40s: correct side and it keeps life pretty
1525.38s: simple and easy
1527.06s: it seems like the Mr Serenity theme
1529.22s: would apply pretty cleanly there yeah
1532.40s: um another thing I wanted to ask you is
1533.96s: when it came to your hedging do you with
1537.02s: a book of 50 60 positions whatever it is
1539.18s: do you prefer to hedge in the individual
1541.88s: positions or do you apply some sort of
1543.80s: broader portfolio hedge against like a
1546.38s: weighted yeah what I do there is I'll
1549.02s: take the my largest exposure long term
1551.72s: on the equities Market would be the
1553.58s: sector I use sector ETFs and I do that
1556.40s: simply because
1558.32s: I mean I could obviously go out and buy
1560.72s: the Amazons and the metas and all that
1562.88s: and deal with it but what I'm seeing in
1565.58s: my later years here are the last say
1568.22s: five or ten is you're seeing
1571.64s: um you're seeing individual Securities
1573.44s: have just an earnings
1575.96s: announcement or you know it could be
1578.12s: lukewarm where they're they're
1580.30s: prediction for the next quarter isn't as
1583.90s: ambulent as it was the the quarter
1586.70s: before or something and all of a sudden
1588.80s: boom down 17 on the open
1591.80s: it's insane
1593.36s: now some of these issues have lots of
1595.70s: volume I could get in and out I could
1597.62s: try to
1598.72s: diversify that away by
1601.88s: running some automated strategies in the
1604.46s: stock area and let's say I had a 50
1607.46s: stock portfolio well that I could
1609.50s: diminish some of that corporate risk so
1611.36s: that if a stock went down 20 percent on
1614.54s: the open it would only be one fiftieth
1617.24s: of my portfolio or something like that
1620.00s: and I could deal with it and and I could
1622.22s: do that but it just seems to me that if
1625.28s: I instead want some tech stocks I could
1627.98s: go do xlk as a spider it's the
1632.00s: technology spider and now I own all of
1635.00s: these stocks and I don't have that
1636.74s: corporate risk anymore I just have an
1639.38s: ETF that has a focus on technology I buy
1642.56s: it when it breaks out to the upside and
1644.18s: I sell it when it goes to the downside
1645.68s: now to answer your hedging question then
1648.50s: if I have 20 or excuse me 30 different
1651.20s: sectors of all these things that range
1653.36s: from energy sectors to even a junk bond
1656.72s: sector International small cap large
1660.68s: caps
1661.96s: entered
1664.12s: agricultural all sorts of different
1666.20s: sectors
1667.34s: I can be long or I can go to cash on all
1670.04s: of those well
1671.96s: as we start getting the stock market to
1674.48s: cave in
1676.16s: the hedges go on what I'm doing there is
1679.16s: I'm using an es index
1682.76s: broadly Diversified index
1686.72s: short
1688.40s: to go against all these individual
1690.44s: sectors long
1692.60s: so the way I do that is I look at what
1695.24s: my exposure is the day I have to put the
1697.58s: Hedge on
1698.78s: and let's say I'm now down to I don't
1701.48s: know 21 out of 30 sectors I calculate
1704.12s: what that exposure is and I put on a
1707.30s: hedge that balances that and I'm
1709.04s: essentially out of the market
1711.02s: got it yeah it was one rather than do
1713.96s: individual trades times 21 I can do one
1717.32s: trade and get a pretty good clamping
1720.02s: done on risk it was just one trade it's
1722.66s: super simple
1724.04s: yeah and that's actually the particular
1726.26s: reason why I asked that question because
1727.40s: I know a lot of people that listen to
1728.84s: this they tend to manage smaller books
1730.40s: right a lot of newer retail Traders
1732.08s: they're probably 15 positions or less
1734.24s: but I think it's good for them to
1736.04s: understand some of the the trade-offs
1738.08s: that come when you can kind of create
1740.00s: inherent diversification via all of the
1742.22s: products you carry but like you said if
1745.22s: we wanted direct Hedges sure they're
1747.50s: slightly more accurate but then you have
1748.76s: to run through all of these products and
1750.56s: hedge them
1751.64s: individually well and you also have to
1754.22s: be careful tax wise in the U.S uh if you
1757.76s: had something directly
1759.92s: then you could get into strange
1762.08s: situations where the IRS could say and
1764.18s: I'm not a tax expert so let's add that
1766.64s: disclaimer don't take this ask your own
1769.22s: Tax Advisor to see if I'm correct but it
1772.46s: seems to me that that becomes the
1774.26s: equivalent of possibly selling your
1776.18s: position out
1777.38s: and then the IRS says well you know you
1780.14s: hedged it so you had zero risk and no
1783.38s: chance for anything other than zero risk
1786.08s: so therefore we're going to say you
1788.54s: really sold that stock even though you
1790.64s: didn't
1791.42s: and we want to our piece of the action
1793.70s: in my case I've got
1796.64s: you know 21 sector funds or something 30
1800.72s: whatever I have at the moment
1803.84s: and then I got a short sale position in
1807.02s: a standard Porsche 500 futures those are
1810.02s: completely different things however
1813.20s: my analysis of how the stock market's
1816.26s: been correlated over my lifetime if you
1818.90s: looked at International stocks all the
1821.24s: stocks in the world let's say
1823.28s: you probably were down when I first
1825.38s: started in the business back in the late
1827.66s: 70s early 80s
1829.94s: you probably were down in the
1832.42s: 60-something percent correlations
1835.64s: around the world especially if you had
1838.34s: International stocks in the mix
1840.80s: you're approaching 85 Plus now
1845.42s: the stocks in the world are no longer
1847.70s: Diversified
1849.14s: and I think it's largely because we have
1851.78s: so many of these broad-based indexes now
1853.94s: and all these stocks are part of these
1855.62s: indexes and there's lots of index funds
1858.26s: that have tons of money that they have
1859.94s: to go out and buy all these issues and
1861.86s: put them in the indexes in the ETFs and
1864.62s: all that stuff so everything's just
1866.90s: becoming correlated and it's hard to
1870.08s: find a lack of correlation to truly be
1873.02s: Diversified in a straight stock
1874.82s: portfolio long only
1876.92s: but if I know that most stocks like if
1879.98s: we go into a let's say a 2000 where tech
1884.72s: stocks go down 80 percent on the NASDAQ
1888.44s: uh and you know that hurts pretty badly
1893.42s: if you're short the NASDAQ against the
1896.06s: tech stock portfolio you're just kind of
1899.06s: doing okay you know you might lose a
1901.28s: little you might make a little even the
1903.08s: NASDAQ index Futures short might make
1906.20s: more than your portfolio loses and you
1908.72s: might come out a little ahead on the
1910.04s: deal on the day of the crash of 87
1914.24s: we were managing a pension plan that I
1916.64s: put in my book The all-weather Trader I
1919.04s: I cited this example uh we were short
1923.20s: well before
1925.12s: going into the crash day
1928.34s: and we had the portfolio it was a couple
1931.04s: million dollar portfolio of stocks
1933.14s: completely hedged and we ended up at the
1935.30s: end of the day of the crash in that
1937.34s: portfolio I had about a fraction of one
1940.28s: percent so the Hedge worked pretty well
1943.34s: actually made a little more on the Hedge
1945.26s: than we lost on the portfolio
1948.32s: and
1949.46s: you know that's what you can achieve
1951.80s: with one position you just knock down
1953.90s: your risk it's hard to with a a huge
1957.80s: portfolio a couple million dollars lots
1959.84s: and lots of positions to try to sell out
1962.12s: all that and take taxable consequences
1964.88s: is very difficult and especially if some
1968.06s: of the issues don't trade a lot we were
1969.98s: into some small cap stuff at that point
1972.50s: that was our specialty and you don't
1974.42s: have the liquidity but you have a
1976.64s: liquidity in es futures
1980.24s: multiple times per second
1983.96s: no problem
1985.34s: what do you think of small caps kind of
1989.00s: so far this year but then also looking
1991.22s: forward it seems like you know
1993.08s: persistent inflation would obviously
1995.36s: hurt smaller companies like that pretty
1997.34s: meaningfully but a lot of people are
1999.68s: speculating that the unwind will you
2002.20s: know really lift them up a bit is that
2003.94s: kind of what you're seeing or something
2005.02s: else I I like to think that a small
2008.20s: company and I was one when I was a money
2010.66s: manager I had 10 employees I was small
2014.38s: I think there's a the flexibility to do
2016.84s: things a lot quicker and a lot faster
2020.02s: and a little more Innovative you don't
2021.94s: have to answer to
2023.56s: you know a board of directors and a
2025.72s: committee of 10 trying to opine on every
2028.00s: aspect of this particular decision
2030.70s: so there's a lot of advantage that a
2032.68s: small company has
2034.66s: versus a larger competitor the large
2038.08s: competitor on the other hand has staying
2040.66s: power financing
2042.48s: expertise perhaps in-house that they
2045.40s: don't have to go outside of a house to
2048.22s: get and so they can tend to squash some
2051.10s: small competitors
2053.56s: um so the way I like to think of small
2056.50s: cap stocks is if they're just in a same
2060.04s: industry and and competing for the same
2062.62s: product and it's a generic product of
2064.54s: some sort there's nothing special there
2069.04s: I lean towards the liquidity of the
2071.14s: larger company because I think that then
2073.96s: you have that ability to survive perhaps
2077.02s: tough times
2078.34s: on the other side of it uh if you have a
2081.16s: small company that has done something
2083.56s: like a niche you know like back in the
2085.84s: days of covid Zoom became a household
2088.74s: it's now you know not if we're going to
2091.84s: do a teleconference call it's are we
2094.06s: going to zoom it's almost become like
2096.90s: xeroxies became copying something you
2101.02s: xeroxed it even though Xerox was a brand
2104.14s: name you were xeroxing the piece of
2106.72s: paper and
2108.30s: uh held down the the South my wife our
2111.82s: is fine she's from Jackson Mississippi
2114.40s: originally and she's fond of telling me
2117.16s: that when you uh in my Northern New York
2120.94s: terms uh would say that you'd want a
2123.82s: soda pop
2125.14s: no in the South you get a Coke right
2127.84s: right what kind of book a seven up yeah
2130.84s: or do you want a Dr Pepper or you want a
2133.12s: Coca-Cola or a Pepsi but they're all
2135.28s: Cokes right
2137.10s: uh and so I think that's what we face
2140.80s: with uh
2142.48s: small cap is finding those interesting
2145.00s: stories that
2146.92s: are supplying a niche that the big guys
2150.10s: haven't figured out yet
2152.02s: those are the ones that are really the
2154.72s: you know the Thousand Baggers that you
2157.00s: can really do very well with and
2159.46s: establish long-term positions so those
2161.74s: are the ones I would always try to seek
2163.36s: out if I was trying to go into small cap
2165.10s: land
2166.18s: got it I know we're coming up on time
2168.70s: here
2169.84s: um but
2171.24s: do you trade orange juice Futures yes
2175.42s: what what's going on there I was looking
2178.24s: at the movement I don't trade orange
2179.56s: juice features myself very much but I
2181.54s: can't help but not see that move and
2183.70s: follow the move at this point but what
2185.74s: do you like yeah what's the deal
2188.02s: um
2189.16s: ah I I'm not a fundamentalist so I'll be
2193.12s: just taking some pots pot guesses at
2195.82s: this uh uh but there's two things that
2199.42s: seems to always affect the long term of
2202.48s: orange juice number one it's the weather
2205.30s: in Florida during the winter because it
2207.82s: seems like perpetually all the trips
2209.74s: I've ever made to Orlando I'd get there
2212.92s: in the middle of January or something in
2214.84s: a frost hits and everybody's got the
2217.36s: smudge pots out and they're trying to
2219.52s: warm up the air over top of the orange
2221.92s: crop the orange trees
2224.14s: and then invariably you'd get these
2226.42s: issue these super winter freezes that
2230.92s: would knock out
2232.96s: whatever 20 percent and pick a number 10
2235.96s: 20 of all the the orange trees would
2239.38s: just die they can't take the cold right
2242.98s: so then what usually happens because
2246.10s: Florida is so is growing so fast
2248.98s: is you know if the Orange Grove happens
2251.68s: to be on the outskirts of Orlando
2254.26s: the guy says you know I'm tired of doing
2257.32s: the farming thing and losing 10 20 of my
2260.56s: orange crop every so often this isn't
2263.74s: worth it my property is now worth
2266.38s: millions I can retire and go I buy a
2271.30s: place in the Bahamas and uh enjoy life
2274.84s: I'm done with this and so one more
2277.36s: orange crop goes so long term what ends
2279.88s: up happening is the the amount of orange
2283.84s: crop
2285.30s: keeps kind of struggling to to be as
2289.24s: prolific as it was back in the day
2292.42s: so I think those two factors are
2295.18s: creating a lot of uncertainty in exactly
2298.00s: the supply and demand of orange juice
2300.24s: and uh I think there's been some nice
2302.98s: moves so traders that like to just
2305.62s: measure a trend and go with it
2307.84s: it's been very very good this year both
2310.90s: up and down
2312.52s: yeah it's yeah I because it popped up
2315.46s: back like early this year I want to say
2317.50s: like February March where it had like
2319.48s: that one just vertical set and then I
2321.46s: was like wow that's kind of interesting
2322.72s: and then ever since then I watched it
2324.58s: March from 200 to over 300 over the
2327.76s: course of you know like March to now and
2329.62s: I was like man yeah one of one of my
2331.18s: posts on Twitter back in probably
2333.94s: February or right in there when it was
2335.86s: going vertical was uh orange juice
2339.16s: Futures remind me of a b-22 taking off
2342.16s: at after a Chinese spy balloon
2350.26s: that's kind of the way the chart looked
2352.78s: yeah yeah of course we let the Spy
2355.60s: balloon just drift across the entire
2356.98s: country but you know that's a whole
2358.78s: other story I wonder we want to take it
