0.12s: oh boy this is a Hot Topic but we're
2.16s: going to dive right into it the cost of
5.00s: defining your risk in zero DTE plays a
9.48s: lot of people don't like this
10.60s: conversation because it starts to
12.84s: highlight the reality of things but as
15.76s: you hopefully know my goal isn't to
18.76s: persuade or dissuade anybody from
20.84s: anything my goal is to share with you
23.56s: the objective reality of things and then
26.68s: let you make the decisions for yourself
28.36s: so the goal of this video is going to
29.64s: walk you through some different examples
32.24s: of undefined and defined risk zero DTE
36.16s: trades through very specifically picked
39.60s: markets so you can see the bad and some
41.92s: of the good and then combined so that
44.20s: you can see what this all looks like and
46.76s: then at the end of the video I'm going
48.32s: to share some Concepts that you can use
50.56s: to help inform the way you structure
52.84s: these kinds of trades in the future
55.16s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
56.68s: back to the outliers shout out to the
58.00s: patreon family consider signing up and
60.64s: let's get straight to it so real quick
62.48s: upfront recap together defined versus
65.48s: undefined risk trades it is pretty
68.04s: simple when we think about a defined
70.00s: risk trade in this context we're going
72.20s: to look at Short iron condors and this
75.60s: is a way for you to sell options to
79.32s: capitalize on variance risk premiums
82.64s: which if you're unfamiliar with what
84.00s: that is I'll throw a link in the notes
85.80s: below for you to check out but when
88.08s: we're trading short premium zero DTE
91.60s: strategies that's essentially what you
94.08s: are trying to capture variance risk
96.64s: premiums now the beautiful part about a
99.32s: short iron Condor is that notice this
102.12s: there's defined risk both to the upside
105.52s: and the downside this means that even if
107.44s: there's a massive move you are cushioned
110.60s: yet you still have this really nice big
113.48s: profit Zone that looks pretty good to me
116.16s: but as with all things in trading there
118.40s: are tradeoffs which we'll get to in just
120.84s: a second now let's take a look at a
123.72s: different example which is going to be
126.80s: the short strangle The Profit Zone on
129.76s: your short strangles typically will be
131.68s: wider if you have the same short Delta
134.80s: so in this case both of these use short
137.24s: 20 Delta in SPX however notice how both
141.96s: to the upside and to the downside
143.88s: undefined risk this is a problem for a
146.52s: lot of people not just because if your
148.40s: account size is too small that you can't
150.20s: handle taking on a position of that size
152.12s: but then there's also the mental
154.16s: component of undefined risk that scares
156.84s: a lot of people and rightfully so if you
158.92s: want to exist as a Trader for any
160.68s: meaningful duration of time you need to
162.52s: be thoughtful about risk and if you hear
164.68s: risk undefined kind of a problem but
167.08s: there are different things we can do to
169.20s: help cushion this a little bit and
171.80s: ideally to move people towards a
173.96s: healthier relationship with undefined
176.40s: risk strategies because we have to talk
178.68s: about what's going on on here as you may
180.92s: or may not know I am a nerd and I'm
183.64s: continually looking for studies on
187.28s: markets in general and this is a pretty
189.32s: new one this is from 14 January 2024 and
193.04s: this looks at zero DTE options from 6
197.88s: 2016 out to 2024 and I want to share a
201.80s: specific section of this with you that
203.84s: I've bookmarked which is this zero DTE
207.68s: options offer a substantial variance
210.16s: risk premium the exact thing that we're
212.28s: looking to trade and if you're looking
214.28s: for more context on this whole zero DTE
216.88s: trading concept I'll throw another video
219.16s: in the notes below that will give you a
221.36s: much broader landscape where here we're
223.68s: kind of getting directly to a specific
225.52s: comparison that might confuse some folks
227.76s: if you're not familiar with the
228.80s: landscape then here it says with implied
232.24s: variants consistently higher than
234.76s: realized variance until settlement this
237.08s: that's what variance risk premiums are
239.24s: that's why there's a market here however
241.48s: the success of various strategies is not
244.44s: guaranteed the other thing to note
246.60s: though is that some of these strategies
248.36s: have high volatility in skewed returns
251.20s: that are held to expiration so all of
253.32s: this is to say and you should absolutely
255.32s: take a look at this study it's fantastic
257.64s: it's one of my favorite recent studies
260.00s: on this as compared to the other one
261.84s: about analyzing the cost of zero DTE
265.64s: strategies but in this case the
268.24s: landscape is if you are selling this
270.68s: premium you are providing liquidity
273.32s: which is a utility to the market and
276.76s: part of that is we are trying to capture
279.88s: the phenomenon that implied variance is
283.64s: higher on average than realized variants
286.84s: sometimes markets move so if you get a
288.60s: big enough move this can hurt really bad
291.08s: so what I want to talk about now is an
293.20s: example to help us dive further into
296.08s: this so here I look at 1 Jan 2022 to 31
301.48s: December 2023 why these two years I
304.40s: wanted to pick actually a short time
306.88s: frame that includes two extremes 2022
310.04s: was a pretty big down year about 20% and
312.40s: then 2023 was a decent up year up 23%
316.32s: and the good part about that is if you
317.84s: look at those two years together 2023
321.40s: was not a big enough upe to overcome the
324.76s: loss from 2022 so this gives you two
328.40s: beautiful views you have a pretty big
331.28s: severe down year and then you have a
333.72s: subsequent upe that is strong but still
336.88s: not strong enough to overcome those two
339.12s: years combined in terms of an average
340.84s: return if you had bought at the highs
343.76s: held all the way through so working down
346.48s: this side over here we have a bunch of
348.44s: different things and if you'll notice I
350.48s: honed in on short calls and puts at of
353.64s: 20 Delta so a strangle but then for this
356.60s: part of the sample I'm showing you the
358.84s: iron con doors at three different
361.16s: locations Long wings at 5 10 and 15
364.32s: Deltas these are all entered at 12 p.m.
367.64s: Pacific Time 300 p.m. Eastern so an hour
370.24s: before the close you can Tinker with the
372.48s: entry time and you'll see slightly
373.88s: different results the point I want to
375.44s: highlight here more so is few things
378.40s: first notice the tighter the wings so 20
381.80s: Delta and a 15 Delta long it had the
384.36s: worst overall p&l out of these three a
387.52s: lower compound annual growth rate a much
390.52s: better draw down you would expect that
393.20s: if you have less room to move we would
395.36s: expect to lose Less in total so if you
397.24s: go down here to the max loss it's only
399.24s: 775 bucks pretty light as compared to
402.12s: the 20 Delta shorts five Delta Longs the
405.00s: max loss on that was 3145 quite a bit
408.20s: bigger now notice though the expected
410.84s: return on these two outside samples
413.68s: which is negative in the long run which
416.08s: is problematic for the strategies now so
418.68s: what is the c cost what is the cost of
421.60s: buying these Wings well let's take a
423.76s: look if you had sold just the 20 Delta
428.04s: short call and put all outse the same
431.36s: you would make
432.88s: $26,995 over the same time frame your
436.72s: compound annual growth rate goes from a
438.96s: high of 4.7 to 12.3 your Max draw down
443.04s: is 9.8 this is still pretty damn bad
447.72s: average win per trade is 50 six bucks so
450.08s: on and so forth so you can see that by
452.60s: just getting rid of the Wings and
455.00s: accepting the volatility in the returns
458.00s: you in aggregate make way more money
460.68s: look at the max loss here though
463.56s: 5657 that's a big Max loss depending on
466.12s: the size of your account and if you're
467.92s: not capable of withstanding that kind of
470.72s: Max loss on a single trade on a one lot
473.08s: you have to find different ways to get
474.92s: Innovative here you can scale down
477.00s: because if you notice here the max
478.84s: profit and and the max loss both not
480.92s: touched on either of these so what
483.24s: happens if we start to modulate that
485.48s: just a little bit well if we take a look
487.80s: at a 200% and then a 300% Max loss for
492.20s: the 20 Delta strangle notice how good
495.04s: the returns become our p&l grows from 26
498.64s: to 36 Max loss contracts from 5600 to
502.68s: 2200 so what's going on here we're
504.92s: cutting off the tals if you take a look
506.88s: at the number of winning trades in this
508.44s: scenario there's 358 then if you take a
510.64s: look at the number of winning trades in
511.92s: this scenario there's 344 so what this
513.92s: is telling me is that the difference
516.48s: between these two conditions is 14
518.28s: trades that would have been profitable
520.88s: that we cut off using this Max loss you
523.76s: generally want to avoid that but in
525.76s: doing so in this sample we've so grossly
528.80s: decreased our Max loss that in General
531.56s: on average we're not cutting off so many
534.00s: trades that would go outside of our
535.52s: range and then back in that our average
537.80s: win per trade is actually very strong
539.84s: and then 300% Max loss brings us back
542.20s: down a little bit but it's still better
544.12s: than the unmanaged p&l so now you might
547.40s: be thinking well Eric if we're managing
549.76s: the max loss we should do that for the
553.32s: iron Condors right sure why
556.56s: not it sucks wait what what's going on
561.52s: here buying these Wings is very
563.72s: expensive so even if you buy the wings
566.60s: which would then manage your loss side
569.32s: of the equation and then you apply
571.84s: Management on top of that you perform
574.16s: worse that is a problem with using
577.20s: winged strategies now in this case
579.44s: you'll notice these are all 20 Delta
582.00s: shorts 15 Delta Longs you can look at
584.84s: this across the gamut it is going to
588.48s: negatively impact your return potential
591.64s: in this case with the five Delta long
595.52s: options you would increase the overall
598.16s: profitability of this from 9600 bucks
600.72s: you would kick it up to
602.40s: 177,000 which is much better but in the
605.20s: long run that cost adds over time none
608.16s: of this includes commissions which
609.96s: wouldn't gigantically sway this either
612.44s: way but the more important function here
615.28s: is the drag that you're adding to your
617.04s: returns so you have to make a choice as
619.76s: a Trader you have to determine what
622.36s: function you're providing the market if
624.20s: you think that you just get to sell
625.80s: options and you should just make money
628.80s: because you're selling but then you want
630.16s: to buy Wings to protect your position
632.84s: you can do that that means that we are
635.08s: placing a premium on our risk aversion
637.76s: and that's going to negatively impact
639.48s: our profitability you can see in this
641.48s: case the way that I typically lean I
643.60s: prefer to Simply use naked options you
646.60s: can use max Loss Management if you're so
649.92s: inclined I think that's okay notice how
652.36s: the max profit is not managed in any of
654.96s: these that's because that simply adds
657.72s: more transactions
659.56s: and as you add taking a Max profit
661.96s: you'll notice the p&l on most of these
664.28s: decreases in efficacy but if you're
666.60s: interested in seeing that we can do
667.96s: another video that dives deep into this
670.08s: so now let's talk about real quick the
671.72s: application of this what does all this
673.00s: mean first thing you have to Define what
675.68s: your risk tolerance is what Market
678.52s: function are you performing then after
681.64s: you define that you have to figure out
683.96s: what kind of Trades fit your risk
686.56s: tolerance understanding the trade-offs
688.32s: thereof and again especially for zero
690.72s: DTE trades where we don't experience
693.48s: overnight Gap risk I tend to be on this
698.00s: side you want to interact with the
699.76s: positions as little as possible to
701.24s: reduce your cost overall that is a
703.36s: killer again that video I referenced
705.16s: earlier will dive deep into detail on
707.96s: how dangerous that can be the cool part
710.40s: is you can optimize these even more
713.52s: considering 2022 which was an aggressive
716.68s: down year so we don't have to cherry
718.76s: pick pick the results to create the
720.84s: outcome that we want that's in Sample
722.88s: and out of sample kind of make an
724.56s: abomination of a statistical process but
727.08s: you can come up with a pretty simple
728.44s: rule set when it comes to vix levels SPX
731.76s: levels or Trend to determine when you
734.76s: choose to enter versus when you choose
736.48s: not to enter but without any of that you
739.36s: still have strategies here that are
741.52s: double digigit compound annual growth
743.52s: rates that survived during a pretty
746.68s: massive draw down in 22 and performed
749.48s: just fine during the subsequent Market
752.32s: rally in 23 any questions let me know
755.80s: what should I test next throw it in the
758.12s: comments below like subscribe be an
759.96s: outlier I'll see you guys later
