0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.40s: Welcome to another outlier,
3.40s: options trading, quick tips.
4.84s: We learned something new in three minutes or less.
6.52s: Today we are talking about what is an implied volatility surface.
12.52s: Now, this sounds way crazier than it actually is.
16.32s: It's very simple.
17.60s: It's simply plots the implied volatility's for each strike
23.24s: across different expiration.
25.32s: And there's a couple different ways that you
26.60s: can visualize this.
28.40s: There are simple versions like the one you see over my head.
31.92s: This is from Think or Swim.
33.72s: And this simply shows in different lines,
37.20s: they represent different expiration's.
39.24s: And then your x-axis represents different strikes.
43.72s: And then your y-axis represents different implied volatility.
47.36s: So we can compare the strike volatility
52.16s: between individual expressions.
55.44s: We can do it across explorations.
58.88s: We can look at the relationship between different
62.36s: explorations and the overall gaps at different points.
65.96s: And another version that people are probably more familiar with
69.60s: is this here, which is actually you can create something
72.80s: like this in Python.
74.20s: But what it does is it essentially removes the three different lines
77.96s: and it combines them into a 3D model.
81.32s: So you can see that there's the same traits.
85.28s: But this case, again, you can build this in Python.
89.00s: And it will just consolidate these lines down into 3D surface.
94.00s: So there's a couple different ways you can visualize it.
96.16s: But the information is about the same.
97.68s: We're looking for any anomalies.
100.28s: We're looking for the relationship of volatility.
102.48s: We're looking to see if the put side is much higher
105.24s: than the call side.
106.04s: That is very, very frequent.
108.00s: And that's typically for a lot of things like large cap stocks.
111.12s: For people have big stock holdings.
113.08s: And they tend to hedge risk to the downside.
115.16s: So it puts get priced up a bit more.
117.28s: Then this typically means that there's a lower probability
120.56s: of a massive downside move and a higher probability
123.08s: of a smaller upside move.
124.84s: And then sometimes you can find names like GameStop,
127.32s: which is actually typically inverted, where the call side,
132.88s: out of the money calls will have much higher implied volatility,
135.64s: then the put side.
137.12s: And this is also very common for names that are really
140.00s: expected to have these big upside potential moves.
143.16s: So you can learn a lot from implied volatility surface models.
146.88s: I actually have a video that goes much deeper
149.28s: into implied volatility.
150.36s: You can check that out on the channel.
152.24s: Be an outlier.
152.96s: See you later.
