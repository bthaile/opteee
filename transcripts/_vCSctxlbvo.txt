0.00s: Why do people trade options?
2.00s: It really boils down to the fact that they are tactical investments.
6.28s: They allow you to create things that are very specific.
8.64s: One of those things is they provide a lot of leverage.
12.00s: So if we take a look at buying 100 shares of Tesla at 317,
16.60s: that essentially would take up $31,000 to put the position on.
19.84s: If Tesla goes up by 15%, you would make 47-61,
26.84s: 4761 bucks. Good day.
29.72s: Whereas if you put on the equivalent size position using long-dated options,
35.32s: your position would be up $15,800 for the same amount of money.
40.60s: That's leverage. Now, leverage gives, leverage takes.
43.60s: There's drawbacks to this, such as if Tesla doesn't move,
47.32s: then you might start losing some of the value of your options.
50.60s: Now, again, you can mitigate that by going further out in time,
55.16s: and really buy a series of steps to buy options.
59.08s: Smarter. I have a video that talks about that that I will share with you below.
62.28s: But options can provide leverage among other things.
67.52s: You know, I'll be later.
