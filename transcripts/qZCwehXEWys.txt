0.00s: leveraged ETFs can literally supercharge your returns, but it's not without risk.
6.08s: You're going to see higher overall volatility of the portfolio.
9.52s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through how we can trade something like
14.08s: my favorite strategy, the covered strangle, in something like a leveraged ETF such as
19.12s: T-T-Tribal Qs, and how we can build a system around it to strike a balance between our
24.16s: return potential, but then also managing our risk side of the equation.
28.40s: So let's get right in. This is what we're going to run through. We're going to go end to end.
34.56s: I'm going to walk you through some high-level concepts, and then we are going to get into some
39.36s: details on how to think about and form this kind of thing for yourself. So let's get right to it.
44.24s: Very first thing is the covered strangle for those who are unfamiliar. I'll throw a link in the
48.32s: notes below, but it's a bullish trade. We're going to be long shares, sell cash-secured puts,
53.68s: and have ratio short calls against the long shares. We'll have more details on that in a little bit.
58.32s: But that's the overview for the strategy. Now, the whole idea of a leveraged application is to
64.88s: amplify your returns through additional beta. What does that mean? Let me show you.
70.40s: If we pop over to the platform and we take a look at QQQ on the left hand side here,
74.88s: this is a five-year weekly chart. I want you to notice the move that happens here. It goes from
80.24s: 402-ish down to 261-ish. This is from 2022 into 2023. This is actually during the bear market
90.00s: that we had that year. If you look at QQQ compared to T-triple cues, T-triple cues went from
94.96s: 91 down to 17. Notice the difference. Qs is about a 36% drop. T-triple cues is an 80-plus
104.88s: percent drop. If you have $100,000 through here, at the end of it, you have 20. That's difficult
111.12s: for people to manage. Most people bail on this during the worst possible time, which is as it's
117.12s: in this free fall. We're going to talk about how we can manage this additional beta so that we can
123.44s: actually take advantage of the leverage without taking on excessive portfolio volatility.
129.36s: What does that mean for best practices? We're going to have to pay attention to
133.04s: because something like T-triple cues is three times leveraged the daily returns of QQQ.
138.72s: So it's essentially behaving as three times the number of shares on an intraday basis.
143.28s: Now, volatility decay refers to how leveraged ETFs behave. To summarize this at a high level,
150.80s: it essentially means volatility is going to be exacerbated during prolonged consecutive
156.72s: down periods because of the sequence of returns. So if we take a look at this quick example here,
162.64s: you can see I'm showing you a perspective return sequence for QQQ versus T-triple cues.
168.64s: And T-triple cues were calling it three times the daily return of QQQ. This doesn't take into
174.48s: account the fact that there is a discrepancy between these. It's not going to be perfectly matched.
178.32s: Sometimes it will be slightly more. Sometimes it will be slightly less. But just for the example
182.72s: of volatility decay, I'm using one to one. So for QQQ, if we have a one percent day, a negative
188.88s: two percent day, followed by a negative five percent day, followed by a negative two percent day.
193.36s: That's what this math is showing us. This is day one, day two, day three, day four. So the required
197.92s: move to get back to break even here is 8.52 percent. If we have this sequence of returns,
205.28s: if we do the same in T-triple cues three times levered, the required move becomes 29.27 percent.
212.24s: What does this mean? This is volatility decay because now if QQs shows that 8.52 percent move,
219.44s: QQs is now back to break even. But T-triple cues is not because that only translates to a 25.56
227.68s: percent move in T-triple cues. So then we still have another several percent to go to get back
234.08s: to break even. And for a quick visual of this, this is exactly why if we compare this period from
239.92s: Qs to T-triple cues, take a look. Qs already passed and started making highs off of this period
246.64s: in here. T-triple cues still hasn't gotten back the highs. This is volatility decay because of
252.72s: this period here. So what that tells us is we have to be very, very thoughtful about avoiding that
257.92s: volatility decay. Otherwise, it can be a problem for us. So now let's talk about the strategy. I already
262.40s: have a series that I'm building around this. I have two videos that I've done outlining this
266.80s: kind of pretty far in depth. So I'll link to those below. And I'm also going to start reviewing this
271.68s: on the Monday night YouTube live session. So you can check in for updates on it there. I'm using
276.40s: real money. It's for an example. So let's take a look at how to build a strategy around this. We use
282.72s: the outlier strategy process. So we're going to analyze the profit mechanism, the mechanism indicators.
289.12s: We're going to find structures that fit. We're going to build a strategy. In this case, we're coming
293.28s: into this problem set, knowing the structure that we want to use. We want to use a covered
297.28s: strangle. Why do we want to use a covered strangle? For a bunch of different reasons. But in this case,
301.76s: this is designed to be a little bit more of a hands-off approach to trading leverage. So this is
308.56s: something that I might run in an IRA account that I'm not necessarily trading a ton or a 401k
315.44s: account. Or if I was on active duty in the Marine Court and I was going to be deployed for a while,
319.84s: something like that. So this is not designed to purely optimize best possible return and risk
326.48s: profile. We have the added injunt of wanting to be a little more hands-off less babysitting. So
333.20s: what does this look like? Well, the profit mechanism here is pretty simple. It's going to be capital
337.60s: gains via trend drift and beta. This is essentially how we're going to use something like T-Triple
345.68s: Qs to outperform, buy and hold, and QQQ. So the profit mechanism traits and indicators are pretty
354.08s: simple. We know as traits that we're looking at something that's very volatile, it's three times
358.16s: the daily leverage, which is really important to track. And it's going to have excessive beta
362.88s: compared to, again, the non-leveraged counterpart. So it's going to move around a lot, and it's going
368.40s: to have options that have good volatility in them, which is why the covered strangle is a great fit
373.44s: for this. For signals, in terms of determining if we want to get in, if we want to get out,
378.08s: if we want to scale up, if we want to scale down, we can use things like moving averages,
382.08s: standard deviation channels, RSI, kind of my standard technical analysis tool suite, which I'll
387.76s: link to a video in below that goes through that in detail. But most of this is going to be stuff
391.84s: that I'm going to look at to make adjustments relatively and frequently. This isn't going to be
395.92s: something I'm day trading. So our signals have to match the overall time frame. The strategy,
401.28s: as we already discussed, is going to be a covered strangle. Other things that could fit into this
405.44s: are ratio called diagonals, buy and hold, buy and hold with different kind of exit protocols,
411.60s: instead of just holding through things, that kind of stuff. So what does this strategy itself
416.64s: look like in this case? Well, we're going to make sure that we're long at least 100 shares to
421.12s: preserve upside potential and to allow us to sell calls against the longs at a ratio. And again,
426.32s: if you're unfamiliar with what that is, check out that video below. We're going to sell cash
429.76s: secure puts. Both of these are going to be within the 50 DTE window to maximize theta decay,
434.48s: but we're not doing super short terms so that we're having to adjust it all the time. We're going to
439.36s: focus on rolling to maximize profit over basis adjustments. So we have to pay attention to when we
446.24s: choose to roll because we want to make as much money as we can in the scenario versus worrying about
451.12s: updating our basis. Risk is going to be managed primarily via size. I already showed you, and I will
457.84s: show you additional draw downs, but in a recent example, we had a 82% drawdown. I don't want to do
463.44s: that. So we're going to have to find different ways to navigate around that drawdown so that we're
468.24s: not experiencing that. Moving averages to set entrance and exit triggers completely viable. We'll
474.08s: talk about some different variations of that. It can help a lot. Otherwise, you can use sizing as
479.84s: another method to decrease your overall risk. And then for me, I'm going to use a 5% move as my
485.36s: scale window. So if something moves down 5%, I'm going to decide scale in scale out, stay the same,
490.40s: but I'm going to use that as a trigger to modulate how much money I'm using when because one of the
494.96s: most important things during this kind of down move is to have enough money to scale into the trade
501.60s: as it's plummeting so that you can improve your basis so that you can hit your recovery point
507.36s: much, much sooner. Because if we take the example of top taking it, you bought it here, for example,
511.84s: at 90 you take the crash down here to 16, you're still not back to break even. But if you were just
516.48s: 35% invested here and then every 5% drawdown you added a little bit up until it you added three times
524.24s: in the course of two weeks, then you stretch that out to maybe adding on 10% drawdowns until you're
529.28s: fully invested towards the bottom here, you already hit break even and you're making money again.
534.00s: The scaling element of this is going to be very, very important. So quick overview. This is from
539.04s: Portfolio Visualizer. This is just showing the difference between T-Triple Cues and Cues for
544.16s: total returns, annualized standard deviation, which is really important, and then also drawdowns.
549.44s: Again, this is not fully correct because I'm showing you on the chart there what it actually
553.68s: looks like, but it's pretty close. So this is showing you that if you buy and hold T-Triple Cues,
557.76s: you can have some really great ears. However, you're going to have potentially really bad times.
562.88s: He's a real bad times, bro. So now let's talk about how this overall system performs.
569.28s: So what I did is I just ran through Python and I plotted a couple different moving averages, a 22
574.96s: period, a 50 period, a 150 period, and then I looked originally at buy and hold performance in T-Triple
581.76s: Cues versus Cues from 2010, comparing the maximum drawdowns, which we already knew this. This is
586.16s: just a visual representation of it. So what my mind is thinking maybe we can use moving averages to
592.96s: cut this. And if we take a look at something like this where the number of touches, or a 22 versus
599.28s: 50 versus 150, you can see that the shorter term the moving average is, the more frequently it's
605.60s: going to be interacted with. Some of these other numbers down here are not accurate. You can ignore
609.52s: those. This is literally just for the touches. So at a quick eyeball of just using a very basic
615.92s: straight entry-exercretaria, you can see that we can manipulate a T-Triple Cues strategy to
621.60s: very much outperform Cues. And we can also decrease the maximum drawdown if we're really thoughtful
628.00s: about these levels, which again, this is not, this is just a dumb system. So there's a viable
633.92s: approach here if we can manage these drawdowns. So now the name of the game is seeing how do we
640.16s: participate in these 3,270% gains over these time frames without giving up too much upside profit
647.36s: potential by getting out using different moving averages without going through these 82% style
652.80s: drawdowns. So one of the first things you'll notice is that the 50-day moving average works
657.60s: really, really well. So if we use a three year daily chart, you can see that if you use a 50-day
663.44s: moving average, it would get you out much, much, much sooner in the lifespan of the trade so that
670.08s: you don't have to go through this really drawn out nasty drawdown. So for example here, using
676.24s: three year daily chart, you can see that let's say you got in here, it would keep you in, you might
680.72s: get out somewhere in here, get back here, get out again here at a small profit, you take it all
685.04s: the way to the downside, come back up, get back in here, get kicked out again here for a small loss,
689.92s: then you're not back in. So you can see that there's still quite a few interactions with the 50-day
694.08s: moving average. So there's a couple choices we can use. We can either use a 200-day moving average,
698.72s: which is going to be much slower. You're going to have a bigger drawdown before it kicks you out,
702.24s: but in this case, let's say you top-ticked it again at 91, this might kick you out instead at 68.
707.04s: So it's not a great move, but it's not going from 91 down to 16, and if you use a 200-day moving
712.72s: average, you get in here, bad timing, top-ticked it, gets you out here at 68, and then you don't get
717.84s: back in until down here. You get chopped up a little bit, then you get chopped up again a little bit
722.08s: here, but then you're essentially off to the races into here. The downside is that this move
727.28s: would have caught you in full from 85 down to 59. So what we can tinker with is using a combination
734.08s: of these different moving average strategies so that we can maintain some sensitivity and strike
739.12s: a balance. But this is the introduction to using coverage strangle in a leveraged ETF. If you're
744.56s: interested in following along, check out those Monday night YouTube live streams, and then the
748.80s: other thing is, if you're interested in another follow-on video that talks about the specific
753.04s: relationships with these moving averages that I'm going to use, let me know, and I can share with
756.88s: you what I'm going to do and why I'm going to do it. As always, if you have any questions, let me know,
760.40s: be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
