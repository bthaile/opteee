0.36s: the reasons to trade options there's a
3.12s: lot of them there's also a lot of
4.32s: drawbacks that people don't really pay
6.32s: enough attention to so the goal of this
8.84s: video is to walk you through why I trade
11.68s: options and then to give you some
13.80s: starting points on how you can get your
16.60s: feet wet and get into the world of
19.08s: trading options because for the vast
22.32s: majority of people you'll notice it kind
24.72s: of goes a little bit like this where we
27.56s: start putting on trades and we don't
29.56s: know what to do do or we lose all of our
32.56s: money trading options that's a pretty
34.32s: common one as well or because now
37.32s: roaring kitty is back everybody is
39.12s: yoloing into GameStop calls and
43.20s: unfortunately for most people this isn't
45.44s: going to work out super well so the idea
48.44s: behind this video is to walk you through
50.52s: how I've used options and there's plenty
52.80s: of people that do way better than I do
55.08s: but this just kind of shows you that you
57.80s: can make good money trading options from
60.00s: from 2007 until 2023 my compound annual
64.04s: growth rate is actually now just up over
67.16s: 26% I had my best year to date last year
71.12s: so the punchline is you can make really
73.84s: good money doing this stuff if you can
77.20s: resist the Allure of really fast
80.20s: short-term money because I mean
82.04s: realistically when they're down 50%
84.96s: hoping that somebody else is going to
86.56s: make them money it doesn't work super
87.92s: great so let's talk about the reasons to
90.44s: trade options what's up to the outliers
93.24s: welcome back to another video and let's
96.28s: get straight in so the first thing to
99.04s: know is that when we trade options we
101.16s: are actually adding a lot of complexity
104.12s: what does that mean well you have to
105.88s: look at stuff like this that might not
107.52s: mean anything to you I actually think
108.92s: it's kind of cool and then you have to
110.88s: understand how to read this kind of
112.04s: stuff which again is pretty kind of cool
113.72s: once you know how to use it but
115.92s: realistically when you do something like
118.76s: you buy share of Tesla for example
122.72s: really what you're looking at is
124.60s: something that looks like this this is
126.84s: your p&l it's a p&l graph the Y AIS
131.12s: shows how much money you're making and
133.04s: or not making this is the zero line and
136.08s: then the x axis is different prices in
139.72s: Tesla so right now we're using this is
141.52s: where the current price is the center
142.88s: one and then this is minus and plus one
145.24s: standard deviation then two standard
146.72s: deviations in them so what I'm trying to
149.28s: highlight for you here is something
151.76s: that's very specific and it's the fact
154.16s: that when you're are buying shares
156.72s: really two things can happen it can go
158.44s: up or it can go down there's no
159.92s: expiration it's pretty straightforward
162.04s: as soon as you start adding options now
164.76s: not only do you have to be correct in
167.60s: terms of your direction you care about
170.28s: something called volatility and that's
172.80s: really just the perception of how
174.88s: something is going to move in the future
177.36s: you also care about things like interest
178.76s: rates because that can impact the p&l of
181.92s: your position and then there's also now
184.40s: a time frame component because if you'll
186.28s: notice from this back here all options
188.80s: have an expiration date which is to say
191.84s: after the 17th of May the options in
194.24s: here they're gone they all expire and
197.20s: that's it they're gone so you have to go
200.28s: into options with your eyes wide open
202.52s: understanding that we're adding
204.64s: complexity so why why would we add this
208.88s: complexity well it's for a few really
212.36s: solid reasons and they give you options
216.00s: the ability to create these very
219.16s: specific risk reward payoff structures
222.16s: and they allow you to do a lot of things
225.20s: that equities outright do not here are
228.12s: six of them the very first one is they
230.84s: offer you Leverage What does that mean
233.76s: in this context let's take a look
235.96s: together this is using Tesla at 175 just
239.36s: for an example and let's look at two
241.32s: different scenarios let's say that you
242.68s: want to buy 100 shares of Tesla and
246.16s: let's compare that to buying five 170
250.76s: calls in Tesla you don't have to worry
252.72s: about what that means just yet just know
254.04s: that means you want it to go up okay
255.88s: well let's take a look at the relative
257.64s: costs for these two different positions
259.20s: in this case you are putting up
261.40s: $17,500 and you are controlling 100
264.16s: shares of Tesla in this case you're
266.32s: putting up $872
269.92s: but you're controlling 500 shares of
273.68s: Tesla up to 500 in the beginning it
276.00s: would be a little bit less than that
277.60s: because we're at a 62 Delta so in this
279.52s: case it would just be 62 * 500 that
282.68s: would equal your current number of
285.00s: shares notionally but you get to control
287.88s: up to 500 shares right from the jum this
291.04s: right here is leverage at play the other
294.20s: thing is the risk payoff for these two
297.04s: different things actually looks quite
299.16s: different so if we go back to this and
302.04s: take a look together this is what just
304.52s: your long shares look like right as we
306.76s: already kind of pointed out now let's
308.72s: take a look at what long calls in this
311.64s: example look like notice how different
313.88s: that is we still have unlimited profit
316.52s: potential to the upside but now you have
318.64s: limited downside the most you can lose
321.36s: in this trade is how much money you put
323.20s: into it which in this case is
325.20s: $872 that's the most you can lose that's
328.12s: very different than what you see when
330.52s: you buy shares of Tesla you have
333.28s: unlimited downside and unlimited upside
336.36s: why is that the case well because there
338.24s: has to be a trade-off here right we just
341.20s: acknowledge the fact that when you're
342.56s: trading options you're adding complexity
345.24s: to the position so in this case you now
347.84s: have a time frame that you have to be
349.52s: correct in which is 72 days to
351.64s: expiration so that means that over time
353.96s: this is going to Decay that's the price
356.16s: of the leverage you were afforded now
358.04s: let's look at it an example quick
359.64s: quickly let's say Tesla goes to 190 in
362.48s: this example where you buy 100 shares
364.60s: you'd make 1,500 bucks which is 8.6%
367.40s: return on invested capital in the
369.24s: scenario that we bought options you make
372.12s: $5,000 which is a
374.28s: 57% return on invested Capital much more
377.56s: Capital efficient if you're correct so
380.28s: it's a way to leverage the things you're
383.24s: doing and if you're good at picking
384.96s: Direction you can make a lot of money
388.68s: trading op no doubt about it let's go
391.16s: into a couple of these others direction
393.52s: optionality is pretty straightforward
395.12s: and all that means is when you buy stock
398.16s: you need it to go up now you can short
400.88s: stock so that you're trading something
402.88s: to the downside and it kind of takes an
405.00s: inverse graph here but when you do this
408.00s: you're actually borrowing shares and you
410.12s: have to pay interest on those shares
412.72s: that you're borrowing so it's a slightly
414.36s: different look but the cool part with
416.96s: options is you get to create all these
419.16s: different kind of risk payoff diagrams
422.80s: where maybe we have some long premium
426.16s: and short premium side to our trade so
428.28s: we have downside potential meaning if we
430.44s: want to trade this to the downside
431.72s: similar to short shares you want to
433.60s: trade it to the downside so we're buying
435.28s: puts but then we're actually selling
437.96s: some calls to amplify the strategy or if
441.12s: you want to reduce your risk a little
442.64s: bit you can actually sell puts against
445.52s: your long puts and notice how it keeps a
448.48s: similar payoff diag but we're actually
450.56s: collecting a little bit of a premium up
452.28s: front and it helps our break even if
454.40s: we're slightly wrong so you can create
457.24s: any sort of combination of strategies to
460.68s: capture whatever directional disposition
463.00s: you have including things that are
464.40s: moving sideways if you're trading
466.52s: equities you need something to go up or
468.68s: down it has to move somewhere other than
470.92s: receiving a dividend which is helpful
473.00s: but you need price movement in order for
474.80s: capital gains potential with options
476.68s: that's not so much the case the other
478.16s: thing is you get to hedge risk which is
480.00s: actually part of what you were just
481.28s: seeing right we're able to reduce our
483.56s: downside a little bit if we're so
485.48s: inclined the other way you can reduce
487.52s: your risk is let's say instead that you
489.80s: want to buy the same shares but now you
494.00s: buy a put that put decreases your
497.60s: downside risk so that you have a capped
500.48s: downside at this point again options
503.32s: give you a lot of choices they can
506.24s: reduce risk they can let you create very
508.56s: specific structures that make sense for
510.24s: you let's get into two more of these
512.56s: specifically the trading volatility and
514.40s: structural Alpha something like trading
517.28s: volatility can be really useful
519.96s: specifically if markets aren't moving
521.96s: much so a great example of this is back
525.36s: in
526.64s: 2015 the S&P 500 in that year returned
530.08s: 1.31% it didn't do much however if
533.08s: you're trading things like volatility
534.80s: around earnings releases or if you're
536.52s: trading zero DTE options like I do you
539.08s: can make make money even when the
541.88s: Market's not doing a whole lot the other
543.68s: thing is volatility is its own asset
545.88s: class it behaves its own specific way
548.04s: and it's actually way more predictable
550.40s: than stock price in short-term time
552.24s: frames and the other thing is structural
554.32s: Alpha this is a way that you can capture
557.44s: on little quirks in the market that
560.44s: overtime bear edge meaning they make you
563.20s: money longterm runways so options Grant
567.56s: you access to all of this so if I were
570.88s: to start trading options this is the
573.52s: list of strategies I would start with I
575.92s: would use these two different buckets
578.36s: bullish meaning we want things to expand
580.20s: or go up bearish go down and then you
582.40s: can split them for bullish directional
585.36s: or bullish volatility because these are
587.64s: two different asset classes essentially
590.36s: that let you capture different kinds of
592.24s: price movements this is where i' start
593.84s: and I have videos for essentially all of
596.44s: these and I'll throw them in the notes
598.60s: below options in general have the
601.68s: ability to quite literally change your
605.04s: entire life it allows you to much more
607.48s: carefully manage your risk you can be
610.04s: super aggressive looking for a lot of
611.72s: Leverage expecting a lot of volatility
613.76s: or you can say I don't want to be quite
615.12s: as aggressive I want to decrease my
616.88s: volatility but still make money you can
618.72s: do all of that with options be an
620.24s: outlier see youall later
