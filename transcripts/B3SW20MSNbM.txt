0.00s: I think last time we spoke, you were like 20,000,
2.24s: it's almost 28 good stuff man.
4.48s: Who knew?
5.92s: All right, it looks like it's going through now.
7.76s: I'm just gonna have to drop a new link for it really quick.
10.24s: But that's easy.
12.80s: Perfect.
13.88s: All right, so here's the new link.
16.72s: I'm gonna drop it in here, new link.
20.72s: And then I'll put it on X as well.
27.20s: And then we should be good.
29.36s: Yeah, those weird.
30.20s: A lot of times you can pretty seamlessly run it through
35.12s: another like relay service.
36.36s: But for some reason it didn't like it.
39.32s: So,
41.44s: blockcat.
47.00s: Cool.
48.32s: That'll be all right.
50.16s: Cool, everybody can make their way in as they figure out
53.32s: their lives as I'm trying to figure out my life.
57.16s: Looks like everybody's following over to the other one,
59.56s: which is good.
60.56s: They should all have access to the new link.
61.96s: So we'll pivot over to this one.
63.48s: Beautiful dude.
65.32s: When you use your ears is live.
68.24s: That is correct, sir.
70.80s: Yeah, so we're good.
74.08s: What's pop in everybody?
76.64s: Yeah, welcome over folks.
78.12s: Sorry for the last minute change.
79.56s: You know how that goes sometimes.
81.28s: Literally had it all set up.
82.56s: I have like a, I don't know, I'd call it like a 15
86.04s: percent hit rate with trying to go live through zoom.
88.80s: It's not the worst, but it's also not the most seamless.
91.32s: So we figured it out though.
93.20s: What's up, man?
95.08s: Nothing much, man.
95.96s: Just enjoying the year end.
97.84s: What's been a good market year?
99.48s: Strong markets and it's about it.
101.92s: Just looking forward to chatting with you.
103.12s: It's always a pleasure.
104.36s: Did you, did you trade APP?
107.76s: You know what?
108.44s: It's like I look back and like how did I miss APP?
112.28s: It's like the most perfect like set up like a couple of months
115.40s: back.
116.28s: Dude, vertical, unbelievable.
118.36s: I did you so dirty because I got in on the 11th of September
123.08s: and I used options on it.
124.68s: I got in.
125.88s: I literally think it might be one of my biggest trades.
129.44s: Definitely for the year, but it like might be a multi-year
132.00s: period for me because when I got in it was sub 100.
135.64s: It was like 98.
137.20s: And then I got, yeah, I got out when it was like four.
141.24s: I forgot what it got up to.
143.40s: But as you know, that's not my style of trading at all.
147.72s: So like I didn't deserve that in the least.
150.00s: It just kind of like randomly.
151.32s: You came and you came to out do me
152.64s: and my my style of trading is that it?
154.48s: Is that what you're trying to kick this off with?
156.04s: What I'm trying to say, there's no chance I ever could.
158.68s: But, but I'm telling you, every once in a while,
163.36s: a blind squirrel does find a nut.
165.20s: And it was so funny because when I was putting on the trade,
170.24s: dude, I was like, I saw volume expand massive.
174.44s: Actually, I'll pull up a chart really quick
177.12s: because it's kind of interesting now that I look at it
180.92s: because it's, I honestly am actually really surprised
184.28s: that you didn't, that this wasn't your back.
187.20s: This seems like the exact kind of thing
189.28s: that you would find your way into.
191.48s: But yeah, I had originally gotten in here.
194.96s: And it was for two very simple reasons.
199.60s: The first one is it started to break out
202.48s: and it was on crazy volume.
204.12s: I didn't know why.
205.60s: And I did zero research.
207.36s: I didn't know anything about the earnings.
208.84s: I didn't even know what the company did when I bought it
210.84s: as people in my field tend to do.
215.72s: No, nothing about what we do.
217.12s: I, it's whenever I talk to my wife about what I do
220.20s: as a trader, I literally tell her,
222.12s: I just look at colors on a screen.
225.00s: And if I like the colors, I'll do something.
227.32s: If I don't like the colors, I don't do anything.
229.24s: And that's about my existence.
230.80s: But yeah, that was a funny entry.
234.00s: Now, at a curiosity though, with your general approach,
236.92s: maybe trading view, maybe I should pull that up
238.72s: because this is obviously all messed up from the scale.
241.72s: But where, like where in this would your typical entry window be?
248.64s: No, I mean, you nailed it perfectly.
250.24s: The reason I kind of slipped on this one
252.76s: is just because a good marker will have
255.04s: so many nice setups come in your way.
256.68s: So there's a lot of stuff I'll building into at that time.
259.44s: And so sometimes you already got like a foolish portfolio.
261.76s: And it's like, no, to be honest, like now looking back,
265.08s: it's like the home run trade.
266.20s: Sometimes, you know, a lot of people like,
268.64s: I'll tell them it's like, you don't always know,
271.88s: you're buying five, six, 10 stocks.
274.00s: You don't really know the one that's gonna pull off
275.72s: something like this.
276.56s: It's kind of like your, it's a right environment.
278.60s: You're looking at the right setups.
279.52s: And sometimes your place pretty full.
281.80s: And so it's just like, for that reason,
283.24s: you're not just like constantly forever extending yourself.
285.52s: So I mean, the way you did,
287.04s: the way you did it was like the classic set up.
290.12s: I mean, it's just, it was perfect.
291.24s: And especially, you know, that is the quintessential move
295.48s: is when, you know, like you can't buy a stock.
297.84s: Like, I mean, like it took off.
298.84s: If you're waiting in any way,
300.48s: if you even just flinch and said,
301.84s: I'm gonna wait for a pullback,
302.88s: I'll wait for the volatility to die down,
304.52s: I'll wait for it to go side, it's never stopped.
306.84s: So like, it's like the stocks that you can't buy
308.88s: are the stocks that you should buy.
310.16s: It's the perfect, perfect example.
311.88s: What a move.
312.88s: Beautiful.
313.72s: What a great way to phrase that by the way.
316.00s: Because I've not heard that before.
317.48s: And I don't know if that's something you say a lot,
319.20s: but if not, you should.
320.68s: Because the statement of the stocks that you can't buy
325.36s: or the stocks that you should buy,
326.60s: like that's a great way to frame it.
328.68s: And I imagine for a lot of traders,
331.12s: that does take a while to get used to,
332.56s: is like buying stuff high and then trying to sell it higher.
335.24s: That's very, very counterintuitive.
337.48s: But, and for myself, like sometimes,
340.36s: it's like, you know what to be true,
341.56s: but then after other times, it's like,
343.92s: because at the same time, you're always trying to balance,
345.76s: which is that leading stock,
347.00s: but also you want to avoid buying things that are extended,
349.60s: even good stocks could kind of come up,
351.68s: pull back at the end of June.
353.56s: So, especially when things are starting to kick off
356.04s: and it's like, you have to remind yourself,
357.60s: like, because there's the other setups that will look
359.96s: more timely, like, oh, this one hasn't gone yet.
362.24s: It's like, this, I think it's a natural built-in emotion
365.16s: we have from life, like looking for a dealer
367.12s: at this counter, what, you know,
368.28s: so it's like, you have to remind,
369.52s: no, no, like just buy the one you could buy.
371.64s: Just find the way, even if it's more expensive,
373.76s: buy that one.
374.60s: And nine times out of 10, that's the one
377.04s: that just keeps going.
377.88s: It's crazy.
378.72s: I mean, how many people have been saying Palantir
381.04s: is all a value and it's just like,
382.60s: it's tripled again, you know, like, so,
385.24s: you never have been ever waiting.
386.96s: So, really fun story about Palantir.
390.60s: I recently did a, it was a video actually,
395.04s: think about Palantir.
396.28s: It was about Palantir maybe so far, maybe both of them.
399.72s: And there was a bunch of people on seeking alpha
403.60s: that we're talking about how it's, you know,
405.72s: no good at this point.
406.76s: It's already overextended, like all that kind of stuff.
409.48s: And I obviously can't help but just find it comical
412.64s: that exactly to your point stuff that's like that tends
415.04s: to keep being like that.
417.04s: Like, well, it just keeps going, dude.
418.72s: So whatever, that's about all, all you really need, I think.
423.24s: Another question about that stock, as I was looking at it,
426.96s: out of sheer curiosity.
429.28s: I had, I was using the 10 and the 20
435.40s: that essentially follow the trend.
437.40s: Now, a lot of other times that I do that
440.24s: for a breakout style trades and kind of momentum
442.80s: following at that point, I find that you really can't take
447.40s: the rules super strictly, otherwise you get chopped out
451.16s: a lot.
452.00s: And I noticed that in this case as well.
456.00s: So when you're trying to follow, let's say that you,
458.56s: you find a good entry on something like this,
461.08s: what's your approach to follow the trend
463.32s: as it's unfolding without getting dumped out?
466.24s: So I try and, and this like really was from William O'Neill.
469.44s: You kind of brought up the concept,
470.68s: but it just, it's slowly just taken over my process.
474.32s: But he had like this thing called the hold rule.
475.96s: So if the stock goes up like so much,
478.56s: like 20% within the first three weeks,
480.28s: it's something you want to hold onto,
481.48s: or you know, that's kind of like the basics of it.
484.08s: But for me, the way it's grown over time is,
487.08s: if the stock is just very strong,
488.52s: it's one of my best stocks,
490.60s: I just don't want to sell it for the first two or three weeks.
493.40s: Because there's always going to be a pause,
494.68s: there's going to be a pullback,
495.56s: like I'll always rather manage risk
497.52s: with the stocks that are not going up.
499.84s: Because yeah, because that's a typical thing, right?
501.68s: It'll pull back to a 10, you say it closes below it,
504.16s: you exit and then just kind of keeps rocking higher
506.40s: at three days later.
507.24s: So I found that coming out of a base,
509.36s: coming out of a structure,
510.92s: the first two, three, four weeks is really
512.72s: when the stock is showing what it's got.
515.00s: Like if it's something that's worthwhile holding,
516.84s: it's worth watching.
517.56s: So I have a bit of like a time clock going on.
520.32s: Like I just, as long as I'm not losing money on a stock,
523.00s: like the first couple of weeks,
524.60s: unless it's like, like now there's a really great market.
526.72s: Like if a stock is not doing anything now,
528.68s: maybe just roll it into something else,
530.16s: because there's so much heat.
531.72s: But like back in September at markets,
533.20s: we're just like coming out of a bit of a slumber
535.32s: and like all the stocks are starting to move.
538.20s: So whenever you're at the beginning of like that cycle,
540.32s: I find new markets go like these three, four, five,
542.44s: one cycles.
543.80s: Like that first two, three, four weeks,
545.16s: I just want to like leave it alone.
546.40s: I just don't want to touch it.
547.40s: So that's usually my pride.
548.68s: And I find it super helpful.
549.92s: Because by that time, like APP,
552.76s: like those first three, four, five days,
554.76s: the impulse would have been so strong to like,
557.04s: you know, we went from 87 to 125,
560.04s: the impulse is so strong to take your profit.
563.00s: And so you just need kind of like this mindset,
564.60s: what I know, that's just don't touch it now.
566.56s: Like whatever it is, I'm expecting higher.
568.12s: And say what policy or same one, G-E-V,
570.12s: so many others this year that I did trade,
572.64s: ALAB recently.
574.64s: It's the amazing thing about these kind of markets.
576.72s: So like the time, time's an important consideration.
580.24s: And your average holding duration maybe for this year
583.32s: on some of those names,
584.32s: what's your holding duration?
586.64s: So for me, so it's almost like I have like a split personality.
589.96s: Like I think if you get the average,
591.24s: it's not like a proper representation.
593.20s: So there's probably stocks where like the average holding period
595.84s: is like four days, you know,
597.60s: some are a couple of days they can stop,
599.64s: some are like a week and a half they can stop.
601.68s: So like those are the stocks that are like the under performers.
604.40s: And after the ones that do work,
605.68s: like that's a different crowd.
606.76s: That's usually like two to four months.
608.68s: So that's a new average of three.
610.12s: So there's kind of like,
611.12s: if you look at the trades that split on the two sides.
614.48s: And I was gonna ask, so like is a percentage of trades,
616.76s: is it like 50, 50-ish or is it like the only four months
620.68s: or usually the rock star moves?
621.88s: But it's probably like,
624.08s: probably like close to like a 35, 65 or something like that,
627.48s: for you know, a 37.
628.92s: Depends how good the market,
630.16s: like in hot markets, it could be near 50, 50,
632.72s: or even better in bad markets.
634.64s: It's like, could be 2080 for a little bit, you know,
637.00s: so it depends with the market.
640.44s: And when you're prospecting to enter your trades,
643.08s: I know that you obviously follow an adapted version
645.88s: of Can Slim that you've built and refined over time.
650.00s: One of the things I find so fascinating about Can Slim
653.08s: is that it is a lot of fundamentals that they look at.
658.64s: Obviously overlay with technical for timing.
661.12s: But then if you're talking about like a quarter long
663.52s: holding duration, that seems like a shorter window
667.08s: for like fundamentals to fully be reflected.
669.52s: So can you talk about that relationship a little bit?
672.64s: Well, I see, so like what I find, like if you could,
675.80s: like the alternate moves for most of these big winners,
679.32s: and seem like Will and Will and Neil speaking at Can Slim
681.48s: or anyone who does this style,
683.24s: like the majority of the full most of these stocks,
685.96s: or let's say 18 months,
687.20s: that's an average full cycle for a stock to do,
690.08s: it's entire move.
691.76s: The thing is though, normally you'll have like a three
694.16s: to five month really hot run,
696.16s: then you'll have like a correction.
697.68s: And the corrections can be 15%, they can be 35%.
701.00s: So depending on how, like because I'm a more aggressive trader,
704.32s: I'm very concentrated, I tend to be on margin,
707.04s: like you don't want to sit through a 35% correction
709.36s: like on heavy margins, it's very, very painful.
712.12s: So if I do sit with some stocks,
714.04s: it'll be like the few most I'm looking to kind of capitalize
717.92s: on those individual legs,
718.92s: it's almost like the different quarters of a football game
721.92s: or something like that, you think a bit.
722.96s: So it's like I try after each quarter,
724.68s: to reassess like who do I want to stay in
728.32s: or just move the cash and look to kind of rebuild and do it again.
731.08s: So that's what works for me with my personality.
734.16s: Like always tell people,
735.16s: it could be the best strategy in the world.
736.72s: It doesn't mix with your personality, it won't work.
738.96s: So that's how I found it to be helpful.
742.40s: I literally say the same thing all the time,
744.20s: literally the same thing,
745.32s: because that exact note is like the definition of square peg
750.44s: round hole and there was actually a post
753.20s: that came across on Reddit not too long ago.
754.96s: I like to post on there once in a while.
757.68s: And there was somebody that was in like the day trading
760.16s: subreddit and they were like the silliest thing dude.
765.00s: They were like, I'm so good at swing trading,
768.28s: but I wanna be a day trader so bad.
770.32s: Why, I don't know why, why do you want to torture yourself?
773.88s: Yeah, the first thing I thought it was just like,
778.20s: how stupid is this?
780.00s: That like you're just worried about a label,
782.72s: swing trade every day, now you're a day trader.
784.68s: Like who gives a fuck?
786.64s: What the label is bro, just do what works,
789.12s: exactly to your broader point of find what gels with you.
796.04s: Now you mentioned something there that drew my interest
799.16s: about the use of margin and it begs the natural question,
802.84s: why use margin when you can use option?
805.56s: And okay.
807.04s: So I think you're slowly seeking into my brand.
810.44s: I'm trying to fucking wear you down bro.
812.48s: You are, you're gonna be down.
814.84s: But I've been really working on, again,
819.00s: I like to get concentrated, I like to be aggressive.
821.52s: It's just my natural thing.
822.44s: If I think markets are hot, if I'm like,
824.64s: if I have 20% cash, I'm kicking,
826.12s: if I'm only 120% invested, I'm upset on myself.
828.60s: Like I wanna be aggressive.
829.76s: When you start getting to that 150, 200% invested
833.20s: the volatility's wild.
834.56s: So the thing is with options that they're less liquid,
837.96s: the expire, your paying, the implied volatility
841.96s: all the time is a draw.
843.20s: So like what I like to do, what I've begun doing,
845.72s: is not get really, really heavy.
846.96s: But when I have indicators that will show me
849.28s: that we're stretching the short term,
851.48s: I'll start to kind of buy some,
853.16s: let's say two, three week put options,
855.52s: a little bit out of the money so the cost is not too much.
857.40s: Because again, kind of like I was saying before,
859.16s: sometimes the corrections are 10%.
861.32s: And they're like, okay, that's cool.
862.40s: No, it's not a big deal.
863.52s: So that's a 30% or there could be a downgrade.
865.92s: All these girl stocks, like analysts love to downgrade them
868.52s: and it's like they get these big massive hits out of nowhere.
871.16s: So I've found, so I've started to incorporate them more
873.80s: and more to kind of just to smooth out the equity curve.
876.04s: But like, so the way I kind of use it,
878.04s: so basically once you're running up,
880.08s: it's probably different than how you would do it.
881.76s: But like the way I look at it is that what I wanna be totally
883.80s: long, I want the full delta going up.
885.84s: But then after once I get like at an extended point,
888.20s: then I just wanna be like a call option.
889.68s: Like I wanna take more ups.
890.68s: So basically you know, stock with the put,
892.08s: you're like synthetic call basically.
894.16s: So I just wanna like, I want it,
895.80s: so I still wanna be long,
896.72s: but not a lot all the downside anymore.
898.44s: So I start to flip that in.
899.52s: And what's cool is like, let's say it does connect
901.80s: and you like the stock and it pulls back normally.
905.12s: Well, you're protected from that put that you bought cheaply,
907.76s: but also now you can start like actually buy
909.84s: a more stock on that pullback comfortably
911.88s: because there's like your big positions are already hedged out.
914.16s: So it's actually allowed me to like,
915.92s: I've been doing it on Tesla, I just lay it up
918.28s: and it's allowed me to build a monster position.
920.28s: And I never really took on like any additional risk
922.20s: than I would normally, but like that put hedging stride
924.84s: along the way worked out great.
927.12s: Yeah, that's awesome.
928.04s: I love that for you.
929.20s: Yeah, it's in your point about liquidity
932.00s: and what offers that's genuinely one of the answers
935.28s: I was expecting to hear from you
936.48s: even though you didn't explicitly say,
937.88s: you still kind of implicitly said it,
939.64s: where a lot of the stuff that I imagine you might trade
943.24s: may or may not even have option.
945.16s: Because.
946.16s: Yeah, they could be maybe they should have quarterly.
948.20s: I mean, some are super like like now I'm like,
949.68s: I've said I'm trading Tesla.
950.80s: But that's of course,
951.84s: it's all great.
952.68s: Yeah, no, not a problem at all,
953.76s: but if it's a young IPO,
955.92s: I mean, what's the, what's the vault,
957.84s: the volatility, the pricing in and how liquid is it
960.76s: and how far out?
961.60s: So a lot of time it's just,
963.12s: and then it's like a thumb to break out.
964.36s: The break out fails, then you're trying to roll out
966.28s: of these liquid options and it becomes a bit tricky.
968.56s: So I like to build the position up.
970.36s: Now it's going my way.
971.36s: I can take my time to hedge like where I want
973.56s: and kind of smooth out the equity curve.
975.56s: So it's a different, different approach.
978.00s: Yeah, very, very.
979.92s: And it's that's one of the reasons why I love doing these, right?
982.52s: Is it's a chance not just for you and I to,
984.60s: to bullshit and share some different ideas,
986.32s: but it's also for people to hear different,
988.12s: different ideas because yeah,
989.68s: it's I find that's a big filter that I apply.
994.04s: It's I don't only trade options.
995.84s: I absolutely will use the underlying itself.
998.64s: If it's something that looks really, really good
1001.00s: and I feel like that's the only way
1002.88s: reasonably to gain entry, but yeah,
1005.56s: the even stuff that has decent liquidity,
1009.28s: you I find that if there's a really big balance
1011.84s: between how far out in time you go to decrease your daily theta,
1015.84s: even though there's a higher gross theta,
1018.20s: you kind of have to strike a balance
1020.16s: because if you go out too far,
1021.68s: then you are giving up more and more liquidity,
1024.00s: which is a problem.
1025.24s: So I can totally see that.
1028.04s: One of the other things I noticed though
1030.24s: with this, the like the breakout style of trading,
1033.24s: this I've used it way more this year
1036.24s: than the past few years because it just,
1039.52s: I keep a pretty detailed log and I can see like what's,
1042.56s: I'm always prospecting, but I can start to see
1045.20s: like what's catching and it's like,
1046.28s: okay, this is actually starting to,
1048.44s: to really move the needle a bit.
1050.60s: One of the things I noticed though is
1053.60s: I wanted to pick your brain on the timing of entry.
1058.04s: Obviously, that's the name of the game, right?
1060.12s: Like that's the difficult part.
1061.64s: And I find, I have no problem entering on a breakout
1068.40s: if it fails, take the exit,
1070.56s: whatever the defined exit is,
1071.72s: typically shortly below,
1073.24s: wherever the lows were right before the breakout,
1075.44s: the consolidation phase.
1077.00s: And if it starts breaking out again,
1078.24s: then I'll just get right back in.
1079.60s: Like I really don't have any problem with that at all.
1081.92s: Is that something you do?
1084.48s: So I used to do more of that.
1085.64s: Like the example of APP you showed,
1087.64s: like that is the textbook example
1089.68s: of what William Wanniel was showing his books.
1091.72s: Like that's the reason why you would use a breakout strategy
1096.04s: because it's not doing much of anything
1098.04s: then boom breaks out and it's gone.
1100.08s: I found that, I think it's because of HFTs and algos
1104.40s: which have become more and more powerful,
1106.12s: that's more and more rare to see.
1108.92s: You don't see it that way so often.
1110.76s: Like typically the big move happens
1113.88s: like before the breakout, then you come back in.
1115.96s: So I rarely, unless it's something like an APP,
1118.92s: like I have a much stronger filter.
1120.56s: Like that day the volume was huge.
1122.40s: Like that was like,
1123.24s: you need to have something that will make that day seem better
1126.04s: because a roster so many fake breakouts
1129.32s: that even like, oh, I get out, I get back in,
1131.12s: like that can get real costly
1132.64s: because those reversals are fast.
1134.12s: And you can tell, like if you're buying that breakout
1136.76s: and it's up 6%, and all of a sudden it's up 4, 3, 2,
1140.32s: you're like, ah, the machines, that was totally a machine.
1142.64s: And like you just know it,
1143.56s: now I'm getting out, everyone's getting out at the same time,
1146.20s: the spreads widen, I guess.
1148.20s: And it's like, then you feel like adults.
1149.88s: And also, like I typically like to start building
1153.60s: into a position.
1154.44s: So if I like the way the chart looks,
1155.76s: like I'm building it's usually prior to the breakout
1157.64s: a little bit, and then if it does have a big power for move,
1160.44s: I'll, maybe I'll add a little,
1161.44s: but I wanna see a close up there.
1163.40s: And then typically the next couple of days,
1165.04s: I'm looking for kind of backfill
1166.60s: or consolidation pause.
1168.12s: So like APP is an example, like again,
1170.48s: I already had a pretty full play at that point.
1172.84s: But even if not, if I wouldn't miss that initial breakout,
1175.00s: like it's harder to chase,
1176.60s: it's up two, three days in a row,
1177.72s: most don't have that straightaway type of move.
1180.12s: There's a lot of backfill.
1181.32s: So I prefer the backfill, I prefer like the pre-breakout.
1184.68s: I actually, almost prefer everything but the breakout now,
1187.56s: these, because I find it's,
1189.76s: I mean, again, there's a logical argument for it,
1191.84s: because that's like, you know,
1192.84s: hey, the stock's finally going,
1195.20s: but the machines have become very powerful.
1197.32s: And they've read the books too.
1198.76s: They can see that the retail flow,
1200.40s: and I just read the old even pro flow coming on breakouts.
1203.12s: And it's like, there's such an incentive
1205.64s: to like push and fade.
1207.72s: You know, if they can push enough liquidity to fade it,
1209.88s: just that eight percent,
1211.36s: they know all the stops will trigger
1212.52s: and then they cover those shorts,
1213.52s: and then they can get long and take it up a second time.
1215.52s: You know, so over a course of like a few hours
1218.40s: or a couple of days, like that's quite a profit.
1220.20s: You could do on size if you have the capability
1222.32s: to pull it off.
1223.16s: So that's why I don't do the breakouts
1226.24s: as much as people would think I do.
1228.36s: Yeah, so it sounds like you're almost trying
1229.92s: to front-run them a little bit.
1232.08s: And then, yeah, front-runner,
1233.72s: going for the confirmation,
1234.72s: I'd rather pay a little bit higher
1236.12s: and then build an actor,
1238.32s: then like try and go with the stop order.
1240.44s: Like you miss something like an APP sometimes.
1242.76s: It's a real hard one to miss,
1243.84s: but a lot of times it's like, it gets very,
1246.48s: and it's a good market.
1247.52s: Like then a shopping market,
1248.52s: it's like 10X the chop, you know,
1250.24s: like everything's failing.
1251.44s: So it's, it can get tricky.
1254.36s: Yeah, that leads to the, to the following one actually.
1256.68s: Is that I've even noticed in the last couple of weeks
1259.72s: that stuff seems to have slowed down, not a ton.
1263.48s: But I'm not seeing as many things
1265.32s: that are popping up that are looking quite as promising.
1269.88s: Have you seen that, or you're just looking at different stuff?
1273.20s: Well, I think it's because most stocks have been correcting.
1275.60s: Like if you look at the,
1276.92s: and not just like the small cast,
1278.40s: but if you look at the yes and P500,
1280.24s: yes, PY versus the RSP, RSP is like equal weights
1283.64s: at S&P 500.
1284.68s: Like it's still like large cap index,
1286.72s: but it's been literally falling
1288.68s: for I think 10 or 11 straight sessions,
1290.56s: whereas, you know, the QQ looks great.
1292.52s: So it's been, like the past couple of weeks
1295.04s: have actually been, okay, if you were in just the right names,
1298.20s: there was like a few like real,
1299.24s: there's been a couple of main themes
1301.20s: that have been powerhouses,
1303.20s: everything else has been kind of consolidating.
1304.68s: I think it's rotationary.
1305.96s: Like I think this market's really strong.
1307.76s: I think there's like massive field winds.
1310.04s: Like I think the AI revolution is in a like,
1313.00s: you know, people are talking Tesla,
1314.40s: like Tesla is an AI revolution
1315.84s: because I mean, autonomous driving is an AI answer.
1318.24s: That's not being accelerated.
1320.44s: And it's really a US centric development.
1323.88s: Like there's no other country that has any kind of,
1326.88s: I was just at the Alex card, the Palantir CEO,
1328.88s: it's like he was even saying
1329.80s: that there's no country that has the technology,
1332.96s: the energy capacity, the intellectual,
1335.00s: like you know how, how to put this together.
1337.56s: And it's a revolutionary approach to how we do everything.
1341.32s: So like I think this is such a strong market.
1344.40s: I think we're getting rotations like Broadcom,
1346.52s: like the semiconductor that's been dead,
1347.76s: not suddenly Broadcom had a big move on Friday.
1350.64s: And so like now those are gonna think of pause.
1352.32s: And then you know, I bet my,
1354.52s: the way I'm positioned,
1355.52s: like there's Santa Claus rally and small myth caps
1357.32s: are gonna rip all of a sudden.
1358.40s: People will be like, oh,
1359.24s: the ones that were quiet are suddenly going, you know?
1361.52s: So I think it's rotationary.
1363.64s: Speaking of that, what's been going on with small caps?
1367.08s: They're like, I don't get it.
1369.48s: Like everybody else is partying right now.
1371.84s: Small caps, they're even,
1372.92s: it looks like they're gonna get their cut this month.
1375.72s: And they're just like, what are they doing?
1378.68s: What's the problem?
1379.72s: I think it's just like, I mean,
1381.64s: in the market world,
1382.80s: we forget about like the real economy a lot of times.
1384.84s: But like, you know, like there's the haves,
1387.76s: like all the great companies, the Google's, Metas,
1390.92s: you know, Tesla, where their cost of capital super cheap,
1393.56s: like the demand for their product,
1394.76s: people are addicted to social media,
1396.12s: and no one's getting off-medagest because of,
1398.28s: like they're having a hard time at work,
1399.56s: like everyone's on all this stuff.
1400.96s: And so for them, it's like, ah, whatever,
1402.84s: but for small caps, like, you know,
1405.56s: like the, you know, the impact of inflation on margins,
1408.48s: and like, maybe a bit of a, like, slower economy
1411.08s: than people wanted, like, that has a real,
1412.80s: so they're not really screaming it.
1413.92s: I think there's gonna be a catch-up
1415.00s: when rates finally come down.
1416.24s: And also, I think they thought rates
1417.88s: were gonna fall quicker than they are,
1419.24s: and they're not, because the fed's being
1421.36s: a little more conservative here.
1423.20s: So it's like, always kind of like, they promise the gift,
1425.48s: and they kind of pull it back.
1426.52s: So like, at some point they'll get a massive tail
1429.46s: when there'll be some outperformance.
1430.72s: But, you know, at the same time, as an institution,
1434.04s: usually you go to a small cap for high growth.
1436.68s: And that's the way I usually think, you know, small,
1438.44s: even, I prefer mid caps.
1440.56s: But you're looking suddenly at something like a Tesla,
1443.12s: or a Google, or whatever,
1444.40s: or like, you're gonna revolutionize like,
1446.28s: autonomous, I think of all the,
1447.96s: the impact of autonomous.
1449.76s: So you get all the liquidity of a trillion-dollar company
1452.72s: with the same growth rates,
1454.36s: or higher than a small cap,
1456.40s: with the cost of capital of,
1459.56s: I established it, so it's like kind of,
1461.92s: the usual pull, the smalls are out there, you know?
1465.64s: Yeah, yeah, I was,
1466.84s: because I've been obviously playing a couple
1468.52s: of thematic moves in the Russell,
1470.92s: just because of expectations on when the rate
1474.20s: cut would find its way in.
1475.92s: And I think we saw some of that, what was it?
1478.60s: In like July, fell back,
1480.92s: then we saw some of it in October.
1484.52s: I think it was like mid late October,
1486.48s: there was another pop.
1487.84s: I think like really, really, I don't know,
1490.72s: it's definitely had some big moves,
1492.52s: but it's also been pulling back way more
1494.96s: than I would have expected.
1496.12s: It's been a while.
1496.96s: It's been a while.
1498.12s: Yeah, yeah, I'm rare, I'm kind of rare to see.
1500.60s: Yeah, because I feel like they could,
1501.88s: like, totally understand the consolidations,
1503.80s: especially on something like this,
1505.00s: but it's almost like a radic.
1507.16s: And I can't quite put my finger on the pricing methodology
1511.36s: that's going on there.
1512.52s: Like I can't, because to me,
1514.88s: to cause those moves, you need big institutional participation
1517.72s: of some sort, but it's hard for me to think
1520.16s: that there's institutions that are getting in
1522.32s: in like the beginning of July.
1524.72s: And then two weeks later, they're like,
1526.44s: ah, never mind, this is all bad.
1528.08s: Let me get completely out.
1529.32s: And then it reverts back to where it was before.
1531.28s: It just, it confounds me.
1532.96s: The only thing that made sense to me is,
1535.40s: I think there's been a big trade on where,
1537.56s: it's like your large, your long large caps,
1539.48s: short small caps, like a market neutral approach.
1542.52s: At every time, there's like the hope
1544.00s: of more aggressive rate cuts,
1545.08s: which is, you know, more bullish in short term,
1547.56s: I do not theory small caps.
1549.52s: It's like that, that trade goes in reverse.
1552.24s: It goes one point this summer,
1554.32s: where it's like literally the QQQ
1556.92s: and the Russell were trading completely
1558.52s: inversely to each other.
1559.72s: Like it was this, like if the Russell was up 2%,
1562.20s: the Qs were down 1% and vice versa.
1564.08s: And so, so I think that that trade got pushed
1567.32s: to the every few years,
1568.24s: there's like a trade that takes over.
1569.52s: It was the carry trade at one point.
1570.80s: There's always like a trade that takes over
1572.48s: that all the institutions, like everyone thinks
1573.92s: the hedge fund guys are like, these geniuses,
1576.20s: but a lot of them all have some drinks at night.
1578.08s: Like you're doing that kind of a trade yet.
1579.84s: And suddenly everyone has the same trade on
1581.76s: because it's making money.
1583.04s: So I think everyone gets on one side of the trade.
1584.96s: And so you're seeing basically all those pops
1587.92s: are the fear moments where,
1589.48s: why gotta get out of this trade?
1590.64s: And the small caps are less liquid.
1592.28s: So it's like they're all trying to do it at the same time
1594.68s: and then it's put back on.
1596.28s: So I think you're just seeing yet
1597.40s: what it curve like the guys who are putting on
1599.88s: this long short triple Qs or Russell or whatever.
1603.56s: And that's only to me that explains it
1604.96s: because overall the advance, if you just look at,
1607.72s: let's say a 50 day moving average, it's up to the roof.
1610.28s: But the moves are like you're up 12%.
1612.84s: Yeah, you're up with, which doesn't make any sense.
1615.48s: So it's definitely some kind of liquidity driven strategy,
1620.48s: you know, move that's coming off and on.
1623.48s: Yeah, and that's the part that I find so fascinating,
1626.20s: bike. So I was looking at it for a little while
1629.00s: and like the Russell was flat for a long, long part.
1634.60s: And then all of a sudden it was starting to catch up
1637.12s: to the S&P 500.
1638.16s: They weren't that far apart.
1639.20s: They're like five, six points apart.
1640.96s: And then they've obviously decoupled now
1642.92s: where it spies up almost what like 30%
1645.84s: and Russell's like sub 20 still.
1649.80s: Yeah, that's why I think I have a feeling
1652.52s: going to your end will probably get like a catch up move.
1654.60s: So we'll see what happens.
1655.88s: But it's been, it's been wild to see, I agree.
1658.92s: And if you're at the perfect example,
1660.68s: if you're a breakout trader, like that's a painful advance.
1663.40s: You know, you look back and it's still out of your pants
1666.16s: or you're saying what I just lost money the entire time.
1668.40s: I bought it or something.
1669.48s: I was just going to fill out it.
1670.56s: And it's like you want to like hit something
1672.92s: but that's why I was a bit of balance
1675.24s: on the entries and whatnot.
1676.24s: But it's been a, it's been a wild charge for sure.
1679.16s: Yeah. And well, you're coming on the breakout trading
1681.44s: might make a lot of sense because I couldn't imagine
1684.40s: that being like the thing you, the thing somebody does.
1687.68s: Because I feel like if that's the only thing somebody does,
1691.16s: you just have to be a glutton for punishment.
1693.84s: You just have to be okay getting kicked in the shin
1696.76s: over and over again until you get your couple of home runs.
1699.64s: Like a really, anytime I run the strategies,
1702.00s: it's like the win rate is typically okay.
1704.44s: It'll still hover around like 60%,
1706.40s: which is a decent win rate.
1709.44s: But there's still a lot of losing trade.
1712.32s: It's 40% of trades losing is not good.
1715.96s: Yeah. No, you know what?
1717.28s: It's because I think it goes back to like I said before,
1719.44s: markets were so much simpler.
1721.12s: Like people didn't have the knowledge they had.
1722.60s: So a lot of these, these strategies,
1724.52s: I mean, really more meals started trading in the 50s,
1727.56s: the 1950s, you know what I mean?
1728.84s: So it's like back then you said you ordered to the floor,
1732.00s: a guy went to the post, he bought the stock.
1733.92s: Like it was in algorithms like moving this
1736.12s: and that's what it was different.
1737.60s: If a stock had not gone anywhere for a while
1740.00s: and then suddenly it would go to new highs
1741.84s: on a big bit of volume probably was an insider buying
1744.64s: or someone would use something about the company.
1746.20s: Like it was very meaningful, like immediate information.
1749.84s: Now, and it's easy to teach.
1752.76s: It's a very teachable strategy.
1754.52s: You wait until it's in a base and then after
1756.68s: for breaks in new highs, that means people want it.
1759.20s: And logically it is correct.
1761.40s: But markets are pretty efficient,
1763.84s: I always say that, you know what I say?
1764.68s: It's not perfectly efficient, but it's pretty efficient.
1767.80s: Pretty awesome.
1769.04s: You know, like the machines that they're mad say,
1771.28s: hey, that you have these people who run in on this idea
1773.64s: and then run out and you know,
1775.28s: you've been through so long, every cycle
1777.00s: there's new people who come and learn
1778.76s: that they learn the basics first and it takes time
1781.00s: to realize it's not bad at easy, you know, so.
1783.72s: Yeah, yeah.
1784.72s: It's, yeah, this past year's been really interesting
1787.68s: just because it's led me to lean into some
1790.52s: of the other kinds of approaches that I got a little dusty
1794.12s: that I had necessarily been using a lot of the stuff
1796.92s: before that was really, really focused on volatility
1800.80s: and because it was everywhere.
1803.40s: Now, when you look back over 2024,
1808.04s: what are some of the primary themes that stuck out to you?
1810.96s: Not the obvious ones, not the high interest rate environment
1814.88s: and stuff like that.
1816.20s: What were some of the themes that you picked up this year
1818.36s: that were more novel that you're like,
1820.12s: oh, this is kind of a new thing I'm seeing.
1823.28s: In terms of actual stock themes are like investing process.
1826.56s: Whatever makes you happy.
1829.28s: Well, sometimes you know, it's interesting.
1831.36s: Like one thing I thought that was gonna be stronger
1833.32s: was cybersecurity.
1834.32s: Like you would think with the AI revolution
1836.40s: that there'd be an emphasis on like stopping fakes
1839.96s: and so that was like an early theme I was putting on
1844.40s: early in the year that didn't kind of like come to fruition.
1847.92s: Like it's a bit of like you look back at the gods,
1849.76s: like wasted time, like there was other things
1851.24s: that were working better.
1852.08s: So this year was tricky in a sense that
1857.36s: there was a lot of rotations in themes.
1859.08s: So you know, the semiconductors were red hot
1861.84s: and then like look at AMD now.
1863.36s: Like it's, it's awful.
1865.04s: I mean, like terrible, you know,
1866.36s: but at the same time like broad comments now blasting off.
1868.48s: So it's like a lot of stocks in the end did generally well,
1873.48s: but if you were in the wrong place in the wrong time,
1875.76s: you still could have been very painful for you.
1878.20s: So there's a lot of that rotational themes that would come in,
1880.80s: which is pretty normal.
1882.24s: Like most markets will have that.
1885.24s: What I think, again,
1886.64s: well, my kind of like base case that I've been trying to follow
1889.28s: was like the internet rule out the 90s where,
1892.12s: you know, it wasn't just, you know,
1894.16s: people making mainframe computers that dominated it.
1896.88s: It was, it was first, it was like, you know,
1898.56s: routers and switches and ethernet cables.
1900.72s: Then that went to internet portals.
1902.28s: Then I went to browsers and then I went to mobile phones.
1904.64s: So it's like everything built on itself.
1906.24s: So if you're just kind of sat back, you know,
1908.64s: like the NAS that kept going up,
1909.80s: if you sat back in that original theme,
1911.88s: saying like that's it, these are the guys
1913.44s: who are going to lay the foundation for everything.
1915.80s: Well, once they got fully priced,
1917.08s: like the market went on to like what was going to come next
1919.40s: and next and next and next.
1920.68s: So that's kind of what I was expecting.
1923.32s: It's not always easy to catch even if you're expecting it
1925.68s: because I mean, you don't really know,
1926.68s: like it's all new technology.
1928.04s: Like looking back, it's easy to study.
1929.76s: And real time is like sometimes I look at these companies
1931.92s: and I spend 20 minutes and I'm like, what they do?
1934.84s: Like what is this contraption that they have?
1936.96s: You know, like, you know, so,
1939.88s: but like that's the way you have to think.
1941.32s: So I think it's typical, but it's never easy.
1945.52s: But definitely like I think looking at it
1947.84s: from the lens of how the internet rolled out,
1950.00s: like through and how like there's reverberations
1952.36s: through different industries and how the industry itself
1954.92s: drew, I think that's the right way.
1956.24s: So I think it was to the point,
1958.64s: but yeah, that's kind of,
1960.68s: I think the themes that came out were just always trying
1963.92s: to understand what's going to come next.
1965.84s: You know, and how it's going to be the next player.
1969.04s: I think your point on semi-conductors is massive
1971.88s: because I think that that caught a lot of us off guard.
1974.96s: The fact that they've hailed off literally
1977.88s: as a sector quite as hard as a sector.
1980.76s: And that also seems, I can't fully tell what that's driven by.
1986.04s: It's not like demand for semi-conductors
1988.36s: is going to go away.
1989.20s: Even now that we're talking about just more computing
1992.76s: being required for everything beyond AI,
1995.52s: but now we have this new emergence of quantum computing
1998.36s: with Willow and Google that's been, you know,
2000.56s: worked on for 12 years.
2002.40s: Now that's starting to gain some traction.
2004.56s: So when you think about a sector like semi-conductors,
2009.68s: what are your thoughts on it?
2010.56s: You think that this is just profit taking for people
2012.56s: that are got in super low,
2014.40s: screws making ducking it,
2015.44s: swimming in gold coins,
2016.92s: or like it just seems like the demand
2019.52s: isn't actually contracting that.
2022.00s: It goes back to your other question,
2023.40s: like we were saying,
2024.40s: how long do you stay in these stocks?
2026.00s: Because the market exaggerates the way up,
2029.04s: and exaggerates the way down.
2030.68s: So like when you're on the way up,
2032.64s: like for example, not pounded,
2034.00s: I had a great traded pound here.
2035.24s: I got in like 20s, I exited like in the 70s,
2038.40s: which was a great trade.
2039.20s: But like even I have some clients,
2040.92s: they're like, why are you selling pound here?
2042.24s: Well like look, it is trading like at 65 times sales.
2045.12s: Like I always say, I wish I could start any company
2048.40s: and sell it at 65 times just my sales for the year.
2051.36s: Like I'll sell at a year one, it's gone, you know?
2053.44s: Like think about it, like 65 years should now be dead.
2056.12s: I can get all of those sales like done now, you know?
2058.52s: Like that value.
2060.32s: So the thing is it's like, I love pound.
2061.96s: I think pound here is in such a unique spot,
2065.32s: like in the AI ecosystem.
2067.64s: But like, you know, look, I mean,
2070.08s: the market will just get headed itself on the way up.
2072.16s: Then it has to, so at some point, you know,
2073.84s: like pound here is gonna correct or make a base
2076.28s: and it'll be, you know, it'll work again.
2077.60s: But also sometimes like with the semis,
2080.76s: when it's new technology, like stuff's moving so quickly,
2083.80s: sometimes it's like someone has run over.
2085.60s: Like A&D, even though it's a big player,
2087.32s: you can say like, well, you know, like maybe people thought
2090.12s: that their chip wasn't gonna be competitive,
2091.72s: they'll be able to do something competitive
2092.96s: and maybe they can't.
2094.16s: So from having to look at Intel, Intel sucks.
2096.72s: After all these years when it was a kingpin.
2099.16s: So you know, that's why I like to kind of sell
2102.72s: in those four or five months cycles when I can.
2104.96s: And then you always reassess on every pullback.
2107.08s: Because the pullbacks are normal.
2108.36s: They're not broken, the stocks.
2110.32s: But at the same time, sometimes the stocks
2111.68s: that you thought were gonna be winners, you find out where,
2114.28s: in fact, sometimes even though they're in the industry
2116.16s: of where the heat is, they get run over by the new engines.
2119.44s: You know what I mean?
2120.28s: I think they look at Blackberry.
2121.12s: I mean, you could have said like mobile phones
2122.80s: are gonna be the future 15 years ago or 20 years ago
2125.04s: when you were bang on right, but Apple destroyed them.
2128.12s: So if you just sat there saying like, oh,
2129.64s: you know what's gotta be, you know, come on.
2131.16s: Blackberry's still mobile phone, yeah.
2132.64s: But they got completely run over by Android and Apple.
2136.04s: So I think that's what's going on with Semi.
2138.88s: It's like, I agree.
2139.72s: Like, look at Broadcom, big move up, like,
2141.76s: Time on Semi, like, but now this quantum computing
2145.00s: changed anything.
2146.04s: I doubt in the short term if you kind of look into it.
2148.24s: But there's so much stuff coming down the pipe.
2150.68s: It's like, especially as an investor,
2152.44s: we tend to be generalists.
2154.08s: Like, I mean, like I was saying it half-joking,
2156.56s: but it's true.
2157.40s: Do you really, do you personally understand the difference
2159.68s: between, you know, an Intel chip or AMD chip
2162.92s: and an Nvidia chip, like really down to what makes
2165.12s: one so much better than the other?
2166.76s: Like, sometimes it's hard to understand
2168.56s: what these guys even do, you know, so.
2171.12s: So that's the way I look at it.
2172.44s: And that's why, you know, those drops,
2174.40s: this isn't ruined the stock, but it does give you a chance.
2177.32s: That's why a relative strength to me is so important.
2179.44s: Because the stock that just drops the least,
2183.16s: you don't have to know is that chip better.
2184.96s: The market's telling you that chip is better.
2186.76s: If AMD is down 50%, and XYZ stock is down 15%,
2192.56s: and they're both in the same group,
2194.24s: like go out, go with XYZ, like a stock,
2196.96s: like they won't sell that stock for a reason.
2199.00s: Like the people who do know,
2200.12s: the people who do make the semis
2201.32s: or the institutions where they're specialists
2203.80s: and semiconductors, like they know AMD is gonna be beat.
2206.64s: And this one's gonna be the winner.
2207.64s: So that's why to me, relative strength is so critical,
2210.00s: especially on pullbacks.
2211.96s: It's a great way to phrase it.
2213.96s: When you see all these new policies coming out
2216.72s: from our boy, Trump, you know,
2218.48s: he's out there, heckling, slinging tariffs,
2221.92s: the comedy show is back.
2223.56s: And so it's awesome.
2224.56s: I anytime I have a chance to listen to that dude talk,
2227.28s: there's a zero percent chance I miss it
2228.92s: because it's freaking hilarious.
2231.08s: He always comes up with,
2232.80s: he always comes up with something that you just don't expect.
2235.76s: On the trading desk, we had a clip from him
2237.92s: when he was running the first time saying,
2240.04s: he's like, we're gonna win so much.
2242.20s: You guys say Mr. President, please stop winning.
2244.28s: I'm gonna say no, we need to win more.
2245.88s: So every time we're having a good trading day,
2247.40s: we would have that clip on,
2248.56s: we'd all be laughing together.
2250.16s: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut off your trade thought.
2252.72s: No, that's like the exact kind of talking.
2259.96s: So with that back in terms of introducing policy and stuff,
2265.76s: it seems like there's a lot of new changes coming down the pike.
2268.88s: We're seeing deregulation likely in the financial sector.
2272.44s: We're seeing oil and gas probably coming back in a vogue.
2276.36s: We're seeing EV credits probably going away.
2279.88s: Like a lot of things I see that really stick out to me,
2284.24s: but what are your thoughts?
2286.08s: And I always love listening to a Canadian talk about this stuff
2289.20s: because I have to be honest.
2290.28s: I don't know shit about what your prime minister has talked
2293.40s: about recently, but everybody knows what's going on.
2295.72s: He doesn't know what he's been talking about ever.
2298.48s: So it's okay, don't worry about it.
2300.44s: If ever you're unhappy with your politicians,
2302.32s: you can look at Justin Trudeau and feel good about yourself all this.
2305.96s: But, God, I mean, I mean,
2308.56s: look, it's an instead of winners and losers.
2310.32s: What I really like about Trump,
2312.72s: the return of the Trump,
2314.20s: is that I think especially having a guy like Elon Musk,
2316.72s: which, I mean, sometimes some people,
2319.56s: my brother-in-law's that he teaches finance at university.
2322.52s: And his colleague is on the other side of the political spectrum.
2325.60s: He really just doesn't like Musk and Trump and all that.
2328.44s: And so, he's like, you know,
2329.56s: Musk's not even that good of a businessman.
2331.20s: And he was like, come up.
2332.64s: Like, he's maybe possibly very likely
2335.72s: the best businessman who ever,
2337.28s: like, he if you don't like his politics,
2339.84s: you can't say he's a bad business person.
2341.80s: I mean, he's winning his 50s
2343.16s: and he's like probably going to be the first trillionaire.
2345.08s: Anyways, so what I like about Trump version two,
2348.36s: better than one, is I think there's better economic guidance.
2353.04s: I think Musk isn't going to play that role.
2354.96s: I think Musk realizes, I think for his own ambitions,
2358.20s: that like, you know, even for a time
2359.40s: he's driving in the rest and everything else,
2361.56s: like space on Mars and shit.
2363.52s: Run a Mars and whatever other crazy ideas he has,
2366.12s: that he's not even articulating.
2367.24s: Like, you need the way that I thought.
2370.08s: Framework, sorry.
2371.96s: Isn't that a thought?
2372.96s: I started to cut you off.
2374.44s: That just really struck me.
2375.92s: The fact that like, he's talking about fucking colonizing Mars,
2379.92s: which is kind of crazy.
2380.76s: And your comment that you just said of,
2383.08s: even the ideas that he's not articulating.
2385.64s: That's crazy.
2386.52s: That's crazy.
2387.68s: We have to, that's openly talking about colonizing Mars.
2390.64s: And then that begs the question,
2392.40s: what else is going on in the brain?
2394.16s: That's not sorry.
2395.00s: That just, to be fair though, with Musk,
2396.96s: like so much of what he's doing, which is, to me, is amazing.
2399.84s: It's like, if you watch his old clips,
2401.60s: like I love to study people, you know,
2403.36s: as he said so much of it, like 25 years ago,
2406.16s: like I wanted, like after he sold PayPal and he has,
2408.20s: he's like, I'm going to build this, I'm going to build this.
2409.96s: And it's like wild.
2411.60s: That like any of that even happened.
2413.40s: Never mind all of it pretty much, you know what I mean?
2415.52s: So for round two, I think, at least the hope is,
2418.80s: you know, like that it's going to be more
2421.52s: thoughtfully implemented, you know, like,
2424.72s: you know, everyone's scared of tariffs, but I mean,
2426.96s: like, you know, with the right team, like a tariff,
2430.92s: it can be, if you have a domestic alternative,
2433.76s: a tariff doesn't necessarily, like,
2435.32s: hurt your domestic economy very much.
2438.40s: If you don't have a domestic alternative,
2440.84s: well, yeah, then the whole cost of the tariff basically
2442.80s: gets passed onto the consumer.
2444.44s: So like, I mean, I don't think it's going to be like blanket tariffs
2446.56s: and all the rest.
2447.40s: So like, I'm more optimistic that it's a pro business climate,
2450.36s: that's a deregulation climate.
2451.84s: If you look at any country in the world,
2453.28s: like I always tell people, like it's, like,
2456.00s: like I, and that's in some of the least racist
2457.84s: person in the world, I always tell people,
2459.12s: it's like everyone can have incredible success.
2462.08s: Like China was horrible in the 90s.
2464.60s: They started these free markets, small cities,
2466.72s: and they boomed like East West Germany.
2468.88s: West Germany was amazing.
2469.92s: East Germany was terrible because one was communist,
2472.04s: one was cap.
2473.16s: So it's like, you know, like, just get those foundations there.
2475.48s: It's not going to be perfect,
2477.00s: but moving towards free market capitalist deregulated ideas,
2482.00s: there's going to be bumps in every city,
2483.44s: but you'll have a much, much better outcome,
2485.84s: especially when you mix that with like,
2487.92s: technological breakthroughs, like AI.
2490.40s: I'm personally very hopeful for the next,
2492.68s: and not just because of Trump,
2493.68s: I think just because everything is just going
2495.56s: in a better direction, that's more pro business.
2497.96s: And pro business means, I'm someone who believes in,
2501.20s: I'd rather have a bigger pie for everyone to share
2503.72s: than a smaller pie.
2504.56s: And we're all fighting each other to cut that up
2506.24s: in a different way.
2507.08s: So I think bumps are not, like I think overall
2510.08s: it's going to be rock and roll,
2511.12s: especially tie that with AI and all the rest.
2513.20s: It's going to be some amazing opportunities.
2515.52s: Amazing.
2516.76s: Do you see any specific sectors or industry
2519.68s: that you expect to suck over the next two years?
2524.32s: Or within whatever timeframe,
2525.76s: just a reference period?
2528.84s: Anyone, I think anyone who relies on big government spending,
2534.80s: even though Trump is very like,
2536.96s: you know, pro-military and all the rest,
2538.84s: like, you know, like, you know,
2540.92s: we got like Musk, like he was just joking recently,
2542.72s: like why are people still designing and building like F-35,
2546.24s: you know, like Jets, when drones are the future?
2548.96s: Like I think it's got, like if you're an incumbent person
2551.88s: where you benefit from regulation,
2554.92s: like a lot of companies like LIKE regulation,
2556.80s: if you're the big, the big boy,
2558.08s: a regulation protects you,
2559.24s: it's like a mold that keeps others away from you.
2561.96s: So I would be more concerned of people
2564.24s: who are very entrenched and benefit from big government.
2566.76s: Like that's where I think the pain can come
2568.88s: and stod your companies that are not as willing
2571.60s: to kind of move into new tech.
2573.56s: Cause it's like with the internet,
2575.00s: if you didn't embrace the internet that you were running over,
2577.60s: so that's where I think that the risks come.
2581.40s: The other element I think about green energy stuff like that,
2585.76s: there's been a bunch of stuff in there
2587.04s: that I think is already starting to show early weakness.
2589.40s: At least you only trade to the upside though, right?
2591.92s: You don't fade stuff.
2593.56s: Yeah, if I do like I'll do two parts.
2595.16s: Like I'm not, I don't like being short typically.
2596.88s: I'm not like a short guy.
2598.12s: Yeah, I'm, I'm reckless.
2600.80s: I don't care.
2601.80s: Up down sideways.
2603.32s: It's my mind, like my first year trading pro was 2008
2606.52s: and like I made good money that year
2607.84s: and I traded along the whole year.
2609.40s: I don't know what I would have done if I had to trade short,
2610.96s: but I just traded long, it's just the way my mind works.
2612.96s: So yeah, yeah, which is,
2614.64s: I was at the point like, why fight it?
2616.24s: You know, if you know what you're going to have,
2617.32s: like don't like, you know, so.
2620.16s: And I think something like AI,
2624.96s: AI has the ability to quite literally transform,
2628.92s: I mean, most industries to some degree in some way,
2631.64s: even if we're talking things like HR process, but not.
2634.88s: What do you think this does to labor force?
2637.76s: And what do you think that that leads into
2640.76s: over the rollout of AI?
2643.48s: Yeah, I think everyone's worried about it,
2644.84s: but if you look back at like most technological revolutions,
2648.44s: you never really see them like,
2649.88s: you know, over let's say the intermediate term
2651.60s: into any real trouble, like people just start doing.
2654.64s: Re-skill things, you know what I mean?
2656.28s: It's like, I don't know if you heard of Malthus' theory,
2658.64s: it's like one of the early economists,
2660.20s: like they thought the world was gonna have like peak population
2662.96s: because there's only so much food you can grow.
2664.52s: Well, yeah, well, the amount of crops
2666.08s: we get at break ranges like skyrocketed
2668.08s: with better technology so we could feed more people.
2670.08s: So like I'm an optimist in that respect.
2672.88s: The AI revolution is gonna be weird compared to others
2676.48s: because like I feel up until now,
2678.88s: almost every revolution is like worked
2680.64s: to replace manual labor.
2683.04s: This is the first time where I think like white-collar people
2686.08s: are probably more like at risk
2687.48s: because if I think if you're a manual laborer,
2690.52s: it works to your benefit, like it's very hard
2692.56s: to kind of replace someone who lays tiles in a house
2694.88s: or something like that or in a building.
2696.04s: So I think that's gonna be tricky,
2698.52s: which like people haven't experienced.
2701.52s: So if you have a mid-manager job
2704.40s: and you're 50 years old,
2706.16s: it's like you gotta start to kind of concern yourself
2708.96s: or if you're like what the future will be.
2710.92s: Like you better be on track with what's happening,
2714.12s: I would say, for your own benefit.
2716.24s: I thought you were gonna say that they were gonna have to start
2717.92s: working on the dance moves in case they'd go be a stripper.
2720.32s: But okay.
2721.32s: That's always that.
2722.80s: That's business, it's business.
2724.60s: The world's the whole profession,
2725.84s: it's hard to replace that with AI.
2727.48s: Exactly.
2728.32s: So and everybody has needs.
2730.12s: Okay, so for everybody that's in the chat,
2733.88s: if there is anything that you want to ask Matt,
2737.24s: you could start throwing it in now.
2738.64s: I have a couple more questions for him
2740.00s: before we wrap in like five, six minutes.
2743.96s: The 2025 key themes that you have in mind,
2750.28s: if you were to pick a few of them on how you're interpreting
2753.84s: what kind of things you wanna get into,
2756.32s: you wanna eyeball, you wanna position into for 2025.
2760.20s: What are those?
2761.20s: To me, one of the top is autonomous driving.
2763.36s: I think it finally can come to fruition.
2766.84s: And if you saw just recently GM pull their crews
2771.00s: like autonomous driving program.
2772.72s: So like it's basically a two horse race,
2774.44s: it's Google and Tesla.
2776.20s: It's two companies who have the potential to change
2779.04s: how everybody in the world moves.
2781.84s: Like think of like the scale of what that can mean.
2783.96s: It's like enormous.
2785.60s: So for me, that's one of the big ones
2788.56s: is autonomous driving.
2789.88s: And everything really, to me, it's like an AI centric play.
2792.68s: But the thing is, I don't know how it's all gonna play out.
2795.48s: Like new names come up, like Estara Labs came out.
2799.76s: You know, they try and like speed up
2802.00s: how like data transfers and all the rest.
2803.76s: And so it's like just being awake,
2805.88s: I think one of the themes that we're gonna have to,
2807.24s: that will be big is new IPOs, new young companies.
2810.96s: It's been a very frozen IPO market.
2813.16s: Yeah.
2813.96s: Tie that in with like the regulation
2815.48s: and a better market,
2816.24s: I expect to see a lot more of that coming.
2817.88s: So I think just being on the lookout
2820.72s: for every company in every industry, like in Fintech,
2823.12s: I'm really focused on Fintech, like Lenders
2826.20s: with a back job of falling interest rates.
2828.60s: And now like better in models,
2831.60s: I think they can have a huge upside move.
2834.08s: Upstart is a stock I've been on for a while.
2836.00s: They were big like last cycle
2837.64s: and they got creamed with all that.
2839.20s: But they've been coming back, they've been doing great.
2841.64s: And it's interesting I was reading like the company reports.
2843.84s: And they were saying like over the past two years,
2846.72s: so everyone hated on the stock.
2848.40s: They improved their models, not more than expected.
2850.60s: They improved their models more than they thought was possible.
2853.24s: Like I think like up to 90% of their process
2855.16s: is fully automated.
2856.64s: Like start sprinkling on even more AI capability
2859.76s: and data processing, that's huge.
2862.20s: So I thought I was driving everything AI
2863.88s: and how that's gonna leak through
2865.20s: to things like Fintech are like my big focus is going to 2025.
2870.04s: What about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin?
2872.52s: I think that's, I know that cryptocurrency
2875.20s: might not be your direct bag,
2876.48s: but it seems like there's a lot of things in Fintech
2878.48s: that are gonna be able to play the game
2880.52s: as that seems to be a massive, massive initiative.
2884.56s: Like I like Bitcoin.
2886.08s: Like I think Bitcoin is, it's hitting critical mass
2890.28s: to a point where it's like keeps snowballing itself higher.
2893.36s: But to me, I feel like everything else crypto related
2896.56s: hasn't found the right product market fit.
2899.60s: Like they're trying to make crypto do things that it,
2902.64s: there's like, you know, like I like to be start
2904.68s: on a books to an entrepreneur books.
2905.92s: It's like, you know, something has to be just good enough
2909.12s: to keep its position.
2909.96s: Like if you're gonna, like this lodge,
2912.04s: like incumbent technologies and stuff,
2913.52s: you gotta be much better.
2914.76s: So I feel like Bitcoin is caught in the imagination,
2917.28s: but everyone try and do everything crypto.
2919.80s: I don't know who else the winners are gonna be,
2922.00s: like all these small coins and stuff.
2923.64s: Like a lot of it is very scammy.
2925.52s: So like I'm just, I mean, I'm long like
2928.40s: Microsoft and trading Microsoft,
2929.84s: they actually just got it to the NASDAQ 100,
2931.76s: which is cool.
2932.76s: So hopefully we're trading higher Monday.
2934.76s: So still like pressing that, you know,
2936.52s: through I bit and the rest, but beyond Bitcoin,
2940.28s: I don't see where the big theme is or I can't see,
2943.20s: I can't see where the endgame is for other crypto related
2946.44s: things.
2947.56s: Well, the good part too is with something like
2949.72s: micro strategy and sailors genius plan
2953.76s: to just do convertible debt, you know,
2955.88s: so that the new people that are buying debt
2957.60s: are subsidizing the existing positions.
2959.56s: It's kind of really cool to see you just be able
2962.68s: to make money out of thin air and just keep dealing that.
2965.60s: So I'm excited to see how that goes for him.
2967.92s: It's funny, like the way he explains it,
2970.20s: he explains it so like matter of fact
2971.96s: that he can't lose because Bitcoin keeps going up.
2973.80s: But wild.
2975.60s: It's basically just a really big leverage position
2978.08s: and I'm aware of it.
2978.92s: Literally.
2979.76s: Like I mean, if Bitcoin drops, like the company
2982.28s: is in very big trouble, like if there's no special magic
2985.32s: that he's found besides like leverage.
2988.28s: I know.
2989.12s: I have this amazing strategy that I'm gonna have.
2991.32s: I'll have you to invest with me with.
2993.24s: You let me a lot of money.
2994.64s: I'm gonna buy a few QQ because the stock market
2997.08s: just goes up.
2998.72s: And so as it goes up, then I'll borrow more money
3001.36s: and I'll buy more stocks and the stocks will go up even more.
3004.44s: Like yeah, it's all stocks go up.
3005.72s: It's a great strategy.
3006.56s: We'll make a lot of money together.
3007.56s: But if there's a problem somewhere, I mean,
3009.96s: and like to be fair, like Bitcoin was down to,
3012.80s: was like 15,000, like just a couple of years ago.
3015.08s: So it's not like it's impossible for this to go down.
3017.60s: So, but that, you know, when you trade long enough,
3020.88s: you get cynical about a lot of things.
3022.80s: So I try and balance all that.
3024.64s: But anyways, it's just the way he talks about it
3027.16s: is if it's like a cat mistradigy,
3029.72s: and I just see a lot of things.
3031.92s: And so.
3032.92s: That's honestly, that's the, that is the problem
3035.24s: because I traded MicroShreddyshees
3036.64s: who specifically on the breakout that it had
3038.96s: in early November.
3040.68s: Say it.
3041.84s: Yeah.
3042.68s: And like it's no problem, right?
3045.40s: Like companies are gonna have ups and downs.
3046.72s: But yeah, the fact that he,
3048.04s: every, he intelligent leverage, like dog.
3051.68s: What?
3053.28s: What's me?
3054.28s: Bro, like, it's not leverage.
3057.84s: It's intelligent leverage.
3059.20s: It's different.
3060.20s: It's different.
3063.12s: All right.
3063.96s: So there's a couple of things I saw come in that I want to ask you
3065.52s: quick. One of them is from Tommy.
3067.04s: He says are a, a, I software companies going to get customers
3071.24s: to pay.
3072.04s: That's actually a great point.
3073.72s: So companies like Microsoft Apple, CRM, Amazon.
3076.44s: What do you think about that?
3077.88s: I think so.
3078.88s: Like I think we have to move past like I was surprised Apple
3081.60s: on such a bump with their thing because like these like funny
3084.56s: emoji or whatever.
3085.80s: Like to me, that's nonsense.
3087.20s: I don't think it was a pay for that.
3088.44s: But if you can have things that are going to be productive,
3092.32s: like a helpful productivity, like chat, like I paid 20 bucks a month
3095.04s: for chat GPT and it saves me a ton of time.
3098.16s: I'm very happy.
3099.00s: Like I find that way, way more value than so many other
3102.96s: softwares that I pay for.
3104.12s: So I think they will.
3105.92s: I think we're early days.
3107.92s: It's kind of like the parallel I would draw is like, if you,
3112.44s: I mean, I don't know how Tommy is with the question.
3114.28s: But if you go back early enough and be like,
3115.84s: would people really pay for like data on their mobile phone?
3118.56s: Well, the early mobile phones you couldn't do much with data.
3121.40s: So the ads were like, oh, why would they pay for that?
3123.88s: But you have to kind of see how it'll snowball and grow over time
3127.36s: and how one thing builds on another.
3128.84s: So I think, I mean, like look, look at how like minimum wage
3133.68s: of gone up right and all this kind of stuff.
3135.00s: If I can save you 10% of your time in the day, every day,
3139.28s: you wouldn't pay me 25 bucks a month.
3141.68s: I mean, I wouldn't make that short.
3142.84s: If you could save me two percent of my day,
3144.80s: every day I'd give you $25 a month.
3146.40s: What $25 a month?
3147.52s: So like I think there is a big opportunity.
3149.76s: But yeah, it can't just be,
3151.60s: but that's the bad part about growth investing
3153.96s: is that people will start like, AI, AI,
3155.80s: and it becomes like this, like this fairy dust of like
3159.36s: whatever magic stuff, like no,
3161.04s: at the end of the day, it has to be a pro-dust.
3162.68s: So that brings dry's value.
3164.08s: But I do think they'll get there.
3165.48s: Autonomous driving is one.
3167.24s: I mean, think of how many people would rather have
3170.64s: an autonomous vehicle, you know,
3172.12s: what's safe and we're all sure about that.
3174.40s: Over having to pay more for someone to come pick you up,
3177.60s: make conversation with that person.
3179.12s: Like I bet a ton of people will say,
3180.32s: like give me the robot at half price.
3182.60s: I don't have to talk to anybody in the car, you know?
3184.52s: So that's also just because you're too nice.
3186.80s: Because if I get him with like a lift or somebody in the room,
3188.92s: they start trying to talk to me,
3189.92s: but like, sorry, I don't feel like talking.
3191.28s: I just don't need it.
3192.12s: I have to be nice.
3192.96s: It's a problem.
3193.80s: I know.
3194.64s: And then you got to get you got to talk to him
3195.64s: about maple syrup and stuff.
3196.64s: I get it.
3197.48s: It's a big thing.
3198.48s: I feel you.
3199.48s: And then Bueller just wanted to let you know
3201.48s: that he was very thankful for you hanging out.
3204.84s: He said that you're funny.
3205.88s: I think you're funny too.
3208.28s: And then Tommy says, would you pay $200 a month
3210.92s: if AI improved your work day a lot?
3213.40s: Yes.
3214.56s: It's a no-brainer.
3215.44s: Yeah, that is a no-brainer.
3217.12s: I, and I think a lot of people at this point,
3219.80s: they have enough disposable income of some sort
3222.40s: to be able to scrounge up something like that
3224.36s: if it makes a big impact.
3226.04s: And the other thing I think for AI on top of that
3228.64s: is because it can be so scalable
3231.24s: that can naturally control some of the costs.
3233.56s: They're going to come up with different tiers.
3235.24s: I'm sure.
3236.44s: Yeah.
3237.24s: Well, I think almost everybody paid,
3239.28s: like everyone has their main car.
3241.00s: How many people have a second car
3242.52s: that they're paying five, six, eight, and a $1 a month for?
3244.72s: Which they're barely using,
3245.76s: but that those two times where it saves you
3248.16s: the 45 minutes to walk to a store,
3249.96s: I mean, you're paying for that convenience for that time.
3252.36s: Why wouldn't you pay $200 if it could maybe save you time,
3254.68s: even make you more effective
3255.80s: and help you to make more money at what you're doing?
3257.72s: I would easily, I'd get, I'd pay $1,000 a month
3260.32s: if it's something that could help me
3261.44s: be productive enough.
3263.16s: I mean, why don't you pay for Bloomberg terminals?
3265.24s: $3,000 a month because it allows them
3267.56s: to be extra productive with their trading.
3269.72s: I mean, it's 100% that would do it.
3272.60s: Yeah, definitely, man.
3274.96s: As always, it is an absolute pleasure hanging out.
3277.64s: Like I told you, we can talk a little bit more,
3280.08s: but I'd love to set up something like maybe monthly
3282.20s: or something like that, just to both should see
3284.36s: what's going on in the world.
3285.36s: Because it's always a pleasure.
3286.28s: You balance me out.
3287.12s: You're a nice person.
3287.96s: I'm not.
3288.80s: So it's good to find my way around good people.
3291.56s: It helps reform me, I think.
3293.08s: So thanks for hanging out, man.
3295.00s: Anytime, man, always a pleasure.
3297.32s: For anybody that wants to get a hold of Matt,
3299.08s: you can go to his website.
3300.96s: I think that's the main landing page for you now, right?
