0.00s:  I think last time we spoke, you were like 20,000,
2.24s:  it's almost 28 good stuff man.
4.48s:  Who knew?
5.92s:  All right, it looks like it's going through now.
7.76s:  I'm just gonna have to drop a new link for it really quick.
10.24s:  But that's easy.
12.80s:  Perfect.
13.88s:  All right, so here's the new link.
16.72s:  I'm gonna drop it in here, new link.
20.72s:  And then I'll put it on X as well.
27.20s:  And then we should be good.
29.36s:  Yeah, that was weird.
30.20s:  A lot of times you can pretty seamlessly run it through
35.12s:  another like relay service.
36.36s:  But for some reason it didn't like it.
39.32s:  So,
41.44s:  blockcat.
47.00s:  Cool.
48.32s:  That'll be all right.
50.16s:  Cool, everybody can make their way in as they figure out
53.32s:  their lives as I'm trying to figure out my life.
57.16s:  Looks like everybody's following over to the other one,
59.56s:  which is good.
60.56s:  They should all have access to the new link.
62.00s:  So we'll pivot over to this one.
63.48s:  Beautiful dude.
65.32s:  When you use your ears is live.
68.24s:  That is correct, sir.
70.80s:  Yeah, so we're good.
74.08s:  What's poppin, everybody?
76.64s:  Yeah, welcome over folks.
78.12s:  Sorry for the last minute change.
79.56s:  You know how that goes sometimes.
81.28s:  Literally had it all set up.
82.56s:  I have like a, I don't know, I'd call it like a 15
86.04s:  percent hit rate with trying to go live through zoom.
88.80s:  It's not the worst, but it's also not the most seamless.
91.32s:  So we figured it out though.
93.20s:  What's up, man?
95.08s:  Nothing much, man.
95.96s:  Just enjoying the year end.
97.84s:  What's been a good market, a good market, a year strong markets.
100.36s:  And it's about it just looking forward to chatting with you.
103.12s:  It's always a pleasure.
104.36s:  Did you, did you trade APP?
107.76s:  You know what?
108.44s:  It's like I look back and like how did I miss APP?
112.32s:  It's like the most perfect like set up like a couple of months
115.40s:  back.
116.28s:  Dude, vertical, unbelievable.
118.36s:  I did you so dirty because I got in on the 11th of September
123.08s:  and I used options on it.
124.68s:  I can.
125.88s:  I literally think it might be one of my biggest trades.
129.44s:  Definitely for the year, but it like might be a multi year
132.00s:  period for me because when I got in, it was sub 100.
135.64s:  It was like 98.
137.20s:  And then I got, yeah, I got out when it was like four.
141.24s:  I forgot what it got up to.
143.40s:  But as you know, that's not my style of trading at all.
147.68s:  So like I didn't deserve that in the least.
150.00s:  I just kind of like randomly.
151.32s:  You came and you came to out do me and my my style of trading.
154.04s:  Is that it?
155.04s:  Is that what you're trying to kick this off with?
156.00s:  What I'm trying to say, there's no chance I ever could.
158.60s:  But, but I'm telling you, every once in a while,
163.32s:  a blind squirrel does find a nut.
165.12s:  And it was so funny because when I was putting on the trade, dude,
170.44s:  I was like, I saw volume expand massive.
174.44s:  Actually, I'll pull up a chart really quick because it's kind
178.04s:  of interesting now that I look at it because it's,
181.64s:  hey, honestly, I'm actually really surprised that you didn't,
185.24s:  that this wasn't your, your bag.
187.20s:  This seems like the exact kind of thing that you would find
190.04s:  your way into.
191.04s:  But yeah, I had originally gotten in here and it was for two
197.64s:  very simple reasons.
199.60s:  The first one is it started to break out and it was on crazy volume.
204.12s:  I didn't know why and I did zero research.
207.36s:  I didn't know anything about the earnings.
208.84s:  I don't even know what the company did when I bought it as,
211.44s:  you know, people in my field tend to do.
215.68s:  No, nothing about what we do.
217.08s:  I it's whenever I talk to my wife about like what I do as a trader,
221.16s:  I literally tell her I just look at like colors on a screen.
225.28s:  If I like the colors, I'll do something.
227.32s:  If I don't like the colors, I don't do anything.
229.16s:  And that's about my existence.
230.76s:  But yeah, that was a funny entry.
233.96s:  Now, at a curiosity though, with your general approach,
236.88s:  maybe trading view, maybe I should pull that up
238.68s:  because this is obviously all messed up from the scale.
241.68s:  But where like where in this would your typical entry window be?
248.64s:  I mean, you nailed it perfectly.
250.08s:  The reason I kind of slipped on this one is just because
254.16s:  a good market will have so many nice setups come in your way.
256.68s:  So there's a lot of stuff I'll be building into at that time.
258.76s:  I see.
259.60s:  And so sometimes you already got like a foolish portfolio.
261.72s:  And it's like, no, to be honest, like now looking back,
265.04s:  it's like home run trade.
266.16s:  Sometimes, you know, a lot of people like,
268.60s:  I'll tell them it's like, you don't always know,
271.84s:  you're buying five, six, 10 stocks.
273.96s:  You don't really know the one that's gonna pull off something like this.
276.48s:  It's kind of like your, it's a right environment.
278.56s:  You're looking at the right setups.
279.48s:  And sometimes your place pretty full.
281.76s:  And so it's just like for that reason,
283.20s:  you're not just like constantly forever extending yourself.
285.52s:  So I mean, the way you did,
286.84s:  the way you did it was like the classic set up.
290.12s:  I mean, it was perfect.
291.24s:  And especially, you know, that is the quintessential move is when,
295.96s:  you know, like you can't buy a stock.
297.88s:  Like I mean, like it took off.
298.88s:  If you're waiting in any way,
300.52s:  if you even just flinch and said,
301.88s:  I'm gonna wait for a pullback,
302.92s:  I'll wait for the volatility to die down,
304.52s:  I'll wait for it to go side, it's never stopped.
306.88s:  So like it's like the stocks that you can't buy
308.92s:  are the stocks that you should buy.
310.20s:  That's a perfect, perfect example.
311.92s:  What a beautiful, what a great way to phrase that by the way,
316.00s:  because I've not heard that before.
317.44s:  And I don't know if that's something you say a lot,
319.20s:  but if not, you should because the statement of the stocks
324.44s:  that you can't buy or the stocks that you should buy,
326.52s:  like that's a great way to frame it.
328.68s:  And I imagine for a lot of traders,
331.12s:  that does take a while to get used to,
332.56s:  is like buying stuff high and then trying to sell it higher.
335.24s:  That's very, very counterintuitive.
337.44s:  And even for myself, sometimes it's like you know it to be true,
341.56s:  but then after other times it's like,
343.96s:  because at the same time you're always trying to balance,
345.80s:  which is that leading stock,
347.00s:  but also you wanna avoid buying things that are extended,
349.64s:  even good stocks could kinda come up,
351.92s:  pull back against you.
353.56s:  So especially when things are start to kick off
356.08s:  and it's like you have to remind yourself,
357.68s:  because there's the other set of stuff that will look
359.96s:  more timely, like oh this one hasn't gone yet.
362.28s:  I think it's a natural built-in emotion we have from life,
366.20s:  looking for a dealer at this counter, what, you know,
368.32s:  so it's like after it might not all,
369.88s:  like just buy the one you could buy,
371.68s:  just find the way, even if it's more expensive, buy that one.
374.60s:  And nine times out of 10,
376.56s:  that's the one that just keeps going, it's crazy.
378.64s:  I mean how long have people been saying Palantir is all a value,
382.04s:  and it's just like, triple again, you know,
384.56s:  like so, you never have a different way.
387.00s:  So really fun story about Palantir.
390.64s:  I recently did a, it was a video actually,
395.08s:  think about Palantir, it was about Palantir maybe so far,
398.20s:  maybe both of them.
399.72s:  And there was a bunch of people on seeking Alpha
403.60s:  that we're talking about how it's, you know,
405.76s:  no good at this point, it's already overextended,
408.00s:  like all that kind of stuff.
409.52s:  And I obviously can't help but just find it comical,
412.64s:  that exactly to your point stuff that's like that tends
415.04s:  to keep being like that.
417.04s:  Like, well it just keeps going dude, so whatever.
419.68s:  That's about all you really need, I think.
422.24s:  Another question about that stock,
425.92s:  as I was looking at it out of sheer curiosity,
429.28s:  I had, I was using the 10 and the 20,
435.40s:  that essentially follow the trend.
437.40s:  Now, a lot of other times that I do that
440.24s:  for a breakout style trades and kind of momentum
442.80s:  following at that point,
445.44s:  I find that you really can't take the rules super strictly,
449.64s:  otherwise you get chopped out a lot.
451.68s:  And I noticed that in this case as well.
456.00s:  So when you're trying to follow,
457.60s:  let's say that you find a good entry on something like this,
461.08s:  what's your approach to follow the trend
463.36s:  as it's unfolding without getting dumped out?
466.24s:  So I try and, and this like really was from William O'Neill,
469.44s:  you kind of brought up the concept,
470.64s:  but it just slowly just taken over my process.
474.32s:  But he had like this thing called the hold rule.
475.96s:  So if the stock goes up like so much,
478.52s:  like 20% within the first three weeks,
480.28s:  it's something you want to hold onto,
481.72s:  or that's kind of like the basics of it.
484.04s:  But for me, the way it's grown over time is,
487.04s:  if the stock is just very strong,
488.52s:  it's one of my best stocks,
490.60s:  I just don't want to sell it for the first two or three weeks.
493.36s:  Because there's always envy of pause,
494.64s:  there's gonna be a pullback,
495.64s:  like I'll always rather manage risk with the stocks
498.12s:  that are not going up.
499.84s:  Because yeah, that's a typical thing, right?
501.68s:  It'll pull back to a 10, you say it closes below it,
504.16s:  you exit and then it just kind of keeps rocking
506.04s:  higher three days later.
507.24s:  So I found that coming out of a base,
509.36s:  coming out of a structure,
510.92s:  the first two, three, four weeks
512.36s:  is really when the stock is showing what it's got.
515.00s:  Like if it's something that's worthwhile holding,
516.72s:  if it's worth watching.
517.52s:  So I have a bit of like a time clock going on.
520.28s:  Like I just, as long as I'm not losing money on a stock,
523.00s:  like the first couple of weeks,
524.56s:  unless it's like,
525.52s:  now there's a really great market.
526.68s:  Like if the stock is not doing anything now,
528.68s:  maybe just roll it into something else
530.16s:  because there's so much heat.
531.68s:  But like back in September at markets,
533.20s:  we're just like coming out of a bit of a slumber
535.32s:  and like all the stocks are starting to move.
538.20s:  So whenever you're at the beginning of like that cycle,
540.32s:  I find in markets,
541.32s:  go like these three, four, five, one cycles.
543.80s:  Like that first two, three, four weeks,
545.36s:  I just wanna leave it alone,
546.36s:  I just don't wanna touch it.
547.40s:  So that's usually my pride.
548.64s:  And I find that super helpful
549.92s:  because by that time like APP,
552.76s:  like those first three, four, five days,
554.76s:  the impulse would have been so strong to like,
557.04s:  you know, we went from 87 to 125,
560.04s:  the impulse is so strong to take your profit.
563.00s:  And so you just need kind of like this mindset
564.68s:  or like, no, that's just don't touch it now.
566.56s:  Like whatever it is, I'm expecting higher.
568.08s:  And say with policy or same with GEV,
570.08s:  so many others this year that I did trade,
572.40s:  ALAB recently, it's the amazing thing
575.68s:  about these kind of markets.
576.68s:  So like the time's an important consideration.
580.20s:  And your average holding duration maybe for this year
583.28s:  on some of those names,
584.28s:  what's your holding duration?
586.60s:  So for me, so it's almost like I have like a split personality.
589.92s:  Like I think you need the average,
591.20s:  it's not like a proper representation.
593.16s:  So there's probably stocks where like the average holding period
595.80s:  is like four days, you know,
597.56s:  some are a couple of days they can stop,
599.60s:  some are like a week and a half they can stop.
601.64s:  So like those are the stocks that are like the under performers.
604.36s:  And after the ones that do work,
605.68s:  like that's a different crowd.
606.76s:  That's usually like two to four months.
608.68s:  So that's a new average of three.
610.08s:  So there's kind of like,
611.08s:  if you look at the trades that split on the two sides.
614.44s:  And I was gonna ask, so like,
615.44s:  is a percentage of trades, is it like 50, 50-ish or is it like
619.44s:  the one of the four months or usually the rock star moves?
621.84s:  But it's probably like,
624.08s:  probably like close to like a 35, 65 or something like that,
627.48s:  for you know, a 37.
628.92s:  Depends on the market.
630.20s:  Like in hot markets, it could be near 50, 50,
632.44s:  or even better in bad markets.
634.64s:  It's like, could be 20, 80 for a little bit, you know?
637.00s:  So it depends with the market.
640.44s:  And when you're prospecting to enter your trades,
643.08s:  I know that you obviously follow an adapted version of CanSlim
646.80s:  that you've built and refined over time.
650.00s:  One of the things I find so fascinating about CanSlim
653.08s:  is that it is a lot of fundamentals that they look at,
658.68s:  obviously overlay with technical for timing.
661.12s:  But then if you're talking about like a quarter long
663.56s:  holding duration, that seems like a shorter window
667.12s:  for like fundamentals to fully be reflected.
669.56s:  So can you talk about that relationship a little bit?
672.68s:  Well, I'll see, so like what I find,
674.04s:  like if you could, like the alternate moves
677.56s:  for most of these big winners,
679.36s:  and seem like Will and Will Neal speaking of CanSlim
681.48s:  or anyone who does this style,
683.24s:  like the majority of the full moves of these stocks
685.96s:  are let's say 18 months.
687.20s:  That's an average full cycle for a stock to do.
690.08s:  It's entire move.
691.72s:  The thing is though, normally you'll have like a three
694.16s:  to five month really hot run,
696.12s:  then you'll have like a correction.
697.64s:  And the corrections can be 15%,
699.52s:  they can be 35%.
700.96s:  So depending on how, like because I'm a more aggressive trader,
704.32s:  I'm very concentrated, I tend to be on margin,
707.00s:  like you don't want to sit through a 35% correction,
709.36s:  like on heavy margins, it's very, very painful.
712.08s:  So if I do sit with some stocks,
714.00s:  it'll be like the few most I'm looking to kind of
717.24s:  capitalize on those individual legs,
718.88s:  it's almost like you know, like the different quarters
721.20s:  of a football game or something like that,
722.48s:  you think a bit, so it's like I try after each quarter,
724.44s:  like to reassess like who do I want to stay in
728.32s:  or just move the cash and look to kind of rebuild and do it again.
731.04s:  So like that's what works for me with my personality.
734.12s:  Like I always tell people, like it could be the best strategy
736.36s:  in the world, it doesn't mix with your personality,
738.20s:  it won't work, you know, so that's how I found it to be helpful.
742.40s:  I literally say the same thing all the time,
744.20s:  literally the same thing, because it's that exact note
748.56s:  is like the definition of square peg round hole.
751.24s:  And there was actually a post that came across on Reddit,
754.24s:  not too long ago, I liked to post on there once in a while.
757.72s:  And there was somebody that was in like the day trading subreddit.
760.88s:  And they were like, they, the silliest thing, dude,
765.04s:  they were like, I'm so good at swing trading,
768.28s:  but I want to be a day trader so bad.
770.32s:  Why, I don't know why, why do you want to torture yourself?
773.96s:  You can't do the first thing I thought is just like,
778.24s:  how stupid is this that like you're just worried about a label,
782.76s:  swing trade every day, now you're a day trader,
784.72s:  like who gives a fuck?
786.64s:  What the label is, bro, just do what works,
789.16s:  exactly to your broader point of find what, what gels with you.
796.00s:  Now, you mentioned something there that drew my interest
799.16s:  about the use of margin, and it begs the natural question,
802.84s:  why use margin when you can use option?
805.56s:  And don't get it.
807.08s:  So I have like, I think you're slowly seeking it to my brain.
810.44s:  I'm trying to fucking wear you down, bro.
812.56s:  You are working down.
814.80s:  But like I've been, I've been really working on, again,
819.00s:  I like to get concentrated, I like to be aggressive.
821.52s:  It's just my natural thing.
822.44s:  If I think markets are hot, if I'm like,
824.72s:  if I'm only 120% invested, I'm upset on myself.
828.68s:  I want to be aggressive.
829.68s:  When you start getting to like that, 150%, 200% invested
833.16s:  the volatility is wild.
834.48s:  So the thing is with options that they're less liquid,
837.92s:  the expire, your pain, the implied volatility,
841.92s:  all the times is a draw.
843.16s:  So like what I like to do, what I've begun doing,
845.68s:  is not get really, really heavy.
846.92s:  But when I have indicators that will show me
849.24s:  that we're stretching the short term,
851.44s:  I'll start to kind of buy some, let's say,
853.44s:  two, three week put options,
855.48s:  a little bit out of the money so the cost is not too much.
857.36s:  Because again, kind of like I was saying before,
859.12s:  sometimes the corrections are 10%.
861.28s:  They're like, okay, that's cool.
862.36s:  No, it's not a big deal.
863.48s:  So that's a 30% or there could be a downgrade.
865.80s:  All these girl stocks, like analysts love to downgrade them
868.52s:  and it's like they get these big massive hits out of nowhere.
871.12s:  So I've found, so I've started to incorporate them more
873.76s:  and more to kind of just to smooth out the equity curve.
876.00s:  But like, so the way I kind of use it,
878.04s:  so basically once you're running up,
880.24s:  it's probably different than how you would do it.
881.72s:  But like the way I look at it is,
882.84s:  what I wanna be totally long,
884.12s:  I want the full delta going up.
885.84s:  But then after once I get like at an extended point,
888.20s:  then I just wanna be like a call option.
889.64s:  Like I wanna take more ups.
890.64s:  So basically you know, stock with a put,
892.08s:  you're like synthetic call basically.
894.20s:  So like I just wanna like, I want it,
895.80s:  so I still wanna be long,
896.72s:  but not a lot all the down side anymore.
898.48s:  So I start to flip that in.
899.56s:  And what's cool is like, let's say it does connect
901.80s:  and you like the stock and it pulls back normally.
905.12s:  Well, you're protected from that put that you bought cheaply,
907.80s:  but also now you can start like,
909.40s:  actually buy a more stock on that pullback comfortably
911.88s:  because there's like your big position is already hedged out.
914.20s:  So it's actually allowed me to,
915.76s:  like I've been doing it on Tesla as a leg up.
917.76s:  And it's allowed me to build a monster position.
920.32s:  And I never really took on like any additional risk
922.28s:  than I would normally,
923.12s:  but like that put the hedging stride
924.92s:  along the way worked out great.
927.16s:  Yeah, that's awesome.
928.00s:  I love that for you.
929.24s:  Yeah, it's in your point about liquidity
932.08s:  and what offers that's genuinely one of the answers
935.32s:  I was expecting to hear from you,
936.52s:  even though you didn't explicitly say,
937.92s:  you still kind of implicitly said it where a lot of the stuff
941.64s:  that I imagine you might trade may or may not even have option
945.16s:  because it can be, maybe they have quarterly,
948.20s:  I mean, some are super like now I'm like,
949.68s:  I've said, I'm trading Tesla,
950.84s:  but that's of course,
952.00s:  those are great.
952.84s:  Yeah, no, not a problem at all,
953.84s:  but if it's a young IPO,
955.92s:  I mean, what's the, what's the vault,
957.88s:  the volatility, the pricing in and how liquid is it
960.80s:  and how far out?
961.64s:  So a lot of time it's just,
963.12s:  and then it's like, I found the breakout,
964.40s:  the breakout fails,
965.28s:  then you're trying to roll out of these liquid options
967.64s:  and it becomes a bit tricky.
968.60s:  So I like to build the position up.
970.40s:  No, it's going my way.
971.36s:  I can take my time to hedge where I want
973.60s:  and kind of smooth out the equity curve.
975.60s:  So it's a different approach of this.
978.84s:  Yeah, very, very.
979.96s:  And that's one of the reasons why I love doing these, right?
982.60s:  Is it's a chance not just for you and I
984.44s:  to bullshit and share some different ideas,
986.40s:  but it's also for people to hear different, different ideas
988.84s:  because yeah, it's, I find,
992.12s:  that's a big filter that I apply.
994.12s:  It's, I don't only trade options,
995.88s:  I absolutely will use the underlying itself
998.76s:  if it's something that looks really, really good.
1001.04s:  And I feel like that's the only way
1002.88s:  reasonably to gain entry.
1004.24s:  But yeah, the,
1006.28s:  even stuff that has decent liquidity,
1009.36s:  you, I find that if there's a really big balance
1011.88s:  between how far out in time you go
1013.92s:  to decrease your daily theta,
1015.88s:  even though there's a higher gross theta,
1018.28s:  you kind of have to strike a balance
1020.20s:  because if you go out too far,
1021.76s:  then you are giving up more and more liquidity,
1024.04s:  which is a problem.
1025.40s:  So I can totally see that.
1028.08s:  One of the other things I noticed though
1030.24s:  with this, the like the breakout style of trading,
1033.24s:  this, I've used it way more this year
1036.24s:  than the past few years because it just,
1039.56s:  I keep a pretty detailed log
1041.32s:  and I can see like what's,
1042.56s:  I'm always prospecting,
1044.24s:  but I can start to see like what's catching
1046.00s:  and it's like, okay, this is actually starting
1047.96s:  to really move the needle a bit.
1050.64s:  One of the things I noticed though is,
1053.64s:  I wanted to pick your brain on the timing of entry.
1058.08s:  Obviously, that's the name of the game, right?
1060.12s:  Like that's a difficult part.
1061.64s:  And I find, I have no problem entering on a breakout
1068.40s:  if it fails, take the exit,
1070.56s:  whatever the defined exit is,
1071.72s:  typically shortly below,
1073.28s:  wherever the, the lows were right before the breakout,
1075.44s:  the consolidation phase.
1077.00s:  And if it starts breaking out again,
1078.24s:  then I'll just get right back in.
1079.60s:  Like I really don't have any problem with that at all.
1082.00s:  Is that something you do?
1084.48s:  So I used to do more of that.
1085.64s:  Like the example of APP you showed,
1087.64s:  like that is the textbook example of like,
1089.96s:  what William Wanniel was showing his books.
1091.76s:  Like that was, that's like,
1093.36s:  that's the reason why you would use a breakout strategy
1096.08s:  because it's not doing much of anything
1098.08s:  then boom breaks out and it's done.
1100.12s:  I found that, I think it's because of HFTs
1104.00s:  and algals which have become more and more powerful,
1106.16s:  that's more and more rare to see.
1108.96s:  You don't see it that way so often.
1110.88s:  Typically, the big move happens like before the breakout,
1114.96s:  then you come back in.
1116.00s:  So I am rarely, like unless it's like something like an APP,
1118.80s:  like I have a much stronger filter.
1120.56s:  Like that day the volume was huge.
1122.40s:  Like that was like,
1123.24s:  you need to have something that will make that day seem better
1126.04s:  because a roster so many fake breakouts,
1129.32s:  that even like, oh, I get out, I get back in,
1131.12s:  like that can get real costly
1132.64s:  because those reversals are fast.
1134.12s:  And you can tell, like if you're buying that breakout,
1136.76s:  and it's up 6%, and all of a sudden,
1139.12s:  it's up 4, 3, 2, you're like,
1140.56s:  ah, the machines, that was totally a machine.
1142.60s:  And like you just know it, now I'm getting out,
1144.24s:  everyone's getting out at the same time,
1146.20s:  the spreads widen, I guess,
1148.20s:  and it's like, then you feel like adults.
1149.88s:  And also, like I typically like to start building
1153.60s:  into a position.
1154.44s:  So if I like the way the chart looks,
1155.76s:  like I'm building it's usually prior to the breakout
1157.64s:  a little bit and then if it does have a big power for move,
1160.64s:  maybe I'll add a little, but I wanna see a close up there.
1163.40s:  And then typically the next couple of days,
1165.04s:  I'm looking for kind of backfill or consolidation pause.
1168.12s:  So like APP is an example, like again,
1170.52s:  I already had a pretty full plate at that point.
1172.88s:  But even if not, if I wouldn't miss that initial breakout,
1175.00s:  like it's harder to chase, it's up 2, 3 days in a row.
1177.72s:  Most don't have that straightaway type of move.
1180.12s:  There's a lot of backfill.
1181.32s:  So I prefer the backfill, I prefer like the pre-breakup.
1184.88s:  I actually prefer everything but the breakout now,
1187.56s:  these, because I find it's, I mean,
1190.24s:  again, there's a logical argument for it,
1191.84s:  because that's like, hey, the stock's finally going,
1195.20s:  but the machines have become very powerful.
1197.32s:  And they read the books too.
1198.76s:  They can see that the retail flow,
1200.36s:  and I just read that, even pro flow coming on breakouts.
1203.08s:  And it's like, they're so,
1204.80s:  they're such an incentive to like push and fade.
1207.76s:  You know, if they can push enough liquidity to fade it,
1209.88s:  just that 8%, they know all the stops will trigger
1212.52s:  and then they cover those shorts,
1213.48s:  and then they can get along and take it up a second time.
1215.52s:  You know, so over a course of like a few hours
1218.40s:  or a couple of days, like that's quite a profit.
1220.20s:  You can do on size if you have the capability
1222.32s:  to pull it off.
1223.16s:  So that's why I don't do the breakouts
1226.24s:  as much as people would think I do.
1228.36s:  Yeah, so it sounds like you're almost trying
1229.92s:  to front run them a little bit.
1232.08s:  And then, yeah, front run or away from the confirmation,
1234.72s:  I'd rather pay a little bit higher and then build an after,
1238.36s:  then like try and go with the stop order.
1240.44s:  Like you miss something like an APP sometimes.
1242.76s:  It's a real hard one to miss, but a lot of times,
1245.48s:  it's like, it gets very, and it's a good market.
1247.52s:  Like it in a choppy market, it's like 10X the chop, you know,
1250.28s:  like everything's failing.
1251.48s:  So it's, it can get tricky.
1254.32s:  Yeah, that leads to the, to the follow on actually,
1256.64s:  is that I've even noticed in the last couple of weeks
1259.68s:  that stuff seems to have slowed down, not a ton,
1263.48s:  but I'm not seeing as many things that are popping up
1266.12s:  that are looking quite as promising.
1269.88s:  Have you seen that or you're just looking at different stuff?
1273.16s:  Well, I think it's because most stocks have been correct.
1275.36s:  I mean, like if you look at the,
1276.88s:  it's not just like the small cast,
1278.40s:  but if you look at like yes and P500,
1280.24s:  the SPY versus the RSP, RSP is like equal weights
1283.68s:  at S&P 500.
1284.68s:  Like it's still like large cap index,
1286.72s:  but it's been literally falling for I think 10
1289.28s:  or 11 straight sessions, whereas, you know,
1291.48s:  the QQQ looks great.
1292.52s:  So it's been, like the past couple of weeks,
1295.04s:  it actually been okay, if you were in just the right names,
1298.20s:  there was like a few like real, there's been a,
1300.16s:  there's a couple of main themes that have been powerhouses,
1303.20s:  everything else has been kind of consolidating.
1304.68s:  I think it's rotationary, like I think this market's
1306.92s:  really strong.
1307.76s:  I think there's like massive field winds.
1310.04s:  Like I think the AI revolution is gonna like,
1312.96s:  you know, people are talking Tesla,
1314.40s:  like Tesla's the AI revolution
1315.84s:  because I mean, autonomous driving is an AI answer,
1318.24s:  that's not being accelerated.
1319.44s:  So, and it's really a US centric development.
1323.92s:  Like there's no other country that has any kind of,
1326.92s:  I was just about out of its cart, the Palantir CEO,
1328.92s:  it's like he was even saying that there's no country
1330.56s:  that has the technology, the energy capacity,
1334.20s:  the intellectual, like you know how,
1336.60s:  how to put this together.
1337.60s:  And it's a revolutionary approach to how we do everything.
1341.32s:  So, like I think this is such a strong market.
1344.40s:  I think we're getting rotations like Broadcom,
1346.52s:  like the semi conducts have been dead,
1347.80s:  not suddenly Broadcom had a big move on Friday.
1350.64s:  And so like now those are gonna take a pause.
1352.32s:  And then, you know, I bet my,
1354.52s:  the way I'm positioned,
1355.48s:  like there's Santa Claus rally and small mid caps
1357.32s:  are gonna rip all of a sudden.
1358.40s:  And people will be like, oh,
1359.24s:  the ones that were quiet are suddenly going, you know,
1361.52s:  so I think it's rotationary.
1363.64s:  Speaking of that, what's been going on with small caps?
1367.12s:  They're like, I don't get it.
1369.52s:  Like everybody else is partying right now.
1371.84s:  Small caps, they're even,
1372.92s:  it looks like they're gonna get their cut this month.
1375.72s:  And they're just like, what are they doing?
1378.72s:  What's the problem?
1379.72s:  I think it's just like, I mean,
1381.68s:  in the market world, we forget about
1383.40s:  like the real economy a lot of times.
1384.84s:  But like, you know, like there's the haves,
1387.76s:  like all the great companies, the Google's, Madda's,
1390.92s:  you know, Tesla, where they're cost of cap was super cheap.
1393.56s:  Like the demand for their product,
1394.76s:  people are addicted to social media,
1396.20s:  they're almost getting off-med,
1397.12s:  just because of like, they're having a hard time at work.
1399.56s:  Like everyone's on all this stuff.
1400.96s:  And so for them, it's like, whatever,
1402.84s:  but for small caps, like, you know,
1405.56s:  like the, you know, the impact of inflation on margins
1408.52s:  and like maybe a bit of a slower economy
1411.12s:  than people wanted, like that has a real,
1412.88s:  so they're not really screaming it.
1413.96s:  I think there's gonna be a catch up
1415.04s:  when rates finally come down.
1416.28s:  And also, I think they thought rates
1417.96s:  were gonna fall quicker than they are,
1419.28s:  and they're not,
1420.12s:  because the fed's being a little more conservative here.
1423.24s:  So it's like always kind of like,
1424.36s:  they promise the gift
1425.60s:  and they can't pull it back.
1426.52s:  So like at some point they'll get a massive tailwind.
1429.64s:  There'll be some not-performance,
1430.72s:  but you know, at the same time,
1432.96s:  as an institution, it's usually you go to a small cap
1435.48s:  for high growth.
1436.68s:  And that's the way I usually think, you know, small,
1438.44s:  even I prefer mid caps.
1440.56s:  But you're looking suddenly at something like a Tesla
1443.12s:  or a Google or whatever,
1444.40s:  and like, you're gonna revolutionize like,
1446.24s:  autonomous, they think of all the,
1447.96s:  the impact of autonomous,
1449.76s:  so you get all the liquidity of a trillion dollar company
1452.72s:  with the same growth rates
1454.36s:  or higher than a small cap,
1456.40s:  with the cost of capital of an established sort of,
1460.28s:  it's like kind of the usual pull
1463.44s:  if the smalls are not there, you know?
1465.64s:  Yeah, yeah,
1466.64s:  because I've been obviously playing a couple of thematic moves
1470.12s:  in the Russell just because of expectations on when
1473.16s:  the rate cut would find its way in.
1475.92s:  And I think we saw some of that,
1477.52s:  what was it in like July,
1480.16s:  fell back, then we saw some of it in October,
1484.52s:  I think it was like mid late October,
1486.48s:  there was another pop,
1487.84s:  it didn't like really, really,
1490.32s:  I don't know, it's definitely had some big moves,
1492.48s:  but it's also been pulling back way more
1494.96s:  than I would have expected.
1496.16s:  It's been a while.
1497.16s:  It's been a while.
1498.16s:  Yeah, yeah.
1499.00s:  I'm kind of rare to see.
1500.60s:  Yeah, because I feel like they could like,
1502.04s:  totally understand the consolidations,
1503.76s:  especially on something like this,
1504.96s:  but it's almost like a radic.
1507.12s:  And I can't quite put my finger on the pricing methodology
1511.36s:  that's going on there.
1512.52s:  Like I can't,
1513.64s:  because to me to cause those moves,
1515.92s:  you need big institutional participation of some sort.
1518.68s:  But it's hard for me to think that there's institutions
1521.24s:  that are getting in in like the beginning of July,
1524.68s:  and then two weeks later, they're like,
1526.40s:  ah, nah, never mind, this is all bad.
1528.08s:  Let me get completely out and then it reverts back
1530.40s:  to where it was before.
1531.24s:  It just, it confounds me.
1532.96s:  The only thing that made sense to me is,
1535.40s:  I think there's been a big trade on where,
1537.56s:  it's like your large,
1538.32s:  your long large caps, short small caps,
1540.40s:  like a market neutral approach.
1542.52s:  And every time there's like the hope
1544.00s:  of more aggressive rate cuts,
1545.12s:  which is more bullish in short term,
1547.56s:  like you know, in theory, small caps,
1549.48s:  it's like that, that trade goes and reverse.
1552.24s:  It goes one point this summer,
1554.36s:  where it's like literally the QQQ
1556.92s:  and the Russell were trading completely inversely
1558.96s:  to each other.
1559.80s:  Yeah.
1560.64s:  Like if the Russell was up 2%,
1562.24s:  the Qs were down 1% and vice versa.
1565.04s:  So I think that trade got pushed
1567.32s:  to the every few years,
1568.24s:  there's like a trade that takes over.
1569.48s:  It was the carry trade at one point.
1570.80s:  There's always like a trade that takes over,
1572.48s:  that all the institutions,
1573.32s:  like everyone thinks the hedge fund guys
1574.60s:  are like these geniuses,
1576.20s:  but a lot of them all have some drinks at night.
1578.04s:  What are you doing that kind of a trade at?
1579.84s:  And suddenly everyone has the same trade on
1581.76s:  because it's making money.
1583.04s:  So I think everyone gets on one side of the trade.
1584.96s:  And so you're seeing basically all those pops
1587.92s:  are the fear moments where,
1589.48s:  why gotta get out of this trade?
1590.64s:  And the small caps are less liquid.
1592.28s:  So it's like they're all trying to do it at the same time
1594.68s:  and then it's put back on.
1596.28s:  So I think you're just seeing yet with a curve
1597.92s:  of like the guys who are putting on this long short
1601.72s:  triple Qs or Russell or whatever.
1603.56s:  And that's only to me that explains it
1604.96s:  because overall the advance,
1606.16s:  if you just look at let's say a 50 day moving average,
1609.00s:  it's up to the right.
1610.24s:  But the moves are like you're up 12%?
1612.80s:  Where is it?
1613.64s:  You're up at which doesn't make any sense.
1615.48s:  So it's definitely some kind of liquidity driven strategy,
1621.28s:  move that's coming off and on.
1623.48s:  Yeah, and that's the part that I find so fascinating
1626.20s:  by because I was looking at it for a little while
1629.00s:  and like the Russell was flat for a long, long part
1634.56s:  and then all of a sudden it was starting to catch up
1637.12s:  to the S&P 500.
1638.16s:  They weren't that far apart.
1639.20s:  They were like five, six points apart.
1640.92s:  And then they've obviously decoupled now
1642.92s:  where it spies up almost what like 30%
1645.84s:  and Russell's like sub 20 still.
1648.76s:  Yeah, that's why I think I have a feeling
1652.48s:  going to your end you'll probably get like a catch up move.
1654.56s:  So we'll see what happens.
1655.84s:  But it's been it's been wild to see I agree.
1658.88s:  And if you're at the perfect example
1660.64s:  if you're a breakout trader,
1661.68s:  like that's a painful advance.
1663.40s:  You know, you look back and it's still out of your pants
1666.12s:  where you're saying what I just lost money the entire time.
1668.36s:  I bought it or something.
1669.52s:  I felt out of it.
1670.52s:  And it's like you know, you want to like hit something
1672.92s:  but that's why I was a bit of balance
1675.24s:  on the entries and whatnot.
1676.24s:  But it's been a definitely been a wild charge for sure.
1679.20s:  Yeah.
1680.04s:  And well, you're coming on the breakout trading
1681.48s:  might make a lot of sense because I couldn't imagine
1684.44s:  that being like the thing you the thing somebody does.
1687.68s:  Because I feel like if that's the only thing somebody does,
1691.20s:  you just have to be a glutton for punishment.
1693.88s:  You just have to be okay,
1695.64s:  getting kicked in the shin over and over again
1697.60s:  until you get your couple home runs.
1699.64s:  Like a really anytime I run the strategies,
1702.00s:  it's like the win rate is typically okay.
1704.44s:  It'll still hover around like 60%,
1706.40s:  which is a decent win rate.
1709.44s:  But there's still a lot of losing trade.
1712.32s:  It's 40% of trades losing is not good.
1715.96s:  Yeah.
1716.80s:  You know what?
1717.64s:  I think it goes back to like I said before markets
1719.76s:  were so much simpler.
1721.08s:  Like people didn't have the knowledge they had.
1722.60s:  So a lot of these strategies,
1724.48s:  like I mean, will you know,
1725.32s:  we'll start trading in the 50s, the 1950s.
1728.36s:  You know what I mean?
1729.20s:  So it's like back then you said you ordered to the floor,
1732.00s:  a guy went to the post, he bought the stock.
1734.08s:  It was in algorithms like moving this and that's all.
1736.88s:  It was different.
1737.72s:  If the stock had not gone anywhere for a while,
1739.96s:  and then suddenly would go to new highs on a big bit of volume,
1743.12s:  probably was an insider buying
1744.60s:  or someone would use something about the company.
1746.12s:  Like it was very meaningful, like immediate information now.
1750.52s:  So and it's easy to teach.
1752.72s:  It's a very teachable strategy.
1754.44s:  You wait until it's in the base
1756.16s:  and then after it breaks the new highs,
1758.04s:  that means people want it.
1759.16s:  And logically it is correct.
1761.36s:  But markets are pretty efficient.
1763.80s:  I always say that, you know, they say it's not perfectly efficient,
1766.44s:  but it's pretty efficient.
1767.80s:  Pretty awesome.
1769.00s:  You know, like the machines that they're mad say,
1771.28s:  hey, that you have these people who run in on this idea
1773.60s:  and then run out and you know,
1775.28s:  you've been there so long, every cycle,
1777.04s:  there's new people who come and learn,
1778.72s:  and they learn the basics first
1780.00s:  and it takes time to realize it's not bad at easy, you know.
1782.84s:  So yeah, yeah.
1784.72s:  It's, yeah, this past year's been really interesting
1787.68s:  just because it's led me to lean into some of the other kinds
1791.96s:  of approaches that I got a little dusty
1794.12s:  that I had necessarily been using a lot of the stuff
1796.92s:  before that was really, really focused on volatility
1800.80s:  and because it was everywhere.
1803.40s:  Now, when you look back over 2024,
1808.04s:  what are some of the primary themes that stuck out to you?
1811.00s:  Not the obvious ones, not the high interest rate environment
1814.92s:  and stuff like that.
1816.20s:  What were some of the themes that you picked up this year
1818.36s:  that were more novel that you're like,
1820.12s:  oh, this is kind of a new thing I'm seeing.
1823.28s:  In terms of actual stock themes or like investing process.
1826.56s:  Whatever makes you happy.
1829.32s:  Well, sometimes you know, it's interesting,
1831.40s:  but one thing I thought that was gonna be stronger
1833.32s:  was cybersecurity.
1834.32s:  Like you would think with the AI revolution
1836.00s:  and that, you know, there'd be an,
1837.32s:  an emphasis on like stopping fakes into this and that.
1840.64s:  So that was like an early,
1843.40s:  theme I was putting on early in the year
1845.08s:  that didn't kind of like come to fruition.
1847.92s:  Like I, it's a bit of like you look back at the cost,
1849.80s:  like wasted time, like there was other things
1851.24s:  that were working better.
1852.08s:  So this year was tricky in a sense that there was a lot
1857.84s:  of rotations in themes.
1859.08s:  So, you know, the semiconductors were red hot.
1861.84s:  And then like look at AMD now.
1863.32s:  Like it's, it's awful.
1865.04s:  I mean, like terrible, you know,
1866.40s:  but at the same time like broad commas now blasting off.
1868.52s:  So it's like a lot of stocks in the end did generally well,
1873.56s:  but if you were in the wrong place in the wrong time,
1875.80s:  you still, it still could have been very painful for you.
1878.24s:  So there's a lot of that rotational themes that would come in,
1880.84s:  which is, it's pretty normal.
1882.28s:  Like most markets will have that.
1885.24s:  What I think, again,
1886.76s:  well, my kind of like base case that I've been trying to follow
1889.32s:  was like the internet rule out the 90s where,
1892.16s:  you know, it wasn't just, you know,
1894.16s:  people making mainframe computers that dominated,
1896.88s:  it was, it was first, it was like, you know,
1898.60s:  routers and switches and ethernet cables.
1900.76s:  Then that went to internet portals,
1902.28s:  then I went to browsers,
1903.52s:  then I went to mobile phones.
1904.68s:  So it's like everything built on itself.
1906.28s:  So if you're just kind of sat back,
1908.20s:  you know, like the NAS that kept going up,
1909.84s:  if you sat back in that original theme saying like,
1912.40s:  that's it, these are the guys who are going to lay the foundation
1914.96s:  for everything.
1915.84s:  Well, once they got fully priced,
1917.12s:  like the market went on to like what was going to come next and next and next and next.
1920.72s:  So that's kind of what I was expecting.
1923.32s:  It's not always easy to catch even if you're expecting it,
1925.64s:  because I mean, you don't really know,
1926.64s:  like it's all new technology, like looking back,
1928.72s:  it's easy to study.
1929.72s:  In real time, it's like, sometimes I look at these companies
1931.88s:  and I spent 20 minutes and I'm like, what they do?
1934.84s:  Like what is this contraption that they have?
1936.88s:  You know, like, you know, so,
1939.88s:  but like that's the way you have to think.
1941.32s:  So I think it's typical,
1943.76s:  but it's never easy.
1945.52s:  But definitely, like I think looking at it from the lens of how the internet rolled out
1950.00s:  like through and how like if there's reverberations through different industries
1953.60s:  and how the industry itself drew,
1955.12s:  I think that's the right way.
1956.24s:  So I think it was to the point,
1958.64s:  but yeah, that's kind of,
1960.68s:  I think the themes that came out were just always trying to understand
1964.76s:  what's going to come next.
1965.84s:  You know, and how it's going to be the next player.
1969.04s:  I think your point on semiconductors is massive,
1971.88s:  because I think that that caught a lot of us off guard.
1975.00s:  The fact that they've hailed off,
1977.52s:  literally as a sector, quite as hard as it did.
1980.80s:  And that also seems,
1984.44s:  I can't fully tell what that's driven by.
1985.96s:  It's not like demand for semiconductors is going to go away,
1989.24s:  even now that we're talking about just more computing,
1992.80s:  being required for everything.
1994.36s:  Beyond AI, but now we have this new emergence of quantum computing
1998.36s:  with Willow and Google that's been worked on for 12 years.
2002.44s:  Now that's starting to gain some traction.
2004.56s:  So when you think about a sector like semiconductors,
2009.64s:  what are your thoughts on it?
2010.52s:  You think that this is just profit taking for people
2012.52s:  that are got in super low,
2014.36s:  Scrooge McDuck in it,
2015.40s:  swimming in gold coins,
2016.88s:  or like it just seems like the demand is
2019.68s:  and actually contracting that.
2021.96s:  It goes back here to the question,
2023.36s:  like we were saying how long do you stay in these stocks?
2025.96s:  Because the market exaggerates the way up
2029.04s:  and exaggerates the way down.
2030.64s:  So like when you're on the way up,
2032.60s:  like for example, not pounded,
2033.88s:  like I had a great traded pound here.
2035.24s:  I got in like 20s, I exited like in the 70s,
2038.44s:  which was a great trade.
2039.24s:  But like even have some clients say,
2041.08s:  like why are you selling pound here?
2042.24s:  Well like look, it is trading like at 65 times sales.
2045.12s:  Like I always say, I wish I could start any company
2048.44s:  and sell it at 65 times just my sales for the year.
2051.36s:  Like I'll sell at a year one, it's gone.
2053.20s:  You know, like think about it.
2054.04s:  Like 65 years should now be dead.
2056.16s:  I can get all of those sales like done now, you know?
2058.56s:  Like that value.
2060.32s:  So the thing is it's like I love pound.
2062.00s:  I think pound here is in such a unique spot,
2065.32s:  like in the AI ecosystem.
2067.64s:  But like, you know, look, I mean,
2070.12s:  the market will just get ahead of itself on the way up.
2072.16s:  Then it has to, so at some point,
2073.56s:  you know, like pound here is gonna correct or make a base
2076.28s:  and it'll be, you know, it'll work again.
2077.60s:  But also sometimes like with the semis,
2080.80s:  when it's new technology,
2082.04s:  like stuff's moving so quickly, sometimes it's like
2084.60s:  someone has run over like AMD,
2086.08s:  even though it's a big player, you can say like,
2087.80s:  well, you know, like maybe people thought that their chip
2090.84s:  wasn't gonna be competitive,
2091.68s:  they'll be able to do something competitive
2092.96s:  and maybe they can't.
2094.12s:  So from having a good intel, Intel sucks
2096.68s:  after all these years when it was like kingpin.
2099.12s:  So you know, that's why like I like to kind of sell
2102.68s:  in those four or five months cycles when I can't
2104.96s:  and then that you always reassess on every pullback
2107.04s:  because the pullbacks are normal.
2108.32s:  They're not broken, the stocks.
2110.28s:  But at the same time, sometimes it starts
2111.68s:  that you thought we're gonna be winners,
2113.44s:  you find out where, in fact, sometimes even though
2115.20s:  they're in the industry of where the heat is,
2117.60s:  they get run over by the new engines, you know what I mean?
2119.84s:  I think they look at Blackberry.
2120.88s:  I mean, you could have said that mobile phones
2122.76s:  are gonna be the future 15 years ago or 20 years ago
2125.00s:  and like you're bang on right, but Apple destroyed them.
2128.08s:  So if you just sat there saying like, oh,
2129.60s:  you know, it's gotta be, you know, come on.
2131.12s:  Blackberry's still mobile phone, yeah,
2132.60s:  but they got completely run over by Android and Apple.
2136.00s:  So I think that's what's going on with semis.
2138.96s:  Like I agree, like me look at,
2140.04s:  look at Broadcom big move up, like time on semi,
2142.44s:  like, but now that this quantum computing change anything,
2145.96s:  I doubt in the short term if you kind of look into it,
2148.20s:  but there's so much stuff coming down the pipe.
2150.68s:  It's like, especially as an investor,
2152.44s:  we tend to be generalists.
2154.08s:  Like I mean, like I was saying it half-joking,
2156.56s:  but it's true, like you really,
2157.76s:  do you personally understand the difference between,
2160.60s:  you know, an Intel chip or AMD chip and Nvidia chip,
2163.76s:  like really down to what makes one so much better
2166.16s:  than the other, like sometimes it's hard to understand
2168.80s:  what these guys even do, you know, so.
2171.12s:  So that's the way I look at it.
2172.44s:  And that's why, you know, those drops,
2174.40s:  doesn't ruin the stock, but it does give you a chance.
2177.32s:  That's why I'm relatively strengthening it so important
2179.44s:  because the stock that just drops the least,
2183.12s:  you don't have to know is that chip better.
2184.96s:  The market's telling you that chip is better.
2186.72s:  If AMD is down 50%, and XYZ stock is down 15%,
2192.52s:  and they're both in the same group,
2194.20s:  like go out, go with XYZ, it's like a stock,
2196.96s:  like they won't sell that stock for a reason.
2199.00s:  Like the people who do know,
2200.08s:  the people who do make the semis
2201.32s:  or the institutions where they're specialists
2203.80s:  and semiconductors, like they know AMD is gonna be beat.
2206.60s:  And this one's gonna be the winner.
2207.64s:  So that's why to me, Relta strength is so critical,
2210.00s:  especially on pullbacks.
2211.96s:  It's a great way to phrase it.
2213.96s:  When you see all these new policies coming out
2216.72s:  from our boy Trump, you know,
2218.48s:  he's just out there, heckling, slinging tariffs,
2221.92s:  the comedy show is back.
2223.56s:  And so it's awesome.
2225.12s:  Anytime I have a chance to listen to that dude talk,
2227.28s:  there's a zero percent chance I miss it
2228.92s:  because it's freaking hilarious.
2231.08s:  He always comes up with,
2232.76s:  he always comes up with something that you just don't expect.
2235.76s:  So on the trading desk,
2236.96s:  we had a clip from him when he was running
2238.96s:  the first time saying,
2240.04s:  he's like, we're gonna win so much.
2242.20s:  You guys say Mr. President, please stop, Woody,
2244.28s:  I'm gonna say no, we need to win more.
2245.88s:  So every time we're having a good trading day,
2247.40s:  we really have that clip on,
2248.56s:  we'd all be laughing together.
2250.16s:  Sorry, I didn't mean to cut off your trade thought.
2252.72s:  No, that's like the exact kind of talking.
2256.12s:  So with that back in terms of introducing policy and stuff,
2265.76s:  it seems like there's a lot of new changes coming down the pike.
2268.84s:  We're seeing deregulation likely in the financial sector.
2272.40s:  We're seeing oil and gas probably coming back in a vogue.
2276.32s:  We're seeing EV credits probably going away.
2279.88s:  Like a lot of things I see that really stick out to me,
2284.24s:  but what are your thoughts?
2286.04s:  And I always love listening to a Canadian talk about this stuff
2289.16s:  because I have to be honest,
2290.24s:  I don't know shit about what your prime minister has talked about
2293.64s:  recently, but everybody knows what's going on.
2296.08s:  He doesn't know what he's been talking about ever.
2298.48s:  So it's okay, don't worry about it.
2300.68s:  If ever you're unhappy with your politicians,
2302.32s:  you can look at Justin Trudeau
2304.24s:  and feel good about yourself all this.
2305.96s:  But, you know what,
2308.08s:  I mean, it's an instead of winners and losers.
2310.28s:  What I really like about Trump,
2312.68s:  the return of the Trump,
2314.16s:  is that I think especially having a guy like Elon Musk,
2316.68s:  which, I mean, sometimes some people,
2319.52s:  like my brother-in-law's,
2320.76s:  he teaches finance at a university,
2322.48s:  and his colleague is on the other side of the political spectrum.
2325.60s:  Like she really just doesn't like Musk and Trump and all that.
2328.44s:  And so she's saying, he's like,
2329.32s:  you know, he's not even that good of a businessman.
2331.24s:  And he was like,
2332.60s:  he's maybe possibly very likely the best businessman
2337.28s:  like he if you don't like his politics,
2339.84s:  you can't say he's a bad business person.
2341.80s:  I mean, he's what, he's 50s,
2343.16s:  and he's like probably gonna be the first trillionaire.
2345.08s:  Anyways, so what I like about Trump version two,
2348.36s:  better than one,
2349.92s:  is I think there's better economic guidance.
2353.04s:  I think Musk isn't gonna play that role.
2354.96s:  I think Musk realizes,
2356.40s:  I think for his own ambitions,
2358.20s:  that like, you know,
2358.88s:  even for a time when he's driving in the rest
2360.56s:  and everything else, like space.
2362.08s:  Dona Mars and shit.
2363.52s:  Runa Mars and whatever other crazy idea he has,
2366.08s:  he's not even articulating, like you need,
2368.76s:  you need the ring.
2369.60s:  That's not a framework, sorry.
2372.00s:  Isn't that a thought?
2373.00s:  I started to cut you off.
2374.48s:  That just really struck me.
2375.96s:  The fact that like,
2377.80s:  he's talking about fucking colonizing Mars,
2379.96s:  which is kind of crazy.
2380.84s:  And your comment that you just said of,
2383.12s:  even the ideas that he's not articulating.
2385.68s:  That's crazy.
2386.60s:  That's crazy.
2387.76s:  We have to,
2388.68s:  that's openly talking about colonizing Mars.
2390.68s:  And then that begs the question,
2392.44s:  what else is going on in the brain?
2394.20s:  That's not, sorry.
2395.04s:  To be fair though with Musk,
2396.96s:  like so much of what he's doing,
2398.80s:  which is to me is amazing.
2399.84s:  It's like, if you watch his old clips,
2401.60s:  like I love to study people, you know?
2403.40s:  As he said so much of it, like 25 years ago.
2406.16s:  Like I wanted, like after he sold PayPal
2407.76s:  and he has some,
2408.60s:  he's like,
2409.44s:  I'm gonna build this, I'm gonna build this.
2410.44s:  And it's like wild.
2411.84s:  Like any of that even happened.
2413.40s:  Never mind all of it pretty much, you know what I mean?
2415.52s:  So for round two,
2416.84s:  I think at least the hope is, you know,
2419.04s:  like that it's gonna be more softly implemented, you know,
2423.36s:  like everyone's scared of tariffs,
2426.52s:  but I mean like,
2428.72s:  you know, with the right team, like a tariff can be,
2431.56s:  if you have a domestic alternative,
2433.76s:  a tariff doesn't necessarily,
2435.12s:  like hurt your domestic economy very much.
2438.40s:  If you don't have a domestic alternative,
2440.84s:  well yeah, then the whole cost of the tariff basically
2442.84s:  gets passed onto the consumer.
2444.48s:  So like, I mean, I don't think it's gonna be like blanket tariffs
2446.56s:  and all the rest.
2447.40s:  So like I'm more optimistic that it's a pro business climate,
2450.40s:  that's a deregulation climate.
2451.88s:  If you look at any country in the world,
2453.36s:  I always tell people, like it's like,
2456.04s:  like I'm in that sense,
2457.16s:  I'm the least racist person in the world.
2458.56s:  I always tell people it's like,
2460.00s:  everyone can have incredible success.
2462.08s:  Like China was horrible in the 90s.
2464.64s:  They started these free markets, small cities,
2466.72s:  and they boomed like East West Germany.
2468.92s:  West Germany was amazing.
2469.96s:  East Germany was terrible because one was communist,
2472.04s:  one was cap.
2473.16s:  So it's like, you know,
2474.00s:  like just get those foundations there.
2475.48s:  It's not gonna be perfect,
2477.00s:  but moving towards free market capitalist deregulated ideas,
2482.00s:  there's gonna be bumps in every city,
2483.44s:  but you'll have a much, much better outcome,
2485.80s:  especially when you mix that with like technological breakthroughs,
2489.04s:  like AI, I'm personally very hopeful for the next,
2492.68s:  and not just because of Trump,
2493.64s:  I think just because everything is just going
2495.56s:  in a better direction that's more pro business.
2497.92s:  And pro business means,
2499.72s:  I'm someone who believes in,
2501.16s:  I'd rather have a bigger pie for everyone to share
2503.72s:  than a smaller pie.
2504.56s:  And we're all fighting each other to cut that up
2506.24s:  in a different way.
2507.08s:  So I think bumps are not,
2509.24s:  like I think overall it's gonna be rock and roll,
2511.12s:  especially tie that with AI and all the rest.
2513.20s:  It's gonna be some amazing opportunities.
2515.52s:  Amazing.
2516.76s:  Do you see any specific sectors or industry
2519.68s:  that you expect to suck over the next two years,
2524.28s:  or within whatever timeframe,
2525.76s:  just a reference period?
2528.88s:  Anyone, I think anyone who relies on like big government spending,
2534.56s:  like you know, even though like Trump is very like,
2536.96s:  you know, pro military and all the rest, like,
2539.92s:  you know, like, you know,
2540.92s:  we got like Musk, like he was just joking recently,
2542.68s:  like why are people still designing and building like F 35,
2546.28s:  you know, like jets, when drones or the future,
2548.96s:  like I think it's got, like if you're an incumbent person
2551.88s:  where you benefit from regulation,
2554.92s:  like a lot of companies like LIKE regulation,
2556.80s:  if you're the big, the big boy,
2558.04s:  a regulation protects you,
2559.24s:  it's like a mold,
2560.36s:  that keeps others away from you.
2561.96s:  So I would be more concerned of people
2564.20s:  who are very entrenched and benefit from big government.
2566.76s:  Like that's where I think the pain can come.
2568.84s:  And then stod your companies that are not as willing
2571.60s:  to kind of move into new tech.
2573.56s:  Cause it's like with the internet,
2575.00s:  if you didn't embrace the internet that you were running over.
2577.60s:  So that's where I think that the risks come.
2581.40s:  The other element I think about green energy stuff like that,
2585.28s:  I, there's been a bunch of stuff in there
2587.00s:  that I think is already starting to show early weakness.
2589.40s:  At least you only trade to the upside though, right?
2591.92s:  You don't fade stuff.
2593.56s:  Yeah, if I do like, I'll do two parts.
2595.20s:  Like I'm not, I don't like being short typically.
2596.88s:  I'm not like a short guy.
2598.12s:  Yeah, I'm, I'm reckless.
2600.84s:  I don't care.
2601.84s:  Up down sideways.
2603.32s:  It's my mind like my first year trading pro was 2008.
2606.52s:  And like I made good money that year.
2608.12s:  I traded along the whole year.
2609.40s:  I don't know what I would have done if I had to trade short,
2611.00s:  but I just trade line.
2611.84s:  It's just the way my mind works.
2613.00s:  So yeah, yeah, which is like,
2615.40s:  like Wi-Fi, you know, if you know what you're going to have,
2617.28s:  like don't like, you know, so.
2620.08s:  And I think something like AI,
2624.96s:  AI has the ability to quite literally transform,
2628.88s:  I mean, most industries to some degree in some way,
2631.64s:  even if we're talking things like HR process, but not.
2634.88s:  What do you think this does to labor force?
2637.76s:  And what do you think that that leads into
2640.76s:  over the rollout of AI?
2643.48s:  Yeah, I think everyone's worried about it,
2644.84s:  but if you look back at like most technological revolutions,
2648.44s:  you never really, like, you know,
2650.04s:  over let's say the intermediate term into any real trouble,
2652.72s:  like people just start doing.
2654.64s:  Rescilling things, you know what I mean?
2656.28s:  It's like, I don't know if you heard of mouthless hysteria.
2658.64s:  It's like one of the early economists,
2660.20s:  like they thought the world was gonna have like peak population
2662.96s:  because there's only so much food you can grow.
2664.52s:  Well, yeah, well, the amount of crops we get at break ranges,
2667.20s:  like skyrocketed with better technology
2668.96s:  so we could feed more people.
2670.08s:  So, like I'm an optimist in that respect.
2672.88s:  The AI revolution is gonna be weird compared to others,
2676.48s:  because like I feel up until now,
2678.84s:  almost every revolution is like worked to replace manual labor.
2683.04s:  This is the first time where I think like white-collar people
2686.08s:  are probably more like at risk,
2687.48s:  because if I think if you're a manual laborer,
2690.52s:  it works to your benefit,
2691.52s:  like it's very hard to kind of replace
2693.52s:  someone who lays tiles in a house
2694.88s:  or something like that or in a building.
2696.04s:  So I think that's gonna be tricky,
2698.28s:  which like people haven't experienced.
2701.52s:  So, you know, if you have a mid-manager job
2704.40s:  and you're 50 years old, it's like,
2707.12s:  you know, you gotta start to kind of concern yourself
2708.96s:  or if you're gonna only, what the future will be.
2710.88s:  Like you better be on track with what's happening,
2714.08s:  I would say, for your own benefit.
2716.20s:  I thought you were gonna say that they were gonna have to start
2717.88s:  working on the dance moves in case they had to go be a stripper.
2720.28s:  But, okay.
2721.28s:  Okay, that's always that.
2722.52s:  Yeah, that's business.
2723.96s:  It's a business.
2724.80s:  The role of the whole profession is still,
2726.04s:  it's hard to replace that with AI.
2727.44s:  Exactly, so, and everybody has needs.
2730.08s:  Okay, so, for everybody that's in the chat,
2733.84s:  if there is anything that you want to ask Matt,
2737.24s:  you could start throwing it and now,
2738.64s:  I have a couple more questions for him before we wrap
2740.76s:  in like five, six minutes.
2743.96s:  The 2025 key themes that you have in mind,
2750.28s:  if you were to pick a few of them on how you're interpreting
2753.84s:  what kind of things you wanna get into,
2756.32s:  you wanna eyeball, you wanna position into for 2025.
2760.20s:  What are those?
2761.24s:  To me, one of the top is autonomous driving.
2763.36s:  I think it finally can come to fruition.
2766.80s:  And if you saw just recently GM pull their crews
2770.96s:  like autonomous driving program.
2772.68s:  So, it's basically a two-horse race.
2774.40s:  It's Google and Tesla.
2776.16s:  It's two companies who have the potential
2777.80s:  to change how everybody in the world moves.
2781.84s:  Like, think of like the scale of what that can mean.
2783.96s:  It's like enormous.
2785.56s:  So, for me, that's one of the big ones is autonomous driving.
2789.84s:  And everything really, to me, it's like an AI centric play,
2792.72s:  but the thing is, I don't know how it's all gonna play out.
2795.48s:  Like, new names come up, like, Estara Labs came out.
2799.76s:  And they try and like speed up how like data transfers
2803.16s:  and all the rest.
2804.00s:  And so, it's like just being awake,
2805.88s:  I think one of the themes that we're gonna have to,
2807.24s:  that will be big is new IPOs, new young companies.
2810.96s:  It's been a very frozen IPO market.
2813.36s:  Yeah.
2814.20s:  Tie that in with like the regulation
2815.48s:  and the better market I expect to see a lot more
2817.24s:  of that coming.
2818.08s:  So, I think just being on the lookout
2820.72s:  for every company in every industry,
2822.32s:  like in Fintech, I'm really focused on Fintech,
2824.92s:  like Lenders with a backdrop of falling interest rates
2828.64s:  and now like better models.
2831.64s:  I think they can have a huge upside move.
2834.12s:  Upstart is a stock I've been on for a while.
2836.04s:  They were big like last cycle and they got creamed
2838.48s:  with all that, but they've been coming back.
2840.84s:  They've been doing great.
2841.68s:  And it's interesting I was reading like the company reports
2843.84s:  and they were saying like, over the past two years,
2846.68s:  while everyone hated on the stock,
2848.44s:  they improved their models, not more than expected.
2850.60s:  They improved their models more than they thought was possible.
2853.24s:  Like I think like up to 90% of their process
2855.16s:  is fully automated.
2856.64s:  Like start sprinkling on even more AI capability
2859.76s:  and data processing, that's huge.
2862.20s:  So, I thought I was driving everything AI
2863.88s:  and how that's gonna leak through
2865.20s:  to things like Fintech are like my big focus is going to 2025.
2870.04s:  What about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin?
2872.52s:  I think that's, I know that cryptocurrency might not be
2875.60s:  your direct impact, but it seems like there's a lot of things
2877.76s:  in Fintech that are gonna be able to play the game
2881.16s:  that seems to be a massive, massive initiative.
2884.52s:  Like I like Bitcoin.
2886.04s:  Like I think Bitcoin is, it's hitting critical mass
2890.24s:  to a point where it's like keeps snowballing itself higher.
2893.32s:  But to me, I feel like everything else crypto related
2896.52s:  hasn't found the right product market Fint.
2899.56s:  Like they're trying to make crypto do things that,
2902.56s:  there's like, you know, I like to be starting
2904.60s:  on books too and entrepreneur books.
2905.88s:  It's like, you know, something has to be just good enough
2909.16s:  to keep its position.
2909.96s:  Like if you're gonna, like this lodge,
2912.04s:  like incumbent technologies and stuff,
2913.52s:  you gotta be much better.
2914.76s:  So I feel like Bitcoin is caught in machination,
2917.28s:  but everyone try and do everything crypto.
2919.80s:  I don't know who else the winners are gonna be,
2922.00s:  like all these small coins and stuff.
2923.64s:  Like a lot of it is very scammy.
2925.52s:  So, like I'm just, I mean, I'm long like
2928.40s:  Microsoft and trading Microsoft,
2929.84s:  they actually got it to the NASDAQ 100,
2931.76s:  which is cool.
2932.68s:  So hopefully we're trading higher Monday.
2934.76s:  So still like pressing that, you know,
2936.60s:  to I bet in the rest, but beyond Bitcoin,
2940.28s:  I don't see where the big theme is or I can't see,
2943.20s:  I can't see where the endgame is for other crypto related things.
2947.56s:  Well, the good part too is with something like
2949.72s:  MicroStrategy and Sailors Genius Plan
2953.76s:  to just do convertible debt, you know,
2955.88s:  so that the new people that are buying debt
2957.56s:  are subsidizing the existing positions.
2959.56s:  It's kind of really cool to see you just be able
2961.84s:  to make money out of thin air and just keep dealing that.
2965.96s:  I'm excited to see how that goes for him.
2967.88s:  It's funny, like the way he explains it,
2970.16s:  he explains it so like matter of fact
2971.92s:  that he can't lose because Bitcoin keeps going up.
2973.76s:  But,
2974.76s:  wild.
2975.60s:  It's basically just a really big leverage position
2978.04s:  and I'm aware of it.
2978.88s:  Literally.
2979.72s:  Like I mean, if Bitcoin drops, like the company
2982.20s:  is in very big trouble, like if there's no special magic
2985.28s:  that he's found besides like leverage.
2988.24s:  I know.
2989.08s:  Like I have this amazing strategy that I'm gonna have.
2991.28s:  I'll have you to invest with me with.
2993.08s:  I'll give you a lot of money.
2994.64s:  I'm gonna buy a few QQ because the stock market
2997.12s:  just goes up.
2998.72s:  It's best though.
2999.56s:  As it goes up, then I'll borrow more money
3001.32s:  and I'll buy more stocks and the stocks will go up even more.
3004.44s:  Like yeah, it's all stocks go up.
3005.72s:  It's a great strategy.
3006.56s:  We'll make a lot of money together.
3007.56s:  But if there's a problem somewhere,
3009.28s:  I mean, and like to be fair, like Bitcoin was down to
3012.76s:  it was like 15,000, like just a couple of years ago.
3015.08s:  So it's not like it's impossible for this to go down.
3018.60s:  But that, you know, when you trade long enough,
3020.72s:  you get cynical about a lot of things.
3022.80s:  So I try and balance all that.
3024.64s:  But anyways, it's just the way he talks about it
3027.12s:  is if it's like a cat mistradigy.
3029.72s:  And I just know that's the only question.
3032.88s:  That's honestly that's the, that is the problem
3035.24s:  because I traded MicroShreddyshees
3036.64s:  who specifically on the breakout that it had in early November.
3040.68s:  And yeah, and like it's no problem, right?
3045.40s:  Like companies are gonna have ups and downs.
3046.72s:  But yeah, the fact that he,
3048.04s:  he intelligence leverage like dog.
3051.68s:  What's what's me bro?
3054.32s:  Like it's not leverage.
3057.84s:  It's intelligent leverage.
3059.20s:  It's different.
3060.20s:  It's different.
3063.12s:  All right.
3063.96s:  So there's a couple of things I saw come in that I want to ask you
3065.52s:  quick. One of them is from Tommy.
3067.04s:  He says are a a a software company is going to get customers
3071.24s:  to pay.
3072.04s:  That's actually a great point.
3073.72s:  So companies like Microsoft Apple, CRM, Amazon.
3076.44s:  What do you think about that?
3077.88s:  I think so.
3078.72s:  Like I think we have to move past like I was surprised Apple
3081.56s:  on such a bump with their thing because like these like funny
3084.56s:  emoji or whatever.
3085.80s:  Like to me that's nonsense.
3087.20s:  I don't think it was a pay for that.
3088.44s:  But if you can have things that are going to be productive,
3092.32s:  like a helpful productivity like chat, like I paid 20 bucks a month
3095.04s:  for chat GPT and it saves me a ton of time.
3098.16s:  I'm very happy.
3099.00s:  Like I find that way way more value than so many other
3102.96s:  softwares that I pay for.
3104.12s:  So I think they will.
3105.96s:  I think we're early days.
3107.96s:  It's kind of like the parallel I would draw is like if you I
3112.72s:  mean, I don't know how Tommy is with the question.
3114.32s:  But if you go back early enough and be like what people really pay
3117.00s:  for like data on their mobile phone.
3118.60s:  Well, the early mobile phones you couldn't do much with data.
3121.44s:  So the ads were like, oh, why would they pay for that?
3123.92s:  But you have to kind of see how it'll snowball and grow over time
3127.40s:  and how one thing builds on another.
3128.88s:  So I think I mean, like look, look at how like minimum wage has
3133.72s:  gone up right and all this kind of stuff.
3135.00s:  If I can save you 10% of your time in the day, every day,
3139.24s:  you wouldn't pay me 25 bucks a month.
3141.68s:  I mean, I wouldn't make that short if you could save me.
3143.32s:  If you could save me 2% of my day every day,
3145.08s:  I'd give you $25 a month.
3146.36s:  But what $25 a month?
3147.48s:  So like I think there is a big opportunity.
3149.72s:  But yeah, it can't just be, but that's the bad part about
3152.84s:  growth investing is that people will start like AI, AI,
3155.80s:  and it becomes like this, like this fairy dust of like whatever
3159.92s:  magic stuff like.
3160.84s:  No, at the end of the day, it has to be a pro.
3162.52s:  That brings dry's value.
3164.04s:  But I do think they'll get there.
3165.48s:  Autonomous driving is one.
3167.20s:  I mean, think of how many people would rather have an autonomous
3171.16s:  vehicle, you know, what's safe, and we're all sure about that.
3174.36s:  Over having to pay more for someone to come pick you up,
3177.56s:  make conversation with that person.
3179.12s:  Like I bet a ton of people will say, like give me the robot
3181.80s:  at half price.
3182.56s:  I don't have to talk to anybody in the car, you know, so.
3185.48s:  That's also just because you're too nice.
3186.80s:  Because if I get him with like a lift or somebody in the
3188.72s:  road, they start trying to talk to me, like, sorry,
3190.28s:  I don't feel like talking.
3191.28s:  I just don't need it.
3192.12s:  I have to be nice.
3192.96s:  It's.
3193.80s:  I know.
3194.64s:  And then you got to get you got to talk to him about maple
3195.80s:  syrup and stuff.
3196.80s:  I get it.
3197.80s:  It's a big thing.
3198.80s:  I feel you.
3199.80s:  And then Bueller just wanted to let you know that he was very
3202.80s:  thankful for you hanging out.
3204.80s:  He said that you're funny.
3205.80s:  I think you're funny too.
3208.32s:  And then Tommy says, would you pay $200 a month if AI improved
3212.00s:  your work day a lot?
3213.44s:  Yes.
3214.44s:  It's a no brainer.
3215.44s:  Yeah, that is a no brainer.
3217.84s:  And I think a lot of people at this point, they have enough
3220.76s:  disposable income of some sort to be able to scrounge up
3223.32s:  something like that.
3224.32s:  If it makes a big impact, and the other thing I think for AI
3227.24s:  on top of that is because it can be so scalable that can
3231.60s:  naturally control some of the costs.
3233.28s:  They're going to come up with different tiers.
3235.20s:  I'm sure.
3236.40s:  Yeah.
3237.24s:  Well, I think almost everybody paid.
3239.72s:  Everyone has their main car.
3240.96s:  How many people have a second car that they're paying $5, $6, $8 a month
3244.28s:  for, which they're barely using.
3245.72s:  But those two times where it saves you the 45 minutes to walk
3249.36s:  to a store, I mean, you're paying for that.
3250.76s:  And that convenience for that time, why wouldn't you pay $200 if it
3253.72s:  could maybe save you time, even make you more effective and
3255.84s:  help you make more money at what you're doing?
3257.68s:  I would easily, I'd get, I'd pay $1,000 a month if it's
3260.52s:  something that could help me be productive enough.
3263.16s:  I mean, why don't you pay for Bloomberg terminals?
3265.20s:  $3,000 a month because it allows them to be extra productive
3269.08s:  with their trading.
3269.76s:  I mean, it's 100% that would do it.
3272.60s:  Yeah, definitely, man.
3274.96s:  As always, it is an absolute pleasure hanging out.
3277.64s:  Like I told you, we can talk a little bit more,
3280.08s:  but I'd love to set up something like maybe monthly or something
3282.96s:  like that, just to both should see what's going on in the world.
3285.28s:  Because it's always a pleasure.
3286.24s:  You balance me out.
3287.12s:  You're a nice person.
3287.88s:  I'm not.
3288.40s:  So it's good to, it's good to find my way around good people.
3291.52s:  It helps reform me, I think.
3293.08s:  So thanks for hanging out, man.
3295.00s:  Anytime, man, always a pleasure.
3297.32s:  For anybody that wants to get a hold of Matt,
3299.08s:  you can go to his website.
3300.92s:  I think that's the main landing page for you now, right?
3303.16s:  Crusoe and Sexta.com.
3304.28s:  That's right.
3305.12s:  I'm calm, yeah.
3305.96s:  I'm also on YouTube.
3306.76s:  I've been trying to get some bit different videos out.
3309.56s:  I'll go through it.
3310.36s:  So inside there as well, we're on X trader on this,
3313.04s:  we're on Kuroso.
3314.56s:  Beautiful.
3315.08s:  And then on X, do you, X or do you tweet?
3317.28s:  What do you do on there?
3318.64s:  I try and be promise.
3320.36s:  I'll say I access that.
3321.72s:  I just don't know what we've, if we've moved from tweeting to
3324.92s:  Xing.
3325.68s:  Is the Xing is weird, right?
3327.60s:  Like tweeting makes sense.
3328.52s:  It's supposed to be posting.
3329.84s:  I think the official term is it's a post now set up a tweet,
3333.76s:  the official term.
3334.72s:  Literally did not know that.
3335.80s:  That makes way more sense.
3337.36s:  I think everybody like me,
3338.64s:  we're just dumb because I used to be Twitter.
3340.76s:  So you tweet and we're just applying it,
3343.24s:  wrote methodology up,
3344.72s:  some smooth brain people like me.
3346.64s:  That sounds right.
3347.48s:  Well, thanks everybody for hanging out.
