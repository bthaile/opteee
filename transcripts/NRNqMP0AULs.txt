0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
181.00s:  s
189.00s:  ,
199.00s:  center day
203.00s:  So I see we got coffee house test confirmed.
207.84s:  We are alive and well.
209.40s:  We got catch me on who is here.
211.60s:  Second Marcus trader Jonathan.
215.08s:  We got generational capital.
217.32s:  That's what we're all pursuing here.
218.92s:  So let's get to see Willie Derslup,
221.72s:  day swag, sedric that Lauren is good.
225.04s:  And as you all know, there's a bunch of familiar names to me at this point.
228.08s:  And that's probably means there's a bunch of familiar names for you too.
230.88s:  So hopefully you're making some friends along the way.
233.44s:  We also got Mr. off Putin here hanging out.
235.96s:  Beautiful.
237.36s:  All right.
237.72s:  So you already know before we get too far into the weeds here,
242.40s:  we do have to grab my little GME live stream map and see if there's any updates.
247.64s:  We need to make to this.
249.16s:  So if you've already let me know where you're from,
252.00s:  you don't have to let me know.
253.48s:  But if you've not let me know where you're from, let me know.
256.84s:  Right now it looks like from a US perspective,
260.80s:  we really need to get some people in the central north.
265.44s:  I don't know if that's what sent.
266.76s:  I don't know, is this called the west?
267.80s:  I guess it's the west.
269.44s:  What is this?
270.52s:  What do you call this?
272.00s:  Not the, I don't like the Midwest.
273.76s:  I think the Midwest is stupid.
275.92s:  So there's like, this is actually,
278.64s:  I've never really analyzed the map this way.
280.32s:  Because this is what like the center of the US,
282.52s:  if I were to eyeball a line, is this right?
287.84s:  Where's like the midline of the US?
290.04s:  Because I know that we would call this the Midwest,
292.80s:  but I don't really get why.
295.32s:  Because this is just like the west,
297.28s:  and then there's the east, northeast makes sense, southeast makes sense,
301.28s:  southwest makes sense, northwest makes sense.
305.52s:  But this is kind of like the middle of the US.
308.44s:  That's the mountain west.
310.40s:  Huh.
313.20s:  I don't know if I get on with that.
315.08s:  If you were to eyeball a midline through the US,
317.80s:  where would it be?
318.80s:  Because to me, I'm thinking it's something like here,
320.40s:  through Minnesota, because technically,
323.44s:  Maine really skews us over to this side a lot.
327.36s:  So this would be like the center of the US,
329.36s:  is what?
330.36s:  Like Eastern Kansas slash Missouri, something like that.
335.52s:  Jimmy says, not many people live in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
338.48s:  Dakota's number, yeah, definitely.
340.28s:  That's why we need to get representation here,
342.44s:  because we have to fill these in.
343.96s:  We're very close.
346.24s:  We're very, very close.
348.36s:  Jimmy says, I'm in Denver, Colorado.
350.28s:  It's considered the west.
351.92s:  If you go to Kansas, or more east,
355.36s:  would be considered the Midwest.
359.48s:  God, that's fucking, you've completely,
362.44s:  you got my mind in a blender.
366.08s:  Yeah, I'm in a blender.
367.96s:  I would consider Colorado the west,
370.84s:  because that's actually we're looking at moving here,
372.68s:  outside of Colorado Springs.
374.16s:  So we might be, well, for us,
375.64s:  it would be moving east, because we're down here,
378.24s:  but I still think that that's west.
380.04s:  This is where I started was in New York.
384.56s:  Sposed car says north central.
386.36s:  Yeah, that's what, that's what this feels like to me.
388.44s:  It's like north central US,
390.76s:  but I don't think that that's what we call it.
393.16s:  I don't know.
394.16s:  All right, so let me see if there's any that we needed to add.
396.52s:  It looks like we need to add Roseville, California.
400.00s:  And this is for via, via label.
405.00s:  I was going to say via low bow, because that's,
407.00s:  I don't know where my mind would go at that.
409.00s:  Roseville, so just outside of Sacramento.
412.00s:  I think we have Washington representation already.
416.00s:  So we're good with Washington.
420.00s:  Fort Worth, I'm almost positive we have.
422.48s:  Yep, so there's Dallas Fort Worth.
424.48s:  We'll call that good.
425.80s:  We do have,
427.20s:  that good.
428.68s:  We do have a Mexican, wait, do we have a Mexican?
431.56s:  Yeah, so we do have a Mexican.
434.00s:  We need a Cuban.
437.44s:  We do have one South American, which is good.
442.00s:  Yep.
444.64s:  And then we need an African.
449.24s:  We need a Middle Eastern for sure.
454.12s:  Russian, I don't even know if they can get on this,
456.08s:  but if they can, that would be good.
459.12s:  I would like a New Zealander.
460.84s:  Honestly, if we can get in person from Iceland, Greenland,
463.72s:  my, if there's a way for one of you to find somebody
469.28s:  from Madagascar to get onto one of these livestreams
471.92s:  so I can fill in that dot, that would be magic, I think.
475.84s:  I think that would be absolutely magical
477.96s:  to have somebody from Madagascar.
479.32s:  Because I don't know if I've ever literally met anybody.
482.68s:  I mean, I think that, is there even like cities or anything there?
485.68s:  Yeah, it looks like there's cities, there's roads and everything.
488.20s:  It shows you how much I know.
491.20s:  I don't know anything about Madagascar.
494.28s:  Yeah, it looks like Madagascar.
496.80s:  All right, we'll get started in just a second
498.60s:  as we finish going around Madagascar.
503.24s:  I had a boss when I was in the Marine Corps,
505.20s:  he wanted to go to Madagascar when we were in Australia.
508.16s:  That was like one of his game plans,
511.04s:  but he never had a chance to make it over there.
513.40s:  We'll do like a little street view real quick and see,
516.40s:  all right, what's going on here?
520.12s:  That, I mean, that looks like civilization over there, don't it?
526.40s:  Yeah, let's check this out.
531.24s:  Ooh, yeah, yeah, I feel like they have it.
534.84s:  This feels like they have internet.
537.20s:  If not, I mean, you get a star link now.
539.40s:  Daddy Elon takes care of that for everybody.
542.72s:  Yeah, this looks, this looks like they would have internet.
547.12s:  It's not like completely out in the middle of nowhere.
549.32s:  All right, and let's grab like some random
551.36s:  as spot Madagascar really quick.
553.12s:  We really guys want to go north or south Madagascar.
555.32s:  I want to see if I can find something that's like out in the middle
557.96s:  of nowhere.
558.76s:  I think that would be really cool.
562.92s:  Wiggly says who needs civilization when you have empty land to sit in?
565.92s:  Yeah, northeast.
568.12s:  Got it.
568.48s:  Let's do northeast.
572.72s:  Let's click this.
574.48s:  This looks good.
576.12s:  Oh, this reminds me of like Costa Rica.
579.72s:  This is like straight up rainforest action.
583.12s:  That's not what I expected.
585.32s:  From there, oh, let's check out the coast really fast.
588.32s:  Is there anything that's close to this coast that we can click?
593.72s:  Come on, Google.
594.72s:  Here we go.
597.32s:  A new Google would keep it real for us.
601.92s:  Who knew?
604.72s:  Not at all what I expected.
609.52s:  Not even remotely what I expected.
612.92s:  That's fascinating.
615.32s:  I genuinely thought that that was going to be like a sandy beach.
621.52s:  I did not expect that at all.
623.52s:  Wow, that's so cool.
625.12s:  Okay, so yeah, we definitely need someone to get us a representative
630.92s:  from Madagascar.
631.92s:  It feels like that that's got to happen.
634.52s:  Okay, so I think we're caught up on the updates here though.
639.92s:  Yeah, Costa Rica is sick.
642.52s:  Completely, completely agree.
645.52s:  Jimmy says I honestly pictured all of Madagascar as a jungle.
648.32s:  I think that that's like a really fair cop, right?
650.52s:  Like I think because this looks very deserty.
654.32s:  And then this you could tell is like super tropical up here.
659.92s:  So yeah, that's absolutely fascinating.
665.12s:  Eric, it sounds like you visited.
666.72s:  Have you been to the Pacific or Caribbean side of the country?
669.72s:  Both.
670.52s:  Yeah, I've been to both.
671.92s:  I essentially I've been I've been super fortunate.
674.72s:  I've been a lot, a lot of places at this point in my life.
676.72s:  But one of my favorite hobbies is actually scuba diving.
679.72s:  So pretty much everything that's in this area I've hit.
684.32s:  Like I've been out here to the Galapagos.
688.52s:  Yeah, I've been through yeah, pretty much most of the Caribbean I've been I haven't been to Cuba because the I was still on active duty for most of the time and Cuba was still, you know, communist not not a lot of go there for military people, especially with like if you have a clearance, they don't let you.
706.52s:  But pretty much everybody else everywhere else in the in the Caribbean have been.
713.52s:  All right, so now pivot over quick recap where where are we at?
717.32s:  We've now left Madagascar and we have now teleported to the end of January of 2021 and we've gone through how many trades have we done so far?
727.32s:  I haven't even counted how many is this.
731.12s:  31 trades.
732.12s:  Well, 31 position updates, I should say it's definitely more trades than this.
736.52s:  And day swag says I'd love to buy a house one day in Jamaica so I can be with my family.
740.52s:  I've been to Jamaica and I have to be honest, I didn't have a great time.
745.12s:  Jamaicans in general that I met were awesome.
749.52s:  The part that I didn't really like is they kept stealing shit from us.
754.12s:  That got a little old every time that we would try to I like snorkeling and scuba diving.
759.12s:  So every time we would try to find a spot on the beach to be able to go in and like snorkel,
764.52s:  we would try to put our stuff somewhere and that the shit was gone like almost every time that got super frustrating.
772.02s:  So I just wish they didn't have to take my shit when I went in the water because most of the places that I've been in the Caribbean, it's kind of like the exact opposite where it is much.
783.12s:  It's like there was a place when I was in green Cayman.
787.62s:  No, Cayman Brake, the smaller Cayman Island, I had to go get a buddy from the airport there and we were figuring out because like they didn't have like Uber or Lyft at the time.
796.22s:  So we're like figuring out how we were going to get over there.
798.42s:  Literally we were sitting at a bar not drinking. We were grabbing lunch because it was like midday.
802.92s:  Literally the bar tender was just like, oh, just take my car.
808.12s:  Literally that's like that's what it was like on Cayman Brake and
812.82s:  at first that sounds crazy, right? It's like take your fucking car like who would who would offer that.
819.32s:  But then you also realize that there is literally nowhere to go Cayman Brake is tiny.
824.42s:  We rode around it on a bicycle.
826.22s:  So they have like a very home style feeling there.
830.92s:  And when I was in Jamaica, it wasn't quite like that.
834.02s:  The other place that I had that kind of experience was the Dominican Republic.
837.82s:  They because the other thing is when I travel to these places, I do not do the resort thing.
845.32s:  I'm very active.
846.62s:  So I like to rent a car everywhere I go.
848.72s:  I like to drive everywhere around where I go.
851.82s:  And in the DR, they I had to give them money so that they didn't take take my wallet.
859.22s:  And then in Mexico, they do that too, but in Mexico, they do that to everybody.
863.72s:  So yeah, there's a couple places that are like that that are a little more exploitive, I would say.
868.72s:  But I mean, the other thing is, I don't know, some people, especially from America,
872.32s:  we feel some type of way if you get extorted like that.
874.72s:  But for a lot of these other places, it's just like, it's annoying. Nobody likes it.
878.72s:  But it's just kind of like how a fucking goes, right?
880.92s:  So like if you have to pay a, like I had to pay the Mexican cops like 80 bucks.
884.92s:  And it like is what it is, right?
887.42s:  You just fucking pay them the 80 bucks and then you just keep going with your day.
891.22s:  And the funny part about that too was when I met up with the dive boat,
895.22s:  like the people I was diving with, that's when I was driving from, I was driving up to La Paz.
899.72s:  So it was like way up out there.
901.72s:  And it was so funny because we were coming up to a stop sign and the funniest story.
910.22s:  And then we'll get into growing kitty I promise.
912.22s:  But we were coming up to a stop sign.
915.22s:  And we were out in the middle again, like towards La Paz, not quite there yet.
919.62s:  So like there was nobody else there.
921.62s:  We were straight up the only white people.
924.12s:  And I don't blend in with Mexicans.
927.12s:  There are some lighter hair Mexicans, but everything about me doesn't say, you know, this guy's from here.
933.62s:  Obviously.
934.62s:  So we're coming up to the stop sign.
936.32s:  I literally can see a cop sitting on the other side of the stop sign.
940.82s:  And I look over to my passenger and I'm like, yo, nobody is stopping at the stop sign.
949.12s:  And I have this conversation.
951.12s:  I see a cop at the other side of the stop sign.
954.12s:  This is going to feel weird, but I am going to come to a complete stop at the stop sign because I can see the cop right there watching this stop sign.
962.12s:  Sure as fucking shit.
964.62s:  I come to a complete dead stop.
967.62s:  Do the count two seconds thing.
969.62s:  I start pulling off.
970.92s:  They pull us over and I don't speak Spanish well, but I can understand it.
974.92s:  Okay.
975.92s:  And he was he literally told me that I didn't stop at the stop sign.
980.42s:  And I literally just started laughing because he knew I stopped.
984.12s:  I knew I stopped, but I also knew what was going on.
986.82s:  I knew what time it was.
988.12s:  And I literally just asked him, I was like, want to play still like, how much is this going to be for me to not stop at the stop sign?
994.32s:  And he's he was funny about it.
996.82s:  He was just like, he's like, oh, he's like, you know, we just we just need to go get lunch.
1000.72s:  And I was just like, okay, I was like, you guys getting drinks with your lunch or is this just like a normal lunch?
1005.52s:  And he was like, he's like 200 bucks will do.
1007.52s:  And I was just like 200 bucks.
1010.22s:  I was like, no, what the fuck are you smoking?
1013.02s:  And I open up my wallet.
1014.32s:  I never keep all the money when I travel like in that will billfold.
1017.52s:  I squirrel most of it away.
1019.22s:  And I was just like, dog, I have 60 bucks.
1022.02s:  Well, that work.
1022.72s:  And he's like, if you if I had a password with me, he's like, if she is,
1027.12s:  she has another 20, we'll call it good.
1029.02s:  So we had a fucking pay these dudes 80 bucks.
1031.02s:  And then, you know, we kept driving.
1032.22s:  But the same token they had no tolls.
1034.82s:  So I guess you just kind of count that as a toll.
1037.62s:  It was so fucking funny.
1041.32s:  So yeah, learn a bunch of lessons there.
1044.52s:  Because in the DR, they try to take my driver's license.
1046.82s:  So I actually take an old driver's license.
1050.32s:  So that and I put that on the top because what they try to do to extort you is they'll say,
1055.12s:  they'll take your driver's license.
1056.52s:  They won't give it back to you.
1058.52s:  And then they'll say, bring me like follow me to the to the police station.
1063.52s:  That's what they try to do.
1064.32s:  They try to bring you to the police station.
1066.32s:  So it.
1069.82s:  I found it works really well.
1071.52s:  If you have essentially an old license or something that you don't care if they take
1075.52s:  and then you just drive to the fucking hotel because they won't fuck with you at the hotels
1079.12s:  because the hotels will stand up for you.
1082.12s:  Because they obviously are trying to get tourism and industry going there,
1086.32s:  which stuff like bribery really nukes because it's not super fun.
1090.42s:  Like I wouldn't go back to Jamaica at this point.
1092.92s:  I think it's a beautiful place.
1094.32s:  I liked it, but I didn't like all the fuck fuck games there.
1097.52s:  So Steele says, bro is laughing about getting robbed.
1100.52s:  Did he bucks dude, it's all life experience.
1103.02s:  Yeah, it was the the circumstance of that pullover was the funniest fucking thing
1108.42s:  because I had an entire conversation with my passenger about stopping.
1112.22s:  I came to the most obnoxious full stop you could possibly come to.
1116.62s:  And then the first thing he says to me is you didn't stop at that stop sign.
1121.02s:  It was I was just like it's pure comedy.
1124.32s:  It's pure fucking comedy.
1126.12s:  And I was just like, well, just fucking see how much it takes to get out of here.
1128.92s:  So I mean, that's also just getting used to the way that the world works, right?
1133.42s:  Because Westerners, the idea of like bribery is crazy, right?
1137.12s:  The idea of like trying to pay a cop off on the side of the road is like the fucking wild
1141.28s:  is thing on earth.
1143.08s:  But in a lot of the world, that's how these motherfuckers get down.
1147.02s:  It's how you move around.
1148.66s:  So you just kind of take it for what it is.
1151.06s:  And I mean, it's 80 bucks, right?
1152.66s:  Like we're okay.
1153.86s:  They didn't fucking bother us more than that.
1156.26s:  These are just some dudes trying to make some fucking money.
1158.26s:  I don't agree with that.
1159.26s:  I think it's fucked up.
1160.26s:  But what am I going to do, right?
1163.70s:  H has it the exact way, pay to play.
1165.90s:  You kind of know what you're doing when you're getting there and that's all good.
1168.78s:  You just fucking you, you now have a hilarious story to tell people because that is the
1176.48s:  that Lawrence says I've heard Russia is worse.
1178.58s:  Russia.
1179.58s:  Yeah, that that place you got to be super careful.
1181.46s:  I've never been there.
1182.46s:  So I can't say, but I've have friends that are from there and whatnot.
1185.26s:  And that's a different ballgame because yeah, they play, they play hard and they go hard
1190.02s:  in the paint.
1191.34s:  So yeah.
1193.34s:  All right.
1195.14s:  So should we start with diving into the trades or do you guys want to do a quick recap
1200.38s:  of GME activity last week?
1203.06s:  I am cool with either or we can start with whatever makes you happy.
1206.86s:  I was looking through, we got to 2021.
1210.82s:  So there's no way we're going to get through the rest of his trades today.
1213.22s:  I just don't see that happening.
1215.34s:  So I'm guessing this will probably be like a six part series give or take just because
1221.02s:  there's there really is so much with all these trades to to keep track of.
1228.22s:  Yeah, okay.
1229.22s:  So we'll.
1230.54s:  It looks like esoteric.
1231.54s:  You've been strongly outvoted and we're going to run through a quick recap.
1235.66s:  So let's let's get that going.
1239.50s:  So first and foremost, let's grab.
1242.34s:  GME.
1243.34s:  Okay.
1244.34s:  So there's a few things that I saw from a high level.
1246.86s:  I'm not going to go super far into detail on like price action and stuff like that because
1251.26s:  one, it is what it is to I did a video on Thursday that talks about some of that.
1256.34s:  So I don't want to waste too much of your time with that.
1260.10s:  If there's questions, obviously happy to answer.
1262.58s:  But from a general perspective, what I would highlight for you here is that GameStop clearly
1268.90s:  once the at the market concluded GameStop really started to find a little bit of strength.
1276.14s:  And here's a really, really important point to the strength that I see.
1280.74s:  If I show you the Russell, what do you notice different about GameStop versus Russell?
1288.38s:  And I'll make this a little easier to track here.
1291.18s:  So if I throw GameStop up top and then I throw Russell down here and then I'll change
1296.46s:  both of these to a three month daily to get a slightly better scale.
1300.06s:  What's the difference on the week that you notice there?
1302.66s:  Really important.
1305.50s:  And I'll explain why this is so important.
1307.62s:  But how do they do on the week comparatively?
1311.34s:  And the reason why I think this is so important to highlight for you is because when I look
1317.34s:  at H says inverse, there you go, they finally broke the correlation because for quite a while,
1325.10s:  when we look at GameStop, we can clearly see GameStop was actually struggling a little
1329.58s:  bit.
1330.58s:  And a big part of that I think was the larger small cap space coming under fire, just having
1337.58s:  pressure.
1338.58s:  Now with the post earnings drop and even still small caps are showing upward strength,
1348.54s:  a little bit of downward pullback, but still upward strength.
1351.26s:  But the relationship is now generally broken in a short term timeframe.
1356.58s:  Because if we go to like nine sixteen into the to the 19th, GameStop's going down while
1362.58s:  smalls are going up, then we have smalls from the 19th into the 25th going down, then
1368.70s:  we have GameStop going up.
1371.14s:  So this definitely looks like it was largely suppressed and then it starts rebounding back
1376.66s:  up and out.
1377.94s:  So we have to absolutely track the relationship between these because it helps us understand
1384.22s:  the perspective price movement for sure.
1387.50s:  Rowing titties here, everybody, big giant shout out to fan favorite, roaring tittie.
1392.34s:  Roing tittie says, do we get to talk any tinfoil later?
1395.18s:  You know I'm always down.
1396.18s:  I literally had my wife construct for me a tinfoil hat.
1401.62s:  So yeah, as soon as it's time to get into theories, I am so down.
1407.06s:  But from a price action standpoint, there's not really any theories here.
1410.54s:  This is unfortunately looking at boring cold hard data.
1413.42s:  That is what it is, right?
1414.42s:  Who likes that stuff?
1415.42s:  It's like, that's like the stuff for nerds.
1417.90s:  You know, it's like when I think about, when I think about the stuff that I like typically
1421.86s:  look at, I realize it's like no wonder why nobody likes this shit.
1424.90s:  I don't know why I do, but I do.
1427.82s:  So that's the first thing I see with respect to GameStop and its behavior around the indices,
1437.58s:  which is very important to flag.
1441.58s:  Okay, cool.
1442.58s:  That point's been made.
1444.38s:  Now let's go back and take a look at a couple other things that I want to flag for GameStop
1449.10s:  specifically.
1450.62s:  The first thing is I'm seeing volume tailor off, but not drop entirely.
1458.38s:  That's another exceedingly important point right now.
1462.38s:  So if I go into this space in here, right?
1465.82s:  So this space being pretty much anything from the 5th of August into earnings almost.
1473.98s:  I can see overall volume is very, very, very, right?
1481.34s:  So I can see volume here is 6.5, 6.5, 4.3, 5.3.5, 3.5, 3.1, 3.3, 4.4, 4.7, so on and
1491.02s:  so forth.
1492.02s:  So we're talking like sub five almost this entire time.
1496.34s:  Then we get in here, we have on the 20th, 62 million shares transact.
1503.38s:  That drops to 13.9, 12.1, 6.15, 5.7, and then takes back up to 7.4.
1514.90s:  So when we look at this volume activity, it's showing me a different structure, a different
1521.98s:  behavior pattern than what I see here, and then also even from what I see in here.
1527.66s:  And as always, I am a data driven trader.
1532.38s:  I'm going to look for other cues, symbols, pieces of information to help me construct
1538.30s:  the broader thesis of what I think may or may not be going on.
1542.54s:  But what I can objectively say is that it is not supremely quiet still.
1548.34s:  It is below average volume periods that is not surprising at all.
1554.38s:  I'm looking at relative volume for five and 20 day periods.
1559.50s:  And there's no shock.
1561.34s:  The reason why there's no shock is because there's going to be a massive spike in volume
1566.02s:  around earnings.
1567.66s:  That's super normal.
1569.02s:  Then we have the at the market that obviously is going to contribute to some of this.
1573.62s:  And then we have the post at the market that obviously is going to contribute to some
1577.02s:  of the compression being relieved.
1579.34s:  So now when I look at this, I still see elevated volume and I'm very curious to see where it
1586.38s:  goes.
1587.38s:  So Sam Cleman says, what's your price target for your long shares?
1592.10s:  I don't have one.
1593.54s:  It's because I'm not really trading the long shares.
1596.46s:  The long shares I've told you guys this a while ago.
1599.42s:  The long shares that I have on, it's literally just to show some love to the ape community
1604.62s:  and to move in solidarity with you all.
1607.00s:  There's another one that I already told you.
1609.04s:  I also have shares in AMC.
1610.92s:  And that's again, from a bet that I made on a live stream, literally I think like three
1615.06s:  years ago or some shit.
1616.80s:  So for something like, for the GameStop shares, the AMC shares, it's no target.
1622.48s:  It's literally just shit that I'm holding to show some love.
1625.56s:  Now in terms of like the trading though, because for me, I trade GameStop with options.
1630.12s:  I trade most things with options because that's my bread and butter.
1633.60s:  And I like the way I can construct trades.
1636.84s:  But right now I am in no specific fashion to do anything with options.
1644.72s:  I traded a little bit of this breakout that I immediately flattened the next day and
1650.36s:  the reason and I didn't even catch most of this breakout.
1653.12s:  I essentially got into on the 20th.
1655.72s:  I just jumped in when it was breaking above this kind of this volume profile right here,
1661.60s:  this node.
1662.60s:  So it's like when it was at 20 and a half.
1664.36s:  And then I got out when it was like 2190, right?
1667.16s:  So it's like a point and a half move.
1669.36s:  It really was nothing to write home about.
1671.24s:  But it's just to essentially gain a little bit of exposure to the movement because I do
1678.16s:  know that it tends to exhibit some follow through.
1681.20s:  But right now I'm still just trading primarily short calls against the long shares, which I
1685.36s:  know some people don't like that.
1686.80s:  But I'm not going to not say it because it's what I'm doing and I'm going to always keep
1691.88s:  it a buck with you guys.
1693.00s:  So yeah, don't say that because I want games stop to go down or anything like that.
1697.16s:  But it's because I'm a fucking trader.
1700.00s:  So that's the way that I'm built.
1703.20s:  So yeah, that's the main thing that I'm doing right now.
1706.64s:  But yeah, really no price target just yet.
1708.96s:  The one thing I will flag as well is that we are now firmly into this point of control.
1715.40s:  And the reason why I think it's important to highlight this point of control is because
1718.88s:  it's actually quite persistent across a few different time frames.
1723.64s:  So that tells me that there are a lot of transactions happening right around this handle.
1728.52s:  So we have one point of control on the short term time frame.
1731.04s:  It's really difficult to see, but there it comes out to here.
1734.96s:  So that means that there's a lot of volume at that price handle being the 22 handle.
1739.92s:  And then the next point of control above that is literally right up here around the 25
1743.36s:  handle.
1744.36s:  So there's a ton, a ton of people interested in transacting at these levels.
1748.52s:  Again, you have seen I've not drawn any new lines on this for a really long time.
1753.76s:  These are the same lines in terms of support resistance lines as far as I see it.
1758.56s:  These I actually can take off for the time being because these don't really matter.
1761.52s:  These are all built off of that squeeze.
1764.20s:  But I am not drawing any sort of news support resistance.
1768.08s:  I've kept these the same.
1769.72s:  This one realistically is going back further.
1771.88s:  I actually would keep that one closer to there.
1775.12s:  So I think we can modify that one.
1777.20s:  And I think this represents more or less what I see here.
1781.12s:  So yeah.
1783.88s:  Roindt Cleese says, did you DRS your shares?
1785.92s:  I didn't.
1786.92s:  It's just held through the brokerage.
1789.24s:  I do have them turned off for for loaning, but I don't have them.
1793.72s:  And the main reason is because it's kind of an annoying process to go through just again,
1800.08s:  keeping it a buck with you.
1802.56s:  So I keep everything within within the same brokerage platform.
1805.88s:  So yeah.
1806.88s:  Roindt, he says he doesn't realize he's one of us.
1810.76s:  I really appreciate that, but I continue to remind you guys.
1813.88s:  I don't like the idea of like considering myself in ape because I'm still relatively new
1820.68s:  to this.
1822.64s:  Most of you have been along most of my journey with this and I started paying attention
1826.40s:  to like the story, the background primarily from I would call it may is when I
1832.48s:  started getting more into it.
1834.48s:  So I still feel like I'm too new to it.
1837.44s:  So it doesn't feel right to like because I have a lot of respect for the people that have
1841.96s:  been following this for a long time.
1843.72s:  Like every time that I talk to somebody like Newton who's been following this thing as
1849.04s:  close as he has, like I obviously would completely consider him in ape and I think he's
1853.48s:  like deserved the title, so to speak.
1856.48s:  But that's the that's the thing.
1859.28s:  I don't know.
1860.28s:  I feel weird about trying to take a title that I don't necessarily feel like I deserve
1864.84s:  or that I've earned yet.
1866.16s:  Not that it's like, you know, this big prestigious thing, but a lot of it comes from my time in
1869.60s:  the military, right?
1870.60s:  Like we we want to earn whatever it is.
1874.64s:  That's a big part of the psyche.
1876.68s:  So I definitely am doing my best to like learn about the story, learn about the background.
1881.00s:  I still literally text with Newton almost every single day to bounce ideas around and to
1885.96s:  learn a little bit more.
1887.68s:  But yeah, I still feel like I haven't put in the time yet because there have been people
1893.00s:  in this thing for four fucking years.
1895.40s:  Well, three three and change, which is a long time, man.
1898.92s:  So I still consider myself a bit more of a guest.
1903.44s:  And it's again, it's more just out of respect than anything.
1906.24s:  So yeah.
1909.24s:  Um, generational capital says, do you sell covered calls?
1913.84s:  Not covered.
1914.84s:  I essentially will never sell covered calls.
1917.28s:  But I always sell calls at a ratio.
1920.52s:  So yeah, I really like ratio covered calls, but that's essentially what I have on now and
1926.88s:  game stop.
1927.96s:  And the reason why I do that is because I don't want to cap my upside.
1931.68s:  And I'll walk you through again for anybody that's not seen it.
1934.92s:  I'll always show you this because I think it's super, super important.
1940.76s:  Um, here.
1945.48s:  So if I have, let's say, for example, again, this is using my IRA pass through accounts.
1951.20s:  There's no money in it.
1952.20s:  It's just blank.
1953.36s:  This is also going to be regulation T. So, but let's say if I have 25,000 shares of game
1964.40s:  stop and I'm not going to get rid of these other positions because most of these are the
1970.36s:  cats, which I'm going to have to go back through.
1975.24s:  This was an example that I did recently so I can kill these two.
1979.20s:  So let's say that there's 25,000 shares and let's say the basis is like 19.
1983.84s:  Now in the trade right now, it's up 86 grand or whatever.
1988.16s:  Cool.
1989.16s:  Now, here's the problem.
1992.04s:  When if I come in here and I sell calls against it.
1998.88s:  And you'll notice something as I click this button more and more times, you're going to
2004.16s:  see that that right hand side is going to move further and further down.
2008.96s:  So if I kind of fast forward our time a little bit and pretend that this is at a one to
2013.16s:  one ratio.
2014.16s:  So if I have 25,000 long shares and I sell 250 calls against it, which represents the
2019.16s:  same size, you'll notice a really, really problem, like a big problem.
2025.40s:  And it's specifically that the, like we lose our upside profit potential, which I have
2031.08s:  no interest in doing that.
2033.04s:  Even though I really have no real game plan to sell the shares again, I've already told
2037.28s:  you that just being completely honest, it's still just anti the way that I trade.
2041.72s:  So I'm still going to generally apply the same fundamentals that I would.
2047.00s:  So in this kind of instance, when I look at something like this instead of doing like
2052.60s:  250, if I sell something like 100 calls, well, you'll notice that I get plenty of upside
2058.40s:  potential still.
2059.40s:  I'm not giving up a ton of upside, but then I can still collect a fairly meaningful amount
2065.84s:  of premium against those options.
2068.32s:  So that's the general idea here.
2071.60s:  It allows for a little bit of income generation or just taking in premium when things were
2078.80s:  going sideways.
2079.96s:  It helps generate some profit, but I wouldn't want to give up upside, essentially ever.
2087.12s:  And because here's why this is the entire reason why if we look at this position, guess what?
2096.12s:  We now have capped profit potential, right?
2098.88s:  We know how much we can make right from the jump.
2100.84s:  We are stuck at $138,000 fine.
2105.16s:  Here's the issue.
2107.00s:  If we look to the left hand side, we are still taking on the entire downside risk profile,
2116.76s:  the entire downside risk profile.
2119.44s:  So what I'm doing is I'm taking the downside risk, but I don't get the profit potential.
2124.76s:  I don't like that.
2125.76s:  And it's exactly why I don't typically mess with covered calls at all in anything I trade.
2131.72s:  It will always be at a ratio and that so that I can appreciate to the upside.
2138.48s:  It's a big part.
2146.36s:  And it says, that's what I put say that's hilarious.
2150.36s:  Steele says, don't worry, you're a GME enthusiast is new and would say, yeah, I think that that's
2154.08s:  completely fair.
2155.08s:  I am absolutely a giant enthusiast of GME.
2158.44s:  The entire, I've told you guys this a million times and I'm always happy to say it again
2161.44s:  because it's so fucking cool.
2163.24s:  But I've been trading a long time, right?
2165.28s:  Like I'm coming up on my 17th year of trading and trading has changed my life.
2169.16s:  It's why I do the whole YouTube thing.
2170.56s:  It's not because I belong on a camera.
2172.60s:  But this is such a curious story, everything about it.
2178.16s:  And that's why again, if you'll notice at the beginning of the stream when I was talking
2181.04s:  about the cat, I am beyond infatuated with the way that he does things because it is so
2188.28s:  anomalous.
2190.12s:  So it's like I'm looking at something like if I'm looking at nature, that's what this
2194.56s:  feels like.
2195.56s:  I'm looking at nature being the stock market.
2197.40s:  And I'm seeing something that doesn't fit in with anything I've ever seen before.
2201.92s:  So I can't help but keep looking at it because it's so strange, absolutely super, super
2208.88s:  strange.
2210.04s:  So yeah, I think that's a great way to, I think that's a great way to frame it.
2217.72s:  Of Roryntiti says, why do you think so many people haven't left GME?
2220.80s:  It's not only the squeeze, it's the story definitely.
2223.20s:  And that's one of the things I love about the apes.
2225.32s:  I learn a lot from you guys.
2226.96s:  That's one of the, that's, it's one of the very neat things about this is that what you'll
2232.24s:  find is there's a lot of things that I think apes generally lack knowledge of and that's
2237.32s:  not to throw shade, but it is what it is.
2241.60s:  But there's a lot of very interesting things that apes know an insane amount about.
2249.24s:  And I get a chance to tap into some of those things over time, which is actually really,
2253.04s:  really fun for me.
2254.04s:  I'm a big fan.
2257.36s:  Willie says thoughts on GME maintaining price above 19 post two sizable dilutions demand.
2264.20s:  That's exactly what that tells me.
2265.72s:  And I talked about this before, even when it started catching on this thread down here,
2272.20s:  the fact that it dropped down to these levels and then continued to get bit up, it tells
2277.24s:  me that people do absolutely value this thing at a certain level.
2282.80s:  And this is before even when they did that first offering.
2287.12s:  I think one of the biggest things about the first offering is that provided a absolute
2295.28s:  exit for a lot of systemically short positions that were able to now access shares relatively
2303.08s:  easily.
2304.88s:  And that gave them a big out.
2307.80s:  But before that, this was being systemically shorted massively.
2312.36s:  So the fact that in those conditions, it didn't get bit down heavily.
2317.24s:  It tells me that there's demand for those shares.
2320.12s:  So yeah, I think without a doubt, the fact that this is continued to hold these handles
2325.84s:  is really, really important because it starts alluding to what the intrinsic value of the
2332.68s:  stock might be perceived to be, which is not to be confused with whatever we try to
2337.64s:  calculate.
2338.64s:  It's cash value at people.
2341.12s:  People obviously still value the brand, the intellectual property, which is a really
2347.04s:  important thing to see that it's not simply being valued at cash.
2352.60s:  So yeah, for sure, for sure.
2357.96s:  Dr. Zays says you may be a rookie, but you're like a top five draft pick.
2361.76s:  Yeah, I am a rookie.
2363.16s:  I've been looking at again, it's been what?
2365.08s:  Like four months.
2366.08s:  I'm very, very new to this.
2368.16s:  So Christian says guest ape.
2370.44s:  Yeah, I think I do view myself as a guest.
2373.64s:  I think that that's fair.
2377.16s:  Sam says any of y'all watch Jackie to between him, Richard and this, the different perspectives
2383.12s:  are fascinating.
2384.12s:  Got it.
2385.12s:  I don't know anything about Jackie.
2387.04s:  I've heard some of you mentioned him before, but this goes back to the other thing is like
2392.68s:  I, and I talked about this on my standard YouTube channel videos and live streams and stuff.
2397.76s:  Like I don't watch anybody shit because I just kind of do my own thing.
2402.24s:  I think the main thing is with somebody like Newton, because I don't really catch all
2407.12s:  of his videos either, but I'll talk with him.
2410.64s:  And the thing with Newton is like he was unbelievably, unbelievably gracious and useful for me.
2420.72s:  Like when I'm developing my background understanding of things and like understanding the qualitative
2425.32s:  components that I'm not so sure about.
2430.64s:  But yeah, I don't really watch much of anything because most of the time I spend the vast majority
2438.40s:  of the time like doing what I consider doing work.
2442.76s:  Like I like to go in, look at things for myself.
2446.28s:  And even when I have conversations with somebody like Newton, the main thing with him is he
2451.72s:  has a lot of background information, but I still like to go in and validate what I'm seeing.
2457.60s:  And it's just because I understand how humans perceive things.
2462.12s:  And again, it's because I've been trading for a long time.
2464.24s:  I understand all these different cognitive biases, confirmation biases, availability
2467.92s:  biases, all of these different kinds of things that kind of paint the way that we perceive
2472.56s:  information, which I guard so heavily against because my entire objective as a trader to
2479.56s:  be is as objective as humanly possible in the analysis of things.
2486.24s:  So yeah, I spend so much time doing that personally, but I think that for anybody that watches
2492.72s:  stuff, obviously I would always 100% recommend Newton.
2496.72s:  Like Newton, I think you cannot go wrong with because he has so much qualitative background.
2503.68s:  From a trading perspective, like I don't trade the way he does.
2506.48s:  I can tell you that for sure.
2508.92s:  But with like the trading element aside, the amount of information that he has and he's
2515.68s:  taken the time to build around this thing is like just straight up second to none.
2520.84s:  I haven't met many other people that have the background that he does.
2526.44s:  So yeah, I am, I literally am a massive fan of Newton.
2531.28s:  And anytime anybody asks me about GameStop, I literally always direct them to him because
2537.00s:  he's the dude.
2538.32s:  The thing when it comes to like looking at, when it comes to looking at, again, GameStop,
2545.28s:  I would trust my eyes analyzing the stock and analyzing the options and analyzing the movement
2551.24s:  over anybody else.
2552.24s:  And that's not to say that, you know, I'm better than anybody else.
2555.00s:  It's just I trust my eyes.
2556.20s:  I trust my experience.
2558.08s:  But when it comes to taking a look at the breadth of the story, how things have evolved,
2565.76s:  the characters, I literally called Newton the GME scribe because he is straight up the
2574.88s:  the scribe that has tracked just about everything about this.
2579.40s:  So yeah.
2583.76s:  Dr. Zayas says need to have balanced views.
2586.56s:  Yeah.
2587.56s:  And I think that that's one of my favorite things about, that's one of my favorite things
2592.64s:  about Newton is even when he and I before before he started getting back to work and he's,
2597.12s:  you know, like super busy now.
2599.28s:  But before he started getting back to work and all that, when we did a few live streams
2602.64s:  together, you can see that he and I very frequently would go back and forth, right?
2609.12s:  Because we have no problem challenging one another's thoughts.
2612.00s:  And it's obviously out of nothing but deep respect in trying to understand.
2617.00s:  And I gather that from him from the jump.
2619.92s:  And I both are literally seeking to understand.
2624.60s:  And I cannot tell you how much I identify with that because I genuinely do not care very
2631.56s:  much about whether or not I'm categorically right or wrong.
2635.40s:  I care about the assumption of information and data.
2640.52s:  And that's what I care about.
2642.32s:  If I have, there's a saying I use all the time, strong convictions loosely held.
2646.80s:  I say that in my trading community all the time.
2649.60s:  And it's because I think we develop strong convictions by doing a bunch of research.
2653.84s:  We have really well formulated ideas.
2656.48s:  They're loosely held in that as soon as there's good information that contradicts or sends
2662.32s:  us down a different path, I will dump the previous thing that I thought and held in high
2667.56s:  regard like a fucking rock to pick up the new thing if they're supporting data.
2673.48s:  And that's part of why I think I've been successful as a trader is because I have no problem
2679.52s:  abandoning things because I'm not attaching my identity to these different ideas.
2685.32s:  The way I look at it is I'm analyzing information.
2688.40s:  I'm coming up with the best possible assumption I can with this information at a given point
2692.16s:  in time.
2693.36s:  And as soon as it changes, I need to change period.
2696.08s:  It's not a representation of who I am.
2698.32s:  And as much as financial media and social media, as soon as you flip an idea, most people
2705.16s:  like, oh my god, he's wishy-washy.
2707.44s:  And to me, I'm thinking what a dumb way to look at that.
2713.60s:  Of course, if it comes to things like values, values need to stay adhered to even when
2718.56s:  it's inconvenient and stuff.
2719.96s:  That's a completely different conversation.
2721.32s:  But when it comes to, I have hypothesis about where something might go or the current
2725.72s:  breadth of information, what that indicates.
2728.64s:  I'd drop it like a rock as soon as there's better information available.
2733.04s:  Zero, literally zero attachment to it.
2737.84s:  Strong convictions loosely held.
2739.44s:  I think that's the way.
2742.08s:  Dr. Zayas says, can you give an example of a conviction that you like go of?
2745.80s:  Absolutely.
2746.80s:  Easy.
2747.80s:  The trading of vertical spreads.
2750.28s:  The first several years that I traded options, we talked about this yesterday during the
2754.20s:  beginner livestream.
2755.76s:  The first several years that I traded options, I used vertical spreads.
2759.80s:  And it's because they balance a lot of things.
2762.80s:  They're reduced risk because they have capped risk and profit.
2768.12s:  But you can, they're super capital efficient.
2770.24s:  You can put a lot of them on and you can create really good probabilistic outcomes where
2774.96s:  you win a lot.
2776.12s:  I thought for sure, vertical spreads were the way.
2780.56s:  And I traded them a lot under that premise.
2784.36s:  Then I started taking a really close look at the overall trading performance of the systems.
2789.84s:  And I was noticing as I started logging a little bit into my trading career, I was looking
2794.64s:  at it and saying, I feel like I'm crushing it with vertical spreads.
2800.60s:  And the reason why I felt that way is because I would win a lot because there are high probability
2805.40s:  trades.
2806.56s:  But for any of the options traders out there, you know there's a giant downside to them.
2812.36s:  And it's that typically, let's look at an example together really quick.
2816.32s:  We could look in GameStop.
2817.92s:  If I do a $1 wide vertical spread and typically you'll get something close to 30 cents for
2824.16s:  that.
2826.08s:  The issue here is I'm collecting $30, but I'm risking $70.
2836.00s:  So do the math.
2838.24s:  I need more than two wins to overcome every single one loss.
2845.20s:  So even though I feel like I'm winning all the time because I am, it doesn't fucking
2850.96s:  matter.
2851.96s:  Because when I have a handful of losing trades, it wipes out 2.3 times plus my winning
2859.16s:  trades, not including fees.
2861.60s:  So as soon as I started taking a really hard look at that, realizing that, yeah, okay,
2865.68s:  verticals, they have a place.
2867.68s:  But I was literally like flat.
2870.68s:  I think I was up a little bit money with them at the end of like several years of trading
2874.36s:  them.
2875.36s:  I was like, this is fucking trash.
2877.40s:  So I had been trading them for several years.
2880.00s:  And then I literally pivoted.
2881.68s:  It was over a weekend and I just stopped trading them entirely.
2885.52s:  So that is an example for Dr. Zayas.
2890.88s:  Can you give an example of a conviction that you like go of?
2893.44s:  That's a massive one for me because I spent a lot of time fucking with those and it just
2899.88s:  wasn't really worth the time or effort.
2903.80s:  Oh, we have a New Zealander fleet haul.
2908.56s:  Let's see, let's see if we have New Zealand.
2912.88s:  New Zealand.
2916.48s:  We don't.
2917.48s:  Let's get the right spot then.
2919.64s:  Christ church.
2920.64s:  Damn, that's like, no fucking, electric there, huh?
2925.40s:  Christ church.
2927.68s:  Like, damn.
2929.72s:  Like real specific and sweet.
2935.36s:  So now we have New Zealand.
2936.36s:  That's fantastic.
2939.60s:  Fleet haul, if you can, whenever you get around to it, find us somebody from Papa New Guinea,
2945.16s:  would you?
2946.16s:  Because they're like pretty fucking close and I feel like you can make that happen.
2950.60s:  And then also it wouldn't hurt for Tasmania.
2953.64s:  If we can get like a lemur or some shit, that would be kind of cool.
2957.76s:  And then we got Bangkok Thailand.
2962.04s:  Is it good to have a Bangkokian?
2966.68s:  That's beautiful.
2968.44s:  Okay.
2970.60s:  Over there.
2975.88s:  Um, MFN says, do you think the GME option positioning Friday could lead to a ditty party type
2986.24s:  action next week?
2988.36s:  So we're going to have to, we're going to have to really get into the ditty party classification
2994.60s:  so that I'm on the same page as you.
2996.84s:  Are we inferring that there's going to be a lot of like roofies and then un really unrequested
3004.80s:  homosexual activity that's like one directional?
3009.52s:  Or are we talking about something where there's just like a lot of, are we talking about
3014.16s:  the P. Diddy parties before or after midnight?
3018.04s:  Maybe that's the way to, maybe that's what I need to say.
3021.00s:  So is it, yeah, is it going to be pre midnight ditty party or post midnight ditty party?
3029.44s:  Because I think that will be the primary differentiator of how we might classify.
3037.32s:  Because I could see GameStop, GameStop price action being something like, you know, pre
3044.28s:  midnight ditty, but I do think it becomes a little more dangerous if we're kind of forecasting
3051.08s:  post midnight ditty party because then that means like shorts are getting fucked pretty
3055.36s:  bad.
3056.56s:  And I don't know if I see the conditions for that at least as of right now who knows it
3061.04s:  can always happen.
3062.64s:  But I don't see that amount of baby oil in the options as it sits.
3068.16s:  So yeah, I think I could see pre midnight, a little bit of action, some surprise, some
3078.96s:  half advances.
3082.08s:  I think we could see the really awkward moment where you bring like your hot girlfriend
3086.36s:  or your wife and you think ditty is trying to take your girl, but then you realize like
3091.72s:  ditty is trying to take you, right?
3094.08s:  That's like a different kind of fear.
3095.68s:  I think that would be part of that pre midnight thing.
3099.72s:  And then I think the post midnight is when the doors are locked and you're trying to find
3107.12s:  a fucking window to get out and ditty now has baby oil everywhere that I don't think we're
3113.28s:  at that point yet.
3114.52s:  I think the shorts felt that previously, but I don't know if they're going to be quite
3119.20s:  at that point in the near future.
3121.68s:  So yeah, Roryntady says he did some horrible shit to women.
3126.76s:  He did.
3127.76s:  He beat the shit out of that one woman.
3129.52s:  I saw it.
3130.52s:  I think it was him in the lobby of the hotel.
3133.84s:  I'm absolutely not saying that he yes, yes.
3138.32s:  I think the main thing I'm just highlighting is that it's a strange, it's a strange happen
3144.24s:  stance when most guys are slightly insecure.
3149.64s:  You have a really hot wife or something or a girlfriend typically because it's not
3153.28s:  that committed yet and you're like, yo, I want to show my girlfriend off.
3157.28s:  But it's like, you know, all these guys are like trying to hit on her.
3159.80s:  That gets a little old.
3161.80s:  And I think that moment that you realize that like ditty actually isn't interested in
3167.80s:  the girlfriend is like more interested in you.
3170.64s:  I think that's terrifying because then it's it almost primes your brain where it's like,
3174.64s:  wait a minute, like maybe like my girlfriend, right?
3178.04s:  I almost would prefer that that is really a masculine insecure.
3182.00s:  But I think the process of like ditty targeting me would be like real terrifying.
3189.68s:  So yeah, I mean, he felt comfortable.
3192.92s:  I saw a clip where he was like touching Mike Tyson's leg.
3197.44s:  That's a different level of comfort.
3200.40s:  Like completely a very different level of comfort.
3204.56s:  And then Mike Tyson like moved his hand and ditty didn't even, he didn't care.
3213.44s:  So it's like, that's a that's a different level of comfort, I would say.
3219.08s:  Yeah.
3222.08s:  So yeah, let me know if that answers the question because I wanted to make sure that we got
3226.88s:  to the bottom.
3227.88s:  I always want to seek first to understand, to understand again, the quality that we were
3232.52s:  referring to.
3233.52s:  And then I think we're there.
3236.20s:  James says, when you say you sell calls out a ratio, what does that mean?
3240.52s:  I gave an example.
3244.72s:  What?
3246.36s:  James, I gave literally a straight up example.
3252.96s:  Did you not see the example?
3255.20s:  James, we did this.
3256.60s:  Don't do this to me.
3258.20s:  James, you bastard.
3262.00s:  I'll show you.
3263.00s:  I'll show you just because I'm a nice guy.
3267.36s:  So in short, the way that the ratio would work is we would have a certain number of shares.
3274.76s:  And then when we sell a call against those shares, we would sell less calls than the number
3280.72s:  of shares we have is all.
3283.12s:  So the way to think about it is essentially you just need over 100 shares.
3290.80s:  Because the fewest number of calls you can sell is one, right?
3295.44s:  You can't sell a half a call.
3297.96s:  And each one short call represents up to 100 shares of the underlying.
3306.56s:  So in that context, as long as I have literally 101 share, I now have unlimited profit potential.
3314.20s:  Now obviously, in this case, I would have 100 of the shares covered in only one uncovered
3320.76s:  share.
3321.76s:  So it's not really what I would want.
3324.60s:  Right?
3325.60s:  So ideally, it would be at least something like 150 shares.
3329.16s:  So now you have 100 shares that are covered.
3331.36s:  And then you have 50 shares that are uncovered.
3333.52s:  But the idea in general is to strike a balance depending on what you want to see happen.
3342.00s:  But most of the time, like in this example, I wouldn't sell a call against it unless I
3347.16s:  had something like at least 500 shares.
3350.08s:  Because the main thing is I don't want to sacrifice the profit potential.
3354.28s:  So I want to sell calls at a very light ratio against the longs, maybe one, maybe two,
3361.20s:  here definitely no more than two.
3363.28s:  So yeah, the idea is to try to make sure you're not capping your upside and you give yourself
3369.00s:  the biggest ability to take advantage of the upside when it happens.
3372.40s:  So that goes back into having like a really, really solid plan about how you're going
3378.08s:  to manage the trade as it gets there.
3381.84s:  Because that's one of the things I actually have a video coming out next week and next
3385.24s:  Saturday that's about trading meme stocks with options.
3390.08s:  And I've made a couple videos really geared more so more so towards the ape community
3395.72s:  to try to help frame using derivatives in order to make like better trade decisions.
3402.28s:  So yeah, that video will come out and it'll talk about some of these things, but a big
3406.26s:  part is having a solid exit plan, which I actually think the majority that I find of
3414.60s:  apes, they actually tend to not, which always breaks my heart to a degree because the reason
3420.64s:  why it breaks my heart is like you don't make any money without an exit plan.
3424.08s:  Like if there's not a way to book profit, then the only thing we do is watch something
3429.44s:  in show profit and then profit goes away.
3432.80s:  And then it was there, but now it's gone with nothing really to show for it.
3438.08s:  So yeah, it's always a little bit of a bummer when I see that.
3445.52s:  H says what's an exit strategy is an arcade quote.
3451.40s:  Yeah, we saw that actually in here when we were looking at this stuff, we saw him say
3456.36s:  that.
3457.36s:  Again, the problem there is that he has an exit strategy and he's used it a lot because
3462.64s:  you like I can see him building the account by booking wins.
3467.36s:  So he absolutely has an exit strategy.
3470.60s:  There's absolutely no literally no debate about it.
3473.76s:  He joked as if he doesn't because I would make the same exact joke just like I would
3478.52s:  make the joke of no matter what I do, the stock market does the opposite.
3483.96s:  That's obviously not the case, right?
3485.96s:  Because I'm fortunate I make a good bit of money trading.
3489.32s:  So it's like I make that joke because it's funny, but it doesn't actually represent what
3494.40s:  I'm doing is the same thing here.
3496.60s:  Like him joking that he doesn't have an exit plan is literally just a troll comment because
3500.32s:  he's having fun with people, I think.
3505.04s:  Sedrick says with options, you have to shares is different.
3508.12s:  It's not like it's not different.
3510.72s:  That's the problem is when we look at let's take a look at this together really quick.
3515.92s:  If and we'll go into on demand, we'll start getting a set up to go through the catch
3520.28s:  trades because we're here.
3522.00s:  So let's go back to 2021 and we need to be in February.
3527.80s:  And it looks like February is his first update.
3530.44s:  So we'll go somewhere around here and I'll show you.
3537.36s:  So with GameStop, if you, I don't know what it's doing here.
3546.68s:  I don't know if this is actually what happened if it actually went to this or if this is just
3553.16s:  on demand.
3554.16s:  Did it actually do this on the first of Feb?
3556.80s:  Is that right?
3559.40s:  The crazy part is is I don't know.
3560.92s:  Yeah, so it looks like it did.
3561.92s:  It looks like the last price was $225.
3563.80s:  So it looks like it actually did do this, which is fucking nuts.
3567.56s:  So yeah, so here, for example, this is a hilariously well timed example.
3574.96s:  But first thing I want to show you, the very first thing I want to show you is the same
3578.96s:  thing I see every single time before squeeze every single time.
3586.96s:  I've looked at all of them.
3589.36s:  Volume is up massively, not trivially.
3593.20s:  But a little bit volume is up when I'm trading the movements in GameStop.
3599.20s:  This is what I look at because I will always reiterate this point.
3604.88s:  GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis.
3611.40s:  Of course it does to a degree.
3613.36s:  I want to be very clear.
3614.36s:  That doesn't mean that like your standard rules apply not at all, right?
3619.20s:  Most people I notice when I say things, they take the null, meaning the inverse, but I
3623.68s:  don't often mean the inverse.
3625.28s:  I mean a middle ground.
3627.12s:  So what I mean by that is for something like GameStop, let's say before this price move
3633.04s:  and started happening, I had support or resistance flagged at 3850 for whatever reason.
3640.76s:  A lot of times other stocks that move more normally will hit a line of resistance, can
3649.60s:  always go through it.
3651.20s:  But it'll typically bounce around it for a little bit until we see if demand or supply is
3656.52s:  going to win out.
3657.72s:  If demand does, it'll go back up through.
3660.04s:  But there's normally a little bit of contention.
3662.16s:  And I can show you that in just about every other stock, other than things that are primed
3666.24s:  for squeezes.
3667.72s:  The problem when you're looking at something that is essentially squeeze prone like this,
3672.76s:  is it's a completely different rule set.
3675.00s:  And I've talked to you all about this now because I started kind of looking at the overall
3681.24s:  amount of analysis that I've done, right?
3683.28s:  Because I typically quantify things.
3685.24s:  I want to know what I'm doing.
3686.64s:  Even with like the herniated disc bullshit that I have, I started looking at it and I've
3690.40s:  like 34 hours of research just into reading books, studies, podcasts, learning about the
3695.76s:  back because right now I've a fucking up herniated disc that I'm learning about.
3701.12s:  So with GameStop, it's literally light years past that at this point, right?
3705.68s:  Like it's hundreds of hours that I've spent looking at it, studying not just GameStop,
3711.24s:  but squeezes, the behavior of squeezes.
3714.08s:  And it does not, it does not attribute well to standard technical analysis.
3719.88s:  Like if somebody drew a Fibonacci extension on this, I literally couldn't care less.
3725.72s:  I couldn't possibly care less.
3729.08s:  It doesn't, it doesn't mean anything here.
3731.76s:  If it gives a trader ideas and it's useful to them, beautiful.
3735.72s:  I love that.
3736.72s:  Do whatever works for you.
3738.16s:  But what I can tell you is that as soon as there's some sort of condition that causes
3743.40s:  a movement of price, fuck your Fibonacci's.
3747.60s:  Fuck the resistance that you think is there.
3750.08s:  Right now in this case, GameStop is up at 322.
3754.32s:  That is not because the structural business, the valuation of GameStop has now changed.
3761.44s:  And it's at 322 because of that.
3764.36s:  It happened specifically because of structural constraints that break standard price rule
3772.12s:  sets.
3773.48s:  So that's why when you're doing things like technical analysis in something like GameStop,
3779.24s:  you have to pay attention to the profit mechanisms in the signals that correspond with the
3785.20s:  profit mechanism.
3786.20s:  In this case of a squeeze, they are highly unique.
3790.32s:  They exhibit defined behavior that I've already quantified for you to a degree.
3795.48s:  The video that's going to come out actually next weekend goes into way more of the quantifiable
3800.28s:  behaviors.
3801.40s:  But the punch line is when you're looking at something like this, you have to understand
3806.24s:  how it behaves and then tailor your analysis to how it behaves.
3812.00s:  And again, one of the things I can definitively tell you, most people know that I don't speak
3817.76s:  in absolutes.
3819.24s:  But this is an absolute before every single squeeze I've seen with GameStop before the
3826.06s:  squeeze happens, there is a massive expansion and volume every single time.
3833.96s:  Now that does not mean, again, don't take the know of what I'm saying to infer that
3840.36s:  every single time there's an expansion and volume, it equals a squeeze because it does
3846.00s:  not, right?
3847.00s:  I can show you right here.
3849.20s:  Volume here at this point went from 50 mil to 127 mil.
3854.20s:  There was no squeeze here.
3855.76s:  I can show you another time back here.
3857.40s:  Volume went from 13.2 mil to 305 mil.
3861.72s:  There was no squeeze here.
3864.32s:  So it does not mean every time you see a massive expansion in volume, it equals a squeeze.
3871.88s:  But I can tell you before every single squeeze, there is an expansion and volume.
3879.12s:  Really important trait to be aware of.
3884.44s:  Because when I'm structuring trades, that's the exact kind of thing I'm personally looking
3889.56s:  for.
3891.32s:  It gives me a ton of clarity around what to look at and when to look.
3896.92s:  So going back to the exit plan part of this is if you have stock, which I think was
3902.96s:  Cedric was saying that if it's different with stock or did I fuck that up and did I
3908.72s:  say that that was somebody else?
3910.36s:  Hold on.
3911.36s:  There we go.
3913.36s:  Cedric.
3914.36s:  So Cedric says with options, you have to have a exit plan shares is different.
3920.20s:  The reason why shares is not different is that if I'm holding shares that I got here
3924.80s:  at $5.33 and GameStop is trading anywhere in here trading at 88 trading at 322, the difference
3935.72s:  is if I don't have an exit plan for a certain price move, then even though if I bought,
3943.16s:  let's take a look.
3944.36s:  If I bought, this is old examples.
3949.20s:  I'll leave that to working only.
3954.04s:  Let's say that I bought 100 shares at three bucks.
3956.76s:  We got in early.
3957.92s:  We got in the elevator early.
3959.56s:  We have 100 shares.
3962.00s:  On that 100 shares at this point, I'm up 30 grand.
3966.44s:  Nice big profit.
3968.24s:  Super, super, super big fan.
3970.88s:  Great.
3972.20s:  That's what if you don't book that profit or some of that profit or set a stop for that
3977.56s:  profit or do anything to secure that profit as soon as GameStop comes back down, which
3983.60s:  it will, I guarantee it.
3986.60s:  That is another trait of squeezes a preamble to the video that's going to come out next
3991.16s:  week is that it always comes back down in price.
3996.08s:  It's because of the function that leads to a squeeze.
4003.24s:  It's how they behave.
4005.80s:  It is a structural irregularity that leads to the price movement.
4010.64s:  That's why the move is not sustained because as soon as the underlying conditions abate,
4017.32s:  price will return to its nominal level, whatever that is.
4021.68s:  So if we're trading a squeeze and we hold it while it's up, that's sick.
4029.76s:  If we continue holding and do nothing, it's going to come back down.
4036.20s:  And then what?
4038.20s:  You're holding a trade here that you had 100 shares that was up 30 grand.
4044.48s:  And then as it comes back down to whatever it's nominal prices, let's say it comes
4048.04s:  back down to like 15, well, now you have something that's worth a grand.
4055.36s:  Big problem.
4058.00s:  We've just made a massive mistake because another thing traders do is forget that you
4065.72s:  can always reenter a trade.
4069.32s:  So for me, if I was trading GameStop with shares for squeezes, I don't do that.
4074.20s:  I prefer options.
4075.20s:  But if I was using shares, what I would do is set profit targets based on different levels
4082.20s:  that I would scale out as it hit these different levels.
4086.72s:  Then as soon as GameStop finishes its squeeze because again, it's going to.
4091.64s:  Anything that squeezes is going to finish at some point and return to some sort of nominal
4096.64s:  level.
4097.64s:  It's going to happen.
4098.96s:  And then when it comes back down to whatever that nominal level is, I can just buy again.
4104.08s:  I can just buy more shares.
4106.76s:  But traders are so linear in their thought process that they think like once they're out,
4112.28s:  the trade's done and they just move on.
4114.68s:  And it's so silly because you've done all this due diligence.
4118.48s:  You have all this research.
4119.64s:  You have this conviction.
4120.64s:  You have something you like.
4122.88s:  If nothing else has changed other than this temporary price movement because we know
4127.68s:  it's temporary because we studied the profit mechanism as soon as that abates, we just
4133.44s:  get back in as long as nothing else has changed.
4136.32s:  So yes, you absolutely need to have an exit plan whether you hold shares or if you hold
4144.92s:  options because otherwise you're just going to watch the value of your account look really
4150.76s:  beautiful.
4152.00s:  But then you're not going to hold any of the money.
4155.24s:  It's going to go away, which is a giant problem.
4160.24s:  And this is exactly why I can tell you this is not what Roaring Kitty does because the
4166.52s:  account shows obviously selling positions for gains, but it also shows capital appreciation
4173.56s:  within the account.
4175.20s:  You cannot do that if you hold something as it goes up them back down.
4180.16s:  You have to take exits.
4185.48s:  So great question though.
4187.68s:  Love that one.
4189.08s:  I got to do a switch over and I got to get into my watermelon.
4193.16s:  We're probably going to have to grab a mango orange in a little bit as a replacement.
4198.28s:  Oh, damn, give me one second.
4200.76s:  I just spilled some.
4215.52s:  Cool.
4216.52s:  How about that?
4219.68s:  Hmm.
4222.20s:  Watermelon, seltzer, water is the way.
4225.36s:  Okay.
4226.36s:  So are we all caught up?
4232.20s:  Generational capital says you should start a squeeze watch list.
4236.16s:  I mean, I inherently do by the way that I scan markets.
4239.64s:  So I mean, for me, it's kind of, yeah, it's something that I typically pick up on when
4246.56s:  it happens.
4247.56s:  All of them obviously, but squeezes for me a much smaller part of the way that I trade.
4256.20s:  It's a much smaller part of the overall book.
4259.28s:  But all right, let's move this here.
4264.56s:  Let's grab our little tracker and we got some work to do.
4272.92s:  That Lauren says I've held all the way up and all the way down like four times now.
4276.52s:  This time I do have an extra strategy and a re-enter strategy.
4278.68s:  I'm not playing this time.
4279.68s:  That's good.
4280.68s:  That's exactly what you make the fucking money.
4286.88s:  That's like make the fucking money.
4289.56s:  Then if you could have made more money, we call that a high class problem in trading.
4295.48s:  If you've made money and you could have made more money, high class problem, low class
4300.88s:  problem is you made money then didn't make money.
4305.04s:  That's a low class problem because if you not made fucking money, make the fucking money.
4309.08s:  I love that plan Lauren.
4310.36s:  That's exactly correct.
4311.36s:  It is absolutely correct.
4314.76s:  Could not, I literally could not possibly agree more with you there.
4319.36s:  All right.
4323.12s:  So let's take a look.
4324.52s:  We did 29 Jan.
4325.88s:  So now we are here in one Feb.
4329.12s:  Let's get into it.
4330.12s:  So one Feb.
4331.52s:  21.
4332.52s:  We already know shit is going crazy.
4336.40s:  So the total gain that we're seeing is 21, 22, 25, 0, 8.63.
4346.84s:  The cash in the account is 13 million, 817, 295.47.
4361.32s:  And then the value of the account is now 35 million, 794, 795.47.
4371.32s:  Okay.
4372.40s:  So now anything change.
4377.88s:  I see we're still holding the 16 April 2112 call.
4382.68s:  So no change here.
4384.48s:  And he's had this for a little while now.
4388.60s:  And he has 50,000 shares, which let me double check where you was at here, 50,000.
4396.84s:  So same, same shares.
4400.36s:  And here he has still the same 500.
4405.16s:  So he's holding 500 of those 16 April 12 calls.
4409.56s:  And now 16 April 21.
4414.36s:  Now the date is one Feb, 21.
4419.24s:  I'm just tracking the DTE because this is one of the things I'm trying to identify.
4423.08s:  So 74 DTE remaining.
4426.08s:  One of the things I'm very curious about is what's the exiting behavior around these different
4430.44s:  time frames.
4431.44s:  So that's where I'm keeping eye on.
4433.72s:  Roy and Clity says, wow, I think I was just called low class.
4436.96s:  Well, I didn't call you low class.
4439.20s:  But if you did that, you do have a low class problem.
4441.96s:  That's true.
4442.96s:  You don't have to worry about what you're going to do with the money you made because you
4448.56s:  didn't make any fucking money.
4450.16s:  You don't have to worry about how much more you could have made because you didn't make
4453.92s:  any fucking money.
4455.24s:  So yeah, I agree.
4456.24s:  Those are like general low class problems.
4460.20s:  Yeah, but you're not low class.
4462.20s:  I don't think so at all.
4465.24s:  Semicristen says a little voice is whispering that this data could be extracted with AI
4470.16s:  and put in Excel.
4471.60s:  So we can just start the analysis point.
4474.12s:  Just a little voice.
4476.20s:  It actually couldn't not well.
4478.40s:  And I wouldn't trust it.
4480.28s:  So for Semicristen, if you want, you could absolutely do that for sure, 100%.
4489.04s:  But yeah, I think that you're going to miss a ton, a ton of detail.
4496.60s:  One click, he says, what if I did it so many times now, it's my identity.
4501.24s:  That's the cool part.
4502.24s:  That is literally the cool part.
4503.56s:  You can always, always change your identity totally up to you.
4508.76s:  There's no imperative at any point in your life.
4512.44s:  You get to decide who you are, what you value, what you're about.
4517.60s:  And you've already told me before earlier in this chat that you have a different fucking
4521.92s:  plan.
4522.92s:  So you now are not getting ready to deal with low class problems.
4528.04s:  You've already outlined a plan to deal with a high class problem.
4532.56s:  So I offer to you, you've already changed your identity by developing that plan.
4538.88s:  And then the next time we get a big squeeze, we're going to be talking about what to do
4543.32s:  with your high class problem, which I eagerly await.
4546.36s:  Those are the fun ones in general.
4548.72s:  So take that, Roryn Clity says, hi, I think that was someone else.
4556.12s:  Oh, I think it might have been that Lauren.
4557.60s:  Well, just you two, do the same thing.
4561.44s:  Do that same exact thing.
4563.28s:  Okay.
4564.28s:  So no other change here.
4566.84s:  Let's move on to two, two, two, two, two, two, one.
4578.40s:  And we have total gain seven.
4585.68s:  This is an important day.
4586.68s:  I can already tell you seven, five, nine, eight, seven, five, eight, got six, three.
4595.68s:  This is a very interesting day, which I'm going to talk to you about in a minute.
4599.68s:  Full cache is about the same.
4605.28s:  So 13, eight, one, seven, five, six, seven, got six, two.
4612.16s:  And then value is 22, one, seven, one, three, one, seven, got six, two.
4620.16s:  Okay.
4621.16s:  So this is an important day.
4623.16s:  Why do you think that this is an important day in my opinion?
4626.36s:  There's a few things that I see here that are really, really important to me.
4630.40s:  And then give me one second.
4631.40s:  I'm going to let the dog out and grab another mingle orange.
4716.36s:  All right.
4732.36s:  So here's, here's the main thing that I see.
4741.84s:  And I look at the price movement between these two days.
4746.68s:  And I look at the overall gain that he had, not so much on the shares, but on these options.
4754.28s:  It's actually really, really important to note the difference between these, right?
4759.04s:  So in this case, he was up 10.7 mil.
4764.16s:  The end of Jan, he was up 15.96 mil.
4768.96s:  From here, he was up nine.
4770.80s:  So this goes back into the entire thesis that I have with respect to how he trades his
4777.46s:  options, which is kind of the inverse so far of what I've talked to you all about in
4784.52s:  terms of having an exit strategy, because the exit strategy here is not based on price.
4791.16s:  Now again, I'm not saying that he doesn't have one.
4792.88s:  He clearly does.
4794.20s:  But what I've have seen a few times is because when I look at the way that he holds these
4800.92s:  options is a lot of times, he takes them in pretty close in time, but not always.
4806.84s:  So we have a couple areas that I really need to go back once we finish going through all
4811.40s:  of these to dissect more in detail.
4814.88s:  Because here, for example, that he got out of the 15 Jan 21s, the 17s and the 15s, but
4822.68s:  he kept the 10s and 20s all the way in until like 10 DT.
4827.56s:  And then he took the others ones in at one DT, right?
4830.92s:  That's actually funny enough.
4833.24s:  It's a very clear identifier to me that this is actually not a straight up solidified
4839.48s:  plan at all.
4841.00s:  This is something that's kind of being worked out as we go, which is interesting.
4845.24s:  Now, for those that don't know, I don't really care about eating that much, but I do need
4850.08s:  some calories.
4851.24s:  So I'm going to have this little pouch thing.
4854.00s:  It's 180 calories and it is 12 grams of protein.
4858.44s:  It's apple, sweet potato, banana, almond, butter, collagen, and lion's mane.
4862.68s:  And it will take me just a second to get down.
4864.48s:  It's pretty quick.
4868.68s:  And then that's it.
4878.24s:  Boom.
4879.40s:  Yeah.
4880.40s:  I know, it's gonna be pretty quick.
4881.36s:  But I don't have to worry about it.
4882.36s:  There's no chewing, there's no fuss, done and done.
4886.04s:  Hot and hydrason does it taste good.
4888.24s:  I like it.
4889.40s:  I think it tastes okay.
4891.12s:  I think the I'll tell you the flavor.
4893.22s:  The flavor is apple pie.
4894.80s:  I don't know that I would call it apple pie.
4896.68s:  Like I don't think it actually tastes like that to be completely honest.
4900.28s:  But yeah, it tastes fine enough.
4903.04s:  I'm very much a utilitarian feeder, so I do not care at all.
4908.92s:  about, well, that's a lie. I mean, obviously I like good food, but I don't care that much.
4914.92s:  Like, if there was a way for me to have like a pill that could nourish me fully and never
4920.28s:  have to eat, I would pick that. I'm not a foodie by any means, like even a little bit.
4927.40s:  Doctors A says, what's it called? It's called re-up. I get them off Amazon.
4934.60s:  Long Swazie says, my son likes these as well. The funny thing is, is like, before I found these
4939.48s:  ones, which is like the adult version, I literally would have the baby food version, which is always
4943.16s:  hilarious, because I would be everybody would think, like, oh, you know, we're grabbing it for our
4948.68s:  baby, which we don't have one. I'm the baby. And the running joke was that if we have kids that
4955.32s:  I'm going to be fighting the kids for their little, for the baby food pouches, because I like them too.
4961.56s:  And I'm bigger than them. So they're going to have to figure that out. That's going to be
4965.24s:  difficult, I think. So yeah. That's the main thing I see here. The fact that he had this position
4973.80s:  that literally was up $15 million. And then now it's up only, only $3.8 million. So this goes back
4983.64s:  into highlighting the risk tolerance, what he's looking for. And it highlights a lot of the mindset
4991.56s:  that he's using here that again, I find very, very interesting. So this I find interesting as well,
4998.04s:  that he forecasted when he's backing off the daily updates. I think he started them for a little
5003.24s:  while, but he like went before he was doing like weekly updates. So we'll see what he goes to
5007.80s:  from here. So this is three Feb 21. And looks like no change. So total gain is seven, eight,
5021.16s:  five, three, zero, zero eight, dot six, three. Get this out of the way. And then cash, 13,
5034.84s:  eight, one, seven, five, six, seven, got 62. And then value 22, 425, five, six, seven,
5046.04s:  got six, two. Okay. So same, same, no change. He's another day in on these options, 72, DTE.
5055.24s:  Easy update.
5056.36s:  Gladamere says he already sold 500 of those April 16 calls.
5067.00s:  Yes, he did it at two different points. We already know this. So he did it first on 25 Jan,
5072.92s:  he took 200 down. And then on the 27th of Jan, he took 300 down. So yep, we know that
5080.36s:  down here 19 Feb 21, 19 Feb 21. Now we are at we are down to 2825. That's nuts. That's
5098.04s:  absolutely nuts. 2825, 130, dot six, four. That's nuts. Passes moved a little bit. So 11,
5111.08s:  eight, eight, two, seven, oh, two, dot seven, one. And then value is at 17, 397, 952, dot seven, one.
5123.56s:  And knew it. So he pulled money out of the account here. He pulled a non-trivial amount of money
5128.92s:  out of the account. He pulled a few million dollars out of the account. Very interesting.
5142.84s:  And he doubled his shares. So now he added. So he's still holding these.
5153.56s:  Please have 71 DTE. And then added, let me come over here. Added 50 K shares.
5169.64s:  Let me take a look. What was his prior cost basis? So
5183.24s:  prior basis here was 14, eight, nine, four, seven, eight, nine, four, seven.
5195.40s:  And then now we have 100,000 shares at 26, seven, nine, eight, six.
5213.08s:  And now I'm seeing what he added his basis at. I'm going to have a see.
5243.24s:  So it looks like he added the basis at 387025,
5254.12s:  7025.
5260.20s:  Interesting. Okay. So now we have end of update, 26,
5268.92s:  Feb, 26 Feb, 21. And by Feb, I obviously mean Feb.
5279.16s:  I say we go through Feb and then we'll see how many more there are. Like we'll do like a few
5284.68s:  more and then we'll get into some tinfoil hats stuff if you guys still want.
5290.60s:  Because these ones should go pretty quick, I think. Total gain now is 11, 952.
5299.40s:  630.640.
5304.76s:  The cash in the account now is stable,
5309.48s:  at 1188257.9.21. And then the value of the portfolio is at 26, 525.
5322.28s:  329.2.1.
5329.48s:  And 11952.
5338.12s:  There looks like a slight rounding error here, but not bad.
5345.72s:  Yeah.
5346.68s:  Yeah.
5347.64s:  Hot nitrogen says, why don't you put the dates in a format,
5351.16s:  sheets understands would be easier to manipulate data later if you wanted.
5355.00s:  Because well, one, these are dated how I want. These I can just parse out pretty easily.
5360.84s:  The really the entire purpose of this part of the analysis literally is just to get a fingerprint
5366.36s:  for his trading. That's like the entire objective. So I already have like other sheets that have
5372.44s:  already pulled all of his all of this stuff out. But I want I literally want to go through
5378.28s:  line by line and look at it. It's the same thing when I look at a lot of people are really
5382.84s:  shocked that like as a professional trader, well, a professional retail trader, whatever you
5386.84s:  want to call it full-time trader, that I still actually largely prefer to manually input my
5395.32s:  own trades. Like I still physically type them in versus automating it, which is not hard to do.
5400.04s:  And it's an entire it's like it's literally based on an entire preference. So yeah,
5406.68s:  that's generally why here at least. So he's still holding these.
5412.28s:  And now it's 26 fab 21 26 21. So now we have 49 DTE. So now these are starting to get to a point
5421.72s:  where something may or may not have to happen at some point in here. These are other just
5427.08s:  scratches where I figured out the price of his other stock purchases. I'll move this up here.
5433.08s:  What's out of the way? And then here we go.
5441.72s:  So now we have eight March.
5445.32s:  Eight March 21.
5446.76s:  And now little gain is 25. So he's up massively again 25 816 130.64.
5463.96s:  The cash and the account is about the same. So 11882936.46.
5474.28s:  And then the value here is 40.
5480.76s:  389.286.46.
5488.36s:  So slight deviation in these. This looks like just extra interest earned. Something like that.
5494.44s:  It doesn't look like much.
5498.68s:  And we're still holding these.
5500.36s:  So this is now eight March.
5507.32s:  Eight March 21. And now we have 3090.
5517.40s:  So again, this goes back to what we were talking about before,
5520.60s:  which is still very very very very much looks like. He's managing these not based on
5530.28s:  some sort of profit target that I don't see.
5546.44s:  Interesting.
5552.84s:  Okay.
5553.48s:  So then let's go to 23 March.
5559.48s:  Oh, yeah, we're flying now.
5565.48s:  No change to position size. Total gain here is 2391 to
5571.00s:  2380.64.
5576.76s:  Cash on hand is 11882812.96.
5584.60s:  And then value is 38.485.
5592.76s:  312.
5595.72s:  Got it.
5596.68s:  96.
5598.44s:  Okay.
5599.64s:  So he's still locked in there.
5602.44s:  And now the date is 23 March 21.
5606.12s:  And now we have 24 DTE.
5607.48s:  So it's now I'm kind of getting excited because it's coming up on.
5610.60s:  He's going to have to do something with these options soon.
5612.76s:  And I'm actually quite eager to see
5615.80s:  when.
5619.48s:  Yeah, when this happens.
5621.32s:  The other thing.
5624.20s:  The other thing that I find really interesting.
5627.80s:  For 101.
5632.60s:  40.
5636.52s:  92.
5641.72s:  Interesting.
5644.60s:  So he does why like why does he do this?
5648.12s:  So now he does like a couple on a row 24 March 21.
5654.52s:  I haven't really been able to figure out this.
5659.00s:  Like the posting pattern.
5660.60s:  It's like erratic.
5664.36s:  And the one thing I see it's like when it's making more money, he posts more.
5670.44s:  I can.
5673.64s:  I can clearly see that.
5674.84s:  And then it's almost as like as he's losing money.
5684.04s:  And then 24 March 21.
5687.56s:  Okay, total gain is 14.
5691.64s:  805.
5693.64s:  130.
5695.08s:  Got six four.
5697.40s:  Cash 1188.
5699.80s:  Two 812.
5701.40s:  That's six.
5702.44s:  And then value is 29.
5705.80s:  378.
5707.80s:  062.
5709.80s:  That nine six.
5713.80s:  Okay, we're still holding these.
5716.84s:  Which are now more DTEs.
5720.84s:  So 23 DTE.
5722.68s:  Now the good part here is that these are so far.
5728.92s:  These are so far in the money that there's no love lost to hold these at these point.
5738.68s:  Because with the underlying trading at 120 or you know over 100,
5743.48s:  these are like so so far in the money.
5746.68s:  And then here 31 March 31 March 21.
5755.24s:  Rolling TDCs you got to look at the events.
5758.44s:  Not just the numbers.
5759.72s:  Yeah, tell me that's why we're doing this on the live stream.
5762.36s:  So you guys tell me what was going on on these days.
5764.68s:  Because that's something we can definitely take a look at together.
5767.40s:  Because again, that's why I'm tracking the the dates in between these.
5774.12s:  Is because it like I can see clear tendencies between the posting frequency, right?
5779.08s:  So here we're up a million dollars.
5782.04s:  Then we get a post two days after up three.
5785.08s:  Then we get a post afterwards up 3.9.
5787.48s:  Then essentially it started going static.
5789.48s:  So nothing happened.
5790.44s:  We're up 3.9.
5792.28s:  Then three days later we're up 7.9.
5795.40s:  Then a day after that we're up a point two.
5797.72s:  Then we double.
5798.52s:  So it's a day after that.
5799.48s:  Then we double again.
5800.36s:  So it's a day after that.
5801.40s:  We cut in half.
5802.28s:  So we get it a day after that.
5803.72s:  Doubles again.
5804.36s:  It's a day after that.
5805.56s:  So like here it's like clearly very exciting.
5808.28s:  Then we get two days in a row where it's at 7.6 mil.
5812.28s:  And then it goes dark.
5814.36s:  And then as soon as we have this 2.8 mil update on the 16th,
5818.44s:  seven days later we get one that's at 12 mil.
5820.92s:  And he goes back to this kind of standard cadence almost.
5825.08s:  Where but then again here we go from 23 mil to 14 mil.
5829.56s:  And now we're getting another update on 31 March a week later.
5833.96s:  So really, really interesting.
5839.16s:  Total gain here on 31 March is 25231.
5845.80s:  880.640.
5850.52s:  And then cash is 11882911.02.
5858.12s:  And then total is 39804.
5864.76s:  911.
5867.56s:  That's 02.
5868.60s:  And we are still holding these.
5873.80s:  And now it is 31 March.
5877.32s:  Which gives us 16 DTE.
5881.24s:  4.
5881.48s:  So we testified to Congress on the 18th.
5885.88s:  Yeah, and then he posted right.
5887.08s:  Yeah, so I don't think
5890.92s:  there's a good chance that this in here.
5893.32s:  I don't know when he got.
5898.12s:  Do you guys know what was he deposed?
5900.60s:  Did he have to testify or did he choose to testify?
5903.72s:  Do you guys know the answer to that?
5905.80s:  Because I do not.
5907.80s:  And I think that would actually be an interesting
5911.32s:  data point because that would also inform some of his posts, I think.
5916.44s:  Then we have 1 April.
5919.80s:  1 APR.
5922.84s:  21.
5923.48s:  Oops, 1 APR.
5929.88s:  And total gain here is 25403.
5940.84s:  630.
5943.32s:  Got.
5946.36s:  640.
5949.16s:  Ash 11882.
5953.72s:  979.
5955.32s:  Got 98.
5958.28s:  Value 39.
5961.48s:  976.
5964.28s:  729.
5967.56s:  9A.
5968.36s:  Oops.
5973.64s:  This looks like a slight rounding error, so it looks about the same.
5976.92s:  And everything else is the same.
5979.48s:  So now we have it on 1 April 21.
5985.80s:  Which is 15 DTE still no change.
5989.16s:  And now as options are sitting at 9 mil gain.
5997.00s:  So.
5997.72s:  And they're coming in on time.
6003.96s:  There's still so far in the money that he doesn't really lose much by holding them.
6008.44s:  So he's not like bleeding a bunch of theta.
6010.84s:  So I don't think he cares so much about like theta to care optimizing for that at all.
6020.68s:  Willie says what's RK strategy so far?
6023.16s:  Anything noteworthy.
6025.32s:  I think it's two things.
6027.64s:  It's.
6030.44s:  It's definitely obviously playing the appreciation of GameStop.
6035.96s:  The parts that can found me is that.
6040.84s:  I don't think.
6043.08s:  The cat actually thought GameStop would be worth $200 in like a natural valuation or over $200.
6052.28s:  Like I don't actually think he thinks that because he's a value investor, he knows better.
6057.56s:  So one of the things I find really interesting is that he continues to hold some of these
6061.64s:  positions as they're ebbing and flowing at these much higher price levels.
6066.60s:  And he's just kind of like seemingly holding.
6069.88s:  And that is really interesting because again, part of the game is understanding the profit
6078.84s:  mechanism of what you're trading.
6081.96s:  So here again, he's smart.
6087.16s:  So he knows what he's doing.
6090.92s:  And he knows that a squeeze doesn't materially change the value of a company.
6098.76s:  So as it's going through a squeeze, I know that he knows that this is a temporary thing.
6106.76s:  So with that as the case, I think a big part of what he's doing here,
6115.64s:  at least seemingly, oh fuck, I messed this up. Hold on, sorry.
6119.96s:  This one's 15 DTE.
6121.88s:  And then this one was 31 March, 21, this was 16 DTE.
6130.44s:  So these look like they're just based on like time.
6136.04s:  And this goes back, I genuinely believe,
6139.88s:  off-puting says he's stacking shares. He's not.
6142.04s:  Like he already put on all the shares, at least as of, you know, to this point.
6147.08s:  Right? Because he added 50,000 shares back in 19 Feb.
6151.96s:  And he's been sitting on over $11 million of cash.
6155.72s:  So he's not stacking shares.
6157.64s:  He's obviously building shares when he wants.
6159.72s:  There's no doubt there.
6161.56s:  But he's done nothing with shares in this.
6165.00s:  He's just adding periodically.
6167.88s:  And then he's holding these options for a really long time.
6173.24s:  And that I find, again, it's from a trading perspective.
6178.20s:  It's illogical to hold them as he has.
6182.36s:  So then we have 16 April,
6184.12s:  21.
6191.48s:  And the total gain is 19 902,
6198.52s:  513.
6201.24s:  Got 83.
6204.04s:  The cash in the account is 3,
6207.72s:  535,
6210.52s:  248,
6212.76s:  got 01.
6213.64s:  So we obviously used a bunch of cash here.
6216.36s:  And then the value of the portfolio is 34,
6220.68s:  473,
6223.72s:  248,
6225.48s:  got 01.
6228.52s:  Okay.
6229.88s:  So the 16 April,
6235.08s:  12 calls are gone.
6238.44s:  Now we need to figure out where they went.
6241.56s:  So to do that, we're going to look at his new $200,000 position
6245.56s:  or 200,000 shares.
6248.04s:  So prior,
6251.72s:  he had 100,000 shares.
6258.84s:  So if I have 100,000 shares,
6261.96s:  and the basis on that 100,000,
6267.32s:  was 26.
6271.96s:  7, 9, 8, 6.
6275.16s:  And now we have 200,000 shares.
6279.88s:  And our new basis is 55,
6289.00s:  55,
6290.84s:  got 1774.
6293.72s:  So the basis of the added shares, so let's see.
6314.60s:  So the basis of the added shares was 83, 5562.
6319.64s:  So added 100,000 shares at
6326.20s:  83, 5562.
6330.44s:  And then the 16 April,
6335.00s:  12 calls sold, I think.
6338.28s:  And we can confirm that really quick.
6342.68s:  Because
6343.48s:  who wouldn't say he exercised for 50 and then bought 50?
6350.84s:  It literally wouldn't make any sense to do that.
6355.72s:  It would literally make zero sense to do that.
6358.76s:  So I do not think that that's what he did.
6363.24s:  So let's see.
6364.92s:  But we can test the theory, because maybe it is true.
6367.24s:  I'll take it as if it's true.
6369.08s:  So we think we have 50,000,
6370.68s:  because the problem is 50,000 shares, 50,000 shares.
6375.88s:  So we have 50,000 shares then at 12.
6383.96s:  Off Putin says 154.69 plus 12 divided by 12 equals.
6390.76s:  That again, I think you're looking at the wrong thing here.
6401.32s:  Because the last update that we got from him was on the 1st of April.
6408.76s:  So
6412.68s:  when was this posted?
6414.44s:  Yeah, he absolutely did not exercise.
6416.52s:  I know for a fact, he did not exercise.
6419.00s:  Do you know why I know he didn't exercise?
6420.76s:  It actually makes the problem said even easier.
6424.76s:  Don't even have to waste the time on that.
6426.92s:  I know definitively he did not exercise.
6429.00s:  And he guess?
6431.24s:  Average the current share price with his 12 strike.
6434.60s:  It doesn't matter.
6436.92s:  Unless he, no, maybe.
6439.48s:  Okay, so no, I redact that.
6441.32s:  I don't know for a fact.
6442.52s:  That's true.
6443.16s:  I don't know for a fact.
6444.52s:  But the reason why I strongly don't think he exercised is because
6451.72s:  if it's the April 16th and he took it into exploration,
6456.44s:  which is be the most logical place to exercise your option.
6459.56s:  If you hold it into exploration,
6461.40s:  I don't think he exercised early.
6463.88s:  They wouldn't, they wouldn't be added yet.
6466.44s:  Because he posted this at 120 PM Pacific time
6473.72s:  on the Friday the 16th.
6476.28s:  The he's his shares wouldn't, they wouldn't be settled then.
6479.64s:  The exercise literally doesn't happen that fast.
6481.80s:  It would be the next day that they're there.
6483.88s:  So they wouldn't be there yet if he exercised.
6486.60s:  So if he did the logical thing,
6488.60s:  take it into exploration so that he's not giving up
6490.92s:  extrinsic value,
6492.84s:  then it's the 16th.
6495.48s:  If he took his options into exploration that were in the money
6499.08s:  with the intent of exercising them,
6500.92s:  which he absolutely could have done,
6503.08s:  then they wouldn't be there until the next day.
6507.00s:  They wouldn't be in the account 20 minutes after the market closed on the 16th.
6511.96s:  So I don't see that.
6513.48s:  And then off Putin says he paid 600K to exercise.
6515.96s:  Yeah, that's just it literally doesn't make sense to exercise.
6519.00s:  That's the point.
6520.44s:  It's one it literally doesn't make sense.
6523.88s:  So I don't believe that he did.
6529.56s:  That is my best thesis right now.
6532.52s:  Is that I don't see.
6536.52s:  I don't see that he did.
6541.32s:  Mr. Overseh says just be direct and tell us your bearish on GME.
6544.92s:  I'm not bearish.
6545.72s:  I have no.
6547.72s:  Again, this is the person or this is like the kind of people
6552.68s:  that I find.
6553.40s:  Like when they hear that I sell calls again shares,
6556.04s:  they think that that means I'm bearish.
6557.80s:  If I hold shares, it's a bullish position.
6560.84s:  It's not bearish.
6561.88s:  I don't want the stock to go down if I hold shares.
6565.40s:  So no, that's absolutely not that's not correct.
6570.60s:  I'm not bearish.
6571.88s:  I'm very direct with what I think about GameStop
6575.72s:  and in terms of the way it performs.
6577.72s:  And in terms of more over than that,
6580.68s:  depending on what I want to happen doesn't matter.
6586.04s:  T.C.M. King says I don't think he could get that cost basis without
6589.40s:  exercising to get 50,000 and then bought 50,000.
6593.00s:  Yeah, let's take a look at that because that's a great point.
6595.48s:  And that's I think the next natural segue.
6599.48s:  So let's see.
6602.20s:  So essentially what we need to see is the price behavior
6605.16s:  between the first and the 16th.
6609.24s:  So I think, yeah,
6612.04s:  do you know where I can get a non-split adjusted chart?
6616.92s:  Because that would be better.
6620.04s:  Let's go to the end of April and let's see what this looks like.
6631.32s:  He absolutely could have if this is even remotely correct.
6650.36s:  Hmm.
6656.44s:  And then let's just do that math really quick.
6665.32s:  Let's see.
6665.88s:  So we were talking about 50,000 and then 50,000.
6671.24s:  And then we think some of that might have been done at 12.
6674.12s:  It would have been technically 12.2 because that was his basis.
6678.52s:  And then we'd have to figure out whatever the
6685.32s:  we'd have to figure out whatever the residual would be.
6694.12s:  Then this equals this.
6702.60s:  Okay.
6703.00s:  Okay.
6705.00s:  So then, all right, I'm just going to throw this into the chat.
6707.72s:  GPT will be a little bit faster.
6709.88s:  So the original scenario is if I had 100 shares of stock at a basis of 26, 7, 9, 8, 6,
6718.12s:  now I have 200,000 shares at 55.1774.
6725.64s:  Let's say I'm just going to say bought.
6729.40s:  I'm not going to bother telling it that I exercise anything.
6732.20s:  So I bought 50,000 shares
6740.28s:  at 12.2.
6743.64s:  What is the basis for the remaining 50,000 shares I added?
6753.88s:  Let's see.
6755.00s:  All right.
6769.64s:  GCM King says just multiply your 15 April 2021 chart.
6773.80s:  I don't the problem is I don't trust it, right?
6776.44s:  Because the other thing is I can't just use the I can't use the 15 April
6782.84s:  because there's a window here, right?
6785.88s:  So I don't know.
6787.48s:  Like he could have bought those 50,000 shares.
6790.84s:  Like if the scenario that we're working with is that he exercised 50,000, which again,
6797.48s:  I don't see it yet, but I'm open to it for sure.
6800.84s:  Because he also uses, I think what is this e-trade?
6803.56s:  I don't use e-trade.
6804.76s:  So maybe e-trade shows the shares faster than any other platform I've seen that could be.
6809.48s:  Again, strong convictions loosely held.
6811.72s:  Happy to abandon it if I see data that lines up.
6814.84s:  So but when I look at this, the problem is we can't use this 16th, the 15th,
6822.44s:  or really any other period before that.
6826.68s:  Because
6829.88s:  like he could have bought those 50,000 shares any time in here, right?
6833.72s:  So any point during this, which we wouldn't know.
6835.56s:  So
6837.48s:  off-putin says only 12 would come out of current cash, not 1220.
6844.60s:  It's again, Putin, you're looking at the wrong thing.
6846.92s:  I don't care if it came out of cash.
6848.60s:  Whatever came out of cash doesn't matter to me right now.
6851.40s:  All I'm doing is I can figure this out by basis.
6857.24s:  That's all I need, right?
6858.52s:  So when I look at the basis of the shares, that's the equation that we're working with.
6863.96s:  So
6868.60s:  Roryntady says some brokers auto exercise in hours before the close, right?
6872.60s:  No, definitely not.
6873.56s:  Absolutely not.
6874.36s:  They would not do that.
6875.16s:  Because exercise, again, exercise is done after the close.
6878.52s:  So even if I choose to exercise my options in a day, it's not going to be settled and see them
6883.24s:  until later in the day.
6886.68s:  What does this say?
6888.44s:  Thus the basis for the adding, yeah, see, I don't think it's right.
6891.96s:  Because then the added shares in this scenario, the added shares would have been at $154.
6898.60s:  91124.
6901.48s:  And I just don't think that's correct.
6905.96s:  Because then his original position was 100,000.
6909.72s:  And then his basis in that 100,000 was 26.7986.
6918.12s:  Total cost here equals this times this.
6930.44s:  So then here,
6934.04s:  well, off-put in the problem is,
6937.48s:  like, and again, this is why I need a pre-adjusted chart that I trust.
6942.68s:  Because right now, I like, I don't actually trust what I'm seeing here in GameStop.
6946.76s:  Is it accurate?
6948.20s:  So we can finish this really quick.
6950.60s:  So essentially, we just need to do equals some of that equals some of this equals.
6970.36s:  55, 17, 74.
6973.32s:  4 lines up perfect.
6977.72s:  Lines up perfect.
6981.16s:  154.91.
6984.60s:  This, I also think, yeah, no, I think you guys are right.
6988.20s:  I think you guys are right.
6990.52s:  Because the other thing is this is showing last price at 154.69.
6997.00s:  So then this to me looks like he would have bought right before the close.
7006.76s:  Because that lines up really well with this.
7009.24s:  Yeah, you guys are 100% wrong.
7011.24s:  You guys are 100% correct.
7013.48s:  So he added, so this looks like, because here this is,
7017.80s:  oh, I need to see a chart.
7020.68s:  I still believe that you guys are right.
7022.12s:  Based on what I see here, I still think that that is absolutely
7026.44s:  the most likely that I see now.
7030.20s:  But I need to see like a GME.
7035.40s:  Non-split adjusted.
7039.80s:  Does Yahoo Finance do that?
7043.88s:  So the first split was in 07, which doesn't matter.
7048.84s:  I don't come on, man.
7050.28s:  Let's see.
7061.64s:  This doesn't tell me when the splits were.
7063.16s:  That's kind of really annoying.
7065.48s:  I just want to see something.
7068.36s:  Do you know if Yahoo Finance does this?
7074.84s:  EME.
7076.12s:  Let's take a look at this really quick.
7080.12s:  And then let's do.
7085.64s:  We want to do off Putin says the shares had not touched 83.50 since Feb.
7092.20s:  Okay.
7092.52s:  Yeah.
7092.84s:  That's exactly what I want to confirm.
7094.20s:  Because as long as that's the case, then I literally completely agree with you guys.
7097.64s:  I think that that is spot on.
7102.68s:  Let's do six month one day.
7105.64s:  And then we are in 2021.
7113.32s:  And we are in April.
7119.64s:  Yeah.
7120.20s:  Completely agree.
7136.60s:  Okay.
7139.56s:  So I think this is certainly confirmed.
7145.16s:  Then 50K of the 50K of the 16 April.
7155.48s:  Thank you for the help guys.
7156.84s:  12 call.
7158.12s:  Exercise.
7159.80s:  And then 50K.
7161.96s:  bought to open.
7164.68s:  At.
7168.52s:  154.
7171.80s:  Got 9124.
7174.76s:  So now we have no options.
7177.16s:  That's perfect.
7177.96s:  Yeah.
7180.76s:  Off Putin says math.
7181.72s:  Don't know.
7182.04s:  Yeah.
7182.28s:  That's exactly that's the beautiful part.
7183.80s:  And again, this is another thing that I clearly am learning.
7187.08s:  Right.
7187.32s:  Because when I look at this,
7189.16s:  this is completely different than any other platform.
7192.84s:  So I've never seen a platform that will credit the shares.
7196.44s:  Now this leads to another potential thing.
7199.72s:  Because I'm just not sure.
7204.36s:  If he exercise because he might have exercised early.
7207.72s:  And I don't have a way to identify that.
7212.04s:  But there's a chance he could have exercised between one April and 16 April,
7216.12s:  which opens up another really interesting question.
7219.24s:  So let me see if Chatchy PT can answer that for me.
7223.16s:  He uses is this E trader fidelity?
7225.56s:  This is E trade, right?
7226.68s:  Is that accurate?
7231.08s:  Because.
7234.68s:  E trade.
7235.16s:  Okay.
7235.40s:  Thank you.
7236.52s:  So let's take a look.
7240.44s:  Within the E trade platform.
7243.88s:  If I hold an option.
7249.08s:  And let's say that I hold it into expiration.
7252.36s:  I hold in in the money call into expiration.
7258.36s:  That I want to exercise.
7262.60s:  When will the shares appear in my account?
7269.40s:  Very, very interested about this.
7271.72s:  And then off-putances, the shares closed at 156.44 the prior day.
7277.24s:  Yeah.
7277.56s:  So it's like obviously trading around that 154 handle.
7279.96s:  Here we go.
7282.12s:  Okay.
7283.48s:  So if you hold in the money option into expiration and choose to exercise.
7290.44s:  Yeah.
7290.84s:  See, it says the shares will typically appear in your account by the following trading day.
7296.68s:  So usually on the Monday after expiration.
7298.92s:  So this leads me to believe that he exercised slightly early.
7305.16s:  I'm going to add a note here.
7308.52s:  Early question mark because I don't know.
7311.88s:  But I believe this is early, which is an important note for me.
7315.80s:  Believe it or not.
7318.76s:  Wow.
7320.52s:  What a banger.
7322.36s:  What a fucking banger.
7324.28s:  So this is super curious.
7330.76s:  All of this is super curious so far.
7332.44s:  I'm going to pause us here before we get into the recent stuff.
7336.12s:  And I want to recap some of what I'm seeing.
7339.80s:  So the first thing that I'm seeing is that most of the time,
7343.96s:  he's holding the options very close if not all the way into expiration.
7349.00s:  Very, very close like all the way in here.
7351.40s:  And I've seen that multiple times now.
7353.72s:  In this case, it looks like the overwhelming probability is an early exercise.
7360.04s:  And it's probably because he was expecting to lose all the extrinsic value anyways
7365.88s:  by taking it into expiration.
7368.68s:  Now, again, it's a suboptimal choice.
7371.40s:  It doesn't actually make sense to do that.
7374.44s:  Now, the only reason why this could make sense to take it all the way in the expiration
7380.04s:  is because there's so far in the money that he would net that difference if he unwind the position.
7387.48s:  But based on what most of us have seen so far before the chewy stuff,
7392.04s:  it doesn't really look like he unwinds the positions.
7395.80s:  So that entire scenario is actually quite fascinating to me.
7400.76s:  And watching him take these options so far into expiration is really, really interesting.
7409.32s:  The other thing that I noticed is that the total gain on the account obviously is massive,
7415.48s:  massive, massive volatility.
7417.88s:  I see the peak here was 33 mil.
7421.24s:  And then when he left off, he was at essentially 20 mil.
7424.76s:  So that is also very interesting.
7428.92s:  So, Royntady says he stacks the shares.
7431.96s:  Yeah, and that's something that Newton told me that based on what Newton had seen that he's never
7437.48s:  unwound, although I do think he unwound to get into Chewie, which we will need the tinfoil hat
7443.16s:  for that part if we want to go into that, which I'm happy to.
7450.92s:  This one here.
7455.56s:  So if we take a look at, we have to zoom out.
7461.16s:  See, we need Newton.
7463.32s:  I need to hit Newton up because here it is.
7465.88s:  I'm slowly figuring out how to navigate this stuff.
7470.44s:  But he has stuff everywhere.
7471.80s:  It's really tricky.
7473.00s:  So here, Newton has shown me that essentially he scales the account.
7479.96s:  And this all looks right.
7481.64s:  And again, so this Newton already covered this.
7483.32s:  No surprise.
7487.96s:  And then,
7495.88s:  hmm.
7500.84s:  Yeah, because so we've done the cost analysis on the Chewie position.
7505.08s:  Let me grab my hat.
7513.16s:  All right, now we're ready.
7515.32s:  Oh, whoa.
7517.48s:  My hold on.
7519.00s:  Just so everybody can see that.
7520.52s:  Whoa, it's like,
7521.08s:  get a backup.
7522.92s:  Here's the hat.
7524.28s:  The hat and its full glory.
7528.12s:  So now that we have the hat on,
7532.04s:  we can take a quick look at the Chewie position.
7537.16s:  Because again, I think the problem with the Chewie position is that there just was not
7541.24s:  enough money in the account.
7542.92s:  Now, Roy and Titty says, I don't think so.
7545.80s:  He was trading with multiple accounts.
7547.24s:  He had money in other places.
7548.68s:  He used for Chewie.
7549.64s:  I again, maybe he did.
7553.88s:  But I just I just don't see it.
7559.80s:  And the reason why I don't see it is because.
7563.88s:  And again, who knows this is why the hats on is I don't know.
7567.00s:  It's pure speculation.
7569.00s:  But the reason why I don't see it is because let me consolidate this stuff down so we can
7574.36s:  zoom in a little bit.
7576.68s:  The reason why I don't see it is because when he comes back,
7582.28s:  he came back here with 210, 210 milli.
7590.92s:  So with 210 milli, why if he had another, literally another 210 milli,
7603.08s:  why would it not just be here?
7606.20s:  I don't I just I
7611.24s:  he obviously has made a lot of money.
7613.56s:  And another thing I'm even more interested in to be completely honest with you is I'm not convinced
7621.24s:  that from 16 April 2021 to June that he went from 34 mil to 210 by just trading.
7629.88s:  Absolutely could have, but I'm not convinced that that's what happened.
7633.96s:  And it's just because I can't prove it one way or the other.
7637.80s:  What's the what is the compound annual growth rate
7643.56s:  from 2021 to 2024 moving from 34, 34 mil to 211 mil.
7659.64s:  Just out of curiosity.
7661.64s:  So it's a three year period.
7672.44s:  KCM say says would you have 400 million all at one broker at least two?
7679.08s:  I don't see I don't see the reason to split it between two.
7684.12s:  I again, like if you're already at the 200 million handle.
7688.60s:  So yeah, he could.
7695.16s:  And again, the other thing that I would absolutely highlight is I don't see any reason why he
7703.16s:  wouldn't have money elsewhere.
7704.68s:  Right.
7704.84s:  I'm not suggesting that he doesn't.
7707.24s:  But my main point is I think the money that he would essentially have to trade would be
7715.96s:  TCM King says rumors, he trade thread in the closest position.
7718.76s:  I heard that too.
7719.80s:  But again, that's that's later into this.
7722.68s:  My main point and maybe you guys will have an opinion on it.
7726.04s:  So my main point here is that when he came back at two June and he has $211 million.
7733.48s:  Why wouldn't you come with all the money that you're going to trade if you had another
7739.08s:  200 million dollars that you were going to use for something at some point anyways?
7744.20s:  The other thing is that when we look at something like this,
7750.60s:  we have another really interesting scenario in my opinion where it's clear that he would have
7757.64s:  used options in the meantime because the compound annual growth rate for the three year period for
7762.92s:  him would have been about 85%, which again, that's insanely good. But that I could see him doing that.
7770.20s:  Like that's not overly crazy.
7774.20s:  In this case, it looks like I just I don't see why he would come back if he was expecting to use
7780.92s:  $400 million to trade and have $210 million in the account. Why not just have it all in one spot,
7787.72s:  especially for the way that he rolls. I don't see why he would split them.
7792.20s:  Yeah. Orange guy says, but why would he buy calls, exercise them and sell them instead of just
7798.76s:  bagging the premium? Well, you don't bag the premium. If you buy the calls, the premiums
7803.08s:  going to go away. So yeah, that's the reason why it is the same reason why he uses calls here.
7810.52s:  It's for leverage. So one of the things I can tell very clearly from his options positions is that
7817.40s:  he unequivocally uses options for leverage. Even in this case, he actually doesn't need to use
7826.04s:  options for leverage here. He has enough money for sure. But he still prefers the leverage.
7834.60s:  And I think that that's again, like an artifact of the way that he trades and the way that he rolls,
7841.40s:  really, which is again, pretty nuts. So Blanc Swayze says there is a couple of run-ups since
7848.60s:  April 21. He probably perfected the game. That's the problem though. It's like, I just don't see that.
7855.88s:  Based on what I see here, like I don't see him perfecting the game. Again, I want to be so clear.
7864.28s:  He's incredible. And he clearly has definitely timed things very well, very well. But one of the
7873.80s:  things that I can tell you again by just looking at this is that the way he's trading is not really
7881.24s:  predicated on timing. And I don't see any evidence here that he perfected it.
7889.16s:  Because if he perfected it, we wouldn't have a 33-milli-count that drops to seven that then goes
7896.12s:  back up to 25 that goes back down to 20. So the problem that I see with this idea that he's like,
7904.44s:  and again, I love the way that we hold the cat in high regard. We should. What he's done is insane.
7914.04s:  But I still think it's really important again to look at things as objectively as possible.
7919.64s:  And one of the things that I can see going on here is to me, it looks pretty clear that
7929.48s:  the timing is not perfect. I don't see perfect timing here. I see massive account volatility,
7939.24s:  massive. And I see most of his trades being managed by time in the trade, not by taking profits at
7948.20s:  advantageance points. So I don't see the timing argument. It just looks to not be the case, at
7962.12s:  least as far as what we know so far, which is fascinating, isn't it? Because even the fact that
7970.28s:  he was willing to exercise these, but then to buy in what? He bought 50,000 shares at $155.
7980.68s:  You want to talk about a fucking choice? That's a fucking choice. Because again, if we think about
7988.92s:  the psyche and the background of him as an investor, he talks about how his background is as a value
7995.48s:  investor. There's clearly no world that he actually thinks GameStop was worth $155 there.
8009.88s:  Like there's no world that he thought that. And this to me looks like a confirmation of his pivot
8017.48s:  from a value investor, which I absolutely saw him talk about in one of his live streams, where
8024.68s:  he talked about how he would value things and then they would move differently. And that would
8031.32s:  get under his skin after a little while. Semicresion says for clarity, tinfoil, it's on. You can see
8037.24s:  it's on. It's a visual representation of the speculation. This is all speculation, because I
8042.92s:  can't, I literally can't prove any of it. So the stuff that we can prove are the things that I
8047.64s:  can work out via math. I can look at money coming in and out of the account, like all of those things.
8053.32s:  But I can tell again from this purchase, that's not a value purchase. There's no world that he would
8062.92s:  have thought $155 is fair value or even below value for GameStop. There's just absolutely no way.
8071.48s:  So Willie says, wasn't he tired of price not meaning his value target? It's exactly. And he
8077.64s:  talked about that in one of his live streams. We can see if we can find it. I mean, again, we have
8083.72s:  the tinfoil hats on and everything. We can go in for a little bit. My dinner's not going to be
8088.20s:  here for a little while. So we can get, we can get in. We got a fresh mango orange. So we're ready to
8097.56s:  rock. Let's see what we have in these. No, no, no. No. No. I think it might have been a live stream.
8127.72s:  There we go. Let's try one of these new ones. Well, he says Mexican food. No, we're doing a place
8138.60s:  called Carl Strauss. It's kind of like a pub. So the guy that got me into investing, I talked about
8144.20s:  him last night. He's he was one of my high school teachers. He was a junior ROTC instructor. He's
8151.56s:  this guy right there. He's over at my house right now hanging out. Actually, he's here for like the
8156.92s:  weekend. We've we've kept in touch. I've I referred to him as my stepdad, but he's the one that I
8163.64s:  referred to him as, yeah, I referred to him as his stepdad. He's not like in any sort of relationship
8167.48s:  with my mom, but like he took very much like a father role in my life. And he's the one that
8172.44s:  introduced me to the concept of investing in high school, which he literally is the dude that changed
8177.72s:  my life. Anyways, he likes burgers. So that's why we're ordering from Carl Strauss tonight,
8183.56s:  because when he's here, it is whatever works for this dude. So yeah,
8190.84s:  that Lauren says I was wondering if you were having Mexican tonight. Yeah, no, I I was literally
8195.24s:  joking with Mel about that about how you guys advocate for sometimes with the Mexican, but no,
8200.04s:  not tonight. So semi-Christian says, has anyone tipped his driver? No, not me. I mean, I I tip them
8212.04s:  always well, but no. Jonathan says brewery. Yeah, exactly. That's what Carl stresses.
8222.12s:  Vladimir says, don't skip past the 55 17 74 cost basis on the final 200,000 shares post split
8229.80s:  1380. Yeah. Yep. Willie says, oh man, I have a high school teacher who I respect. Yeah, they
8238.84s:  like that dude literally changed my life. So yeah, he became and it's funny because his son,
8244.68s:  he had an adopted son that actually committed suicide. And then I had an abusive dad that wasn't
8251.32s:  in my life a lot. So it's just the hilarity of the universe, but it kind of put both of us together
8261.32s:  at a point where we both kind of really needed each other. And it yeah, it formed this really,
8267.00s:  really incredible relationship that was just pure happenstance. Well, whatever we consider happenstance.
8274.60s:  Rhino says, every time I say I'm trading anything but GME, the Abe community calls me a shill,
8280.36s:  it's hard to follow GME and actually make money without abuse.
8284.92s:  Well, I don't know. Rhino, I can't speak for you, but in that case, at least for me, like,
8290.12s:  I keep it a buck, right? Like it is what it is. Whatever I do is whatever it is. So like,
8294.76s:  there was that person earlier in the stream that was pissy with me because they were saying that
8299.88s:  I'm bearish because I'm selling calls, right? It's like, whatever they're going to think is whatever
8303.88s:  they're going to think, man. But like I honestly couldn't possibly care less with that one person
8308.76s:  thinks because one literally the statement doesn't make sense, right? When we look at something like
8317.24s:  a covered call, covered calls make maximum profit when the stock is above your short call. That's
8323.80s:  where maximum profit is. So again, that's just people being ignorant. It's people that don't understand
8329.96s:  how things work and they're just kind of looking for something to look at. That's genuinely what I
8334.92s:  believe. So for example, if I take a look at this scenario again, let's say that we have just 100
8340.44s:  shares is fine. And I can get rid of all these other ones now. And let's say that I sell a call
8349.08s:  against these shares. Where's my max profit? Right now in this scenario,
8357.88s:  GameStop is trading at 22. It's right here. Where's my max profit in this trade? It's
8364.04s:  fucking up. It has to go up for me to hit max profit even in a covered call. So when people say
8372.52s:  things like, oh, you sold a call, you're bearish. It again, it's pure ignorance.
8378.12s:  So like, for example, so that's just that guy. I immediately discount whatever they think because
8384.44s:  it's illogical. The people that I think it makes sense to truly onboard their opinion of you
8391.40s:  are people who know you really well. And there was an actor who said this at some point,
8396.60s:  I don't know who it was because I was watching a YouTube short where somebody was paraphrasing
8402.20s:  what they heard. It was an actor that was paraphrasing what they heard another actor say.
8407.88s:  But essentially, it's something to the effect of if you, if you have a problem with me,
8416.76s:  text me. And if you don't have my number, you don't know me well enough to have a problem with me.
8423.96s:  I actually like that a lot. I think that that's a really smart way to look at it.
8429.80s:  So Rhino, for the internet people that have a problem with you, just tell them to text you.
8435.00s:  And if they do not have the number to text you, it tells you that they don't know you well enough
8441.00s:  in order to come up with that opinion. So yeah, whatever they say is what they say.
8445.72s:  Don't even worry about it.
8454.36s:  Willie says, haters going to hate Aristotle. I think, yeah, that's probably the Aristotle probably.
8458.92s:  Yeah, that's right.
8461.64s:  Warring to the said, my fifth grade teacher taught me how to use chopsticks. She paid me to grade
8465.72s:  math test after school and took me to Chinese. She was really awesome. Keep me out of trouble.
8468.92s:  Yeah, that's so fucking sick. I love that. That's super cool. It's one of the reasons again.
8473.32s:  It's one of the reasons why I do this stuff is because I've had a lot of people positively
8477.32s:  impact me in my life that I would be in a completely different spot. And sometimes it just
8481.56s:  takes a couple interactions to send somebody down a completely better path in their life,
8486.84s:  which I think is really cool. I genuinely value that. I think that that is so
8491.72s:  unbelievably cool. All right, so let's go back into this and let's see what we can learn here.
8498.04s:  I need to turn on the volumes that you can hear. And let's see.
8506.36s:  Move it up in size. Where is it up there? Yeah, look at this. I mean, I need to have this number.
8514.68s:  So do I get some trading here? Yeah, yeah, 2023. So look at this. You still got them trading
8518.20s:  in the 90s here. And oh, let's look up. Let's look up where they've been trading the past out of
8522.76s:  what's upside. And with RFP, I do think that's the case. I see the other one, SWN.
8528.12s:  So I had a smaller number of them in here. RFP, it's here. Why didn't you tell me RFP was in this
8532.60s:  spreadsheet? Maybe you did. I wasn't listening. So if I click this, if I click this, does it bring me
8536.60s:  right to it? Okay, look at that. 300 million market cap elsewhere as well. A 15%. Oh, I thought it
8544.12s:  was a more than that. I haven't tested this in a while. Let's see. Or as well, I forget what the
8549.08s:  bomb prices are tentacle, but then I thought tentacle. I mean, I don't remember where it is. I'll
8553.80s:  have to go through them and see if I can find it. I do not remember where it is at all.
8558.36s:  Let's see. Let's see. Let's see what this one is. I'm back. And I try to think about why, why
8578.68s:  everyone thinks that night. The most obvious reason is just because we all lean on those oversimplifying
8582.84s:  ETFs to measure the style success. But I mean, that's not really successful over the past decade.
8588.60s:  The reasons why maybe this is it where it says why I'm not a value investor.
8602.12s:  Roaring Titty says it was in his live stream when he's talking about a spreadsheet. That's so
8606.20s:  tricky because I don't like I've seen I've seen like pieces of his work around in different spots.
8612.36s:  And I just like haven't mentally bucketed where each of these are.
8618.36s:  So my Christian says, chat you be used. So yeah, I'm happy to run it through chat you be. Let's see.
8626.36s:  And this thing is like completely locked up for some reason. I'm back and up.
8644.12s:  All right, so let's see. Grab this. Got this into video summarizer.
8656.12s:  And then let's see.
8657.72s:  Okay. So summarize this video. Let's see what that comes up with. Yeah. I try to think about why,
8678.44s:  why everyone thinks that night. The most obvious reason is just because we all lean on those oversimplifying
8683.00s:  ETFs to measure the style success. But I mean, that's not a good way to measure a bona fide value
8689.16s:  approach. It's um. So the summary, I'm just going to read you this summary because it's a little bit
8695.40s:  faster. So this says it starts with him explaining his style makes it clear he's not offering day
8708.12s:  trading trips or quick stock excitement isn't that funny. Isn't that funny? The beginning of
8713.64s:  the video starts with him saying he's not offering quick stock excitement. And then he that's
8721.00s:  just so classic. I love that. And then it says value investor with a twist. He says he identifies
8727.72s:  as a value investor, but he doesn't fit the traditional model. He rejects the idea that value
8732.20s:  investing is dead. But he doesn't rely on discounted cash flow. He focuses on a broader framework
8742.44s:  where value is one of the many factors. He incorporates technical analysis into his strategy,
8748.84s:  which obviously is contract to value. And he aims for aggressive 50 to 100% annualized return,
8759.72s:  acknowledging that his approach may not suit everyone. He emphasizes lumpy returns,
8764.20s:  which is exactly correct, which meaning some years while perform while others might fall short.
8768.92s:  It literally, it literally is perfect. And the reason why it's perfect is because that's a direct
8774.44s:  representation of what I've seen him do. So I'm going more into the I'm asking it more about the
8783.32s:  differing of his approach. That Lauren says break that down for the dummies. Sure, what, sorry,
8792.36s:  which part? Tell me I could take this off now because my head's getting hot. Lauren, tell me what
8798.36s:  part we we need to dive into. You know, I'm happy to let me know. Are you guys getting ads?
8806.92s:  I'm seeing comments about somebody say something about YouTube premium or whatever.
8820.76s:  And then Lauren, let me know what all of it, what does it mean in layman's terms?
8830.20s:  Layman's all of it. You mean the value investing thing that I'm talking about?
8835.24s:  I just want to make sure I'm talking about the right thing. The value investor, the idea that
8840.04s:  value investing is dead, that stuff, and like the model thing.
8847.24s:  So, okay, so yeah, let me run through this. And Lauren, let me know if there's like specific
8854.44s:  follow-ons. So value investing is a really, really distinct approach to investing. And it's very
8861.00s:  specific to investing. It's not specific. It's not tied to trading. And value investing is really
8869.48s:  predicated on searching for companies whose current stock value is below to a degree whatever the
8878.84s:  target value is, whatever somebody thinks it should be. And the way that people arrive at what
8888.12s:  they think it should be largely depends on their models, a very common one is called a discounted
8893.08s:  cash flow. And it's essentially, it sounds what it kind of does, what it sounds like, where we're
8898.68s:  trying to discount future cash flows to figure out what the current price of something should be.
8905.80s:  So, his general approach is that was his basis. That was his foundation. And we can see that
8914.52s:  represented as we go through like a lot of this earlier stuff, right? So like his little spreadsheet
8921.16s:  thing here is really specific to trying to find things at value. Now, the problem with value,
8929.64s:  well, there's a bunch of problems with value investing as an effective tool. It does work just fine
8934.76s:  to be clear. But in terms of his return profile, it doesn't work that well at all. So value
8941.40s:  investors are not typically targeting 50 to 100% returns. It's just unreasonable. Most of their
8947.24s:  stocks will move much less than that. The other thing is most value investors do not bother with
8953.00s:  technical analysis because technical analysis represents interim movements when really they're
8959.32s:  most concerned with their model and their pricing because that's where they think something should
8964.60s:  ultimately land. And then the prices in the model would get updated each quarter as new financials
8971.56s:  come out. So his general approach as he was outlining there is obviously really interesting
8977.24s:  because it's completely blending different things together, which is unequivocally just
8984.84s:  fascinating. And the way that he trades in terms of one of the things he was talking about is
8989.80s:  lumpy returns. Well, that's the nature of value investing in general. And you can see traits of
8995.88s:  those lumpy returns here where things go up, things go down, things go up, things go down.
9002.20s:  Now with the whole lumpy returns thing that I find fascinating is because it tells me that he's
9007.64s:  not actually really trying to time things super well, that he's okay holding through these different
9015.08s:  you know, movements up, movements down and so on and so forth. So yeah, the whole prospect of
9021.96s:  like his origin, you can tell his very value investing focused, but the way that he trades,
9027.32s:  obviously, this is this is not value at all. I think he came across GameStop and thought that
9034.12s:  it had decent value in the beginning, but you can tell he abandoned that fully because the way
9040.52s:  that he traded this is trading the thesis of value in my opinion, meaning that he thinks GameStop
9048.44s:  should be worth more in the future than it is now. But the way that he set this entire thing up
9053.72s:  from the beginning doesn't jive with again, the approach for like a normal value investor.
9059.00s:  A good example of a value investor is Warren Buffett. That's essentially one of the primary
9065.32s:  current state users of it, at least that scale. So yeah, the departure clearly happened. I don't
9075.40s:  know when it happened, but it definitely did happen. Do you guys know maybe it was in the live
9082.04s:  streams when it is early live streams go through a bunch of different positions? Yeah, it looks
9086.04s:  like it. So here he has a bunch of different positions. Here he still has a bunch of different
9090.68s:  positions. Let's click this one really fast. I said, I'm into the trim. Dove the just to raise
9099.48s:  some cash. My cash is getting low. Okay, so yeah, here he has a ton of stuff. Very standard
9107.96s:  value investing approach. Okay, so this was 19 aug 2020. Still value, I can see that here.
9121.72s:  Let's take a look. Shall we pull that up? Yep, so this looks like he's still holding multiple things.
9140.44s:  Let's do it. Let's do it. A lot of other roles look super bullish, but through I kind of just
9149.80s:  ballparked, although I was curious, brick and mortar and okay, so this one was
9158.44s:  when was this one? It could be 26 augs. Let's fast forward a little bit. So clearly here,
9168.20s:  still value. This guy, but his ex. So here he's introducing Cohen. I want to see if his
9179.80s:  spreadsheets in here. There it is.
9193.00s:  San Jose says, how long does this meme stock mania run? What are the limits to this? Well, I think
9198.60s:  meme stocks are never going to go away. I think that their shape will change and what is currently
9205.32s:  a meme stock will ebb and flow. But yeah, I don't see meme stocks ever going away at this point.
9212.60s:  I think meme stocks are going to continue to be a thing and it's because of social media. I don't
9217.40s:  think it'll ever change. So let's see, I want to go through this thing a little bit more and see
9224.52s:  if I can find any of his current positions. Because this looks like he's just doing valuations,
9232.60s:  right? Like this is a cash flow model. So he's trying to come up with different deflators and
9238.28s:  he's coming up with different assumptions of where he thinks things might go and you can see
9242.36s:  like these are just looking at different different companies. But what I want to see
9249.64s:  is if he has a snapshot of his portfolio, same thing, this looks like it. This looks like his portfolio.
9260.84s:  Yep. So this, yep, so I can see the percentage of his portfolio. So GameStop is now
9270.52s:  17% of his portfolio. So this started to happen. When is this?
9276.92s:  28 August 2020. Okay. So now let's open up another YouTube window really quick.
9284.28s:  And what I want to do is actually look at the movement
9291.72s:  of his position, meaning in terms of the concentration. So these are during the live streams. Yeah.
9305.32s:  TCM King says this is why people think he has more than one account. His E-trade is yellow account.
9310.68s:  We never saw a yellow post that shows any of his value shares. Well, because my hypothesis
9316.68s:  is that at that point, he became highly concentrated. And that's what I think we're going to see.
9322.28s:  And that's actually why I'm doing this exact exercise right now is I want to go back to like the
9327.64s:  beginning, like here. And I want to see what his distribution of of positions were. So in this
9335.48s:  case, this is seven aug. And we can grab his portfolio tracker. Let's see where it is.
9345.88s:  This is different. Let's find it. That looks different.
9356.20s:  Unless he changed the structure a little bit.
9359.00s:  So this one is called arcade tracker. Yep. So we're in there. Let's just see if we can find it.
9369.24s:  So what I think we're going to see is I think we're going to see his position in GameStop build and
9378.84s:  then consume everything else. This is like super blurry.
9388.76s:  And I get something I can read. There we go.
9392.28s:  Price. So this doesn't look like in his portfolio. This looks like valuation stuff.
9400.20s:  So we have to find his portfolio.
9407.56s:  Not there. That's valuation stuff. We've seen this already.
9416.12s:  More valuation. More valuation.
9432.52s:  Is this?
9433.00s:  Is?
9443.88s:  Percent evaluation. 52 week.
9448.12s:  I don't see anything in here that shows like percent of portfolio. But I don't think this is the same page.
9455.00s:  What's the stock? What's this look like? Yeah, it didn't. All right. So it's sold off.
9465.56s:  And that that was the thing. It looked like it might still hold up well, even if we'll.
9473.72s:  Some of the questions says this is better than a detective TV show. Do you realize that? Yeah,
9478.12s:  so funny. I yeah, I like trying to dive into this and see what we can find.
9486.12s:  Rointit, he says I think that is his portfolio. He has a very wide spreadsheet. Yeah.
9492.04s:  It just looks different than this.
9496.12s:  Because here I can clearly see this is in what DT.
9502.60s:  So it would be way further down. It could be.
9508.36s:  Oh, did you just see what I saw?
9518.12s:  There's Luna. That's funny.
9522.68s:  DDC, Intel,
9526.52s:  Zag. Yeah. So Rointit, I agree with you.
9531.32s:  T.C.M. King says here.
9534.84s:  He already had a GM yellow post only showing GME way before the date of the video.
9539.16s:  You just played. Oh, interesting.
9544.60s:  Very interesting. Yeah. So let's see. We have the first one in here.
9549.72s:  So the first one I see is September of 2020.
9556.52s:  Did I now go back far enough?
9565.16s:  So I think that's the first one that we grabbed. Let's go all the way down.
9586.92s:  Okay. So now all the way down at the bottom.
9590.04s:  This is the first that I see, which was 8 September in 2019.
9597.48s:  Interesting.
9604.76s:  Very interesting.
9611.72s:  So
9616.52s:  and this would make a lot more sense too.
9623.56s:  Because I think at this point,
9630.12s:  what I see here then is I agree with you that this is like just a straight up yellow account.
9638.20s:  And then he had stuff elsewhere that was doing other stuff.
9642.04s:  That's a great point. What a great find.
9645.00s:  Because this is definitely from 2020. So we saw exactly to your point. We saw
9651.64s:  the really concentrated GME position. Now here's the part that doesn't make sense to me then.
9657.56s:  Why is it here only at 16%? Let's see what the position is here. Let's see if it mirrors what we find
9668.60s:  around 28 August 2020. We can see this.
9675.16s:  Does it show that actual position?
9693.00s:  Different accounts? Yeah. So it could be. That's the thing I'm trying to figure out.
9696.20s:  Is I want to see if whatever he's tracking in here is the same as his other account.
9701.08s:  But so I can see the percent of the portfolio, which is fine. I need to see like the number of shares,
9706.12s:  though. And I don't know if he shows that. Do you guys know?
9710.12s:  So if he does, that would be really helpful.
9714.76s:  Because then we could very, very easily identify if he's
9720.84s:  mirroring the position here or elsewhere. Or if it's like a completely separate account.
9731.88s:  I don't see it here. Damn. Damn. Daniel.
9749.40s:  Damn it. Okay. So that's something that we're going to have to add that to my to-do list
9755.48s:  for the next one that we do. So we need review, archives, 2024 trades, and analyze
9769.64s:  live streams to parallel, current portfolio, or to parallel, or multiple portfolio, and to see
9788.36s:  if what he's reporting in or on Reddit mirrors what he's tracking in his
9801.80s:  port. Or in his excel sheet.
9807.24s:  Okay. Well, I got some instructions for the next one.
9811.48s:  Jonathan says, Eric, why don't you have a red headband complete oversight?
9819.24s:  That's because it's his. I have a tinfoil Viking hat. This is mine.
9824.68s:  I am again, I don't really copy people. I like to do my own shit.
9829.48s:  So this is exactly why.
9835.32s:  Okay. So we'll have to explore that because I don't know the answer to it yet.
9838.84s:  But what I want to see is if there's somewhere in one of these that shows us the number of shares
9844.52s:  he has, because then that will actually tell us a lot, a lot. And it'll help us explore a little
9852.36s:  bit more about the multi portfolio theory and like what it could look like. Because I do think
9860.68s:  that there's a lot behind the theory right from this from the jump, right? The fact that we see
9865.08s:  $100,000 here. And then we obviously can see that he has other stuff elsewhere right from the jump
9872.28s:  that it looks like he's kind of tracking in a centralized spot. And then likely executing
9878.92s:  in different places. So I can totally, totally see that. So yeah, I'm interested to see what we can
9886.36s:  learn from that though. Because here we can see the overall snapshot.
9895.24s:  All right, gang. It is time for me to wrap up. Go grab some dinner. Absolutely blast to hang
9901.32s:  it out as per always. I'm looking at doing a live stream with Peruvian bull this coming week. We
9907.32s:  shifted it from this past week because I had to go get the shots in the old disc. So we're going to
9914.52s:  try to reconnect. I think this coming Thursday at 1700 Pacific time. So come hang out. I think
9922.12s:  I haven't talked to him before. So I don't know much about his background. I just got connected
9926.36s:  with them. And I thought it would be fun to meet him. Have a conversation. Explore his understanding of
9933.00s:  you know, GameStop, what he's seen and you know, just bullshit a little bit about different ideas.
9938.20s:  So that's the game plan. As always, if any of you need anything, hit me up. I'm always around.
9943.16s:  Be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier ape, whatever most closely you identify with. But most
9949.64s:  importantly, enjoy the rest of your weekend. I'll see you all around. Take care.
