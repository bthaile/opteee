0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
181.00s: that is a side what we're looking at here is so far a really really really interesting
189.20s: saga and let's recap it quickly before we recap it you already know I gotta grab the
196.06s: chat I got to see who's here hanging out on Saturday getting ready to dive into some
200.56s: roaring kitty gme action.
203.08s: So I see we got coffee house test test confirmed we are alive and well we got catch me on
211.04s: who is here second Marcus trader Jonathan we got generational capital that's what we're
217.92s: all pursuing here so let's get to see Willie Derslup day swag sedric that Lauren is good
225.12s: and as you all know there's a bunch of familiar names to me at this point and that's probably
228.72s: means there's a bunch of familiar names for you too so hopefully you're making some friends
232.64s: along the way we also got mr. off Putin here hanging out beautiful all right so you're
239.12s: already know before we get too far into the weeds here we do have to grab my little gme live
244.68s: stream map and see if there's any updates we need to make to this so if you've already
250.36s: let me know where you're from you don't have to let me know but if you've not let me know
255.00s: where you're from let me know right now it looks like from a us perspective we really need
261.48s: to get some people in the central north I don't know if that's what sent I don't know is
267.16s: this called the what I guess it's the west what is this what do you call this not the I don't
272.96s: like the Midwest I think the Midwest is stupid so there's like this is actually I've never
278.92s: really analyzed the map this way because this is what like the center of the US if I were
282.88s: to eyeball a line is this right where's like the midline of the US because I know that we
290.80s: would call this the Midwest but I don't really get why because this is just like the west
297.20s: and then there's the east northeast makes sense southeast makes sense southwest makes sense
303.84s: northwest makes sense but this is kind of like the middle of the US that's the mountain
309.36s: west huh I don't know if I get on with that if you were to eyeball a midline through the
317.44s: US where would it be because to me I'm thinking it's something like here through Minnesota because
322.80s: technically main really skews us over to this side a lot so this would be like the center of the
329.04s: US is what like eastern Kansas slash Missouri something like that Jimmy says not many people live in
336.88s: Idaho Montana Wyoming Dakota's number yeah definitely that's why we need to get representation here
342.40s: because we have to fill these in we're very close we're very very close Jimmy says I'm in Denver
349.52s: Colorado it's considered the west if you go to Kansas or more east would be considered the midwest
359.28s: god that's fucking you've you've completely you got my mind in a blender
365.92s: yeah I'm in a blender I would consider Colorado the west
369.60s: because that's actually we're looking at moving here outside of Colorado Springs so we might be
374.96s: well for us it would be moving east because we're down here but I still think that that's west this
380.16s: where I started was in New York. Suppose Car says north central yeah that's what that's what this
387.52s: feels like to me is like north central US but I don't think that that's what we call it I don't know
394.00s: all right so let me see if there's any that we needed to add it looks like we need to add Roseville
398.08s: California and this is for via via label I was going to say via low bow because that's I don't
409.60s: know where my mind would go with that Roseville so just outside of Sacramento I think we have
415.84s: Washington representation already so we're good with Washington for worth I'm almost positive
424.40s: we have yep so there's Dallas for worth we'll call that good we do have a Mexican oh wait do
430.56s: we have a Mexican yeah so we do have a Mexican we need a Cuban we do have one South American which
439.52s: is good yep and then we need an African we need a Middle Eastern for sure
453.92s: Russian I don't even know if they can get on this but if they can that would be good
458.88s: I would like a New Zealander honestly if we can get in person from Iceland Greenland my if there's
465.12s: a way for one of you to find somebody from Madagascar to get on to one of these live streams so I
471.92s: can fill in that dot that would be magic I think I think that would be absolutely magical to have
478.08s: somebody from Madagascar because I don't know if I've ever literally met anybody I mean I think
483.20s: that is there even like cities or anything there or is yeah it looks like there's cities there's
486.64s: roads and everything shows you how much I know I don't know anything about Madagascar yeah it looks
494.56s: like Madagascar all right we'll get started in just a second as we finish going around Madagascar
503.12s: I had a boss when I was in the Marine Corps he wanted to go to Madagascar when we were in Australia
508.08s: that was like one of his game plans but he never had a chance to make it over there we'll do like
513.76s: a little street view real quick and see all right what's going on here uh that I mean that looks
520.64s: like civilization over there done it yeah let's check this out
531.12s: oh yeah yeah I feel like they have it this this feels like they have internet if not I mean you
538.24s: get a star link now daddy Elon takes care of that for everybody yeah this looks this looks like they
546.16s: would have internet's not like completely out in the middle of nowhere all right and let's grab like
550.48s: some random ass spot Madagascar really quick where do you guys want to go north or south Madagascar
555.28s: I want to see if I can find something that's like out in the middle of nowhere I think that would be
559.20s: really cool uh Wiggly says who needs civilization when you have empty land to sit in yeah north east
568.08s: got it let's do northeast uh let's click this this looks good oh this reminds me of like
578.88s: Costa Rica this is like straight up rainforest action that's not what I expected from there oh
586.96s: let's check out the coast really fast is there anything that's close to this coast that we can click
592.00s: come on google here we go a new google would keep it real for us who knew
604.88s: not at all what I expected not even remotely what I expected that's fascinating I genuinely thought
616.72s: that that was going to be like a sandy beach I did not expect that at all wow that's so cool okay
625.92s: so yeah we definitely need someone to get us a representative from Madagascar it feels like
632.32s: that that's got a that's got to happen okay so I think we're caught up on the updates here though
637.20s: yeah Costa Rica is sick completely completely agree Jimmy says I honestly pictured all of
646.96s: Madagascar as a jungle I think that that's like a really fair cop right like I think
651.68s: because this looks very deserty and then this you could tell is like super tropical up here so
660.08s: yeah that's absolutely fascinating Eric it sounds like you visited have you been to the Pacific
668.24s: or Caribbean side of the country both yeah I've been to both I essentially I've been I've been
673.92s: super fortunate I've been a lot a lot of places at this point in my life but one of my favorite hobbies
678.00s: is actually scuba diving so pretty much everything that's in this area I've hit like I've been out
686.00s: here to the Galapagos yeah I've been through yeah pretty much most of the Caribbean I've been I
691.60s: haven't been to Cuba because the I was still on active duty for most of the time and Cuba was still
698.64s: you know communist not not a lot to go there for military people especially with like if you have
703.36s: a clearance they don't let you but pretty much everybody else everywhere else in the in the Caribbean
711.84s: have been all right so now pivot over quick recap where where are we at we've now left
718.32s: Madagascar and we have now teleported to the end of January of 2021 and we've gone through how many
726.24s: trades have we done so far I haven't even counted how many is this 31 trades well 31 position
733.36s: updates I should say it's definitely more trades than this and day swag says I'd love to buy a
738.40s: house one day in Jamaica so I can be with my family I've been to Jamaica and I have to be honest
743.12s: I didn't have a great time Jamaicans in general that I met were awesome the part that I didn't really
750.96s: like is they kept stealing shit from us that got a little old every time that we would try to I like
757.28s: snorkeling and scuba diving so every time we would try to find a spot on the beach to be able to go
762.72s: in and like snorkel we would try to put our stuff somewhere and that this shit was gone like almost
769.36s: every time that got super frustrating so I just wish they didn't have to take my shit when I
774.80s: went in the water because most of the places that I've been in the Caribbean it's kind of like the
779.28s: exact opposite where it is much it's like there was a place when I was in um grain came in no
787.84s: came in bracket the smaller came in island I had to go get a buddy from the airport there and we
792.48s: were figuring out because like they didn't have like Uber or Lyft at the time so we're like figuring
796.96s: out how we were going to get over there literally we were sitting at a bar not drinking we were grabbing
801.36s: lunch because it was like midday literally the the bar tender was just like oh just take my car
808.24s: literally that that's like that's what it was like on came and brach and at first that sounds
814.00s: crazy right it's like take your fucking car like who would who would offer that but then you also
819.92s: realize that there is literally nowhere to go came and brach is tiny we wrote around it on a bicycle
826.24s: so they have like a very home style feeling there and when I was in Jamaica it wasn't quite like that
834.00s: the other place that I had that kind of experience was the Dominican Republic they because the other
839.36s: thing is when I traveled to these places I I do not do the resort thing I'm very active so I like
846.88s: to rent a car everywhere I go I like to drive everywhere around where I go and in the DR they
853.92s: I had to give them money so that they didn't take take my wallet and then in Mexico they do that too
860.88s: but in Mexico they do that to everybody so yeah there's a couple places that are like that that are
866.80s: a little more exploitive I would say but I mean the other thing is I don't know some people especially
871.76s: from America we feel some type of way if you get extorted like that but for a lot of these other
875.84s: places it's just like it's annoying nobody likes it but it's just kind of like how a fucking goes
880.80s: right so like if you have to pay a like I had to pay the Mexican cops like 80 bucks and it like is
886.80s: what it is right you just fucking pay them the 80 bucks and then you just keep going with your day
891.28s: and the funny part about that too was when I met up with the dive boat like the people I was diving
896.16s: with that's when I was driving from I was driving up to La Paz so it was like way up out there
902.00s: and it was so funny because we were coming up to a stop sign and
909.20s: the the funniest story and then we'll get into growing kitty I promise but we were coming up
914.32s: to a stop sign and we were out in the middle again like towards La Paz not quite there yet so like
920.00s: there was nobody else there we were straight up the only white people and I don't blend in with
926.56s: Mexicans there are some lighter hair Mexicans but everything about me doesn't say you know this
932.64s: guy's from here obviously so we're coming up to the stop sign I literally can see a cop sitting
938.96s: on the other side of the stop sign and I look over to my passenger and I'm like yo nobody is stopping
947.52s: at the stop sign and I have this conversation I see a cop at the other side of the stop sign
954.00s: this is going to feel weird but I am going to come to a complete stop at the stop sign because I
959.12s: can see the cop right there watching this stop sign sure as fucking shit I come to a complete dead
966.72s: stop do the count two seconds thing I start pulling off they pull us over and I don't speak
972.96s: Spanish well but I can understand it okay and he was he literally told me that I didn't stop at
978.96s: the stop sign and I literally just started laughing because he knew I stopped I knew I stopped but
985.44s: I also knew what was going I knew what time it was and I literally just asked him I was like want
989.60s: to play still like how much is this going to be for me to not stop at the stop sign and he's
995.60s: he was funny about it he was just like he's like oh he's like you know we just we just need to go
999.44s: get lunch and I was just like okay I was like you guys getting drinks with your lunch or is this
1003.84s: like a normal lunch and he was like he's like 200 bucks will do and I was just like 200 bucks
1010.24s: I was like dog what the fuck are you smoking and I open up my wallet I never keep all the money when
1015.44s: I travel like in that will billfold I squirrel most of it away and I was just like dog I have 60
1021.52s: bucks will that work and he's like if you if I had a password with me he's like if she is
1027.20s: she has another 20 we'll call it good so we had a fucking pay these dudes 80 bucks and then
1031.28s: you know we kept driving but the same token they had no tolls so I guess you just kind of count
1036.40s: that as a toll who's so fucking funny so yeah learn a bunch of lessons there because in the DR
1045.36s: they try to take my driver's license so I actually take an old driver's license so that and I put
1051.44s: that on the top because what they try to do to extort you is they'll say they'll take your driver's
1055.92s: license they won't give it back to you and then they'll say bring me like follow me to the to the
1062.72s: police station that's what they try to do they try to bring you to the police station so it
1069.52s: I found it works really well if you have essentially an old license or something that you don't
1074.48s: care if they take and then you just drive to the fucking hotel because they won't fuck with you
1078.16s: at the hotels because the hotels will stand up for you because they obviously are trying to get
1084.72s: tourism and industry going there which stuff like bribery really nukes because it's not super fun
1090.40s: like I wouldn't go back to Jamaica at this point I think it's a beautiful place I liked it but
1095.36s: I didn't like all the the fuck fuck games there so Steele says bro is laughing about getting
1100.32s: robbed aty bucks dude it's all life experience yeah it was the the circumstance of that pullover
1106.32s: was the funniest fucking thing because I had an entire conversation with my passenger about stopping
1112.16s: I came to the most obnoxious full stop you could possibly come to and then the first thing he says
1117.92s: to me is you didn't stop at that stop sign it was I was just like it's pure comedy it's pure fucking
1125.28s: comedy and I was just like well just fucking see how much it takes to get out of here so I mean
1129.76s: that's also just getting used to the way that the world works right because westerners the idea
1134.72s: of like bribery is crazy right the idea of like trying to pay a cop off on the side of the road is
1139.84s: like the fucking wildest thing on earth but in a lot of the world that's that's how these
1146.00s: motherfuckers get down it's how you move around so you just kind of take it for what it is and I mean
1151.20s: I like 80 bucks right like we're okay they didn't fucking bother us more than that these are just
1156.56s: some dudes trying to make some fucking money I don't agree with that I think it's fucked up but
1160.72s: what am I gonna do right H has it the exact way pay to play you kind of know what you're doing
1166.72s: when you're getting there and it's all good you just fucking you you now have a hilarious story
1172.16s: to tell people because that is the foot that Lawrence says I've heard Russia is worse Russia yeah that
1179.92s: that place you got to be super careful I've never been there so I can't say but I've have friends
1183.60s: that are from there and whatnot and that's a different ballgame because yeah they play they play
1188.88s: hard and they go hard in the paint so yeah all right so should we start with diving into the
1197.76s: trades or do you guys want to do a quick recap of GME activity last week I am cool with either or
1205.04s: we can start with whatever makes you happy I was looking through we got to 2021 so there's no way
1211.44s: we're gonna get through the rest of his trades today I just don't see that happening
1215.12s: um so I'm guessing this will probably be like a six part series give or take just because there's
1221.76s: there really is so much with all these trades to to keep track of yeah okay so we'll
1230.40s: it looks like esoteric you've been strongly outvoted and we're gonna run through a quick recap so
1236.80s: let's let's get that going so first and foremost let's grab GME um okay
1244.40s: so there's a few things that I saw from a high level I'm not gonna go super far into detail
1248.64s: on like price action and stuff like that because one it is what it is to I did a video on Thursday that
1255.20s: talks about some of that so I don't want to waste uh too much of your time with that if there's
1260.32s: questions obviously happy to answer but from a general perspective what I would highlight for you here
1266.64s: is that game stop clearly once the at the market concluded game stop really started to find
1274.32s: a little bit of strength and here's a really really important point to the strength that I see
1280.56s: if I show you the Russell what do you notice different about game stop versus Russell and I'll
1288.56s: make this a little easier to to track here so if I throw game stop up top and then I throw
1293.68s: Russell down here and then I'll change both of these to a three month daily to get a slightly
1298.80s: better scale what's the difference on the week that you notice there really important
1305.28s: and I'll explain why this is so important but how do they do on the week comparatively
1311.04s: and the reason why I think this is so important to highlight for you is because when I look at
1318.24s: H says inverse there you go they they finally broke the correlation because for quite a while
1324.88s: when we look at game stop we can clearly see game stop was actually struggling a little bit
1330.16s: and a big part of that I think was the larger small cap space coming under fire just having pressure
1338.64s: now with the post earnings drop and even still small caps are showing upward strength a little bit
1348.96s: a downward pullback but still upward strength but the relationship is now generally broken
1354.64s: in a short term time frame because if we go to like 916 into the to the 19th
1361.04s: game stops going down while smalls are going up then we have smalls from the 19th into the 25th
1367.76s: going down then we have game stop going up so this definitely looks like it was largely suppressed
1374.00s: and then it starts rebounding back up and out so we have to absolutely track the relationship
1382.00s: between these because it helps us understand the perspective price movement for sure
1387.12s: roaring titties here everybody big giant shout out to fan favorite roaring tittie
1392.00s: roaring tittie says do we get to talk any tinfoil later you know I'm always down I literally
1396.96s: had my wife construct for me a tinfoil hat so yeah as soon as it's time to get into theories
1404.72s: I am so down but from a price action standpoint there's not really any theories here this is
1410.72s: unfortunately looking at boring cold hard data that is what it is right who likes that stuff
1415.12s: what it's like that's like the stuff for nerds you know it's like when I think about
1419.52s: when I think about the stuff that I like typically look at I realized it's like no wonder why
1423.68s: nobody likes this shit I don't know why I do but I do so that's the first thing I see with respect
1432.00s: to game stop and its behavior around the indices specifically small caps which I think is very
1439.68s: important to flag okay cool that point's been made now let's go back and take a look at a
1446.56s: couple other things that I want to flag for game stop specifically the first thing is I'm seeing
1453.12s: volume tailor off but not drop entirely that's another exceedingly important point right now
1462.16s: so if I go into this space in here right so this space being pretty much anything from the fifth
1469.92s: of august into earnings almost I can see overall volume is very very very right so I can see volume
1482.08s: here is six and a half six five four three five three and a half three and a half three point one
1488.56s: three point three four four point seven so on and so forth right so we're talking like sub five
1493.84s: almost this entire time then we get in here we have on the 20th 62 million shares transact that
1503.36s: drops to 13.9 12.1 6.15.7 and then takes back up to 7.4 so when we look at this volume activity
1517.84s: it's it's showing me a different structure a different behavior pattern than what I see here
1524.40s: and then also even from what I see in here and as always I am a data driven trader I'm going to look
1533.28s: for other cues symbols pieces of information to help me construct the broader thesis of what I
1540.48s: think may or may not be going on but what I can objectively say is that it is not supremely
1546.88s: quiet still it is below average volume periods that is not surprising at all I'm looking at relative
1555.76s: volume for five and 20 day periods and there's no shock the reason why there's no shock is because
1563.12s: there's going to be a massive spike in volume around earnings that's super normal then we have the
1569.92s: at the market that obviously is going to contribute to some of this and then we have the post at the
1574.96s: market that obviously is going to contribute to some of the compression being relieved so now
1580.64s: when I look at this I still see elevated volume and I'm very curious to see where it goes so
1589.44s: Sam Cleman says what's your price target for your long shares I don't have one it's because
1594.08s: I'm not really trading the long shares the long shares I've told you guys this a while ago
1599.20s: the long shares that I have on it's literally just to show some love to the ape community and
1604.80s: to move in solidarity with you all there's another one that I already told you I also have shares
1609.60s: in AMC and that's again from a bet that I made on a live stream like literally I think like three
1615.04s: years ago or some shit so for something like for the game stop shares the AMC shares it's no target
1622.32s: it's literally just shit that I'm holding to show some love now in terms of like the trading though
1627.52s: because for me I trade game stop with options I trade most things with options because that's
1632.08s: my bread and butter and I like the way I can construct trades but right now I am in no specific
1640.24s: fashion to do anything with options I traded a little bit of this breakout that I immediately
1648.24s: flattened the next day and the reason and I didn't even catch most of this breakout I essentially got
1654.08s: into on the 20th I just jumped in when it was breaking above this kind of this volume profile
1660.88s: right here this node so it's like when it was at 20 and a half and then I got out when it was like
1665.52s: 2190 right so it's like a point and a half move it really was nothing to write home about but
1671.68s: it's just to essentially gain a little bit of exposure to the movement because I do know that it
1678.64s: tends to exhibit some follow through but right now I'm still just trading primarily short calls
1684.00s: against the long shares which I know some people don't like that but I'm not going to not say it
1688.96s: because it's what I'm doing and I'm going to always keep it a buck with you guys so yeah I don't
1694.32s: say that because I want games stop to go down or anything like that but it's because I'm a
1698.88s: fucking trader so that's the way that I'm built so yeah that's the main thing that I'm doing right
1706.00s: now but yeah really no price target just yet the one thing I will flag as well is that we are now
1712.88s: firmly into this point of control and the reason why I think it's important to highlight this point
1717.52s: of control is because it's actually quite persistent across a few different time frames so that
1723.76s: tells me that there are a lot of transactions happening right around this handle so we have one point
1729.36s: of control on the short term time frame it's really difficult to see but there it comes out to here
1734.72s: so that means that there's a lot of volume at that price handle being the the 22 handle and then
1739.92s: the next point of control above that is literally right up here around the 25 handle so there's a ton
1745.12s: a ton of people interested in transacting at these levels and again you have seen I've not drawn
1750.64s: any new lines on this for a really long time these are the same lines in terms of support resistance
1756.72s: lines as far as I see it these I actually can take off for the time being because these don't really
1760.96s: matter these are all built off of that squeeze but I am not drawing any sort of news support
1767.44s: resistance I've kept these the same this one realistically is going back further I actually would
1772.64s: keep that one closer to there so I think we can modify that one and I think this represents more
1778.64s: less what I see here so yeah roaring clases did you DRS your shares I didn't it's just held through
1787.68s: the brokerage I do have them turned off for for loaning but I don't have them DRS and the main reason
1795.84s: is because it's kind of an annoying process to go through just again keeping it a buck with you
1802.32s: so I keep everything within within the same brokerage platform yeah roaring titty says he doesn't
1809.52s: realize he's one of us I really appreciate that but I continue to remind you guys I I don't like the
1815.36s: idea of like considering myself in ape because I I'm still relatively new to this you most of you have
1822.96s: been along most of my journey with this and I started paying attention to like the story the
1828.00s: background primarily from I would call it may is when I started getting more into it so I still feel
1835.60s: like I'm too new to it so it doesn't feel right to like because I have a lot of respect for the people
1841.68s: that have been following this for a long time like every time that I talk to somebody like Newton
1847.20s: who's been following this thing as close as he has like I obviously would completely consider him
1852.64s: in ape and I think he's like deserved the title so to speak but that's the that's the thing I don't
1859.36s: know I feel weird about trying to take a title that I don't necessarily feel like I deserve or
1864.88s: that I've earned yet not that it's like you know this big prestigious thing but a lot of it it comes
1868.72s: from my time in the military right like we we want to earn whatever it is that's a big part of the
1875.60s: psyche so I definitely am doing my best to like learn about the story learn about the background I'm
1880.96s: I still literally text with Newton almost every single day to bounce ideas around and to learn a little
1886.32s: bit more but yeah I still feel like I haven't put in the time yet because there have been people
1892.96s: in this thing for four fucking years well three three and change which is a long time man so I
1899.36s: still consider myself a bit more of a guest and it's again it's more just out of respect than anything so yeah
1911.60s: generational capital says do you sell covered calls not covered I essentially will never
1915.76s: sell covered calls but I always sell calls at a ratio so yeah I really like ratio covered calls
1924.72s: but that's essentially what I have on now in GameStop and the reason why I do that is because I don't
1929.44s: want to cap my upside and I'll walk you through again for anybody that's not seen it I'll always
1935.92s: show you this because I think it's super super important
1943.52s: here so if I have let's say for example again this is using my IRA pass through accounts there's
1951.28s: no money in it it's just blank this is also going to be regulation T so but let's say if I have
1959.60s: 25,000 shares of GameStop and I'm not going to get rid of these other positions because most of
1969.84s: these are the cats which I'm going to have to go back through this was an example that I did
1976.48s: recently so I can kill these two so let's say that there's 25,000 shares and let's say the
1981.60s: basis is like 19 now in the trade right now it's up 86 grand or whatever cool now here's the problem
1991.60s: when if I come in here and I sell calls against it and you'll notice something as I click this
2001.44s: button more and more times you're going to see that that right hand side is going to move further
2007.44s: and further down so if I kind of fast forward our time a little bit and pretend that this is at
2012.64s: a one to one ratio so if I have 25,000 long shares and I sell 250 calls against it which represents
2018.96s: the same size you'll notice a really really problem like a big problem and it's specifically that
2026.88s: the like we lose our upside profit potential which I have no interest in doing that even though I
2033.36s: really have no real game plan to sell the shares again I've already told you that just being
2037.84s: completely honest it's still just anti the way that I trade so I'm still going to generally apply
2043.20s: the same fundamentals that I would so in this kind of instance when I look at something like this
2051.44s: instead of doing like 250 if I sell something like a hundred calls well you'll notice that I get
2057.44s: plenty of upside potential still I'm not giving up a ton of upside but then I can still collect
2063.44s: fairly meaningful amount of premium against those options so that's the general idea here
2071.36s: it allows for a little bit of income generation or just taking in premium when things
2078.64s: are going sideways it helps generate some profit but I wouldn't want to give up upside
2085.68s: essentially ever and because here's why this is the entire reason why if we look at this position
2093.84s: guess what we now have capped profit potential right we know how much we can make right from the jump
2100.64s: we are stuck at $138,000 fine here's the issue if we look to the left hand side we are still taking on
2112.80s: the entire downside risk profile the entire downside risk profile so what I'm doing is I'm taking the
2120.96s: downside risk but I don't get the profit potential I don't like that and it's exactly why I don't
2127.52s: typically mess with covered calls at all and anything I trade it will always be at a ratio
2134.48s: and that so that I can appreciate to the upside it's a big part
2139.84s: I think that's a lot of work.
2145.84s: Christian says ape that's what I would say that's hilarious
2150.08s: Steele says don't worry you're a GME enthusiast as Newton would say yeah I think that that's
2154.00s: completely fair I am absolutely a giant enthusiast of GME the entire I've told you guys this a
2159.68s: million times and I'm always happy to say it again because it's so fucking cool but I've been
2163.68s: trading a long time right like I'm coming up on my 17th year of trading and trading has changed my
2168.72s: life it's why I do the whole YouTube thing it's not because I belong on a camera but this is such a
2174.96s: curious story everything about it and that's why again if you'll notice at the beginning of the
2180.24s: stream when I was talking about the cat I am beyond infatuated with the way that he does things
2186.72s: because it is so anomalous so it's like I'm looking at something like if I'm looking at nature
2194.08s: that's what this feels like I'm looking at nature being the stock market and I'm seeing something
2198.64s: that doesn't fit in with anything I've ever seen before so I can't help but keep looking at it
2204.48s: because it's so strange absolutely super super strange so yeah I think that's a great way to
2214.24s: I think it's a great way to frame it.
2217.68s: Rowan Titi says why do you think so many people haven't left GME it's not only the squeeze it's
2221.76s: the story definitely and that's one of the things I love about the the apes I learn a lot from you
2226.56s: guys that's one of the that's it's one of the very neat things about this is that what you'll
2232.24s: find is there's a lot of things that I think apes generally lack knowledge of and that's not to
2237.92s: throw shade but it is what it is but there's a lot of very interesting things that apes know in
2245.60s: insane amount about and I get a chance to tap into some of those things over time which is actually
2252.72s: really really fun for me I'm a big fan. Willy says thoughts on GME maintaining price above 19
2260.56s: post two sizable dilutions demand that's that's exactly what that tells me and I talked about this
2266.40s: before even when it started catching on this thread down here the fact that it dropped down to these
2273.76s: levels and then continued to get bit up it tells me that people do absolutely value this thing at a
2281.44s: certain level and this is before even when they did that first offering I think one of the biggest
2288.08s: things about the first offering is that provided a absolute exit for a lot of systemically short
2298.80s: positions that were able to now access shares relatively easily and that gave them a big out but
2308.32s: before that this was being systemically shorted massively so the fact that in those conditions
2314.56s: it didn't get bit down heavily it tells me that there's demand for those shares so yeah I think
2321.20s: without a doubt the fact that this is continued to hold these handles is really really important
2327.36s: because it starts alluding to what the intrinsic value of the stock might be perceived to be which
2334.88s: is not to be confused with whatever we try to calculate its cash value at people obviously
2342.64s: still value the brand the intellectual property which is a really important thing to see that it's
2349.20s: not simply being valued at cash so yeah for sure for sure.
2357.84s: Doctors A says you may be a rookie but you're like a top five draft pick yeah I am a rookie
2363.04s: I've been looking at again it's been what like four months I'm very very new to this
2367.92s: so Christian says guest ape yeah I think I do view myself as a guest I think that that's fair
2377.04s: Sam says any of y'all watch Jackie 2 between him Richard and this the different
2382.48s: perspectives are fascinating got it I don't know anything about Jackie I've heard some of you
2388.64s: mentioned him before but this goes back to the other thing is like I and I talked about this on
2394.64s: my standard YouTube channel videos and live streams and stuff like I don't watch anybody shit
2399.52s: because I just kind of do my own thing I think the main thing is with somebody like Newton
2405.84s: because I don't really catch all of his videos either but I'll talk with him and the thing with
2412.16s: Newton is like he was unbelievably unbelievably gracious and useful for me like when I'm developing
2421.60s: my my background understanding of things and like understanding the qualitative components
2426.32s: that I'm not so sure about but yeah I don't really watch much of anything because most of the time
2435.92s: I spend the vast majority of the time like doing what I consider like doing work like I like to
2443.84s: go in look at things for myself and even when I have conversations with somebody like Newton
2449.28s: the main thing with him is he has a lot of background information but I still like to go in and
2455.84s: validate what I'm seeing and it's just because I understand how humans perceive things and again it's
2462.64s: because I've been trading for a long time I understand all these different cognitive biases
2466.16s: confirmation biases availability biases all of these different kinds of things that kind of paint
2471.44s: the way that we perceive information which I guard so heavily against because my entire objective
2478.88s: as a trader to be is as objective as humanly possible in the analysis of things so yeah I spend
2487.36s: so much time doing that personally but I think that for anybody that watches stuff obviously I would
2494.00s: always 100% recommend Newton like Newton I think you cannot go wrong with because he has so much
2501.68s: qualitative background from a trading perspective like I don't trade the way he does I can tell you
2506.88s: that for sure but with like the trading element aside the amount of information that he has and he's
2515.68s: taking the time to build around this thing is like just straight up second to none I haven't met
2522.08s: many other people that have the the background that he does so yeah I am I literally am a massive
2530.08s: fan of Newton and anytime anybody asks me about GameStop I literally always direct them to him
2536.72s: because he's the dude the thing when it comes to like looking at when it comes to looking at again GameStop
2545.12s: I would trust my eyes analyzing the stock and analyzing the options and analyzing the movement over
2551.44s: anybody else and that's not to say that you know I'm better than anybody else it's just I trust my
2555.84s: eyes I trust my experience but when it comes to taking a look at the the breadth of the story how
2564.56s: things have evolved the characters I literally called Newton the GME scribe because he is straight up
2574.08s: the the scribe that has tracked just about everything about this so yeah
2583.52s: Dr. Sayas says need to have balanced views yeah and I think that that's one of my favorite things
2590.32s: about for that's one of my favorite things about Newton is even when he and I before before he
2595.44s: started getting back to work and he's you know like super busy now but before he started getting
2600.48s: back to work and all that when we did a few live streams together you can see that he and I
2605.44s: very frequently would go back and forth right because we have no problem challenging one
2611.04s: another's thoughts and it's obviously out of nothing but deep respect in trying to understand
2616.72s: and I I gathered that from him from the jump he and I both are literally seeking to understand
2624.40s: and I cannot tell you how much I identify with that because I genuinely do not care very much
2632.32s: about whether or not I'm categorically right or wrong I care about the assumption of information
2639.20s: and data like that's what I care about if I have I there's a saying I use all the time strong
2645.12s: convictions loosely held I say that in my trading community all the time and it's because I think
2650.48s: we develop strong convictions by doing a bunch of research we have really well formulated ideas
2656.24s: they're loosely held in that as soon as there's good information that contradicts or sends us
2662.32s: down a different path I will dump the previous thing that I thought and held in high regard like a
2668.64s: fucking rock to pick up the new thing if they're supporting data and that's part of why I think I've
2675.52s: been successful as a trader is because I have no problem abandoning things because I'm not
2681.84s: attaching my identity to these different ideas the way I look at it is I'm analyzing information
2688.32s: I'm coming up with the best possible assumption I can with this information at a given point in time
2693.12s: and as soon as it changes I need to change period it's not a representation of who I am and as much as
2699.60s: financial media and social media as soon as you flip an idea most people like oh my god he's wishy
2706.32s: washy and to me I'm thinking what a dumb way to look at that of course if it comes to things like
2714.88s: values values need to stay adhered to even when it's inconvenient and stuff that's a completely
2720.40s: different conversation when it comes to I hypothesis about where something might go or the current
2725.60s: breadth of information what that indicates I drop it like a rock as soon as there's better
2731.60s: information available zero literally zero attachment to it strong convictions loosely help I think
2739.60s: that's the way doctors a says can you give an example of a conviction that you like go of
2745.12s: absolutely easy the the trading of vertical spreads the first several years that I traded options
2752.64s: we talked about this yesterday during the beginner live stream the first several years that I
2757.28s: traded options I used vertical spreads and it's because they balance a lot of things they're
2763.36s: reduced risk because they have capped risk and profit but you can they're super capital
2769.68s: efficient you can put a lot of them on and you can create really good probabilistic outcomes where
2775.04s: you win a lot I thought for sure vertical spreads were the way and I traded them a lot under that
2782.96s: premise then I started taking a really close look at the overall trading performance of the systems
2789.60s: and I was noticing as I started logging a little bit into my trading career I was looking at it and
2794.96s: saying I feel like I'm crushing it with vertical spreads and the reason why I felt that way is
2803.04s: because I would win a lot because they're high probability trades but for any of the options traders
2808.16s: out there you know there's a giant downside to them and it's that typically let's look at an
2814.48s: example together really quick we could look in game stop if I do a one dollar wide vertical spread
2820.88s: and typically you'll get something close to 30 cents for that the issue here is I'm collecting
2829.68s: $30 but I'm risking $70 so do the math I need more than two wins to overcome every single one loss
2844.96s: so even though I feel like I'm winning all the time because I am it doesn't fucking matter
2851.68s: because when I have a handful of losing trades it wipes out 2.3 times plus my winning trades
2859.68s: not including fees so as soon as I started taking a really hard look at that realizing that yeah
2865.12s: okay verticals they have a place but I was literally like flat I think I was up a little bit
2871.68s: money with them at the end of like several years of trading them I was like this is fucking trash
2877.20s: so I had been trading them for several years and then I literally pivoted it it was over a weekend
2882.56s: and I just stopped trading them entirely so that is an example for Dr. Zayas can you give an
2891.20s: example of a conviction that you like go of that's exact that's a massive one for me because I
2896.40s: spent a lot of time fucking with those and it just wasn't really worth the the time or effort
2902.56s: oh we have a New Zealander fleet hall let's see let's see if we have New Zealand new
2915.20s: Zealand we don't let's get the right spot then price to church damn that's like
2921.76s: not fucking illustrate there huh price to church like
2929.84s: damn like real specific isn't it sweet so now we have New Zealand that's fantastic um
2939.36s: fleet hall if you can whenever you get around to it find us somebody from pop a new Guinea would
2945.12s: you because they're like pretty fucking close and I feel like you can make that happen
2950.40s: and then also it wouldn't hurt for Tasmania if we can get like a lemur or some shit that would
2956.24s: be kind of cool and then we got Bangkok Thailand always good to have a Bangkokian
2966.40s: that's beautiful okay over there
2980.56s: MFN says do you think the GME option positioning Friday could lead to a ditty party type
2986.24s: action next week so we're gonna have to we're gonna have to really get into the ditty party
2993.76s: classification so that I'm on the same page as you are we inferring that there's gonna be a lot of
2999.68s: like roofies and then un really unrequested homosexual activity that's like one directional
3008.16s: or are we talking about something where there's just like a lot of are we talking about the
3014.24s: p ditty parties before or after midnight maybe that's the way to maybe that's what I need to say
3020.80s: so is it yeah is it gonna be pre midnight ditty party or post midnight ditty party because I think
3030.24s: that will be the the primary differentiator of how we might classify because I could see
3038.24s: GameStop GameStop price action being something like you know pre midnight ditty but I do think it
3047.36s: becomes a little more dangerous if we're kind of forecasting post midnight ditty party because then
3053.36s: that means like shorts are getting fucked pretty bad and I don't know if I see the conditions for
3058.32s: that at least as of right now who knows it can always happen but I don't see that amount of baby
3064.88s: oil in the options as it sits so yeah I think I could see pre midnight little bit of action some
3075.52s: surprise some half advances I think we could see the really awkward moment where you bring like
3085.36s: your hot girlfriend or your wife and you think ditty's trying to take your girl but then you realize
3090.88s: like ditty's trying to take you right that's that's like a different kind of fear I think that would be
3096.88s: part of that pre midnight thing and then I think the the post midnight is when the the doors are locked
3106.08s: and you're trying to find a fucking window to get out and ditty now has baby oil everywhere that I
3112.80s: don't think we're at that point yet I think the shorts felt that previously but I don't know if
3118.16s: they're going to be quite at that point in the near future so yeah, Roentit he says he did some
3125.68s: horrible shit to women he did he beat the shit out of that one woman I saw it I think it was him
3131.84s: in the in the lobby of the hotel I'm absolutely not saying that he he yes we yes I think the main
3139.04s: thing I'm just highlighting is that it's a it's a strange it's a strange happenstance when
3146.64s: you know most guys are slightly insecure you have like a really hot wife or something or a
3151.76s: girlfriend typically because it's not that committed yet and you're like yo I want to show my
3155.92s: girlfriend off but it's like you know all these guys are like trying to hit on her that gets a
3160.00s: little old and I think that moment that you realize that like ditty actually isn't interested in
3167.68s: the girlfriend is like more interested in you I think that's terrifying because then it's
3172.72s: it almost primes your brain where it's like wait a minute like maybe like my girlfriend right I
3178.08s: almost would prefer that that is really a masculating insecure but I think the process of like ditty
3184.96s: targeting me would be like real terrifying so yeah I mean he felt comfortable I saw clip where he's
3193.92s: like touching Mike Tyson's leg that's a different level of comfort like completely a very different
3202.96s: level of comfort and then and then Mike Tyson like moved his hand in ditty didn't even he didn't
3212.16s: care so it's like that's a that's a different level of comfort I would say yeah
3219.92s: so yeah let me know if that answers the question because I wanted to make sure that we got to the
3227.04s: bottom we always want to seek first to understand to understand again the the quality that we were
3232.40s: referring to and then I think we're there um James says when you say you sell calls at a ratio
3239.36s: what does that mean I gave an example what James I gave literally a straight up example did you
3253.04s: not see the example James we did this don't do this to me James you bastard I'll show you I'll
3263.12s: show you just because I'm a nice guy so in short the way that the ratio would work is we would have
3272.32s: a certain number of shares and then when we sell a call against those shares we would sell less calls
3280.08s: than the number of shares we have is all so the way to think about it is essentially you just need
3286.32s: over 100 shares because the fewest number of calls you can sell is one right you can't sell a half a
3296.40s: call and each one short call represents up to 100 shares of the underlying so in that context as long
3308.16s: as I have literally 101 share I now have unlimited profit potential now obviously in this case
3316.40s: I would have 100 of the shares covered in only one uncovered shares let's it's not really what I
3323.36s: would want right so ideally it would be at least something like 150 shares so now you have 100
3330.24s: shares that are covered and then you have 50 shares that are uncovered but the idea in general is
3335.92s: to strike a balance depending on what you want to see happen but most of the time like in this
3344.48s: example I wouldn't sell a call against it unless I had something like at least 500 shares
3349.60s: because the main thing is I don't want to sacrifice the profit potential so I want to sell calls
3356.00s: at a very light ratio against the longs maybe one maybe two here definitely no more than two
3363.12s: so yeah the idea is to try to make sure you're not capping your upside and you give yourself
3368.96s: the biggest ability to take advantage of the upside when it happens but that goes back into having
3374.08s: like a really really solid plan about how you're going to manage the trade as it gets there
3381.20s: because that's one of the things I actually have a video coming out next weekend next Saturday
3386.24s: that's about trading meme stocks with options and I've made a couple videos really geared more so
3392.96s: more so towards the ape community to try to help frame using derivatives in order to make like
3400.08s: better trade decisions so yeah that video come out and it'll talk about some of these things but
3406.00s: a big part is having a solid exit plan which I actually think the majority that I find of apes
3415.04s: they actually tend to not which always breaks my heart to a degree because the reason why I
3420.72s: breaks my heart is like you don't make any money without an exit plan like if there's not a way
3425.44s: to book profit then the only thing we do is watch something and show profit and then profit goes
3432.00s: away and then it was there but now it's gone with nothing really to show for it so yeah it's always
3440.00s: a little bit of a bummer when I when I see that age says what's an exit strategy is an arcade quote
3451.28s: yeah we saw that actually in here when we were looking at this stuff we saw him say that the
3457.20s: again the problem there is that he has an exit strategy and he's used it a lot because like I can
3463.92s: see him building the account by booking wins so he absolutely has an exit strategy there's
3470.72s: absolutely no literally no debate about it he joked as if he doesn't because I would make the same
3476.56s: exact joke just like I would make the joke of you know no matter what I do the stock market does
3482.48s: the opposite that's obviously not the case right because I'm fortunate I make a good bit of money
3488.40s: trading so it's like I make that joke because it's funny but it doesn't actually represent what I'm
3494.56s: doing it's the same thing here like him joking that he doesn't have an exit plan is literally just
3499.04s: a troll comment because he's having fun with people I think
3502.88s: said rick says with options you have to shares is different it's not that's like it's not different
3510.40s: that's the problem is when we look at let's take a look at this together really quick if and we'll go
3517.36s: into on demand we'll start getting a setup to go through the catch trades because we're here
3521.76s: so let's go back to 2021 and we need to be in February and it looks like February is his first
3529.84s: update so we'll go somewhere around here and I'll show you
3537.20s: so with game stop if you I don't know what it's doing here I don't know if this is actually what
3548.00s: happened if it actually went to this or if this is just on demand did it actually do this
3555.36s: on the first of feb is that right the crazy part is is I don't know yeah so it looks like it did
3561.84s: it looks like the last price was 225 so it looks like it actually did do this which is fucking nuts
3567.28s: so yeah so here for example this is a hilariously well timed example but first thing I want to show
3576.08s: you the very first thing I want to show you is the same thing I see every single time
3584.48s: before squeeze every single time I've looked at all of them volume is up massively not trivily not
3593.12s: a little bit volume is up when I'm trading the movements in game stop this is what I look at
3601.52s: because I will always reiterate this point game stop does not follow standard technical analysis
3611.20s: of course it does to a degree I want to be very clear that doesn't mean that like your standard
3616.16s: rules apply not at all right most people I notice when I say things they take the no meaning the
3622.48s: inverse but I don't often mean the inverse I mean a middle ground so what I mean by that is for
3629.44s: something like game stop let's say before this price move and started happening I had support
3635.92s: or resistance flagged at 3850 for whatever reason a lot of times other stocks that move more normally
3646.72s: will hit a line of resistance can always go through it but it'll typically bounce around it for
3652.96s: a little bit until we see if demand or supply is going to win out if demand does it'll go back up
3658.96s: through but there's normally a little bit of contention and I can show you that in just about
3663.76s: every other stock other than things that are prime for squeezes the problem when you're looking at
3668.80s: something that is essentially squeeze prone like this is it's a completely different rules set
3674.64s: and I've talked to you all about this now because I started kind of looking at the overall
3681.20s: amount of analysis that I've done right because I typically I quantify things I want to know what I'm
3686.08s: doing even with like the herniated disc bullshit that I have I started looking at it and I have like
3690.48s: 34 hours of research just into reading books studies podcasts learning about the back because
3697.04s: right now I've a fucking up herniated disc that I'm learning about so with game stop it's it's literally
3703.60s: light years past that at this point right like it's hundreds of hours that I've spent looking at it
3708.96s: studying not just game stop but squeezes the behavior of squeezes and it does not it does not
3717.20s: attribute well to standard technical analysis like if somebody drew a Fibonacci extension on this
3724.16s: I literally couldn't care less I couldn't possibly care less it doesn't it doesn't mean anything here
3731.20s: it if it gives a traitor ideas and it's useful to them beautiful I love that do whatever works for
3737.44s: you but what I can tell you is that as soon as there's some sort of condition that causes a movement
3743.92s: of price book your Fibonacci's book the resistance that you think is there right now in this case
3750.88s: game stop is up at 32 that is not because the structural business the valuation of game stop has
3760.32s: now changed and it's at 32 because of that it happened specifically because of structural constraints
3769.36s: that break standard price rule sets so that's why when you're doing things like technical analysis
3776.56s: in something like game stop you have to pay attention to the profit mechanisms in the signals that
3783.76s: correspond with the profit mechanism in this case of a squeeze they are highly unique they exhibit
3791.20s: defined behavior that I've already quantified for you to a degree the video that's going to come out
3796.56s: actually next weekend goes into way more of the quantifiable behaviors but the punch line is
3803.20s: when you're looking at something like this you have to understand how it behaves and then tailor
3808.72s: your analysis to how it behaves and again one of the things I can definitively tell you most people
3816.08s: know that I don't speak in absolutes but this is an absolute before every single squeeze I've
3823.84s: seen with game stop before the squeeze happens there is a massive expansion and volume every single
3832.32s: time now that does not mean again don't take the know of what I'm saying to infer that every single
3841.12s: time there's an expansion and volume it equals a squeeze because it does not right I can show you
3847.60s: right here volume here at this point went from 50 mil to 127 mil there was no squeeze here
3855.60s: I can show you another time back here will volume went from 13.2 mil to 305 mil there was no squeeze
3863.20s: here so it does not mean every time you see a massive expansion in volume it equals a squeeze
3871.60s: but I can tell you before every single squeeze there is an expansion and volume really important trait
3880.40s: to be aware of because when I'm structuring trades that's the exact kind of thing I'm personally looking
3889.52s: for it gives me a ton of clarity around what to look at and when to look so going back to the exit
3898.80s: plan part of this is if you have stock which I think was saidrick was saying that if it's different
3906.08s: with stocker did I fuck that up and did I say that that was somebody else hold on there we go saidrick
3913.52s: yeah so saidrick says with options you have to have a exit plan shares is different the reason why
3920.56s: shares is not different is that if I'm holding shares that I got here at $5.33 and game stop is
3928.40s: trading anywhere in here trading at 88 trading at 322 the difference is if I don't have an exit plan
3938.80s: for a certain price move then even though if I bought let's take a look if I bought
3946.00s: this is old examples leave that to working only let's say that I bought a hundred shares at
3956.08s: freebox we got in early we got in the elevator early we have a hundred shares
3961.76s: on that hundred shares at this point I'm up 30 grand nice big profit super super super big fan
3970.72s: great guess what if you don't book that profit or some of that profit or set a stop for that profit
3978.00s: or do anything to secure that profit as soon as game stop comes back down which it will I guarantee it
3986.32s: that is another trait of squeezes a preamble to the video that's going to come out next week
3991.84s: is that it always comes back down in price always comes back down in price and it's because of the
4000.64s: function that leads to a squeeze it's how they behave it is a structural irregularity that leads
4008.96s: to the price movement that's why the move is not sustained because as soon as the underlying
4015.36s: conditions abate price will return to its nominal level whatever that is so if we're trading a squeeze
4024.80s: and we hold it while it's up that's sick if we continue holding and do nothing it's going to come
4034.72s: back down and then then what you're holding a trade here that you had a hundred shares that was
4042.40s: up 30 grand and then as it comes back down to whatever its nominal prices let's say it comes
4048.00s: back down to like 15 well now you have something that's worth a grand big problem we've we've just
4058.16s: made a massive mistake because another thing traders do is forget that you can always re-enter a trade
4069.12s: so for me if I was trading game stop with shares for squeezes I don't do that I prefer options but
4075.20s: if I was using shares what I would do is set profit targets based on different levels that I would
4082.72s: scale out as it hit these different levels then as soon as game stop finishes its squeeze because
4090.00s: again it's going to anything that squeezes is going to finish at some point and return to some
4095.36s: sort of nominal level it's going to happen and then when it comes back down to whatever that nominal
4101.36s: level is I can just buy again I can just buy more shares but traders are so linear in their thought
4109.20s: process that they think like once they're out the trade's done and they just move on and it's
4115.12s: so silly because you've done all this due diligence you have all this research you have this
4119.92s: conviction you have something you like if nothing else has changed other than this temporary price
4126.64s: movement because we know it's temporary because we studied the profit mechanism as soon as that
4132.48s: abates we just get back in as long as nothing else has changed so yes you absolutely need to have an
4140.16s: exit plan whether you hold shares or if you hold options because otherwise you're just going to
4148.00s: watch the value of your account look really beautiful but then you're not going to hold any of the
4154.56s: money it's going to go away which is a giant problem and this is exactly why I can tell you this
4162.72s: is not what Roaring Kitty does because the account shows obviously selling positions for gains
4170.72s: but it also shows capital appreciation within the account you cannot do that if you hold something
4177.68s: as it goes up then back down it you have to take exits so great question though love that one
4188.88s: I got to do a switch over and I got to get into my watermelon we're probably going to have to grab
4195.20s: a mango orange in a little bit as a replacement oh damn give me one second just build some
4208.24s: cool how about that
4221.60s: the watermelon seltzer water is the way okay so are we all caught up
4226.88s: um
4231.92s: generational capital says you should start a squeeze watch list um I mean I inherently do by the way
4237.84s: that I scan markets so I mean for me it's kind of yeah it's something that I typically pick up
4246.00s: on when it happens not all of them obviously but squeezes for me a much smaller part of the way that
4254.08s: I I trade it's it's a much smaller part of the overall book but all right let's move this here
4264.24s: let's grab our little tracker and we got some work to
4272.08s: um that Lauren says I've held all the way up and all the way down like four times now this time
4276.64s: I do have an extra strategy and a re-enter strategy I'm not playing this time that's good
4279.84s: exactly that's exactly you cake the fucking money that's like make the fucking money
4289.20s: then if you could have made more money we call that a high class problem in trading if you've made
4296.00s: money and you could have made more money high class problem low class problem is you made money
4303.20s: then didn't make money that's a low class problem because if you not made fucking money make the
4308.32s: fucking money. I love that plan, Lauren. That's exactly correct. It is absolutely correct.
4314.40s: Could not, I literally could not possibly agree more with you there.
4321.04s: All right. So let's take a look. We did 29 Jan. So now we are here in one Feb. Let's get into it.
4329.68s: So one Feb, 21, we already know shit is going crazy. So the total gain that we're seeing is 21,
4341.36s: 222, 508.63. The cash in the account is 13 million, 817, 295.47.
4360.08s: And then the value of the account is now 35 million, 794, 795.47. Okay. So now anything change.
4377.68s: I see we're still holding the 16 April 2112 call. So no change here. And he's had this for a
4385.28s: little while now. And he has 50,000 shares, which let me double check where you was at here. 50,000.
4396.64s: So same, same shares. And here he has still the same 500. So he's holding 500 of those 16 April 12 calls.
4408.80s: And now 16 April 21 now the date is one Feb,
4418.32s: 21. I'm just tracking the DTE because this is one of the things I'm trying to identify. So 74 DTE remaining.
4425.76s: One of the things I'm very curious about is what's the exiting behavior around these different timeframes.
4431.12s: So that's where I'm keeping an eye on.
4433.44s: Roy and Clity says, wow, I think I was just called low class. Well, I didn't call you low class.
4438.96s: But if you did that, you do have a low class problem. That's true because you don't have to worry
4442.88s: about taxes because you didn't make any fucking money. You don't have to worry about what you're
4446.80s: going to do with the money you made because you didn't make any fucking money. You don't have to
4450.32s: worry about how much more you could have made because you didn't make any fucking money. So yeah,
4455.60s: I agree. Those are like general low class problems. Yeah. But you're not low class. I don't think
4462.40s: so at all. Semicrishin says a little voice is whispering that this data could be extracted with AI
4470.00s: and put an Excel. So we can just start the analysis point. Just a little voice. It actually couldn't
4477.04s: not well. And I wouldn't trust it. So for Semicrishin, if you want, you could absolutely do that for
4484.88s: sure 100%. But yeah, I think that you're going to miss a ton, a ton of detail.
4496.16s: Roryn Clity says, what if I did it so many times now? It's my identity. That's the cool part.
4501.92s: That is literally the cool part. You can always, always change your identity totally up to you.
4508.48s: There's no imperative at any point in your life. You get to decide who you are, what you value,
4516.24s: what you're about. And you've already told me before earlier in this chat that you have a different
4521.60s: fucking plan. So you now are not getting ready to deal with low class problems. You've already
4528.72s: outlined a plan to deal with a high class problem. So I offer to you, you've already changed your
4536.24s: identity by developing that plan. And then the next time we get a big squeeze, we're going to be
4541.68s: talking about what to do with your high class problem, which I eagerly await. Those are the fun
4546.72s: ones in general. So take that, Roryn Clity says, hi, I think that was someone else. Oh, I think
4556.32s: it might have been that Lauren. Well, just you too, do the same thing. Do that same exact thing.
4563.20s: Okay, so no other change here. Let's move on to two Feb.
4575.12s: Two Feb 21. And we have total gain. Seven. This is an important day. I can already tell you.
4587.52s: Seven, five, nine, eight. Seven, five, eight.
4594.72s: Got six three. This is a very interesting day, which I'm going to talk to you about in a minute.
4599.36s: Little cash is about the same. So 13, eight, one, seven, five, six, seven,
4609.68s: got six two. And then value is 22, 17, one, three, one, seven, got six, two. Okay, so this is an
4621.60s: important day. Why do you think that this is an important day in my opinion? There's a few things
4626.96s: that I see here that are really, really important to me. And then give me one second. I'm going to
4631.28s: let the dog out and grab another mingle orange.
4721.28s: All right. So here's here's the main thing that I see. When I look at the price movement between
4744.72s: these two days, and I look at the overall gain that he had, not so much on the shares, but on
4752.72s: these options. It's actually really, really important to note the difference between these, right?
4758.88s: So in this case, he was up 10.7 mil. The end of Jan, he was up 15.96 mil. From here, he was up nine.
4770.56s: So this goes back into the entire thesis that I have with respect to how he trades his options,
4778.48s: which is kind of the inverse so far of what I've talked to you all about in terms of
4785.12s: having an exit strategy, because the exit strategy here is not based on price. Now, again,
4791.44s: I'm not saying that he doesn't have one. He clearly does. But what I've have seen a few times
4797.28s: is because when I look at the way that he holds these options is a lot of times he takes them
4803.68s: in pretty close in time, but not always. So we have a couple areas that I really need to go back
4810.08s: once we finish going through all of these to dissect more in detail. Because here, for example,
4816.88s: that he got out of the 15 Jan 21s, the 17s and the 15s, but he kept the 10s and 20s all the way in
4825.76s: until like 10 DTE. And then he took the others ones in at one DTE, right? That's actually
4831.92s: funny enough. It's a very clear identifier to me that this is actually not a straight up solidified
4839.52s: plan at all. This is something that's kind of being worked out as we go, which is interesting.
4845.52s: Now, for those that don't know, I don't really care about eating that much,
4849.28s: but I do need some calories. So I'm going to have this little pouch thing. It's 180 calories.
4855.84s: And it is 12 grams of protein. It's apple, sweet potato, banana, almond, butter,
4860.96s: collagen, and lion's mane. And it will take me just a second to get down. It's pretty quick.
4877.04s: And then that's it. Well, 180 calories done. Don't have to worry about it. There's no chewing.
4883.04s: There's no fuss done and done. Hot nitrogen does it taste good? I like it. I think it tastes okay.
4891.20s: I think the I'll tell you the flavor. The flavor is apple pie. I don't know that I would call it
4895.92s: apple pie. I don't think it actually tastes like that to be completely honest. But yeah, it tastes
4902.00s: fine enough. I'm very much a utilitarian feeder. So I do not care at all about, well, that's a lie.
4911.84s: I mean, obviously I like good food, but I don't care that much. Like if there was a way for me to
4916.80s: have like a pill that could nourish me fully and never have to eat, I would pick that. I'm not a
4922.64s: foodie by any means, like even a little bit. Dr. Zayah says, what's it called? It's called ReUp.
4932.32s: I get him off Amazon. Long Swazie says, my son likes these as well. The funny thing is,
4938.32s: is like before I found these ones, which is like the adult version, I literally would have the
4941.84s: baby food version, which is always hilarious because I would be everybody would think like, oh,
4946.88s: you know, we're grabbing it for our baby, which we don't have one. I'm the baby. And the running
4953.60s: joke was that if we have kids that I'm going to be fighting the kids for their little, for the baby
4958.48s: food pouches, because I like them too. And I'm bigger than them. So they're going to have to figure
4964.48s: that out. That's going to be difficult, I think. So yeah. That's the main thing I see here.
4971.60s: The fact that he had this position that literally was up 15 million dollars. And then now it's up
4978.64s: only, only 3.8 million dollars. So this goes back into highlighting the risk tolerance. What he's
4986.72s: looking for. And it highlights a lot of the mindset that he's using here that again, I find very,
4994.48s: very interesting. So this I find interesting as well that he forecasted when he's backing off
5000.24s: the daily updates. I think he started them for a little while, but he like went before he was
5005.04s: doing like weekly updates. So we'll see what he goes to from here. So this is 3 Feb 21. And
5012.80s: it looks like no change. So total gain is 7, 8, 5, 3, 0, 0, 8, got 6, 3, get this out of the way. And then
5030.72s: cash 13, 817, 567, got 62. And then value 22, 425, 567, got 62. Okay. So same, same, no change.
5050.56s: He's another day in on these options 72 DTE. Easy update.
5060.64s: Vladimir says he already sold 500 of those April 16 calls.
5067.04s: Yes, he did it at two different points. We already know this. So he did it first on 25 Jan. He took
5073.76s: 200 down. And then on the 27th of Jan, he took 300 down. So yep, we know that
5084.64s: down here 19 Feb 21, 19 Feb 21. Now we are at we are down the 2825. That's nuts. That's absolutely
5098.48s: nuts. 2825, 130, got 64. That's nuts. Passes moved a little bit. So 11882702.71. And then value is
5116.64s: at 17397952.71. And knew it. So he pulled money out of the account here. He pulled a non-trivial
5128.40s: amount of money out of the account. He pulled a few million dollars out of the account.
5134.72s: Very interesting. And he doubled his shares. So now he added. So he's still holding these.
5151.60s: Please have 71 DTE. And then added. Let me come over here. Added 50 K shares.
5169.68s: Let me take a look. What was his prior cost basis? So
5181.44s: the prior basis here was 1489478947.
5195.12s: And then now we have 100,000 shares at 267986.
5213.04s: And now I'm seeing what he added his basis at. I'm going to grab a seat.
5243.20s: So it looks like he added the basis at 387025.
5254.08s: 7025. Interesting. Okay. So now we have end of update 26 Feb.
5269.20s: 26 Feb 21. And by Feb, I obviously mean Feb. I say we go through Feb and then we'll see
5281.92s: how many more there are. Like we'll do like a few more and then we'll get into some tinfoil hats
5286.48s: stuff if you guys still want. Because these ones should go pretty quick, I think. Total gain now is
5295.92s: 11952630.64. The cash in the account now is stable.
5309.44s: At 11882579.21. And then the value of the portfolio is at 26525329.
5324.00s: 2112252. There looks like a slight rounding error here, but not bad.
5345.76s: Yeah. Hot nitrogens says, why don't you put the dates in a format,
5351.12s: that sheets understand, so it would be easier to manipulate data later if you wanted.
5355.04s: Because well, one, these are dated how I want these I can just parse out pretty easily.
5360.88s: The really the entire purpose of this part of the analysis literally is just to get a fingerprint
5366.40s: for his trading. That's like the entire objective. So I already have like other sheets that have
5372.40s: already pulled all of his all of this stuff out. But I want I literally want to go through
5378.32s: line by line and look at it. It's the same thing when I look at a lot of people are really shocked
5383.36s: that like as a professional trader, well, a professional retail trader, whatever you want to call
5387.20s: it full-time trader, that I still actually largely prefer to manually input my own trades.
5396.16s: Like I still physically type them in versus automating it, which is not hard to do.
5402.00s: And it's an entire it's like it's literally based on an entire preference. So yeah, that's
5407.12s: generally why here at least. So he's still holding these. And now it's 26 Fab 21, 26, 21. So now we have
5418.48s: 49 DTE. So now these are starting to get to a point where something may or may not have to happen
5425.04s: at some point in here. These are other just scratches where I figured out the price of his other
5430.32s: stock purchases. I'll move this up here. So it's out of the way. And then here we go.
5441.68s: So now we have eight March. Eight March 21. And now little gain is 25. So he's up massively again,
5456.08s: 25, 816, 130.64. The cash and the account is about the same. So 11882936.46. And then the value here is
5478.48s: 40389186.46. So slight deviation in these, this looks like just extra interest earned,
5493.68s: something like that doesn't look like much. And we're still holding these.
5500.32s: So this is now eight March, eight March 21. And now we have 3090.
5517.36s: So again, this goes back to what we were talking about before, which is still very,
5522.48s: very, very, very much looks like he's managing these not based on.
5533.20s: Yeah, he's not basing it on some sort of profit target that I don't see.
5546.40s: Interesting.
5552.80s: Okay. So then let's go to 23 March. Oh, yeah, we're flying now.
5565.52s: No change to position size. Total gain here is 2391 to 380.64.
5575.84s: Cash on hand is 11882812.96. And then value is 38485.
5594.72s: 312. Got nine six. Okay. So he's still locked in there. And now the date is 23 March 21.
5606.16s: Now we have 24 DTE. So it's now I'm kind of getting excited because it's coming up on,
5610.56s: he's going to have to do something with these options soon. And I'm actually quite eager to see
5615.84s: when, yeah, when this happens. The other thing, the other thing that I find really interesting
5626.08s: is the same thing for 101 40 92. Interesting. So he does why? Like, why does he do this? So now he
5649.76s: wrote 24 March 21. I haven't really been able to figure out this. Like the posting pattern,
5660.56s: it's like erratic. And the one thing I see, it's like when it's making more money, he posts more.
5668.88s: I can, I can clearly see that. And then it's almost as like as he's losing money.
5679.52s: And then 24 March 21. Okay. Total gain is 14 805 130. Got six four.
5697.12s: Cash 11882812. Got nine six. And then value is 29,
5707.20s: 378, 062, got nine six.
5714.72s: Okay. And we're still holding these, which are now more DTE. So 23 DTE.
5723.68s: Now, the good part here is that these are so far, these are so far in the money that there's
5736.40s: no love lost to hold these at these point. Because with the underlying trading at 120 or you know,
5743.04s: over 100, these are like so, so far in the money. And then here 31 March 31 March 21.
5756.64s: Well, Roindtidy says you got to look at the events, not just the numbers. Yeah, tell me,
5760.48s: that's why we're doing this on the live stream. So you guys tell me what was going on on these days.
5764.96s: Because that's something we can definitely take a look at together. Because again, like,
5768.48s: that's why I'm tracking the the dates in between these is because it like I can see clear
5776.88s: tendencies between the posting frequency, right? So here we're up a million dollars.
5782.96s: Then we get a post two days after up three, then we get a post afterwards up 3.9. Then
5788.00s: essentially it started going static. So nothing happened. We're up 3.9. Then three days later,
5793.60s: we're up 7.9. Then a day after that, we're up a point two. Then we double. So it's a day after
5799.36s: that. Then we double again. So it's a day after that. We cut in half. So we get it a day after that.
5803.76s: Doubles again. It's a day after that. So like here, it's like clearly very exciting. Then we get
5808.80s: two days in a row where it's at 7.6 mil. And then it goes dark. And then as soon as we have this
5815.92s: 2.8 mil update on the 16th, seven days later, we get one that's at 12 mil. And he goes back to this
5822.32s: kind of standard cadence almost where, but then again, here we go from 23 mil to 14 mil. And now
5829.84s: we're getting another update on 31 March a week later. So really, really interesting.
5836.32s: Total gain here on 31 March is 25231 880. .64. And then cash is 11882911.02.
5856.32s: And then total is 39804 911.02. And we are still holding these. And now it is 31 March.
5875.36s: Which gives us 16 DTE. So we testified to Congress on the 18th. Yeah. And then he posted right
5887.04s: it. Yeah. So I don't think there's a good chance that this in here. I don't know when he got.
5898.08s: Do you guys know what was he deposed? Did he have to testify or did he choose to testify? Do
5903.92s: you guys know the answer to that? Because I do not. And I think that would actually be an interesting
5911.28s: data point. Because that would also inform some of his posts, I think.
5916.48s: Then we have 1 April. 1 APR. Everyone. 1 APR. And total gain here.
5934.80s: Is 25403 630. .64.
5947.20s: .64.
5948.80s: .
5950.96s: .
5952.96s: .
5954.96s: .
5956.96s: .
5958.96s: .
5960.96s: .
5962.96s: .
5964.96s: .
5966.96s: .
5968.96s: .
5970.96s: .
5973.68s: This looks like a slight rounding error. So it looks about the same and everything else is the same.
5979.44s: So now we have it on 1 April 21.
5985.76s: Which is 15 DTE still no change. And now as options are sitting at 9 mil gain.
5995.52s: So
6002.56s: and they're coming in on time. There's still so far in the money that he doesn't really lose much
6007.04s: by holding them. So he's not like bleeding a bunch of theta. So I don't think he cares so much
6012.64s: about like theta to care optimizing for that at all. The
6018.64s: .
6020.64s: Willie says what's RK strategy so far anything noteworthy. I think it's two things.
6030.64s: It's definitely obviously playing the appreciation of GameStop.
6036.00s: The parts that can found me is that I don't think the cat actually thought GameStop
6046.24s: would be worth $200 in like a natural valuation or over $200. Like I don't actually think he
6054.08s: thinks that because he's a value investor he knows better. So one of the things I find really
6059.52s: interesting is that he continues to hold some of these positions as they're ebbing and flowing
6064.32s: at these much higher price levels. And he's just kind of like seemingly holding.
6069.84s: And that is really interesting because again part of the game is understanding the profit mechanism
6079.76s: of what you're trading. So here again he's smart. So he knows what he's doing and he knows that
6092.48s: a squeeze doesn't materially change the value of a company. So as it's going through a squeeze
6102.16s: I know that he knows that this is a temporary thing. So with that as the case I think a big part of
6113.28s: what he's doing here at least seemingly oh fuck I messed this up hold on sorry. This one's 15 DTE.
6122.00s: And then this one was 31 March 21 this was 16 DTE.
6130.56s: So these look like they're just based on like time. And this goes back I genuinely believe
6139.84s: off-put and says he's stacking shares. He's not like he already put on all the shares at
6144.16s: at least as of you know to to this point right because he added 50,000 shares back in 19 Feb
6152.00s: and he's been sitting on over 11 million dollars of cash. So he's not stacking shares.
6157.68s: He's obviously building shares when he wants. There's no doubt there. But he's done nothing
6163.68s: with shares in this. He's just adding periodically. And then he's holding these options for a really
6171.76s: long time. And that I find again it's from a trading perspective it's illogical to hold them
6180.08s: as he has. So then we have 16 April 21. And the total gain is 19902.
6196.64s: 513.833. The cash in the account is 3535248. That's 01. So we obviously used a bunch of cash here.
6216.32s: And then the value of the portfolio is 34473248.01. Okay. So the 16 April 12 calls are gone.
6237.44s: Now we need to figure out where they went. So to do that we're going to look at his new $200,000
6244.96s: position or 200,000 shares. So prior he had 100,000 shares. So if I have 100,000 shares
6262.16s: and the basis on that 100,000 was 26.7986. And now we have 200,000 shares. And our new basis is 55.
6284.16s: 55.1774. So the basis of the added shares. So let's see.
6300.64s: So the basis of the added shares was 835562. So added 100K shares at 835562.
6330.08s: And then the 16 April 12 calls sold I think. And we can confirm that really quick.
6342.64s: Because Putin says he exercised for 50 and then bought 50. It literally wouldn't make any sense to do that.
6353.12s: It would literally make zero sense to do that. So I do not think that that's what he did.
6363.28s: So let's see. But we can test the theory because maybe it is true. I'll take it as if it's true.
6369.12s: So we think we have 50,000, because the problem is 50,000 shares, 50,000 shares. So we have 50,000 shares
6377.12s: then at 12.
6378.64s: So if Putin says 154.69 plus 12 divided by 12 equals.
6390.64s: That again, I think you're looking at the wrong thing here. Because the last update that we got from him was on the first of April.
6406.64s: So when was this posted? Yeah, he absolutely did not exercise. I know for a fact he did not exercise.
6419.04s: Do you know why I know he didn't exercise? It actually makes the problem said even easier. That's don't even have to waste the time on that.
6426.88s: I know definitively he did not exercise. And he guess average the current share price with his 12 strike. It doesn't matter.
6436.96s: Unless he know maybe, okay, so no, I redact that. I don't know for a fact. That's true. I don't know for a fact.
6444.72s: But the reason why I strongly don't think he exercised is because if it's the April 16th and he took it into expiration, which is be the most logical place to exercise your option.
6460.16s: If you hold it into expiration, I don't think he exercised early. They wouldn't they wouldn't be added yet.
6466.72s: Because he posted this at 120 PM Pacific time on the Friday the 16th.
6475.44s: The he's his shares wouldn't they wouldn't be settled then the exercise literally doesn't happen that fast. It would be the next day that they're there.
6483.20s: So they wouldn't be there yet if he exercised. So if he did the logical thing, take it into expiration so that he's not giving up extrinsic value.
6492.64s: Then it's the 16th. If he took his options into expiration that were in the money with the intent of exercising them, which he absolutely could have done, then they wouldn't be there until the next day.
6506.64s: They wouldn't be in the account 20 minutes after the market closed on the 16th.
6510.48s: So I don't see that. And then off Putin says he paid 600 K to exercise. Yeah, that's just it literally doesn't make sense to exercise. That's the point.
6519.60s: It's one it literally doesn't make sense. So I don't believe that he did.
6525.84s: That is my best thesis right now is that I don't see I don't see that he did.
6537.60s: Mr. Overs says just be direct and tell us your bearish on GM. I'm not bearish. I have no again this this is the person or this is like the kind of people that I find like when they hear that I sell calls again shares, they think that that means I'm bearish.
6557.60s: If I hold shares, it's a bullish position. It's not bearish. I don't want the stock to go down if I hold shares. So no, that's absolutely not that's not correct. Not bearish.
6571.60s: I'm very direct with what I think about GameStop and in terms of the way it performs and in terms of and more over than that depending on what I want to happen doesn't matter.
6583.60s: TCM King says I don't think he could he could get that cost basis without exercising to get 50,000 and then bought 50,000. Yeah, let's take a look at that because that's a great point.
6595.60s: And that's I think the next natural segue. So let's see.
6601.60s: So essentially what we need to see is the price behavior between the first and the 16th.
6608.60s: So I think yeah, what do you know where I can get a non split adjusted chart?
6616.60s: Because that would be better.
6619.60s: Let's go to the end of April and let's see what this looks like.
6631.60s: Absolutely could have if this is even remotely correct.
6659.60s: Let's see. So we were talking about 50,000.
6669.60s: And then we think some of that might have been done at 12. It would have been technically 12.2 because that was his basis.
6678.60s: And then we'd have to figure out whatever the
6685.60s: we'd have to figure out whatever the residual would be.
6694.60s: Then this equals this.
6705.60s: And I'm just going to throw this into chat GPT will be a little bit faster.
6710.60s: So the original scenario is if I had 100 shares of stock at a basis of 26, 7, 9, 8, 6.
6717.60s: Now I have 200,000 shares at 55.1774.
6725.60s: Let's say I'm just going to say bought not going to bother telling it that I exercise anything.
6731.60s: So I bought 50,000 shares at 12.2.
6743.60s: What is the basis for the remaining 50,000 shares I added?
6753.60s: Let's see.
6760.60s: All right.
6799.60s: I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say
6829.60s: it like he could have bought those 50,000 shares any time in here, right? So any point during this, which we wouldn't know.
6837.50s: Off Putin says only 12 would come out of current cash, not 1220.
6844.60s: It's again, putting your looking at the wrong thing. I don't care if it came out of cash. Whatever came out of cash, doesn't matter to me right now.
6851.50s: All I'm doing is I can figure this out by basis.
6857.40s: That's all I need, right?
6858.60s: So when I look at the basis of the shares,
6861.10s: that's the equation that we're working with.
6864.08s: So,
6868.72s: Rowan Tady says some brokers auto exercise in hours
6871.70s: so before the close, right?
6872.72s: No, definitely not, absolutely not.
6874.56s: They would not do that.
6875.40s: Because exercise, again, exercise is done after the close.
6878.64s: So even if I choose to exercise my options in a day,
6881.38s: it's not gonna be settled and see them
6883.36s: until later in the day.
6886.84s: What does this say?
6888.48s: Thus the basis for the adding, yes,
6890.96s: see, I don't think it's right,
6892.04s: because then the added shares in this scenario,
6894.64s: the added shares would have been at $154.
6898.78s: 91124.
6901.68s: And I just don't think that's correct.
6906.08s: Because then his original position was 100,000
6909.86s: and then his basis in that 100,000 was 26.7986.
6918.26s: Total cost here equals this times this.
6930.50s: So then here,
6934.14s: well, off-putting the problem is is like,
6938.04s: and again, this is why I need a pre-adjusted chart
6941.60s: that I trust.
6942.80s: Because right now, I don't actually trust
6945.32s: what I'm seeing here in GameStop is accurate.
6948.36s: So we can finish this really quick.
6950.76s: So essentially we just need to do equals some
6956.32s: some of that equals some of this equals
6968.04s: but 55, 17, 74, lines up perfect, lines up perfect,
6981.32s: 154, 91.
6984.76s: This, I also think, yeah, no, I think you guys are right.
6988.44s: I think you guys are right.
6990.68s: Because the other thing is this is showing last price
6994.76s: at 154, 69.
6997.16s: So then this to me looks like he would have bought
7004.76s: right before the close because that lines up really well
7008.68s: with this.
7009.52s: Yeah, you guys are 100% wrong.
7011.48s: You guys are 100% correct.
7013.64s: So he added, so this looks like,
7016.80s: because here this is, I need to see a chart.
7020.88s: I still believe that you guys are right
7022.32s: based on what I see here.
7023.48s: I still think that that is absolutely,
7028.16s: the most likely that I see now,
7030.28s: but I need to see like a GME,
7035.36s: non-split adjusted, dark.
7040.00s: Does Yahoo Finance do that?
7044.08s: So the first split was in 07, which doesn't matter.
7049.00s: No, I don't, come on, man.
7055.24s: Let's see.
7057.32s: This doesn't tell me when the splits were.
7059.32s: That's kind of really annoying.
7061.32s: I just want to see something.
7063.12s: You'll find.
7064.16s: Does, do you know if Yahoo Finance does this?
7071.00s: EME.
7073.84s: Let's take a look at this really quick.
7076.84s: And then let's do.
7082.64s: We want to do something.
7085.04s: We want to do off Putin says the shares had not touched
7091.28s: 83.50 since February.
7092.32s: Okay. Yeah.
7093.16s: That's exactly what I want to confirm.
7094.40s: Because as long as that's the case,
7095.48s: then I literally completely agree with you guys.
7097.92s: I think that that is spot on.
7102.92s: Let's do six month one day.
7105.76s: And then we are in 2021.
7110.56s: And we are in April.
7116.56s: Yeah, completely agree.
7119.56s: Yeah.
7120.56s: Completely agree.
7137.56s: Okay.
7139.56s: So I think this is certainly confirmed.
7145.16s: Then 50K of the 50K of the 16 April.
7155.56s: Thank you for the help guys 12 call,
7158.20s: exercised and then 50K bought to open.
7164.68s: At.
7166.52s: 154.
7171.92s: Got 91124.
7174.92s: So now we have no options.
7177.32s: This perfect.
7178.12s: Yeah.
7180.64s: Off Putin says math.
7181.80s: Don't know.
7182.64s: Yeah, that's exactly that's the beautiful part.
7183.96s: And again, this is another thing that I clearly am learning,
7187.16s: right?
7188.16s: Because when I look at this, this is completely different
7191.20s: than any other platform.
7192.88s: So I've never seen a platform that will credit
7195.32s: the shares.
7196.40s: Now this leads to another potential thing.
7199.76s: Because I'm just not sure.
7204.36s: If he exercised because he might have exercised early.
7207.68s: And I don't have a way to identify that.
7212.08s: But there's a chance he could have exercised between one April
7215.24s: and 16 April, which opens up another really interesting question.
7219.36s: So let me see if chat GPT can answer that for me.
7223.28s: He uses is this eTrader fidelity?
7225.72s: This is eTrader, right?
7226.80s: Is that accurate?
7231.16s: Because.
7234.84s: eTrader, okay, thank you.
7236.56s: So let's take a look.
7240.52s: Within the eTrader platform.
7244.96s: If I hold an option.
7249.96s: And let's say that I hold it into expiration.
7252.80s: I hold in the money call into expiration.
7258.60s: That I want to exercise.
7262.68s: When will the shares appear in my account?
7269.48s: Very, very interested about this.
7272.80s: And then off-punises, the shares closed at 156.44
7276.56s: the prior day.
7277.44s: Yeah, so it's like obviously trading around that 154 handle.
7280.12s: Here we go.
7281.96s: Okay, so if you hold an in the money option into expiration
7287.96s: and choose to exercise.
7289.96s: Yeah, see, it says the shares will typically appear
7292.96s: in your account by the following trading day.
7296.48s: So usually on the Monday after expiration.
7298.80s: So this leads me to believe that he exercised slightly early.
7304.80s: I'm going to add a note here.
7308.32s: Early question mark,
7310.32s: because I don't know, but I believe this is early,
7314.28s: which is an important note for me believe it or not.
7318.84s: Wow, what a banger.
7322.44s: What a fucking banger.
7327.24s: So this is super curious.
7330.88s: All of this is super curious so far.
7332.64s: I'm going to pause us here before we get into the recent stuff.
7336.28s: And I want to recap some of what I'm seeing.
7339.92s: So the first thing that I'm seeing is that most of the time
7344.08s: he's holding the options very close
7347.12s: if not all the way into expiration, very, very close
7350.04s: like all the way in here.
7351.60s: And I've seen that multiple times now.
7353.80s: In this case, it looks like the overwhelming probability
7358.44s: is an early exercise and it's probably because
7362.08s: he was expecting to lose all the extrinsic value
7365.08s: anyways by taking it into expiration.
7368.80s: Now again, it's a suboptimal choice.
7371.52s: It doesn't actually make sense to do that.
7374.56s: Now the only reason why this could make sense
7377.64s: to take it all the way into expiration
7380.08s: is because there's so far in the money
7383.80s: that he would net that difference
7385.76s: if he unwound the position.
7387.60s: But based on what most of us have seen so far
7390.40s: before the chewy stuff,
7392.16s: it doesn't really look like he unwinds the positions.
7395.84s: So that entire scenario is actually quite fascinating to me.
7400.88s: And watching him take these options so far
7405.52s: into expiration is really, really interesting.
7409.44s: The other thing that I noticed is that the total gain
7412.24s: on the account obviously is massive,
7415.44s: massive, massive volatility.
7418.00s: I see the peak here was 33 mil.
7421.40s: And then when he left off, he was at essentially 20 mil.
7424.88s: So that is also very interesting.
7429.00s: So Rointit, he says he stacks the shares.
7432.08s: Yeah, and that's something that Newton told me
7434.40s: that based on what Newton had seen
7436.80s: that he's never unwound,
7438.24s: although I do think he unwound to get into chewy
7441.24s: which we will need the tinfoil hat for that part
7443.92s: if we want to go into that which I'm happy to.
7451.08s: This one here.
7455.64s: So if we take a look at,
7460.28s: we have to zoom out.
7461.56s: See this, we need Newton.
7463.52s: I need to hit Newton up because here it is.
7466.08s: I'm slowly figuring out how to navigate this stuff
7470.52s: but his stuff everywhere, it's real tricky.
7473.16s: So here Newton has shown me that essentially he scales the account
7480.08s: and yep, this all looks right.
7481.72s: And again, so this Newton already covered this.
7483.52s: No surprise.
7488.04s: And then,
7500.96s: yeah, because so we've done the cost analysis
7504.20s: on the chewy position.
7505.20s: Let me grab my hat.
7506.28s: All right, now we're ready.
7508.28s: Oh, whoa.
7510.24s: My hold on just so everybody can see that.
7513.28s: Whoa, it's like back up.
7515.28s: Here's the hat and it's full glory.
7520.28s: So now that we have the hat on,
7523.28s: we can take a quick look at the chewy position
7526.08s: and then we can see that it's full glory.
7529.08s: So now that we have the hat on,
7531.08s: we can take a quick look at the chewy position
7535.40s: because again, I think the problem with the chewy position
7540.00s: is that there just was not enough money in the account.
7543.04s: Now, Roryntitty says,
7545.24s: I don't think so.
7546.08s: He was trading with multiple accounts,
7547.40s: he had money in other places.
7548.88s: He used for chewy.
7549.76s: I again, maybe he did,
7553.92s: but I just don't see it.
7560.00s: And the reason why I don't see it
7562.24s: is because, and again, who knows,
7565.16s: this is why the hat's on,
7566.44s: is I don't know, it's pure speculation.
7569.08s: But the reason why I don't see it
7571.92s: is because let me consolidate this stuff down
7574.08s: so we can zoom in a little bit.
7576.88s: The reason why I don't see it
7578.92s: is because when he comes back,
7583.44s: he came back here with 210, 210 milli.
7588.96s: So, with 210 milli,
7596.00s: why, if he had another, literally,
7599.00s: another 210 milli,
7601.80s: why would it not just be here?
7607.08s: I don't, I just,
7608.92s: he obviously has made a lot of money.
7612.92s: And another thing I'm even more interested in
7617.08s: to be completely honest with you
7619.16s: is I'm not convinced that from 16 April 2021 to June,
7625.36s: that he went from 34 mill to 210 by just trading.
7629.92s: Absolutely could have,
7631.44s: but I'm not convinced that that's what happened.
7635.08s: And it's just because I can't prove it one way or the other.
7637.84s: What's the, what is the Compend annual growth rate
7642.40s: from 2021 to 2024 moving from 34, 34 mill to 211 mill.
7659.88s: Just had a curiosity.
7661.84s: So it's a three year period.
7672.52s: KCM says,
7675.36s: would you have 400 million all at one broker at least two?
7679.24s: I don't see, I don't see the reason to split it between two.
7684.28s: I again, like if you're already at the 200 million handle,
7688.68s: so,
7692.40s: yeah,
7694.48s: he could.
7695.40s: And again, the other thing that I would absolutely highlight
7699.80s: is I don't see any reason why he wouldn't have money elsewhere.
7704.96s: I'm not suggesting that he doesn't,
7707.24s: but my main point is I think the money
7710.88s: that he would essentially have to trade
7714.92s: would be,
7716.12s: KCM King says rumors,
7717.36s: each rate threatened to close his position.
7718.88s: I heard that too,
7720.24s: but again, that's later into this.
7722.80s: My main point,
7723.96s: and maybe you guys will have an opinion on it.
7726.24s: So my main point here is that when he came back at two June,
7730.60s: and he has $211 million.
7733.56s: Why wouldn't you come with all the money
7736.40s: that you're going to trade if you had another $200 million
7740.80s: that you were going to use for something at some point?
7743.20s: Anyways,
7744.28s: the other thing is that when we look at something like this,
7750.76s: we have another really interesting scenario in my opinion,
7755.12s: where it's clear that he would have used options in the meantime
7759.48s: because the compound annual growth rate
7761.88s: for the three year period for him would have been about 85%,
7764.96s: which again,
7766.96s: that's insanely good,
7768.36s: but that I could see him doing that.
7770.36s: Like that's not overly crazy.
7774.28s: In this case, it looks like,
7777.32s: I just, I don't see why he would come back
7779.72s: if he was expecting to use $400 million to trade
7782.96s: and have $210 million in the account.
7785.20s: Why not just have it all in one spot,
7787.88s: especially for the way that he rolls.
7789.64s: I don't see why he would split them.
7792.28s: Yeah.
7793.48s: Orange guy says,
7794.72s: well, why would he buy calls,
7796.36s: exercise them and sell them instead of just bagging the premium?
7799.80s: Well, you don't bag the premium.
7801.64s: If you buy the calls, the premium's gonna go away.
7804.72s: So yeah, that's the reason why,
7808.76s: it is the same reason why he uses calls here.
7810.68s: It's for leverage.
7812.20s: So one of the things I can tell very clearly
7815.04s: from his options positions
7817.08s: is that he unequivocally uses options for leverage.
7822.16s: Even in this case,
7823.32s: he actually doesn't need to use options for leverage here, right?
7828.16s: Like he has enough money for sure,
7831.12s: but he still prefers the leverage.
7834.68s: And I think that that's again,
7836.24s: like an artifact of the way that he trades
7839.40s: and the way that he rolls, really,
7841.84s: which is again, pretty nuts.
7844.40s: So Blancwayze says there is a couple of run-ups
7848.52s: since April 21,
7849.36s: he probably perfected the game.
7850.56s: That's the problem though,
7853.24s: is like I just don't see that.
7856.00s: Based on what I see here,
7858.80s: like I don't see him perfecting the game.
7861.44s: Again, I want to be so clear.
7864.48s: He's incredible.
7866.12s: And he clearly has definitely timed things very well,
7872.04s: very well.
7873.28s: But one of the things that I can tell you again,
7875.76s: by just looking at this,
7877.60s: is that the way he's trading
7879.80s: is not really predicated on timing.
7884.04s: And I don't see any evidence here that he perfected it, right?
7889.32s: Because if he perfected it,
7891.16s: we wouldn't have a 33-milli-count that drops to seven,
7895.64s: that then goes back up to 25,
7897.92s: that goes back down to 20.
7900.96s: So the problem that I see with this,
7903.20s: is the idea that he's like, you know, and again,
7905.52s: I love the way that we hold the cat in high regard.
7911.40s: We should.
7912.24s: What he's done is insane.
7914.20s: But I still think it's really important,
7916.52s: again, to look at things as objectively as possible.
7919.80s: And one of the things that I can see going on here
7923.76s: is it, to me, it looks pretty clear
7928.88s: that the timing is not perfect.
7933.72s: I don't see perfect timing here.
7936.24s: I see massive, account volatility, massive.
7940.56s: And I see most of his trades being managed by time
7945.36s: in the trade, not by taking profits at advantageance points.
7952.12s: So I don't see, yeah, I don't see the timing argument.
7958.00s: I just, it looks to not be the case.
7962.08s: At least as far as what we know so far,
7965.04s: which is fascinating, isn't it?
7966.92s: Because even the fact that he was willing
7972.72s: to exercise these, but then to buy,
7975.76s: in what, he bought 50,000 shares at $155.
7980.84s: You wanna talk about a fucking choice?
7983.28s: That's a fucking choice.
7985.00s: Because again, if we think about the psyche
7990.32s: and the background of him as an investor,
7992.04s: he talks about how his background is as a value investor.
7996.88s: There's clearly,
8002.44s: there's clearly no world that he actually thinks
8007.12s: GameStop was worth $155 there.
8009.96s: Like there's no world that he thought that.
8012.72s: And this, to me, looks like a confirmation of his pivot
8017.64s: from a value investor,
8019.28s: which I absolutely saw him talk about
8021.68s: in one of his live streams,
8023.56s: where he talked about how he would value things
8028.36s: and then they would move differently.
8030.76s: And that would get under his skin after a little while.
8034.64s: Semicresion says for clarity, tinfoil, it's on.
8036.96s: You can see it's on.
8038.24s: It's a visual representation of the speculation.
8041.52s: This is all speculation,
8042.64s: because I literally can't prove any of it.
8045.28s: So the stuff that we can prove are the things
8047.60s: that I can work out via math.
8049.04s: I can look at money coming in and out of the account,
8051.44s: like all of those things.
8053.40s: But I can tell again from this purchase,
8059.24s: that's not a value purchase.
8060.88s: There's no world that he would have thought.
8064.20s: $155 is fair value or even below value for GameStop.
8067.88s: There's just absolutely no way.
8071.60s: So,
8073.32s: Willie says, wasn't he tired of price
8074.92s: not meaning his value target?
8076.00s: It's exactly.
8076.80s: And he talked about that in one of his live streams.
8081.24s: We can see if we can find it.
8082.52s: I mean, again, like we have the tinfoil hats on and everything.
8086.08s: We can go in for a little bit.
8087.48s: My dinner's not going to be here for a little while.
8089.68s: So we can get in.
8095.00s: We got a fresh mango orange.
8096.92s: So we're ready to rock.
8099.20s: Let's see what we have in these.
8111.00s: No, no, no.
8115.84s: No.
8120.04s: No.
8122.04s: I think it might have been a live stream.
8128.36s: Here we go.
8129.60s: Let's try one of these new ones.
8132.36s: Willie says Mexican food.
8134.16s: No, we're doing a place called Carl Strauss.
8136.76s: It's kind of like a pub.
8138.44s: So the guy that got me into investing,
8140.36s: I talked about him last night.
8142.44s: He's he was one of my high school teachers.
8145.52s: He was a junior ROTC instructor.
8147.68s: He's this guy right there.
8150.04s: He's over at my house right now,
8152.20s: hanging out actually.
8153.24s: He's here for like the weekend.
8154.68s: We've we've kept in touch.
8156.84s: I've I referred to him as my stepdad,
8158.84s: but he's the one that I refer to him as,
8160.84s: yeah, I referred to him as his stepdad.
8162.60s: He's not like in any sort of relationship with my mom,
8165.44s: but like he took very much like a father role in my life.
8168.48s: And he's the one that introduced me
8170.08s: to the concept of investing in high school,
8172.32s: which he literally is the dude that changed my life.
8175.52s: Anyways, he likes burgers.
8177.68s: So that's why we're ordering from Carl Strauss tonight.
8180.76s: Because when he's here,
8182.24s: it is whatever works for this dude.
8185.00s: So yeah.
8186.24s: That Lawrence says I was wondering
8187.80s: if you were having Mexican tonight.
8189.12s: Yeah, no, I I was literally joking with Mel about that
8192.40s: about how you guys advocate for
8194.20s: sometimes with the Mexican, but no, not tonight.
8203.28s: So semi-Christian says, has anyone tipped his driver?
8206.40s: No, not me.
8207.28s: I mean, I I tip them.
8208.68s: Oh, I don't know.
8209.88s: Not me.
8211.00s: I mean, I tip them always well, but no.
8215.28s: Jonathan says brewery.
8216.28s: Yeah, exactly.
8217.04s: That's what Carl stresses.
8222.24s: Vladimir says, don't skip past the 55, 17, 74 cost basis
8227.64s: on the final 200,000 shares post split 1380.
8231.48s: Yeah.
8232.32s: Yep.
8235.40s: Willie says, oh man, I have a high school teacher
8237.68s: who I respect.
8238.20s: Yeah, they like that dude literally changed my life.
8240.88s: So yeah, he became and it's funny
8243.16s: because his son, he had an adopted son
8246.00s: that actually committed suicide.
8247.88s: And then I had an abusive dad that wasn't in my life a lot.
8252.88s: So it's just the hilarity of the universe,
8257.48s: but it kind of put both of us together at a point
8261.96s: where we both kind of really needed each other.
8265.32s: And it yeah, it formed this really, really incredible relationship
8269.76s: that was just pure happenstance.
8271.96s: Well, whatever we consider happenstance.
8274.76s: Rhino says, every time I say I am trading anything,
8277.24s: but GME, the Abe community calls me a shill.
8280.56s: It's hard to follow GME and actually make money without abuse.
8285.00s: Well, I don't know.
8285.84s: Rhino, I can't speak for you, but in that case,
8289.28s: at least for me, like I keep it a buck, right?
8291.28s: Like it is what it is.
8292.16s: Whatever I do is whatever it is.
8294.56s: So like there was that person earlier in the stream
8296.80s: that was pissy with me because they were saying
8299.92s: that I'm bearish because I'm selling calls, right?
8301.96s: It's like whatever they're going to think
8303.68s: is whatever they're going to think, man.
8304.80s: But like I honestly couldn't possibly care less
8307.88s: with that one person thinks
8309.56s: because one, literally the statement doesn't make sense, right?
8313.84s: When we look at something like a covered call,
8318.72s: covered calls make maximum profit
8321.24s: when the stock is above your short call.
8323.56s: That's where maximum profit is.
8325.80s: So again, that's just people being ignorant.
8328.48s: It's people that don't understand how things work
8331.24s: and they're just kind of looking for something to look at.
8333.56s: That's genuinely what I believe.
8335.80s: So for example, if I take a look at this scenario again,
8339.16s: let's say that we have just 100 shares is fine.
8342.20s: And I can get rid of all these other ones now.
8346.56s: And let's say that I sell a call against these shares.
8354.40s: Where's my max profit?
8356.44s: Right now in this scenario,
8357.96s: GameStop is trading at 22.
8359.92s: It's right here.
8361.28s: Where's my max profit in this trade?
8363.72s: It's fucking up.
8365.96s: It has to go up for me to hit max profit,
8368.88s: even in a covered call.
8370.76s: So when people say things like, oh, you sold a call,
8374.20s: you're bearish, it again, it's pure ignorance.
8378.20s: So like for example, so that's just that guy,
8381.28s: I immediately discount whatever they think
8384.08s: because it's illogical.
8386.08s: The people that I think it makes sense
8388.64s: to truly onboard their opinion of you
8391.60s: are people who know you really well.
8393.96s: And there was an actor who said this at some point,
8396.72s: I don't know who it was because I was watching a YouTube short
8400.04s: where somebody was paraphrasing what they heard.
8403.64s: It was an actor that was paraphrasing
8406.20s: what they heard another actor say.
8408.12s: But essentially, it's something to the effect of,
8411.40s: if you have a problem with me, text me.
8418.80s: And if you don't have my number,
8420.80s: you don't know me well enough to have a problem with me.
8424.20s: I actually like that a lot.
8425.40s: I think that that's a really smart way to look at it.
8429.96s: So Rhino, for the internet people that have a problem with you,
8433.32s: just tell them to text you.
8435.16s: And if they do not have the number to text you,
8437.72s: it tells you that they don't know you well enough
8441.24s: in order to come up with that opinion.
8442.80s: So yeah, whatever they say is what they say.
8445.96s: Don't even worry about it.
8454.52s: Willie says, haters gonna hate Aristotle, I think.
8457.20s: Yeah, that's probably the Aristotle probably.
8459.08s: Yeah, I think that's right.
8461.84s: Roryntitty said, my fifth grade teacher taught me
8463.60s: how to use chopsticks.
8464.72s: She paid me to grade maths.
8466.16s: After school and took me to Chinese,
8467.52s: she was really awesome, kept me out of trouble.
8468.96s: Yeah, that's so fucking sick.
8470.52s: I love that.
8471.36s: That's super cool.
8472.20s: It's one of the reasons, again, it's one of the reasons
8474.04s: why I do this stuff is because I've had a lot of people
8476.72s: positively impact me in my life
8478.56s: that I would be in a completely different spot.
8480.28s: And sometimes it just takes a couple interactions
8483.80s: to send somebody down a completely better path in their life,
8487.00s: which I think is really cool.
8488.12s: Like I genuinely value that.
8489.80s: I think that that is so unbelievably cool.
8494.12s: All right, so let's go back into this
8495.84s: and let's see what we can learn here.
8498.16s: I need to turn on the volumes that you can hear.
8505.24s: And let's see.
8507.48s: Moving up in size, where is it up there?
8510.64s: Yeah, look at this.
8511.56s: I mean, I need to have this number.
8514.80s: So do I get some trading here?
8516.12s: Yeah, yeah, 2023.
8516.96s: So look at this.
8517.80s: You still got them trading in the 90s here.
8519.12s: And oh, let's look up.
8520.72s: Let's look up where they've been trading in the past
8522.68s: out of upside.
8523.92s: And with RFP, I do think that's the case.
8525.60s: I see the other one, SWN.
8528.32s: So I had a smaller number of women here.
8530.60s: RFP, it's here.
8531.44s: Why didn't you tell me RFP was in this spreadsheet?
8533.08s: Maybe you did.
8533.92s: I wasn't listening.
8534.76s: So if I click this, if I click this,
8536.28s: does it bring me right to it?
8539.28s: Okay, look at that.
8540.12s: 300 million market cap elsewhere as well.
8543.32s: If 15%.
8544.08s: Oh, I thought it was a more than that.
8545.40s: I haven't tested this in a while.
8546.36s: Let's see.
8547.20s: Here as well.
8548.68s: I forget what the bond price is a tentacle war,
8550.20s: but then I thought tentacle,
8551.24s: I mean, I don't remember where it is.
8553.76s: I'll have to go through them and see if I can find it.
8556.64s: I do not remember where it is at all.
8561.52s: Let's see.
8566.76s: What I can't.
8574.32s: Let's see what this one is.
8575.40s: I'm back and I try to think about why, why everyone thinks that
8579.56s: and the most obvious reason is just because we all lean
8581.92s: on those oversimplifying ETFs to measure the style success.
8585.56s: But I mean, that's not really successful
8587.84s: over the past decade.
8588.84s: The reasons why.
8591.76s: Maybe this is it where it says why I'm not a value investor.
8602.24s: Roaring Titty says it was in his livestream
8604.04s: when he was talking about a spreadsheet.
8605.28s: That's so tricky because I don't like, I've seen,
8609.20s: I've seen pieces of his work around in different spots
8612.48s: and I just haven't mentally bucketed where each of these are.
8618.56s: So my Christian says,
8621.32s: Chat GPT would be useful.
8622.36s: Yeah, I'm happy to run it through Chat GPT.
8625.68s: Let's see.
8640.20s: And this thing is like completely locked up for some reason.
8642.84s: I'm back and.
8645.24s: Alright, so let's see.
8646.60s: Oh, grab this.
8648.88s: Got this into video summarizer.
8656.16s: And then let's see.
8657.40s: Um.
8668.48s: Okay.
8669.08s: So summarize this video.
8674.72s: Let's see what that comes up with.
8676.12s: Yeah.
8676.88s: I try to think about why, why everyone thinks that.
8679.56s: And the most obvious reason is just because we all lean on those oversimplifying ETFs
8683.60s: to measure the style success.
8685.64s: But I mean, that's not a good way to measure a bona fide value approach.
8689.72s: It's um.
8692.20s: So the summary, I'm just going to read you the summary because it's a little bit faster.
8701.32s: So this says it starts with him explaining his style makes it clear.
8707.16s: He's not offering day trading trips or quick stock excitement.
8710.36s: Isn't that funny?
8712.16s: Isn't that funny?
8713.12s: The beginning of the video starts with him saying he's not offering quick stock
8717.56s: excitement.
8718.76s: And then he, uh, that's just so classic.
8722.28s: I love that.
8723.96s: And then it says value investor with a twist.
8726.32s: He says he identifies as a value investor, but he doesn't fit the traditional model.
8731.00s: He rejects the idea that value investing is dead.
8735.44s: Um, but he doesn't rely on discounted cash flow.
8740.20s: He focuses on a broader framework where value is one of the many factors.
8745.44s: He incorporates technical analysis into his strategy, which obviously is
8749.88s: contract to value.
8754.20s: And he aims for aggressive 50 to 100% annualized return, acknowledging that
8760.48s: his approach may not suit everyone.
8762.40s: He emphasizes lumpy returns, which is exactly correct, which meaning some
8766.52s: years while perform while others might false short.
8769.04s: It literally, it literally is perfect.
8772.32s: And the reason why it's perfect is because that's a direct representation of what
8775.64s: I've seen him do.
8777.64s: So I'm going more into the, I'm asking it more about the, the differing of his
8784.40s: approach.
8787.16s: Uh, that Lauren says break that down for the dummies.
8791.32s: Uh, sure.
8791.88s: What?
8792.12s: Sorry.
8792.40s: Which part?
8793.44s: Tell me I could take this off now because my head's getting hot.
8796.96s: Uh, Lauren, tell me what part we
8799.04s: need to dive into.
8799.88s: You know, I'm happy to.
8800.84s: Let me know.
8806.04s: Are you guys getting ads?
8811.00s: I'm seeing comments about, uh, I saw somebody say something about YouTube premium
8816.04s: or whatever.
8820.80s: And then Lauren, let me know what.
8826.36s: All of it, what does it mean in layman's terms?
8829.48s: Uh, layman's, uh, all of it.
8831.88s: You mean the, the value investing thing that I'm talking about?
8835.64s: I just want to make sure I'm talking about the right thing.
8837.88s: The, the value investor, the idea that value investing is dead, that stuff in
8842.00s: like the, the model thing.
8847.36s: So, okay, so yeah, let me, let me run through this and, um, Lauren, let me know if
8853.68s: there's like specific follow-ons.
8855.72s: So value investing is a really, really distinct approach to investing.
8860.60s: And it's very specific to investing.
8862.16s: It's not specific.
8863.52s: It's not tied to, to trading.
8866.96s: And value investing is really predicated on searching for companies
8873.20s: whose current stock value is below to a degree, whatever the target value is,
8881.32s: whatever somebody thinks, um, it should be.
8886.16s: And the way that people arrive at what they think it should be largely depends
8890.08s: on their models, a very common one is called a discounted cash flow.
8894.28s: And it's essentially, it sounds what it, it kind of does what it sounds like,
8898.20s: where we're trying to discount future cash flows to figure out what the
8903.08s: current price of something should be.
8905.80s: So his general approach is, that was his basis.
8912.48s: That was his foundation.
8913.64s: And we can see that represented as we go through like a lot of this earlier stuff,
8918.92s: right?
8919.20s: So like his little spreadsheet thing here is really specific to trying to find
8925.60s: things at value.
8927.64s: Now, the problem with value, well, there's a bunch of problems with value
8931.84s: investing as an effective tool.
8933.72s: It does work just fine to be clear.
8935.96s: But in terms of his return profile, it doesn't work that well at all.
8940.72s: So value investors are not typically targeting 50 to 100% returns.
8945.36s: It's just unreasonable.
8946.60s: Most of their stocks will move much less than that.
8949.52s: The other thing is most value investors do not bother with technical analysis
8954.56s: because technical analysis represents interim movements when really
8959.08s: they're most concerned with their model and their pricing, because that's
8963.40s: where they think something should ultimately land.
8966.00s: And then the prices in the model would get updated each quarter as new
8970.08s: financials come out.
8971.56s: So his general approach as he was outlining there is obviously really
8976.60s: interesting because it's completely blending different things together,
8982.60s: which is unequivocally just fascinating.
8986.28s: And the way that he trades in terms of one of the things he was talking
8989.48s: about is lumpy returns.
8991.64s: Well, that's the nature of value investing in general.
8994.40s: And you can see traits of those lumpy returns here where things go up,
8998.88s: things go down, things go up, things go down.
9002.16s: Now with the whole lumpy returns thing that I find fascinating is because
9006.52s: it tells me that he's not actually really trying to time things super well.
9011.04s: That he's okay holding through these different, you know, movements up,
9016.16s: movements down and so on and so forth.
9019.36s: So yeah, the whole prospect of like his origin,
9023.08s: you can tell is very value investing focused,
9026.00s: but the way that he trades, obviously, this is, this is not value at all.
9030.88s: I think he came across GameStop and thought that it had decent value in the
9035.56s: beginning, but you can tell he abandoned that fully because the way that he
9040.88s: traded this is trading the thesis of value in my opinion,
9046.24s: meaning that he thinks GameStop should be worth more in the future than it is
9050.60s: now. But the way that he set this entire thing up from the beginning
9054.96s: doesn't jive with again, the approach for like a normal value investor.
9059.12s: A good example of a value investor is Warren Buffett.
9061.68s: That's essentially one of the primary current state users of it.
9068.12s: At least that scale.
9070.40s: So yeah, the departure clearly happened.
9074.80s: I don't know when it happened, but it definitely did happen.
9080.20s: Do you guys know maybe it was in the live streams when it is early live streams
9084.40s: go through a bunch of different positions.
9085.72s: Yeah, it looks like it.
9086.92s: So here he has a bunch of different positions.
9089.60s: Here he still has a bunch of different positions.
9091.24s: Let's click this one really fast.
9097.88s: I said I'm into the trimmed over the just to raise some cash.
9099.88s: My cash is getting low.
9101.56s: Okay.
9101.96s: So yeah, here he is.
9103.08s: A ton of stuff.
9104.80s: Very standard value investing approach.
9112.52s: Okay.
9113.56s: So this was 19 aug 2020.
9119.16s: Still value.
9120.12s: I can see that here.
9126.80s: Let's take a look.
9127.68s: Shall we pull that up?
9130.04s: Yep.
9130.36s: So this looks like he's still holding multiple things.
9135.60s: Let's do it.
9141.20s: Let's do it.
9142.20s: That's a lot of other old stuff looks super bullish through.
9149.40s: I kind of just ballparked it.
9150.48s: Although I was curious brick and mortar in.
9152.80s: Okay.
9154.48s: So this one was.
9158.52s: When was this one possibly an ounce that could be 26 augs.
9163.32s: Let's fast forward a little bit.
9164.88s: So clearly here.
9168.20s: Still value.
9171.76s: This guy but his.
9174.20s: So here he's introducing Cohen.
9178.48s: I want to see if his if his spreadsheets in here.
9184.68s: There it is.
9185.28s: So.
9193.04s: Sanso says how long does this meme stock mania run?
9196.44s: What are the limits to this?
9198.12s: Well, I think meme stocks are never going to go away.
9201.24s: I think that their shape will change and what is currently a meme stock will
9206.32s: ebb and flow.
9207.92s: But yeah, I don't see meme stocks ever going away at this point.
9212.72s: I think meme stocks are going to continue to be a thing and it's because of social media.
9217.28s: I don't think it'll it'll ever change.
9221.76s: So let's see.
9222.44s: I want to go through is this thing a little bit more and see if I can find any of his current positions.
9230.36s: Because this looks like he's just doing valuations right like this is a cash flow model.
9235.60s: So he's trying to come up with different deflators and he's coming up with different assumptions of where he thinks things might go.
9241.92s: And you can see like these are just looking at different different companies.
9246.56s: But what I want to see is if he has a snapshot of his portfolio.
9254.76s: Same thing.
9258.72s: This looks like it.
9259.48s: This looks like his portfolio.
9261.92s: Yep.
9263.68s: So this.
9265.80s: Yep.
9266.28s: So I can see the percentage of his portfolio.
9268.04s: So GameStop is now 17% of his portfolio.
9272.84s: So this started to happen.
9274.84s: When is this?
9277.00s: 28 August 2020.
9279.36s: OK.
9280.64s: So now let's open up another YouTube window really quick.
9284.40s: And what I want to do is actually look at the movement.
9291.80s: Of his position.
9294.04s: Meaning in terms of the concentration.
9296.04s: So these are during the live streams.
9298.04s: Yeah.
9305.04s: T.C.M. King says this is why people think is more than one account.
9308.04s: His E trade is yellow account.
9310.04s: We never saw a yellow post that shows any of his value shares.
9313.04s: Well, because my hypothesis is that at that point he became highly concentrated.
9320.04s: And that's what I think we're going to see.
9322.04s: And that's actually why I'm doing this exact exercise right now.
9326.04s: Is I want to go back to like the beginning like here.
9329.64s: And I want to see what his distribution of port of positions were.
9335.04s: So in this case, this is seven aug.
9337.64s: And we can grab his portfolio tracker.
9342.44s: Let's see where it is.
9345.84s: This is different.
9349.24s: Let's find it.
9351.64s: That looks different.
9356.24s: Unless he changed the structure a little bit.
9364.04s: So this one is called RK tracker.
9366.24s: Yep. So we're in there.
9367.44s: Let's just see if we can find it.
9369.24s: So what I think we're going to see is.
9374.64s: I think we're going to see his position in GameStop build
9378.64s: and then consume everything else.
9383.64s: This is like super blurry.
9388.84s: And I get something I can read. There we go.
9392.24s: Price.
9393.64s: So this doesn't look like in his portfolio.
9396.44s: This looks like valuation stuff.
9400.24s: So we have to find his portfolio.
9404.84s: Not there.
9412.84s: That's valuation stuff.
9414.84s: We've seen this already.
9417.84s: More valuation.
9421.04s: More valuation.
9423.84s: Is this.
9443.84s: Percent evaluation 52 week.
9448.24s: Don't see anything in here that shows like percent of portfolio.
9452.84s: I don't think this is the same page.
9461.84s: What's the stock? What's this look like?
9463.64s: Yeah, it didn't.
9464.64s: All right. So it's old off and that that was the thing.
9466.84s: It looked like it might still hold up well, even if we'll.
9470.84s: So.
9473.84s: Some impression says this is better than a detective TV show.
9477.04s: Do you realize that?
9477.84s: Yeah, it's so funny.
9479.84s: I. Yeah, I like.
9482.84s: Trying to dive into this and see what we can find.
9485.84s: Rowing to the says I think that is his portfolio.
9488.84s: He has a very widespread sheet. Yeah.
9491.84s: It just looks different than this.
9494.84s: Because here I can clearly see this is in what?
9498.84s: D T.
9501.84s: So it would be way further down. It could be.
9510.84s: Oh, did you just see what I saw?
9517.84s: There's Luna.
9519.84s: That's funny.
9522.84s: TDC intel.
9525.84s: Zag.
9527.84s: Yeah. So, uh, roaring to the I agree with you.
9532.84s: T.C.M. King says here.
9534.84s: Already had a GM yellow post only showing Jimmy way before the date of the video.
9538.84s: You just played.
9539.84s: Oh, interesting.
9543.84s: Very interesting. Yeah.
9545.84s: So let's see. We have the first one in here.
9549.84s: The first one I see is September.
9554.84s: Of 2020.
9558.84s: Did I now go back far enough?
9564.84s: So I think that's the first one that we grabbed.
9567.84s: Let's go all the way down.
9579.84s: Okay.
9581.84s: So now all the way down at the bottom.
9584.84s: This is the first that I see, which was eight September in 2019.
9589.84s: Interesting.
9597.84s: Very interesting.
9602.84s: So.
9610.84s: And this would make a lot more sense too.
9615.84s: Because I think at this point.
9620.84s: What I see here then.
9624.84s: Is I agree with you that this is like just a straight up yellow account.
9630.84s: And then he had stuff elsewhere that was doing other stuff.
9635.84s: That's a great point.
9637.84s: What a great find.
9639.84s: Because this is definitely from 2020.
9642.84s: So we saw exactly to your point.
9645.84s: We saw the really concentrated GME position.
9648.84s: Now here's the thing.
9650.84s: That doesn't make sense to me then.
9653.84s: Why is it here only at 16%.
9656.84s: Let's see what the position is here.
9659.84s: Let's see if it mirrors what we find.
9663.84s: Around 28 aug 2020.
9665.84s: We can see this.
9668.84s: Does it show the actual position.
9672.84s: I think that's what we're going to do.
9675.84s: Let's see if we can show the actual position.
9692.84s: Different accounts.
9694.84s: Yeah, so it could be that's the thing I'm trying to figure out is I want to see if whatever he's tracking in here.
9699.84s: Is the same as his other account.
9701.84s: I can see the percent of the portfolio which is fine.
9704.84s: I need to see like the number of shares though.
9707.84s: And I don't know if he shows that.
9709.84s: Do you guys know.
9711.84s: So if he does that would be really helpful.
9715.84s: Because then we could very, very easily identify.
9719.84s: If he's.
9721.84s: Meering the position here or elsewhere.
9725.84s: Or if it's like a completely separate account.
9728.84s: I don't see it here.
9736.84s: Damn.
9740.84s: Damn Daniel.
9749.84s: Damn it.
9751.84s: Okay, so that's something that we're going to have to I'm going to add that to my to do list.
9755.84s: Or the next one that we do.
9758.84s: So we need.
9762.84s: Review our case 2024 trades.
9767.84s: And analyze.
9771.84s: Live streams to parallel.
9777.84s: Current portfolio.
9779.84s: Or to parallel.
9782.84s: Or.
9784.84s: Multiple portfolio into see if what he's reporting.
9793.84s: In.
9794.84s: Or on Reddit.
9796.84s: Meers.
9798.84s: What he's tracking in his.
9802.84s: Or in his excel sheet.
9807.84s: Or in his.
9810.84s: Or in his.
9813.84s: Or got some instructions for the next one.
9817.84s: Jonathan says Eric, why don't you have a red headband complete oversight.
9822.84s: That's because it's his.
9824.84s: I have a tinfoil Viking half is this is mine.
9827.84s: I am again, I don't I don't really copy people.
9830.84s: I like to do my own shit.
9832.84s: So this is exactly why.
9835.84s: So we'll have to explore that because I don't know the answer to it yet.
9838.84s: But what I want to see is if there's somewhere in one of these that shows us the number of shares he has.
9845.84s: Because then that will actually tell us a lot a lot.
9849.84s: And it'll help us explore a little bit more.
9853.84s: About the multi portfolio theory and like what it could look like.
9858.84s: Because I do think that there's a lot behind the theory right from this from the jump right.
9863.84s: And then we can see that we see a hundred thousand dollars here.
9866.84s: And then we obviously can see that he has other stuff elsewhere right from the jump that it looks like he's kind of tracking in a centralized spot.
9877.84s: And then likely executing in different places.
9881.84s: So I can totally, totally see that.
9884.84s: So yeah, I'm interested to see what we can learn from that though.
9889.84s: Because here we can see the overall snapshot.
9895.84s: All right gang, it is time for me to wrap up.
9899.84s: Go grab some dinner.
