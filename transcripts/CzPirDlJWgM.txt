0.00s: What's up outliers? Today we're going to talk about what actually matters in
3.54s: obstetricity because the vast majority of us when we are first starting, you are
8.22s: juggling a million different things and the funny part about that is the overwhelming
12.60s: majority of them literally don't matter. And it actually takes a long time to figure
16.74s: out what matters and what doesn't matter. And I can literally guarantee you that you
21.30s: will fall prey to at least several of what I'm about to walk through in terms of common
27.90s: focus topics for obstetricers that really don't matter. After that, I'm going to show
33.06s: you what actually matters. And then at the end of the video, I'm going to show you how
37.62s: to apply what actually matters. So the entire concept behind this video is to try and give
44.96s: you some clarity because now markets are challenging in a different way that there's
50.44s: pure information overload, which is a completely different problem than when I started in 2007,
56.52s: which is information was harder to come across. But nonetheless, they're both challenging
61.08s: to work through. So let's focus on this information overload. And let's talk about a lot of the
66.90s: false focus areas for new obstetricers. All of these have come from the option trading
72.48s: audience. First one, what expiration should I select? Next one after that is what delta,
80.00s: or typically what goes with this one is what is the best delta after that is my focus is
87.04s: not to be greedy and to lock in profits. It's actually a complete mistake. And you'll see
92.10s: why in a little bit what stocks what are the best stocks to trade options in? What is the
97.70s: best strike to select? What are I setting? Should I use should I have the upper threshold
104.30s: at 70 or 80? Who knows? Win rate focus. Lots of new traders will tout having a 80% 90% plus
114.42s: win rate completely forgetting the fact that even with those win win rates, you can lose money.
119.26s: And I have a video that talks about that in expected return. The whole of the topic. The multi-leg
125.46s: omnidragon fire breathing spread. Obviously, Joe just made that up. Obstetricers very commonly will
132.34s: layer on more and more legs. And you'll see why that's typically a mistake. Market narrative.
139.14s: The market narrative matters in terms of providing you context, but lots of new traders will see
144.18s: something move and they'll say something like why did this move? It's a good question and you
149.06s: typically can find some sort of answer depending on what you're looking at, but not always. So this
154.66s: creates a false feedback loop where it feels like every move you have to be able to completely
160.58s: and discreetly explain perfectly, whereas the reality is an obfustrator, you just got to be
165.30s: able to trade it. Now, again, there's new wants here as with all of this, because you should have
172.26s: an understanding of what's going on. Those inform your overall decision making process, but there
176.98s: becomes a myopic focus on trying to explain everything discreetly. And sometimes it could just be a
182.34s: fund that's choosing to rebalance. So they're selling their holdings of something. It's not even
186.74s: because it's not doing bad. It can be stuff like that too. Next one, predicting every move.
190.90s: This becomes a little intoxicating when we're seeing the markets will say things like,
194.66s: oh, I think this is going to happen. Oh, I really, really believe that this stock is value too low
199.78s: or whatever this broader analysis lens is. Now, prediction is a big part of what we do. And you
207.38s: have to be able to predict well, regardless, really of what strategy you try to trade, it never needs
213.62s: to be to this extreme. And again, you'll see why in a little bit indicator stacking similar to
219.70s: the option leg stacking indicator stacking is when we say, oh my god, RSI worked great in this
225.86s: back test. What if I overlay it with a MACD indicator? And then I also have some sort of heat map
232.26s: that puts sprinkles on my chart. And man, that back test looks great. The problem here is you creating
238.18s: something that is as thin as paper in terms of how robust it is. You'll see a better way of
244.18s: thinking about this in a little bit. Last one, dollar and percent return. This one's kind of funny
248.82s: because it actually does matter a lot. The happening though is that most options traders focus on the
255.06s: wrong one at the wrong time, which is kind of funny. What I mean by this is if you're trading a small
259.86s: account, let's say you have a $5,000 account, let's say that you get a 10% return, you got 500 bucks.
265.30s: That 500 bucks really isn't that inspiring. That's not going to take you to that trip on
270.58s: Tahiti that you were looking forward to or whatever grand or ideas you have about option trading,
275.86s: which really most people come into this with the exact wrong expectations. And that's because
282.18s: people start trading options and they think, oh, I'm trading options. This is an edge. And it's not.
288.74s: Options are just another asset class. You have to learn how they work in order to develop
293.46s: an edge, simply trading them isn't in and of itself an edge. And yes, this is even for the
298.82s: sellers out there. It's not inherent edge just to sell all the time. You'll get ran over. So
305.06s: back to this dollar and percent return comment. It's because that small account $5,000 that made
312.82s: 500 bucks. That 10% return in the broad context really isn't bad. That's something that can be
319.06s: shaped and turn into something. If it's consistent robust, there's something there. But a lot of
325.14s: times the option trader will say, oh, man, I only made 500 bucks. I got to do something else because
329.62s: this isn't going to make me what I want. And it's the complete wrong focus. The other thing is
333.86s: if you're starting with a bigger account, what ends up happening is your account mature as you
338.50s: actually start you should start to care more about the dollars than the percent. Because at the
344.58s: end of the day, the percent is what grows your account. The dollars is what you withdraw from
350.50s: the account to go live your life. So knowing what to focus on and when is important. Let's talk
355.94s: about what matters. These eight things risk management because you cannot trade zero dollars,
363.06s: behavior of options, which we'll talk about profit mechanisms, good feedback loops,
368.50s: your organization as a trader, edge over time, process over outcome and simplicity,
375.38s: slash robustness. Let's get a look at these. So the very first one risk management, it's pretty
382.26s: straightforward. We need to be able to manage risk at the portfolio, the strategy and the trade
386.50s: levels. If you do not have all of that clearly defined from the jump, it doesn't matter what
391.86s: delta you're worried about. There is no best DTE in this scenario. You literally are worrying about
397.94s: the wrong thing before you have the foundation of your trading career established. This is first,
403.22s: after this, the behavior of options, the way we learn how options behave is through something called
410.18s: the Greeks. I have a video, multiple videos that goes all through the Greeks and let me show you
415.78s: why this, the behavior of options coupled with profit mechanisms are so much more important
423.70s: than you trying to figure out what the best RSI setting is. When we're talking about profit mechanisms,
430.98s: we're talking about methods that actually yield profit in the market. So market effects, things like
440.42s: direction, can you trade things up, down, sideways, volatility, expansion, contraction, clustering,
446.98s: relative volatility. There's a million things you can do in volatility. It gets deep. You yield
450.42s: of an underlying if you like to play dividend paying stocks. These are things that actually lead to
456.26s: making money. Let's talk about why the behavior of options and why profit mechanisms are so much
463.06s: more important than starting the question sets from what is the best stock to trade options in and
469.86s: what DTE should I pick? I'll show you exactly why. If we go back in time to Tesla, I'm going to show
475.62s: you a trade that I made towards the end of last year in December. Effectively, it was in this time frame,
482.42s: Tesla was already doing well at this point. It was consolidating and it was following a standard
488.26s: pattern based on how I trade for a potential breakout actually manifesting on this day here
493.94s: on the 5th of December. Let's go to the 5th of December and let's take a look at this example.
498.74s: So what this is going to show you is what the market looked like at that day. So as you can see,
502.98s: this is what it looked like at that day. As soon as this broke above, I chose to go long and I
509.30s: used options to make the trade. We're not going to talk about my trade specifically, but I want to
513.86s: show you an important point. If we take a look at a bunch of different kinds of bullish trades,
520.42s: so let's say that you're wanting to trade Tesla, it literally doesn't matter. If you come to
526.42s: 20 December and you trade an at the money call, it doesn't matter if you go to 21 Fed and trade a
533.62s: slightly in the money call with a higher delta, it doesn't matter if you go to the 17th,
538.34s: in 25 and sell a put. If we take a look at all of these, what do they perform like relative to the
544.50s: underlying goes going up? This one makes money, this one makes money, it literally doesn't matter
551.62s: which of these you would have selected if you have a system that led you to be bullish here,
558.18s: whatever that is. Now, there's a lot of nuance between them and this is why the behavior of
564.26s: options becomes so important to understand because if we go back to this scenario,
569.62s: there's a couple things that we can tell right out of the gate. We know that these 15 DTE
573.94s: options are going to be cheaper than buying these 78 DTE options. We also know that these 20 D's 24 15 DTE
583.14s: calls are going to expire at an exponential rate compared to the further out in time options. So
591.94s: if we take a look at the at the money's here, you're getting a 50 delta, you're losing 53 cents a day.
597.22s: If I go out here to 78 days, slightly in the money, I know that they're going to be more expensive.
602.50s: I know that they're going to have more extrinsic value, but they're going to have a lower daily
607.30s: theta. Take a look, 26 cents of theta. I also know by going further out in time, these are going to be
612.18s: more sensitive to changes in Vega in volatility than the near term options. I also know that the near
616.90s: term options are going to have more gamma than these, which is why I go slightly deeper in the money
621.54s: to get more delta. This is the process of actually learning how options behave. So that then you can
629.54s: build the thing that makes the most sense based on your idea. This is why there is no
634.90s: best anything. It's all highly dependent on what you're expecting to see. So going back to this
640.82s: example, if we take a look at the subsequent move, literally all of those would have made money.
646.74s: It's just a question of how much money? So then this starts opening up the conversation about
652.42s: creating a feedback loop, being organized and focusing on edge over time. The feedback loop using
658.90s: Tesla trade as an example would be, I think it's going to break out here and go up. So I'm going to
662.98s: place a trade, maybe a paper trade, and then I'm wrong and it goes down. Okay? I got to track that.
669.46s: So then I'm going to put that in my trading log because I'm going to be trading a strategy that I
674.10s: defined in my trading plan that I researched that I generally think makes sense. But then as I'm
680.50s: logging these different traits, I'm noticing it's not working. So that means I need to change
685.06s: something. Now, while most traders are worried about what DTE is best, none of them are best.
691.22s: What matters is your ability to express ideas using options and then slowly iterate on them to
698.34s: make them better based on your style of trading, whether you like to buy options, sell options,
703.70s: do both short term, long term, all of these are choices available to you. Now, another thing that
710.18s: is so important when we're talking about the behavior of options is volatility. And it's because
715.70s: if we take a look at all of these other things that you're doing, you're going to notice that
719.70s: sometimes you might be directionally correct, but your trade still lost money. And then you're like,
724.10s: well, what the hell happened? Well, a lot of times volatility did some dig a dirty,
727.86s: did some nasty that you didn't expect and you didn't plan for. So volatility is a force that's
733.14s: underpinning literally every trade you could ever place as an options trader, whether you choose to
736.82s: focus on vol or directional style trading. Last, a couple of things to know on. Your ability to adhere
744.98s: to a process versus an outcome is probably going to be one of the actual determining factors of
750.58s: your ability to be successful over time. What this means is can you sit down and can you think about
756.66s: different profit mechanisms and create a plan on how to make money from them? I have a video that
762.50s: talks about the outlier strategy process. That's the exact point of that. Look at different profit
767.78s: mechanisms and figure out what strategies make sense for those. Then can you place a trade
773.54s: following your plan that's researched consistently over time, avoiding this urge to strategy hop
780.02s: because things go through different paths where it works, then it doesn't work, and then you move
783.86s: to something else and you have nothing to show for it. If you can learn to focus on the adherence
788.66s: of a process, which means taking all of the different feedback you get from your trades,
793.46s: baking it back into your approach, refining your strategy, that is going to ultimately lead to your
800.50s: success over anything else. And it's because trading is not like the kind of thing where you go to
808.34s: Vegas, you put it all on black, you win your bucket of money, tons of money, hopefully.
814.74s: And then you never touch a casino again. That is what we call a massive outlier, but they do
820.74s: happen. Options trading for most of us is literally going to be tens of thousands of trades over
827.14s: your trading career, which hopefully is very long. So what that means is the impact of any one
831.78s: individual trade really doesn't matter that much. For most people like me, this is going to be
836.90s: something you're going to have to do consistently over time for a long time in order to make a lot of
840.82s: money, but that's the cool part is you can make a lot of money doing this if you focus on the right
847.54s: things which most people don't. If you have any questions, let me know. I'll be in our
850.58s: last video later.
