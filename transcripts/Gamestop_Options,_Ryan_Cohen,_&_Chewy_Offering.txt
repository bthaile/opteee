0.45s: [Music]
0.76s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.68s: two things on the agenda we have
4.40s: GameStop two things for GameStop I want
7.00s: to talk about this case with Ryan Cohen
9.92s: and then I want to take a look at this
11.76s: question from my boy Bruce uh he sent it
14.76s: in I think a couple days ago and I I was
16.48s: going to review it yesterday and I
17.72s: forgot to so we'll hit this one today as
20.48s: well and then the second broader topic
23.68s: is the chewy offering quote unquote
26.96s: which we'll take a look at that together
29.04s: so first first so that I do not forget
32.28s: we're going to start with this one here
34.32s: we're going to start with Bruce's
35.36s: Bruce's question about analyzing the
37.52s: volume on the January 20 calls from the
41.40s: 18th so let's take a look at what's
44.72s: going on we'll kill that jump over to
47.80s: the platform and we'll get right in well
50.12s: first off GameStop has been very very
52.52s: quietly trending sideways so from a
54.84s: stock trading perspective it's now
57.16s: starting to fall within this range that
59.52s: starts to become a little more
61.04s: interesting in terms of which way does
62.72s: it break and as you can see on a shorter
65.60s: term time frame when we get rid of a lot
67.00s: of those you know other like spikes the
70.52s: chart normalizes and you can see that
72.92s: we're still seeing longer term moving
75.36s: averages positive sloping but they are
78.44s: starting to become negative sloping on
82.04s: the day so that's kind of important to
83.96s: note for me from just a general charting
85.68s: perspective but we'll see how what
86.76s: behaves in there let's get into
88.56s: specifics though and take a look at this
91.04s: options chain so here's what's going on
93.56s: in GameStop I'm still seeing this really
95.68s: heavy call skew and I am seeing the
99.08s: options scattered about I'm seeing
101.84s: options moving in and out of this front
103.96s: expiration if we take a look at volume
105.68s: we can see that the highest volume is
107.76s: the 20ep 20s and this to me looks like
112.04s: they're being moved around meaning
114.36s: they're coming up on expiration people
116.36s: are probably managing them so if we take
118.56s: a look at the 20ep and we take a look at
120.56s: the 20s we can see that the volume today
123.48s: was very high and the volume yesterday
126.56s: as they were pointing out was high but
128.88s: not a lot actually translated into more
132.76s: opening trades that's for the 20 step
135.24s: expiration so what I see in instances
138.04s: like this is people are trying to
139.72s: salvage the value out of these options
142.88s: and because they're going to Decay away
144.40s: in the next day or so and without a
146.72s: meaningful Catalyst and price trending
148.36s: in the wrong direction it's just kind of
150.36s: holding something that's uh breaking
152.60s: apart in your hands that you can't grab
154.12s: a hold of once it's gone so that's
156.92s: mostly what I see going on here people
158.68s: trying to take these front expiring
160.92s: options move them out a little bit in
162.48s: time give them some time in order to
164.92s: have a position to ultimately hopefully
167.16s: put on for themselves in the future and
169.92s: this goes all the way back to the same
171.44s: video I site all the time I will throw
173.40s: it in the comments below for you but
175.68s: there's a better way to buy options in
178.24s: something like GameStop than continuing
180.48s: to play the front expiration and just
182.20s: watching your money evaporate so that's
185.56s: in a nutshell what I see going on here
188.24s: now as I look across time and sales I
191.16s: can definitely see some activity for
193.80s: today specifically not the 18th but the
196.20s: 19th because I'm getting to Bruce's
197.80s: question a day late and it does look
199.60s: like there are some people that are
201.32s: still buying options again this could be
204.36s: that they sold these and now are buying
206.72s: them back you can't entirely tell but
209.32s: when I look through the options chain
211.08s: over the last few days and I kind of see
213.72s: you know what's been the most active and
216.88s: if we come down here to the strike and
218.76s: we want to take a look at just the 20s
220.88s: to help us isolate a little bit more
223.44s: there's just not a lot going on here is
225.36s: what I'm seeing and it's a little bit of
227.00s: a mix for people that are buying and
229.16s: selling so right now we're just looking
230.72s: at things at the offer but if we add the
233.08s: bid back in again you can see tons of
235.36s: people that are also selling these so
238.64s: it's a bit of a mixb I think that
240.36s: there's people obviously doing different
242.12s: things in here based on what their
243.52s: portfolio represents but I don't see
246.00s: anything here that's like jumping out at
247.56s: me as like hyper interesting now these
251.00s: 20s that are way further out in time
253.56s: this has been going on for a little
254.88s: while with people building these out and
256.88s: you can see that that's actually the
258.20s: bulk of these larger trades that we see
261.92s: at the 20 strike and even the 10 like
264.96s: the majority of the higher premium value
267.52s: trades I've been seeing so these are 300
269.72s: ,000 200,000 plus they've been out in
273.00s: 2025 so that's a big difference than
276.88s: historically what we've seen in
278.88s: something like GameStop so yeah overall
282.16s: interesting find but there's not really
285.08s: anything that's like truly jumping out
286.60s: at me from an options trading
288.44s: perspective and again not that I'm doing
290.60s: a video on it every single day now
292.48s: because there are some quiet days but I
295.96s: look at it every day for us so that
298.00s: every anytime I do see something thing I
300.32s: make a video like this to hopefully in
303.08s: share some of what I'm identifying but
305.44s: yeah it's been a little more on the
307.68s: quiet side so now let's take a look at a
310.04s: couple of these other things really fast
312.24s: the first thing I want to show you is
315.28s: this uh case against Ryan Cohen and it
319.96s: looks like he's paying just shy of a
321.96s: million dollars that's 985 th000 it's a
325.48s: civil penalty and it comes against
329.04s: violation of the HSR act so essentially
332.76s: and here's the complaint for those that
334.24s: are interested so you can look this up
336.20s: whenever you would like and you can kind
338.68s: of see the summary here and it says uh
342.00s: he acquired more than 562 th000 Wells
345.12s: Fargo voting Securities and he exceeded
348.48s: the HSR filing thresholds so that means
352.04s: he needed to file specific forms with
355.72s: Federal antitrust agencies and then wait
358.56s: before doing anything essentially wait
360.64s: before completing an acquisition um of
363.04s: the shares and whatnot and then again
364.72s: depending on what he's planning to do
366.00s: from there and then obviously you can
367.28s: see from here it says he failed to do so
369.56s: violating the act so this goes through
372.60s: exactly what they're supposed to do um
375.36s: it says they have to report large
377.08s: transactions over a certain threshold to
379.24s: the FTC and doj so that they can
381.60s: investigate the deals before they close
383.84s: they have 30 days after the transaction
386.08s: has been reported to conduct an initial
387.96s: investigation file a second request for
389.80s: additional information generally illegal
392.44s: to finalize an acquisition during this
394.24s: investigatory period the maximum civil
396.60s: penalty comes out to uh $
400.08s: 43,7 N2 per day um and that's when he
404.68s: made the corrective
405.88s: filing so it looks like it was not
409.40s: exempt under the investment only
412.32s: exemption even though that he
414.12s: represented less than 10% of the
416.60s: outstanding voting security so this is
419.64s: again that differentiation where the
421.92s: purchaser says like I'm planning on
423.64s: doing something or kind of what roring
425.72s: Kitty recently did Keith Gil and he said
428.28s: I'm just an investor I just you know
430.12s: exceed a certain reporting threshold so
433.40s: then you can see here when acquiring the
436.00s: Wells Fargo shares Cohen intended to
438.96s: influence Wells Fargo's business
440.44s: decisions as evidenced by his emails
442.24s: when he advocated for abort seat right
444.48s: so and that goes all the way back to
446.32s: this so when we're talking about him
449.16s: Clos cling the deal that's that's why it
451.64s: matters because in this case the deal
454.92s: obviously is just the transaction of the
457.56s: shares but then he was expecting to use
460.04s: that power to then affect the business
463.96s: so this looks like kind of just
467.76s: something to appease close this out and
471.20s: move on for somebody like him paying a
473.20s: million bucks it's a lot of money it's
474.76s: not ideal but I don't think he probably
476.40s: cares that much and this is likely just
479.16s: him looking to move on with the the path
482.68s: here so I don't really think this
484.36s: matters a whole lot I think it's
485.88s: generally interesting because I mean you
488.00s: don't like seeing somebody like him
489.84s: getting called out like this or breaking
491.36s: the rules like this but it's whatever
494.36s: like I don't think that this materially
496.28s: changes much okay now let's talk about
498.44s: chewy really quick so chewy they
500.36s: announced a public offering and this is
502.72s: I think really confusing because as you
505.32s: read through this you can see that um
508.32s: there's going to be a 500 million share
510.76s: of Class A being offered but it's not
514.44s: from chewy they're not issuing shares
516.40s: it's from Buddy Chester sub LLC who's
518.96s: advised by BC partner advisor LP and so
524.72s: essentially what is going on here is
528.12s: this shareholder is unwinding some of
530.28s: their position and then chewy is saying
533.68s: that they're going to buy 300 million of
536.80s: it so this person's offering 500 this
539.96s: entity is going to sell 500 million
542.12s: shares they're treating it like an
543.36s: offering and then chewy is choosing to
545.48s: buy 300 million of it and then
548.68s: concurrently they still have a 500
551.44s: million repurchase program that was off
553.80s: uh authorized and is separate from this
557.52s: so they're just scooping up 300 million
560.20s: of this 500 million 200 million will hit
562.96s: and then they still have this 500
564.68s: million uh repurchase program going on
567.24s: so overall interesting I find some of
570.12s: the the details behind it a little murky
572.32s: still I need to do a little bit more
573.72s: homework but that's just what I'm seeing
575.64s: so far so I thought folks might be
577.48s: interested at least in my rudimentary
580.12s: understanding I'm not an expert on this
582.28s: exact thing but that's what I read here
584.56s: so as always anything I should take a
586.48s: look at let me know later today I'm
588.64s: doing an outlier Pro live stream that's
590.76s: open to everybody I made a post on
592.52s: YouTube uh because I'm going to be
594.24s: breaking down some pretty big trades
595.92s: that I made for the fomc and I want to
598.16s: talk through how I structured those and
600.24s: then I also want to talk about kind of
601.56s: the current landscape of the market
603.16s: because I think things have changed a
604.48s: little bit and I think it's worthwhile
606.28s: having a conversation a little more
608.12s: detailed about what that means at least
610.20s: for the way that I'm treating the
611.24s: markets which is typically what I do in
612.96s: those Pro live stream sessions so
614.60s: completely free to join you can grab the
616.16s: link from the YouTube post it's unlisted
619.32s: so it's not going to show up on the
620.40s: YouTube channel otherwise as always if
622.68s: there's anything you want me to take a
623.64s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
625.56s: see you all later
