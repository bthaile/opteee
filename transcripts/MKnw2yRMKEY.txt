718.00s:  you
748.00s:  out and what our benchmarks are.
751.40s:  Because you could tell for, again,
754.32s:  perplexity or something else,
756.00s:  it's creating questions based on the average person.
760.16s:  And these questions that you see here
763.14s:  are even when I said make it much, much more challenging,
766.96s:  it gives me another joke of a question.
769.96s:  So when we're going through our trading career
773.96s:  and thinking about what we aspire to,
777.72s:  this is why I genuinely believe
780.72s:  the only worthwhile benchmark
785.08s:  for what you try to emulate and what you try to be
788.76s:  is a better version of yourself.
791.84s:  If there's ever a point in your trading career
794.60s:  or really in life,
796.08s:  this is sometimes my wife will do this sometimes
798.52s:  and it drives me fucking crazy.
800.32s:  Because she'll say like, oh,
801.88s:  it's much better than blank
804.12s:  or I'm not as bad as blank.
808.00s:  Or whatever it is about blank, right?
811.04s:  As like the benchmark comparison.
813.48s:  And I always remind her and I always remind you guys,
816.76s:  I couldn't literally possibly care less
820.16s:  what the average benchmark is.
823.96s:  I couldn't care less.
826.52s:  It makes no difference to me.
828.64s:  That's not the field I'm playing in.
830.64s:  That's not the field we operate in our community.
835.24s:  It is completely superfluous
838.28s:  beyond having it as a benchmark
840.64s:  because you do need to understand what average is.
843.96s:  That's just a general understanding of the landscape.
847.80s:  But when we're creating benchmarks
849.28s:  in terms of performance aspirations,
852.16s:  that ain't it.
853.60s:  That is not it.
855.44s:  Because when we go through something like a trading career,
861.24s:  we've already talked about this.
863.32s:  In order to be successful,
865.84s:  you already know you have to functionally be an outlier.
870.08s:  You have to be a statistical anomaly.
872.60s:  In order to be successful in trading longterm,
875.84s:  it is quite literally a requirement.
879.04s:  Now, again, we've done this similar study before
882.92s:  where if you think about the average trader
886.96s:  and what the average person's path looks like,
893.88s:  it's no wonder why the failure rate for trading
898.64s:  is so astronomically high.
902.80s:  Think of what the average person does
905.80s:  when they try to start trading.
908.52s:  They think that they're gonna make a bunch
910.12s:  of money super fast without risk.
911.84s:  They're gonna turn their $500 into a few million dollars,
915.00s:  cheap, easy, all those other buzzwords.
918.32s:  And no shit that most of them fail.
922.92s:  That's not the cohort that I'm gonna benchmark myself
926.56s:  against because again, if I'm doing something like climbing,
933.52s:  let's say going to Tanzania to go climb some of the mountains
937.20s:  there because that's what a lot of people do
939.68s:  beyond the safaris.
942.04s:  And if you go up Mount Kilimanjaro,
944.76s:  your comparison for Mount Kilimanjaro success rate
948.72s:  isn't like the number, the gross number of people
951.72s:  who ever think about climbing Mount Kilimanjaro,
955.36s:  it's the people that actually trained, prepared,
959.00s:  attempted and did or did not summit.
963.60s:  So when you decide to be a trader,
969.28s:  you have to change your reference benchmark immediately.
974.68s:  What average is and does only concerns you
980.68s:  from the context of understanding the landscape?
984.36s:  At no point, can you ever say,
987.88s:  oh, most people mess this up and then use that as a data point
993.56s:  to make yourself feel better about whatever it is
996.56s:  you're trying to make yourself feel better about?
999.44s:  You are going to have to be your own biggest critic,
1004.84s:  but it has to be healthy criticism.
1007.84s:  Anybody that's in the discord and is interacted with me
1010.60s:  there, you all know that I'm direct and I'm not pussy
1015.64s:  footing with anybody in there.
1017.16s:  And at no point is it to disrespect people.
1019.72s:  It's literally the last thing I care to do.
1022.72s:  But it's because in order to make some sort of meaningful growth
1027.00s:  and progression in your life, if you cannot take criticism,
1032.16s:  harsh, direct, robust criticism, onboard it,
1036.96s:  and then turn it into something to develop
1039.88s:  and optimize your approach further.
1042.00s:  This shit ain't going to work for you
1043.68s:  because the other thing I can tell you on the same thought process,
1046.44s:  going back to what I was just saying,
1048.40s:  you having to be your own biggest critic.
1051.92s:  The stuff that I talked to you all about is impassing typically
1056.00s:  a couple sentences about a specific topic, right?
1058.84s:  Like I'm only interacting with you and your perspective
1063.00s:  for a few moments in passing.
1066.04s:  You live with you.
1068.16s:  You are the one that has to analyze what you do
1072.16s:  so that you can try to create some level of success.
1075.08s:  The last thing I'll say on the same vein is that it is
1082.76s:  up to the person to determine the way that you move through markets.
1088.16s:  What I can tell you unequivocally is that markets
1092.40s:  are going to find every single one of your fucking weaknesses,
1098.00s:  every single one of them.
1099.28s:  They're going to be there if you're impulsive,
1101.56s:  if you suffer from analysis paralysis, if you're not thorough,
1104.64s:  if you're lazy, if you change your mind too frequently,
1108.56s:  if you're not consistent, if you're not thorough
1111.80s:  in historic research, if you're not methodical in planning,
1116.16s:  it will literally highlight every single issue you have.
1121.48s:  It's up to you as the trader to have your fucking eyes open,
1126.32s:  your ears open and to pay attention
1129.20s:  to what the market is telling you about you.
1132.64s:  It's going to tell you, but most people are too concerned
1136.96s:  about protecting the ego because the ego doesn't like being challenged.
1141.16s:  The ego gets uncomfortable if it's confronted,
1144.52s:  if somebody or something tells you you're wrong.
1147.60s:  This is a reason why most people don't like having trade logs
1151.24s:  is because it forces them to confront the reality
1154.60s:  of their strategy and their positions.
1157.56s:  People hate that and it's why they don't do it.
1160.44s:  It's literally why they don't do it.
1163.08s:  But if the goal is to try and do this
1167.20s:  and make meaningful amounts of money,
1169.44s:  it's what needs to be done.
1170.92s:  I made a post in the discord earlier today
1174.16s:  and I go out of my way to make posts like this
1178.08s:  mostly because I think people need to keep stuff in perspective
1183.96s:  and I think people need to understand
1187.36s:  the potential power that can come from this stuff.
1191.64s:  So this is a post I put earlier,
1194.64s:  long story short, Cliff Notes version for this post.
1197.56s:  I was talking to my mom on the phone earlier.
1199.24s:  She said that she was waking up kind of achy
1201.84s:  and then I was asking her about the conditions around that
1204.36s:  and she said, oh, well, I think my bed is like a divot in it,
1207.72s:  so the fucking mattress is old.
1209.36s:  While I was on the phone with her,
1210.36s:  I was just like, oh, we need to fix this.
1212.12s:  And I essentially go out and I find a,
1216.40s:  oh, thank you, Mr. Igor, great heads up.
1219.16s:  I find a mattress that I could get to her that I like
1224.00s:  because we use the satva mattress.
1226.52s:  We have a different one than this, but,
1231.84s:  the main point is that through trading and through investing,
1237.52s:  I've gotten to a point where I can essentially identify
1243.32s:  something I care about, spend very little time,
1246.88s:  like this purchase was made in 30 seconds
1248.76s:  from the time, literally from the time of her telling me.
1250.88s:  Because I knew the exact kind of mattress
1253.00s:  that I think would be good,
1254.32s:  talk to her a couple of seconds about it
1255.64s:  and launch the order, right?
1257.16s:  Done and done.
1258.28s:  So trading is fantastic.
1260.84s:  Trading enables really cool things,
1264.68s:  but it only gets to that point unless you allow yourself
1270.28s:  to go through the process,
1272.60s:  which is gonna include being wrong all the time.
1275.84s:  And it's gonna be a continual process
1278.08s:  of making really, really thorough, tough analysis of yourself
1283.24s:  and making yourself better.
1285.24s:  So that's my overall spiel on trading
1290.92s:  on why I think it's genuinely worth just about everybody's time.
1295.56s:  And I think if people approach it with the right mindset,
1300.28s:  it's entirely doable.
1301.60s:  It really is entirely doable.
1303.76s:  I think I generally embody some elements of that, right?
1309.32s:  Because I am not a genius.
1311.52s:  I genuinely am not.
1312.44s:  Like I am a fucking hyper normal person.
1315.88s:  But what I've done is figure out a way to lean
1318.48s:  into some of my strengths,
1320.28s:  to try to bolster some of my weaknesses,
1322.96s:  to create an interaction with markets that works.
1326.48s:  And what that looks like for other people will be different.
1330.16s:  And this is a big thing that I spend working on
1332.44s:  in the mentoring program that I have through Patreon
1335.56s:  is trying to help, and that's why I do it in that setting
1339.36s:  is because it takes a lot of time for an individual person
1343.28s:  to analyze themselves thoroughly and identify
1347.76s:  what kind of approach best fits them to interact with the market.
1353.20s:  It takes time to get to that level of understanding.
1356.04s:  It's not easy to piece together, I think,
1359.76s:  for a lot of people.
1360.80s:  So it's doable.
1363.68s:  It's not easy.
1365.20s:  It's simple, which is the beautiful part,
1367.40s:  but simple doesn't mean easy.
1369.20s:  So that Lawrence is being wrong all the time,
1372.48s:  makes it super exciting when I'm right.
1374.20s:  See, but that's also a problem, Lauren.
1376.40s:  You already know.
1377.20s:  Lauren, damn it, Lauren.
1379.28s:  You're the first fucking name I see in the chat,
1381.84s:  and then I already got to start tearing in to some shit.
1385.28s:  Sorry, Lauren.
1386.60s:  The problem, what, you guys tell me,
1388.84s:  what's the problem?
1389.68s:  What issue do I have with what Lauren just said?
1393.48s:  You guys already know, you guys already know
1396.76s:  that I have a problem with that probably.
1399.20s:  So what do you think my, my ish is no feelings at law at all,
1404.04s:  no feelings at law at all, Lauren, that's not it either.
1407.00s:  Reese is not correct.
1409.24s:  Tommy says exciting is the issue.
1410.80s:  That's correct.
1411.64s:  That's exactly correct.
1413.28s:  Lauren says, that's okay.
1414.40s:  I'll cry to my long legs.
1415.64s:  Well, I think by the time your,
1417.68s:  your tears finish flowing, they would probably evaporate
1420.88s:  after, you know, expanding the surface area of your legs.
1425.32s:  But the recess hyperbole hyperbole is fine,
1429.84s:  but again, like people think that,
1431.40s:  people genuinely think that the target is to have no feelings
1434.88s:  and that's not accurate.
1435.92s:  It's genuinely not accurate.
1437.64s:  So the reason is because it's completely unobtainable.
1443.08s:  But what Tommy said is exactly correct.
1445.68s:  Exciting.
1446.96s:  So Lauren, from your perspective,
1449.44s:  why do you think that I take issue with the concept of exciting?
1454.80s:  Why do you think that I specifically call that out for you?
1458.88s:  Exciting.
1460.48s:  There's two reasons.
1465.44s:  And you already know, all right, thank God.
1467.08s:  My watch is finished charging.
1469.08s:  So I have this, I use my Garmin dive watches
1471.56s:  like my daily watch, just because I don't like changing it.
1475.96s:  And part of my OCD is making sure that it's charged, obviously.
1480.80s:  But then it feels super weird when it's not on my wrist.
1486.32s:  That Lauren says exciting is not calculated.
1488.20s:  That's one of the issues.
1489.40s:  There's two main things that I want to talk about
1492.52s:  with this concept of excitement.
1496.32s:  Let me see if I can get my little marker up here.
1498.44s:  Okay, so,
1500.44s:  trader,
1502.76s:  I guess there's two hours in trader.
1506.16s:  Trader feelings.
1511.00s:  Cyteman.
1515.96s:  So in this context, something like excitement means happy.
1520.40s:  Affirmed.
1526.80s:  I don't know what else you would joyous maybe.
1529.40s:  It's just kind of
1532.12s:  a synonym for happy.
1533.60s:  But the really the thing I'm trying to highlight is that there's obviously a feeling of
1537.32s:  elation to a degree.
1538.52s:  And then there's a feeling of affirmation here.
1542.08s:  So these feelings exactly as you guys point out to the first component,
1548.44s:  which Lauren highlights is excited.
1554.16s:  Alters.
1556.36s:  Decision making.
1561.72s:  That's problem one.
1563.08s:  There's actually a second and a bigger problem here.
1565.96s:  So this is the first problem.
1567.44s:  What's the second problem that you think I have here?
1572.20s:  There you go.
1573.20s:  Lauren is actually talking about it right now.
1575.20s:  If you guys can see,
1578.20s:  Reese says if we're too excited,
1579.20s:  we'll be too disheartened if it doesn't go our way, right?
1581.20s:  So then we'll obviously go through the the ebb and flow.
1584.20s:  We'll have the general ebb and flow.
1588.20s:  Of emotions.
1592.20s:  Which I normally draws this.
1595.20s:  And what I try to do is
1597.20s:  which I normally draws this.
1600.20s:  And what I try to describe to you guys is like the outlier emotional cycle,
1606.00s:  as I call it.
1607.76s:  Should be more like this.
1609.20s:  And well, let's just call this like the midline.
1612.20s:  Sorry.
1613.60s:  Something like that.
1614.80s:  So this is obviously happy.
1617.40s:  This is sad.
1619.40s:  So this is the standard cycle for a lot of people.
1624.60s:  And my argument for outlier trading.
1631.60s:  Is it should look like this.
1634.60s:  So the ideas were dampening.
1636.60s:  We're dampening our emotional response.
1639.60s:  For those that don't know,
1641.60s:  when you have an emotional response to something,
1644.60s:  and it's a response, just get rid of the word emotional.
1647.60s:  When you respond to something,
1649.60s:  there are a series of biological and physiological effects that occur.
1654.60s:  Some of them are mental.
1655.60s:  Some of them literally are chemical.
1657.60s:  Right.
1658.60s:  So think of it if you consider
1663.60s:  when you get excited.
1666.60s:  Typically your heart rate will pick up a little bit.
1668.60s:  Typically your attention will pick up a little bit.
1671.60s:  Typically your eyes will open up a little bit more.
1674.60s:  Right.
1675.60s:  You're trying to take in more information, more of the stimulus.
1678.60s:  I'm just highlighting some of the physical responses.
1681.60s:  The issue with this is these two go together.
1685.60s:  Happiness and sadness.
1687.60s:  If you experience big happiness,
1689.60s:  you're going to experience big sadness.
1691.60s:  That doesn't mean that you can experience.
1693.60s:  You don't have you shouldn't experience happiness.
1696.60s:  You obviously should.
1697.60s:  But it should be tempered.
1698.60s:  Now, this second part is even more important than this first part in my opinion.
1707.60s:  Part do.
1709.60s:  Do.
1710.60s:  What is it?
1711.60s:  Do.
1712.60s:  I think that's like French, right?
1714.60s:  Is that French?
1715.60s:  Part do.
1716.60s:  I don't know how to say that.
1717.60s:  Do.
1720.60s:  I'm going French.
1723.60s:  So Lauren, based on your last comment,
1727.60s:  what's the second thing that I'm highlighting here?
1732.60s:  So I gave you the first error with excitement.
1735.60s:  The first error with excitement is that it alters your decision making,
1740.60s:  and then you're going to send yourself down the emotional path.
1745.60s:  One, dough, Troy.
1748.60s:  But how do you say dough?
1750.60s:  Is it dough?
1752.60s:  Need to know how to say that.
1755.60s:  Do.
1756.60s:  Somebody phonetic it out for me.
1759.60s:  You guys know I do well with phonetic spellings.
1762.60s:  That's one of, I actually realized that that's, it's death.
1767.60s:  Not death.
1769.60s:  Not death.
1772.60s:  Do.
1773.60s:  Oh, do might be it.
1777.60s:  I thought it was do.
1779.60s:  Yeah, okay.
1780.60s:  So I think you guys got it.
1783.60s:  I got a pop door for you.
1785.60s:  I got a pop door for you.
1787.60s:  Okay.
1790.60s:  Do.
1793.60s:  The U sounds like the U and push.
1797.60s:  Push.
1799.60s:  Do.
1802.60s:  Do.
1805.60s:  Do.
1808.60s:  Do.
1811.60s:  Do.
1814.60s:  Do.
1817.60s:  Do.
1819.60s:  Do.
1823.60s:  There's a soft R on the, okay, you guys are fucking me up.
1826.60s:  I thought hold on.
1828.60s:  You guys have me all over the place.
1830.60s:  Somebody has me putting a fucking R in there.
1833.60s:  I'm going to go and do.
1836.60s:  Alright, D, E, U, X pronunciation.
1840.60s:  Here we go.
1856.60s:  Do.
1858.60s:  Do is do do
1865.88s:  Do
1868.84s:  There's no r
1870.84s:  One of you always trying to give me to say an r it's do
1874.76s:  And the guy that that that just taught me that on youtube was very specific that it goes like that
1879.80s:  Okay, so then back to this part to back to part do
1884.52s:  um
1887.24s:  Here's the nobody's got it so far
1890.52s:  Lizzie says there's a soft art not not my fucking french coach
1894.28s:  Lizzie that i just spoke with hold on i'll send you the link so you can hear him he sounds legit
1900.28s:  I actually didn't even pick up the youtube channel um so i can't actually confirm
1907.72s:  That
1910.84s:  He's good he sounded good
1916.60s:  To pronounce
1919.64s:  UX
1920.92s:  I'll send you the channel right now this guy by julienne me
1924.36s:  Miguel that's like about as legit as it sounds
1927.72s:  There you go
1930.44s:  Well my tutor julienne megel says it's not like that
1936.60s:  So we'll have to
1940.28s:  We'll have to continue the fight about it
1943.80s:  Okay
1945.88s:  Back to this
1947.56s:  Back to part do
1950.68s:  What's the bigger issue here? What's the bigger issue with excitement
1954.68s:  I want you to think about the impact that this can have not on this instance
1961.88s:  But on your performance and your behavior is a trade or long term
1965.96s:  There's a very specific thing. I want you to identify with this and why it's problematic
1976.28s:  Greed that's not it
1978.12s:  It's close you're on the right path, but that's not it
1985.64s:  GCM says my excitement causes me to overhaul that's not it
1992.92s:  We'll give you a couple more guesses see if anybody can get it see if anybody can get the fake internet point
2000.52s:  It's ready to go the fake internet point is queued up ready to be
2004.84s:  Just offered to whoever crushes it failure. Nope. That's not it
2012.76s:  Reese says I miss the question that sucks
2016.68s:  Joe says I get underwhelmed and cut too early that's not it
2020.52s:  Lance says equal negative portfolios. That's not it good guesses, but that's not it
2026.44s:  I want you to think about
2031.56s:  I want you to think about this
2034.20s:  You
2045.48s:  What happens in this path
2051.80s:  If you're trading a system and then you have two losing trades in a row and then you have your winning trade
2058.44s:  Between this you you start off. You're like add that kind of sucks
2062.12s:  Okay, this isn't going super great. I hope the next one works. Ah great. Yes. This one worked. This is perfect
2069.64s:  Awesome. So now let's
2073.00s:  build this out
2075.40s:  into a longer series of trades
2080.36s:  The reason why excitement
2083.96s:  Becomes a problem TCM king is very close
2087.40s:  The reason why excitement is the problem is because it's literally
2102.20s:  It's a misaligned trade expectation
2105.48s:  We're focusing on the wrong thing
2109.80s:  What I mean by this is whether or not you have a trade that's a winning position or a losing position
2115.64s:  Genuinely
2117.16s:  Should not move you much one way or the other
2120.44s:  Genuinely, it should not move you much
2123.16s:  The reason why it should not move you much is because when we're trading we're trading in the service of a system
2129.56s:  That's designed to be moved over the long run
2133.96s:  So the reason why excitement is a problem is because it creates a vicious cycle
2140.44s:  In terms of literally decision altering biochemical responses
2145.96s:  But the bigger problem is that it creates misaligned incentives
2151.24s:  You start pursuing the sensation of excitement when you're right
2157.24s:  There's nothing wrong with wanting to be right. There's some traders who are drastically motivated by that
2163.40s:  The problem though is that it's emphasizing the wrong
2167.96s:  aspect of a successful trade
2172.60s:  Right, so for me
2175.64s:  I would consider a successful trade
2179.56s:  To be something where I'm executing a defined and researched strategy
2185.80s:  That I know is positively expectant in the long run
2191.24s:  That's what I care about
2193.32s:  So if that includes taking losing trades in pursuit of the winning trades, that's okay
2198.68s:  It obviously needs to make money to make sense
2201.80s:  But the main thing is to not have misaligned incentives for your trades
2207.80s:  The incentive for the trade should be the deployment of a positively expectant strategy
2212.36s:  It shouldn't be for entertainment for excitement for thrills
2217.88s:  You can have to be clear
2219.96s:  Really small elements of your portfolio that you like to do that with
2224.20s:  As long as you can mentally partition them
2227.80s:  Right because let's say for example that you like to gamble
2230.76s:  You like to wage your money to try to make money that's okay
2233.64s:  There's nothing inherently wrong with that
2235.72s:  It's wrong when it goes out of control
2238.12s:  And the other thing I can say is
2240.52s:  I would rather somebody
2242.52s:  That gets their kicks off of an individual trade than going and buying a scratch off from the lottery
2248.36s:  Right like the better risk proposition probably with respect to trading
2253.32s:  But in trading if we overemphasize the
2260.36s:  Feeling we get on a winning trade
2264.04s:  It starts to skew everything that we do
2267.64s:  And it literally is a misaligned incentive
2271.00s:  Black mom is this hit home runs and cut loser small maybe
2275.32s:  Again, we can't make sweeping statements like that
2278.20s:  The reason why you can't make a sweeping statement like that is because it
2282.20s:  It depends entirely on the system
2285.64s:  You don't have to cut loser small
2288.68s:  You don't
2289.64s:  It depends entirely on the system
2292.44s:  So the important way to think about it is that there isn't a one-size-fits-all rule
2299.72s:  That will holistically cover all of this stuff
2302.76s:  In terms of what you should do in managing your risk
2306.44s:  It doesn't exist because the conditions are going to be unique based on what you're doing
2311.48s:  So the
2313.24s:  Lesson there is that we actually can't say something like
2318.44s:  Let winners run and cut loser short
2322.36s:  It makes sense
2323.80s:  definitely can can hold water
2326.36s:  But it's still going to broadly depend on the strategy that we're running
2331.24s:  You can have strategies that have big losers but very few of them
2336.04s:  That can still be positively expected and there's nothing wrong with it
2340.60s:  The message the message there is to do something that makes sense relative
2345.80s:  Whatever the the strategy is that you're trying to run
2349.96s:  That's the idea
2352.12s:  So
2353.72s:  Those says of course who doesn't love being right and that's another that's another just common problem that traders face
2361.24s:  Is that sensation is really difficult for people to manage
2367.48s:  Right it's ego driven that's that's the whole idea of being right is ego driven
2373.40s:  once you learn how to sequester your ego and
2378.12s:  Value pursuing something else for me
2381.48s:  I prefer to value the pursuit of what I would consider to be correct
2387.24s:  Objectively correct information so that stuff that can be
2390.76s:  Quantified it can be qualified. It's something that's definable
2395.40s:  And a lot of times when I notice I'll debate with people on Reddit or you know in the discord
2403.64s:  And I say debate in a healthy sense. It's their healthy arguments
2407.24s:  Argument is another one of those words that most people think it means a bad thing
2411.48s:  But it doesn't like an argument is just the exchange of ideas that are typically opposing
2415.96s:  It's just when people have bad arguments. They tend to revert to things like ad homin and attacks and you know stuff like that
2423.24s:  But healthy arguments
2425.88s:  Sometimes people they get too wrapped up and trying to defend a point and you can always tell that perspective
2433.16s:  Because they will spend more time trying to prove theirs as compared to understand the other sides and then to explore truth together
2444.52s:  so
2445.72s:  It's a really really really delicate balance that's it's built over time without a doubt
2451.96s:  So let's take a look at the focus topic for today and
2458.36s:  this one is from
2461.00s:  Tommy
2463.56s:  And Tommy ask when to buy options versus sell options for
2470.76s:  Directional trades. This is a great question. It's also fortunately very easy to answer
2478.84s:  So we should
2481.08s:  Be able to move through this one pretty quickly hopefully in detail though. Obviously as you guys know I have a pension for for detail
2487.72s:  I think that's where a lot of
2490.04s:  The important information lies. So
2493.64s:  Let's talk about this
2496.60s:  First things first
2500.04s:  How do we even approach this so if I weren't here to kind of walk you through via a framework
2508.36s:  how would you in the chat
2511.88s:  Answer this question and I would love to see some of the responses
2516.92s:  The
2518.92s:  The reason why is because
2522.52s:  One of my approaches to doing things as a trader and again most people that interact with me have probably learned
2530.60s:  that I use
2533.16s:  Decisions that naturally narrow me down to a choice
2538.68s:  I don't just try to make the choice and I'll explain what that means in a moment
2544.44s:  But for you in the chat how would you respond to Tommy here
2548.36s:  GCM King says do both at the same time you could
2552.76s:  I don't think that's what I would do but yeah, you definitely could do that
2558.52s:  What else do you think?
2562.84s:  There's a couple really important elements to this that we have to dissect and understand together to get to the right answer because
2570.60s:  Here's the let me oh I forgot we can just draw on here. This is great. Let me grab a note pad
2580.84s:  Lizzie says depends on your trading objective here we go. This is the correct
2585.96s:  This is the correct path
2589.64s:  Uh, Tommy says portfolio needs positive or negative delta's if long isn't positively expected
2594.20s:  Look to sell options if risk reward is with intolerance that's not that's not quite actually
2599.24s:  Because you can get positive or negative delta's by buying or selling
2604.20s:  Right, it depends on what you buy yourself if you buy a call or sell a put you're getting the same positive delta's slightly different
2613.08s:  Behavior around them, but you're still getting positive delta's
2617.16s:  So starting with the portfolio need is definitely a big part of it. So here's the process that I would follow one
2625.24s:  portfolio need
2628.76s:  You
2631.72s:  What does this mean?
2634.44s:  This means I'm going to look at overall delta's
2643.32s:  Better beta weighted
2647.08s:  I'm going to look at gamma
2652.28s:  I'm going to look at theta
2656.36s:  I'll start here
2659.56s:  So then let's say that we get through the portfolio level analysis and there's no need
2666.92s:  We don't need anything now. I'll give you a quick scenario based on something like theta
2674.52s:  Let's say that
2676.76s:  We analyze the market whatever and we're looking through our portfolio and we find that we're short theta
2683.00s:  Depending on what you think about the market how you manage your portfolio for me. I don't like being short theta
2694.12s:  So here this would tell me I need long theta
2702.12s:  So then what is that back me into sell strategy
2705.72s:  Now whether that's done for a directional trade or a neutral trade that's all TBD
2713.16s:  But this is a portfolio driven need. I'm just giving this as an example
2718.04s:  If there's any questions on this let me know before I move on to the next step that I would take
2727.56s:  And you guys should know what I'm about to write in here
2735.64s:  Okay, so there's no questions on one great. Let's talk about number two
2742.12s:  What goes in here then we looked at the portfolio we're saying that we don't have a need
2747.64s:  We need to identify if we're going to buy or sell an option
2752.28s:  We know that we're looking for a directional trade for whatever reason
2755.48s:  That's what we prefer for the portfolio for the portfolio fit
2759.16s:  But we need to decide if we're going to buy or sell an option
2763.00s:  What's the next
2765.48s:  primary thing that will naturally back us into an answer we won't have to make a choice at the end of this
2772.52s:  The choice will be made by going through this framework and just answering
2778.12s:  Supporting questions that lead us to the answer
2783.80s:  Lizzie says opportunity that's very close. There's a specific terminology. I'm looking for here time frame
2789.48s:  Nope, you can buy or sell across timeframes again. They'll have slightly different behavior. That's not it
2799.16s:  Think of it this way
2802.28s:  If I'm looking at a stock
2805.56s:  And I expect the stock
2808.60s:  To go like this
2813.72s:  Think if I'm looking at another stock
2816.36s:  And I expect the stock to go like this
2825.88s:  How would this inform my decision making
2831.24s:  Wall sort of
2842.52s:  I'm grabbing uh
2846.20s:  I
2847.24s:  Trend is part of it. That's not it though
2855.40s:  What's the first step here
2860.12s:  In the outlier strategy process
2873.16s:  Profit mechanisms
2875.96s:  Why does profit mechanism come first
2880.28s:  profit mechanism
2882.52s:  Literally is going to back us into the answer
2892.92s:  If we're looking at something and the profit mechanism is a breakout
2898.92s:  Strong directional move
2906.28s:  If I'm trading something that I expect a strong directional move
2914.44s:  MSTR this is literally perfect if I'm looking at MSTR and I get into MSTR here when it's 296
2924.44s:  And I think that there's going to be a strong directional move
2928.84s:  Which scenario would I prefer
2932.12s:  Would I prefer to sell premium
2934.84s:  Incap my profit potential
2937.56s:  Or buy premium and maintain uncapped profit potential
2944.44s:  Which would I prefer if I'm thinking of a big move
2951.56s:  Tcm's on it I would much rather buy options
2956.36s:  Why wouldn't I want to buy options
2959.80s:  If I expect something to move a lot
2962.36s:  There are other details that need to be brought into the equation
2968.04s:  It's not as simple as
2970.76s:  I just think it's going to move a lot so I'm going to buy options. There's a couple more decisions that have to be made
2979.00s:  My
2982.52s:  My phone is
2986.60s:  What the fuck is that
2989.80s:  My
2992.76s:  My phone literally just started going off. I am going to close everything because
2999.24s:  It did this last night too
3002.36s:  Interestingly enough
3006.52s:  There was nothing open YouTube wasn't open
3009.48s:  Ah, it looks like there's there's an update which probably needs to be done
3014.84s:  I'm
3017.88s:  I'm going to update this bad boy. I was like what the fuck
3023.96s:  Um
3026.92s:  Tommy says if port needs neg theta no remember
3030.68s:  Right
3031.72s:  We already in the scenario that I gave you were saying that there isn't a portfolio need
3038.60s:  That's the that's the context here
3044.44s:  So the way that this decision is made for us is by the profit mechanism
3050.92s:  If I think something's going to move a lot I'm going to lean towards buying
3056.04s:  If something is less expected to move so maybe
3060.68s:  um smaller
3063.72s:  expectation
3065.88s:  Then this can be buy or sell
3068.84s:  And there's other things we can do to amplify the decision
3073.56s:  But before we worry about the nuance between this scenario
3079.16s:  There's a third point
3083.08s:  That again will naturally back us into a decision
3088.68s:  So I already told you about the profit mechanism
3093.16s:  Let's assume that in the profit mechanism we're including the signals to
3098.04s:  To
3100.04s:  Validate the profit mechanism. So let's just assume that that's done
3104.44s:  So how do we decide if we're going to buy or sell options we start with the portfolio need
3110.20s:  We then analyze what we're looking at the profit mechanisms signals to create alignment there
3115.80s:  There's a third step
3118.44s:  And again the third step is overarching
3123.96s:  And it's naturally going to back us into a decision
3126.44s:  So what's the third step?
3128.44s:  What's one of the things you have to look at for every single trade before you enter
3140.76s:  guesses
3144.04s:  What do we think what's something that you have to look at size very close
3148.84s:  You are very warm
3150.84s:  TCM I want you to zoom that idea out a little bit
3157.08s:  Recently, you're jumping to expected return not quite but that's
3163.08s:  That would be after this
3166.12s:  Execriteria is very close so far TCM is the closest
3173.40s:  What's one side of the trade that traders typically don't like to look at
3179.56s:  Sim is going to probabilities that's not it. It's a good guess, but that's not it
3184.84s:  if I'm
3186.44s:  Structure that's not it loss bingo Lizzie's got it
3190.68s:  And since that was a generally unassisted response
3195.96s:  Lizzie gets plus one fake internet point
3201.16s:  There it is congratulations
3205.88s:  MG trades also got it, but MG trades got it a little bit too late. So there's no fake internet point for you
3214.52s:  So sorry about that
3216.84s:  That's how life goes though
3226.04s:  Lost profile
3228.92s:  This is the next step that will back us into the scenario
3235.00s:  so
3237.56s:  Step one
3240.04s:  For folio need
3245.08s:  Step two
3247.16s:  Profit mechanism and signal step three
3253.24s:  Risk profile
3257.72s:  So now let's put this into action
3261.80s:  um
3263.72s:  Tommy
3265.88s:  Give me a recent ticker you were looking at
3271.40s:  for a directional trade
3274.60s:  and let's
3276.44s:  Build a trade together
3296.12s:  What you got Tommy Sim has the right question here what you got
3308.28s:  And it looks like Mel is requesting Carl Strauss for dinner
3312.76s:  Which I can accommodate
3322.68s:  Tommy did you fucking leave on us
3325.40s:  This straight bullshit
3327.48s:  You left on us. I'm not gonna forgive you
3333.88s:  It's like unforgivable behavior
3339.24s:  Here we go MSTR no you don't have to pick the trade that's the whole point you freak we're gonna do it together
3346.60s:  You know
3351.56s:  MSTR that'll be it so in the in this scenario
3356.44s:  Tommy has decided that he wants to get exposure
3362.36s:  To MSTR
3364.84s:  So let's take a look at it together
3368.68s:  Let's move this
3371.48s:  Now again in this scenario
3374.52s:  We have no portfolio need
3376.84s:  We're just looking to be long
3378.84s:  um
3379.88s:  Tommy
3381.08s:  What day are you looking at
3384.52s:  MSTR are you looking at are you wanting like are we talking about today? We're exploring this
3390.20s:  Or were you looking at this historically and if so how long ago were you looking at this
3396.28s:  Because we can use on demand to go back in time. I want to play the scenario as you saw it
3401.24s:  That's my intention
3417.08s:  So are we playing it from today or are we playing it from
3423.96s:  A week ago two weeks ago
3426.28s:  The 21st got it. Let's do this then
3429.24s:  So let's go
3431.24s:  And build trade we have to go to the 21st
3436.92s:  Oh yesterday. I don't know if this will let me do yesterday
3446.20s:  It doesn't we can't go back unfortunately because it's too close in time
3450.12s:  So let's just go off of building a trade from today that I imagine is the second best since we were looking at just yesterday
3458.28s:  So
3460.28s:  portfolio has no need
3463.24s:  We know that the profit mechanism is
3466.60s:  Gonna be movement so Tommy
3470.04s:  how do we
3472.68s:  qualify the profit mechanism in MSTR
3477.32s:  Remember the first level profit mechanism is very basic
3481.96s:  It'll be based on price up or down volatility up or down
3486.20s:  There's very simple traits for profit mechanism at a base level then the profit mechanism type
3492.92s:  Is where we get a little more specific
3496.28s:  So Tommy looking at this. What's our profit mechanism
3503.24s:  My assumption is that we're thinking price direction up. Yep. Okay, so price up
3509.00s:  So now Tommy
3511.56s:  Let's look at the type
3514.68s:  There are different types of price direction up
3518.92s:  We can have things like drift we can have things like momentum
3522.52s:  We can have things like breakout you don't have to get that specific
3526.04s:  Mostly what and you don't have to pick my terminology
3530.12s:  describe in a word picture
3533.48s:  The price direction up as you expect to see it
3537.16s:  Do you expect to see something that is
3541.40s:  Just kind of slowly drifting up
3543.88s:  Is it something that you're expecting to continue to see this kind of parabolic move up
3551.32s:  Those are really the two main scenarios
3554.28s:  Off the chain and expected to moon so we're expecting big movement. Okay
3559.40s:  So now
3561.96s:  Based on step two of our scenario I think the text is black so it's not gonna show up here. It'll be like
3570.60s:  Uh
3572.12s:  Yeah, let me move this over
3578.60s:  So based on step two
3581.08s:  We just decided that we're looking at a big move potentially
3587.48s:  Okay
3589.00s:  so out of buying or selling
3593.48s:  Which would we naturally drift towards in that scenario based specifically on the profit mechanism
3600.12s:  And the type to start
3607.96s:  We can either buy or we can sell
3612.04s:  Which one of those do you guys think fits better here
3620.60s:  Buying long calls okay
3623.24s:  So we're looking at buying that's what we're leaning towards
3626.84s:  So now we have to consider the risk profile
3629.96s:  So let's build the trade
3633.56s:  So we decide that we want to buy
3635.72s:  I'm just gonna default to some standard buy protocols just to move along
3641.08s:  And let's say that we look at like this 67
3644.92s:  Delta something like this we were looking at a couple other scenarios. I think yesterday
3649.40s:  I'll delete those
3651.24s:  So we're looking at this trade
3653.56s:  Or let's say that we were gonna sell we follow our standard selling
3659.00s:  Protocols and we look at something like this
3665.24s:  And now we have a comparison point
3668.28s:  So now what we can do
3670.76s:  Take a look at the chart
3674.28s:  And Tommy
3676.28s:  Based on your expectation
3680.84s:  Where would you deem
3682.84s:  Yourself wrong to the downside
3686.84s:  So if we're expecting price direction up we're expecting a big move
3691.88s:  Where did the downside would you consider yourself wrong?
3693.96s:  And then I realize I gotta take some might be pro for an over back
3716.20s:  So
3726.44s:  What do we got Tommy
3733.96s:  No answer from Tommy what the fuck
3737.72s:  362 so 362 is where we're wrong
3741.72s:  You
3744.68s:  Beautiful
3746.20s:  So Tommy is picking here
3750.92s:  That spot oh no, that's 360 my bad delete
3754.92s:  Delete delete
3757.16s:  Come into a three-month be more accurate for you
3760.68s:  I don't want to misrepresent your idea
3763.56s:  There's 362
3766.92s:  So now
3768.68s:  Let's come into the analyze tab
3771.40s:  Let's add our incorrect where we think we're wrong 362
3775.72s:  362
3778.76s:  This represents a bigger than 15% decline against us
3785.80s:  And let's take a look at these two trades
3788.36s:  So the long call at 362 is gonna lose you $5,000
3795.00s:  The short put at 362 is gonna lose you $21,44
3803.96s:  So now
3806.20s:  We look at step three
3808.52s:  So we grab this again
3810.52s:  I just gave you two scenarios
3814.20s:  Let me I'm just gonna change the color of this
3817.56s:  So
3822.60s:  So that we can keep it here so I don't have to keep dragging that other thing over
3826.20s:  So one port need
3831.32s:  Two
3833.32s:  Profit mechanism in type
3837.24s:  and signal
3839.24s:  Three
3841.96s:  Risk profile
3847.00s:  So here we have 5k
3852.28s:  For the long call risk profile at loss target to start
3857.64s:  5k in the long call
3860.44s:  2.1k on the short put
3863.96s:  So
3865.24s:  Tommy
3870.36s:  Tommy says I missed how you changed toss to see the loss on the short put can you step through again
3875.32s:  You just click it at the bottom
3877.32s:  So you just right click and hit analyze trade or you can anything like that it'll be
3883.48s:  um
3885.00s:  It'll pop up on the risk profile
3887.80s:  The other thing is for those that don't have think or swim you you literally don't you don't need think or swim to answer the question for you
3896.52s:  This just makes a little bit easier
3898.76s:  But the other thing you can do and this will confuse everybody
3902.20s:  But I'm going to show you anyway for those that are able to understand it
3906.28s:  You can look at what I do I call the surrogate option right
3910.84s:  So for the surrogate option
3914.36s:  We're saying right now micro strategy is at 422 and we're wrong at 362
3920.68s:  So it's a 60 point drop
3923.08s:  So what we need to do is look at a 60 point change in the underlying from where it's at
3931.00s:  And then we can look at our options
3934.44s:  Right, so we're saying that we're short the 310
3939.48s:  So then if we move 60 points we can simulate what our option would look like
3946.84s:  So in this case we get in for like five
3951.08s:  56
3952.68s:  If we move 60 points our option will look like these three 70s
3958.36s:  So
3959.32s:  So then you can eyeball what the variance is between those premiums
3964.12s:  And that can be another way just to speculate and eyeball
3969.16s:  What the loss could be at your point you can also just do the math those are just two as you waste to do it
3973.96s:  um
3976.12s:  Tommy says I only see the long call yeah, it's just because the screen's too big
3979.96s:  So the screen that I have is like 49 inches you guys can't see the full width as I have it
3985.48s:  But I'm just literally clicking the boxes to check on check
3990.12s:  So back to the question though
3993.24s:  The the next question here is
3997.40s:  What do we think about both of these loss points
4004.04s:  What do you think in a nutshell
4007.64s:  They're very different
4009.40s:  So from a risk management perspective for the portfolio
4013.16s:  There might be a clear preference
4016.20s:  Based on the size of the portfolio
4018.76s:  Let's say that we're assuming a hundred thousand dollar account
4021.96s:  Well, if you have a one hundred thousand dollar account
4025.96s:  And you consume a five thousand dollar loss
4030.52s:  That's a five percent drawdown on the account
4033.64s:  That's a problem
4036.28s:  Tommy says long call has unlimited upside short put doesn't that's not what I'm talking about here
4040.60s:  Remember we're looking right now
4042.60s:  Specifically at the lost target
4046.36s:  Very specifically at the lost target
4050.36s:  So what I'm saying is the whole point of analyzing the the risk profile part of this trade is again
4056.12s:  I'm trying I'm showing you that we can naturally back ourselves into a decision
4062.36s:  Right, so if we look at a scenario where we have a one hundred thousand dollar account
4069.48s:  This one
4072.60s:  Is a five percent drawdown this one is a 2.1 percent drawdown
4079.64s:  From a risk management perspective
4083.32s:  Which one of these fits into the portfolio now to be clear
4087.72s:  Either one of these
4089.72s:  Can be completely fine
4091.72s:  But it's based on the way that you run the portfolio
4094.76s:  It's based on the way that you run the strategies
4097.64s:  So again, remember going back to the point we said earlier
4100.36s:  Way towards the beginning of this stream that you can't just arbitrarily pick something
4104.44s:  It has to make sense based on what you're doing
4106.92s:  So let's say for example
4109.16s:  our portfolio
4111.64s:  Has a maximum drawdown for a directional position like this of two percent
4119.00s:  Well, if your maximum drawdown potential in this kind of trade is two percent based on your strategy
4125.40s:  You are naturally backed out of the long call
4128.84s:  You don't get to pick it. It doesn't fit your risk profile
4133.40s:  now let's just assume
4136.36s:  That either one of these was fine that you don't actually care
4140.84s:  And that you can go up to five percent for example, which I would argue is way too large to be clear on a hundred thousand dollar portfolio of five thousand dollar drawdown
4151.00s:  Is likely too big and I'm actually going to show you why
4154.44s:  It's probably too big
4155.96s:  So the next step here is we actually have to assign probabilities to this
4161.56s:  So what's the probability?
4165.88s:  Probability of a touch at 362
4170.68s:  These two we're going to have different probabilities
4173.56s:  Because this is a longer term trade. This is a shorter term trade
4177.48s:  We can normalize
4179.48s:  And use the shorter term window for the comparison
4183.32s:  So here we have the 17 Jan 25 the 310 puts
4190.12s:  56 days
4191.48s:  Well, we could say that we're going to manage the trade before it falls within sub 20 days
4199.08s:  Right, so it means that we're going to manage it sometime within the next 36 days
4205.00s:  So that means we can eyeball what is this likely to do over the next 36 days
4211.56s:  So we can come in here
4214.12s:  We can go to probability analysis we can say at 36 days
4218.60s:  Right, so here's our 30-day window at the 22nd
4224.44s:  31 32
4226.84s:  33 34 35 36
4230.76s:  Something something like this
4234.12s:  So we'll look at the 27th and we'll say what's the probability of a touch at 362
4239.64s:  Within that 36-day range. Let's go to 362
4247.32s:  Like a 85
4250.68s:  0.5 percent chance
4253.88s:  So what I'm highlighting is we know we're trading something that's obscenely volatile
4261.40s:  So not only are we looking at
4265.32s:  uh
4266.60s:  Too big
4268.60s:  A size of a loss
4271.16s:  5k and 21k
4273.48s:  But now we can reconcile that the probability of a touch here is like 85 percent chance
4284.28s:  So now
4287.08s:  We can complete an expected return calculation
4291.16s:  Or we can remodel the trade
4294.84s:  But what I can say is for my own approach on a directional breakout style strategy
4301.24s:  Having an 85 percent chance of a loss modeling of $100,000 portfolio
4306.92s:  $5,000 is unacceptable
4308.60s:  And I actually would even argue 20 to $2,000 is probably unacceptable. It's probably too much
4314.12s:  It's
4316.68s:  We're talking about something that's super volatile
4319.64s:  So then what can we do here to remodel this
4322.60s:  Well
4324.92s:  We can take a look either at a different analysis
4329.08s:  But we shouldn't go back and overfit our analysis because we don't like this number. That's not the right answer
4334.92s:  So what we need to do is figure out how can we decrease
4339.08s:  The risk
4341.48s:  Here and here
4343.48s:  For the short put or the long call
4346.20s:  So we need to go back
4348.44s:  And we need to figure it out so we can say
4351.40s:  If instead of going
4353.40s:  91 days to the 67 delta
4359.40s:  Maybe we go further out of the money
4362.36s:  On the calls
4364.36s:  And we say what would this be worth at 362
4368.20s:  All of a sudden this becomes $3800
4371.08s:  We're starting to move in the correct direction by going further out
4375.64s:  Of the money. It's still a relatively high delta
4381.00s:  So
4382.04s:  Then we can add more strikes
4387.88s:  And we can say maybe instead of doing a 50 delta we do a lower 46 delta. Let's see actually
4395.48s:  Any of these that like genuinely look okay
4399.72s:  This is a 39 delta with
4402.84s:  1672 OI
4405.32s:  So this is okay
4408.28s:  This loses three grand so it still would be a little bit too much
4413.32s:  So you might have to include
4415.72s:  Another element to this trade you can restructure the trade a few different ways
4421.96s:  So we can look at
4424.92s:  Doing something like this again. So we have the four forties
4428.84s:  Which are like a 60 delta
4430.84s:  But then maybe we come in here to the 60s
4434.20s:  And
4436.20s:  We sell
4438.52s:  The 890s
4440.92s:  And we create a diagonal
4443.96s:  Which would look like this
4448.84s:  And we can do it off of either of these we could do it off of this or this
4454.44s:  So notice on this trade here
4458.12s:  We essentially
4460.12s:  Cut our risk now down to 23 hundred bucks
4463.88s:  But we still have
4466.12s:  Significant upside profit potential it can go too far you do have to manage the trade
4472.52s:  But this is easy to deal with
4477.48s:  This is a way that you can also reduce your risk
4480.92s:  I'm giving you guys different ways you can look at this then we'll pick one
4486.44s:  What I'm showing is the way that we decide
4489.96s:  Whether to buy or sell as you can tell so far
4493.80s:  It's about a series of analysis. It's not about just picking
4499.40s:  Oh, I want to buy or oh, I want to sell
4503.40s:  It's not based on that at all the decision is effectively made for us
4507.96s:  As we look at these different criteria. That's the idea here
4512.92s:  So now
4515.32s:  Black says examples are going to reflect at expiration or zero
4519.08s:  That's incorrect because you notice how the example that I'm giving you here has too long
4524.60s:  We have the purple line which actually represents today
4529.16s:  And then we have seven December which represents at expiration for the near term option
4535.96s:  So the example here doesn't actually
4540.68s:  Reflect at expiration it actually reflects today, which is why it's a good example
4545.40s:  So
4550.92s:  Back to the analysis though because we also identified that selling this putt was a little bit too much right to grand
4558.36s:  Don't really love that
4560.12s:  Still too big of a loss so then what can we do?
4563.64s:  On the put side
4566.28s:  We can decide and instead of a 20 delta
4570.76s:  We could say maybe we do a 15 delta
4576.20s:  So we scrub some of those delta's off
4582.60s:  So now
4585.88s:  On our 15 delta notice that our risk is only 1600 bucks
4592.36s:  So now you're looking at a scenario where
4597.40s:  You're risking 1.6% of the portfolio which again even for me that's still a little too high to be completely honest on a trade like
4605.24s:  This that's super volatile
4607.24s:  But again, I'm showing you tools to manage the overall risk profile
4614.52s:  Based on what we expect to see
4617.40s:  The reason why I don't like
4619.40s:  Risking this much on something like this is because it is literally so volatile
4624.04s:  It's an exceedingly high probability that you're going to get stopped out at your target lost target of 362
4631.64s:  362 is so close to this thing
4635.24s:  If we look at the five-day average range it's literally 20% the 20 days 12 and a half percent the 90 days 8.9%
4644.44s:  So pretty much in any of those scenarios during standard normal market movement
4649.88s:  This is essentially at threat of being hit essentially not quite but very close
4656.36s:  So the overall probability
4659.48s:  Is relatively high, but again, that's also using just a standard distribution
4664.76s:  If we look at what we do in technical analysis and look at trend
4669.32s:  Then yeah, maybe this is
4672.28s:  Okay, maybe we think that it's going to be a little bit more bullish
4676.92s:  Now the way that I personally would look at this is I actually don't see anything magical about 362
4686.44s:  And the way that I would look at this would be if I'm trading this with the intent of getting in now
4693.16s:  And I want to be wrong fast. I would probably use below the lows of today
4701.24s:  And the reason for that is
4704.20s:  So that I'm not consuming a bigger loss as this thing oscillates
4709.96s:  And I would either be right quickly or wrong quickly
4715.40s:  And I would rather lean on my technical analysis in the assumption that it's going to go up
4722.44s:  Rather than give it a bunch of room to move around before it may or may not go up
4726.76s:  That's the way that I would look at it. So the reason why I voice that is you can already see
4731.80s:  Where my current overall alert is sitting right 392 42
4737.48s:  This is the first alert that I have set where if it breaks below this I would want to know now again
4743.08s:  I got into this earlier, but I would start scaling out
4746.92s:  If it's in the zone of course and the reason why I would do that is because
4751.40s:  The overall risk starts to expand because of how volatile it is
4758.36s:  So that has to be
4761.08s:  Considered pretty strongly
4763.08s:  Otherwise you can run into some problems
4766.28s:  With the way that you position the trade
4769.00s:  So that's that
4771.72s:  Now
4772.92s:  If we look at 392 42
4775.64s:  And we update this loss point we add another for example
4780.60s:  Of 392 42 392. 42
4784.60s:  We know that the probability of this being hit is super high
4789.48s:  So right now we're essentially saying oops 392 is what I wanted
4796.12s:  What we're essentially saying here is I'm either going to be right fast or wrong fast
4803.32s:  That's again the way that I tend to trade breakouts
4806.76s:  Especially in something that's highly volatile
4810.04s:  If something is not as volatile
4812.36s:  I don't mind giving it a little bit of room to move in again
4815.40s:  This is for a very specific strategy of mine breakouts
4818.84s:  If I'm trading something like momentum
4821.88s:  giving again
4824.04s:  Some context for different ways to set this up
4828.28s:  so
4829.88s:  The way that I trade something like momentum here is maybe it needs to have a little bit more room
4836.36s:  Because I'm expecting it to oscillate as it moves up
4839.80s:  And for a momentum style approach it would essentially follow the
4846.44s:  The series of trade us we were just looking at
4849.08s:  so
4850.52s:  If I'm using momentum and I want to cap risk of the portfolio at about a percent
4855.80s:  I don't want to lose more than one percent of the portfolio on this one individual trade
4859.80s:  So then we need to find a way to lose no more than a thousand dollars
4863.56s:  And that's how we have to structure this thing
4865.72s:  We can't lose more than a thousand bucks
4867.96s:  So one of the easy ways to get there is by selling the 17 Jan 25 to 60 puts
4873.80s:  This also is a really high probability of profit trade
4877.24s:  So this gives us a total profit potential of 34 75 you do not get to participate as much
4883.56s:  To the upside the reason why I'm giving this to you as an example
4887.56s:  Is because if we oh no, I forgot it changed it so that you could see
4891.56s:  Is because if you'll remember
4894.04s:  Based on the profit mechanism analysis
4897.64s:  We were originally favoring buying options
4902.04s:  That fits our profit mechanism in type much better
4907.56s:  but
4909.00s:  risk
4910.20s:  Has to be assessed
4912.20s:  And management of risk is going to overcome what our profit preferences look like
4919.64s:  Right, this is the this is the part where we look at what I call the ugly side of the trade
4925.88s:  We look at the part of the trade that we're not excited about
4928.92s:  And we say this is what I would love to happen
4930.92s:  And this is how I would love to set up for the scenario that I think might happen
4934.52s:  But
4935.80s:  It has to be done in the context of risk management
4941.72s:  So here
4943.24s:  This is essentially what would end up having to go on in a one hundred thousand dollar portfolio
4949.00s:  Now again, there's other scenarios that could be built out
4953.48s:  one of them
4955.96s:  Could be this
4957.48s:  Instead of going 90 days out we could go out less far and time so we're paying less for the long options
4965.08s:  And we can still go further out of the money
4968.60s:  We could do like the 990s
4971.72s:  There are 34 delta
4974.76s:  And if we look at the 990s at
4979.16s:  362 still too much but at 392 it's more palatable
4984.84s:  We're at
4986.44s:  15 sixteen hundred dollar loss at that point
4991.40s:  A little bit more tolerable
4993.88s:  This is if you expect a big move and we can look at the expected return here
4998.28s:  So now Tommy one more question for you
5000.60s:  Where do you think in your to the moon analysis
5004.52s:  Where do you think MSTR might go
5006.92s:  And throw that in the chat
5009.32s:  In the meantime, I'll show you how I would arrive at a profit target
5012.68s:  I would look at something like near term highs which in this case is 536
5016.44s:  I think it's a little bit higher actually up here. What is it?
5018.76s:  543
5020.12s:  So let's call it
5021.72s:  543 or 550 whatever is fine
5024.60s:  And then we go in here and we do the same analysis
5028.04s:  Over the 36 days
5030.12s:  And we think it's going to go to 550
5033.72s:  There's a 63 percent chance
5036.76s:  So now we have to do a little bit of math
5044.28s:  We have a profit target
5047.00s:  550
5049.16s:  63 percent chance
5053.08s:  At that profit target
5060.60s:  Add this
5063.24s:  550
5066.20s:  At that profit target on the long call we make 4200 bucks
5071.32s:  So LC
5074.12s:  Is 4200 bucks
5078.76s:  Lost target using the
5082.20s:  362
5088.92s:  1600 bucks
5096.12s:  The
5101.08s:  The probability of touching 362
5104.68s:  In that time frame
5113.16s:  I literally can't even read it. It's so condensed
5125.80s:  86
5130.36s:  Like 85.5
5136.04s:  This is for the long call
5149.40s:  Here's our lost target
5155.24s:  You
5185.88s:  Here's your expected return for the strategy for the long call
5203.08s:  And I'm literally building this little calculator
5205.40s:  So that you can take a look at it for yourself. You can make your own version of this
5211.40s:  So that you can compare
5213.40s:  And now let's take a look at the short put scenario
5224.44s:  So here we lose
5230.28s:  A thousand bucks
5237.80s:  And for this we would again manage within like that 30 day window
5244.04s:  And
5246.04s:  Our max profit is 34.75 but again, we're not probably going to get to the max profit because we're going to manage it early
5253.64s:  I would just ballpark we could actually ballpark what it would be
5257.96s:  But it's not a guess the 990 let's take a look at what this is like with like 20 days left or something. That's like a 990
5266.76s:  Here it's worth
5273.48s:  Oh, no, that's on the call side on the put side. What did we do?
5281.72s:  The 260
5286.76s:  So here the 260 put
5294.04s:  Is trading for 38.5
5298.20s:  Here
5300.76s:  260
5303.00s:  Is trading for
5305.88s:  1935
5307.16s:  2038 and a half 19
5311.00s:  35
5312.76s:  So these are numbers and what I'm showing you is a way that you can
5319.24s:  39 and a half 19
5322.84s:  35
5324.36s:  I said I don't really remember
5326.52s:  I'm showing you how you can eyeball what your options would be worth in the time frame
5331.96s:  Stop you learn the fucking percentages
5334.84s:  2015 so you stand to make 2015
5340.28s:  Here
5344.92s:  Here's your expected return for this strategy
5352.28s:  So now
5354.44s:  You get to make a fully informed decision based on what you expect to happen
5361.56s:  This
5364.04s:  Might seem like a lot of work
5366.44s:  The fun part is you don't actually have to do this for every single trade once you get a sense for how this looks
5374.44s:  It becomes much more in a
5377.88s:  But
5379.40s:  This is what you're left with
5381.88s:  You have a trade where you might lose 1600 bucks
5386.76s:  But make 4200 if it hits your target you have another trade that will make you two grand
5393.16s:  Might lose you a thousand bucks
5396.04s:  They both have a high probability of being stopped out
5403.24s:  So then it literally is a function of which of these do you prefer for me
5408.84s:  If I'm thinking a big move this is the clear winner
5412.84s:  I'm risking a little bit more money
5416.12s:  But I slightly prefer this probability based on the price movement I see
5422.76s:  If I need to manage the risk and the portfolio better this literally cuts
5428.92s:  Essentially six basis points off of your total risk
5434.76s:  So then you can naturally back yourself into the decision based on the risk side of the equation
5440.44s:  What do you guys think?
5443.64s:  Does the process that we just went through make sense this doesn't apply to buying options or selling options for directional trades
5451.32s:  This literally applies to any trade that you're looking at for quite literally any reason
5457.08s:  We're looking at this in the context of buying versus selling options
5462.20s:  But this is a way that you systematize the entire process
5467.32s:  So that there literally is no lingering questions
5470.92s:  It the the entire scenario becomes answered by itself
5477.72s:  So to recap
5480.52s:  What this whole thing looks like is like this
5489.64s:  One
5490.76s:  Portfit
5493.08s:  So
5495.08s:  This is if we need theta
5498.84s:  We have gamma concerns
5502.04s:  Because delta's we can manufacture to be whatever we want by buying or selling that's why delta doesn't matter here
5508.20s:  The second thing is the profit mechanism
5511.24s:  The type and the signals that you see that are confirming things
5515.96s:  If we're expecting a big move we might favor buying to start
5520.12s:  If we expect a smaller move we might favor selling in a higher probability trade
5528.20s:  Then we need to look at the risk profile
5533.32s:  This includes a lost target
5536.12s:  Probability of hitting your lost target
5541.48s:  Your risk at your lost target
5545.40s:  For
5550.20s:  Profit target
5552.76s:  Profit
5556.52s:  At your profit target
5559.40s:  Probability
5562.20s:  At your profit target
5565.56s:  And then your return
5568.04s:  At your profit target
5570.20s:  5
5572.20s:  Is an expected return calculation based on those inputs
5579.08s:  6 decision
5584.52s:  If you have a portfolio need
5587.24s:  If you need long theta short theta
5591.48s:  That's naturally going to back you into buyer cell
5595.32s:  If you have something here
5597.48s:  This is going to tilt you one direction or the other
5602.52s:  Towards buyer cell
5605.32s:  If you have a specific risk profile requirement
5608.04s:  I showed you ways that you can create different risk profiles
5614.20s:  That may or may not suit your needs
5616.92s:  There's going to be an impact on the profit target
5620.52s:  But it's important here to start with the risk profile
5624.84s:  So if you have a specific risk profile
5626.76s:  Because here's the other scenario that we didn't discuss here
5629.88s:  That you have to pay attention to
5632.12s:  We're talking about something like MSTR
5634.76s:  I told you it's very volatile
5637.00s:  What is a reality about MSTR
5640.52s:  We set a target of 392
5646.04s:  As an exit
5647.24s:  What's a very real reality in something like MSTR
5651.16s:  Think of it in the lens of a risk profile
5655.48s:  What do we think
5658.76s:  What would matter to us gaps below a motherfucking gap
5667.88s:  So if you're analyzing this and you don't consider the fact that even though we're setting a lost target
5674.52s:  That can end up being gapped over is a problem
5678.44s:  That has to be part of your consideration
5681.16s:  And then if one of these two strategies if you get a gap
5686.68s:  If one of these two strategies has a material difference in terms of risk
5689.88s:  It's naturally going to select for you
5695.72s:  So it can tilt
5698.44s:  Or select
5701.48s:  For you
5702.28s:  This one can select for you
5703.96s:  This one leads to a tilt
5706.28s:  This one leads to a tilt
5714.28s:  This one's a requirement
5718.28s:  That leads to a tilt
5722.52s:  So at the end of this
5724.36s:  You might say don't really care here
5727.08s:  This one kind of tilted me towards buying
5729.16s:  If I buy options I have a defined risk on something that might move
5734.68s:  I might lose more than I then I want to lose
5737.00s:  But I can still control it within reason
5739.80s:  For the profit target I think something's going to move a lot
5743.16s:  I prefer this
5744.92s:  They're both positively expected but the buy
5748.84s:  Had a greater ER
5752.52s:  So that leads me to this
5754.04s:  So as I run through this whole thing
5757.00s:  It naturally backs me into a buy
5761.40s:  So I've not really made a decision until the end
5764.52s:  I've just gone through a series of circumstances
5767.88s:  That then naturally backs me into the decision
5772.04s:  So this is the exact process you can use to determine if you want to buy
5776.52s:  Or sell options
5778.28s:  Again, this isn't specific
5780.36s:  To Tommy's scenario for a directional trade necessarily
5783.88s:  This is something that you can employ
5786.92s:  Regardless of what you're looking to
5789.64s:  Any last minute questions on this or anything else that you want to hit before we wrap up
5796.92s:  My dinner's not going to be here for a little bit
5798.28s:  But I got to take care of a little bit of work
5801.24s:  But I'm happy to to cover anything else that you guys want to hit before I do that
5811.24s:  I'm hopeful that the process in general
5813.64s:  Makes sense that you guys are comfortable with it
5816.20s:  And that you have a few ways to go about
5819.56s:  Making the decision there's no reason for it to be random
5825.40s:  Tommy says mind blown yeah, see this is one of those funny things because for me that seems like the only logical way to
5831.64s:  Sci stuff and to decide choices like that so it's actually
5838.12s:  It's become so natural to me
5841.72s:  where
5843.24s:  It's strange that people would make the decision in some other way
5848.44s:  Yeah
5849.56s:  Tommy says can you run through the ear calculation again on a different position
5853.08s:  Yeah, I have a video on that for you that you can check out but all it is is the
5859.88s:  probability of
5863.96s:  A win
5865.32s:  Times the win size less or divided by the probability of a loss times a loss size
5872.76s:  So all we're doing is we're trying to create a probabilistic weighted
5877.56s:  assessment of
5880.36s:  The output right so we want to not just think about
5884.76s:  Again, and this is why something like people use
5890.28s:  Let's say for example
5892.52s:  People say things like keep your keep your wins two times the size of
5899.32s:  Your losers
5901.32s:  Well that may or may not make sense because we have to adjust it based on probability it has to happen
5907.48s:  So a dark mark says do you know of CEO of Liberty Energy
5911.32s:  He's also a board member on okay alone. We'll have to unload company shares if it becomes head of DOE
5917.08s:  That's a fucking great question. I don't know. Let's see if the internet knows
5924.28s:  Because government officials I think
5927.32s:  I
5930.12s:  My guess is that they we just have to disclose it
5935.80s:  does the
5938.84s:  Head of department of energy have to
5947.40s:  Unwind shares of a company they hold
5954.92s:  And that's publicly traded
5958.84s:  It's a good question. I genuinely don't know let's see if we can learn
5967.48s:  Let's see
5969.88s:  Based on the information the head of DOE like other federal plays is subject to conflict of interest rule and may need to divest or rescue themselves from certain matters
5979.48s:  A
5981.48s:  federal conflict
5983.48s:  interest laws prohibit government employees from participating in matters that could affect their financial personal financial interests
5991.96s:  This includes stocks and other financial holdings and companies related to their agency. So it looks like they're gonna have to divest
6000.04s:  In the case of Jennifer Grandholm the current secretary of energy. There have been instances where she had to address potential conflicts of interests
6008.68s:  um
6009.80s:  Grandholm faced scrutiny over millions of dollars worth of proterra
6014.52s:  She committed to liquidating these holds as soon as practical
6018.36s:  But not later than 180 days
6020.92s:  She also sold up to $240,000 in stocks from various companies. So it looks like they get pressured
6026.12s:  Into unwinding. So it looks like it's likely to be unwound
6029.24s:  crypto. Thank you so much for the 50 bucks
6032.36s:  You know I appreciate it and you know that the door dash driver appreciates it
6036.20s:  That one's not gonna go all towards a door dash driver because I get to pay
6039.88s:  um the thumbnail dude some arrears
6043.72s:  So that will also go towards the channel specifically taking care of the thumbnail dude
6049.16s:  So thank you very much
6051.80s:  A dark mark says your thought on the effect of this companies. Uh, I don't know how much he holds how much is it
6061.16s:  Sim says no one only has to disclose. I don't again. I don't think that's true right based on
6066.12s:  Based on the scenario that we're looking at Jennifer a grand home
6069.56s:  I think the thing that we have to
6072.04s:  Address here is what's compulsory and then kind of what's underlying compulsory right so what this is saying is that there's no compulsory
6083.08s:  Forcing function right it doesn't say that like they they are going to be removed from the position
6088.28s:  But my guess is there are underlying soft compulsory things because obviously somebody like Jennifer Grandholm
6095.56s:  She clearly didn't want to unwind her positions, but she was made to my guess is if they want to maintain the position
6101.64s:  Without being forcibly removed by somebody
6105.08s:  They probably have to dance and play the game
6109.08s:  So yeah, I would just be really really
6112.36s:  Clear that in a practical sense
6115.00s:  It's absolutely compulsory based on what we're reading here in a functional sense like reading what it looks like
6122.04s:  It's it's not law that they have to
6125.96s:  Um
6132.04s:  But yeah, do we know you said the dude's name is Chris right? Let's see
6136.52s:  um, how much of what's the company that he holds liberty energy how much of liberty energy does Chris right hold
6149.64s:  And then I'm hearing a little bit of scratchy scratchin at the door you know what that means
6155.72s:  You
6172.28s:  So this is a I think a post dinner
6175.80s:  Nug he looks he looks fed
6178.20s:  He looks content as you could tell you can't really see his eyes
6182.60s:  The he has like the the black on black
6185.96s:  Unless you look at his chest his chest has a lot of white
6189.08s:  But he's on the the black on black some of his feet also have a little bit of white
6195.96s:  Something like that. So he's here ready to do a little bit of homework as you could tell
6201.64s:  He's uh settled in
6203.80s:  He's gonna go hang out with the in laws
6213.88s:  So let's take a look
6218.12s:  There's no specific information about how much he holds it seems like he that would be very public
6223.96s:  I don't know why that wouldn't be public
6226.04s:  To obtain accurate information about his stake in energy. They we need to consult the companies lead us to see fileings
6231.24s:  Okay, so find us to see fileings
6234.12s:  Find the SEC fileings for me to check the fuck the fuck do you think this is
6246.04s:  Dr. Zays says he looks ready for bed. That's actually the it's a complete decoy
6250.76s:  Because we go for a walk after dinner and he's he comes in here literally to try to pressure me
6257.32s:  I haven't had dinner yet. I'm gonna eat in a minute
6259.72s:  um
6260.76s:  But yeah during the walk he is a absolute crackhead
6268.52s:  Yeah, so here we go. This looks like he found it
6272.04s:  Um, however I can guide you to find visit SEC search for liberty
6276.28s:  Look for form four for more comprehensive view of insider transactions
6279.88s:  Review multiple form four filings over the year to corroborate the reported
6284.36s:  438,000 shares held by Christopher Wright literally tells me right there
6287.32s:  I don't know why I couldn't have told me that
6289.32s:  So it looks like he has 438,000 shares
6293.40s:  What's the
6300.76s:  What's that is the flow
6304.12s:  I guess I could just ask this what is
6308.84s:  438 of the total
6313.48s:  float
6320.12s:  Uh
6326.36s:  0.27
6328.68s:  That right that seems like completely trivial
6335.48s:  That'll be your team
6343.56s:  This is reporting 158 million. This is 163. Yeah, so
6348.52s:  Um
6350.92s:  And then what's the volume? No, I mean it'll definitely move the flow
6357.08s:  Or it'll definitely move the price, but I mean, I don't think it's gonna move it much
6362.76s:  Tim says that will not move the market. I think it will. I just don't think it will much
6367.48s:  The reason I think it will is I'm just looking at that the average daily volume right so we see
6372.68s:  3 million 1 million 2 million if we go back further
6375.56s:  It's as low as 896,000 so 900,000
6379.88s:  So with that low of a daily volume
6383.72s:  It's again, I think the impact to the broader point wouldn't be like severe or long-term felt
6389.32s:  But I definitely think in the course of a day or however what the divestiture period would be
6394.28s:  That with the persistent unwine it probably would be felt a little bit
6398.36s:  I think so
6401.32s:  So yeah
6405.08s:  Sim says they will not sell it all in one day
6406.92s:  They won't but they're gonna try to sell it quickly because one of the problems that they're gonna face is
6413.24s:  if they
6414.44s:  Like if the market knows that an entity is starting to sell and they can pick it up
6418.52s:  Which again with volume is lighter this is light as this you typically can
6423.72s:  It'll be
6424.92s:  People trying to bid it up, right and just
6427.72s:  Get them fucked for better prices
6430.36s:  So yeah, I think I think there's a good possibility
6435.80s:  Cool
6439.40s:  All right gang well, I think that's all I got so
6443.16s:  We'll we'll keep on with the beginner sessions on Friday
6447.88s:  Quick update. I don't know about live streams essentially for the next week
6452.04s:  I'm planning on doing the GME live stream tomorrow, but it is TBD just because we're we're doing a little bit of traveling so
6460.12s:  So we'll see I'll keep you guys up to date with with it as it gets closer
6464.92s:  So if as you guys know if you need anything hit me up in the discord for those that are in the
6470.12s:  The mentoring program
