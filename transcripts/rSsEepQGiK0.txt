0.00s: What's up outliers? What is all this drama about Tesla, Mark, Rover, and then laser? Well,
7.62s: we're going to take a quick look at it today. I want to spend a little more time actually
11.08s: focusing primarily on the technology. The different conjecture around what's going on with this.
18.60s: We'll talk a little bit about that. But I think the bigger picture here is actually a discussion
23.20s: about the technology. So let's see what this is.
27.24s: I don't have high hopes here. But with the kid logistical after the Tesla test. Oh, oh,
32.76s: oh, fuck. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
37.90s: So here's what's going on in this video as far as I can tell. A lot of people are saying
45.16s: that Mark, Rover, you know, purposely did this to try to crash Tesla or to try to make laser,
51.06s: which is a primary producer of LiDAR. Go off the charts. And there's a lot to the story
56.66s: and I'm not going to pretend to be completely read in on it all. But there's a couple things
62.44s: to note right out of the gate. The majority of this video is actually about LiDAR technology.
68.26s: He actually spends the first half discussing the technology, how cool it is, the kind of
73.16s: things that he can do, taking it to Disneyland and using it to map some of the different
80.44s: rides. So a lot of it is literally just about the technology. Then the second part of it
86.00s: is obviously just designed to get clicks, right? That's why we brought Tesla into this.
91.88s: That's why we said something. Can you fool a self driving car? And that's also why we
95.84s: framed it as can you fool because if you take a look at the tests that they did, right?
101.44s: There's a couple of six different scenarios. The scenarios that they picked were like
105.60s: really extreme. They were things that I don't think really represent what you expect
111.72s: to see in an average day driving. And nor is it designed to be like, I view this as a test.
119.60s: So we're purposely picking things that represent extremes. Now that being said, I do find some
126.32s: of the criticisms to be probably worthwhile because this does make Tesla to the lay viewer
134.32s: look a little bit worse. And I also think it's a little strange. The criticism that he wasn't
140.40s: using the full autonomous driving capability and is simply using the assisted driving, which
146.16s: is a slightly different set of skills. I actually watched a video where he had a conversation
151.12s: with somebody about that. And he effectively said, I didn't think there was a big difference
155.16s: in the technology, which he generally does like really robust scientific experiment. So
161.12s: it surprises me that he wouldn't make the assumption of, well, let me just try it with
166.08s: full self driving and then assisted driving and see if there's a difference between those,
170.08s: right? Like, if I were testing it, that's the angle I would take it. So I thought that was
174.24s: kind of interesting. But all that being said, after watching the video, at no point did I get
180.56s: the sensation that he's trying to crash Tesla or even, you know, moon, Lumenar. Now one of the
188.80s: things to note is this dude that's driving the car that has LiDAR technology, you can tell
196.24s: is obviously wrapping Lumenar. He's wrapping the set. So what does that tell us? Well, it tells us
202.88s: that Mark is absolutely promoting this company. Now one of the things I've seen thrown around is
209.60s: people conjecturing that he has long financial interest in Lumenar, short financial interest in
214.96s: Tesla or a combination thereof. I've not seen any conclusive evidence of either. So I reserve
220.48s: judgment until I know one way or the other. I think the speculation is fine. That's a natural
225.28s: thing to assume that could be happening. But regardless if he has a financial stake in any of
231.12s: this aside, he still clearly is promoting this company, right? That's why this person again is
238.16s: wearing the company T-shirt and talking about not just the technology because LiDAR is made by
243.52s: a bunch of different companies. So that is clear here. All of that stuff aside is interesting to see
250.08s: how quick people kind of assume the worst about folks and take it to a really ugly place.
255.68s: I generally like Mark Rober. I think the work he does is pretty cool. I do have some questions
260.80s: about the broader efficacy and the tests that he did. I would give him the benefit of the
267.68s: doubt in the sense that I don't think he purposely would try to run really bad tests because again,
275.04s: you get called out for it and he's smart enough to know that. So that stuff aside, we actually
282.16s: spent a while taking a look at the difference between LiDAR technology and different kinds of
289.12s: self-driving technology suites and actually found some cool things. Let's take a look.
293.68s: This is from our friendly AI assistant, also known as ChatGPT. I essentially asked it to compare
299.60s: the current primary technology being used in autonomous driving vehicles, different companies that
304.24s: are using different kinds and to essentially compare and contrast. We can see that one of the big
310.08s: differences, which by the way, Tesla dominantly is using cameras and places like Waymo, Mercedes,
316.32s: Aurora, they're using LiDAR. One of the things to note is Mercedes is a premium vehicle class and
322.88s: what they tend to produce is more expensive. Now, I want to be clear, this is not me promoting any
328.16s: of these companies in any way. I actually currently don't have a position in anything here.
332.24s: But I just want to talk about the technology. The technology here, I think, is really interesting
338.80s: because one of the curious changes that's happening is rather than relying on one technology dominant
348.16s: and Tesla's initial imperative, obviously, was to try to create something that was first of its
355.68s: cost available to a lot of people and mass-producible. Whereas, if you take a look at the picture of
362.64s: something like Mercedes, which is definitely a much higher end vehicle, more on the premium side of
367.76s: things. So what companies are doing now, though, that I actually find to be very smart, but also
374.80s: interesting is a lot of them are running a blend of different technologies. So you can see that
380.96s: they're using LiDAR for certain use cases, radar for certain use cases in cameras.
385.68s: And what you can do is create a really robust capability suite, but managed cost.
391.84s: Now, a really interesting inclusion here is the AI technology that Tesla is looking to integrate.
399.04s: And that might even change the landscape even further. Now, I think if we think about the longer
407.12s: future of self-driving vehicles, and we go back to this video, like the near-term effect is one
415.12s: thing in terms of the stock prices, which I do think that there is some effect that we can observe.
419.84s: But the longer-term effect, even of a partial study or a study that's really done in very clear
425.76s: extremes, is also kind of helpful for the broader landscape. And it's even helpful for Tesla,
432.32s: because they can see things like this and use it to optimize their company and their technology
438.72s: if they're so inclined. But this is what I mean by extremes. Take a look at this. This is essentially
447.12s: seeing if you would stop the car, would stop, detect this small person, and then it's obviously
455.44s: like a mannequin. And if it would stop before striking them, and just take a look, they're using
460.96s: water trucks to directly dump the water, cross-directionally onto the thing. So this is what I mean by
469.76s: the tests that were done were done in like really extreme scenarios that I genuinely don't believe
475.04s: represent day-to-day driving. So this even as an assessment of the capability of the technology
481.28s: and a full-self-driving suite is completely different. Moreover than that, there's a difference
486.72s: between crash detection and prevention in full driving. Full driving includes things like
495.12s: changing lanes by monitoring your speed, adjusting your speed based on what it can see and things
499.84s: like that. The information received to make those decisions obviously is super important. But
505.84s: it's not like this car right here, even though it might have crash detection capabilities
511.44s: upgraded to it, so that it can see this and stop. It's not a full-self driving car,
516.72s: right? There are different things. So the conjecture around, did Mark Rober do this for some sort
523.52s: of financial gain or whatever? Honestly, don't know. And it doesn't matter to me that much because I
528.24s: can also look at a study like a rational person and understand the context that it's being done in.
533.52s: That being said, the market as always never ceases to amaze. So if we take a look at the
539.36s: difference here between Tesla and laser, Tesla's been getting crushed. And Tesla's been getting
545.12s: crushed for some time now. This absolutely will not help. And then if we take a look at laser, laser
551.28s: got a massive bump. You can see the 14th here. If we take a look at when this video came out,
557.92s: it was on the 15th. So here's the 14th, which is Friday. The 15th is over the weekend and then
566.24s: take a look at the 17th and then take a look at the 18th. Here's the most interesting part about
570.80s: this whole thing and the fact that I love options markets because they tell us a whole lot.
577.12s: If we take a look at the one-day premium flow specifically for the call side, not a whole lot
584.16s: to write home about, right? Kind of quiet. Nothing really sticking out at me. But as soon as we zoom
588.40s: this out, what do you notice? Pretty quiet for the last week. And then on the 17th, all of a sudden
598.80s: call premium skyrockets. This is people playing that news. They're playing that movement and then
605.44s: take a look at what happens today. People are dumping. This is people selling these calls into
610.80s: strength and realizing their profits to go trade another thing. It's a really funny and
616.16s: untrained idea. But the broader context here, I think, from the technology standpoint is it's
621.92s: pretty neat to see the different kinds of technology that exist and how they're being integrated
626.56s: into the automotive sphere. But it's also really fun to see the market impact on a smaller company
634.16s: like Laser and see how profound it absolutely can distort short-term price by shifting sentiment.
642.48s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you later.
