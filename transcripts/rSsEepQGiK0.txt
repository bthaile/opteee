0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up outliers? What is all this drama about Tesla, Mark, Rover, and then laser? Well,
7.62s:  we're going to take a quick look at it today. I want to spend a little more time actually
11.08s:  focusing primarily on the technology. The different conjecture around what's going on with this.
18.60s:  We'll talk a little bit about that. But I think the bigger picture here is actually a discussion
23.20s:  about the technology. So let's see what this is.
27.24s:  I don't have high hopes here. But with the kid logistics cool after the Tesla test.
31.96s:  Oh, oh, oh, fuck.
35.00s:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
37.88s:  So here's what's going on in this video as far as I can tell. A lot of people are saying
45.08s:  that Mark, Rover, you know, purposely did this to try to crash Tesla or to try to make laser,
51.04s:  which is a primary producer of LiDAR. Go off the charts and there's a lot to this story
56.64s:  and I'm not going to pretend to be completely read in on it all. But there's a couple of
62.24s:  things to note right out of the gate. The majority of this video is actually about LiDAR
67.60s:  technology. He actually spends the first half discussing the technology, how cool it is,
72.84s:  the kind of things that he can do, taking it to Disneyland and using it to map some of
80.04s:  the different rides. So a lot of it is literally just about the technology. Then the second
85.48s:  part of it is obviously just designed to get clicks, right? That's why we brought Tesla
91.16s:  into this. That's why we said something, can you fool a self driving car? And that's
95.40s:  also why we framed it as can you fool? Because if you take a look at the tests that they
100.24s:  did, right? There's a couple of six different scenarios. The scenarios that they picked
104.92s:  were like really extreme. They were things that I don't think really represent what you
111.00s:  expect to see in an average day driving. And nor is it designed to be like I view this
117.72s:  as a test. So we're purposely picking things that represent extremes. Now that being said,
125.08s:  I do find some of the criticisms to be probably worthwhile because this does make Tesla to
132.96s:  the lay viewer look a little bit worse. And I also think it's a little strange the criticism
139.56s:  that he wasn't using the full autonomous driving capability and is simply using the assisted
145.68s:  driving, which is a slightly different set of skills. I actually watched a video where
150.20s:  he had a conversation with somebody about that. And he effectively said I didn't think
154.40s:  there was a big difference in the technology, which he generally does like really robust
159.12s:  scientific experiment. So it surprises me that he wouldn't make the assumption of well,
164.48s:  let me just try it with full self driving and then assisted driving and see if there's
169.04s:  a difference between those right? Like if I were testing it, that's the angle I would
172.60s:  take it.
173.60s:  So I thought that was kind of interesting. But all that being said, after watching the
178.00s:  video, at no point did I get the sensation that he's trying to crash Tesla or even you
185.68s:  know, moon, Lumen are now one of the things to note is this dude that's driving the car
192.68s:  that has lied our technology. You can tell is obviously wrapping Lumen are he's wrapping
199.04s:  the set. So what does that tell us? Well, it tells us that Mark is absolutely promoting
206.28s:  this company. Now, one of the things I've seen thrown around is people conjecturing that
210.88s:  he has long financial interest in Lumen are short financial interest in Tesla or a combination
216.20s:  thereof. I've not seen any conclusive evidence of either. So I reserve judgment until I know
222.16s:  one way or the other. I think the speculation is fine. That's a natural thing to assume
226.56s:  that could be happening. But regardless if he has a financial stake in any of this aside,
233.48s:  he still clearly is promoting this company, right? That's why this person again is wearing
238.60s:  the company t-shirt and talking about not just the technology because LIDAR is made by
243.64s:  a bunch of different companies. So that is clear here. All that stuff aside is interesting
249.48s:  to see how quick people kind of assume the worst about folks and take it to a really ugly
254.72s:  place. I generally like Mark Rober. I think the work he does is pretty cool. I do have some
260.32s:  questions about the broader efficacy and the tests that he did. I would give him the benefit
267.56s:  of the doubt in the sense that I don't think he purposely would try to run really bad tests
274.16s:  because again, you get called out for it and he's smart enough to know that. So that stuff
280.56s:  aside, we actually spent a while taking a look at the difference between LIDAR technology
287.56s:  and different kinds of self-driving technology suites and actually found some cool things.
292.56s:  So let's take a look. This is from our friendly AI assistant also known as chat GPT. And I
297.76s:  essentially asked it to compare the current primary technology being used in autonomous
302.48s:  driving vehicles, different companies that are using different kinds and to essentially
307.12s:  compare and contrast. And we can see that one of the big differences, which by the way, Tesla
312.20s:  dominantly is using cameras and places like Waymo, Mercedes, Aurora, they're using LIDAR.
319.04s:  And one of the things to note is Mercedes is a premium vehicle class and what they tend
323.64s:  to produce is more expensive. Now I want to be clear, this is not me promoting any of these
328.48s:  companies in any way. I actually currently don't have a position in anything here. But I just
333.44s:  want to talk about the technology and the technology here, I think is really interesting because
339.44s:  one of the curious changes that's happening is rather than relying on one technology dominant
348.16s:  and Tesla's initial imperative obviously was to try to create something that was first of
354.80s:  its kind, cost available to a lot of people and mass-producible. Whereas if you take a look at
361.52s:  the picture of something like Mercedes, which is definitely a much higher end vehicle, more on
366.88s:  the premium side of things. So what companies are doing now though that I actually find to be
373.12s:  very smart, but also interesting is a lot of them are running a blend of different technologies.
380.08s:  So you can see that they're using LIDAR for certain use cases, radar for certain use cases,
384.56s:  in cameras. And what you can do is create a really robust capability suite, but manage cost.
391.84s:  Now a really interesting inclusion here is the AI technology that Tesla is looking to integrate.
399.12s:  And that might even change the landscape even further. Now I think if we think about the longer
406.08s:  term future of self-driving vehicles and we go back to this video, like the near term
414.32s:  effect is one thing in terms of the stock prices, which I do think that there is some effect that
418.72s:  we can observe. But the longer term effect even of a partial study or a study that's really done
424.72s:  in very clear extremes is also kind of helpful for the broader landscape. And it's even helpful for
431.84s:  Tesla because they can see things like this and use it to optimize their company and their
438.24s:  technology if they're so inclined. But this is what I mean by extremes. Take a look at this.
445.84s:  This is essentially seeing if you would stop the car, would stop detect this small person,
454.24s:  and then it's obviously a mannequin. And if it would stop before striking them.
458.72s:  And just take a look, they're using water trucks to directly dump the water
465.28s:  frost directionally onto the thing. So this is what I mean by the tests that were done were done
471.28s:  in like really extreme scenarios that I genuinely don't believe represent day-to-day driving.
476.96s:  So this even as an assessment of the capability of the technology and of full self-driving
482.32s:  suite is completely different. Moreover than that, there's a difference between
487.68s:  crash detection and prevention in full driving. Full driving includes things like changing lanes
496.08s:  by monitoring your speed adjusting your speed based on what it can see and things like that.
500.80s:  The information received to make those decisions obviously is super important. But it's not like
507.20s:  this car right here even though it might have crash detection capabilities upgraded to it
512.56s:  so that it can see this and stop. It's not a full self-driving car right through different things.
518.32s:  So the conjecture around, you know, did Mark Rober do this for some sort of financial gain or whatever
524.96s:  honestly don't know. And it doesn't matter to me that much because I can also look at a study
529.92s:  like a rational person and understand the context that it's being done in. That being said,
534.48s:  the market as always never ceases to amaze. So if we take a look at the difference here between
540.24s:  Tesla and laser. Tesla has been getting crushed and Tesla has been getting crushed for some time now.
546.64s:  This absolutely will not help. And then if we take a look at laser, laser got a massive bump.
553.28s:  You can see the 14th here. If we take a look at when this video came out, it was on the 15th.
560.40s:  So here's the 14th, which is Friday. The 15th is over the weekend and then take a look at the 17th
567.36s:  and then take a look at the 18th. Here's the most interesting part about this whole thing.
572.00s:  And the fact that I love options markets because they tell us a whole lot. If we take a look
579.20s:  at the one day premium flow specifically for the call side, not a whole lot to write home about,
585.12s:  right? Kind of quiet. Nothing really sticking out at me. But as soon as we zoom this out, what do you
589.44s:  notice? Pretty quiet for the last week. And then on the 17th, all of a sudden call premium
600.24s:  skyrockets. This is people playing that news. They're playing that movement and then take a look at
605.92s:  what happens today. People are dumping. This is people selling these calls into strength and
611.68s:  realizing their profits to go trade another thing. It's a really funny and untrained idea.
617.68s:  But the broader context here, I think, from the technology standpoint is it's pretty neat to see
622.88s:  the different kinds of technology that exist and how they're being integrated into the automotive
628.24s:  sphere. But it's also really fun to see the market impact on a smaller company like laser
635.20s:  and see how profound it absolutely can distort short-term price by shifting sentiment.
642.48s:  As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlet. See you later.
