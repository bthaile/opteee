0.00s: I got a DM asking what happened to the implied volatility today in GameStop after the shareholder
6.68s: meeting and you know if it's about some options, I'm here for it.
10.00s: So exactly what we're going to talk about today because interestingly enough, that volatility
14.32s: didn't bleed out as much as I expected, which makes me believe there might be something
18.12s: else that the market is looking at, which we'll take a look at.
21.44s: While I was at it, a couple of the updates that I saw were in Kitty dropping his standard
25.44s: cryptic messages with no captions at all, you guys are really, really good at interpreting
30.60s: what these mean.
31.60s: I am not.
32.60s: I don't know all the details yet.
34.04s: I did look up both of these quickly and this dude was complaining about the repping at
38.52s: some tennis matches and then this guy apparently is from a Disney movie that he can see the
42.56s: future and people are really reading into this green reflection, although he looks
47.28s: super sad to me.
48.28s: So I don't know what to make of either of those.
50.00s: You guys will have to tell me.
51.92s: But let's talk about this real quick too.
54.00s: This is from Ryan Cohen after the shareholders meeting and it seemed interesting because
58.72s: on Twitter, it seemed like a lot of people were expecting this big rallying cry from Cohen.
64.60s: And to me, at least this is a very standard shareholder's meeting update where they're
70.08s: just talking about broad brush strokes.
72.00s: They're not getting super far into detail.
73.92s: This is kind of standard fair.
75.68s: It seems like you guys were expecting something else at least to some degree.
79.00s: Again, I don't know the history.
80.72s: I don't know if he promised a specific roadmap with specific action items and things like
84.80s: that.
85.80s: If so, that would be a big miss.
87.04s: But I didn't see anything like that.
88.60s: This looks like standard fair.
89.72s: I just bring that up for context because I don't like seeing newer traders kind of getting
94.60s: their expectations super accelerated compared to where we may or may not be and then disappointed
100.28s: on the back end.
101.28s: It just doesn't really help anything.
102.28s: At least from the trader's perspective, which is what I care about the most.
105.48s: I care about you guys and your ability to trade effectively.
108.88s: All right.
109.96s: Let's get into now actually what I do know about, which is this some options.
116.04s: So if we take a look at GameStop, this is today, the 17th of June.
119.32s: This was yesterday, the 16th of the June over the weekend.
122.76s: And there was a big drop in implied volatility yesterday.
126.32s: It was hovering 280, cracked over 280 for a little bit.
130.08s: And then today, after the meeting, after the close, this is now down to 204%.
134.56s: So 76 points.
135.56s: It's a big drop, especially over the course of a day.
139.80s: As big as I thought in terms of the anticipation around this event, the fact that this is still
146.60s: over 200% with now four days left to go is actually quite interesting to me.
153.28s: So if we take a look at the market right now, it's 204 51.
159.48s: And right now, I would have expected this to be down quite a bit more.
164.72s: I also noticed that the expiration for next cycle, 28th of June is also still pretty elevated.
169.88s: 180% compared to everything else, which is in the 160s, 150s.
175.80s: That's a big difference.
177.44s: So to a degree, the market is still pricing in a larger price band.
181.40s: Now, another question I got from somebody is, is I've all good or bad?
186.80s: It's not inherently either.
188.76s: The reason for that is this is agnostic.
191.16s: This isn't saying it's going to go up a lot or down a lot.
194.40s: It's saying it could do either and we don't really know.
197.96s: So this is kind of projecting a cone of price movement.
201.84s: So that's why this says plus or minus.
203.92s: And actually, this number doesn't look correct to me.
205.68s: I think it's slightly higher than that now.
207.72s: But specifically the $4.36, I think it's higher than that.
213.08s: We can do the math on it in a second.
215.32s: But this essentially means that the market is expecting a fairly large move in a relatively short period
221.52s: for a relatively cheap product, right?
224.04s: It's 25 bucks.
225.44s: So to see these kinds of moves over the course of four days, that's still pretty significant volatility.
230.68s: Now from a chart perspective, which I think in this case doesn't really apply that much to game stop really
235.44s: because of the way that it operates.
237.68s: But it does look like it's kind of holding this 24 and a half handle pretty well.
242.12s: That's the main thing I see at least from a support perspective.
246.04s: But again, I really would be very hesitant to apply my typical technical analysis approach
251.28s: to something like game stop.
252.24s: It clearly breaks the rules all the time.
254.68s: It's a completely different product.
255.96s: That's what makes it kind of the special thing that it is.
259.56s: A couple of the things that though that I want to show you in the options chain, the first thing.
264.24s: If you remember yesterday, when we were looking at this exact thing down at the bottom,
268.32s: I'll slide out of the way so you can see.
270.72s: This has changed massively.
273.36s: So yesterday, we saw the put side of this front expiration, the IV severely depressed.
281.36s: That typically leads to a upward price sensitivity, meaning we're pricing in more vols to the upside.
288.00s: This is now turned into almost a standard volatility smile.
292.00s: Slight calls skew still in terms of the vols, but not massive.
296.32s: This is way more normal.
298.08s: So if you compare this to the video I did yesterday, you'll see a huge difference between these.
303.08s: And this is exactly how vol adjusts based on current market conditions.
307.44s: Now, if you look at the following expiration, 28 June, we see something different again.
314.32s: We see that same kind of call skew that we saw yesterday.
320.00s: So this is again, the market very clearly pricing in more vols to the upside, pricing in more
326.56s: upside. So you can't take away too much from that right out of the jump, but that just tells me
332.32s: how they're pricing options via the volatility.
335.84s: Now, if we take a look at the overall volumes for today, very interesting day.
341.84s: And it's because if you look at the calls versus puts, a lot of calls traded compared to the puts
346.24s: that typically means, oh, wow, people are expecting upside.
350.08s: That's what you would assume if they're buying calls.
353.36s: I don't actually think that's the most of what's going on here.
356.72s: And I'll tell you why.
358.48s: If you take a look at the traded at the bid or below, traded at the ask or above,
364.40s: if you're buying things and you're trying to get your trade on, it's going to be at or above
369.92s: the offer, the ask. This is if you're buying options in this scenario.
374.56s: And if you're selling options and you're trying to get your sold options out there and on,
379.12s: it would be at the bid or below.
382.72s: So what I see here and then just to kind of finish this part out between the market is if
387.84s: you're playing the midpoint. And in this case, you can't tell if you're trying to open a contract,
391.92s: close a contract, sell to open buy to open, you can't tell anything in here.
396.24s: So this for kind of this purpose, you typically would just get rid of this line because you can't
400.96s: tell anything from it essentially. Now, what I can see is from the calls that traded today, 36%
408.08s: of them were done at the bid or below. That tells me those are likely sales, meaning people selling
413.60s: calls, meaning we are expecting the market to go down or want the market to go down.
418.24s: This can be done against covered calls scenario where you have the shares and sell calls against
423.84s: your shares. That is one of my guesses on what could be going on here. Now, the other thing I see
430.16s: is on the put side, it's the inverse. So if you're buying puts, you would want the market to go down.
437.04s: And if you're buying them and you want to get your puts on, it would be at the offer, the ask or
441.68s: above, 39% of them took place there as compared to 26% at the bid. So this tells me there's a smaller
450.00s: subset of people who are selling puts, which is bullish and more people that are buying puts,
454.72s: which is bearish wanting something to go down. Again, this could be buying protective puts against
459.68s: long shares. You don't know. But what I do know is from a pure speculative standpoint, there's more
465.68s: downside transactions occurring between the calls and the puts here. Now, the last thing I want to
470.32s: look at real quick is the expiration this week and next week because there's massive volume.
477.76s: So again, quick recap, open interest are contracts that are open and outstanding. And volume are just
485.36s: the number of trades on that contract today. We can't tell if these are opening trades or closing
491.04s: trades, but we can make some inferences. So for example, on these 26 calls, there is 5400
497.76s: OI, 20,000 volume today, even if we close all of these OI out, that still means 15,000 of these
507.84s: were buys. So there's a lot of people buying out of the money calls that essentially expire in
513.68s: a few days, same thing at this 30 handle. There's no doubt buying volume here because again, if you sell
520.64s: all of these against the existing OI, which is 67,000, there's still a net positive figure here. That
526.08s: means that there's still additional buys happening. And again, it looks like it's more than that.
531.44s: So the market still is looking at some upside here. It's hard to tell exactly to what degree, though.
536.48s: We really don't know. Now, the other thing that you can read in between the lines ever so slightly
541.84s: is if you look at the closing price, 25, 22. And if you look at kind of the first out of the money
548.56s: put, which is 25, and then the first out of the money call, which is 2550, which one of those
554.72s: is closer, are we closer to 25 or 255? We're technically closer to 25. Yet it has a lower delta.
565.12s: That's informative. That means that the market is at the very least pricing in a slight favorable
570.56s: up move to the 255, which is again, slightly further away than these puts. And that to me is
578.32s: slight buying pressure, at least in terms of the way that these are being priced.
581.76s: Options are fascinating. There's all these little things you can take a look at to kind of make
586.56s: inferences, but it's really important. You can't look at any one of them and think, okay, this is
591.76s: what's going to happen. The vast majority of the time you kind of have to piece it all together and
595.12s: see what you see. And in this case, it's really mixed back. It looks like the vast majority of
600.64s: options volume that we're seeing today is sell pressure. It looks like from an implied volatility
606.88s: perspective, we're approximating to more of a smile for the close expiration, meaning this very
612.40s: front expiration and then the very next expiration, which is next Friday. It has that more kind of
618.24s: call skew focus that we've seen previously for this expiration. Now, let's take a look at the 28
623.76s: June super fast, see if anything sticks out. And it still looks like some pretty big call OI.
631.44s: This is across a lot of these different
636.16s: delta's, which is interesting because if we look at the overall call transactions on this side,
641.04s: compared to this side, it's still pretty massive. So one of the other things we can do real quick
645.92s: out of curiosity is we can take a look at the volume for today. We can look at this kind of near
650.40s: term series. Let's take a look at calls and puts. And so this is just looking at the front two
656.88s: expirations and a lot of this volume for both of them, actually the majority of the volume that
664.48s: we're seeing across all contracts were in these front two, which again is interesting to me.
671.04s: And there is a lot of volume here at the 30s, which I think we saw
678.64s: which was this block here. So not dead, meaning there's still a lot of people playing in these
685.36s: really short term expirations, which is very interesting to me. If you're interested from a
689.76s: retail trade and perspective, why that can be really, really dangerous, check out the last video I
694.00s: did. I'll throw it in the notes below because I think that's super important for new traders to
698.40s: be aware of that buying far out of the money options seems really attractive, but it's not as
703.84s: attractive as you might think it is. And you should just be aware whether you still want to trade
709.28s: them or not. That's obviously totally up to you. You seemingly are grown people as you should be
714.16s: slaying in trades however you feel like it, but it should be at least informed. We should know
717.52s: the trade off. So that's the goal of that video. As always, anything you want me to take a look at,
721.60s: just send it to me. I love looking over this stuff as you can tell. I'll see you guys later.
