2.84s: 29.8 so close so today's video is a
6.12s: quick update on GameStop because we are
9.04s: coming into earnings soon and we are
11.52s: literally consolidating like this is a
13.80s: normal consolidation the ADR is a little
17.00s: bit wide with some of these candles
19.08s: being so broad but look at the volume
22.64s: and look at the price level this is
24.56s: about as exciting as I think it gets for
27.08s: GameStop as a company in general now I
29.64s: spe ify as a company in general because
32.48s: this doesn't necessarily strike me as
36.44s: parabolic short squeeze gamma squeeze up
40.08s: again it can always happen we don't know
42.52s: when the conditions are set for that to
44.44s: occur but what I'm highlighting is from
46.40s: an underlying company perspective this
49.56s: is a company that's actually gaining a
51.40s: little bit of attention and that's a
53.52s: good thing because if we look at the
55.80s: volume here it's been sustained from the
59.44s: aan November and the volume is high so
63.12s: it was 15 million here 26 million here
66.08s: 18 million here 18 and a half million
68.60s: here 16 and 1/2 here 16 and 1/2 here 8
71.92s: and 1/2 8.7
74.48s: 22 as of today the reason why that
78.32s: matters is because a lot of people are
81.20s: curious you know if roaring Kitty's
83.36s: involved and literally who knows that
85.72s: that dude is like Batman he just
87.28s: kind of shows up when it's time for him
88.72s: to show up could be but the cool part
91.08s: about this is that even if roaring Kitty
93.76s: is part of this he's not all of it and
95.72s: that is even more powerful in my opinion
98.56s: for GameStop as a company to start
102.12s: garnering some attention and capital if
105.12s: we Zoom this out to a six-month time
107.56s: frame we've been basing Above This 25
111.52s: handle since November 11 we haven't seen
116.56s: this level since essentially we were
118.84s: around the squeeze period from the
121.64s: spring/ early summer so the fact that
124.88s: we're rallying up to this point and then
128.08s: remaining above this point is really
130.60s: cool for me to see look at all the
132.60s: moving averages they're starting to
134.04s: organize as I would prefer them too so
136.36s: we have short terms that are upward
138.36s: sloping we have midterm moving averages
140.56s: that are upward sloping Crossing above
142.32s: slightly longer term moving averages so
144.36s: there's a really great configuration
145.88s: that's going on here the other thing
147.64s: from an RSI perspective it still has
149.48s: momentum
150.60s: right so the RSI indicator line itself
153.76s: is hovering
155.76s: above the what is what do I have here a
158.00s: 7day moving average for the RSI and
162.20s: they're upward sloping they're not
164.08s: overextended right so we can see that
165.96s: they're still hovering below 70 so all
168.72s: in all this looks really strong to me
172.04s: now just because it looks strong doesn't
174.08s: mean that it's not going to consolidate
175.56s: come back down or consolidate shoot back
177.56s: up the main thing I'm trying to
179.24s: highlight as I look at this is the price
180.96s: action the fact that we're getting
182.76s: several days consecutively above the 25
185.72s: handle generally organized in a
188.00s: consolidation Zone slightly bigger
190.00s: candle slightly bigger volume is good
192.20s: that's all good in my opinion so when we
196.04s: take a look at implied volatility we do
198.16s: have still really high IV right this is
200.00s: showing 1
202.40s: 31.8% if we take a Peak at the options
205.28s: chain you can see that it's obviously
207.56s: looking at the next primary expiration
209.12s: that's 30 days way out here we can see
211.56s: that there's elevated volatility on the
213.76s: near term expirations we still see
215.92s: pretty strong call skew as uh it
218.80s: pertains to Oi relative to the puts with
221.56s: 683 th000 calls against 259,000 puts now
224.68s: one of the things we noed on the live
226.44s: stream last night as we were looking at
228.80s: this is a big change in the structure of
233.12s: the oi breakdown what I mean by that is
236.80s: if we take a look at a lot of these
239.20s: Green Box is that's actually 17 Gen 25
243.04s: these are 60-day options and there's a
247.20s: lot of them the cool part about that is
251.00s: that a lot of the activity that we're
252.60s: seeing here is funneled in near-term
255.80s: expirations that used to be the case now
259.12s: we're spread across expirations which
262.28s: leads to a slightly more robust options
266.20s: picture for it and it means that people
268.36s: aren't just trying to play super
270.16s: short-term pops these are people that
272.84s: are actually positioning for the upside
274.76s: of the company this also is bolstered by
277.88s: what we were just talking about in terms
279.20s: of the chart and how that looks now
281.48s: these are people that are starting to
282.92s: play the company itself more so to the
285.36s: upside as compared to just the violent
287.36s: moves up and down which still can occur
289.12s: and still can be played but again my
292.28s: perspective on GameStop is I want to see
294.88s: it do well as a company I want to see
297.24s: GameStop be one of those stories where
298.96s: people were essentially trying to short
301.20s: it into the dirt try to make it go
302.84s: bankrupt so that rich people could get a
304.88s: couple tax breaks on their gains and
308.28s: this entire story has been propped up
310.68s: first by the retail trading community
312.52s: that essentially didn't let it happen
314.56s: and if the company itself can then turn
317.36s: around and be something that's really
320.04s: profitable really effective as a company
321.80s: as a business to me that's a Cinderella
324.16s: story like that is really really cool
326.04s: that is a really interesting scenario
328.84s: where like the little guy stood up
330.56s: against the big guy outmaneuvered them
332.84s: and then through good leadership the
334.40s: company is starting to turn itself
336.00s: around so that's why I'm excited to look
337.60s: at it from that perspective and I
339.52s: understand that a lot of people really
340.64s: prefer to look at it from moaz trying to
342.92s: see this big giant squeeze which I still
345.08s: would love to see that myself but I
346.88s: really love the fact that it looks like
348.92s: the company itself is being respected
351.92s: and it's growing and it looks like it's
353.36s: doing well so we'll take a look at what
355.64s: the earnings expectations are coming up
357.32s: but take a look at the call volume today
358.72s: 348 th000 calls against only 52,000 puts
362.00s: and if you take a look at the breakdown
364.96s: most of them were Buys so these are
367.16s: people that are buying calls playing
369.80s: this probably to the upside we'll take a
371.44s: look at unusual whales in just a moment
373.80s: I want to take a look at the VA picture
375.72s: now as you know I like to do to get a a
377.64s: sense of the surface and as per usual
380.88s: I'm going to look at the primary
381.88s: Explorations just because it helps get
383.68s: rid of some of the noise uh let's do
386.56s: june and take a look we now have have
390.68s: call skew on all of them all of them
395.36s: that's also very interesting so the call
398.00s: IV for the out of-the money calls is
400.40s: priced High relative to the put IV and
403.32s: again this is typically we price we
406.28s: being the market but market makers and
408.56s: the rest of the market will typically
409.84s: price IV more rich in the direction that
412.76s: we expect to see movement right that's
415.48s: kind of the the notion behind it so it
417.44s: definitely has IV call right now which
419.56s: which is very interesting and it shows
422.08s: that standard I don't want to call it
423.80s: fear to the upside although it is
425.40s: partially fear you want to get
426.84s: compensated for example if you're
428.08s: selling calls to the upside you don't
429.64s: want to get ran over and that's why
431.00s: these will be priced up a little bit but
433.00s: it's also just uh expectation of
434.64s: movement so that's very interesting for
438.56s: me to see so now let's take a look at
441.68s: unusual whales and there's a couple
445.68s: things that stuck out to me so this is
448.64s: looking at gme and we're looking at gme
453.24s: for this week so essentially from the
456.32s: 18th to the 22nd we have pretty strong
459.64s: call buying activity as far as it looks
462.48s: again there's nothing huge popping off
465.04s: at me here there's a $350,000 at 27s
467.92s: which that is a big trade I want to be
469.36s: clear and this is also very very short
471.60s: term so that absolutely is interesting
475.24s: but it's still not quite massive enough
478.44s: where you know I'm I'm reading super far
480.56s: into it we do see more buildout at these
483.44s: longer expirations though the 202s are
486.28s: getting hit here for the 20s so the 20
490.28s: 26s are being traded so there's people
492.48s: trading these deeper expirations which
494.96s: is generally cool to see but there
496.60s: wasn't a whole lot from the options
498.08s: chain that's jumping out at me thinking
499.72s: like oh this is crazy I can't believe
501.80s: this is happening it looks active it
504.16s: looks moderately active is the way that
506.00s: I I would think about it now if we take
508.00s: a look at the dark pool really quick
510.60s: just to see if there's anything special
512.92s: going on this week as
515.56s: well
517.32s: and
518.88s: oh oh that's cuz it's I was going to say
521.32s: that's like really interesting that it
524.32s: would be that
525.56s: light yeah relatively quiet so there's
528.96s: definitely a handful of million-dollar
531.36s: transactions over the last few days but
534.04s: it's a little more quiet than it's been
535.92s: the last few weeks so again nothing jump
539.44s: jumping out at me here as super
541.64s: indicative one way or the other just
542.92s: looks like interesting movement but this
544.84s: isn't like skyrocketing up and out um
547.88s: I'm not seeing anything like that so the
549.96s: last thing I want to look at really
551.48s: quick though is uh well
553.96s: first ball and like Bill shout out to my
557.52s: buddy Benjamin from the Benjamin YouTube
560.12s: channel let me grab that real quick if
562.12s: you guys haven't seen this video it's a
564.12s: must um yeah Ben is a hilarious
569.52s: dude that can tell fantastic stories and
572.04s: this is all about Bill Wang and you
574.64s: should absolutely go watch this video
577.24s: make sure you subscribe to his channel
578.60s: too because his stuff is just comedic
580.24s: relief the Benjamin's also kind of like
582.20s: Batman I I talk to him pretty regularly
584.80s: but uh you never know when you're going
585.92s: to get a video from him you guys should
587.24s: know though that I'm I'm I'm like your
589.16s: biggest Advocate I constantly am
591.04s: bothering him to make more videos for
592.56s: you all cuz from a selfish perspective I
595.08s: I like what he makes so it's not just
597.44s: for you guys it's also for me but you
599.84s: know I I try to keep him keep him
602.32s: pushing on on making funny videos for us
605.00s: because he's good at it but looks like
607.88s: he's going to uh prison for a good old
610.12s: 18 years kind of rough around the edges
613.68s: isn't it so let's let's read uh former
616.88s: billionaire Sun cook Wang Bill Wang
620.20s: sentenced to it's nice that they really
622.20s: simplify that for us uh Americans you
624.76s: know they they really tend to do that
626.32s: with some of these names to really just
628.00s: make it about as basic it's it's not
629.44s: even a hard American
631.28s: name uh 18 years in prison Wednesday
634.52s: which cost Wall Street more than 10
636.20s: billion he was sentenced where jury
638.72s: convicted him on 10 criminal charges
640.40s: includ including wire fraud Securities
642.32s: fraud and Market manipulation the amount
644.44s: of losses that were caused by your
645.72s: conduct are larger than any other losses
647.52s: I've dealt with that's nice always said
649.56s: a new personal best I'm I'm a big fan of
651.32s: that in the gym and whatnot my personal
653.56s: best in the gym these days look really
655.00s: sad because I'm still dealing with the
656.24s:  herniated disc so it's a lot of
658.32s: like how many push-ups can do before my
659.84s: leg goes to sleep or something but you
661.16s: know still nice to get some PBS out here
663.76s: and it says the US Attorney office of
665.44s: Manhattan sought a 21-year present term
667.60s: for Huang unusually long for a white
669.92s: collar case and for him to Forfeit 12.35
673.00s: billion in make restitutions for victims
676.16s: I'm actually curious what he's going to
678.04s: have to pay let's
680.40s: see
682.52s: um net worth has fallen at most 55.3 mil
688.56s: so it looks like he is doing
691.84s: okay a little too okay we'll have to see
695.24s: I'll have to dig a little deeper into
696.76s: this and see like what he's actually
697.92s: going to have to pay because that's you
699.72s: know that doesn't seem like a bad margin
701.88s: if that's all you're losing on something
703.24s: like that but back to this and GameStop
707.36s: I do want to talk really quick about
710.36s: where we're seeing these options come
712.28s: through simply because trying to
714.80s: understand the the broader buildout for
717.64s: these trades so so there's a healthy mix
721.28s: I'm not going to worry too much about
722.48s: the bids right now I'm actually going to
723.80s: pull those down again sometimes we can
727.20s: have purchases that happen at a bid it's
730.00s: just rare So I want to remove the noise
732.76s: so that we can focus on the the call
734.84s: side and see if there's anything
735.80s: sticking out to us and in terms of
738.28s: overall premium build outs there's a mix
742.08s: but there's quite a few out in 25 so
744.88s: these are people building slightly
746.68s: longer term positions so I see the 10 I
749.40s: see the 20s I see the 30s I see the 29s
754.96s: so it's kind of like across the chain I
756.40s: see the 20s like we talked about before
758.56s: and again I like to see that the fact
760.96s: that I see this happening at a bunch of
762.52s: different strikes and whatnot tells us
763.84s: that there's multiple participants so it
766.12s: becomes a bigger movement if there's
768.76s: more actors involved as compared to one
771.64s: person that may or may not be a cat who
773.44s: can have a massive impact and hopefully
776.04s: we'll see more of a footprint from him
777.84s: at some point I'm excited I look
779.44s: literally every day to see if I can uh
782.00s: pick anything up cuz it's kind of fun
783.32s: it's like plain detective it's uh you
785.00s: know it's a sad Life as a Trader it's
786.60s: pretty boring if you think about
787.84s: it especially when you figure out how to
790.00s: trade it's kind of like a repetitive
791.32s: process you know what you're doing every
792.52s: day it's not like a bunch of surprises
793.84s: or excitement so this is where I get to
795.36s: find my excitement trying to see what
797.08s: kind of nonsense or crazy trades are
798.52s: going on but the from a broader
801.08s: perspective the fact that it's is flat
803.40s: across different expirations different
805.84s: strikes is good that means that there's
807.40s: a lot of participants building out and
808.76s: trading to the upside which is honestly
811.60s: exactly what I think we would want to
813.16s: see let's take a look at one more thing
815.52s: and you can see on GameStop net premium
819.28s: is heavy to the buy side we can see
823.48s: obviously there's a a really really
825.72s: large call Premium coming through so
829.00s: yeah I mean the the overall trend that
831.16s: we see here is is really positive in my
833.60s: opinion there's just so many more calls
836.28s: coming through and so many more calls uh
838.80s: being being bought which is again I I
841.48s: think generally generally strong and
843.52s: it's yeah being being traded and built
845.72s: out to the upside so that's what it's
848.28s: looking like stoked to see the life
849.76s: stoked to see 30 within sight and the
852.32s: biggest thing I'm stoked about with
853.80s: respect to 30 is not it's not like a a
856.20s: blow through 30 because of again a
858.84s: squeeze is happening which is always fun
860.92s: but this is like literally the the
862.84s: company is being valued higher and we'll
866.12s: take a closer look as it gets nearer to
867.92s: earnings so that we can run through that
869.44s: together but overall strong movement as
871.68s: always anything you want me to take a
872.76s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
874.24s: see you later
