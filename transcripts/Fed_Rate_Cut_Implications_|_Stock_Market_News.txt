0.76s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.40s: we're going to focus on the broad market
4.24s: and the fomc statement for today because
8.36s: I think it's kind of a big deal so it's
10.24s: worth spending a few minutes
12.00s: understanding what happened today and
13.64s: what that means for us going forward so
16.72s: what happened today as we all probably
19.24s: have heard at this point the FED has
23.56s: selected to decrease rates by 50 basis
27.96s: points now for those that don't know
30.64s: it's kind of a a mixed view in my
33.84s: opinion and the reason why I say it's a
35.36s: mixed view is because of a few things it
39.92s: primarily comes down to how calculated
42.24s: of a path the FED has taken so far with
45.84s: respect to rates and then this near-term
50.08s: acceleration is slightly interesting to
53.48s: me so when I take a look at some of the
57.56s: primary inflation driven metrics right
60.08s: so we can see what they're expecting
63.24s: core pce to be and what it was that
67.20s: they're clearly showing that they think
70.48s: inflation is under control that
72.68s: unemployment is strong that the economy
74.84s: overall is strong and I can see that
77.16s: perspective but I think the relatively
81.48s: last minute pivot to a 50 bips cut
84.32s: versus 25 is actually quite telling
87.56s: because everything that we've done so
89.28s: far has been like very slow very
91.12s: controlled very um it seems like very
95.04s: considerate and if there was going to be
97.96s: a 50 basis point cut in this cycle and
100.76s: it was projected like that for a month
103.40s: well I would feel a little bit
104.52s: differently but I don't because if we
107.16s: take a look at the FED watch tool before
109.92s: its most recent update there's kind of a
113.24s: an important change that happened here
116.68s: and it's leading up until the last week
120.56s: the probability of a 25 basis point cut
124.00s: was the overwhelming majority and it
127.72s: kind of cut down cut down cut down until
130.88s: about a week ago and then it finally
132.84s: inverted we now a 50 basis point cut was
136.48s: seen as more probable the fact that that
139.00s: took place over the course of about a
141.00s: week is actually quite telling to me it
144.08s: leads me to believe that based on the
147.08s: economic data that continued to flow in
150.40s: that the market started showing some
152.80s: level of concern and that starts begging
157.08s: the question with respect to inflation
160.20s: and whether or not it is fully tamped
163.00s: down and even if it is it begs the
166.48s: second question of what's the
169.28s: probability now of a recession and we
172.32s: can't Overlook that so right now I feel
175.04s: like in the near term the market is
176.88s: going through this bit of a cycle of
178.84s: euphoria so if we take a look at the
181.60s: Russell and let's take a look at what it
183.84s: did just today so we'll do like a one
186.40s: day five minute chart and let's see what
189.36s: it did today you can see I'll do it just
191.92s: for Standard Market hours so
194.64s: 0630 and you can see when the cut was
198.56s: originally announced it flew up it
201.68s: literally went from 2219 and a half as a
204.36s: low on the day to
206.76s: 22874 I actually traded this pretty l
209.76s: AED with Futures because I expected this
214.08s: move to a degree I didn't know the
215.80s: magnitude or how long it would last but
218.36s: I expected a sympathetic move what I did
221.32s: not
222.24s: expect is this subsequent return I was
225.76s: running stops and I actually exited a
228.32s: little bit premature in some instances
230.96s: because I started scaling out at about
232.76s: like the the to the 2275 handle area so
237.76s: I missed a few points to the upside but
240.56s: here's the main problem I see this is
242.88s: euphoria that then got really trounced
245.68s: down to almost pre-cut levels that's
248.92s: very interesting to me that the market
250.48s: went through that cycle so when I look
253.16s: at the where the market is right now I
255.48s: think it's very happy about the cuts and
258.56s: I think we can see that being priced in
260.96s: but I think the market is also now
263.08s: trying to understand what does this mean
265.32s: with respect to path forward and
267.04s: recession
268.16s: prospects which then influences the way
270.76s: that we set up our portfolios if we take
273.48s: a look at this from y charts we can see
277.16s: that the probability of recession be by
280.44s: August 2025 is like
282.68s: 62% then if we take a look at this
284.76s: latest by JP Morgan this is from 15
287.32s: August I'm actually very interested to
289.36s: see if they update this and what this
292.32s: will look like because they're one of
293.56s: the few institutions that actually
295.12s: called the 50 bips cut versus 25 and we
298.44s: can see as of again about a month ago
302.40s: this is showing the probability of a
303.72s: recession by the end of 2025 at about
305.80s: 45% which again is not
308.40s: insignificant so I think the problem
311.76s: that we have right now is that this
315.92s: probability of a soft Landing is not
318.24s: tiny it's there but it's also not quite
322.52s: as strong I think as some people might
324.96s: think it is and then we can see what the
327.52s: probability is again of recession by
329.72s: these different time frames because we
331.36s: can typically see from rate cut
333.32s: campaigns I'm doing actually a pretty
334.60s: big study right now to see based on
337.12s: prior rate cut campaigns what that meant
340.00s: for the stock market specifically over
342.40s: set durations after we start the rate
344.76s: cut campaign the problem is that we've
347.60s: never had the same scenario that we just
349.84s: went through where essentially we had
351.92s: rates at 0% like that's there's not a
355.40s: good comparable period for me to
357.60s: actually compare apples to apples at
359.72s: least even close to what we are going
362.08s: through now sorry to what we've gone
364.68s: through over the last 100 years so it's
368.48s: a little bit of a guessing game here now
371.28s: when I'm looking at how to trade this
373.56s: I'm playing the near-term moves and I'm
376.96s: playing them very very carefully what
379.12s: that means is running stops when the
381.60s: move today started unfolding I thought
384.80s: for sure I was an idiot for starting to
387.64s: play stops I had started them already
390.24s: had a Russell position leading into
392.04s: today it wasn't built today but I
393.96s: started scaling into it heavily today
396.00s: you can see that I've been in the
396.92s: Russell position for a little while now
399.04s: but I started scaling into it heavy
400.64s: today and I really did think like I was
403.20s: kind of an idiot for starting to set the
405.36s: stops where I did and I fully
407.88s: anticipated that some of the stops that
410.32s: I were running were going to essentially
412.08s: just get me kicked out prematurely and
414.08s: it was going to be frustrating because I
417.84s: absolutely did not expect this level of
420.24s: retracement intraday I didn't I didn't
423.44s: expect that I thought it might be coming
425.48s: down over the next two to 3 days and I
429.52s: didn't really expect a near full
431.36s: retracement I thought it would be this
433.12s: euphoria that then boiled down and then
435.56s: maybe we kept a third of the move or
437.44s: something maybe a little bit more so
439.44s: what this tells me is that the market is
441.76s: very conflicted because I do think that
444.00s: Powell chose the 50 bips to try and
446.92s: accommodate the market more than
448.20s: anything because I don't see any other
449.96s: reason why he would have done it in that
451.44s: case everybody's super critical of the
453.76s: FED I give the Fed Credit because I know
456.12s: the job they're doing is not easy and I
457.76s: know that they're not trying to break
459.28s: things they're not incentivized to do so
461.80s: but the higher for longer idea I get it
465.12s: get inflation under control starts to
466.84s: seem like that's the case now it's
469.24s: really is inflation actually under
471.40s: control and what does it actually look
474.92s: like from a recession standpoint and I
479.80s: do not know just yet we'll see we'll
483.28s: find out soon enough so yeah I'm really
485.92s: excited to dive a little further into
487.64s: this and see how the market plays out
489.44s: the rest of this week but I think now
491.60s: we're coming into the next round of
493.08s: earnings that starts actually next month
495.48s: so we'll have a lot to look at so that
498.56s: would be the next big thing I want to
501.00s: see when we're coming into October and
503.76s: we have the banks starting second week
505.84s: of October I want to know what they're
507.96s: expecting now so I'm eager to see what
511.28s: that looks like as well so as always
513.68s: anything we should take a look at let me
515.12s: know later today we have a YouTube live
516.76s: session at 5 PM we'll probably talk more
518.64s: about this and a couple other things as
520.44s: they pop up but let me know if there's
521.88s: anything else in the meantime be an
523.16s: outlier I'll see youall later
