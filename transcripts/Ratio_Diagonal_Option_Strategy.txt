0.16s: I'm going to dive into my absolute
2.52s: favorite directional trading strategy
4.80s: this is the ratio diagonal whether we
8.04s: want to trade ratio call diagonals for
10.08s: upside ratio put diagonals for downside
12.64s: I've built this strategy over 16 years
14.92s: and it combines a handful of fantastic
18.24s: trades from options along with Trend
20.48s: following strategies from equities and
22.28s: it is probably one of my favorite
24.00s: strategies for smaller accounts because
26.84s: of the leverage provided within so we're
29.24s: going to walk through what it is how
31.12s: they work and then at the end an actual
33.12s: example with some best practices so that
35.28s: you can take all that information
36.64s: hopefully build your own variation of
38.08s: the strategy that helps you make money
40.52s: what's up everybody Eric K welcome back
42.08s: to all the outliers a shout out to the
44.00s: patreon family you guys make content
45.60s: like this possible and if what I do
47.16s: helps you in any way consider signing up
49.28s: it helps me a lot okay let's get right
51.36s: in why should you care about this
54.20s: strategy well it's pretty simple I got
55.80s: three things for you the first one is
57.40s: leverage this strategy provides leverage
60.76s: the second thing is it's a defined risk
62.64s: strategy so for newer Traders this kind
65.68s: of protects us even though we still need
68.28s: to apply careful profit and loss
70.48s: management which we'll get into later
72.20s: the fact that it opens right out of the
74.12s: gate to find risk is actually a good
76.16s: thing because sometimes newer Traders
78.04s: come across different strategies they
79.60s: don't fully understand and then they end
80.96s: up putting on risk that they don't even
82.28s: know is there and then they get ran over
83.96s: and then the last thing because of those
85.80s: first two it's a pretty efficient
87.76s: directional play so what do I mean by
90.00s: leverage pretty simple I recently had a
91.68s: trade on this is the example we're going
93.00s: to go through at the end but I had six
95.60s: long call options that were deep in the
97.68s: money on RTX which is Ron and the
100.64s: equivalent Equity size for that position
103.12s: the notional value would have been
104.64s: $50,000 actually a little bit over that
106.76s: and then for the options positions that
108.64s: I put on it was actually under $9,000 it
111.24s: was like 8,800 bucks or whatever so the
113.28s: point being is I was controlling the
115.72s: same size position in this scenario but
119.20s: it was a FR fraction of the cost now you
121.44s: might be saying that seems really good
123.16s: why wouldn't everybody do that because
124.92s: whenever you trade options we're adding
126.72s: some complexity options have an
128.52s: expiration date so you can't just buy it
130.32s: and hold it and then eventually hope it
131.68s: moves in your favor there's some
133.20s: subtleties that get baked into this that
135.36s: are what actually allow us to identify
138.48s: opportunities like this leverages and
140.00s: free so and that's a good thing that
141.68s: means that there's opportunity for us
143.56s: within so let's talk about the structure
145.96s: it is super simple the first part of the
149.08s: trade the first leg is a long deep in
152.72s: the money option A far DTE long
156.36s: expiration out I use at the very least
159.00s: 90 days to expiration the majority of
161.52s: the time it's between 180 and 365 so
164.68s: somewhere between 6 and 12 months is my
166.96s: normal but you could go in as far as 90
169.60s: days I've done that previously
171.56s: specifically if you're catching a trend
173.04s: that's in progress and then that's the
174.80s: first leg the second leg is we're going
176.76s: to be short a near DTE option this is
180.12s: pretty much anything within 30 DTE I
182.80s: tend to focus on stuff that's maybe uh
185.84s: you know 2 weeks 3 weeks something like
187.96s: that so these are kind of the two
189.52s: variations that we have we have long
191.44s: call plus short call that's the bullish
194.52s: variation and then long put plus short
197.24s: putut is the bearish variation pretty
199.96s: simple stuff here so now let's take a
202.32s: look at some of the traits that I look
204.36s: for though specifically in the long leg
207.56s: which is over here days expiration I
209.36s: already t to you about the Delta this
211.28s: part is important the reason why we go
213.56s: so far in the money is multiple fotes
216.60s: the first reason is it gives us the
219.08s: ability to move closer dollar for dooll
222.12s: with the underlying for those that don't
223.60s: remember Delta everything else setus
225.72s: parabus everything else remaining the
226.96s: same Delta tells us how much the premium
228.88s: of an option is going to move for every
230.28s: $1 move in the underline so if we have
232.32s: something with an 0 Delta that means for
234.16s: every $1 move in the underlying we're
236.28s: going to see 80 cents of that again
237.92s: everything else remaining the same the
239.24s: point being is by going further in the
240.92s: money we move and we create essentially
243.52s: a stock replacement the second thing is
245.92s: by going so far in the money we actually
248.84s: reduce the extrinsic value of the
251.16s: options I'll show you what I mean right
252.48s: now here we have RTX and let's go far
256.00s: out in time let's go out to the 16 FB
259.32s: and if we take a look at a 80 Delta plus
262.60s: long call somewhere one one of these two
264.96s: you can see that even though these are
266.60s: 174 days expiration you're only paying
269.36s: about a dollar per contract in Theta in
273.20s: extrinsic value so what that means is
275.20s: the Theta Decay on these options is
277.12s: actually pretty small so if you take a
278.64s: look at Theta Decay here it's
281.36s: .02 so each day they burn essentially to
284.40s: pennies whereas if we do something
286.00s: that's further close to DTE in time
288.44s: closer to us if you take a look the
290.28s: Theta now for that same option
292.60s: essentially is now .03 so the closer we
296.88s: get in DTE Theta is going to pick up
298.76s: because all options have to approximate
300.64s: to either in the money whatever their
302.20s: intrinsic value is or zero if they're
303.68s: out of the money so that's why I like
306.56s: the long deep in the money option now
308.84s: there are some trade-offs here because
310.68s: the further out in time you go the
313.12s: deeper in the money you go the more
315.52s: expensive it is upfront but the way that
317.56s: I look at it is with the rest of the
319.72s: management that we're going to put in
321.08s: place that expensiveness is kind of like
323.08s: a down payment it doesn't just go away
325.88s: at the end of this whole thing you
327.40s: actually are able to maintain a lot of
329.68s: the value that you're paying up out
330.96s: front now again it could completely move
332.96s: against you and then all of that can
334.48s: change but by going further in the money
337.24s: further out in time you are benefiting
339.48s: maximizing your leverage potential
341.24s: dollar for dooll move you don't need as
342.84s: big of a move to make money and then the
344.36s: second thing is decreasing Theta Decay
346.16s: now if you notice I do have a thing
347.52s: saying can include kickers kickers
349.96s: simply put are far out of the money
352.36s: options you could do it in the same
354.04s: expiration if you wanted to still
355.84s: decrease your Theta Decay but
357.84s: essentially it's the opposite idea idea
360.04s: where we're going to pick up something
361.68s: that's further out in time if I'm doing
364.20s: kicker options with something like this
366.16s: I tend to pick something that is maybe
368.64s: 30 or 40 days out because the whole idea
371.00s: of a kicker option is we want to
372.72s: maximize our gamma the idea is we grab
375.80s: something in addition to our base
377.60s: position that is now further out of the
379.84s: money and would compound quickly so
382.84s: that's the idea of a kicker option and
384.68s: then for the short it's super simple
387.00s: essentially like I said within 30 days
389.24s: and our Delta on the short needs to be
392.16s: above a Critical Strike I'll explain
393.84s: what that means in a little bit but
395.32s: essentially this is how it plays out and
398.36s: I want to specifically show you what I
400.44s: mean by ratio that's what this whole
403.12s: strategy is called right ratio diagonals
406.00s: yes I know that y ratios well here's
409.12s: exactly why this is a typical call
412.48s: diagonal so this is further out in time
415.32s: this is like 180 days out but this isn't
418.16s: at the money long call and then in a
421.28s: shorter expiration a short call notice
424.96s: how after you go up a certain amount
428.32s: there's actually upside risk this is a
431.28s: problem if I'm trading a ratio called
433.32s: diagonal I am bullish I want it to go up
436.72s: in this case we run into a problem if
439.44s: we're right and let's say we're super
441.64s: right we're actually wrong we now start
443.92s: to lose money I don't want that yeah no
446.76s:  so this is why we use a ratio
449.84s: so in this case as you can see down here
452.08s: I'm simulating being long five of these
455.20s: style options that are deep in the money
457.00s: and short three so in this case we have
460.16s: unlimited upside potential that is
462.76s: exactly why we use the ratio if we add
464.68s: one more view to this this is using the
466.48s: put side right so if we're long puts we
469.04s: want things to go down but again we
470.92s: don't want to be wrong if we're right
473.24s: what I mean by that is if we get the
474.92s: down move we think is going to happen we
476.80s: don't want to be penalized if it's big
478.68s: so this is exactly how we can maintain
481.80s: unlimited profit potential when trading
483.92s: these diagonals is trading them at a
485.40s: ratio and by respecting this Critical
488.28s: Strike concept which we're going to get
490.20s: into actually in just a second so let's
493.64s: take a look at the strategy itself how I
497.04s: think about deploying it from beginning
499.32s: to end and then we'll get over to the
500.88s: example so when we're talking about
503.08s: these directional strategies it starts
505.64s: with your directional assumption
507.16s: whatever that is so you should follow
509.92s: whatever your process is to create a
512.92s: directional assumption that's exactly
514.68s: what's going on here then when we're
516.44s: looking at something like sizing
518.76s: allocation scaling this is pretty
520.84s: straightforward for me I have a process
522.72s: for it where the first thing I'm going
524.00s: to do is look at my entire portfolio all
526.40s: of the risk that's out there I'm going
528.32s: to assess this opportunity that has come
531.28s: up and then I'm going to decide how does
533.32s: it fit into my portfolio and how much
535.64s: money does it get so for example in the
538.60s: RTX strategy we're going to talk about
540.20s: in a second that entire allocation was
542.96s: $10,000 that's the total amount of money
545.40s: that that position was a lotted then we
548.56s: have what I like to call the initial
550.28s: outlay in scaling protocols the initial
553.24s: outlay is how much of this total amount
556.00s: of money are you going to deploy Upfront
558.40s: for me it's typically 80% or less so if
561.44s: I allocate $10,000 I'm my initial outlay
565.24s: will use 8,000 or less and this gives me
568.56s: room to scale a little bit and the
571.36s: trade-off here is the more outlay you
573.88s: use up front the better the move is
575.76s: going to work if it goes in your favor
577.60s: the more it's going to hurt if it
578.60s: doesn't and the less you have left over
580.20s: for scaling and then for scaling it can
581.96s: be really simple or complex depending on
584.56s: however you conduct your directional
586.88s: assumptions for me I like to use support
589.36s: and resistant breakouts on a trend
591.08s: following approach so that I can both
593.64s: scale in when I'm right or as things are
596.56s: dropping if I'm still strongly convicted
600.08s: I will add limited scaling to the
602.40s: downside to average into the trade this
605.28s: is a really dangerous approach and I
607.92s: generally do not recommend adding any
610.04s: money to losing positions it's bad
612.12s: practice in some instances I will most
615.60s: of the time you should avoid it in my
617.80s: opinion because throwing good money
620.04s: after bad money is a horrible tendency
622.04s: for most Traders and they just compound
623.84s: their losses however it can be a really
627.40s: effective approach to Max maximize a
629.96s: short-term pullback in a longer term up
632.12s: move or vice versa if you're bearish
634.32s: option selection so we already talked to
636.16s: you about DTE the way it works for the
638.72s: long options is the further out in time
641.32s: you go the more time you have to be
642.80s: right the lower your Theta Decay the
644.48s: more expensive it is you have to figure
646.20s: out which of those combinations make
647.96s: sense for you as far as the short option
649.92s: like I said anything within 3 weeks I
651.84s: think is fine typically for me it'll be
653.48s: 2 to three we really want to expose
655.40s: ourselves to the aggressive portion of
657.60s: the Theta Decay curve that's the whole
659.04s: whole point of adding those short
660.00s: options they hedge a little bit of our
661.76s: risk but it's also to make some money
663.32s: when things don't go exactly in our
664.84s: favor which is exactly what my example
666.64s: is about actually then Delta like I said
668.92s: for the long options I prefer 80 Delta
671.68s: plus the further in the money you go the
673.76s: more expensive it is the less extrinsic
676.36s: value you're buying so that means lower
679.04s: Theta Decay and the better you're going
681.08s: to move dollar for dooll with the
682.56s: underlying but because it's expensive
684.68s: upfront you're not going to see those
686.48s: th% return on those long options for me
689.24s: that's not my goal again it's kind of
691.20s: what you need to pay attention to and
692.76s: then for the short options we need to
695.16s: pay very close attention to our ratio
698.04s: and our adjusted cost basis and our
699.92s: Critical Strike which I'll get into in
701.60s: the example and then the ratio this is
703.40s: super simple you buy whatever number of
705.52s: long options that you want and then when
707.12s: you're selling the short options you are
709.04s: faced again with a trade-off if you sell
712.20s: at a higher ratio so let's say if in
715.80s: this example we are doing uh let me grab
720.24s: this one so in this example if we're
722.56s: long Five Short three we could be long
725.04s: Five Short four we could even be long
727.44s: Five Short five and in this case because
729.68s: the Deltas are set up properly there's
731.20s: no upside risk on this first trade what
733.00s: are the what's the difference well the
735.16s: more short options you sell against the
737.44s: long the more money you're going to
739.08s: collect upfront the more upside
741.80s: potential you going to give up if you
744.60s: get your move so I tend to be about
747.24s: 50/50 disposition meaning I like to
749.44s: cover about half maybe slightly over
751.32s: half it again comes down to your overall
753.92s: disposition towards the product I have a
755.92s: recent trade actually in apple that I'll
757.72s: throw a link in the video below that I
760.28s: covered a lot on our YouTube live
761.76s: sessions that talks a lot about this
763.92s: exact ratio concept and how I adjusted
766.16s: my ratio throughout the life cycle of
767.64s: the trade but that is really the long
769.96s: and short of it there for the short
771.52s: options the more you sell up front the
773.24s: more money you're going to collect up
774.52s: front the more upside you give up and
776.28s: then the inverse and then the management
777.80s: cycle once we enter the trade so we find
780.80s: our long options then our short options
783.32s: I like to enter the long options with a
785.60s: single lot first to test liquidity
788.76s: liquidity is really important because
791.36s: we're adding a bunch of things that
793.44s: actually go against looking for
795.24s: liquidity we're going deep in the money
797.04s: which tends to decrease liquidity we're
798.72s: going far out in time also tends to
801.16s: decrease liquidity so it's super
803.48s: important when you're trading anything
805.68s: like this with ratio diagonals using the
807.84s: long options the way that I tend to
809.24s: structure them you have got to check
811.96s: liquidity it's got to be reasonable if
814.64s: you have to struggle to get into the
816.20s: trade at a fair price just imagine how
819.00s: difficult it's going to be to get out at
820.68s: a fair price because I do not take these
823.88s: to expiration essentially what's going
826.00s: to happen we have four total scenarios
828.96s: your p&l is hit whatever your profit and
831.36s: loss is once you enter the trade so
833.72s: again I'll show you an example in a
835.00s: second on how I set those up personally
837.00s: but that's the first exit criteria this
838.80s: the second criteria is the short option
841.72s: is out of the money then you can choose
843.48s: to add more short options the short
845.64s: option is in the money so if our short
847.72s: call short put falls in the money what I
849.60s: like to do is sell some of my long
852.60s: options to cover the cost of the in a
855.60s: money short option this does a few
857.08s: things one it makes sure that I'm
860.16s: realizing profits as I'm realizing
862.72s: losses because if we have a short in the
864.68s: money option that we need to close if
867.00s: you just close this and continue the
868.80s: trade there's nothing to say that the
870.08s: whole thing doesn't roll over and then
871.72s: not only did you realize a loss there
873.32s: but then the rest of the position start
874.60s: showing a loss so I use this actually as
876.92s: criteria to help me start scaling out of
878.88s: the trade naturally and then the fourth
880.88s: scenario that's not listed here but is
883.16s: very common for me is if I enter a trade
885.40s: with 180 DTE once I start getting within
888.52s: 90 DTE I'm going to naturally manage it
891.36s: either it did or didn't hit my profit
893.28s: and loss targets and I'm just kind of
894.80s: trending sideways I might reestablish
897.04s: rooll further out but I don't want to
899.00s: take those long options within 90 DTE
902.20s: more often than not let's get to the
904.80s: example so this is the example trade in
906.92s: RTX and let me show you what that
910.00s: actually looks like I entered here with
912.88s: the long options I started selling short
915.00s: options here here here and here is when
917.76s: I exited in total you can see all of
920.56s: those movements here I'm not going to
921.96s: run through it l by line with you but I
923.72s: want to highlight a few high notes the
926.04s: first one is this was a kind of a unique
929.24s: scenario for me I typically am not super
931.24s: bullish here to be honest especially
932.76s: after a big drop but because it was
934.44s: earnings driven short-term price mean
936.92s: reversion is what I was considering and
939.48s: that's kind of what I was expecting to
940.92s: see I didn't see it and even though I
944.04s: did not see the move that I wanted I
945.96s: still made money that's why I'm using
947.60s: this as an example because if you want
949.32s: an example of like a really profitable
951.12s: one take a look at the Apple one that I
953.04s: threw in the notes below because that
954.44s: was just smooth saling all the way
955.84s: through made a bunch of money there as a
957.48s: percent return on that trade because it
959.20s: did exactly what I wanted this I think
961.20s: shows some of the power of this strategy
963.16s: because this was a bullish trade that I
965.44s: didn't get the move and I still made
967.04s: money so this is again just kind of my
969.36s: own version of the tracker there's some
970.96s: issues with the math in here and it's
972.52s: just to make this show up as it is but
974.84s: overall this turned out to be about a 7%
977.48s: return on invested Capital even though I
979.56s: was completely wrong and these are the
981.44s: formulas that I was referring to before
983.48s: the Critical Strike is this formula
986.84s: right here and the reason why we care
988.80s: about the Critical Strike is because as
990.96s: this trade evolves over time we do not
993.44s: want upside risk this is what prevents
995.40s: it the adjusted long call basis is
998.08s: exactly what we feed into the Critical
999.60s: Strike as you could tell the long call
1001.48s: basis takes a look at how much our cost
1003.84s: were for the long options the closed in
1006.00s: the money short options and then any
1008.08s: closed long options to cover the cost of
1011.24s: the short options that were in the money
1013.04s: we had to cover so this just keeps
1014.84s: pretty close tracking of what the basis
1016.96s: is as again the trade evolve and then
1019.16s: the last one we have the number of lots
1023.04s: we can sell and in this case you can
1025.60s: either use a risk profile super simply
1027.76s: from the platform like this if you were
1029.52s: so inclined just like this it'll tell
1031.56s: you you know those kinds of things no
1033.20s: problem or you can do the math which
1035.44s: essentially we just take a look at our
1037.12s: long option our number of lots that we
1039.88s: have out the Delta the current Delta of
1042.56s: those long options and then we divide it
1044.56s: by 2.1 times the short option Delta this
1047.28s: just makes sure that we have no upside
1050.04s: risk so this was kind of a broad
1051.92s: overview of the strategy however if you
1054.00s: have any questions comments concerns let
1055.60s: me know in the comments below if you
1056.96s: found this useful also let me know and
1059.32s: if you're interested I can do a
1060.72s: follow-up video diving much further into
1062.80s: detail on both of these however we're
1064.76s: already 20 minutes in I know this stuff
1066.80s: can be a little bit heavy but these are
1068.56s: literally the ways that I typically
1070.88s: trade these are some of my primary
1072.20s: strategies so I hope this is helpful be
1074.44s: an outlier don't forget like subscribe
1076.44s: share catch you guys later
