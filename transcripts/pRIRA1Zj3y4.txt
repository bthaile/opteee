0.00s: GameStop has just reported its earnings. So it's time to take a look, see what's going
5.76s: on, how things are going. And as you can see, we closed at 2693 and right now we're trading
12.56s: in the low 28s now. So we've upticked a little bit because right after the release is actually
18.52s: downticked not too insignificantly. But as the news is being digested, it definitely
25.40s: is starting to take back up. So let's see what's going on. Now there were a couple changes
33.00s: and adjustments in the reporting period as a lot of people forecasted the options markets
38.32s: told that we kind of knew that that was coming. So they decided to move to today after the
42.16s: close. And we can see overall the company has done pretty well. So let's talk about it.
48.76s: So net sales were at 0.86 billion compared to 1.078 billion for the prior year, third quarter.
56.72s: So this was one of the marks against it to a degree. We did see overall sales come down
63.56s: a little bit selling general and administrative S.G.N.A. expenses, 222 million for the period
70.00s: compared to 2.96. That's kind of what you would expect that that will have been flow depending
74.48s: on what's going on in the back end. We really care about stuff like this net income, 17.4
79.12s: million compared to the net loss of 3.1 million for the prior year quarter. This is a lot
83.52s: to do with the cash hoard that they're sitting on and able to make some money from. So cash,
89.32s: cash equivalents and marketable securities were at 4.616 billion. So that helps them a lot.
95.16s: You can earn a decent amount of interest off of that. Now quick note, that's not what a company
101.48s: is for. So even though it's great that GameStop is sitting on a pile of cash, it gives them time
108.44s: in choices. But that's not a, you know, just sit on a cash pile and then counter gold coins.
115.32s: The company still has to be a company. It still has to generate positive revenue over time.
121.08s: Now, I see a lot of people that are just kind of talking about how much interest they can earn
125.56s: from the cash, which is good. But what investors in the market is going to want to see even more
131.64s: importantly is how is it going to start using that cash who drive income to drive sales right now.
139.00s: It's giving it a cushion, which is beautiful. During the quarter of the company completed,
143.48s: it's previously disclosed at the market equity offering. So we already know all that went through.
148.60s: They sold 20 million shares of the common stock. For the aggregate gross proceeds of about 400
155.16s: million, the company does not anticipate any further at the market offerings involving the offer
162.44s: in sale of its common stock during the current fiscal year. So this is them letting everybody know
166.84s: kind of what the roadmap looks like going forward. They did not hold a conference call, which is
171.40s: their norm. And they just ran out through the, ran the information out through the thank you.
177.96s: So let's see what else is going on that we saw a couple things that took my IEPS,
184.68s: obviously we had a beat on EPS. We were, what was it expected at originally? It was expected at
191.48s: nothing came in at like six cents or four cents, I think. Yeah, so it came in at four cents adjusted
198.28s: was six cents. So we did have a little bit of a profit on EPS, which is solid. This is what I saw
206.12s: stuck out to me is sales kind of fell not tremendously short, but on a smaller metric like this in
215.40s: terms of smaller overall sales number. This is not insignificant miss. And I think that this was part
222.36s: of the initial reaction, but we can see that we're in profit, which is awesome. Like that's incredible
230.44s: for the stock, especially this time of year. Even though sales is declined because of what it's
235.40s: able to do with the cash pile. So let's take a look at the stock itself. It's now down a little bit
241.72s: into the high 27s. We'll see where this settles, but so far this looks like we'll have a little bit of
247.96s: a gap up on the day tomorrow. Now it's still going to take time for all this to settle. Then we need
252.60s: pre market tomorrow. All that needs to settle in before we'll really know where this is going to land,
257.72s: but we can at least come up with some context clues on where it might wind up, but it is being
263.08s: bit down a little bit more. It's hanging around 27 and a half. This is what I first saw it at.
267.24s: So I would love for it to stop here. It's continuing to go, which would be great if you chill out any
272.92s: second now. We'll let that sort of life up. Let's take a look at the options chain. Because the
277.64s: options chain was really interestingly positioned for this. There was 709,000 calls against 279 on the
284.28s: put side. But if we take a look at this front expiration that includes earnings, you can see
288.52s: massive all skew. So this is people across the board definitely playing earnings because that's
294.28s: the only reason why you're in this expiration. This heavy and they're playing it to the upside.
298.84s: And you can see that the skew in this is significant, especially for front expiration skew.
305.24s: So to me, this looks like a lot of people that were expecting a bit of a positive result.
310.36s: And it makes sense, right? Because we could all see from a million miles away that the earnings
315.24s: estimates EPS were about flat. But everybody knew that they're sitting on the cashboard. We can
320.04s: all do the math and see what they're going to yield from that from just holding a cash. So we knew
324.28s: that they were going to come out a little bit positive. So we knew that they were going to beat
328.60s: at least a little bit. So that probably was largely priced in. It's not that everybody knows that.
334.76s: Right? So it's not this massive source of deep information that folks don't know. But it's
341.64s: still good to see the activity in the front. So leading for the rest of the options,
347.00s: change though, you can see that we really have a dense centralization of options that out in 17,
353.40s: Jan 25. That's super cool. That is people playing a longer term idea of these options have been
360.68s: dominant on the chain for some time now. So even though we clearly have some speculation for the
365.32s: 13 D's 20 D's most of the open interest is way out here in 17 Jan 25, which is fantastic.
373.16s: Taking a look at the actual earning statement released by GameStop, there was a couple of other
378.12s: things in here that stuck out to me. So everybody's talking about the net sales, falling a little bit
382.76s: short and kind of contracting over the prior period. But what I find also know where these take a
391.00s: look at the cost of the sales cost of the sales has come down noteworthy. So that means in
397.88s: terms of gross profit, we're down a little bit, but it's not quite as bad at face value of just
402.76s: net sales missing for a bit because we did have cost contract at the same time, which is fantastic.
408.68s: Operating losses did expand interest income. We saw also expanded to the downside a little bit.
415.32s: And you can see the total income here though was marginally and net income
422.60s: well healthy, like really, really healthy from this perspective. So the company itself is doing okay.
430.84s: Now it goes back to what I am also eager to know, which is what is the plan for the cash pile?
438.28s: There's there's a plan. You know that there's a plan. There are smart people involved in this
442.44s: company looking at how they continue to move and transform it. We know that they're taking their
447.16s: time with what they want to do with the money as they should. They should identify good opportunities
451.72s: that they're comfortable with that they think will reflect positively on the company. But
456.84s: I want to know what the damn plan is. I'm so curious because there's a lot of ways that they can
460.28s: go with this thing. So they're in a great spot. That's as I look through this, that's overwhelmingly
466.76s: what I'm seeing. Take a look at net or total current assets absolutely ballooned up from this
473.24s: right here, which is just cash, right? Sitting on an absolute pile of cash. Inventories came down a
481.80s: little bit, prepaid expenses upload. So it's like they have money to use when they're ready to use
487.56s: it. Total assets is up significantly. One slight thing that's a little interesting here is even
494.68s: with the cash total assets isn't up quite as much as I might expect. So I don't think it's a big deal,
503.48s: but it is something I'm just keeping an eye on because that tells us obviously that some of this
509.72s: cash is being used for some business use cases as it's the company itself is navigating what it's
518.52s: going to be doing. Liabilities is up. We know that we can skip through there. And so let's take a
526.44s: look at this. We can see we're starting with our net income net cash flows is up 24.6 compared to
535.32s: 19.1. So that's pretty solid. And this is going to be a large reflection of just how much cash
542.36s: we're sitting on for cash approval. It's obviously. So yeah, overall earnings I think is pretty solid.
548.04s: All things considered the company looks like it's in a pretty good position here. Now it's all about
553.32s: what's what does GameStop become? And that's kind of fun to think about as much as I want to know,
558.76s: I kind of like not knowing because it leads to a lot of really fun conversations and brainstorming
563.80s: from people on where they think the company might go. So that's the question I leave you with. Where do
568.04s: you think GameStop goes from here? What does it do with the money? You're not allowed. See you later.
