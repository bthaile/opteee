 I've been trading options for 10 years, and these are my five biggest tips. Our next thing to review together and see what we can learn from it. Now a couple of things to note from our friend, Grow Your Conscious. One of the things I find interesting is looking back over my trade and career, I started trading in 2007. So I've been in markets for a little over 18 years now. And it's that you go through these different phases where you learn different lessons that are really hard to fully understand and acknowledge until you hit different experience levels in the market. So the goal of this video is to see how much of that we can short cut. There's a couple of things in here that I think are worth double clicking into because I don't fully agree with a couple ideas. But one of the things you'll notice is if you're going to trade options long term, you have to get really good with nuance and we're going to talk about that. So let's see what we got. The first one here says, understand what you're actually trading. Options aren't just stocks, but cooler. You're trading volatility time expectations. If you don't understand what implied volatility crushes, why theta decay matters or how delta works in different market conditions slow down and study, clicking buttons is easy knowing what they mean is the game. Couldn't agree more. Point is so perfect because so many options traders will just literally start doing exactly what they're talking about, clicking buttons, but they don't take the time to understand things like the Greeks and the Greeks, it's like overused term almost. It's like people who start talking about the Greeks are the first group of people that feel like they know what they're doing. And the funny part is is like they're just table stakes. It's just entry into understanding what you're trading. The Greeks are so important because they help you understand how your position is going to behave, how the options themselves behave. And to their exact point, whether you want to or not, you absolutely are trading volatility anytime you touch an option because options deal with the forward expectation of things. And implied volatility is the forward expectation of movement. This is such a great concept to get across to people, but it's one of those concepts that unfortunately, there is no way to say this that will get people to accept it and onboard it until they go through enough of it by themselves and have those instances where they put on a winning trade. Well, they think that it's going to be a winning trade and the thing goes in their direction, but they still lose money. And that's when they'll learn about volatility, stuff like that. This one never yolo weekly out of the money calls puts with size. I get it. It's fun. And when it hits it's euphoric, but let me be blunt. It's not a strategy. It's a lottery ticket. I've done it. I've won some, but long term, it's self sabotage use the fine wrist trades and understand your property profit. I think this is completely fair. I really don't like like broad platitudes like this, like the never, but I completely agree with it in this context of never doing it with size. I think that's completely perfect as a concept to get across. Now this I don't agree with use defined wrist trades. I think defining your risk. If this is part of that, I think that makes a lot of sense. But typically when I read it in this context, I think of people that are saying either bioptions or use spreads because undefined wrist strategies are some of my most profitable strategies. However, even in those undefined wrist strategies to follow this point more thoroughly, you can define your own risk even if you're using an undefined wrist strategy. So if they're meaning it in that sense, couldn't agree with that more because you can always define your risk before you enter your trade and you should. Next one time is the most underrated killer. Fated K is relentless. Buying options means you're fighting the clock selling options on the other hand puts time on your side. Just make sure you're managing risk properly. Let a few sense of premium tempt you into naked calls on a short squeeze. Yes, I've been there. See, this is where like people's bias and still inexperience comes through a little bit because they frame this as if buying options is more difficult because you're quote unquote fighting the clock as compared to selling options. And I wouldn't make that comparison because they're different things. And there's a lot of things you can do to decrease how much time is actually coming out of your option. If we come over to an option chain and we look at spy and we just loosely look at theta across different explorations, you can literally use something like this to get a good idea of what this looks like. So I'm going to do out of the money and I'm going to clean up the expiration cycles here and I'm just going to add one or two. Let's add one that's further out in time. So this is showing you your theta decay. The first thing that I want you to notice is that if you're at the money, notice how it dips. That means your theta decay is higher. Notice how if you go far out of the money, your theta becomes much less. And notice how if you go further out in time, your theta decay really decreases pretty significantly. So the point to drive home here is there's nothing wrong with theta decay. There's a reason why it exists. And just because there's theta decay doesn't mean that it's insufficient to buy options and the game is that much harder because here's the thing. If you're good at trading directionally, buying options is going to make you so much more money than selling options. It's not funny. So this comes down more so to what is the profit mechanism that you're trying to trade and what fits. I would highly encourage any options trader to not fall into the like binary buy or sell one is better than the other because they're not. They're literally just used for different things. So I fully agree with time is an underrated killer. I don't agree with the idea that selling is easier than buying because of fighting the clock. So there's everything to do with what your strategy is and what the profit mechanism is that you're trading. Next one earnings plays are coin flips, not edge. This I've immediately disagree with and it's funny because this is actually one of the most well studied aspects of options and the thing to consider here and I'm going to show you some research that actually goes into this in detail. They're talking about this from some sort of directional lens, which the funny thing is even if you trade them directionally, there's some really, really effective strategies to trading earnings directionally based on analyzing something like flow. So I was surprised for them to say this one out right. It looks like they probably have had some bad experiences with it themselves, but I absolutely think that if you ax those out, you were missing such a great unrelated, uncorrelated return source that shouldn't be crossed out this way. So here's the thing. We know in general implied volatility is overstated relative to realize volatility. We also know that coming into earnings releases, it's a binary event. You're going to get some sort of information release that's going to massively change depending on what kind of information is released, the perception of the stock, how people are positioning and so on. The reason why that's important is because it levels the playing field. It's more difficult to know and surprise things really well because nobody really knows what's going to come out during them. That's what levels the playing field. So they're really not coin flips if you trade them effectively as a strategy. Now to that end, any one single earnings play is effectively a coin flip because you don't know what's going to come out. But as a strategy, there are themes that we can measure, quantify, I have a video that talks about trading earnings. If you remind me, I'll probably forget in the comments, I can link a video to it. But take this study for example. So this is on page 26 so we can get back to it quick. But you can check this one out. This is earnings announcements and options returns. You literally can just go to SSRN and look up earnings and you'll come across all sorts of things. So in this study, which is peer reviewed, they came across that there are predictable pattern of returns around earnings. You can see different strategies that they use that actually average decent returns over markets. So this is essentially playing the expansion leading into earnings, the contraction post earnings. You can absolutely trade both of these effects. I regularly do myself. So the main note here is that each individual earnings play is indeed a coin flip. But it's as if you have a 50, 50 coin, but if you win, you get a dollar and a nickel. And if you lose, you lose a dollar. That's a better comparison. So in this case, the event itself absolutely is a coin flip. But you can build strategies around that coin flip based on other factors, including implied volatility, which we covered earlier, that actually leads to profitable approaches. Again, we can throw a link in the notes below if I forget. Remind me in the comments. Next one, always play in your exit before entry. Literally completely accurate. There should never be a case where this is not done. So regardless of where you choose to get out by having a defined plan before you enter the trade is always going to be better for you long term than trying to figure it out as you go. This I completely agree. This says, I'm just trading isn't about genius level predictions, complicated Greek spreadsheets. Well, this side, I don't know. I think that there might be an element of understanding the Greeks and impacts, especially if you take it to a professional level, because making it sound like complicated Greek spreadsheets, it's really not that complicated. But this is the main point. It's not really about genius level predictions completely agree. And I do think it's about discipline. I do think it's about risk management. And I do think it's about knowing what you're betting on. I think that these are all completely fair. And this is a great point. The sooner that you take it seriously instead of a hobby, the sooner you stand a chance to start making money. But this comes with investing the time and effort to understanding what they are and naturally building the seemingly complicated Greek spreadsheets because they're, again, they're not that complicated and you can learn a lot from them, even through the exercise of building it. So overall, I think this is a great post. I think there's a couple things that I would approach slightly differently. One of those being not falling into one camp buying or selling because if one was clearly better than the other, the other side wouldn't exist. And they each have their use case from my own anecdotal experience. Learnings plays each individual event. I absolutely would consider it a coin flip, but you can build a strategy that has edge around that coin flip. And I think that planning your exit before entry always makes sense. Same thing with never yolling with too much size or not taking the time to understand what you're trading. Really good post. If there's anything you would add to this, let me know in the comments. Be an outlier. See you all later.
