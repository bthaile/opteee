0.00s: I've been trading options for 10 years, and these are my five biggest tips.
6.28s: Our next thing to review together and see what we can learn from it.
11.48s: Now, a couple things to note from our friend, Grow Your Conscious.
16.28s: One of the things I find interesting is looking back over my trading career, I started
20.72s: trading in 2007.
21.72s: So, I've been in markets for a little over 18 years now.
25.36s: And it's that you go through these different phases where you learn different
29.96s: lessons that are really hard to fully understand and acknowledge until you hit different
35.40s: experience levels in the market.
36.92s: So, the goal of this video is to see how much of that we can shortcut.
40.00s: There's a couple things in here that I think are worth double-clicking into because I don't
44.64s: fully agree with a couple ideas.
48.60s: But one of the things you'll notice is if you're going to trade options long-term, you have
54.44s: to get really good with new wants, and we're going to talk about that.
57.92s: So, let's see what we got.
60.72s: The first one here says, understand what you're actually trading.
64.64s: Options aren't just stocks but cooler.
66.44s: You're trading volatility time, expectations.
69.44s: If you don't understand what implied volatility crushes, why theta decay matters or how
73.44s: delta works in different market conditions slow down and study.
76.96s: Clicking buttons is easy, knowing what they mean is the game.
80.08s: Couldn't agree more.
81.36s: This point is so perfect because so many options traders will just literally start doing
88.64s: exactly what they're talking about, clicking buttons.
91.16s: But they don't take the time to understand things like the Greeks.
94.68s: And the Greeks, it's like overused term almost.
98.56s: It's like people who start talking about the Greeks or the first group of people that
103.32s: feel like they know what they're doing.
105.48s: And the funny part is they're just table stakes.
108.12s: It's just entry into understanding what you're trading.
111.04s: The Greeks are so important because they help you understand how your position is going
116.20s: to behave, how the options themselves behave.
120.36s: And to their exact point, whether you want to or not, you absolutely are trading volatility
127.36s: anytime you touch an option because options deal with the forward expectation of things.
134.28s: And implied volatility is the forward expectation of movement.
140.56s: So this is such a great concept to get across to people.
145.56s: But it's one of those concepts that unfortunately there is no way to say this that will get
150.36s: people to like accept it on board it until they go through enough of it by themselves
154.48s: and have those instances where they put on a winning trade.
157.84s: Well, they think that it's going to be a winning trade and the thing goes in their
161.52s: direction, but they still lose money.
163.32s: And that's when they'll learn about volatility stuff like that.
166.96s: Next one, never, yo low weekly out of the money calls puts with size.
171.56s: I get it.
172.04s: It's fun and when it hits it's you for it.
174.04s: But let me be blunt.
175.04s: It's not a strategy.
175.84s: It's a lottery ticket.
176.68s: I've done it.
177.20s: I've won some but long term.
178.84s: It's self sabotage.
180.04s: Use defined risk trades and understand your probability of profit.
183.44s: I think this is completely fair.
187.08s: I really don't like like broad plotitudes like this like the never, but I completely agree
193.04s: with it in this context of never doing it with size.
196.72s: I think that's completely perfect as a concept to get across.
201.04s: Now this I don't agree with use defined risk trades.
204.84s: I think defining your risk if this is part of that, I think that makes a lot of sense.
209.76s: But typically when I read it in this context, I think of people that are saying either
213.24s: by options or use spreads because undefined risk strategies are some of my most profitable
219.76s: strategies.
220.76s: However, even in those undefined risk strategies to follow this point more thoroughly, you
227.12s: can define your own risk even if you're using an undefined risk strategy.
232.48s: So if they're meaning it in that sense, couldn't agree with that more because you can
235.60s: always define your risk before you enter your trade and you should.
239.72s: Next one, time is the most underrated killer.
242.64s: Thated K is relentless.
244.08s: Buying options means you're fighting the clock selling options on the other hand puts
247.24s: time on your side.
248.24s: Just make sure you're managing risk properly.
250.24s: Don't let a few sense of premium tempt you into naked calls on a short squeeze.
254.36s: Yes, I've been there.
255.36s: See, this is where like people's bias and still inexperienced comes through a little
262.52s: bit because they frame this as if buying options is more difficult because you're
269.72s: quote unquote fighting the clock as compared to selling options.
272.56s: And I wouldn't make that comparison because they're different things.
276.32s: And there's a lot of things you can do to decrease how much time is actually coming out
280.72s: of your option.
282.00s: If we come over to an option chain and we look at spy and we just loosely look at theta across
288.04s: different expressions, you can literally use something like this to get a good idea of what
293.20s: this looks like.
294.20s: So I'm going to do out of the money and I'm going to clean up the expiration cycles
298.68s: here and I'm just going to add one or two.
301.48s: Let's add one that's further out in time.
304.20s: So this is showing you your theta decay.
307.24s: The first thing that I want you to notice is that if you're at the money, notice how it dips,
312.44s: that means you're high to your theta decay is higher.
315.48s: Notice how if you go far out of the money, your theta becomes much less.
321.04s: And notice how if you go further out in time your theta decay really decreases pretty significantly.
330.28s: So the point to drive home here is there's nothing wrong with theta decay.
335.00s: There's a reason why it exists.
337.52s: And just because there's theta decay doesn't mean that it's insufficient to buy options
344.08s: and the game is that much harder because here's the thing.
347.56s: If you're good at trading directionally, buying options is going to make you so much more
352.44s: money than selling options, it's not funny.
355.16s: So this comes down more so to what is the profit mechanism that you're trying to trade
359.48s: in what fits.
360.76s: I would highly encourage any options trader to not fall into the binary buyer cell,
368.56s: one is better than the other because they're not.
370.48s: They're literally just used for different things.
372.36s: So I fully agree with time is an underrated killer.
377.52s: I don't agree with the idea that selling is easier than buying because of fighting the
384.32s: clock quote unquote.
385.88s: It is everything to do with what your strategy is and what the profit mechanism is that
390.32s: you're trading.
391.32s: Next one earnings plays are coin flips, not edge.
395.12s: This I vehemently disagree with and it's funny because this is actually one of the most
400.08s: well studied aspects of options and the thing to consider here and I'm going to show you
408.84s: some research that actually goes into this in detail.
413.04s: They're talking about this from some sort of directional lens, which the funny thing is,
420.72s: even if you trade them directly, there's some really, really effective strategies to
426.00s: trading earnings directionally based on analyzing something like flow.
430.36s: So I was surprised for them to say this one outright, it looks like they probably have had
434.48s: some bad experiences with it themselves.
437.00s: I absolutely think that if you axe those out, you were missing such a great unrelated,
443.48s: uncorrelated return source that shouldn't be crossed out this way.
449.08s: So here's the thing.
450.52s: We know in general implied volatility is overstated relative to realized volatility.
455.32s: We also know that coming into earnings releases, it's a binary event.
458.84s: You're going to get some sort of information release that's going to massively change,
463.32s: depending on what kind of information is released, the perception of the stock,
466.76s: how people are positioning and so on.
468.28s: The reason why that's important is because it levels the playing field.
471.32s: It's more difficult to know and to price things really well because nobody really knows what's
476.76s: going to come out during them.
477.72s: That's what levels the playing field.
480.28s: So they're really not coin flips if you trade them effectively as a strategy.
486.36s: Now to that end, any one single earnings play is effectively a coin flip,
492.28s: because you don't know what's going to come out.
494.20s: But as a strategy, there are themes that we can measure quantify.
499.72s: I have a video that talks about trading earnings.
502.44s: If you remind me, I'll probably forget in the comments, I can link a video to it,
507.48s: but take this study for example.
510.04s: So this is on page 26 so we can get back to it quick.
513.56s: But you can check this one out.
514.76s: This is earnings announcements and options returns.
517.16s: You literally can just go to SSRN and look up earnings.
521.40s: And you'll come across all sorts of things.
523.88s: So in this study, which is peer reviewed, they came across that there are predictable
529.16s: pattern of returns around earnings.
532.20s: You can see different strategies that they use that actually average,
538.92s: decent returns over markets.
542.04s: So this is essentially playing the expansion leading into earnings, the contraction post earnings.
547.96s: You can absolutely trade both of these effects.
550.92s: I regularly do myself.
553.32s: So the main note here is that each individual earnings play is indeed a coin flip.
561.88s: But it's as if you have a 50 50 coin, but if you win, you get a dollar and a nickel.
569.08s: And if you lose, you lose a dollar.
572.04s: That's a better comparison.
574.12s: So in this case, the event itself absolutely is a coin flip.
578.28s: But you can build strategies around that coin flip based on other factors,
582.60s: including implied volatility, which we covered earlier,
585.08s: that actually leads to profitable approaches.
587.88s: Again, we can throw a link in the notes below if I forget.
591.16s: Remind me in the comments.
592.68s: Next one, always playing your exit before entry.
595.32s: Literally, completely accurate.
597.32s: There should never be a case where this is not done.
600.20s: So regardless of where you choose to get out by having a defined plan before you enter the trade
609.64s: is always going to be better for you long term than trying to figure it out as you go.
615.32s: This, I completely agree.
618.12s: This says, obstetrating is in about genius level predictions,
621.08s: complicated Greek spreadsheets.
622.60s: Well, this, I don't know.
623.64s: I think that there might be an element of understanding the Greeks and impacts,
627.80s: especially if you take it to a professional level, because making it sound like complicated Greek
633.00s: spreadsheets, it's really not that complicated.
635.56s: But this is the main point.
637.32s: It's not really about genius level predictions, completely agree.
640.76s: And I do think it's about discipline.
642.76s: I do think it's about risk management.
644.76s: And I do think it's about knowing what you're betting on.
646.76s: I think that these are all completely fair.
649.64s: And this is a great point.
651.16s: The sooner that you take it seriously instead of a hobby,
653.40s: the sooner you stand a chance to start making money.
656.68s: But this comes with investing the time and effort to understanding what they are
661.40s: and actually building the seemingly complicated Greek spreadsheets.
665.32s: Because, again, they're not that complicated and you can learn a lot from them,
669.08s: even through the exercise of building it.
671.00s: So overall, I think this is a great post.
672.84s: I think there's a couple things that I would approach slightly differently.
677.24s: One of those being not falling into one camp buying or selling,
681.80s: because if one was clearly better than the other, the other side wouldn't exist.
685.88s: And they each have their use case from my own anecdotal experience.
689.48s: Ernings plays each individual event I absolutely would consider it a coin flip,
693.96s: but you can build a strategy that has edge around that coin flip.
698.36s: And I think that planning your exit before entry always makes sense.
702.44s: Same thing with never-yelling with too much size,
706.52s: or not taking the time to understand what you're trading.
709.08s: Really good post.
709.96s: If there's anything you would add to this, let me know in the comments.
712.36s: Be an outlier.
713.00s: See you all later.
