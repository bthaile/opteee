0.00s: I hate videos like this because I'm going to be punching holes in one of the most common
5.00s: option strategies for new and small traders.
9.00s: This can disenfranchise people from trading, which is not my objective.
12.88s: However, above all, my commitment to you all is investing without the bullshit.
18.04s: So contrary to all the YouTube searches that you'll find, if you throw in this strategy,
23.56s: you're going to see tons of people talking about free money, monthly income, make a lot
27.56s: of money on a little money.
28.56s: It's all that kind of nonsense.
30.56s: And it's just not how this works.
32.24s: What strategy are we talking about today?
34.28s: It's going to be vertical credit spreads.
36.44s: This can be vertical spreads in general, but I'm specifically talking about vertical credit
40.76s: spreads here.
41.76s: And I'm going to walk us through five things.
43.72s: Quick recap on what they are, the structure itself, pros, cons, then I'm going to talk
48.08s: about the big problem specifically.
49.96s: And at the end of the video, the fifth thing is I want to give you some alternatives.
53.16s: I'm not just going to leave you high and dry, talk about all the problems with this, and
57.44s: then leave you nothing to go off of.
60.16s: But there's probably a lot of stuff in here.
62.24s: People don't really understand when they're trading something like this.
65.04s: And that's my hope to share information with you also that you can make informed decisions.
69.28s: So we're going to see whether or not you can handle the truth.
72.68s: You can't handle the truth.
74.96s: So what's up everybody?
76.48s: Eric here.
77.48s: Welcome back to all the outliers in a specific shout out to the Patreon family.
80.44s: You guys make content like this possible for everybody.
82.88s: And you guys also are the one that pay my video editor.
85.68s: So he thanks you.
86.92s: And if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing up so that we can make better and
90.88s: better information and content for people.
93.68s: All right, let's get straight to it.
95.80s: Quick recap on what vertical credit spreads look like.
99.36s: And this is a put credit spread here.
101.92s: What you'll notice is that this is going to be a short option that is closer to the money
107.56s: along option that is a little further out of the money.
111.60s: They're going to be the same expiration, the same type, meaning both will be calls or
116.16s: puts.
117.16s: And then there will be the same number of longs and shorts.
120.44s: So this specific example here is looking at a spy put credit spread.
126.20s: You'll also hear them refer to as bowl put spreads stuff like that.
130.92s: I really stick to put credit spreads or put credit vertical spread, put credit spreads
137.16s: to me is easier.
138.16s: So I'm going to refer to it as that.
139.72s: So in this case, we are going to be selling to open one 29 December 448 put at $3.25.
147.12s: This is a 30 delta option.
148.52s: Then we're going to buy to open the 29 December 447 put for $3.2.
153.72s: This is a 28 delta option.
155.80s: And the net credit here is 23 bucks.
158.64s: That's what we're going to take in.
159.96s: These are the payoff diagrams for the individual options in case you forgot what these look
164.20s: like.
165.20s: This is going to be the underlying price.
168.00s: This is the PNL.
169.68s: As always, the short naked put is going to have unlimited downside.
174.48s: That's a big problem.
175.48s: That's why people like to trade these because when you combine them, this is what your
178.96s: payoff diagram looks like.
180.44s: And it's pretty cool.
181.44s: You, well, I'm not sure how I did that, but we got it back because in this kind of strategy
186.36s: you're going to have defined both profit and losses.
190.60s: So that kind of gives us a prelude into the attractiveness of the strategy.
194.68s: The very first thing is you'll notice is that it is risk defined.
198.48s: So as we reference this trade that we were just looking at, when we think about what
202.70s: you can lose, in this case, if you're collecting $23 upfront, the most you can lose is $77.
208.48s: And you know that right out of the gate.
210.24s: That is a great quality, especially for new traders because not blowing up is probably
217.16s: the primary priority for new traders in my opinion.
220.76s: The other thing in this case is they're very cheap.
223.16s: So the margin for this trade is literally your max loss.
227.96s: So in this case, it's $77 in this trade.
231.40s: They're very high probability trades.
233.64s: This one specifically is a 72% chance, probability of profit, which is great.
238.56s: And they're efficient.
240.24s: If you make your max profit here, which is $23, that would be a 29.9% return on invested
246.52s: capital.
247.52s: If you annualize that, it's really, really good in terms of efficiency.
252.40s: Now, let's talk about some of the primary issues before we get into the big one.
257.28s: This is a low gross returning strategy.
260.72s: In this case, for a dollar wide vertical, you're making $23.
265.32s: That's not that much money.
267.16s: It also has more friction because there are multiple legs.
272.60s: If you think about your commissions, let's say you pay 65 cents per leg.
277.44s: That means on the way in, you are paying a dollar 30.
281.12s: For those that don't realize how massive that is on a $23 potential return, that's 5.7%
290.52s: of your max profit gone just on the entry.
293.44s: That doesn't include the exit.
295.04s: And this also doesn't include the slippage that you are inevitably going to pay because
299.16s: of the spreads.
300.16s: So they're very expensive for what they are.
302.72s: They also have a contradictory thesis in my opinion, or they're just inefficient in
307.36s: their expression.
308.36s: So what I mean by that is sometimes you'll hear, oh, if IV is high, then you sell credit
313.68s: spreads.
314.68s: Well, aren't you buying the exact thing you were saying is too expensive?
319.32s: It kind of doesn't make sense.
320.68s: And more important than that, they're not the most efficient way to capture these different
324.92s: kinds of expressions.
326.40s: So we'll talk a little bit about that later.
328.36s: And the other thing, you are risking relatively a much larger sum of money to make a much
334.90s: smaller amount of money.
336.60s: This is exactly why they tend to be high probability strategies.
340.04s: So that leads us now into what the big problem here and it's negative expectation.
346.44s: So this is running a back test from 2015 to today, which is the middle of November of
354.24s: 2023.
355.40s: And it's looking at $1 wide options.
358.32s: This does not include cost of commissions.
361.88s: And you can see that total strategy PNL is negative $142.
366.04s: It's just looking at one loss.
367.96s: You lose money.
368.96s: That's what this comes down to.
370.36s: This is not even including fees, which I was just explaining to you are really, really
374.64s: bad.
375.64s: So what's going on here?
376.92s: Well, if we take a look at that previous example that I was showing you and we get back
382.16s: to $1 wide, where you're collecting $0.23.
385.88s: In this case, right out of the gate, you have a negatively expectant strategy.
392.12s: The reason being is because the neutral credit, this means again, sans fees, not including
397.40s: fees, the neutral credit you would have to receive for this to have a 50, 50 probability
402.60s: a zero sum over the long run is 31 cents.
407.24s: You were collecting $0.23.
409.48s: You are nowhere near where you need to be in order to capture a neutral credit.
413.72s: This is using again, $1 wide, 35 days of expiration.
417.56s: So you might say, well, what about 3DTE?
420.08s: What if we go shorter term?
421.72s: Same thing.
422.72s: This is a dollar wide collecting 19 cents.
426.56s: The problem with most of these is that they are not going to be priced favorably to you.
432.36s: That's by design.
433.52s: So even if you look at wider spreads, let's say $5 wide, $10 wide, you're going to find
440.36s: the same thing.
441.36s: In general, you are not even going to be able to capture a neutral credit trade.
448.08s: Let alone something that has any sort of positive expectation baked into this.
453.16s: So what does that mean?
454.16s: Well, it means that you would have to get really, really good at trading directionally, right?
458.80s: Because this is a bullish strategy.
460.96s: In this case, when we're talking about the put credit spreads, if you're trading call
465.76s: credit spreads, it would be bearish.
467.68s: And in those instances, there are much better ways to express that hypothesis than these.
473.40s: So what is this all amount to?
475.52s: Death by a thousand paper cuts.
477.28s: You're not going to blow up on any one single trade, which is actually a great component
482.04s: to these.
483.04s: However, you're not really going to make any money on them as you're trading them, which
486.48s: is unfortunate because I came across them.
488.92s: They were touted as some sort of really great approach for small accounts.
493.48s: And then I was thinking, oh man, I'm winning a lot.
496.00s: This is great.
497.00s: When I started looking at the numbers in the long run, when I started taking this stuff
500.40s: more seriously, and I was just like, oh shit, I'm not doing anything here other than
505.40s: racking up commissions.
507.24s: So this is the big problem with them.
509.56s: They are deceptive.
510.92s: You will win a lot, very small amount of money each time.
514.12s: You are paying way too much in terms of the friction for commissions and even the spread
520.76s: because you have two likes that you're dealing with.
522.80s: So like I promised you, what are some of the alternatives?
526.84s: Well, if you're bullish, this is what I would do.
529.44s: The coverage triangle, ratio covered calls, ratio called diagonals, buying shares, you
534.48s: could even buy calls if you want.
537.04s: And I have videos that talk through literally all of these, which I will throw them in the
540.56s: notes below for you.
541.84s: They all have their drawbacks.
543.16s: A lot of these are more expensive.
545.44s: So you're going to have to pick products very carefully.
548.44s: They're not as efficient.
549.88s: You're not going to have as great return on invested capital.
552.60s: However, you can create better, expectant strategies using these structures.
558.84s: Now, looking if you're bearish, again, just a few ideas, you can trade ratio put diagonals,
564.00s: long puts, both of those are completely fine.
566.52s: Or if you're trading volatility out, right, aka, I want to capture variance risk premiums,
571.40s: you can trade short straddles, short strangles.
573.52s: I have videos in the notes below on those as well.
576.32s: And again, for any of these, if you have to buy the wings either to protect catastrophic
582.16s: loss, the idea here is to go much further out of the money so that you are not giving
587.64s: up as much of the credit you're receiving specifically for vertical credit spreads.
592.60s: Again, there's no free lunch here.
594.64s: That's the problem.
595.64s: That's the uncomfortable reality of trading options is just because vertical credit spreads
599.72s: are what are accessible to you.
601.84s: It doesn't mean they're good.
603.32s: There's a reason why you're not going to see a lot of pros trading these.
606.88s: And it's because of these reasons.
608.48s: They're inefficient.
609.48s: They really do not capture any sort of advantage from the broad market in terms of positive
615.88s: expectancy and the strategy.
617.12s: It is what it is, man.
618.12s: So you have to see whether or not you can reconcile that and make something of it.
622.20s: Again, this isn't to say that there's never a point where this could fit into account,
625.88s: but in general, it has nowhere in my portfolio.
633.84s: And after looking back at the amount of time I wasted trading them, that's truly what
637.84s: it was, absolute waste.
639.84s: So if there's anything I left out, let me know.
642.16s: If there's any questions you have on the video here, any of the specific strategies, throw
647.04s: them in the comments below.
648.04s: I answer all of them because I love interacting with you guys.
651.44s: Don't forget, be an outlier.
653.64s: Put in the work.
654.80s: You can absolutely make this stuff work.
657.24s: It's just going to take some effort.
658.92s: See you all later.
