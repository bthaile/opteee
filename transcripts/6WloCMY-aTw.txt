494.00s: you
504.00s: playing long-term price appreciation, but sometimes you don't want to deal with near-term
508.72s: price shocks. So more often than not, you will see those kinds of holders buying puts.
514.48s: It's a cost of doing business. It's a cost to take some risk off through the earnings
520.24s: release. The fact that you're seeing this much directional speculative volume in a large
525.28s: cap stock that typically exhibits the opposite behavior is a pretty strong indicator.
534.08s: I got to say, I agree with that. I agree with what that guy just said.
541.04s: And I was evaluating as if I was evaluating anybody else talking. That was actually kind of
546.08s: funny, but that's exactly correct. It sounds like something I would say. So the funny thing is,
552.48s: and the reason why I'm sharing that with you is because so far, take a look at what's happening
557.76s: in video. They're right now trading at 141 where they closed at 134. This is one of those instances
566.64s: where it's always a crap shoot. The last thing I want somebody to ever take away from a clip like
574.40s: that is like, oh, Eric knew this was going to happen. The fuck I did, I have no idea what's
582.56s: going to happen. I have no idea what I'm going to have for dinner, let alone what a stock is going
588.40s: to do. I have no idea, but I'm the worst guy to have an idea. But what I can do is look for clues
596.64s: on probabilistic outcomes and make a guess. That's effectively what that is. That's not me knowing
604.08s: what's going to happen. Nobody knows. However, I can look at different things, different analytical
612.32s: inputs. Then I can arrive at something that's like, hmm, it seems like X scenario is more probable
621.20s: than Y scenario. Then my job as a degenerate trader is to trade my half-baked idea. That's
629.60s: effectively what this game is. Now, joking aside, the main thing that I really do want to drive
635.20s: home from that is that seriously. Nobody knows. Whenever you get people that make a call and then they
642.00s: go back and they say, oh, yeah, I knew that was going to happen. Fuck that person. It's bullshit.
647.20s: They don't know. Nobody knows. That doesn't mean that you can't say, I think X is more likely than
654.72s: Y and it's a tradable event for whatever reason. There's a fine difference between those.
662.40s: When I look at this coming earnings release, this is what I expected to see. This is not anything
671.44s: that I knew to be the case. A big part of that absolutely comes down to literally that exact
678.08s: point. It really is worth reiterating. It's like, it's very pertinent here. Most of the time when
684.64s: big large cap stocks that are widely held go through an earnings cycle, they more often than not
691.12s: will see put side hedging. It's simply because those people are not looking to speculate on
697.36s: direction through earnings. They just don't want to have a ton of risk through earnings.
702.32s: To see that much directional positioning is quite telling. Among other things, that was just a clip
709.76s: of the pro stream that we did yesterday where we go in a little bit more in detail on stuff like this.
715.60s: We go on and look at the other earnings and stuff like that. None of that matters.
719.52s: The main thing that I thought was interesting is that the options markets did give us some ideas
725.52s: as to what this could look like. Far, it does look like they're having a pretty solid earnings.
732.80s: Now, the other thing to pay attention to is who knows where this is going to open tomorrow.
737.44s: That's a whole other bag. Right? Right now it's trading down at 140, 84. It's already
743.84s: trickling down a little bit. There's nothing that says that this can't run down more. Who knows?
748.72s: No idea. But anyways, let's see what they're talking about. That's the last person I want to watch.
756.08s: To be honest with you, I just want to see like an overview of here. We can start with this.
767.52s: Business booming. We know that they reported 44 Billy in revenue for its fiscal quarter.
775.84s: Yo, when you have companies that are out here just reporting billions over quarters,
782.64s: we are firmly in monopoly money. Like this is all fake. That's an insane.
789.52s: Could you imagine? What is the visual of that amount of money? I'm going to ask, we need a
794.56s: comparison. Give me a reference visual for 44 billion dollars in 100 dollar bills.
808.56s: Just visually how many trucks it would take up?
811.68s: There we go. So 44 billion is
824.32s: 440 pallets, which is essentially an entire warehouse.
832.40s: That's a pretty good one. Pallets is decent. I don't know that that many people would like
836.40s: refer to pallets. But I feel like most people know what a fucking palette looks like. So
840.96s: 440 of those bastards. That's just a ton of money. Okay. Let's see includes chips, other
849.92s: components, a computing system. Yes, yes, revenue up 73% your your markets happy.
856.64s: Futures are up. I actually am long futures right now. And that's literally just because
864.88s: the my near term expectation is that we will see this kind of bleed through. Like I absolutely
874.00s: think we'll continue to see this kind of bleed through from the from the news. So yeah, that
880.32s: absolutely I think is likely to continue at least for a little bit. Now there's a breadth of
886.96s: data, by the way, that can analyze the frequency of reversals of big earnings beats and stuff
893.68s: like that. But this does look poised for post earnings announcement drift, even though that
898.08s: typically doesn't impact large cap stocks quite as much anymore. Something like this probably
903.44s: something to keep an eyeball on. Let's see what else anything else sticks out to us.
909.04s: Okay, the data center business includes chips and other components using AI computing system
914.32s: revenues surge 73% your over year to 39.1 billion just below the 39.36 billion expected by analysts.
921.92s: So this is really interesting because this is still a slight miss technically right they
930.80s: were expecting even more aggressive metrics. So that's actually kind of interesting that it's
935.44s: still reacting this this nicely. Dark Mark says another way to help wrap our heads around the
940.16s: difference between million and billion is oh, I've heard this put in time before. One million
945.12s: seconds is 11 days one billion seconds is 31 years. I've heard that one before as a really
950.80s: great way. And I think that's an even better comparison than pallets. So now we need to know what 44
960.32s: 44 billion seconds is in years. I'm gonna multiply that by 44 we're all dead and then some that's
968.16s: much certified fine. What are these little crowns y'all have? What the fuck does that mean?
974.32s: I've not seen those before those are cool. Certified finance says why don't you sell credit
982.40s: spreads? That's a great question. It's not that I don't it's that I rarely do and it's because
992.24s: when we look at a vertical spread they tend to cannibalize themselves. I mean that's really the
998.16s: whole point of a vertical spread is to decrease the total risk in the trade both felt by the Greeks
1006.08s: but as part of that decreasing of risk you are decreasing opportunity. So I think I think a few
1017.84s: things but I think there's a time and place for them in general it's not part of what I do.
1024.56s: There are absolutely instances where it is part of what I do specifically through things that
1029.68s: are like earnings releases and I'm trading a short strangle in tech and tech can fly. So in stuff
1038.16s: like that I'll add a cap I'll add a wing to the call side I typically wouldn't do it on the
1043.68s: put side I just take the risk. So the short answer is a lot of times you give up too much to take
1051.36s: the risk off and our job as traders is to take risk it's how we make money. So it's mostly for
1058.00s: those reasons and again it's nothing that I would say like I don't do them I pretty much avoid
1064.96s: those kinds of platitudes but I definitely rarely do them has to be a very specific use case
1071.44s: for them because otherwise you're given up too much at least in my opinion it's a good question.
1077.28s: Lauren says you can't get a copyright on your own video that's solid that's good to know I'm
1081.12s: still waiting fucking YouTube probably turn my shit down. Ricky says Eric can read the future see
1086.64s: that's the shit that I'm talking about I cannot neither can anybody else I literally still don't
1092.24s: even know what I'm having for dinner tonight let alone what anything else is going to happen is crazy.
1100.72s: Lauren says she that she Google how to turn it off it was distracting her that's kind of
1105.20s: what I didn't even know that you could turn it on if there is a way for me to force turn it on for
1109.44s: you again I would have done that because it's kind of fun. Ricky says market seems like it's
1114.08s: looking for reasons to recover funny how last earnings beat expectations as well but it sold off
1119.20s: ah but very very different and that is a really important differentiation because when we're talking
1128.00s: about earnings this is a perfect time for a handy dandy Eric original in case you guys are
1136.16s: interested I'll you know start turning these into NFTs because are those still a thing do people
1141.20s: do NFTs though because these are clearly just gold drawings and it wouldn't surprise me if somebody
1147.52s: was like yo I need that on my wall I don't blame you I might feel that way too so if we're talking
1154.16s: about earnings we have two big differences
1166.24s: a big part of earnings is rehashing what happened in the past it's looking at things like sales
1182.64s: revenue all these kinds of things right all the fundamentals of stuff and as you can see
1190.88s: they are pretty damn good at forecasting what stuff is going to be especially for highly traded names
1201.60s: there's way too much information continuously available that allows pretty damn good estimates to be made
1211.60s: so you can see that they were expected year over year to 39 39.36 they came in at 39.1
1219.52s: that's year over year that's a long time frame to make that kind of guess and they were damn close
1227.28s: so when we're talking about past effects this is kind of just like recounting what happened
1235.28s: and a lot of this stuff is way more the case of as long as it's pretty close or around what we
1241.20s: thought it should be then it passes if it's something let's say for example that revenue
1246.88s: fell it didn't gross fast as expected for some sort of thing then all of a sudden then that
1252.32s: doesn't pass that creates a problem now the larger component that's more important during an
1259.12s: earnings release barring these kinds of big changes based off of expectations is forward guidance
1266.80s: this is where we're actually getting a first look at how the company is expecting things to happen
1277.60s: in the future which this is net new information this is stuff that we don't know we can guess what
1285.52s: forward guidance might look like but that's way more of a crap shoot than tracking things like sales
1291.52s: revenue buying of new warehouses all that kind of stuff so the reason why in the last earnings
1299.52s: release and this isn't specific to Nvidia this is in general the reason why you'll see that kind
1304.72s: of behavior is not because EPS or some sort of financial metric doesn't necessarily you know scratch
1312.24s: the itch but a lot of it has to do with the forward guidance and what is captured in that forward
1318.96s: guidance and if we go back to the end of February of this year and we think about what that forward
1326.00s: guidance looked like you know all this tariff ship was going on stuff that directly impacts
1334.40s: in video is going on and Nvidia is absolutely super susceptible to supply chain shocks in that way
1345.52s: they're not like some of these other companies that have actually pivoted really heavily
1350.24s: away from some of the primary places that would be targeted so that's a big big difference
1355.60s: and it's a good observation it's a really good observation but the context of those two windows
1360.56s: is super important for us to to acknowledge and understand one more making the comparison
1366.72s: all right let's see what else came out here net income 1988 9 billion up 31 percent
1377.76s: the announced that new rules from the Trump administration no longer allow the chips to be exported
1383.20s: to China like that kind of thing absolutely impact stuff adjusted earnings diluted don't care
1390.64s: okay so for the current quarter and video projected revenue 45 billion up or down to percent
1396.08s: inless view was 45.92 it includes 8 billion in loss revenue due to the H2O ban which again
1406.16s: that's going to be baked into the price yeah
1412.08s: so I mean overall this looks like a just a pretty solid earnings release
1417.44s: that's what I'm seeing let's see let's see what this guy says
1431.60s: by almost 4 percent about 30 minutes into the conference called sascohanna senior analyst
1435.68s: Chris Rowland is here to give his reaction to the results Chris great to have you with us
1439.68s: and I'm just reading through some of the the comments that are coming across right now
1442.96s: specifically about the China market which of course is a big part of Nvidia's quarter here
1447.76s: the CFO saying the company is still evaluating limited options to serve the Chinese market
1452.16s: and losing access to the Chinese market of material adverse impact on Nvidia's business
1457.28s: how should we view if the tariff that if the export controls remain in place how should we view
1463.04s: the China market and what it will be to Nvidia in a couple years yeah so I think the big revelation
1470.96s: about Q2 is that they were planning on shipping 8 billion probably almost twice as much as we were
1479.12s: anticipating they would actually ship you know this guy told so China in the second quarter
1484.88s: so this was turning out to be a very large blockbuster product for them it is sorry can't
1492.64s: can't do it and there's no way for me to speed them up I fucking hate stuff like this where I'm
1497.28s: just trying to synthesize information just talk fast so I can get the information faster that's
1501.60s: so damn slow okay so let's see anything else that sticks out to us here did it it a roller coaster
1509.04s: yep yep yep yep so literally this dude was just talking about the longer term outlook in China
1515.84s: okay so let's talk about tariffs for a second and what this is likely to look like it going forward
1521.68s: a big part of this is a big part of this is trying to synthesize and war game what's happening
1532.08s: broader and what the conversations are and why they are what they are without going super deep
1539.04s: into detail on all that stuff we can if you would like but without diving straight into that
1545.20s: I think the safest assumption here is that the way tariffs have been going are likely to be the
1554.40s: way that they will continue to go so what that means is a lot of conversations and a lot of
1561.92s: reconciliation about finding ways to avoid these really large tariffs on everything and a big
1568.48s: reason for that is because the tariffs literally negatively impact literally everyone so because
1576.72s: of that there's not like some sort of massive incentive to keep them in place so when Nvidia is
1582.72s: trying to forecast its future business it does have to take that stuff into account but again
1588.24s: is a as a betting man which I am as a trader I have to assume that and it seems like the market
1596.32s: supports this assumption that we're going to continue seeing tariffs going the way that they've
1601.36s: been until there's a material change which at some point there could be but right now Nvidia is
1608.64s: back up to 141 the options market looked really actually aggressive today and again this is some
1617.12s: follow up from what we saw yesterday but I still think it's worth talking about because
1623.68s: this kind of positioning is noteworthy so we saw this bullish call positioning yesterday
1631.84s: and then towards the close today which is really important you can see a bunch of the call
1638.88s: buying activity which is speculative positioning and then you can see put buying activity going up
1645.68s: that put buying activity is mostly people hedging they don't want to overpay they don't want to
1650.72s: grab the put super early because you don't need to but you want to just cover the risk for the
1656.72s: event itself and this represents more so of those longer term holders of the equity that don't
1662.64s: really want to take a bet on earnings that I've referred to previously then that's a completely
1667.68s: different group than the people that are speculating to the upside that we absolutely saw come through
1673.44s: in force so Nvidia earnings here looks pretty solid so far full expectation is that the market will
1680.72s: like that tomorrow now let's take a quick look at Tesla
1691.52s: and Tesla is in a little bit of a different boat here
1697.52s: Tesla has almost near schizophrenic positioning with options going on and it's been
1709.76s: absolutely insane insane stock to watch so a couple notes here is where we're seeing this activity
1720.96s: which will take a look in a second where the current OI is but then also the way that the stock
1726.96s: is behaving because just like Nvidia when Nvidia first had this larger sell off one of my broader
1734.96s: ideas that I share with people is that especially for long term investors this was all a gift
1740.96s: it really is because the periodicity that you're going to see companies like this at these levels
1746.48s: going forward in my opinion would be love and the reason is especially something like Nvidia that's
1752.88s: going to be at the epicenter of AI adoption they have a completely new untapped growth source
1760.16s: that is going to literally fuel them for some time hold on I just got a breaking thing for Trump
1765.68s: what do you say you never know what this dude is going to say so
1776.40s: um oh this doesn't look like anything
1786.96s: yeah okay does this anything and for those that don't know there's also the current court
1795.76s: ruling regarding the tariffs from Trump which I was waiting to see how long it was going to take
1802.80s: for the courts to get involved let's see if we can find an article on that uh court ruling Trump
1811.60s: tariffs
1826.08s: so let's see let's see
1830.64s: um we'll start here
1836.32s: that record Wednesday blocked the sweeping tariffs under the emergency powers law
1844.32s: okay the ruling from a three judge panel at the New York base court of international trade
1850.48s: came after several lawsuits are you being Trump exceeded his authority
1854.48s: from repeatedly said the tariffs would force manufacturers bring on shore yeah yeah
1859.36s: um
1864.24s: but for now Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact so this will be kind of interesting
1871.52s: the ruling mounted to a categorical rejection of legal underpinnings is some signature most
1875.76s: controversial actions supreme court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer
1883.28s: but it casts a sharp blow which is completely correct uh tariffs must be typically approved by
1891.36s: Congress said he is the power to act to address the deficits he calls national emergency
1896.00s: they you'll notice that they do a lot of this BT Dubs not just Trump any president they'll do the
1901.20s: national emergency thing which just allows them to circumvent some normal normal processes that
1907.20s: it's one of the cool things about just the American process in general is I actually like
1914.56s: again completely disparate and detached from the tariffs the way they're going all that kind of
1920.56s: shit I just like the fact that there's another body out there that can at least step in and say
1926.48s: let's take another look at this I don't know if we agree with it I like that I think that's a good
1931.04s: thing um
1936.64s: dozen states filed suit led by Oregon which makes sense because I mean especially like this here
1943.84s: including why wine wine importer boss selections owners says tariffs have major impact the company
1949.52s: might survive like that that's a really pertinent point especially for companies that aren't as
1954.96s: inflation resistance and I know that might be like well tariffs inflation was I have to do
1959.60s: with stuff I'm just talking about prices in general just general price inflation and there are a
1965.68s: lot of places that don't have the same capacity to tolerate it so yeah I think that's that's a
1972.48s: hilarious picture by the way I love it when you can always tell like what a news agency when they
1977.92s: like or don't like someone because they'll do shit like this so my guess is CMBC I don't know
1983.76s: what certainty but my guess is CMBC not a big fan this is a hilarious picture um
1991.84s: yeah okay so same same so that's another thing that you're seeing baked into the futures here
1997.12s: beyond the tech earnings because believe or not Nvidia earnings is a massive part of this
2002.64s: that has a huge say in what the market does Nvidia is such a massive company all right so let's
2008.48s: get back to Tesla though
2014.72s: and we have a scratching thing at the door
2033.36s: all right all right
2036.32s: we have our news analyst what do you have to say to the people
2044.00s: okay I don't know if you guys are catching all that he does like to talk fast
2049.60s: you are getting a little bit of a sniff what do you think of this
2055.92s: he seems to like it
2056.96s: he seems to like the mic too okay so now that we got our analyst locked in
2068.88s: let's get back looking at Tesla so Tesla here has had an absolutely wild move it continues to be
2079.76s: a crazy source of vault trading actually believe it or not there's a ton to do in Tesla
2087.68s: and even with the moves that you see it does continue to provide really solid risk premiums
2095.20s: because just the overall volume here is so high right now raw vol is 71.76
2104.80s: which still places implied volatility percentile at 71 this is also a really really great reminder
2111.36s: of the difference between implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank
2116.16s: if you're using implied volatility rank that would currently lead you to believe that vol is low
2123.12s: vol is objectively not low vol is actually quite high so the reason for that is because
2135.12s: the way that these two are calculated makes a big difference and I actually have a video
2142.72s: that discusses the difference between implied volatility percentile and rank and why they're different
2149.68s: but anyways Thor leave that alone you freak you literally just asked to come in here and then he
2154.72s: goes over to the door and he's like stuffing his nose under the door snorting the dudes of crackhead
2160.88s: so let's take a look at what's happening in here
2170.56s: still long
2176.08s: still long call volume compared to put let's take a look what I'm most interested in is actually
2183.04s: how this breaks out and let's take a look here
2203.36s: so all I'm doing is eyeballing premiums which is still very call heavy really call heavy
2213.84s: and this is all the out into 2027 so really really call heavy which
2224.40s: I mean I dig it
2231.60s: huge huge putt build out at the 395
2236.16s: and it looks like a pretty short position being built here in June
2254.88s: okay
2255.36s: um and we want
2267.76s: here
2273.28s: oh interesting it's actually kind of mellowing out
2276.48s: overall volume is actually slowing down
2285.52s: not sure I would have taken it for that
2298.80s: and I mean there's still pretty large
2301.52s: trading activity
2313.36s: pretty curious so from a general positioning standpoint right now it looks like there's
2319.84s: a bit of a short pocket in the near term for Tesla but then longer term still very very much
2326.08s: bullish still very much bullish skew bullish skew is as far as I could tell
2334.64s: still generally ranked on the buy side this I have to be honest I don't think it matters
2340.80s: in insane amount it do like to pay attention to it but yeah I like I don't think that this is the
2349.12s: the end all be all I do like to see simply because it can give us a sense of what the market
2355.28s: is generally expecting but it's mixed near term definitely looks to be a little more bearish
2365.76s: and then longer term looks to be a little bit more um a little bit more bullish that's what I see
2379.28s: if we take a look at total ally
2385.44s: so big expansion here
2398.24s: and most of the ally
2403.68s: I mean the majority as far as changes let's take a look at total ally
2415.12s: still centered in the front so people are really playing the the front end of this
2424.16s: which stuff like this again you you pretty much see that all the time with more volatile names
2430.72s: the risk premiums in here have been insane so this reminds me of a trade that I recently reviewed
2437.68s: with the with the pro folks good old prta so this one was one I forgot exactly when I entered
2444.96s: but this was just short puts and it literally moved against me almost 40% and despite a 40%
2452.08s: move against me the trade was still profitable from the change in fall so when we look at Tesla
2468.56s: it still maintains really aggressive risk premiums even though on average we've been getting
2477.36s: larger moves than expected last thing I want to take a look at here is a term structure
2486.32s: let's see
2505.68s: so
2506.24s: so
2513.28s: there's a bit of a peak that's kind of interesting because this is obviously
2522.16s: wildly low relative 23 days
2536.40s: what expiration is the 815
2544.96s: okay wow
2552.72s: that is low
2561.28s: that's real low
2566.56s: so like this inversion is abnormal
2573.60s: and then the tail side
2581.60s: still heavier on the on the tails for the put side but not tremendously so
2587.84s: okay
2593.84s: synopsis what do we see in general looks like near term downside expectation longer term
2599.92s: bullish expectation kind of the the gist okay and the last thing I wanted to take a look at before
2607.28s: I open it up to whatever you want to look at so if there's specific stocks questions anything you
2611.52s: want to talk about please start throwing in the chat now is the perfect time to start throwing
2618.00s: that stuff in but I want to talk about this two things so for game stop we saw a couple really
2626.72s: interesting things that as always I think game stop is a great general learning vector for markets
2637.28s: and it is everything to do with the way that game stop behaves some of what it shows us and some
2642.48s: of the anomalies that it also exhibits so one of the things that I'm noticing here is it obviously
2651.92s: recently announced its conclusion of what was it 500 million so it did not use the total capital
2662.72s: it had allocated yet to purchase Bitcoin but it is absolutely building out its Bitcoin position
2670.96s: now this big of a sell off is a little bit heavy but it does seem like the pricing for the Bitcoin
2680.40s: transactions doesn't really look ideal so here you go you can see the the
2692.48s: recent release it I want to get the right number of how much it was so it bought 4710
2703.36s: which it released obviously that that message today and the interesting thing about this is like
2713.36s: not like top-ticking but it's definitely not getting Bitcoin at a discount
2719.28s: like this is pretty damn high so the guess would obviously have to be that it was being phased
2728.72s: in over the you know the last month or two I think the way that logically would flow so they really
2736.96s: got in like pretty high and I am pleased to see that they didn't over expose themselves with Bitcoin
2750.32s: price where it is right now that actually makes me happy and they've obviously given themselves
2756.08s: a little bit of room to maneuver here which I think is really really important at this point
2764.16s: and a big part of that is to give them just a little bit more flexibility I think by them having
2773.60s: more flexibility with their positioning it gives them just a better opportunity to take advantage
2780.88s: of things as they're moving along uh Jonathan says does the documents say exactly when no it doesn't
2788.64s: say when we could take a look at the statement itself we'll see it in a little bit
2795.52s: when they actually report but game stop Bitcoin investment who's right now everybody's trying to
2803.20s: figure out how much they got it for let's see what this says this says 513 mil oh it says it's
2810.96s: worth 513 million right and that is a purposeful framing because they don't know what the actual
2819.28s: basis is so we'll see when earnings comes acquired 4710 let me see what the filing is let's see a bit
2833.52s: coin uh gm e bit coin filing
2849.04s: yep there she goes
2855.36s: all of your questions answered in one spot
2859.36s: yeah so the it says he and says they spend under 513 mil which is under 10% cash reserves could
2873.20s: qualify for non material amount well it's again it's we don't we don't we don't know what they spend
2881.12s: and it's just because it's like what this is saying is that it's worth this amount right now based
2889.36s: on spot when this was written this doesn't mean that they got it at or below this it could have been
2894.40s: above this actually during that most recent peak like again the way that I would generally
2900.16s: speculate it is they probably built a position of 4710 likely over like a several week period versus
2911.20s: just uh you know in outright bulk by
2920.40s: but I think it's a what they got in my opinion it represents a good amount meaning
2926.88s: not a good amount in that like it's a lot I don't mean it that way I mean a good amount in terms
2933.68s: of like what this represents for game stop getting pretty good exposure but again not overexposing
2943.68s: it and it gives them still more room to play now again the the other thing is I'm not personally
2950.80s: super jazzed about them starting to load up on Bitcoin I don't think it's bad I don't think
2958.64s: there's anything wrong with it but they they still are a brick and mortar company so they still
2966.72s: need to do their their job and they still need to effectively continue doing what they're doing
2974.96s: so if I'm not mistaken there was a recent release with uh recent interview let me see
2982.40s: that I haven't seen yet
2991.28s: at the Bitcoin conference
3009.84s: all right so for this one I am going to keep the audio off because this one has a pretty high
3019.92s: probability of killing us and we'll just watch the close captions but we are going to have to go faster
3030.00s: okay
3045.52s: okay innovative corporate strategies pioneering from a dying business thrive in business this is cool
3052.48s: oh this is I'm gonna play the some of the audio existious looks cool
3056.64s: I like what he's saying the company was a piece of crap and losing a lot of money the company
3060.32s: um was under a lot of pressure moving from physical games to digital downloads so you have to cut
3064.96s: costs yeah the cut costs uh very aggressively and bring in physical discipline I mean that's
3072.64s: like literally so pertinent well let's see what he says
3076.00s: and we can speed this up more hopefully you guys can read fast because I can
3089.44s: um talks about the headwinds comfy being under pressure especially in the industry need to cut costs
3098.88s: why does it keep saying the same thing here we go we had to move from physical games to
3109.68s: down those costs under control shift the business from being so relying on games to collectibles
3116.88s: so that's actually a pretty big peak by the way the fact that they're talking about like a bigger
3123.68s: emphasis on collectibles because I think for a lot of us that actually seemed a little bit like a
3129.92s: side quest but this actually starts to make it look less like a side quest and way more like a primary
3142.40s: um a like primary focus for them which I think is actually highly relevant
3149.92s: big focus on trading cards grading
3159.20s: the company is profitable in the US gotten cost under control
3166.48s: can I speed this up more you can only go to two times
3172.24s: damn damn Daniel
3186.56s: I mean so far really nothing has been said which is a little frustrating because this is
3190.32s: like a really short interview I would much much much prefer to see like much better qualitative
3198.08s: input because effectively it's that we had to change the business these some of the things we did
3202.56s: which is good like those are good points but it's just so rare to hear from him that I would love to
3207.68s: get some substance so hopefully so now they're talking about the Bitcoin so he's saying that they
3215.92s: bought Bitcoin he's saying that they own 4710 here you go
3227.92s: ah smart this is a great way this is such a smart way to
3235.44s: frame it where he's essentially saying that he's not using it for direct speculation
3242.24s: but more for a hedge which I actually like this
3258.08s: talking about storage in direct comparison to gold which is interesting
3272.72s: and then he goes into asymmetric upside
3287.76s: here we go
3297.20s: so to no no surprise he essentially is saying we're not gonna we're not gonna say what we're doing
3305.20s: ahead of time as they typically don't
3314.00s: okay man damn it just feel like we could have got some better stuff out of that what a missed
3322.72s: opportunity damn it so the summary from that essentially confirms the presence of Bitcoin
3330.96s: it to me alludes to future purchase of Bitcoin likely because I think in general if they weren't
3338.72s: going to buy more likely would have said it right but they didn't so my guess is that just
3348.96s: gently alludes to the fact that they're probably gonna buy more um I would have loved to know more
3355.84s: about the broader integration strategy for Bitcoin because he is effectively framed it in two
3363.04s: things he framed it as a currency hedge and compared it against gold and then the second thing he
3371.36s: talked about was potential asymmetric upside but the way that you position for those two things
3376.72s: and the way that you manage the holding is actually quite different so I would have been like that
3381.28s: would have been a great follow up if possible but understanding limited time and you know it is
3388.40s: what it is that I'm sure the interviewer did did what he could but those are just some lingering
3392.96s: questions I would have following that now the other thing I wanted to talk really quick about with
3397.36s: GameStop before I just go to the chat for Q&A is we did see them confirm their earnings and
3403.52s: funny enough this is one of those names where we had a hint that something was off with respect to
3411.60s: when earnings was thought to have been versus when it actually was and we talked about it actually
3418.80s: a while ago and the options chain in terms of vol is pretty good at telling us where things are
3426.24s: expected to be so now we can see that the overall earning or the the options chain itself
3434.64s: has generally normalized at this point so I think we can effectively just apply standard options
3446.48s: trading and specifically earnings training trading analysis and as it gets closer it's just too far
3454.16s: out right now with it earnings at the 10th after the close so it'll be in the 13 June cycle here
3462.00s: cool all right so what do we got?
3465.52s: Ian says super curious about GameStop $4.5 million position the holder of the 530 36 calls
3475.92s: expiring in two days is still holding can you verify slash heavier thoughts yeah let's take a look
3480.64s: at it there's a couple things that have to be noted though is again we don't know and we don't know
3488.24s: that that's one person we we really and it's unfair to make the assumption that it is now it's okay
3498.40s: to you know speculate but it's a bit different and it's important to recognize those differences
3506.96s: so this 30 may 36 calls so the 36 calls huge purchasing actually
3525.28s: this is the change in OI so let's take a look yeah so same thing there
3536.16s: and it looks like it's across a few strikes
3548.00s: because we can see that the 30s the 30 may also have the 41s going the 40s the 46s so they
3558.24s: actually have a pretty big position across these and then the same thing with all the 30 mays here
3566.24s: with people selling out or closing out of 39s 32s 33s and 30s so this looks like just of a lot of
3577.68s: playing the front expiration
3585.76s: and if you take a look at the volume for the front expiration cycle the volume shows a pretty big
3592.16s: downside which is people closing stuff out
3599.60s: current premium is at 23.3 mil
3609.84s: well let's take a look at
3615.52s: the I want to take a look at that expiration cycle the 30 may
3622.48s: you
3631.60s: let's take a look at those let's find those 36s
3652.88s: you
3667.36s: what the fuck
3670.80s: oh let's just go into the I was curious if we could see any like sort of the the larger trades coming
3677.04s: through but not so much so let's go back into here and let's just go into the option chain itself
3685.04s: and let's take a look at
3691.44s: what is this thing? Tabs alt
3700.56s: all right let's find these 36s
3706.96s: so OIs at 37, 85, 8
3716.96s: so the position got built here
3722.64s: and that's where that 4.16 is talking about
3727.44s: and it looks like there's been some sell-off
3732.40s: and some of this sell-off absolutely represents larger
3737.12s: than what the buys look like so some of these would be net net outflows
3746.00s: and my guess here is that you'll probably see those come alive a little bit soon because I mean that's just
3760.32s: the decent amount of money that's not looking great is what that boils down to the 36s
3772.00s: so they would have got smashed today on that news
3778.72s: literally trading for 24 25 cents at this point
3783.60s: whereas the average fill here was at a dollar two so right now their trade is just looking
3794.40s: their trade is looking awful they got absolutely smashed
3803.60s: yeah the ass-side was 42 853 so just assuming most of that is one person whatever it is or whatever
3811.92s: that entity is they just got smashed
3816.88s: so yeah that's a pretty big that's a pretty big rollover for them which sucks
3824.40s: okay
3831.12s: Joseph, what up Joseph Joseph says must on attention deficit and Mr. Market reaction to his CEO
3838.56s: responsibility and that of his political attention yeah that one's interesting because
3845.20s: the market the market is very very interested in how Elon is spending his time I think that's
3852.80s: actually more of a talking point than anything else and a lot of that has to do with the fact that
3860.48s: Tesla itself is still broadly doing fine right like on a longer term time frame Tesla is still
3868.00s: completely healthy here so I think that's become a bit of a talking point actually to try and get
3876.40s: people to be concerned about Elon and how he's spending his time but he's always spent his time
3882.80s: on a million different things so people that try to make it as if like the stuff that he's spending
3888.88s: in doge is now directly coming out of just Tesla I actually think that's a pretty big mistake
3894.80s: because that time is going to be spent on a bunch of different things right he's in and runs a
3899.44s: lot of different companies so my guess more so is that it's something that's generally spread
3904.40s: load so yeah I think it's more of a talking point than anything that the company itself still
3910.96s: continues to do well and I actually think the company is insanely well positioned longer term
3916.08s: especially for things like advanced robotics probably being the first actual full self driving
3923.92s: car that's mainly adopted that kind of stuff and then the second from Joseph is GameStop Bitcoin
3933.04s: as well as SBET and ETH that sentiment gaming and digital assets they don't follow that one
3945.12s: I don't follow that one Lauren says you see the RC interview today oh that's funny yeah so
3950.56s: so there we are
3955.60s: um Joseph says also Kim F F I E let's see
3961.84s: are you ready
3975.76s: are you looking at the right thing are you referring to the reek here
3978.88s: I mean I assume this isn't it because this this ain't got shit going on
3998.32s: yeah assume this is not assume this is not the right thing let me try F F I E
4009.20s: if F I E has no options I remember notices
4017.12s: so not sure about those are Lauren says can you take a look at rocket lab for sure
4024.08s: or KLB
4024.96s: um
4033.12s: um
4035.92s: Joseph says I was just citing some dude I don't know I have no idea who that is but F F I E
4041.76s: doesn't have an option chain and that re has literally nothing going on so yeah I don't
4048.16s: think at least for the reek that we were able to Kim K I M there is nothing there
4052.72s: and then F F I E literally doesn't have options
4059.44s: um
4061.44s: okay back to rocket lab rocket lab rocket lab actually looks good with this break here I like this
4071.68s: so this is kind of through the next larger volume node that it was able to crack through which
4084.72s: I mean that's solid like that's a solid break above that so this generally looks like a pretty
4094.64s: decent recovery rally well at least what I would consider to be like a pretty decent recovery rally
4102.80s: um
4105.52s: give me one sec my robot
4110.00s: my robot is stuck one sec BRB
4124.80s: all right we good um so yeah this looks good let's take a look at the options chain and let's see
4139.84s: what's been going on all right start here I wish you could change the default on
4153.28s: that would be way better get this looks like people that positioned
4164.40s: pretty long calls but then it looks like a bunch of those are getting sold off it looks like this
4168.80s: is actually pretty short cycle looks like this has happened quite a few times actually
4176.32s: so this is pretty heavy unwind it looks like
4183.68s: um rickie says my robot is stuck oh I have like a little robot vacuum so it's it's doing the
4191.28s: lords work right now of vacuuming stuff uh Joseph says that dude is a legend gain 60 million on
4200.80s: 4x
4205.60s: yeah I have no idea I don't know anything about that dude um but yeah I mean like I said those two
4212.32s: names you know object like the first name Kim literally has less than 6000 total options
4220.64s: and then ffe literally doesn't have options so if there was a comment something about that for
4228.64s: um ffe with anything related to options there are no options so there's nothing
4235.44s: yeah there's nothing there might they might have just miss spoke or something maybe miss wrote
4239.68s: the ticker maybe you didn't read the right ticker or something I don't know but
4244.96s: oh Joseph says Kim keep in mind oh so then you are talking about ffe
4259.44s: what
4264.00s: I don't
4270.48s: I don't really don't see options
4276.64s: is it just is it an error with the platform?
4285.12s: no
4292.48s: yeah it's I am I'm confounded
4296.32s: yeah my guess is we're we're missing something here because like there yeah there literally
4303.52s: there's nothing
4306.16s: we got we got nada all right back to right alive
4316.24s: okay so near term we're seeing this cycle again of like buying calls selling them buying
4321.52s: I'm selling them so that's playing the the short term price movement I think that's pretty clear
4328.16s: let's take a look at
4333.20s: where we're seeing oh man look at that
4338.48s: I mean
4340.80s: overall pretty heavy callscue across strikes
4345.44s: with one peak at the seven puts
4351.76s: and from oh I pretty heavy
4358.40s: upside bias at least in terms of number of options let's take a look at premiums
4372.96s: upside upside upside
4374.24s: yeah
4381.44s: I mean overall it would be cool if there was a way to do like a composite total call versus put
4387.52s: premium let me see if there's a thing for that in here because that would be that's effectively
4392.48s: what I'm doing with my eyes there
4394.56s: usual whales have a view where you can see the
4404.32s: total all input premium based on why
4412.08s: because you can do it by expiration cycles but I wonder if there's a spot to do it all
4415.44s: one that I just don't know about
4421.20s: net premium
4426.88s: oh that's cool
4428.96s: where's that uh
4432.96s: show me where that's at
4435.44s: where is net premium
4440.24s: oh is it talking on that main graph that main graph isn't that's not it
4446.32s: you
4451.28s: let's see it there
4454.80s: not there
4458.48s: net flow
4466.24s: picker flow page
4476.24s: is it interval flow
4481.92s: net flow
4486.72s: oh here we go this is great
4496.56s: yeah cool this would be honestly really useful on that main page
4501.60s: they should do that
4505.44s: so let's see
4522.08s: interesting
4528.24s: now what I would have expected
4535.92s: I mean those are like really heavy
4538.72s: downside spikes
4542.00s: 1.3
4543.84s: and 254
4553.28s: that
4559.20s: huh I wouldn't have expected that
4566.16s: that's a little more aggressive than
4570.88s: I otherwise was seeing or killed be
4580.96s: let's take a look at
4582.72s: ball
4590.72s: kind of flat to the upside kind of really flat to the upside
4595.60s: and then let's just take a look at
4602.48s: altas
4610.48s: that's interesting
4613.04s: so
4613.76s: so
4621.28s: there's a pretty decent amount of
4626.48s: ball
4628.64s: coming through on like the
4632.48s: right out of the money calls but it still
4635.60s: puts you with respect to ball which we can see from that other
4639.76s: the difference that's interesting here is that the call
4642.80s: implied ball
4644.80s: is like very flat
4648.16s: I mean there's just not much of a difference here as you you have it's not
4651.92s: until you get like out pretty far that you start to see it which is kind of interesting
4656.48s: so
4657.92s: it to me it looks like
4660.96s: there's some pretty big short positions but in general
4665.12s: it looks like it's a little bit more bullish positioned
4668.32s: from like a technical perspective
