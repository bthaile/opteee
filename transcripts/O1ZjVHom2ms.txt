0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up everybody welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got Tom saws and off on one more time
6.88s:  It's been about a quarter since we spoke last welcome back great to have you awesome awesome
12.36s:  So Nvidia is now up to 720 today is the 21st of February anybody wondering what do you think about that?
21.88s:  I was hoping for a down a hundred so up up up what is it up where is it right now? I'm looking at my
27.56s:  I'm just 20
29.96s:  Yeah, 718 717
34.92s:  Well, you know, it's it's had a
37.24s:  Last couple days is going from about 745 down to 770. Let's say I'm down to 670 back to 720
44.76s:  I don't know. I don't think it's gonna hold this rally
47.86s:  I think it's I think it's grossly overvalued here, but let's say we'll see
52.96s:  Isn't that like the struggle of just permanent contrarian in that sense because you see things that start showing strength like this and who knows right like
62.28s:  What did you think of it out of curiosity when it was trading in like the high fives was that still like overvalued for your perception?
68.88s:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
70.88s:  I mean as a as kind of a you know a raw contrarian we don't
78.52s:  There's there's almost
81.40s:  Like it's impossible you're never gonna know where the top is especially on a runaway train or anything like that
86.12s:  So you're gonna pick a spot and at that spot you're gonna convince yourself that that is the spot the only thing you're gonna do to
92.64s:  To protect yourself is
94.96s:  You're gonna try to keep your size and check and you're not gonna add to the position if you're wrong
99.16s:  So like this stuff that I'm shorting there is mostly verticals
103.56s:  About well where we are right now probably you know
106.96s:  $60 below where the current market is come around
110.36s:  660 650 5 660 in that range so I was looking like on the dance floor this afternoon, but
116.80s:  You know not after this earnings now I got to get a pullback and you know roll forward by some time the whole deal
122.20s:  Now when you're looking at stuff like this is that one of the reasons why you would prefer to go with something like a vertical because
129.04s:  On the contrarian perspective you know you can get ran over and it's a kind of a simple way to control risk in there
135.04s:  Is that why you go with that strategy in this context only I I normally prefer to be naked on everything so my preference is you know always
144.12s:  I would say 85 plus percent of the time. I'm going to have a naked position on but in a situation like what's happened in some of these chip stocks
153.84s:  Especially in video I I don't I didn't like the risk reward of
159.08s:  The naked positions because I just couldn't control the upside skew when that thing was just a runaway train moving like
164.88s:  50 bucks a day, you know you could get
168.68s:  Vertical spreads were moving. Let's call it a nickel on a ten dollar move
172.48s:  So you had plenty of wiggle room. There was no there's no wiggle room on naked options none
177.92s:  You know so so I figured listen I don't know if they're gonna split this stock
181.56s:  I don't know what they're gonna do
182.48s:  But if you want to sell into this kind of a rally I think you have to do it via verticals
186.76s:  I normally a fan of fewer contracts
190.84s:  More naked risk, but in the case like this. I think you have to go the other way
194.56s:  More contracts and just tighter spreads. Yeah, it makes total sense. It's it's funny because I
200.88s:  Kind of actively speak out against verticals where I can but this is one of those contexts that I think it's a
206.92s:  There's no brainer now that leads me to a broader thematic and we're coming down to like 716
212.64s:  You might be all right, maybe it'll
214.16s:  Listen, I'm on the same page as you I'm not a fan of verticals like I I don't do a lot of iron condor
220.40s:  So I'll do some you know if I think the ball is really high or I also do iron condor sometimes which is just two verticals
226.60s:  I'll do iron condor sometimes when I feel like the stocks a little thin and I'll get a better fill if I you know
232.70s:  If the counter party doesn't have to spread off any risk
235.56s:  But I'll also do verticals and things like SMCI where the market's just too wide can't trade naked options, but
242.68s:  In Nvidia you can do anything you want. I was just worried about I mean
245.80s:  I really was just worried about you know
248.36s:  What happens on some kind of crazy, you know stupid zoom type move from a few years ago where you open up 200 points that kind of thing
255.20s:  You know it is so funny say that's the first thing
258.72s:  I'm thinking about when it comes to these kinds of moves was zoomed specifically now looking at
264.32s:  Tech it seems like tech still
267.20s:  Bell the ball they they're just running wild here the cues was massively last year and off to a great start this year
274.04s:  Yeah, we make it that is like what's happening? I mean
278.76s:  There's not much to make of it other than other than you know it
283.32s:  I
284.44s:  Think I think most
286.44s:  Profol I think all portfolios of all passive portfolios and all institutional portfolios are
292.24s:  grossly overweighted right now. They're highly concentrated. They're gross overweighted
297.04s:  I think they had a crap load of risk, you know an absolute shit load of risk today
302.32s:  In this Nvidia number because if you talk about the the biggest stocks out there
306.76s:  You talk about like Microsoft and Apple, you know and you're in your in your top two you know three trillion dollar companies
314.72s:  They don't have as much volatility as much earnings risk
318.20s:  But in video had real earnings risk and I think they were a little nervous because they're all so overloaded in some of these you know AI stocks
325.96s:  I think they skated but I don't think the skate will last for a while
329.20s:  I think I think this might be kind of like a little bit of the blow off top right here
333.80s:  Interesting and you mentioned AI obviously that's been the subject of conversation for some time now
339.52s:  Yeah, do you think it's actually something that's gonna have a massive impact and can truly drive value for companies like this
346.32s:  You do think it's over hyped at this point
349.16s:  Well, I I do think there is there are many aspects of AI just like there's many aspects of
356.76s:  Decentralization that I really think the technology is super cool
360.88s:  But I also think that
363.92s:  You know that
365.92s:  Also think AI is price to perfection at this point. I mean it sure feels like it. Let's put this I don't know
372.48s:  But it feels like it's price to perfection. So it's not really a question of you know, and there's no debate
378.76s:  There's I never debate technology like I don't say oh my god this technology sucks
383.80s:  So this is joke and that's not the way I think of things you know like technology is great and and the better the technology
390.88s:  The more potential it has and all that kind of stuff, but the markets are usually way ahead
395.80s:  You know pricing wise. They're usually spot on and they've they've moved the price way ahead of the technology
401.88s:  And I think that's where we are in AI. I think the price is way ahead of the tech
406.64s:  It's interesting you say that to come over to another topic that I generally am interested in your thoughts on on that same exact concept about the market pricing
416.40s:  And it's efficiency in doing so and sometimes getting ahead
420.20s:  It seems like every time this is going to the fed rate environment just to give you context on where I ask you next and
427.96s:  It seems
429.44s:  Multiple times now the market started to price a cut then new information came out and then you can see that the probabilities of a cut have been
437.52s:  Successfully moving essentially they were back to the way up to March where it was the first probability of a cut over 50% chance
444.08s:  And then now that's back out like June the market seems to be pricing it and then they're not right and then they have to read just based on new information
452.80s:  Well, there's no new market the market price the fed watch tool and the fed just prices everything based right off the bonds and the notes
462.80s:  Whatever it is so whether you're doing the two years five years ten years or 30 years
467.56s:  The the fed watch tool is just and the CME watch tool are just
471.76s:  Simple math equations based on actual price bonds
476.28s:  Bonds at 125 the long mod at 125 or the 10 year at you know 113 that price is in a cut to March, you know
486.00s:  Maybe multiple cuts to June, but when bond strap from 125 down to you know under 118 where they close today and
493.40s:  When notes drop from you know 113 down to under 110 and 109 and change you're talking about that
499.68s:  Absolutely takes the rate cut right off the table for March and pushes it out to June if you're lucky
504.60s:  I mean if the bonds stay here there's no rate cut in June if the bonds rally back which I think a lot
510.28s:  I'm playing long bonds here because I think there's very little downside not because I think I don't love
517.08s:  The upside in bonds and rates necessarily being lower, but I think that after a five or six percent sell off
523.08s:  It's really interesting to me because they're cheap relative to stocks
526.44s:  I think something's got to give here either bonds have interest rates
531.24s:  I've got to go lower and bond prices have to go higher or
534.64s:  Stocks have to go lower because stocks and bonds have disconnected and the divergence between the two right now is
540.88s:  It's too funky. It stinks. There's something's something's rotten
544.40s:  So I was betting that that I'm betting right now
548.92s:  I'm long bonds and short stocks because I think either stocks are gonna go lower or bonds are gonna go higher and I kind of like that play
558.16s:  But that's it. I mean that's just my own two cents who knows what's gonna really gonna happen
562.44s:  Yeah, and then within the stocks what are your thoughts on large cap versus small caps?
567.68s:  I'm long small cap short large cap here
570.44s:  I mean only because small cap is underperformed because of the move in the bond market
575.56s:  So when you get the when you get rates to jump as much as they've jumped in just the last you know couple of weeks on the
581.80s:  five or six percent sell off in bonds
583.96s:  you're going to get small caps to underperformed
587.72s:  and relative to the
590.60s:  The Russell relative to the S&P's and the Russell relative to the NASDAQ has grossly underperformed
596.04s:  So I like Russell here. I'm long Russell futures
600.36s:  And I'm short S&P and NASDAQ futures
603.56s:  Mostly S&P futures so far that that trade has not worked
607.80s:  Came in a bit last week, but then it widened out you know yesterday and today
612.04s:  um
613.32s:  I I still think that's kind of the trade of that for the next couple of months
617.24s:  I really like that trade but in order to like that trade you better like bonds in order to like that trade
622.44s:  You've got a dislike stocks
624.84s:  Now is there a reason why you go short
628.84s:  S&P versus
630.44s:  De-copaling tech from that equation because to me it seems like if you remove tech your position probably will be doing well
636.84s:  But because tech is still moving so well within the S&P 500 obviously struggling a bit. Curious your thoughts behind that
643.40s:  Well, I mean, I'm
645.40s:  I don't like to get too cute and I think when you're talking about especially you know if you're going to make a pairs trade
652.04s:  um, you kind of have to use futures. There's not really
656.04s:  pairs trans but stocks are too expensive to to capital intensive and pairs trans with options are too
661.24s:  Lopsided especially if you're a short sell, you know, especially if you like the short side
665.56s:  So if you're a premium seller like me you can't really use options for pairs trades that forces you into futures
671.32s:  Futures have less optionality than other instruments. They're pretty black and white. So I kind of like the
679.72s:  um, you know, the leverage and the simplicity of futures for
684.60s:  pairs trades only you know and so so so it doesn't give you a lot of flexibility
689.40s:  I mean you really have you know, there's three futures in the index world that you that are liquid enough to trade
694.68s:  There's the Russell. There's the Nasdaq and the S&Ps
697.48s:  So those are your three food groups. There's not really a lot of other stuff you can do
702.36s:  Got to make sense
704.36s:  When you look back at 2023, I know you've done a couple series on this on tc.lye
711.16s:  What you've been really cool, but I'd love to just touch on that really quick because there's a couple things
716.20s:  I've heard in some of those segments that I thought were really interesting, but 2023 in a nutshell. What's that out to you?
725.32s:  Um, I think that
728.20s:  the surprise for me in 2023 was
731.24s:  um, the the overall strength of the market. I think that the
735.64s:  The I was genuinely surprised by how strong the Nasdaq was in 2023
741.96s:  Um, I don't want to say a caught enough guard because I wasn't I didn't get really short in 2023
748.04s:  But I definitely was not long enough. I was not um
753.40s:  If I was long it wasn't the right stuff necessarily. I didn't believe
758.76s:  I think I was too too much of sceptic um on on some of these tech stocks too early
765.24s:  I just didn't think that it had as much legs as they had
768.44s:  So the biggest surprise to me was the strength of the Nasdaq to go to you know
773.72s:  What whatever it ended up finishing up for the year, but that was a pretty significant
778.76s:  Um, you know, that was a pretty significant run in 2023 much outside it was way outside of the expected move for the year
786.04s:  And then how does that carry over to this year tech not slowing down
790.52s:  Well, I you know, obviously the tech markets
794.04s:  Markets don't know you know, they don't have a calendar like we do
797.56s:  You know, so it's a little different
799.40s:  But as an option trader, you know, um, I'm not a reversion to the mean guy at all
804.60s:  But but I am a realist and I do believe that you know, there's things like you know, that still exist like gravity and um
813.64s:  Yeah, and and capitulation and stupidity
817.64s:  Just words for a reversion to a mean no, no, no, no
821.64s:  It's a big difference. I mean, I don't sit around and play for a mean reversion when it comes to price
826.68s:  But I do think there's certain situations
829.48s:  Where you know, like I mean, I'm not getting long I'm not getting long and video here. That's for sure
836.36s:  Hmm
838.04s:  Have you guys done any recent research on post earnings announcement drift?
843.96s:  Um, we've done a little bit. It's very hard. It's yeah
847.64s:  It research that we've done on post earnings is that they tend to be
853.24s:  Very 50 50-ish like if you even if you looked at the last couple of you know
858.68s:  Like if you looked at the last couple of major earnings reports even the last I don't know
864.04s:  Um weaker so or a couple weeks there hasn't been
868.12s:  That much consistent follow-through. I mean coin selling when I can think of that's had a huge reversal
875.32s:  Um, there's generally been a little bit of like immediate follow-through
877.96s:  But then they've kind of reversed like if you think about Tesla, you know, it's it's bound stuff. It's loads
883.00s:  When you think about Microsoft it bound stuff. It's low is pretty quickly
886.44s:  There hasn't been too much too much reversal to the downside. It's the only way I could think of his coin base
891.24s:  um, you know met at the same thing, you know a lot of pressure to the upside. So I
898.04s:  Recently if you talk about recent bias or something
901.56s:  I don't think there's been that many takeaways
905.48s:  Our own research shows that
908.76s:  Post earnings I always thought there was some like continuation of the earnings trend
913.24s:  But the reality is it's not that much different than normal positive drift
918.92s:  I would love to put a bug in your ear if I can to see if your team would be willing to take a look at the data
925.00s:  segmenting it and not looking at large cap but like small cap and mid cap because I've been running a study now on it for eight years
932.68s:  And I've found similar data points when it comes to large cap not showing much
937.64s:  Post earnings announcement drift potential
939.88s:  But I've been still seeing it in small and mid cap which I've been finding interesting over the following subsequent quarter to be specific not for
948.28s:  Yeah, yeah specifically long-term time frame. I think I think we our research would confirm that based on
955.96s:  but the difference between
958.92s:  Like we've seen positive drift in the last let's call it you know 10 to 15 years the positive drift has been more like
967.24s:  You know five or six percent positive drift as opposed to like historically let's call it three three and a half percent
974.12s:  So we looked at the earnings the difference was I think like 57
979.72s:  43 as opposed to
981.72s:  55 and a half you know
983.80s:  50 40 44 and a half
985.80s:  So I mean we're talking about like a one percent difference. It was it was statistically insignificant from a trader's perspective
993.64s:  Yeah, that makes sense
995.88s:  When you
997.48s:  Take a look at how 2023 behaved 2024
1002.20s:  First two months in line with expectations any surprises thus far
1007.48s:  Um, I think
1009.56s:  My perspective yeah, there's been some surprises. I'm surprised by the strength of these
1015.56s:  Um, I'm probably not surprised by the strength of the S&Ps as much as I'm surprised by the strength of these you know chipstock specifically
1023.16s:  you know
1024.52s:  Nvidia
1026.04s:  I'm the SMC SMC I before it crept out, but you know clearly in video up into the 700s
1032.04s:  Um, and I think you know Microsoft being able to hold over 400 the S&Ps being able to pretty much you know
1038.60s:  Hold tight at 5,000 I kind of feel like that's been a surprise for first quarter
1044.20s:  Yeah, and then looking over earnings anything stick out to you there were obviously closing down this next quarter at least for me
1052.04s:  I've been surprised to see the number of beats but not
1057.40s:  significant follow through actually literally what we're just talking about in terms of
1061.08s:  Pied so anything stick out to you for earnings
1065.32s:  um
1067.32s:  I mean
1070.12s:  Nothing that's
1071.88s:  Nothing that's at the level where
1075.00s:  you know
1077.00s:  There hasn't been I mean other than meta which I think you know kind of
1081.80s:  That was a little bit that was outside the range and a little bit of a I would say meta was the biggest surprise and the most difficult to trade
1088.92s:  I would think that everything else has been
1091.16s:  kind of
1092.36s:  in range
1094.44s:  Got it
1095.96s:  Pivoting a little bit whenever I do these with you or with other people
1099.56s:  I always try to see if anybody has questions and serve as a conduit
1103.16s:  I know that you answer emails like a madman
1105.08s:  But just to throw more questions at you one of the questions I got for you is actually really fascinating
1110.12s:  This one's from reddit and the context behind it is about kind of the evolution of retail traders
1117.48s:  You've been at the forefront of that technology for a hot minute now
1121.32s:  And the person was asking what you think the next wave for retail traders looks like
1129.64s:  And I'll kind of leave it at that for now
1131.64s:  They have some clarifying points that I can add on if you need but just at a high level I'm curious what you think about that
1137.88s:  Well, we we've clearly gotten to the point where
1143.08s:  You know, I I would think that if you asked the same question
1146.60s:  20 years ago
1148.60s:  It would have been hard to project
1150.92s:  You know where we've taken the futures and derivatives business to as a percent of the overall business
1156.76s:  I mean for the most part
1158.44s:  You know stock trading is a thing of the past because how many people can afford like in the case of NVIDIA as an example
1164.36s:  How many people can afford a you know a seven hundred and twenty-dollar stock
1168.60s:  You're really talking about a situation where you know a hundred shares
1172.60s:  You know puts you behind seventy one thousand dollars average account size is called 50 it doesn't make sense
1177.80s:  So so most people have moved to you know in the case of another using an NVIDIA example move to like you know short verticals
1185.00s:  Whatever whatever also is but define risk trades where
1188.68s:  Capital efficiency has become kind of the name of the game
1191.64s:  So um, so the most important thing is we've shifted from
1196.44s:  um
1197.56s:  We've shifted in a couple different directions one we've moved towards
1202.20s:  Capital efficient structure where people you know really start to understand capital efficiency
1207.32s:  The other thing I think that we've done is like
1209.64s:  A few years ago or 10 20 30 years ago you would have heard people say I'm an option trader
1214.12s:  I'm a futures trader. I'm a stock trader
1216.52s:  But today you have to be product indifferent like it makes it should make no difference to you whether you're trading
1222.04s:  You know um whether you're trading something in Bitcoin or you're trading something in in corn or you're trading something in crude oil
1228.60s:  You're trading something in in NVIDIA
1230.68s:  You know or IBM like it should make absolutely no difference like the same strategies
1235.80s:  Understanding that the same model supply everything
1238.92s:  I mean the biggest change we've seen in the last 20 years is the advancement of
1245.32s:  Marketplace efficiency because high frequency market making has changed the entire game
1250.04s:  Anybody can do anything they want in any underlying and if you can do it in a capital efficient way
1255.32s:  And you can do it with virtually no commissions and you can do it on really cool software. That's all for free
1260.92s:  You know just think of where we come in a very short period of time
1263.88s:  You know, where's the next jump going to be is it going to be in the decentralized space?
1268.60s:  Is it going to be tokenization or is it going to be that these platforms are going to be
1275.24s:  um more inclusive of
1278.60s:  alternative type
1280.28s:  Investments including you know decentralized investments. I think that is the answer. I think that over the next
1287.40s:  Five to seven years
1289.56s:  everything from
1291.08s:  event-based
1293.08s:  trading
1294.28s:  to
1295.40s:  To decentralized and tokenized trading because the problem is right now you're really limited to
1301.32s:  um unless you want to change currencies you're limited to a domestic market and because of lots of things
1306.44s:  You know, there's lots of restrictions as soon as we can do things in a tokenized form
1311.16s:  um
1312.12s:  We can basically trade any marketplace in the world in a single currency
1316.60s:  and by doing that
1318.60s:  um we really open up the whole world and virtually any investment to anybody
1322.92s:  So I believe
1325.24s:  That the future of this business is going to be much more um inclusion in products like
1334.04s:  event-based which includes everything from politics
1338.04s:  Down to because you make a market on anything
1340.04s:  So it includes politics includes markets from a single currency or a single crypto currency into any
1346.04s:  listed equity marketplace anywhere in the world
1348.52s:  I think these exchanges are going to get incredibly bold
1351.80s:  and
1352.68s:  The market makers are going to get incredibly bold and there's no reason
1357.48s:  Why they can't make a market everything? It's it's really going to be a challenge for us on a regulatory side
1363.16s:  You know the the the hurdles we have and the blockers are like you know the SEC Gary Ginsler all that kind of stuff
1369.96s:  Those are those are hurdles
1371.80s:  But without those you know as long as we continue to push the technology to the forefront um
1378.52s:  I don't see why everything
1381.80s:  Right anything is off the table in the next 10 years that includes politics events
1387.48s:  Sports betting tokenization all from a single platform
1391.80s:  And all with high frequency one tick wide markets
1395.16s:  That's the interesting part that that very last part what do you think yeah?
1399.16s:  What do you think about and I know we have like maybe 10 minutes left a little less than that so a couple questions
1405.00s:  The first one is talking about event-based contracts
1409.64s:  They're relatively new obviously gaining some speed
1413.88s:  People tend to akin them to binary options, which is obviously slightly different
1419.64s:  But walk a little bit about your perspective on event-based contracts and how they can fit into somebody's portfolio
1427.00s:  Well, they essentially are binary they're they're binary trades and they're they're in the current form
1434.12s:  I think they're
1436.12s:  I don't want to call them gimmicky, but in the current form they are less interesting because they are not complimentary
1442.60s:  To like a portfolio with theta decay. They're not complimentary even to zero dt's there's there's a lot of things that are
1449.64s:  That are very uninteresting to them from normal traders, but this is how things start right?
1455.16s:  This is how you this is how you break into it. There's no reason that
1459.56s:  Event-based stuff has to be binary like it's just the reason it is right now is for is a regulatory reason
1466.68s:  Um, but there's no reason that it needs to stay that way. There's no reason that that you know that that it has to be
1472.68s:  Hey, if it trades here. It's a win or law you know, I'm saying it doesn't it doesn't need to be a binary contract
1479.24s:  so the the nice thing about event-based stuff is that it's just it's in its infancy and eventually it's going to transition
1488.36s:  Over to being you know a normal listed product because it should make no difference to you
1493.64s:  I mean listen if we're sitting here trading in video earnings, right? Which is which is an implied move of let's call it 10% right
1501.96s:  and
1503.16s:  What's the difference if you're trading that or an unemployment number or a ppi number?
1508.12s:  I mean there it's the Nvidia earnings after the close are binary event
1512.76s:  There's no difference between trading a binary event that is actually much bigger
1517.80s:  than in video earnings like we should and there should be options around that there should be ways to play that you know so that
1525.40s:  um
1526.84s:  So that it opens up the whole marketplace so years ago we really didn't even have a good market for options on futures
1532.84s:  But there's such demand for it and there's such strategic demand that we've created this high-frequency marketplace now that is essentially one tick wide
1540.84s:  There's no reason why we don't have that in digital assets
1544.68s:  There's no reason why we don't we haven't converted you know
1549.00s:  Digital asset technology, which is awesome into a tradable marketplace
1553.16s:  There's no reason why we haven't done it in the event-based marketplace and there's absolutely no reason why we haven't done in the political marketplace
1558.84s:  And in the sports marketplace like they're they're all the same stuff to me
1563.64s:  You know, it doesn't we should be completely indifferent to what it is and I think that's just kind of you know tip of the iceberg
1570.04s:  capital efficiency people managing their own stuff
1572.68s:  Um, taking risk whatever it is being strategic, you know, no edge either way. I love it
1580.52s:  Speaking of taking risk in videos now at 738
1584.20s:  Unfortunately not moving the way you're not where I would not where I would ideally want it now it's up
1590.52s:  $70 so now it's now it's had its expected move, you know
1595.72s:  Unfortunately
1597.16s:  739 right
1599.16s:  um
1600.28s:  One other question I had for you
1603.08s:  When we're talking about the evolution of options traders there are things that I imagine
1608.52s:  That are common mistakes you see made that's timeless
1612.12s:  They mistakes made 50 years ago. See mistakes made now. Yeah, I'm not so interested in those
1616.44s:  I'm curious about what do you think are some of the new mistake options traders are making that are kind of more unique
1624.04s:  importantly to now
1626.36s:  Well, I don't think there's like a such a thing as a new mistake
1630.76s:  But I do think there's such a thing as the old mistakes kind of repeating themselves because you have new players
1637.80s:  Um, I mean, you know, we're innocent. We're in a
1641.40s:  We're in kind of um
1643.16s:  We're in a business where you know like the same think about it make a comparison to like baseball for example
1650.68s:  You know the same things that we're messing with hitter's heads in
1655.64s:  1920
1656.68s:  1924 are messing with hitter's heads in
1659.96s:  You know 2024, you know the picture has got a great curveball or you know they're messing with speeds and whatever else it is
1666.84s:  I mean, it's just things become
1669.08s:  technically more advanced and they become
1672.04s:  um, you know, and we look at things a little differently because it's a different era and it's a different
1676.92s:  You know ages and strengths and all that kind of stuff
1679.24s:  But the reality is the same things that played with your head, you know 100 years ago or playing with your head today
1684.52s:  And the same mistakes that we make as
1687.16s:  as speculators as risk takers as gamblers whatever you want to call it
1692.60s:  Um, those are same things. It's it's still mostly boils down to size size kills
1699.16s:  That's it and they're and after the size, you know
1703.64s:  Everything else is is really small in comparison
1707.80s:  I agree. I have one thought to tack on set. I'm curious what your input is. Are you familiar with the Dunning crew?
1713.56s:  Refect
1715.08s:  I don't think so
1716.44s:  It's essentially the learning curve, but it's our self-perception of
1721.32s:  competence so it's kind of like a yeah, okay
1724.92s:  So the one of the things I hypothesize you would know better than me is that with access to near unlimited information
1732.60s:  Absolutely incredible technology to me. It seems like traders
1737.08s:  Start to think that their skill set is above where it is much faster now
1741.96s:  Then what it used to be then if they were to sit down and read a book
1745.24s:  Which ultimate leads to what you were just talking about manifest in terms of sizing right we feel like we know
1751.08s:  We're doing now. We're gonna size bigger. Do you think that's any validity behind that?
1755.24s:  You just think it comes down to same sizing mistakes no matter what
1759.80s:  I
1762.20s:  the learning curve is
1765.48s:  I mean the amount of information that's out there and your ability to go from point A to point B
1771.32s:  in you know 20 years ago was very expensive and very time-consuming
1775.72s:  Your ability to do it today is far less expensive because most the content is free and
1781.96s:  It is much quicker because there is so much content out there
1785.40s:  So I would say that the learning curve has been dramatically shortened plus the markets are tighter
1791.40s:  And when you have tighter more efficient markets
1793.80s:  It's a lot easier to learn to play and learn than it is when markets are wide and it's very cost very expensive to learn
1801.16s:  um, so yeah, all those you do learn a lot faster now you learn a lot quicker you learn a lot faster um
1808.52s:  The the I'm not sure that
1811.80s:  That that changes like what some of the pitfalls are. I'm not sure that changes
1817.08s:  You know, I mean yeah, you get from point A to point B way quicker
1820.44s:  I'm not sure if that still changes how you deal with risk and things like that
1825.08s:  I mean, there's still you need a certain number of occurrences to at least understand
1831.08s:  You know, what's happening and what you're looking at
1833.88s:  Yeah, it makes total sense to me
1836.28s:  Now one last question before we let you get out of here
1840.68s:  What's something that you do that is like a do as I say not as I do in trading
1851.00s:  Um, well
1854.04s:  Based on my Nvidia position it would be
1856.76s:  Exactly exactly what we just talked about
1860.20s:  It was I say stay small don't do it
1863.96s:  um, you know like you know, I have an ego. I'm a trader like everybody else
1869.96s:  I mean the one thing I think the one difference between
1873.24s:  Me and most of the people in this that run companies businesses. I love the markets. I participate nonstop
1879.32s:  I don't care, you know, what it is, you know, I make I made a hundred trades today
1883.24s:  I love playing you know same playing field as everybody else um, I
1890.20s:  Sometimes I do lots of stupid stuff not in I mean like I tell myself no
1895.00s:  But you know sometimes I just get mad at myself and um
1898.60s:  Other times, you know, I'm really like I might go two months and and I'll have losing trades
1904.52s:  But I won't do anything stupid and then I might go like two weeks where I'm just like
1908.76s:  I'm I'm binging on stupidity and
1912.28s:  You know, and it just so I think that
1915.72s:  You know don't beat yourself up too much. It's something that we we kind of all do
1920.12s:  It's worked for me both ways like sometimes it works and and and I kill it
1924.60s:  I think I'm a freaking genius and other times, you know, I get killed and I think oh my god
1928.84s:  I can't believe I just did that I'm so I'm so I can't mad at myself not the markets
1934.04s:  Yeah, it makes sense
1935.24s:  I always make the joke that if you're a trader there's always a little bit of degenerate in you somewhere
1940.04s:  It lives in there and it pops out every once in a while so yeah
1944.36s:  We like to call some of the stuff we do like a D Gen financial network because
1949.32s:  Yeah, yeah, we definitely feel we definitely feel that that's
1954.44s:  That's in our blood and I don't there's nothing wrong with that just you know, there's nothing wrong with it
1960.68s:  I don't think
1962.04s:  Yeah, I feel like it has to be there in order to take risk
1965.96s:  Unless you're willing to step out there and take a risk you have to have a certain temperament
1969.56s:  So yeah, I think overall as long as it's not positive. It's good. But
1973.64s:  All right, Mr. Saznov we know you have other things to do your busy man
1977.48s:  We got to get you out of here, but thank you so much for hanging out
1979.88s:  I'll throw links to all of your stuff in the show notes below, but thank you for hanging out
1984.04s:  As always that was great good talk fun stuff and anytime you want
1989.32s:  Awesome thanks Tom
