 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you because you can then see a big change with respect to the near term correlations. Notice this red line, which is like a three day correlation. If you look at that and then if you look at the, what is that salmon color, like the five day correlation we'll call salmon, both of those effectively from the 20th have been skyrocketing positive. And I actually use the really short term as a leading indicator for the slightly longer term duration, although all of it is very short term in its idea. But this is another pairs trade that I traded specifically between comm services and tech. And the main ideas here are finding these distortions and the normalizations of relationships. And there are just a lot of those opportunities that exist right now. So if you're unfamiliar with those definitely worth hopping into chat GPT, spend it a little time getting more familiar with them because there's some pretty solid opportunity between those. Will says what trading software do you use? This is thinker swim. So this is from Schwab. Thinker swim also was like a mobile app. I'm not sponsored or anything by them. But thinker swim is just the platform that I happened to have started on when I first started trading in 07. So I use it primarily for that reason just because I'm supremely familiar with it. But it doesn't really do anything that's like highly novel to anything else. I'm not super familiar with trading view. I'm slowly tinkering with it more because I know other people do when I want to have a working relationship with it. But in general, thinker swim is pretty solid, but any of the main brokers tend to have the wrong versions of the platforms that are pretty good. Like Fidelity Pro, I used that for a while when I was trading a 401k. And like that was completely fine. So yeah. Okay, cool. Any questions on like the broad market as things sit right now. Anything that we want to dive into for that. And then if not, we can pivot over to the skills dev segment for today, which is going to be talking about trading kind of two things. I broke it down into two buckets mentally. Trading market news. So actual information that's being released. But then also the actual periods where information is injected. So this is kind of like trading market news, themes, and information as it's ingested into the broader market. That's how I'm intending to approach the conversation for today. And for context from the discord, which I will always remind everybody is completely free to join. And it will always be so. The one caveat to that is a bunch of bots find their way in. You just have to ignore your DMs. We don't have to. But you could talk to the bots if you feel like it. But essentially we had somebody that was talking about two different ideas. And I actually really liked this question because this gets to literally the heart and soul of what it is to be a traitor. Our job as a traitor is to find different market effects. I refer to them as profit mechanisms that we can monetize that we can make money off of. And the way that we do that as a retail traitor looks a lot different than the way an institution can approach it and so on and so forth. So I thought this question was actually highly relevant, especially for now. So I wanted to start the dialogue by giving you all an example. And the example that I want to give is probably I think going to be pretty native to you all because it's something that you overwhelmingly will have heard me talk about previously. And let's get into that. Let me see. There's one other window I have to grab really fast for you guys. So let me grab this other window. Okay. Let's get into it. I have a couple of things pulled up that I want to be able to reference for you guys. And then I need my drawing pad. So when we think about the stock market as a discounting mechanism and as something that will update based on new information, right? So if we take a look at this here. And we have the stock market, right? So the stock market is built of all these individual companies and so on and so forth. Now the way that the stock market typically gains value and exhibits positive drift is from the expansion of these companies of their overall profitability, right? So like this is the basics of how the market moves. But if we take a look at smaller term time frames, you'll notice that let's say that this range here is a 10 year range. But you'll notice even though over the course of that 10 year range, we started here and it here, which might amount to let's just call it 10% return something like that. It's obviously more than that. But let's just call it a 10% return. Over the this time frame, this represents a 10% return. Now even though this represents that positive 10% return, you'll notice that there are periods where things move differently. So this has a negative slope. This has a positive slope. This period here has a steeper positive slope and so on. So then what's happening? What's going on here? Why are there periods that the slopes are different, that the directions are different, those kinds of things? The reason is because the market ingests information and the market is what we refer to as a discounting mechanism. It's essentially discounting future cash flows. What we think things will be able to provide to us over the next six to nine months. So what's looking over here, we're not on this part of the chart yet. So as this is happening, that means that the current price of each of these stocks here is really dependent on information related to these stocks. There are different periods that we receive information about the stocks. We see information through things like earnings releases. We see things through press releases if there's a conference that comes out, so on and so forth. Okay. The point that I'm trying to make clear to you is that there is a process for stock XYZ. Right now at T zero time right now, we know what we know about stock XYZ. Then as we move to T plus one, whatever new time unit, this is in the future, there will be new information that comes out. There will be articles written, there will be press conferences that are on the TV, so on and so forth. As this new information comes out, that has to be baked into the price. People are going to react to the information. We're going to see what that impact is on our expectations of future cash flows, and then we're going to reevaluate the current price of stock XYZ that is sitting at $10, whatever. Okay. So now going all the way back to Elizabeth's question. When we are attempting to trade this, when we are trying to trade the news, what are we trading? This goes back to the way that I encourage you all to think about the market and to think about trading. There's a specific process, you all will be relatively familiar with this process. The reason why I'm calling this out to you is because when we're thinking about something like trading the news, we know that there's kind of an effect that we're attempting to capitalize on, but we have to get specific. We have to know what we're actually trying to trade so that then we can attempt to trade it logically. So when we're trading something like news, just like everything else we talk about, not all news is created the same. There are news categorizations that are going to have different level impacts than other news. So let's apply the standard process that we talk about all the time. So in this case, step one, the profit mechanism that we're attempting to trade here is direction. This can be up or down depending on what the news is. Now if we were to classify the profit mechanism type, what's the profit mechanism type here? Well, it's not really drift because we're talking about something that is going to be ingested pretty quickly into the stock market price. If you think about something like news, it's ingested very fast. The news comes out and then we kind of see what everybody thinks about it and how that impacts the stock. You can see that happen when things go through those big swings. So the profit mechanism type in this case literally is information, integration. So what this means is we're thinking about how this new information is going to impact the potential direction of the stock. Okay, great. Now we're on to something. We're on a standardized process to help us think through how to trade these kinds of effects. So let's take it to the next step. As we're thinking about the integration of new information into an equity price, we already arrived at the fact that not all information is created the same. If there's information, I get all sorts of alerts all days of all day of all kinds of stuff from insiders selling some of their positions and that can be perceived one way or the other of this new stock is potentially talking about acquiring another Celsius. Right now is talking about acquiring a Lonnie knew or what I don't know how you say the name of that energy drink. But there's information flowing all over the place. So the next thing we have to do if we're to attempt to go down this path is we have to think about how can we buck it news into different groupings so that I know what might be most applicable. We already know that we're trying to trade directionally. We already know that we're trading things like the integration of new information. One of the things that you will find if you analyze this kind of trading approach is that information discreetness matters a whole lot. And simply put, this is how effectively the news is integrated and baked into the price of a stock. Stocks that have exceedingly high coverage like Nvidia tend to be really, really quick to integrate new information for all of the different entities that trade Nvidia to pivot around and to try reposition their portfolios based on the new news, whatever that is. Things that are less highly covered might take a little bit longer. And for retail traders in general, those kinds of names are where more of the opportunity lies. And the reason for that and we're talking from a news trading perspective, we're not talking about any other effects right now because one of the things about trading news is we have to decide what kind of time frame are we attempting to trade? Are we going to trade the actual integration of the news? Right? This is one profit mechanism type that we're talking about. So this is going to be much order term. It's going to be super fast. It can be anything from minutes to a couple days, something like that. Whereas if our PM type is the same concept, same thing, direction, we want to trade information, but instead we're talking about something like this, the agenda of Donald Trump. And again, not getting political regardless of what you think about him and everything else, it doesn't matter. The fact of the matter is that there's going to be an impact to the market and our job as traders is to make money from it. So if we're instead talking about these broader economic themes, this is going to take a different time frame in order to completely play out. The new tariffs that are being launched, they're not going to be priced then right away because we still need to see the total impact. There are elements of the tariffs that we probably can come up with some guesses what you thought you could until you realize you couldn't. And what I'm referring to is one of the clear ideas is that if we start terrifying Mexico and Canada heavily and we're terrifying things like automotive manufacturers, that's probably going to hit the big automotive manufacturing entities here, right? It's going to make it more expensive for them to do business. That's going to hurt them. However, that information existed until new news broke out today and yesterday that Trump is talking about ways for them to be exonerated and for there to be a delay in the impacts of those tariffs. So then your original trade idea of this is going to be more expensive for four GM whoever else that you're thinking of Tesla. And the idea was well these tariffs are going to make it more expensive. Well, guess what? Our job as traders, Bayesian analysis, updating our mental models based on new information, new information came out. There's potentially another stay on those tariffs for another duration. And really it's to give them an opportunity to set up infrastructure domestically so that they can minimize the impact of those tariffs. This is one one single example of this. So if we think about this generalized profit mechanism of trading ingestion of information, what I'm trying to help you understand is that it's completely viable. But you have to be thoughtful around how you break it down into what relevant time frames matching the kind of ideas. So if I tried to trade, for example, the announcement of the tariffs, which I did, there's essentially two ways you can trade it. You can trade the initial response to the tariffs being announced. And then you could trade the longer term inclusion of the tariff impacts into the market. So that's using this one for an example. So let's clear all this off. And I want to show you a perfect example of a well-researched method to trade the information inclusion of things. And it's through this. Post earnings announcement drift. This is the thing I talk about all the time. Post earnings announcement drift is the inclusion of brand new information that comes out during an earnings release. It takes different durations in order for it to come to fruition. But based on my notes, there are different conditions that lead to different subsequent moves from post earnings announcement drift. So things like the earning surprise magnitude has an impact on the follow-on effect. Things like investor attention, how many analysts cover the stock impacts. The characteristics of the stock with respect to things like market cap value stocks tend to exhibit more drift tendencies. Earnings persistence, the number of prior shocks, impacts, future shocks. The behavior of individual investors, specifically the way that they follow news cycles can impact those shocks. Another one that a lot of people don't actually know about, which I think is, no, not this one. Yeah, this one. Value, glamour, and anomaly. This is another great example of monitoring a specific type of profit mechanism. In this case, information integration and then breaking it down. We're looking at earnings releases specifically for directional price shocks. And what you'll find is that there are certain stocks that are really, really, really heavily watched. And their success through earnings is really tenuous. And it's because all eyes are on the stock. And any slip, any micro fragment in the foundation of the company typically is really negatively perceived. So it's almost like they're set to fail unless they crush it. And then if they crush it, obviously, that tends to work better for them. So I've dumped most of these in the research paper section of the discord just so that everybody can poke through it at your leisure. But these are just a few studies. There's one that's really, really solid. It talks about like the last 50 years of post earnings announcement drift and the trends. But to go all the way back to the original question, the way that we trade news is actually very simple. We first start deconstructing the news because not all news is the same. And we need to understand this section of it, the signals of that news source. This isn't just like what analyst or what technical indicators or analyst reports say about this idea. But it's about how does the profit mechanism behave? So again, to give you an example. One thing that I know with certainty is that if I look at just about any stock, let's look at Nvidia. I know that if I go to these different earnings periods, there's going to be bigger price velocity around it. Very persistent. So then there are other effects to this same idea that we can trade. We can trade the various conferences that Nvidia participates in throughout the year. We have to look at prior conferences and see which conferences had, or you could just plot it on a time series. You could say for the past three years, use chat GPT, use AI to help you. That is, I will always reiterate this point. If you are not using that to help with everything you're doing as a trader, you literally are falling behind at a rapid rate. Because the easiest thing you could do is go to your research analyst, aka chat GPT and be like, yo, list all of the different conferences and presentations in video has given at industry events and just events over the last three years. You can then plot it on a time series like this. You can then analyze the price movement around those events. And then now you know based on what the event is, what is the standard price movement around that event? And this is exactly how we trade these kinds of ideas. So then to go back to this question one more time and to fully wrap up the point, if we think about trading something like the Trump agenda, we need to think about what the Trump agenda is. So one of them we know is literally trade wars. We know that there's tariffs going out and we know that there's going to be reciprocal tariffs if other people tear us, tear us back that will match. So this is an escalating thing. I would fully expect things like Ford GM, those kinds of companies are going to struggle in that kind of environment. So if we go, I haven't looked at Ford. So I'm actually eager to see how they're doing. This news doesn't surprise me. So this news came from the announcement and the launch of the tariffs. This news comes from the ability for Ford and the other automotive manufacturers to hold off on experiencing the tariffs for another 30 days or so I think the extension is. So you literally can trade that kind of impact. Another company that's going to be susceptible to all this conversation is GM and it will probably look the same as Ford shocker. Another company that's going to be really susceptible to something like this is Apple. Apple is announced a massive investment in the US like $500 billion or something if I'm not mistaken. And it's because they produce all of their shit in way cheaper places. So if these tariffs go through, that's going to negatively impact Apple. It's going to take them some time in order to get the infrastructure in place domestically to reduce the impact of those tariffs. So a lot of the market movement you're seeing is not just an artifact of the tariffs, but it's also an artifact of the drug deals that all of these companies are attempting to arrive at with Trump, meaning if I do this, can we hold off on the tariffs for another month. The thing to remember about Trump is that he's a deal maker. It's business. It's what he does. So he's probably always willing to listen to a business deal. And that's effectively what happened with the primary auto manufacturers. So the way that we trade something like the Trump agenda is we have to break out the Trump agenda into its core tenants. Again, I'm reviewing one of them right now with you, which is the trade wars. Another is deregulation. Another is drill baby drill. Another is decreased investment into renewable energy. There's a ton of ideas like this that exist. You can use things like the tax cuts. Look at what industries are most likely to be positively impacted by the tax cuts. What's likely to happen to the price of oil if we're going to not only produce domestic production, but then OPEC is also producing domestic production. Guess what? That means you fade oil because it's going to crater. Easiest trade on earth. It's just paying attention to the information that's coming out and then coming up with supporting ideas that capitalize on it. But this is the cheapest. As soon as I saw oil immediately start breaking down, but especially here, and then you go through the speech that he had yesterday, it was a no brainer trade. You put the trade on because if we zoom this out longer term, take a look at where oil is. It's effectively at like 23 peak lows. So another thing to know about oil though and other commodities is they tend to have a floor. So you can also trade from a pot-odd perspective, the relationship that something is to the perceived floor that we think may or may not exist. So at a high level, this is exactly how you trade news and information that's being baked into the market. As always, if you have any questions or if there's anything you want to talk about, let me know. I'm happy too. I still got some time. I do have to open the door for Thor and then we'll hit the chat. Tony is ready for his dinner. Ben says, specify we want to find events versus similar as possible to determine what it did. If we don't have that, then we need to do our best to calculate the impact of news on a company, but I still say, char. Yeah, well, no matter what, in trading, you rarely are going to deal with perfect information. So because of that, there's a lot of opportunity, right? Because we don't know. We can hypothesize about market effects or the inclusion of information, but yeah, it's exactly correct. We won't really know for certain. Not really a thing. So we do our best to find corresponding references that we could base ideas off of. Nothing in trading is ever going to be certain. The entire construct of what we're doing is we're just trying to take better probabilistic bets that ideally are skewed positively expecting value in our favor. That's really the only reason to put on the positions and stuff like that. Haters says is breakout different from information integration as a profit mechanism. It can be and it cannot be, right? The main thing I was showing you there is talking about profit mechanisms can be like overlapping. They're not necessarily discrete buckets. Because for example, we can talk about something like in earnings release. That's information integration, but then the subsequent move post in earnings that can absolutely be something like a breakout, right? If it breaks out on that price. So there are different reasons why stocks can break out. One of them could be of news information being baked into the price. Another reason a stock can break out is because there's just new institutional sponsorship that's really driving up volume. So I wouldn't really think of things like profit mechanisms as discrete buckets. I would think of it way more as a flexible list of market effects that you're trying to trade. Because there's something predictive about them. That's how I would think about it. Will says OPEC unwinding cuts get almost immediately priced in though. That's not really immediately. I don't really agree with that. If we take a look at like a two day five minute chart, right? Take a look at the movement here. That's not immediate at all. We can see that price leveled off here and then effectively from five a.m. up until nine a.m. is where that move happened. So it's not really immediate. No, that's whatever you're dealing with really big systems like this, it's going to take time inherently because what moves the price of things is not just the information. The information itself doesn't move anything. What moves it is the subsequent positioning by the aggregate entities. And it takes time for different entities to position. So yeah, I mean, this is a great example of that. We saw the newsline headline come out, right? There is nothing super specific or magical about it coming out, but it's definitely not instant. Like this price move literally took hours to fully come through. So yeah, you have plenty of time. Alberto says, how about news related to mergers and acquisitions? How does one trade that sort of news? Yeah. So the cool part is you can learn all about that effect based on the announcement and based on the total, based on the total perception of what it is. So if we take a look at the Celsius news, let's take a look. I'm trying to see like when it's specifically broke. Let me find it really fast. When did the news Celsius is exploring acquiring? I don't know how to spell the fucking other thing. Alani knew or some shit like that. I don't know. We'll see if Chat you PT can get me right. I think it's something like okay or it could just not search things. Alani knew. That was right. That was good. So I see it from them coming through on this looks like the 20th. So if we look through this, let's see, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Alani knew. Alani knew. So this came on the 20th. Let's take a look at what happened to stock price on February 20th here. Because a really, really common misconception is that for the acquisition, the lay approach is you short the acquireer and then you buy the acquireer E. So in this case, if Celsius is the one acquiring Alani knew, which I don't even think Alani knew is yeah, it's not even publicly traded. So you would essentially just go short Celsius. But obviously if you do that through earnings, you get your face ripped off. So the thing to pay attention to with respect to mergers and acquisitions is that not all news is created the same. And the perception of the likelihood of it going through matters, but then also the price matters a lot. Again, this is the problem with like blanket statements. And again, it's really common. Most people will tell you you short the person that's acquiring the company that's acquiring and you buy the one that's being acquired. But guess what doesn't work? If there's a hostile takeover and the company that's looking to buy the other one actually has an offer that's slightly low current market value. And somehow that goes through for X, Y, and Z reasons. We'll guess what happens in that scenario. The stock price is actually going to collapse of the company being acquired because of that reason. So the way that I would think about trading things like mergers and acquisitions is simply by very carefully analyzing the context of the MNA. And there are entire scans that we can do. We can look through a couple examples right now because it's kind of fun. Let me see if I can find MNA filter. This one's FDA. That's insiders, which I don't really care about. Let me find one real quick. Go in my red eyes, but in a lonely itchy. Here we go. MNA. And we'll just stuff it over here. Okay. And then let's take a look at MNA for this month. So there's jazz and CMRX. Let me look at those. Yes. So this was announced on the 4th of March. And they are looking to acquire CMRX. I'm just getting the details organized for you. Is the size of the deal. And then the payment type matters quite a lot. Come on, bro. There we go. And then we need the status because the status when it's first announced is typically when you're going to see the larger impact. So here, this is what I just kind of built for you guys. I know it's like super messy because I got a ton of shit on this one. But effectively what I'm doing is showing you this one. So we can look at different acquirers and then we can look at the target. And then we can see what the total impact is of the announcement. So in this case, there's another really important element, which is when is the deal expected to go through and how confident are we in the deal going through because of things like antitrust because what will happen is if an announcement is made, but the market looks at it and they're like, I don't think it's going to happen because there's precedent, literally legal precedent set. Well, then it's pretty simple because they're not going to move the price that much. And it's because they might not think it's going to go through. So what I would do is look through two things from a list like this. And again, you can use ChatGPT to help you. But I would essentially ask ChatGPT to create a list of M&A acquisitions over the last year, include ticker symbols for the acquire and acquire E or the target. Then I would literally go into a chart and go see how it behaved when the acquisition was announced against when the target date is or timeframe. And then what the ultimate resolution was, because a lot of times acquisitions will be talked about because people will be interested in the potential for an acquisition. But it doesn't mean that it's going to go through. And that differentiation is really, really, really, really important. Just because there's something that's announced or something that's on the table, it really doesn't inherently lead us to believe that it's going to go through and then the market's perception of that. It's going to price it in very carefully. And this goes back to why trading is a game of nuance. If you play the markets from the lens of if this, then that very rarely will it actually work out in that way, unfortunately. That's just kind of the, I mean, I think it's kind of the cool part to be honest, because that's what leads to a lot of opportunities existing in markets. But yeah, like this here, the earnings releases, this is another really, really common way to trade news integration of stuff. Cool. Let's, I mean, honestly, we could talk about whatever, whatever you guys would like. I am down. I'll get into the chat and see what you guys are interested in exploring together. And we'll take a look. I'm just organizing this a little bit. Let's do this. We don't need name. We don't need this. We don't need this. Let's take a look at the key. One. Close all of it. And I think we can get to it. James says, how do you define positive expected value trades on information trades like this without probability information? How do you set profit, take it and stop losses? It's a great question. And it's really easy because options markets give you probabilities. There's always probabilities. That's the cool part about options. And you're actually reviewing the probabilities of entities that arguably are light years, sorry to burst all our bubbles that are light years smarter than all of us. So the way that you define positive expected value trades on things like this is by again, analyzing historic precedent and then seeing what typically happens. And then updating that data set as new data is ingested. But for something like identifying probabilities, literally just use options markets. So like, for example, if we take a longer second to figure out what the acquisition of jazz, I think they're the acquirer. If I'm not mistaken, from this, let's see real quick. Yes, so they're the ones that are supposed to be acquiring CMRX. So what we can do is we can say, all right, based on when this news broke out, which is again, the 4th of March yesterday, what does the market think? Looks like the market's kind of calling the bluff. It doesn't really look like either that it's going to be a big investment or that it thinks it's highly probable to go through. Now, the next thing we can do is figure out what the spend is. The spend for this deal looks to be 935 million in cash. So what we can do is we can figure out for jazz how much of their cash is that? How big of an investment this is. And we literally can eyeball how much we would expect the stock to drop for that kind of acquisition. And then we can compare that to what the options markets tell us. We can say, what is the option market think is going to happen? Because again, the options markets are pretty well informed. And we can look at the probability cone. I can tell you that the probability is positive skewed based on the tails of it out here. And those kinds of things. So that's how you do that. We'll say short acquire long acquire. Yeah, see? That's exactly what I was talking about before. Most people will say that. And it's not inherently wrong, right? Like that's like a generalized way to look at it. The problem is is it just misses all nuance. And if you trade on that idea, you'll lose money actually quite a lot. There's a couple really important factors to bake into the decision. Will says, do you have any data subscriptions for minute by minute news, order flow, etc? I do mostly because I'm an affiliate for a couple entities that I like. I'm not really an affiliate for anything that I wouldn't use. But the reality is is most information that I think a trader probably would need, depending on your style, is you can get the information directly from a platform, right? Because almost all the platforms are going to get the information from the same places. There's a couple key data vendors and news vendors that they all pull in from. So from a news ingestion perspective, you can kind of get equal level news from most places. You really don't have to pay for that. When it comes to things like order flow, that depends entirely on what kind of order flow you're talking about and then what you're trying to do with it. Because there is a latency component to that. But things like bar chart, I don't know if they're free version of it allows you to set those kinds of alerts. But I know their paid version does because they allow me to use it. And like that's really useful. But again, you can even set up those kinds of alerts through your platforms. Again, if you're in like a reasonable platform. So you can come into something like this through think or swim. And we can say, okay, well, what's happened with this individual line item option. And I can run studies on it, right? And see, okay, well, something happened here in ACI, the one day relative volume is 215,000%. Some shit happened, right? So you can run it through something like this. Tommy says Amazon, how people are positioning for Fridays, a role, unemployment and announce, wait, Amazon. What do you mean? Could you explain that a little bit more for me? I'm just not totally following. And I got to open the door for Thor. Brandon says, what platform? I'm really surprised that I get asked this so much, to be honest, just because it I don't know what most people use. But for most people that I know that are even kind of like marginally serious traders, like most of us are used to seeing the same things. So it's really, really curious. This is called think or swim. It's from TD Ameritrade. Find that so, so interesting. Tommy says Amazon bad employment economic data can tank Amazon consumer discretionary. Is that the historic precedent that we've seen at least lately? I haven't traded that effect personally. It sounds logical to me, but I just don't know exactly the scope of that specific precedent. Like I absolutely would buy it, like it sounds right to me, but that's what GROC 3. Well, GROC 3 isn't, that's not the right. GROC 3 isn't it. We need to actually look at the information, dog. So again, we can, I'll give you a super quick version of this. Let's go to Amazon. And then Tommy ask GROC 3 for a list of dates for, and I would pick which one of those matters the most. Is it payroll? Is it unemployment? Which of those is it? But we can effectively look at the behavior of Amazon relative to those employment numbers. And again, you can do this super easily via just basic data analysis. What that would look like is if we close these, we would import the stock data here, you download it from wherever. And then we would import the dates for the releases that were interested in over here. And then we would literally analyze the movement of the stock wrapped around those dates. And that's the exact way that you kind of get to an actual answer versus just kind of guessing. But I would definitely go further than just kind of, you know, what GROC 3 says. GROC 3 might have some ideas that gets you down the right path, but we still have to analyze them. Ben says, I thought about taking my first options trade, buying a put on VIX. I thought 14 dollars, but I noticed a 200 K45 call. Is that normal? Well, let's see, let's teach you how to answer that. If we take a look at VIX and let's take a look at just a bunch of different, a bunch of different chains. And if we just kind of eyeball, it looks like the volume isn't populating for some reason because the market's closed probably. If we take a look, for example, in the change in open interest, we can see a lot of the open interest is in like the tens of thousands. So then if we just eyeball the price of these, right? So let's say this is 10,000 at what's the midpoint here? Like 85 ish. So you have $85 times, let's just call it 10,000 total lots, something like that, 850K change in OI here. So the way that you can kind of help yourself answer that question for yourself is just look at other references within the options chain that are relevant and then make a decision based on that. Yeah. Paul says, who is the provider of this acquisition data? This is from Benzinga. And I'm also an affiliate with these guys. I like their stuff. Their platform is pretty useful for general data analysis. I use them more for like just market data. And then I tend to use bar chart for news, scanning and stuff like that. Unburdened. Chris, what up? I think the best piece of advice for that is just go for it. If you spend too much time thinking about it, you ain't going to do it. So go forth and do great things. Let's take a quick look. Let me close all these out. I want to actually eyeball that Amazon idea just out of curiosity. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to bar chart. I'm going to download the historic data here. Just do daily data for the last 25 years, plenty of time. So this is what it's, well, it's certainly taken its time. It's probably because it's freezing. That would be my guess. So, who's the thing? Thank you. So I'm going to drop this in my downloads folder here. Open this bad Larry up. I'm going to move you guys back over to this screen. Okay. First thing always clean the data, which means we know we have to go. Why am I hitting caps? Look at the wrong spot. We got to get rid of this. And then the other thing is we can say, well, we have the percent change here, which is good. We don't really need the volume. But that's okay. So this is the Amazon data. So now the next thing, Amazon only one mis recently, October 4th missed negative 100,000 one, Amazon down 2.5. Yeah. Well, you can't like, we can't use a single data point. A single data point really doesn't tell us like quite literally anything. So now the next thing is I need to ask chat GPT, create a list of unemployment number releases, including the consensus and actual. And then you can also get this from the BLS, your labor statistics. They'll have it. Well, I just want I'm not really just curious of chat GPT. You can do it. But anyways, this is exactly the process I would follow. And then next step would be to include the date here for the different releases. It just gave me three dates. So before I go any further, one of the very first things I need to do is validate that this information is even moderately accurate. So this is what GPT gave me. We forgot this column. It's screwed it up one sec. Do you know just stop this important work So now And now I just want to fact check it because anything that I can't get from chat you BT, I will not take it at face value. And I need to make sure that it's actually accurate. So we'll squish this down. And effectively what we're looking for are these last release dates for unemployment. Which was seven feb. So let's go the last month. And let's go to seven feb. So there's non farm. And then there's unemployment. We got it at 4.0 versus 4.1. So it's accurate. I'm not even going to lie. I'm actually kind of surprised right now that this is even moderately accurate. I thought for sure this was going to be completely wrong. Which is good. So then the next step is literally just conducting basic data analysis. We can use different time frames and we can say how did Amazon, oops, how did Amazon behave around these dates. And then we can populate either I don't typically use charts just because I can kind of see it in the numbers. But what I typically would do now is actually just feed this into Python and then query it against it in there because I can do a lot with it much more quickly than writing it in Excel. But you can also do it in Excel. This is exactly exactly the process. But we can just eyeball it super fast. So let's I need to expand this. And let's go. We'll clear everything. And then let's go to February seventh. We'll do day before day of day after. And then let's take a look at the other one which was 10 Jan. Day before day of day after. And then the other six days. Day before day of day after. Let's take a look. Here's the Fed block. And we can take a look at the differences. So we'll copy this. Now unfilter this. Help us down here. So seven Feb this is when the date or the actual data came out. This is when the actual data came out. This is when the actual data came out. So this is what I refer to as just an eyeball test, right? This is statistically completely insignificant. But it's a way for us just to even get a rough idea what happens on specifically the day of. So if I take a look at Amazon's price behavior the day of on this day. And then we can take a look at whether or not it came in above or below. And then we can then figure out what the corresponding move was. And again, you need a much larger data set than this. Like I would go back the last two years probably so that I at least have something that's relevant. But I would wait the more recent stuff a little more heavily because it's definitely going to be a little bit more important. And just realize this after six. So you've always got to go as always. If you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
