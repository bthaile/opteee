0.00s: Admiral, we have any ships to go to the south. It's a trap.
5.04s: You heard it from the man here first. That's our trap. That's kind of the nature of our brains
11.04s: with respect to trading. There are a lot of traps that are very easy to find your way into.
16.64s: And we all will experience these to different degrees. Now, one of the main things is to do your
20.80s: best and learn from these potential circumstances before you go through them yourself so that you
27.28s: have a little bit of an idea before you get too far into the weeds. So cognitive biases,
34.32s: believe it or not, we as human decision makers are literally riddled with cognitive biases.
41.84s: These are just some of them from my website. You can pop on, go look through it,
45.52s: your leisure. But there are some of these that are really, really dangerous. So things like the
51.60s: disposition effect is one that you have to be aware of. This is where we have a tendency to cut
56.96s: winning trades too short and let losers run, which is coupled with something called loss a
61.92s: version. Confirmation bias is another really, really important one. This is where we focus more
69.04s: so on information that confirms what we want to see and not what the objective reality might be.
75.76s: Hindsight bias, really important. Hindsight bias is when things seem ever so clear when we're
82.96s: looking at stuff in the rear view mirror, meaning stuff that has happened before. And I have a video
88.08s: that goes through all of these way more in detail. We're not going through one by one. You have to be
92.80s: aware of these. That's what it boils down to. You have to be aware of the presence of each and
97.04s: every one of these because they have ways to slowly siphon money away from you or to lead you into
103.04s: making really poor decisions in a really short term timeframe. So the main fix here is to conduct a
110.56s: landscape analysis. What I mean by this is to take a look at how traders tend to behave and tend
115.68s: to perform. And you'll actually see in a little bit, I have a bunch of examples from places like
119.92s: Reddit. Reddit is not my favorite place to learn about trading, but it definitely is my absolute
126.96s: favorite place to learn about the experience of traders because you're going to come across a wide
132.64s: gamut of it. And a lot of them will be unfortunately unsuccessful. But there's a learning point for you
138.96s: in every single one of those instances. You also can implement things like external audits.
145.04s: This is when you ask a friend to take a look at what you're doing. And if you're part of our
149.68s: discord community, it's completely free to join. You can always ask another trader in there. That's
154.08s: why I'm built the community for you as a resource for traders among one another to connect with other
160.56s: quality people that are genuinely interested in some of the same stuff. And finally, the way you can
166.40s: identify a lot of these things is if you track what you're doing because we have a really faulty
173.12s: memory when we're trying to remember what we did while we did it. So if you're taking notes as
178.64s: you're doing things, all of your different cognitive biases, they're all going to bubble up. You're
182.72s: going to see them clear as day. And then you can create controls to make sure that you're
188.00s: analyzing things objectively, that you're examining things holistically from an objective bias
194.80s: as compared to just trying to confirm what you want to see. The next one here is called good old
200.56s: Goldilocks analysis. This is the propensity for traders and people in general to either not
209.36s: sufficiently and objectively analyze themselves or in endeavor what they're doing in individual
215.68s: trade, all of those things. This is why a lot of times let's use a basic example. If somebody says,
221.12s: hey, how long is it going to take you to get ready? People will say, oh, it's eight,
224.00s: we've been five minutes. And then 15 minutes later, they're still not there. You're like, what the
227.60s: hell's going on? That's Goldilocks analysis. They think they're going to move a lot faster than they
231.84s: actually do. This translates to trading in a lot of really nefarious ways. But this is where we
237.44s: spend way more time looking at what we think we want to see happen in a trade as compared to what
243.20s: might actually happen in a trade. So let's take a look at an example of that right here. So we can
248.96s: see that this is from a while ago on Theta Gang. And we have this person that got a sign on
255.36s: arc down 50% what now. So they sent a bunch of cash secure puts and they got assigned on some
262.16s: shares. They were waiting for a time to wheel it and they're down 15% from their entry. This goes
267.44s: back to that loss of version thing. I was telling you about there's a lot of issues that you can
271.92s: pick apart from this thing. But the really interesting thing about this is you can tell when they first
277.20s: entered this trade, the only thing they're considering is what they were making from those cash
281.52s: secured puts. They clearly did not consider this side of the trade. And for their question of how
288.48s: do I avoid this in the future, you analyze both sides of the trade. You don't just analyze the
295.52s: side of the trade that you're interested in that you want to see happen. That's a primary driver of
299.92s: what you see here. The next thing, the attachment from your trading capital. These instances are
306.96s: really interesting. And there's a couple ways we can overcome this. And this is a nefarious,
312.88s: nefarious thing. So detachment from trading capital allows us to cope with losses. And you can see
319.36s: that that's a problem for a lot of people. Here's the deal. When you put in your hard earned money
325.36s: into your trading account, it takes you weeks. And you can literally count the hours of time,
331.12s: hourly income that it took for whatever you lost. If you don't control this sensation of when
339.84s: you're moving money from your regular bank account into your trading account, and if you don't
344.96s: control the sensation where it's like, Oh, I just lost 40 hours worth of my money. Or whatever
350.64s: the case is, you'll never fully be able to detach from the capital. So one of the things that I do
356.72s: is the money that goes into the trading account while I have zero intention of losing it. I will
362.08s: mentally assign it as gone. And I actually think that's a very important process because we can
367.60s: look at somebody that really has done a great job at this. And they are one of my favorite people
373.76s: to take a look at what they're doing. DFV, aka Roy and Kitty. And we looked at a bunch of his different
379.04s: trades and his account has gone through massive changes. And it's because you'll notice that these
384.40s: are yellow updates. This is because it's very likely he set up a separate account to be really risky
389.60s: with his money and mentally detached from the capital. That's how he's able to watch it.
394.96s: Eb in flow, $160,000 in a day is compared to up $130,000 a day before. And then eventually this
402.40s: grows into million. Most of us, if we were up 1.5 million, we would take that down in an instant
407.68s: and move on forever. Meanwhile, the next day, because he didn't unwind there, he was up $7 million.
414.56s: That's the point. So the way that we overcome our ability to let trades and systems work is by
421.60s: giving them time, space, and room to move and mentally decoupling ourselves from the money that
427.68s: goes into it. The other thing is through exposure therapy. The way that works is let's say that
434.48s: you think $100 is a lot of money still. And you put on a trade, you lose $100, and it's really,
439.28s: really painful. The way that you slowly get over that is maybe you put on a trade that's a little
443.76s: bit smaller that maybe loses up to 80 bucks. And then you slowly ratchet that up as you get more and
449.76s: more comfortable with the size of the trades that you see, that builds up over time. Okay, next one,
455.60s: false attribution. This one's really, really, really tricky. False attribution is where we have
461.60s: a tendency to not holistically capture what went on or the thought process behind something.
469.68s: And the reason why this is so nefarious is because it can lead us to making changes based on something
476.24s: that's not the actual primary driver of a problem. And there's a few really, really easy ways to
481.12s: get over this. But let's take a look. This person says greed is one hell of a drug. They say I've
485.60s: been scalping spied for a few weeks. I've been profitable almost every day, but it's always
490.16s: greed that gets me. I have a target of 500 day been up 2000 only to lose it on a trade and be
494.48s: down like 400 bucks. So they're attributing this to greed, but is this actually greed? It certainly
502.40s: seems like there's an element to it. But the problem is is that if this person thinks it's greed
506.40s: and only greed, they're probably not capturing some of the really important details that I can pick up
511.60s: from this from actual positive attribution of what's going on here. One of them is I can tell you
516.48s: that they don't have a written plan because if they did this short circuit, essentially all of this.
522.24s: If you have a plan that you really trust and you just wanted to play that plan, then this
526.72s: sensation goes away. The other thing I can tell is that there's no risk management plan to the
531.20s: downside because if we're worried about making $500 a day up $2,000 to allow that $2,000 to turn
538.16s: into down $400, tells us we have an issue managing risk to the downside. That's also loss of
543.60s: version which we learned from the first cognitive bias overview section. So the point is we need to
548.88s: we need to dig deeper. We can't just stop at a superficial answer and say, okay, greed is one
553.52s: hell of a drug. I'm sure that that's a part of what we see here. But then we have to ask why is
558.56s: greed one hell of a drug here? Because I want to make more money. Why? And so on and so forth,
562.80s: you'll start to illuminate way, way, way more details about your process as compared to what
568.64s: seems to be a smart superficial answer. The reason why I say smart is because you're taught not to be
574.64s: greedy or taught to take profits fast in all of these kinds of things, but it might not actually be
580.72s: the plaguing issue underneath and it can lead you down the wrong path. Last thing, undisciplined
585.76s: approach. This is super easy. You need to have trader documentation and I have videos about all
591.12s: of this. But this simply comes down to doing the work before you ever place a trade and in fact,
596.56s: that's where all the work is done. If you go through the process of outlining what you're trying
601.76s: to do before you do it, you're quantifying things. You can avoid this really, really dangerous,
607.12s: dangerous path. So we have an example here where somebody saying, is should I sell the option or
612.32s: exercise? Guess what? This person should define this before they get into the trade. Just as this
619.28s: person should have defined what their exit point would be in the unhappy path, meaning avoiding
627.60s: Goldilocks analysis, and the unhappy path of the trade going against us, we should define where
632.96s: we would get out. The problem here is not having a clear plan in place. If you go through that
640.48s: ahead of time, you short circuit literally all of this. So these are five of the most impactful
647.92s: psychological traps that impact not just individual repetitions and actions, but the entire
654.56s: path of a trader. As always, if you have any questions or anything you want me to do a video on,
658.88s: let me know in the comments. Be an outlier. We'll see y'all later.
