0.00s: What's up everyone? We have the crappy camera today because I've been up and down standing
7.84s: sitting most of the day and we are getting ready to kick off another is that has the lighting.
16.04s: How do we look? That looks okay. We're getting ready to kick off another part four actually
21.48s: of our beginner options trading live streams. We pop out this chat. I'm going to move it
28.88s: over here so I can keep an eyeball on everybody. As you guys know, these are designed to be
34.32s: interactive sessions. So more than anything, if there's something that you guys want to
38.88s: talk about, if there's something that you guys have a question on, if there's something
43.28s: that you would like to take a look at, let me know. That is literally the entire purpose
49.00s: of doing these in this format is so that we can hang out, interact and kind of talk about
54.60s: the exact things that you guys want to. So for today, there were a couple questions that
61.60s: I had sent in and then I also have kind of this outline for analyzing options chains, which
70.24s: builds off really well what we've covered so far. So the goal behind this video at the end
77.96s: of it, you should have a better idea of looking at analyzing options chains, how to look
84.92s: for anomalies, how to identify good versus bad opportunities, at least in terms of cost
91.64s: and execution. We should have a better understanding of volatility, specifically as it pertains
97.60s: to surfaces and smiles, so that when you're structuring trades, you have a much better
104.12s: roadmap on what you're deciding. If any of you guys had a chance to check out the video
110.60s: I launched today, you'll notice actually quite a few of these concepts baked into it as
118.88s: we're taking a look at things. So that is a rough overview of what's on the agenda. As
125.68s: you guys know, we got to say hello to everybody in the chat and it's always the best to be
133.04s: able to chat with the outliers on a beautiful Friday. So let's see who we have in store.
140.92s: I see Paulo James. What's up, James? Welcome to thank you for the support on outlier bronze.
145.76s: I really appreciate that. Roaring Titty, I don't know if there's a funnier name in here
151.12s: right now. I say it all the time, one of the greatest things about YouTube and about
157.40s: Reddit about all these different kinds of communities. It reminds me of like the old
161.36s: game stop or game stop, the old Xbox gamer tags people had that were always just so ratchet.
169.80s: So I have a deep appreciation for that. Let's grab a couple of the questions that we have
175.32s: and it looks like big K has one as you could tell I'm already on it like white on rice.
180.44s: I have it grabbed and blown up as if it was part of this the whole time although it wasn't.
187.04s: And then we also have our boy J Shrej J Jason, Elon songs Peter, Nico, Niko, I'm not sure
196.76s: which one, but Nico, I'm going to go Nico. I think that that's right. Nico says I keep
204.04s: hearing about this guy finally got a chance to be here. Well, that's kind of terrifying
207.88s: because if I don't know where you would have heard about me, but that's yeah, I don't
213.04s: know if that's not great news for me. Nico got it. Well, that's a cool name. It reminds
217.88s: me of the dude from Grand Theft Auto 4, I think Nico Bellic when that game came out.
225.48s: All right. It looks like there's another question here. J says if someone is just starting
230.08s: up paper trading, what would you say the most important things to focus on? Actually,
233.60s: that's a great, that's a great spot to start. We literally can start directly with that.
237.60s: So when I think about the prospect of paper trading, actually, I need to see if I have
245.28s: a video on this, I don't. That's kind of crazy, isn't it? Let me add that to my list right
249.40s: now for you guys. It's kind of nuts that I don't have a thing for paper trading. I just
255.44s: added a note to make a video on that at some point. So for those that don't know the way
259.56s: that my typical content production schedule goes is like I'm doing these random right
266.12s: now. It's almost every day market recaps of a couple different stocks looking at them
270.28s: from an options perspective. But normally I have a podcast episode that comes out every
274.84s: Wednesday and then every Saturday is a video. And then typically Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
281.76s: Sunday is live stream. I much prefer the live streams. It's because as you can tell, I'm
286.96s: not like some sort of great video producer. I'm not great at telling these super funny
291.48s: stories like my buddy Benjamin, his YouTube channel, which you guys should absolutely
294.68s: check out. He's he's masterful. But what I do like to do is share what I know. So this
301.80s: is kind of a easier way and more direct way for me to do it. Reese says, new subscriber
306.84s: first time commenter been binging your videos great work. That's awesome. That's good.
311.04s: Where you at Reese in your options trading process, roaring titty, which I will never get
316.20s: tired of saying that name. How do you keep up the data real time with the volatile stock?
320.44s: I find options move pretty fast for me. Yeah, I think for that, it depends on what kind
324.68s: of data you're trying to keep track of because well, yeah, maybe we'll start with a question
331.32s: there for you. What data are you trying to track? Because for me, a lot of things that I do
335.56s: is once I have something set up, I'm going to set primarily alerts or what I need to interact
342.68s: with it or what I'm looking for new opportunity. Now going back to Jay's question, I think
348.96s: here's exactly what I would focus on in paper trading. The first one is the process of defining
358.56s: a strategy. It's not easy. It takes time. And I have, as you guys know, videos on this, I'll
365.92s: give you a couple in the chat here like this. And then like this.
379.60s: And then I think there should be. Yeah. So the process of paper trading, I think, is always
390.24s: with everything else. You got to start with defining the goal. For me, the goal of paper trading
395.04s: is to validate ideas. It's to develop a much, much better understanding of the product that we're
401.84s: looking at. And it's absolutely to make sure that you can create a usable data set over time.
409.12s: That's kind of like the origin, the process of paper trading. So I think the first thing to focus
415.12s: on with paper trading is defining your ideas. Then I think the next thing to focus on is building
421.12s: a trade log that lets you track the performance of those ideas. Those are the first two steps.
428.00s: After that, I think you can start getting closer into the world of trying different ideas.
435.44s: So say, for example, you don't know yet, let's say you don't know yet, that the wheel typically
442.48s: underperforms by and hold. And let's say that you're under the impression that the wheel or
447.76s: covered calls is the greatest thing on earth. And that's what you should be doing. And there's
452.08s: nothing wrong with that strategy to be very, very clear. But a lot of people mistakenly think it
457.44s: performs better than it does. So you're trading your covered calls and your original hypothesis is
464.80s: I want to be able to maximize my portfolio growth on a monthly basis. Then you kind of start noticing
471.60s: wait a minute. If I'm comparing against a benchmark in whatever it is that you're trading. So
477.20s: let's say you're trading stock XYZ. And in your trade log, I would set up like two different
482.16s: components. The first component would be just buy and hold XYZ. Then underneath that, I would set
488.24s: up a trade log that lets me track how I think I'm going to trade my strategy. And so maybe it starts
494.96s: with selling a 30 Delta put and I sell these 30 Delta puts until I get assigned. Then I buy the
500.48s: shares. All that's tracked. And then at the end of the month, you might look down and say, huh.
505.20s: So the stock went sideways and I made way more money with the wheel than I did with buying shares.
513.36s: Interesting data point. Then it's only a month. You can't conclude anything from that yet.
518.88s: But then you can go down that path over the next few months and you can say, well, it seems like maybe
524.56s: if the stock that I really like is going through a consolidation period and moving sideways,
529.28s: maybe instead of buying shares, I focus on something like selling puts, selling the wheel,
535.60s: running the first part of the wheel. And then as it starts to accelerate and show that upside
540.80s: momentum that you can make more money on, then maybe you pivot to either buying shares outright
547.60s: or scaling into your position. So there's a lot of different ways that you can structure ideas
554.56s: and the purpose of paper trading is to be able to test them. The other thing,
560.16s: not specific to ideas that I think is really important to integrate into paper trading regimen
566.00s: is actually looking at markets. So one of the things I recommend to people, especially people that
572.16s: are in like the the Patreon side of things that I interact with on this level a little more
576.40s: regularly, what I try to do is get them to think about what the profit mechanisms that you're
583.68s: trying to capitalize on and you should have some sort of regular process to look at that.
590.00s: So let's say for a profit mechanism you're talking about trading something breakout upside,
594.48s: breakout downsides, some sort of momentum breakout. Well, what I would do, even if I'm not
599.36s: necessarily placing trades, but what I would do is set up a tab in my paper trading log to then
604.96s: test this profit mechanism. And I would say, well, I think there's edge in trading things that
611.84s: consolidate for X period of time and then have some sort of breakout. So I would find names,
617.60s: I would create a scan that lets me find names for all of these. And then I would create P&L
623.20s: targets for all of them. So let me walk you through a specific example of this so that it's a little
628.72s: less esoteric. And it actually works really well because this one, here's a trade that I have on
637.92s: right now. So on the 27th of June, which is yesterday, I bought to open a number of the reason why
649.60s: I don't have the number here is because it doesn't really matter for this example. But I have a number
655.20s: of these 41 puts at $4.25. So if we're using this is a dummy account of mine, if we go into EQT,
668.80s: the first question is how did I find that? Well, I have a scan that lets me look for what I consider
676.88s: to be interesting short term short opportunities. And that's what this is.
683.60s: So kind of glossing over a lot of the analysis here, if I bought this option with the expectation
692.56s: that it's going to go down, then let's say that there's no trade part of this. Let's just say that
698.48s: I'm practicing looking for breakdowns. And part of what I'm thinking about in a breakdown is,
706.00s: I want to see something that was consolidating for a while, started making lower lows, consolidated,
711.44s: and then started falling through that consolidation period. Maybe that's the scan.
717.04s: So that's actually how I found this name was on one of my scans. So then I enter in this position,
723.12s: you don't even have to enter the position. You literally can just track the name. You could put EQT
728.16s: in a Google sheet. And you can say the date that you saw, then you could have ticker, date of
734.88s: interest, whatever the current price was, and then whatever your target prices are both
740.24s: for a stop and for your profit target. So in this case, you can see that I have the trade set
746.96s: to stop me in profit no matter what because I got an accommodating move after I entered. And then
752.32s: there was a bit of a continuation to the downside. So I slid my stop down just a bit to capitalize
759.60s: on this breakdown. So that is one really simple way you can use paper trading to test a thesis.
769.76s: And give me one second. I got to open my door from a dog.
772.08s: That was hilarious. He was like in here whimpering because he knows he's not allowed to bark in here,
786.72s: but then as soon literally as soon as I cracked the door, I just got like one bark out of him. Just one.
793.20s: What a crackhead.
797.28s: Yeah, so that's kind of the paper trading. Let me get caught up on the chat here.
800.56s: Roink Titties says hit the like for the YouTube YouTube algorithm. I'm an that's exactly right.
805.44s: Please do that. That's how we emerge from the depths of YouTube.
809.92s: Reese followed up on my ask on how new to options. Few years only just found out how bad vertical
817.28s: spreads are. Thanks for that. Curious if you dislike put credit spreads equally.
822.56s: Um, yeah, so here's the way I would think about verticals is in general, I avoid them like the vast
830.64s: majority of cases. There's not a solid reason to trade them. Now if there are smaller structural
837.68s: reasons why it might make sense for you to gain access via a vertical then so be it, but it's suboptimal.
845.68s: Like there's nothing that's generally optimal about a vertical spread. Everything that you
850.64s: attempt to take advantage of the whole point of a vertical spread is it dampens the risk profile.
857.60s: So yeah, in general, I'm not a giant fan of verticals. It's not the worst thing on planet earth,
864.16s: but it is not my go to now. There are ways you can bake in things like verticals that could make sense.
872.88s: So for example, something as simple as using verticals to buy the wings of something,
880.64s: so that you don't have unlimited risk in a direction that you don't want to have unlimited risk.
887.68s: Or if you have a small account and you need a way to decrease the margin requirement,
895.20s: that's okay to use a vertical for those reasons, but you have to know the tradeoff to that.
900.08s: The tradeoff is as you're doing that, you're losing efficiency on the underlying thesis that
906.64s: you're trying to trade. That's what that boils down to and that might be a tradeoff that you're
910.00s: willing to make. That's the most beautiful part about options is you get to structure things to be
917.84s: exactly what you want. So in this example, if you want a trade that you could put on,
922.48s: that gives you your directional disposition that you want, but you don't want to put on too much
926.80s: risk because you have a small account, you absolutely can make that tradeoff. You could have a
932.64s: slightly less optimal directional exposure position that has a lower capital requirement.
938.56s: You can do that. So yeah, it's not necessarily that I dislike one type of vertical over others
945.68s: in general verticals suck. And there's in time and place for everything. I trade verticals sometimes,
954.16s: but it's like if I'm trading something really explosive through earnings, those kinds of products,
960.48s: I'm generally going to cap risk. So if we take a look really quick at Nike, this is a great example.
968.88s: Because I know that they just fell off a cliff. So if we take a peek at Nike, they just dropped
973.52s: off a cliff. And let's say that we're looking through our earnings. And let's say that you see that
981.20s: they have a history of these kind of really big moves, right? Like take a look at these gaps
986.56s: from over here we went from 103 to 115. So a 12 point move. Here we go from 95 down to 83.
995.36s: Another 12 point move. Here we go from 89 to 95 to six point move ish. From here we go from 22
1004.96s: down to 08. Another massive move from here we go from 100 down to 93. So let's say for whatever
1012.64s: reason I wanted to trade Nike earnings. And let's say that I wanted to use short options to do so,
1020.64s: which to be clear, I think that would be a terrible choice in this product. I didn't trade earnings
1024.56s: for this exact reason. But let's just go under this assumption. You know that this thing moves a lot.
1030.16s: So depending on how the options are priced, if you take a look at the implied move relative to the
1036.56s: if you take a look at the implied relative to realize move and you look at enough instances where
1041.44s: the realize move exceeds the implied, you might say, okay, well, I might still think that there's
1047.92s: going to be excess IV, but if there's not, I don't want to get ran over. So maybe I will spread
1053.92s: this trade off. So in this case, you can trade something like the, you know, 30 delta short options
1061.20s: for a strangle, but then buy the wings so that if there is this big, outsized move compared to
1067.36s: the expectation, you don't get killed. Again, just a general, a general idea. And let me see really
1074.80s: quick. The, I think this came actually just within the expected move almost. Oh no, it definitely
1080.88s: didn't. My bad. It was expected at 5.7%. Came in at 19 point, it came in at 20%. Massive, massive,
1092.64s: misalignment on the expected move. That's crazy. So yeah, that's kind of a time and place that
1103.36s: you can use verticals. So to summarize all of that, I don't like verticals because they're generally
1110.24s: inefficient. That doesn't mean that there's never a time and place for them. I trade them myself,
1114.72s: myself seldom lay them, not regularly at all. Sometimes, sometimes it's the correct product,
1121.36s: so that's kind of the idea. YouTube's flashing that now would be a good time to insert ads.
1128.08s: They make it so easy. They're like, now would be a good time to insert ads creators earn more money
1132.64s: inserting ads. The more viewers are watching. Give it a try. I'm going to hit close because as I've
1138.32s: told you guys, I'm willing to forego the couple dollars or cents I can make by inserting an ad here
1144.48s: so that you don't have to deal with an ad because I don't like dealing with ads. So
1148.24s: back to this, that's an example where verticals might make sense. All right. Let me see up here.
1159.44s: John says I bought Nvidia the 16 hog 160 call and the IV is 51% seems high to me. I see. So
1173.12s: let's take a look at Nvidia. You bought a call. So IV percentile is 67%. IV ranks 49. IV's 51.
1188.08s: So the first thing is when we're looking at implied volatility, it's super important to
1193.52s: like when you're looking at an individual product to look at percentile or rank. I prefer percentile.
1199.36s: The reason why you need to do this is because to your point, if you say the IV is 51%,
1205.44s: it seems high to you, but you don't know what range is good. It's a completely smart question to
1211.04s: ask. And the fact of the matter is, as if somebody says the IV is 51, you have no idea. Like,
1216.32s: you literally have no idea if that's higher low. You know it's 51, you know the number. But the
1221.92s: reason why that matters is because implied volatility is very specific to an individual stock. So you
1227.52s: can have an individual stock like Nvidia where 51% IV clearly is high. It's 67%
1235.20s: tile. So that is high. But you can have other products that tend to have really high IV.
1241.60s: Let's see if this is a good example. It's not. Let me see of another one.
1247.20s: This is a great example. So if we take a look at GE, the implied volatility is 32%. That seems
1253.36s: really low compared to what we were just looking at. But if you look at the IV percentile, it's 81.
1259.60s: So that means on a relative basis, IV is super high for GE at 32%
1269.12s: that leads to this IVP being so inflated. So it's very relative to the product. So when I look at
1276.88s: your scenario in Nvidia, I think on a relative basis, it's expensive, relative basis, 67% IV.
1287.28s: So then if we go out to the 16-og 49 days out, it's 52%. So it's definitely cheaper than some of
1296.56s: the spot IV. So you make a little bit of a better world for yourself there. And then if we kill some
1303.36s: of these strikes, let's come into like 50. And you said you got the 160, which is super far out
1310.32s: of the money, which is, well, not super far, but it's pretty far out of the money. This is not my trade
1313.84s: at all. Yeah, so these are like a 10 delta. To me, this is going to be really expensive for what it
1324.88s: is. Because as you can see, these are a 51% IV as compared to something that's closer to
1330.80s: at the money, or even slightly in the money, which is like 48%. It's not a big variant. So you're
1335.20s: not getting killed here. But yeah, on a relative basis, this is slightly more expensive. The downside
1340.56s: to this is because this is all extrinsic value. Your premium now, your basis that you got in at
1346.24s: is going to be highly susceptible to moves in implied volatility. You can see that here represented
1351.60s: by Vega for those that don't know the Greek in this case Vega represents changes in implied
1359.28s: volatility and the impact on an options premium. So in this case, when implied volatility moves one
1366.40s: point, your premium will change by eight cents, which is not insignificant on a dollar 10 product.
1374.16s: So yeah, this will absolutely be quite susceptible to changes in IV. Now, the good part is if you get
1381.68s: a good move in your favor, it doesn't matter. You will be fine because the primary profit mechanism
1386.64s: for that long call is going to be direction. But the other downside to that long call selection
1391.76s: is because it's really far out of the money. So what that means is let's say we get a move in
1398.00s: Nvidia. Let's say Nvidia moves an entire dollar in our favor. Cool. We get a dollar move in our
1403.28s: favor. Your options are going to see 11 cents of that dollar. Your options are not going to see much
1409.36s: at all. And the more annoying point part is over the course of that same day, you're going to lose
1414.56s: five cents. So if you get your dollar move, you're going to see an 11 cent positive return.
1422.40s: You're going to see negative five cents come out of that 11 cents. It's not quite that discreet
1427.36s: to be very, very clear. But markets are closed. And I'm giving you kind of a linear example on how
1432.40s: these things tie together. And the other thing to keep in mind is if Nvidia goes up, its implied
1437.76s: volatility will likely contract. Volatility normally will contract as things go up. Do you probably
1442.72s: going to get hit by this Vega to some degree, which will decrease the premium of your options
1447.68s: that will work against you? So the trade can move if you get a big positive move in your favor.
1453.52s: That's essentially what that boils down to. That's not to say it's dead in the water. It's the
1456.88s: worst position, never enough like that. But it's just a lower probability trade. That's all.
1461.44s: Let me know if the answer is your question. Oh, shit. Here's the tough name.
1466.96s: Ruta Vega. That's hilarious. Ruta Vega is asking what the program. This is thinker swim.
1477.68s: And what cost says bro, can you show me how to place a limit order on the toss chart?
1484.88s: I don't actually use the chart itself personally, but there's a bunch of different ways you can
1489.52s: place limit orders. You can either open up the trade tab, which is just here. Let me shrink this
1494.32s: down just a little bit so you can see it on this side. You see where you can pull up the trade tab
1499.76s: or active trader so that you can trade it directly from here if you want. That's the wrong window.
1504.72s: But that's not what I do because most of what I'm trading is options. So options you need to go
1509.92s: into the options chain. And then here's the tough name. A frame. A frame. E. Brayhem. A frame.
1522.72s: Damn it. How do you say this? A frame. I'm going to go with frame. Can you tell me the difference between long and short
1531.28s: and option? Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I bet you somebody from the chat can tell you exactly what the
1536.64s: difference is. So I defer to you all knowing chat. What's the difference? You guys know the answer to that?
1547.36s: Short is selling long as mine. Bingo. That's exactly correct. So the way I would answer the question
1555.52s: is the difference between long and short and option is if you were long, it means you bought to open.
1563.12s: If you are short, it means you've sold to open. Now it can be a little tricky because here we go here.
1573.36s: It can be a little tricky because you can be long or short in option and simultaneously be long or short
1585.28s: the underlying itself. So the way to think about the concept of long and short is it applies to a
1591.04s: transaction as well as a disposition. So for example, if I buy a put, I'm long a put, but you can be short
1603.52s: the stock in that instance, meaning you want it to go down, puts make money as the underlying goes
1609.60s: down to be long a put short the stock. Now you can also be short the stock outright, which means you've
1616.00s: sold to open shares. You've borrowed shares and you shorted stock. So the tricky part with long
1622.24s: and short is it is a little bit context dependent. But the way to think about it to simplify it is
1630.08s: there's generally two broad context. I don't know if it's context or context. There's two contexts.
1638.40s: That sounds better. So there's two contexts. There's the transaction and then there's the
1645.76s: disposition. So think about it in that sense as well. That might help a little bit. Let me know if
1652.48s: that answers your question. Paulos says what happened to Nike bad earnings? They got murdered on
1660.24s: earnings today. They're really, really bad call. So they were, they beat on EPS. So they came in at
1669.68s: 99 cents versus 85 cents expected. But they got they got hammered. They bad call.
1678.24s: Ban of airplanes. That's awesome that you like airplanes. Can you please discuss covered calls in
1682.32s: the right time to utilize them? Yeah. I think the easiest way to think about
1687.44s: covered calls is when you want to collect premium on a stock. But you're okay if it gets called away.
1695.36s: That's the easiest way to think about it. You should not trade covered calls in something simply
1700.56s: because you want income from your stock, but you want to hold the stock. You create a problem
1706.24s: for yourself because sooner or later this it will get challenged and then you'll kind of get stuck.
1713.68s: Which actually going back to I don't know if we'll strat Joe's in here but shout out to my boy.
1719.04s: And we were going through an example for him a while ago where we were just doing a scenario where
1724.80s: we like started buying in here and we were trying to run through a perspective trade. Now there's
1731.36s: inverse and we didn't get to that point of his trade, but we can take a quick look at it. So we
1736.64s: did the scenario that he was selling cash secured puts for his weekly income. Then he gets assigned
1741.68s: in the underlying drops and drops and drops. He's not able to make any money on those short calls,
1746.32s: but he's trying to use the short calls against the long shares in order to make some sort of premium.
1750.96s: Sooner or later you get stuck because then you get a big pop in the underlying. Then that becomes
1759.76s: really difficult in this case to then try and manage that position. So the way to think about
1766.72s: trading covered calls is when you want to collect premium against an underlying that you hold.
1772.88s: You're okay sacrificing the upside and you're okay if the underlying gets called away.
1779.84s: So I have a video on a slightly better take on a covered call, which is this, which is a ratio
1790.48s: covered call where we maintain unlimited upside potential, which I actually think is really,
1795.04s: really important. So that's the general idea there.
1800.48s: Ethan says, been loving your vids learning a lot about how to read options and information.
1804.32s: That's awesome. That's actually what we're going to take a closer look at in a few minutes.
1809.12s: Paul says, can you somehow defend a covered call? Absolutely. There's a bunch of different things
1812.64s: you can do with a covered call. So the way to think about defending a covered call is I'm literally
1818.56s: doing it right now in, well, it's a ratio called diagonal. So it's not exactly a covered call,
1824.32s: but it's a similar concept, which is here in excess P. This is just another example trade I wanted
1830.80s: to share with you guys. We may or not have time for it, which is okay. But here's the punchline.
1836.24s: This strategy as I have it on now, it's using short calls. And right now I'm short.
1846.40s: Let's look at these. The Monday 549s. So let's pop over to excess P.
1854.72s: X S P. And here's the deal. So like I said, I have the short 549s for Monday. So typically,
1863.52s: what I'll do is I'll create an alert that is just below where my strike is. And you can always
1872.00s: buy the shares as it gets close to your strike so that you can unwind the part of the position.
1879.68s: You have to be careful with your accounting if it's life over 5.0. But that's a slick way to
1884.40s: let your short calls get called away. And then just use new underlying that you accumulated to
1890.16s: cover that. So that's one way you can defend the position. Another way you can defend the
1894.00s: position is to roll the options. But it's really difficult on the call side because you have to get
1900.08s: ready at some point to let it go. Because here's the deal. Every time you roll an option, you're
1906.56s: realizing the P and L of the existing trade. So let me grab this. I misspelled rolling. I accidentally
1913.92s: had a T on the end. This one. Right here. There you go. So in that video, it talks about the concepts
1929.04s: of rolling. And here's another one there that is about some of the myths around rolling. A lot of
1937.92s: people think it's like free money or a way to fix a trade. And it can help, but it can also hurt.
1944.48s: It's actually one of the most annoying things I see. All the ceremonial wagons are going in right
1949.36s: now for a Pahaska versus Poetan. But that's not what I'm here for. I'm here for to find. I was
1957.76s: going to look up rolling options. So I want to give you example of like bad things.
1962.56s: Okay. So and this isn't to talk smack about anybody to be clear, but like this, this video says
1973.20s: avoid losses by rolling options. It's it's functionally not true. When you roll an option, especially
1979.92s: if it's a losing trade, you're actually realizing a loss. So this is incorrect. This one says option
1987.36s: rolling strategy is free money. If you think that there's free money in the stock market,
1993.68s: that's grossly incorrect. This talks about just adjustments, right? So like you can adjust by
1998.80s: rolling options. That makes a ton of sense. This just talks about rolling. That makes sense. This
2002.56s: makes sense. All I'm highlighting is that there's a lot of terrible, terrible information out there.
2008.88s: Like this. Like this is again, it's just wrong. It's not avoiding a loss. You are absolutely
2015.76s: realizing a loss. Why the freak am I getting this? Yo, sometimes the YouTube algorithm is so
2023.68s: off. Maybe it's because I have a pimple on my face. Maybe that's it. Maybe the YouTube algorithm
2028.56s: is so sophisticated that it knows because I have a pimple that I need to see this supermodel
2034.80s: teach me how to do skincare and juicing. They teach you how to juice too. That's kind of cool.
2041.52s: Ise rolling. Yo, all right. That's a little using rolling options for huge profits is I would
2052.96s: consider to be ridiculous. You're not going to get huge profits by rolling.
2058.40s: Anyways, I think we can give her to this. The point I'm highlighting is that there are no shortage
2064.48s: of grossly, just terrible, terrible details around rolling options. Literally, let's look at
2072.72s: an example really quick. We can find a period. You guys want to pick a stock? Pick a stock,
2077.44s: any stock. Something with options though. We need something with options.
2082.56s: And I can show you exactly what happens.
2084.32s: GME. Let's do something else. GME, I'm always down, but we've done PLTR. That's cool.
2095.20s: I just did another video on GME today. So I want to look at something else. Let's take a look at
2099.36s: this good old PLTR. And let's zoom out. Let's find a good period to go back. Let's go here.
2106.08s: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at rolling options in balance here. We'll use
2113.36s: on-demand. We'll go back in time. And let's say that I use short calls. We'll do short calls.
2122.72s: And let's say that we do it somewhere in here. So I'm going to enter a trade on the 29th of
2127.84s: January. So we're going to pop into on-demand and we're going to go back to January 29th.
2133.12s: Now to be clear, I'm cherry picking a scenario on purpose where I know that this is going to go
2138.56s: up afterwards. This is actually a really effective way to get a sense of how something works,
2143.92s: both to the good side and the bad side. I find traders in general way too frequently,
2149.52s: only focus on the side of the trade that they want to happen. And it's a massive mistake.
2154.88s: It's literally one of the worst possible mistakes you can make. I call it, well, there's different
2160.56s: ways you can refer to it. It's kind of like Goldilocks analysis. It's just, yeah, way too focused on
2166.08s: what you want to happen. Okay. So let's say that we have shares. So we'll buy one Hyundai.
2173.36s: Actually, let's talk about, we'll do one Hyundai for the example. We got a nice good old fill on
2179.28s: our paper trading, which is great. And let's say that we go out like 30 days and we want to sell
2184.72s: in at the money call, because that's where we get a bunch of money. That's what a lot of people do.
2189.04s: And we'll click this. So we've just collected 135 bucks. Does the risk profile work in here?
2198.48s: It does not wait. Does it? It does not.
2203.76s: Summer. Well, if you guys are familiar with covered calls, the way that this risk profile would work
2209.68s: is this line would go up until 17 right here. And then it would go completely flat. So rather than
2216.88s: this upward sloping line, it would be zero slope straight this way like this. That's what it would be.
2225.92s: So now let's fast forward. We'll go fast forward a week. Take it out. Maybe a little over a week.
2235.84s: Come out here to five Feb. We gotta go a little further. Go to 12th. So what I'm doing is I'm
2245.20s: finding the period in time where it starts to kind of accelerate boom. And we have the 17 strike.
2250.24s: So we're way down here. So let's take a look at what rolling does. Florida kid says Robinhood shows
2258.32s: risk potential beautifully. That's actually probably the last possible thing that that platform can
2263.84s: do at all. I don't think Robinhood can do anything. Well, so I refute your point and my justification
2270.88s: for refuting your point is nothing other than pure fiery hatred towards Robinhood. So that's
2278.00s: the basis of my argument. It's pure reviewed. Yeah, they suck. Okay. Back over to this. We sold this
2287.44s: for, let me see, we have our position here. So we sold this for $1.36 now, it's trading at $7.97,
2297.84s: 98 cents. Here's what happens when we roll an option. And how annoying is that? If you take a look,
2304.88s: this is the problem with covered calls. You eventually get your pop in the stock whenever that is.
2310.16s: And you'll see that the PNL on the stock is $8.11, but you're losing $606 on the call. So you've now
2318.72s: assumed a position that has unlimited downside risk to zero. That you're taking that risk. You're
2325.76s: holding that risk, but you've now capped the upside. And you have no more upside potential beyond 150.
2334.00s: There's your max profit. That sucks. So now let's talk about this magic of rolling options. Let's
2339.52s: talk about how rolling an option is free money and limited money. Let's check it out. I'm going to
2344.80s: roll this option. The very first step to rolling the option is to close the existing one. So I'm going
2351.68s: to have to close this for $8.10. What happens when I click this button when I click the button,
2359.04s: I hit confirm and send what happens? It's very clear what happens. This trade will go away. I will
2368.48s: remove this from the portfolio. Then to complete the roll, we would open up a new trade further
2376.64s: out in time. So we'll go out to like this 32 days. Let's say we're trying to roll out in time.
2383.28s: Let's see what we can get for these 17s. You can get them for less than what you're going to have
2389.92s: to pay to exit this one. That's annoying, isn't it? Because you're typically told, well, I can roll
2396.32s: out. I'll be good or I can roll out and up and adjust my basis. Sometimes you can. There's
2403.04s: nothing wrong with rolling. I roll literally all the time. The trade I was going to show you in
2408.72s: XSP, I literally rolled it. The difference between my approach with options and other people, though,
2416.32s: is that I'm not so egotistical that I have to have everything framed so that it works in my favor.
2425.20s: I recognize when I roll this trade, I'm closing this 17 call out in one March for a loss.
2434.24s: It is a realized loss on my books. It's a realized loss. My account value will have gone down by $661.50.
2447.44s: Now, if you roll for a credit or let's say you can get to a credit, in this trade, you literally
2452.24s: couldn't even roll out here for credit. We have to go further. Let's check out this 39, see if we can
2456.72s: get to the 17. Probably not still. Let's go out to this 45, go to the 17. You might be able to.
2467.68s: So let's see. Let's say that we roll this. Boom. That's the first part of a rolling transaction.
2475.36s: It just happened. I just lost money. My account is now lower value than where I started.
2482.24s: What really gets people twisted is let's say I can roll for a credit. Let's say what I can get for
2487.60s: these. You can't even roll out here because they're mid at 802. I just closed these for, well, I guess,
2494.96s: $7.98. So if this gives me the mid, then we'll be okay. You know what's bad when paper trading doesn't
2504.88s: give you a fill. That's how you know your embed shape. Let's cancel this and let's see if we have
2514.16s: to go to like a main expiration. Let's see what we can get for these 17s. We need to sell here. We
2519.04s: should be able to get 825. This is a reasonable trade. Let's see if this goes through. Boom. Tell
2526.24s: you, you know your embed shape when you can't get a fill on paper trading. So we just got this for
2531.68s: 825. So what just happened in the account? Simple. The net liquidating value decreased by the value
2539.52s: of this option. It was already down, right? Realizing the trade doesn't all of a sudden make it happen.
2544.88s: Your net liquidating value represents what happens if you close everything right now. So your net
2549.36s: liquidating value was already down this $662. But now it's realized the position is closed. We opened
2555.44s: up a new position. You just collected $8.25. This is a credit, which is good. It means that this
2562.80s: position has the capability to cover the loss you realized on this position. But how much money
2571.76s: are we actually making here? Well, if we're getting these optimal fills, which we know we wouldn't
2577.68s: get in the real world, you're getting 25 cents plus what? Two cents, 26 cents is the overall credit
2585.60s: that you got between this trade. So that means you got $26. And now you've tied this money up for 67 days.
2595.12s: That doesn't seem like a great trade to me. I don't know. Maybe it is to somebody else. That's not
2600.72s: great. I'm not trying to tie up the entire position on this, taking unlimited downside risk,
2607.28s: having capped upside because I still don't have any upside profit potential beyond whatever the
2612.96s: 150 it is less than that. So it's just not a great trade. So, but that's what rolling is.
2623.60s: It's again, there's nothing wrong with it. The way that you reconcile rolling something like this
2630.32s: to complete the example is let's say we fast forward time two weeks. The first thing I would be
2636.80s: trying to do is roll is adjust this as soon as I could get out for reasonable profit, not even a
2642.96s: profit necessarily on the entire transaction just on this individual trade and see if I can get
2647.52s: just a little closer at the money. But what you're experiencing now is what I call expiration liquidity.
2654.08s: Because guess what? I just fast forwarded two weeks and take a look. I can now roll these for a decent,
2662.48s: this is great. In this position, I sold these for 825. I can buy them back for 695. This still
2669.20s: doesn't cover the cost, but I could technically take these in for a small profit and then try to
2675.60s: roll to something that's a little closer to the money. But guess what? I don't have expiration
2680.64s: liquidity. I have to go out now to 81 days if I want to roll this because I had to go so far out
2686.80s: on the first trade in order to get a credit. This is the problem with rolling. So now we have to sit
2692.00s: here and just hold this position. Now the other thing to keep in mind is you have to be very,
2696.32s: very careful with the accounting because the position that you have on now this 17 call in 19 April
2703.68s: will show a profit. It shows that you're making $130. But remember, this is a rolled position.
2711.12s: You're still not making money in the aggregate. A lot of people get confused on that. So they
2716.16s: think that their rolled option is now making money and it's like, oh, great. I make a money on this
2720.40s: rolled option. Everything's going great. But you need to make $662 on this position before you're at
2726.80s: break even let alone in profit on this new open position. So I'll take a pause there. See if you
2734.72s: guys have any questions on this concept in generality. And then I'll talk about kind of the reconciliation
2740.24s: phase of it. And in the meantime, I got to let my dog back in.
2756.40s: All right. So the real instructor is now made it into the chat. It looks like you guys don't have
2763.84s: any questions, which is good. So let's talk about how this eventually winds up. So in this position,
2772.32s: if I have this trade, I essentially just need to wait until we get out here. So our expiration is
2780.16s: 19 April. So literally, let's just go all the way to expiration here. The blink if he's right. Yo,
2788.32s: you got to look at them. You can't you'd be in a straight up baby here. I honestly thought
2794.40s: there he goes. There he goes. Can you blink? Does a lick count? Mr. Florida kid, does that work for us?
2804.64s: There we go. He's a sidekick, bro. He just hangs out in the bed right over here.
2815.28s: So now we're at expiration. This is actually a really, really great example. So in this case,
2822.48s: our options are still deep in the money. But we've gotten pretty far headway in this position.
2828.80s: And there's a couple things you can do here. I could tell you exactly what I would do. I would
2832.48s: not let these go here. What I would do is roll them again. So in this case, I sold them for $8.25.
2840.08s: They're now marked at $3.38. So in this case, we still haven't made our money back. We're up $488,
2847.84s: but we needed to make $662 to be up money. But I can tell you by how I know these work,
2854.40s: there will be an opportunity to roll here. So now what we need to do is see where we can get
2860.56s: the money for this trade. So in this case, it's made at $338. If we take this and we go out,
2868.00s: let's call it 28 days and see where we can get to $338. You can definitely roll here to the 17 DTE.
2875.12s: But you're getting really close to being able to roll up one strike. That one strike is super
2881.36s: important because that means now your capital gains is not capped at 17. It's now capped at 18.
2888.56s: So rather than making the few cents you would have made in this position, the 16 cents,
2893.92s: the difference between the 16, 84 and the 17. That was your capital gains in this position.
2898.56s: Now it's a dollar in that. So you just increase your maximum profit potential by quite a lot.
2905.44s: So what we need to go further out. So now we have to go out 35 days. Let's see if we can get to the 18s.
2912.56s: You are right on the cusp. I have to go again to the 42s, the 18s. You might be able to get it here,
2921.20s: probably not. We'll have to go out here to the 63. And notice just what happened there. We literally
2927.36s: had to wait. What was it? 50 or 60 days to make the 20 bucks that wasn't even the profit that was
2934.32s: fully realized. So now you have to roll it out another 60 days to potentially get your dollar.
2940.08s: What you can here now finally. So now you have a choice. Do you roll your option out to this strike
2948.40s: collecting about $3.55. You have to pay $3.40 essentially to close it. So you get 15 cents.
2956.00s: That means over the course of essentially 120 days, you would have made what you got 25 cents on the
2963.44s: first one on this one. We're getting 10 cents. Ish. If that 15 cents, she getting like 40 bucks.
2975.28s: You're getting 40 bucks to tie up this entire position and volunteer now for 120 days. That's
2981.04s: what you have to show for it. But here's the thing with rolling. People are so egotistical that
2987.20s: this idea of not having a losing trade is so important that they're willing to make the
2994.16s: objectively ridiculous decision of tying up money for 120 plus days to make $40 extra on the
3002.48s: premium here. It just doesn't make sense. Now the reconciliation is very simple though. If for
3008.24s: whatever reason, let's say the example is you really do want to volunteer long term. Well, a bunch
3012.48s: of things should be happening ready. You should have been buying more shares throughout this whole
3015.44s: thing. That gets into a whole other strategy outline. But in this specific example, there's really
3021.60s: two things we can do. We can either take this role or we can let the shares go because if you let
3027.60s: the shares go, you're going to unwind your 100 shares at this 17 handle. So you're not going to
3034.32s: collect much money at all. But the cool part is you will take the entire premium. So then you will
3041.52s: cover this previous role and you'll walk out at least with a few dollars to show for it.
3046.96s: That's the primary way that you can unwind this position. You can accept the fact that you made a
3051.60s: terrible choice by selling a covered call. That's really what that boils down to. Otherwise, you
3056.16s: could roll out another 63 days, adjust your basis slightly and continue the role, which you can do.
3061.68s: But you'll see my point again, you're tying up money for a really long time and you're not
3067.12s: making much money doing it. It's just not a great trade. That's what boils down to.
3076.00s: Shrej says, what's the flavor? Oh, yeah, you know it. So today we got mango orange on our
3081.52s: spindrift, which I actually just finished crushing. We might need a refill on that. And then
3085.68s: Shrej is on point with watermelon. That's exactly what we got. It's good old fashioned
3090.40s: crogr, crogr watermelon. It's one of my favorites. Watermelon is super, super good. I don't know what
3096.64s: it is about watermelon water. It's kind of refreshing.
3104.08s: I was right about the doctor ordered. All right. So let me know if that makes sense on the rolling.
3111.04s: I don't want to make it sound like I'm trashing rolling because I'm not. I roll all the time.
3116.80s: But you have to understand the context of what you're doing and the trade-offs thereof.
3121.68s: You can never get so obsessed with not being able to handle taking a losing trade that you just
3127.28s: roll forever. It's so dumb. It's so egotistical. You can be in this game either because you have
3134.72s: this strong urge to be right and your ego demands it. And for some people that can line up really
3140.00s: well with making a lot of money. Again, there's always exceptions. But for most of us,
3145.28s: that typically leads to losing a bunch of money. I always tell people do you want to be right or
3149.60s: do you want to make money? I care about making money. So what that means is I am wrong all the freaking
3154.88s: time. It's okay. That's how the business works. As long as you are able to constructively move
3162.00s: through your process, you can be wrong all the time and still be okay.
3165.12s: Santa Verre plane says, dude, yeah, he's a multi-poor. Now he's rolled up like a little tiny ball down
3174.00s: there. Policies the name rolling is a bit misleading. I don't know that it is. I feel like it's okay.
3182.32s: What's wrong with rolling? You're just moving something further out in time. That seems legit to me.
3191.04s: What's your beef with rolling?
3195.92s: I feel like rolling is chill. I am in the process of finishing our door dash order. We're being
3207.92s: unhealthy slabs tonight. We're going to do some buffalo wild wings. I don't know if you guys do
3213.52s: boneless or not. I like them both, but boneless is just easier to eat because you can just kind of
3218.88s: stuff them in your mouth. There we go. Jason says I'm rolling right now. How do boy? That's what we
3224.64s: love to hear. My dude out here enjoying. Enjoying his Friday. Perfect. Good. All right. So it sounds
3232.40s: like the rolling thing, which obviously was not the overall intention for the session today, but I think
3238.40s: it's a great question and I'm happy, absolutely happy to dive into it.
3244.88s: Zach says I get boneless, but they're not really wings, they're nuggets. I think that's exactly
3248.64s: right. That's what a great way to phrase it. Zach says, new to options. I have, hold on.
3260.48s: Fan of Airplane says, wait, how can you lose money selling covered calls? I thought the worst case
3265.12s: was selling your shares for the strike price. Yep. So the primary way that you can lose money selling
3274.64s: covered calls is if your strike is below your basis. So if we go back to another example
3283.44s: and let's go back to Teslux, we were just looking at this. So let's say that you were buying shares
3291.76s: here, you get assigned or you were selling puts get assigned and then the underlying continues
3297.04s: down, down, down, down, down. So your basis is way up here, but you're trying to sell calls against
3302.56s: your shares in order to make a few bucks. So as you're doing that, you're selling your short calls
3311.28s: lower than what your strike or than what your basis on the underlying is. That right there is how
3320.24s: you can lose money doing this. So what that looks like is, let's say your basis is up here at
3325.84s: 235, the underlying goes down, you're selling calls now all the way down here at 172, and sooner or
3332.88s: later it rallies up and out. You might not be able to roll fast enough to recapture your strike
3339.68s: price along with your underlying basis. And that's how you can get locked into a loss.
3348.64s: Zach says, new to options. I have some 19 and a half GME options expiring the 12th. How close
3354.00s: to expiration is the latest I should wait to sell if I don't plan to exercise. POS was 610, a piece.
3362.64s: Fan of Airplane says, got it makes sense. I want to sell cover call way above my basis. That's the
3366.72s: idea. But again, like sometimes if the underlying drops a lot and you still have the shares and you
3372.08s: want to sell calls, that's not always possible. The other thing is, again, I would highly recommend
3378.00s: checking out that video I posted earlier about ratio covered calls. I think not capping the upside.
3384.00s: Is just it's nonnegotiable essentially don't cap the upside on something that has unlimited downside risk.
3393.60s: It just doesn't make sense. Zach back to his question. How close to the expiration is the latest I should
3404.08s: wait to sell. And you have the 712 in GME. Let's take a look at 12. So the first thing here is I
3421.76s: would generally recommend trying to stay out of the weeklies as much as you can because they're
3425.92s: going to be less liquid. Now let's take a look at the 19 and a half. I like that these are in the
3431.76s: money. That's good. But these are also very liquid. Right. And the reason why I'm saying that is
3438.40s: they're 45 cents wide for something that's 19 and a half dollars. That's crazy liquid. So the way
3446.56s: that I would measure this bit asked spread is I sent is essentially you can take the width between
3452.80s: the bit asked spread and then divide it by the underlying price that kind of normalizes it. So in
3457.84s: this case, the width is worth $45. You divide that or we could do .45 divided by 19.5.
3468.56s: It's huge. It's literally huge. The spread. So in this case, I think these are just terribly
3477.84s: liquid options. This is not good. So looking at when I think when really comes down to a couple
3487.44s: things, how much you want to deal with the remaining extrinsic value. There's not that much. So what
3496.56s: this means is each day that you hold these, you're not really bleeding a lot of money. That's a normal
3501.28s: pretty significant input at this point. And other than that, it really you're so far in the money
3507.04s: at this point, it doesn't matter. You can hold it for as long as you want. There's no set rule.
3511.20s: I would focus more so not so much the time frame necessarily, but more based on what the underlying
3516.72s: does against your expectations. That to me is what I would way more heavily wait than kind of an
3524.64s: arbitrary time. Otherwise, the arbitrary time would definitely depend, depend quite a lot on how
3533.12s: much data decay is coming out of them. But you're so far in the money that it doesn't matter.
3537.84s: The other thing that you should check out from like my GME video series, if you haven't seen it,
3542.00s: I guess I can switch back to this one. If you haven't seen the GME video series, I did you
3548.08s: should check it out because I talk about this process of buying options a little bit smarter
3553.36s: for people. And I think that this also makes sense here.
3561.92s: Buying call options smarter. This is your video.
3567.28s: There you go. So that video will go through it a little bit more in detail.
3574.56s: Cool. Now let's take a look at, I think somebody had a question somewhere about the charts.
3583.44s: Okay. I went all the way back up. I had to catch up on a couple of these.
3595.84s: Okay, I got to go way back up my bad. I didn't realize I missed so many. My bad.
3602.48s: We talked about the covered call for Apollo. God says interesting activity in AMC, large dock
3608.48s: pool prints after hours. One for 16 million, 3 million shares might be worth a look at the options
3614.88s: chain. Yeah, we could take a look at that potentially. I'm not that I looked at it not too long ago
3620.32s: and it just wasn't doing much.
3624.72s: Roinktitty says intrinsic value still confuses me if you don't have the money to exercise shares
3630.00s: and they close in the money, how does that work? Yeah, well, in that case, you can,
3635.84s: one, you don't want that to happen. Let's be very, very clear. That's a terrible scenario.
3640.16s: And the reason why that scenario is terrible is for several reasons, but I think
3647.60s: for that specifically, you would want to exit the position before expiration. That is the
3654.40s: hands down correct answer in this scenario. Now let's say we're just talking about a hypothetical
3659.92s: your broker could do you with solid and float you the shares on margin until you can sell it
3666.64s: at market on Monday or if they can internalize the order and neutralize it for you and be homies,
3673.04s: they can do that. Or you could technically give them instructions not to exercise, but you would
3679.12s: lose all the money, which is a terrible idea. You do not do that. So the punchline to that is
3685.04s: just close it before expiration. That's the easiest answer.
3689.84s: Jay says, when you sell cover calls out a ratio, how do you balance downside protection with
3693.36s: how much of a ratio you go for? Yeah, it's a great question. Here's the deal. When you sell
3697.92s: covered calls or ratio covered calls, I would literally just not look at the short calls as
3703.36s: downside protection. It protects so little it offsets your downside so insignificantly.
3710.96s: So to me, I would literally just trade the chart as I typically would. So the way I would balance
3717.28s: downside protection is let's take a look at XSP. I have a ratio called the Agnel, which is a very
3722.00s: similar strategy is to cover call. I'm just using long options as compared to this case. Right now,
3726.80s: I have a stop set. Oh, it's an alert, but it's an initial stop that's set at 540 91. So that means
3734.40s: if XSP falls down to that, it means I'm going to exit the position. I will close the shares that
3740.40s: I will close the calls. That's how I manage the downside risk is by managing the trade.
3744.72s: The short calls offset such an insignificant amount of downside potential. I actually think it's
3750.80s: really bad mental association to think selling more short calls helps with your downside. It
3757.12s: doesn't actually help that much. I would just manage the trade.
3760.56s: The short option part of that really just adds a little bit of premium to the position. So you
3770.56s: can make a little bit more money. Re says broker will likely close the options before XSP if you don't
3776.72s: have to cash the cover. Yep. And if you don't have margin because you can go on margin, right? You
3780.72s: don't have to have the full amount of cash in order to take the position. Ethan says, can you go over
3787.92s: longer duration options maybe two to four months? Yeah, if you let me know what about them, you want
3792.96s: to go over. But yeah, Leonard says, what's the longest you've held an option before? That's a good
3798.96s: question. I honestly don't know. I would have to imagine definitely over six months, but I'm not
3806.24s: sure if I've actually held a single option for longer than a year without actively like moving the
3811.36s: position. Let's see. I'm just catching up on the rest of the comments to make sure I didn't miss you
3826.72s: guys. Good, good, good. Ruta Begis says selling calls is a bearish play. You should lose if the stock
3839.76s: goes up. No, no, not not necessarily. So the reason why is because of an offsetting position.
3845.92s: It's a great question, really, really great question. You're doing a good job analyzing it. So
3851.12s: when you're and I'm sorry, let me take a step back on the on the short calls you absolutely do
3856.64s: lose money if it goes up. That's actually the entire example that we just saw when we went through
3860.96s: this. Now the scenarios that we're talking about is in the context of a covered call, which means
3868.64s: that you have long shares that offset the deltas. So take a look. Does this show up for you guys?
3874.80s: It might be a little too low. Let me see if I can put up just a little bit. So you'll see down here
3884.40s: that the delta on this position, the long shares give me their one delta. Each share gives you
3890.24s: one delta, right? Pretty easy. So if we have 100 shares, you have 100 deltas. The underlying when you
3897.36s: sell calls will have less than 100 deltas. And then sooner or later, if you fall far enough in the
3902.88s: money, they will essentially become also negative one delta. So then at some point, they offset one
3909.76s: another for a one-for-one basis. So that's why you can sell calls against your shares and not have
3918.00s: risk to the upside because the long shares offset the risk. I, J5D looks like you're bouncing
3929.20s: great to see you. Take care. That's a hell of a name. A6B. When selling strangles, do you ever
3936.08s: double down on the losing side or how do you defend it or adjust? That's a great question. That
3940.56s: depends entirely on the trade. And that's all stuff that's defined ahead of time. There are some
3946.88s: strategies that I run that are way more mechanical. So like anything zero DTE, two DTE, weekend
3953.28s: plays, stuff like that. And in those instances, it's very programmatic. Once I hit a certain P&L,
3960.48s: I close the position, re-center it if I want, and then roll from there. It's essentially what I
3964.40s: did today. There are other positions where I might be trading variants for premium, which I have a
3969.76s: bunch of those plays on right now. I think one of them is an example on the on the blackboard.
3975.12s: And those I'm more willing to adjust, but I typically will adjust before something goes way too far
3982.96s: in the money. But the process of doubling down, I don't think that's a good idea. Now, that's not
3987.68s: to say that you can't scale it into a trade if that's part of your plan, but the way that you're
3992.16s: framing it tells me that we would be just scaling in because it's losing, and that's not a great
3997.04s: reason to do that, in my opinion. So, no, I would pretty much avoid doubling down.
4006.72s: The working investor, when selling covered calls below your basis, do we select a 16-deltar or less,
4013.36s: so at least one standard deviation from the expected move? I would focus less on that, and I would
4021.76s: focus more on where would you be okay fighting the position? That's what it comes down to.
4027.28s: And the other thing is I would be very, very actively managing that position. As soon as it
4032.24s: starts getting challenged, I would be trying to roll it out as little in time as I can and getting
4036.96s: it as far out of the money as I can each time. The reason I go as little far out in time as I can,
4041.84s: because sooner or later you run out of expiration liquidity. You're able to roll out seven days,
4046.48s: then another seven days, then another seven days, then another seven days, and so on and so
4050.80s: fun, until you get out here, and then it starts going from 49 to 84 to 112, it starts opening up a lot.
4058.64s: So, I want to maximize my runway as best as I possibly can, so that's one of the broad ideas
4067.20s: with that. So, yeah, I think the easiest answer in general is avoid doing it, avoid selling
4076.16s: calls below your basis, because that tells you something has gone wrong, and in my opinion,
4081.44s: where that would really become a scenario is when you're holding a stock too long, that's not
4085.68s: doing what it should be doing. That's like the, I don't know the way I would think about it.
4090.40s: That says when choosing to buy calls, am I correct that one of the things to look at is the IV
4097.20s: and high IV is good, not necessarily. When choosing to buy calls, the primary profit mechanism is price
4104.48s: direction. So, the main thing I would be looking at is something moving in your preferred direction,
4109.20s: more than anything, much, much less so, about whether or not IV is high, IV in that scenario is kind of
4116.80s: like a secondary function, I think. So, yeah, I think that's the way I think about that.
4125.44s: Let me know if that answers your question. I'm updating.
4130.00s: Quick.
4140.96s: Alfred says, if you have a leap option that's up, say 200% or more, would you hold herself?
4145.92s: I would define where I wanted to go before entering the trade. Again, it's not about how much
4152.00s: something is up or down, it's not about really any sort of arbitrary figures. When you're trading
4159.04s: options in this scenario, Zack says that answers perfect. That's what we love to hear. When you're
4164.72s: trading options directionally like this, at least for me, I'm trading a specific profit mechanism
4170.08s: and then the option is just the vehicle. So, what that means is, let's say I'm trading,
4177.20s: let's do like Wells Fargo. And let's say I'm trading leaps that I bought back in
4185.68s: February or even better, January. So, let's say that I have really long dated options that are
4192.80s: way, way out here. And let's say that I bought them with the expectation of Wells Fargo.
4199.68s: Let's see what it would have looked like at the time. I'm just like picking an arbitrary place
4203.44s: that I think I might have selected. So, we would have got it somewhere in here. Yeah, I would have
4209.04s: no idea. There's nothing to look like it's been up here before. But let's just say that we pick
4213.04s: a number. So, it's at 46. Let's say that for whatever reason you think it's going to go to 55.
4218.64s: And we'll draw a line here. 55. And let's zoom in. So, here, if we got in down here when it was at
4231.68s: 46 for whatever reason and you think it's going to get to 55, what I would do in that scenario is
4238.56s: in no way, say, okay, my long options are up. Let's call it 200%. It's doing what I want. Let me close
4246.56s: this position. What you're exhibiting in that scenario is a really well-known trader behavior shortfall.
4255.44s: And it's a component of the disposition effect. It's where we have a strong mental preference,
4260.96s: a cognitive preference, to close winning trades because we like that sensation. But we tend to close
4268.48s: them too fast. And then we let losing trades run because we don't like the sensation of realizing
4275.60s: loss. So, in this case, the way that I would think about it is not if my option is up X percent,
4281.28s: if I'm trading long calls directionally, that's the only other reason to trade long calls is for
4285.44s: a directional thesis. I'm going to craft my directional thesis first. The profit mechanism comes
4290.96s: first, then the structure and strategy. So, if the profit mechanism is directionally for whatever
4296.72s: reason, I think it's going to go up. It comes up here to 55. From there, I say, okay, I'm going to
4303.36s: follow it. And I'm going to set a stop below wherever I think near term support might be. Let's
4308.48s: call it right here at 5424. So, regardless of what my long option is doing at this point, it
4314.88s: doesn't matter. What matters is what the underlying is doing. So, then I say, if it crosses below here,
4319.84s: I'm going to get out. If it doesn't, I'm just going to let it go. So, now it rallies back up.
4324.80s: So, then what I do is I don't just say, well, okay, my stop was way down here. What I'm doing is I'm
4329.84s: following the trend to capture profit. Now I might say, okay, I'm going to wait for the short term
4335.28s: moving average to flatten. And I want to see a midterm moving average also turn to a negative slope.
4343.12s: Then if it continues sideways or starts to go down from there, I'm going to get out. So,
4349.12s: where does that happen? Or you could just slowly move up your stop into the next periods that you see
4355.52s: some sort of supporter resistance. But the total point I'm trying to make here is that it can't be
4361.44s: this arbitrary thing. My option changed price. It is everything to do about whatever your profit
4367.68s: mechanism is in how you capture that. That's what matters. So, let me know if that answers your question.
4379.28s: Ruta Begis says, let's say I'd like to buy 100 shares of some stock at a certain price.
4384.08s: Wouldn't it be better to sell cash-covered put with that strike rather than buying it out right? No,
4389.20s: not at all. That would not inherently be better.
4395.44s: Mr. Ruta Begis, why do you think I say that? Why do you think it would not be inherently better?
4404.48s: Any ideas? Or anybody else?
4414.64s: There's a very specific reason.
4422.88s: No guesses so far. That surprises me. Also, shout out to you guys. We have 60 people in here.
4428.32s: I think this might be the biggest stream I've had. Which is absolutely awesome.
4432.88s: I love the fact that so many people are interested in learning about options on a Friday night.
4438.96s: Ruta Begis says, I thought I'd get the 100 shares at that price anyway, plus the premium. Yep.
4443.76s: So, what are you doing right now? It's the thing that we talked about before. You're focusing on
4448.16s: the scenario that you like. So, talk to me about the bad scenario. When would this be bad? When
4455.92s: when this hurts you? Jay says, if the underlying moves too far down, not necessarily, you would have
4460.64s: the same downside risk as the long shares. Big A says, selling the put doesn't give the upside
4466.56s: potential. That's way more close to being correct. There's a very specific reason.
4472.72s: Think of it this way. What if we think Wells Fargo is going to go up and let's say in this scenario,
4478.64s: there you go. Ruta Begis got it. If price goes up and I don't get anything, that's exactly right.
4484.24s: So, this is the wait for a pullback thing. So, in this case, let's say that you think it's going to go
4490.16s: up. You do all your analysis. You have a bullish thesis. So, you think you're going to be really slick
4494.48s: and sell a put in order to acquire the position. What happens if it goes up? What happens if it does
4501.84s: what you want? Well, now what? Do you wait? You made money on your put. That's awesome. But now,
4507.76s: it's more expensive than where you wanted it before. So, now do you buy it when it's even more expensive
4512.24s: or do you try selling another put and see if you can get it with the premium on that one? Well,
4517.52s: then what happens if it doesn't come back? You've now placed a series of limited profit trades on
4524.24s: a thesis that turned out to be correct and you have nothing to show for it because you were being
4529.60s: too cheap and you didn't want to pay up for the position and you're trying to get it at a
4536.24s: discount via short put premiums. Now, again, everything has a middle ground that doesn't mean it
4545.04s: never makes sense to sell puts. But what it does mean is that if you're using cash-secured puts
4550.40s: to acquire a position, you also should be ready to just buy shares outright when it makes sense.
4557.60s: So, that's the way I would think about that.
4564.08s: A fan of airplanes, it's a good question. Can't you collect premium immediately? Yeah,
4567.84s: you collect a premium immediately, but it's tied to an open trade. So, it's essentially, you're
4574.48s: just essentially being like an escrow account. It's still tied to an open trade. Great questions.
4581.52s: Let's get rid of these. Let's take a quick look at these other questions.
4592.80s: I want to make sure that I have a chance to hit these. Uh-oh. We got to move these out here.
4605.68s: Well, that's perfect for Pollock's. I think we spent a while talking about defending positions.
4608.88s: That's perfect.
4614.08s: The end of airplanes says, my thinking would be it only makes sense to sell puts if you think
4617.52s: a price is going down. Well, why would that make sense? If price is going down, that's the wrong
4623.20s: direction. If you're selling puts, it's a bullish trade. You want it to go up. So, why would you sell
4630.56s: puts, which is a bullish position and want something to go up if something is going down?
4634.88s: Now, over to this, to big K says, how do you find companies to trade options? Yeah. Well,
4643.44s: you can scan. That's the easiest way. So, if you come in here and you look at different scans,
4648.88s: you can look things that are optionable and have weaklies. This is like a very
4653.84s: intense premium scan that I use. So, all of these things have options and they have weaklies.
4658.48s: That doesn't mean I'm going to trade all of them. Some of them won't be liquid or whatever,
4662.40s: but that's the easiest way is to start with scanning. Now, to the broader question I think you're
4668.48s: asking is like, how do you find trades? That really comes down to what profit mechanism you're
4673.84s: trying to transact against. And that's the very, very, very first step bar none. So, let me find a
4680.32s: video for you on scanning for options trades. There you go. That video will go pretty far in a
4690.08s: detail on that. Lord, it says people think it goes down. So, you sell the put because you know,
4696.48s: it's going to go up or consolidating it at worst. Yeah, but again, the yeah, exactly. It's kind of
4702.64s: a broken mindset. The Anavair plane says, my thinking that would make sense if you sell puts
4712.72s: everything prices going down to acquire shares. The problem with that is again, why would you want
4718.72s: to acquire shares and something that's going down? This again is kind of the propensity for our mind
4725.52s: to try and focus on like the positive aspect of something, but not the total aspect. Because
4733.84s: in that scenario, could you sell a put that then you get assigned at and then something runs up
4738.72s: and out and you got it at a great price? Sure, that could happen. But at the very base of things,
4744.80s: why on earth would you want to acquire shares if they're going down? For me, it's a function of
4751.04s: waiting until the shares are doing what I want them to then I will entertain entering a position
4757.92s: whether it's to shorter to go long. But there's no reason to try to get in while it's moving because
4762.80s: we think that it's kind of smart or slick or like a way to be cheaper. I just think that you end
4768.64s: up losing way more money that way. Rudevega says, very informative. I'm glad I found the
4773.76s: channel. That's awesome. Yeah. The thing is is I know what I know, right? Like I know my skill set
4779.60s: and I know that a lot of retail traders struggle. So I think one of the main reasons why I do this
4788.24s: stuff is because people get surrounded with what I consider to be really bad, like really bad
4796.16s: information unfortunately. So yeah, I love doing this stuff. Trace says, shout out to the free
4802.16s: discord.com hangout. Yeah, everybody you know that we have a completely free discord to join
4808.72s: that everybody is welcome into. Let me grab a link to it. I think this one only lasts for like seven
4814.72s: days. But yeah, come on in if you want to hang out and chat more options. We're always here.
4820.80s: All right, let's get to this one. Do a tutorial about bold put spreads and call debit spreads.
4830.24s: How to find the entry and exit point and how to select strikes DTE. Yeah. So actually I would not do
4836.48s: this personally. I would not trade these spreads. But the short answer to this is actually quite simple.
4842.96s: To find the entry is entirely dependent again on the profit mechanism. You have to start with the
4848.40s: profit mechanism. Traders make the same mistake all the time. They're worried about all of these
4855.12s: ancillary details. But again, the entry and exit point is not based on the options. It's based on
4861.76s: the underlying theme and the disposition towards the underlying. So that's the first part.
4866.88s: Then selection of strikes come down to what risk profile you want for your spreads. That also will
4875.04s: very, very tightly tie into the width of your spreads. And then days expiration again comes down to
4881.92s: that standard selection process based on the balance of how long you want to trade open,
4888.08s: how much money that you will collect in this case for the bold put spread. The call debit spread
4896.32s: is kind of inverse of that because we're paying. So then this comes down to how much theta do you
4902.00s: want to decay out? Stuff like that. You long sons. Can you define profit mechanism as you think about
4908.80s: it? Yeah, definitely. I think I have a video that talks about that which one I think this one.
4922.80s: I think this one's it. But the so that will just go further in a detail. But the way to think about
4932.16s: profit mechanism is really simple. It's the thing that makes money. It's the part of the trade
4937.92s: that actually makes money. So the first thing you can kind of remind yourself is options are literally
4944.00s: just tradable vehicles. They're just things we can trade. They need some sort of condition to make
4952.16s: money. That's the profit mechanism. So whatever that condition is that yields profit is the profit
4960.08s: mechanism. So a simple profit mechanism. If you want something to go up, that's a profit mechanism.
4969.04s: Something goes down. That's a profit mechanism. Implied volatility trending over realized volatility.
4974.88s: Variant source premium. That's a profit mechanism. Momentum premium. That's a profit mechanism.
4979.92s: All these different things that actually yield profit is the profit mechanism. Options and then the
4988.96s: various structures and strategies. Those are simply how we're attempting to capture the profit mechanism.
4996.64s: So if you're trading again, for example, let's take a look at one of these. I have a bunch of
5003.12s: these on right now. Well, we have this one on right now. BY&D. I'm trading a variance risk premium
5009.20s: play in here, which means I'm trading the persistence of implied volatility over realized volatility.
5014.40s: Why am I doing that? Very, very simple because implied volatility continues to trend a lot
5021.92s: over realized volatility. So what is my profit mechanism? Variant risk premiums. That's how this
5028.64s: trade makes money. How do I capitalize on that? I can trade short straddles. I can trade short
5033.68s: strangles. I can trade iron butterflies. I can trade short iron condors. Those are all different
5040.56s: ways I can capitalize on the profit mechanism. But the mechanism is that in and of itself.
5047.68s: Elon Slong says so it's the root of your thesis. Yeah, I think that's a fair way to think about it.
5053.12s: I think the way I would define it is it's the modality whatever your thesis is. It's the modality
5062.88s: that your thesis makes money through. So you can have a thesis that a stock is going to go up
5067.92s: down sideways or whatever. But whatever you think will lead to profit or what is the actual
5075.36s: function that leads to profit is what I would consider the profit mechanism. That's a good question.
5083.52s: All right, so let's take a look at a few things. We actually talked about option liquidity.
5090.88s: We already talked about expiration liquidity. When we talk about expiration
5098.96s: volatility, when we're talking about volatility with options, there are really a bunch of
5106.24s: different kinds. We talked about that in a bunch of the earlier videos. So I want to focus a little
5111.12s: bit more on these different volatilities for explorations and what that can mean. So as we know,
5117.76s: implied volatility is forward looking. And we know that it's tied to a specific time frame.
5124.80s: So as things have different amounts of time to work, we tend to expect larger moves over that time
5131.36s: frame. But you'll notice interestingly enough that you can have things that are further out in time
5139.52s: that have a bigger expected move than something that has higher implied volatility.
5145.36s: Right? So in this case, this is 140 DTE or something like that or 49. Maybe this is the 140.
5153.28s: And the IV here is 133 with a 5.5 dollar expected move. But if we go further out, this is a 16 dollar
5162.64s: expected move, but this is only 115% vol. Why? Anybody have any ideas? Why that would be the case.
5172.24s: Think about what volatility measures. It's variance over time. So in this case, when we look at this,
5188.56s: this is expecting relative to this time frame, a bigger move relative to the time frame.
5196.88s: That's why you will see expiration volatility move like that. Now you can use this for a lot of
5201.44s: things. It's very informative. You can trade the difference between these different expiration cycles.
5207.92s: Rudebeggus says more time close, but it's kind of it's not just that, right? Because if this has more time
5215.20s: and this has a bigger expected move,
5221.60s: FantaVarePlan says maybe you're getting this now, but would love an overview of how to evaluate
5226.40s: options potential upside. That's probably better suited for the first or second video in this series.
5237.68s: We went through basic option structures that talk about the upside potential. So I think that would
5244.40s: be a good place for you to start if you haven't seen those. Alan says better chance of something that's
5249.28s: going to happen. Yeah, so you guys are correct in terms of your perception of the implied move as a
5254.96s: dollar amount. So in this case, we can see that the dollar move here is $16. It has more time to move.
5260.96s: What I'm highlighting though is that there are shorter duration trades that have a smaller
5267.76s: implied move as a dollar amount, but a bigger IV meaning implied volatility. Again, so here,
5275.36s: the expected move is only $2.73 out here at $16. But out here implied volatility is 115%
5284.00s: and here it's all the way up to $139.5%. So this is because of what I was talking about,
5295.68s: the expected move against a relative time frame. That's why you guys are absolutely right.
5301.84s: We expect things to have a wider range the further out you go, but implied volatility is relative
5306.96s: to time frames. This is the problem. This is why that is.
5312.72s: Ruin Titty says the less people trading it longer out. That's part of it, but that's not the nut shell
5319.28s: of it. What again, what this means is that out here, even though it's really long duration,
5326.00s: this has a smaller relative range to this time frame. That's all.
5331.36s: So we can use these expiration cycles a hunt for different opportunities. We can look for periods
5339.60s: where this is at 234%. This one's down at 112. This one's at 100. This one's at 117. So once you
5346.96s: develop relationships with products and models, you can trade the relative volatility of different
5352.00s: time frames. You can also look for events that are coming up. Why does this go from 100 to 117
5360.24s: back down to 102? Why is that? Typically, that means that there's some sort of announcement coming out,
5365.92s: some sort of news release could be earnings. Earnings in here is not until the 5th of August.
5371.44s: So it's something else that's doing it. I just don't know what. But if we keep going out,
5376.00s: we now know that earnings in the 5th of August, but let's take a look at the expiration cycles that
5381.36s: capture that. Notice how implied volatility goes from 90 to 140. This is clearly a massive expansion
5389.60s: in volatility. And it's because this expiration cycle encapsulates that earnings release.
5397.68s: So you can learn a lot by looking at just this. The other thing you can do is plot the implied volatility.
5405.44s: I like to use out of the money options. Jason says this volatility correlate with liquidity,
5412.16s: definitely. So volatility has an impact on liquidity. You need enough volatility for a market to
5419.60s: be active. But if you have a market that has too much volatility, it decreases liquidity. So
5427.04s: there's definitely a relationship between those high volatility actually becomes kind of like a
5432.48s: natural stock market circuit breaker. Spreads get really, really wide when volatility comes in super high.
5443.04s: Sunny says, BYND is a meme play by the way. I don't understand. What do you mean for what? For this?
5461.04s: And so anyways, you can also look at a volatility smile down here. So let's take a look at something
5466.64s: like Apple. This has a pretty standard volatility smile. Now this will be a little confusing because
5473.44s: they're all squished down. But essentially, this is just looking at the implied volatility for all
5478.08s: of the out of the money options. This gives us an idea of if the market is pricing in things to
5482.80s: the downside, to the upside. Sunny says a lot of hype for another squeeze play soon. Oh, I see.
5489.92s: Yeah, I think the problem honestly with those kinds of things to be honest is like, you have to be
5494.56s: careful with at least for me, I trade things as they are. The theories and stuff like that I find
5502.16s: really interesting, but they're not bullet proof, unfortunately. So like this week originally was
5509.60s: supposed to be some sort of big massive week and it turned out to be absolutely nothing. So I think
5514.80s: squeezes are interesting, but the way that I trade them is when they're happening. I'm not trying
5520.16s: to front run them personally and it's because I know that I can't time them that well. I don't
5524.32s: try to front run pretty much anything. So yeah, a slightly different approach there. But anyways,
5531.20s: back to the volatility smile, where we see higher implied volatility is where the market is pricing
5536.08s: in movement. That's the way to think about that. There's a lot of different ways that you can
5539.92s: navigate through this options chain and learn all different kinds of things. If you look through
5543.52s: the recent series I've been doing on the daily with things like GameStop, you actually have a pretty
5549.76s: cool visual of me applying a lot of this analysis. Let me grab the playlist to that. Actually,
5560.40s: I just grabbed the most recent video. I think they're all linked in there.
5566.24s: This one, this one's this one's pretty good. This one's talking about Chewie and GameStop because
5571.20s: some interesting activity between both of those actually. All right.
5583.76s: Peter says don't think Eric is playing Squeeze, VRP. Yep, that's exactly right. In BY and D, at least.
5590.00s: Because I can for for my visual, I can see a very clear, persistent, high elevated implied volatility
5602.48s: relative to realized. So that's literally all I'm trading. If there's some sort of squeeze between
5608.56s: these cycles, which you can see them like it's a thing, but this one was tied to earnings.
5613.04s: And then this one came not so different after earnings slightly different. So this one's a
5616.88s: little more anomalous, I think. But yeah, even these squeezes, which is funny for my style
5623.60s: strategies, it wouldn't even hurt me in these products. And it's because there's so much volatility.
5628.72s: Right. You can see where my stop is up to the upside, 867. So even if we get one of these
5634.56s: squeezes from a relative basis, which here, it's essentially a full point higher. So this squeeze,
5640.08s: you can move it down from 878 down to 778 on a relative basis. And it would still be well within my
5645.52s: range. So yeah, this is just very interesting. I'm looking at K. R. H. says what broker platform,
5653.36s: this is think or swim. It's actually so crazy to me that so many people don't know what this is,
5659.52s: which is not your guys's fault. Right. It's just a change of what people use now. But I've used
5664.72s: this literally my entire trading career. So it's so novel to me that everybody is so used to
5670.56s: using other products because this was like the only show in town for a while between this and
5676.32s: interactive brokers. Like those are the primary things you could use previously for quite a while.
5683.44s: All right. It sounds like my Buffalo Wild Wings just got here. But I don't have to hop off just yet.
5689.52s: If you guys have any last minute things that you want to take a look at, let me know. I'm down.
5693.68s: Oh, no, it's not I lied to you. It's not my dinner. We have plenty of time. Or is it? No,
5702.00s: we have plenty of time. I completely lied. There was my wife, not. I don't think cannibalism is on
5708.08s: the docket. Allens says if you have the money to buy a lot of shares at one time, how much time
5716.32s: does a market at what? How much time does a money maker have?
5724.08s: Alan, you're you're questioning are you talking about market makers?
5730.24s: So they they have a standard process for settlement.
5737.76s: So yeah, they they have quite a while.
5744.48s: Other working investors says can sell options on futures on thinkors? Yeah, definitely.
5749.12s: So if we take a look at a futures contract, we take a look at the eminies.
5755.52s: And we pop over here to the trade tab. You can see that it has the futures contracts,
5760.40s: which are Delta one products. And then it has the options relative to them all the way down here.
5766.32s: So yeah, absolutely.
5770.00s: So he says, can you shut in the lay on the dark pool data, particularly all the high premiums
5774.16s: in the Russell indices placed after hours? Yeah. So dark pools are interesting because I think people,
5780.96s: I want, I don't think the name helps it. But I think people are kind of well, at least retail traders
5787.76s: are very regularly looking for like a buggy man, like a place where the evil stuff is happening.
5793.28s: And there's a really great book on this. This one right here, dark pools.
5799.60s: And I've read it before. I've just downloaded it again to Kindle because I want to read it again.
5804.72s: But you can learn a lot about how dark pools actually transact.
5809.76s: The long story short is it's important to understand their impact on the markets.
5814.40s: And they do have an impact on the markets. But it's also not necessarily this evil place.
5822.00s: Although it is absolutely too obscure in my opinion. Like I think the fact that it's not
5828.56s: as transparent, I don't like that. But I also understand and recognize the impact it has on
5837.12s: market liquidity and stability, which is a thing. So all I'm trying to highlight there is it's not
5842.56s: all bad. A lot of people want to demonize something. And it has a lot of bad aspects. As I mentioned,
5848.08s: I'm not a giant fan. I would love some pretty significant reform of them. But they're not all bad.
5855.04s: Rointitdy says it suppresses prices. It does. It absolutely does not help with price discovery.
5861.60s: But if you're looking at when price discovery occurs, it is on lit exchanges. And if you compare
5873.28s: where the dark pools are transacting at, it's typically not at super advantageous prices relative
5880.64s: to market price. So I agree with you. It's not helping with price discovery. But it's also not
5888.08s: this place where people are getting crazy, great steels on every single trade they put out.
5893.92s: It's yeah, I think the other thing to keep in mind is giant block orders can be really difficult
5901.92s: to move. And they can really hurt liquidity to some degrees. So I think by decreasing some of
5908.96s: that, there is a small positive. Again, it's all relative. I'm not advocating for them or against
5914.24s: them. But I can clearly assess that there is pros and cons to them is all. So yeah, I'm not really
5922.88s: sure that that is necessarily shedding a lot of data per your question, Sunny. But yeah,
5930.88s: Peter says is dark pool data free? I don't know if it's free. I have right now I'm doing like a
5937.12s: test with unusual whales because I might be becoming affiliate for them. If you guys like the
5942.48s: product, that's the main reason why I would honestly do it is and I've told them this too. I
5947.12s: think the tools cool. They have like a neat user interface. But I don't really, I don't really use it.
5956.48s: I typically import most of my stuff.
5958.32s: Florida kids says all data is free to an extent usually just yeah and it also depends on the
5966.96s: kind of data because tons of trading data is not free at all, but I get your point. But anyways,
5972.32s: this is these are dark pool orders. So you can see let's see this let's find something that went
5978.80s: through let's use Apple here. So Apple had a 2000 share position come through at 21170 and this
5990.64s: was at 1700. So let's take a look at Apple. Like they you see what I mean, they didn't get some
5999.04s: steel of a price. It came in at a dollar over where it's at now. Now they might have moved the
6006.72s: market. I don't actually don't think for a trade that size. It's not even that big of a trade.
6010.16s: I don't think for a trade that size that it would have moved too much. But that's not like some
6013.68s: sort of super advantageous position for them. The main thing is they got liquidity. That's the thing.
6019.68s: So yeah, it's it's important again, it's important to be aware of dark pools, how they behave, how
6026.08s: they transact. But I think it's just important for retail traders to do our absolute best to
6031.60s: remain as objective as possible and as we're analyzing these different components. I think
6037.68s: the fact that they're not more transparent is frustrating. I don't like that. I don't like that
6042.32s: you have to have these different kind of tools to access the data. That's just shitty. So I'm not a
6047.68s: fan of that. I think all of this should be on blast for everybody to see. But it does serve
6054.64s: somewhat up a perfect at the same time. Let's see. Back up. Donaldson says I'm just now getting
6067.28s: an alerting max pain. Can you explain it if it has max importance? Yep, I have a video on it for
6071.36s: you. It's not that important is what it boils down to. It's again, it's another example where retail
6077.36s: traders are kind of trying to find a bogeyman. And again, it does happen. I do think that there is a
6082.24s: level of market manipulation of prices very close to things. But market makers overall are at
6088.96s: the behest of order flow. So they can influence pricing. They cannot drive pricing all over the place.
6097.20s: Because if persistent order flow comes in in a specific direction, they literally are slaved
6102.40s: to it. They can't they can't change it. There's subject to order flow. So that video there is about
6109.36s: max pain. Peter is laughing because I use the video game cover in the title, because I thought it
6114.96s: was hilarious. But yeah, so max pain is a tendency or this theory that people think that
6123.60s: market makers manipulate markets as it gets closer to wherever the highest dollar value of options
6130.96s: will expire worthless. So you can take a look at, John says, yeah, exactly what I was thinking,
6138.56s: market makers to have premium expire worth is yeah, they're going to make their money. That's the
6142.96s: thing. They have essentially a way provided that they manage their book well. They capture the
6149.68s: bit asked spread. They have their money. So they can be super greedy and they can be fucked up.
6154.72s: Like no doubt about any of that. But all I'm saying is that some people they'll look at price and
6159.52s: they'll be like, oh, well, it was max pain. It was all market manipulation. And it's like,
6163.92s: dog, the stock was like $5 away from what you were trying to get it to. Like that doesn't really
6170.48s: matter. So yeah, there's an element of it though, I think. I absolutely think that let's say,
6176.88s: for example, Apple 21062, let's say it was a smaller stock, really difficult to do in like these
6182.08s: really, really big floating stocks. But let's say that it was like 2 2 10 99. And let's say that
6190.56s: there was a ton of overall option value at 211. There's very much a chance that the market makers
6197.52s: would try to suppress that price. There's very much a chance. But it's not like if max pain is at
6203.04s: like 215 here, that and this is now trading at like 220. Like the market makers aren't going to be
6209.52s: able to drive this down $5. That's very difficult, especially in massive products like that. So
6217.12s: Ben of airplanes say AMC perfect example closed just short of five. Again, it could exhibit tendencies.
6225.52s: You can't we cannot conclude that this is because it was manipulated. We can make inferences. We
6233.44s: could think that that that that is the case and that's fair. It's completely fair. But it's also
6239.60s: you can't directly conclude it. In this case, it did have really strong buying volume,
6245.84s: which is interesting. I do find this one a little curious. Got to absolutely concede the point.
6254.24s: Let's see.
6259.44s: Yeah. I call this one sus. This one looks sus to me.
6263.68s: I think this is a really, really interesting case. Again, being completely objective, this doesn't
6289.04s: immediately mean yes, this was manipulated. But it looks like a dog, barks like a dog.
6300.96s: I'm thinking it might be a dog, but I can't see it. It could be like a mimicking
6307.68s: impucia monkey or something that might not be exactly it.
6311.36s: But it looks sus. So yeah, that's literally a fantastic example.
6321.44s: Let's go back up.
6326.64s: Brad Dricol, can you look at snap? I can do that on Monday. I want to get through the more
6331.84s: substantive questions first. Shinsasu says, isn't it like a moving average? I don't remember which part
6340.64s: we were talking about, like a moving average. Let me know what that was referring to.
6351.84s: Rudebegus says, when I buy options, it tells me the probability of profit is that reliable.
6355.52s: Yeah, it's using options data as it is. It's misleading. People get really confused about that.
6361.60s: Because the probability of everything changes essentially as soon as time changes. It's a time
6366.64s: series. So if we look at IWM, we all know we got to look at some IWM. And I look out here,
6375.28s: and I see the probability, which is this one, there's probability of being in the money
6380.64s: at expiration and a probability of touch. Right? So let's just use this example. Let's say that
6386.80s: we're looking at this 30 delta probability of in the money is 28.57. Probability of touch is
6391.92s: 55.75. Now let's say that it's the same day in IWM rallies. And let's say that we go from
6399.92s: pretend that IWM goes up five points. So that would mean that at the money's, our strike would now
6409.92s: look like this strike. It would behave like these 203s. It would be 208 instead, but it would look
6414.00s: like these. Now take a look at the probabilities. The probability of it being in the money is 51%.
6420.24s: The probability of it touching and falling in the money temporarily is 99%. So the probabilities move
6428.96s: is what this means. So yes, at the time of entry, the probability is whatever it tells you it is,
6435.12s: but the probabilities will move. They're adaptive. They're based on a time series. They're not discrete.
6443.60s: A Florida kid says those probabilities are predictions. Not definitely careful.
6447.76s: Well, it's important, right? That's what probabilities are. It's an assessment.
6452.72s: But the reason why it's not definite is because they change as the underlying changes.
6460.64s: Alan says so market makers can do what they want, so why play options? It's because they're not
6465.92s: out to get you. The vast majority of the time, I know people really try to dig down at market
6473.36s: makers, but the vast majority of them are providing liquidity to capture the bid-ask spread.
6479.52s: There's always bad actors and just about everything, but they can't do whatever they want. That's
6484.72s: actually my previous point. They're subject to order flow. They can't move price wherever they
6491.12s: want it to go, otherwise nobody would play in the markets for that exact reason. But we know that
6495.52s: they can't. Does that mean that they can't slightly manipulate things? I bet they could. I can't
6501.12s: prove it, but I bet they could. There's a lot of studies out there on it that try to prove it,
6506.64s: but it's still inconclusive technically speaking from a definitive standpoint.
6512.40s: It's one of those things where could it happen? Absolutely. It would be ignorant to pretend that
6517.28s: it couldn't happen. Do they have incentive to do it? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean that it's
6522.80s: happening all the time everywhere and you can't trade markets. Yeah.
6528.16s: John says, don't they hedge against positions two and they're the ones selling the options more
6534.88s: often than not. They'll be on the other side of a trade and that's exactly correct. Their primary
6539.76s: profit is the bid-ask spread. That's where they're transacting at and they hedge their risks so
6546.72s: that they can capture the bid-ask spread. Sunny says, is there a chance market makers create
6554.08s: volume in an options chain? Yeah. They can transact there. Does it mean that they're just
6561.68s: piling a bunch of those positions on in their books? I don't think so. My guess is for these
6566.56s: super far out of the money contracts is I think that it's a bunch of retail traders that are making
6572.08s: really bad choices. So let's take a look at I'm still learning the tools. So you have to bear with
6578.40s: me just a little bit. I don't know. Yeah, this looks right. And let's take a look at GameStop
6585.68s: because this is actually a really great example over the past week with those 128s.
6589.92s: Let's look at the past two weeks. Here. So this is one of the cool things I find about
6597.52s: unusual whales is that you can pretty easily limit by stuff like this. I haven't found a way to
6602.72s: export it. I actually shopped them in email because for me, I like to consolidate all this stuff.
6607.12s: If you watched my video from earlier today, I, I like create these little dashboards that let me
6613.84s: actually see the things that I want to see. So I can show you an example of what I typically do
6618.32s: is compared to this. But this is like really nice information to have. So it's not like it's bad
6623.20s: or anything. This is just going to take a minute to load because it's not small. That's what I tell
6633.92s: everybody. So if we untick this, oops, that's not what I wanted.
6645.68s: So this is just raw options data from today. So I typically clean it like that. And then for you
6651.92s: guys, I create these little visuals so that we can see what transactions happen when and where.
6659.84s: Again, this is kind of what I like to do. But something like unusual whales is pretty convenient
6668.48s: because it offers a bigger view. The other thing I like to do is just aggregate the bigger things
6673.12s: from TNS. So this is actually from GameStop today. This is also from the video today. But these are,
6678.32s: yeah, just kind of like different ways you can view the data. So that's one of the things.
6682.72s: I don't know if you can do that in this yet. I shot them in email to ask because I really want
6687.04s: to be able to export this. And I want to look at like all of the data raptor at least 25 calls
6691.28s: over a specific set in time. But anyways, let's take a look at these 128s. You can filter here,
6697.76s: which is really nice. But I like to see more than that. What am I doing here? I'm trying to look at
6704.48s: this expiration, which was the 28th. And I'm trying to look at the 128s. And I just want to look
6714.56s: at the size. I'm going to get rid of, yeah, see, like isn't that topical in and of itself.
6720.00s: Right now I have it set to filter for 250 transactions. And I'm realizing that there's
6726.88s: got to be something wrong here. I don't know what I have this for the past two weeks. That looks
6736.24s: correct. Maybe I'll go to the past three weeks. Oh, stock. That's why I'm an idiot.
6744.96s: Stock is not strike price. By the way, gang, sometimes I do such stupid things. So if we look at
6754.64s: the volume or let's look at the actual site like this, right? Somebody somebody bought the,
6762.16s: they spent $152 on these calls. They spent 161. They spent 294. They spent 494. They spent 325.
6770.80s: The point I'm trying to make is this is just a lot of people placing really small positions, hoping
6775.20s: they get a massive payout. That's what this is. Even this, like this is still, well, even more
6780.80s: interesting, these are sale trades, right? Because these are coming in at the bid. So let's get rid of
6787.28s: mid and bid and this. And let's like just look at the offer. So we know that these are buys.
6796.40s: Look at all these small, tiny trades. This is just people hoping something works. That's what it
6802.88s: comes down to. Even this trade, it looks big, $3,000. It's $24,000. Like this is a small trade still.
6811.12s: So the point I'm trying to make here is that the vast majority of the people
6817.12s: based on the breadth of evidence I have available look very much to be hopeful retail traders,
6823.76s: essentially praying something moves in their favor. That's typically what I'm seeing here.
6828.32s: Overall. So yeah, I don't think that that's market makers trying to manipulate the price
6833.52s: of bunch out there. I just don't see that. Again, they can because they also can use options to offset
6839.68s: positions in their book if they want. Cool. It looks like we're calming down here. It looks like
6849.04s: you guys are slowing down on the questions, which is great. It's coming right up on time to bounce.
6853.36s: I hope the session was great for you guys. I will do another one this next week. I don't know
6857.76s: how long I'm going to go with these. I don't mind it though. Like I enjoy doing the beginner series
6862.96s: and I think doing it on a Friday is good. So I'll keep running these forward. And I'll think about
6868.72s: what I want to do in the next one. If you have suggestions, obviously the Q&A is the best part
6872.88s: I think because you get specific answers. So always feel free to drop those in. But if there's a
6877.68s: specific topic or something like that that you want us to take a look at in the next series,
6881.12s: let me know. Otherwise, I'm going to plan on doing more trade reviews to walk through kind of the
6887.20s: entire process of thinking of a trade idea, quantifying the profit mechanism, thinking about
6892.48s: placing a trade and kind of walk you guys through that. All right, you guys. I'll see you all
6900.96s: throughout the weekend. Don't forget to join the Discord. It's completely free. Be an outlier.
6904.80s: I'll see you guys later.
