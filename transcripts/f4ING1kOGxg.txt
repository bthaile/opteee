0.00s:  What's up everyone? We have the crappy camera today because I've been up and down standing
7.84s:  sitting most of the day and we are getting ready to kick off another is that has the lighting.
16.04s:  How do we look? That looks okay. We're getting ready to kick off another part four actually
21.48s:  of our beginner options trading live streams. We pop out this chat. I'm going to move it
28.88s:  over here so I can keep an eyeball on everybody. As you guys know, these are designed to be interactive
34.76s:  sessions. So more than anything, if there's something that you guys want to talk about, if
39.56s:  there's something that you guys have a question on, if there's something that you would like
43.92s:  to take a look at, let me know. That is literally the entire purpose of doing these in this
50.52s:  format is so that we can hang out, interact and kind of talk about the exact things that
56.32s:  you guys want to. So for today, there were a couple questions that I had sent in and then
64.12s:  I also have kind of this outline for analyzing options chains, which builds off really
71.36s:  well what we've covered so far. So the goal behind this video at the end of it, you should
79.12s:  have a better idea of looking at analyzing options chains, how to look for anomalies,
86.40s:  how to identify good versus bad opportunities, at least in terms of cost and execution. We
93.32s:  should have a better understanding of volatility, specifically as it pertains to surfaces and
98.48s:  smiles, so that when you're structuring trades, you have a much better roadmap on what you're
105.40s:  deciding. If any of you guys had a chance to check out the video I launched today, you'll
113.00s:  notice actually quite a few of these concepts baked into it as we're taking a look at things.
120.20s:  So that is a rough overview of what's on the agenda. As you guys know, we got to say hello
127.68s:  to everybody in the chat and it's always the best to be able to chat with the outliers on a
135.60s:  beautiful Friday. So let's see who we have in store. I see Paulo James. What's up James?
143.12s:  Welcome to thank you for the support on outlier bronze. I really appreciate that.
147.52s:  Roaring Titty, I don't know if there's a funnier name in here right now. I say it all the time,
153.76s:  one of the greatest things about YouTube and about Reddit, about all these different kinds of
159.12s:  communities that reminds me of like the old game stop or a game stop, the old Xbox gamer tags people
166.88s:  had that were always just so ratchet. So I have a deep appreciation for that. Let's grab a couple of
174.16s:  the questions that we have and it looks like big K has one as you could tell I'm already on it,
179.20s:  like white on rice. I have it grabbed and blown up as if it was part of this the whole time, although it
184.88s:  wasn't. And then we also have our boy J Shrej J Jason, E Long Songs Peter, Nico, Niko, I'm not sure
196.64s:  which one, but Nico, I'm going to go Nico. I think that that's right. Nico says I keep hearing about
204.48s:  this guy finally got a chance to be here. Well, that's kind of terrifying because if I don't know
210.32s:  where you would have heard about me, but that's yeah, I don't know if that's not great news for me.
215.28s:  Nico got it. Well, that's a cool name. It reminds me of the dude from Grand Theft Auto 4, I think Nico
221.84s:  Bellic when that game came out. All right. It looks like there's another question here. J says,
229.12s:  if someone is just starting out paper trading, what will you say the most important things to focus on?
233.12s:  Actually, that's a great, that's a great spot to start. We literally can start directly with that.
237.44s:  So when I think about the prospect of paper trading, actually, I need to see if I have a video on
245.84s:  this, I don't. That's kind of crazy, isn't it? Let me add that to my list right now for you guys.
250.40s:  It's kind of nuts that I don't have a thing for paper trading. I just added a note to make a video
256.64s:  on that at some point. So for those that don't know the way that my typical content production
261.68s:  schedule goes is like, I'm doing these random right now. It's almost every day market recaps
268.16s:  of a couple different stocks looking at them from an options perspective. But normally I have a podcast
273.84s:  episode that comes out every Wednesday and then every Saturday is a video and then typically
280.24s:  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday is live stream. I much prefer the live streams. It's because,
286.16s:  as you could tell, I'm not like some sort of great video producer. I'm not great at telling these
290.96s:  super funny stories like my buddy Benjamin, his YouTube channel, what you guys should absolutely
294.64s:  check out. He's he's masterful. But what I do like to do is share what I know. So this is kind of
302.08s:  a easier way and more direct way for me to do it. Reese says, new subscriber first time commenter
308.16s:  been binging your videos great work. That's awesome. That's good. Where are you at Reese in your
312.32s:  options trading process? Growing titty, which I will never get tired of saying that name. How do you
317.92s:  keep up the data real time with the volatile stock? I find options move pretty fast for me. Yeah, I think
323.04s:  it for that, it depends on what kind of data you're trying to keep track of because well, yeah, maybe
329.84s:  we'll start with a question there for you. What data are you trying to track? Because for me, a lot of
334.88s:  things that I do is once I have something set up, I'm going to set primarily alerts or what I need to
342.16s:  interact with it or what I'm looking for a new opportunity. Now going back to Jay's question,
348.08s:  I think the tears exactly what I would focus on in paper trading. The first one is the process
357.68s:  of defining a strategy. It's not easy. It takes time. And I have, as you guys know, videos on this,
365.36s:  I'll give you a couple in the chat here like this. And then like this.
379.60s:  And then I think there should be, yeah. So the process of paper trading, I think, is always
390.24s:  with everything else. You got to start with defining the goal. For me, the goal of paper trading
394.96s:  is to validate ideas. It's to develop a much, much better understanding of the product that we're
401.76s:  looking at. And it's absolutely to make sure that you can create a usable data set over time.
409.04s:  That's kind of like the origin, the process of paper trading. So I think the first thing to focus
415.12s:  on with paper trading is defining your ideas. Then I think the next thing to focus on is building a
421.28s:  trade log that lets you track the performance of those ideas. Those are the first two steps.
428.00s:  After that, I think you can start getting closer into the world of trying different ideas.
435.44s:  So say, for example, you don't know yet, let's say you don't know yet, that the wheel typically
442.48s:  underperforms by and hold. And let's say that you're under the impression that the wheel
447.52s:  or covered calls is the greatest thing on earth. And that's what you should be doing. And there's
452.16s:  nothing wrong with that strategy to be very, very clear. But a lot of people mistakenly think it
457.52s:  performs better than it does. So you're trading your covered calls and your original hypothesis is
464.88s:  I want to be able to maximize my portfolio growth on a monthly basis. Then you kind of start
470.80s:  noticing, wait a minute, if I'm comparing against a benchmark in whatever it is that you're trading.
476.96s:  So let's say you're trading stock XYZ. And in your trade log, I would set up like two different
482.16s:  components. The first component would be just buy and hold XYZ. Then underneath that, I would set up
488.32s:  a trade log that lets me track how I think I'm going to trade my strategy. And so maybe it starts
494.96s:  with selling a 30 Delta put and I sell these 30 Delta puts until I get assigned. Then I buy the
500.48s:  shares, all that's tracked. And then at the end of the month, you might look down and say, huh.
505.20s:  So the stock went sideways and I made way more money with the wheel than I did with buying shares.
513.36s:  Interesting data point. Then it's only a month. You can't conclude anything from that yet.
518.88s:  But then you can go down that path over the next few months and you can say, well, it seems like maybe
524.56s:  if the stock that I really like is going through a consolidation period and moving sideways,
529.28s:  maybe instead of buying shares, I focus on something like selling puts, selling the wheel,
535.60s:  running the first part of the wheel. And then as it starts to accelerate and show that upside
540.80s:  momentum that you can make more money on, then maybe you pivot to either buying shares outright
547.60s:  or scaling into your position. So there's a lot of different ways that you can structure ideas
554.56s:  and the purpose of paper trading is to be able to test them. The other thing,
560.16s:  not specific to ideas that I think is really important to integrate into paper trading regimen
566.00s:  is actually looking at markets. So one of the things I recommend to people, especially people that
572.16s:  are in like the the Patreon side of things that I interact with on this level a little more regularly,
577.76s:  what I try to do is get them to think about what the profit mechanisms that you're trying to
584.16s:  capitalize on and you should have some sort of regular process to look at that. So let's say for
590.80s:  a profit mechanism you're talking about trading something breakout upside, breakout downside,
595.36s:  some sort of momentum breakout. Well, what I would do, even if I'm not necessarily placing
600.24s:  trades, but what I would do is set up a tab in my paper trading log to then test this profit
606.40s:  mechanism. And I would say, well, I think there's edge in trading things that consolidate for
612.80s:  X period of time and then have some sort of breakout. So I would find names. I would create a scan
618.80s:  that lets me find names for all of these. And then I would create PNL targets for all of them.
624.88s:  So let me walk you through a specific example of this so that it's a little less esoteric.
630.24s:  And it actually works really well because this one hears a trade that I have on right now.
638.96s:  So on the 27th of June, which is yesterday, I bought to open a number of the reason why I don't
649.84s:  have the number here is because it doesn't really matter for this example. But I have a number of
655.44s:  these 41 puts at $4.25. So if we're using this is a dummy account of mine, if we go into EQT,
668.88s:  the first question is how did I find that? Well, I have a scan that lets me look for what I consider
676.96s:  to be interesting short term short opportunities. And that's what this is.
681.68s:  So kind of glossing over a lot of the analysis here. If I bought this option with the expectation
692.48s:  that it's going to go down, then let's say that there's no trade part of this. Let's just say that
698.48s:  I'm practicing looking for breakdowns. And part of what I'm thinking about in a breakdown is
706.08s:  I want to see something that was consolidating for a while, started making lower lows, consolidated,
711.44s:  and then started falling through that consolidation period. Maybe that's the scan.
717.04s:  So that's actually how I found this name was on one of my scans.
720.64s:  So then I enter in this position, you don't even have to enter the position. You literally can
725.28s:  just track the name. You could put EQT in a Google sheet. And you can say the date that you saw,
732.24s:  then you could have ticker, date of interest, whatever the current price was, and then whatever
737.92s:  your target prices are both for a stop and for your profit target. So in this case, you can see that
745.60s:  I have the trade set to stop me in profit no matter what because I got in a accommodating move
750.64s:  after I entered. And then there was a bit of a continuation to the downside.
755.52s:  So I slid my stop down just a bit to capitalize on this breakdown.
762.16s:  So that is one really simple way you can use paper trading to test a thesis and give me one
770.40s:  second. I got to open my door from a dog. That was hilarious. He was like in here whimpering because
784.56s:  he knows he's not allowed to bark in here. But then as soon literally as soon as I cracked the door,
789.60s:  I just got like one bark out of him. Just one. What a crackhead.
797.28s:  Yeah, so that's kind of the paper trading. Let me get caught up on the chat here.
800.48s:  Roryntidys says, hit the like for the YouTube algorithm. My man, that's exactly right.
805.44s:  Please do that. That's how we emerge from the depths of YouTube.
809.92s:  Reese followed up on my ask on how new to options. A few years, only just found out how bad
816.96s:  vertical spreads are. Thanks for that. Curious if you dislike put credit spreads equally?
824.48s:  Yeah. So here's the way I would think about verticals is in general, I avoid them,
830.16s:  like the vast majority of cases. There's not a solid reason to trade them. Now if there are
836.32s:  smaller structural reasons why it might make sense for you to gain access via a vertical
843.52s:  than so be it, but it's suboptimal. Like there's nothing that's generally optimal about a vertical
848.72s:  spread. Everything that you attempt to take advantage of. The whole point of a vertical spread is
853.92s:  it dampens the risk profile. So yeah, in general, I'm not a giant fan of verticals. It's not the
862.56s:  worst thing on planet earth, but it is not my go to now. There are ways you can bake in things like
871.36s:  verticals that could make sense. So for example, something as simple as using verticals to buy
878.48s:  the wings of something so that you don't have unlimited risk in a direction that you don't want to
885.76s:  have unlimited risk. Or if you have a small account and you need a way to decrease the margin
894.24s:  requirement, that's okay to use a vertical for those reasons, but you have to know the trade-off
900.08s:  to that. The trade-off is as you're doing that, you're losing efficiency on the underlying thesis
906.40s:  that you're trying to trade. That's what that boils down to and that might be a trade-off that
909.92s:  you're willing to make. That's the most beautiful part about options is you get to structure things
916.72s:  to be exactly what you want. So in this example, if you want a trade that you could put on,
922.48s:  that gives you your directional disposition that you want, but you don't want to put on too much
927.04s:  risk because you have a small account, you absolutely can make that trade-off. You could have a
932.56s:  slightly less optimal directional exposure position that has a lower capital requirement. You can do
938.96s:  that. So yeah, it's not necessarily that I dislike one type of vertical over others in general
946.64s:  verticals suck. And there's in time and place for everything. I trade verticals sometimes,
954.16s:  but it's like if I'm trading something really explosive through earnings, those kinds of products
960.48s:  I'm generally going to cap risk. So if we take a look really quick at Nike, this is a great example.
968.88s:  Because I know that they just fell off a cliff. So if we take a peek at Nike, they just dropped
973.52s:  off a cliff. And let's say that we're looking through our earnings. And let's say that you see that
981.20s:  they have a history of these kind of really big moves, right? Like take a look at these gaps.
986.56s:  From over here, we went from 103 to 115, so a 12 point move. Here we go from 95 down to 83,
995.36s:  another 12 point move. Here we go from 89 to 95 to 6 point move ish. From here we go from 22 down to
1005.84s:  0, 8, another massive move. From here, we go from 100 down to 93. So let's say for whatever reason,
1013.04s:  I wanted to trade Nike earnings. And let's say that I wanted to use short options to do so,
1020.64s:  which to be clear, I think that would be a terrible choice in this product. I didn't trade earnings
1024.56s:  for this exact reason. But let's just go under this assumption. You know that this thing moves a lot.
1030.16s:  So depending on how the options are priced, if you take a look at the implied move relative
1035.36s:  to the real, if you take a look at the implied relative to realize move and you look at
1040.16s:  enough instances where the realize move exceeds the implied, you might say, okay, well,
1045.52s:  I might still think that there's going to be excess IV, but if there's not, I don't want to get
1051.60s:  ran over. So maybe I will spread this trade off. So in this case, you can trade something like the,
1058.16s:  you know, 30 delta short options for a strangle, but then buy the wings so that if there is this
1065.60s:  big, outsized move compared to the expectation, you don't get killed. Again, just a general,
1072.72s:  a general idea. And let me see really quick. The, I think this came actually just within the
1078.32s:  expected move almost. Oh no, it definitely didn't. My bad. It was expected at 5.7%.
1085.12s:  It came in at 19 point, it came in at 20%. Massive, massive, massive,
1094.48s:  misalignment on the expected move. That's crazy. So yeah, that's kind of a time and place that
1103.36s:  you can use verticals. So to summarize all of that, I don't like verticals because they're generally
1110.24s:  inefficient. That doesn't mean that there's never a time and place for them. I trade them myself,
1115.28s:  seldom lay them, not regularly at all. Sometimes, sometimes it's the correct product, I think.
1121.36s:  So that's kind of the idea. YouTube's flashing that now would be a good time to insert ads.
1128.08s:  They make it so easy. They're like, now would be a good time to insert ads. Creators earn more money
1132.64s:  inserting ads. The more viewers are watching. Give it a try. I'm going to hit close because as I've
1138.32s:  told you guys, I'm willing to forego the couple dollars or cents I can make by inserting an ad here.
1144.48s:  So that you don't have to deal with an ad because I don't like dealing with ads. So
1150.16s:  back to this, that's an example where verticals might make sense. All right.
1156.64s:  Let me see up here. John says I bought Nvidia the 16
1163.52s:  aug 16, and the IV is 51% seems high to me. I see. So let's take a look at Nvidia. You bought a call.
1179.92s:  So IV percentile is 67%. IV ranks 49. IVs 51. So the first thing is when we're looking at
1190.96s:  implied volatility, it's super important to like when you're looking at an individual product
1195.44s:  to look at percentile or rank, I prefer percentile. The reason why you need to do this is because
1202.08s:  to your point, if you say the IV is 51%, it seems high to you, but you don't know what range is good.
1208.72s:  It's a it's a completely smart question to ask. And the fact of the matter is, as if somebody says
1213.68s:  the IV is 51, you have no idea. Like you literally have no idea if that's higher low. You know
1219.60s:  it's 51, you know the number, but the reason why that matters is because implied volatility is
1224.72s:  very specific to an individual stock. So you can have an individual stock like Nvidia where 51%
1231.36s:  IV clearly is high. It's 67% tile. So that is high. But you can have other products that tend to
1239.44s:  have really high IV. Let's see if this is a good example. It's not, let me see of another one.
1246.24s:  This is a great example. So if we take a look at GE, the implied volatility is 32%. That seems
1253.36s:  really low compared to what we were just looking at. But if you look at the IV percentile, it's 81.
1259.60s:  So that means on a relative basis, IV is super high for GE at 32% that leads to this IVP being
1271.76s:  so inflated. So it's very relative to the product. So when I look at your scenario in Nvidia,
1279.68s:  I think on a relative basis, it's expensive relative basis, 67% IV. So then if we go out to the
1289.12s:  16 aug 49 days out, it's 52%. So it's definitely cheaper than some of the spot IV. So you make a
1298.56s:  little bit of a better world for yourself there. And then if we kill some of these strikes,
1303.92s:  let's come into like 50. And you said you got the 160, which is super far out of the money,
1310.72s:  which is, well, not super far, but it's pretty far out of the money. This is not my trade at all.
1319.68s:  Yeah, so these are like a 10 delta. To me, this is going to be really expensive for what it is,
1325.20s:  because as you can see, these are a 51% IV as compared to something that's closer to
1330.72s:  at the money or even slightly in the money, which is like 48%. It's not a big variance. So you're
1335.20s:  not getting killed here. But yeah, on a relative basis, this is slightly more expensive.
1339.92s:  The downside to this is because this is all extrinsic value. Your premium now, your basis that you
1345.52s:  got in at is going to be highly susceptible to moves in implied volatility. You can see that here
1351.12s:  represented by Vega for those that don't know the Greek in this case, Vega, represents changes
1358.72s:  in implied volatility and the impact on an options premium. So in this case, when implied volatility
1365.60s:  moves one point, your premium will change by eight cents, which is not insignificant on a dollar
1372.72s:  10 product. So yeah, this will absolutely be quite susceptible to changes in IV. Now the good part
1379.84s:  is if you get a good move in your favor, it doesn't matter. You will be fine because the primary
1385.84s:  profit mechanism for that long call is going to be direction. But the other downside to that long
1390.96s:  call selection is because it's really far out of the money. So what that means is let's say we get
1397.36s:  a move in Nvidia. Let's say Nvidia moves an entire dollar in our favor. Cool. We get a dollar
1402.80s:  move in our favor. Your options are going to see 11 cents of that dollar. Your options are not
1408.88s:  going to see much at all. And the more annoying point apart is over the course of that same day,
1414.00s:  you're going to lose five cents. So if you get your dollar move, you're going to see an 11 cent
1420.72s:  positive return. You're going to see negative five cents come out of that 11 cents. It's not quite
1426.64s:  that discreet to be very, very clear. But markets are closed and I'm giving you kind of a linear
1431.68s:  example on how these things tie together. And the other thing to keep in mind is if Nvidia goes up,
1437.28s:  its implied volatility will likely contract. Volatility normally will contract as things go up.
1442.16s:  Do you probably going to get hit by this Vega to some degree, which will decrease the premium
1447.04s:  of your options that will work against you? So the trade can move if you get a big positive
1452.72s:  move in your favor. That's essentially what that boils down to. That's not to say it's dead in the
1456.40s:  water. It's the worst position ever. Nothing like that. But it's just a lower probability trade.
1460.24s:  That's all. Let me know if the answer is your question. Oh, shit. Here's the tough name.
1471.76s:  Ruta Vega. That's hilarious. Ruta Vega is asking what the program this is. Think or swim.
1477.76s:  And what cost says, bro, can you show me how to place a limit order on the toss chart? I don't
1485.20s:  actually use the chart itself personally, but there's a bunch of different ways you can place
1489.84s:  limit orders. You can either open up the trade tab, which is just here. Let me shrink this down
1494.64s:  just a little bit so you can see it on this side. You see where you can pull up the trade tab or
1499.92s:  active trader so that you can trade it directly from here if you want. That's the wrong window.
1504.72s:  But that's not what I do because most of what I'm trading is options. So options you need to go
1509.92s:  into the options chain. And then here's the tough name of frame. F frame. E. Bram. A frame.
1522.96s:  Damn it. How do you say this? A frame. I'm going to go with frame. Can you tell me the difference
1529.92s:  between long and short in option? Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I bet you somebody from the chat
1535.28s:  can tell you exactly what the difference is. So I defer to you all knowing chat. What's the difference?
1545.20s:  You guys know the answer to that? Short is selling long as mine. Bingo. That's exactly correct.
1553.44s:  So the way I would answer the question is the difference between long and short in option
1559.52s:  is if you were long, it means you bought to open. If you are short, it means you've sold to open.
1567.52s:  Now it can be a little tricky because here we go here. It can be a little tricky because you can be
1578.72s:  long or short in option and simultaneously be long or short. The underlying itself. So the
1587.84s:  way to think about the concept of long and short is it applies to a transaction as well as a
1593.20s:  disposition. So for example, if I buy a put, I'm long a put, but you can be short the stock
1604.64s:  in that instance, meaning you want it to go down, puts make money as the underlying goes down.
1610.32s:  To be long a put short the stock. Now you can also be short the stock outright, which means you've
1616.00s:  sold to open shares. You've borrowed shares and you've shorted stock. So the tricky part with long
1622.24s:  and short is it is a little bit context dependent. But the way to think about it to simplify it is
1630.08s:  there's generally two broad context. I don't know if it's context or context.
1636.88s:  There's two contexts. That sounds better. So there's two contexts. There's the transaction
1644.88s:  and then there's the disposition. So think about it in that sense as well. That might help a little bit.
1651.60s:  Let me know if that answers your question.
1656.16s:  Paulo says what happened to Nike bad earnings? They got murdered on earnings today.
1661.44s:  They don't really really bad call. So they were, they beat on EPS. So they came in at 99 cents versus
1671.04s:  85 cents expected. But they got, they got hammered. They bad call.
1678.24s:  Ban of airplanes. That's awesome that you like airplanes. Can you please discuss covered calls
1682.16s:  in the right time to utilize them? Yeah. I think the easiest way to think about
1688.40s:  covered calls is when you want to collect premium on a stock. But you're okay if it gets called away.
1695.36s:  That's the easiest way to think about it. You should not trade covered calls and something
1700.24s:  simple because you want income from your stock. But you want to hold the stock.
1705.36s:  You create a problem for yourself because sooner or later,
1709.20s:  this, it will get challenged. And then you'll kind of get stuck, which actually going back to,
1715.28s:  I don't know if we'll strat Joe's in here but shout out to my boy. And we were going through an
1720.00s:  example for him a while ago where we were, you know, just doing a scenario where we like started
1725.60s:  buying in here and we were trying to run through a perspective trade. Now there's inverse and we
1732.00s:  didn't get to that point of his trade, but we can take a quick look at it. So we did the scenario
1737.44s:  that he was selling cash secured puts for his weekly income. Then he gets assigned and the
1741.92s:  underlying drops and drops and drops. He's not able to make any money on those short calls.
1746.32s:  But he's trying to use the short calls against the long shares in order to make some sort of premium.
1750.96s:  Sooner or later, you get stuck because then you get a big pop in the underlying. Then that becomes
1759.76s:  really difficult in this case to then try and manage that position. So the way to think about
1766.72s:  trading covered calls is when you want to collect premium against an underlying that you hold.
1772.88s:  You're okay sacrificing the upside. And you're okay if the underlying gets called away.
1779.84s:  So I have a video on a slightly better take on a covered call, which is this, which is a ratio
1790.40s:  covered call where we maintain unlimited upside potential, which I actually think is really,
1794.96s:  really important. So that's the general idea there.
1800.48s:  Ethan says, been loving your vids learning a lot about how to read options and information.
1804.24s:  That's awesome. That's actually what we're going to take a closer look at in a few minutes.
1809.20s:  Paul says, can you somehow defend a covered call? Absolutely. There's a bunch of different
1812.48s:  things you could do with a covered call. So the way to think about defending a covered call is,
1818.00s:  I'm literally doing it right now in, well, it's a ratio called diagonal. So it's not exactly a
1823.44s:  covered call, but it's a similar concept, which is here in excess P. This is just another example
1830.24s:  trade I wanted to share with you guys. We may or not have time for it, which is okay. But here's
1835.12s:  the punch line. This strategy, as I have it on now, it's using short calls. And right now, I'm short.
1846.40s:  Let's look at these. The Monday 549s. So let's pop over to excess P.
1852.72s:  And here's the deal. So like I said, I have the short 549s from Monday. So typically,
1863.52s:  what I'll do is I'll create an alert that is just below where my strike is. And you can always
1872.00s:  buy the shares as it gets close to your strike so that you can unwind the part of the position.
1879.68s:  You have to be careful with your accounting if it's life over 5.0. But that's a slick way to let
1884.64s:  your short calls get called away. And then just use new underlying that you accumulated to cover
1890.40s:  that. So that's one way you can defend a position. Another way you can defend a position is to
1894.88s:  roll the options. But it's really difficult on the call side because you have to get ready at some
1901.04s:  point to let it go. Because here's the deal. Every time you roll an option, you're realizing the
1907.44s:  P and L of the existing trade. So let me grab this. I misspelled rolling. I accidentally had a T on the
1914.56s:  end. This one. Right here. There you go. So in that video, it talks about the concepts of rolling.
1929.92s:  And here's another one there that is about some of the myths around rolling. A lot of people
1938.16s:  think it's like free money or a way to fix a trade. And it can help, but it can also hurt.
1944.48s:  It's actually one of the most annoying things I see. Oh, the ceremonial wagons are going in right
1949.36s:  now for a Pahaska versus Poetan. But that's not what I'm here for. I'm here for to find I was going
1957.84s:  to look up rolling options. So I want to give you example of like bad things.
1965.52s:  Okay. So and this isn't to talk smack about anybody to be clear, but like this, this video says
1973.20s:  avoid losses by rolling options. It's it's functionally not true. When you roll an option,
1979.52s:  especially if it's a losing trade, you're actually realizing a loss. So this is incorrect.
1985.84s:  This one says option rolling strategy is free money. If you think that there's free money
1992.40s:  in the stock market, that's grossly incorrect. This talks about just adjustments, right? So like,
1997.92s:  you can adjust by rolling options. That makes a ton of sense. This just talks about rolling.
2001.68s:  That makes sense. This makes sense. All I'm highlighting is that there's a lot of
2006.56s:  terrible, terrible information out there like this. Like this is again, it's just wrong. It's not
2012.48s:  avoiding a loss. You are absolutely realizing a loss. Why the freak am I getting this?
2021.52s:  Yo, sometimes the YouTube algorithm is so off. Maybe it's because I have a pimple on my face.
2026.16s:  Maybe that's it. Maybe the YouTube algorithm is so sophisticated that it knows because I have
2031.04s:  a pimple that I need to see this super model teach me how to do skincare and juicing. They teach
2039.60s:  you how to juice, too. That's got cool. Ice rolling. Yo, all right. That's a little
2046.40s:  using rolling options for huge profits is I would consider to be ridiculous. You're not going to
2055.04s:  get huge profits by rolling. Anyways, I think we can give rid of this. The point I'm highlighting
2062.80s:  is that there are no shortage of grossly just terrible, terrible details around rolling options.
2071.60s:  Literally, let's look at an example really quick. We can find a period. You guys want to pick a
2076.48s:  stock? Pick a stock. Any stock. Something with options though. We need something with options.
2082.56s:  And I can show you exactly what happens.
2084.32s:  GME. Let's do something else. GME, I'm always down, but we've done PLTR. That's cool.
2095.20s:  I just did another video on GME today. So I want to look at something else. Let's take a look at
2099.36s:  this good old PLTR. And let's zoom out. Let's find a good period to go back. Let's go here.
2106.08s:  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at rolling options in balance here. We'll use
2113.36s:  on-demand. We'll go back in time. And let's say that I use short calls. We'll do short calls.
2122.72s:  And let's say that we do it somewhere in here. So I'm going to enter a trade on the 29th of
2127.84s:  January. So we're going to pop into on-demand and we're going to go back to January 29th.
2133.12s:  Now to be clear, I'm cherry picking a scenario on purpose where I know that this is going to go
2138.56s:  up afterwards. This is actually a really effective way to get a sense of how something works,
2143.92s:  both to the good side and the bad side. I find traders in general way too frequently,
2149.52s:  only focus on the side of the trade that they want to happen. And it's a massive mistake.
2154.88s:  It's literally one of the worst possible mistakes you can make. I call it, well, there's different
2160.56s:  ways you can refer to it. It's kind of like Goldilocks analysis. It's just, yeah, way too focused on
2166.08s:  what you want to happen. Okay. So let's say that we have shares. So we'll buy one Hyundai.
2173.36s:  Actually, let's talk about, we'll do one Hyundai for the example. We've got a nice good old
2178.80s:  fill on our paper trading, which is great. And let's say that we go out like 30 days and we want to
2184.32s:  sell in at the money call, because that's where we get a bunch of money. That's what a lot of people
2188.00s:  do. And we'll click this. So we've just collected 135 bucks. Does the risk profile work in here?
2198.48s:  It does not wait. Does it? It does not.
2203.76s:  Bummer. Well, if you guys are familiar with covered calls, the way that this risk profile would work
2209.68s:  is this line would go up until 17 right here. And then it would go completely flat. So rather than
2216.88s:  this upward sloping line, it would be zero slope straight this way like this. That's what it would be.
2225.92s:  So now let's fast forward. We'll go fast forward a week. Take it out. Maybe a little over a week.
2235.84s:  Come out here to five Feb. We gotta go a little further. Go to 12th. So what I'm doing is I'm
2245.20s:  finding the period in time where it starts to kind of accelerate boom. And we have the 17 strike.
2250.24s:  So we're way down here. So let's take a look at what rolling does. Florida kid says Robinhood shows
2258.32s:  risk potential beautifully. That's actually probably the last possible thing that that platform can
2263.84s:  do at all. I don't think Robinhood can do anything. Well, so I refute your point and my justification
2270.88s:  for refuting your point is nothing other than pure fiery hatred towards Robinhood. So that's
2278.00s:  the basis of my argument. It's pure reviewed. Yeah, they suck. Okay. Back over to this. We sold this
2287.44s:  for, let me see, we have our position here. So we sold this for $1.36, now it's trading at $7.97,
2297.84s:  $0.98. Here's what happens when we roll an option. And how annoying is that? If you take a look,
2304.88s:  this is the problem with covered calls. You eventually get your pop in the stock whenever that is.
2310.16s:  And you'll see that the PNL on the stock is $8.11, but you're losing $606 on the call. So you've now
2318.72s:  assumed a position that has unlimited downside risk to zero. That you're taking that risk. You're
2325.68s:  holding that risk, but you've now capped the upside. And you have no more upside potential beyond
2333.52s:  150. There's your max profit. That sucks. So now let's talk about this magic of rolling options. Let's
2339.52s:  talk about how rolling an option is free money and limited money. Let's check it out. I'm going to
2344.80s:  roll this option. The very first step to rolling the option is to close the existing one. So I'm going
2351.68s:  to have to close this for $8.10. What happens when I click this button when I click the button,
2359.04s:  I hit confirm and send what happens? It's very clear what happens. This trade will go away. I will
2368.48s:  remove this from the portfolio. Then to complete the roll, we would open up a new trade further
2376.64s:  out in time. So we'll go out to like this 32 days. Let's say we're trying to roll out in time.
2383.28s:  Let's see what we can get for these 17s. You can get them for less than what you're going to have
2389.92s:  to pay to exit this one. That's annoying, isn't it? Because you're typically told, well, I can roll
2396.32s:  out. I'll be good or I can roll out and up and adjust my basis. Sometimes you can. There's
2403.04s:  nothing wrong with rolling. I roll literally all the time. The trade I was going to show you in
2408.72s:  XSP, I literally rolled it. The difference between my approach with options and other people, though,
2416.32s:  is that I'm not so egotistical that I have to have everything framed so that it works in my favor.
2425.20s:  I recognize when I roll this trade, I'm closing this 17 call out in one March for a loss.
2434.24s:  It is a realized loss on my books. It's a realized loss. My account value will have gone down by $661.50.
2447.44s:  Now, if you roll for a credit or let's say you can get to a credit, in this trade, you literally
2452.24s:  couldn't even roll out here for credit. We have to go further. Let's check out this 39, see if we can
2456.72s:  get to the 17. Probably not still. Let's go out to this 45, go to the 17. You might be able to.
2467.68s:  So let's see. Let's say that we roll this. Boom. That's the first part of a rolling transaction.
2475.36s:  It just happened. I just lost money. My account is now lower value than where I started.
2482.24s:  What really gets people twisted is let's say I can roll for a credit. Let's say what I can get for
2487.60s:  these. You can't even roll out here because they're mid at 802. I just closed these for, well, I guess,
2494.96s:  $7.98. So if this gives me the mid, then we'll be okay. You know what's bad when paper trading doesn't
2504.88s:  give you a fill. That's how you know your embed shape. Let's cancel this and let's see if we have
2514.16s:  to go to like a main expiration. Let's see what we can get for these 17s. We need to sell here. We
2519.04s:  should be able to get 825. This is a reasonable trade. Let's see if this goes through. Boom.
2525.92s:  I'm telling you, you know your embed shape when you can't get a fill on paper trading.
2530.72s:  So we just got this for 825. So what just happened in the account? Simple.
2536.16s:  The net liquidating value decreased by the value of this option. It was already down, right?
2541.68s:  Realizing the trade doesn't all of a sudden make it happen. Your net liquidating value represents
2546.64s:  what happens if you close everything right now. So your net liquidating value was already down this
2551.04s:  $662. But now it's realized the position is closed. We opened up a new position. You just collected
2558.00s:  $8.25. This is a credit, which is good. It means that this position has the capability
2566.00s:  to cover the loss you realized on this position. But how much money are we actually making here?
2573.92s:  Well, if we're getting these optimal fills, which we know we wouldn't get in the real world,
2579.28s:  you're getting 25 cents plus what? Two cents, 26 cents is the overall credit that you got between
2586.48s:  this trade. So that means you got $26 and now you've tied this money up for 67 days.
2595.12s:  That doesn't seem like a great trade to me. I don't know. Maybe it is to somebody else. That's
2600.48s:  not great. I'm not trying to tie up the entire position on this, taking unlimited downside risk,
2607.28s:  having capped upside because I still don't have any upside profit potential beyond whatever the
2612.88s:  150 it is, less than that. So it's just not a great trade. But that's what rolling is.
2623.60s:  It's again, there's nothing wrong with it. The way that you reconcile rolling something like
2630.08s:  this to complete the example is let's say we fast forward time, two weeks. The first thing I would
2636.80s:  be trying to do is roll is adjust this as soon as I could get out for reasonable profit, not even a
2642.96s:  profit necessarily on the entire transaction just on this individual trade and see if I can get just
2647.76s:  a little closer at the money. But what you're experiencing now is what I call expiration liquidity.
2654.16s:  Because guess what? I just fast forwarded two weeks and take a look. I can now roll these for a decent,
2662.48s:  this is great. In this position, I sold these for 825. I can buy them back for 695. This still
2669.20s:  doesn't cover the cost. But I could technically take these in for a small profit and then try to
2675.60s:  roll to something that's a little closer to the money. But guess what? I don't have expiration
2680.64s:  liquidity. I have to go out now to 81 days if I want to roll this because I had to go so far out
2686.80s:  on the first trade in order to get a credit. This is the problem with rolling. So now we have to sit
2692.00s:  here and just hold this position. Now the other thing to keep in mind is you have to be very,
2696.32s:  very careful with the accounting because the position that you have on now this 17 call in 19 April
2703.68s:  will show a profit. It shows that you're making $130. But remember, this is a rolled position.
2711.12s:  You're still not making money in the aggregate. A lot of people get confused on that. So they
2716.16s:  think that their rolled option is now making money. And it's like, oh, great. I make a money on
2720.24s:  this rolled option. Everything's going great. But you need to make $662 on this position before you're
2726.56s:  at break even let alone in profit on this new open position. So I'll take a pause there. See if you
2734.72s:  guys have any questions on this concept in generality. And then I'll talk about kind of the reconciliation
2740.24s:  phase of it. And in the meantime, I got to let my dog back in.
2756.40s:  All right. So the real instructor is now made it into the chat. It looks like you guys don't have
2763.84s:  any questions, which is good. So let's talk about how this eventually winds up. So in this position,
2772.32s:  if I have this trade, I essentially just need to wait until we get out here. So our expiration is
2780.16s:  19 April. So literally, let's just go all the way to expiration here. The blink if he's right. Yo,
2788.32s:  you got to look at them. You can't you'd be in a straight up baby here. I honestly thought there
2794.64s:  goes. There goes. Can you blink? Does a lick count? Mr. Florida kid. Does that work for us? There we go.
2810.88s:  He's a sidekick, bro. He just hangs out in the bed right over here.
2815.28s:  So now we're at expiration. This is actually a really, really great example. So in this case,
2822.48s:  our options are still deep in the money. But we've gotten pretty far headway in this position.
2828.72s:  And there's a couple things you can do here. I could tell you exactly what I would do. I would
2832.48s:  not let these go here. What I would do is roll them again. So in this case, I sold them for $8.25.
2840.08s:  They're now marked at $3.38. So in this case, we still haven't made our money back. We were up $488,
2847.84s:  but we needed to make $662 to be up money. But I can tell you by how I know these work, there will be
2854.80s:  an opportunity to roll here. So now what we need to do is see where we can get the money for this trade.
2862.16s:  So in this case, it's made at $338. If we take this and we go out, let's call it 28 days and see
2869.36s:  where we can get to $338. You can definitely roll here to the 17 DTE. But you're getting really close
2876.96s:  to being able to roll up one strike. That one strike is super important because that means now
2883.44s:  your capital gains is not capped at 17. It's now capped at 18. So rather than making the few
2891.28s:  cents you would have made in this position, the 16 cents, the difference between the 16,
2895.36s:  18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18. So you might be able to get it here probably not. We'll have to go
2923.04s:  out here to the 63. And notice
2924.88s:  just what happened there. We
2926.80s:  literally had to wait. What
2928.88s:  was it? 50 or 60 days to make
2931.60s:  the 20 bucks that wasn't even
2933.68s:  the profit that was fully
2934.64s:  realized. So now you have to
2936.72s:  roll it out another 60 days to
2938.96s:  potentially get your dollar
2940.16s:  what you can hear now finally.
2942.08s:  So now you have a choice.
2944.32s:  Do you roll your option out to
2947.20s:  this strike collecting about
2949.44s:  $3.55. You have to pay $3.
2952.40s:  And 40 cents essentially to close
2954.24s:  it so you get 15 cents. That
2956.08s:  means over the course of essentially
2957.84s:  120 days you would have made
2960.96s:  what you got 25 cents on the first
2963.76s:  one. On this one we're getting
2967.52s:  10 cents. Ish. If that 15 cents.
2973.44s:  So you get in like 40 bucks.
2975.28s:  You're getting 40 bucks to tie
2976.80s:  up this entire position and
2978.64s:  palantir now for 120 days.
2980.88s:  That's what you have to show for it.
2982.72s:  But here's the thing with rolling.
2984.64s:  People are so egotistical that this
2987.44s:  idea of not having a losing trade is
2990.08s:  so important that they're willing to
2992.48s:  make the objectively ridiculous
2996.64s:  decision of tying up money for
2999.28s:  120 plus days to make $40 extra on
3002.32s:  the premium here.
3004.00s:  It just doesn't make sense.
3005.44s:  Now the reconciliation is very
3007.12s:  simple though. If for whatever
3008.56s:  reason, let's say the example is
3009.84s:  you really do want palantir long term.
3011.84s:  Well a bunch of things should be
3013.04s:  happening ready. You should have
3013.92s:  been buying more shares throughout
3015.12s:  this whole thing.
3016.00s:  Back into a whole other strategy
3017.76s:  outline.
3018.56s:  But in this specific example,
3020.88s:  there's really two things we can do.
3022.40s:  We can either take this role or
3024.64s:  we can let the shares go.
3026.56s:  Because if you let the shares go,
3028.72s:  you're going to unwind your 100 shares
3031.84s:  at this 17 handles.
3033.76s:  So you're not going to collect much
3034.80s:  money at all.
3036.00s:  But the cool part is you will take
3039.28s:  the entire premium.
3040.88s:  So then you will cover this previous
3042.56s:  role and you'll walk out at
3044.16s:  least with a few dollars to show for it.
3046.96s:  That's the primary way that you can
3049.36s:  unwind this position.
3050.24s:  You can accept the fact that you made
3051.60s:  a terrible choice by selling a
3052.88s:  covered call.
3053.84s:  That's really what that boils down to.
3055.52s:  Otherwise you can roll out in other
3056.88s:  63 days, adjust your basis slightly
3059.12s:  and continue the role,
3060.32s:  which you can do.
3061.68s:  But you'll see my point again,
3063.84s:  you're tying up money for a really
3065.60s:  long time and you're not making
3067.36s:  much money doing it.
3068.40s:  It's just not a great trade.
3071.60s:  That's what it boils down to.
3076.00s:  Shrejie says, what's the flavor?
3077.92s:  Oh, yeah, you know it.
3078.96s:  So today we got mango orange on our
3081.52s:  spin drift, which I actually just
3082.80s:  finished crushing.
3083.60s:  We might need a refill on that.
3085.28s:  And then Shrejie's on point with
3086.72s:  watermelon.
3087.28s:  That's exactly what we got.
3088.40s:  Good old-fashioned
3090.40s:  crogr.
3091.28s:  Crogr watermelon.
3092.72s:  It's one of my favorites.
3094.08s:  Watermelon is super, super good.
3096.16s:  I don't know what it is about watermelon water.
3098.08s:  It's kind of refreshing.
3104.16s:  I was right about the doctor ordered.
3106.48s:  All right.
3107.76s:  So let me know if that makes sense on the rolling.
3111.04s:  I don't want to make it sound like I'm
3112.72s:  crashing rolling because I'm not.
3114.32s:  I roll all the time.
3116.80s:  But you have to understand the context
3119.28s:  of what you're doing and the trade-offs
3121.04s:  thereof.
3121.68s:  You can never get so obsessed with not
3124.32s:  being able to handle taking a losing trade
3126.72s:  that you just roll forever.
3128.16s:  It's so dumb.
3129.76s:  It's so egotistical.
3131.60s:  You can be in this game either because you
3134.64s:  have this strong urge to be right and
3137.20s:  your ego demands it.
3138.24s:  And for some people that can line up really
3140.00s:  well with making a lot of money.
3141.12s:  Again, there's always exceptions.
3142.56s:  But for most of us,
3145.28s:  that typically leads to losing a bunch of money.
3147.68s:  I always tell people do you want to be
3149.04s:  right or do you want to make money?
3150.72s:  I care about making money.
3152.08s:  So what that means is I am wrong
3153.76s:  all the freaking time.
3155.60s:  It's okay.
3156.64s:  That's how the business works.
3159.28s:  As long as you are able to
3160.88s:  constructively move through your process,
3162.96s:  you can be wrong all the time and still be okay.
3167.12s:  Fanta Verre plain says,
3168.24s:  doodle.
3168.72s:  Yeah, it's the he's a multi-boot.
3170.56s:  Multi-boot.
3172.00s:  Now he's rolled up like a little penny ball down there.
3176.72s:  Paul says the name rolling is a bit misleading.
3179.04s:  Uh, I don't know that it is.
3181.20s:  I feel like it's okay.
3182.40s:  What's wrong with rolling?
3184.00s:  I'm not saying.
3184.72s:  You're just moving something further out in time.
3187.76s:  That seems legit to me.
3189.44s:  What's your beef with rolling?
3196.96s:  I feel like rolling is chill.
3198.96s:  I am in the process of finishing our door dash order.
3205.60s:  We're being, uh,
3206.40s:  unhealthy slabs tonight.
3209.20s:  We're going to do some Buffalo Wild Wings.
3212.72s:  I don't know if you guys do boneless or not.
3214.80s:  I like them both,
3216.08s:  but boneless is just easier to eat because you can just kind of stuff them in your mouth.
3221.36s:  There we go.
3222.00s:  Jason says I'm rolling right now.
3223.52s:  How do boy?
3224.16s:  That's what we love to hear.
3226.08s:  Am I dude out here enjoying?
3228.56s:  Enjoying his Friday?
3230.00s:  Perfect.
3230.96s:  Good.
3231.76s:  All right.
3232.00s:  So it sounds like the rolling thing which obviously was not
3235.04s:  the overall intention for the session today.
3236.96s:  But I think it's a great question.
3239.44s:  And I'm happy, absolutely happy to dive into it.
3244.96s:  Zach says I get boneless but they're not really wings, they're nuggets.
3247.76s:  I think that's exactly right.
3249.12s:  That's what a great way to phrase it.
3252.72s:  Um,
3254.72s:  Zach says,
3258.16s:  new to options.
3259.12s:  I have, uh, hold on.
3260.48s:  Fan of airplanes says, wait, how can you lose money selling covered calls?
3264.24s:  I thought the worst case was selling your shares for the strike price.
3266.80s:  Yep.
3269.76s:  So the primary way that you can lose money selling covered calls
3275.52s:  is if your strike is below your basis.
3278.00s:  So if we go back to another example.
3283.44s:  And
3285.92s:  let's go back to test looks.
3287.52s:  We were just looking at this.
3289.28s:  So let's say that you were buying shares here.
3292.40s:  You get assigned or you were selling puts get assigned.
3295.84s:  And then the underlying continues down, down, down, down.
3298.24s:  So your basis is way up here.
3300.16s:  But you're trying to sell calls against your shares in order to make a few bucks.
3305.44s:  So as you're doing that,
3307.76s:  you're selling your short calls lower than what your strike or than what your basis on the
3315.20s:  underlying is.
3317.36s:  That right there is how you can lose money doing this.
3322.32s:  So what that looks like is let's say your basis is up here at two thirty five.
3327.20s:  The underlying goes down.
3328.32s:  You're selling calls now all the way down here at one seventy two.
3332.24s:  And sooner or later it rallies up and out.
3335.20s:  You might not be able to roll fast enough to recapture your strike price along with your
3341.68s:  underlying basis.
3343.52s:  And that's how you can get locked into a loss.
3348.64s:  Zach says new to options.
3350.00s:  I have some nineteen and a half GME options expiring the 12th.
3353.44s:  How close to expiration is the latest I should wait to sell.
3355.92s:  If I don't plan to exercise,
3358.16s:  costs was six ten a piece.
3362.64s:  Fan of Airplane says, got it makes sense.
3364.08s:  I want to sell cover call way above my basis.
3366.32s:  That's the idea.
3367.52s:  But again, like sometimes if the underlying drops a lot and you still have the shares and you
3372.00s:  want to sell calls, that's not always possible.
3374.72s:  The other thing is, again, I would highly recommend checking out that video I posted earlier
3379.84s:  about ratio covered calls.
3381.92s:  I think not capping the upside is just
3386.00s:  not negotiable essentially.
3387.92s:  Don't cap the upside on something that has unlimited downside risk.
3391.92s:  It just doesn't make sense.
3395.92s:  Zach back to his question.
3399.92s:  How close to the expiration is the latest I should wait to sell.
3403.92s:  And you have the seven twelve in GME.
3405.92s:  Let's take a look at the next one.
3407.92s:  Let's take a look.
3409.92s:  GME.
3411.92s:  Let's zoom in.
3413.92s:  And then let's take a look at the 12th.
3419.92s:  So the first thing here is I would generally recommend trying to stay out of the weeklies as much as you can
3425.92s:  because they're going to be less liquid.
3427.92s:  Now let's take a look at the 19 and a half.
3431.12s:  I like that these are in the money.
3432.32s:  That's good.
3433.52s:  But these are also very liquid.
3435.92s:  Right.
3437.12s:  And the reason why I'm saying that is they're 45 cents wide for something that's 19 and a half dollars.
3443.12s:  That's crazy liquid.
3445.12s:  So the way that I would measure this bit asked spread is I sent is essentially you can take the width between the bit asked spread
3453.12s:  and then divided by the underlying price that kind of normalizes it.
3457.12s:  So in this case the width is worth 45 dollars.
3461.12s:  You divide that or we could do 0.45 divided by 19.
3465.12s:  It's huge.
3471.12s:  It's literally huge the spread.
3473.12s:  So in this case, I think these are just terribly liquid options.
3479.12s:  This is not good.
3481.12s:  So looking at when I think when really comes down to a couple things.
3489.12s:  How much you want to deal with.
3493.12s:  The remaining extrinsic value.
3495.12s:  There's not that much.
3497.12s:  So what this means is each day that you hold these you're not really bleeding a lot of money.
3501.12s:  That's a normal pretty significant input at this point.
3505.12s:  And other than that, you're so far on the money at this point, it doesn't matter.
3509.12s:  You can hold it for as long as you want.
3511.12s:  There's no set rule.
3513.12s:  I would focus more so not so much the time frame necessarily, but more based on what the underlying does against your expectations.
3519.12s:  That to me is what I would way more heavily wait than kind of an arbitrary time.
3525.12s:  Otherwise the arbitrary time would definitely depend, depend quite a lot on how much data decay is coming out of them.
3535.12s:  But you're so far in the money that it doesn't matter.
3537.12s:  The other thing that you should check out from like my GME video series.
3541.12s:  If you haven't seen it, I guess I can switch back to this one.
3545.12s:  If you haven't seen the GME video series, I did you should check it out because I talk about this process of buying options a little bit smarter for people.
3555.12s:  And I think that this also makes sense here.
3561.12s:  Buying call option smarter. This is your video.
3567.12s:  There you go.
3569.12s:  So that video will go through it a little bit more in detail.
3574.12s:  Cool. Now let's take a look at I think somebody had a question somewhere about the charts.
3588.12s:  Okay, I went all the way back up. I had to catch up on a couple of these.
3596.12s:  Okay, I got away back up my bad. I didn't realize I missed so many my bad.
3603.12s:  I was talking about the covered call for Apollo.
3605.12s:  God says interesting activity in AMC large dock pool prints after hours.
3611.12s:  One for 16 million three million shares might be worth a look at the options chain.
3616.12s:  Yeah, we could take a look at that potentially. I'm not that I looked at it not too long ago and it just wasn't doing much.
3625.12s:  So what city says intrinsic value still confuses me if you don't have the money to exercise shares and they closing the money.
3631.12s:  How does that work?
3633.12s:  Yeah, well, in that case you can one you don't want that to happen. Let's be very, very clear.
3639.12s:  That's a terrible scenario. And the reason why that scenario is terrible is for several reasons.
3645.12s:  But I think for that specifically, you would want to exit the position before expiration.
3653.12s:  That is the hands down correct answer in this scenario.
3656.12s:  Now, let's say we're just talking about a hypothetical here.
3659.12s:  Your broker could do you a solid and float you the shares on margin until you can sell it at market on Monday.
3668.12s:  Or if they can internalize the order and neutralize it for you and be homies, they can do that.
3674.12s:  Or you could technically give them instructions not to exercise, but you would lose all the money, which is a terrible idea.
3681.12s:  You do not do that.
3682.12s:  So the punch line to that is just close it before expiration. That's the easiest answer.
3689.12s:  J says when you sell cover calls out a ratio, how do you balance downside protection with how much of a ratio you go for?
3695.12s:  Yeah, it's a great question. Here's the deal. When you sell covered calls or ratio covered calls, I would literally just not look at the short calls as downside protection.
3705.12s:  It protects so little it offsets your downside so insignificantly.
3711.12s:  So to me, I would literally just trade the chart as I typically would.
3716.12s:  So the way I would balance downside protection is let's take a look at XSP.
3720.12s:  I have a ratio called the Agnal, which is a very similar strategy is to cover call.
3724.12s:  I'm just using long options as compared to this case right now. I have a stop set.
3728.12s:  Oh, it's an alert, but it's an initial stop that set at 540 91.
3733.12s:  So that means if XSP falls down to that, it means I'm going to exit the position.
3738.12s:  I will close the shares, then I will close the calls. That's how I managed to downside risk is by managing the trade.
3744.12s:  The short calls offsets such an insignificant amount of downside potential.
3749.12s:  I actually think it's really bad mental association to think selling more short calls helps with your downside.
3756.12s:  It doesn't actually help that much. I would just manage to trade.
3763.12s:  The short option part of that really just adds a little bit of premium to the position so you can make a little bit more money.
3773.12s:  Reese says broker will likely close the options before XSP. If you don't have to cash the cover.
3777.12s:  Yep. And if you don't have margin because you can go on margin, right?
3780.12s:  You don't have to have the full amount of cash in order to take the position.
3786.12s:  Ethan says, can you go over longer duration options maybe two to four months? Yeah.
3790.12s:  If you let me know what about them, you want to go over. But yeah.
3795.12s:  Leonard says, what's the longest you've held an option before? That's a good question.
3799.12s:  I honestly don't know. I would have to imagine definitely over six months, but I'm not sure if I've actually held a single option for longer than a year without actively like moving the position.
3815.12s:  Let's see.
3823.12s:  I'm just catching up on the rest of the comments to make sure I didn't miss you guys.
3831.12s:  Good. Good.
3836.12s:  Ruta Vegas says selling calls is a bearish play. You should lose if the stock goes up. No, no, not not necessarily.
3843.12s:  So the reason why is because of an offsetting position. It's a great question. Really, really great question.
3848.12s:  You're doing a good job analyzing it. So when you're and I'm sorry, let me take a step back on the on the short calls.
3856.12s:  You absolutely do lose money if it goes up. That's actually the entire example that we just saw when we went through this.
3862.12s:  Now the scenarios that we're talking about is in the context of a covered call, which means that you have long shares that offset the delta.
3873.12s:  So take a look. Does this show up for you guys? It might be a little too low.
3879.12s:  Let me see if I can just a little bit.
3882.12s:  So you'll see down here that the delta on this position, the long shares give me their one delta. Each share gives you one delta, right? Pretty easy.
3893.12s:  So if we have 100 shares, you have 100 delta's the underlying when you sell calls will have less than 100 delta's and then sooner or later, if you fall far enough in the money, they will essentially become also negative one delta.
3908.12s:  So then at some point, they offset one another for a one for one basis. So that's why you can sell calls against your shares and not have risk to the upside because the long shares offset the risk.
3922.12s:  Hi.
3927.12s:  J5D looks like your bouncing great to see you take care. That's a hell of a name. A6B. When selling strangles, do you ever double down on the losing side or how do you defend it or adjust? That's a great question.
3940.12s:  That depends entirely on the trade and that's all stuff that's defined ahead of time. There are some strategies that I run that are way more mechanical. So like anything zero DTE 2 DTE weekend plays stuff like that.
3955.12s:  And in those instances, it's very programmatic. Once I hit a certain PNL, I close the position, recenter if I want and then roll from there. It's essentially what I did today.
3965.12s:  There are other positions where I might be trading variance for premium, which I have a bunch of those plays on right now. I think one of them is an example on the on the blackboard.
3975.12s:  And those I'm more willing to adjust, but I typically will adjust before something goes way too far in the money. But the process of doubling down. I don't think that's a good idea.
3987.12s:  Now, that's not to say that you can't scale into a trade if that's part of your plan, but the way that you're framing it tells me that we would be just scaling in because it's losing and that's not a great reason to do that in my opinion.
3999.12s:  So no, I would pretty much avoid doubling down.
4006.12s:  But working investor, when selling covered calls below your basis, do we select a 16 delta or less? So at least one standard deviation from the expected move?
4018.12s:  I would focus less on that and I would focus more on where would you be okay fighting the position. That's what it comes down to.
4027.12s:  And the other thing is I would be very, very actively managing that position as soon as it starts getting challenged, I would be trying to roll it out as little in time as I can and getting it as far out of the money as I can each time.
4039.12s:  The reason I go as little far out in time as I can because sooner or later you run out of expiration liquidity.
4044.12s:  You're able to roll out seven days than another seven days than another seven days than another seven days and so on and so on until you get out here and then it starts going from 49 to 84 to 112.
4056.12s:  It starts opening up a lot. So I want to kind of maximize my runway is best as I possibly can. So that's one of the broad ideas with that.
4068.12s:  So yeah, I think the easiest answer in general is avoid doing it avoid selling calls below your basis because that tells you something has gone wrong and in my opinion where that would really become a scenario is when you're holding a stock too long that's not doing what it should be doing.
4087.12s:  That's like the I don't know the way I would think about it.
4092.12s:  That says when choosing a buy calls, am I correct that one of the things to look at is the IV and high IV is good. Not necessarily.
4100.12s:  When choosing to buy calls, the primary profit mechanism is price direction. So the main thing I would be looking at is something moving in your preferred direction more than anything.
4110.12s:  Much, much less so about whether or not IV is high IV in that scenario is kind of like a secondary function, I think.
4120.12s:  So yeah, I think that's the way I think about that.
4125.12s:  Let me know if that answers your question. I'm updating.
4130.12s:  So quick.
4138.12s:  Let me see Alfred says if you have a leap option that's up say 200% or more would you hold yourself.
4146.12s:  I would define where I want it to go before entering the trade again. It's not about how much something is up or down. It's not about.
4156.12s:  So I think that's the way any sort of arbitrary figures when you're trading options in this scenario, Zach says that answers perfect. That's what we love to hear.
4165.12s:  When you're trading options directionally like this, at least for me, I'm trading a specific profit mechanism and then what the option is just the vehicle.
4174.12s:  So what that means is let's say I'm trading.
4179.12s:  Let's do like Wells Fargo.
4182.12s:  I'm just like I'm trading.
4187.12s:  I'm trading with the options that I bought back in.
4192.12s:  February or even better January.
4195.12s:  So let's say that I have really long dated options that are way way out here.
4200.12s:  And let's say that I bought them with the expectation of Wells Fargo.
4205.12s:  Let's see what it would look like at the time. I'm just like picking an arbitrary place that I think I might have selected.
4210.12s:  Doesn't even look like it's been up here before. But let's just say that we pick a number. So it's at 46.
4215.12s:  Let's say that for whatever reason you think it's going to go to 55.
4220.12s:  And we'll draw a line here.
4226.12s:  55 and let's zoom in.
4229.12s:  So here, if we got in down here when it was at 46 for whatever reason and you think it's going to get to 55.
4236.12s:  What we would do in that scenario is in no way.
4240.12s:  Say, okay, my long options are up.
4243.12s:  Let's call it 200%.
4245.12s:  It's doing what I want. Let me close this position.
4248.12s:  What you're exhibiting in that scenario is a really well known trader behavior shortfall.
4256.12s:  And it's a component of the disposition effect.
4259.12s:  It's where we have a strong mental preference, a cognitive preference to close winning trades.
4265.12s:  Because we like that sensation, but we tend to close them too fast.
4270.12s:  And then we let losing trades run because we don't like the sensation of realizing loss.
4275.12s:  So in this case, the way that I would think about it is not if my option is up X%.
4281.12s:  If I'm trading long calls directionally, that's the only other reason a trade long calls is for a directional thesis.
4287.12s:  I'm going to craft my directional thesis first. The profit mechanism comes first.
4292.12s:  Then the structure and strategy.
4295.12s:  The profit mechanism is directionally for whatever reason. I think it's going to go up.
4299.12s:  It comes up here to 55 from there. I say, okay.
4303.12s:  I'm going to follow it and I'm going to set a stop below wherever I think near term support might be.
4309.12s:  Let's call it right here at 5424.
4312.12s:  So regardless of what my long option is doing at this point, it doesn't matter.
4317.12s:  What matters is what the underlying is doing.
4319.12s:  I'm going to get out across this below here. I'm going to get out.
4322.12s:  If it doesn't, I'm just going to let it go.
4324.12s:  So now it rallies back up. So then what I do is I don't just say, well, okay, my stop was way down here.
4329.12s:  What I'm doing is I'm following the trend to capture profit.
4333.12s:  Now I might say, okay, I'm going to wait for the short term moving average to flatten.
4338.12s:  And I want to see a mid term moving average also turned to a negative slope.
4344.12s:  So I'm going to continue sideways or starts to go down from there. I'm going to get out.
4349.12s:  So where does that happen? Or you could just slowly move up your stop into the next periods that you see some sort of supporter resistance.
4359.12s:  But the total point I'm trying to make here is that it can't be this arbitrary thing.
4363.12s:  My option changed price. It is everything to do about whatever your profit mechanism is in how you capture that.
4372.12s:  So let me know if that answers your question.
4379.12s:  A route of baga says, let's say I'd like to buy 100 shares of some stock at a certain price.
4384.12s:  Wouldn't it be better to sell cash covered put with that strike rather than buying it out right? No.
4389.12s:  Not at all. It would not inherently be better.
4395.12s:  Mr. Rude a baga, why do you think I say that? Why do you think it would not be inherently better?
4404.12s:  Any ideas?
4407.12s:  Or anybody else?
4415.12s:  There's a very specific reason.
4423.12s:  No guesses so far. That surprises me. Also shout out to you guys. We have 60 people in here.
4428.12s:  I think this might be the biggest stream I've had, which is absolutely awesome.
4433.12s:  I love the fact that so many people are interested in learning about options on a Friday night.
4439.12s:  Rude a baga says, I thought I'd get the 100 shares at that price anyway, plus the premium. Yep.
4444.12s:  So what are you doing right now? It's the thing that we talked about before.
4447.12s:  You're focusing on the scenario that you like.
4451.12s:  Talk to me about the bad scenario. When would this be bad? When would this hurt you?
4457.12s:  Jay says if the underlying moves too far down, not necessarily you would have the same downside risk as the long shares.
4464.12s:  Big A says selling the put doesn't give the upside potential that's way more close to being correct.
4470.12s:  There's a very specific reason. Think of it this way.
4474.12s:  What if we think Wells Fargo is going to go up and let's say in this scenario, there you go.
4480.12s:  Big has got it. If price goes up and I don't get anything, that's exactly right.
4484.12s:  So this is the wait for a pullback thing.
4487.12s:  So in this case, let's say that you think it's going to go up.
4490.12s:  You do all your analysis. You have a bullish thesis.
4492.12s:  So you think you're going to be really slick and sell a put in order to acquire the position.
4498.12s:  What happens if it goes up? What happens if it does what you want?
4503.12s:  Well, now what do you wait? You made money on your put. That's awesome.
4507.12s:  But now it's more expensive than where you wanted it before.
4510.12s:  So now do you buy it when it's even more expensive or do you try selling another put and see if you can get it with the premium on that one.
4517.12s:  Well, then what happens if it doesn't come back?
4520.12s:  You've now placed a series of limited profit trades on a thesis that turned out to be correct and you have nothing to show for it.
4528.12s:  Because you were being too cheap and you didn't want to pay up for the position and you're trying to get it at a discount via short put premiums.
4539.12s:  Now again, everything has a middle ground that doesn't mean it never makes sense to sell puts.
4547.12s:  But what it does mean is that if you're using cash secured puts to acquire a position, you also should be ready to just buy shares outright when it makes sense.
4557.12s:  So that's the way I would think about that.
4564.12s:  A fan of airplanes. It's a good question. Can't you collect premium immediately? Yeah, you collect a premium immediately, but it's tied to an open trade.
4572.12s:  So it's essentially you're just essentially being like an escrow account. It's still tied to an open trade.
4580.12s:  Great questions.
4584.12s:  Let's get rid of these.
4588.12s:  Let's take a quick look at these other questions.
4593.12s:  I want to make sure that I have a chance to hit these.
4598.12s:  Uh oh, we get to move these out here.
4603.12s:  Get rid of that.
4606.12s:  I think we spent a while talking about defending positions. That's perfect.
4614.12s:  The end of airplanes says my thinking would be it only makes sense to sell puts if you think in prices going down. Well, why would that make sense?
4621.12s:  If price is going down, that's the wrong direction.
4624.12s:  If you're selling puts, it's a bullish trade. You want it to go up.
4629.12s:  Why would you sell puts, which is a bullish position and want something to go up if something is going down?
4637.12s:  Now over to this to big case is how do you find companies to trade options? Yeah, well, you can scan. That's the easiest way.
4646.12s:  So if you come in here and you look at different scans, you can look things that are optionable and have weeklies.
4652.12s:  This is like a very intense premium scan that I use. So all of these things have options and they have weeklies that doesn't mean I'm going to trade all of them.
4660.12s:  Some of them won't be liquid or whatever, but that's the easiest way is to start with scanning.
4666.12s:  Now to the broader question, I think you're asking is like, how do you find trades?
4670.12s:  That really comes down to what profit mechanism you're trying to transact against. And that's the very, very, very first step bar none.
4679.12s:  So let me find a video for you on scanning for options trades.
4686.12s:  There you go. That video will go pretty far in a detail on that.
4691.12s:  Lord, is this people think it goes down so you sell the put because you know it's going to go up or consolidating at worst.
4699.12s:  Yeah, but but again, the yeah, exactly. It's kind of a broken mindset.
4705.12s:  The Anavair plane says.
4709.12s:  My thinking that would make sense if you sell puts everything prices going down to acquire shares.
4715.12s:  The problem with that is again, why would you want to acquire shares and something that's going down.
4721.12s:  This again is kind of the propensity for our mind to try and focus on like the positive aspect of something, but not the total aspect.
4733.12s:  Because in that scenario, could you sell a put that then you get assigned at and then something runs up and out and you got it at a great price.
4740.12s:  Sure, that could happen. But at the very base of things, why on earth would you want to acquire shares if they're going down.
4749.12s:  For me, it's a function of waiting until the shares are doing what I want them to.
4755.12s:  Then I will entertain entering a position, whether it's to shorter to go long.
4760.12s:  But there's no reason to try to get in while it's moving because we think that it's kind of smart or slick or like a way to be cheaper.
4768.12s:  I just think that you end up losing way more money that way.
4771.12s:  Rudevega says very informative. I'm glad I found this channel. That's awesome. Yeah.
4775.12s:  The thing is is I know what I know, right? Like I know my skill set and I know that a lot of retail traders struggle.
4783.12s:  So I think one of the main reasons why I do this stuff is because people get surrounded with what I consider to be really bad.
4795.12s:  Like really bad information, unfortunately. So yeah, I love doing this stuff.
4801.12s:  Trace says, shout out to the free discord. Come hang out. Yeah.
4804.12s:  Everybody, you know that we have a completely free discord to join that everybody is welcome into. Let me grab a link to it.
4813.12s:  I think this one only lasts for like seven days. But yeah, come on in. If you want to hang out and chat more options, we're always here.
4821.12s:  All right, let's get to this one. Do a tutorial about bold put spreads and call debit spreads. How to find the entry and exit point and how to select strikes DTE.
4833.12s:  Yeah. So actually I would not do this personally. I would not trade these spreads. But the short answer to this is actually quite simple.
4843.12s:  To find the entry is entirely dependent again on the profit mechanism. You have to start with the profit mechanism traders make the same mistake all the time.
4853.12s:  They're worried about all of these ancillary details. But again, the entry and exit point is not based on the options. It's based on the underlying theme in the disposition towards the underlying.
4865.12s:  So that's the first part. Then selection of strikes come down to what risk profile you want for your spreads. That also will very, very tightly tie into the width of your spreads.
4879.12s:  And then days expiration again comes down to kind of that standard selection process based on the balance of how long you want to trade open, how much money that you will collect in this case for the bull put spread.
4895.12s:  The call debit spread is kind of inverse of that because we're paying. So then this comes down to how much theta do you want to decay out.
4904.12s:  Stuff like that. You long sons can you define profit make that mechanism as you think about it. Yeah, definitely. I think I have a video that talks about that which one. I think this one.
4923.12s:  But the so that will just go further in a detail. But the way to think about profit mechanism is really simple. It's the thing that makes money. It's the part of the trade that actually makes money.
4940.12s:  The first thing you can kind of remind yourself is options are literally just tradable vehicles. They're just things we can trade. They need some sort of condition to make money. That's the profit mechanism.
4955.12s:  So whatever that condition is that yields profit is the profit mechanism. So a simple profit mechanism. If you want something to go up. That's a profit mechanism.
4969.12s:  Something goes down. That's a profit mechanism. implied volatility trending over realized volatility variance. There's premium. That's a profit mechanism momentum premium. That's a profit.
4980.12s:  All these different things that actually yield profit is the profit mechanism options and then the various structures and strategies. Those are simply how we're attempting to capture the profit mechanism.
4996.12s:  So if you're trading again, for example, let's take a look at one of these. I have a bunch of these on right now. Well, we have this one on right now. B Y and E. I'm trading a variance risk premium play in here, which means I'm trading the persistence of implied volatility over realized volatility.
5014.12s:  Why am I doing that? Very, very simple because implied volatility continues to trend a lot over realized volatility. So what is my profit mechanism variance risk premiums. That's how this trade makes money.
5030.12s:  How do I capitalize on that? I can trade short straddles. I can trade short strangles. I can trade iron butterflies. I can trade short iron condors. Those are all different ways I can capitalize on the profit mechanism. But the mechanism is that in and of itself.
5047.12s:  You long song says so it's the root of your thesis. Yeah, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think the way I would define it is it's the it's the modality. Whatever your thesis is, it's the modality that your thesis makes money through.
5065.12s:  So you can have a thesis that a stock is going to go up down sideways or whatever, but whatever you think will lead to profit or what is the actual function that leads to profit is what I would consider the profit mechanism.
5079.12s:  That's a good question.
5083.12s:  All right, so let's take a look at a few things. We actually talked about option liquidity. We already talked about expiration liquidity. When we talk about expiration volatility.
5101.12s:  When we're talking about volatility with options, there are really a bunch of different kinds. We talked about that in a bunch of the earlier videos. So I want to focus a little bit more on these different.
5113.12s:  Volatility for expiration and what that can mean. So as we know implied volatility is forward looking and we know that it's tied to a specific timeframe. So as things have different amounts of time to work, we tend to expect larger moves over that time frame, but you'll notice.
5134.12s:  Interestingly enough that you can have things that are further out in time that have a bigger expected move than something that has higher implied volatility.
5146.12s:  Right, so in this case, this is 140 DTE or something like that or 49 maybe this is the 140.
5153.12s:  And the IV here is 133 with a 5.5 dollar expected move, but if we go further out, this is a $16 expected move, but this is only a 115% fall. Why?
5168.12s:  Anybody have any ideas why that would be the case.
5174.12s:  Think about what volatility measures. It's variance over time.
5184.12s:  So in this case, when we look at this, this is expecting relative to this time frame, a bigger move relative to the time frame.
5196.12s:  That's why you will see expiration volatility move like that. Now you can use this for a lot of things. It's very informative. You can trade the difference between these different expiration cycles.
5208.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5212.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5216.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5220.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5224.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5228.12s:  And so, you can use this for a lot of things.
5232.12s:  That's probably better suited for the first or second video in this series.
5238.12s:  We went through basic option structures that talk about the upside potential.
5244.12s:  So, I think that would be a good place for you to start if you haven't seen those.
5248.12s:  Alan says, better chance of something that's going to happen.
5250.12s:  Yes, so you guys are correct in terms of your perception of the implied move as a dollar amount.
5256.12s:  Right? So, in this case, we can see that the dollar move here is $16 that has more time to move.
5260.12s:  What I'm highlighting though is that there are shorter duration trades that have a smaller implied move as a dollar amount, but a bigger IV meaning implied volatility.
5274.12s:  Right? Again, so here, the expected move is only $2.73.
5278.12s:  Out here, it's $16. But out here, implied volatility is 115% and here, it's all the way up to 139.5%.
5290.12s:  So, this is because of what I was talking about, the expected move against a relative time frame.
5298.12s:  That's why you guys are absolutely right.
5302.12s:  We expect things to have a wider range the further out you go, but implied volatility is relative to time frames.
5308.12s:  This is the problem. This is why that is.
5312.12s:  Ruin, Ruin City says the less people trading it longer out.
5316.12s:  That's part of it, but that's not the nutshell of it.
5320.12s:  What, again, what this means is that out here, even though it's really long duration, this has a smaller relative range to this time frame.
5330.12s:  That's all.
5333.12s:  So, we can use these expiration cycles, a hunt for different opportunities.
5338.12s:  We can look for periods where this is at 234%. This one's down at 112. This one's at 100. This one's at 117.
5346.12s:  So, once you develop relationships with products and models, you can trade the relative volatility of different time frames.
5353.12s:  You can also look for events that are coming up.
5356.12s:  Why does this go from 100 to 117 to back down to 102? Why is that?
5363.12s:  Typically, that means that there's some sort of announcement coming out, some sort of news release.
5367.12s:  Could be earnings.
5369.12s:  Earnings in here is not until the 5th of August.
5371.12s:  So, it's something else that's doing it. I just don't know what.
5375.12s:  But if we keep going out, we now know that earnings in the 5th of August.
5378.12s:  But let's take a look at the expiration cycles that capture that.
5382.12s:  Notice how implied volatility goes from 90 to 140.
5387.12s:  This is clearly a massive expansion in volatility. And it's because this expiration cycle encapsulates that earnings release.
5397.12s:  So, you can learn a lot by looking at just this.
5401.12s:  The other thing you can do is plot the implied volatility.
5405.12s:  I like to use out of the money options.
5409.12s:  Jason says this volatility correlate with liquidity, definitely.
5413.12s:  So, volatility has an impact on liquidity.
5417.12s:  You need enough volatility for a market to be active.
5421.12s:  But if you have a market that has too much volatility, it decreases liquidity.
5426.12s:  So, there's definitely a relationship between those high volatility actually becomes kind of like a natural stock market circuit breaker.
5436.12s:  Spreads get really, really wide when volatility comes in super high.
5443.12s:  Sunny says, B Y and D is a meme play by the way.
5447.12s:  I don't understand. What do you mean for what?
5452.12s:  For this?
5461.12s:  And so, anyways, you can also look at a volatility smile down here. So, let's take a look at something like Apple.
5468.12s:  This has a pretty standard volatility smile.
5472.12s:  Now, this will be a little confusing because there are a squish down.
5475.12s:  But essentially, this is just looking at the implied volatility for all of the out of the money options.
5479.12s:  This gives us an idea of if the market is pricing in things to the downside to the upside.
5486.12s:  Sunny says a lot of hype for another squeeze play soon. Oh, I see.
5490.12s:  Yeah, I think the problem, honestly, with those kinds of things to be honest, is like, you have to be careful with at least for me.
5497.12s:  I trade things as they are.
5500.12s:  The theories and stuff like that I find really interesting.
5503.12s:  But they're not bulletproof, unfortunately.
5507.12s:  So, like this week originally was supposed to be some sort of big massive week and it turned out to be absolutely nothing.
5513.12s:  So, I think squeezes are interesting.
5516.12s:  But the way that I trade them is when they're happening. I'm not trying to front run them personally.
5521.12s:  And it's because I know that I can't time them that well.
5524.12s:  I don't try to front run pretty much anything.
5526.12s:  So, yeah, a slightly different approach there.
5530.12s:  But anyways, back to the volatility smile, where we see higher implied volatility is where the market is pricing in movement.
5536.12s:  That's the way to think about that.
5538.12s:  There's a lot of different ways that you can navigate through this options chain and learn all different kinds of things.
5543.12s:  If you look through the recent series I've been doing on the daily with things like GameStop, you actually have a pretty cool visual of me applying a lot of this analysis.
5557.12s:  Let me grab the playlist to that.
5560.12s:  Actually, I just grabbed the most recent video. I think they're all linked in there.
5566.12s:  This one. This one's this one's pretty good. This one's talking about chewy and GameStop because there is some interesting activity between both of those actually.
5578.12s:  All right.
5584.12s:  Peter says don't think Eric is playing squeeze VRP. Yep, that's exactly right.
5588.12s:  In B.I. and D at least.
5593.12s:  Because I can for for my visual, I can see a very clear persistent high elevated implied volatility relative to realized.
5604.12s:  So that's literally all I'm trading.
5606.12s:  If there's some sort of squeeze between these cycles, which you can see them like it's a thing, but this one was tied to earnings.
5613.12s:  And then this one came not so different after earnings slightly different. So this one's a little more anomalous, I think.
5619.12s:  But yeah, even these squeezes, which is funny for my style strategies, it wouldn't even hurt me in these products.
5626.12s:  And it's because there's so much volatility. Right.
5629.12s:  So you can see where my stop is up to the upside, 867.
5633.12s:  So even if we get one of these squeezes from a relative basis, which here it's essentially a full point higher.
5639.12s:  So this squeeze you can move it down from 878 down to 778 on a relative basis and it would still be well within my range.
5647.12s:  So yeah, this is just very interesting.
5650.12s:  I'm looking at K.R.H. says what broker platform this is think or swim.
5656.12s:  It's actually so crazy to me that so many people don't know what this is, which is not your guys' fault.
5662.12s:  Right. It's just a change of what people use now.
5665.12s:  But I've used this literally my entire trading career. So it's so novel to me that everybody is so used to using other products.
5673.12s:  Because this was like the only show in town for a while between this and interactive brokers.
5678.12s:  Like those are the primary things you could use previously for quite a while.
5684.12s:  It sounds like my Buffalo wild wings just got here, but I don't have to hop off just yet.
5690.12s:  If you guys have any last minute things that you want to take a look at, let me know.
5694.12s:  I'm down.
5696.12s:  Oh no, it's not I lied to you. It's not my dinner. We have plenty of time.
5701.12s:  Or is it? No, we have plenty of time. I completely lied. It was my wife.
5706.12s:  Not. I don't think cannibalism is on the docket.
5712.12s:  Now, Alan says if you had the money to buy a lot of shares at one time, how much time does a market at what?
5719.12s:  How much time does a money maker have?
5726.12s:  Alan, you're you're questioning, are you talking about market makers?
5730.12s:  So they they have a standard process for settlement.
5738.12s:  So yeah, they they have quite a while.
5744.12s:  Are the working investors says can sell options on futures on thinkors? Yeah, definitely.
5750.12s:  So if we take a look at a futures contract, we take a look at the eminies.
5756.12s:  And we pop over here to the trade tab. You can see that it has the futures contracts, which are Delta one products.
5763.12s:  And it's the options relative to them all the way down here. So yeah, absolutely.
5770.12s:  Funny says, can you shut in the lay on the dark pool data, particularly all the high premiums in the Russell indices placed after hours.
5776.12s:  Yeah, so dark pools are interesting because I think people I want.
5782.12s:  I don't think the name helps it. But I think people are kind of well, at least retail traders are very regularly looking for like a buggy man, like a place where the evil stuff is happening.
5792.12s:  And there's a really great book on this.
5797.12s:  This one right here, dark pools. And I've read it before I've just downloaded it again to Kindle because I want to read it again.
5804.12s:  But you can learn a lot about how dark pools actually transact.
5809.12s:  The long story short is it's important to understand their impact on the markets.
5814.12s:  And they do have an impact on the markets. But it's also not necessarily this evil place.
5821.12s:  Although it is absolutely too obscure in my opinion, like I think the fact that it's not as transparent.
5829.12s:  I don't like that. But I also understand and recognize the impact it has on market liquidity instability, which is a thing.
5839.12s:  So all I'm trying to highlight there is it's not all bad. A lot of people want to demonize something. And it has a lot of bad aspects.
5847.12s:  As I mentioned, I'm not a giant fan. I would love some pretty significant reform of them.
5852.12s:  But they're not all bad.
5855.12s:  Rointit, he says it suppresses prices, recovery does it absolutely does not help with price discovery.
5861.12s:  But if you're looking at when price discovery occurs, it is on lit exchanges.
5871.12s:  And if you compare where the dark pools are transacting at, it's typically not at super advantageous prices relative to market price.
5882.12s:  So I agree with you. It's not helping with price discovery. But it's also not this place where people are getting crazy great steals on every single trade they put out.
5894.12s:  It's yeah, I think the other thing to keep in mind is giant block orders can be really difficult to move and they can really hurt liquidity to some degrees.
5906.12s:  So I think by decreasing some of that, there is a small positive. Again, it's all relative. I'm not advocating for them or against them. But I can clearly assess that there is pros and cons to them is all.
5921.12s:  So yeah, I'm not really sure that that is necessarily shedding a lot of data for your question, sunny.
5927.12s:  But yeah, he says is dark pool data free. I don't know if it's free.
5935.12s:  I have right now I'm doing like a test with unusual whales because I might be becoming affiliate for them. If you guys like the product, that's a main reason why I would honestly do it is and I've told them this too.
5947.12s:  I think the tools cool. They have like a neat user interface, but I don't really.
5954.12s:  I don't really use it. I typically import most of my stuff.
5962.12s:  Florida kids says all data is free to an extent usually just yeah, and it also depends on the kind of data because tons of trading data is not free at all, but I get your point.
5972.12s:  But anyways, this is these are dark pool orders. So you can see let's see this let's find something that went through let's use apple here.
5982.12s:  I still had a 2000 share position come through at 211 70 and this was at 1700. So let's take a look at apple.
5997.12s:  Like they you see what I mean, they didn't get some steel of a price.
6002.12s:  It came in at a dollar over where it's at now now they might have moved the market. I don't actually don't think for a trade that size is not even that big of a trade.
6010.12s:  I don't think for a trade that size that it would have moved too much, but that's not like some sort of super advantageous position for them.
6016.12s:  The main thing is they got liquidity. That's the thing. So yeah, it's it's important again, it's important to be aware of dark pools, how they behave, how they transact.
6027.12s:  But I think it's just important for retail traders to do our absolute best to remain as objective as possible and as we're analyzing these different components.
6036.12s:  I think the fact that they're not more transparent is frustrating. I don't like that. I don't like that you have to have these different kind of tools to access the data.
6045.12s:  That's just shitty. So I'm not a fan of that. I think all of this should be on blast for everybody to see. But it does serve somewhat of a purpose at the same time.
6056.12s:  Let's see.
6063.12s:  Back up. Don't insist on just now getting an alerting max pain. Can you explain it if it has max importance. Yep, I have a video on it for you. It's not that important is what it boils down to.
6074.12s:  It's again, it's another example where retail traders are kind of trying to find a bogeyman. And again, it does happen. I do think that there is a level of market manipulation of prices very close to things.
6085.12s:  But market makers overall are at the behest of order flow. So they can influence pricing. They cannot drive pricing all over the place.
6097.12s:  Because if persistent order flow comes in in a specific direction, they literally are slaved to it. They can't they can't change it. There's subject to order flow.
6107.12s:  So that video there is about max pain. Peter is laughing because I use the video game cover in the title, because I thought it was hilarious.
6116.12s:  But yeah, so max pain is a tendency or this theory that people think that market makers manipulate markets as it gets closer to wherever the highest dollar value of options will expire worth.
6132.12s:  So you can take a look at. John says, yeah, exactly what I was thinking market makers to have premium expire worth is yeah, they're going to make their money. That's the thing. They like they they have essentially a way provided that they manage their book well.
6148.12s:  They capture the bit asked spread they have their money. So they can be super greedy and they can be fucked up like no doubt about any of that. But all I'm saying is that some people they'll look at price and they'll be like, oh, well, it was max pain. It was all market manipulation.
6162.12s:  And it's like dog, the stock was like $5 away from what you were trying to get it to like that doesn't really matter. So yeah, there's an element of it though. I think I absolutely think that let's say for example apple.
6177.12s:  21062 let's say it was a smaller stock really difficult to do in like these really, really big floating stocks. But let's say that it was like 2 2 10 99.
6189.12s:  And let's say that there was a ton of overall option value at 211. There's very much a chance that the market makers would try to suppress that price. There's very much a chance.
6200.12s:  But it's not like if max pain is at like 215 here that and this is now trading at like 220.
6208.12s:  Like the market makers aren't going to be able to drive this down $5. That's very difficult, especially in massive products like that.
6216.12s:  So.
6218.12s:  Van Aver plain say AMC perfect example close just short of five again it could exhibit tendencies you can't we cannot conclude that this is because it was manipulated.
6231.12s:  We can make inferences we could think that that that that is the case in that sphere. It's completely fair.
6237.12s:  But it's also you can't directly conclude it.
6242.12s:  In this case it did have really strong buying volume which is interesting. I do find this one a little curious.
6250.12s:  Gotta absolutely concede the point.
6253.12s:  Let's see.
6256.12s:  Yeah.
6260.12s:  I call this one sus this one looks sus to me.
6264.12s:  I think this is a really good example because there's massive OI at the strike.
6278.12s:  I think that this is a really really really interesting case again being completely objective.
6285.12s:  This doesn't immediately mean yes this was manipulated.
6295.12s:  But it looks like a dog.
6298.12s:  Barks like a dog.
6301.12s:  I'm thinking it might be a dog.
6303.12s:  But I can't see it can't see it could be like a mimicking and putcha monkey or something that might not be exactly it.
6313.12s:  But it looks sus.
6315.12s:  So yeah, that's literally a fantastic example.
6318.12s:  Fan of airplanes.
6321.12s:  Let's go back up.
6326.12s:  Radrical can you look at snap. I can do that on Monday. I want to get through like the more substantive questions first.
6335.12s:  So I think that's really good.
6338.12s:  I think that's really good.
6341.12s:  But Shinsasu says isn't it like a moving average.
6345.12s:  I don't remember which part.
6347.12s:  We're talking about like a moving average.
6351.12s:  Let me know what.
6352.12s:  What that was referring to.
6355.12s:  Rootabake says when I buy options tells me the probability of profit is that reliable. Yeah.
6359.12s:  It's using options data as it is.
6361.12s:  It's misleading.
6362.12s:  So I think that's the probability of everything changes essentially as soon as time changes.
6367.12s:  It's a time series.
6369.12s:  So if we look at I WM.
6371.12s:  We all know we got look at some I WM.
6374.12s:  And I look out here.
6376.12s:  And I see the probability, which is this one.
6379.12s:  There's probability of being in the money at expiration and a probability of touch.
6383.12s:  Right.
6384.12s:  So let's just use this example.
6386.12s:  Let's say that we're looking at this 30 delta probability of in the money is 28.57 probability of touches 55.75.
6394.12s:  Now let's say that it's the same day in I WM rallies.
6398.12s:  And let's say that we go from pretend that I WM goes up.
6404.12s:  Five points.
6406.12s:  So that would mean that the at the money's our strike would now look like this strike.
6411.12s:  It would behave like these two or three.
6413.12s:  So it would be two away instead, but it would look like these.
6415.12s:  Now take a look at the probabilities.
6417.12s:  The probability of it being in the money is 51%.
6420.12s:  The probability of it touching and falling in the money temporarily is 99%.
6426.12s:  So the probabilities move is what this means.
6430.12s:  So yes, at the time of entry, the probability is whatever it tells you it is, but the probabilities will move.
6436.12s:  They're adaptive.
6438.12s:  They're based on a time series.
6439.12s:  They're not discrete.
6443.12s:  Florida kids says those probabilities are predictions not definite.
6446.12s:  Be careful.
6447.12s:  Well, it's important, right?
6448.12s:  Like that's what probabilities are.
6450.12s:  It's a it's a assessment.
6452.12s:  But the reason why it's not definite is because they change as the underlying changes.
6460.12s:  Alan says so market makers can do what they want.
6463.12s:  So why play options?
6465.12s:  It's because they're not out to get you like the vast majority of the time.
6468.12s:  I know people really try to like dig down at the end.
6472.12s:  Dig down at market makers, but the vast majority of them are providing liquidity to capture the bid-ask spread.
6478.12s:  So again, there's always bad actors and just about everything.
6482.12s:  But they can't do whatever they want.
6484.12s:  That's actually kind of my my previous point.
6486.12s:  There's subject to order flow.
6489.12s:  They can't move price wherever they want it to go.
6491.12s:  Otherwise, nobody would play in the markets for that exact reason.
6494.12s:  But we know that they can't does that mean that they can't slightly manipulate things.
6499.12s:  I bet they could. I can't prove it, but I bet they could.
6502.12s:  And there's a lot of studies out there on it that try to prove it.
6506.12s:  But it's still inconclusive technically speaking from a definitive standpoint.
6510.12s:  So yeah, it's one of those things where could it happen?
6514.12s:  Absolutely.
6515.12s:  It would be ignorant to pretend that it couldn't happen.
6517.12s:  And do they have incentive to do it?
6519.12s:  Absolutely.
6520.12s:  But that doesn't mean that it's happening all the time everywhere.
6524.12s:  And you can't trade markets.
6526.12s:  Yeah.
6530.12s:  John says don't they hedge against positions to.
6532.12s:  And they're the ones selling the options more often than not.
6535.12s:  They'll be on the other side of a trade.
6537.12s:  And that's exactly correct.
6539.12s:  Their primary profit is the bit asked spread.
6541.12s:  They that's where they're transacting at.
6543.12s:  And they hedge their risks so that they can capture the bit asked spread.
6551.12s:  Sunny says is there a chance market makers create volume in an options chain?
6557.12s:  Yeah, they they can transact there.
6560.12s:  Does it mean that they're just piling a bunch of those positions on in their books?
6564.12s:  I don't think so.
6565.12s:  My guess is for these super far out of the money contracts is I think that it's a bunch of retail traders that are making really bad choices.
6573.12s:  So let's take a look at.
6576.12s:  I'm still learning the tools so you have to bear with me just a little bit.
6579.12s:  I don't know.
6580.12s:  Yeah, this looks right.
6584.12s:  And let's take a look at GameStop because this is actually really great example over the past week with those 128s.
6590.12s:  Let's look at the past two weeks.
6593.12s:  Here.
6596.12s:  So this is one of the cool things I find about unusual whales is that you can pretty easily limit by stuff like this.
6601.12s:  I don't I haven't found a way to export it.
6603.12s:  I actually shop them an email.
6605.12s:  I use for me.
6606.12s:  I like to consolidate all this stuff.
6608.12s:  If you watched my video from earlier today.
6610.12s:  I I like create these little dashboards that let me actually see the things that I want to see.
6616.12s:  So I can show you an example of what I typically do is compared to this.
6619.12s:  But this is like really nice information to have.
6622.12s:  So it's not like it's bad or anything.
6626.12s:  This is just going to take a minute to load because it's not small.
6632.12s:  That's what I tell everybody.
6634.12s:  So if we untick this.
6640.12s:  That's not what I wanted.
6645.12s:  So this is just raw options data from today.
6648.12s:  So I typically clean it like that.
6650.12s:  And then for you guys, I create these little visuals so that we can see what transactions happen when and where.
6660.12s:  Again, this is kind of what I like to do.
6664.12s:  But something like unusual whales is pretty convenient because it offers a bigger view.
6670.12s:  The other thing I like to do is just aggregate the bigger things from TNS.
6674.12s:  So this is actually from GameStop today.
6676.12s:  This is also from the video today.
6678.12s:  But these are yeah, just kind of like different ways you can view the data.
6681.12s:  So that's one of the things.
6683.12s:  I don't know if you can do that in this yet.
6685.12s:  I shot them an email to ask because I really want to be able to export this.
6688.12s:  And I want to look at like all of the data raptor at least 25 calls over a specific set in time.
6693.12s:  But anyways, let's take a look at these 128s.
6697.12s:  You can filter here, which is really nice, but.
6700.12s:  I like to see more than that.
6702.12s:  What am I doing here?
6703.12s:  I'm trying to look at this expiration, which was the 28th.
6708.12s:  And I'm trying to look at the one 28s.
6714.12s:  And I just want to look at the size.
6716.12s:  I want to look at that size of the data.
6718.12s:  Yeah, see like isn't that topical in and of itself right now.
6721.12s:  I have it set to filter for 250.
6724.12s:  Transactions and I'm realizing that.
6727.12s:  There's got to be something wrong here.
6728.12s:  I don't know what.
6733.12s:  I have this for the past two weeks.
6736.12s:  That looks correct.
6737.12s:  Maybe I'll go to the past three weeks.
6741.12s:  Oh, stock.
6742.12s:  That's why I'm an idiot.
6744.12s:  Stock is not strike price, by the way, gang.
6748.12s:  Sometimes I do such stupid things.
6752.12s:  So if we look at the volume,
6756.12s:  or let's look at the actual site like this, right?
6758.12s:  Somebody bought the, they spent $152 on these calls.
6765.12s:  They spent $161. They spent $294. They spent $494.
6769.12s:  They spent $325. The point I'm trying to make is this is just a lot of people
6772.12s:  placing really small positions, hoping they get a massive payout.
6776.12s:  That's what this is. Even this, like this is still, well, even more interesting,
6780.12s:  these are sale trades, right? Because these are coming in at the bid.
6784.12s:  So let's get rid of mid and bid.
6790.12s:  And this, and let's like just look at the offer.
6794.12s:  So we know that these are buys.
6796.12s:  Look at all these small, tiny trades.
6798.12s:  This is just people hoping something works.
6802.12s:  That's what it comes down to. Even this trade, it looks big, $3,000.
6806.12s:  It's $24,000. Like this is a small trade still.
6810.12s:  So the point I'm trying to make here is that the vast majority of the people
6816.12s:  based on the breadth of evidence I have available look very much to be
6822.12s:  hopeful retail traders essentially praying something moves in their favor.
6826.12s:  That's typically what I'm seeing here overall.
6830.12s:  So yeah, I don't think that that's market makers trying to manipulate the price
6834.12s:  a bunch out there. I just don't see that.
6836.12s:  Again, they can because they also can use options to offset positions in their book if they want.
6842.12s:  Cool. Well, looks like we're calming down here.
6848.12s:  Looks like you guys are slowing down on the questions, which is great.
6852.12s:  I'm the bounce. I hope the session was great for you guys.
6856.12s:  I will do another one this next week. I don't know how long I'm going to go with these.
6860.12s:  I don't mind it though. Like I enjoy doing the beginner series.
6864.12s:  And I think doing it on a Friday is good.
6866.12s:  So I'll keep running these forward.
6868.12s:  And I'll think about what I want to do in the next one.
6871.12s:  If you have suggestions, obviously the Q&A is the best part.
6874.12s:  I think you get specific answers.
6876.12s:  So always feel free to drop those in.
6878.12s:  But if there's a specific topic or something like that that you want us to take a look at in the next series, let me know.
6881.12s:  Otherwise, I'm going to plan on doing more trade reviews to walk through kind of the entire process of thinking of a trade idea, quantifying the profit mechanism, thinking about placing a trade and kind of walk you guys through that.
6895.12s:  All right, you guys.
6899.12s:  I'll see you all throughout the weekend. Don't forget to join the discord is completely free. Be an outlier.
6905.12s:  I'll see you guys later.
