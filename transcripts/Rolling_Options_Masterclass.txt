0.24s: nothing says Master Class like a
1.96s: shirtless dude so today we're going to
4.76s: talk about rolling options and I'm going
7.32s: to walk you through a quick overview of
9.36s: what it is you probably already know I
11.28s: want to get into some of the mechanics
12.72s: that people mess up quite literally all
14.72s: the time and then at the end of the
16.00s: video I want to walk you through a bunch
18.08s: of best practices and kind of some
20.20s: commonly asked questions to make sure
22.64s: that we're fully thinking through this
24.44s: process because I can tell you from my
26.60s: own experience and what I regularly see
30.04s: in places like Reddit and on my YouTube
32.92s: comments are when people talk about
35.00s: rolling options it is very clear that we
37.36s: don't fully understand them the first
39.20s: time we see them we have an immediate
41.08s: perception that this is the greatest
42.80s: thing ever it's going to fix all of our
44.28s: problems we can just roll things and
46.20s: everything's great and that's not so
48.44s: much of the case so I want to walk you
50.08s: through exactly that we're going to talk
51.96s: about things like when's the best time
53.48s: to roll should you roll out or up or in
57.20s: or down all of those things are on the
60.20s: docket so what's up everybody welcome
62.00s: back to the outliers and a shout out to
63.76s: the patreon family the people in the
65.56s: patreon actually get free access to the
69.12s: shop weekly workshops so if what I do
71.88s: helps you out consider signing up link
74.28s: in the notes below let's get right to it
76.28s: so here is the beginning what is rolling
79.44s: really simple it's closing a trade
81.32s: entering a new one the what
83.16s: differentiates rolling from closing a
85.48s: trade and opening a new one simple we
88.04s: tie the accounting together so what does
91.56s: that look like in practice well we have
94.16s: the first trade where we enter then we
96.24s: exit and then we enter again so where's
98.80s: the role in this instance right there so
100.96s: as we enter this first trade it's on
103.00s: it's working then we choose to exit it
105.12s: and then enter a new one and tie the
107.64s: accounting between this position and
110.36s: this new opened position together so
112.96s: what does this look like in terms of
114.20s: money well in this first trade if we
116.56s: sell to open uh put I just picked a
118.60s: random one for a dollar
120.40s: then we close it for
123.04s: $2 what happened here Prett simple we
126.80s: realized a $100 loss we collected $1 we
131.92s: closed the trade for $2 that means we
135.24s: give up the dollar that we collected up
137.16s: front and then we give up another dollar
139.56s: on top of that that is $100 because
142.52s: obviously you multiply this out by 100
144.96s: for options this is where the trade
147.28s: lands so where's the roll it's right
149.96s: here if we buy to close at two bucks and
153.00s: then we sell to open at whatever price
155.48s: you've now completed a role common
157.48s: misconception is that roles are only
159.76s: conducted on losing positions you can
161.64s: roll a winning trade it's just in
164.20s: generality and parl when we talk about
166.20s: it it's normally referred to in the
168.88s: context of a losing trade which is
171.04s: actually quite telling when it comes to
172.84s: the mindset of when we roll and this is
175.56s: something I do want to speak about for
177.68s: just a second because it's a common
179.20s: problem people have have is that if this
181.20s: was a winning trade that you closed and
183.28s: then opened you probably wouldn't
185.24s: consider it a role why is that well it's
188.24s: because you're happy with your win
190.76s: that's off the books now we're entering
192.48s: a new trade you don't want to tie the
194.32s: accounting to it because you have a win
196.28s: but when we're rolling very frequently
198.60s: it's fueled by hope we hope this next
202.64s: trade overwhelms the loss of the
205.84s: previous trade so that's why we choose
208.92s: to account it together but again admin
211.64s: note you can roll winning trades as well
214.20s: it's just not commonly done or at least
216.28s: commonly referred to so let's say trade
219.24s: three continues to chug along it goes
221.08s: well and we close that for 50s what's
223.60s: happened here do you know what our
225.88s: realized p&l is at this point in this
228.84s: case we takeen 150 bucks we sold this
232.16s: option for two bucks 200 bucks we buy to
234.76s: close it for 50 cents 50 bucks that
237.28s: gives us positive $150
239.96s: so on this rolled position you will have
242.56s: realized a profit of $50 one of the
246.68s: dangers of rolling is that if you don't
250.24s: close this for the correct price then
252.76s: all of a sudden you can be compounding
255.32s: your loss so for example if you have
258.40s: this $100 realized loss we sell to open
261.12s: this new option for $2 then we buy to
263.52s: close it for $3 what happened in that
266.16s: scenario we realized another $100 loss
270.68s: so your net p&l at that point is
273.28s: negative
274.56s: $200 so if you keep going down that path
277.08s: and you don't ever get a price
278.44s: accommodation you have problems because
281.32s: you're going to continue compounding
283.56s: that losing position which is really
285.52s: really dangerous so let's talk about
288.88s: some best practices the first thing I
291.00s: want to walk us through is analyzing
293.68s: surrogate options this is a little bit
296.04s: esoteric so follow along and you can
299.04s: come back to this part if you need to
301.28s: fully understand what we're talking
302.76s: about but this is something I do all the
305.32s: time it's really useful let's come over
307.56s: here to XLF and I'm just picking a
310.20s: random stock and let's say you have a
312.20s: position on let's say you have this 33
314.44s: DTE and let's say when you originally
317.32s: sold your puts or let's say short calls
320.60s: so that we're getting ran over let's say
322.44s: you originally sold these 38 short calls
325.72s: and they were out of the money whenever
327.40s: you chose to sell them it doesn't matter
329.76s: but now they're in the money so we want
331.76s: to do a few things the first thing is we
333.56s: want to see if if we're at risk of early
335.60s: assignment that's a little bit of a
336.92s: different scenario we need to see if
338.28s: there's a dividend we need to see how
339.72s: much extrinsic value is left in the
341.32s: options kind of a different video
343.56s: concept but that's an overview of that
345.08s: at least then we want to figure out how
346.92s: much is intrinsic in extrinsic value and
349.28s: if you remember your options 101 you
351.72s: figure out your intrinsic value by how
353.76s: far in the money we are take that out of
355.64s: your premium and then whatever's left is
357.76s: your extrinsic value you can also look
360.56s: at the corresponding outof the- money
362.96s: option for a approximation it's not
365.84s: perfect but it's pretty close so in this
367.72s: case if I'm looking at these 38 short
370.88s: calls and I'm trying to figure out
373.00s: what's the extr extrinsic value look
375.52s: right over here it's about 30 cents
377.16s: something like that okay good so now
380.12s: we're faced with deciding different
383.08s: things like what does this look like if
386.76s: time passes what will the value of my
389.28s: option be how much extrinsic value will
391.88s: be left well you can either do the math
394.56s: you can run it through your black schs
396.36s: model that's no problem you can run it
397.68s: through a risk profile tool if your
399.40s: platform has it or you could do the easy
402.56s: option at least as far as I can tell and
404.88s: again it's not perfect but it's pretty
406.32s: close so let's say that we want to
408.56s: pretend that nothing has happened other
410.64s: than time has passed and we can look at
412.96s: this 12 DTE so even though our option is
417.12s: this 38 call 33 DT
420.12s: we can look at that same option that's
422.64s: just 12 DTE and we can see what it looks
425.52s: like compared to where it is now so in
427.68s: this case it's trading for kind of a
429.48s: really wide Market here let's just call
431.84s: it like 150 something like that and then
434.08s: if you look in here it's like 110 so
436.96s: over the course of this time frame you
439.44s: can see how much your option would
441.64s: change if nothing else changed and again
444.16s: markets moves so then you can also say
446.08s: well what happens if it actually falls
448.08s: further in the money what would that
449.60s: look like so let's say XLF goes another
452.92s: dollar up so instead of being at 39 now
456.28s: it's at 40 well what you can do is you
458.40s: can look at the 37s because your option
462.28s: would behave close to those 37s so all
466.40s: I'm doing is by the amount that I'm
468.72s: mentally moving XLF I'm mentally
471.88s: adjusting my strike the same amount to
474.76s: see what the option would look like if
477.56s: that move happened so really use use ful
479.80s: tool again that might sound a little
481.44s: complex feel free to listen through this
483.52s: a time or two if you need but that's
485.84s: what I do to analyze a lot of potential
489.52s: options adjustments without doing the
491.72s: math for every single one of them so one
494.12s: of the best practices here is rolling
495.96s: spreads is it something you can do it is
497.84s: something you can do is it something
499.72s: that's reasonable to rely on no it's not
502.28s: and it's because when we're rolling
504.40s: options a lot of the time you'll find
506.52s: things sometimes are really deep in the
508.24s: money or deep out of the money this is a
510.36s: great example that we were looking at
512.16s: with this 33 DTE and we were looking at
515.72s: something that was slightly deeper and
517.16s: deeper in the money notice how if you go
519.00s: to this 36 call notice how wide that
522.12s: market is that's just for a single
524.08s: option so if you have a vertical you
526.40s: have to find the midpoint between this
528.68s: which there's a lot of slop on something
530.64s: pric like this and then you have to find
532.20s: the midpoint on whatever else whatever
534.28s: other option you have tied to your
536.00s: vertical or iron Condor the generality
538.48s: here is the more legs you have the
540.76s: harder this is and you're also probably
543.16s: going to have to move them piece by
545.00s: piece which opens you up to Gap risk
547.40s: while you're in the process of adjusting
548.80s: your your strikes rolling spreads is
551.32s: doable very difficult it's not something
553.96s: that I think is worthwhile in most cases
556.68s: does rolling avoid losses the cool part
559.60s: about this one is you actually already
562.36s: know the answer to it because we just
564.12s: looked at this in this example that we
566.88s: looked at over here when you rolled this
569.64s: option meaning you close this one and
571.68s: you open this new one did you avoid a
573.96s: loss no you realized a loss that means
578.24s: this is on your books this means you
580.24s: have a brand new open position that has
582.80s: the potential to cover the cost of this
585.36s: loss but it's not guaranteed you could
587.80s: also have an even bigger loss as a
589.96s: result of opening this new position so
592.64s: no rolling does not avoid losses now on
596.08s: that same topic if you rolled this
598.64s: option do you know how to calculate what
600.96s: your break even price is on this option
603.84s: if not it's pretty simple so if we
605.72s: closed this trade two bucks $100 realize
608.92s: loss you sell to open this new Option at
611.68s: $2 how much money do you need to make in
614.32s: order to get back to zero on this
616.80s: realized loss $100 so that means on this
620.56s: option you would need this trading at $1
623.88s: or less to be in profit as soon as this
627.24s: hits $1 not including fees you would be
630.52s: at break even so you can easily do that
633.52s: math to calculate what you need this new
636.28s: option to be trading at to hit break
638.16s: even and then also to then start seeing
641.28s: a profit which is the whole point of
642.64s: doing this a common error Traders make
645.12s: is when they see this option trading for
647.56s: a profit so if this we sold to open for
650.16s: $2 and then now it's trading at $125
653.08s: you're looking at a $75 profit you're
654.88s: like wow that looks great I want to take
656.28s: that well unfortunately in the net you
658.64s: would have lost money because if you
660.16s: took this down for a $75 profit and you
662.76s: have a $100 realized loss you still lost
665.00s: 25 bucks so you can calculate your
667.92s: rolled options Break Even which is
670.08s: something I definitely recommend
671.60s: tracking I have an Excel sheet that does
673.92s: that which I've thrown into the shop for
676.68s: all the patreon members if you're silver
678.36s: and above you get free access to it it's
680.24s: just a simple tool to help you track
681.72s: things so now if we continue on our best
684.48s: practices what's the best time to roll
686.68s: as you know my answer to this already is
688.48s: it depends there's two things you really
691.04s: need to answer right up front the first
693.28s: thing is what is your objective for the
695.64s: position and the second thing is what do
698.92s: you think about the underlying so let's
701.20s: say you have a position on the best time
703.96s: to roll in terms of getting the highest
708.36s: variability in your strike price is when
711.80s: you are at the money or slightly in the
713.92s: money the reason being is even though
716.44s: there's a bunch of extrinsic value left
718.44s: in that option you'll notice you're not
721.28s: moving a bunch of intrinsic value which
724.12s: decreases how effectively you can roll
726.56s: so what this looks like is let's say you
728.48s: were short this 39 put that's now it's
731.32s: in the money right now and it's trading
733.08s: for like 35 36 Cents something like that
736.20s: if we try to roll this and we want to go
738.88s: out one week and we want to collect a
741.08s: credit meaning the rolled trade is
743.72s: bringing in more money than what we're
745.40s: closing if we take a look at that and we
747.80s: know that we need 35 can you get it
750.84s: going further out of the money going out
752.52s: just one week no so we might have to go
754.48s: out let's just pick the next primary
756.60s: expiration you can find you can roll out
759.32s: in time for a credit at the same strike
762.32s: or you can roll out in time and slightly
765.60s: out of the money taking it all the way
767.32s: down to a 28 Delta while collecting a
770.04s: very small credit so when the option
773.12s: price is the same as the strike is when
775.28s: you're going to have the most choices
776.72s: available to you however it's also when
778.76s: you're Buy buying back the most
780.84s: extrinsic value so if this is something
783.08s: that you don't mind taking assignment on
786.04s: or don't mind managing in the long run
788.44s: then you can wait a little bit wait for
790.72s: some more of this extrinsic value to
792.32s: bleed out and then you can adjust if
794.40s: this is something that's like leveraged
796.40s: options or you really don't want to take
798.32s: assignment in this case on the short put
800.56s: and you don't want to get stuck what I
803.60s: mean by getting stuck is if you wait
805.44s: until you're too far in the money you
807.12s: get to a point where you actually can't
809.16s: adjust down you can't roll down anymore
811.80s: or if you're on the short calls you
812.92s: can't roll up anymore cuz you're too
814.72s: deep in the money and then you run into
816.60s: another problem which is days to
819.64s: expiration liquidity so for example
822.64s: let's say our option fell in the money
824.52s: the 39s we want to roll out and down
826.80s: cool so we go out and down we have to go
828.68s: to 40 days to be able to roll down now
831.44s: we get our small credit you're a dollar
833.48s: better but let's say time passes and XLF
836.64s: Falls more 4 days pass XL Falls more now
839.92s: your 38s are in the money okay you're
841.96s: like crap I got to roll out again well I
843.96s: can't roll out just one week and get a
846.16s: credit it's not enough so maybe if I
848.56s: roll out two weeks well do you notice
850.92s: what just happened right here you had 40
854.64s: days to expiration then you were able to
856.72s: look out to 47 now all of a sudden it's
859.20s: 53 then after 53 it's 75 What's
862.48s: Happening Here is options chains offer
865.88s: more expirations the closer to time you
869.32s: are some options chains will offer you a
872.40s: bunch of choices if you look at
874.60s: something like spy anything within 53
877.32s: days you have a ton of choices but even
879.80s: then after 53 days it gets more and more
883.44s: sparse that's days to expiration
885.68s: liquidity and that's why it's a problem
887.72s: because if you roll immediately every
889.84s: time your strike is challenged let's say
891.60s: you're in this 33 days expiration you
893.36s: roll when your strike is challenged then
894.80s: you go to the 40 then you go to the 47
896.48s: then you go to the 53 then you go to the
897.76s: 75 now you're out out pretty damn far in
899.96s: time data is not ticking away that fast
902.28s: because you're so far out in time and
903.72s: then if you get a continued down move
905.44s: then where do you go you got to 103 days
908.08s: what if the down move continues then you
910.20s: run out of Runway and if the underly
913.00s: continues to move against you you build
915.68s: a really difficult position to move
918.00s: around so when I think about the best
919.92s: time to roll I balance how do I feel
922.80s: about taking the underlying in or out
924.76s: whether I'm short puts or short calls
926.40s: for long or short stock and then I think
928.60s: about what is my disposition towards the
930.60s: underlying because sometimes the best
933.00s: time to roll is never and to take the
935.32s: loss if you're trading something like
937.48s: this let's say you had cash secured puts
939.60s: out on carvana and you were all the way
942.08s: out here you were trading it a while ago
944.24s: when it was 300 bucks and then you're
946.76s: trying to roll your options you're
947.92s: trying to roll your options if you got
949.68s: stuck you're stuck you are there's no
952.08s: rolling your options from here to here
954.96s: sometimes if you get enough price
956.28s: accommodation in the short term you
957.64s: might be able to get Buy with some of it
960.04s: but big moves that happen quickly can
962.48s: leave you stranded so you have to
964.84s: strongly analyze the underline that
967.36s: you're trading and again the same thing
969.40s: can happen to the inverse if you're one
971.40s: of those real smart contrarian Traders
973.28s: and you know better when the Market's
974.60s: pricing things and you see this big
976.16s: green candle you're like wow I'm going
977.48s: to fade this and smci hasn't come back
981.16s: it's gone from $400 to$ 579 so in this
984.56s: case you get stuck you need some sort of
987.84s: price accommodation in order to be able
990.32s: to roll and eventually find your way out
992.16s: of the money because the problem is can
994.56s: you roll forever no because if you go
997.44s: back to this original example you are
1000.20s: realizing losses if we're rolling a
1003.24s: losing trade so when you're rolling a
1004.88s: losing trade each time you are eroding
1008.36s: your account value sooner or later the
1011.32s: margin requirement for your trade is
1013.92s: bigger than your account value so even
1016.68s: though you might have a bunch of cash
1018.52s: sitting in your cash and sweep if your
1020.56s: net lick net liquidating value isn't
1022.84s: high enough to cover your margined
1024.72s: requirements for your trade you cannot
1026.72s: put it on so you cannot roll forever
1029.52s: because you eventually do need price
1033.04s: accommodation so the last thing how do
1035.76s: we think about rolling in or out up or
1039.08s: down I tend to try to roll out is little
1043.12s: in time as possible it allows me to
1046.08s: maintain the most spot price sensitiv
1049.52s: it also gives me more runway on that
1053.60s: days to expiration liquidity concept
1055.96s: that I was explaining to you so if I can
1057.96s: roll from this 12 to the 19 while
1060.72s: adjusting my strike I typically would do
1062.72s: that if I can roll from the 12 to the 19
1065.16s: and not adjust my strike meaning if I
1067.40s: have cash secured puts for example and I
1070.08s: can't roll them here but I can roll them
1071.56s: in the 26 DTE I need to analyze the
1074.40s: underlying do I want to add two weeks
1077.20s: and depending on how much I'm improving
1079.04s: my basis does that make sense so overall
1082.32s: the decision on whether or not you go
1084.48s: further out in time comes down to how do
1086.64s: you feel about the underlying and
1087.92s: running out of DTE liquidity and then
1090.48s: rolling down or up depends on how much
1093.20s: money you want to make because if I try
1095.56s: to roll for example from the 12 to the
1098.68s: 19 DTE if we look at this scenario and
1103.16s: let's say I'm at the 575 so I keep the
1105.60s: same strike in this case you have what
1109.76s: 2675 and this is just call it 35 in that
1113.48s: scenario you can still make an okay
1115.88s: amount of money by staying at the same
1117.28s: strike if you chose to go from the 575s
1120.08s: down to the 570s notice what happens
1122.44s: instead of getting $35 whatever this is
1124.64s: you're going to get 32 in change so you
1127.12s: have to decide what's more important to
1129.40s: you is it improving your basis adjusting
1131.60s: your basis or is it collecting more
1132.96s: money up front that is 100% dependent on
1136.00s: the trader so this is part one as you
1138.20s: can tell it's a big video there's a lot
1140.04s: that goes into this if you have any
1141.44s: questions let me know if we should do a
1143.00s: part two and go even deeper with
1145.32s: specific examples let me know cuz we
1147.28s: might be able to swing that till next
1149.04s: time like subscribe share be an outlier
1151.36s: see you guys later
