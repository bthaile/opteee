0.72s: what's up everyone looking out at the
3.36s: week ahead providing a quick update on
6.08s: what to expect this week from the
7.36s: markets and then also setting the table
10.64s: for what is an expiration cycle for
14.20s: GameStop so I want to take a little bit
16.60s: of look at the options there so that we
18.28s: can see what looks like might be
20.36s: happening and then I've had a lot of
22.20s: people ask me to take a look at other
23.80s: tickers so I have no problem looking at
26.92s: pretty much anything that you guys want
28.12s: me to send them in but if the kind of
32.36s: ask is this looks weird this looks weird
34.76s: this looks
35.76s: weird like I I need some sort of
37.96s: filtering mechanism right so all I'm
39.52s: saying is that I'm not going to look at
41.36s: every single stock that people send in
43.64s: saying that they're looking weird I
44.80s: don't want people to think that I'm
45.80s: ignoring you I typically will try to at
48.16s: least respond but I not everything is
51.60s: weird is what it boils down to so send
54.68s: them in whatever you want me to look at
56.56s: and I'm happy to screen it but it
59.36s: doesn't mean that going to do like a
60.84s: dedicated video on it but maybe on some
62.96s: of these more broad Style videos I can
65.48s: integrate looking at some other tickers
67.20s: as well I'm happy to do that so first
70.32s: thing I want to talk about though is
71.60s: this right here and a lot of people were
75.20s: asking my opinion of this tweet not so
77.84s: much his support of trump or his support
81.44s: of anybody but more so the impact that
84.56s: this could have on GameStop and I
87.32s: actually think it's a really interesting
88.52s: lens to look at this through it's one of
89.72s: my favorite things about Finance is it
92.24s: tends to shed this just polarizing
96.80s: landscape that we're in where it's super
99.20s: far left super far right and like most
102.80s: of us are human beings most of us enjoy
107.16s: loving family and friends we enjoy
110.12s: things that make us happy but we somehow
112.56s: find a way to really villainize one
115.68s: another in this landscape which is
117.00s: pretty intense so the cool part about
120.32s: finances we look at it as as the
122.68s: questions that I got related to this how
124.40s: does this impact a stock which is an
126.44s: interesting perspective and the answer
129.28s: that I gave to that is pretty succinct
132.20s: it's whether or not there's a knee-jerk
135.36s: reaction to something like this I do not
139.20s: expect that kind of post from him to do
143.80s: anything long-term to the stock because
146.04s: the performance of the stock is going to
147.92s: be predicated on the performance of the
150.96s: company that's pretty much it so there
154.64s: might be some people who are like really
156.32s: really upset about it or really really
158.12s: stoked about it it's less so about
160.00s: either of those things the way I look at
162.20s: it is as far as I know a lot of the Apes
165.00s: have been through hell over the past
166.84s: three years so if this is the thing that
169.24s: shakes them out after going through the
172.04s: rest of the price action for the last
173.68s: three years I will be shocked and the
176.52s: other thing it looks like in general
178.00s: most people are being pretty respectful
180.00s: of one another I I noticed that in the
181.52s: comments here right exactly ape no fight
184.48s: ape Apes together like I love that right
186.32s: we're focusing on the unification
187.64s: component this is this dude's opinion
189.56s: everybody can have an opinion and that's
191.36s: okay you don't have to like it or you
192.80s: can like it either or is okay in my
195.84s: worldview at least the important part
198.88s: here is deciphering the potential impact
201.56s: to the underlying itself and in that
204.60s: case like I said could there be some
206.88s: sort of short-term move could be there's
208.92s: a lot of things that watch the stock and
211.60s: there could be some sort of knee-jerk
212.96s: reaction but I don't think in any way
215.68s: that kind of statement or that kind of
217.96s: post would lead any sort of meaningful
221.64s: change in the perspective of the company
224.56s: which is they're sitting on piles of
227.40s: cash they are coming up on being
229.96s: profitable real real soon so yeah you
234.36s: can make with it whatever you want the
236.56s: main thing I would say is don't let
238.28s: stuff like this divide anybody right I
241.44s: think it's good to share ideas share
242.96s: perspectives that's okay being
244.32s: respectful is super important it's
247.08s: healthy desent is normal but this is I
250.08s: think just kind of nothing to be
252.76s: inflamed about either way I would say
255.12s: especially from the GameStop perspective
257.00s: focus on the performance of the company
258.76s: which so far is moving Leaps and Bounds
261.60s: in the correct direction from a company
263.56s: that was essentially being seller boxed
266.44s: down into the dirt this guy came in
269.04s: started turning things things around and
271.00s: through a series of pretty smart I would
274.24s: say strategic moves he's repositioning
276.84s: the company so that to me is a much more
280.00s: telling story than people's perception
282.20s: of this tweet okay moving over to Broad
287.24s: market news I want to show you guys
290.24s: what's coming up this week just so that
292.04s: you're aware of what's coming down the
293.80s: pike like I said I think it's really
295.68s: good to look at GameStop and I'm going
298.08s: to but I also want you guys to see other
303.52s: things and to just understand a little
306.28s: bit of the broader perspective even if
308.24s: you have no interest in it that's
309.56s: completely okay I think just being aware
311.56s: of it is useful so we'll run through
313.24s: this really fast this is a much more
315.52s: quiet week as compared to last week last
318.12s: week we had a lot of really big
319.28s: inflation indicators come out CPI PPI or
322.88s: pce we also had um Powell speaking those
327.84s: kinds of things are generally big deal
330.44s: now this coming week we do have some
333.16s: more economic data coming out so Powell
336.20s: is speaking on the 15th tomorrow we have
339.12s: retail sales on the 16th which is kind
341.32s: of a big deal there's a handful of other
343.88s: fed speakers you know uh whatever they
346.36s: can talk to their heart's content but
348.48s: it's really pow that we care quite a lot
350.40s: about the Philadelphia fed manufacturing
353.36s: survey is coming out this is just all of
355.60s: these are being interpreted in the
358.00s: perspective of how healthy is the
359.64s: economy how's the how is inflation
362.28s: impacting things and when does this
364.80s: potentially lead to a Fed pivot which as
367.40s: of the latest data it looks like the FED
370.64s: pivot is early as September now which
373.64s: was kicked out a long time ago it used
376.32s: to be as early as March of this year
378.72s: then it got moved out towards the end of
379.96s: the year now it's sliding back in so
383.04s: just something to be aware of because if
384.96s: we take a look at kind of the broader
386.84s: Market here you'll see the way that the
390.44s: market thinks about some of these
391.92s: different events and it's kind of not
394.60s: they the market doesn't care that much
396.52s: we don't see any sort of significant
398.60s: expansion and volatility we see ever so
401.00s: slightly elevated 11 and a half 12% and
404.52s: the next expirations like 10 to 11 it
407.20s: it's just not being ingested as any sort
410.88s: of high impact week okay Game Stop first
415.04s: things first we already talked about
416.40s: this that's a lot of charts let's go to
418.44s: this one and and here what I'm seeing is
422.24s: this floor continuing to kind of be
425.04s: baked in and it's slowly trending up
428.52s: that's interesting to keep an eye on and
430.40s: this also does correspond with some of
433.12s: the cycle thesis that I've seen thrown
435.72s: around and I also think that this aligns
439.00s: fairly neatly with Newton's expectations
441.40s: coming into August so there's some
443.36s: interesting activity there when I look
446.12s: at the overall picture of volume volume
449.48s: volume is contracted a lot we saw a
451.72s: little bit of a spike here on the 10th
453.64s: came back down and it's been very very
455.96s: quiet but notice the trend it was
459.00s: trending down in terms of average volume
461.88s: then expanded and then it's been slowly
463.88s: expanding out from the 11th so that's
467.80s: also fairly interesting to see looking
470.88s: over at the options change themselves
472.40s: what do we notice the first thing the
475.40s: front expiration is a standard Opex
478.84s: which is really important this is going
480.40s: to be way more impactful and busy than
482.80s: the weeklys typically speaking because
484.64s: you'll find liquidity in here we notice
487.68s: that the V is elevated 164 versus 136
492.16s: 126 118 124 so they definitely is a
497.00s: little bit of an expectation of movement
498.76s: coming up this has been slowly expanding
500.60s: which we've been following for a little
501.96s: while now and the important part here is
506.44s: if we take a look at where we have most
510.24s: of the oi as it sits now you'll see
513.36s: there's 762 th000 contracts against
515.84s: 456,000 puts when I said contracts
518.60s: before obviously I was referring to
519.84s: calls and if we look at the 19 July
522.88s: 320
524.48s: 332,000 essentially
526.72s: 333 of that is in this upcoming
529.88s: expiration 16 Aug only has 142k calls so
535.56s: most of the activity again continues to
538.20s: be in these very near term
540.44s: expirations this is really playing these
542.60s: front moves so as I look at the 19 July
546.40s: expiration specifically because this is
547.88s: the one that's coming up this position
549.88s: is interesting to me what we're seeing
551.96s: in the 30s and it's because there's
554.88s: 60,000 oi and there was
557.88s: 30,500 volume contracts traded on Friday
562.20s: you have to assume a good number of
563.72s: those are going to be net opening
565.36s: contracts so there's a bit of a position
568.00s: being built there
569.88s: and what I wanted to do is take a look
572.12s: at what kind of position building is
574.16s: going on in this upcoming expiration
577.00s: cycle in the 30s they got hit pretty
580.72s: hard with this almost looks like
584.28s: probably let me see I'm guessing about
586.36s: 5,000 yeah
587.92s: 4810 contracts and my guess is it's
590.28s: probably 5,000 I I don't my guess is
593.40s: somebody didn't stop right at 4810 or
596.12s: 240k my guess is there's probably even a
598.52s: couple more contracts that go into this
600.36s: you could just see that these all rolled
602.52s: through essentially at the same time so
605.04s: they're able to get a pretty big
606.72s: fill but anyways that's what I'm
610.40s: expecting that's a quarter million doll
613.24s: position that went on the nth for the 30
618.12s: calls expiring this coming
621.32s: Friday that's an interesting trade to me
624.24s: this is not anywhere near roaring Kitty
627.04s: size I want to be very very clear
628.60s: everybody kind of starts jumping down
630.52s: that path and I get why it's fun to
632.24s: speculate
633.72s: that this doesn't look like his size but
636.76s: this also is not a small trade that is
640.52s: again it's you can kind of get kind of
642.48s: numb in this space after you watch
644.80s: ruring Kitty slinging hundreds of
647.52s: millions of dollars at stuff but a
650.44s: quarter million doll position in options
652.92s: that expire in 10 days from when you
655.24s: place them is not
657.88s: insignificant so one of the things I am
660.48s: watching like a hawk this upcoming week
664.92s: is the options activity I want to know
669.40s: if this is just a tester position that's
671.72s: being built out and using the rest of
674.52s: this week to start scaling into it that
678.44s: would be interesting the other thing
680.72s: that I'm very interested in is based on
683.24s: Newton's um kind of I guess timeline I
687.40s: should say his timeline analysis of
689.40s: GameStop he's very interested in August
692.44s: so when I see somebody like roring
695.48s: Kitty's previous transactions they were
697.88s: about a month out is and when he entered
701.36s: versus when there was a move so if
704.56s: Newton is expecting a move in August my
706.96s: guess is we would start to see if what
710.44s: roaring Kitty is looking at is anything
712.84s: similar to what he and I have been
714.40s: discussing for a while now on the live
716.12s: streams which there's another one coming
718.00s: up this coming Saturday at 5:00 p.m.
720.64s: Pacific time we're going to kind of keep
722.28s: a Cadence on these at least for the near
724.72s: term because we're both really enjoying
727.00s: looking at this we spent over two hours
729.28s: on this last Saturday on the live stream
731.72s: and then literally he and I hung out for
733.08s: another hour talking about this stuff
735.08s: because we're both so interested in it
738.24s: going back to this though if there's a
740.84s: chance that RK is looking at some or
744.80s: even peripheral things tied to what
746.60s: we're looking at we should start seeing
748.88s: some activity so I'm looking for it and
752.56s: we will see if it comes out there's also
755.20s: a chance that it's not at the same scale
756.80s: before it's not like he has to put on
758.24s: a68 million options position every time
761.00s: he touches options right so it's not
763.28s: being overly rigid in the analysis in
766.32s: that sense this starts to look
768.40s: interesting
770.64s: $234,000 but this seems a little short
772.96s: term we will see I am looking
775.44s: specifically for the building out of
777.32s: positions right now it looks like
779.28s: there's a little bit of a start but not
783.08s: fully rounded out so we have to keep an
784.56s: eyeball on it the last thing I want to
786.48s: highlight for you guys is down here at
788.52s: the bottom and I want to show you the V
791.48s: smile and how this looks kind of for the
794.32s: near
795.64s: term and here's what I am seeing I want
799.08s: to use specifically kind of these
800.52s: near-term
801.72s: expirations what I'm seeing is the
804.64s: standard standard Behavior where in
807.48s: these Opex Cycles the 25 super far out
810.20s: of the money are creeping up in V the
814.16s: near term I'm still seeing call V lower
818.20s: than putall which when we were seeing
820.12s: that really aggressive upward price
821.92s: movement it was inverted which is very
824.12s: telling typically you'll see it like
825.92s: this if I look out here into the 16 Aug
831.40s: notice this if I hover at the top of
834.12s: where this put ball is if you go all the
836.56s: way to the right just over my shoulder
838.20s: on this side notice how that line is
840.40s: actually above my cursor right if I move
842.92s: this you'll see it it's just above my
844.20s: cursor so right now the call side out in
847.72s: 16 Aug is slightly elevated compared to
851.60s: the out of- the- money puts so again
853.48s: from a vault Trader perspective this has
856.36s: been habitual where these far outof the
858.40s: money puts have been gaining involv
860.80s: pretty heavily it's a tradeable event
864.08s: but in terms of a price projection
866.52s: standpoint using options to have an
868.04s: assessment of where we think where we
869.76s: think things might be going based on how
871.36s: Market is pricing stuff right now it is
874.36s: still favoring the downside in terms of
877.08s: VA for this coming cycle so we will also
880.64s: keep an eye on this as always any
882.36s: questions anything you want me to take a
883.76s: look at or anything to add please throw
886.04s: it out there I'm learning as much as you
887.36s: guys are and I love gaining more
890.60s: situational awareness about this whole
892.44s: thing so have an awesome week being an
894.56s: outlier I'll see you guys later
