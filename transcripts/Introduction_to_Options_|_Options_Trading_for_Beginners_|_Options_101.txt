0.44s: introduction to options this is for new
3.72s: people interested in learning about
5.34s: options how they can fit into your
6.96s: broader investing objectives and my goal
9.48s: here is to find a sweet spot I want to
11.22s: offer you what I consider to be
12.48s: important information with details
14.52s: without going overboard and overwhelming
16.68s: you options can seem incredibly
19.20s: overwhelming up front and it's just
21.24s: because it's a pretty steep learning
22.62s: curve but I will assure you if I've been
26.04s: able to figure this out literally
27.78s: anybody else can it just takes a little
29.64s: bit of time there's a big language
31.26s: barrier little things like that but
33.12s: they're great products and they can help
35.70s: a lot of people in different scenarios
37.26s: again based on what your investing
38.76s: objectives are so my goal here is to
40.80s: work through what options are how we can
42.66s: think about them some of their primary
44.34s: traits and then how you can Implement
47.10s: them in your broader investing
48.42s: objectives so what's up everybody Eric
50.40s: here welcome back to all the outliers
51.90s: let's talk about options so in short
55.26s: options are derivatives and there's lots
58.02s: of different derivatives out there but
59.52s: retail Traders very commonly will come
61.62s: into contact with two options and
64.02s: Futures in this scenario we are focusing
67.80s: on options as compared to Futures and
71.28s: Futures we can get into in a future time
73.50s: haha get the pun but really it's just
76.02s: options are a little more accessible to
77.94s: people a little bit smaller of a product
79.44s: and there's some rules that tie to
81.78s: options that make them kind of
83.04s: advantageous for a lot of scenarios
84.60s: specifically beginner strategies so what
88.08s: is a derivative in short a derivative is
90.90s: a product whose value is derived from
94.68s: something else that's it so in this
97.56s: scenario we're just talking about
98.88s: products whose value is derived from
100.98s: something else I'm going to use the D to
102.90s: a house as an analogy in just a minute
105.06s: but just think of it that way that you
107.46s: have an options contract and it's tied
109.80s: to an underlying security this is any
112.50s: stock you can think of Apple Amazon
114.24s: Facebook or meta now
116.94s: um things like that so what is an
120.30s: options contract why do we care about
121.98s: them well we call them strategic
124.14s: Investments actually interestingly
125.82s: enough my favorite author is Lawrence
128.64s: McMillan on options products and he has
131.52s: a book called options as a Strategic
133.14s: investment it's my go-to and it's
135.00s: because there are different aspects of a
137.76s: risk profile that we can manage with
140.22s: options contracts as compared to
142.08s: equities when we trade equities if you
144.66s: buy them you want it to go up if you
147.12s: sell in equity to sell short you want it
149.88s: to go down so that you can cover lower
151.82s: options give you a lot more control over
154.50s: that and let's take a look at some of
156.24s: the things they allow you to do they
158.10s: allow you to hedge positions this means
160.08s: you can reduce risk in individual
161.76s: positions or reduce risk in an entire
164.16s: portfolio you can gain access to
167.04s: leverage so this means that you put up a
169.86s: smaller amount of money to control a
171.96s: larger amount of money so let's say you
173.82s: put up a dollar but you get to control
175.44s: five dollars that's leverage and it's
178.26s: good and it's bad what do I mean by that
180.30s: well if things go in your favor it's a
183.30s: good thing because it means that you are
185.10s: using a little amount of money that's
186.60s: behaving like a bigger amount of money
188.16s: so you can make more money but if things
191.52s: don't go in your favor well different
193.62s: story things hurt more because it's
196.20s: moving against you more so leverage
198.90s: giveth and leverage taketh but it is an
201.90s: important trait of options that's why a
203.34s: lot of people use them because once you
204.66s: understand what you're doing it's a more
206.40s: efficient way to trade a lot of things
208.86s: then we have the entire world of
212.10s: volatility trading and I'm not going to
214.26s: go super far into detail here but just
217.02s: know that there are entire strategies
219.78s: that are predicated on trading not just
223.08s: the directional movement of things but
226.02s: the volatility of those things so the
228.48s: beauty in that scenario is you can come
230.40s: up with non-directional returns so you
234.06s: can make money if something doesn't
235.80s: really go in your favor but doesn't go
237.48s: against you too far or if something
238.98s: doesn't move a whole lot there are
240.96s: strategies built around
243.44s: non-directional returns and volatility
246.30s: trading is a big one and you'll find
248.04s: that in derivatives
249.66s: you can trade them for income which is
251.52s: actually kind of an important part here
253.38s: that a lot of people don't realize if
255.48s: you're trading an equities product so
257.82s: let's say you buy a hundred shares of a
259.56s: stock and it goes up
262.74s: unrealized
267.30s: rely returns that's still in the account
268.86s: and the position is still open so you
271.02s: can lose all of it but with options you
274.02s: can create income on a principal balance
276.42s: without drawing down or neutralizing the
278.88s: overall principal trade which is a
280.86s: really useful component of options
283.08s: and then you also can trade all market
285.54s: conditions so if markets are going up if
287.46s: they're going down if they're going
288.48s: sideways you can trade options there in
291.00s: equities you need to trade either long
293.76s: right so things go up or trade short
295.56s: things go down if it's going in your
297.48s: favor but there's not really much you
298.92s: can do if things go sideways most
300.72s: Traders get chopped up in those
302.52s: scenarios because it's very difficult to
303.96s: make enough money in order to make
306.30s: profitable trades in sideways markets
308.46s: but not so much with options
310.44s: so back to that analogy I was referring
312.72s: to before the deed of a house so in this
316.20s: case we have a seller who has a sick top
318.24s: hat and it came
319.56s: and then we have a buyer over here in
321.48s: Gree and the house in this scenario
324.42s: represents the underlying asset that is
327.24s: the thing that actually holds value and
330.24s: the deed to a house is kind of like an
333.48s: options contract and as you'll notice I
336.60s: use the term contract because an option
339.36s: is a contract between two people it
342.78s: means for every option contract that's
345.54s: opened there is a human being on the
348.06s: other side of that trade it's an
350.52s: important note that we'll get into later
352.02s: but that's important for you to
354.06s: understand early on now if you you think
357.24s: about the deed to a house it inherently
359.16s: doesn't have really any value it's just
361.44s: a piece of paper but the deed is an
364.14s: important document that ties to an
367.02s: underlying asset which does have value
369.18s: so in this scenario if we substitute
372.42s: deed with an options contract and then
374.94s: the asset instead of a house we have a
377.22s: stock again like apple Amazon meta we
380.58s: have individual ETFs so like spy or iwm
385.44s: you are trading a contract that is tied
389.52s: to that asset that's the only difference
392.04s: slightly different terms than a
394.08s: traditional deed which will get into the
395.76s: terms of the contract but that's it so
397.86s: far now I want to take a quick pause and
401.04s: make sure that everybody's not already
402.60s: super overwhelmed because no matter what
405.12s: if you're new to options this is going
407.22s: to be heavy there's going to be a lot of
409.14s: language that comes up that you're
410.58s: unfamiliar with and that's all okay my
413.52s: biggest recommendation would be to take
415.56s: the video in bits take notes along the
418.98s: way to try to Define for yourself the
421.32s: terms that you don't know and then
423.48s: re-watch the video as you develop your
426.66s: understanding but don't be discouraged
429.48s: if you watch this video through one time
431.52s: and you don't know what options are
433.56s: still they are complex products but
435.78s: they're entirely approachable over time
438.48s: so my method of teaching stuff like this
440.82s: is to give you the vernacular give you
442.74s: the definition of the vernacular and
444.72s: then I'm just going to move move on
446.04s: because you can re-watch that section as
448.20s: many times as you need but I believe
450.24s: getting the terms and the context in
453.90s: your face as much as I can it's going to
456.12s: increase your uptake it's just like if
457.44s: you're trying to learn a language the
458.82s: best possible way you can learn a
459.96s: language is just go to the country that
462.42s: speaks the language you're trying to
463.50s: learn you won't understand anything up
464.88s: front but over time via context you pick
467.40s: it up same thing here so let's get into
469.50s: it
470.34s: I want to talk now about what actually
473.22s: is in the contract so like I said it's a
476.64s: contract between two people and there
479.04s: are a handful of things that we Define
481.14s: in an options contract now a quick admin
484.44s: note for those interested
486.54s: options now are all electronic so
489.54s: there's not like a piece of paper that's
491.46s: sent to you or anybody it's all done
493.92s: between you and your broker and they
496.74s: just show up as little line items in
498.78s: your account so there's not like an
500.34s: email that you get with the contract
502.38s: it's literally just like if you buy
504.36s: shares of a stock and how it pops up in
506.46s: your platform same thing is going to
507.96s: happen with an options contract
510.24s: so what's in the contract well we have
512.88s: the ticker this represents the security
515.16s: or the underlying you're going to hear
517.92s: me refer and flow between all three of
520.08s: those because they're synonymous in the
521.70s: trading World underlying security ticker
523.56s: we have the type of option which we're
526.56s: going to get into next but there's only
528.00s: two types calls and puts calls and puts
530.94s: only two types of options
532.68s: the expiration every options contract
537.00s: has in expiration they're not good
540.30s: forever so that is one of the Strategic
543.36s: components of an options contract is
545.82s: that they are time bound then we have a
548.88s: strike price think of the strike price
551.10s: kind of like the sale price on a house
553.50s: it's what you agree to the market price
556.50s: for the house may fluctuate but you are
559.38s: agreeing to a specific amount up front
561.42s: that's the strike price now this is
564.54s: where things slightly start to
565.92s: differentiate from the analogy of a deed
567.84s: to a house because unlike a deed to a
570.78s: house you can actually buy and sell in
574.14s: options contract itself so you can have
577.56s: this options contract and this
580.38s: inherently has value because it gives
583.02s: people the right to an asset which also
585.96s: has value so the options contract itself
589.52s: has value because it's slaved to the
595.08s: underlying asset and it's kind of like
597.12s: if you're wholesaling houses or locating
599.46s: deals for people that's common in the
601.80s: real estate world for those that don't
603.12s: know so essentially it's kind of the
605.10s: same thing if you find a deal to a house
607.62s: you gain access to the deed by saying
610.20s: okay we're gonna make a deal here you
612.60s: can sell that deal to somebody else
615.42s: because it's valuable there's a willing
617.52s: seller and you're connecting the two
618.96s: it's kind of like the same thing with
620.22s: options contract
622.14s: then we have the premium the premium is
624.90s: the value of the options contract which
627.42s: we're going to go into later on how we
629.22s: calculate that what that means all those
630.96s: sorts of things no sweat but just know
633.60s: that premium is essentially how much the
636.42s: options contract itself is worth
639.00s: now there are a couple important traits
641.64s: when we're talking about in options
643.50s: contract like I said there's two parties
646.26s: there's always going to be a buyer and
648.90s: always going to be a seller so this
651.42s: means every single time an options
653.04s: contract is opened somebody has bought
655.32s: the position and somebody has
657.36s: correspondingly sold that same position
660.14s: now for just general understanding it's
663.60s: not always retail Trader to retail
665.82s: Trader more often than not there are
667.86s: entities called market makers they take
670.62s: the other side of your trade I'm not
672.54s: going to go all the way down into detail
674.10s: but just know that it's still a human
676.02s: being on the other side of that trade
678.78s: so whenever we have an options contract
682.02s: there are those two sides the buyer has
685.80s: right
687.06s: the seller has an obligation to deliver
690.06s: something and I'll get into those just a
692.46s: second but just know that whenever you
694.14s: hear an option buyer they have a right
696.42s: to something and then an option seller
698.46s: has an obligation to do something and
700.14s: it's again very similar to the real
703.02s: estate example the buyer of the house
705.66s: has the right to the asset and then the
708.72s: seller has the obligation to sell the
711.36s: asset now the only difference is with
713.28s: options you can buy or sell calls and
718.32s: puts and I'll go into in a second what
720.90s: the differences are between those two
722.22s: different kinds of contracts but that's
724.32s: the just so far now down here I have
727.56s: just an excerpt on what an actual
729.78s: options contract looks like so don't
732.60s: worry about the spread on the side this
735.60s: is essentially if you were buying or
737.40s: selling so in this example we are
739.20s: selling this right here is the quantity
741.78s: so this represents a single contract
744.12s: which we'll get into that in just a
745.38s: minute what it looks like I just want to
746.70s: give you an idea of what these things
748.74s: even appear as and then we'll fill in
751.08s: the blanks on what they are as we go but
752.58s: this is a single contract or a one lot
754.86s: as we'll refer to it the symbol is the
759.06s: ticker that the contract is tied to so
762.00s: in this case it's the Spy the expiration
764.88s: is exactly what it sounds like it is the
767.52s: expiration date of that option which is
770.04s: this piece right here
771.60s: then we have the strike price so in this
773.76s: case it's the 399 so this is tied to the
776.94s: 399 strike and that's that part we have
779.88s: what kind of option it is so in this
782.16s: case it is a put so that's the type of
784.56s: option and then this is the price this
786.96s: is the premium eight dollars and 21
788.70s: cents that's the value of this contract
790.74s: cool so at
794.16s: the pause and then jot down your notes
796.56s: what did you pick up from this section
798.06s: and then we're going to move directly
799.92s: into the next which is calls and puts so
803.46s: this here is what an actual options
806.40s: chain looks like and for a live view
810.60s: you can see one here and this all looks
813.42s: completely foreign to you as it should
815.46s: do not worry about it just know over
818.16s: here we have calls and then over here we
820.32s: have puts that's it but this is what it
822.42s: looks like there's all these different
824.22s: dates these are your different
825.96s: expiration cycles and then if you open
828.06s: up one of them we have all of these
830.04s: different strike prices so 363 6 364 365
834.18s: so on and so forth and that's it and
836.40s: you'll notice that there are puts tied
838.50s: to that strike price and calls tied to
840.60s: that strike price because you can trade
842.04s: either kind of contract
843.90s: so going back over now to kind of some
847.02s: more details I want to talk to you about
848.82s: calls inputs specifically because this
851.52s: is probably one of the more important
853.14s: Concepts to understand when we're
855.00s: talking about options
856.80s: so another thing I'm going to throw at
859.38s: you right away is New vernacular so if
862.20s: you'll recall a second ago when I said
864.30s: that you can buy or sell to open
867.60s: another way we frame that or just a
870.72s: synonym is long or short so long is
874.32s: synonymous with buying in short is
877.74s: synonymous with selling in this context
880.82s: so if you buy a call you can also be
884.52s: long a call if you short a call that
887.88s: means you sold a call that's all
890.46s: so if you buy remember whenever you buy
893.88s: something you have a right it means you
897.06s: have a choice so in this case if you're
900.36s: long a call or if you bought a call it
903.06s: means you have the right to buy an
906.12s: underlying asset at the strike price
909.48s: so for example
911.46s: let's say if you buy this 395 call in
916.08s: spy
917.04s: it means that you now have just bought
919.74s: the right to buy spy at 395 regardless
925.62s: of where it's trading and that's the
928.08s: important part of these and it's also
929.88s: why options contracts have inherent
931.86s: value to them because they give you
933.84s: access to buy or sell things at specific
936.30s: prices when prices move so to bring this
940.14s: example to full full swing to give you
942.90s: an idea
943.98s: if for example you had bought the 380
947.82s: call it means that you have the right to
951.42s: buy spy at 380 even though it's already
955.80s: trading at 396. so it means that you're
959.22s: buying it 16 cheaper than where it is
962.70s: now that's why there's a premium
965.24s: associated with each option because
967.98s: otherwise it would be Arbitrage right
969.54s: who wouldn't buy a 380 call and then
973.02s: exercise your option meaning
975.20s: utilize your right to buy it at the
978.42s: strike price if it's at 380 and then
980.28s: just sell it at 396. so we'll get into
982.50s: more in the detail on how they actually
983.88s: work but in short that's how something
986.22s: like a long call will make money is if
989.16s: you buy if you buy a call and then the
992.46s: underlying appreciates and value it's a
994.44s: good thing so that leads us actually to
997.26s: this part over here which we'll get into
998.88s: in just a second but I want to go
1000.32s: through what happens if you short a call
1002.12s: or if you sell a call
1003.80s: if you sell a call it means you have the
1006.14s: obligation to sell something in this
1009.02s: case it would be that underlying asset
1011.06s: at that strike price so notice how the
1013.82s: the buyer of the call has the right to
1018.20s: buy shares at the strike price
1021.04s: inversely there's a seller to that call
1023.54s: they just have to deliver on that
1025.64s: obligation so that's that's the
1027.68s: difference between buying and selling
1029.00s: from a contractual standpoint here
1031.52s: now from a put side if we think about
1034.82s: calls this is what people are used to
1036.80s: seeing people think I want to buy shares
1039.56s: low and sell them high that's like a
1041.54s: typical stock transaction so long calls
1044.42s: typically resonate with people a little
1046.04s: bit more
1047.00s: the thing with long puts or buying a put
1049.94s: it's kind of like if you're shorting
1051.74s: stock
1052.76s: it means you have the right to sell
1055.04s: something and that might sound a little
1058.34s: confusing because what are you selling
1061.64s: what if you don't have it and we'll get
1064.10s: into some of those details in just a
1065.96s: minute
1066.86s: just know that four puts if you buy a
1070.52s: put you were buying the right to sell
1072.86s: somebody something and why does that
1075.08s: matter well it's kind of the inverse
1077.06s: scenario here let's say that you bought
1082.10s: a put when spy was trading up here at
1085.16s: 412. well
1087.98s: spy is crashed in price so let's say
1091.88s: that you bought a 412 put in spy it
1096.08s: means you have the right to sell spy at
1099.34s: 412. even though right now it's trading
1102.32s: at 396. so somebody would have to buy it
1106.82s: from you at 412. so that's why people
1110.42s: buy puts sometimes they want to
1112.28s: speculate to the downside sometimes they
1114.44s: want to hedge additional positions that
1116.36s: they have on but it is essentially like
1119.66s: shorting stock it's when we want
1121.58s: something to go down in order for us to
1123.80s: make money
1125.18s: and then just like the example from a
1127.70s: short call a short put it is the inverse
1131.54s: of a long put it means somebody has to
1134.18s: buy it's just the other side of this
1137.42s: trade
1138.38s: so now I've already broken out that you
1141.14s: can buy to establish a position or sell
1144.74s: to an established a position so in this
1147.26s: case you might be thinking why would
1148.82s: somebody short a call or short a put
1152.74s: there are different strategies
1155.00s: associated with these different
1156.68s: hypothesis and we'll get into those a
1158.60s: little bit later but just know that
1160.52s: there are reasons for people to do both
1163.34s: based on a training hypothesis
1166.04s: now I would encourage you to take a
1168.26s: pause real quick write down your
1170.18s: understanding of long calls short calls
1172.82s: long puts short puts when I was first
1175.40s: learning options I literally made this
1177.44s: same exact kind of grid and I kept it as
1180.44s: a reference because I know this sounds
1182.42s: super weird and it's okay it makes more
1185.30s: sense over time now I want to talk to
1187.52s: you about the traits of calls and puts
1189.74s: in general because this will help
1191.60s: solidify these scenarios the long and
1193.70s: short
1194.68s: calls appreciate in value when the
1199.46s: underlying security goes up
1202.10s: so
1203.36s: it's just like what that sounds like if
1207.26s: you have a long call or a short call it
1210.50s: doesn't matter this is completely
1212.06s: indifferent to your position
1214.58s: these are in general so all of the calls
1217.70s: over here will appreciate in value as
1222.74s: the underlying asset goes up
1225.56s: the inverse happens when the underlying
1228.38s: asset goes down so again to give you a
1231.98s: quick example if we come over here to
1234.26s: spy let's say we bought calls and then
1237.38s: spy goes up in price the calls all of
1240.80s: them would go up in price
1243.14s: if spy goes down all of the calls are
1247.16s: going to go down in price all of them
1248.96s: across all expirations they're all going
1251.54s: to go down in price
1252.98s: and it's the inverse for puts so as a
1257.72s: stock increases in value put values
1261.74s: decrease and as a stock decreases in
1265.40s: value puts increase in value so think of
1270.14s: it this way we have two different values
1271.94s: that we're talking about here we have
1274.22s: the underlying asset I'm referring to it
1276.98s: as a stock currently but it could be a
1279.02s: security
1280.04s: ETF etn whatever it is you're trading so
1282.62s: there's the underlying asset value and
1285.26s: then there's the option value the option
1288.38s: value is tied to the performance and the
1291.14s: behavior of the underlying that you're
1293.78s: looking at so
1296.48s: I would
1297.92s: throw two questions at you and see if
1299.96s: you can answer them throw them down in
1301.28s: the comments
1302.72s: if you short a call
1306.74s: and the underlying goes up
1310.28s: did your position make or lose money
1313.70s: that's the first one the second one
1316.76s: if you buy a put and the underlying goes
1321.68s: up
1322.94s: did your long put make or lose money
1325.64s: that's it and if you can answer those
1327.62s: two questions it means you're pretty
1328.88s: good and you understand this the thing
1330.98s: to remember is when we talk about the
1332.84s: appreciation of the options change
1335.60s: themselves or the options themselves the
1338.06s: impact to your position is just it's it
1340.88s: doesn't matter
1342.02s: that's going to be a function of whether
1343.88s: you bought or sold the product but calls
1346.82s: are always going to go up when the
1348.98s: underlying goes up
1350.60s: and then call premiums are always going
1353.24s: to go down when the underlying goes down
1355.16s: and then it's inverse four buts
1358.22s: all right let's talk about a couple
1359.36s: notes here you're going to hear American
1361.94s: versus European options when we refer to
1365.24s: those we're talking about how those
1368.18s: options can be exercised and that leads
1372.38s: me down here quickly to talk about the
1375.14s: settlement of an options contract
1378.14s: you can either exercise or the opposite
1382.04s: or I'm sorry the um the corresponding
1384.50s: part of exercise is if you bought an
1388.16s: option you have the choice to exercise
1391.10s: and if you've sold an option you have an
1394.16s: obligation to deliver on that option so
1397.16s: again in this case if you're long a call
1399.38s: and you choose to exercise it means you
1402.20s: get to buy something at a certain price
1403.82s: and whoever is short that option has to
1406.52s: sell it
1407.60s: and it's the inverse for puts if you're
1411.14s: along a put it means that you have the
1413.06s: option to sell shares of something at
1415.64s: the strike price and somebody has to buy
1418.40s: them from you at that strike price so
1421.10s: this is way less used though a lot of
1424.46s: people ask the questions of oh so in
1426.80s: order to realize the profit on my
1428.60s: options contract do I have to exercise
1430.66s: no more often than not you're just going
1434.00s: to trade the contract it because the
1436.22s: contract itself has value and more often
1439.58s: than not it's more efficient to just
1441.98s: trade the contract as compared to taking
1443.78s: assignment it's baked into the pricing
1445.52s: of the options and what I mean by that
1447.50s: is in most circumstances let's say if
1450.86s: you buy a call and it goes up it did
1453.62s: what you wanted so your position is now
1455.30s: worth more money
1456.86s: in this scenario it you don't make more
1460.58s: money if you exercise your option and
1463.22s: then sell the shares that's all already
1465.68s: baked into the premium of the option so
1468.08s: most people most of the time will just
1470.78s: trade the contract to exit so how do you
1474.56s: trade the contracts to exit well it's
1477.32s: the inverse of whatever you do to open
1479.48s: so in this case we have buy to open if
1483.44s: you buy to open then you need to sell to
1486.20s: close which is down here and it's just
1488.24s: like an equity position if you buy
1490.34s: shares of a stock in order to exit you
1492.68s: have to sell the shares of the stock
1494.00s: what confuses people is the inverse if
1496.88s: you sell to open you buy to close so if
1500.54s: you've ever shorted shares of stock you
1502.58s: know this inherently but in this case
1506.30s: um if you're not familiar with it
1507.56s: essentially you're selling something up
1509.60s: here at a higher value and you're hoping
1511.52s: to buy it back at a lower value
1514.40s: now this brings me back up here though
1516.92s: to American versus European option
1518.78s: because remember we dealt we did a
1521.30s: little rabbit dive into exercise and
1523.70s: trading the contract for settlement
1525.74s: when we talk about American options it
1528.50s: means they can be exercised early it
1532.10s: means as long as the options contract is
1534.92s: still open meaning it hasn't hit
1537.02s: expiration it can be exercised it
1540.32s: doesn't make sense to exercise all of
1542.36s: them all of the time but it can be
1544.78s: European options can only be exercised
1548.90s: at expiration so it's a big difference
1551.56s: and the way that options are priced and
1554.54s: stuff like that are based on the
1556.04s: differences between these two things but
1557.72s: it's important for you to know that if
1559.22s: you trade in American options contract
1561.14s: if you've bought it you have the right
1563.78s: to exercise at any point in time and if
1566.78s: you shorted it it can be exercised at
1570.44s: any point in time and you have to be
1572.60s: prepared to fulfill the obligation of
1575.90s: the exercise so if you short a call it
1578.24s: means you're going to have to sell
1579.92s: shares at a stock price whatever the
1582.44s: strike price was and if you're sure to
1584.54s: put it means that you have an obligation
1586.16s: to buy shares at that price now for
1589.34s: those that don't know the way that the
1590.60s: process works to give you a quick
1591.86s: overview it's a random assignment so the
1594.86s: broker has a list of open long options
1598.22s: contracts and open short options
1600.62s: contracts and if a option is exercise
1603.80s: whether it's because it's at expiration
1606.02s: and it's in the money which we'll get
1607.40s: into in a minute or just because
1609.32s: somebody wants to
1611.12s: they pair those people randomly so it
1614.18s: might be you might not be you you don't
1616.28s: know that's one of the risks of trading
1619.22s: options is you can get assigned if
1621.32s: you've sold and
1623.30s: you won't know it until it happens it's
1625.46s: very rare though to be abundantly clear
1627.56s: because if an option is exercised early
1630.32s: more often than not it doesn't make
1632.90s: money so if that unfortunate scenario
1635.60s: did happen you could probably neutralize
1638.18s: your position if you sold the option and
1640.58s: you were assigned you could probably
1642.80s: neutralize the position for a small
1644.54s: profit because it doesn't make sense to
1646.28s: do it and we'll get into the finances of
1648.38s: it in just a minute
1650.96s: now let's talk real quick about lot
1653.30s: sizes
1654.50s: when we're talking about these options
1656.72s: contracts you'll notice that this is the
1660.62s: price this is the bid this is the offer
1662.78s: so this is how much somebody's willing
1664.28s: to pay this is how much somebody's
1666.08s: asking to sell
1668.12s: and they're quoted essentially ten
1671.48s: dollars in a penny let's just use ten
1673.88s: dollars for this example for this 394
1675.92s: put that's not actually ten dollars
1679.60s: each contract represents 100 shares of
1684.44s: the underlying so you have to multiply
1687.14s: everything by 10 essentially
1690.56s: so what I mean by that is
1693.20s: let's say you want to buy one of these
1696.80s: 394 puts
1698.72s: you're not going to pay ten dollars
1700.64s: you're going to pay one thousand dollars
1703.94s: that's because of the option contract
1706.10s: multiplier you multiply these by 100
1709.40s: because each single contract is tied to
1713.24s: 100 shares of the underlying that's
1716.30s: Universal it doesn't matter if you're
1718.34s: trading SPY it doesn't matter if you're
1720.50s: trading Apple so if we pull up Apple and
1723.38s: the let's say the 150 call is trading
1726.74s: for five dollars and 20 cents it's not
1729.92s: five dollars and twenty cents you have
1731.78s: to multiply out it's 525 dollars
1735.62s: so when we're talking about options
1737.78s: contracts or lot sizes it's important to
1741.62s: remember the multiplier so if I said I
1744.98s: have a five lot of Apple whatever calls
1750.02s: it means that I have rights to 500
1753.68s: shares it's not five shares it's 500
1756.86s: shares so using that same example if I
1761.00s: wanted to buy a five lot of these 150
1763.76s: calls it means that I would pay 520 per
1768.44s: lot so it would be 520 times five that
1772.82s: would be how much I pay in general and
1775.10s: then it's the inverse if you chose to
1777.20s: sell the 150 calls it means that you
1780.38s: would collect you would bring in that
1782.78s: money because you were selling to open
1786.02s: and that leads me down here actually
1788.84s: to what happens with money in these
1791.48s: different scenarios so for example if I
1795.50s: buy a call I'm buying something money is
1798.86s: going out
1800.84s: it is a debit we call it a debit in
1803.78s: options trading
1805.34s: if I sell something it's called a credit
1808.46s: it means I'm receiving something to open
1811.34s: the position
1812.72s: so a couple terms that you're going to
1814.82s: want to know is buy to open is BTO and
1820.10s: then the inverse of buy to open is sell
1822.74s: to close s t c
1825.86s: then we have cell to open
1829.12s: s-t-o and then buy to close BTC so these
1834.02s: are the inverse transactions for one
1836.00s: another and whenever we're talking about
1837.92s: options if you're long an option it
1840.50s: means you BTO you bought to open if you
1843.68s: sold an option to establish a position
1845.54s: use sto soul to open
1849.02s: and then the movement of money is
1851.42s: exactly as I outlined if you buy
1853.58s: something you are paying out so you are
1856.52s: giving somebody else money that's a
1858.56s: debit and then if you're selling you're
1860.42s: receiving a credit I already walked
1862.52s: through expirations but I want to give
1864.38s: you a quick overview you'll notice that
1867.74s: there are some gray expirations and then
1870.20s: there are these yellow ones
1872.12s: standard expiration
1874.64s: for options is the third Friday of the
1878.06s: month so actually Apple was a better
1879.62s: example if you'll notice 17 March is the
1884.12s: third Friday of the month so at the end
1887.36s: of the market on 17 March after the
1890.54s: market closes they're gonna process all
1893.36s: the options chains and then on Saturdays
1895.88s: when they're settled that's if you get a
1898.10s: sign if you don't get assigned if you
1899.84s: want to exercise or don't want to
1901.16s: exercise all that's processed then again
1903.32s: reminder it can be exercised or assigned
1908.06s: during the life cycle of the option but
1910.10s: it's rare
1911.36s: so now the other thing
1914.00s: that I want to highlight are these
1915.92s: additional expirations these are
1918.14s: weeklies so what you're going to find is
1921.38s: the more liquid products that are traded
1924.56s: meaning there's a lot of volume a lot of
1926.30s: shares there's a lot of expirations and
1928.88s: it's just because a lot of people like
1930.26s: to trade different time frames so that's
1932.90s: why in iwm you see all these different
1935.96s: time frames available and that's for
1938.60s: that exact reason because there's lots
1940.16s: of different interests in different time
1941.96s: frames and positions but
1943.88s: standard expiration is the third Friday
1945.74s: of the month but it's after the market
1947.48s: closes normally there are am expirations
1952.76s: meaning in the morning so you have to be
1955.34s: careful with what you're looking at
1956.90s: there's not a ton of products that that
1960.08s: work that way but there are some
1962.78s: so if we look at SPX notice how this one
1967.04s: says am that means in the morning
1970.82s: so some slight differences in there
1973.58s: you're mostly going to see am
1974.90s: expirations in the big indices so SPX
1977.60s: ndx rut but it's just for your
1980.00s: consumption most stuff you're going to
1982.04s: trade is going to be an American option
1983.90s: with a standard lot size meaning 100
1985.88s: share multiplier with different
1988.82s: expirations but it's going to be after
1990.80s: the market
1992.30s: something like SPX actually is a
1995.12s: European style option it's actually cash
1997.16s: settled so there's no underlying that
1999.02s: moves this gets a little further into
2000.94s: detail but it's just important to note
2003.28s: that there are slight differences so
2005.32s: when you first start trading these are
2007.18s: important things for you to look at for
2009.04s: each product you're trading so that you
2010.60s: can learn
2012.04s: all right that essentially wraps up the
2014.62s: cause and put section now I want to talk
2017.32s: about the movement of equities very
2019.60s: quickly so if you buy a call what does
2023.92s: that mean you have the right to do what
2028.18s: answer in the comments below if you've
2031.30s: sold a put
2033.88s: you have the obligation to do
2037.42s: based on those we're going to go into
2039.28s: some example on how these different
2040.96s: positions make money but it's important
2043.30s: for you to understand not just how calls
2046.36s: and puts behave as products themselves
2049.42s: as in how they make money but also what
2052.72s: are the terms of the contract based on
2054.52s: if you bought or sold the contract
2058.12s: all right I would take a pause here if I
2060.46s: were you and then we're going to move
2061.90s: into premium and moneyness I think the
2064.96s: main thing for you to be able to answer
2066.22s: in this section is what is a call what
2069.22s: is a put how do calls behave when the
2073.66s: underlying goes up and down how to puts
2075.76s: behave when the underlying goes up and
2077.44s: down and then those other two questions
2079.06s: I just shared with you
2080.74s: all right next up we have premium and
2085.24s: moneyness so we talked about the premium
2087.46s: of an option this is how much an option
2089.32s: is worth this is the value that's
2091.54s: assigned to the options contract itself
2095.28s: why doesn't options contract itself have
2099.28s: value well
2101.56s: if you'll recall I told you that calls
2105.94s: appreciate in value as the underlying
2108.28s: goes up and puts appreciate and value
2110.68s: when the underlying goes down
2112.72s: so if I buy a 4 000 call today for forty
2119.02s: three dollars or how much is that you
2121.66s: got it four thousand three hundred
2123.10s: dollars if I buy this contract today for
2126.28s: that amount but then SPX goes up
2130.06s: it doesn't have to go past my strike for
2133.06s: this value to go up as long as it goes
2135.58s: up at all this will start to move up in
2138.16s: value
2139.12s: so now I have the right to buy something
2142.66s: at four thousand
2144.40s: even though when I first bought it it
2146.98s: was only trading at 39.70 but it started
2149.56s: to move in my favor
2151.24s: so the reason why options contracts have
2154.36s: inherent value by themselves is because
2156.82s: they give you the right to access in
2160.12s: underlying security at a specific price
2162.70s: or the inverse if it's a put let's say
2167.26s: that you have 100 shares of spy let's
2170.74s: use spy now
2173.08s: and let's say that you you let's say you
2178.18s: bought spy at 415 and then you bought a
2183.30s: 410 put
2186.34s: what does that put give you the right to
2188.32s: do by the way for those that are taking
2191.08s: the quizzes and commenting below what
2192.88s: these mean if I bought spy at 4 15 and I
2196.60s: bought a 410 put what does that mean
2198.40s: well the answer is it means I get to
2201.76s: sell my shares of spy at 410
2206.64s: regardless of where buy is Trading
2210.70s: so that becomes more valuable as spy
2214.30s: goes down because even though spy is
2216.52s: trading at
2217.62s: 396.26 I still have bought the right to
2222.76s: sell my shares at 410. so somebody even
2227.20s: though spy is trading at 396 right now I
2229.96s: have the right to sell mine at 410.
2233.02s: that's why they have value
2235.78s: so when we talk about the premium of an
2237.82s: option or the options value there's kind
2239.56s: of two main branches here we have
2242.08s: intrinsic and extrinsic value
2245.28s: intrinsic value is how far something is
2248.50s: in the money which we're going to get
2250.00s: into in just a second and then extrinsic
2252.94s: value is time value
2256.18s: so one of the things to note is that all
2259.36s: open options will have extrinsic value
2262.24s: because they haven't expired yet so as
2264.46s: long as they haven't expired there's
2265.72s: going to be time value in the options
2268.92s: intrinsic value is it only pertains to
2272.92s: options that are in the money
2276.22s: so what does in the money out of the
2278.68s: money mean well it's slightly different
2281.02s: for calls and puts
2283.24s: these are the protocols here so you can
2286.12s: kind of take the notes and then I'm
2287.68s: going to work through them with you this
2290.02s: is literally not going to make any sense
2292.24s: to you the first 10 or 15 times you hear
2294.34s: it do not worry about it just listen to
2297.82s: what I'm talking about and then just
2300.66s: conceptualize the positions and why the
2303.64s: value changes the way it does
2305.74s: so when an option is in the money
2308.98s: when we're talking about calls notice
2312.22s: how these calls here are grayed out and
2315.16s: then these ones are kind of clear
2316.66s: they're just a black background and then
2319.42s: it's inverse for puts it's because
2321.88s: they're inverse when they're in the
2323.86s: money and out of the money so in this
2326.26s: example
2327.64s: when K stands for the strike price
2331.72s: s stands for the security price when the
2336.52s: strike price is above the security price
2339.46s: it's out of the money
2341.80s: so right now in this example this is uh
2344.80s: I took the screenshot a little while ago
2346.42s: but in this example spy was trading at
2349.86s: 391.49 this is the security price
2354.94s: if we look at this 392 call over here
2360.34s: if we look at this 392 call
2362.92s: that is our strike price so is 392
2368.40s: greater than 391.49 in that case the
2373.30s: answer is yes so in this scenario that
2376.18s: option is out of the money
2378.52s: so when we're talking about calls this
2381.22s: is what determines money-ness
2384.06s: if our strike price is above
2388.18s: the security price that's out of the
2389.80s: money
2390.58s: if our strike price is below the
2392.74s: security price it's in the money what is
2395.62s: in the money mean well again same
2397.48s: scenario 391.49 is a security price
2400.36s: right here then we have let's use this
2403.06s: 390 call right here
2405.70s: is 390 below
2410.16s: 391.49 the answer is yes that means it's
2413.62s: in the money so what happens when
2415.90s: something is in the money is it
2417.46s: immediately exercised does the position
2420.46s: start making more money
2422.50s: when something is in the money it just
2425.02s: means it has intrinsic value
2429.46s: how do you determine what intrinsic
2431.98s: value is for calls all you do is take
2435.76s: the security price minus the strike
2438.46s: price
2439.42s: then you get your intrinsic value
2442.06s: so in this scenario if we have our
2446.22s: 390 strike which is right here
2449.26s: and our security is trading at
2452.16s: 391.49 you tell me what's the intrinsic
2456.40s: value of that 390 call if we take the
2460.90s: security price of 391.49 we subtract 390
2465.28s: we get 1.49 of intrinsic value
2470.44s: so if we look at the option right now
2473.02s: it's well not right now when I took the
2474.76s: screenshot it was trading around 10 20
2477.22s: call it
2478.54s: so the premium is 10 20 which is not
2482.56s: actually 10 20 cents it's one thousand
2485.38s: dollars right move the decimal place
2487.36s: over twice so it's one thousand twenty
2490.42s: dollars
2491.50s: so you have that
2494.08s: 10 20. you're going to subtract the
2497.98s: intrinsic value which we just calculated
2500.08s: is 1.49 so out of that ten dollars and
2504.52s: 20 cents in this options contract
2508.44s: 1.49 of that is intrinsic value and then
2512.08s: the rest is extrinsic value which is
2514.96s: time value
2516.46s: so in this case you can see that the
2518.50s: option had 30 days left to go
2521.08s: so those are the two different kinds of
2523.48s: options for or I'm sorry money-ness
2526.30s: protocols for calls we have in the money
2529.36s: and then we have out of the money now at
2532.12s: the money is a little more loose but
2534.70s: essentially we refer to as the products
2538.42s: that are one strike in and one strike
2541.00s: out of the money as at the money it
2543.46s: means that they're trading those two
2544.84s: strike prices are trading right around
2546.94s: where the underlying itself is trading
2549.40s: so these we call at the money and then
2551.68s: the stuff that's further away we call
2553.30s: them in the money or out of the money
2556.42s: so let's move over now to puts very
2558.82s: quickly
2559.90s: for puts it is just the inverse
2562.72s: everything is going to be flipped so if
2565.60s: the strike price is greater
2569.56s: than the security price it's in the
2572.38s: money
2573.22s: so in this case we have this 392 strike
2577.18s: price the security is trading at 391.49
2581.16s: is 392 greater than 391.49 yes it is
2587.80s: indeed so that is in the money and then
2590.98s: it is the inverse for the out of the
2592.42s: money stuff we have a 390 strike price
2595.18s: here
2596.50s: we have 391.49 is the security price
2600.40s: is 390 less than
2604.20s: 391.49 yes out of the money
2607.66s: and how do you calculate the intrinsic
2609.58s: value notice the difference between
2611.14s: these two formulas it's nothing crazy
2612.70s: but the relationship between calls and
2615.64s: puts is typically inverse so if we take
2618.70s: the security minus the strike price to
2621.22s: understand our intrinsic value for calls
2623.08s: for puts we just take the strike price
2625.60s: minus the security price
2628.36s: so if we have 392 is our strike price
2631.96s: the security price is 391.49 all you do
2635.80s: is take 392 subtract
2638.76s: 391.49 that is your intrinsic value and
2642.70s: then the rest is your extrinsic value or
2645.46s: your time value
2646.84s: now a couple important things here
2649.48s: one a very simple back of the napkin
2652.78s: quick way to see extrinsic value is just
2656.14s: to look at the corresponding out of the
2658.36s: money option so let's say that I wanted
2660.58s: to know the extrinsic value for this 392
2665.62s: um for this 392. this is actually a bad
2667.96s: example because it's higher which that's
2670.06s: not super common that is an anomaly does
2672.70s: happen but essentially you can use
2675.94s: typically the corresponding option let's
2678.04s: use this one instead so let's say if you
2680.20s: want to look at this 391 call and you
2683.44s: say okay this is trading for 9.55 what
2687.10s: is the corresponding out of the money
2689.26s: put trading for it's seven dollars and
2691.12s: seventy cents so that's roughly the
2693.16s: extrinsic value of this option it's not
2695.44s: perfect as you can tell even in this
2697.06s: scenario interestingly enough it's not
2699.76s: it at all and that's probably because
2700.78s: the market was close when I took the
2702.04s: snapshot but generally it's an easy back
2705.40s: of the napkin way
2707.08s: so now we know and before we move on to
2710.38s: the next piece here I want you to
2712.72s: explain to me
2714.28s: what is intrinsic value and what is
2717.22s: extrinsic value you can throw it in the
2719.08s: comments below you can throw it in your
2720.40s: notebook if you can answer the question
2721.78s: and a quick reminder on the answer
2724.14s: intrinsic value is how far something is
2726.52s: in the money extrinsic value is how much
2729.82s: time value is left in an option now
2732.28s: there's something important to note here
2734.68s: notice how I said as time passes the
2738.58s: extrinsic value of the option is going
2740.56s: to contract because at expiration when
2743.26s: we have no more days left in the
2744.58s: contract no more time left in the
2745.96s: contract there's no more time value to
2748.12s: be assigned to an option so that means
2751.24s: if something is out of the money it's
2753.76s: going to assimilate to zero and I can
2756.64s: show you what that looks like so if we
2758.80s: come back over here to spy
2760.72s: let's go far out in time if we look at
2763.18s: this 325
2765.64s: um
2766.18s: if we look at this 325 19 Jan options
2769.42s: chain you can see that the out of the
2771.40s: money options here the 390 put is
2774.82s: trading for 22.50 the 400 call is
2778.54s: trading at 33 something like that now
2781.78s: let's move in closer and I'm going to
2783.52s: use the one strike at the money for both
2785.44s: the 395 call is only trading for 6.56
2789.78s: and then the 396 put is trading for 6.74
2794.08s: cents notice how much less these numbers
2796.84s: are well it's because there's way less
2799.24s: time in those options the longer an
2802.36s: option has in its lifespan the more
2805.60s: value it has assigned to it because the
2808.42s: contract spans a longer time frame so
2811.72s: let's take a look now at something
2814.48s: that's even closer we can look at
2816.64s: something that expired today notice how
2819.22s: all of these are zero these are out of
2822.16s: the money notice how all of these are
2824.50s: these are zero two it's essentially
2826.36s: right out the money which is why there's
2827.68s: a tiny bit of value but that's gone now
2829.48s: notice how all of these are zero now
2832.24s: notice how these are going to be
2835.18s: relegated to just the intrinsic value so
2838.48s: you could do the math if spy here closed
2841.78s: at
2842.64s: 396.26 and these are trading for this is
2845.86s: a 395 call you can do the math to see
2848.74s: what the intrinsic value is now
2850.96s: sometimes these won't line up neatly and
2853.18s: it's because at expiration there's a lot
2854.98s: of weird funky things that are going
2856.48s: through the brokerage platforms as
2858.16s: they're clearing but that will be the
2860.20s: intrinsic value so an important
2862.48s: differentiation between these two is
2864.16s: intrinsic value remains after an option
2867.88s: expires there's still intrinsic value
2870.16s: it's an important note
2872.50s: now when we're talking about extrinsic
2875.14s: value notice how I've been referred to
2876.64s: it as time value because that's just how
2878.74s: much time is left in the option there's
2880.96s: some important details when we talk
2883.36s: about that and I want to get into that
2886.54s: right now
2887.74s: so when we're thinking about this
2889.96s: premium how how do we come up with this
2892.60s: is it just a random number that falls
2894.76s: from the sky how do we determine the
2897.04s: premium of an option well there are
2900.16s: different pricing models that are used
2902.14s: Black Shoals Merton model is a common
2904.96s: one you're going to hear binomial trees
2907.24s: there's lots of different ways you can
2909.46s: price options the most important thing
2911.74s: for you to know as a new options Trader
2914.02s: is its consensus driven
2916.00s: so some big institutions are going to
2918.28s: use all their crazy PhD think tanks to
2921.46s: price options as perfectly as they can
2923.38s: then they're going to go to the market
2925.06s: with a bid and an offer that is how
2928.36s: options are priced they're going to be
2930.64s: priced based on the collective consensus
2933.94s: of people so what I mean by that is if
2937.00s: we come over here
2939.16s: and we find something that has a little
2941.26s: bit of time left let's use this 14 March
2944.98s: this 395 put or let's use this 396 call
2949.60s: which is trading for six dollars and
2951.28s: twenty something cents
2953.02s: this is the bid and the offer from the
2958.48s: nearest two Market participants that's
2961.72s: the value
2962.80s: so what I'm highlighting here is most of
2965.68s: the time when we're trading options we
2967.12s: try to get filled at what we call the
2969.52s: mid which is the midpoint between these
2972.16s: two the bid and the ask the bid in the
2974.98s: ask are kind of the the two points where
2977.20s: you will get a fill very quickly so if
2981.16s: you want if you want to buy something
2983.50s: and you buy it at the ask you're going
2985.78s: to get a fill and then kind of the
2987.28s: inverse for the bid now the thing with
2992.08s: um consensus driven models is it really
2995.26s: is predicated on what people think
2997.66s: things are worth so don't worry about
3001.02s: how all the math goes into creating an
3004.26s: options price there are lots of
3006.30s: resources being deployed to price
3009.36s: options fairly that being said there are
3013.92s: Niche markets that reward good options
3018.00s: pricing you're not going to get to that
3019.92s: for quite a while as a new options
3021.24s: Trader so I wouldn't waste your time
3022.98s: running down that path but I do want to
3025.62s: give you some general inputs on how this
3028.68s: part of things works
3030.54s: so what I want to show you is the Black
3034.20s: Shoals Merton model which is it's just a
3036.84s: differential equation it might look kind
3038.64s: of crazy I have some specific videos
3040.26s: that walk through this in detail I'm not
3042.48s: going to go into detail on all this I'm
3044.64s: just showing you how this model prices
3046.98s: options
3048.06s: and the thing with the BSM or Black
3050.16s: Shoals Martin model is it has some
3052.50s: shortfalls it has assumptions baked into
3055.92s: it that we know are not true one of
3058.92s: which is volatility remains constant
3061.26s: across expirations it's not true we know
3064.20s: it's not true but we still use this as a
3067.38s: theoretical starting point and then all
3070.20s: of these different entities price
3071.76s: options using all of their tools and
3074.28s: then we come to a consensus but you'll
3076.62s: notice that a lot of times this isn't
3078.60s: that far off so the main inputs for the
3081.96s: black shoals model the underlying so
3084.96s: this is what is the price of the
3088.32s: underlying that we're talking about so
3091.38s: in this example spy is 396.26 that's the
3095.34s: underline the strike price so in this
3098.22s: case if we're talking about the 396 call
3100.92s: that's your strike price if you're
3102.42s: talking about the 390 put that's your
3104.28s: strike price then we have days to
3106.38s: expiration how long is the contract in
3109.44s: this case it's 14 days or you can have
3111.78s: something out here that's 52 days
3113.28s: whatever the day's expiration is then we
3116.34s: have the risk free rate so different
3120.06s: entities use different benchmarks for
3123.30s: the risk-free rate most of the time it's
3125.52s: very short-term bonds so that's what
3127.74s: we're going to use for the risk-free
3128.76s: rate then we have the yield if the
3131.82s: underlying pays a dividend this is
3133.80s: really going to impact the calls a bit
3135.66s: more but it also impacts the puts
3137.40s: because when something pays out a
3139.62s: dividend we know it drops by the
3141.90s: dividend so the original Black Shoals
3144.48s: Martin model didn't include dividend but
3146.16s: we've adapted it since to include it but
3148.08s: yeah it's just for your consumption this
3150.48s: is the big one and this is why it's in
3152.46s: yellow and this is also why I have it
3155.22s: here volatility
3157.50s: we know the underlying price we know the
3160.38s: strike price we know how far out in time
3162.48s: it is we know what the risk free rate is
3164.46s: we know if there is a dividend yield
3167.18s: this is the only unknown
3171.72s: volatility and this is going to dive
3174.30s: into beautifully what we're talking
3175.86s: about next but before we do that
3178.32s: I want you to explain to me what is
3182.16s: intrinsic value and what is extrinsic
3184.80s: value
3185.64s: and then I also want to know when
3189.06s: something when an option expires in the
3192.12s: money does it have extrinsic value with
3196.38s: that let's dive into this curious yellow
3199.38s: one which is volatility
3203.58s: in short volatility is variance it's how
3207.84s: much something moves and we use this in
3210.72s: statistics in general but you've heard
3213.00s: the term volatile weather before the
3215.22s: markets are volatile that just means
3217.08s: things are moving a lot so as volatile
3220.14s: as volatility is higher it means that
3223.50s: there's a higher variance in price or
3226.92s: whatever it is that we're observing
3229.14s: so when we're talking about the markets
3231.72s: there's really two types of volatility
3233.58s: we're going to be talking about implied
3235.56s: volatility and historic or realized
3239.10s: volatility implied volatility we
3241.56s: typically Market as IV and then historic
3244.98s: volatility as HV
3247.38s: implied volatility is pretty simple it's
3250.56s: what we think things are going to look
3253.92s: like in the future
3256.20s: as you guessed it's a forecast it means
3259.92s: we are guessing what things are going to
3263.28s: look like going forward as you probably
3265.92s: could imagine if you've ever seen the
3268.44s: volatility in weather predictions
3271.80s: pretty wide even though technology has
3273.84s: gotten good you can't always perfectly
3276.30s: predict what the weather is going to be
3277.80s: 10 days 20 days 30 days from now but in
3280.92s: implied volatility that's the name of
3282.48s: the game we are trying to forecast what
3286.14s: we think volatility is going to be
3288.24s: that's implied volatility why does that
3291.12s: matter why does implied volatility
3292.74s: matter well think of it this way
3295.08s: if I wanted to trade an options contract
3297.18s: in spy and I think things are going to
3301.20s: be super volatile meaning they're going
3303.36s: to go up real high down real low they're
3305.82s: going to move around a whole lot it
3308.40s: means I probably don't have a good feel
3310.50s: on where it might land how it's going to
3312.30s: impact my options position so as
3314.70s: volatility goes up the premium for
3318.30s: options contracts calls and puts goes up
3322.32s: it's because there's more unknowns So
3325.32s: for anybody to sell those options
3327.66s: they're going to demand more
3330.06s: compensation for those options so when
3333.24s: we're thinking about volatility as
3335.22s: things are more volatile
3337.68s: the premium of all options calls and
3340.86s: puts are going to go up
3343.38s: and that's an important metric because
3346.38s: this is an input to option pricing via
3349.80s: extrinsic value
3351.42s: so
3352.68s: when we're talking about options we're
3354.66s: talking about implied volatility because
3357.18s: options are forward contracts they go
3360.18s: into the future so we care about what we
3362.94s: think volatility is going to be and our
3366.42s: perception of volatility changes pretty
3368.58s: regularly so we see that reflected in
3371.70s: movements in implied volatility then we
3374.58s: have historic volatility this means how
3376.92s: volatile were things and we can observe
3380.66s: historic volatility very clearly we can
3384.06s: measure it you could pull up a stock
3385.62s: chart and you can say the stock went up
3387.42s: to this point and down to this point
3389.40s: over the last 30 days this is the
3392.70s: historic volatility
3394.56s: in implied volatility you don't have
3397.08s: that luxury it's a forward-looking
3399.36s: forecast
3400.82s: how do we create implied volatility
3405.06s: forecasts how do we know how much
3406.68s: volatility to give something that goes
3409.32s: back to those big think tanks from all
3412.62s: these big institutions all the PHD think
3414.84s: tanks that are pricing options that's
3417.78s: really what they're trying to do they're
3419.52s: trying to as accurately as humanly
3421.68s: possible price forward looking implied
3425.34s: volatility so that's why we can price it
3428.10s: ourselves you can come up with your own
3430.02s: garch t jump diffusion model and price
3433.08s: volatility yourself but you're probably
3435.48s: not going to price it better than these
3437.22s: large institutions with huge resources
3439.26s: available to them so it's important for
3441.72s: you to know what they're trying to do
3444.06s: but I would not waste a whole bunch of
3445.98s: time at least early on trying to price
3448.26s: it better than them because I have some
3451.08s: pricing models that I use myself and
3453.00s: it's more just for my own education and
3455.70s: engagement at no point do I think my
3457.98s: option pricing models are out pricing
3459.96s: other entities fees so
3462.60s: I'm gonna throw a link in the video
3464.82s: description below when you're ready to
3466.44s: get your mind blown about volatility and
3469.20s: I'm going to talk in that video about
3470.76s: things like volatility smiles and
3473.22s: volatility surfaces but long story short
3476.46s: when we think about volatility it
3479.28s: changes for different time frames and
3481.02s: different strikes and that's it so if
3483.66s: and that is what an implied volatility
3485.34s: surface is when we think about let's say
3488.46s: this 7 March seven days to expiration we
3492.18s: look at the implied volatility that's
3493.74s: this it's kind of squished because I
3495.18s: have a lot of things in here but it's
3496.80s: this column right here so we can see
3499.02s: that the implied volatility goes a
3501.00s: little bit further the further out of
3502.38s: the money we go here and then it kind of
3504.06s: tailors off you can tell it doesn't even
3505.50s: compute it in here and then let's go
3507.72s: further out in time so you can see that
3510.00s: a little further out of the money here
3511.44s: on these puts implied volatility is
3513.30s: higher and then it's lower the further
3514.56s: in the money we go
3516.24s: and then let's go all the way out to
3518.64s: these 290s and you can see all of these
3521.04s: implied volatilities they're different
3522.90s: for the same strike across different
3524.82s: expirations and then they're different
3526.38s: for calls and puts that's what creates
3528.78s: an implied volatility surface sounds
3531.36s: more complex than it really is so when
3533.94s: we talk about implied volatility we're
3536.46s: just pricing the volatility for
3538.02s: individual options and when you hear the
3540.30s: concept of an implied volatility surface
3542.22s: all it's doing is taking the plot of the
3546.48s: individual implied volatilities for each
3549.30s: strike within each expiration and it's
3552.00s: comparing it against all the other ones
3553.74s: but importantly and contrary to Black
3556.44s: Shoals it's not linear it's not the same
3558.30s: which I just showed you right now
3561.06s: so when we're talking about volatility
3562.98s: it is the heart and blood of derivatives
3566.40s: it's why options have any outstanding
3570.18s: value is because the future is unknown
3573.96s: so people are willing to buy things to
3576.48s: hedge their risk people are willing to
3578.22s: speculate on that unknown because of
3580.08s: Leverage all of it is based out of
3582.54s: volatility
3584.16s: so quick recap question throw it in the
3586.74s: comments below what is implied
3588.54s: volatility what is historic volatility
3591.78s: now I want to talk to you just a little
3593.70s: bit more about this relationship so when
3596.58s: we have the premium listed for any sort
3600.12s: of option we already know that there's
3602.10s: intrinsic and extrinsic value you are an
3604.92s: expert in that at this point
3606.72s: now extrinsic value as we already know
3609.12s: is simply time value and time value has
3612.90s: these components this is important to
3615.18s: note these are intimately tied to one
3618.66s: another because the longer the duration
3621.90s: of the options contract the more room
3625.80s: volatility has to play so if we expect
3629.22s: the variance of something do you think
3632.76s: the weather will vary more in two days
3636.24s: or 180 days
3639.42s: probably 180 days it's the same thing
3642.24s: with options contracts so when we have
3644.94s: longer time frames one options premiums
3648.96s: are going to be higher because the
3651.18s: contract is longer duration I want to be
3654.06s: compensated as a seller for the duration
3658.14s: of a contract
3659.52s: in that same vein when you add
3663.18s: volatility into that equation if
3665.16s: something has a longer runway for the
3667.92s: contract itself we expect more variance
3671.94s: in the underlying itself volatility
3674.40s: tends to be higher so it is why you're
3677.46s: going to see more often than not if we
3680.52s: look at these shorter term options like
3683.28s: this 14 days to expiration and we look
3686.04s: at this 396 call again it's trading for
3688.32s: 620. if we go out here to 325 days
3692.46s: um it's not even listed but it's
3695.04s: essentially trading for 30 something
3696.78s: like that because it's between these
3698.28s: that's actually another important note
3699.60s: though notice how I when I went further
3701.70s: out in time that we moved from one
3704.04s: dollar expirations to five dollar right
3706.56s: so in this shorter term expiration
3708.36s: they're listed at one dollar
3710.28s: the strike prices but out here it's at
3712.68s: five dollars that is for liquidity as we
3716.58s: get further and further out in time
3720.06s: there typically are going to be fewer
3722.16s: strike prices and it's so that more
3724.32s: people participate in those existing
3727.98s: strike prices because if there's too
3729.78s: many there's not a lot of liquidity so
3732.18s: what's going to happen here is 325 days
3734.94s: out they're only offering five dollar
3736.86s: wide strikes but then as you start to
3739.32s: get in closer you'll notice that there's
3740.88s: one dollar wide strikes
3743.16s: not abnormal it just means as time
3745.50s: passes an additional expiration Cycles
3747.78s: open up that's where you're going to see
3749.76s: dollar increments at least in the Spy
3751.74s: that'll happen in some different
3752.82s: products just kind of an interesting
3754.20s: side note
3755.40s: Okay so
3757.56s: talk to me about premium specifically
3761.22s: volatility when we're pricing an option
3764.22s: do we use implied volatility or historic
3768.36s: volatility again throw it in the
3770.16s: comments below or write it in your notes
3772.08s: but that is an important differentiation
3774.24s: and volatility is the heart and soul of
3777.66s: derivatives
3779.04s: cool so moving on now to the second to
3782.88s: last piece which is the Greeks I want to
3784.80s: talk to you very quickly about the first
3786.90s: order Greeks there are second order and
3790.38s: even third order Greeks I actually have
3792.78s: some older videos on those but they're
3795.36s: way less pertinent to us as Traders so
3799.14s: I'm not gonna bog you down especially on
3801.66s: an introduction to options video but be
3806.28s: and if there's interest you could throw
3807.90s: it in the comments below and I'm happy
3809.16s: to take a look
3810.36s: so let's talk about the Greeks we have a
3813.84s: handful we have Delta gamma Theta Vega
3817.02s: row which interestingly enough these are
3819.36s: not all from the Greek alphabet it's
3821.34s: kind of a misnomer some of these are
3823.14s: actually not from the Greek alphabet
3824.64s: funny enough but we call them the Greeks
3826.80s: so Delta
3828.60s: gamma Theta Vega rho these are simply
3832.32s: metrics that we observe to understand
3836.12s: how different traits of an options
3839.28s: contract will move so notice up here
3842.28s: this is Delta gamma Theta Vega rho then
3847.02s: Delta gamma Theta Vega rho and you can
3850.02s: tell that there's differences depending
3851.64s: on how far out in time you go or how far
3855.36s: in the money or out of the money you go
3857.54s: and also a difference if it's a call or
3860.64s: a put so this goes pretty deep and
3863.76s: there's actually going to be some
3864.90s: homework for you on this one and what
3868.38s: I'm going to tell you to do is pick a
3871.14s: stock whatever you want and then as I go
3874.62s: through this look at the metrics pull
3877.20s: them up on your options platform and
3879.66s: write them down because it's going to be
3881.58s: useful so for Delta gamma Theta Vega row
3885.30s: I literally just want you to create a
3887.46s: grid that shows Delta gamma Theta Vega
3890.88s: row just like that and then we're going
3893.10s: to do different expirations and then
3895.26s: calls or puts so the way that this
3897.96s: little table will look is just like this
3900.72s: so all you're going to do is break them
3902.52s: down just like that you're going to have
3904.08s: call and put and then expiration one
3906.18s: expiration two expiration three and what
3909.24s: I would recommend is you do a seven day
3911.58s: expiration here a 30-day expiration here
3914.76s: a 60 or 90 day expiration here a 180 day
3919.38s: expiration here and then a 365 day
3922.26s: expiration plus over here and write
3925.02s: these out for all of them that is the
3927.12s: best possible way that you are going to
3928.62s: understand the relationship between
3930.00s: these things and I cannot recommend it
3932.28s: enough because as I go through these
3933.90s: right now you're gonna say this makes no
3936.18s: sense to me and I don't blame you
3937.68s: because it sounds weird but once you
3939.54s: understand some of these different
3940.92s: traits it'll make a little more sense
3943.86s: Delta
3945.54s: premium rate of change per one point
3948.36s: move in the underlying so if we come
3950.46s: over here and let's take a look at calls
3953.10s: first and we go to Delta this has a
3956.40s: Delta of 50. this means that for every
3959.52s: one dollar move in spy one dollar up
3964.02s: we're gonna make 50 cents on the premium
3968.28s: if spy goes down by a dollar means this
3972.06s: is going to lose 50 cents
3974.64s: the other thing you'll notice is that
3976.44s: all in the money options have Deltas of
3979.98s: 50 or more
3982.68s: all things that are further the further
3984.78s: out of the money you go the lower your
3986.22s: Delta goes the further in the money you
3988.32s: go the higher your Delta goes and that's
3990.60s: for calls and puts there's two other
3993.00s: uses for Delta
3995.34s: the first use is to tell you
3997.56s: theoretically how many shares you're
3999.90s: controlling so what does that mean one
4002.66s: remember when I told you earlier that
4004.22s: there's an options contract and each
4007.10s: options contract is tied to 100 shares
4009.80s: of whatever the underlying security is
4011.90s: that you're Trading
4013.22s: so in that scenario not it's not going
4016.64s: to behave as 100 shares right out of the
4019.52s: gate so what do I mean by that well if
4021.74s: this is a one lot meaning we're only
4025.28s: trading one contract and spy moves a
4028.64s: dollar
4029.48s: well why don't if it's a hundred shares
4032.06s: why doesn't it move by one well it's
4035.00s: because over the life of an option the
4037.82s: Delta changes that's one of the
4040.04s: Strategic components to these is there's
4043.58s: benefits and drawbacks to that but let's
4046.28s: say for example you wanted it to behave
4048.74s: just like stock well you could buy a
4051.56s: call that's like a 90 Delta or even a
4054.02s: one Delta and it would be cheaper than
4057.14s: buying shares of stock but it would
4059.30s: essentially move dollar for dollar with
4061.40s: the stock
4062.66s: so Delta itself though just tells us the
4066.62s: rate of change of the premium of an
4068.90s: option now notice over here though Delta
4071.96s: is negative
4073.46s: so when we're looking at Delta we're
4075.80s: talking about a plus one dollar move and
4079.94s: that's why this is negative so this
4082.04s: means if again spy goes up one dollar
4084.76s: this call is going to gain 50 cents in
4088.28s: premium this put is going to lose 50
4091.64s: cents in premium why is that remember
4094.46s: way back when I said if an underline
4098.12s: goes up calls appreciate in value and if
4100.94s: an underline goes down
4102.68s: calls depreciate in value or puts
4105.80s: appreciate in value that's why these are
4108.56s: marked as is so what then happens if spy
4111.92s: goes down by a dollar it means that this
4114.92s: put is actually going to gain money and
4118.88s: then this call is going to lose money
4122.78s: so that's Delta the other way we use
4125.72s: Delta as a rough probability of an
4129.62s: option expiring in the money at
4132.44s: expiration it's not perfect but it's
4134.84s: pretty close
4135.98s: the probability components of options is
4138.20s: one of the the Hallmarks of them because
4140.24s: there are probabilities for everything
4141.50s: so notice how this 396
4145.82s: uh put has a Delta of 49
4149.72s: but the probability of it being in the
4153.56s: money at expiration is 50.97 so slight
4156.80s: variance and then you'll also notice
4159.38s: that it kind of changes depending on how
4161.84s: far out of the money you go the degree
4163.52s: of the variance
4164.90s: so you can calculate based on option
4167.66s: pricing and where the underlying is
4169.34s: currently priced what is the probability
4171.38s: that that underlying is going to be in
4173.66s: different places that's just using what
4176.48s: we were talking about before volatility
4177.98s: you can make a forecast on where things
4180.50s: are likely to go
4182.06s: and you can apply that same thought
4184.04s: process to the pricing or to the
4186.08s: analysis of options so that's why we can
4188.48s: use Delta as a rough approximation it's
4191.24s: not perfect you actually have to do the
4193.52s: math but
4195.02s: back when I showed you uh the premium
4198.20s: down here there's actually you this is
4200.96s: baking in probability right that's what
4203.00s: this Sigma is different standard
4204.38s: deviations over time so when we're
4207.32s: talking about Delta it tells you the
4209.48s: rate of change in premium per dollar
4211.52s: move in the underlying it also can be
4214.88s: used to understand out of that the total
4217.82s: size that you have in that one contract
4220.16s: or if you have two contracts it doesn't
4221.54s: matter how many Lots you have
4223.52s: so but let's say if you have a one lot
4226.70s: it means you have a maximum exposure of
4230.06s: 100 shares in this scenario your
4233.06s: position is behaving like 50 shares and
4236.24s: again if you need to fact check that
4237.62s: that's why as underlying goes up by a
4240.74s: dollar you only move by 50 Cents or 50
4243.98s: again because you have to multiply it
4245.90s: out
4247.40s: it's because that's the number of
4249.56s: theoretical shares your position is
4251.18s: behaving as
4252.62s: then we have gamma gamma is a pretty
4255.80s: deep
4256.94s: it's a pretty deep Greek but I'm going
4258.92s: to keep it surface level for here gamma
4261.44s: is just the rate of change of Delta and
4265.64s: there's a couple things to know with
4267.44s: gamma
4268.58s: so if we look at options and right now
4272.72s: we're 17 March so 17 days out notice
4276.20s: Delta further out of the money you go
4278.30s: the lower the Delta at the money it's
4280.46s: going to be around a 50 Delta deep in
4282.38s: the money around a one Delta that's
4284.48s: going to be the same across every single
4286.28s: expiration no change now let's take a
4288.98s: look at Gamma
4290.24s: 17 days left to go notice a couple
4293.06s: things the first thing is the further in
4295.16s: the money you go low gamma then we start
4298.46s: getting closer to at the money higher
4301.34s: gamma then the further out of the money
4303.68s: you go lower gamma
4305.84s: that's an important understanding so
4308.30s: when we look at Gamma in terms of an
4311.48s: options money-ness if you are deep in
4314.36s: the money or deep out of the money
4317.12s: your gamma is going to be low with a
4320.06s: increasing gamma the closer you get at
4322.76s: the money
4323.90s: now let's take a look at some specific
4326.06s: values very quickly gamma for the at the
4329.12s: money options here is 0.02
4332.66s: let's go
4334.52s: something even closer in time one day
4336.74s: out
4337.76s: gamma here is 0.08
4341.36s: four times higher and it's essentially
4344.96s: two weeks closer a little more now if we
4347.60s: go further out in time 171 days gamma
4351.38s: for at the money is 0.01
4354.44s: 50 lower than where it was before so
4357.68s: what I'm showing you here is gamma
4359.98s: increases the closer you get to
4363.14s: expiration why does that happen well
4365.72s: remember
4367.22s: when I told you that options that are
4369.38s: out of the money are going to assimilate
4371.30s: to zero
4372.80s: so this means as we get closer to
4375.26s: expiration the option has to make a
4378.44s: choice if it's out of the money it's
4380.24s: going to go to zero if it's in the money
4381.80s: it's going to go to one so it's got to
4384.26s: have a corresponding gamma so that that
4386.96s: can happen in that amount of time
4389.78s: so there's other traits of gamma not
4392.84s: going to go into them here but just know
4394.22s: it's the rate of change of Delta then we
4396.32s: have Theta time Decay this is a really
4399.20s: important one so when we think about
4401.12s: time Decay there's two traits I want to
4404.00s: highlight the first one if we go to
4406.04s: Theta and we are at the money notice how
4409.88s: high it is so if I do something that's
4412.16s: seven days out beta for at the money is
4415.10s: 26 Cents if we're far out of the money
4418.16s: it's lower just 0.2 cents and if it's
4421.52s: far in the money it's super low either
4423.74s: zero meaning there's no extrinsic value
4425.84s: left essentially or there's it's very
4428.84s: low so like gamma if Theta is going to
4433.76s: be the highest for at the money options
4437.36s: and it's going to be lower for out of
4439.40s: the money options and lower for in the
4441.14s: money options
4442.22s: and then Theta in general is going to be
4445.16s: higher the further out in time you go
4447.74s: and it's because there's more time left
4450.32s: in those options however
4453.44s: Theta Decay which is what Theta is
4457.04s: actually measuring here it's not how
4458.66s: much time value is in the option it's
4460.10s: measuring the decay of Time Value so in
4463.40s: these instances Theta will be low and
4465.50s: it's because it has a long Runway so
4468.32s: each day these options are only going to
4470.78s: lose
4472.96s: 0.03 cents and notice how
4477.08s: the Theta is slightly different for
4479.36s: calls and puts that typically is going
4481.58s: to be based on the Delta so if you look
4483.86s: at a corresponding similar Delta this 42
4486.08s: Delta the Theta is 0.03 if you look at
4489.26s: this corresponding Delta the Theta is
4491.92s: 0.01 further out of the money options
4495.02s: are going to Decay much slower than
4497.78s: closer to the than closer to expiration
4502.04s: options or two options that are far out
4507.32s: or in the money
4509.00s: so if we go far out in time Theta is
4511.88s: going to Decay slower or if we go far in
4514.46s: or out of the money
4516.50s: then we have Vega which is the rate of
4519.68s: Premium change per one percent change in
4522.32s: volatility remember I was telling you
4524.06s: that volatility is a big input in an
4526.52s: options price so this tells us as
4528.98s: volatility changes over the life cycle
4530.90s: of an option
4532.40s: what is the premium rate of change how
4534.92s: much is the premium going to change
4536.06s: based on the movements and volatility
4537.38s: that's Vega and then row this is going
4539.48s: to be less applicable to most shorter
4541.28s: term options Traders within a year but
4543.44s: in a year like this or last year with a
4545.30s: lot of rate changes it's actually more
4546.74s: pertinent and this is how premium
4549.50s: changes or the value of an option
4551.90s: changes per change in the risk-free rate
4555.62s: so as the risk-free rate fluctuates the
4559.64s: premium of options especially longer
4562.16s: dated options will fluctuate a little
4564.14s: bit more that will be a little less
4565.58s: applicable to most people
4567.50s: all right
4568.88s: Where Do We Go From Here couple things I
4572.00s: think you should get options as a
4573.62s: Strategic investment I have no vested
4576.02s: affiliate link anything with this guy I
4578.78s: just really like his book it's what my
4580.28s: mentor turned me on to and I think it is
4583.22s: one of the best resources for options
4585.20s: Traders two you should join our free
4587.54s: Discord it's es invests the outlier
4590.66s: agogi you can find the link in the video
4592.70s: description below
4594.14s: now I think you should take a look at
4596.00s: some strategies
4597.32s: there's
4598.64s: a lot more detail that go into options
4601.04s: as you probably can imagine I literally
4602.84s: have been talking for an hour and 17
4604.52s: minutes straight about them and this is
4607.76s: scratching the surface I started trading
4610.28s: options in 2007. I've been doing this
4612.38s: for over 16 years I've spent probably 35
4617.12s: 000 hours on it now
4618.86s: I'm still learning that's not to
4620.90s: overwhelm you it's just to let you know
4622.70s: that there's a lot out there and you
4624.08s: should take a very pragmatic approach so
4627.20s: beyond going through the homework that I
4629.36s: shared throughout the video I think you
4631.52s: should start looking at some simple
4632.72s: strategies something like a ratio
4635.12s: covered call Link in the video
4637.10s: description below the covered strangle
4639.26s: same ratio diagonals also same
4642.80s: I think you should avoid if you're new
4645.74s: to trading options trading any sort of
4648.68s: real money for the foreseeable future if
4650.72s: I were you I would make a commitment to
4652.40s: yourself to not trade options for at
4654.32s: least six months sounds like a long time
4656.66s: but I promise you it's a drop in the
4658.88s: bucket and it takes time to pick them up
4660.80s: the worst thing you could do is try to
4663.32s: rush into them like we all do and most
4665.96s: people lose a ton of money
4667.72s: unnecessarily to learn stupid lessons
4670.94s: so I think you should start looking at
4673.52s: those strategies and then building out a
4675.86s: trading plan a trading log strategy
4679.04s: outlines all of that is in the video
4681.14s: description below but options are
4684.32s: fantastic products with a lot of
4686.42s: opportunities in them but they're
4688.40s: complex as you can see we just ran
4690.14s: through some of the basic traits of them
4691.88s: there's even relationships between the
4694.46s: Greeks when we talk about things like
4696.20s: that that's in a vacuum just by itself
4698.06s: but really things move more than that so
4700.88s: I hope this was useful please like share
4703.40s: subscribe if you made it to the end this
4704.96s: is a long video for me the longest one
4706.58s: I've ever made year to date and I'm
4709.04s: stoked with it though I'm hopeful that
4710.24s: it's useful to you guys and if there's
4711.44s: any questions that you have throw them
4712.88s: in the video description below or in the
4715.16s: comments below I've said video
4716.48s: description too many times so I'm just
4717.74s: repeating it but throw it in the
4719.12s: comments I'm happy to help where I can
4720.50s: but until next time be an outlier see
4723.26s: y'all later
