0.00s:  What's up everyone?
2.76s:  How is everybody doing out there?
5.84s:  What's going on to the outliers?
7.84s:  We have another options trading for beginners segment
13.00s:  on the docket for today.
16.20s:  So the goal for this session I have for us right now
21.32s:  is to take a much closer look at the end-to-end process
27.68s:  of building a trade.
28.88s:  So excuse me, we got a bunch of Celterwater.
32.32s:  Right now we're doing, what is this one?
35.56s:  Strawberry watermelon, this one's pretty good.
37.64s:  I like this one.
40.56s:  I guess I'm just on a watermelon vibe
42.16s:  because my backup one is just regular watermelon.
45.48s:  We go through Celterwater here pretty much perpetually.
50.84s:  Tons of it.
52.68s:  As for always, I'd say hello to who we have.
54.68s:  Hang in out.
55.52s:  I'm C. Jim Pollo, J. and Elon's songs.
58.40s:  Great to see all of you.
60.76s:  And let's do a quick overview of what this is going to look like.
64.24s:  So so far with this entire options trading segment
70.24s:  for beginners, we've gone through a lot of different things.
73.76s:  And I want to talk about the broad context first.
79.60s:  We're not going through this whole deck,
80.88s:  but I just want to talk to you about a couple pieces.
84.32s:  So here's the deal.
85.96s:  There's a bunch of things that go into trading options.
89.16s:  First, we need to understand the economy to a degree,
92.36s:  the stock market.
93.56s:  We need to understand how options behave,
97.52s:  the fundamentals behind options.
100.04s:  And then we have to start getting to a point
101.68s:  where we're pulling together this information
104.24s:  into a comprehensive, I guess deployment of them.
111.04s:  You have to pull a lot of things together
112.52s:  to make this whole thing work.
114.20s:  So the goal behind this is to spend a little bit of time
118.48s:  going through what that looks like,
120.84s:  what the actual process is to come up with an idea
126.96s:  and then to start trading it.
128.60s:  Because over the course of a trading career,
131.76s:  it very infrequently, some people,
134.12s:  they do hit these one-off wonders
136.04s:  that change their entire lives straight from the jump.
138.64s:  And then that's essentially what they're using
141.16s:  for their primary wealth going forward,
144.48s:  meaning essentially hitting the trading lottery
146.32s:  is what that's equivalent to.
148.36s:  But for most of us, it's not like that.
150.60s:  Most of us, it is a long process,
153.48s:  and for some of us, at least like me,
155.28s:  I want it to be a long process.
156.60s:  Not so much I'd love to have dozens of millions of dollars
161.00s:  right now.
162.32s:  That would be pretty sick.
163.92s:  But I think I also enjoy markets
167.16s:  in the process of trading.
168.52s:  It's very engaging and it's one of the coolest ways,
172.24s:  genuinely, that I have found to learn about the world around us.
177.52s:  So that is in a nutshell,
180.44s:  what I want to spend most of our time on today
183.24s:  is working through this broader context
187.00s:  of how to essentially build a trading plan
191.40s:  and how we can find ideas, build strategies.
195.40s:  So taking a quick step back from that, though,
199.04s:  with all of the stuff that we've talked about so far,
203.60s:  there's been a lot of details.
205.24s:  So I do want to offer an opportunity
208.28s:  if there are any specific questions
210.92s:  or if there's any specific topics
213.56s:  that we've covered up to this point
216.32s:  that you want to talk about.
218.08s:  And I am happy to start there, do a quick catch up.
223.12s:  And it looks like we had a couple more people
224.48s:  popping in, I see doku doku doki.
227.32s:  That's a fun name.
229.48s:  Pat Hader, Jim Reese,
232.88s:  Ruda Bega, bean gaming, that's a fun one.
236.92s:  Pat says not to be that guy,
238.16s:  but saw RKDFV type options by 719 Siri.
243.84s:  We could do that towards the end.
245.28s:  Yeah, I have no problem taking a peek at that,
248.00s:  but I want to keep the beginning session
250.76s:  a little more focused on the fundamentals.
254.00s:  I also think it's really difficult
256.40s:  to actually identify like the RK,
260.92s:  which is Rory and Kitty for those that don't know,
263.08s:  like his buying habits, right?
266.12s:  So it could be him, it could not be him,
267.60s:  I haven't looked at Siri at all.
268.72s:  I have no idea at this point.
269.84s:  I looked at it last weekend,
271.40s:  but happy to either take a look at it later today
275.88s:  and see what we can maybe piece together.
280.56s:  Ben Waz here, fly high and enjoy, that's a fun one.
284.12s:  And then Jaden, sweep.
285.72s:  All right, so I'm not seeing a bunch of catch up questions.
288.92s:  So I think that that means that we can get more into,
292.16s:  ah, there we go, Reese, perfect timing.
295.16s:  Daniel, good to see you as well.
296.68s:  Reese says how important is margin?
298.52s:  It's a great question.
300.44s:  And in terms of importance,
304.16s:  margin is what I would consider to be a force multiplier.
309.16s:  So Reese, what you're talking about there,
311.80s:  there's two different things.
313.64s:  There's trading with margin, trading on margin.
317.36s:  However you want to phrase it,
318.68s:  there's kind of different utilization of margin.
322.84s:  And options utilize a specific type
326.80s:  where we're not actually borrowing money.
330.72s:  So let's take a look at an example.
333.96s:  If we take a look, maybe at spy.
339.76s:  And we take a look at the options in spy.
344.52s:  Here is a nutshell of trading with margin.
351.92s:  If I want to open and let's say I want to sell a put,
359.00s:  it's a cash secured put.
360.68s:  So if you don't remember,
362.88s:  a cash secured put is where you sell a put option.
367.40s:  And you're putting up the capital
370.16s:  to cover the options position.
372.28s:  So in this case, that means that you would have to buy 100 shares of spy at $5.52.
380.96s:  So if you're to cash secure the position, it's $55,200.
387.44s:  That's if you want to essentially cash the position.
390.76s:  Now, if I go to actually put this trade on,
394.20s:  and again, this is in a pass through account for me.
396.72s:  So I don't have any positions on in here.
398.76s:  But I think this one is standard margin.
401.88s:  If I'm not mistaken, we'll see.
405.20s:  If we sell a put, let's see what this asks of me.
410.12s:  Just this.
412.68s:  Yeah, so this is for this is a pass through retirement account.
415.52s:  So the margin required here essentially is full margin.
419.72s:  It wants, so this isn't using really any leverage at all.
425.56s:  That's like an example of a cash secure put.
427.32s:  Now, if we go on on demand really fast, and we look at spy,
430.68s:  yeah, this is a great example.
431.84s:  Let me get me out of the way.
434.08s:  I'll go top right.
436.00s:  And if you take a look at the margin required for this trade now,
440.24s:  that we are outside of a retirement account,
443.36s:  which requires essentially posting the full trading capital
447.96s:  for the position in that example,
450.32s:  you'll notice that the margin requirement for the position
452.20s:  is only $16,800.
455.16s:  So what that means is the broker is saying,
459.56s:  this position, it knows what this position is worth
462.76s:  in its entirety.
463.60s:  The broker knows the reason why it's moving,
465.88s:  by the way, is because this is on demand.
467.40s:  I don't want you guys thinking something squarely
469.04s:  is going on after hours.
470.60s:  It's not.
471.84s:  But so what this is saying is in this example now,
475.72s:  the broker requires $17,300.
478.92s:  So even though this position is controlling $55,000 of spy,
484.88s:  the broker is only asking for $17,300.
489.08s:  So you're not actually borrowing any money from the broker
492.36s:  and you very well might have the $55,000 to cash
496.24s:  secure this position.
498.16s:  But in this world of trading options,
501.12s:  you're not borrowing money.
503.56s:  Your broker is just not requiring you to set aside
508.28s:  the maximum value of a position.
510.80s:  They're asking for what we would call a margin requirement,
513.60s:  which is just a smaller subset of the total value
516.76s:  of that position.
517.72s:  And once that's satisfied, then the broker is chill.
520.96s:  They have what they need to cover their risk.
523.60s:  It's important to know that margin moves.
526.08s:  So as the market goes up and goes down,
530.20s:  as the broker perceives their risk moving,
533.96s:  your margin requirement will also change.
536.80s:  It's not a static figure.
539.24s:  So margin is important for a few reasons.
542.72s:  It's the primary modality that leverage
547.16s:  is afforded to you in options.
550.64s:  So let's give another example not using puts now.
554.84s:  And let's take a look at calls.
557.28s:  So in this example, if I wanted to buy these calls here,
562.32s:  the $551, I just picked a random one.
565.28s:  Right now, these are at a $70.
567.36s:  So if you'll remember, every single options contract
570.52s:  moves in 100 share lots.
574.28s:  So this is a one lot, and it comprises up to 100 shares.
579.04s:  Essentially, with this being a $70 delta,
583.16s:  that means that this position currently
585.32s:  is behaving similarly to $70 shares of spy.
591.32s:  So if we were to buy $70 shares at,
594.12s:  let's just use the strike price, for example,
596.48s:  which in this case is $551 times 70,
602.68s:  $38,570 bucks.
604.80s:  That's what it would cost.
606.28s:  If you were to buy the share equivalent of this position,
609.16s:  you have to put up $38,570.
613.00s:  However, if you were to buy the option,
616.68s:  it costs $1,531.
621.56s:  So again, you're not borrowing money here,
624.12s:  but this is the leverage afforded to you through options.
629.12s:  So there's a difference to recap
631.92s:  between trading on margin or trading with margin.
637.24s:  When you are on margin, you are borrowing money actively,
640.84s:  and you have to pay a rate to borrow the money.
643.88s:  If you're trading with margin,
645.28s:  which all options positions do,
648.44s:  in that instance, you're essentially benefiting
652.04s:  from the leverage provided to you,
653.76s:  but you're not actually borrowing any money.
657.12s:  Reese says, if you don't have cash in your account,
660.08s:  can you specify you want to sell a cash secured put
663.40s:  and unmargin' and not cash secured?
666.00s:  If you do have the cash, it's a great question.
669.00s:  So Reese, the follow up to your question
670.92s:  and for anybody else wondering what we're talking about now,
673.84s:  Reese is asking, can you tell your broker
676.84s:  if you want to sell your cash secured put on margin
679.68s:  and not cash secured?
681.08s:  The broker is going to default to unmargin.
684.60s:  So if I have a marginable account,
687.12s:  again, this is a pass through IRA,
689.68s:  so it automatically requires full cash secured.
692.24s:  So if I go into on demand and we look at this position,
698.48s:  what day are we?
699.32s:  I'm actually just curious what this is.
700.48s:  Oh, this is looking at the first of July, this month, cool.
704.12s:  I don't know why I find that cool, but I do.
706.04s:  So if we're to look at this fake trade,
708.92s:  the, let me, might still out of the way,
712.88s:  yeah, okay, I'm still top right good.
714.68s:  So if we're a little look at this fake trade,
717.20s:  the margin requirement to put this trade on is $15,477.
724.68s:  That's the default.
726.08s:  So if you have a marginable account,
728.68s:  the broker, depending on the permissions you have,
731.96s:  I should clarify, because there's different levels
733.72s:  of options permissions.
735.48s:  So if you have like the highest tier,
740.88s:  I honestly don't even know what they go up to anymore
744.20s:  or what those actually look like,
745.68s:  and I just realized this is like now.
750.80s:  One second.
751.64s:  I just realized this thing like totally cut my head off.
773.52s:  There we go.
774.72s:  There we go.
776.52s:  I think we're getting back at it, team.
780.28s:  I think we're getting back at it.
783.92s:  All right.
785.76s:  How did the back of the computer look like by the way?
788.64s:  I had to like reroute the cable really fast.
792.84s:  Back to the question though,
795.76s:  the broker will automatically essentially just use the
801.00s:  margin requirement for the position.
803.84s:  They do not care if you want to cash secure it,
807.36s:  you would have to notify them yourself
811.08s:  that you want to cash secure the position.
814.36s:  That's essentially how it would work.
817.00s:  So the beautiful part about that is the broker
820.12s:  is automatically giving you the benefit of the doubt.
823.48s:  The negative side to that is then you have to have good
827.04s:  accounting if you're looking to track cash secured
829.96s:  positions versus non.
832.16s:  The broker doesn't do that for you automatically.
836.48s:  So Reese, let me know if that answers your question.
841.28s:  Ruda Bega says,
843.64s:  how do you tell if an option is currently cheaper,
845.48s:  expensive to buy?
846.28s:  That's another great question.
847.92s:  So for this one,
849.44s:  there's a couple different assessments you can use
852.08s:  in terms of determining if an option is cheaper,
855.00s:  expensive, there's one primary input we care about,
857.52s:  which is volatility.
859.52s:  So there's a couple of things you can do to look at that.
862.48s:  So let's take a look at,
864.64s:  let's find a random stock,
868.12s:  something that we don't know much about.
869.68s:  I'm just gonna go into this scan and pick something.
873.92s:  Walmart, most of us know about Walmart.
878.04s:  I don't really know what's going on in here.
879.36s:  We'll get a sense of it.
881.16s:  And let me zoom us out to like a six-month daily,
884.44s:  something like that.
886.48s:  And,
890.00s:  Reese says, thanks so much,
891.28s:  Margin's son of like running up a credit card
893.28s:  and as a fellow poor kid,
894.56s:  always seemed like a trap to me.
895.48s:  It's actually hilarious, you say that,
898.12s:  because I always struggled massively
902.32s:  with the concept of borrowing money
906.32s:  from a broker to put on more trades,
908.24s:  like that kind of leverage terrified me.
910.84s:  So I essentially would very rarely,
914.08s:  very rarely use Margin.
916.80s:  It's, I totally identify with you.
920.32s:  Rudebega, back to your question.
923.00s:  So let's figure out if these options are expensive or not.
927.84s:  What do you guys think the first thing
929.68s:  I'm gonna look at now on the platform?
932.56s:  You guys have any ideas?
935.00s:  There's a couple things that I will look for.
939.28s:  And the goal is to figure out how expensive these options are.
946.84s:  So what can we do to figure that out?
949.16s:  We can start with a broad assessment,
952.24s:  which is what we're gonna start with.
954.16s:  And then we can get more into specifics.
957.08s:  Pat says, oh, I, it's a great idea,
959.48s:  but that's not correct.
960.96s:  Oh, I, which is an option's open interest,
963.56s:  that's not actually gonna tell us
965.56s:  if something is expensive or not.
969.08s:  Benoit and Reese are on it as well as Eddie.
973.08s:  Both of those groups are on it.
976.48s:  So you guys are right on top of it.
979.80s:  Peter says implied volatility, which is good.
985.92s:  What a hell of a name.
988.24s:  I am now the biggest fan of this new name,
991.60s:  which is overmoicin' meatloaf.
994.96s:  It's fantastic.
997.04s:  Is the golden shower crossover?
999.56s:  No, that, you know, I tell you what,
1001.20s:  that sounds like a hell of a crossover though,
1002.96s:  but that sounds also like a crossover between trading
1006.96s:  and some other endeavors.
1009.32s:  But no, it's not that either.
1011.44s:  So we have a couple ideas stemming from implied volatility,
1014.48s:  which is perfect.
1015.40s:  Benoit is on it, Reese is on it, Eddie is on it.
1018.88s:  Those are all correct answers.
1021.44s:  So Reese is saying versus HV,
1023.92s:  I would delete that part Reese
1025.80s:  because that doesn't help you.
1028.12s:  The first answer of IV is much closer to being correct.
1030.96s:  So let's take a look at it.
1032.76s:  If we go back to our options pricing model,
1037.40s:  I started building this deck for you guys,
1041.20s:  which is funny because I never use slides.
1044.12s:  I don't like them very much,
1045.36s:  especially for my time as a consultant with Deloitte.
1048.44s:  I don't really like to spend a lot of time in them,
1051.28s:  but this thing is starting to become a bear.
1054.28s:  I'm using it to kind of have all of the stuff
1056.44s:  we need in one single spot.
1058.88s:  So anyways, if we go back somewhere in here,
1061.56s:  we have pricing models here.
1066.48s:  So when we look at an option pricing model,
1070.16s:  and let me maybe make this bold, maybe underlines,
1074.16s:  what's a little easier to see,
1076.16s:  there's a very important input,
1078.24s:  which you could tell I have highlighted,
1079.84s:  which is volatility,
1081.56s:  because all of these things are kind of known
1083.84s:  and they're relative to the underlying at a point in time.
1086.88s:  If we're assessing, if an option is expensive,
1089.72s:  this is what we care about, volatility.
1092.24s:  This is the primary input that will change
1095.80s:  beyond other kind of known standard effects,
1099.88s:  how relatively expensive an option is.
1103.96s:  So if we move this over here,
1107.80s:  and let's take a look first at the implied volatility.
1111.64s:  So for Walmart, the implied volatility is up here,
1114.96s:  26.24%.
1118.48s:  Is that expensive?
1120.08s:  Is it cheap?
1122.92s:  We don't really know.
1124.20s:  That's why I frame it that way.
1126.40s:  It's just a number.
1128.24s:  Implied volatility in this sense
1130.12s:  is just telling us the expectation of price movement.
1134.20s:  That's all.
1135.24s:  So we can't really tell,
1136.72s:  we can't decipher from this.
1138.92s:  If that means that the options are cheaper expensive,
1142.16s:  we don't know yet.
1143.80s:  What we can use is something like
1146.40s:  implied volatility percentile
1148.52s:  or implied volatility rank.
1150.60s:  I much prefer implied volatility percentile.
1154.28s:  It is much less prone to skew.
1158.40s:  And I think that that matters.
1160.56s:  So going off of that thread,
1162.52s:  and I think in here actually,
1164.08s:  if I'm not mistaken,
1164.92s:  we have something in here about implied volatility percentile.
1169.20s:  Valtuity.
1170.20s:  Yeah, here we go.
1172.28s:  Oh, look at, see, I told you,
1173.72s:  this thing is becoming like the ultimate reference guide
1176.92s:  for most things.
1178.80s:  So here, I'm showing you the difference
1181.12s:  between implied volatility percentile calculation
1183.68s:  and implied volatility rank.
1186.16s:  The problem with implied volatility rank
1188.84s:  is based on the way that it's calculated.
1191.48s:  It is very prone to remaining skewed
1194.24s:  when there's a really large move.
1196.48s:  IV percentile is much less prone to skew.
1201.64s:  Because what we're doing is we're taking the current
1204.60s:  implied volatility and we're seeing
1208.08s:  how high it is relative to a reference timeframe.
1214.52s:  And as you guys always know,
1216.20s:  I dime out any time YouTube wants me to insert an ad
1222.84s:  to which we say,
1224.20s:  nay, we do not insert ads for YouTube.
1227.72s:  They probably have not a big fan
1228.96s:  because I'm not making them as much money,
1230.20s:  but whatever.
1232.44s:  I think ad here would also be annoying.
1234.40s:  It is funny though, like it literally does this giant pop up
1237.56s:  and it asks you like a million times when you're doing these.
1240.68s:  It's always like, do you want us to insert the ads free?
1242.76s:  Do you want us to insert the ads free?
1244.00s:  It's I bet they would like to insert the ads for us.
1251.92s:  So to recap so far, we can start with implied volatility.
1256.08s:  Things with high implied volatility
1258.52s:  will tend to be more expensive.
1260.60s:  Even on a,
1264.52s:  on like a broad basis,
1266.12s:  Benoit says there's gotta be an extension to auto dismissals.
1268.80s:  I bet the problem with that extension though
1270.88s:  is it probably also tracks every single personal detail
1274.80s:  that I have, which is not worth me not,
1278.40s:  at least making a small comment about the thing
1281.52s:  when it pops up.
1283.64s:  Manscape Goat says,
1286.56s:  Wait, what's the flavor of the day?
1290.52s:  Oh, right now we're drinking,
1294.16s:  this is actually my wife's preferred one so far.
1297.44s:  We have a straw, I don't know why that would be difficult
1302.04s:  for the camera to see.
1303.88s:  This one is strawberry watermelon
1306.32s:  and then our backup for today is standard watermelon.
1310.68s:  This guy,
1312.44s:  the standard watermelon is admittedly my favorite,
1315.68s:  but this strawberry watermelon is pretty good.
1319.48s:  Still a fan.
1323.92s:  Overmoistened meatloaf,
1325.24s:  this is the hottest stream I've ever seen.
1326.92s:  That's awesome.
1328.12s:  Well, I'm really, really glad overmoistened meatloaf
1332.56s:  that this is really getting your juices flowing
1334.92s:  because I tell you what,
1335.76s:  anybody that gets stoked about options like to that,
1339.92s:  you're my kind of person to be honest
1342.16s:  because this is, yeah,
1344.48s:  I mean, this is, this is my deal.
1346.64s:  This is what I do.
1347.64s:  So any chance to talk about options with somebody else
1350.04s:  that even potentially gets turned on by them,
1353.00s:  I'm here for it.
1354.68s:  So back to this implied volatility on a gross level,
1359.24s:  if it's high, the options are gonna be more expensive.
1361.52s:  So if IV in this thing is let's say 15%
1369.04s:  then if that's compared to something with IV
1372.84s:  that is 54%,
1374.68s:  the 54% IV options are absolutely going to be more expensive.
1381.36s:  Now, when you're comparing within an individual product,
1385.92s:  so in this case, we're looking at Tesla,
1389.52s:  if we compare the price of Tesla relative to itself,
1394.68s:  this means that the implied volatility percentile
1397.52s:  gives us that metric and it lets us know how expensive
1401.32s:  IV is relative to just Tesla.
1404.44s:  And in this case, the options would be relatively expensive
1407.96s:  in general.
1408.96s:  We're still in the macro view, the higher level view.
1414.12s:  So quick recap.
1416.72s:  If IV is high, in general, as a gross figure,
1420.36s:  cross products options become more expensive.
1423.40s:  Implied volatility percentile gives us
1426.28s:  a relative understanding of a product's IV relative
1430.48s:  to itself.
1431.80s:  If implied volatility percentile is high,
1434.40s:  then its options are correspondingly going to be more expensive.
1439.88s:  That's the macro level view.
1443.32s:  Now to get into the micro level view,
1448.16s:  I guess we'll just use Tesla to keep the example going.
1451.24s:  Wow, and it's even better now.
1452.52s:  Check this out.
1453.36s:  IVP is 98%.
1455.92s:  This is actually kind of a cool example.
1457.32s:  Let's bring this back over real fast.
1460.16s:  So in this timeframe when I looked at it,
1464.00s:  IV was 54% with IVP of 58%.
1468.64s:  Now it's 68.4% with IVP of 98%.
1473.40s:  So now options are really expensive on a relative basis.
1478.32s:  Interesting.
1479.52s:  So if we come in here,
1483.60s:  and we take a look at the options,
1488.28s:  let's go first at the expiration cycles.
1492.48s:  So this is, and if you've been watching any
1495.00s:  of the GME videos I've been doing,
1496.60s:  which again, even if you're not necessarily super
1499.72s:  into the GME story as I am, obviously,
1503.00s:  there's still a lot of really good information
1505.56s:  about options, analysis, and general in there.
1508.36s:  So I recommend that you check them out.
1509.72s:  They're not that long.
1510.56s:  It's like 10 minutes and I'm launching
1511.84s:  almost one a day at this rate.
1513.72s:  But one of the things you've seen me look at
1515.80s:  in a lot of them is this.
1518.08s:  This is the implied volatility
1520.40s:  for each expiration cycle.
1524.56s:  So we can see, for example,
1526.64s:  that this 12 July, which was today,
1529.44s:  had 81.66% vol.
1532.20s:  The expiration cycle for 19 July is down to 63.62%,
1537.68s:  but then the next expiration cycle is back up
1540.48s:  to 83.55.
1542.92s:  So what can we infer from here,
1547.12s:  that these options, this chain on a relative basis
1551.72s:  to the product, and specifically to these other options
1555.12s:  chains is cheaper.
1557.52s:  So this is another click down on assessing
1561.72s:  the expansiveness of an option.
1564.52s:  So we now know the macro picture
1566.44s:  from the underlying itself.
1568.24s:  We now know based on expiration cycles
1570.68s:  where I can find cheaper options.
1573.48s:  So in this case, we see these options out here
1576.88s:  are 60.09%.
1578.72s:  They're relatively cheap.
1580.00s:  I think I clicked the, yeah, I got the right one.
1582.20s:  So now there's one final layer we can click into,
1586.20s:  which is the individual option.
1588.72s:  You can find where options are relatively cheap
1592.52s:  or more expensive.
1594.44s:  Now what you'll find first is typically speaking,
1598.16s:  the IV will expand as you go further out and in the money.
1603.44s:  So generally speaking, there will be cheaper volatility
1607.44s:  at the money.
1609.44s:  So with this, you can look for slight anomalies
1613.92s:  and see if there's a period where you can go a little further
1617.72s:  out in time and actually find cheaper IV, like this one right here.
1621.36s:  So as I look at this 25 delta put, notice how the volatility
1626.60s:  leading into that put, I see 56 and a quarter
1630.68s:  of 56.21 and then 56.18 and then it bounces back up
1637.44s:  to 56.32%.
1639.48s:  So these are relatively cheap in this product
1643.28s:  where the expiration cycle writ large is looking at 60% vol,
1647.24s:  you can find 56, I'm sorry, 60% vol,
1651.36s:  you can find 56.18% vol.
1655.28s:  So this is where volatility is cheaper.
1658.56s:  So a bit of a long answer,
1662.40s:  but I wanted to give you guys a bunch of different ways
1665.56s:  of looking at this.
1667.28s:  So let me see.
1672.48s:  Reese says seems odd to have less vol and longer dated
1675.24s:  expiration, the high IV of September should appear in October.
1679.40s:  No, not necessarily.
1680.92s:  It's all based on expectations.
1683.36s:  The other tool that you have is this.
1685.44s:  And we can look at the implied volatility
1688.20s:  for either the average of the options.
1692.24s:  Let me get rid of this near term expiration
1693.84s:  because it's skewing everything.
1695.52s:  And all these crazy lines being all kinked like this
1698.20s:  is actually that's a ton of trading opportunities
1700.40s:  from a Vol trader's perspective, especially this blue one.
1702.60s:  That 19 July, that's nuts.
1705.08s:  If you guys heard a 19 July, that's super tradable.
1708.20s:  All that's super tradable.
1709.48s:  There's relative values there,
1710.76s:  but I don't want to get too far in the weeds there.
1712.84s:  I just caught my eye.
1714.80s:  So you can look at the relative cheapness
1717.60s:  or expansiveness of maybe out the money options
1720.16s:  versus in the money options.
1721.36s:  You can look at relative pricing.
1723.52s:  But this is more for a different style of trading.
1725.60s:  I just want you to know it exists.
1727.60s:  But what you're looking here is a volatility surface.
1730.00s:  It's not as pretty as the 3D models,
1732.72s:  but it gives you the same information.
1735.24s:  And like seeing things that include crossovers,
1738.72s:  like this 19 July to 26 July, I can see that pretty clear as day.
1743.24s:  So if I clear everything out and just show you those,
1745.04s:  this right here, that's a tradable event.
1747.32s:  This entire thing is a tradable event.
1750.84s:  So there's a lot of different opportunities
1753.00s:  with trading vol directly,
1755.92s:  but that's not what your question was.
1758.64s:  It was more about the expansiveness of options.
1762.80s:  So give me a random ticker,
1765.88s:  and then I will run through this whole process
1768.36s:  because I know that that seems like a lot,
1770.72s:  but it takes less than two minutes.
1773.28s:  So if you give me a random ticker,
1774.88s:  something not that we look at all the time,
1777.96s:  I will pull it up and then I will assess
1780.48s:  the options for you real time.
1785.12s:  SMCI game.
1787.96s:  Let's take a look at SMCI.
1790.28s:  SMCI.
1791.24s:  All right, so the first thing I notice is
1793.12s:  we are trending sideways.
1795.72s:  So the reason why that matters to me
1797.32s:  is because if we have big drops in price,
1800.36s:  I inherently know volatility tends to be higher.
1803.72s:  So I scout's honor,
1805.88s:  I haven't looked at the top corner yet,
1808.20s:  but when I look at this,
1809.48s:  I see something that went through a drop
1811.92s:  and has been trending sideways.
1813.80s:  So I would expect volatility to be low,
1816.92s:  however it is earnings coming up.
1819.76s:  So my expectation of vol in that case
1822.48s:  would be actually much higher.
1824.80s:  So IVP 71%, so that doesn't surprise me.
1830.52s:  So what I'm doing is quickly using the chart
1832.56s:  to get a sense of how price is moving
1834.36s:  that will inform a little bit of where
1838.20s:  how volatile or how expensive options can be.
1842.12s:  Now I looked at IVP.
1844.60s:  The other thing I notice is IV and this is 88%.
1847.20s:  On a gross amount that is a relatively high number.
1852.44s:  If I give you a comparison really quick, like GE, 38%.
1857.80s:  And look at this,
1859.56s:  the IV and GE is 38%,
1861.80s:  the IV percentile is 97%.
1865.36s:  So what this is telling you in GE,
1867.48s:  even though IV is only 38,
1869.64s:  that's crazy expensive for what this is on a relative basis.
1873.64s:  Okay, so back to SMCI.
1875.68s:  First thing, price down tells me vol typically a little bit higher.
1879.56s:  Trending sideways would tell me vol probably contracting.
1883.32s:  Earnings coming up, tells me vol probably higher.
1886.28s:  Now I can skip all of that.
1888.24s:  I'm just walking through my actual thought process out loud.
1892.20s:  Now I look at IV, 88% gross number is high,
1895.80s:  tells me expensive.
1897.60s:  IVP 71%, tells me expensive.
1902.48s:  Go into the options chain.
1904.64s:  I look at the expiration cycles.
1907.16s:  I see front is cheap.
1909.16s:  The next two cycles expensive, slightly cheaper,
1912.32s:  more expensive all the way out until we get about here.
1916.04s:  And I notice this is actually a slight anomaly.
1919.64s:  These options in this expiration cycle being this low,
1923.64s:  relative to the others, same with the 68%.
1926.68s:  These tell me these two on a relative basis are quite cheap.
1931.16s:  So if I wanted to buy options,
1934.52s:  I might look at something a little further out,
1936.44s:  and then you have to go into liquidity and all that shit.
1938.72s:  But I'm just letting you know from IV perspective,
1943.40s:  I can see what's expensive versus what's not.
1945.44s:  Like this in here is expensive.
1947.40s:  It's essentially the top end of the options chain.
1951.20s:  So depending on what kind of trade I'm looking to put on,
1954.16s:  I either might want them to be expensive
1956.20s:  or I might want them to be cheap.
1957.80s:  Depending on what scenario I would either go there or here.
1961.36s:  So now going out here to the 20 December,
1965.08s:  and a quick assessment of the options,
1968.96s:  I see that there's actually very, very slight call skew
1974.24s:  in terms of vol.
1976.16s:  So when I look at these,
1977.96s:  and it's also because of delta actually,
1980.36s:  so let me redact that and look at seem to seem comparison.
1984.44s:  75, yes, still there.
1986.68s:  So what I'm doing now is I'm comparing the same delta options.
1990.28s:  I see a 31 delta put here,
1993.04s:  and I see a 31 delta call way out here.
1996.60s:  The 31 delta call has 75.6% vol.
2002.20s:  The 31 delta put has 72.99%.
2006.00s:  Very often you'll see the inverse.
2008.48s:  The market tends to price in the downside
2011.84s:  way more heavily than the upside,
2013.52s:  but when you're looking at individual tickers like this,
2015.88s:  or even if you've been following
2017.12s:  what I've been looking at with GameStop,
2019.00s:  they tend to be skewed actually quite a lot.
2022.72s:  So if I now have a pretty comprehensive picture
2027.56s:  of how expensive volatility is.
2030.88s:  So let me know specifically,
2033.04s:  I think Reese, that was originally your question.
2037.20s:  Let me know if that answers your question.
2038.96s:  I hope that going through that exercise
2041.36s:  is useful for you.
2043.88s:  Let me take a quick look at some of these other questions.
2047.40s:  And then by the way, if you drop a question further up
2049.92s:  and I miss it, don't feel for, don't be bashful.
2052.76s:  Drop it back in.
2053.72s:  I kind of just try to keep up with what's flowing through
2057.08s:  so that I'm not flipping all the way up
2058.84s:  because it takes time.
2060.20s:  But Mr. Squishmello, AMC Squishmello,
2064.56s:  that's a hilarious name.
2066.08s:  How do you identify the delta of a contract
2068.52s:  when you are swapping only fans pages in the open up market?
2073.80s:  That confused me.
2075.68s:  But I would probably direct most of your attention
2078.28s:  to the only fans pages and not worry so much
2081.24s:  about the delta.
2083.84s:  That would be my guess.
2087.44s:  Ben Wallace says, what is expensive really mean here?
2089.52s:  Premium paid per delta?
2090.76s:  You could look at it that way.
2092.40s:  It essentially just means how expensive the balls are.
2095.72s:  Like that's at the end of the day
2097.12s:  when you're trading options, you're trading ball
2099.20s:  to some degree or to another.
2101.08s:  That's really, you're seeing how expensive the ball is
2104.24s:  that you're transacting at.
2107.64s:  That's the easiest way to think about it.
2111.72s:  Carlos says, what platform?
2112.72s:  This is Thinkors Swim.
2113.72s:  I still find that so novel that so many people
2117.08s:  aren't really used to looking at Thinkors Swim.
2119.48s:  It's fascinating to me.
2120.76s:  It's not a dig at anybody.
2122.32s:  It's just because obviously it's telling me
2124.32s:  that I'm becoming an old head at my right page of 33
2127.60s:  because when I look at like primary trading platforms,
2130.36s:  this is so popular, but I guess most people
2132.48s:  are used to using stuff like Robinhood now in Wee Bowl.
2135.68s:  Very interesting.
2141.44s:  Ben Wallace says, so the price per expected tick change,
2144.52s:  I wouldn't even think of it as in terms of expected tick change.
2147.48s:  It's okay to look at that, right?
2148.48s:  Because that's what Delta's telling you.
2150.20s:  It's literally just telling you how expensive the balls are
2152.76s:  that you're trading.
2153.72s:  That's essentially it.
2155.76s:  Rolando says, but if you do a little TA,
2157.48s:  you can see that a chart is really looking,
2159.04s:  oh, I think I missed, oh, I have to go back up.
2162.52s:  Rolando says, I have a question.
2164.72s:  Why did you sell your options today?
2166.32s:  I understand your strategy is more conservative
2168.00s:  and you swing trading.
2170.96s:  But if you do a little TA,
2171.80s:  you can see the chart is looking really good for next week.
2173.96s:  Mac, D cross.
2175.48s:  Yeah, so a couple of things.
2179.36s:  And he's referring to the GME trade.
2182.20s:  I still have a position on, as I said,
2183.92s:  like I still have right now.
2188.12s:  I still have long shares and I do have options in it still.
2192.72s:  I just wasn't able to establish the position I wanted out here
2196.80s:  in 18 October.
2198.36s:  I have exposure now in 20 September.
2201.20s:  So the only thing I did was take in my 16 augs
2204.68s:  and the reason for that is because they're starting
2208.04s:  to get to a point where on a relative basis
2211.12s:  on the remaining value of the options,
2214.44s:  it's going to decay much faster.
2217.08s:  So it means that I need bigger moves in order for this
2220.56s:  to stay essentially where I want.
2223.16s:  So I had a pretty decent price accommodation
2227.32s:  from where I entered the trade.
2229.64s:  It's for me, like I said in the video,
2232.28s:  like I'm a trader, right?
2233.84s:  And my job is to make money.
2236.16s:  So I look at something that is made money.
2238.56s:  It's slowing down, it's up move.
2241.16s:  And I do have kind of the rest of the exposure
2244.92s:  that I want at the time.
2246.60s:  So yeah, that's literally exactly why.
2249.32s:  What you don't want to do with options is wait too long,
2252.16s:  especially if you're buying them.
2254.12s:  If you're buying options, it's really, really difficult
2258.28s:  to strike a balance in terms of an expected return,
2262.08s:  which we can talk about that a little bit.
2265.32s:  But it's important to remember that you literally
2269.12s:  are holding a decaying asset, right?
2271.84s:  It's something that's disappearing in your hands.
2274.88s:  And if you hold on to it for too long,
2277.28s:  you lose a decent amount of the value.
2279.72s:  Even though I tend to go in the money,
2282.24s:  there's still extrinsic value in those options
2284.64s:  that's decaying away.
2286.36s:  So for example, if we go out here to the 20 steps,
2290.64s:  you can see that even really high delta options,
2294.92s:  let's use something like this, the 20s,
2298.04s:  they're, you know, bid 730 offered at eight.
2301.64s:  But of that, you know, whatever,
2304.72s:  seven and a half or three,
2307.64s:  I don't know where you would get filled in here.
2309.20s:  I noticed that the markets tend to be pretty liquid,
2312.24s:  meaning you're not going to get hit at the mid,
2315.84s:  especially if you're buying.
2316.80s:  You're probably going to be a little more offer heavy.
2319.12s:  That's what I've noticed at least.
2320.84s:  And in that, if I'm looking to gain exposure to GameStop
2325.76s:  and I'm buying calls,
2327.60s:  let's say I take them in for seven 80, something like that.
2333.16s:  And of that seven 80, at least a dollar 20 or so
2340.80s:  is extrinsic value that's going,
2343.16s:  that's bleeding out of the position.
2345.44s:  So that means as time is passing,
2348.84s:  this is slowly coming out of my,
2350.76s:  that's adding drag to my returns.
2353.72s:  So that means I need GameStop to move more
2356.92s:  to compensate for what I'm losing on Theta2K.
2360.68s:  That starts to accelerate as you're closer in time.
2364.60s:  I actually have neat little, again, I told you,
2368.24s:  like this thing is becoming like the,
2371.36s:  everything reference.
2372.88s:  What that is showing you though is this,
2376.36s:  as we start getting within 60 days on a relative basis,
2380.24s:  Theta2K really accelerates as extrinsic value
2384.00s:  approximates to zero as we get nearer the expiration.
2388.88s:  So that is in a nutshell why I adjusted the position I did.
2394.08s:  So if there's any follow on questions to that, let me know.
2399.60s:  Bryce asked, have a question about GME options.
2401.92s:  So let's say the market has a huge squeeze to the upside next week
2405.32s:  and the option is for October,
2407.56s:  wouldn't this create difficulty for selling since it's far out?
2409.96s:  Nope, a couple of things.
2412.00s:  The first thing is if we,
2414.28s:  there's some sort of like really big move,
2417.48s:  all options will become slightly less liquid.
2420.80s:  So volatility is lifeblood.
2423.40s:  You need volatility.
2425.52s:  Volatility is what brings people in to even create
2429.00s:  a baseline liquidity.
2430.96s:  But if volatility expands a lot,
2434.36s:  let's say based on really big moves in GameStop,
2437.84s:  if that happens,
2439.04s:  volatility will, the market makers are going to widen the markets.
2443.12s:  And this is largely to protect themselves.
2445.92s:  Otherwise, they can get ran over.
2447.36s:  I know a lot of people want to look at the market makers
2449.56s:  and make the amount to be the bad guy.
2451.68s:  And I'm not saying that they're all angels.
2453.24s:  They definitely have their motivations.
2455.52s:  But they still have pretty difficult periods
2459.48s:  to manage risk, especially in like really hyperbolic markets.
2464.32s:  So if vol starts skyrocketing,
2468.52s:  whether because the market is flying up
2470.52s:  or the market's crashing down,
2472.72s:  the market makers are going to widen those bit-ask spreads
2476.12s:  and everything will become wide.
2478.64s:  Now to your point,
2480.56s:  if you go further out in time,
2482.76s:  it naturally is less liquid.
2485.28s:  So if we look at these seven-day options,
2487.08s:  let's find us a 80-dalta-ish.
2489.52s:  I see them here at the 24s,
2491.88s:  and I see them bid 244 offered 260.
2496.24s:  If I go out here to the same 81-dalta-ish,
2500.56s:  this is an 80-dalta,
2502.28s:  their bid 795 offered at a 20.
2506.04s:  That's actually really,
2507.00s:  that's tight on a relative basis.
2509.20s:  So this actually looks pretty good now.
2511.84s:  But the further out in time you go,
2514.92s:  the wider those markets tend to get.
2517.92s:  So this is another great example.
2519.56s:  If we go out now to the 20 June's,
2521.96s:  you'll see that the 79-dalta closes to 81 that we have.
2525.92s:  Bid 1040 offered 1175.
2529.84s:  So you will fight some level of liquidity
2533.76s:  to answer a braces question,
2535.80s:  but it's not like that's going to murder your ability
2539.52s:  to make any money.
2540.80s:  It just means you're going to take a bigger haircut,
2542.68s:  getting out of the position.
2543.68s:  And we can go back.
2544.76s:  We literally, we have time.
2546.36s:  We can go into the, into on demand.
2548.76s:  Let's go to the 14th.
2552.44s:  And let's check out like maybe midday.
2556.56s:  Let's go to on demand.
2561.00s:  And this is of May.
2565.48s:  May 14th.
2567.72s:  About midday take us to like 11.
2572.88s:  And let's see.
2575.16s:  Let's see what these, what these options we're looking like.
2590.36s:  And this is crazy.
2592.44s:  Notice how crazy that looks right now they get the ball
2594.84s:  just fucking jacking up here.
2597.80s:  Nuts.
2598.96s:  All right.
2600.92s:  I guess it would have been better if I showed us a comparison,
2603.32s:  huh?
2604.68s:  Yeah, that's shame on me.
2606.16s:  Let's do like,
2607.48s:  oh god, these options are so weird.
2609.68s:  There we go.
2611.00s:  Yeah, so let me take us a couple days back
2613.56s:  to for a comparison.
2614.76s:  Let's go to 30 April.
2618.00s:  April 30.
2621.92s:  So what I want to do is show you guys on a relative basis,
2626.08s:  what happens even if the underlying jacks to the upside.
2631.28s:  I want to show you what happens to the options
2633.88s:  in terms of liquidity.
2638.68s:  So in this case, let's up to this to that.
2642.52s:  So in this case, if we go to the at the money, the 11s,
2646.20s:  right now they're bid at one,
2648.44s:  oh, two offered at one, 10.
2650.40s:  So that's eight cents wide.
2652.40s:  Now the first thing I want to inform you guys on is that
2657.20s:  this is actually really wide for such a cheap product.
2661.08s:  But these options are also really, really elevated
2664.80s:  for such a cheap product.
2665.96s:  It's actually like completely fascinating.
2668.04s:  It's one of the reasons why this thing
2669.72s:  is so fun for me to look at
2671.92s:  because it does a lot of very strange things.
2676.08s:  So even though this is only eight cents wide
2678.64s:  on a relative basis for an $11 product,
2680.88s:  that's a big bid-ask spread.
2684.56s:  I, so now we go back to me,
2687.84s:  what was I said, the 14th,
2689.44s:  and we'll look at the at the monies.
2692.40s:  And then I think they were,
2696.40s:  I just want to use like a solid comparison.
2698.88s:  We'll go to the 21 June's that are 38 days out.
2703.00s:  And then let's grab like 25, okay?
2706.20s:  So we're not seeing anything here that's kind of annoying.
2709.56s:  Maybe 31's?
2710.48s:  Nope, that's kind of annoying.
2712.16s:  Let me see.
2715.16s:  So you can already tell how weird this is, right?
2717.24s:  Like I can't even find out of the money options
2719.72s:  to look at with you guys.
2720.68s:  I'm trying to find options that are around like 55 Delta.
2724.16s:  But it's behaving so crazily.
2727.48s:  Let me see if I get it closer to the open
2729.48s:  before it went through all of this madness.
2732.24s:  Let's do like 0900.
2736.08s:  And it's still already went through the madness.
2740.16s:  Maybe I'll go one day before.
2742.68s:  And I know that it shows up in the 17 Mays.
2745.56s:  So we can look at those two if we have to.
2747.64s:  I wanted to give you guys a clue.
2749.44s:  Yeah, this is fine.
2750.60s:  This will work.
2756.60s:  So here are your 51 Delta's.
2759.84s:  They're down here.
2761.16s:  And it is the 50 choose.
2764.48s:  And their bid 780 offered 805.
2767.72s:  And then we can see the 502.
2770.00s:  80 offered 805.
2771.96s:  So in this case, damn it, they moved.
2776.16s:  Here we go.
2777.92s:  So the 34s and the 35s, the 35s are crazy wide, right?
2783.64s:  So right now if we look at the 34s,
2786.04s:  they're 5550 to 575.
2788.88s:  So 25 cents wide.
2790.68s:  So even though price went up pretty significantly,
2796.04s:  the value of the same Delta option is skyrocketed.
2801.12s:  And if you look at this next option,
2802.76s:  it's bid at 355 offered at 635.
2806.84s:  So this is the market's widening their liquidity.
2810.68s:  So if we go further out in time,
2813.16s:  let's do like these 19 July's,
2815.60s:  you'll see that they're also wide,
2818.00s:  but they're not like not tradable wide.
2820.96s:  They're just wide.
2822.40s:  So in this case, the 25s,
2824.28s:  their bid 1070 offered 1165.
2827.08s:  So you're taking a dollar haircut essentially.
2829.08s:  That's not insignificant,
2831.00s:  but this doesn't necessarily decrease your ability
2836.20s:  to transact here.
2837.72s:  So that is, that's that.
2841.80s:  I forgot who asked that question,
2843.48s:  but let me know if that answers it
2845.36s:  to the shadow quite, man, this is crazy.
2849.52s:  The volume here is just.
2850.60s:  So it's literally incredible to look at.
2853.16s:  It's nuts.
2855.08s:  Let me know if that answers your question.
2860.16s:  Nick says, Reece says,
2862.16s:  do you have core investments you plan to hold indefinitely?
2864.88s:  Nope.
2865.96s:  I do not have that.
2868.76s:  I am a trader.
2870.52s:  So I trade everything.
2871.88s:  Even the retirement accounts I have, I trade those.
2876.56s:  Yeah, I trade everything.
2878.24s:  I have no attachment to individual products.
2881.68s:  And I actually care a lot about trying to maximize
2885.00s:  the return potential,
2886.20s:  which holding indefinitely doesn't do that for me.
2891.16s:  So no, not for me.
2894.88s:  MK says, can you give an explanation on how it is better
2897.48s:  to understand option premiums?
2901.16s:  I'm trying to deconstruct how notorious Ripy say,
2905.12s:  I don't know who the fuck that is.
2907.08s:  Is there something market makers do on premiums
2910.16s:  on specific strikes?
2915.32s:  I'd love to answer, but I don't understand your question.
2919.52s:  When you say better understand option premiums,
2922.20s:  I don't know what that means.
2923.36s:  Do you mean like how they're built?
2925.56s:  Or something else?
2928.68s:  Rama says, thank you for the content, learning a ton.
2932.04s:  That's awesome.
2933.28s:  Feel pretty comfortable with the first order Greeks.
2935.48s:  That's great.
2937.76s:  Rama says, I've been selling covered calls,
2940.00s:  selling cash secured puts, and it's been profitable.
2943.48s:  What would you suggest is my immediate next steps
2945.88s:  in learning do need to learn iron condors, et cetera?
2949.20s:  Great question.
2950.52s:  So this is what I would do.
2953.24s:  Literally I would follow this guide.
2955.44s:  And I will share it.
2957.04s:  This is available literally for everybody for free.
2959.24s:  There's nothing paid in here,
2960.76s:  but I wanted to give people something you can follow along.
2965.56s:  So this is what I would do.
2966.80s:  If you know a couple of those strategies,
2969.60s:  so it looks like you're in here,
2971.72s:  this you can see what I like to do.
2975.28s:  So these are, this is the direction
2977.92s:  that I would go personally.
2980.48s:  But yeah, that's the short answer to that one.
2988.28s:  Oh, Rama says, how do you think about diversification?
2991.84s:  Yeah, that's a great question.
2993.44s:  So diversification is super important,
2995.36s:  but too much of it's also not good,
2997.24s:  which I think is kind of a slept on concept.
3002.96s:  The reason being is because there are people that I know
3007.68s:  and I've come across quite a lot of them
3010.96s:  that they'll have a bunch of positions on,
3014.60s:  but each position is worth 1% of the portfolio.
3018.36s:  So sure, they're hell of diversified.
3020.92s:  However, if you're too diversified,
3023.64s:  even if you get a nice big move in your favor,
3026.76s:  you don't make any money.
3028.04s:  So in my opinion, the concept of diversification
3032.72s:  really, really, really comes down to striking a balance,
3036.28s:  making sure that you have enough diversification
3039.52s:  to make sure that you align with your objectives,
3042.52s:  but you're not too diversified
3044.80s:  and you're not making any money if you're getting moves.
3047.80s:  So yeah.
3049.96s:  Ruta Begas says, since they did a case exponentially,
3053.96s:  should you just move your position further
3055.96s:  in every time it starts accelerating?
3061.96s:  So first, I take your question to mean
3064.96s:  under the assumption of your buying options
3067.96s:  and if you're buying options,
3070.96s:  you can institute kind of a structure
3073.96s:  so that when theta starts eating too much of your lunch,
3078.24s:  you move your options out.
3079.32s:  It's literally exactly what I did today in the 16 augs.
3083.32s:  I could have waited another few days
3084.96s:  like we're not within 30 days,
3086.64s:  which is my specific window
3088.60s:  where I really want to start doing something,
3091.64s:  but it lined up well with the price movement.
3097.20s:  So that's, it's not like a discreet, always do it,
3101.56s:  a set kind of way
3102.84s:  and it's because it's market dependent
3104.56s:  on what the market's doing, but yeah, absolutely.
3107.00s:  If you gain exposure in the 90 ADT, 70 DT,
3110.08s:  the 49, whatever you want,
3111.72s:  you could pick a time frame
3113.24s:  that as it starts getting closer to that,
3115.32s:  you want to get out.
3116.16s:  Now, again, there's a million ways to do this
3118.56s:  and I want to make sure that you guys understand
3120.40s:  that I'm talking to you from my perspective
3123.24s:  because there's also something to be said
3124.92s:  for coming within 30 days
3127.40s:  and you can still trade options in this time frame.
3130.56s:  I do periodically.
3132.64s:  It's just not my go to.
3134.44s:  So when I'm talking to you guys
3135.68s:  from like this broader sense of generalities,
3139.04s:  that's what I'm sharing.
3140.04s:  But there's absolutely nothing that's going to break you.
3143.36s:  If you come in here to a 14 day trade, 14 DTE,
3146.84s:  if you think your move is going to occur in 14 DTEs
3151.04s:  and you can go super deep in the money.
3154.36s:  You can buy these 87 Delta's
3157.12s:  or most of these are not super liquid.
3159.00s:  I don't love them.
3159.84s:  Maybe these 22 Delta, the 22 strike calls
3163.16s:  that are bid for 20 gigat,
3165.20s:  and they're offered at 465,
3167.52s:  but on these, you're literally just paying like 30 cents,
3171.08s:  35 cents.
3172.64s:  So you're not on a relative basis
3175.72s:  that's pretty high-fated a K for what's going to come out of them.
3179.24s:  But it's still as a gross dollar amount,
3181.68s:  that's not going to kill you.
3183.24s:  So that's why this game of picking strikes
3188.16s:  or selecting explorations is so cool
3192.48s:  is because you have the ability to really structure
3196.48s:  positions that align with what you're trying to do.
3201.28s:  So I just dropped another video in there
3205.88s:  about buying call options smarter.
3208.40s:  It uses GameStop as a reference,
3211.36s:  but it's not limited to GameStop.
3213.16s:  It's about kind of this process.
3214.48s:  How to strike a balance between DTEs, Delta's,
3218.76s:  because as we talked about before,
3220.12s:  we know that if you pick up a higher Delta,
3223.32s:  your option's going to be more expensive.
3224.92s:  So how do you figure out how high you want to go?
3230.40s:  The neat part about it is you literally
3232.72s:  can develop a pretty simple system that
3236.24s:  looks at what makes sense based on your objectives
3242.52s:  for the position.
3243.72s:  That's the way to think about it, at least I think.
3245.60s:  That's the way that I try to think about the decision.
3251.12s:  Ruta Vegas says since they did a case,
3254.20s:  oh, I already answered that one.
3255.40s:  That's cool.
3258.08s:  All right, cool.
3259.16s:  Oh yeah, Paul says do you build Delta neutral portfolios?
3262.00s:  Are you using some other portfolio strategy?
3263.68s:  No, I do not build Delta neutral portfolios.
3266.52s:  I think the concept of Delta neutral portfolios
3268.80s:  sounds so appealing because people get nervous about risk
3272.12s:  and they like the idea of being able to make money
3274.08s:  in all markets and shit like that.
3276.68s:  But the way I think about building
3279.26s:  like the portfolio disposition is 100% tied
3285.24s:  to what I think about the market.
3289.04s:  So I actually have, as you guess,
3293.24s:  I think I built a slide in here about it.
3297.12s:  Let's find that bad boy.
3299.28s:  Uh, nope, not that one.
3302.16s:  You like that pink though or that purple,
3304.12s:  whatever that color is?
3305.20s:  I think it's pretty legit.
3307.56s:  Yo, where is this here?
3310.76s:  And here.
3313.24s:  So when I look at the idea of setting up a portfolio,
3322.00s:  it's going to be aligned to this stuff.
3325.64s:  So what this means is, let's say for example,
3328.16s:  I think the market is going to go up.
3330.68s:  Why would I wanna have a Delta neutral portfolio
3333.72s:  if I think the market is going to go up?
3335.56s:  Well, the benefit to doing that is if if the market goes down,
3340.16s:  you can make some money on those other positions.
3343.24s:  But from my perspective, I would rather just
3346.24s:  adjust the portfolio as the market goes down and then switch.
3350.88s:  That's the cool part about being a retail trader
3354.08s:  is that I don't have a mandate.
3356.16s:  I don't have any rules placed on me
3358.88s:  on how much money I have to use at a specific point in time
3361.68s:  or what kind of draw down I can sustain
3363.40s:  or literally anything like that.
3365.52s:  I have complete autonomy over what I choose to do.
3369.24s:  So for example, T-Triple Cues,
3373.56s:  I literally had a full exit yesterday
3376.92s:  and I re-entered the majority of the position today.
3382.08s:  It's a complete pivot.
3383.80s:  And there's nothing that stops you from doing that
3387.88s:  as a retail trader.
3389.12s:  You just have to be careful not to go too far down that rabbit hole
3393.04s:  and whip sawing around.
3395.40s:  You lose a lot of money that way.
3396.60s:  So you don't want to do that.
3399.52s:  Rese says keeping a trade long a journal,
3402.60s:  what a difference can't follow a game plan that you don't have.
3406.04s:  Yeah, that's awesome.
3406.88s:  I'm really glad that you're doing that.
3408.32s:  In my opinion, that's probably one
3409.72s:  of the most transformational aspects of trading, literally,
3413.84s:  is that exact process.
3416.28s:  So I'm super, super stoked that you're doing that.
3422.60s:  All right, any other questions that we want to hit,
3425.72s:  Rolando says they sent you a question.
3427.44s:  It's above, I don't know where it is, man.
3432.64s:  Okay, see it.
3434.16s:  Another question, when is it best to roll options?
3438.00s:  Is it better to roll or selling them by another contract?
3441.08s:  I see.
3441.92s:  So I have a couple videos for you on that
3444.32s:  that you can take a look at.
3445.28s:  And funny enough, I have another video dropping tomorrow
3447.92s:  on rolling.
3449.24s:  So, and I think we actually talked about that.
3452.28s:  Why in depth during one of our recent live sessions?
3456.84s:  So that first one is about rolling kind of a broad concept.
3461.12s:  The second one is about a bunch of common myths about rolling.
3466.36s:  And then this third one is coming out tomorrow.
3468.88s:  So I don't think you'll be able to access it via that link
3471.92s:  because it's scheduled, but when it launches tomorrow,
3475.52s:  you'll be able to see it.
3476.68s:  And it's coming out at 0715 Pacific time.
3481.28s:  So, yeah, there's a couple of resources there for you.
3485.96s:  All right, let's talk about this idea of building strategies.
3488.96s:  When I think about the concept of building a trading strategy,
3492.68s:  and again, I'm not going to spend much time in this slide deck,
3495.52s:  I just want to show you a couple guiding concepts.
3497.60s:  And then really what I want to do for this section actually
3500.40s:  is look at your ideas and walk you through
3503.00s:  how I would think about building traits.
3504.80s:  That's the intention here.
3507.44s:  So when I think about the idea of building strategies,
3512.64s:  one of the most important concepts is maintaining some sort of edge.
3518.84s:  And there's different ways you can access edge,
3522.28s:  which I will give you some ideas, but I want to show you this.
3527.56s:  So this slide, let me see if I can large,
3533.20s:  make this a little bit larger so that the people in the back can see.
3539.40s:  Let me know if that's visible enough.
3541.76s:  If it's not, I honestly have no, nothing I can do to help you.
3545.92s:  So I will make a fake gesture as if I can do something about it, but I cannot.
3550.72s:  So if it's not visible, then I feel bad for you.
3556.00s:  Because otherwise you're not really going to be able to follow along
3558.40s:  at all with what I'm going to say.
3560.84s:  Hi, this is a overview of how I think about building a strategy.
3568.84s:  You can see that there are a few steps.
3572.12s:  These, this here is essentially the process that I would look to follow
3579.72s:  to kind of build a strategy and the way it would work.
3584.28s:  I don't know why that would be at that crazy of an angle.
3588.68s:  That's just silly to me.
3590.52s:  There we go.
3591.72s:  So the idea would be you would flow through this literally just like this.
3599.56s:  And what I try to think about is a process that's replicable over time.
3606.68s:  And it can deliver consistent results.
3610.20s:  Because that's going to be one of the largest aspects of building a successful trading strategy.
3617.32s:  Is finding a way to build ideas that you can then deploy and optimize over time.
3623.80s:  Because it's not that easy.
3626.36s:  And one of the biggest mistakes that you can make in doing this is to have this really
3630.52s:  haphazard bullshit approach that it doesn't allow you to actually test ideas.
3639.48s:  So let's talk about these kind of in a general sense.
3642.60s:  And then like I said, we'll literally dive directly into an example.
3646.60s:  The first thing I'm going to do is define the purpose of the strategy.
3649.96s:  So that's predicated on this.
3652.20s:  So if we go back to the way I think about really the world of trading,
3656.28s:  it's in this light up here.
3658.76s:  Notice how I take a very hierarchical top down approach to this whole thing.
3665.32s:  I'm looking at big picture items and then boiling them down to smaller things.
3671.56s:  So when I look at the portfolio, I split my portfolio into a core allocation and a speculative
3678.52s:  allocation. I now know that I need to have a couple ideas that can work in all of these.
3684.92s:  And I've already given you kind of the cheat sheet for the stuff that I do, which is this right here.
3691.32s:  This is essentially the comprehensive breakdown of the overwhelming number of trades that I put
3698.76s:  on at a given point in time. You literally can find them all here.
3703.56s:  And there's really what I consider to be a lot of beauty in simplicity in what I'm doing.
3713.72s:  So when I'm thinking about building strategies, I want stuff that is robust.
3723.72s:  And I want stuff that allows me to trade most market conditions.
3728.44s:  So the way to answer this first part, purpose of strategy for me, I would outline a strategy
3735.56s:  that allows me to trade every single market condition. That's the first thing I would be looking
3744.52s:  for. And I think I have a slide in here. Do I? I think I do. Yeah, this one.
3754.04s:  This shows you like exactly the stuff that I'm looking to trade. I'm looking to have things that
3762.20s:  allow me to trade directionally up and down. I'm looking to trade volatility and all of its
3769.08s:  individual little quirks, whether it's the clustering, the variance risk premiums, whether it's
3776.12s:  relative value plays, whether it's skew, there's a million things you can trade.
3781.72s:  So these are the broad buckets of what I'm looking to trade. So why does this matter? Why do I
3787.72s:  go through the effort of explaining this to you guys? Well, it's pretty simple.
3793.24s:  It's because I think one of the easiest things you can do to simplify this whole process for yourself,
3800.28s:  which is all the way back here is don't think about having to build a strategy and just build
3807.88s:  10 million of them. You can get to that point if you want. There's not to wrong with it if that's
3811.72s:  your approach. But I would literally start by just defining a you need a strategy to trade things
3817.80s:  that are going up. You probably want a strategy to trade things that are going down. If you want to
3822.84s:  trade both sides of direction, I do. Like those are completely reasonable places to start right there.
3828.76s:  You don't necessarily have to go further than that to start. It's totally up to you, but that's
3833.88s:  a reasonable starting point to take. So capital gains is this idea of making money as direction
3841.88s:  occurs. You can trade things for income. You can want to have a strategy to hedge a portfolio.
3847.72s:  You have to start with what you're trying to do. Then we need to isolate the profit mechanism.
3853.40s:  Simply put, this is how the trade supposedly makes money. So what you'll find is people all the time
3864.28s:  want to put on. They just what they say, like I want to trade something like I want to trade verticals
3871.16s:  or I want to trade calendars. And I'm always thinking like why? Who cares? Like you're just naming
3879.08s:  structures. What you need to do is think about what the thing is that you're trying to build.
3888.12s:  What are you trying to take advantage of? That is the entire purpose of this.
3896.04s:  Rama, hey, thank you so much, Rama. I really, really appreciate that.
3900.36s:  Rama says showing appreciation for me and objective, sharing learnings without pushing
3904.52s:  in gender, you are a true educator. I appreciate that very much. Thank you. That's literally
3909.24s:  that's the entire goal. And I'll happily take a second to give another shout out to this dude
3915.96s:  right there. That's the guy that essentially told me in high school that I should look into investing.
3923.88s:  And then I did. And key with that recommendation completely changed quite literally the entire
3931.96s:  trajectory of my life. That's why I do what I do now. Because this dude that's not part of my
3937.40s:  family that really has no other vested interest in me other than the fact that I was an ROTC with him,
3943.40s:  as you could tell by our cool uniforms here. For no other reason than that, he told me to go look
3950.52s:  into investing. He thinks he would be a good idea for me. He was showing me what's called a
3954.28s:  Goppe love. He was just trying to take care of me. So because of him, my life went down a very
3960.28s:  different path. And it's literally why I do this stuff right now on a Friday evening with you guys
3966.52s:  is because one, I love teaching. But two, I think it's so important to share those kinds of gifts with
3972.28s:  other people. So always shout out to Colonel. All right, back to this though.
3978.44s:  Profit mechanism is how something makes money. How can you find a profit mechanism? How can you
3984.12s:  determine what makes sense? Easy. It is easy. You can look for things and trends around price
3991.64s:  direction up or down. You can look for things relative to volatility. How does it behave? What does it
3997.08s:  do? What are some of its traits? You can look for market inefficiencies. There are a lot of ideas.
4004.92s:  You can literally start by jotting down a bunch of ideas.
4012.36s:  Another idea is to go onto a website like SSRN, which is this.
4021.96s:  And you can type in different things. This is the social science research network. It gives you
4034.36s:  access to tons of peer reviewed papers. That's where the majority of these are from.
4040.84s:  But what I'm showing you in this are all different kinds of profit mechanisms that I literally come
4047.72s:  across from different studies. All different kinds of ideas. So what I'm doing is I'm looking at
4054.60s:  academic information and studies. And I'm using it as inspiration. It's important to know that when
4062.36s:  you use academic research, it is not as simple as they say there's post earnings announcement drift,
4070.68s:  I trade post earnings announcement drift because academic research has a lot of nuances to it.
4079.64s:  And it's not perfect. So you still have to be a thinking human being and interpret that market
4087.00s:  research or whatever paper you're reading or whatever else and still test it. But notice how I
4094.84s:  said it gives me inspiration. It gives me ideas. We are officially out of strawberry watermelon,
4102.84s:  but that's okay. We have our backup of regular watermelon. Love us a good filter water.
4113.00s:  Oh, that one's so much better. So much better.
4117.72s:  Teacher says quant pdia is pretty good as well. Yeah, that's actually a great, great, great
4125.40s:  add in. I do not use it a ton myself because the way that this looks at things is slightly different.
4136.12s:  But it is absolutely still worth checking out. I'm thankful of teaching that you brought this one up.
4142.76s:  Good call. There's quant pdia. All right. So strategy, what's the purpose? What are we trying to do with
4151.96s:  this individual strategy that we're looking to build? Then we need to determine from that
4159.80s:  what kind of profit mechanism are we trying to take advantage of? So again, I give you several ideas
4169.88s:  right here. From there, Reese says, do you have the link to retail trading habits pitfalls? Yeah,
4178.44s:  that's on my website. So on my website, good old fashion, esinvest.com, if you go here and to here,
4191.48s:  all of those studies are available here. So you can literally just drop those in and I cite kind
4197.40s:  of the key takeaways from all of them. Why do I have this here? Because I think it's freaking important
4203.08s:  for people to know what the landscape looks like. So Reese, yes, you can access it there.
4211.88s:  So we now know that we need a specific profit mechanism and again, I give you multiple ideas to
4218.92s:  determine what that could look like. From there, this is this is the important step. We should outline
4227.16s:  a list of perspective strategies that allow us to take advantage of the profit mechanism that
4237.64s:  you are interested in. That is the entire point of that step. So what that means in a practical
4245.48s:  sense is, for example, Jay says, damn, without couch potato buying you dinner, are you going to,
4253.96s:  are you going hungry tonight? Yeah, I know, man, I'm like, shit, I'm supposed to order Greek and
4259.48s:  I'm about to be on the hook for it. We might starve. I'll be honest, maybe doing a little bit of a
4264.36s:  fast isn't the worst thing ever. I'm still pretty fat. So I could stand to lose a few more pounds and
4269.88s:  maybe just do some salsa water. Maybe that's the future for me here.
4273.96s:  The structure list is where you just jot down different structures that allow you to take
4284.52s:  advantage of whatever it is that you're trying to trade. So for example, if I'm trying to trade
4290.60s:  things to the upside, can you guys come up with some ideas? What structures or what things could I do
4297.40s:  that allow me to trade to the upside? You guys have any ideas. Throw them in the chat as many as you
4303.32s:  want. Calls puts, yep, chewies on it so far. What else can we do? That's two.
4314.60s:  Diagon calls, sure, can do that by shares. Roy and Tiddy, love me some Roy and Tiddy, by shares.
4320.12s:  That's perfect. Yeah. Those were all fine. You can do other stuff on top of those, but it starts
4326.84s:  to get more complex. And I'm actually really, really, really glad. You guys started with that
4332.76s:  approach. And it's because one of my biggest recommendations is when you're going through this
4338.52s:  process is to start as simple as possible. And the reason being is because it gives you the
4348.28s:  purest sense of what works. And it really decreases the propensity to start overfitting things
4357.72s:  grossly. So this link here is how to create a consistently profitable option strategy. It goes
4366.12s:  through what we're talking about now, very specifically and in depth, but you guys did the exact
4370.60s:  right thing there. So the structure list is literally just that. I'm not worried about what I like.
4376.20s:  I'm not worried about what I think might work best. I'm literally writing down what I think
4381.08s:  can work. That's it. From there, I'm going to test all of them. Now, before I test all of them,
4390.76s:  I can naturally exclude some of the strategies. If forward ever reason for a broader structural
4398.76s:  reason, it doesn't fit what I'm trying to do. So for example, let's say I already have a long
4407.08s:  option strategy that I like to trade to the upside. If I like it, I already tested it.
4414.52s:  There's not an inherent need for me to duplicate having another long option strategy to trade to
4420.76s:  the upside. That's not saying that there's others that couldn't work, not even saying that there
4424.76s:  are others that could work better. But I would go through that process as I'm trying to build the
4431.24s:  long option strategy to the upside. So you can naturally exclude things if you already have suitable
4439.96s:  strategies that do what you want them to do from the jump. So we take all of these and then we test
4446.60s:  them. We test them with a large data set. We then segment the data into smaller components. We test
4452.68s:  it. And then we evaluate the robustness. How well does it work? How consistent is it? How do the
4460.84s:  path of returns align with what I'm looking for? Am I comfortable with things like the maximum
4467.56s:  drawdown, those kinds of ideas? How do you test? You can either purchase access to back testing
4474.68s:  software. You can run it in Python yourself. You could probably ask chat GPT or another tool like
4480.84s:  that to help you. You can use something like on demand in thinkorswim. And you can go back in time
4489.16s:  and you can manually test your ideas. This is a much slower process. This isn't the way that I would
4496.20s:  start personally. If you're trying to look through a bunch of different things, there is absolutely
4502.44s:  nothing wrong with starting to do this. If you're not even sure how to test, this will teach you a lot
4508.52s:  going through this specific process. So next, after that, let me slide that there. Come back out of
4518.44s:  on demand. After we go through that testing, we have a selection process where we see what
4526.44s:  structures make sense for us. So I guess this should actually say select structures.
4535.16s:  So you can find the structures that work well for what you're trying to do. And then you can
4540.04s:  codify a rule set around them. This is where we're taking a structure and we're turning it into
4545.16s:  a strategy. So for example, a structure is long call. You can now parameterize that long call.
4552.28s:  And you could say, well, maybe I'll buy it when the moving average slope for 14 day and seven
4560.36s:  day moving averages, they're positive. Okay, that's a criteria you can use. You can tinker with as
4568.76s:  many criteria as you would like. My recommendation is to go through a process where you evaluate
4575.56s:  the efficacy of signals standalone. So what that means is if I want to use moving averages,
4584.12s:  if I want to know if moving averages are an effective tool for me to evaluate this long bias
4592.36s:  directional thing I'm trying to trade. The first thing I'm going to do is go to SSRN type in moving
4598.36s:  average. This is what I see. So the first thing I'm going to do is leverage other people's research
4609.00s:  and piggyback off of it. Okay, let me read all of these and see what they come up with and see what
4614.52s:  I think based on that I will refine the signal itself. And then when I'm baking it into a strategy,
4623.48s:  I will see how it aligns with the strategy. So I guess maybe we can do something like this to make
4631.80s:  it easier. And we'll include a thing in there for testing a signal. So we marry up the structures,
4646.44s:  we marry up the signals, we marry up our management approach, then we determine what fits best
4653.80s:  into our portfolio, and then we start testing it live. So that's like a super broad overview of what
4660.44s:  this process look like. I'm going to take a pause there before we get into an example. And what
4665.72s:  questions do you guys have about this process? What do you guys think about it? Do you, it doesn't make
4673.00s:  sense are there specific components to it that are unclear or things that you want to dive more
4681.32s:  into detail on? Other than Alper who's stoked on Tesla, which is cool. I'm stoked that you're stoked
4696.36s:  on Tesla. Okay, so let's take a look at something not to do.
4713.56s:  This is a great example of what I wouldn't seek to do with any sort of live trade. So you can
4723.08s:  see that we have this person asking if they should roll options to extract profits on a trade that
4731.48s:  they have on. This is quite literally the absolute worst time on planet earth to attempt to figure
4740.52s:  out what to do. Literally about is bad is it can possibly get. So I would absolutely recommend not
4749.00s:  doing that with literally without a doubt. I would not do that.
4758.12s:  Policies how do you choose data providers? That's a great question. So for market data and options
4765.00s:  data, I use CBO, but they're not the cheapest choice. So I do have a couple companies I'm affiliated
4773.24s:  with. They're typically in the description to my videos. Literally the reason why I affiliate with
4778.68s:  anybody is to get people discounts on things. Most of them don't really pay me anything worthwhile,
4785.80s:  but the products that I'm affiliated with that I think are genuinely good are things like Orats,
4793.24s:  Options Omega, Benzenga, BarChart. They all have different options data available to you depending
4799.88s:  on what you're trying to do. But for me personally, I literally go through CBO and I buy their market data
4807.56s:  directly. It is, it's expensive. So if you're not what I would consider to be like a much more
4816.92s:  serious trader, I think using some of those other tools probably be a little more economically viable.
4826.44s:  Nathan asks, when you use Python scripts to test new strat, you ever use LLM type script to
4835.56s:  forecast as well? Definitely. Yeah. And there's no reason not to. So there's a component about
4841.64s:  forward testing that's a slightly different bucket than back testing. I think it's really important
4847.24s:  to back test first to see what you can get to work, to see what kind of aligns with the objectives
4854.92s:  that you have and what fits well with the portfolio. And then you can absolutely start looking at
4860.60s:  forward testing ideas using either some sort of generator or like a random market sampling technique
4867.96s:  that's another really effective one to create like a new path, stuff like that. Ian says, trailing
4875.72s:  stops are they picked at the underlying price or to the option position price either or it
4879.72s:  depends on your broker, but you can set a trailing for either. Good question. Cool. All right.
4890.12s:  Retired. I love that. Ridley truth or I'm glad to know that you are retired. Big fan.
4899.00s:  If you have a call option that doesn't expire for a few weeks months, but you hit your take
4904.12s:  profit early or just an extremely good run goes, do you sell early or is that too vague? No, it's not
4908.76s:  too vague at all. In those instances, I typically use like some sort of trailing stop. That's my approach.
4915.24s:  So for example, T triple queues. I've been buying into this for the majority of the year, but
4921.48s:  definitely a depth of the position started going on as we came out of this drop and kind of
4930.36s:  scaling up towards the end of April beginning of May. So the original price target that I had
4938.20s:  essentially was taking it from 60. And what I do for these kinds of price targets is I go further
4944.04s:  out in time. So like two years, I have to go even further. Let's go to five years. So what I do is
4949.56s:  I say, what references do I have to other perspective support and resistance? So you can see that
4956.12s:  there's some congestion here at like the 68 handle. You can see some congestion here at the 75
4963.08s:  handle. So what I did in this case is as I was buying in, I already had an existing position from
4968.52s:  down here. I took it to the downside got stopped out in this space, waited for recovery,
4973.56s:  started to see a recovery here beginning of May and of April. And then I set the initial profit
4979.24s:  target of 75 bucks. So that's the give me an idea of where I'm trying to take this thing to,
4985.16s:  how I'm trying to ride it. And then when it hits 75 bucks, I don't just take the trade off
4991.40s:  because it's doing what I want as long as it continues to do what I want, I absolutely would
4997.40s:  not take the trade off. But what I do is I start setting stops. So in this case, the initial stop
5004.76s:  that I use specifically in T triple queues was when either I had a greater than 3% drop within an
5011.80s:  individual day or if price fell below the 14 day MA and a 20, I think this one's a 20,
5021.64s:  let me see this one, 22. And or price falls below a 14 day MA with the 22 negative sloping.
5031.56s:  So this one stopped me out on the severity of the entry day move. And that's why I
5037.96s:  accident. And that's why I ended up re-entering today because it started essentially behaving as it
5042.92s:  should yet again. So I would not arbitrarily take the position down though. I think that that kind of
5049.40s:  does you a disservice. And for me, like I said, I typically like to use something like a like a
5057.56s:  10 day 11 day 14 day, there's a million combinations. I'll get rid of this seven though,
5063.96s:  just so it's a little less noisy to give you an idea. The other thing I do like to use though
5070.04s:  is the the slope of moving averages. So the fact that that seven day MA essentially turned negative,
5077.40s:  let me go back and add it back in. I just want to show you specifically what I was looking out there.
5085.24s:  So I want this to be seven. And then I'm going to make this bad boy red.
5100.44s:  So the reason by the way that I do like red for this is because since I have like multiple moving
5107.08s:  averages, it literally helps me track a little more cleanly like Roy G bib. That's the old
5117.80s:  Roy G bib. So in this case, you can see that this had a big negative day, but the seven day MA
5126.28s:  slope was still positive. Then you can see that this also had a pretty big red day, but the seven
5132.84s:  day MA slope was still positive. In this case, the seven day MA slope literally flipped negative.
5141.32s:  So that is not something that I take lightly. There's other tools that I use, but in this case,
5149.72s:  that's essentially a big part of the trigger. That's also why up here, as you can tell, like I actually
5156.68s:  have the various MA slopes. And you can codify this in essentially however you want. Let me see if
5164.28s:  I can find it. This one. So I have MA slopes for all different periods. So like I can add the
5172.76s:  seven day back in. And then essentially, I would add it down here as another input into this, but
5181.72s:  that's the idea at least behind using the moving average slopes. So yeah, long answer with a little bit
5190.60s:  of specifics around this example. But if I hit the profit target early, I do not immediately take the
5198.68s:  trade down. The trade is doing what I want. I want to let the trade work for as long as I can,
5205.00s:  as long as it continues to do what I want. That's the idea.
5212.60s:  Dr. Zayah says, what effect is price movement in the underlying have on each exploration cycle
5217.08s:  of the options chain nearest expirations will experience more change relative to the longer data,
5221.00s:  right? Sort of. Not inherently. So what example would I give you that would qualify the not inherently
5233.00s:  part? Do you have any ideas? And in the meantime, I'll pop this open and see if I can't add that
5247.08s:  that other slope in here. So what other criteria can you guys think of that would lead what they're
5256.60s:  talking about to not always be the case? Dr. Zayah says, I didn't have a ticker in my, no, no,
5263.48s:  it's not specific to a ticker. What I'm actually talking about is a broader topic. It's, yeah,
5271.48s:  it's definitely not something that's specific to a ticker, actually literally at all. So yeah,
5278.28s:  you don't have to worry about that. That's not what I'm referring to here.
5284.92s:  Volume, nope, not volume. Good guess, but that ain't it.
5292.28s:  Earnings, nope, not it either. Interesting. Very interesting. So no, the way to think about it is,
5299.56s:  I want you guys to think about Delta. And I want you guys to think about gamma. So where
5308.28s:  is Delta and where is gamma? How would those impact the decision on where we would see this example
5320.28s:  where I'm talking specifically about longer dated options, actually seeing potentially more of a
5329.16s:  move as compared to the shorter dated options? It is tied completely to Delta and to gamma.
5344.04s:  So what do you guys think? There's a specific timeframe that we would see the options move a lot more
5353.88s:  on a relative basis as compared to other time frames, but it can flip when we look at something like
5365.00s:  Delta and gamma. Any ideas you guys?
5372.68s:  And in the meantime, we got our script back up so that you guys can see those other slopes. So
5379.16s:  you can see the seven day, 22 day, 50 and 200.
5384.36s:  Intrinsic value is not correct. Benoit is the closest so far with closer to add the money.
5390.76s:  So let's take a look at an example. Let's pick a stock, pick a stock, any stock.
5397.64s:  And let's go back in time. Roaring TD says I'm not, I'm not sure I understand the question. Yeah,
5402.76s:  let me clarify. So I have to go back up. I lost the question. So Dr. Zeyes asked what
5409.64s:  effect is price movement in the underlying have on each expiration cycle? The nearest
5414.44s:  expiration will experience more change relative to longer dated. So what he's asking is if the price
5423.48s:  in we got to pick something else, let's look at Lulu. So if the price in Lulu moves either direction
5431.48s:  up or down, they're postulating that that movement will impact the shorter term
5437.96s:  expirations more than the longer term expirations. And it's partially correct, partially incorrect.
5447.24s:  So I'm asking you guys to decipher the difference. What element of it is partially correct?
5453.00s:  And what element is partially incorrect? Carlos speculates theta, which would be a great example
5459.56s:  of an incorrect answer. Rises via gamma, yes, percentage wise, closer.
5468.52s:  Closer. Dr. Zeyes says thank you for deep diving this love. And yeah, this is, it's a great question.
5473.40s:  This is, again, this is how people learn. So let's take a look at an example.
5479.40s:  If I buy this 350 call, and let's pretend we're in an alternate universe, where Lulu catches a
5488.12s:  bid and it goes up. Right now, I buy these for $3.90 at the mid. Okay. What happens if I go out
5499.64s:  431 days and I buy these 200s. And I buy these for 160, a 83 way more expensive.
5516.44s:  If we get a dollar move in Lulu, which one of those positions make more? Is it the 200 call
5524.44s:  that's out 431 days? Or is it, I forgot why expiration were in or the 350s that are at a 46 delta
5533.56s:  with four days to go. These are about as close as you can get before expiration.
5537.72s:  Which one of those would move more? Delta J, bingo. That's the first part of the equation.
5548.44s:  Right. Delta, go back to the basics. Delta tells us the rate of change of in options premium.
5557.00s:  Res says front experee, bad timing because you are wrong. And that sucks. It sucks to be wrong.
5567.80s:  Now, actually, we can, we can make res partially right here on a relative basis in terms of the cost
5574.92s:  of the option. They might make more money. That could be, but not in terms of a gross dollar amount.
5583.08s:  So these would make less money. Why? Well, they have a 46 delta. So if Lulu goes up one dollar,
5594.44s:  let's just say that these are $4 for ease. Let's say you bought them at $4. If it goes up $1,
5600.92s:  these would give you 46 cents of profit. So your $4 are now worth $4.46. You've made $46.
5611.96s:  We go out here, 431 days back into the 90 delta to the 200s. If Lulu goes up a dollar,
5620.60s:  you've made $90. Your way further out in time, but it is a 90 delta. So that means is Lulu moves up
5630.60s:  by $1. These options make 90 cents. The front expiration in that example, you've made 46
5639.88s:  cents or 40 whatever sense it was. So that is a prime example of how going further out in time,
5649.56s:  you can actually make more money than the near term. Benoit says, but those are hugely different
5656.84s:  position sizes on an equally on an equal equity basis sooner x-rays would always have a larger move.
5665.16s:  If you were to isolate it in that sense in terms of a percentage gain, yes. Well, it also would
5671.96s:  depend on how far out you go, right? It's a bit of a sliding scale. So for example,
5678.44s:  you can have a smaller variance between the options between the expirations, but yes,
5686.04s:  absolutely. Your point is correct. On a percentage gain, you will see larger percentage gains
5694.28s:  on shorter dated options. But again, this is the important part of being a thinking trader,
5701.08s:  right? Because the name of the game at the end of the year isn't, what is the percentage gain
5706.84s:  on the portfolio? Would you want a 100% gain on a $1 portfolio or a 10% gain on a $100 portfolio?
5716.12s:  I would absolutely take the lower percent return on the larger principle yielding a larger dollar
5724.76s:  amount. So that's what I look for, even when I'm structuring things like my GameStop
5730.84s:  trades that I'm putting on. That's why I'm going further out in time is I'm going further in
5736.04s:  the money. I'm not going far out in time and then hanging out here in the ether because to a lot
5743.56s:  of your guys' point, which you're seeing very well, these will have a lower gamma. So these won't
5749.48s:  move as much. But if you have a high delta, you don't care so much about gamma because once delta
5756.52s:  gets to one, that's all it can do. So gamma only starts to hurt you at that point if it goes against
5763.16s:  you, meaning if the underlying goes against you and gamma builds. But you might pay a larger
5771.24s:  principle up front, but it's also a little bit of a deductible because you're going really far
5777.32s:  in the money. There's a lot of intrinsic value. So if the underlying doesn't move, let's say it stays
5783.08s:  flat or goes up slightly, your extrinsic value, your cost of holding that position is not that high.
5791.00s:  Now you are paying a larger gross amount. So if the underlying is a big sweeping move against you,
5796.68s:  you do stand to lose more money. But again, that's the nature of being a trader. If you have an
5802.36s:  option that's at a one delta and you let it become a 30 delta, you've grossly fucked up. You've
5810.20s:  not done your job as a trader. So the way to think about aspirations is it's part of the equation
5820.12s:  along with delta's. But you can have longer expirated options that make more money than near term
5828.68s:  expiration options entirely possible. And you can have vice versa. You can have the inverse.
5833.48s:  You can have a near term option that makes a larger gross dollar amount than a longer dated option,
5839.48s:  also entirely possible. So delta is going to be one of the primary inputs you need to look at.
5846.04s:  Gamma is the next input that matters a lot.
5852.28s:  Benoit says, how do you think about capital allocation then? I generally try to be almost
5856.60s:  completely allocated. So I'd rather have the larger percent move if I have all my funds allocated.
5863.80s:  Do you? Is that actually what you would want? Which scenario would you make more money?
5870.84s:  So if we put equivalent size positions on and there's a specific trade off and the point
5882.44s:  emerges sooner or later that you'll notice. Let's go back to Lulu and let's pretend we're
5888.60s:  structuring a trade to the downside because Lulu cannot catch a bid quite literally to save
5895.64s:  its life. So let's say you want to trade Lulu to the downside. And you want short term dated
5902.52s:  options because they expand more, but we're going to buy puts and let's say let's just pretend
5907.80s:  that this was more liquid. It's kind of super illiquid, but let's just pretend it was liquid.
5912.76s:  And let's say that we want to buy these 280s. We'll analyze that.
5918.36s:  We do our risk profile. And then let's say that we want to go 98 days out and rather than those
5925.08s:  280s, we buy the trifitties, analyze that. So now the first thing you could do to your point is
5933.64s:  you can say, well, I would want to put on the same size position. Okay. So then I'll let the dog in
5939.72s:  one second.
5948.04s:  Oh my god.
5950.04s:  Here he is. In all his glory, I literally have to change this so that you guys can get a peak.
5958.20s:  All right. So here he is. He's ready to teach about options. He's well versed. Thank you.
5965.88s:  And he's ready to talk about shorting. Hey, attention. He's
5970.92s:  all right. So he yawned some. The reason why he's yawning is because he's used to this. He kind
5975.00s:  of knows all this stuff. So he's a little bit bored. That's what I think. But we'll proceed anyways.
5985.00s:  So you could say, I want to structure these same size position. And you can do that. But let's talk
5991.72s:  about that in a second. Let's see what size move. If you just look at them at a one-to-one basis first
5998.52s:  and you'll see why I'm doing this. Let's see what size move you need in order for these near
6004.28s:  dated out of the money puts in order to make more money than the in the money puts. So in order
6012.60s:  to help us visualize that, I'm going to add a few different standard deviations. I'm going to use
6020.04s:  plus one and minus one. And this is just standard deviation move of the underlying price plus two
6030.52s:  minus two plus three minus three. Okay. So let's see. At a minus one standard deviation, you make
6041.88s:  three 17. At a minus two standard deviation, you make 1058. And at a minus three standard deviation,
6048.60s:  you make 2042. Now let's go back to this one. If you make a one standard deviation down move,
6054.84s:  you make 784. So 784 compared to 316, 317, you make more here.
6064.68s:  1777 on a two standard deviation move compared to 1053. So you still make more here.
6072.36s:  And then on a three standard deviation move, you make 2800 here versus 2000 here.
6079.16s:  So on a non similar size position in terms of capital outlay, but on a one to one basis,
6089.80s:  you can see how the short dated option will compound much more given in a accommodating move.
6097.64s:  However, it won't outpace the profit side. So let's take a look at the next component then,
6108.76s:  which is you have the ability to size this trade up. Right. So if this cost me 6,345 bucks for this
6116.68s:  one individual position, you could put on like 63 of these. You could put on a ton. So that starts
6122.52s:  to look really good, doesn't it? Because then you can say, well, well, shit, if I get a one standard
6127.88s:  deviation move in my favor, I make 20 grand on the same size position. That seems fantastic. Does it not?
6138.76s:  Not so much. Why is that? Well, there's a really, really important difference here. Take a look
6146.36s:  at my theta on this trade $4.99. That's on my one lot. If I do the same size trade,
6156.52s:  my theta is $1,144. So you can make way more money if you get your move in the correct amount of time.
6169.40s:  If you don't or if it's not a big enough move fast enough, theta will completely eat your lunch.
6179.56s:  And as time passes, so let's say your move doesn't happen on the first day, notice what just happened.
6188.52s:  If we look at, I want to see if I can keep that highlighted. If you're $20,000 profit there,
6194.60s:  it just turned to $18,355 one day later. One day later, your max profit on that one standard deviation
6205.24s:  move just went down $1700. If it's two days later, it just went down another $4,000.
6216.52s:  This is exactly the issue and this is exactly the trade off. So going back to your question,
6223.80s:  Benoit, for me, I focus more on what kind of risk makes sense for my thesis and then structuring
6235.40s:  a position around that. So Benoit, if you take a look at that video that I made or the video I
6244.20s:  shared earlier, it walks through how I think of this. So Benoit says this is just another
6251.56s:  rehash of the buy better calls video. That's exactly correct. Yep, that's exactly correct.
6255.88s:  And it's because the way I think about it is it's not saying that further out in time is better.
6260.84s:  I don't want anybody to think that that's the conclusion I'm trying to draw with you guys because
6265.16s:  it's not, it's genuinely not what I'm trying to summarize to here. What I'm trying to summarize to
6270.68s:  is that based entirely on your expectations in disposition as a trader, you need to build and
6280.04s:  structure a corresponding trade that makes sense for you. That's the entire idea.
6288.52s:  So that is the punchline, at least to that question. Benoit, let me know if that makes sense.
6295.96s:  I have to turn off my house's air because it's blowing like crazy. You know, chill house.
6305.72s:  Any other questions on that? That was a great question, by the way, though. I'm really,
6311.24s:  really stoked. Okay, cool. So it sounds like that connected. Great. Sweet.
6317.48s:  So let's go back and kind of finish a quick walk through then of this example of this year,
6325.64s:  building a strategy. So let's say that I want to trade stuff to the upside. If I'm looking for
6331.64s:  some sort of breakout idea and let's say you do a bunch of homework and you identify,
6338.20s:  you know, as you're going through SSRN and you're looking at all these different kinds of things.
6343.00s:  Let's say that you find that stocks that are making 52 week highs tend to have a drift component to
6351.64s:  them and to continue to make relative highs. And if you're kind of picking up what I'm putting down,
6359.88s:  that's it is an effect. I know it exists. It's a momentum effect. It's called a momentum
6364.04s:  premia. There's different ways to capitalize on it. So I'm giving you an example of a already baked
6372.28s:  profit function, which is what this is. So from there, the first step here, let me see if I can
6381.00s:  like shrink this and keep it as we look through this. This might be like really difficult for you
6386.20s:  guys to see. So I'll kind of like talk about it as we look at stuff. But the purpose of the
6391.88s:  strategy in this case is we're building something that allows us to capitalize on upward price
6396.92s:  movement. We don't care yet if it's long premium, short premium, doesn't matter. We just want
6404.28s:  something that allows us to make money if stock goes up. The profit mechanism that we're talking
6409.56s:  about, the direction is up. And we're looking for something that exhibits momentum premia. So
6416.04s:  we now need to, I guess, we need to do like this is really where signal test would make sense,
6425.96s:  wouldn't it? I think that makes way more sense. Yeah. And then this would be more like a signal alignment.
6437.48s:  So Ridley says, so identify catalysts first, definitely. So the very well, kind of the second
6449.48s:  step for me is to identify a profit mechanism. What do I think I can make money from? So again,
6456.04s:  in this case, we're talking about trying to trade something to the upside. So I would need to test
6462.20s:  that signal. And there are different ways I can think about qualifying and quantifying that profit
6469.72s:  mechanism. So I can look at again, this one is kind of already done for the sake of time.
6475.88s:  But you can look at the performance of stocks. Let's say that have the highest PE ratios or the
6482.36s:  lowest price to book ratios or the lowest price to earnings growth ratios. If you wanted to use
6487.72s:  some fundamental tools, you could use stocks that are trading above 50 moving averages.
6498.20s:  So what I'm highlighting there is you can gain exposure to a lot of different things.
6505.40s:  And depending on how you want to quantify it, you can access it in slightly different ways.
6512.36s:  So in this case, like I said, I'm kind of giving you a already baked concept. And it's really just so
6520.76s:  that you can have an idea of what this looks like. So if I'm looking up this momentum premium idea,
6529.48s:  there's a couple of things that matter a lot to me. So do I still have this open?
6535.40s:  I don't hear. We can use what I'm doing is I'm going through like my litany of studies.
6547.56s:  And I'm finding examples of momentum premium like this here.
6559.48s:  So this is an example of momentum premium. You can look for things that have specific parameters
6565.64s:  for an earnings release. And then you can essentially trade it in a bunch of different ways.
6578.44s:  I'm texting my wife real quick. She's
6583.96s:  hungry. So I just ordered her dinner. So in this case, you can look at host earnings and there's
6592.68s:  a bunch of different criteria that can be met and that becomes your signal. So things that have a gap
6599.56s:  up, things that tend to be smaller market cap stocks, meaning not mega cap stuff like that becomes
6607.16s:  part of your signal. And then you can test that any way that you want. So now let's use the next
6615.08s:  part of this example. We want to trade things that go up. We know that we're trying to do some sort of
6621.56s:  momentum premium play. And in this example, rather than P, we're using the 52 week high criteria.
6628.52s:  We now can build a list of structures that allow us to trade to the upside. You guys already
6635.64s:  did this actually. So if you think about this kind of thing, what structures can apply here?
6642.28s:  Walk me through what you think what you think makes sense.
6654.04s:  And then in the meantime, Roy and Titi says, how do you do that for mergers acquisitions? You
6657.40s:  literally can test. You can find, you can create an entire list of companies, public companies that
6663.48s:  have undergone M&A. And then you can look at price behavior pre-post volatility behavior pre-post.
6669.88s:  It's exactly what I would do. It's another very tradable thing, by the way. And also you can very
6675.08s:  frequently detect when there is a perspective M&A process underway. If you take a look at the
6683.88s:  options chains, which are mega, mega informative. So to recap the other structures that you guys
6692.44s:  already listed, there are things like long calls, buying shares, short puts. All of those can make
6698.68s:  sense if we're trying to trade something directionally to the upside. Okay, cool.
6704.04s:  So now we need to test them. So this is where I would run it through a series of back tests.
6710.92s:  The first thing I would do is say, okay, maybe for this 52 week high, I would look at sorting all
6720.44s:  stocks that are optionable. And in this case, I'm using weeklies just for liquidity measure.
6726.28s:  I'm going to sort them by those making the highest 52 week highs at a given point in time.
6732.44s:  And I'm going to essentially simulate purchasing the top 10 of them, the top
6738.84s:  desiolate if you're selling client or really whatever number you want. And I'm just going to focus
6745.00s:  first on using the underlying itself, meaning buying shares. Or if I wanted to trade it to the
6752.28s:  downside, shorting shares. Why would I do that if I'm testing kind of the profit potential?
6761.32s:  And the ideally testing a bunch of different structures, why do you guys think I would do it that way?
6769.64s:  Starting with just the shares. Any ideas? There's a very specific reason.
6782.28s:  Because it's at the high. So it's uncertain. It's a good question, but no, that's not it.
6793.88s:  If it will break out, better risk management, another great guess, but also not correct.
6798.52s:  It's because I'm starting with this simplest concept. That's it. Shares are the simplest ways
6804.44s:  to trade this. So right now, I'm just trying to understand, based on this profit mechanism that I
6811.88s:  think exists that I've tested with a couple different signals. I want to see how it performs if I
6817.64s:  just use the underlying, because remember, options essentially are just amplified versions of the
6825.08s:  underlying with a bunch of additional rules. So for example, if I buy shares and I make money with
6831.80s:  this structure, well, that already tells me something. It means that if I use options, it'll make
6837.40s:  money. It means that if I sell puts or buy calls, it'll make money. I already know it makes money
6844.28s:  because it makes money if the underlying goes up. But it becomes an assessment of quality.
6850.52s:  So for example, if I test long shares and I want to test holding for a week, two weeks, a month,
6859.32s:  two months, three months, six months, 12 months, something like that. I'm going to look for trends
6864.20s:  across all those different timeframes. And then I'm going to say, okay, well, it seems like,
6870.20s:  based on this smattering of underlines that I bought, I would run literally a regression to see
6875.32s:  one what the correlation is in terms of what timeframes make the most sense to hold and what kind of
6881.16s:  traits tend to perform the best. And then I can overlay and build some sort of option equivalent to
6890.12s:  that. It's harder to back test. Now, if you have the savvy, it's not that difficult. But
6898.20s:  you can absolutely use that as a starting point. And if you notice that your long shares make money.
6905.48s:  And let's say that on average, you see a 5% drift over the following month.
6914.60s:  Well, now you have something to work with because if I know that there's a 5% average drift over
6921.00s:  the course of the following month, now I can say, well, does it make more sense to buy calls or more
6927.96s:  sense to sell puts? And you can do a simple comparison. So let's use this as an example. Let's say
6938.44s:  that we want to use VRT. And if I know that over the month, it's probably going to go up by 5%.
6950.44s:  I could sell puts, let's say that I want to postulate selling like a 30 delta put here,
6957.72s:  collecting like 435 ish. And then let's say I want to buy a 70 delta
6965.72s:  call or I'm sorry, 70 DTE. You have 70 delta makes sense here, like 75 delta maybe.
6973.72s:  Do like a 72 delta call. And it's 15 55. So here's the first thing I need to determine.
6983.08s:  Based on the position here, which one do I like more? Do I want to outlay 15 55 bucks? Maybe,
6992.12s:  there's nothing wrong with that if your portfolio has room for it. Or you'd have to see what the
6997.00s:  margin requirement is for the 42 and a half put, which in this case, it's 8,250 bucks.
7006.20s:  So in terms of capital utilization, you actually can use more from the long calls. And again,
7011.56s:  maybe it doesn't matter to you. Maybe you have the margin in there and you just don't care.
7016.76s:  But now we can then assess, well, if we get our 5% move, how does my short put do? I make $119
7026.28s:  on my 80 to 50 outlay. If I get my 5% move to the upside on the calls, I get $336.
7036.28s:  And there's no margin requirements. You're going to pay for it in cash, which is 15 55.
7041.24s:  So if you get your 5% move, which one of these is actually better? Well, if it moves in your
7046.44s:  favor, unequivocally, you make more money with the long calls. This is how you back into what makes
7053.56s:  sense. So now I would overlay the risk management. Let's say that I'm going to manage risk here
7062.36s:  at 8560, just because I think if it drops below that, it looks like it would probably head towards
7072.20s:  8224 and I don't want to take it that far, whatever. So let's call it if there's a close
7079.32s:  below 85. So now what we can do is we can say, all right, well, if price goes to my stop point of 85,
7091.64s:  how do these perform? The long call, if it goes to, I guess I should, wait, oh, duh, I'm an idiot, sorry.
7102.36s:  My bad. If it goes to 85, in this case, you lose 325 bucks. And in this case, you lose 165.
7115.88s:  So you lose more money here if you get stopped out, but you also have the potential to make more money.
7123.88s:  So this is looking closer to a one to one, risk to reward profile. This is looking like a sub one,
7131.32s:  risk to reward. This is the risk profile tab. Mrs. Royantity. This is someone. So now we have to
7141.00s:  take the next step, which is what's the probability of us getting this 5% up move versus this 85% or
7149.00s:  I'm sorry, this 85 price point stoppage. So now we can go to probability and we can look at the
7155.88s:  probability of a touch. And we can look over the next month for like a normalized time frame.
7164.60s:  So using like the 16 aug maybe. And what's the probability of us being stopped out to the downside at 85?
7174.84s:  It is 83%. And then what's the probability of us hitting that 95 handled to the upside?
7183.16s:  to about 78%. So now guess what? You literally have just created the input
7194.92s:  to a very important calculation, which would then be codified across all of the different strategies
7202.12s:  that you use, which is expected return, which is somewhere in here. I just don't know where.
7212.60s:  Where is that pesky expected return? Oh, I think it's up here more.
7225.32s:  Ah ha, finally, sorry. That took a second to get to. This right here.
7233.16s:  So you now know what your win price would be. You now know the probability of getting that win.
7240.28s:  You now know what the loss would be. And you now know the probability of that loss.
7245.96s:  So you literally have all of the tools to answer this exact question of which of these strategies
7255.16s:  makes more sense in this individual trade. Now this is evaluating it against the concept of an
7260.44s:  individual trade, which ideally you would apply the structure then strategy way more broadly.
7271.24s:  And you would have much more of a codified approach. But that's literally an overview of this
7279.56s:  process kind of from start to finish. So I will take a pause there and see what questions you guys have.
7287.48s:  Anything in there that you want to dive a little bit deeper into. I am getting ready to order my
7292.84s:  dinner now, but it's not going to be here for at least a minute. So we can take a look at
7300.52s:  anything else that you guys would like to hit. We're doing I'm doing old spaghetti factory tonight.
7315.08s:  That's the move.
7320.20s:  Cool. Well, it looks like there are no questions popping up. I'm happy to hang out for a couple more
7327.24s:  minutes if you guys have anything that does pop up. Yeah, let's take a look.
7334.76s:  A count guy to says, could you look at my question above about the parameter? I didn't see it. Can
7339.16s:  you post it again for me down here? I totally missed it. And then in the meantime,
7344.92s:  Banner, Vera, Plains. I like your plans to you.
7348.76s:  Is can you talk about cash secured puts? Yeah, sure. What about cash secured puts?
7354.36s:  Let me know what you want to dive into. Chewie says does that work with your DTE? Of course.
7360.92s:  The process is agnostic to everything. It's again, it's a probabilistic assessment.
7368.12s:  But yeah, the process itself is essentially standardized. So that's the point of building an
7376.60s:  approach like that is you don't have to go through a lot of different stages realistically.
7384.52s:  You can kind of codify what works well to test a lot of different concepts. So
7392.84s:  a fan of airplanes, what's your approach for using CSPs? Really, I only use them as part of the
7399.80s:  coverage triangle. And that's if I'm looking to accumulate positions, it's less so as a method
7408.28s:  to acquire shares. It's more so a method to try to capture risk premium in something that I
7414.12s:  fully anticipate to build out. However, I do not in general run a lot of CSPs. I'm even
7423.48s:  finding myself more and more as of late with the way that the market is behaving recently.
7428.84s:  Spending way more time trading things like the ratio called diagonals. I'm not like fully out of
7435.80s:  using something like the coverage triangle, obviously. But what I'm doing in a pretty big way is
7443.64s:  trying to use the indices more and more. And a lot of that is to just be more
7450.76s:  tax efficient. And when you're trading the indices themselves, they do not have options
7458.04s:  or an underlying that you can trade. So yeah, I think that's kind of like the long and short of it.
7469.40s:  Accounting guy, wondering if you've tried estimating parameters for a Heston model for option
7476.28s:  pricing. I'm trying to build a Monte Carlo Sim, but not getting real estate results. Yeah,
7479.80s:  that's the problem that you likely will have if you're going through the process and trying to
7483.96s:  estimate your own wall. Heston is okay, but it misses a ton of stuff. So I think most people that
7493.24s:  are trying to estimate their own wall are using some sort of variation of a garsh model.
7498.84s:  But even those you need to include some sort of jump diffusion because accounting for gaps
7505.80s:  is really, really, really, really important. So something you can tinker with is this website
7512.84s:  from New York University Stern. And you can take a look at a bunch of different kinds of
7519.48s:  wall models that they tinker with. And you can see what seems to represent the world a little
7525.80s:  bit better for you. And then you can essentially see what you want to replicate from this, at least
7530.68s:  is a starting point. But the Heston, it's too simplistic. It misses too much. So yes, I have used it,
7537.88s:  but it does not surprise me that you're not getting real estate results.
7541.56s:  Yeah. Dr. Zayas says, I'm wondering about IRA accounts, pros and cons of IRA account for trading
7551.16s:  options. Yeah, that's totally fine. I trade options in an IRA account. There are slightly
7556.36s:  different rules that go along with it. I actually literally think I have videos on trading options
7561.08s:  in an IRA. You see, I do. A little bit old, but I think it's still probably, probably right.
7570.44s:  So there's that video that is, yeah, it's definitely much older. But
7581.88s:  yeah, you just have to change the approach a little bit is what it boils down to. But I use
7590.52s:  I use a IRA literally all the time for trading. It's less frequent. But like I'll still look at it
7600.36s:  every couple weeks, week, every other week, something like that. And the only the only broader concept
7606.68s:  there is less so like if it makes sense to trade in an IRA, because of course it does, especially
7611.08s:  if it's a Roth IRA, something that's tax deferred, depending on what your tax footprint looks like
7615.80s:  going forward. I'm obviously not a tax professional, not a financial professional, nothing I say.
7620.52s:  Should be taking his financial advice. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. But
7624.60s:  you can look at how an IRA fits into your life because a big drawback to IRAs is when you want to
7632.60s:  access it. And there's kind of a liquidity cost to it because you can't get into them.
7642.12s:  Now going further down the IRA, but hold there's a lot of gaps you can take advantage of.
7648.60s:  There's different rules you can exploit that are perfectly legal. But like for example,
7655.88s:  with an IRA, if you want to access it early, you can use it to buy your house if it's your first
7660.44s:  house. Like towards your first house, there's more rules to it. I don't know, because I never got
7664.52s:  to use it myself. But that's just a way you can tap into it a little bit early. So the tricky part
7671.88s:  with IRAs is it pertains to being a trader is if your aspiration is to retire early,
7677.72s:  which I think that's the whole point of doing this, then an IRA is kind of tricky because you
7682.84s:  definitely want the money there for when you get older, but you also can't access it quite as much.
7689.32s:  TG says I found the Black Sholes Model EM expected move numbers for your DTESPX options are
7694.44s:  very misleading. I don't see how they're misleading. And that's I don't understand how the
7700.68s:  Black Sholes Model in there fits in for you unless you just mean using Black Sholes to derive what
7705.72s:  the expected move is or how you're arriving at the expected move. I'm not sure you have to give me
7710.52s:  more detail than that. Happy to take a look at it, but I do not know exactly what you're referring to.
7719.80s:  Back up to the top paper cut. Tell me why I shouldn't go deep in the money calls three months out
7727.24s:  for Sophie. Seems really good for those right now. Let's see. Let's take a look at some so five.
7736.60s:  I mean, the short answer is because it's going down. If you buy calls, you want the underlying to go
7743.72s:  up and right now the underlying as you see it here is not going up. So that is the short answer
7752.44s:  on why going deep in the money three months out for Sophie may not make sense is because
7761.24s:  it's not going up and idea.
7770.52s:  Roryntitty says what about using Otoco? That's actually this sounds like a dance. That's fun.
7776.84s:  I like that and using my limits and stops it. Yeah, I think that's okay. You can use those
7780.92s:  kinds of orders. So you just have to be really, really careful. And what she's referring to, by the way,
7785.48s:  is a complex order type. And she's linking two of them. So there's a trigger order and then
7794.04s:  there's a cancel. So the idea there is to set up kind of a string of things that automatically
7799.48s:  executes her wishes with respect to an individual position that's on and there's nothing wrong with it.
7804.60s:  You just have to make sure that it's structured really well and it makes sense and you have to
7807.96s:  understand the liquidity impacts of it. I actually talked about a liquidity impact for something as simple
7813.48s:  as a stop limit on zero DTEs that I run. And I think I talked about that during the live session
7820.04s:  Monday, maybe something like that. But yeah, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
7827.48s:  Ries says, would you ever take a bullish stance on hood? Fuck no. Fucking hate Robinhood.
7833.80s:  I hope like this is just before the down move. Like this is all just stupid noise before Robinhood
7841.24s:  goes bankrupt down to zero. That's the only direction that this thing can go. It is the dumbest
7848.12s:  looking stock. I hate its face. I hate the fact that it thinks it can go up when it can't.
7855.24s:  Look at this. Look at this. 10 years ago. Well, it's not that long ago. When was this? 21. High
7862.12s:  85 down to the dirt to nothing. Stupid stock. It's so dumb. So everything about it is stupid.
7874.12s:  Look at this negative. It's got price that yeah, it's just it's a I hate it.
7883.08s:  Stupid stock. 7 to 24. It wishes. So now
7892.44s:  there's no way I can ever be bullish on Robinhood. That's one of my very few things that I've decided
7899.24s:  I will always perpetually hate. And this is now gained my eye which I hate this period. So stupid.
7910.12s:  Nick says Robinhood turned off the buy button. Yeah, I hate that they did that. I hate the way
7914.12s:  that they manage their margin. I hate the way that they route their options. I literally hate their
7918.44s:  face. So yeah, dig it. Back up. Shared where says can you review AMD 19 July
7933.88s:  Xperi does 180 straight look like strong support? I don't know what that means. If like the options
7942.04s:  themselves service support. I don't really know the I don't know your question shared
7948.92s:  where's happy to talk about it, but I don't really know what it means. Michael says do you see shares
7954.68s:  of Nvidia lower by options? I also don't know what that means. Y'all are asking fucking questions
7960.92s:  that I I cannot interpret. Let's see. Do you see shares of Nvidia lower by options?
7972.20s:  Yeah, I've no idea what that means. Do you mean do I I'm super confused?
7982.60s:  Yeah, sorry, Michael, if you can restate your question, I'm happy to answer it, but I have no idea.
7994.76s:  Okay, that's completely different. Can you review options chain AMD July 19 Xperi does look
8001.00s:  bullish? Okay, so the first thing is that the options chain itself isn't what I would worry about
8006.84s:  looking bullish. It's the stock options are derivatives and their value is tied to the stock.
8015.72s:  So in this case, right now in general, it looks like AMD is going through a little bit of a cycling
8026.04s:  period and it looks like it's still ascending, which is good news.
8043.64s:  But it looks like it's rotating over. I do like the moving averages. Those look good.
8048.76s:  Six month timeframe. It's definitely declining. Three month timeframe.
8055.32s:  It's got a nice pop here, but before that, it was relatively static.
8062.04s:  Yeah, so it like very cleanly broke above that 171 handle.
8075.48s:  So this looks like it's kind of rolling over and consolidating a little bit from just like a
8082.76s:  technical perspective. It does look like it's starting to catch a bid probably with the broader tech
8087.40s:  picture, but it's still in a general downslope, which I don't love. That's kind of like wind in its
8093.96s:  face as I would consider it. And then looking at the options in general,
8104.76s:  really, really slight call, oh, I skew very slight though, not much.
8116.84s:  Much more active call trading on the 12 July's really short term. It has earnings coming up
8122.28s:  on the 30th. I think that'll be pretty important. We can see how it's done on its previous earnings.
8129.00s:  Down on the last one down on the one before there up down down up down up.
8139.88s:  So kind of a general split. Earnings has been coming down though, which I don't love.
8148.60s:  What is this January? So January to January though is slightly up. So you're over year there,
8153.56s:  that's not bad. And then April. Yeah. So Cliff Notes version is, it looks kind of like a
8169.64s:  mixed bag. It looks like it's going through a little bit of a consolidation period here. And
8175.80s:  it looks like it's kind of following along with what tech is doing. So Dr. Seis says,
8182.20s:  do you think it's really in a downtrend? I see that downtrend is people taking their profits
8186.36s:  and then finding a temple bottom. It could do that. But again, like, it doesn't matter why it's in
8193.48s:  a downtrend, right? Like a downtrend is a downtrend. It's a thing for a reason. Now in a long term time
8199.48s:  frame, it's very clearly in an uptrend. So like this is okay. But like this here is a downtrend,
8208.28s:  whether it's because they're selling to take profits and it's going to form a bottom here
8212.04s:  if they're selling because they're sad and they want to buy a puppy. It doesn't matter. What matters
8217.72s:  is if you want something to go up and it's going down, you lose money. So the origin of the downtrend
8224.12s:  doesn't matter until it's not a downtrend anymore. So when I look at something like this, it's starting
8231.08s:  to pivot, right? Like this on a six-month daily is a downtrend. It's going down. But it did
8237.88s:  base heavily here. And it is absolutely starting to go up. But it has some near-term resistance
8246.12s:  to break through still. It's facing expanding, selling volume, which really supports your thesis
8254.60s:  in terms of people kind of taking profits and unwinding positions. But in that short-term time frame,
8262.12s:  it very much is in a downtrend. In this case, three months uptrend, for sure. And I think the broader
8271.40s:  component is it really depends on the time frame that like the trade is being looked at for.
8279.48s:  And in this case, short-term time frame, it does not look like this is going to the moon.
8286.52s:  It looks like it had a really large sympathetic move with broader tech. That's a lot of what I see here.
8293.48s:  And it does have earnings coming up on the 30th. So Dr. Zayah says,
8300.52s:  yep, I was looking at it at a longer time frame. Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
8303.48s:  On a longer time frame, it for sure has an uptrend. But that question really goes back to like,
8309.56s:  what's the trade or trying to do? Right? Like if you're trying to trade this thing to the upside
8313.64s:  long term, then yeah, that's totally cool. If you're trying to trade it shorter-term time frames,
8318.76s:  then this looks like it's trying to go up and it looks like it wants to and it looks like it's starting.
8324.36s:  But again, depending on the time frame, it's flattening out here, starting to turn over.
8330.36s:  And then on a six-month time frame, it's again, just starting this breakout phase.
8335.48s:  So a lot of it will depend on how it behaves in here. My expectation would be that it would probably
8341.08s:  base in this level a little bit like 171 to 186 until it can get a break above 186.
8347.08s:  And then my guess is it would want to run up towards here like the 213 to 15 handle, something like that.
8355.56s:  So we will see.
8362.52s:  Growing to the says, can our strategy be do whatever Nancy Pelosi does? How do you back test that?
8366.92s:  Yeah, that is literally an ideal strategy as I think about it. And her timing, I mean, she's just
8375.40s:  literally, you know, she's just so good at timing. It's the kind of like look at it and you're like, man,
8381.16s:  how are you doing so good? And she continues to do just so great. Inspiring really,
8391.32s:  one of the best traders of our lifetime, we think it might be roaring kitty little did we know
8398.12s:  it's Nancy Pelosi and her husband. But you know, that's just because of all the hard work and
8404.36s:  dedication that they put into the craft. It is probably nothing to do with information availability
8411.24s:  or anything like that. There's no way. Impossible. Literally an impossibility.
8416.60s:  All right, you guys, I think this now is my next longest live stream ever. This is almost 2.5 hours,
8424.36s:  but I love this stuff. I love connecting with you guys. I love talking about this all. I do have a
8428.84s:  live stream tomorrow with my boy Newton, where we are going to talk more game stop. We want to get
8435.88s:  a little bit deeper into some more of the structural components behind it. And then we also want to
8440.84s:  spend a bit of time getting into kind of current state analysis of what it's looking like. So that
8447.32s:  is the game plan right now for tomorrow. As always, you guys know what to find me. I'm in her discord.
8453.96s:  You guys should absolutely join if you're not in there. It's completely free to get in. And then
8458.68s:  I will see you guys at the live stream tomorrow. I'll see the outlier pro members during the live
8463.88s:  stream on Sunday. And then I'll see everybody else on the live stream on Monday. We got all sorts of
8469.96s:  shit coming out all the time. So as always, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
