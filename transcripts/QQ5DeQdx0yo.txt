0.00s: What's up everyone?
2.76s: How is everybody doing out there?
5.84s: What's going on to the outliers?
7.84s: We have another options trading for beginners segment
13.00s: on the docket for today.
16.20s: So the goal for this session I have for us right now
21.32s: is to take a much closer look at the end-to-end process
27.68s: of building a trade.
28.88s: So excuse me, we got a bunch of Celterwater.
32.32s: Right now we're doing, what is this one?
35.56s: Strawberry watermelon, this one's pretty good.
37.64s: I like this one.
40.56s: I guess I'm just on a watermelon vibe
42.16s: because my backup one is just regular watermelon.
45.48s: We go through Celterwater here pretty much perpetually.
50.84s: Tons of it.
52.68s: As for always, I'd say hello to who we have.
54.68s: Hang in out.
55.52s: I see Jim, Paulo, Jay, and Elon's songs
58.36s: great to see all of you.
60.68s: And let's do a quick overview of what this is going to look like.
64.12s: So so far with this entire options trading segment
70.16s: for beginners, we've gone through a lot of different things.
73.64s: And I want to talk about the broad context first.
79.48s: We're not going through this whole deck,
80.76s: but I just want to talk to you about a couple of pieces.
84.20s: So here's the deal.
85.92s: There's a bunch of things that go into trading options.
89.12s: First, we need to understand the economy to a degree, the stock market.
93.48s: We need to understand how options behave,
97.44s: the fundamentals behind options.
99.72s: And then we have to start getting to a point
101.64s: where we're pulling together this information into a comprehensive,
108.24s: I guess deployment of them.
110.92s: You have to pull a lot of things together to make this whole thing work.
114.16s: So the goal behind this is to spend a little bit of time
118.48s: going through what that looks like,
120.80s: what the actual process is to come up with an idea
126.80s: and then to start trading it.
128.56s: Because over the course of a trading career,
131.72s: it very infrequently, some people they do hit these one-off wonders
136.00s: that change their entire lives straight from the jump.
138.56s: And then that's essentially what they're using
141.12s: for their primary wealth going forward,
144.48s: meaning essentially hitting the trading lottery is what that's equivalent to.
148.24s: But for most of us, it's not like that.
150.56s: Most of us, it is a long process.
153.44s: And for some of us, at least like me,
155.20s: I want it to be a long process.
156.56s: Not so much I'd love to have, you know,
159.28s: dozens of millions of dollars right now.
162.16s: That would be pretty sick.
163.76s: But I think I also enjoy markets in the process of trading.
168.48s: It's very engaging and it's one of the coolest ways,
172.16s: genuinely, that I have found to learn about the world around us.
177.44s: So that is in a nutshell what I want to spend most of our time on today
183.12s: is working through this broader context of how to essentially build a trading plan
191.36s: and how we can find ideas, build strategies.
195.36s: So taking a quick step back from that, though,
198.96s: with all of the stuff that we've talked about so far,
203.52s: there's been a lot of details.
205.20s: So I do want to offer an opportunity if there are any specific questions
210.80s: or if there's any specific topics that we've covered up to this point
216.16s: that you want to talk about.
218.00s: And I am happy to start there, do a quick catch up.
222.88s: And it looks like we had a couple more people hopping in.
225.12s: I see doku doku doki.
227.20s: That's a fun name.
229.36s: Pat Hader, Jim Reese, Ruta Bega,
234.80s: Bean Gaming, that's a fun one.
236.80s: Pat says not to be that guy, but saw RKDFV type options by 719 Siri.
243.68s: We could do that towards the end.
245.20s: Yeah, I have no problem taking a peek at that.
248.00s: But I want to keep the beginning session a little more focused on the fundamentals.
253.84s: I also think it's really difficult to actually identify like the RK,
260.80s: which is Roryn Kitty for those that don't know,
262.96s: like his buying habits, right?
266.00s: So it could be him.
266.88s: It could not be him.
267.60s: I haven't looked at Siri at all.
268.56s: I have no idea at this point.
269.68s: I looked at it last weekend.
271.28s: But happy to either take a look at it later today and see what we can maybe piece together.
280.48s: Ben Waz here, fly high and enjoy.
282.88s: That's a fun one.
284.00s: And then Jaden, sweet.
285.52s: All right.
286.16s: So I'm not seeing a bunch of catch up questions.
288.80s: So I think that that means that we can get more into,
292.00s: oh, there we go.
292.64s: Reese, perfect timing.
295.04s: Daniel, good to see you as well.
296.56s: Reese says how important is margin?
298.40s: It's a great question.
300.32s: And in terms of importance,
304.16s: margin is what I would consider to be a force multiplier.
309.04s: So Reese, what you're talking about there,
311.76s: there's two different things.
313.60s: There's trading with margin trading on margin.
317.28s: However you want to phrase it,
318.64s: there's kind of different utilization of margin.
322.80s: And options utilize a specific type where we're not actually borrowing money.
330.64s: So let's take a look at an example.
333.84s: If we take a look, maybe at spy.
338.16s: And we take a look at the options in spy.
343.44s: Here is a nutshell of trading with margin.
350.80s: If I want to open and let's say I want to sell a put,
358.08s: it's a cash secured put.
359.76s: So if you don't remember,
362.00s: a cash secured put is where you sell a put option.
367.28s: And you're putting up the capital to cover the options position.
372.16s: So in this case, that means that you would have to buy 100 shares of spy at 5.52.
380.80s: So if you're to cash secure the position, it's $55,200.
387.28s: That's if you want to essentially cash secure the position.
390.64s: Now, if I go to actually put this trade on,
394.08s: and again, this is in a pass through account for me.
396.56s: So I don't have any positions on in here.
398.56s: But I think this one is standard margin.
401.68s: If I'm not mistaken, we'll see.
405.04s: If we sell a put, let's see what this asks of me.
410.00s: Just this.
412.56s: Yeah, so this is for this is a pass through retirement account.
415.44s: So the margin required here essentially is full margin.
419.68s: It wants.
421.68s: So this isn't this isn't using really any leverage at all.
425.52s: That's like an example of a cash secure put.
427.28s: Now if we go on on demand really fast,
429.60s: and we look at spy, yeah, this is a great example.
431.76s: Let me get me out of the way.
433.92s: I'll go top right.
435.92s: And if you take a look at the margin required for this trade now,
440.16s: that we are outside of a retirement account,
443.20s: which requires essentially posting the full trading capital for the position in that
448.96s: example, you'll notice that the margin requirement for the position is only $16,800.
455.04s: So what that means is the broker is saying this position, it knows what this position is worth
462.64s: in its entirety. The broker knows the reason why it's moving, by the way,
466.16s: is because this is on demand.
467.28s: I don't want you guys thinking something squirrely is going on after hours.
470.48s: It's not.
471.68s: But so what this is saying is in this example now, the broker requires $17,300.
478.88s: So even though this position is controlling $55,000 of spy,
485.68s: the broker is only asking for $17,300.
488.96s: So you're not actually borrowing any money from the broker,
492.24s: and you very well might have the $55,000 to cash secure this position.
498.00s: But in this world of trading options, you're not borrowing money.
503.44s: Your broker is just not requiring you to set aside the maximum value of a position.
510.64s: They're asking for what we would call a margin requirement, which is just a smaller subset
515.60s: of the total value of that position.
517.60s: And once that's satisfied, then the broker is chill.
520.88s: They have what they need to cover their risk.
523.44s: It's important to know that margin moves.
526.00s: So as the market goes up and goes down, as the broker perceives their risk moving,
533.84s: your margin requirement will also change.
536.72s: It's not a static figure.
539.12s: So margin is important for a few reasons.
542.64s: It's the primary modality that leverage is afforded to you in options.
550.56s: So let's give another example not using puts now.
554.80s: And let's take a look at calls.
557.12s: So in this example, if I wanted to buy these calls here,
562.24s: the $551, I just picked a random one.
565.12s: Right now, these are at a $70.
567.28s: So if you'll remember, every single options contract moves in 100 share lots.
574.16s: So this is a one lot, and it comprises up to $100 shares.
578.88s: Essentially, with this being a $70 delta, that means that this position currently
585.20s: is behaving similarly to $70 shares of spy.
591.12s: So if we were to buy $70 shares at, let's just use the strike price for example,
596.32s: which in this case is $551 times $70, $38,570.
604.64s: That's what it would cost.
606.08s: If you were to buy the share equivalent of this position,
609.04s: you have to put up $38,570.
612.88s: However, if you were to buy the option, it costs $1,531.
621.36s: So again, you're not borrowing money here,
623.92s: but this is the leverage afforded to you through options.
628.96s: So there's a difference to recap between trading on margin or trading with margin.
637.12s: When you are on margin, you are borrowing money actively, and you have to pay a rate
642.24s: to borrow the money.
643.68s: If you're trading with margin, which all options positions do,
648.32s: in that instance, you're essentially benefiting from the leverage provided to you,
653.60s: but you're not actually borrowing any money.
656.00s: Reese says if you don't have cash in your account,
659.60s: can you specify you want to sell a cash secured put
662.72s: and unmargin and not cash secured?
665.84s: If you do have the cash, it's a great question.
668.40s: So Reese, the follow up to your question
670.72s: and for anybody else wondering what we're talking about now,
673.20s: Reese is asking, can you tell your broker
676.00s: if you want to sell your cash secured put on margin and not cash secured?
680.80s: The broker is going to default to unmargin.
684.40s: So if I have a marginable account, again, this is a pass through IRA,
689.52s: so it automatically requires full cash secured.
692.08s: So if I go into on demand and we look at this position,
698.32s: what day are we?
698.96s: I'm actually just curious what this is.
700.32s: Oh, this is looking at the first of July this month.
702.96s: Cool.
703.84s: I don't know why I find that cool, but I do.
705.84s: So if we're to look at this fake trade,
708.56s: the, let me, might still out of the way.
712.72s: Yeah, okay, I'm still top right good.
714.56s: So if we're a little look at this fake trade,
719.44s: margin requirement to put this trade on is $15,477.
724.48s: That's the default.
725.92s: So if you have a marginable account,
728.56s: the broker, depending on the permissions you have,
731.76s: I should clarify because there's different levels of options permissions.
735.44s: So if you have like the highest tier,
739.60s: I honestly don't even know what they go up to anymore
743.60s: or what those actually look like.
744.80s: And I just realized this is like now.
749.76s: One second.
764.88s: I just realized this thing like totally cut my head off.
774.40s: There we go.
775.60s: There we go.
777.36s: I think we're getting back at it, team.
781.36s: I think we're getting back at it.
783.76s: All right.
785.60s: How did the back of the computer look like, by the way?
788.40s: I had to like reroute the cable really fast.
790.72s: Back to the question though, the broker will automatically
798.00s: essentially just use the margin requirement for the position.
803.76s: They do not care if you want to cash secure it.
807.28s: You would have to notify them yourself that you want to cash secure the position.
814.24s: That's essentially how it would work.
816.80s: So the beautiful part about that is the broker is automatically giving you the benefit of the doubt.
823.36s: The negative side to that is then you have to have good accounting.
827.68s: If you're looking to track cash secured positions versus non,
832.00s: the broker doesn't do that for you automatically.
836.40s: So Reese, let me know if that answers your question.
839.36s: Ruta Bega says, how do you tell if an option is currently cheaper, expensive to buy?
846.08s: That's another great question.
847.84s: So for this one, there's a couple different assessments you can use in terms of determining
853.52s: if an option is cheaper, expensive.
855.28s: There's one primary input we care about, which is volatility.
859.36s: So there's a couple of things you can do to look at that.
862.40s: So let's take a look at, let's find a random stock, something that we
868.64s: don't know much about. I'm just going to go into the scan and pick something.
873.84s: Walmart. Most of us know about Walmart. I don't really know what's going on in here.
879.20s: We'll get a sense of it. And let me zoom us out to like a six-month daily something like that.
886.56s: And
889.92s: Reese says, thanks so much, Margin. Sounded like running up a credit card and as a fellow poor kid,
894.48s: always seemed like a trap to me. It's actually hilarious, you say that because I always struggled
901.12s: massively with the concept of borrowing money from a broker to put on more trades.
908.16s: Like that kind of leverage terrified me. So I essentially would very rarely, very rarely use
915.52s: Margin. It's, I totally identify with you.
920.16s: Rude of Aiga back to your question. So let's figure out if these options are expensive or not.
927.68s: What do you guys think the first thing I'm going to look at now on the platform?
932.40s: You guys have any ideas? There's a couple things that I will look for.
939.20s: And the goal is to figure out how expensive these options are.
946.72s: So what can we do to figure that out? We can start with a broad assessment, which is what we're
952.80s: going to start with. And then we can get more into specifics. Pat says, oh,
957.76s: I, it's a great idea, but that's not correct. Oh, I, which is an option's open interest,
963.44s: that's not actually going to tell us if something is expensive or not.
969.04s: Benoit and Reese are on it as well as Eddie, both, both of those groups are on it. So you guys
976.88s: are right on top of it. Peter says implied volatility, which is good.
985.92s: What a hell of a name. I am now the biggest fan of this new name, which is overmoicin't meat loaf.
994.80s: It's fantastic. Is the golden shower crossover? No, that, you know, I tell you what,
1001.04s: that sounds like a hell of a crossover though, but that sounds also like a crossover between
1006.24s: trading and some other endeavors. But no, it's not that either. So we have a couple ideas
1012.56s: stemming from implied volatility, which is perfect. Benoit is on it. Reese is on it. Eddie is on it.
1018.72s: Those are all correct answers. So Reese is saying versus HV, I would delete that part
1025.28s: Reese because that doesn't help you. The first answer of IV is much closer to being correct. So
1031.04s: let's take a look at it. If we go back to our options pricing model, I started building this
1038.96s: like deck for you guys, which is funny because I never use slides. I don't like them very much,
1045.28s: especially for my time as a consultant with Deloitte. I don't really like to spend a lot of time
1050.80s: in them, but this thing is starting to become a bear. I'm using it to kind of have all of the
1056.00s: stuff we need in one single spot. So anyways, if we go back somewhere in here, we have pricing models.
1065.12s: Here. So when we look at an option pricing model and let me maybe make this bold,
1073.20s: maybe underlines what's a little easier to see. There's a very important input, which you could
1078.48s: tell I have highlighted, which is volatility because all of these things are kind of known and
1083.92s: they're relative to the underlying at a point in time. If we're assessing if an option is expensive,
1089.52s: this is what we care about, volatility. This is the primary input that will change beyond other
1097.04s: kind of known standard effects, how relatively expensive an option is. So if we move this over here,
1107.76s: and let's take a look first at the implied volatility. So for Walmart, the implied volatility is
1113.84s: up here, 26.24%. Is that expensive? Is it cheap? We don't really know. That's why I frame it that way.
1126.56s: It's just a number. Implied volatility in this sense is just telling us the expectation of price
1133.68s: movement. That's all. So we can't really tell. We can't decipher from this. If that means that
1139.84s: the options are cheaper expensive, we don't know yet. What we can use is something like implied
1146.80s: volatility percentile or implied volatility rank. I much prefer implied volatility percentile.
1154.08s: It is much less prone to skew. I think that that matters. So going off of that thread, and I think
1163.20s: in here, actually, if I'm not mistaken, we have something in here about implied volatility percentile.
1169.04s: Valtuity. Yeah, here we go. Look at, see, I told you, this thing is becoming like the ultimate
1176.08s: reference guide for most things. So here, I'm showing you the difference between implied volatility
1182.16s: percentile calculation and implied volatility rank. The problem with implied volatility rank
1188.72s: is based on the way that it's calculated. It is very prone to remaining skewed when there's a
1194.72s: really large move. IV percentile is much less prone to skew. Because what we're doing is we're
1203.36s: taking the current implied volatility and we're seeing how high it is relative to a reference
1212.88s: time frame. And as you guys always know, I dime out any time YouTube wants me to insert an ad to
1222.88s: which we say, nay, we do not insert ads for YouTube. They probably have not a big fan because I'm
1229.04s: not making them as much money, but whatever. I think ad here would also be annoying. It is funny,
1234.80s: though, it literally does this giant pop up and it asks you a million times when you're doing these.
1240.56s: It's always like, do you want us to insert the ads for you? Do you want us to insert the ads for you?
1245.52s: I bet they would like to insert the ads for us.
1251.84s: So to recap so far, we can start with implied volatility. Things with high implied volatility
1258.48s: will tend to be more expensive. Even on a, I'm like a broad basis. Ben Wants says there's
1266.88s: got to be an extension to auto dismiss those. I bet the problem with that extension, though, is it
1271.12s: probably also tracks every single personal detail that I have, which is not worth me not at least
1278.72s: making a small comment about the thing when it pops up. Manscape Goat says,
1287.52s: wait, what's the flavor of the day? Oh, right now we're drinking. This is actually my wife's
1295.36s: preferred one so far. We have a straw, I don't know why that would be difficult for the camera to
1303.60s: see. This one is strawberry watermelon and then our backup for today is standard watermelon.
1310.56s: This guy, the standard watermelon is admittedly my favorite, but this strawberry watermelon is pretty
1317.36s: good. Still a fan. Overmoistened meatloaf, this is the hottest stream I've ever seen. That's also.
1328.00s: Well, I'm really, really glad overmoistened meatloaf that this is really getting your juices
1334.40s: flowing because I tell you what, anybody that gets stoked about options like to that, you're my
1340.16s: kind of person to be honest because this is, yeah, I mean, this is, this is my deal. This is what I do.
1347.52s: So any chance to talk about options with somebody else that even potentially gets turned on by them.
1352.80s: I'm here for it. So back to this implied volatility on our gross level. If it's high,
1359.92s: the options are going to be more expensive. So if IV in this thing is let's say 15%
1369.04s: then if that's compared to something with IV that is 54%, the 54% IV options are absolutely going
1378.96s: to be more expensive. Now, when you're comparing within an individual product, so in this case,
1386.72s: we're looking at Tesla. If we compare the price of Tesla relative to itself, this means that the
1395.44s: implied volatility percentile gives us that metric and it lets us know how expensive IV is relative
1402.40s: to just Tesla. And in this case, the options would be relatively expensive in general. We're still
1409.52s: in the macro view, the higher level view. So quick recap. If IV is high, in general, as a gross
1419.84s: figure, cross products options become more expensive. Implied volatility percentile gives us a
1426.48s: relative understanding of a products IV relative to itself. If implied volatility percentile is high,
1434.24s: then its options are correspondingly going to be more expensive. That's the macro level view.
1443.28s: Now to get into the micro level view, I guess we'll just use Tesla to keep the example going.
1451.04s: Wow, and it's even better now. Check this out. IVP is 98%. This is actually kind of a cool example.
1457.12s: Let's bring this back over real fast. So in this timeframe when I looked at it, IV was 54% with IVP
1466.96s: of 58%. Now it's 68.4% with IVP of 98%. So now options are really expensive on a relative basis.
1478.24s: Interesting. So if we come in here, and we take a look at the options, let's go first at the
1490.56s: expiration cycles. So this is, and if you've been watching any of the GME videos I've been doing,
1496.48s: which again, even if you're not necessarily super into the GME story as I am, obviously,
1502.88s: there's still a lot of really good information about options analysis in general in there.
1508.24s: So I recommend that you check them out. They're not that long. It's like 10 minutes and I'm
1511.28s: launching almost one a day at this rate. But one of the things you've seen me look at in a lot of
1516.24s: them is this. This is the implied volatility for each expiration cycle. So we can see, for example,
1526.56s: that this 12 July, which was today, had 81.66% vol. The expiration cycle for 19 July is down to 63.62%.
1537.52s: But then the next expiration cycle is back up to 83.55. So what can we infer from here?
1547.04s: That these options, this chain on a relative basis to the product, and specifically to these
1554.16s: other options chains is cheaper. So this is another click down on assessing the
1561.84s: expansiveness of an option. So we now know the macro picture from the underlying itself. We now
1568.56s: know based on expiration cycles where I can find cheaper options. So in this case, we see these
1575.92s: options out here are 60.09%. They're relatively cheap. I think I clicked the, yeah, I got the right one.
1582.16s: So now there's one final layer we can click into, which is the individual option. You can find
1589.84s: where where options are relatively cheap or more expensive. Now what you'll find first is typically
1597.36s: speaking, the IV will expand as you go further out and in the money. So generally speaking,
1608.08s: there will be cheaper volatility at the money. So with this, you can look for slight anomalies
1617.20s: and see if there's a period where you can go a little further out in time and actually find
1622.16s: cheaper IV like this one right here. So as I look at this 25 delta put, notice how the volatility
1629.92s: leading into that put, I see 56 and a quarter, 56, 21 and then 56, 18 and then it bounces back
1637.20s: up to 56, 32%. So these are relatively cheap in this product where the expiration cycle writ
1644.88s: large is looking at 60% vol. You can find 56, I'm sorry, 60% vol. You can find 56.18% vol.
1655.12s: So this is where volatility is cheaper. So a bit of a long answer, but I wanted to give you guys
1664.00s: a bunch of different ways of looking at this. So let me see. Reese says seems odd to have less
1674.00s: vol and longer dated expiration. The high IV of September should appear in October. No, not
1680.24s: necessarily. It's all based on expectations. The other tool that you have is this and we can look
1685.92s: at the implied volatility for either the average of the options. Let me get rid of this near-term
1693.28s: expiration because it's skewing everything and all these crazy lines being all kinked like this.
1698.00s: This actually, that's a ton of trading opportunities from a vol traders perspective, especially this
1702.08s: blue one, that 19 July, that's nuts. If you got here to 19 July, that's super tradable. All that's
1708.56s: super tradable. There's relative values there, but I don't want to get too far in the weeds there.
1712.72s: I just caught my eye. So you can look at the relative cheapness or
1717.68s: expansiveness of maybe out the money options versus in the money options. You can look at relative
1722.96s: pricing, but this is more for a different style of trading. I just want you to know it exists.
1727.44s: But what you're looking here is a volatility surface. It's not as pretty as the 3D models,
1732.56s: but it gives you the same information. Seeing things that include crossovers,
1738.56s: like this 19 July to 26 July, I can see that pretty clear as day. So if I clear everything out and
1744.08s: just show you those, this right here, that's a tradable event. This entire thing is a tradable event.
1750.72s: So there's a lot of different opportunities with trading vol
1755.04s: directly, but that's not what your question was. It was more about the
1760.80s: expansiveness of options. So give me a random ticker, and then I will run through this whole process
1768.16s: because I know that that seems like a lot, but it takes less than two minutes. So if you give me a
1773.68s: random ticker, something not that we look at all the time, I will pull it up and then I will assess
1780.32s: the options for you real time. SMCI game. Let's take a look at SMCI.
1790.00s: SMCI. All right. So the first thing I notice is we are trending sideways. So the reason why that
1796.56s: matters to me is because if we have big drops in price, I inherently know volatility tends to be higher.
1803.60s: So I scouts honor. I haven't looked at the top corner yet, but when I look at this, I see something
1810.16s: that went through a drop and has been trending sideways. So I would expect volatility to be low.
1816.88s: However, it is earnings coming up. So my expectation of vol in that case would be actually much higher.
1824.72s: So IVP 71%. So that doesn't surprise me. So what I'm doing is quickly using the chart to get a
1832.80s: sense of how price is moving that will inform a little bit of where how volatile or how expensive
1840.80s: options can be. Now I looked at IV in IVP. The other thing I notice is IV and this is 88%.
1847.12s: On a gross amount that is a relatively high number. If I give you a comparison really quick, like GE,
1856.16s: 38%. And look at this. The IV and GE is 38%. The IV percentile is 97%. So what this is telling you
1866.40s: in GE, even though IV is only 38, that's crazy expensive for what this is on a relative basis.
1873.44s: Okay, so back to SMCI. First thing, price down tells me vol typically a little bit higher.
1879.44s: Trending sideways would tell me vol probably contracting. Earnings coming up tells me vol probably higher.
1886.08s: Now I can skip all of that. I'm just walking through my actual thought process out loud.
1892.00s: Now I look at IV, 88% gross number is high, tells me expensive. IVP 71% tells me expensive.
1902.32s: Go into the options chain. I look at the expiration cycles. I see front is cheap. The next two cycles
1910.24s: expensive, slightly cheaper, more expensive all the way out until we get about here. And I notice
1916.48s: this is actually a slight anomaly. These options in this expiration cycle being this low relative
1924.00s: to the others, same with the 68%. These tell me these two on a relative basis are quite cheap.
1931.04s: So if I wanted to buy options, I might look at something a little further out and then you have
1936.72s: to go into liquidity and all that shit. But I'm just letting you know from IV perspective, I can see
1943.76s: what's expensive versus what's not. Like this in here is expensive. It's essentially the top end
1949.84s: of the options chain. So depending on what kind of trade I'm looking to put on, I either might
1954.96s: want them to be expensive or I might want them to be cheap. Depending on what scenario I would
1959.20s: either go there or here. So now going out here to the 20 December and a quick assessment of the
1967.44s: options, I see that there's actually very, very slight call skew in terms of all. So when I look
1976.96s: at these and it's also because of Delta, actually. So let me redact that and look at seem to seem
1982.64s: comparison 75. Yes, still there. So what I'm doing now is I'm comparing the same Delta options. I
1990.24s: see a 31 Delta put here and I see a 31 Delta call way out here. The 31 Delta call has 75.6%
2000.56s: vol. The 31 Delta put has 72.99%. Very often you'll see the inverse. The market tends to price
2010.08s: in the downside way more heavily than the upside. But when you're looking at individual tickers like
2015.44s: this or even if you've been following what I've been looking at with GameStop, they tend to be skewed
2020.64s: actually quite a lot. So if I now have a pretty comprehensive picture of how expensive volatility is.
2030.48s: So let me know specifically I think Reese that was originally your question. Let me know if that
2037.92s: answers your question. I hope that going through that exercise is useful for you.
2043.68s: Let me take a quick look at some of these other questions and then by the way, if you drop a
2048.80s: question further up and I miss it, don't feel for don't don't be bashful. Drop it back in. I kind
2054.08s: of just try to keep up with what's flowing through so that I'm not flipping all the way up because it
2058.96s: takes time. But Mr. Squish mellow, AMC Squish mellow, that's a hilarious name. How do you identify the
2066.96s: delta of a contract when you are swapping only fans pages in the open up market? That confused me.
2075.52s: But I would probably direct most of your attention to the only fans pages and not worry so much
2081.12s: about the delta. That would be my guess. Ben Wallace says what is expensive really mean here premium
2089.84s: paid per delta? You could look at it that way. It essentially just means how expensive the balls are.
2095.36s: Right? Like that's at the end of the day when you're trading options, you're trading
2098.64s: vol to some degree or to another. That's really you're seeing how expensive the ball is that you're
2104.32s: transacting at. That's the easiest way to think about it. Carlos says what platform? This is
2112.88s: think or swim. I still find that so novel that so many people aren't really used to looking at
2118.56s: think or swim. It's fascinating to me. It's not a dig at anybody. It's just because obviously it's
2123.60s: telling me that I'm becoming an old head at my right page of 33 because when I look at like
2128.88s: primary trading platforms, this is so popular. But I guess most people are used to
2132.96s: use and stuff like Robin Hood now in Wee Bowl. Very interesting.
2142.24s: Ben Wallace says so the price per expected tick change. I wouldn't even think of it as in terms
2146.00s: of expected tick change. It's okay to look at that right because that's what delta is telling you.
2150.00s: It's literally just telling you how expensive the balls are that you're trading.
2153.60s: That's essentially it. Rolando says but if you do a little TA, you can see that a chart is really
2158.64s: looking. Oh, I think I missed a I have to go back up. Rolando says I have a question. Why did you
2165.04s: sell your options today? I understand your strategy is more conservative and you swing trading.
2170.72s: But if you do a little TA, you can see the chart is looking really good for next week. Mac,
2174.16s: D cross. Yeah, so a couple things. And he's referring to the GME trade. I still have a position
2183.12s: on. As I said, like I still have right now. I still have long shares and I do have options
2191.68s: in it still. I just wasn't able to establish the position I wanted out here in 18 October. I have
2199.20s: exposure now in 20 September. So the only thing I did was take in my 16 augs. And the reason for
2205.52s: that is because they're starting to get to a point where on a relative basis on the remaining
2212.32s: value of the options, it's going to decay much faster. So it means that I need bigger moves in order
2219.84s: for this to stay essentially where I want. So I had a pretty decent price accommodation from where
2227.76s: I entered the trade. It's for me, like I said in the video, like I'm a trader, right? And my job
2234.88s: is to make money. So I look at something that is made money. It's slowing down. It's up move.
2241.04s: And I do have kind of the rest of the exposure that I want at the time. So yeah, that's
2247.76s: literally exactly why. What you don't want to do with options is wait too long, especially if you're
2252.72s: buying them. If you're buying options, it's really, really difficult to strike a balance in terms
2260.80s: of an expected return, which we can talk about that a little bit. But it's important to remember that
2268.32s: you literally are holding a decaying asset, right? It's something that's disappearing in your hands.
2274.64s: And if you hold on to it for too long, you lose a decent amount of the value. Even though I tend to go
2280.88s: in the money, there's still extrinsic value in those options that's decaying away. So for example,
2287.20s: if we go out here to the 20 steps, you can see that even really high delta options, let's use
2295.20s: something like this. The 20s, they're, you know, bid 730 offered at eight. But of that, you know,
2303.84s: whatever, seven and a half or three, I don't know where you would get filled in here. I noticed that
2309.52s: the markets tend to be pretty liquid, meaning you're not going to get hit at the mid, especially if
2316.16s: you're buying, you're probably going to be a little more offer heavy. That's what I've noticed at
2319.76s: least. And in that, if I'm looking to gain exposure to GameStop and I'm buying calls,
2327.44s: let's say I take them in for seven 80 something like that. And of that seven 80, at least a dollar
2338.56s: 20 or so is extrinsic value that's going, that's bleeding out of the position. So that means as time
2347.04s: is passing, this is slowly coming out of my, that's adding drag to my returns. So that means I
2354.24s: need GameStop to move more to compensate for what I'm losing on Theta decay. That starts to
2361.52s: accelerate as you're closer in time. I actually have neat little again, I told you like this thing is
2368.80s: becoming like the, the everything reference with that is showing you though is this.
2376.24s: As we start getting within 60 days on a relative basis, Theta decay really accelerates as extrinsic
2383.36s: value approximates to zero as we get nearer the expiration. So that is in a nutshell why I adjusted
2392.48s: the position I did. So if there's any follow on questions to that, let me know.
2399.52s: Bryce asked, have a question about GME options. So let's say the market has a huge squeeze to the
2404.08s: upside next week and the option is for October. Wouldn't this create difficulty for selling since
2409.44s: it's far out? Nope. The a couple things. The first thing is if we, there's some sort of like really
2415.44s: big move, all options will become slightly less liquid. So volatility is lifeblood. You need
2424.24s: volatility. Volatility is what brings people in to even create a baseline liquidity. But if
2432.00s: volatility expands a lot, let's say based on really big moves in GameStop, if that happens,
2438.96s: volatility will, the market makers are going to widen the markets. And this is largely to protect
2444.88s: themselves. Otherwise, they can get ran over. I know a lot of people want to look at the market
2448.96s: makers and make them out to be the bad guy. And I'm not saying that they're all angels. They
2453.36s: definitely have their motivations. But they still have pretty difficult periods to manage risk,
2460.32s: especially in like really hyperbolic markets. So if vol starts skyrocketing, whether because
2469.04s: the market is flying up or the market's crashing down, the market makers are going to widen those
2474.88s: bit-ask spreads and everything will become wide. Now to your point, if you go further out in time,
2482.72s: it naturally is less liquid. So if we look at these seven day options, let's find us 80 delta
2489.36s: I see them here at the 24s and I see them bid 244 offered 260. If I go out here to the same 81 delta
2500.16s: ish, this is an 80 delta, their bid 795 offered at a 20. That's actually really that's tight on a
2507.68s: relative basis. So this actually looks pretty good now. But the further out in time you go,
2514.88s: the wider those markets tend to get. So this is another great example. If we go out now to the 20
2520.72s: junes, you'll see that the 79 delta closes to 81 that we have bid 1040 offered 11 and 75.
2529.84s: So you will fight some level of liquidity to answer braces question, but it's not like that's
2537.20s: going to murder your ability to make any money. It just means you're going to take a bigger haircut
2542.64s: getting out of the position and we can go back. I mean, we literally we have time. We can go into
2548.00s: on demand. Let's go to the 14th and let's check out like maybe midday. Let's go to on demand.
2560.96s: This is of May. May 14th about midday take us to like 11.
2572.72s: And let's see. Let's see what these options we're looking like.
2590.32s: And this is crazy. Notice how crazy that looks right now they get the ball just
2595.60s: fucking jacking up here nuts. All right. I guess it would have been better if I showed us a comparison.
2604.56s: Yeah, that's shame on me. Let's do like, oh, God, these options are so weird. There we go.
2610.88s: Yeah, so let me take us a couple days back to for a comparison. Let's go to 30 April.
2616.96s: So what I want to do is show you guys on a relative basis what happens even if the underlying
2629.36s: jacks to the upside. I want to show you what happens to the options in terms of liquidity.
2638.72s: So in this case, let's update this to that. So in this case, if we go to the at the money, the
2645.04s: elevenths right now, they're bid at 102 offered at 110. So that's eight cents wide.
2652.40s: Now the first thing I want to inform you guys on is that this is actually really wide for such a
2659.84s: cheap product. But these options are also really, really elevated for such a cheap product.
2665.84s: It's actually like completely fascinating. It's one of the reasons why this thing is so fun for
2670.72s: me to look at because it does a lot of very strange things. So even though this is only eight cents
2678.08s: wide on a relative basis for an $11 product, that's a big bid-ask spread. I, so now we go back
2687.04s: to me. What was I said? The 14th and we'll look at the at the monies. And then I think they were,
2694.24s: I just want to use like a solid comparison. We'll go to the 21 June's that are 38 days out.
2702.88s: And then let's grab like 25. Okay, so we're not seeing anything here that's kind of annoying.
2709.36s: Maybe 31's. No, that's kind of annoying. Let me see.
2714.96s: So you can already tell how weird this is, right? Like I can't even find out of the money options
2719.60s: to look at with you guys. I'm trying to find options that are around like 55 delta.
2724.08s: But it's behaving so crazily. Let me see if I get it closer to the open before it went through
2730.96s: all of this madness. Let's do like 0900. That's still already went through the madness.
2740.08s: Maybe I'll go one day before.
2745.52s: And I know that it shows up in the 17 Mays so we can look at those two if we have to.
2749.68s: I wanted to give you guys a, yeah, this is fine. This will work.
2754.64s: So here are your 51 delta's. They're down here. And it is the 50 choose.
2768.48s: And their bid 780 offered 805. So in this case, damn it, they moved.
2776.16s: Here we go. So the 34's. And the 35's. The 35's are crazy wide, right?
2783.52s: So right now if we look at the 34's, they're 5550 to 575. So 25 cents wide.
2790.56s: So even though price went up pretty significantly, the value of the same delta option is skyrocketed.
2800.96s: And if you look at this next option, it's bid at 355 offered at 635. So this is the market's widening
2809.20s: their liquidity. So if we go further out in time, let's do like these 19 July's, you'll see that
2816.08s: they're also wide, but they're not like not tradable wide. They're just wide. So in this case,
2822.88s: the 25's, their bid 1070 offered 1165. So you're taking a dollar haircut essentially. That's not
2829.36s: insignificant, but this doesn't necessarily decrease your ability to transact here. So that is
2839.92s: that's that. I forgot who asked that question, but let me know if that answers it to the shadow,
2846.96s: quite man, this is crazy. The volume here is just so it's literally incredible to look at. It's
2853.36s: nuts. Let me know if that answers your question. Nick says, Reece says, do you have core investments
2863.04s: you plan to hold indefinitely? No, I do not have that. I am a trader. So I trade everything.
2871.84s: Even the retirement accounts I have, I trade those. Yeah, I trade everything. I have no attachment
2879.92s: to individual products. And I actually care a lot about trying to maximize the return potential,
2886.08s: which holding indefinitely doesn't do that for me. So no, not for me.
2894.72s: MK says, can you give an explanation on how it is better to understand option premiums?
2900.96s: I'm trying to deconstruct how notorious, ripy, see, I don't know who the fuck that is.
2906.88s: Is there something market makers do on premiums on specific strikes?
2912.32s: I'd love to answer, but I don't understand your question. When you say better understand option
2921.52s: premiums, I don't know what that means. Do you mean like how they're built or something else?
2928.56s: Rama says, thank you for the content, learning a ton. That's awesome. Feel pretty comfortable with
2934.48s: the first order Greeks. That's great. Rama says, I've been selling covered calls,
2939.92s: selling cash secured puts and it's been profitable. What would you suggest suggest as my immediate
2945.28s: next steps in learning do need to learn iron condors, etc. Great question. So this is what I would do.
2953.12s: Literally, I would follow this guide. And I will share it. This is available literally for
2958.32s: everybody for free. There's nothing paid in here. But I wanted to give people a something you
2964.16s: can follow along. So this is what I would do. If you know a couple of those strategies, so it looks
2969.92s: like you're in here, this you can see what I like to do. So these are, this is the direction that I
2978.08s: would go personally. But yeah, that's the short answer to that one.
2983.84s: Rama says, how do you think about diversification? Yeah, that's a great question. So diversification is
2994.48s: super important, but too much of it's also not good, which I think is kind of a slept on concept.
3002.80s: The reason being is because there are people that I know and I've come across quite a lot of them
3010.88s: that they'll have a bunch of positions on, but each position is worth 1% of the portfolio.
3018.24s: So sure, they're hell of diversified. However, if you're too diversified, even if you get a nice
3024.72s: big move in your favor, you don't make any money. So in my opinion, the concept of diversification
3032.64s: really, really, really comes down to striking a balance, making sure that you have enough
3038.00s: diversification to make sure that you align with your objectives, but you're not too diversified
3044.64s: and you're not making any money if you're getting moves. So yeah.
3051.12s: Ruta Begas says, since they did a case exponentially, should you just move your position further
3056.48s: in, in every time it starts accelerating? So first, I take your question to mean under the
3065.92s: assumption of your buying options. And if you're buying options, you can institute kind of a
3073.68s: structure so that when theta starts eating too much of your lunch, you move your options out.
3079.28s: It's literally exactly what I did today in the 16 augs. I could have waited another few days,
3084.88s: like we're not within 30 days, which is my specific window where I really want to start doing
3090.64s: something, but it lined up well with the price movement. So that's it's not like a discrete,
3100.72s: always do it a set kind of way. And it's because it's market dependent on what the market's doing.
3105.52s: But yeah, absolutely. If you gain exposure in the 90 ADT, 70 DT, the 49, whatever you want,
3111.52s: you could pick a time frame that as it starts getting closer to that, you want to get out. Now,
3116.64s: again, there's a million ways to do this. And I want to make sure that you guys understand that
3120.40s: I'm talking to you from my perspective, because there's also something to be said for coming within
3125.84s: 30 days. And you can still trade options in this time frame. I do periodically. It's just not my
3133.36s: go to. So when I'm talking to you guys from like this broader sense of generalities, that's what I'm
3139.52s: sharing. But there's absolutely nothing that's going to break you. If you come in here to a 14 day
3145.12s: trade, 14 DTE, if you think your move is going to occur in 14 DTEs, and you can go super deep
3153.76s: in the money. You can buy these 87 Delta's, or most of these are not super liquid. I don't love
3159.36s: them. Maybe these 22 Delta, the 22 strike calls that are bid for 20 gigat, and they're offered at
3166.00s: 465. But on these, you're literally just paying like 30 cents, 35 cents. So you're not on a
3174.24s: relative basis that's pretty high theta decay for what's going to come out of them. But it's still
3179.92s: as a gross dollar amount that's not going to kill you. So that's why this game of picking strikes or
3188.24s: selecting explorations is so cool. Is because you have the ability to really structure positions
3197.44s: that align with what you're trying to do. So I just dropped another video in there about buying call
3206.88s: option smarter. It uses GameStop as a reference, but it's not limited to GameStop. It's about kind of
3213.76s: this process. How to strike a balance between DTEs, Delta's, because as we talked about before,
3220.00s: we know that if you pick up a higher Delta, your option is going to be more expensive. So how do you
3225.44s: figure out how high you want to go? The neat part about it is you literally can develop a pretty
3234.56s: simple system that looks at what makes sense based on your objectives for the position.
3243.52s: That's the way to think about it. At least I think that's the way that I try to think about the decision.
3252.00s: Ruta Vegas says since they did a case, oh, I already answered that one. That's cool.
3257.84s: All right, cool. Oh, yeah. Paul says, do you build Delta neutral portfolios?
3261.84s: You use some other portfolio strategy. No, I do not build Delta neutral portfolios.
3266.32s: I think the concept of Delta neutral portfolios sounds so appealing because people get nervous
3271.12s: about risk and they like the idea of being able to make money in all markets and shit like that.
3276.56s: But the way I think about building like the portfolio disposition is 100% tied to what I think about
3287.52s: the market. So I actually have, as you guess, I think I built a slide in here about it.
3296.96s: Let's find that bad boy. Uh, nope, not that one. You like that, you like that pink though or that
3303.60s: purple, whatever that color is? I think it's pretty legit. Where is this here? And here.
3312.24s: So when I look at the idea of setting up a portfolio, it's going to be aligned to this stuff.
3325.44s: So what this means is, let's say, for example, I think the market is going to go up.
3330.48s: Why would I want to have a Delta neutral portfolio if I think the market is going to go up? Well,
3336.32s: the benefit to doing that is if if the market goes down, you can make some money on those other
3341.92s: positions. But from my perspective, I would rather just adjust the portfolio as the market goes down
3349.12s: and then switch. That's the cool part about being a retail trader is that I don't have a mandate.
3356.08s: I don't have any rules placed on me on how much money I have to use at a specific point in time
3361.68s: or what kind of drawdown I can sustain or literally anything like that. I have complete autonomy
3366.88s: over what I choose to do. So for example, T triple cues. I literally had a full exit yesterday
3376.80s: and I reentered the majority of the position today. It's a complete pivot. And there's nothing
3385.20s: that stops you from doing that as a retail trader. You just have to be careful not to go too far
3391.76s: down that rabbit hole and whip sawing around. You lose a lot of money that way. So you don't want to do
3397.04s: that. Rese says keeping a trade long a journal, what a difference can't follow a game plan that
3405.20s: you don't have. Yeah, that's awesome. I'm really glad that you're doing that. In my opinion,
3408.88s: that's probably one of the most transformational aspects of trading literally is that exact
3415.52s: process. So I'm super, super stoked that you're doing that. All right. Any other questions that we
3424.88s: want to hit? Rolando says they sent you a question. It's above. I don't know where it is, man.
3430.56s: Okay. See it. Another question. When is it best to roll options? Is it better to roll or selling
3439.84s: them by another contract? I see. So I have a couple videos for you on that that you can take a look
3444.96s: at. And funny enough, I have another video dropping tomorrow on rolling. So and I think we actually
3450.48s: talked about that. Why in depth during one of our recent live sessions? So that first one is about
3458.08s: rolling kind of a broad concept. The second one is about a bunch of common myths about rolling.
3465.92s: And then this third one is coming out tomorrow. So I don't think you'll be able to access it via
3471.28s: that link because it's scheduled. But when it launches tomorrow, you'll be able to see it. And it's
3476.96s: coming out at zero seven, fifteen, specific time. So yeah, there's a couple of resources there for
3484.80s: you. All right. Let's talk about this idea of building strategies. When I think about the concept
3490.88s: of building a trading strategy. And again, I'm not going to spend much time in this slide deck.
3495.36s: I just want to show you a couple guiding concepts. And then really what I want to do for this section
3499.44s: actually is look at your ideas and walk you through how I would think about building trades. That's
3505.12s: the intention here. So when I think about the idea of building strategies, one of the most important
3514.08s: concepts is maintaining some sort of edge. And there's different ways you can access edge,
3522.24s: which I will give you some ideas. But I want to show you this. So this slide, let me see if I can
3532.24s: large make this a little bit larger so that the people in the back can see.
3537.36s: Let me know if that's visible enough. If it's not, I honestly have no nothing I can do to help you.
3545.68s: So I will make a fake gesture as if I can do something about it, but I cannot. So if it's not visible,
3552.80s: then I feel bad for you. Because otherwise you're not really going to be able to follow along
3558.56s: at all with what I'm going to say. Hi, this is an overview of how I think about building a strategy.
3568.80s: You can see that there are a few steps. This here is essentially the process that I would look to follow,
3579.68s: to kind of build a strategy and the way it would work. I don't know why that would be at that
3586.80s: crazy of an angle. That's just silly to me. There we go. So the idea would be you would flow
3595.44s: through this literally just like this. And what I try to think about is a process that's replicable
3605.20s: over time. And it can deliver consistent results. Because that's going to be one of the largest
3612.64s: aspects of building a successful trading strategy is finding a way to build ideas that you can then
3621.92s: deploy and optimize over time. Because it's not that easy. And one of the biggest mistakes that you
3628.32s: can make in doing this is to have this really haphazard bullshit approach that it doesn't allow you
3636.96s: to actually test ideas. So let's talk about these kind of in a general sense. And then like I
3643.12s: said, we'll literally dive directly into an example. The first thing I'm going to do is define the
3648.40s: purpose of the strategy. So that's predicated on this. So if we go back to the way I think about
3654.64s: really the world of trading, it's in this light up here. Notice how I take a very hierarchical
3662.32s: top down approach to this whole thing. I'm looking at big picture items and then boiling them down
3669.60s: to smaller things. So when I look at the portfolio, I split my portfolio into a core allocation
3677.36s: and a speculative allocation. I now know that I need to have a couple ideas that can work in all of
3684.08s: these. And I've already given you kind of the cheat sheet for the stuff that I do, which is this
3689.84s: right here. This is essentially the comprehensive breakdown of the overwhelming number of trades that I
3698.48s: put on at a given point in time. You literally can find them all here. And there's really what I
3707.36s: consider to be a lot of beauty in simplicity in what I'm doing. So when I'm thinking about
3716.56s: when I'm thinking about building strategies, I want stuff that is robust. And I want stuff that
3725.44s: allows me to trade most market conditions. So the way to answer this first part, purpose of strategy
3731.76s: for me, I would outline a strategy that allows me to trade every single market condition.
3742.00s: That's the first thing I would be looking for. And I think I have a slide in here. Do I?
3749.12s: I think I do. Yeah, this one. This shows you like exactly the stuff that I'm looking to trade.
3760.64s: I'm looking to have things that allow me to trade directionally up and down. I'm looking to trade
3766.80s: volatility. And all of its individual little quirks, whether it's the clustering, the variance
3774.24s: risk premiums, whether it's relative value plays, whether it's skew, there's a million things you
3780.40s: can trade. So these are the broad buckets of what I'm looking to trade. So why does this matter?
3786.88s: Why do I go through the effort of explaining this to you guys? Well, it's pretty simple. It's
3793.44s: because I think one of the easiest things you can do to simplify this whole process for yourself,
3800.24s: which is all the way back here is don't think about having to build a strategy and just build
3807.84s: 10 million of them. You can get to that point if you want. There's nothing wrong with it if that's
3811.68s: your approach. But I would literally start by just defining a you need a strategy to trade things
3817.76s: that are going up. You probably want a strategy to trade things that are going down. If you want to
3822.80s: trade both sides of direction, I do. Like those are completely reasonable places to start right there.
3828.80s: You don't necessarily have to go further than that to start. It's totally up to you, but that's a
3834.00s: reasonable starting point to take. So capital gains is this idea of making money as direction occurs.
3842.40s: You can trade things for income. You can want to have a strategy to hedge a portfolio. You have to
3848.08s: start with what you're trying to do. Then we need to isolate the profit mechanism. Simply put,
3854.24s: this is how the trade supposedly makes money. So what you'll find is people all the time want to put
3865.20s: on. They just what they say like I want to trade something like I want to trade verticals or I want
3871.60s: to trade calendars. And I'm always thinking like why? Who cares? Like you're just naming structures.
3880.64s: What you need to do is think about what the thing is that you're trying to build.
3889.12s: What are you trying to take advantage of? That is the entire purpose of this.
3895.12s: Rama, hey, thank you so much. Rama, I really, really appreciate that.
3900.32s: Rama says showing appreciation for me and objective, sharing learnings without pushing in gender,
3905.04s: you are a true educator. I appreciate that very much. Thank you. That is literally that's the
3909.68s: entire goal. And I'll happily take a second to give another shout out to this dude right there.
3917.28s: That's the guy that essentially told me in high school that I should look into investing.
3923.92s: And then I did. And he with that recommendation completely changed quite literally the entire
3932.00s: trajectory of my life. That's why I do what I do now. Because this dude that's not part of my family
3938.24s: that really has no other vested interest in me other than the fact that I was in ROTC with him as
3943.60s: you could tell by our cool uniforms here. For no other reason than that, he told me to go look
3950.56s: into investing. He thinks he would be a good idea for me. He was showing me what's called a
3954.24s: Goppe love. He was just trying to take care of me. So because of him, my life went down a very
3960.24s: different path. And it's literally why I do this stuff right now on a Friday evening with you guys
3966.48s: is because one, I love teaching. But two, I think it's so important to share those kinds of gifts with
3972.16s: other people. So always shout out to Colonel. All right, back to this though. Profit mechanism is
3979.36s: how something makes money. How can you find a profit mechanism? How can you determine what makes
3985.44s: sense? Easy. It is easy. You can look for things and trends around price direction up or down.
3993.52s: You can look for things relative to volatility. How does it behave? What does it do? What are some of
3997.92s: its traits? You can look for market inefficiencies. There are a lot of ideas. You can literally start
4006.88s: by jotting down a bunch of ideas. Another idea is to go onto a website like SSRN, which is this.
4026.88s: And you can type in different things. This is the social science research network. It gives you
4034.32s: access to tons of peer-reviewed papers. That's where the majority of these are from.
4040.80s: But what I'm showing you in this are all different kinds of profit mechanisms that I literally come
4047.76s: across from different studies, all different kinds of ideas. So what I'm doing is I'm looking at
4054.64s: academic information and studies and I'm using it as inspiration. It's important to know that when
4062.32s: you use academic research, it is not as simple as they say there's post earnings announcement drift,
4070.64s: I trade post earnings announcement drift because academic research has a lot of nuances to it,
4079.60s: and it's not perfect. So you still have to be a thinking human being and interpret that market
4087.04s: research or whatever paper you're reading or whatever else and still test it. But notice how I
4094.80s: said it gives me inspiration. It gives me ideas. We are officially out of Strawberry Watermelon,
4102.88s: but that's okay. We have our backup of regular watermelon. Love us a good filter water.
4111.04s: Oh, that one's so much better. So much better.
4118.72s: Teaching says quantpedia is pretty good as well. Yeah, that's actually a great, great, great
4125.44s: add-in. I do not use it a ton myself because the way that this looks at things is slightly different,
4136.08s: but it is absolutely still worth checking out. I'm thankful teaching that you brought this one up.
4142.72s: Good call. There's quantpedia. All right. So strategy, what's the purpose? What are we trying to do with
4151.92s: this individual strategy that we're looking to build? Then we need to determine from that
4157.84s: what kind of profit mechanism are we trying to take advantage of? So again, I give you several ideas
4169.84s: right here. From there, Reese says, do you have the link to retail trading habits pitfalls? Yeah,
4178.40s: that's on my website. So on my website, good ol fashion, esnvests.com. If you go here and to
4189.68s: here, all of those studies are available here. So you can literally just drop those in and I cite
4197.12s: kind of the key takeaways from all of them. Why do I have this here? Because I think it's
4201.76s: freaking important for people to know what the landscape looks like. So Reese, yes, you can access it
4209.36s: there. So we now know that we need a specific profit mechanism and again, I give you multiple ideas
4218.72s: to determine what that could look like. From there, this is this is the important step. We should
4226.08s: outline a list of perspective strategies that allow us to take advantage of the profit mechanism
4237.36s: that you are interested in. That is the entire point of that step. So what that means in a practical
4245.52s: sense is, for example, Jay says, damn, without couch potato buying you dinner, are you going to,
4254.00s: are you going hungry tonight? Yeah, I know, man, I'm like, shit, I'm supposed to order Greek
4259.04s: and I'm about to be on the hook for it. We might starve. I'll be honest, maybe doing a little bit
4264.08s: of a fast isn't the worst thing ever. I'm still pretty fat. So I could stand to lose a few more
4269.52s: pounds and maybe just do some salsa water. Maybe that's the future for me here.
4273.92s: The structure list is where you just jot down different structures that allow you to take
4284.48s: advantage of whatever it is that you're trying to trade. So for example, if I'm trying to trade
4290.64s: things to the upside, can you guys come up with some ideas? What structures or what things could I do
4297.44s: that allow me to trade to the upside? You guys have any ideas? Throw them in the chat as many as you
4303.36s: want. Calls puts, yep, chewies on it so far. What else can we do? That's two.
4314.56s: Diagon calls, sure, can do that by shares. Roin titty. Love me some Roin titty by shares. That's
4320.24s: perfect. Yeah. Those were all fine. You can do other stuff on top of those, but it starts to get
4327.12s: more complex. And I'm actually really, really, really glad. You guys started with that approach.
4333.76s: And it's because one of my biggest recommendations is when you're going through this process is to start
4342.24s: as simple as possible. And the reason being is because it gives you the purest sense of what works.
4351.84s: And it really decreases the propensity to start overfitting things grossly. So this link here
4360.64s: is how to create a consistently profitable option strategy. It goes through what we're talking about now,
4368.16s: very specifically in in depth, but you guys did the exact right thing there. So the structure list
4372.88s: is literally just that. I'm not worried about what I like. I'm not worried about what I think
4377.68s: might work best. I'm literally writing down what I think can work. That's it. From there,
4384.48s: I'm going to test all of them. Now, before I test all of them, I can naturally exclude some of the
4394.32s: strategies. If forward ever reason for a broader structural reason, it doesn't fit what I'm trying
4400.88s: to do. So for example, let's say I already have a long option strategy that I like to trade to
4410.00s: the upside. If I like it, I already tested it. There's not an inherent need for me to duplicate
4417.76s: having another long option strategy to trade to the upside. That's not saying that there's others
4422.64s: that couldn't work, not even saying that there are others that could work better. But I would go
4428.64s: through that process as I'm trying to build the long option strategy to the upside. So you can
4435.04s: naturally exclude things if you already have suitable strategies that do what you want them to do
4442.48s: from the jump. So we take all of these and then we test them. We test them with a large data set.
4449.20s: We then segment the data into smaller components. We test it and then we evaluate the robustness.
4456.24s: How well does it work? How consistent is it? How do the path of returns align with what I'm
4464.40s: looking for? Am I comfortable with things like the maximum drawdown, those kinds of ideas?
4470.16s: How do you test? You can either purchase access to back testing software. You can run it in Python
4477.52s: yourself. You could probably ask chat GPT or another tool like that to help you. You can use
4483.20s: something like on demand in thinker swim. And you can go back in time and you can manually test your
4490.80s: ideas. This is a much slower process. This isn't the way that I would start personally.
4498.08s: If you're trying to look through a bunch of different things, there is absolutely nothing wrong
4503.12s: with starting to do this. If you're not even sure how to test, this will teach you a lot going
4508.80s: through this specific process. So next, after that, let me slide that there. Come back out on demand.
4521.28s: After we go through that testing, we have a selection process where we see what structures make sense
4527.60s: for us. So I guess this should actually say select structures. So you can find the structures that
4536.96s: work well for what you're trying to do. And then you can codify a rule set around them. This is
4542.48s: where we're taking a structure and we're turning it into a strategy. So for example, a structure
4547.68s: is long call. You can now parameterize that long call and you could say, well, maybe I'll buy it when
4554.72s: the moving average slope for 14 day and seven day moving averages, they're positive.
4564.56s: Okay, that's a criteria you can use. You can tinker with as many criteria as you would like.
4571.04s: My recommendation is to go through a process where you evaluate the efficacy of signals stand
4579.28s: alone. So what that means is if I want to use moving averages, if I want to know, if moving
4586.32s: averages are an effective tool for me to evaluate this long bias directional thing I'm trying to
4594.32s: trade the first thing I'm going to do is go to SSRN type in moving average. This is what I see.
4604.24s: So the first thing I'm going to do is leverage other people's research and piggyback off of it.
4610.56s: Okay, let me read all of these and see what they come up with and see what I think. Based on that,
4616.56s: I will refine the signal itself. And then when I'm baking it into a strategy, I will see how
4624.48s: aligns with the strategy. So I guess maybe we can do something like this to make it easier.
4639.84s: And we'll include a thing in there for testing a signal.
4643.76s: So we marry up the structures, we marry up the signals, we marry up our management approach,
4651.36s: then we determine what fits best into our portfolio and then we start testing it live.
4657.52s: So that's like a super broad overview of what this process look like. I'm going to take a pause
4662.48s: there before we get into an example and what questions do you guys have about this process?
4668.80s: What do you guys think about it? Do you, it doesn't make sense? Are there specific components to it
4676.56s: that are unclear or things that you want to dive more into detail on?
4691.36s: Other than Alper who's stoked on Tesla, which is cool. I'm stoked that you're stoked on Tesla.
4697.12s: Okay. So let's take a look at something not to do.
4713.52s: This is a great example of what I wouldn't seek to do with any sort of live trade.
4722.48s: So you can see that we have this person asking if they should roll options to extract profits on a
4731.04s: trade that they have on. This is quite literally the absolute worst time on planet Earth to attempt
4739.92s: to figure out what to do. Literally about is bad is it can possibly get? So I would absolutely
4747.04s: recommend not doing that with literally without a doubt. I would not do that.
4758.08s: Policies how do you choose data providers? That's a great question. So for market data and options
4764.96s: data, I use SIBO, but they're not the cheapest choice. So I do have a couple companies I'm affiliated
4773.04s: with. They're typically in the description to my videos. Literally the reason why I affiliate with
4778.72s: anybody is to get people discounts on things. Most of them don't really pay me anything worthwhile,
4785.84s: but the products that I'm affiliated with that I think are genuinely good are things like Orats,
4793.20s: Options Omega, Benzenga, BarChart. They all have different options data available to you depending
4799.84s: on what you're trying to do. But for me personally, I literally go through SIBO and I buy their market
4807.04s: data directly. It's expensive. So if you're not what I would consider to be like a much more
4816.96s: serious trader, I think using some of those other tools probably be a little more economically viable.
4826.32s: Nathan asks, when you use Python scripts to test new strat, you ever use LLM type script to
4835.60s: forecast as well? Definitely. Yeah. And there's no reason not to. So there's a component about
4841.60s: forward testing that's a slightly different bucket than back testing. I think it's really important
4847.28s: to back test first to see what you can get to work, to see what kind of aligns with the objectives
4854.96s: that you have and what fits well with the portfolio. And then you can absolutely start looking at
4860.56s: forward testing ideas using either some sort of generator or like a random market sampling technique
4868.00s: that's another really effective one to create like a new path, stuff like that. Ian says, trailing
4875.68s: stops are they picked at the underlying price or to the option position price either or it
4879.68s: depends on your broker, but you can set a trailing for either. Good question.
4887.52s: Cool. All right. Retired. I love that. Ridley Truthor. I'm glad to know that you are retired. Big fan.
4899.04s: If you have a call option that doesn't expire for a few weeks months, but you hit your take profit
4904.56s: early or just an extremely good run goes, do you sell early or is that too vague? No, it's not too
4908.96s: vague at all. In those instances, I typically use like some sort of trailing stop. That's my approach.
4915.20s: So for example, T triple queues. I've been buying into this for the majority of the year, but
4921.44s: definitely a depth of the position started going on as we came out of this drop and kind of
4930.32s: scaling up towards the end of April beginning of May. So the original price target that I had
4938.16s: essentially was taking it from 60. And what I do for these kinds of price targets is I go further
4944.00s: out in time. So like two years, I have to go even further. Let's go to five years. So what I do is
4949.52s: I say, what references do I have to other perspective support and resistance? So you can see that
4956.16s: there's some congestion here. I like the 68 handle. You can see some congestion here at the 75
4963.12s: handle. So what I did in this case is as I was buying in, I already had an existing position from
4968.56s: down here. I took it to the downside got stopped out in this space, waited for recovery,
4973.52s: started to see a recovery here beginning of May and of April. And then I set the initial profit
4979.28s: target of 75 bucks. So that's the give me an idea of where I'm trying to take this thing to,
4985.12s: how I'm trying to ride it. And then when it hits 75 bucks, I don't just take the trade off
4991.44s: because it's doing what I want as long as it continues to do what I want, I absolutely would
4997.44s: not take the trade off. But what I do is I start setting stops. So in this case, the initial stop
5004.80s: that I use specifically in T triple queues was when either I had a greater than 3% drop within an
5011.76s: individual day or if price fell below the 14 day MA and a 20, I think this one's a 20,
5021.60s: let me see this one, 22. And or price falls below a 14 day MA with the 22 negative sloping.
5031.60s: So this one stopped me out on the severity of the entry day move. And that's why I
5037.92s: accident. And that's why I ended up re-entering today because it started essentially behaving as
5042.72s: it should yet again. So I would not arbitrarily take the position down though. I think that that
5049.04s: kind of does you a disservice. And for me, like I said, I typically like to use something like a
5056.48s: like a 10 day 11 day 14 day, there's a million combinations. I'll get rid of this seven though,
5063.84s: just so it's a little less noisy to give you an idea. The other thing I do like to use though
5070.00s: is the the slope of moving averages. So the fact that that seven day MA essentially turned negative,
5078.00s: let me go back and add it back in. I just want to show you specifically what I was looking out there.
5093.28s: So I want this to be seven. And then I'm going to make this bad boy red.
5098.48s: So the reason by the way that I do like red for this is because since I have like multiple moving
5107.04s: averages, it literally helps me track a little more cleanly like Roy G bib. That's the old Roy G bib.
5119.76s: So in this case, you can see that this had a big negative day. But the seven day MA slope was
5126.88s: still positive. Then you can see that this also had a pretty big red day, but the MA seven day MA
5133.20s: slope was still positive. In this case, the seven day MA slope literally flipped negative.
5141.36s: So that is not something that I take lightly. There's other tools that I use, but in this case,
5149.68s: that's essentially a big part of the trigger. That's also why up here, as you can tell, like I
5156.16s: actually have the various MA slopes. And you can codify this in essentially however you want.
5163.76s: Let me see if I can find it. This one. So I have MA slopes for all different periods. So like I can
5170.80s: add the seven day back in. And then essentially, I would add it down here as another input into this.
5181.12s: But that's the idea at least behind using the moving average slopes. So yeah, long answer with
5190.16s: a little bit of specifics around this example. But if I hit the profit target early, I do not
5197.84s: immediately take the trade down. The trade is doing what I want. I want to let the trade work
5203.52s: for as long as I can, as long as it continues to do what I want.
5207.68s: That's the idea. Dr. Zayah says, what effect is price movement in the underlying have on each
5216.24s: expiration cycle of the option chain nearest expiration will experience more change relative to the
5220.40s: longer data, right? Sort of. Not inherently. So what example would I give you that would qualify the
5232.16s: not inherently part? Do you have any ideas? And in the meantime, I'll pop this open and see if I
5242.64s: can't add that that other slope in here. So what other criteria can you guys think of that
5255.36s: would lead what they're talking about to not always be the case?
5259.12s: Dr. Zayah says, I didn't have a ticker in my no, no, no, it's not specific to a ticker.
5265.76s: What I'm actually talking about is a broader topic. It's definitely not something that's
5274.08s: specific to a ticker, actually literally at all. So yeah, you don't have to worry about that.
5280.64s: That's not what I'm referring to here.
5282.88s: Volume? Nope, not volume. Good guess, but that ain't it.
5292.24s: Earnings? Nope, not at either. Interesting. Very interesting. So no, the way to think about it is
5299.52s: I want you guys to think about Delta. And I want you guys to think about gamma. So where is Delta
5309.68s: and where is gamma? How would those impact the decision on where we would see this example where
5320.80s: I'm talking specifically about longer dated options, actually seeing potentially more of a move
5330.16s: as compared to the shorter dated options. It is tied completely
5339.60s: to Delta and to gamma. So what do you guys think?
5347.60s: There's a specific time frame that we would see the options move a lot more on a relative basis
5357.44s: as compared to other time frames, but it can flip when we look at something like Delta and gamma.
5367.76s: Any ideas you guys?
5372.72s: And in the meantime, we got our script back up so that you guys can see those other slopes.
5378.88s: So you can see the 7-day, 22-day, 50, and 200.
5384.32s: Intrinsic value is not correct. Benoit is the closest so far with closer to add the money.
5390.72s: So let's take a look at an example. Let's pick a stock. Pick a stock, any stock.
5397.60s: And let's go back in time. Roaring Titty says I'm not sure I understand the question.
5402.48s: Yeah, let me clarify. So I have to go back up. I lost the question. So Dr. Zeyes asked,
5409.52s: what effect does price movement in the underlying have on each expiration cycle?
5413.84s: The nearest expiration will experience more change relative to the longer dated.
5418.80s: So what he's asking is if the price in, we got to pick something else, let's look at Lulu.
5427.92s: So if the price in Lulu moves either direction up or down, they're postulating that that movement
5435.76s: will impact the shorter term expiration more than the longer term expiration.
5442.72s: And it's partially correct, partially incorrect. So I'm asking you guys to decipher the difference.
5450.56s: What element of it is partially correct and what element is partially incorrect?
5456.00s: Carlos speculates theta, which would be a great example of an incorrect answer.
5462.48s: Re says via gamma, yes, percentage wise, closer.
5468.56s: Closer. Dr. Zeyes says thank you for deep diving this love. And yeah, this is, it's a great question.
5473.44s: This is, again, this is how people learn. So let's take a look at an example.
5479.12s: If I buy this 350 call, and let's pretend we're in an alternate universe,
5486.40s: where Lulu catches a bid and it goes up.
5490.56s: Right now, I buy these for $3.90 at the mid. Okay.
5497.04s: What happens if I go out 431 days and I buy these 200s?
5508.88s: And I buy these for 160, a 83 way more expensive.
5517.36s: If we get a dollar move in Lulu, which one of those positions make more?
5522.08s: Is it the 200 call that's out 431 days?
5527.44s: Or is it, I forgot why expiration were in? Or the 350s that are at a 46 delta with four days to go.
5534.88s: These are about as close as you can get before expiration.
5538.80s: Which one of those would move more?
5544.48s: Delta J Bingo. That's the first part of the equation.
5548.40s: Right? Delta. Go back to the basics. Delta tells us the rate of change of in options premium.
5558.96s: Reese says front expiry. Bad timing because you are wrong. And that it sucks.
5566.16s: It sucks to be wrong. Now, actually, we can we can make Reese partially right here on a relative
5572.96s: basis in terms of the cost of the option. They might make more money. That could be. But not in
5581.44s: terms of a gross dollar amount. So these would make less money. Why? Well, they have a 46 delta.
5591.68s: So if Lulu goes up $1, let's just say that these are $4 for ease. Let's say you bought them at $4.
5598.72s: If it goes up $1, these would give you 46 cents of profit. So your $4 are now worth $4.46. You've made
5609.20s: $46. We go out here 431 days back into the 90 delta to the 200s. If Lulu goes up a dollar,
5620.64s: you've made $90. Your way further out in time. But it is a 90 delta. So that means
5629.76s: is Lulu moves up by $1. These options make 90 cents. The front expiration in that example,
5638.72s: you've made 46 cents or 40 whatever since it was. So that is a prime example of how going further
5648.64s: out in time, you can actually make more money than the near term. Benoit says, but those are
5656.24s: hugely different position sizes on an equally on an equal equity basis sooner x-rays would always
5663.76s: have a larger move. If you were to isolate it in that sense in terms of a percentage gain,
5670.32s: yes. Well, it also would depend on how far out you go, right? It's a bit of a sliding scale.
5676.00s: So for example, you can have a smaller variance between the options between the
5684.00s: explorations. But yes, absolutely. Your point is correct on a percentage gain. You will see larger
5692.40s: percentage gains on shorter data options. But again, this is the important part of being a thinking
5700.48s: trader, right? Because the name of the game at the end of the year isn't what is the percentage
5706.56s: gain on the portfolio? Would you want a 100% gain on a $1 portfolio or a 10% gain on a $100 portfolio?
5717.12s: I would absolutely take the lower percent return on the larger principle yielding a larger
5724.40s: dollar amount. So that's what I look for, even when I'm structuring things like my GameStop
5730.80s: trades that I'm putting on. That's why I'm going further out in time is I'm going further in the
5736.24s: money. I'm not going far out in time and then hanging out here in the ether because to a lot of
5743.60s: your guys' point, which you're seeing very well, these will have a lower gamma. So these won't
5749.44s: move as much. But if you have a high delta, you don't care so much about gamma. Because once
5756.08s: delta gets to one, that's all it can do. So gamma only starts to hurt you at that point if it goes
5762.88s: against you, meaning if the underlying goes against you and gamma builds. But you might pay a larger
5771.28s: principle up front, but it's also a little bit of a deductible because you're going really far
5777.28s: in the money. There's a lot of intrinsic value. So if the underlying doesn't move, let's say it stays
5783.04s: flat or goes up slightly, your extrinsic value, your cost of holding that position is not that high.
5791.04s: Now you are paying a larger gross amount. So if the underlying is a big sweeping move against you,
5796.64s: you do stand to lose more money. But again, that's the nature of being a trader. If you have an
5802.32s: option that's at a one delta and you let it become a 30 delta, you've grossly fucked up. You've
5810.24s: not done your job as a trader. So the way to think about aspirations is it's part of the equation
5820.00s: along with deltas. But you can have longer expirated options that make more money than near term
5828.64s: expiration options entirely possible. And you can have vice versa. You can have the inverse.
5833.52s: You can have a near term option that makes a larger gross dollar amount than a longer dated option,
5839.44s: also entirely possible. So delta is going to be one of the primary inputs you need to look at.
5846.00s: Gamma is the next input that matters a lot.
5852.24s: Benoit says, how do you think about capital allocation then? I generally try to be almost
5856.56s: completely allocated. So I'd rather have the larger percent move if I have all my funds allocated.
5863.76s: Do you? Is that actually what you would want? Which scenario would you make more money?
5871.12s: So if we put equivalent size positions on and there's a specific tradeoff and the point
5882.56s: emerges sooner or later that you'll notice. Let's go back to Lulu.
5887.28s: And let's pretend we're structuring a trade to the downside because Lulu cannot catch a bid
5894.48s: quite literally to save its life. So let's say you want to trade Lulu to the downside.
5900.32s: And you want short term dated options because they expand more, but we're going to buy puts.
5906.00s: And let's say, let's just pretend that this was more liquid. It's kind of super illiquid,
5910.88s: but let's just pretend it was liquid. And let's say that we want to buy these 280s. We'll analyze that
5918.56s: with our risk profile. And then let's say that we want to go 98 days out and rather than those 280s,
5925.76s: we buy the trifitties, analyze that. So now the first thing you could do to your point is you can
5934.00s: say, well, I would want to put on the same size position. Okay. So then I'll let the dog in one second.
5941.84s: I'll let the dog in one second.
5949.84s: Here he is. In all his glory, I literally have to change this so that you guys can get a peek.
5958.16s: All right. So here he is. He's ready to teach about options. He's well versed. Thank you.
5965.84s: And he's ready to talk about shorting. Hey, attention. He's all right. So he yawning.
5972.24s: The reason why he's yawning is because he's used to this. He kind of knows all this stuff.
5976.64s: So he's a little bit bored. That's what I think. But we'll proceed anyways. So you could say,
5986.72s: I want to structure these same size position. And you can do that. But let's talk about that in a
5992.32s: second. Let's see what size move. If you just look at them at a one to one basis first,
5998.48s: and you'll see why I'm doing this. Let's see what size move you need in order for these near
6004.32s: dated out of the money puts in order to make more money than the in the money puts. So in order to
6012.72s: help us visualize that, I'm going to add a few different standard deviations. I'm going to use
6020.08s: plus one and minus one. And this is just standard deviation move of the underlying price plus two
6031.36s: minus two plus three minus three. Okay. So let's see. At a minus one standard deviation,
6041.60s: you make three 17. At a minus two standard deviation, you make 1058. And at a minus three standard
6048.24s: deviation, you make 2042. Let's go back to this one. If you make a one standard deviation down move,
6054.88s: you make seven 84. So seven 84 compared to three 16 317, you make more here.
6064.64s: 1777 on a two standard deviation move compared to 1053. So you still make more here.
6071.36s: And then on a three standard deviation move, you make 2800 here versus 2000 here. So on a non
6084.16s: similar size position in terms of capital outlay, but on a one to one basis, you can see how the
6091.28s: short dated option will compound much more given in a accommodating move. However,
6099.52s: it won't outpace the profit side. So let's take a look at the next component then, which is you
6109.36s: have the ability to size this trade up. Right. So if this cost me 6,345 bucks for this one individual
6117.44s: position, you could put on like 63 of these. You could put on a ton. So that starts to look really
6123.12s: good, doesn't it? Because then you can say, well, well, shit. If I get a one standard deviation
6128.32s: move in my favor, I make 20 grand on the same size position. That seems fantastic. Does it not?
6138.72s: Not so much. Why is that? Well, there's a really, really important difference here. Take a look
6146.32s: at my theta on this trade, $4.99. That's on my one lot. If I do the same size trade,
6156.48s: my theta is $1,144. So you can make way more money if you get your move in the correct amount of time.
6169.36s: If you don't or if it's not a big enough move fast enough, theta will completely eat your lunch.
6179.60s: And as time passes, so let's say your move doesn't happen on the first day, notice what just happened.
6188.48s: If we look at, I want to see if I can keep that highlighted. If you have your $20,000 profit there,
6194.64s: it just turned to $18,355 one day later. One day later, your max profit on that one standard deviation
6205.28s: move just went down $1700. If it's two days later, it just went down another $4,000.
6216.56s: This is exactly the issue and this is exactly the trade off. So going back to your question,
6223.76s: Benoit, for me, I focus more on what kind of risk makes sense for my thesis and then structuring
6235.36s: a position around that. So Benoit, if you take a look at that video that I made or the video I
6244.24s: shared earlier, it walks through how I think of this. So Benoit says this is just another
6251.60s: rehash of the buy better calls video. That's exactly correct. Yep, that's exactly correct.
6255.92s: And it's because the way I think about it is it's not saying that further out in time is better.
6260.88s: I don't want anybody to think that that's the conclusion I'm trying to draw with you guys because
6265.20s: it's not, it's genuinely not what I'm trying to summarize to here. What I'm trying to summarize to
6270.64s: is that based entirely on your expectations in disposition as a trader, you need to build and
6280.00s: structure a corresponding trade that makes sense for you. That's the entire idea.
6288.56s: So that is the punchline, at least to that question. Benoit, let me know if that makes sense.
6296.00s: I have to turn off my house's air because it's blowing like crazy. You know, chill house.
6305.68s: Any other questions on that? That was a great question, by the way, though. I'm really,
6311.20s: really stoked. Okay, cool. So it sounds like that connected. Great. Sweet. So let's go back and kind
6319.84s: of finish a quick walk through then of this example of this year building a strategy.
6327.76s: So let's say that I want to trade stuff to the upside. If I'm looking for some sort of breakout
6332.88s: idea and let's say you do a bunch of homework and you identify, you know, as you're going through
6339.44s: SSRN and you're looking at all these different kinds of things. Let's say that you find
6345.04s: that stocks that are making 52 week highs tend to have a drift component to them and to continue
6354.00s: to make relative highs. And if you're kind of picking up what I'm putting down, that's, it is an
6361.12s: effect. I know it exists. It's a momentum effect. It's called a momentum premium. There's
6364.80s: different ways to capitalize on it. So I'm giving you an example of a already baked
6372.32s: profit function, which is what what this is. So from there, the first step here, let me see if I can
6381.04s: like shrink this and keep it as we look through this. This might be like really difficult for you
6386.24s: guys to see. So I'll kind of like talk about it as we look at stuff. But the purpose of the
6391.84s: strategy in this case is we're building something that allows us to capitalize on upward price
6396.96s: movement. We don't care yet if it's long premium, short premium, it doesn't matter. We just want
6404.24s: something that allows us to make money if stock goes up. The profit mechanism that we're talking
6409.60s: about, the direction is up. And we're looking for something that exhibits momentum premium. So
6416.08s: we now need to, I guess we need to do like this is really where signal test would make sense, wouldn't
6426.16s: it? I think that makes way more sense. Yeah. And then this would be more like a signal alignment.
6437.52s: So Ridley says, so identify catalysts first, definitely. So the very well kind of the second
6449.44s: step for me is to identify a profit mechanism. What do I think I can make money from? So again, in this
6456.32s: case, we're talking about trying to trade something to the upside. So I would need to test that signal
6463.20s: and there are different ways I can think about qualifying and quantifying that profit mechanism.
6470.72s: So I can look at again, this one is kind of already done for the sake of time. But you can look at
6476.96s: the performance of stocks. Let's say that have the highest PE ratios or the lowest price to book
6483.44s: ratios or the lowest price to earnings growth ratios. If you wanted to use some fundamental tools,
6489.04s: you could use stocks that are trading above 50 moving averages.
6498.24s: So what I'm highlighting there is you can gain exposure to a lot of different things.
6505.36s: And depending on how you want to quantify it, you can access it in slightly different ways.
6512.32s: So in this case, like I said, I'm kind of giving you a already baked concept. And it's really just so that
6521.92s: you can have an idea of what this looks like. So if I'm looking up this momentum premium idea,
6529.52s: there's a couple of things that matter a lot to me. So do I still have this open?
6535.52s: And we don't hear. We can use what I'm doing is I'm going through like my litany of studies.
6547.60s: And I'm finding examples of momentum premium like this here.
6559.44s: So this is an example of momentum premium. You can look for things that have specific parameters
6565.68s: for an earnings release. And then you can essentially trade it in a bunch of different ways.
6578.40s: I'm texting my wife real quick. She's
6583.92s: hungry. So I just ordered her dinner. So in this case, you can look at host earnings. And there's
6592.64s: a bunch of different criteria that can be met. And that becomes your signal. So things that have a gap
6599.52s: up, things that tend to be smaller market cap stocks, meaning not mega cap stuff like that becomes
6607.20s: part of your signal. And then you can test that any way that you want. So now let's use the next part
6615.28s: of this example. We want to trade things that go up. We know that we're trying to do some sort of
6621.60s: momentum premium play. And in this example, rather than P, we're using the 52 week high criteria.
6628.56s: We now can build a list of structures that allow us to trade to the upside. You guys already did
6635.84s: this actually. So if you think about this kind of thing, what structures can apply here?
6642.24s: Walk me through what you think what you think makes sense. And then in the meantime,
6654.88s: Roindtiddy says, how do you do that for mergers acquisitions? You literally can test. You can
6659.44s: find, you can create an entire list of companies, public companies that have undergone M&A. And then
6665.60s: you can look at price behavior pre post volatility behavior pre post. It's exactly what I would do.
6671.76s: It's another very tradable thing, by the way. And also you can very frequently detect
6677.36s: when there is a perspective M&A process underway. If you take a look at the options chains, which are
6685.60s: mega mega informative. So to recap the other structures that you guys already listed, there are
6693.60s: things like long calls, buying shares, short puts. All of those can make sense if we're trying to
6699.68s: trade something directionally to the upside. Okay, cool. So now we need to test them. So this is where
6707.04s: I would run it through a series of back tests. The first thing I would do is say, okay, maybe for this
6714.96s: 52 week high, I would look at sorting all stocks that are optionable. And in this case, I'm using
6723.84s: weeklies just for liquidity measure. I'm going to sort them by those making the highest 52 week
6730.16s: highs at a given point in time. And I'm going to essentially simulate purchasing the top 10 of them,
6738.40s: the top desioli if you're selling client or really whatever number you want. And I'm just going
6744.48s: to focus first on using the underlying itself, meaning buying shares. Or if I wanted to trade it
6752.08s: to the downside, shorting shares. Why would I do that? If I'm testing kind of the profit
6759.92s: potential and the ideally testing a bunch of different structures, why do you guys think I would
6767.36s: do it that way? Starting with just the shares. Any ideas? There's a very specific reason.
6787.04s: Because it's at the high, so it's uncertain. It's a good question, but no, that's not it.
6792.88s: If it will break out, better risk management, another great guest, but also not correct.
6798.48s: It's because I'm starting with this simplest concept. That's it. Shares are the simplest ways
6804.40s: to trade this. So right now, I'm just trying to understand based on this profit mechanism that I
6811.84s: think exists that I've tested with a couple different signals. I want to see how it performs if
6817.68s: I just use the underlying, because remember, options essentially are just amplified versions of
6824.72s: the underlying with a bunch of additional rules. So for example, if I buy shares and I make money
6831.44s: with this structure, well, that already tells me something. It means that if I use options, it'll
6837.20s: make money. It means that if I sell puts or buy calls, it'll make money. I already know what makes
6844.00s: money because it makes money if the underlying goes up. But it becomes an assessment of quality.
6850.48s: So for example, if I test long shares and I want to test holding for a week, two weeks, a month,
6859.28s: two months, three months, six months, 12 months, something like that. I'm going to look for trends
6864.16s: across all those different time frames. And then I'm going to say, okay, well, it seems like
6870.32s: based on this smattering of underlying that I bought, I would run literally overgrussian to see
6875.36s: one with the correlation is in terms of what time frames make the most sense to hold and what kind
6881.04s: of traits tend to perform the best. And then I can overlay and build some sort of option
6888.96s: equivalent to that. It's harder to back test. Now, if you have the savvy, it's not that difficult.
6895.44s: But you can absolutely use that as a starting point. And if you notice that your long shares make
6904.64s: money and let's say that on average, you see a 5% drift over the following month. Well, now you have
6915.36s: something to work with because if I know that there's a 5% average drift over the course of the
6921.76s: following month, now I can say, well, does it make more sense to buy calls or more sense to sell puts?
6931.68s: And you can do a simple comparison. So let's use this as an example. Let's say that we want to use
6939.68s: VRT. And if I know that over the month, it's probably going to go up by 5%.
6950.48s: I could sell puts, let's say that I want to postulate selling like a 30 delta put here,
6957.68s: collecting like 435 ish. And then let's say I want to buy a 70 delta call or I'm sorry 70 DTE,
6969.52s: a 70 delta makes sense here, like 75 delta maybe, to like a 72 delta call. And it's 1555.
6980.24s: So here's the first thing I need to determine. Based on the position here, which one do I like more?
6987.76s: Do I want to outlay 1555 bucks? Maybe there's nothing wrong with that if your portfolio has room for it.
6995.28s: Or you'd have to see what the margin requirement is for the 42.5 put, which in this case, it's 8,250 bucks.
7006.16s: So in terms of capital utilization, you actually can use more from the long calls. And again,
7011.60s: maybe it doesn't matter to you. Maybe you have the margin in there and you just don't care.
7016.80s: But now we can then assess, well, if we get our 5% move, how does my short put do? I make $119 on my
7026.72s: 82.5 outlay. If I get my 5% move to the upside on the calls, I get $336. And there's no margin
7038.08s: requirements because you're going to pay for it in cash, which is 1555. So if you get your 5% move,
7043.92s: which one of these is actually better? Well, if it moves in your favor, unequivocally, you make more
7048.96s: money with the long calls. This is how you back into what makes sense. So now I would overlay the risk
7058.96s: management. Let's say that I'm going to manage risk here at 8560, just because I think if it drops
7068.56s: below that, it looks like it would probably head towards 8224 and I don't want to take it that far.
7075.76s: So let's call it if there's a close below 85. So now what we can do is we can say, all right,
7084.56s: well, if price goes to my stop point of 85, how do these perform? The long call, if it goes to,
7097.28s: I guess I should wait, oh, duh, I'm an idiot. Sorry.
7105.28s: My bad. If it goes to 85, in this case, you lose 325 bucks. And in this case, you lose 165.
7115.84s: So you lose more money here if you get stopped out, but you also have the potential to make more money.
7123.84s: So this is looking closer to a one to one risk to reward profile. This is looking like a sub one
7131.36s: risk to reward. This is the risk profile tab. Mrs. Royantity. This is a sub one. So now we have to
7140.96s: take the next step, which is what's the probability of us getting this 5% up move versus this 85%
7148.80s: or I'm sorry, this 85 price point stoppage. So now we can go to probability. And we can look at the
7155.92s: probability of a touch. And we can look over the next month for like a normalized time frame. So
7164.80s: using like the 16 aug maybe. And what's the probability of us being stopped out to the downside at 85?
7173.04s: It is 83%. And then what's the probability of us hitting that 95 handled to the upside?
7182.48s: It's about 78%. So now guess what? You literally have just created the input to a very important
7196.08s: calculation, which would then be codified across all of the different strategies that you use,
7203.92s: which is expected return, which is somewhere in here. I just don't know where.
7212.56s: Where is that pesky expected return? Oh, I think it's up here more.
7217.92s: Aha, finally, sorry. It took us a second to get to this right here.
7233.12s: So you now know what your win price would be. You now know the probability of getting that win.
7240.24s: You now know what the loss would be. And you now know the probability of that loss.
7245.04s: So you literally have all of the tools to answer this exact question of which of these strategies makes more
7255.68s: sense in this individual trade. Now this is evaluating it against the concept of an individual trade,
7261.76s: which ideally you would apply the structure, then strategy way more broadly.
7269.28s: And you would have much more of a codified approach. But that's literally an overview of this process,
7280.16s: kind of from start to finish. So I will take a pause there and see what questions you guys have.
7287.52s: Anything in there that you want to dive a little bit deeper into. I am getting ready to order my dinner
7293.12s: now, but it's not going to be here for at least a minute. So we can take a look at anything else
7301.92s: that you guys would like to hit. We're doing I'm doing old spaghetti factory tonight. That's the move.
7315.68s: Cool. Well, it looks like there are no questions popping up. I'm happy to hang out for a couple more minutes.
7327.76s: If you guys have anything that does pop up. Yeah, let's take a look.
7334.80s: A count guy to says, could you look at my question above about the parameter? I didn't see it. Can you post it again for me down here? I totally missed it.
7342.32s: And then in the meantime, Banovaire Plains, I like your plans to you.
7348.80s: Is can you talk about cash secured puts? Yeah, sure. What about cash secured puts? Let me know what you
7355.12s: want to dive into. Chewie says does that work with your DTE? Of course. The process is agnostic to everything.
7364.72s: It's again, it's a probabilistic assessment. But yeah, the process itself is essentially standardized.
7374.56s: So that's the point of building an approach like that is you don't have to go through a lot of different
7382.40s: stages realistically. You can kind of codify what works well to test a lot of different concepts.
7392.40s: So a fan of airplanes, what's your approach for using CSPs? Really, I only use them as part of the coverage
7400.24s: triangle. And that's if I'm looking to accumulate positions. It's less so as a method to acquire shares.
7409.68s: It's more so a method to try to capture risk premium in something that I fully anticipate to build out.
7416.48s: However, I do not in general run a lot of CSPs. I'm even finding myself more and more as of late
7425.68s: with the way that the market is behaving recently. Spending way more time trading things like the
7431.76s: ratio called diagonals. I'm not like fully out of using something like the coverage triangle,
7437.92s: obviously. But what I'm doing in a pretty big way is trying to use the indices more and more.
7447.44s: And a lot of that is to just be more tax efficient. And when you're trading the indices themselves,
7454.24s: they do not have options or an underlying that you can trade. So yeah, I think I think that's kind
7466.16s: of like the long and short of it. Accounting guy, wondering if you've tried estimating parameters
7475.04s: for a Heston model for option pricing. I'm trying to build a money carless in but not getting
7478.64s: real estate results. Yeah, that's the problem that you likely will have if you're going through the
7483.12s: process and trying to estimate your own wall. Heston is okay, but it misses a ton of stuff. So I think
7490.00s: I think most people that are trying to estimate their own wall are using some sort of variation
7497.44s: of a garsh model. But even those you need to include some sort of jump diffusion because accounting
7504.88s: for gaps is really, really, really, really important. So something you can tinker with is this website
7512.80s: from New York University Stern. And you can take a look at a bunch of different kinds of
7519.44s: wall models that they tinker with. And you can see what seems to represent the world a little
7525.76s: bit better for you. And then you can essentially see what you want to replicate from this, at least
7530.64s: as a starting point. But the Heston, it's too simplistic. It misses too much. So yes, I have used it,
7537.84s: but it does not surprise me that you're not getting real estate results.
7541.52s: Dr. Zayas says, I'm wondering about IRA accounts, pros and cons of IRA account for trading options.
7551.44s: Yeah, that's totally fine. I trade options in an IRA account. There are slightly different rules
7557.28s: that go along with it. I actually literally think I have videos on trading options in an IRA.
7562.16s: You see, I do a little bit old, but I think it's still probably, probably right.
7570.72s: So there's that video that is, yeah, it's definitely much older. But
7581.92s: yeah, you just have to change the approach a little bit is what it boils down to. But I use
7592.48s: I use a IRA literally all the time for trading. It's less frequent, but I'll still look at it every
7600.64s: couple weeks, week, every other week, something like that. And the only broader concept there is
7607.36s: less so like if it makes sense to trade in an IRA, because of course it does, especially if it's
7611.28s: a Roth IRA, something that's tax deferred, depending on what your tax footprint looks like going
7616.08s: forward. I'm obviously not a tax professional, not a financial professional, nothing I say should
7620.80s: be taking his financial advice. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. But you can look at
7626.64s: how an IRA fits into your life because a big drawback to IRAs is when you want to access it.
7634.00s: And there's kind of a liquidity cost to it because you can't get into them.
7642.16s: Now going further down the IRA, but hold there's a lot of gaps you can take advantage of.
7648.56s: There's different rules you can exploit that are perfectly legal. But like for example,
7655.84s: with an IRA, if you want to access it early, you can use it to buy your house if it's your first
7660.40s: house. Like towards your first house, there's more rules to it. I don't know, because I never got
7664.48s: to use it myself. But that's just a way you can tap into it a little bit early. So the tricky part
7671.84s: with IRAs is it pertains to being a trader is if your aspiration is to retire early,
7677.76s: which I think that's the whole point of doing this, then an IRA is kind of tricky because you
7682.80s: definitely want the money there for when you get older, but you also can't access it quite as much.
7689.28s: TG says I found the Black Sholes Model EM expected move numbers for your DTESPX options are
7694.40s: very misleading. I don't see how they're misleading. And that's I don't understand how the Black
7700.88s: Sholes Model in there fits in for you unless you just mean using Black Sholes to derive what the
7705.84s: expected move is or how you're arriving at the expected move. I'm not sure you have to give me
7710.56s: more detail than that. Happy to take a look at it, but I do not know exactly what you're referring to.
7719.84s: Back up to the top paper cut. Tell me why I shouldn't go deep in the money calls three months out for
7727.44s: Sophie. Seems really good for those right now. Let's see. Let's take a look at some so five. So five.
7736.64s: I mean, the short answer is because it's going down. If you buy calls, you want the underlying to go
7743.68s: up. And right now the underlying as you see it here is not going up. So that is the short answer
7752.40s: on why going deep in the money three months out for Sophie may not make sense is because
7761.28s: it's not going up. And idea.
7770.56s: Roryntitty says what about using Otoco? That's actually this sounds like a dance. That's fun.
7776.88s: I like that and using my limits and stops it. Yeah, I think that's okay. You can use those
7780.88s: kinds of orders. So you just have to be really, really careful. And what she's referring to, by the way,
7785.52s: is a complex order type. And she's linking two of them. So there's a trigger order. And then
7794.00s: there's a cancel. So the idea there is to set up kind of a string of things that automatically
7799.44s: executes her wishes with respect to an individual position that's on. And there's nothing wrong with it.
7804.56s: You just have to make sure that it's structured really well and it makes sense. And you have to
7807.92s: understand the liquidity impacts of it. I actually talked about a liquidity impact for something as
7813.20s: simple as a stop limit on zero DTEs that I run. And I think I talked about that during the live
7818.96s: session Monday, maybe something like that. But yeah, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
7827.44s: Ries says, would you ever take a bullish stance on hood? Fuck no. Fucking hate Robinhood.
7833.76s: I hope like this is just before the down move. Like this is all just stupid noise before Robinhood
7841.28s: goes bankrupt down to zero. That's the only direction that this thing can go. It is the dumbest
7848.16s: looking stock. I hate its face. I hate the fact that it thinks it can go up when it can't.
7855.20s: Look at this. Look at this. 10 years ago. Well, it's not that long ago. When was this?
7860.80s: 21 high 85 down to the dirt to nothing. Stupid stock. It's so dumb.
7871.12s: So everything about it is stupid. Look at this negative. It's got price that yeah, it's just it's
7880.24s: I hate it. Stupid stock. 7 to 24. It wishes. So now there's no way I can ever be bullish on Robinhood.
7895.52s: That's one of my very few things that I've decided I will always perpetually hate. And this is now
7903.04s: gained my eye which I hate this period. So stupid. Nick says Robinhood turned off the buy button.
7911.92s: Yeah, I hate that they did that. I hate the way that they manage their margin. I hate the way
7916.08s: that they route their options. I literally hate their face. So yeah, dig it.
7922.00s: Back up. Shared where says can you review AMD 19 July Xpery does 180 straight look like
7936.16s: strong support. I don't know what that means. If like the options themselves serve as support.
7945.28s: I don't really know the I don't know your question shared where's happy to talk about it,
7950.72s: but I don't really know what it means. Michael says do you see shares of Nvidia lower by options.
7957.04s: I also don't know what that means. You all are asking fucking questions that I cannot interpret.
7964.80s: Let's see. Do you see shares of Nvidia lower by options? Yeah, I've no idea what that means.
7976.64s: Do you mean do I. I'm super confused. Yeah, sorry, Michael, if you can restate your question,
7985.52s: I'm happy to answer it, but I have no idea.
7994.80s: Okay, that's completely different. Can you review options chain AMD July 19 Xpery does look bullish?
8001.52s: Okay, so the first thing is that the options chain itself isn't what I would worry about looking
8007.12s: bullish. It's the stock options are derivatives and their value is tied to the stock. So in this case,
8018.96s: right now in general, it looks like AMD is going through a little bit of a cycling period.
8027.36s: And it looks like it's still ascending, which is good news.
8043.60s: But it looks like it's rotating over. I do like the moving averages. Those look good.
8048.72s: Six month timeframe. It's definitely declining. Three month timeframe.
8057.12s: It's got a nice pop here, but before that, it was relatively static.
8071.52s: Yeah, so it very cleanly broke above that 171 handle.
8075.52s: So this looks like, yeah, it looks like it's kind of rolling over and consolidating a little bit
8081.76s: from just like a technical perspective. It does look like it's starting to catch a bid probably
8086.56s: with the broader tech picture, but it's still in a general downslope, which I don't love.
8092.56s: That's kind of like wind in its face as I would consider it. And then looking at the options in general,
8104.72s: I really, really slight call, oh, I skew very slight though, not much.
8116.80s: Much more active call trading on the 12 July's really short term. It has earnings coming up on the 30th.
8124.08s: I think that'll be pretty important. We can see how it's done on its previous earnings.
8129.04s: Down on the last one down on the one before there up, down, down, up, down, up.
8139.92s: So kind of a general split.
8142.24s: Earnings has been coming down though, which I don't love.
8148.64s: What is this January? So January to January though is slightly up. So you're over year there,
8153.52s: that's not bad. And then April.
8159.20s: Yeah. So Cliff Notes version is, it looks kind of like a mixed bag.
8170.56s: It looks like it's going through a little bit of a consolidation period here.
8175.20s: And it looks like it's kind of following along with what tech is doing.
8179.84s: So Dr. Say is says, do you think it's really in a downtrend? I see that downtrend is people taking
8185.84s: their profits and then finding a temple bottom. It could do that. But again, like, it doesn't matter
8192.40s: why it's in a downtrend, right? Like a downtrend is a downtrend. It's a thing for a reason. Now in a
8198.64s: long-term timeframe, it's very clearly in an uptrend. So like this is okay. But like this here
8207.12s: is a downtrend, whether it's because they're selling to take profits and it's going to form a
8211.36s: bottom here if they're selling because they're sad and they want to buy a puppy. It doesn't matter.
8217.12s: What matters is if you want something to go up and it's going down, you lose money.
8221.68s: So the origin of the downtrend doesn't matter until it's not a downtrend anymore.
8227.04s: So when I look at something like this, it's starting to pivot, right? Like this on a six-month
8233.84s: daily is a downtrend. It's going down. But it did base heavily here and it is absolutely starting
8242.32s: to go up. But it has some near-term resistance to break through still. It's facing expanding,
8251.36s: selling volume, which really supports your thesis in terms of people kind of taking profits and
8257.04s: unwinding positions. But in that short-term timeframe, it very much is in a downtrend. In this case,
8266.88s: three months, uptrend, for sure. And I think the broader component is it really depends on the
8273.52s: timeframe that like the trade is being looked at for. And in this case, short-term timeframe,
8283.60s: it does not look like this is going to the moon. It looks like it had a really large sympathetic move
8289.76s: with broader tech. That's a lot of what I see here. And it does have earnings coming up on the 30th.
8298.00s: So Dr. Zayah says, yep, I was looking at it at a longer timeframe. Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
8303.44s: On a longer time frame, it for sure has an uptrend. But that question really goes back to like,
8309.60s: what's the trade or trying to do? If you're trying to trade this thing to the upside-long term,
8314.32s: then yeah, that's totally cool. If you're trying to trade it shorter-term time frames,
8318.72s: then this looks like it's trying to go up and it looks like it wants to and it looks like it's
8323.28s: starting. But again, depending on the time frame, it's flattening out here, starting to turn over.
8330.40s: And then on a six-month time frame, it's again, just starting this breakout phase. So a lot of it
8336.48s: will depend on how it behaves in here. My expectation would be that it would probably base in this level
8342.32s: a little bit like 171 to 186 until it can get a break above 186. And then my guess is it would want
8348.64s: to run up towards here like the 213 to 15 handle, something like that. So we will see.
8357.60s: Rointit says, can our strategy be do whatever Nancy Pelosi does? How do you back test that? Yeah,
8367.36s: that is literally an ideal strategy as I think about it. And her timing, I mean, she's just literally
8375.84s: a, you know, she's just so good at timing. It's the kind of like, look at it and you're like, man,
8381.04s: how are you doing so good? And she continues to do just so great. Inspiring really,
8391.28s: one of the best traders of our lifetime, we think it might be Rointitty, little did we know it's
8398.56s: Nancy Pelosi and her husband. But you know, that's just because of all the hard work and dedication
8405.20s: that they put into the craft that is probably nothing to do with information availability or
8411.60s: anything like that. There's no way. Impossible. Literally an impossibility.
8418.08s: All right, you guys. I think this now is my next longest live stream ever. This is almost
8423.60s: two and a half hours, but I love this stuff. I love connecting with you guys. I love talking about
8427.60s: this all. I do have a live stream tomorrow with my boy Newton, where we are going to talk more
8434.32s: game stop. We want to get a little bit deeper into some more of the structural components behind
8438.88s: it. And then we also want to spend a bit of time getting into kind of current state analysis
8445.20s: of what it's looking like. So that is the game plan right now for tomorrow. As always, you guys
8452.32s: know what to find me? I'm in our discord. You guys should absolutely join if you're not in there.
8456.32s: It's completely free to get in. And then I will see you guys at the live stream tomorrow. I'll see
8461.76s: the outlier pro members during the live stream on Sunday. And then I'll see everybody else on
8466.80s: the live stream on Monday. We got all sorts of shit coming out all the time. So as always,
8472.56s: being outlier. I'll see you guys later.
