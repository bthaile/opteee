0.00s:  Trading Bitcoin using options is about time.
3.84s:  So for a long time, you can only really gain exposure
6.92s:  through the underlying itself, which is fine.
8.64s:  I still have an outright Bitcoin holding in and of itself.
12.44s:  But as you all know, I'm an options trader
14.72s:  and there's really, really awesome opportunity
17.00s:  in something like Bitcoin.
19.60s:  So I want to talk about a covered strangle strategy
23.12s:  that I'm going to be running in Bitcoin for the rest of this year.
26.44s:  And I'm going to provide to you periodic updates.
28.44s:  But first, I want to introduce you to the position,
31.96s:  why it is what it is, how I'm setting it up,
34.60s:  what I've done so far, and why I'm using the ticker
38.80s:  that I'm using, which is I bit.
42.36s:  So first things first, quick overview of the covered strangle.
45.60s:  I will throw a couple links in the description
49.60s:  so you could check out the actual coverage
51.32s:  strangle option strategy.
52.56s:  I have a whole playlist on it.
53.96s:  So you can get into detail.
54.96s:  This is not going to get into that.
56.16s:  I'm just going to provide you a quick overview.
57.84s:  So you know what we're talking about.
59.40s:  And there's three components in its mature form,
63.84s:  but it's not always all three components.
66.32s:  It can be one, two, three, like that,
68.60s:  different components, two, it can be on at a given point in time.
71.88s:  So the base position, the primary profit mechanism,
74.92s:  is going to be being long as security,
77.80s:  and we're trying to play direction.
80.68s:  That's the base position that is the primary profit
84.08s:  mechanism for the straight.
85.64s:  Then there are two additional components where we include options.
90.00s:  We have a ratio covered call, and then we have cash secured puts.
95.60s:  This option component allows us to include a volatility
101.44s:  and a theta aspect to our position.
105.00s:  And it also allows us to dollar cost average
109.04s:  into the underlying using a variable entry point.
115.20s:  So what that means is we might go out into the broad market
117.96s:  and buy the shares outright.
120.12s:  That's a lot of times how it will start.
122.40s:  Then we can use things like cash secured puts.
125.52s:  I've referred to them as satellite positions.
127.96s:  What that means is the base position, long equity,
131.56s:  and we will have cash secured puts,
133.84s:  but the cool part about cash secured puts is you can move them.
137.12s:  So if something starts rolling over and you're like,
139.36s:  well, I still want to add into it,
141.16s:  but it seems like we're in a bit of a decline.
144.48s:  So I might roll the short puts so that I can get a better basis
148.68s:  as I continue to scale into the underlying.
151.60s:  Now, the entire premise of this thing is that you are trading
156.48s:  something that you want to hold.
159.00s:  The way to think about it is that if I was setting up a buy
162.96s:  and hold portfolio, this is something I would want in it,
166.36s:  meaning whatever the ultimate sizing that the trade gets,
171.04s:  the entire purpose behind the rest of this is just
173.72s:  to optimize that holding.
175.40s:  So the way that this works is I'll show you my little tracker.
178.92s:  You've probably seen different versions of this.
181.28s:  And what I'm sampling is a $125,000 allocation to Ibit.
187.92s:  What this ultimately means is I essentially would be prepared
193.56s:  to buy $125,000 of Ibit in a portfolio as shares and just hold it.
199.32s:  That's what the allocation is.
201.32s:  Then there's utilization, which is how much of that total allocation
205.44s:  I'm using at a given point in time, which is right now $80,000.
210.08s:  The reason why I'm using this amount of money
212.68s:  is I actually have a bigger position that's not part of this.
216.04s:  I'm breaking out part of the bigger position just like I'm doing
219.64s:  in the leveraged ETFs to use this as an example for us to learn
224.40s:  together about the strategy, how I operate it over a longer period
228.68s:  of time.
229.64s:  So I'm purposely picking amounts of money that is probably more
234.88s:  relatable to people for the strategy so that you can understand the sizing
239.04s:  of things relative to this amount of money.
241.88s:  So that's a quick overview of the position itself.
248.88s:  Now I want to spend a few minutes talking about why there's a specific
255.20s:  opportunity in something like Ibit.
257.48s:  And the reason why I like Ibit is because it allows me to play an overall
262.56s:  bullish disposition on Bitcoin.
264.32s:  I am bullish on Bitcoin longer term.
267.12s:  It also adds an interesting correlation relationship with equities.
274.36s:  So if we pop over to the platform and we take a look at the relationship here
279.32s:  between something like Bitcoin futures and the E minis futures,
285.68s:  the S&P 500 futures contracts, which I want you to take a look at is the
289.48s:  different correlation values for different periods of time.
294.60s:  And the first thing that you'll notice is that the correlations are kind of
299.04s:  all over the place, right?
300.72s:  We can see 90 day correlations.
302.68s:  They tend to be pretty strong.
303.96s:  60 day correlations tend to be strong.
306.28s:  Well, we can also see in shorter term time frames that the correlations
309.48s:  can invert and actually offset one another.
313.08s:  And to help, you know, see this point a little more clearly, if we grab two
318.56s:  charts of this, just so that you can see over a longer term time frame,
321.84s:  you can see that there's general alignment in terms of positive drift,
325.80s:  but the composition of the moves is very different.
328.52s:  So the reason why this fits the portfolio well is because it doesn't inherently
333.36s:  add in a hedge, but it does add a slightly different correlation to the
339.56s:  portfolio.
340.20s:  And then this also allows me to capture the volatility of something like
345.68s:  Bitcoin, because again, if we take a look first at Ibit itself,
351.48s:  you can see that it's a really volatile ticker.
353.96s:  The current implied volatility in it is 63%.
357.52s:  As a raw number, that's high.
359.96s:  Now we don't have enough data on it yet, because it's so new,
364.24s:  to give it an implied volatility percentile and an implied volatility rank.
368.96s:  So it'll be a little time before we actually have those metrics for Ibit,
373.04s:  but on a gross dollar amount, that's not an insignificant amount of volatility,
377.44s:  which is great to be able to trade that and options provide me access to that.
382.72s:  If I'm trying to trade the volatility and not through the directional price
387.28s:  movement, you can't do that with futures outright, which is one of the benefits.
393.24s:  So what is Ibit?
395.40s:  Well, I like Ibit for a few different reasons, one,
400.36s:  because it's liquid, meaning it's being accepted by the market.
404.24s:  Two, if we take a look at the overall holdings for it, it's pretty straight forward.
411.88s:  And I'll show you that here, if we go into the holdings, you can see that it's
417.88s:  essentially holding Bitcoin, a little bit of cash, and then some Bitcoin US dollars
424.12s:  currencies.
425.64s:  The reason why this is so useful is because you're getting direct exposure to Bitcoin.
431.48s:  Now, again, this isn't the same as actually holding the coin out right.
434.28s:  Obviously, but for a tradable vehicle, this is not gaining exposure to individual minors,
441.56s:  Bitcoin production facilities and whatnot, because now your position takes on a different
446.88s:  shape, rather than simply behaving like Bitcoin, the Bitcoin itself outright,
453.88s:  you're gaining exposure to the operations of Bitcoin mining, which includes operational
461.16s:  expenses for producing the Bitcoin.
462.96s:  They have to have places in order to put all of their machinery in order to mine Bitcoin
468.68s:  and stuff like that.
469.72s:  It adds other flavors to it, which I'm indifferent to, but for this position itself,
475.60s:  I just want to access the Bitcoin and this provides it.
480.08s:  So let me give you a quick update on what the position sits at right now so that going
486.24s:  forward, you'll kind of have an idea of what I'm talking about.
489.60s:  So the position as it sits is 1000 shares of Ibit at a basis of 5455.
496.16s:  And then I have two tranches of puts out one expiring this week, actually on 17,
503.04s:  Jan, and then the other in 21 Feb.
505.64s:  I have a two lot at the 52 strike and then I have a three lot at the 49 strike respectively.
512.12s:  So both of those trades are on and sitting and then you can see that I have a ratio
517.16s:  series of short calls against it.
518.68s:  I'm short six calls against the 1000 shares and the basis for the strike price
525.48s:  for the calls which are out in 21 Feb is the 60.
529.56s:  So this here is essentially the tracker that I will be using to show you how I'm
535.16s:  scaling into the trade.
536.76s:  I originally had a much smaller allocation in mind and then after talking to some people,
541.80s:  we arrived at this being a better allocation use 125K.
546.68s:  So I needed to add a bunch more, which is why a lot of this went on.
550.44s:  You can see that there's some existing options trades that have already come on,
554.12s:  come off not really worth highlighting that.
557.32s:  But as the position sits right now, we can see that I have a total of $1,000 in credit
562.84s:  in sitting from the put side.
564.92s:  I have $1,100 in credit from the call side of things.
568.76s:  These are both open trades.
571.08s:  Now the cool part about this is if you take a look at the underlying asset from when I started
576.84s:  this, it was 5725.
578.60s:  It's currently at 54 83.
580.84s:  So the percent change on that is about 4.2% to downside.
586.28s:  Yet my position is realized with profit to the upside.
591.88s:  We have a realized PNL of 365.
594.52s:  But then we also have a total PNL of up $2,800.
600.04s:  Again, that's nothing to write home about.
602.28s:  But this happens through scaling into the trade and then also having a little bit of realized
607.64s:  PNL coming from the option side.
609.24s:  And then right now there's way more potential PNL coming from the option side,
613.00s:  which will help to position a lot.
614.84s:  So this is the game plan to trade I bit with the coverage triangle.
618.44s:  And again, you guys will be able to follow along.
620.68s:  And if you have any questions, let me know.
622.60s:  Be an outlier.
623.24s:  I'll see you all later.
