0.00s: What's up outliers? Quick GameStop update as promised I'm on a weekly cadence now. We'll
5.40s: take a look at this. And really the main thing I want to talk about today is where GameStop
9.92s: currently sits. And it's because from a technical perspective, it's at a very interesting level.
14.60s: As you can tell, all of these lines have been on the chart. You've seen them before. So
18.36s: I want to talk about how prices reacting to these different thresholds and what we might
23.04s: expect. But before that, as per usual, let's get a quick recap from the Saturday stream.
29.60s: In case you weren't able to make it. And I actually want to talk about this specifically
33.28s: because we also hit a landmark this last Saturday. So we had episode 31, that is 31 Saturdays
40.88s: in a row where I've been spending at least an hour upwards of two and a half hours live
46.36s: streaming with you all looking at the GameStop saga. And we are this wrapped up part 13 of
52.72s: reviewing the top theories and due diligence that exists. Now we've been going through
58.88s: the DD library for this 13 part sub series. And we actually just wrapped up the diamond
64.72s: handbook. It's over 800 pages of due diligence that's been consolidated down along with
71.00s: AMAs and things like that. So I wanted to take a second and actually won just share that
75.16s: fact with you because that's crazy to me. That's really interesting that we looked at that
78.24s: much information together is all of you know, hopefully by now, my goal is not to spread
84.04s: hype or fudge genuinely. I am just curious about the world around me. I like learning
89.16s: things. I like exploring. So that means I don't really take what people say as law. I like
95.52s: to look at source documents and actually see the things for myself. And that's what we've
100.68s: been doing here is having a chance to actually look at things with our own eyes versus hearing
105.88s: somebody say something about something and then thinking that we know about that topic,
110.60s: which typically might be partial truths. I like to know the details. So I want to summarize
116.48s: a couple of the key themes that I came across as I was doing the series. The first theme
121.20s: is that the DD library has a glorious mix of varying levels of due diligence. There
127.40s: are a lot of things in there that I would objectively summarize as you know, people
134.40s: that are trying, but not really anything you can objectively point at and say we found
140.48s: something objective here. Like a lot of it is people sharing their opinions, their thoughts
144.16s: and things like that, which I'm not discounting that. That's actually a really important process
148.28s: in our path to exploring things as to postulate ideas. So just want to be clear, I'm not talking
153.72s: bad against that. There's just a lot of that in there. And then there's actually the
157.72s: section of DD that I have to be honest, I am most interested in. And there are pieces
163.44s: in there that are really, really high quality research that source documents are cited.
172.36s: And there are a lot of dots being connected. Those are my favorites because it removes
178.32s: the inobjectiveness of our opinions. And we're looking at objective facts reality as it
186.24s: sits. And there are a number of issues that were raised that I saw in the DD library that
192.64s: I think are worth recapping for everybody. And I want to be clear, none of this I don't
196.88s: think is going to be new news to you. I think it's going to be mostly recapping. But the
202.88s: first thing is the key issues that we came across in the DD library, things like naked
209.24s: shorting, things like FTDs, things like conflicts of interest, there are varying degrees of
215.64s: all of those. And also I should say not in transparent lack of transparent markets and
223.48s: reporting, that's a big one actually, that would be the fourth one I would list. And of
227.52s: those things, something that really stuck out to me that is partially disheartening, but
234.08s: also partially not shocking is a lot of the issues that the DD library, specifically
241.40s: the diamond handbook that was going back to explore, they a lot of these were written
245.60s: back in 2021 and they're citing documents from, you know, the prior decade, almost two
250.80s: decades before that. There was a video that we came across that was talking about Wall Street
256.04s: and a lot of the issues with Wall Street. And there was a section in there with Dr. Susan
259.88s: Trimbath. And she's talking about naked shorting. The sad part about this is that part of
267.56s: the video was shot in like the early 2000s. She was talking about something that she was in
275.48s: the video, citing something back like 10 years. So that takes us back to 1990s into the 2000s
283.64s: as different versions of these videos were made, talking about naked shorting. And it's still
290.84s: a conversation point. It's still a thing today. The reason why that's so important to
297.16s: identify is because that tells us very clearly with the powers that be the various conflicts of
304.12s: interest that exist and the current incentive structure. There is a lack of incentive to actually
312.28s: institute change. And it's important remember that because the only way then to eventually make
318.12s: that happen is by maintaining steady pressure on the issue, which the GameStop community has done
325.08s: incredible job doing to be completely honest because it's been a long time. And the same drum
329.88s: continues to be beat. Now to highlight one of these conflicts of interest, we have our fan favorite,
336.36s: which the purple here looks dashing. But Janet Yellen is you guys know she was the Federal Reserve
342.76s: Chair. And she disclosed a list of more than 50 paid speaking events. This is all old news,
347.80s: by the way. But I want you to look at the firms that she's speaking at. Oldman Sachs,
353.24s: Barclays, Citadel. There's a lot of these places that people who are in government positions.
358.92s: And I also want to be clear, this is for the Federal Reserve, right? Like this isn't the SEC.
363.48s: But what I'm highlighting is I imagine pretty much everybody in those kinds of government positions
369.48s: has this to deal with because here's the reality. You have people that spend their entire career
375.32s: building up their their proficiency. Then they go into government. She didn't make bad money in
380.92s: government. But let's also be realistic. You don't make great money in government. Most people
384.84s: that are going into government to go in to try and build a report. They try to build experience
390.04s: a resume that then is in demand by the civilian slash corporate world afterwards. People in the
395.32s: military do this too. And the reason is because you spend your entire career building skills and
400.52s: then you work in a place like the government that doesn't fully reward them again. I had not
404.36s: seen that they get paid terribly. But if you're looking at the kind of caliber of people that are
408.76s: rising to these roles, they're exceedingly smart. These are the kind of people that would be making
412.52s: a killing in the civilian world. So they're in these positions. And then they're making decisions
420.04s: based on what they are trying to do. But then they're also making decisions based on understanding
425.48s: that this is part of their game plan. The fact that they're going to say, I'm going to go work in
429.96s: government for a bit. I'm not going to make what I'm worth at this point. But I can supplement that
435.80s: by going doing speaking engagement, that Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citadel, and so on and so forth.
441.00s: So then I can supplement essentially what I'm trying to make. This is the conflict of interest.
446.60s: Because if I'm the Federal Reserve Chair and again, I'm not getting paid what I think I'm worth.
452.28s: And I can go speak to Citadel and make $292,500 from a single speech. That's a lot of money.
461.80s: So unless you come across people who are completely impervious to money, which most of us
466.36s: aren't. Let's keep it real. If a lot of us were in the same scenario, it would be a tough trade-off.
472.28s: And who knows what decisions we all would make. We don't know. We're not in the position.
475.96s: So I'm not sitting here judging her or anybody else directly. I'm simply talking about the facts
482.28s: and the reality as it is. The fact is this being part of this absolutely would create a conflict
488.76s: of interest. Because then when you're in these kinds of positions, the things you do are slightly
493.80s: slightly integrated thinking of what impact might it have on my ability to do these things for
500.92s: these kinds of people. So the takeaway here is that not that the system is so fully corrupt and
510.12s: nothing can be done, right? That is that getting to that level of dismay is always sad.
515.24s: Because then it's essentially just throwing our hands up and quitting. And I don't really believe
519.32s: in that. But there is a reality that this kind of thing is going to take a while. And it's going
523.64s: to continue taking a while. Now, Reg show just got an update that's actually kind of cool.
527.24s: That's going to start requiring funds that are over, I think it was $100 million. I forgot
532.76s: the exact amount to start reporting their shorts. So things like that, I think are good. It's slow.
539.64s: And it's a function of a coalescence of getting the right people in the place that aren't
544.60s: fully motivated by the potential money they can make in the speeches after and actually trying to
549.08s: make a meaningful change. So all of that came really to the forefront of this whole thing. So
556.20s: that stuff aside, we have now the rest of the DD library to go through, which I'm really,
562.28s: really stoked to do. But there's so much more to explore because the story continues to unfold.
569.48s: One of the things is the change for Cohen shares from RC ventures to his personal name. And we
576.36s: spent a while hypothesizing about that. We even recruited chat GPT to help us war game and think
581.72s: of different scenarios. Why this might happen? Why this might make sense. So there's a lot to unravel
586.60s: here and it continues to be interesting to me. So all of that aside, I want to take a quick look
591.80s: at GameStop where we sit today because I do think we're at a very important level and I mentioned
595.88s: this a couple times. So when we see stocks downtrend like this, and when we see them breaking out of
602.92s: the downtrends like this here, this initial downtrend that you can see drawn, it's really important what
608.68s: it does in this next section. And unfortunately, a lot of this coalesced with the terror of
614.84s: conversation that was happening on Friday, then the subsequent gap down that happened on the third.
620.52s: So right now, GameStop seems to be following a lot of the broader market beta. But we are now at what
628.04s: I consider to be a essentially critical level. The reason why I think this 20 and a half, 25 and a
634.04s: half level is so critical is because below this, there has been very few transactions. That means not
640.76s: a lot of people are transacting in GameStop at these prices until you get all the way down here
645.40s: to 2226. So for me, I also remember have that coverage strangle position at an options trade
652.68s: that I've been sharing with you in GameStop. So this also matters to me because again, I'm a trader.
659.64s: So I already told you I unwound some of the shares not too long ago. And the reason for unwinding some
666.68s: of the shares was because for a trader lens, I can't make money holding stock if it's going down.
674.36s: That's one of the big things, right? And I know that that's like, well, yeah, no shit Sherlock.
680.60s: But the reason why that matters is because it informs short term positioning. So for me,
686.84s: if we start to see meaningful breaking down below this level, I probably will lighten up even more
692.44s: shares and continue to trade at via cash secure puts to take advantage of the downside volatility.
698.36s: The volatility in here has been absolutely massive. Take a look at the yellow line here and take a
702.92s: look at the gap that you see between the yellow line and the gray line. That's representing historic
707.72s: variance risk premiums, which are still very significant. So I took a stroll through
714.36s: the option chain as per usual to see if anything stuck out to me. So the first thing we can take a
719.56s: look at together is literally just to see what the overall tenor is of movement. And it's
727.80s: lightning up. Everything that I see here is very, very much lightning up. So what I mean by that is
734.04s: if you take a look at the overall call volume and put volume, it's been contracting since essentially
743.88s: the end of last week. There was a slight uptick and then it rolled back over.
748.84s: So really, really light overall trading activity that we see in GameStop from an options perspective.
755.88s: I didn't see any big trades coming through that really stuck out to me that, you know, like,
761.80s: hey, these are big massive trades. There's really nothing like that that's catching my eye. If we
768.44s: sort this by premium over the last week, the biggest raise for 36,000 and that's on the call
773.80s: side, which is good. But yeah, just really, really light. Now, if we take a look at the options chain
778.84s: itself, we can still see it's maintaining heavy call skew over the put side. And that continues to
784.28s: be an important data point because I monitored the relationship between here, which has been about
789.40s: steady. Ponds of calls traded today against the puts. So the activity on a daily basis still continues
795.80s: to be very, very call heavy. And it's not people just buying or selling. It's kind of like split,
803.56s: right? Because you can see 32% of the volume today was at the bid or below and 33% was at the
808.68s: offer or above. So these are people kind of doing both things. Selling calls, buying calls, it's kind
813.80s: of a split volatility on a relative basis is super low. It's not even above 80 anywhere in these
821.48s: front cycles, which is nuts. Normally, this maintains over 100% of all. So volatility is very quiet.
828.44s: So that tells me from an expectation standpoint, it is looking like a pretty quiet period in front
833.96s: of us. So that's stuff aside. You know, I'm still going to keep doing the updates, keeping an eye on
838.84s: it. As always, if you have any questions, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know,
842.52s: be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
