643.84s: uh
644.64s: you can
647.44s: you
648.80s: you
650.80s: you
652.80s: can
652.96s: you
654.80s: Can
655.56s: sometime
656.96s: break down?
658.80s: particular. This is talking about this price action. And I know everybody that follows
665.28s: GameStop, especially the diehards, we kind of look at it and we just dismissively say,
669.96s: well, the price is fake, you know, the head user's just trying to put it into the dirt.
673.60s: And then we just kind of write it off as that. And I don't blame you. But again, my entire
678.84s: message and my entire purpose of doing these kinds of things is try to offer a slightly
683.16s: different perspective. And it's not, I'm not saying that that's not happening. But what
688.24s: I am saying is I don't think that's just what's happening. I think that there's a mix of
693.84s: forces at play here. And I do think that it exhibits some level of standard market
699.90s: forces. But then obviously it has a lot of injections that don't follow standard market
706.40s: forces. The reason why that differentiation is really important is because as we're analyzing
711.88s: the stock, we have to keep that in mind. Because what I typically tell people is like, well,
716.84s: if that is we say the hegey's wanted it into the dirt, then why isn't it in the dirt?
721.80s: Right? Like we say that they're all powerful. We say that they essentially control the price.
726.72s: If that is fully the case, why isn't it lower? Right? We're saying that's what they want.
731.84s: So why isn't it? So again, that's not to say that that's not happening. I think we,
737.48s: as we go through the DD library, there's literally clear evidence that it's happening
742.34s: to a degree. But the broader point I'm trying to make is that it's not all that's happening.
748.80s: There are other participants in the stock, like you and I and other people and other institutions
755.04s: that aren't inherently trying to sell or box something down into the dirt manipulate
759.12s: the price, those kinds of things. And they enter the equation. Now,
767.60s: who's the dominant force? It's a great question. What I can tell you,
772.36s: the dominant force isn't is the hedge funds. And I know that probably surprises a lot of people,
777.88s: people when, like when I say something like that, people will probably say, well,
782.24s: how could you possibly say that? The reason why I say that is because if we think
789.72s: about hedge funds being short, they don't want this. An entity that supremely short something
798.72s: like GameStop would not want the stock, especially if they're short down here at 15,
805.60s: they don't want the stock up at 65. So there's an effect that starts to take the thing out of
815.60s: their hands to a degree. Then there's the structural re intervention. And whether we think
822.20s: that's inclusion with the hedge funds, the market structure, you know, writ large, whatever,
826.24s: but there is another inject that then stifles this and stops it. But why if hedge funds fully
835.52s: control the price themselves, why even go through this? It shows that they're not fully in control.
841.24s: And it's important again for us to acknowledge that fact that there are areas that they are forced out of
849.36s: control because from a hedge funds perspective, as we typically think, if they just want to drive it
855.28s: down to zero, why wouldn't they just do that? They're not. They can't. And it's because there are
861.56s: other factors here. So that's a good thing, actually, in my opinion. Also a good thing is you guys
868.56s: can't probably see it. I don't know if you can see that little rubber band on the tip of my
871.88s: finger. I'm kind of like a very simple person. But I got this when I bought a new hard drive to
877.92s: put stuff on my TV or my wife and it had this little rubber band on it. And I really like this
883.56s: rubber band. It's very satisfying to just pull on it. So as you see me here playing with this,
889.20s: that's what I'm doing just so that you know, it's up like this is fun to do. Pretty sure I'm on
895.48s: the spectrum. But I enjoy this. So back to the stock, back to where we are current day. So now we
904.84s: have a slightly new picture to pay attention to. I'll clear out. I don't want to clear this out
910.68s: to be honest. I kind of want to keep these. Some just really, really interested in these value areas.
916.12s: Yeah, man. What do I do? What I want to do is actually draw a couple more lines. But I don't want
923.40s: this to become like just madness with lines. Well, let me just try to, I got an idea. I got an idea.
930.92s: I got an idea. This is what we'll do. And then so that this is kind of the value area that we're
941.40s: looking at right now. And if you take a look at the volume node that's being built here, there are
947.64s: again, lots of people willing to transact at this price handle. And again, I'll just reiterate
953.48s: quickly from the last stream that we did, there hasn't been a fundamental underlying change in
958.28s: GameStop to really even loosely cover what this is, meaning this drop, whatever this was. So because
969.16s: of that fact, and because we continue to see a lot of people transacting in here, this to me is
975.16s: still the area to beat specifically to the upside to the downside. I think the floor is starting to
980.44s: be generally priced in again, at least in terms of what information is currently available,
985.72s: available to us today right now. That doesn't mean that that's always going to be what the case
991.16s: is. But right now, this seems like the general zone it's looking to be in. We can see that there's
995.96s: a general floor being priced in. This is now the big question. How does the next couple days fare? How
1003.40s: do the next couple days fare against this broader descending trend as we continue to bump up against
1009.80s: this floor? So there's one other effect to be aware of from a broader technical analysis perspective.
1016.36s: Is as we have descending channels like this, the more times that the stock will break out of the
1024.92s: descending channel, the less strong that general direction becomes and obviously we move in favor of
1031.88s: a consolidation. So it's broken out of the descending channel once and it's essentially going to
1037.40s: have to make a choice on it sometime next week again. So next week will be, I think, an important
1043.72s: an important week. Now, if it does again, start breaking to the downside to anybody's game. It really
1051.80s: is. It's really hard to tell because what I can tell you is that there is nobody transacting in
1057.56s: here. I have a hard time thinking that the stock would traverse this entire space. It just seems
1065.00s: unlikely to me, but just because it seems unlikely doesn't mean it's not doable or not possible.
1071.24s: So I would write that as possible, seemingly unlikely. Now, from an options perspective,
1079.32s: let me move you guys over here. I think we have, yeah, there we go. So this is the latest
1088.44s: coverage strangle update and funny enough, I think right after Wednesday, what was Wednesday, the 29th,
1094.36s: right? Yeah, the 29th. So that I was thinking that the humor of it because right after the 29th,
1101.64s: I hadn't made any changes whatsoever in the position and then, you know, as fate would have it
1107.96s: literally the day after I ended up making changes to the position. And that's just from managing
1113.72s: the trade as it sits. So I won't belabor anything in here. You guys can all see kind of what's going on.
1119.88s: The main notes to take away is I did add a little bit of shares and I adjusted the short puts
1127.24s: in the short calls. None of them were in the money. They all came down at a profit. That's,
1133.72s: yeah, this is still a profit. It's just the coloring on this is wrong for whatever reason.
1138.20s: So that's that's all there is to this one. So right now the game stop position in the this part
1145.72s: of the portfolio is 250 shares at 28 21. So we're utilizing 19,500 bucks. Only 28% of that is in the
1156.92s: stock. 50% of that is in cash secured puts. That is by design. The reason I'm doing that is because
1166.12s: of this is going down. I don't want to buy shares right now. I want to wait until it starts to
1173.40s: level off. Now the reason why I had bought shares on the 30th is because it looked like after this
1181.08s: breakdown day on the 29th when it broke out of this consolidation or I'm sorry out of the down
1186.92s: trend into consolidation and it gapped up a little bit started showing strength. It looked like
1192.20s: we were going to start appreciating but also notice how little I bought about 50 shares.
1197.24s: And that's just like a prospecting position. The reason why is because the overall stock component
1202.36s: of the trade was too light for what I wanted. But I also am I don't want to call it smart enough
1209.16s: because I'm really not that smart. But I'm experienced enough at this point to know that entering too
1215.32s: aggressively at that point, meaning here when the stock was up at I'll show you when the stock was
1224.44s: up here is I know better. And the reason why I know better is because I know that that's a very
1230.28s: tentative spot for a stock after it just comes out of a downside consolidation. It's not yet broke
1236.60s: up above local highs. So it's a prospecting position. It's putting on a little bit of a trade
1241.48s: to build up the stock position just a little bit. But there's a reason why I prefer to remain
1247.24s: primarily in the short puts. The reason why I'm remaining in the short puts is twofold. The first
1254.20s: one is because I have a much better basis that I can work off of. So if these continue to go unassigned,
1262.84s: what I will do is start to split this. And I'll trade something like a six lot. I will have three
1269.48s: lots further out 30 delta something like that. And then I'll have three lots that are actually
1274.60s: closer to spot price to start trying to pick up some more shares. The stock needs to consolidate
1282.20s: before I do that. Buying stock as it's going down is not good business for a trader. Now I
1289.16s: emphasize that point heavily because from an investor's perspective, it's kind of whatever you
1293.40s: want it to be, right? But from a trader's perspective, it's not from a trader's perspective,
1298.04s: I'm here to make money. So that's why the positioning is the way it is. The other reason,
1303.80s: the second reason, as I told you, there's two for this is because volatility right now is still high
1308.76s: on the put side. And the reason why volatility is high on the put side is because of the drop. As
1313.96s: stocks tend to drop, you will typically see an expansion in put side volatility because people
1319.32s: will be buying puts to hedge to the downside. So I am selling them that risk. And I'm taking the risk
1325.72s: on for them essentially because I don't mind holding the stock obviously, but I'm going to collect
1331.32s: a premium in excess of what the otherwise normalized volatility should be on these puts. So
1340.28s: all of that word stuff comes down to these are relatively expensive for what they are. So I sold them.
1348.28s: It sums it up. Okay. So now let's take a look at the options chain. And we have a bit of an
1357.72s: offload on the call side. So we're at 513 against 165. So still really heavy calls to you,
1366.20s: but also quite a bit lighter than what it was before on a relative basis. From a volume perspective,
1373.80s: there was a lot of volume being pushed out into this next front expiration. So if we take a quick
1381.00s: peak at open interest, and then if we take a quick peak at this upcoming week, it's 7,8,000
1387.56s: calls against 12,000 puts. So heavy, but not crazy. The next biggest expiration still is 21
1395.72s: Feb. And then anything close to that, not really. Yeah, not really. The only other two is the
1404.44s: March and the April. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Was it April and June? Yeah, April and June, my bad.
1409.56s: April and June are both over 100,000. The other one is just 21 Feb. So quiet. That's all that
1415.00s: boils down to the option chain isn't exceedingly busy right now. So that's that. All right. So what I
1422.60s: want to do now before we get into the DD library and all that is I actually want to poke through.
1428.44s: I'm sure it'll be on X somewhere, but I just want to look up Ryan Cohen and the change that he made
1438.76s: so that we can do a little bit of homework. Ryan, Owen, I'm sure that there will be
1453.48s: no.
1464.76s: No. Okay. So let's just look through this together and see what this is. So this looks like
1471.72s: somebody thinks the move. Also, it is real out of Sonya got knocked the fuck out in case you guys
1479.08s: didn't know. And then he got upset and he was like pissed off again for the stoppage. And it's
1483.64s: just surprising at this point because it's like, dude, just don't. If you stop getting knocked down,
1490.20s: then they're less inclined to stop the fight. But you're in these like super compromised positions.
1494.84s: Anyways, I still respect a ton of respect for Izzy. By the way, he's a fantastic striker. But
1500.28s: yeah, you got to knock the fuck out. So this leads me to believe that people think by making the
1508.36s: switch, it now means they're going to have to deliver the shares. This is hilarious, by the way.
1519.72s: Now, okay, here's the next. Why do we think this? This is this really
1529.16s: infuses me. So why do we think that they're struggling to find the 36 million shares
1536.04s: given the recent offerings? I don't understand that.
1543.56s: I don't think the shares are really that scarce anymore.
1552.52s: I'm just trying to see if there's anything else. A merger and acquisition.
1568.60s: Moves 36 million GMI shares to Canada making them no longer available to US short sellers.
1588.36s: Is that
1589.24s: just struggle?
1595.08s: You struggle with the theory. Let's see, first I'm going to ask Chatcha BT.
1599.72s: I'm going to use the new model. I'm going to use the
1603.00s: 03. Yeah, let's do
1615.96s: to use 01 or 03. I'll try it 01 because I think that's the deeper one.
1622.76s: So let's do some prompt engineering here.
1625.96s: Why did Ryan Cohen transfer his GMI shares from?
1639.64s: What was the original, I'm going to move this chat so I can ask you guys questions.
1644.36s: What was the original location of the entity that he held him? Was it Delaware meaning US-based?
1651.48s: Is that correct?
1656.20s: And then I'm going to ask Chatcha BT. Why did Ryan Cohen transfer his GMI shares
1661.72s: from US-based entity?
1666.68s: And then did he do it into his personal name? Or I think it was
1672.20s: Delaware, Zach's is Delaware. Okay, cool. Thank you.
1679.16s: There was somebody that has the documentation into his personal name. Yeah, okay, here we go.
1683.56s: That ought to Kevin. Also, it seems like people have mixed opinion on Kevin. I've talked to him
1690.60s: a couple times. I was actually going to connect with him again, but I don't know the.
1698.68s: Yeah, okay, so it's from RC Ventures in Delaware. Okay.
1704.36s: From his entity, RC Ventures based out of Delaware.
1713.00s: Into his personal name.
1727.96s: Where this where he is a Canadian citizen.
1736.84s: First, let's see that. I'm not giving it all the excess details of GameStop being like a
1744.68s: really heavily shorted stock and all the ideas.
1750.68s: So let's, while that's reasoning through that, let's talk about it, right? Let's reason through it.
1757.64s: So, Zach says, do you think Cohen converted shares due to his divorce?
1764.52s: I don't think so because in the divorce, I didn't know he's going through divorce.
1773.80s: And I actually have no idea where he would be. Is he? Well, first, yeah, actually,
1777.64s: Coffee and Donuts asked a great question. I just kind of took it as truth since somebody brought it up.
1781.64s: But like, is he getting divorced? Do we know that?
1783.56s: I think that's a, then is a good starting point, actually.
1802.92s: Okay, well, anyways, whether he is or isn't anything beyond that, I mean, we could look it up, but
1809.32s: I don't think, I don't think there's any ish with that because if he puts it in his personal name,
1818.36s: I feel like that just makes him more susceptible than anything.
1825.48s: Lauren says, I'm not sure in some universities, great guy, but he can suck a D. Oh, interesting.
1830.36s: I didn't know that. Did he do something?
1832.92s: You guys obviously know, I don't know anything about most of this stuff. So I'm learning.
1842.52s: But yeah, I'm curious why the, why the disposition. I was also learning there is that dude from
1849.88s: the documentary we were watching, one of those attorneys and somebody was saying that like, he was
1854.84s: just kind of scrolling people over, which is also really interesting.
1862.52s: Coffee says, isn't Florida state to hide your money of getting divorced, can grip and move there?
1867.40s: Well, they probably move there for taxes. The most people go to Florida for the tax treatment.
1872.04s: Delaware is actually a really, really friendly, well, privacy friendly state to come up with and
1879.16s: to base your entities out of. So a lot of people will use Delaware for that reason.
1884.52s: But for people moving to Florida, the majority is for tax and to try to offload some of their
1893.00s: tax burden, which can blame them. Shit's expensive.
1898.84s: Gabb says it wasn't West who screwed over people. It was people pretending to raise funds to
1911.00s: higher West. See that, that's what I'm talking about. There's always so much fucking shit behind all
1915.56s: of these. And I'm a natural skeptic, not because I don't trust people actually, as you could tell,
1921.56s: by the divorce comment, actually inherently trust people. But I still like to see source information.
1928.12s: So yeah, the thing about that lawyer kind of makes sense. I don't know what's true or not,
1933.32s: because I haven't seen anything, but I'm just curious.
1938.52s: Lauren says he just strikes me as a super douche brutal. That's a, I don't even want to know
1945.00s: how I come off to people. I can only imagine the kind of, if there's other permutations of douche,
1952.28s: Lauren probably has, because I also draw Lauren with these gargantuan giraffe legs,
1961.24s: which I just have to imagine puts me in the fucking, in the shit column. So yeah, I don't
1969.40s: even want to fucking know. Mashton says the divorce thing is, but wife's name is wrong. Okay, got it.
1976.44s: Yeah, regardless of all that, honestly, it doesn't really matter is because if you put stuff
1981.72s: in your personal name going through anything like that, you're at, it's a bigger risk than having
1986.92s: it in an entity. So yeah, I mean, decoupling the two speaking in generalities, yeah, it wouldn't
1994.44s: make sense for that perspective. All right, let's see what GPT01 says. Okay.
2003.40s: It says the shift could involve tax regulatory or compliance or something else entirely.
2009.40s: They might involve personal control voting rights, tax planning, regulatory issues,
2013.48s: or organizational restructuring, speculation on his strategy or future plans could be a factor too.
2021.24s: He may have transferred the shares for personal tax or corporate structure reasons,
2027.08s: preparing for a Canadian move. Is he, isn't he already in Canada? I don't know, for organizational
2032.92s: changes, speculation is abundant, but no official statement exists.
2037.72s: Collins SEC form four details could hint at a personal preference reorganizing to avoid LLC
2043.16s: maintenance. I can't imagine that. Collins reasons for transferring shares could involve tax exposure
2048.92s: reduction preparation for a corporate action like, ah, interesting. This one actually is slightly
2055.40s: interesting. So Collins reasons for transferring shares could involve tax exposure reduction, which
2062.76s: I can't imagine that being the case because LLCs are passed through entities anyways. So,
2069.88s: yeah, I just, I don't think that's going to help them and the difference between having it in an
2075.16s: LLC or not. I don't think there's a big change there, but listen to the other part of this.
2081.16s: Preparation for corporate action like a takeover or spin off.
2086.60s: We have to ask more about that one because I don't know the, I don't know how that works,
2092.60s: but I want to know. Without knowing him, the transfer shares seems likely due to personal
2099.96s: financial gains, the state planning or preparation for a corporate transaction or reorganization.
2104.84s: All right, so let's explain that.
2106.68s: Yeah.
2111.48s: Um, and you expand on the transfer and relation
2121.24s: and the transaction.
2122.44s: Gip to corporate.
2129.00s: Brutcher reasons.
2138.84s: Let's see why that might be.
2145.96s: Brad says it could be from M and A. It's easier if it's in your personal name for some reason.
2150.36s: I don't know if that's true to be honest because again, depending on who, who and what holds
2157.72s: RC ventures LLC, which I imagine would be RC. Maybe somebody else of his choosing. You don't,
2164.28s: it can just be you. So from that perspective, it's the same. It's essentially the same as you
2171.32s: because he would be the, the manager for the LLC, which essentially would control the actions of it.
2177.72s: So I don't think that's true.
2181.00s: Yeah.
2183.00s: Let's see what GPT says.
2188.12s: Activist investment vehicle versus direct ownership. Purpose of RC ventures. Activist
2193.56s: investors or major. See, this is cool because this is a brand new fresh blank chat
2200.04s: with chat GPT01. And it's already doing research on him in the background through the
2205.08s: reasoning function. And it's talking about the activist investor side of it, which is interesting.
2212.12s: But it says actress investors or major shareholders often set up special purpose LLCs
2216.60s: are holding companies like RC ventures to accumulate shares in target company. Now,
2220.60s: LLC can help manage risk isolate liabilities consolidate funding for multiple partners that
2225.08s: are once Ryan Cohen became more formally involved with GameStop joined the board became chairman
2231.00s: influence corporate strategy. Also, interesting because I didn't tell GPT any of that. So it's
2236.44s: I'm highlighting that there's actually some pretty good accuracies in this reasoning because normally
2240.20s: I don't trust it. It may no longer have been necessary or cost effective to maintain a separate
2244.92s: holding vehicle solely for GME shares. Not that expensive to maintain an LLC. So I don't think
2249.40s: that's that because the dude's also super fucking rich. You may have planned to use RC ventures for
2254.28s: other investments or wind it down after fulfilling its initial purpose in an activist campaign.
2259.56s: I doubt that if I'm not mistaken RC ventures probably been around for a while. I don't know that
2263.72s: either, but I'm just speculating. Direct ownership can appear more transparent from the perspective
2276.76s: of other shareholders in the market at large. This is funny reinforcing Cohen's commitment to GameStop's
2285.32s: turn around. So this already did all the research on fucking GameStop and the context and its
2290.68s: bringing all of those elements into this response, which is really impressive to me.
2298.12s: As chairman Cohen is subject to ongoing disclosure obligations, sometimes having shares in a
2302.52s: personal account makes reporting a compliance more straightforward than holding them through layers
2307.00s: of an LLCs. That could be a thing. Corporations often prefer direct ownership with the
2315.96s: principal shareholder rather than intermediate entity can simplify communications about voting
2320.68s: and stuff maybe, but since he's so involved, I doubt it.
2329.00s: When Cohen was purely an activist investor, it made sense to aggregate shares in a holding
2333.24s: LLC that could lead a proxy fight of necessary after securing board representation and stepping into
2337.96s: the chairman role. Some of the original legacy for holding the shares and RC ventures may no longer
2342.44s: be needed. So I think chat GPT seems to continually lean towards this efficiency concept. And I actually
2348.12s: don't think it's about like decreasing administrative overhead. I just don't see that because he's
2353.80s: more than capable of doing it and he has this stuff in place. Okay, here we go. The tax conversation.
2359.00s: Canadian versus US tax rules since Cohen is Canadian, the interplay of US corporate tax law,
2365.56s: state, Delaware and Canadian tax law can get complicated. Depending on his personal tax planning,
2370.84s: it might be more favorable to hold GME shared directly rather than through a US LLC. So it could
2376.84s: be something between the interplay between Canadian citizenship and the domestic holding.
2383.56s: Does Cohen have kids? Is Ryan Cohen have kids? Do you guys know?
2393.56s: A coffee says safer to have shares in Canada if the market crashes, I don't think so.
2397.16s: It's the shares would be on the same exchanges. It'd be what it would be.
2404.28s: Do you guys know if he has kids?
2408.84s: Another thing that I don't know.
2413.64s: Brad says I think too. Okay, so we don't know. Let me look. Does Ryan Cohen have babies?
2430.92s: Little humans.
2434.44s: This says no, he doesn't have any children.
2444.04s: This says they have a son.
2460.04s: This says they have two kids.
2462.52s: This says there's no kids.
2476.36s: Okay, well, the key takeaway is that he may or may not have kids.
2484.28s: Anyways, this, like this, I would assume that would be his kid, but I don't
2489.00s: fucking know that could be AI generated. I don't know his family.
2492.20s: Anyways, the reason I'm asking is because it says that there could be an estate planning
2496.76s: component to it. But yeah.
2502.52s: So anyways, after going through like even this general overview with
2510.12s: GPT-01, it doesn't look like there's like some sort of clear thing we can point that.
2523.88s: That Lauren says I'm glad his kids can't be Googled for real though. Yeah, that is it's better for
2527.80s: them for sure. So I guess the way to think about it here is there's no
2538.68s: no. Since there's no definitive answer, it's unlikely that it's like for this very
2543.64s: hyper-specific reason that people can cleanly point towards. Now let's ask it the other question though.
2549.40s: So when Cohen, when RC moved his shares, does that force, I want to see the exact terms people
2559.48s: are using? So this is divorce. I don't think that's correct.
2567.40s: Believe in it doesn't matter.
2578.92s: Yeah, so this is exactly what's happening right now.
2588.20s: What does this say? That's nothing.
2591.40s: Yeah, we already did this.
2600.92s: All right, let's just see if we can figure out.
2606.44s: Let's just see if we can figure out. Does that force
2611.80s: the corresponding shares to be located and delivered?
2621.72s: Good disk cause some sort of port squeeze.
2631.24s: Or is there enough availability of shares that this might not be in issue?
2651.16s: In general, when an investor transfers shares from one account to another to from an
2660.84s: LLC to their personal name, it does not automatically force a broker anyone else to locate and
2666.52s: deliver shares in a way that would trigger short squeeze. The move typically happens at an
2671.72s: internal book entry at the brokerage or custodian level. The meaning the shares are
2677.80s: re-registered under the new owner, but do not necessarily need to be pulled from the market.
2686.04s: Yeah. So and that's, I mean, from my broader perspective, anyways, even putting the idea of
2697.56s: whether the shares moved aside, looking at it from the function of share availability,
2705.08s: there's a lot of shares now, right? There's 446,800 shares they just did two offerings. So
2712.44s: I'm really not sure that with the two recent offerings that the shares are going to be that
2722.68s: hard to find. And we've looked at information like what are the days to cover? We can look at that
2728.76s: really quick, just at a curiosity. This one I honestly don't trust because it's typically
2733.08s: all over the place, but let's just take a look. Do me.
2739.40s: Short interest. Normally used fintail. So this is actually highest fuck. I'm not even going to lie.
2749.56s: Nine and a half days to cover is crazy work at only 7.7.
2758.20s: What the fuck?
2763.32s: Does it make any sense? 4.5? Let's do a little math real quick.
2779.56s: So 4 million five like we have to look at the average. I don't want to look at that.
2785.08s: What is this? 32 138. Again, this one again, like this number, I fully would expect to be
2797.40s: not trustworthy. But this would be number, number short shares. And then let's take a look at a
2807.08s: couple different scenarios. This will be five. I know what the number five looks like. Five
2818.92s: day average volume. What the fuck Eric spell right you fucking buffoon?
2825.88s: Is the keyboard slightly off? 20 day average volume.
2833.64s: Naryl one days to cover. Naryl two days to cover.
2851.08s: So let's see. I didn't want to close that.
2863.16s: Okay. Five days is what's called 3.9 mil. And then 6.7.6.6760.
2893.64s: So it's something between 8.2 and 4.8. Yeah, because this just looks high. It's such a short
2915.32s: float in total short interest of 32 mil. Because the other thing is volume is absolutely
2926.60s: come down quite a lot.
2929.16s: I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do that.
2935.40s: I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do that.
2941.40s: A message says hypothetically could he use his shares for a loan to buy something what it need to be on his own name it wouldn't.
2948.20s: So you can take out margin loans against your assets as long as you're tied to the assets. So it doesn't have to be in your name. It's a great, great guess. But yeah, I don't think that either.
2959.48s: So this is what right now.
2962.28s: Days to cover would look like which this is a little more in line with what I would expect to be honest.
2970.44s: Yeah, this is 2.9 days to cover.
2974.44s: 32 140.
2975.96s: What is this reporting that's close enough.
2992.44s: Let's just see if we can find more.
2999.56s: Because these other ones are probably using a longer term.
3007.72s: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, see this looks right to me.
3011.32s: 3.7. Most of these, so for those that don't know what I'm doing.
3016.44s: To figure out the days to cover, all you do is take the average volume or for whatever period you're interested in.
3023.56s: And then you divide the total number of short shares by that volume.
3028.36s: And the idea is at current steady state volume. This is how many days it would take to cover.
3034.84s: Here's the reality of things though is that there's actually a scenario 3.
3040.44s: And this is what I would consider to be a more accurate depiction of this is and by scenario 2, I obviously mean scenario 3.
3053.00s: The more accurate depiction of this would be like surge average volume.
3060.44s: And what I mean by surge average volume is we can clearly see that there are periods
3065.80s: where volume really starts to pick up heavy.
3069.72s: And this is during periods when short covering starts to jack up.
3074.68s: Right, so you can see that the stock can handle much more average volume.
3078.84s: So if we go here, the five day average volume is 139 against 46.7.
3085.24s: So let's just take the midpoint, 139 million.
3090.84s: 46.7.
3096.12s: The average between those is 92.850.
3109.72s: 92.50.
3117.48s: So then if we do the math using that surge volume,
3128.84s: it's like three days.
3130.92s: So the main point here is that the stock can absolutely handle pretty significant expansion
3136.36s: in volume. So all of this is to go back to the idea and the current, my current hypothesis is
3143.24s: that it doesn't look like the conditions for a short squeeze are massive right now.
3147.40s: There's not a lot of delta that's sitting out at dangerous levels.
3153.96s: Well, what the fuck happened in the chat?
3156.68s: Yo, I'd rather be skinned. First off, thank you so much for hooking some people up with a nice,
3163.64s: good old fashioned ally trading membership. It helps support the channel. Thank you so much.
3169.40s: And let's take a quick look at
3175.24s: game stop.
3178.44s: And we want to take a look at Gaxe.
3181.08s: Let's see.
3200.28s: So we can see, I mean, most of it's around spot.
3203.40s: And then there's a little bit elevated up here to the long side.
3207.64s: But most of the outstanding Gaxe right now, game exposure is actually negative on Gama,
3214.28s: which is actually kind of good. But yeah.
3227.40s: I'm seeing if Chatchu BT has any other ideas about this colon thing.
3237.64s: Yeah.
3247.64s: Nothing. Okay.
3251.64s: Mark says, Reg show 13 F2 just came into play last month. Time will tell if anyone complies.
3257.24s: But it does know non reporting issuers without specifying who they are.
3263.32s: Well, let's explore that a little bit more. So let's take a look at
3268.44s: I'm going to have Chatchu BT talk to me about it.
3272.20s: Teach me about Reg show 13 F dash two.
3280.60s: Let's see what it says. I went back into the 01.
3293.48s: Okay.
3297.48s: So let's see.
3301.80s: They.
3305.64s: The new 13 F2 would effectively introduce a parallel reporting framework for short positions.
3312.28s: Okay.
3315.16s: So there's been no equivalent for short position disclosure. Now there is monthly
3320.68s: disclosures to SEC institutional managers meeting certain thresholds would report short
3326.36s: positions and certain short selling activity monthly on a new form. The position level data
3334.12s: would be submitted confidentially to the SEC not immediately disclosed to the public at the
3339.00s: manager level aggregate public disclosure after a time delay that SEC would publish aggregated
3346.52s: short sale data by issuer. But without revealing the identity of each manager specific position
3353.72s: that's good. They should do that.
3356.20s: Fresh holds the proposal included specific thresholds to determine which managers have to file.
3362.12s: Typically it targets managers ready subject to 13 F reporting so 100 million plus and 13 F securities.
3370.84s: Okay.
3372.28s: So now let's see what happens if they don't do it.
3385.72s: What are the penalties
3391.40s: if the entity doesn't comply and disclose?
3397.48s: Let's see.
3407.16s: Civil enforcement actions is probably just fucking fines man.
3417.40s: Yeah, it looks like the main thing is they're talking about the fines.
3424.20s: And
3427.16s: Russ says and who are the non reporting entities it looks like non reporting and well let me ask.
3437.08s: What would be considered the non reporting entity? My expectation is what we talked about funds
3444.92s: that aren't over that threshold of 100 mil.
3452.28s: Non so private companies.
3455.32s: So a company that has not registered investment managers below the thresholds.
3460.84s: Entities not subject to exchange act regulation or SEC requirements so they wouldn't comply with
3466.28s: anything else. So this Russ and Mark it looks like the non issuing and to or the non reporting
3477.16s: entities would be what we would think meaning the people that don't meet the disclosure
3481.48s: requirement thresholds which I mean to me that makes sense to denote them as non reporting entities.
3492.92s: That's what it looks like.
3496.28s: Cool. Now that we're literally an hour in we have like 15 minutes left.
3502.84s: Super fun analysis by the way really really enjoyed that but let's now get into
3510.60s: actually analyzing
3516.52s: the DD I just got to update our timestamps. I've been a naughty
3522.04s: person and really not helped at all sorry about that. We'll call it five minutes.
3535.08s: This was the kickoff.
3543.00s: And then we got into GameStop analysis.
3552.68s: At like eight 20.
3560.92s: And then now we're at 59 30. We're now getting into
3567.88s: DD analysis. And then we're back to Lucy who I did reach out to.
3579.40s: Okay, let's continue.
3582.44s: Russ says as
3589.40s: Gets you PT if they're exempt from well yeah the reason why market makers would be exempt from it
3595.32s: that makes sense is because again the short shares that a market maker would hold
3602.20s: from a theoretical perspective is not to take a directional bet on the stock. If we think of
3609.80s: the entities that are trying to push price down it's typically institutions that then are in
3615.16s: collusion with other supporting entities but it's external entities because as always market
3622.76s: makers are going to be slaved to order flow. What order flow is they have to make markets.
3629.40s: So the short positions conceivably that they maintain then therefore would be not out of a
3635.64s: directional bias but out of managing inventory. So yeah I actually don't think that there's a big
3644.68s: issue with them doing that. I think the big issue with market makers is the the game that they play
3650.12s: with kicking the can around that I think is bullshit but that's because they're trying to avoid
3654.84s: going out and actually buying shares when shares were scarce. I'm not so certain that that's
3660.36s: is big of a deal as much now anyways thankfully.
3666.28s: All right. So we were going through this AMA with Lucy we had done a bunch of work and then we came
3677.72s: across. We came across a lot of research but specifically that documentary was really cool.
3686.76s: I enjoyed looking at that quite a lot that's another one that I 100% would love
3691.96s: to continue poking through with you all at some point but that part aside let's finish getting
3699.96s: through Lucy's stuff here. I'm going to get our dinner order out of here so that we can stuff
3711.16s: our faces. Gab says what if their hedge fund has a directional bias? Well that's
3721.16s: starts to open the pure conflict of interest but even if their hedge fund has a directional bias
3727.08s: they still are they still are slave to order flow. They can't stop taking order flow
3732.52s: because they actually have a requirement to keep their quote machines on otherwise they start
3738.68s: to lose different classification and designations. So there is to be clear a massive conflict
3745.64s: of interest. I'm not an advocate at all of Citadel having a hedge fund arm and market making arm
3753.08s: like I think that that's incestuous. However that being said it's not like the Citadel market makers
3761.24s: can just again like move the price wherever they want it to be because Citadel as an institution
3767.56s: might have a specific position in GameStop. These still are overall slaved to broader order
3775.80s: flow. There can be interplay there and I bet you I would completely feel confident betting you
3780.76s: that there is and as you all know I'm not here to spread hype or fud or anything. My goal when I do
3787.08s: stuff like this and when I interact with markets is just to look at stuff as objectively as I
3791.00s: humanly can and that's the reality as far as I can see it there. So interplay yes but total
3800.12s: control or something like that I can see it. So let's continue now with where Lucy left off.
3809.96s: So we're talking about um okay so there's a couple more questions let's see.
3824.36s: In whose interest is it to not have a fair and equitable system?
3827.72s: I mean that's a kind of straightforward question right like whoever stands to benefit but
3836.68s: it's in the interest of big broker dealers and hedge funds. Yep okay which makes sense right
3843.32s: because they they absolutely stand to benefit from it. So I don't think that's any sort of
3851.96s: shocking take I think that makes sense mostly given a pass by SEC and other exchanges.
3858.36s: Sometimes they get a slap on the wrist which we've seen slap on the wrist is very common and
3861.96s: the slap on the wrist is a joke it is like these really really trivial
3867.72s: finds that are a complete joke relative to the size of the companies. Yep here you go.
3874.44s: Okay so what's the next question? Just speaking out on topics that involve high profile corruption
3884.04s: ever make you fearful I honestly don't really care about that one.
3891.64s: Oh what's this one? Any data or disclosures you've been keeping an eye on
3897.08s: so this person runs a data site always curious to hear information others find interesting. Okay
3916.76s: so she's just talking about where she gets her information. Jesus that's a hilarious name.
3921.72s: Yeah so I'm not going to pronounce the name but this person has said what are the best tools to
3928.84s: determine how many shares there are in circulation that's really this is a great question.
3935.96s: It seems that most people fin run those DTCC they clear shares except they don't clear what goes
3941.56s: off clearing which is through the dark pools off clearing means not through regular clearing house
3946.92s: and where a lot of the dirty stuff goes on DTCC subsidiary is the vault that actually holds all
3955.72s: the shares and stocks people do not have their own shares. Yep yep yep yep the NSCC do the actual
3962.76s: clearing. Nobody no private person would really know it unless you get all the big prime brokers
3970.60s: and all the others to do to tell everybody that the shares that they are moving but I don't think they're
3975.16s: okay. Reading your article back in March star struck.
3985.88s: Jesus Christ especially naked shorting would be effectively prevented do you think that's accurate
3993.08s: so they're just talking about the European markets and they're saying that they don't know.
3998.60s: The problem the problem with trying to draw the comparison we do this in the states with a lot
4003.56s: of stuff and rightfully so it's okay to make comparisons but the context of the comparisons are
4008.04s: really important so trying to make a comparison between like the US stock market against any European
4015.16s: market or even South Korea it's you can compare them but we need to maintain the context these are
4022.28s: tiny tiny markets so the entire operation of the markets on a relative basis is just it's completely
4029.08s: different it's not even close it's completely different.
4035.40s: Thrill do you mention South Korea because it's interesting your group of retail they've referred
4040.84s: to themselves as ants okay. Okay. Have you ever been threatened don't care I don't really care
4052.44s: about that. What's your message to the naked short sellers well to the community keep doing what
4061.64s: you're doing. Looks like Lucy's doing a book.
4072.84s: Okay.
4073.32s: All right if Reddit goes down pivotal moment they're talking about where to find people.
4084.44s: Yo first of all fucking shout out to you all we literally just got through over 800 pages of
4096.76s: due diligence so we just completed the diamond handbook which is literally over 800 pages.
4112.12s: Now this is not obviously the end of the road for us because now we have the next
4119.64s: the next series of stuff we need to start looking through which I will grab a where is it at.
4126.92s: This.
4132.04s: And we were going through this in order of date so we had left off we'd gotten through all these this
4139.32s: is where we got to that's hilarious so of this whole list of things we are we're here because
4147.24s: little do we know one of the things is 800 plus pages here so next up will be this and down
4158.28s: down the page will go we're literally we're literally going to go through all of it starting
4162.52s: from the beginning but very very cool so far we got to go through like the the comic style versions
4168.68s: which I enjoyed there's a lot the diamond handbook was really informative to me there are a lot of
4174.44s: components to the diamond handbook that I have to say felt not ultimate not super well-founded
4184.20s: and that's not to besmirch what's in there because we have to postulate things in order
4192.76s: to conceptualize what an answer might be but of the things that did have rock solid citations
4204.12s: I mean the re there's really really good research in there maybe we could do a video down the
4210.84s: line of like the best research out of the diamond handbook because there were a couple in there
4215.40s: I still have notes on them that really stuck out to me and I learned like an exceptional
4222.12s: amount from so I'm really stoked actually to continue going through the rest of these I'm going
4229.00s: to click this next one just because I honestly can't help myself so this one's now
4233.08s: 60 pages over these
4251.32s: who is who's this guy that they decided to start memeing the shit out of
4257.48s: oh
4262.44s: this is absurd oh my oh
4273.72s: what the fuck
4276.28s: you
4284.28s: the ripe dude this is fucking hilarious
4290.44s: this
4298.52s: all right I really enjoyed that big fan of mr. furno collection shout out to mr. furno
4307.08s: make sure you guys go check out some of mr. furno's work um we have to figure out how to like
4314.12s: effectively figure out where we left off bigger short so what is this it'll be on three
4324.12s: five leave off
4331.32s: is third column
4336.60s: fifth no third row
4344.92s: fifth column
4347.00s: we got our coordinates for the next one
4349.72s: anything else that you guys want to hit talk about before we wrap up i'm not in a big rush
4353.56s: I have a couple minutes if there's anything that you want to want to dive into
4357.64s: if you guys are curious about the positions that i'm managing and how i'm doing that that's a big
4362.20s: thing that i'm trying to make sure i'm sharing with you all my goal is literally to try to teach
4366.68s: other people how to do some of this because i think something like the covered strangle is really
4372.60s: probably one of the best possible ways for a lot of game stop holders to trade game stop and to
4378.68s: trade around their holding positions that's the broader idea behind that
4383.64s: rest is tse was on your radar citadel really opening their own exchange with blackrock
4391.64s: for me now i mean that's that's nothing that's like
4395.08s: significantly
4397.40s: follow worthy for me now the ttsy fly for those that is significant for me when i was in
4405.24s: africa you had to be real careful about this bastard
4410.68s: because they have this disease that they carry that makes you all fucked up if they if they bite you
4420.60s: i forgot the there's like a specific name for the here you go
4427.72s: high panosamyasis the sleeping sickness yeah so when i was when i was in africa it was all
4436.20s: eyes for the fucking ttsy fly anytime something flu new you through flu new year you immediately like
4443.00s: no ttsy fly stay away from me we don't want none of that so rust tse not so much on my radar the ttsy
4452.44s: fly heavily on my radar i'm trying not to get bit by one of those bastards if i can get through
4457.88s: my whole life without getting nailed by a ttsy fly that will be a massive win for me so hope that answers
4469.48s: rest says texas stock exchange coming soon yeah i think that overall that'll be good to be honest
4475.64s: i like the idea and i think continued i really do think continued competitiveness is just good the more
4487.56s: competition we can get in the broader sphere the better off we are without a doubt i definitely think that
4495.64s: um well while i'm here i'm gonna just see if there's anything else i need to do with that
4513.40s: so 78
4516.52s: here's another thing i wanted to run by you all actually while we're here while we're
4526.28s: just bullshitting a little bit i have a slight proposition
4533.72s: the proposition that i have is trying to trading 25k for this is honestly pretty annoying and i
4547.96s: would rather trade more but the original idea was to trade this in a way that is as representative
4556.84s: as possible for like the normal person so the question is is 25 still okay i already have a slightly
4571.88s: well not a slightly quite a bit larger of an allocation that i trade in the broader portfolio
4579.08s: like the coverage strangles that i share with you guys are just a subset essentially of what i
4584.44s: trade in the in the broader portfolio with some differences because of that right like this is
4590.28s: naturally a smaller a smaller position so it means i can't trade as many contracts so that'll have
4597.80s: different impacts on the total performance of the position but i'm trying to get a sense from
4605.56s: everybody specifically those that hold game stop like i imagine the most of you just hold your shares
4616.76s: is that correct and for those that hold your shares what stops you from trading options around the
4628.20s: shares specifically
4636.20s: i'd rather be skiing says holder yes so it looks overall so far at least like holders
4648.36s: he says i'm not sure if this audience is the standard as far as what what would you describe that as
4655.64s: agro cragg says freagleek to tariffs cause gme downward bone count that's actually a really great
4665.00s: question tbh i think that tariffs are likely to push the whole market down so i'm still short futures
4673.32s: against the broader long delta that i have because the near term expectation is downside play
4681.88s: probably that's my guess and it's because there's going to be some short term there's going to
4688.36s: be some short term pain i think that will come from this be honest so yeah brick and the wall says
4696.84s: can't roller strangle in a Roth you can you absolutely can you just have to modify it a little bit
4702.20s: so i trade in an IRA i actually just finished my backdoor contribution for the year so definitely
4713.24s: definitely trade in there but you can
4718.28s: as he said the standard gme holders probably not watching youtube options traders i'd imagine i see
4724.04s: okay so that's actually a good point so for most people because i imagine most people that watch
4732.68s: the stream and are part of my community you guys are kind of like a gme hybrid where you have some
4740.84s: level of interest in options but still the crossover with game stop i presume this is actually i'm
4750.20s: actually genuinely curious
4755.72s: so i'm starting a poll
4771.56s: so
4782.84s: the poll is live i'm just curious from the perspective of the people that are on here like who is not
4791.24s: interested in options at all
4795.72s: steve says i came here to learn more about options because i was holding for a long time not
4799.48s: doing anything with them uh-huh so then steve you're like the perfect the perfect candidate
4805.96s: so then steve from the perspective of like your your longer term holdings
4813.40s: are you have you been following along with like the coverage strangle that i'm sharing on
4821.56s: game stop actually i think you by the way steve for the answers because you're literally like the
4828.12s: exact person that i'm trying to help with
4839.72s: we'll start josez i'm just here because only fans is down that is a bummer so we'll we'll help you
4846.20s: out Joe that's the best i got for you um it's a little cold so we can do we can do
4857.72s: topless but it is a little chilly i'm not going to lie about is there you go
4865.88s: Joe you're welcome this is for your viewing pleasure um tips tips are welcome
4875.64s: josez shirtless eric is back that's right dog we've been we've been clothed for far too long they
4884.28s: try to keep us down anyways where's the video that i was looking for here a key so that's the video
4893.16s: that talks about the coverage strangle and game stopper at least introduces it for you so let me see
4899.72s: where Joe first steve so steve back to you i'm specifically curious about your understanding with
4911.56s: um something like the coverage strangle like do you do you kind of get like the the base concepts of
4919.08s: what it is and how it can be used the reason is because i think game stop is probably one of the
4933.16s: ideal candidates for somebody like you literally somebody like you specifically
4942.84s: uh steve says i wanted to see your perspective on shading options with game stop because
4946.68s: doing it wanted to make sure i was on the right track let's talk about that for a second because
4949.96s: there's a handful of ways actually that i see uh let's go here
4963.64s: there's literally only a few ways i see is logical of trading options with game stop
4972.36s: so scenario one is um trading option or really just buy it home
4983.32s: scenario two why is this laggy is i would argue ratio covered calls so this means we have at least
4998.20s: one-on-one shares and then we sell calls against those shares but we always maintain upside
5008.36s: side scenario three would be wheel which equals cash secured puts
5021.48s: until assigned then it's long equity plus covered calls i don't like this one
5030.68s: next scenario is covered strangle which equals long equity ratio covered calls
5048.44s: and cash secured puts then scenario five
5054.12s: would be long options this includes both calls and puts
5070.28s: and i guess you could argue you could do a scenario six and scenario six would just be short puts
5088.44s: it's either naked or cash secured
5099.24s: now the other way that you can trade this scenario seven would be
5110.04s: long straddle slash strangle
5118.44s: that's to play the expansion of volatility so that's just kind of like a rough rundown literally
5125.64s: off the top of my head of the different ways to play game stop with options one twenty three
5135.32s: one twenty five thirty twenty five thirty
5140.68s: there are other ways to do it but these are the only ones that i think make any sense
5154.36s: and to clarify the ways that you'll typically see me trade it
5159.88s: I have this element the reason why this element exists is because of an agreement that i made also
5174.28s: Joe brings up a really great scenario thank you i actually didn't think of this one but scenario eight
5181.40s: would be a ratio all diagonal which i still would not trade personally but this is a scenario
5195.32s: so and i'll explain why so by and hold that's part of the broader portfolio i really don't do just
5204.44s: this but this would be the next stair step for anybody that is doing this this is like the next
5210.28s: natural path then i don't do this one i don't do this one i do this one i do this one i do this one
5223.64s: and i do this one the reason why i don't do these
5232.04s: this one is because they're essentially part of this scenario four
5237.64s: the reason why i don't do ratio call diagonals is because this has short calls and then it has
5246.84s: long options but there's no current shares so this becomes really really dangerous and the reason
5256.84s: why this is dangerous is because short calls can be assigned early so if you're assigned during a squeeze
5267.40s: that becomes a little bit of a logistical burden if you're covering it with long options
5274.92s: L. George says i got an email saying i have a month trial from you month trial for what and who's
5280.36s: the fucking email from i don't have month trials for anything you you sure it's from who's the email
5289.32s: from because it's not from me i don't have that youtube sent it to you oh because somebody gave you
5300.20s: a membership earlier you must have been you can think i'd rather be skiing because was it i'd
5306.68s: rather be skiing want to make sure i give props to the right person yeah i'd rather be skiing
5313.80s: so you can say thank you to i'd rather be skiing because they hooked you up with youtube
5319.56s: so really all that is it's a it's a way to support the channel like there's not like a bunch of
5325.96s: perks for being a youtube member the main thing is i make sure i prioritize your questions right
5330.52s: because i can clearly see who you guys are but in general i try to answer most people's questions
5337.40s: so the main thing is it's a way to support the channel um that's the main thing and for like the
5343.88s: the more specific stuff that's like the patreon but that's really more for like more serious
5349.64s: option traders for people that are interested in buy and hold learning about game stop and you know
5355.24s: more casually involved with game stop the the patreon wouldn't be for you at all but if you're
5359.80s: interested in like trading options that's where um the more serious effort goes so yeah
5367.72s: that's that's what we got so
5377.48s: i'm trying to think if there's anything else here so yeah there's pretty significant risk with
5382.28s: this one that i think can be avoided by traders there's this really is designed to trade the
5390.68s: expansion and volatility which happens actually quite a lot i normally trade these at a ratio meaning
5396.28s: long long calls to short uh long calls to long puts um
5405.96s: we'll stretch those is nine nine percent in poll not here because they're interested in options
5410.68s: what they're watching for for game stop this is the game stop stream so that's what they're watching for
5419.16s: hey yo Lauren's hooking everybody up too thank you so much Lauren
5424.12s: much appreciated
5429.96s: uh i'd rather be skiing says i need to get more in a scenario for it yeah so for scenario four
5435.32s: i think again from from my perspective i think that's one of the better places for game stop
5441.56s: traders to be and here's here's what you need this this these are like the first two videos
5457.00s: that are in the series and then if you look at the game stop playlist i literally have an entire
5463.16s: playlist for game stop and meme stocks here that playlist goes through like the the Tuesday the
5473.16s: Tuesday update videos that i'm doing you can see that in that playlist and this should be sorted
5480.84s: by release yeah which is perfect
5486.36s: so yeah you'll be able to to check that out there but i'm essentially showing
5495.16s: everybody like what i'm doing with the game stop holding and then how i'm trading along it
5501.40s: because the idea is to give everybody like literally a step by step overview of it
5508.60s: so sweet all right gang that wraps me up we have the pro market prep live stream tomorrow you also
5516.28s: have a video every sunday you will get in every ever green video from Eric that means it's more
5521.88s: fundamental concepts the video tomorrow is about trader documentation so it's about how to build a
5528.20s: trading plan and a trading log specifically a trading log and it's a step by step process i literally
5535.00s: do it on the stream with you so you can follow along with that to help build your own trading log so
5542.36s: you can make better decisions as always if you need anything hit me up drop me an email whatever
5548.68s: works for you works for me be an outlier be an ape you would ever want to be see you later
