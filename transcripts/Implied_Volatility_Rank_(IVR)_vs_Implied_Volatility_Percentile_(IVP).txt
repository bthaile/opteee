0.72s: what's up to all the outliers eric here
2.72s: i got a video for you on using implied
5.36s: volatility in your options trading and
8.40s: then i also have a couple interesting
10.56s: uses that you might not know of
13.04s: for implied volatility so let's dive
16.08s: straight over and get into it now the
17.60s: very first thing is you have to promise
19.68s: me when i start flashing this first
21.84s: piece up that you're not immediately
23.20s: going to run away because it does
24.32s: include a formula but you have to trust
26.64s: me um we'll get through it i'm not going
28.72s: to spend a bunch of time on the formula
30.32s: i just want to talk about implied
32.72s: volatility implied volatility percentile
36.08s: and implied volatility rank because
38.80s: traders use all of them interchangeably
42.16s: and they're all different so it's
44.32s: important to understand the difference
46.08s: between them because in my opinion one
49.04s: of them is far more useful than the
52.00s: other two so first let's start with the
55.04s: heavier one again don't let the formula
58.72s: scare you stand your ground
61.20s: there it is it's actually not that bad
63.52s: so if you're familiar with the black
64.96s: scholes model that's what you're seeing
66.80s: here we're looking at how you calculate
69.68s: implied volatility for calls and puts
71.92s: again i'm not going to go too far into
73.68s: detail here i'm just throwing it in
75.28s: there for the people that are interested
76.80s: in it now that part aside
79.84s: let's take a look at what implied
81.92s: volatility is
83.44s: in short it simply is a forward-looking
87.52s: projection so it is when the market
90.56s: attempts to forecast the future we want
93.92s: to know how much variance we expect to
97.44s: see in the price of an underlying that's
100.24s: all implied volatility is implied
102.96s: meaning forward looking it's a
105.04s: projection which is different than
107.28s: historical volatility which is as you
110.24s: guessed
111.28s: previous in nature it is what actually
113.76s: happened so when we're trading options
117.28s: we really care about implied volatility
120.00s: now there is an argument to be made and
122.00s: one of my favorite strategies actually
124.48s: is to track the historic variation
128.24s: between implied volatility and historic
130.32s: volatility to see how over understated
133.68s: it is that's actually a very useful
135.60s: metric but that part aside for options
138.88s: trading implied volatility is really the
141.28s: main show in town otherwise historic
144.72s: volatility really applies more to the
146.88s: underlying itself the stock
149.60s: not so much for options okay so now that
152.96s: we know what implied volatility is
155.20s: why do we care about implied volatility
158.32s: percentile or implied volatility rank
162.00s: well
162.80s: as a raw number
165.12s: implied volatility can be very
166.96s: misleading and i will show you an
169.28s: example right now
171.76s: let's take a look at hut which is hut 8
174.32s: mining corp and a stock that is
176.96s: absolutely giving me the hardest time
179.84s: but anyways the implied volatility in
182.00s: here is 409
185.28s: percent
186.84s: 490.17 percent
188.88s: is that high or is that low
192.72s: it might seem high because it's a high
194.64s: number but
196.16s: is this actually high for hut
199.84s: if we look at implied volatility by
202.00s: itself it's very difficult to answer
204.80s: that question
206.08s: let's switch over to apple
208.08s: apple's implied volatility is
210.84s: 46.08
212.72s: again i asked the same question is that
214.88s: high
215.76s: or is that low
217.28s: relative for apple when we're looking at
219.92s: apple at that point in time
222.08s: do we know if premiums are juiced up
224.88s: because implied volatility is high or
226.96s: because implied volatility is low
229.20s: you can't really tell with implied
230.72s: volatility that's exactly what i'm kind
232.64s: of explaining here when we look at
234.72s: implied volatility as a raw figure it's
236.64s: not that useful because it doesn't
238.72s: really give you any context you can have
241.44s: a stock like hut that maintains implied
245.12s: volatility that's in the hundreds
247.52s: over periods of time it's very normal
249.36s: for hud whereas apple is a little bit
251.52s: different so we use things like implied
254.48s: volatility percentile and implied
256.24s: volatility rank to give us context now
259.44s: what's the difference between the two
260.96s: and which one is better most importantly
263.68s: the difference is in the way that
265.12s: they're calculated which one is better
267.36s: in my opinion is very simple it is
269.52s: implied volatility percentile hands down
271.84s: let's find out why
273.36s: implied volatility percentile simply
275.36s: takes the number of trading days below
278.80s: the current iv
281.12s: and it divides it by 252. so it gives
284.08s: you a scale of how many days were below
287.12s: the current implied volatility over a
289.36s: year essentially
290.88s: when we look at implied volatility rank
293.36s: it is the current implied volatility
295.76s: minus the 52-week iv low divided by the
300.56s: 52-week iv high minus the 52-week iv low
305.28s: what are you seeing in the difference
307.68s: between these two formulas and i give
310.00s: you a pretty big hint here
311.84s: it is this right here
315.44s: iv rank exposes you to extreme outlier
319.52s: skew now this isn't that prevalent when
322.72s: the markets are relatively stable or
325.20s: going through a correction like we are
327.04s: right now today is the 11th of may
329.68s: now during the covid drop
332.32s: after we experienced the covet drop and
334.64s: we had implied volatility run to
337.04s: essentially levels that it a lot of
339.76s: stocks hadn't seen in literally a decade
342.48s: plus
343.92s: that movement skewed iv rank for an
348.16s: extended period of time because that
351.80s: 52-week iv high
354.72s: hung out there until 52 weeks rolled by
357.92s: and that data was completely cleared out
360.72s: of the calculation
362.24s: so implied volatility rank is definitely
365.12s: more susceptible to skew
367.28s: implied volatility percentile much less
370.08s: prone to experiencing that same skew so
373.76s: now i hope we have a general
375.28s: understanding of implied volatility
377.44s: implied all in implied volatility
379.60s: percentile tough one there and then
382.00s: implied volatility rank now let's talk
384.48s: about some of the uses for implied
387.20s: volatility which i will refer to again
389.12s: just like as every other trader is
391.20s: whichever one we're looking at
393.04s: so we can use implied volatility to
396.16s: gauge sentiment as well and most
398.40s: importantly in my opinion
400.24s: for strategy selection let's look at an
402.48s: example gauge sentiment now if knowing
406.24s: what we know now we come over here and
408.08s: we say okay the implied volatility
410.40s: percentile in apple is 46
413.12s: the implied volatility percentile which
415.28s: this is wrong this is implied volatility
418.16s: rank think or swim flags this wrong very
420.80s: frustrating but it's saying that implied
422.80s: volatility current implied volatility
425.12s: rank is 77
427.04s: if we want to know the implied
428.40s: volatility percentile what that actually
430.80s: is
431.52s: i use the think script so that i can see
433.84s: it and you can see the delta between the
435.60s: two even now implied volatility rank 77
439.20s: implied volatility percentile 98
442.24s: very different so anyways
444.88s: now we look at
446.56s: apple
447.52s: and we can gain some pretty helpful
450.08s: information if we're looking at strategy
453.04s: selection we can immediately use things
455.92s: like implied volatility percentile
458.08s: actual implied volatility percentile
459.76s: that's my preference ivp we can use that
463.20s: to inform how we want to play something
465.84s: for example
467.04s: if i wanted to play apple to the upside
469.92s: here i'm bullish
471.92s: i can let's pick two trades i can either
474.00s: buy a call or i can sell a put
476.24s: how do i decide between the two other
479.04s: than the structural differences between
480.80s: the trade
481.92s: the main difference differentiator for
484.16s: me is actually implied volatility
486.88s: percentile because
489.52s: if we buy a call and implied volatility
494.40s: contracts
495.92s: that hurts the call it means that we
498.80s: need to be even more directionally
500.96s: correct in order to make money implied
503.20s: volatility directly impacts the premium
505.44s: of options as implied volatility
507.68s: increases premiums increase as implied
510.40s: volatility decreases premiums decrease
513.92s: so with that known if i see something
517.04s: like this where i'm bullish in apple and
519.92s: i see implied volatility percentile is
521.76s: 98
522.80s: i am going to drift to short premium
525.76s: strategies that's not to say that
528.72s: implied volatility cannot remain
530.88s: elevated or even increase higher it most
534.56s: certainly can but it's less likely to do
538.16s: that so the higher we see implied
540.48s: volatility percentile the more i tend to
543.04s: drift to short premium strategies for
545.52s: that exact reason now the other thing to
547.60s: keep in mind here is
549.68s: implied volatility generally speaking is
552.40s: one of the more
553.84s: mean reverting aspects of the market so
557.20s: it's just a higher statistical
559.28s: probability that we will see this revert
562.08s: down to a mean
563.68s: so because of that when i see implied
565.44s: volatility percentile at extremes either
568.08s: to the low or high side i use that to
571.44s: make inferences about the strategy i'm
574.00s: going to select if this said implied
576.64s: volatility percentile was zero
579.44s: that would tell me it is more likely
581.52s: that implied volatility percentile or
584.08s: implied volatility as a raw figure is
585.84s: going to expand in the future so because
589.36s: of that i would lean towards a long
592.00s: premium strategy to take advantage of
594.72s: that implied volatility expansion it's a
596.88s: way for us to kind of stack
599.12s: probabilities in our favor beyond just a
601.52s: directional assumption
603.36s: so i always lace in
606.16s: implied volatility in my strategy
608.00s: selection i typically will pick
610.00s: direction first because direction will
612.80s: absolutely overwhelm implied volatility
616.16s: changes but if we can get them both to
618.16s: work together it's very useful now the
620.96s: last thing i want to show you is using
623.20s: implied volatility as a gauge for
625.76s: sentiment two ways we can do that the
628.08s: first way if we see implied volatility
630.72s: in this sense is very high
633.28s: it means that the market is pricing in a
636.24s: lot of volatility to the premium of the
639.04s: options so what we're understanding is
641.20s: that there is whip expected we are
644.00s: expecting larger price variants
647.84s: so when we see implied volatility is
649.68s: high the very first thing we should
651.68s: think is premiums are high the second
653.92s: thing we should think is prices are
656.40s: going to move in a wider range as
660.16s: implied volatility increases
662.40s: now the other way we can use it to gauge
664.48s: sentiment is a really useful tool over
666.88s: here on the right hand side in
668.16s: thinkorswim you can see all of these
670.32s: percentages
672.16s: this is telling you the implied
673.76s: volatility for that month
677.20s: and the other thing that you'll know is
678.72s: this plus and minus this is actually
680.48s: doing some of the work for you and it's
682.48s: telling you the expected range based on
685.36s: that implied volatility for the month
687.52s: now if we scroll down through here
690.72s: you'll notice a couple things typically
692.72s: as we start to go further out in time
694.88s: implied volatility starts to decrease so
698.16s: we see 60 up front 50 percent 48 45 44
704.32s: 45 41
707.04s: 48.71
709.28s: what's going on here
711.12s: why would we be generally declining but
713.44s: then all of a sudden rise up about seven
715.44s: points
716.48s: well you can start to glean a lot of
719.60s: information from this as in there's
721.92s: probably earnings being priced into this
724.48s: cycle so if you want to trade apple and
727.68s: you don't want to be exposed to earnings
730.24s: there is very likely an earnings event
732.32s: around this month it's not announced yet
734.72s: but if we think about it logically it
736.80s: makes total sense because earnings was
738.72s: just announced the end of april so if we
742.48s: start to think about where earnings is
744.88s: likely to be next quarter three months
747.44s: out that puts us right around this
749.84s: ballpark and as we get more expirations
753.60s: around this time frame because there's
755.60s: only so many expiration cycles offered
758.00s: so as we get closer to this you'll see
760.88s: whichever week
762.72s: earnings will be reported in will have
764.72s: higher volatility than the other
766.00s: surrounding weeks so we can use implied
768.80s: volatility to do a ton of different
771.52s: things as well as figure out when
773.52s: earnings is probably going to be so if
