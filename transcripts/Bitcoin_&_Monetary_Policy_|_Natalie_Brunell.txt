2.40s: hey everybody eric here and i am really
4.72s: stoked for today's guest so we have
7.12s: natalie here
8.56s: and i came across her like quite a few
11.28s: people on twitter except
14.00s: um she has a lot of really awesome
16.72s: bitcoin and cryptocurrency kind of uh
19.12s: content so i'm really excited to have
20.88s: you here thanks for joining yeah thanks
22.80s: so much for having me looking forward to
24.16s: it awesome so
25.92s: first off i think it's always really
27.20s: helpful just to level set obviously it's
29.12s: your first time with us on the channel
30.64s: so um i thought it would be really cool
32.56s: just to explore your background very
34.32s: quickly so people understand your
35.68s: perspective your paradigm so really two
37.60s: main questions the first question is um
40.08s: obviously you are very focused on
42.56s: bitcoin cryptocurrency space uh so the
44.64s: first question is what got you
46.80s: interested in that space
49.44s: sure so a little bit about my background
51.76s: i'm a first generation immigrant my
53.44s: family came to the us uh when i was very
55.68s: little from poland and my family wanted
58.16s: to another pollock sorry yeah are you
60.96s: polish yes
62.24s: ski is my last name so
64.16s: awesome yeah so um i was born there and
66.88s: came when i was very little we
68.24s: immigrated to chicago where uh pretty
70.24s: much every polish person moves when they
72.00s: come to the us
73.44s: and my parents came in search of the
75.84s: american dream they grew up under
77.44s: communism so they are really passionate
79.84s: about a sense of freedom especially
81.68s: economic freedom and the ability to move
83.68s: upwards uh social mobility
86.56s: and so they thought that america would
88.40s: have a lot more opportunity and provide
90.96s: myself and my brother with a better
92.96s: education system and just you know more
95.92s: chances to kind of
98.00s: improve our lot in life and be able to
100.08s: accomplish what we want to accomplish
101.76s: and and become financially secure so
104.56s: that was always drilled in my head right
106.48s: like it was just this idea that you
108.88s: should work hard you should get an
110.16s: education and and you can make it like
112.48s: america is the place where you have the
114.80s: chance to become whatever you want to
116.08s: become and you can earn money and take
118.16s: care of your family um and they didn't
120.16s: want something extreme they didn't want
121.84s: to become you know jeff bezos with a
123.52s: yacht they just wanted like that
125.12s: middle-class life of a nice house and a
128.08s: safe suburb but you know a vacation
129.84s: every year and their kids to go to to go
131.60s: to good school so um i saw them work
134.24s: really really hard when when we came
136.16s: here and
137.44s: they worked so hard that we were able to
138.88s: finally afford a house and then the
141.36s: financial crisis happened in
143.60s: 2008 2009 and they lost everything uh
146.56s: and i had i watched them start over
148.56s: again and um so
150.64s: i think back then there was like
152.00s: something instilled in my head of like
154.24s: how did this happen you know they were
156.08s: two good working good good hard-working
158.56s: people who paid their taxes played by
160.24s: the rules and they got completely
162.00s: screwed by a system that they didn't
163.28s: even fully understand and i always
165.68s: wondered like why you know why didn't we
167.68s: see that coming why did this even happen
169.52s: how could the greatest you know the
171.28s: economy and the greatest country in the
172.80s: world suddenly have
174.32s: um you know its economy on the brink of
176.72s: collapse its banking system on the brink
178.64s: of collapse and needing bailout from the
180.16s: taxpayers and i that was just sort of
182.80s: you know ruminating in the back of my
184.24s: mind and i decided to pursue a career in
186.40s: journalism because i've always loved
187.76s: storytelling and learning and
189.36s: interviewing people i love conversations
192.08s: and so i set off right around that same
194.72s: time around the financial crisis i got
196.80s: my first job and i started working in
198.88s: this news industry which was changing in
201.20s: real time because of technology and
202.96s: allowing people to you know become their
204.96s: own personalities from home and have
206.72s: youtube channels and all the things that
208.96s: um
209.92s: didn't exist when i was growing up sort
211.68s: of dreaming of becoming a journalist and
213.84s: so what that taught me is um you know i
216.32s: spent 10 years as a reporter
219.44s: looking at the crises that are facing
221.68s: this country at a really really deep
223.68s: micro level of human experience you know
225.68s: interviewing people that are facing
227.28s: poverty homelessness the politicians who
229.52s: claim to have the answer elections uh
231.76s: public corruption all of it
233.76s: and what i ended up realizing is that
235.76s: our system is really broken and we're
238.32s: spending more and more money and the
240.40s: problems are only getting bigger and
241.92s: everyone blames someone else and really
244.16s: for the average person life is getting
245.84s: more and more expensive to afford
247.36s: everything from housing to education
249.76s: and it made me kind of frustrated
252.96s: because i didn't understand what the
254.64s: solution was and i started to feel as i
256.80s: as i progressed in my career
258.80s: that really nothing changes it um
261.12s: and then i learned about bitcoin and it
263.04s: was 2017 i was in one of the news
265.44s: markets that i worked in and i had
267.28s: friends of friends who worked at
268.56s: coinbase and they were kind of investing
270.72s: in crypto and i was like what is bitcoin
273.20s: and just like most people i was super
274.88s: skeptical i thought it was a scam i
277.36s: thought it was you know some internet
278.72s: funny money uh i didn't believe in it i
281.12s: didn't understand it but i was curious
283.52s: and i i ultimately knew that there was a
285.84s: problem and supposedly this was a
288.80s: technology that might fix some of the
290.48s: problems we have so
292.00s: i started to dig into it candidly i did
294.48s: not do most of my research until the
296.08s: pandemic and uh and our market crashed
298.96s: and they initiated like the
300.96s: bazookas of money printing and uh and i
304.16s: knew that life was not going back to
307.04s: the same sort of financial world order
309.20s: that we had before i felt like
311.04s: everything changed with the pandemic and
313.04s: so
313.84s: i started to consume everything i
316.32s: possibly could not just about bitcoin
318.72s: but about our economy in general like
320.24s: the history of the federal reserve and
322.56s: you know i started following gold bugs
324.48s: bitcoin people um people who were
326.64s: talking about you know macroeconomics
328.48s: and what happened in the financial
330.00s: crisis and what happened in 1971 with
332.24s: the gold standard and i started to
334.48s: realize that all of the problems that
336.32s: both i experienced with my family coming
338.88s: here and losing everything as well as
340.64s: all the problems that i was really
341.92s: reporting on as a journalist they were
344.24s: all connected
345.60s: to our money and how broken our money
347.84s: system was and that bitcoin is the one
350.48s: thing to me that i think could fix it
352.80s: and could
354.40s: usher us into a new financial order
356.40s: that's more inclusive that's more based
358.16s: on value and and is more equal because
360.96s: it's it's based on actual
363.52s: supply and demand economics which we
365.92s: haven't had for a very long time with
367.68s: the manipulated interest rates and
369.44s: quantitative easing that the the fed
371.20s: takes part in so i know this is a very
372.96s: long-winded answer but basically i came
374.88s: to bitcoin because i knew there was a
376.88s: problem and when i learned about bitcoin
379.04s: i realized that was the solution and i
380.88s: want to empower people to understand it
383.04s: so that they can opt out of the broken
384.80s: system into one that potentially could
387.04s: help them accumulate wealth and take
388.80s: care of their families in the future
391.68s: wow
393.68s: that it's that's kind of incredible one
396.00s: obviously i just think it's freaking
398.16s: awesome that your parents are fellow
399.84s: pollocks like i said i get giddy when i
401.84s: find others um but
404.56s: the the story that you share is is kind
407.44s: of fascinating to me for a few reasons
409.36s: one obviously their timing in just the
412.80s: u.s market was a little rough
415.44s: because 2008 was just brutal and you
417.84s: know obvious you
419.36s: know more about it than i do you know
420.88s: just the way that our fiscal policy was
423.28s: set up at that point
424.64s: obviously just gives so much leeway to
427.20s: these banks and you started you know the
429.60s: the aftermath you're viewing what kind
431.28s: of
432.08s: monetary decisions they're making you're
433.52s: like
434.48s: who like who who thought this was a good
436.56s: idea you know what i mean
438.32s: so it's it's interesting how that moved
441.60s: you towards bitcoin so
443.68s: the very first um kind of follow-on
446.32s: question i have for you is when we're
447.84s: thinking about the current um you know
449.92s: just monetary policy the way that the
452.48s: fed is so involved in our current fiscal
456.08s: policy
457.20s: what do you think bitcoin does
460.24s: in order to kind of fix that problem
463.04s: obviously understanding a little bit of
464.64s: the construction but i'm curious you
466.16s: know just set up at a high level
467.44s: overview what your thoughts are there
469.52s: yeah so put very simply it takes the
472.08s: power of money out of the hands of
474.88s: government and central authority and
476.56s: that's what i think we need right now um
478.80s: i didn't really understand the history
480.24s: of money i never learned it in school i
482.08s: think this is you know it puts a
483.84s: highlight on how little financial
485.44s: literacy we have in this country i i
487.60s: went to good schools i graduated with a
489.76s: master's at one of the top universities
492.00s: and i really never understood the
493.36s: history of money or how the federal
494.80s: reserve came to be and these are
496.64s: fundamental things that affect all of
498.56s: our lives right we use money every
500.08s: single day it is you know our most
502.24s: important information system i would say
505.84s: it allows us to measure value in society
508.32s: for everything that we produce and all
509.92s: the services that we provide and our
512.16s: money is broken and our money doesn't
514.16s: have actual value it's collapsing and
516.64s: purchasing power and we don't even know
518.64s: what the true price of things are when
520.24s: you have a federal reserve that
521.60s: manipulates interest rates and pumps
523.68s: liquidity into markets by basically
526.16s: creating money out of thin air and then
528.08s: that money goes it gets
529.76s: disproportionately allocated to you know
532.40s: the big corporations and they do stock
534.80s: buybacks and they buy up all this real
537.12s: estate and make everyone into renters
538.72s: and it's just it's ballooning the wealth
540.88s: inequality in our country and so
543.04s: it's just what's sad to me is that i
544.88s: didn't realize that the policies that i
546.56s: was learning in school were really
548.48s: backwards um they were basically
550.32s: addressing solutions as opposed to the
552.48s: problems
553.52s: and
554.40s: the symptoms excuse me they were
555.68s: addressing the symptoms as opposed to
557.36s: the actual problem and the problem is
559.36s: they're debasing our currency they're
560.72s: debasing our money they have the
562.48s: prerogative to print as much money as
564.08s: they want and it affects the average
566.24s: person the middle class the the low
568.40s: income earners the savers it affects
570.24s: them so much and that that's what my
572.08s: family represented and it's frustrating
574.00s: to me it makes me angry and so i want
576.24s: people to be empowered with that
577.52s: education of like look we used to have a
580.00s: money that they could not inflate it was
581.76s: gold and then gold got centralized in
584.00s: vaults and they issued more paper notes
585.68s: than the gold that they had and
587.12s: eventually they
588.48s: let that get away so far that that we
590.32s: basically defaulted and had to go off
592.08s: the gold standard and now we're in this
594.40s: fiat world where they can make as much
596.80s: money as they possibly want it goes into
599.20s: the hands of the wealthy before anybody
601.12s: else and we are getting poorer and more
604.32s: polarized as a nation we used to be the
606.32s: world's biggest creditor nation now
608.08s: we're the world's largest debtor nation
609.68s: we don't make anything we don't make
611.04s: anything of value here and that's sad um
614.40s: and so i now see why everyone is you
616.72s: know there's so much angst and it's like
618.16s: red versus blue everyone has a team
620.56s: because everyone's just feeling
622.00s: frustrated by a system that isn't
623.68s: inclusive and isn't fair and no matter
625.60s: how hard you work it's like you're
626.96s: always on this
628.24s: in the rat race or on this gerbil wheel
630.48s: and you can't make enough and you can't
631.76s: retire and you have to start gambling
633.36s: your money and meme stocks right and
635.04s: altcoins so this is the system that
637.76s: bitcoiners want to fix like satoshi
640.00s: nakamoto put into the first you know
643.12s: block
644.08s: the genesis block the the um headline
648.16s: chancellor on brink of second bailouts
650.08s: like this is the exact problem he wanted
652.16s: to fix or she wanted to fix is the idea
654.80s: that central authority has way too much
656.80s: power and control over the supply of
658.80s: money and as soon as they start printing
660.88s: too much money and debasing our currency
663.20s: everybody suffers in the end so um
666.00s: yeah bitcoin fixes that
668.00s: it's interesting so one of the questions
669.92s: i have with regards to that i agree with
672.00s: you
672.72s: really on the vast majority of those
675.12s: issues that you noted now one thing i am
677.92s: curious your perspective on though is so
680.24s: are you of the opinion that
682.56s: really in general
684.32s: the government should not manipulate its
688.08s: financial policy its currencies at all
690.64s: or do you think they should limit their
692.88s: involvement and the reason why i ask
694.40s: that is i do think in certain
696.08s: circumstances
697.52s: government intervention has actually
699.12s: worked for us and has made some
702.08s: circumstances a little less
704.72s: uh i guess impactful um overall i guess
707.20s: to you know depending on how you
708.88s: perceive the impactful comment but i'm
711.84s: just curious like do you think that
713.60s: going from something where the
715.12s: government is so heavily involved
717.28s: because right now i think it's way too
718.32s: much to something where essentially
720.72s: there's no government involvement what
722.32s: do you think about that jump
724.72s: so that's a great question i believe in
726.32s: the rule of law but i believe in that
728.48s: the government should not be intervening
730.32s: in the free markets and in the economy
732.56s: and so this is where again bitcoin is
734.72s: the reason why i learned about these
736.48s: different economic theories before
738.16s: bitcoin i never understood what
740.08s: keynesian economics versus austrian
742.24s: economics were and and and i feel like
744.80s: over even just the last like five to ten
746.64s: years when i think about the stories
747.84s: i've covered or just like um
750.08s: just the the the climate in general when
752.96s: it comes to the word capitalism has
754.64s: really changed like capitalism has
756.00s: turned into a very negative word it's
758.56s: it's associated with greed and with
760.64s: wealth inequality but the truth is if
762.88s: you really study capitalism capital
765.44s: capitalism is about capital accumulation
767.36s: it's about saving and investing and it
769.28s: is the complete polar opposite of what
771.20s: everyone is told
772.48s: to do in this country which is spent
774.40s: that the the health of an economy in
776.80s: this country is based on the level of
778.64s: spending and so keynesians believe that
781.36s: the government should intervene and that
782.96s: the government is responsible for
784.24s: stepping in and basically managing
786.08s: demand they can manage
788.40s: actions of human beings they can manage
790.40s: unemployment they can stimulate the
792.24s: economy they can
793.60s: prevent these booms and bust cycles but
796.56s: arguably we've had decades of keynesian
799.04s: economics and all we've had is booms and
801.60s: busts because the economy can't regulate
803.68s: itself and so that's what really
805.60s: frustrates me is there there's a school
808.40s: of thought out there that's being
809.44s: completely ignored and not being taught
810.96s: in schools which is austrian economics
812.64s: which really focuses on free markets and
814.64s: capitalism and encourages people to save
817.60s: and then invest in something productive
819.52s: and create value for the economy and we
821.76s: push all that aside in favor of taking
824.24s: on debt and consumerism and spending and
827.20s: so i i truly believe like the austrians
829.84s: believe that if we had an economy that
831.52s: was based on free markets and a interest
834.00s: rate that basically set itself based on
835.84s: supply and demand as opposed to a
837.36s: central bank that we would actually have
839.52s: more equilibrium in the economy we would
841.60s: have fewer booms and busts that weren't
843.68s: as extreme because the market would come
845.84s: in and fill those gaps in holes whereas
848.16s: the government i think encourages male
850.32s: investments and misallocation of capital
852.64s: because they ultimately can't decide
854.88s: human action they can't you can't just
856.88s: like
857.92s: spend your way into a healthy economy
860.00s: and we've gotten so into debt using
861.68s: keynesian economics i mean we're
863.04s: basically pushing putting the tab on
865.28s: future generations and look what's
866.80s: happening now a millennial doesn't feel
868.72s: like they can even afford a house that
870.16s: their parents could that is not the way
872.08s: america should function like we're
873.76s: supposed to be you know the paradigm of
875.92s: capitalism and free markets and
877.52s: enterprise and entrepreneurship and now
879.92s: we're leading into what i believe is
882.08s: almost a system of authoritarianism
883.68s: because we have politicians coming in
885.84s: and saying hey this is based on
887.44s: corporate greed i'm gonna we're gonna
889.20s: have universal basic income this is the
891.20s: bad guy i'm the fix we're gonna spend
892.96s: more money we're gonna hand out money
894.56s: that's not the solution the solution is
897.04s: allowing free markets to function in my
899.04s: opinion and i think with hard sound
901.36s: money that can't be manipulated at the
903.60s: base layer of our economy something like
905.68s: bitcoin using technology to harness
907.68s: sound money
908.80s: that is what i think will allow us to
910.64s: have a more equal economy
913.44s: it's interesting so one of the
915.60s: things you noted um and i'm i'm just
918.24s: curious to dive in just a little bit
919.92s: further is you you mentioned something
921.76s: to the order of the market being able to
924.00s: kind of fill some of you know just the
926.56s: holes that we're experiencing
928.48s: um in the current marketplace when
931.20s: you're referring to the market i'm
933.44s: curious who that is to you because one
935.76s: of the i guess as i'm listening and
937.92s: synthesizing what you're saying one of
939.28s: the concerns that i have
941.04s: in that kind of world is
943.24s: institutions really drive most of the
946.08s: marketplace right now the retail
947.60s: investor has
949.04s: you know pennies to the dollar so i'm
951.44s: curious how you view the the markets in
954.08s: terms of who then starts to assume kind
957.36s: of pricing power and you know
959.12s: controlling supply and demand
961.28s: yeah and so this is where i believe that
963.76s: we don't have capitalism we have crony
966.08s: capitalism where we're allowing sort of
968.24s: these big mass production mass mass
971.04s: corporation entities to rise up and
973.68s: control our economy and our government
976.16s: and sit in the you know the pockets of
977.76s: politicians because that's what
979.36s: essentially fiat does because when the
981.04s: federal reserve buys treasury bonds or
983.60s: they make up you know dollars through on
985.76s: their in their electronic system that
988.08s: money goes first to the most
989.52s: credit-worthy entities it doesn't go to
991.12s: small businesses it doesn't go to the
992.72s: average person it goes to massive
995.28s: corporations what have they been doing
996.88s: over the last two decades they buy back
998.64s: their stock and their stock prices go up
1000.48s: but it's not based on value or you know
1003.20s: revenue or the company actually making
1005.68s: great new products it's based on the
1007.28s: fact that they're buying back their
1008.88s: shares and the ceos are getting richer
1010.56s: and richer and so again like this is not
1012.72s: an economy of value it's based on
1014.80s: ballooning asset prices and so
1016.64s: everything looks like it's great but
1018.40s: like the asset prices weren't when we're
1020.96s: in a very expensive stock market right
1022.64s: now right s p 500 went up what 30 last
1026.00s: year i would argue that's closer to the
1027.68s: rate of inflation that we actually have
1029.44s: house prices went up 30 if not more in
1032.08s: certain cities how can the average
1034.00s: person afford a new house great that you
1036.00s: get to sell your place for 30 more but
1037.84s: now you have to buy a place that's 30
1039.68s: more expensive right there's no winner
1041.28s: in this unless you just have a bunch of
1042.72s: homes you're selling and so again i just
1044.80s: think that this leads to this wealth gap
1047.68s: just increasing increasing increasing
1049.52s: because in a system of money printing
1051.28s: and in a system of fiat the people who
1053.44s: have assets the people who have the big
1055.36s: corporations and can get easy money
1057.36s: loans they're the people that win in
1060.00s: this and then the average saver the
1062.00s: average middle class person is getting
1064.00s: robbed through inflation everything
1065.68s: around them is more expensive they can't
1067.28s: save school's more expensive housing
1069.76s: is more expensive and they don't have
1071.20s: access to this easy money
1073.44s: so i just think the system is just
1074.88s: getting more and more broken and because
1076.56s: people don't understand the system and
1078.00s: how money printing works they don't
1079.60s: really understand it i mean
1081.44s: prior to you know i don't know maybe the
1083.76s: pandemic did how many people actually
1086.00s: thought about the fed interest rates
1088.24s: panda like unless you were in the
1089.60s: finance market we're we're in a hyper
1091.76s: financialized world now not many average
1094.40s: people thought about it but today
1095.92s: inflation is one of the main headlines
1097.60s: because they've printed the majority of
1100.00s: the money that's in circulation in just
1101.52s: the last two years so i hopefully think
1104.00s: you know people are waking up to it but
1105.68s: you can't have a system like that
1106.96s: because it it really disadvantages the
1109.36s: average person the saver the worker like
1112.08s: the families that make up i believe the
1113.76s: backbone of our country small business
1115.68s: owners all of that
1117.92s: it's an interesting perspective and i
1119.52s: agree with you especially the the
1121.36s: comment on kind of
1123.12s: i don't know i would almost call it the
1124.40s: bastardization about fiat currency at
1126.56s: this point the way that it's being
1128.40s: deployed um i completely agree with you
1131.36s: there
1132.16s: when i think about
1134.08s: you know the integration of bitcoin
1136.40s: and the ability for a place like the
1139.20s: united states we're starting to see some
1141.44s: integration here there but i'm curious
1143.92s: what your thoughts are on that in terms
1146.08s: of what needs to happen for widespread
1149.92s: bitcoin integration into the u.s economy
1153.60s: so i just think it's about education and
1156.08s: i think that the the
1158.00s: market movers in terms of bitcoin price
1160.16s: are going to be when the institutions
1161.68s: come in and again all of this i think is
1163.68s: about education michael saylor obviously
1166.72s: was a big name over the last two years
1169.44s: he learned about bitcoin because of the
1172.08s: pandemic and the devaluing
1174.72s: currency that he had in his reserves and
1177.12s: in his treasury he couldn't figure out
1179.12s: where to put his money because bonds
1180.80s: with inflation are yielding negative
1182.96s: rates at this point and um so basically
1185.52s: what are you going to do where are you
1186.48s: going to put your money and he makes
1187.60s: these great analogies of the fact that
1189.04s: you know it's like the oxygen is getting
1190.40s: sucked out of the room and you're br
1193.36s: you're breathing less and less every
1194.96s: single year your your money is a melting
1197.36s: ice cube and until bitcoin there really
1200.24s: was no solution um and then bitcoin
1202.56s: drops out of the air like this oxygen
1204.16s: mask and it's like aren't you going to
1205.36s: put it on i mean this is the best
1206.88s: performing monetary asset of the last 10
1209.04s: years but more than that it is the most
1211.12s: powerful computer network in the world i
1212.96s: mean this is essentially
1214.56s: the internet of money it's completely
1216.24s: decentralized there's no point of
1217.76s: failure there's no ceo you have to worry
1219.84s: about there's no politics it's literally
1222.08s: just a system that has created a
1224.80s: mutually beneficial uh incentive program
1228.00s: that almost harnesses greed for good and
1230.64s: is decentralized so that no no person
1233.20s: can control it everyone sort of benefits
1235.36s: if they adopt it and through network
1236.96s: effect it's grown to be the most
1238.24s: powerful cryptocurrency in the world and
1240.80s: i think when you you know when you look
1242.72s: at inflation rates not just in this
1244.32s: country but obviously far worse than
1246.08s: others it's like where do you put your
1247.52s: money today that it's gonna be safe
1249.60s: uh can you can you afford to buy a house
1252.32s: i mean you can i can put five dollars
1254.56s: into bitcoin can you buy five dollars of
1256.64s: real estate in new york no
1258.96s: right um this is securing your property
1261.60s: rights in a way that is
1264.48s: not it's censorship resistant it is
1267.12s: not able to be confiscated it is open
1270.16s: software that anyone can see every
1272.08s: transaction validated and recorded all
1274.48s: the way to the beginning of the
1275.52s: blockchain i mean it's truly incredible
1277.60s: technology um and so i i believe that if
1281.12s: people sort of opt out of the system
1283.12s: start putting their money into bitcoin
1284.88s: they'll see it go up in value it's a
1287.12s: baby monetary network so yes there's
1288.96s: short-term volatility but over the long
1290.64s: run it's literally running upwards as
1293.20s: opposed to the purchasing power of your
1294.64s: dollar which is collapsing every single
1296.64s: year and melting at a rate of between
1298.88s: seven percent is what they tell you but
1300.64s: i believe it's closer to 20 to 30 every
1302.80s: year are you getting a 20 to 30 raise
1305.20s: where are you going to put your money
1306.40s: not in a savings account that has a 0.01
1309.20s: interest yield are you going to gamble
1310.88s: it on stocks well which stocks
1312.88s: do you want to put it all in apple what
1314.56s: are you going to buy like where do you
1315.68s: put your money today it's not safe and
1317.84s: so i believe that bitcoin offers us this
1320.48s: great savings technology and store of
1322.64s: value and immaculate digital property
1325.68s: that's scarce that no one can take from
1327.52s: you and i think it's incredible
1330.56s: so an interesting phrase that you use
1333.28s: that i'm curious about is you say that
1335.20s: it's safer um and i'm i'd love to dive
1338.96s: into that a little bit more and the
1340.40s: reason for that is when i think about
1343.76s: safety
1344.88s: one of the things i would consider is
1346.40s: obviously reduction in variance
1348.24s: reduction in return volatility and like
1350.32s: you said right now we are in a world
1352.88s: where the only way to get a positive
1355.44s: real rate of return is via equity
1357.68s: markets or you know something else like
1360.16s: you know an alternative like bitcoin and
1361.60s: when i think about
1363.12s: um some of the conversation around
1364.72s: bitcoin i can see the long-term safety
1368.80s: um
1369.92s: depending on how adoption goes but you
1371.84s: know i also look at an asset that in the
1374.16s: last you know six months went from what
1376.24s: 69 000 and right now it's hanging at
1378.80s: like 41 480 something like that so to me
1382.40s: i think about safety and i'm like well
1384.96s: you know wait a minute
1386.56s: that's cut by a third and change so how
1389.12s: is that safer to you
1390.96s: yeah so i think safety and volatility
1393.68s: are two different things um
1396.64s: safety to me with bitcoin
1399.28s: kind of refers to the fact that i now
1401.68s: have a form of property that no one can
1403.92s: take away from me that i can take
1405.60s: anywhere in the world and i can transfer
1407.44s: value from any from myself to any part
1410.56s: of the world in a matter of minutes and
1412.72s: no one no one can take that power away
1415.20s: from me you can't you can't take them
1417.12s: the seed phrase out of my head right as
1419.44s: opposed to um this didn't happen with my
1421.76s: family but i've heard so many stories of
1423.36s: people who fled eastern european
1425.20s: countries during communism and they
1427.04s: could only take with them to the us or
1429.04s: wherever they were fleeing a hundred us
1430.96s: dollars worth of whatever they had um
1433.60s: that's all they could take well what if
1435.04s: they had bitcoin
1436.88s: recently when the taliban took over in
1439.12s: afghanistan i heard amazing incredible
1441.12s: stories of the people who had bitcoin
1442.80s: were able to pay for evacuations or
1444.56s: escape the country while the banks were
1447.20s: closed or there was a run on banks and
1448.88s: the traditional finance system collapsed
1450.96s: when the taliban took over and bitcoin
1452.80s: was a way that they could still transact
1454.48s: and
1455.28s: basically pay for their families to have
1457.92s: an escape i mean it's it's literally in
1459.84s: real time empowering people with both
1462.16s: financial freedom as well as human
1463.84s: rights and so i think that that's
1465.12s: incredible is it a volatile asset
1467.68s: absolutely because as i mentioned
1469.44s: earlier it's in the baby stages of
1471.12s: monetization it is a brand new monetary
1473.44s: network and you know in different
1475.84s: countries it's also it has different tax
1477.84s: implications and you could trade it in
1480.40s: and out of the highs and lows in places
1482.16s: like dubai or uae and you get no tax
1484.48s: penalty and here in the in the us like
1487.04s: we're if you hold you want to hold
1489.20s: because you don't want to face capital
1490.40s: gains tax right taxes right so we're in
1492.96s: the baby stages of monetization but i
1494.96s: would prefer to have an extremely
1497.44s: volatile
1498.64s: appreciating asset that year over years
1501.76s: just going up in value as opposed to an
1504.32s: extremely stable
1506.56s: not volatile at all asset like cash
1509.28s: which is collapsing in value over the
1511.76s: last several years right so i can
1514.32s: stomach the volatility and i get that
1516.72s: people need to you know use their fiat
1519.12s: money for everyday expenses and a lot
1521.44s: you know not a lot of places even accept
1523.04s: bitcoin and i would argue you want to
1524.64s: hold something that's increasing in
1526.08s: value but ultimately i see it as a safer
1529.44s: place because i don't have to worry
1531.12s: about a ceo i don't have to worry about
1533.44s: some you know some product having good
1535.84s: or bad performance supply chain issues i
1539.12s: don't have to worry about a certain
1540.24s: politician getting elected it's it's
1542.56s: just is what it is it's a computer
1544.32s: network that allows us to store
1547.12s: our monetary energy in a place that has
1549.76s: outperformed everything else that exists
1552.24s: and that is controlled by no one and
1554.48s: that no one can manipulate because
1556.08s: there's a finite amount secured by this
1558.64s: decentralized network so i don't know if
1560.64s: that answers your question but like
1562.96s: safety is like not about its volatility
1565.76s: yeah no it does and that really i'm
1567.68s: actually really stoked that you took the
1569.68s: conversation in that direction just
1571.36s: because i've talked to some different
1572.96s: people with varying concept of you know
1575.28s: again safety and i always feel like
1577.92s: that's an important differentiate to
1579.36s: make and i think the way that you phrase
1581.92s: that i totally agree with that that
1583.44s: makes total sense to me and especially
1584.88s: because
1585.84s: sometimes what frustrates me with some
1587.44s: of the bitcoin conversations is some
1589.04s: people don't like to admit that it's
1590.88s: super volatile short term and then it
1593.92s: markets closed um but then it makes you
1596.56s: know it almost makes the rest of the
1597.52s: conversation kind of hard to like really
1599.52s: conceptualize so i i think that that's a
1601.68s: really really great way
1603.68s: to highlight you know the the safety
1605.92s: concept for something like bitcoin i
1607.36s: agree with you there i think that's a
1608.48s: great a great way to phrase it um
1611.20s: so being mindful of your time i do have
1613.28s: two more questions the first one is
1615.36s: looking into 2022
1618.08s: what what is it what is you know
1620.56s: what happens to bitcoin do you see more
1622.72s: adoption coming especially with the fed
1625.36s: coming out with this interest rate
1627.36s: manipulation you know we're expecting
1628.80s: three to four rises starting as soon as
1630.80s: march
1631.84s: like i'm just curious at a very high
1633.68s: level what do you think is going to
1634.88s: happen to bitcoin throughout the rest of
1636.40s: this year
1637.76s: yeah so um i have really high hopes for
1640.32s: bitcoin hitting new all-time highs
1642.72s: because ultimately i do think that it's
1645.28s: still correlated in some way to the
1647.36s: traditional markets and liquidity
1649.68s: and what i hope everyone is learning
1651.60s: over the the last at least year or two
1654.24s: is that our economy is basically
1656.80s: addicted to quantitative easing and
1658.72s: stimulus uh it's addicted to the money
1660.72s: printer and as soon as they try to let
1663.36s: off the gas pedal everything tanks right
1665.92s: and goes into the red and so um
1668.40s: unfortunately our fed is now between a
1670.88s: rock and a hard place because we have so
1672.72s: much debt and we can't service that debt
1675.52s: if they raise interest rates
1676.80s: meaningfully to a place where they
1678.40s: probably should raise interest rates
1680.48s: they would cause a complete credit
1682.32s: collapse and
1683.60s: you know bankruptcies and the unwinding
1685.68s: of this massive leverage that we have
1687.68s: that's historic that's a much bigger
1689.28s: bubble than we had in 2008
1691.68s: uh but if we go the other way and we
1693.44s: keep printing then it's just devaluing
1695.44s: our currency more but it obviously makes
1697.20s: it cheaper to service our debt so pretty
1699.20s: much i i believe that they're going to
1701.20s: go by way of inflation they're going to
1703.12s: give us the headlines of inflation's
1704.88s: good and this is why it's good oh oh now
1707.12s: we're going to have price controls and
1708.56s: they're going to try to fix transitory
1710.00s: inflation right exactly yeah now
1713.28s: we're seeing the narrative that you know
1714.64s: now we're going to potentially have uh
1716.56s: price fixing and wage controls which
1718.88s: it's like it's it's sad because it's
1720.56s: clear that most people who are leading
1722.72s: this country politically don't
1724.08s: understand basic economics and the times
1726.40s: in history when people tried that and it
1728.40s: really didn't work
1729.68s: right so um so what i believe will
1732.32s: happen is i believe they will talk about
1734.40s: tapering they might try to raise you
1736.40s: know a couple basis points they won't be
1738.00s: able to uh we have an election coming up
1740.72s: we are going to have to have green
1741.92s: markets for that what's that going to
1743.28s: mean more money printing more devaluing
1745.12s: of our currency i think that that's
1746.56s: going to help bitcoin anything with
1747.92s: liquidity is going to help bitcoin in
1749.52s: any time that people realize that this
1751.44s: system is just too far gone at this
1753.52s: point we're insolvent and we're addicted
1755.44s: to the money printer and we're just
1756.72s: gonna keep debasing our currency bitcoin
1759.04s: is a fantastic technology that opts us
1761.20s: out and i think more and more people
1762.56s: will adopt that both institutions and
1764.40s: retailers i'm so happy and grateful that
1767.04s: we have this technology and so i think
1769.12s: bitcoin you know once the markets are
1772.16s: are given the green light from the fed
1773.92s: that no more tapering is going to happen
1776.00s: i think they're going to run and i think
1777.20s: bitcoin is going to run with it
1779.44s: interesting yeah i that i think um
1782.88s: i mean when i think about bitcoin though
1784.40s: it's kind of boring right because big
1786.32s: daddy j-pal can't just turn on the
1787.92s: printer and then just print bitcoin so
1790.24s: what where's the entertainment now just
1792.08s: kidding
1792.84s: um they should print money to buy
1795.44s: bitcoin
1798.16s: um that's
1799.84s: an interesting it's an interesting
1802.16s: outlook and it highlights really my last
1804.96s: question and it's something that i'm
1806.56s: just personally curious about
1808.88s: i find that we always at least as
1811.84s: traders we're always looking for
1813.28s: relationships and correlations and how
1815.44s: things interact with other things and
1817.84s: bitcoin is a tricky one because for a
1820.32s: while a lot of people saw it as an
1822.48s: inflation hedge
1823.92s: and then some people are saying well is
1825.44s: it really an inflation hedge so that's
1828.32s: really the the last nuanced question i
1830.00s: have for you is
1831.92s: how do you think bitcoin interacts with
1835.60s: directly with interest rates do you
1838.08s: think that it's something people can
1839.68s: slowly add to the portfolio as a style
1841.76s: of hedge do you think that they're too
1843.44s: just disjointed for that to really be an
1845.76s: observable relationship at this point
1847.36s: what does that look like to you
1849.04s: for me and i said this recently in a
1850.64s: news show that i was a part of i believe
1853.04s: that bitcoin is a fantastic inflation
1855.04s: hedge and i think that a non-zero
1858.24s: position is the right one for everyone
1859.84s: at this point and everyone has different
1862.08s: amounts of risk and volatility they can
1863.84s: stomach but i believe at least a one to
1865.92s: five percent is smart for everyone
1868.80s: and i and i really try to educate as
1871.12s: many people about it as possible because
1873.36s: at this point it is literally the best
1875.04s: performing monetary asset of the last
1876.88s: decade it's appreciated about a million
1878.64s: percent the second best performer was
1880.24s: tesla at 15 000
1882.08s: amazon and apple stocks were about 14 12
1885.12s: 12 and 1400 respectively s p 500 at
1888.08s: about 300 over the last decade gold went
1890.88s: down about six percent so it's not the
1892.80s: inflation hedge that i suppose it once
1894.88s: was um but let's look at the last couple
1896.88s: of just the last couple of years 2019
1899.28s: was around 90 that bitcoin went up uh 20
1902.48s: 20 300
1904.24s: last year 60
1906.00s: inflation yes they're telling us it's
1907.76s: seven percent but let's look at how much
1909.36s: assets have gone up let's look at the s
1911.04s: p let's look at how much housing has
1912.56s: gone up by that's what i believe tells
1914.72s: the real story of inflation tell seven
1916.88s: percent of the person going to to gas
1918.88s: and paying you know 40 more at the pump
1921.20s: or paying 25 more for their meat at the
1923.52s: supermarket inflation is a massive
1925.92s: problem we're being misguided and
1928.24s: misinformed about it by the media which
1930.24s: is really sad i i come from a journalism
1932.80s: background we should be watchdogs for
1934.48s: the government we shouldn't be
1936.00s: lap dogs and propagandists for the
1938.00s: government and their policies we should
1939.68s: be really holding their feet to the fire
1941.60s: and so i think that the inflation um
1944.00s: narratives you know we need to we need
1945.84s: to actually inform people about how this
1947.68s: is
1948.72s: really hurting them at in their bottom
1950.40s: lines and the stimulus checks are just
1952.64s: like a little crumb you know in all of
1955.04s: the you know i think it's a distraction
1956.80s: yeah i think it's a distraction yep i
1958.80s: think that's just to csu people okay so
1961.12s: yeah i lied to you
1962.72s: i mean look at those percentages you
1964.16s: beat inflation all those years if you
1965.76s: have bitcoin
1967.28s: right yeah yeah and i mean it's a great
1969.52s: it's a great way to think about it
1970.64s: especially as like a longer term asset i
1972.56s: think that's that's a good story um and
1975.76s: i i typically lie with the last question
1977.76s: because i always think of one more and i
1979.36s: just lied to you because i have one very
1981.20s: last one i promise
1983.92s: so for people that are interested in
1986.64s: getting involved
1988.40s: do you have any recommendations for them
1989.76s: and the reason why i asked that is i
1991.04s: talked to some different people and for
1993.20s: me personally i've always been kind of
1995.12s: an advocate of a platform that gives you
1997.76s: like actual direct exposure to holding
2000.08s: the currency as compared to indirect
2001.60s: exposure things like that but i'm
2003.12s: curious from your perspective if
2004.40s: somebody is like i'm curious in bitcoin
2006.64s: want to get started what should they do
2009.28s: yeah so um just a couple things on that
2011.36s: i i think education again is is number
2013.44s: one and until you understand the problem
2015.20s: you don't appreciate why bitcoin is a
2016.88s: solution right so i think first people
2019.60s: should look at you know their their
2022.00s: financial lives are they making enough
2024.48s: to be able to comfortably plan
2026.48s: retirement or plan a future for their
2028.80s: family for their kids are they are they
2031.28s: stressed out financially well if you are
2033.68s: and i would argue that a lot of people
2035.36s: feel that way in this country
2037.20s: what are what's the rate of return
2038.64s: you're getting on your investments if
2040.00s: you're investing what's the rate that
2041.28s: you got on your stocks what's the rate
2042.72s: you're getting in your savings account
2044.16s: or in your 401k what's that percentage
2046.72s: now let's compare that to bitcoin there
2048.72s: are so many avenues that you can invest
2050.32s: in bitcoin now but i agree with you i
2052.16s: think holding bitcoin directly becoming
2054.32s: your own bank and becoming financially
2056.00s: sovereign is the number one and it is a
2058.48s: little bit technology technologically
2060.56s: intimidating for some people because
2062.32s: it's the idea of you know taking
2064.08s: ownership and having something that's
2065.60s: completely digital in your custody and
2067.44s: you have to protect it um there are also
2069.92s: other avenues where there are trusted
2072.00s: third parties and multi-sig wallets and
2073.92s: all of that that will help you protect
2075.20s: your bitcoin but number one is just
2077.04s: education look at your financial life
2079.68s: and and tell me if if it's performing
2082.08s: the way you want it to and then let's
2083.76s: look at bitcoin's performance if you
2085.28s: want to read a book about bitcoin the
2086.80s: best one out there i've read it
2088.56s: countless times now bitcoin standard
2090.64s: number one best book it's hardly even
2093.20s: really about bitcoin it's about the
2094.56s: history of money and how our system got
2097.20s: to be where it is and why we're
2098.88s: struggling with some of these issues
2101.04s: and why bitcoin was invented it is a
2102.96s: phenomenal book it helped get me down
2105.12s: the rabbit hole um and then you know
2107.76s: start investing that's the best way buy
2109.76s: bitcoin buy two dollars worth of bitcoin
2111.52s: buy five dollars worth of bitcoin you
2113.20s: know spare the coffee that you would
2114.72s: have had and put that money into bitcoin
2116.32s: and watch watch its performance over the
2118.48s: next five six ten
2120.48s: twelve months um i really just believe
2122.88s: you know having a little bit of exposure
2124.88s: gets you interested and engaged um doing
2127.68s: the homework but you know it's just
2129.36s: simple things
2130.48s: how are you doing well financially if
2132.88s: not you know one to five percent is
2135.20s: pretty conservative if it goes if it
2137.68s: goes down you lost one to five percent
2139.92s: if it does what i believe it will do
2142.32s: you could you could potentially change
2143.92s: your life with it so um so yeah i i have
2146.88s: two websites that i recommend personally
2149.04s: i love swan bitcoin um they're a bitcoin
2152.56s: only exchange they're fantastic and okay
2155.68s: coin okay coin is available in the most
2157.36s: amount of countries in the world has
2158.64s: very low dollar cost averaging fees so
2160.64s: basically you can like set up a
2161.76s: recurring buy and you don't have to pay
2163.36s: fees on it like you do with some other
2164.80s: exchanges that are are big names out
