592.00s: so
594.00s: the
597.00s: lead to dilution, depending on what path they choose. But it does not inherently dilute
604.00s: anything. It realistically just kind of kicks the cam a little further down the road.
608.72s: You don't have to, they don't have to make a choice yet. So I want to make sure that
612.00s: that one is addressed because it's a great question. Another one here from Waco Paco says,
617.84s: Newton says these bonds make take M and A off the table because the cash needs to be held
622.52s: as collateral against the bonds is this true. So this is far as I can tell is not true.
631.24s: And I'll show you. It's because of this. If we take a look at the offering, the notes
642.04s: will be general, unscured obligations of GameStop, unscured. So that means that the cash doesn't
650.16s: have to sit there. So and if you, if we think about it logically, there really wouldn't
655.32s: be some sort of big benefit to offer these bonds if the cash had to sit there, right?
661.80s: So we can kind of reason through it that they clearly want the cash for something. And
668.00s: one of the things we know is the accumulation of Bitcoin, they've already demonstrated that
672.36s: quite clearly. Now beyond that, it could be other stuff and that's okay too. But
680.36s: this I think is probably something Newton might just miss. The dudes looking at a lot of stuff.
685.16s: But for this common specifically, I just, I don't think that this is accurate, that the cash
690.84s: needs to be held as collateral. I think that the cash is being raised to be used. And we can
697.72s: tell by the terms of the offering on them being unscured that it doesn't need to be backed
703.96s: in cash or percentage of cash. Because that's another commonality by the way.
710.52s: You can have the scenario where it's not necessarily backed by full cash. And it's backed by a certain
719.16s: amount of cash or something like that. Like that's totally cool as well. But that's just not the
726.92s: case here. The case here is pretty clear, unsecured debt. So another great, another great perceptive
734.84s: question. But I think that's the, that's the best answer I have to that one at least as of right now.
740.76s: Okay. So that does lead to the broader earnings release and what it looks like they're trying to
751.80s: do here. And it seems like they've, they being Cohen and the leadership team, the exact team.
759.56s: They've, they've made it pretty clear on like what path they're trying to take things in my opinion.
764.52s: I think that they're trying to move closer and closer into the collectibles, the card space
769.72s: grading. They made all that quite clear. And now with the recent move into Bitcoin, they've also
777.08s: made that pretty clear. That Bitcoin is going to be a part of the business. Now as I mentioned in
782.84s: the video from this last week, I genuinely do believe Bitcoin is a part of the puzzle here.
790.20s: But we will have to see how big of a part because it is my genuine hope that GameStop does not
798.44s: go the way of micro strategy. I don't believe that they are, but just because it's my hope that
804.76s: they don't, doesn't mean it is or is not going to happen. It's something that I'm just keeping
809.96s: a pretty close eye on because as you guys know, I hold, I hold a position in GameStop specifically
816.60s: for this series actually just because it's something that I wanted to participate alongside
822.68s: the ape community more as a demonstration of respect. But there are conditions on my holding.
830.92s: And it's because I'm a trader. And I wouldn't, I wouldn't hold a company that I didn't like for
837.96s: some reason. And right now I still like the company. But if it starts going too far down the path
844.36s: of micro strategy, I actually have some concerns with the way that micro strategy does their business.
849.72s: You guys have heard me refer to this before. Like I genuinely believe that is a quasi-ponsi scheme.
855.40s: Maybe not even quasi. Like I think you could argue that it is a Ponzi scheme, which I don't dig.
861.00s: It's working because Bitcoin is going up. So no hate towards them at all. They're doing the thing.
869.40s: But I also can look at that and I can see immense risk if there is for whatever reason,
875.64s: some sort of significant, significant sell off in Bitcoin, then that micro strategy party starts
883.32s: to look a lot, a lot different. Pretty damn fast I will add. It's something that is, yeah,
892.20s: that's a whole other bag. But that's one of the reasons why I'm really not that I really don't
898.44s: want GameStop to go down that path fully. Although I don't think there's anything wrong picking up
906.12s: Bitcoin. Like I actually think that that's smart. Now, as I also talked about in the video, but will
913.32s: recap right now quickly is their recent 10Q. So their recent 10Q is interesting because if we start
923.88s: flipping through or not, there it goes. It just got completely locked up.
932.68s: Motorcycle Marx is PSA merger someday, but PSA market cap is five times GameStop is this possible.
938.60s: Yeah, I mean, it's so regardless of market cap, it can be possible. But yeah, in that context,
946.04s: it would be quite unlikely for the merger to go that way being GameStop acquiring PSA.
953.00s: Now, there is a world where there can be kind of like a version of a reverse merger where GameStop
961.80s: becomes a part of PSA. But that would also be a whole other thing. And right now for me,
970.52s: it's really difficult to actually see what direction they're trying to take GameStop. I actually
974.28s: think it's a really, really interesting question because the company itself is now built up
981.16s: enough cash that they genuinely have choices. Like they genuinely have choices available.
988.60s: So I think I was actually just responding to Newton, he and I were talking about the move this week,
996.92s: which also reminded me that I need to hit up. He be.
1003.48s: But I also think that with the cash, there's a few directions they can pivot, but this
1014.28s: this. This sticks out to me. So if you take a look at the chain in assets held for sale in
1027.32s: three May, it was at two 26 mil. So they're starting to, well, not starting. They're continuing to carve out
1037.72s: different pieces of the business. Like we can see that clear as day. They just finished offloading
1043.00s: that Canada side of stuff. So the consolidation is happening. And that's actually really,
1049.64s: really good because when we take a look at GameStop's financials, I think it's still probably the
1058.92s: last one we looked at. That was volunteer. So if we take a look at their financials, oops,
1070.76s: click the wrong one my bad. And I know that this is a pump. Okay.
1077.24s: There's a few things that stick out to me. One of them is revenue. Right. So if we take a look at
1086.68s: revenues, revenues are steadily declining. Not huge, but if we were to draw a line of best fit
1096.76s: across this, it would go something like this. Right. So it would definitely be negative sloping,
1104.28s: which is not ideal. Then we can see net receivables reflecting that. So the amount that were
1110.52s: actually being able to collect. And then if we start looking at other, at other views,
1118.92s: like sales, which is you guys know sales is super important to me. It's probably one of the most
1127.08s: important fundamental indicators that exists because that is what a company is meant to do is sell.
1137.96s: So if we come in here and we take a look at overall cash flow, we can see cash flow is doing well.
1147.24s: This has a lot to do with some really, really, really smart decisions by the leadership team,
1154.44s: which I know unfortunately a lot of people will look at that and be like, oh man, like he stopped,
1161.56s: he stopped the squeeze and whatnot. But I just encourage people to look a little bit at the
1166.84s: deeper game, even with the recent debt offering. I know that a lot of people start thinking like,
1171.48s: oh, here we go diluting again, like that one comment, not that they said that, but that's a sentiment.
1176.20s: I definitely can pick up on. And it's unfortunately just not, it's not really about the impact to price
1186.60s: like right now. And it's important to pay attention to that because what's happening is,
1192.84s: Cohen is now built a company that's going to have over, well, not built. I would say that's
1197.72s: unfair to say because it was built prior. He's steering the company to a spot where it's going to have
1204.76s: over eight billion in cash and Bitcoin. You start looking not only attractive to be acquired,
1213.72s: but you start having some cards that you can play if you choose with that kind of capital. Because
1220.36s: the thing to remember is that even in some sort of merger scenario, you can
1234.76s: do that.
1256.92s: Can you guys hear me? There we go. That was nuts. It literally, I think it's because I have this
1263.00s: old janky cable. So I literally just moved it a little bit and it completely dropped. That was
1269.16s: funny. Sorry about that. Where did I leave off? I left off talking about the different ways a deal
1276.04s: could go down. So one of the things to keep in mind is we can absolutely find ourselves where
1284.60s: they don't have to use the eight billion upfront to do anything because that eight billion serves
1291.64s: as incredible, eight billion incredible collateral. So you can start taking out pretty meaningful
1299.56s: debt to finance whatever that ultimate move is that they might choose to do. So the thing to keep
1307.56s: in mind and it's just don't limit what we think might happen based on the cash that they have in
1315.64s: what that cash itself is worth. You have to look at that cash in terms of buying power.
1321.16s: What could they buy with that cash? And you can gain access to a pretty significant amount of
1328.60s: cash with that. But let's take a look at the trends that we see here. And I want you to focus
1338.04s: on things like gross profit in operating income. Operating income is really important.
1345.08s: The reason why operating income is important is because it gives us a view into how effectively
1353.08s: is this company using what it's designed to do to make money. And you can see that operating
1360.84s: income unfortunately continues to lag like pretty massively. And this is quarter over quarter in
1367.88s: general. Q one was an anomaly for a series of circumstances. I think we've talked about that
1374.36s: before. But the broad trend that you see here is still super negative. Now it is going in the
1384.36s: crack direction, which is solid, but it's still not there yet. This goes back to what I was talking
1390.36s: about in the beginning. Why sales is so important because sales is ultimately what this company
1398.44s: is designed to do. And it needs to be at a point where it's operating income is positive that it's
1405.32s: actually making money from operations. They've been able to create this cash pile. And with
1415.64s: interest rates where they are, they're absolutely able to find what we refer to as other income.
1422.60s: And this breaks down into a bunch of sub buckets. So this is effectively what's saving the company
1430.76s: right now in terms of just a financial picture. So the question for me always goes back to the same
1439.08s: thing, which is what's the game plan? And I'm just unsure yet. I'm very eager to find out, I think
1445.32s: like most of us. Motorcycle Mark says revenue per store is increasing. Revenue is declining because
1452.60s: they closed so many stores. Yeah, well, and that's also to the same vein motorcycle mark is that's
1458.76s: also why revenue per store is increasing, right? Because if you have less stores, the amount that
1465.32s: you make per store is obviously also going to go up. That's why in terms of revenue per store is
1474.12s: that's one metric. But we can zoom that metric out to essentially the very top line what matters,
1480.52s: right? Operating income and overall income, like how much are we making? So to a positive and
1489.00s: their net income is positive, right? They're making money. And a lot of this has to do with the way
1494.68s: that they're using the cash that they have. So this here is what I think really deserves
1506.12s: attention. And it's getting the attention. We can see it getting the attention from them.
1511.72s: So I still believe that the company is making smart moves. I think that they're pivoting pretty well.
1519.08s: I think in general, I think in general, the company is positioned pretty well. But
1531.40s: as weak, like I'm just going back a little further in time and you can see that just operating
1537.40s: income as an overall trend has been a bit of a struggle for some time now. Now let's go, I don't
1545.40s: care so much about the balance she. The honest I care more about cash flow.
1554.04s: So this is starting to contract. I definitely was paying attention to that.
1561.72s: Overall accounts receivable. But we can see other working capital is jacking up pretty significantly
1568.68s: again from a bunch of these other operations. We can see the debt issuance. And then there will be
1574.20s: the subsequent debt issuance on the following. But yeah, this is this is the story, right?
1582.28s: Just how much cash the company has. But I will always go back to you know, the top line,
1589.64s: which is cash is great. But the company has the company has to be a company. It has to do its job.
1597.40s: And right now that can be part cash. But it needs to find a way to use this cash.
1605.48s: Now all that stuff aside, I think GameStop is at an incredible price point here. This is an
1613.56s: incredible price point. And it does look like this is a highly sought after level. We can see the
1624.04s: size of the volume node here. And we can see just the volume here. Not only was this significant
1630.68s: selling pressure, but there is also a shit ton of buying volume. So when we look at the sell side
1639.16s: volume, it was 134 mil. So heavy, heavy sale volume no doubt. But if we take a look at the buy volume,
1648.12s: the buy volume itself is 37 mil. If you take a look at the 20 day average volume of 21 mil,
1655.80s: even on this big ugly down day, buy volume is still massive. It's still bigger than the total 20 day
1662.60s: average volume by one and a half times almost. So from here, you can tell it's highly, highly bid.
1673.00s: Now the process of this, though, really this candle here surprised me on the second day that
1680.68s: I'm highlighting here. This surprised me. The reason why this surprised me is because this was a
1688.12s: super, super tight range. And a lot of people will incorrectly assume something like, oh, well,
1695.64s: Max Payne pinned it there. That's not the case in this circumstance, at least. Now, I think
1704.36s: we will have to see how the market reacts because there's also another factor that we all have
1712.04s: to pay attention to, which is what's happening in the broad market. And the broad market also had
1718.12s: a pretty ugly Friday. And a big part of that has to do with the conflict kicking off with Israel
1724.28s: and Iran. And that's going back and forth now. So now we're stewing a second conflict on top of
1730.84s: Ukraine and Russia, which is still going on for those that are unaware. And that is still a very
1737.64s: significant conflict, by the way. But the stuff with Iran starts to get really dicey because now
1743.80s: we're starting to talk about looking at stuff like, you know, attacking enrichment facilities for
1751.56s: nuclear assets, which that starts to look like a different story. So that's something I think
1761.64s: though the entire world is keeping a close eye on. Now, fun fact is you guys know, all of these
1767.88s: lines, if you go back literally the last six weeks at least, these lines have been here. These lines
1774.12s: are nothing new. And there's no magic. There's no power in the horizontal lines that you see on the
1779.80s: chart. These were all just fit off of different volume nodes. So I did not find it surprising to see
1787.40s: this line essentially show us a general region of pretty significant interest, right? We can see
1795.24s: that based on the buying behavior and the buying activity. Now, if we take a look at where the next
1804.20s: potential zone would look like it's down here. So it's at like the 20 and a half handle because
1810.36s: it really starts to tailor off. But again, the thing that I always go back to is trying to think about
1818.68s: not just what the book value of a company is. I know that's a big thing people do with GameStop
1824.76s: is try to look at the book value. But also try to value things like the intellectual property,
1831.24s: the branding, that kind of stuff because I will always give apes the props they deserve.
1837.24s: You guys have created like you guys are a big part of the business. One of the reasons why the
1844.28s: business is so resilient is because of the ape community to have such a fan base that is decided
1851.96s: to rally behind this stock is really important. So the way all that fits in is I still think that
1862.36s: you know right now it's trading at what like two times to cash well now with the additional debt
1866.92s: maybe a little less. But this to me looks like for anybody that likes GameStop to the upside.
1874.36s: This to me looks like a gift and you all know that have been on the stream at least for again,
1879.80s: this is episode 44. So we've been doing this for almost an entire year now. And you all know
1887.80s: full well that I consider myself a trader. So that means I'm going to trademark it movements and
1894.28s: I'm going to move in and out of things. So I don't just try to spread hype or fud. I try to
1900.52s: look things as they are as objectively as I can. And I do think that if you like GameStop is a
1907.24s: company you're bullish in at long term, this kind of move is a bit of a gift because there's a very
1912.92s: clear catalyst for that sell off. And a big part of that will come from the delta hedging that has
1919.72s: to happen on those bonds. Then you overlay the function of people like me that know when those
1928.28s: bonds get offered, they know that that delta hedging is going to occur. So then we can sell into that
1935.72s: delta hedging by puts sell stock, whatever the version is to trade that down move.
1942.76s: But that down move itself is catalyst driven. It's not driven by a massive fundamental change in
1950.20s: the company. And a move that we saw, we can pretty clearly see that happening here. Because as soon
1957.56s: as the proper positioning was found for most of the the long side of those bonds,
1964.68s: the sell pressure started to unlock pretty massively. And then very, very likely what you see on
1972.44s: the next day is covering people that were just following the broad move down covering the position.
1979.56s: So with that as a just near term catalyst and a very clear one at that, I think it leaves GameStop
1989.96s: pretty well positioned going forward. Now the trick, like I said, if the broad market starts going
1997.80s: down as we saw on Friday, that just creates a challenging environment literally for everything,
2003.16s: not just GameStop, but everything. You can see S&P sold off not massively, but over a percent.
2010.84s: You can see queues sold off a little heavier percent in a quarter. And then you can see small caps
2017.48s: nearly 2%. So the market definitely was under some pressure on Friday. And there's a really good chance
2028.12s: that we'll see that pressure continue into next week. Because if we take a look at the latest news,
2036.52s: I'm going to ask Gemini summarize the latest news on the Israel
2043.16s: I ran conflict. And let's see what we can find on the internet.
2053.96s: One of these will have like a good yeah, this is actually one of the things that I actually like
2061.48s: about CNN is they have a pretty good way of starting a thread and then maintaining it.
2068.52s: So then you have a pretty fair comparison of what's happening.
2079.16s: So first let's see what Gemini says. Jerusalem to Ron 14 June.
2085.56s: Shadow war between Israel. I ran, I ran dramatically escalated, direct and
2090.04s: President and military confrontation over the last 48 hours, both nations lost significant
2094.28s: air strikes. So this we knew was going to happen. So we were actually on a live stream. I traded
2101.24s: the original market move to this because we were literally on a live stream. We could see it
2106.68s: happening live in the futures market. And it was a super tradable event. But that part aside,
2114.36s: the big question that we can see when we were watching it was the uptick and wall. VIX started
2121.48s: moving up, edging up, edging up. And then it was double digits. And it was like 14% up 15.
2127.40s: It started rallying heavy. So that's the market saying like yeah, there is probably going to be a
2134.36s: pretty significant follow through here. So now the question is where does where does this land?
2143.00s: So let's see what we have here. As of Saturday reports from Israeli emergency services indicate
2149.40s: at least three fatalities and dozens of injuries from the Iranian attacks, which is actually really
2153.88s: light. Some buildings sustained direct hits in Iran officials have reported significantly higher
2160.52s: number of casualties, including both military personnel civilians as a result of the Israeli
2164.76s: air strikes. So let's see where we sit now. Both sides issued defiant statements, Prime Minister
2172.76s: of Israel vowed to continue striking any and all threats from Iran, Iranian leaders pledged
2180.68s: a fierce and widespread response. So this is how it goes. Right. One country throws the first
2189.24s: volley. Then the other countries like okay, game on. I guess we're doing this. And then now we're
2194.44s: here back and forth. So the reason why I'm going into this is just because this will impact the market.
2201.00s: And my expectation is futures open tomorrow will be down pretty moderately. Again,
2207.08s: another trade bull event you had better believe I'm going to be sitting there trading that.
2211.00s: And there's a really good chance that this will bleed over into the market on Monday.
2219.16s: And that kind of bleed over will absolutely impact game stop along with the rest of the market.
2226.44s: So even if game stop really wants to start to rally, there's a couple things I'm going to
2230.60s: keep a really close eye on. The first thing is if the market goes down, I want to see how far
2237.96s: game stop moves compared to the market. Then based on that, that'll give me some insight into
2245.32s: how bid it is. And then from there, if it even starts to show a rally, how that compares to the
2253.16s: broader market rally. But we saw this script already last quarter. We saw exactly how it went down.
2260.12s: This one's a little bit different, but nonetheless, that's the broad expectation that I have here.
2265.00s: I think game stop is still in a pretty good spot. Now in that video that I put out, I had discussed
2273.88s: the position that I had in there. If you guys have any questions on that, let me know.
2278.52s: Otherwise, you can find the breakdown in that in that video.
2284.76s: Trading something like this really wasn't that difficult just because of how volatile it is.
2289.96s: So even though it's a really big move, there's actually a ton, a ton of things that can be done.
2296.12s: Now, one thing I am thinking about is if this does start to rally in some sort of way, I actually
2305.00s: would likely not buy stock, even though I'm trading cash secured puts. And I much more likely
2312.28s: will use calls. And the main reason is because of leverage, just expecting it to move a little bit
2319.80s: quicker when it does when it does make the move. So Michael says oil will stay up. That never
2327.88s: seems so much volume. I don't know, right? Like because the thing about oil is there's other like
2338.20s: it already tried to rally pretty heavy above 75 and it got it got shut down hard. So I'm not so
2345.88s: convinced that well, and I guess it also depends on like what stay up means. Like can oil remain
2351.80s: elevated? Sure. I think that that's fair. But I don't really see oil going too far off the
2360.04s: reservation. The reason for that is because oil is one of those things that there's actually a lot
2366.44s: more direct control by the presidency. And we know that Trump is not really interested in really
2374.84s: expensive oil, especially given the rest of the policies that he's running. How disruptive
2379.80s: those policies are, it's kind of important for him to be able to have a couple things to look at
2384.92s: and be like, you know, that's going well, that's going well. And they just finished
2389.56s: plusing up the strategic reserves. So those can open up again. So there's like actual levers that
2397.00s: can be pulled for this. It's a little bit different with some of the other some of the other
2405.56s: market metrics. Michael says Iran has fires on oil in two different places in Iran. Yeah, definitely.
2414.76s: Now if we look at US imports of Iranian sourced oil, let's see. What's our US imports of either
2427.48s: direct or indirect Iranian sourced oil today? Let's see. The reason why I'm asking director
2439.72s: in direct is, you know, there's obviously the direct relationship, but then there's also Iran
2445.08s: sending oil to another spot. And then, you know, circulating that to the US through
2452.20s: an intermediary for different reasons. So as of today, 14 June imports zero crude oil and petroleum
2460.84s: products directly from Iran, comprehensive long-standing sanction regime enforced by that fucking name.
2469.88s: Perhibits US persons and companies from engaging in any trading, including the transportation of oil
2475.24s: with Iran. So yeah, I wanted to see the I wanted to see the indirect, but it makes it difficult to tell.
2487.88s: So yeah, anyways, the main thing I'm showing here is just that it doesn't matter that much for
2494.68s: that reason. The US doesn't, the US doesn't fuck with Iran pretty heavy for a bunch of different
2502.36s: reasons. All right. Back here. Let's take a look now. Is there any other current
2515.96s: optical questions or stuff that you guys want to take a look at before we go into the, before we go
2521.88s: into the DD library, y'all know how that DD library is. Once we're in there, we're in there for a bit
2526.84s: about to get heavy. Let me know if there's anything else that you guys want to take a look at,
2536.28s: or anything like that. Now's a good time. Otherwise, I'm a crack open. This DD library and we are,
2546.84s: we're about to get it.
2552.20s: I'm just getting my dinner order ready.
2559.40s: Sweet. AMD. Yo, AMD's an interesting one to be honest. I got you ducky pie. Let's take a look at AMD.
2570.04s: So, AMD, I was watching how this moved in relation to Cisco last week and then
2588.12s: a couple of Oracle. So if you take a look at Oracle, Oracle had Banger, Banger. Cisco, pretty flat,
2598.52s: comparison. AMD down slightly, slightly different industries. So I'm not directly overlapping. All
2605.16s: of them, you know, saying that they're the exact same or anything like that. But there is a,
2613.16s: a general overlap in different ways. So I find AMD right now to be at a really interesting spot
2622.20s: specifically because it looks like it needs to start making some decisions as a stock.
2631.32s: And AMD's pipeline is really, really interesting simply because if we take a look out, AMD has had
2641.08s: a pretty significant fall from grace. The reason why this is important to acknowledge is when
2646.04s: you see companies have these kinds of moves. It very frequently is due to some sort of underlying
2651.48s: fundamental change. So there's some pretty heavy questions about their pipeline right now.
2657.00s: So I think that that's still generally the case. Now that leads to a couple different ways in my
2663.40s: mind to be able to trade something like this. One way is to trade the longer term return to value
2669.08s: if a trader believes that the company is generally bullish that the pipeline is more solid than
2674.04s: what's happening. And it's trading at a healthy multiple. That kind of stuff.
2680.04s: Then there's the interim price movements. The interim price movements offer a couple really
2686.44s: different ways to trade it. One of it is via volatility. You can see that it maintains pretty
2692.20s: solid risk premiums. Although the risk premiums themselves aren't necessarily that high and they
2698.28s: got really contorted here. But in general, we can see like pretty moderate risk premiums. So
2705.48s: just trading volatility. And you can also trade relative all between AMD and some of its
2712.36s: closer counterparts. That's one way. The second way is trading whatever it ends up doing out of this
2719.56s: basing pattern because this is effectively a big consolidation. This started, it had, what did
2726.28s: it do on earnings? So it had a beat. And it did have a small gap. Let me measure this gap.
2734.04s: The size of the gap matters.
2739.80s: 1.5. So two small. So not a qualifying gap. But nonetheless clearly had some good support through
2749.16s: here. So it does look like the overall trend is shifting, right? Because we can see swing low,
2757.72s: higher lows, then we get higher highs. This kind of nasty, gappy movement very frequently will
2768.28s: eventually have to resolve through some sort of consolidation as people are coming in and coming
2773.08s: out at pretty rapid rates. That's why you see this kind of behavior. And then the recent selloff,
2784.04s: though, is a little concerning, but not too. The reason why it's a little concerning is that
2790.92s: normally if we have a move from here to like here, like a 5% pullback, that's still a little bit
2799.08s: deep, but not too deep. This is getting too deep, right? So it's at 7%. I would say max would be 8%
2806.44s: before I would be trading some sort of like reversion until it starts to normalize again.
2813.00s: So for me, from just a general observation perspective, I would want to see a breakback up above
2818.68s: this. And then if it starts breaking down below this, that's like pretty bad in my opinion,
2823.40s: fairly bearish. Now we could take a look at the options market really fast
2835.72s: and see if anything sticks out to us here.
2838.28s: Now, so like pretty bearish flow for the last few days that generally aligns with what we see here.
2857.40s: And then super bullish on the options chain, though. So it looks like the market still likes it to
2863.72s: the upside long term. That's kind of what I see. All right. Let's take one more and then we'll get to
2871.56s: the DD library. H says, what do you think about options on the levered ETF opening up, which levered
2882.44s: ETF? There's a bunch of them now. TCM King says, can you touch on if you do anything different for
2889.96s: GME coverage strangle for larger accounts? It depends on, I mean,
2899.32s: the account size doesn't really matter. The thing that matters is what the size of the position
2905.48s: is relative to the rest of the account. So if, for example, a larger account,
2920.52s: has a certain allocation to GameStop, then there's really not a whole lot that changes other than
2928.84s: general general scale. So like, if we have an account, let's say, let's say it's a 500K account,
2942.92s: this is where I would consider to be like we're starting to enter a larger portfolio.
2948.28s: And of this 500K, if there's 40% allocated to GameStop, and then 60, whatever else,
2963.16s: well, of this 40% that goes to GameStop, this does, there's not really a change, right, between
2971.00s: whether this is a $500,000 account or $100,000 account or a 50K account, it's kind of the same
2977.80s: shit. The only thing that ultimately changes is the raw dollar sizes of stuff, but the general
2985.24s: approach, at least this I would trade it, is the same because think of the coverage strangle.
2990.20s: We have two ways, three ways, four ways to get long. One way is by shares.
3007.24s: Second way, short puts. Third way is shares plus puts. Some combination. Fourth way,
3018.68s: shares, puts. And then some sort of short call component, even though this is technically negative
3030.04s: delta's. So these are kind of like the different versions in terms of how you can build your
3035.72s: position. So then the way we build the position doesn't have to do with account size. That has to
3041.00s: do with what we think is going to happen. So if I think something is going to go up a whole lot,
3047.16s: then I'm going to pick this one. If I think something is going to continue to trend sideways
3054.28s: like it's been, I'm going to pick this one. If I think something is going to more likely trend
3060.60s: sideways, but might have some sort of explosive movement and I'm not sure, then I go with something
3066.52s: like this. So this is really the main decision cycle behind it. That's quite agnostic to the
3076.12s: account size. It's way more based on what you are hoping to see out of the stock. So that's a good
3083.40s: question. All right, PD library, let's lock in. We got, we got some work to do. So this is sorted
3093.00s: correctly by date. We looked at this one. I think we have this one now. Overvoting.
3109.64s: So this one I think is probably going to do with the access voting based on shares. Oh yeah,
3115.72s: let me follow up with the age. Sorry. On GM EU, it's probably not going to be super liquid is my guess.
3129.56s: So with something like that, I would be less inclined. If it's a smaller account that's trading
3135.64s: like just a couple of lots, there could be something there that's interesting. But GameStop is an
3141.00s: underlying itself has so much ball that seeking leverage to me actually becomes a little more
3148.04s: dangerous than beneficial. The main times you'll see me trade leverage is either of a short term
3154.28s: or if I'm trading index leverage of some way and it's typically because the overall
3158.68s: volume index is much lower. All right, over prevent overvoting prevention. So this likely has to
3166.20s: do with access shares, which we not like this. Yeah, exactly. So votes to ensure no more than
3171.56s: 100 of issued shares are being sold. This is everything to do with essentially naked shorting.
3177.40s: And the fact that there are shares being created at phases that don't make sense relative to
3183.96s: how much of the company is available literally out there in terms of total flow.
3188.04s: So let's see. We already know about the transfer agents. We know the voting process.
3196.84s: If there's anything in here that you guys want to zoom into, let me know. I'm just glossing over
3201.16s: because we've seen a lot of this stuff in different flavors already.
3207.48s: I don't know this one. Let's read through here the Security Transfer Association.
3212.76s: Some of the problems with respect to overvoting statistics compiled to the proxy committed
3217.24s: this year will support recommendation that pre-mailing reconciliation should be mandated. This is
3221.48s: good. So this essentially saying that it's too prevalent. As you can see from the figures above,
3227.32s: tabulators are still encountering numerous situations where a vote is present. There's no obvious
3231.88s: position against which to tabulate it. Okay.
3235.96s: Robridge provides custodian broker with orbs to assist them in eliminating instances of over
3248.52s: reporting. I see. So this is just talking about the back end plombing of trying to limit
3254.28s: the excess voting, which is a thing for sure.
3258.20s: The thing about excess voting, I think, is more interesting really as
3267.40s: like direct smoking gun evidence of the prevalence of excess shares being out in the ether
3275.48s: more than anything. Because I don't think that the like the voting impact itself has had a
3281.48s: tremendous impact at least of late of game stop outright. So I think it's way more of a
3288.68s: flashing signal that there is an issue with naked shorting.
3294.84s: We analyze broad-ritch overvoting prevention system which covers up evidence of
3300.20s: rehab application and synthetic shares when it comes to securities fraud market makers are at
3304.20s: risk of being exposed. They don't want the public RCC to see any quantitative evidence of
3309.88s: rehab application. How far they've gone across the line in security each year. Okay.
3321.00s: Independent audit of broker, uh, broad-ritch reveals the mechanisms for deleting votes.
3327.08s: So this starts to get into like a much more nefarious accusation because the process of
3334.76s: deleting votes obviously indicates a level of knowingly trying to deceive for some sort of reason.
3345.40s: So let's see.
3351.40s: So this just talks about the process. I want to see
3357.00s: the
3359.96s: SCC says you don't own your shares. Any person with direct indirectly
3364.60s: uses truck's proxy. Yeah. So this is just the beneficial owner system versus
3372.52s: actual outright which I think most people are familiar with the difference there.
3380.76s: SCC sites failures to deliver as a primary cause of imbalance. That's
3385.72s: kind of important. Oh shit. It didn't mean to click.
3390.12s: Although there may be many reasons why the number of securities held by broker dealer at DTC
3394.92s: does not match the total number of securities credited to the broker dealers.
3399.00s: Customers accounts as discussed more detail below the situation.
3402.44s: Principle arises in connection with lending transactions and fails to deliver. That's
3407.96s: mean how much fucking evidence do you need before you do something? This is crazy.
3415.56s: Um,
3418.52s: obviously there's been some issues in the balance to shares the broker.
3421.88s: What they pass on on us basically goes away process. We get up and go out the record date
3427.96s: information. Go out to our bank and brokers twice. Basically for every proxy job we do it
3433.88s: once at search once at record date.
3440.36s: We get all the records back aggregate them reports of the issue or gave the same positions.
3445.24s: Putting this scope of market scenario market rag a couple of years ago reached out to us and
3453.08s: said give us a sense of how much of this overreporting over voting is really taking place.
3458.36s: I do apologize that the somewhat data boat we'd be happy to update it but we didn't analysis with
3463.40s: market region. This was the point a couple of years ago where only 10 nominees utilizing this
3468.44s: overreporting service had in place for several years. During that time
3475.24s: when we were the tabulator issuer at the only time we had 329 jobs on average the number of
3481.56s: nominees that overreported the position versus DTC was 31 out of an average group of 228 nominees.
3489.32s: So about 31 out of 228 percentage shares outstanding was less than 2%
3495.08s: after there was a lot of conversations about overreporting and concern. Fascinating.
3499.88s: So if you're detecting a bit of cognitive dissonance that's because it's their broad
3506.92s: rigid divulge a sample size we're overreporting was incidental. Right exactly so this I absolutely
3513.48s: believe is the case here where they're kind of cherry picking. But reg show determined it could
3518.92s: be a lie exactly that was literally just going to say what did reg show show us.
3523.16s: In fact 24 may of seven test me was given at 300 plus companies were still over shorted
3534.52s: number continue to rise until July of O A. That's so fucked.
3552.44s: Delay. Hey I worked there providing independent audit of broadridge IT systems
3561.48s: and their desperate desperation prove their credibility SEC broadridge has inadvertently
3566.04s: disclosed that it hides misrepresented short interest although through vote count obfuscation
3572.84s: the processes as follows. They tell DTC to provide a special feed.
3579.24s: They provide overvote service to clients. DTC then provides second feed which is authorized.
3590.20s: That's fucking crazy. This is a great research paper. I don't know who did this one but let me go
3595.56s: back to the front. I guess I literally could have just clicked this. Shout out to this person exotic
3606.44s: tooth. This is this is like a good research paper. Yeah that's fucking crazy.
3619.48s: One of those things that you look at it and you're like how could this continue to be this is
3624.20s: 674 pages. All right gang. Oh we've oh not this again. Yeah we've seen these. All right.
3633.88s: All right. So what this does is this compiles all of the proceeding posts.
3643.32s: So that one I think we can skip. All right let's see this one. Infinity War final exit.
3653.56s: I'm compiling these who might be interested in the more juicy non TA parts of the weekly DD.
3660.92s: All right let's see.
3665.80s: Jimmy will run further. We can skip all of that.
3679.40s: Fast repair breaks up resistance levels. Gonna ignite interest in the stock.
3683.40s: Large and small buyers rushing to capitalize on the squeeze. Yep.
3690.12s: So this looks like they're just talking about what a squeeze can look like.
3702.36s: Margin call comes to an end.
3705.48s: Viewer halls decreasing volume. Yeah okay I see.
3712.36s: This is like one of the most common
3715.32s: core.
3717.72s: Coral areas I see drawn using Volkswagen as the direct comparison.
3729.32s: This is actually an important note. So one of the things that's worth highlighting from this whole
3735.00s: thing is when volatility is high markets are always going to be wider. Always options markets
3742.36s: will be wider still. And there's a bunch of different reasons but it boils down to it provides
3749.40s: a natural breaking system for things that are going off the rails super fast.
3756.20s: And it has a lot to do with how much vol is being priced in. This is why when you see names that
3763.08s: have really high vol they very frequently have wider bid aspects. This also has to do with what
3768.84s: the preferred inventory is for a company. So specifically market makers that are wanting to
3777.32s: control controller inventory.
3787.48s: I hope to sell everyone get the information put out in one place. Okay so this just kind of
3791.64s: talks about them the way that the squeeze might go. Take a look at a couple more.
3799.24s: I've estimated the current short interest percent based on the short interest report cycle
3803.24s: deep in the money call purchases. This one's going to be difficult and it's because you can't
3808.52s: immediately assume deep in the money calls or even deep in the money short puts are
3816.52s: driven to short interest. I think it might be fair to try to come up with some sort of ratio
3823.48s: of the total number of deep in the money calls but it's a little difficult I think.
3833.64s: Let's see.
3841.08s: Price movement been seeing both Voltael goes up and down. Do not believe they are delaying
3846.04s: FDDs. They're hiding FDDs each time an option is used for a very specific play. We see large
3851.96s: purchases of out of the money puts in the money puts. Yep so options getting very active.
3857.96s: Big reason why you'll see options get active anytime that you see something moving a lot is because
3864.28s: again informed traders like me will and by the way like way smarter than me I should say. We'll
3871.24s: see that kind of activity and then we will look to play it with leverage because it's super efficient.
3878.76s: So it's a big reason why you'll see this. So let's see what they say. Out of the money puts
3885.40s: used to hide short interest percent. This has no effect on the price of GME because they're not
3890.12s: being exercised and they maintain OI even until expiration. Shorters are using these to hide
3898.28s: their short interest percent from the world. The main counter argument to realize is that their
3904.04s: short interest is 20% they covered. So if you're shorter and you I don't this doesn't make sense
3910.92s: to me. Short interest is calculated based on shares like the actual shares. It's not based on
3917.88s: net short interest including options. But I don't actually understand that. I don't understand that.
3926.76s: In the money puts used to flash crash the price. This is an expensive move only happen once.
3940.12s: March 10th is the last ditch effort move where you mass exercise in the money puts to crash the
3949.00s: price down from a critical point. I don't get it. Look at how put OI dropped indicating mass
3970.60s: exercise of options to flash crash. That's not what that means man. So put OI dropping doesn't
3977.16s: mean exercise put OI dropping simply means options are closing now options can close due to exercise
3983.96s: for sure. But the other scenario is simply trading the option. So I don't I don't get that one either.
3996.36s: Out of the money calls used by other large players who want a profit. We only just recently started
4003.64s: seeing these from what I can tell I'm assuming because they started playing popping up and other
4007.80s: big players looking to make some cash. The ones that were purchased expire before 16 July might be
4014.20s: hoping for the squeeze before then and maybe thought 140 was the bottom. I mean I don't agree with that.
4025.24s: Masha says I had you at two times speed and finally caught up that's got to be kind of funny.
4028.84s: This is also a good time to catch up because as you could tell I'm pausing quite a lot to try to
4037.72s: understand what they're saying. In the money calls used by shorters to filter synthetic shares
4044.36s: through and satisfy FTD's I think there's something there. These purchases occur a lot when FTD's
4051.24s: pile up. I believe that they continue to use this in conjunction with Citadel in order to fill up
4056.84s: TD's because there's no liquidity. These options have an effect on price because they are
4061.48s: immediately exercised. I don't think that's correct. They're immediately exercised so that the
4066.04s: shares can be delivered supporting data in the money call volumes versus FTD's. Deep in the money
4072.44s: call volume skyrockets when FTD's increase. Yeah, but that would indicate options are being created
4081.40s: not exercised. So the reason this to me looks like it could be confusing
4092.84s: correlation and causation. That's what I see here. But honestly this just looks like somebody that
4100.28s: doesn't really understand options with what they're assuming here. Let us continue. There are no
4109.00s: shares left. Every share being bought is synthetic. Do you guys know what the max?
4120.76s: Do you guys know what the max? The max number of shares that were locked up were meaning that were
4130.12s: D.R.S. I don't know what that metric is. That like we know definitively.
4140.60s: What is actually going on between each loop? Let me bring up handy dandy chart. Okay.
4151.24s: Retail doesn't get their shares delivered. FTD's start piling up.
4154.60s: I don't understand this one. You cycle. They continually grow in ever larger short position. Thus
4163.40s: ever larger short interest. You know how they see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this one's a little difficult.
4179.56s: We're assuming that the deep and the money calls are not used to hide FTD's. They're rarely used
4184.76s: to satisfy FTD immediately with big shares. So one of the things to keep in mind is with deep
4192.68s: and the money calls, you wouldn't do this. And it's because you're literally lighting your money on
4200.12s: fire. It's super inefficient. You would just buy them on the market.
4211.40s: But yeah, I don't. I don't see this.
4221.88s: Assuming only 30% of the volumes resulted in actual synthetic calls being
4225.88s: exercised to cover FTD. See, that's the thing though is I don't think that that's what's happening.
4233.56s: That's I think a big crux here. I think one of the things that they're trying to do to maintain
4241.72s: the shell game is not transact in the underlying. So yeah, I'm not so sure about this one.
4255.88s: See this one. Handbook of cultural due diligence.
4267.16s: This
4272.12s: key point, the richer born into their networks or they cut or they outcycle everyone else to
4277.64s: earn their way in. Thus they defeat you by dispersing you. You cannot do the same to them.
4282.28s: That's why they're way too warn your community. I hate this kind of stuff. I hate this kind of
4287.80s: stuff. This idea, the thing that I really, really dislike about this is that it I just think it's
4296.36s: so ignorant to completely think about and categorize a group of people like that to say like the richer
4305.16s: born into their networks. Again, defining on like what we consider rich, I think by most standards,
4311.32s: I would be considered rich. And I don't definitely was not born into a network and I'm not sure
4319.32s: that I outcycode other people. So it's like, yeah, I just I don't understand the lens here and I
4327.56s: think that it creates way too much of like a us versus them disposition, which is just not going
4334.84s: to be beneficial to pretty much anybody. Rises, are you not waging war on us, pores? Yeah,
4342.44s: that's like the ultimate irony, right? It spends at least an hour every single day in live streams
4351.80s: with the community, which is hilarious. Let me see. If you want to know how head shells,
4361.88s: fud mongers and the exporters of the world are trained to think and manipulate. Okay.
4371.32s: Appeal to yeah, yeah. If you believe the reason you bought the stockmeasant change by sell, okay.
4382.44s: I fucking love this clip so much. This meme just made me think of the leverage. Jenkins clip. So
4391.88s: the first time I saw that clip, I literally was sitting in a classroom, a Marine Corps classroom
4398.44s: at TBS. We were talking about the orders process. And this popped up because obviously it's a big
4406.84s: joke about planning and the Marine Corps, we typically pride ourselves in planning. So this clip,
4416.44s: we got to play it, man. I don't care if this is a perfectly viable time for the for the stream to
4422.04s: get taken down if we get to watch this. It's just so worth it. Dude.
4434.44s: This is the magic.
4448.92s: Here we go. I got to turn on the volume for you guys.
4453.48s: If anybody need anything off this guy or can we bypass him without shoulders, doesn't, isn't he
4464.44s: paladin? Christopher, uh, Gavarp, all the eggs. We can kind of just, you know, blast him all down
4470.28s: with AoE. Uh, so we can keep him scattered not to fight too many in or vent down. This pretty good plan
4476.68s: that we should, all these guys, I mean, we'll be in trouble if we don't take him down quick. I think
4482.76s: it's a pretty good plan and we should be able to pull it off this time. Uh, what do you think of
4486.36s: dual? Can you give me a number of control quick? Number of control, repeating of course, sir.
4491.48s: I'm coming up with 32.33 repeating of course, percentage of survival. On-slob better than we usually do.
4501.00s: Ah, come on, come on.
4501.88s: Ready, guys, survival. On-slob better than we usually do.
4506.52s: Ready, guys.
4512.84s: Oh my god, he just ran in.
4521.08s: So the entire plan is in the process of going to absolute shit.
4525.00s: Shit.
4532.92s: Not deenately, Roy.
4535.00s: God damn it.
4535.88s: You mean what you mean?
4537.16s: What are you doing?
4538.44s: Dear Luke, this is what you want.
4540.04s: I'm so mad.
4541.56s: I'm down, forgiveness.
4543.32s: God damn it.
4544.04s: This is what I did before.
4545.32s: I can be god of this.
4546.52s: God, I'm trying.
4548.76s: Not my fault.
4549.96s: Who's so stoned?
4552.36s: We do have a so stoned up, don't we?
4554.52s: Oh god.
4559.72s: So that 33% really played out for, I love that clip so much.
4565.40s: So...
4569.08s: Fucking love that clip.
4570.76s: This entire DD was worth whatever we learned about now, unequivocally, for reminding us to watch that.
4578.12s: All right, now I got to get back into whatever this is.
4581.96s: Two sets of information at play in complete contradictory shows
4587.16s: that used by the hedge fund media out.
4589.24s: Oh, okay, so this is about manipulation.
4591.72s: Okay.
4600.68s: If you sell, they win.
4602.52s: And if a story, you might get a little temporary victory for yourself as well, but
4606.68s: the world will continue to be built upon lives and pain.
4611.32s: Well, no, that will continue whether you choose to sell or not sell.
4617.64s: The thing that I would continually remind everybody is that you got to do what's right for you,
4623.08s: especially in the market.
4624.36s: So it's totally cool.
4625.24s: If you choose to band together with the other apes and you want to stick with HOTO, that's great.
4629.96s: You got to do whatever is right for you.
4631.72s: But the thing that I will continually remind people is that if we take a look at GameStop
4639.64s: and we observe even the moves over the last six months, there are tons of opportunities
4649.00s: to make money.
4649.64s: This is a 20% move in two weeks, three weeks, I should say, three trading weeks, 20% move.
4657.00s: That 20% move led to a 23.6% decline over the next four weeks.
4665.80s: So what I'm showing you is that these kinds of movements are highly,
4674.52s: highly tradable.
4676.76s: And in my opinion, the thing to keep in mind is that if you are adept enough and you're agile,
4687.88s: what ends up happening is you actually increase your ability to buy more shares if that's your
4693.48s: ultimate goal. Because if you bought 10 shares at $10 here and then it goes up here and then
4699.08s: they're worth 20 bucks and then it goes here and then they're worth five bucks. You still have
4703.88s: the same inventory. But if you bought 10 here and then you sold five of them here, netting 50 bucks,
4711.64s: whatever the delta is, and then as it's going down, you buy another 10 or 15, well now you've built
4719.08s: inventory, which I think is an important concept to remember.
4727.80s: Mashin says, Newton's doing a good job buying and selling to increase. Yeah, that's huge.
4731.56s: I have no idea what his position is. We haven't talked about it. I don't know if he's going
4735.40s: into it in his videos. But that's one of the reasons why I actually really connected well with
4743.08s: Newton is because he's like a middle ground. Right. So he's clearly crazy about GameStop absolutely
4751.08s: obsessed with it. Like like very much like I am to a degree, he's obviously way more myopic focused
4757.00s: on one thing. But he's also wise enough to understand. And this is one of the things that he and I
4764.12s: talked about actually early on because he used to hold just shares. And I talked to him about
4769.56s: options because I think with the amount of time and attention he spends focusing on this thing
4774.44s: that he could monetize more of it. So yeah, I think that's a great example for him.
4782.36s: So this is still just talking about manipulation and trying to trick people.
4789.56s: Our behavior is under our own control. Yes and no. One of the necessary components for
4793.64s: changes is the growth of vital community that stands out both towards establishing this. So this
4798.12s: is like pretty deep. This is talking about like, completely different shit to be honest.
4810.12s: We can stay poor longer than they can. I tell you what, I would not recommend this route.
4817.96s: One of the things that I have undoubtedly learned because I started
4822.84s: well, by the definition of poor poor, but there are definitely people poorer than me in the beginning.
4830.68s: And I've seen different sides of this coin and poor is just suboptimal. You could still be happy.
4838.36s: You could still live a good fulfilling life if you're poor. I'm not saying poor prohibits that.
4843.80s: It doesn't. But what I can literally guarantee you is that life is better when you are not poor.
4851.32s: So I would recommend thinking of this a little bit differently than simply just trying to ride out
4861.88s: something that you hope eventually explodes. Hopefully you get it. But it might not happen.
4868.04s: And just like I will point out on the last squeeze, if it does happen, there's a good chance there's
4872.76s: going to be an intervention again. So then you still might not get the phone numbers that you're looking for.
4880.68s: All right.
4888.60s: Okay.
4894.12s: Curious. I would deem that a curious piece.
4901.08s: All right. So this will be our next one. Stonks on the moon.
4906.76s: I'm going to call it there because we're like an hour and 20 in, but I will try to remember where we left off.
4915.40s: Super interesting. A couple things that stuck out to me specifically was this one. This was
4923.96s: this was a good piece on overvoting and talking about the very, very
4930.60s: purposeful activity behind it, which I think is an important note. But otherwise, I think that was
4940.20s: kind of the highlight at least for me in the in the series here. Anything else you guys want to
4947.16s: hit really quick before I bounce happy to take a look or answer any other lingering questions real
4955.80s: fast if you guys have any. Otherwise, I think we are back on regular schedule. Next episode will be
4965.00s: next Saturday as per usual, keeping it keeping it G. Benian says, can you look at Intel seems to be
4973.96s: an accumulation with high volume at lows? Sure. Let's take a quick look.
4986.20s: Oh, I and T. C. What the man I just had a complete in for. I mean, this looks I wouldn't call
4995.96s: this accumulation in in the slightest. This at best is distribution. Accumulation is like expansion,
5007.40s: right? That is objectively not what's happening here. This has literally been sideways for six months.
5016.76s: And on a one year time frame, it's declining heavy. So I would consider this entire phase here from
5025.16s: 27 up here, 19 down here. This to me looks like distribution again at best. Accumulation, you'll
5035.64s: start to see it if it actually happens is and is sustained. I would definitely call it possible
5042.84s: because Intel is still integral to this entire picture of stuff that's happening. But Intel has been
5050.52s: under pressure for a while now. I think that they're they're in a delicate spot to move. But
5059.24s: yeah, I'm not going to go into like a full analysis because I got to pop off. But I definitely would
5065.24s: not call this accumulation whatsoever. Like at best distribution. This thing has been over the last
5072.36s: year complete down cycle in over the last six months effectively, completely fat flat. So
5079.96s: the way that I would be looking at this is I wouldn't consider accumulation until you actually
5085.00s: start to see this thing breaking some of these prior highs that are higher than this. This is still
5092.20s: what I would consider to be like a very clearly defined declining channel. So yeah, to me,
5102.36s: it looks like it is finding a floor here. Right. So low higher low and so far higher low. So if this holds,
5111.96s: then I would classify that as good. But that's still it still would have its work cut out for it
5120.36s: from this from this lens. So yeah, looks like it's in a tough spot to me.
5126.04s: All right, gang. Awesome hanging out for the outlier pro community. Tomorrow we got a market
5133.08s: prep session as per usual being outlier. See you guys later.
