 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you news. But it does not inherently dilute anything. It realistically just kind of kicks the cam a little further down the road. You don't have to, they don't have to make a choice yet. So I want to make sure that that one is addressed because it's a great question. Another one here from Waco Paco says Newton says these bonds make take M and A off the table because the cash needs to be held as collateral against the bonds. Is this true? So this is far as I can tell is not true. And I'll show you. It's because of this. If we take a look at the offering, the notes will be general, unscured obligations of GameStop unscured. So that means that the cash doesn't have to sit there. So and if you, if we think about it logically, there really wouldn't be some sort of big benefit to offer these bonds if the cash had to sit there, right? So we can kind of reason through it that they clearly want the cash for something. And one of the things we know is the accumulation of Bitcoin. They've already demonstrated that quite clearly. Now beyond that, it could be other stuff and that's okay too. But this I think is probably something Newton might have just missed. The dude's looking at a lot of stuff. But for this comment specifically, I just, I don't think that this is accurate that the cash needs to be held as collateral. I think that the cash is being raised to be used. And we can tell by the terms of the offering on them being unscured that it doesn't need to be backed in cash or a percentage of cash. Because that's another commonality by the way. You can have the scenario where it's not necessarily backed by full cash. And it's backed by a certain amount of cash or something like that. Like that's totally cool as well. But that's just not the case here. The case here is pretty clear. Unsecured debt. So another great, another great perceptive question. But I think that's the, that's the best answer I have to that one at least does it right now. Okay. So that does lead to the broader earnings release and what it looks like they're trying to do here. And it seems like they've, they being co-in in the leadership team, the exact team. They've, they've made it pretty clear on like what path they're trying to take things in my opinion. I think that they're trying to move closer and closer into the collectibles, the card space grading. They made all that quite clear. And now with the recent move into Bitcoin, they've also made that pretty clear. That Bitcoin is going to be a part of the business. Now, as I mentioned in the video from this last week, I genuinely do believe Bitcoin is a part of the puzzle here. But we will have to see how big of a part because it is my genuine hope that GameStop does not go the way of micro strategy. I don't believe that they are, but just because it's my hope that they don't doesn't mean it is or is not going to happen. It's something that I'm just keeping a pretty close eye on because as you guys know, I hold, I hold a position in GameStop specifically for this series actually just because it's something that I wanted to participate alongside the ape community more as a demonstration of respect. But there are conditions on my holding and it's because I'm a trader. And I wouldn't, I wouldn't hold a company that I didn't like for some reason. And right now, I still like the company. But if it starts going too far down the path of micro strategy, I actually have some concerns with the way that micro strategy does their business. You guys have heard me refer to this before like I genuinely believe that is a quasi-ponsi scheme, maybe not even quasi. Like I think you could argue that it is a Ponzi scheme, which I don't take. It's working because Bitcoin is going up. So no hate towards them at all. They're doing the thing. But I also can look at that and I can see immense risk if there is for whatever reason, some sort of significant, significant sell off in Bitcoin, then that micro strategy party starts to look a lot, a lot different. Pretty damn fast I will add. It's something that is, yeah, that's a whole other bag. But that's one of the reasons why I'm really not that I really don't want GameStop to go down that path fully. Although I don't think there's anything wrong picking up Bitcoin. Like I actually think that that's smart. Now, as I also talked about in the video, but will recap right now quickly is their recent 10Q. So their recent 10Q is interesting because if we start flipping through or not, there it goes. It just got completely locked up. Motorcycle Marx is PSA merger someday, but PSA market cap is five times GameStop is this possible. Yeah, I mean, it's, so regardless of market cap, it can be possible. But yeah, in that context, it would be quite unlikely for the merger to go that way being GameStop acquiring PSA. Now, there is a world where there can be kind of like a version of a reverse merger where GameStop becomes a part of PSA. But that would also be a whole other thing. And right now for me, it's really difficult to actually see what direction they're trying to take GameStop. I actually think it's a really, really interesting question because the company itself is now built up enough cash that they genuinely have choices. Like they genuinely have choices available. So I think I was actually just responding to Newton. He and I were talking about the move this week, which also reminded me that I need to hit up. He be. But I also think that with the cash, there's a few directions they can pivot, but this this sticks out to me. So if you take a look at the chain in assets held for sale in 3 May, it was at 226,000. So they're starting to, well, not starting. They're continuing to carve out different pieces of the business. Like we can see that clear as day. They just finished off-loading that Canada side of stuff. So the consolidation is happening. And that's actually really, really good because when we take a look at GameStop's financials, I think it's still probably the last one we looked at. Oh, that was volunteer. So if we take a look at their financials, oops, click the wrong one my bad. And I know that this is a problem. Okay. There's a few things that stick out to me. One of them is revenue. Right. So if we take a look at revenues, revenues are steadily declining. Not huge, but if we were to draw a line of best fit across this, it would go something like this. Right. So it would definitely be negative sloping, which is not ideal. Then we can see net receivables reflecting that. So the amount that we're actually being able to collect. And then if we start looking at other, at other views, like sales, which is you guys know, sales is super important to me. It's probably one of the most important fundamental indicators that exists because that is what a company is meant to do is sell. So if we come in here and we take a look at overall cash flow, we can see cash flow is doing well. This has a lot to do with some really, really, really smart decisions by the leadership team, which I know unfortunately a lot of people will look at that and be like, oh man, like he stopped, he stopped the squeeze and whatnot. But I just encourage people to look a little bit at the deeper game, even with the recent debt offering. I know that a lot of people start thinking like, oh, here we go diluting again, like that one comment, not that they said that, but that's a sentiment. I definitely can pick up on. And it's unfortunately just not, it's not really about the impact to price like right now. And it's important to pay attention to that because what's happening is, Cohen is now built a company that's going to have over, well, not built. I would say that's unfair to say, because it was built prior. He's steering the company to a spot where it's going to have over eight billion in cash and Bitcoin. You start looking not only attractive to be acquired, but you start having some cards that you can play if you choose with that kind of capital. Because the thing to remember is that even in some sort of merger scenario, you can get a lot of money. Can you guys hear me? There we go. That was nuts. It literally, I think it's because I have this old janky cable. So I literally just moved it a little bit and it completely dropped. That was funny. Sorry about that. Where did I leave off? I left off talking about the different ways a deal could go down. So one of the things to keep in mind is we can absolutely find ourselves where they don't have to use the eight billion upfront to do anything because that eight billion serves as incredible, eight billion incredible collateral. So you can start taking out pretty meaningful debt to finance whatever that ultimate move is that they might choose to do. So the thing to keep in mind, and it's just don't limit what we think might happen based on the cash that they have in what that cash itself is worth. You have to look at that cash in terms of buying power. What could they buy with that cash? And you can gain access to a pretty significant amount of cash with that. But let's take a look at the trends that we see here. And I want you to focus on things like Gross Profit in operating income. Operating income is really important. The reason why operating income is important is because it gives us a view into how effectively is this company using what it's designed to do to make money. And you can see that operating income unfortunately continues to lag like pretty massively. And this is quarter over quarter in general. Q one was an anomaly for a series of circumstances. I think we've talked about that before. But the broad trend that you see here is still super negative. Now it is going in the crack direction, which is solid, but it's still not there yet. This goes back to what I was talking about in the beginning. Why sales is so important because sales is ultimately what this company is designed to do. And it needs to be at a point where it's operating income is positive that it's actually making money from operations. They've been able to create this cash pile. And with interest rates where they are, they're absolutely able to find what we refer to as other income. And this breaks down into a bunch of sub buckets. So this is effectively what's saving the company right now in terms of just a financial picture. So the question for me always goes back to the same thing, which is what's the game plan? And I'm just unsure yet. I'm very eager to find out, I think like most of us. Motorcycle Mark says revenue per store is increasing. Revenue is declining because they close so many stores. Yeah, well, and that's also to the same vein motorcycle mark is that's also why revenue per store is increasing, right? Because if you have less stores, the amount that you make per store is obviously also going to go up. That's why in terms of revenue per store is one that's one metric, but we can zoom that metric out to essentially the very top line what matters, right? Operating income and overall income, like how much are we making? So to a positive and their net income is positive, right? They're making money. And a lot of this has to do with the way that they're using the cash that they have. So this here is what I think really deserves attention and it's getting the attention. We can see it getting the attention from them. So I still believe that the company is making smart moves. I think that they're pivoting pretty well. I think in general, I think in general, the company is positioned pretty well, but as weak like I'm just going back a little further in time and you can see that just operating income as an overall trend has been a bit of a struggle for some time now. Now let's go. I don't care so much about the balance sheet. The honest I care more about cash flow. So this is starting to contract. I definitely was paying attention to that. Overall accounts receivable, but we can see other working capital is jacking up pretty significantly again from a bunch of these other operations. We can see the debt issuance and then there will be the subsequent debt issuance on the following. But yeah, this is this is the story, right? Just how much cash the company has, but I will always go back to the top line, which is cash is great, but the company has the company has to be a company. It has to do its job. And right now that can be part cash, but it needs to find a way to use this cash. Now all that stuff aside, I think GameStop is at an incredible price point here. This is an incredible price point. And it does look like this is a highly sought after level. We can see the size of the volume note here and we can see just the volume here. Not only was this significant selling pressure, but there is also a shit ton of buying volume. So when we look at the sell side volume, it was 134 mil. So heavy, heavy sale volume no doubt. But if we take a look at the buy volume, the buy volume itself is 37 mil. If you take a look at the 20 day average volume of 21 mil, even on this big ugly down day by volume is still massive. It's still bigger than the total 20 day average volume by one and a half times almost. So from here, you can tell it's highly, highly bid. Now the process of this, though, really this candle here surprised me on the second day that I'm highlighting here. This surprised me. The reason why this surprised me is because this was a super, super tight range. And a lot of people will incorrectly assume something like, oh, well, Max Payne pinned it there. That's not the case in this circumstance, at least. Now I think we will have to see how the market reacts because there's also another factor that we all have to pay attention to, which is what's happening in the broad market. And the broad market also had a pretty ugly Friday. And a big part of that has to do with the conflict kicking off with Israel and Iran. And that's going back and forth now. So now we're stewing a second conflict on top of Ukraine and Russia, which is still going on for those that are unaware. And that is still a very significant conflict, by the way. But the stuff with Iran starts to get really dicey because now we're starting to talk about looking at stuff like, you know, attacking enrichment facilities for nuclear assets, which that starts to look like a different story. So that's something I think the entire world is keeping a close eye on. Now, fun fact is you guys know, all of these lines, if you go back, literally the last six weeks at least, these lines have been here. These lines are nothing new. And there's no magic. There's no power in the horizontal lines that you see on the chart. These were all just fit off of different volume nodes. So I did not find it surprising to see this line essentially show us a general region of pretty significant interest, right? We can see that based on the buying behavior and the buying activity. Now, if we take a look at where the next potential zone would look like it's down here. So it's at like the 20 and a half handle. Because it really starts to tailor off. But again, the thing that I always go back to is trying to think about not just what the book value of a company is. I know that's a big thing people do with GameStop is try to look at the book value. But to also try to value things like the intellectual property, the branding, that kind of stuff. Because I will always give apes the props they deserve. You guys have created like you guys are a big part of the business. One of the reasons why the business is so resilient is because of the ape community to have such a fan base that is decided to rally behind this stock is really important. So the way all that fits in is I still think that right now it's trading at what like two times to cash. Well, now with the additional debt, maybe a little less. But this to me looks like for anybody that likes GameStop to the upside. This to me looks like a gift. And you all know that have been on the stream at least for again, this is episode 44. So we've been doing this for almost an entire year now. And you all know full well that I consider myself a trader. So that means I'm going to trade market movements and I'm going to move in and out of things. So I don't just try to spread hype or fud. I try to look things as they are as objectively as I can. And I do think that if you like GameStop as a company, your bullish in at long term, this kind of move is a bit of a gift. Because there's a very clear catalyst for that sell off. And a big part of that will come from the Delta hedging that has to happen on those bonds. Then you overlay the function of people like me that know when those bonds get offered, they know that that Delta hedging is going to occur. So then we can sell into that Delta hedging by puts sell stock, whatever the version is to trade that down move, but that down move itself is catalyst driven. It's not driven by a massive fundamental change in the company. And a move that we saw, we can pretty clearly see that happening here. Because as soon as the proper positioning was found for most of the the long side of those bonds, the sell pressure started to unlock pretty massively. And then very, very likely what you see on the next day is covering people that were just following the broad move down covering the position. So with that as a just near term catalyst and a very clear one at that, I think it leaves GameStop pretty well positioned going forward. Now the trick, like I said, if the broad market starts going down as we saw on Friday, that just creates a challenging environment literally for everything, not just GameStop but everything. You can see S&P sold off not massively, but over a percent. You can see queues sold off a little heavier percent in a quarter. And then you can see small caps, nearly 2%. So the market definitely was under some pressure on Friday. And there's a really good chance that we'll see that pressure continue into next week. Because if we take a look at the latest news, I'm going to ask Gemini summarize the latest news on the Israel I ran conflict. And let's see what we can find on the internet. One of these will have like a good. Yeah, this is actually one of the things that I actually like about CNN is they have a pretty good way of starting a thread and then maintaining it. So then you have a pretty fair comparison of what's happening. So first let's see what Gemini says. Jerusalem to Iran, 14 June, shadow war between Israel, Iran, Iran dramatically escalated, direct and unprecedented military confrontation over the last 48 hours, both nations lost significant air strikes. So this we knew was going to happen. So we were actually on a live stream. I traded the original market move to this because we were literally on a live stream. We could see it happening live in the futures market. And it was a super tradable event. But that part aside, the big question that we can see when we were watching it was the uptick and wall. Vicks started moving up, edging up, edging up, and then it was double digits and it was like 14% up 15. It started rallying heavy. So that's the market saying like, yeah, there is probably going to be a pretty significant follow through here. So now the question is where does where does this land? So let's see what we have here. As of Saturday reports from Israeli emergency services indicate at least three fatalities and dozens of injuries from the Iranian attacks, which is actually really light. Some buildings sustained direct hits in Iran officials have reported significantly higher number of casualties, including both military personnel civilians as a result of the Israeli air strikes. So let's see where we sit now. Both sides issued defiant statements, Prime Minister of Israel vowed to continue striking any and all threats from Iran, Iranian leaders pledged a fierce and widespread response. So this is how it goes. Right. One country throws the first volley than the other countries like, okay, game on. I guess we're doing this and then now we're here back and forth. So the reason why I'm going into this is just because this will impact the market. And my expectation is futures open tomorrow will be down pretty moderately. Again, another trade bull event you had better believe I'm going to be sitting there trading that. And there's a really good chance that this will bleed over into the market on Monday. And that kind of bleed over will absolutely impact game stop along with the rest of the market. So even if game stop really wants to start to rally, there's a couple things I'm going to keep a really close eye on. The first thing is if the market goes down, I want to see how far game stop moves compared to the market. Then based on that, that'll give me some insight into how bid it is. And then from there, if it even starts to show a rally, how that compares to the broader market rally. But we saw this script already last quarter. We saw exactly how it went down. This one's a little bit different, but nonetheless, that's the broad expectation that I have here. I think game stop is still in a pretty good spot. Now in that video that I put out, I had discussed the position that I had in there. If you guys have any questions on that, let me know. Otherwise, you can find the breakdown in that in that video. Trading something like this really wasn't that difficult just because of how volatile it is. So even though it's a really big move, there's actually a ton, a ton of things that can be done. Now, one thing I am thinking about is if this does start to rally in some sort of way, I actually would likely not buy stock, even though I'm trading cash secured puts. And I much more likely will use calls. And the main reason is because of leverage, just expecting it to move a little bit quicker when it does make the move. So, Michael says oil will stay up that never seen so much volume. I don't know, right? Because the thing about oil is there's other, it already tried to rally pretty heavy above 75 and it got shut down hard. So I'm not so convinced that, well, and I guess it also depends on what stay up means. Can oil remain elevated? Sure. I think that that's fair. But I don't really see oil going too far off the reservation. The reason for that is because oil is one of those things that there's actually a lot more direct control by the presidency. And we know that Trump is not really interested in really expensive oil, especially given the rest of the policies that he's running. How disruptive those policies are, it's kind of important for him to be able to have a couple things to look at and be like, you know, that's going well, that's going well. And they just finished plusing up the strategic reserves so those can open up again. So there's like actual levers that can be pulled for this. It's a little bit different with some of the other, some of the other market metrics. Michael says Iran has fires on oil in two different places in Iran. Yeah, definitely. Now, if we look at US imports of Iranian sourced oil, let's see. What are US imports of either direct or indirect Iranian sourced oil today? Let's see. The reason why I'm asking director in direct is, you know, there's obviously the direct relationship, but then there's also Iran sending oil to another spot. And then, you know, circulating that to the US through an intermediary for different reasons. So as of today, 14 June imports zero crude oil and petroleum products directly from Iran, comprehensive long-standing sanction regime enforced by that fucking name prohibits US persons and companies from engaging in any trading, including the transportation of oil with Iran. So, yeah, I wanted to see the, I wanted to see the indirect, but it makes it difficult to tell. So yeah, anyways, the main thing I'm showing here is just that it doesn't matter that much for that reason. The US doesn't, the US doesn't fuck with Iran pretty heavy for a bunch of different reasons. All right. Back here. Let's take a look now. Is there any other current optical questions or stuff that you guys want to take a look at before we go into the, before we go into the DD library, y'all know how that DD library is. Once we're in there, we're in there for a bit. It's about to get heavy. Let me know if there's anything else that you guys want to take a look at, or anything like that. Now's a good time. Otherwise, I'm a crack open. This DD library, and we are, we're about to get it. I'm just getting my dinner order ready. Sweet. AMD. Yo, AMD's an interesting one to be honest. I got you ducky pie. Let's take a look at AMD. So AMD, I was watching how this moved in relation to Cisco last week. And then a couple of Oracle. So if you take a look at Oracle, Oracle had Banger, Banger, Cisco, pretty flat comparison. AMD down slightly, slightly different industries. So I'm not directly overlapping all of them, saying that they're the exact same or anything like that. But there is a general overlap in different ways. So I find AMD right now to be at a really interesting spot, specifically because it looks like it needs to start making some decisions as a stock. And AMD's pipeline is really, really interesting, simply because if we take a look out, AMD has had a pretty significant fall from grace. The reason why this is important to acknowledge is when you see companies have these kinds of moves, it very frequently is due to some sort of underlying fundamental change. So there's some pretty heavy questions about their pipeline right now. So I think that that's still generally the case. Now that leads to a couple different ways in my mind to be able to trade something like this. One way is to trade the longer term return to value if a trader believes that the company is generally bullish, that the pipeline is more solid than what's happening. And it's trading at a healthy multiple. That kind of stuff. Then there's the interim price movements. The interim price movements offer a couple really different ways to trade it. One of it is via volatility. You can see that it maintains pretty solid risk premiums. Although the risk premiums themselves aren't necessarily that high and they got really contorted here. But in general, we can see like pretty moderate risk premiums. So just trading volatility. And you can also trade relative vol between AMD and some of its closer counterparts. So that's one way. The second way is trading whatever it ends up doing out of this basing pattern. Because this is effectively a big consolidation. This started, it had, what did it do on earnings? So it had a beat and it did have a small gap. Let me measure this gap. The size of the gap matters. 1.5 so too small. So not a qualifying gap. But nonetheless clearly had some good support through here. So it does look like the overall trend is shifting, right? Because we can see swing low higher lows than we get higher highs. This kind of nasty, gnarly, gappy movement very frequently will eventually have to resolve through some sort of consolidation as people are coming in and coming out at pretty rapid rates. That's why you see this kind of behavior. And then the recent sell-off though is a little concerning but not too. The reason why it's a little concerning is that normally if we have a move from here to like here like a 5% pullback, that's still a little bit deep but not too deep. This is getting too deep, right? So it's at 7%. I would say max would be 8% before I would be trading some sort of like reversion until it starts to normalize again. So for me from just a general observation perspective, I would want to see a break back up above this. And then if it starts breaking down below this, that's like pretty bad, it might pin in fairly bearish. Now we could take a look at the options market really fast and see if anything sticks out to us here. So like pretty bearish flow for the last few days that generally aligns with what we see here. And then super bullish on the options chain though. So it looks like the market still likes it to the upside long term. That's kind of what I see. All right. Let's take one more and then we'll get to the DD library. H says, what do you think about options on the levered ETF opening up, which levered ETF? There's a bunch of them now. TCM King says, can you touch on if you do anything different for GME coverage strangle for larger accounts? It depends on, I mean, the account size doesn't really matter. The thing that matters is what the size of the position is relative to the rest of the account. So if for example, a larger account has a certain allocation to GameStop, then there's really not a whole lot that changes other than general general scale. So like if we have an account, let's say, let's say it's a 500K account. This is where I would consider to be like we're starting to enter a larger portfolio. And of this 500K, if there's 40% allocated to GameStop and then 60, whatever else. Well, of this 40% that goes to GameStop, this does, there's not really a change, right? Between whether this is a $500,000 account or $100,000 account or a 50K account, it's kind of the same shit. The only thing that ultimately changes is the raw dollar sizes of stuff, but the general approach, at least this I would trade it, is the same because think of the coverage strangle. We have two ways, three ways, four ways to get long. One way is by shares. Second way, short puts. Third way is shares plus puts. Some combination. Fourth way, shares, puts. And then some sort of short call component, even though this is technically negative delta's. So these are kind of like the different versions in terms of how you can build your position. So then the way we build the position doesn't have to do with account size. That has to do with what we think is going to happen. So if I think something is going to go up a whole lot, then I'm going to pick this one. If I think something is going to continue to trend sideways like it's been, I'm going to pick this one. If I think something is going to more likely trend sideways, but might have some sort of explosive movement and I'm not sure, then I go with something like this. So this is really the main decision cycle behind it. That's quite agnostic to the account size. It's way more based on what you are hoping to see out of the stock. So that's a good question. All right, PD library, let's lock in. We got, we got some work to do. So this is sorted correctly by date. We looked at this one. I think we have this one now. Overvoting. So this one I think is probably going to do with the access voting based on shares. Oh yeah, let me follow up with the age. Sorry. On GM EU, it's probably not going to be super liquid is my guess. So with something like that, I would be less inclined. If it's a smaller account that's trading like just a couple of lots, there could be something there that's interesting. But GameStop is an underlying itself has so much ball that seeking leverage to me actually becomes a little more dangerous than beneficial. The main times you'll see me trade leverage is either of a short term or if I'm trading index leverage of some way and it's typically because the overall volume index is much lower. All right, over prevent overvoting prevention. So this likely has to do with access shares, which we not like this. Yeah, exactly. So votes to ensure no more than 100 of issued shares are being sold. This is everything to do with essentially naked shorting. And the fact that there are shares being created at phases that don't make sense relative to how much of the company is available literally out there in terms of total flow. So let's see. We already know about the transfer agents. We know the voting process. If there's anything in here that you guys want to zoom into, let me know. I'm just glossing over because we've seen a lot of this stuff in different flavors already. I don't know this one. Let's read through here the Security Transfer Association. Some of the problems with respect to overvoting statistics compiled to the proxy committed this year will support recommendation that pre-mailing reconciliation should be mandated. This is good. So this essentially saying that it's too prevalent. As you can see from the figures above, tabulators are still encountering numerous situations where a vote is present. There's no obvious position against which to tabulate it. Okay. Robridge provides custodian broker with orbs to assist them in eliminating instances of over reporting. I see. So this is just talking about the back end plombing of trying to limit the excess voting, which is a thing for sure. The thing about excess voting, I think, is more interesting really as like direct smoking gun evidence of the prevalence of excess shares being out in the ether more than anything. Because I don't think that the like the voting impact itself has had a tremendous impact at least of late of game stop outright. So I think it's way more of a flashing signal that there is an issue with naked shorting. We analyze broad-ritch overvoting prevention system which covers up evidence of rehab application and synthetic shares when it comes to securities fraud market makers are at risk of being exposed. They don't want the public RCC to see any quantitative evidence of rehab application. How far they've gone across the line in security each year. Okay. Independent audit of broker, uh, broad-ritch reveals the mechanisms for deleting votes. So this starts to get into like a much more nefarious accusation because the process of deleting votes obviously indicates a level of knowingly trying to deceive for some sort of reason. So let's see. So this just talks about the process. I want to see the SCC says you don't own your shares. Any person with direct indirectly uses truck's proxy. Yeah. So this is just the beneficial owner system versus actual outright which I think most people are familiar with the difference there. SCC sites failures to deliver as a primary cause of imbalance. That's kind of important. Oh shit. It didn't mean to click. Although there may be many reasons why the number of securities held by broker dealer at DTC does not match the total number of securities credited to the broker dealers. Customers accounts as discussed more detail below the situation. Principle arises in connection with lending transactions and fails to deliver. That's mean how much fucking evidence do you need before you do something? This is crazy. Um, obviously there's been some issues in the balance to shares the broker. What they pass on on us basically goes away process. We get up and go out the record date information. Go out to our bank and brokers twice. Basically for every proxy job we do it once at search once at record date. We get all the records back aggregate them reports of the issue or gave the same positions. Putting this scope of market scenario market rag a couple of years ago reached out to us and said give us a sense of how much of this overreporting over voting is really taking place. I do apologize that the somewhat data boat we'd be happy to update it but we didn't analysis with market region. This was the point a couple of years ago where only 10 nominees utilizing this overreporting service had in place for several years. During that time when we were the tabulator issuer at the only time we had 329 jobs on average the number of nominees that overreported the position versus DTC was 31 out of an average group of 228 nominees. So about 31 out of 228 percentage shares outstanding was less than 2% after there was a lot of conversations about overreporting and concern. Fascinating. So if you're detecting a bit of cognitive dissonance that's because it's their broad rigid divulge a sample size we're overreporting was incidental. Right exactly so this I absolutely believe is the case here where they're kind of cherry picking. But reg show determined it could be a lie exactly that was literally just going to say what did reg show show us. In fact 24 may of seven test me was given at 300 plus companies were still over shorted number continue to rise until July of O A. That's so fucked. Delay. Hey I worked there providing independent audit of broadridge IT systems and their desperate desperation prove their credibility SEC broadridge has inadvertently disclosed that it hides misrepresented short interest although through vote count obfuscation the processes as follows. They tell DTC to provide a special feed. They provide overvote service to clients. DTC then provides second feed which is authorized. That's fucking crazy. This is a great research paper. I don't know who did this one but let me go back to the front. I guess I literally could have just clicked this. Shout out to this person exotic tooth. This is this is like a good research paper. Yeah that's fucking crazy. One of those things that you look at it and you're like how could this continue to be this is 674 pages. All right gang. Oh we've oh not this again. Yeah we've seen these. All right. All right. So what this does is this compiles all of the proceeding posts. So that one I think we can skip. All right let's see this one. Infinity War final exit. I'm compiling these who might be interested in the more juicy non TA parts of the weekly DD. All right let's see. Jimmy will run further. We can skip all of that. Fast repair breaks up resistance levels. Gonna ignite interest in the stock. Large and small buyers rushing to capitalize on the squeeze. Yep. So this looks like they're just talking about what a squeeze can look like. Margin call comes to an end. Viewer halls decreasing volume. Yeah okay I see. This is like one of the most common core. Coral areas I see drawn using Volkswagen as the direct comparison. This is actually an important note. So one of the things that's worth highlighting from this whole thing is when volatility is high markets are always going to be wider. Always options markets will be wider still. And there's a bunch of different reasons but it boils down to it provides a natural breaking system for things that are going off the rails super fast. And it has a lot to do with how much vol is being priced in. This is why when you see names that have really high vol they very frequently have wider bid aspects. This also has to do with what the preferred inventory is for a company. So specifically market makers that are wanting to control controller inventory. I hope to sell everyone get the information put out in one place. Okay so this just kind of talks about them the way that the squeeze might go. Take a look at a couple more. I've estimated the current short interest percent based on the short interest report cycle deep in the money call purchases. This one's going to be difficult and it's because you can't immediately assume deep in the money calls or even deep in the money short puts are driven to short interest. I think it might be fair to try to come up with some sort of ratio of the total number of deep in the money calls but it's a little difficult I think. Let's see. Price movement been seeing both Voltael goes up and down. Do not believe they are delaying FDDs. They're hiding FDDs each time an option is used for a very specific play. We see large purchases of out of the money puts in the money puts. Yep so options getting very active. Big reason why you'll see options get active anytime that you see something moving a lot is because again informed traders like me will and by the way like way smarter than me I should say. We'll see that kind of activity and then we will look to play it with leverage because it's super efficient. So it's a big reason why you'll see this. So let's see what they say. Out of the money puts used to hide short interest percent. This has no effect on the price of GME because they're not being exercised and they maintain OI even until expiration. Shorters are using these to hide their short interest percent from the world. The main counter argument to realize is that their short interest is 20% they covered. So if you're shorter and you I don't this doesn't make sense to me. Short interest is calculated based on shares like the actual shares. It's not based on net short interest including options. But I don't actually understand that. I don't understand that. In the money puts used to flash crash the price. This is an expensive move only happen once. March 10th is the last ditch effort move where you mass exercise in the money puts to crash the price down from a critical point. I don't get it. Look at how put OI dropped indicating mass exercise of options to flash crash. That's not what that means man. So put OI dropping doesn't mean exercise put OI dropping simply means options are closing now options can close due to exercise for sure. But the other scenario is simply trading the option. So I don't I don't get that one either. Out of the money calls used by other large players who want a profit. We only just recently started seeing these from what I can tell I'm assuming because they started playing popping up and other big players looking to make some cash. The ones that were purchased expire before 16 July might be hoping for the squeeze before then and maybe thought 140 was the bottom. I mean I don't agree with that. Masha says I had you at two times speed and finally caught up that's got to be kind of funny. This is also a good time to catch up because as you could tell I'm pausing quite a lot to try to understand what they're saying. In the money calls used by shorters to filter synthetic shares through and satisfy FTD's I think there's something there. These purchases occur a lot when FTD's pile up. I believe that they continue to use this in conjunction with Citadel in order to fill up TD's because there's no liquidity. These options have an effect on price because they are immediately exercised. I don't think that's correct. They're immediately exercised so that the shares can be delivered supporting data in the money call volumes versus FTD's. Deep in the money call volume skyrockets when FTD's increase. Yeah, but that would indicate options are being created not exercised. So the reason this to me looks like it could be confusing correlation and causation. That's what I see here. But honestly this just looks like somebody that doesn't really understand options with what they're assuming here. Let us continue. There are no shares left. Every share being bought is synthetic. Do you guys know what the max? Do you guys know what the max? The max number of shares that were locked up were meaning that were D.R.S. I don't know what that metric is. That like we know definitively. What is actually going on between each loop? Let me bring up handy dandy chart. Okay. Retail doesn't get their shares delivered. FTD's start piling up. I don't understand this one. You cycle. They continually grow in ever larger short position. Thus ever larger short interest. You know how they see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this one's a little difficult. We're assuming that the deep and the money calls are not used to hide FTD's. They're rarely used to satisfy FTD immediately with big shares. So one of the things to keep in mind is with deep and the money calls, you wouldn't do this. And it's because you're literally lighting your money on fire. It's super inefficient. You would just buy them on the market. But yeah, I don't. I don't see this. Assuming only 30% of the volumes resulted in actual synthetic calls being exercised to cover FTD. See, that's the thing though is I don't think that that's what's happening. That's I think a big crux here. I think one of the things that they're trying to do to maintain the shell game is not transact in the underlying. So yeah, I'm not so sure about this one. See this one. Handbook of cultural due diligence. This key point, the richer born into their networks or they cut or they outcycle everyone else to earn their way in. Thus they defeat you by dispersing you. You cannot do the same to them. That's why they're way too warn your community. I hate this kind of stuff. I hate this kind of stuff. This idea, the thing that I really, really dislike about this is that it I just think it's so ignorant to completely think about and categorize a group of people like that to say like the richer born into their networks. Again, defining on like what we consider rich, I think by most standards, I would be considered rich. And I don't definitely was not born into a network and I'm not sure that I outcycode other people. So it's like, yeah, I just I don't understand the lens here and I think that it creates way too much of like a us versus them disposition, which is just not going to be beneficial to pretty much anybody. Rises, are you not waging war on us, pores? Yeah, that's like the ultimate irony, right? It spends at least an hour every single day in live streams with the community, which is hilarious. Let me see. If you want to know how head shells, fud mongers and the exporters of the world are trained to think and manipulate. Okay. Appeal to yeah, yeah. If you believe the reason you bought the stockmeasant change by sell, okay. I fucking love this clip so much. This meme just made me think of the leverage. Jenkins clip. So the first time I saw that clip, I literally was sitting in a classroom, a Marine Corps classroom at TBS. We were talking about the orders process. And this popped up because obviously it's a big joke about planning and the Marine Corps, we typically pride ourselves in planning. So this clip, we got to play it, man. I don't care if this is a perfectly viable time for the for the stream to get taken down if we get to watch this. It's just so worth it. Dude. This is the magic. Here we go. I got to turn on the volume for you guys. If anybody need anything off this guy or can we bypass him without shoulders, doesn't, isn't he paladin? Christopher, uh, Gavarp, all the eggs. We can kind of just, you know, blast him all down with AoE. Uh, so we can keep him scattered not to fight too many in or vent down. This pretty good plan that we should, all these guys, I mean, we'll be in trouble if we don't take him down quick. I think it's a pretty good plan and we should be able to pull it off this time. Uh, what do you think of dual? Can you give me a number of control quick? Number of control, repeating of course, sir. I'm coming up with 32.33 repeating of course, percentage of survival. On-slob better than we usually do. Yeah. On-slob better than we usually do. Oh my god, he just ran in. So the entire plan is in the process of going to absolute shit. So that that 33% really played out for I love that clip so much. So fucking love that clip this this entire DD was worth whatever we learned about now unequivocally for reminding us to watch that. All right. Now I got to get back into whatever this is. Two sets of information at play in complete contradictory shows that used by the hedge fund media out. Oh, okay. So this is about manipulation. Okay. If you sell, they win end of story. You might get a little temporary victory for yourself as well. But the world would continue to be built upon lies and pain. So that will continue whether you choose to sell or not sell. The thing that I would continually remind everybody is that you got to do what's right for you, especially in the market. So it's totally cool if you choose to band together with the other apes and you want to stick with hotel. That's great. You got to do whatever is right for you. But the thing that I will continually remind people is that if we take a look at GameStop games, we observe even the moves over the last six months. There are tons of opportunities to make money. This is a 20% move in two weeks, three weeks, I should say three trading weeks, 20% move. That 20% move led to a 23.6% decline over the next four weeks. But what I'm showing you is that these kinds of movements are highly, highly tradable. And in my opinion, the thing to keep in mind is that if you are adept enough and you're agile, what ends up happening is you actually increase your ability to buy more shares if that's your ultimate goal. Because if you bought 10 shares at $10 here and then it goes up here and then there were a 20 bucks and then it goes here and then there were five bucks, you still have the same inventory. But if you bought 10 here and then you sold five of them here, netting 50 bucks, whatever the delta is, and then as it's going down, you buy another 10 or 15, well now you've built inventory, which I think is an important concept to remember. Amechan says, Newton's doing a good job buying and selling to increase. Yeah, that's huge. I have no idea what his position is. We haven't talked about it. I don't know if he's going into it in his videos. But that's one of the reasons why I actually really connected well with Newton is because he's like a middle ground, right? So he's clearly crazy about game stop, absolutely obsessed with it. Like very much like I am to a degree, he's obviously way more myopic focused on one thing. But he's also wise enough to understand, and this is one of the things that he and I talked about actually early on because he used to hold just shares. And I talked to him about options because I think with the amount of time and attention he spends focusing on this thing that he could monetize more of it. So yeah, I think that's a great example for him. So this is still just talking about manipulation and trying to trick people. Our behavior is under our own control. Yes and no. One of the necessary components for change is the growth of vital community that stands out both towards establish. So this is like pretty deep. This is talking about like, completely different shit to be honest. We can stay poor longer than they can. I tell you what, I would not recommend this route. One of the things that I have undoubtedly learned because I started well by the definition of poor poor, but there are definitely people poorer than me in the beginning. And I've seen different sides of this coin and poor is just suboptimal. You could still be happy. You could still live a good fulfilling life if you're poor. Not I'm not saying poor prohibits that it doesn't. But what I can literally guarantee you is that life is better when you are not poor. So I would recommend thinking of this a little bit differently than simply just trying to ride out something that you hope eventually explodes. Hopefully you get it, but it might not happen. And just like I will point out on the last squeeze, if it does happen, there's a good chance there's going to be an intervention again. So then you still might not get the phone numbers that you're looking for. Right. Okay. Curious. I would deem that a curious piece. All right. So this will be our next one. Stongues on the moon. I'm going to call it there because we're like an hour and 20 in, but I will try to remember where we left off. Super interesting. A couple things that stuck out to me specifically was this one. This was this was a good piece on over voting and talking about the very, very purposeful activity behind it, which I think is an important note. But otherwise, I think that was kind of the highlight at least for me in the, in the series here. Anything else you guys want to hit really quick before I bounce happy to take a look or answer any other lingering questions real fast if you guys have any. Otherwise, I think we are back on regular schedule next episode will be next Saturday as per usual keeping it, keeping it G. Benian says can you look at Intel seems to be an accumulation with high volume at lows. Sure. Let's take a quick look. Oh, I and you see what the man I just had a complete for. I mean, this looks. I wouldn't call this accumulation in the slightest. This at best is distribution accumulation is like expansion, right? That is objectively not what's happening here. This has literally been sideways for six months. And on a one year time frame, it's declining heavy. So I would consider this entire phase here from 27 up here, 19 down here. This to me looks like distribution again at best accumulation. You'll start to see it if it actually happens is and is sustained. I would definitely call it possible because Intel is still integral to this entire picture of stuff that's happening. But Intel has been under pressure for a while now. I think that they're they're in a delicate spot to move. But yeah, I'm not going to go into like a full analysis because I got to pop off, but I definitely would not call this accumulation whatsoever. Like at best distribution. This thing has been over the last year complete down cycle and over the last six months effectively completely fat flat. So the way that I would be looking at this is I wouldn't consider accumulation until you actually start to see this thing breaking some of these prior highs that are higher than this. And still what I would consider to be like a very clearly defined declining channel. So yeah, to me, it looks like it is finding a floor here, right? So low higher low and so far higher low. So if this holds, then I would classify that as good. But that's still it still would have its work cut out for it from this from this lens. So yeah, looks like it's in a tough spot to me. All right, gang, awesome hanging out for the outlier pro community tomorrow. We got our market prep session as per usual being outlier. See you guys later.
