810.00s: you
840.00s: of false alarms. Okay. When you say false alarms, is that people doing like the date calling
845.12s: thing? I've never fully understood that yet. But is that what you mean by false alarms?
851.28s: Roaring Titi says a lot of people got really wrecked when Robin Hood took away the buy button.
856.88s: I don't understand that to be honest. I don't understand how Robin Hood taking the buy button
861.76s: away and other brokerages taking the buy button away like wrecked people. Because you can still sell,
867.68s: you can still get out. So I understand that that means that the stock didn't keep going up
875.60s: parabolically. But that goes back to the thing that I've talked with Newton about and I've also
881.52s: talked with Peruvian Bull about where the like, again, like this is why I don't fully understand
892.08s: the angle sometimes because Roaring Titi says a lot of brokers went down retail couldn't do
899.92s: anything for a time. Is that is that accurate? Like they couldn't sell either because that actually
908.72s: would be very surprising to me. Now if it was frozen, limit up, limit down, then yeah, you'd
914.96s: have to catch it outside of the lock periods. But from what I saw, there was still order flow
923.04s: happening. Yeah, Jimmy says it made people lose faith in retail trading, I think that I don't
936.40s: know. I just, it surprises me so much. The reason why it surprises me so much is because
945.52s: I don't understand how anybody in their rational mind would expect any stock, not GameStop,
952.96s: but any stock to go up into essentially to a point where it could collapse the financial system.
961.20s: I'm not saying that the conditions being set leading to that as a possible outcome or rational,
967.60s: they're not. That's from a bunch of bullshit. Completely agree. Notive. But I think it's interesting
974.64s: to me when something that clearly hasn't had a big change in fundamental value goes up over,
981.92s: to over 400 bucks for multiple days and then to just kind of sit there and hold it, right? Because
991.04s: if I'm not mistaken, it hung up in like the multiple hundreds for a few days. Let me make sure I'm not
998.00s: way off base.
1005.60s: Does trading view do like pre-adjusted split basis or whatever?
1011.92s: It doesn't look like it. It looks like it does split adjusted. Yeah, because it was over
1021.52s: 400 back here.
1028.08s: Lauren says the fact that a stock going up could wreck the financial system is a little problem,
1033.04s: in my opinion. It's a huge problem. The fact that that's a thing and the fact that that was the
1040.24s: case here is insane. And this is literally one of the shining examples of broad manipulation,
1048.80s: 100% broad manipulation. And the fact that this was at such a severe range is crazy to me that it
1059.36s: was even allowed to be like, how can something be multiple hundreds per cent short?
1065.36s: There's only so many fucking shares. So like that stuff is so frustrating. And again,
1072.88s: I completely agree with like those components. But again, it's so important to decouple frustrations,
1081.28s: preferences, what we wish reality was from what reality is. And the fact that this shouldn't
1090.40s: have been multiple 100% shorted and even in a position to be able to go up to 400 plus,
1097.68s: that can only happen from a systemic manipulation that's being caught in unwound. So love that,
1104.32s: because I would love for those people to get wrecked. But to still again, from the practical side of
1111.52s: things, to not exit your position on the 27th, the 28th, the 29th, the first.
1122.88s: Like that's a solid four day window to GTFO, take profits, and then wait for another run to get back
1133.52s: in. So that's just the part that I don't understand. Like I get that this movement didn't materialize
1143.60s: as far as it theoretically could have. We know that for sure. But we also know again, pretty
1150.16s: reasonably that we're not going to allow the financial system to collapse because of this issue.
1156.88s: Again, we have to like, we have to partition these things because in my opinion,
1162.32s: if there's the intervention to prevent the collapse, then those who are systemically on the
1168.16s: wrong side of this trade, they should go out of fucking business and they should have to pay.
1172.40s: Like I literally think they should go bankrupt. But that's a, that's a, again, that's like another part
1177.28s: of the broader partitioning mentality that I go through. But like if this goes into a total
1183.12s: financial collapse, then nobody makes money anyways. The stock market collapsed. So it's like,
1189.92s: I just don't understand the broader expectation there. It's from a, as you can tell from a trading
1197.92s: perspective, it baffles me. But from a systematic perspective, it shows that we have massive problems,
1205.36s: massive problems. And there's still here. That's the other frustrating part about this is that I am
1211.12s: also in the camp that I don't really think that everybody's unwound that should have unwound.
1219.44s: That's what I think. Of Roentit, he says they changed the rule when retail starts to fuck up their
1225.68s: money, which is largely profiting off of us. In this case, I agree with you. I fully agree with you.
1234.40s: Again, I think that this is a, is a prime example of a problem of literally a big problem.
1244.80s: So yeah, I completely, completely agree with that.
1251.20s: Magnum says those investing click the buy cell blaming the buy button off is like blaming
1256.72s: gun doing during a shooting incident. Yeah, it is kind of like that, I think that the main thing is
1263.52s: again, I just, I don't think anybody has a good argument that the buy button being turned off hurt
1269.04s: them is all it can frustrate them. We could have thought something should have gone further.
1273.52s: Like all of those are completely, completely viable points. But there was, there was plenty of time
1279.36s: to unwind here. Like plenty of time to get out. I did. I traded multiple movements on these
1285.44s: because again, like, even though I wasn't as involved in GameStop as I am now, I've been trading
1290.00s: a long time and I was trading this. So yeah, like you could still move around in here.
1297.60s: VisDesign says, GME to four figures in your opinion, not through a squeeze, I don't believe.
1303.60s: I don't believe that it will be permitted to run in a game of squeeze four figures plus.
1310.16s: I think that if it somehow changes as a fundamental business and we're talking like 35 years
1316.32s: down the road, sure, I think it could do that. I think it could do that if it really starts to grow
1323.04s: as an effective efficient business. But I don't think that again, I don't think the market is going
1328.40s: to permit a squeeze to that degree. I just, it's so disruptive for the rest of the financial system,
1336.00s: I think. Roy and Titi says it was demoralizing regardless of selling. There are diehards that won't
1342.48s: ever sell. I get that. Yeah, I get that. Roy and Titi says, why not HKD 1 to 2500? I'm not saying
1352.32s: it couldn't. Again, they just asked my opinion if I think it's going to. The reason why I don't
1356.56s: think it's going to is because there's so much new float that's been injected into the system.
1363.12s: And the market cap is now growing with how much cash they have. It starts to become more
1368.16s: difficult for that kind of manipulation to occur and then to be squeezed out like that.
1373.68s: I think one of the big things the ape community had going for a long time was having a pretty
1379.92s: significant amount of the float locked. But with the recent offerings, it's going to take a hot minute
1386.96s: for retail to slowly attempt to scoop up the new float and DRS hit and lock that. And it's a,
1396.00s: it's a pretty long process. So I have like genuinely it is completely possible. I just don't
1403.60s: think it's likely to answer their question more specifically. So yeah.
1411.60s: Long Swazie says at this point, I'm wondering how many shares treated each day or just created
1415.60s: liquidity no matter which stock, which is a fair question. That's a really fair question.
1420.88s: And I think it's one that most people, especially now, we have a, I mean, we literally have a
1428.00s: fucking right to ask stuff like that. Because again, the manipulation is very clear like you can see
1439.04s: it. And it's literally out in broad daylight. That's actually why I'm really, really stoked.
1446.48s: I don't know if any of you guys saw, but I had my boy,
1452.00s: lower on the Dave on the podcast not too long ago talking about
1459.12s: the fed manipulation game stop, that kind of stuff. And I'm actually really, really stoked with
1465.76s: what they're doing. And the reason why I'm stoked with what they're doing is because they're
1470.24s: actually starting to try and make a make a fight out of this. And that makes me super happy.
1478.32s: And it makes me happy because nobody else is really doing it at the level that they are.
1483.52s: And it takes a lot of time and effort to do this kind of thing, which is, you know, kind of how it
1489.76s: goes. So yeah, I think we have clear elements of manipulation. We can see it. It's there. But again,
1500.32s: there's a reality to things that Lawrence says I'd be curious to hear updates on how that's going,
1506.80s: is just starting. So I don't think that there's really going to be any big updates for a little bit.
1510.88s: The litigation process is going to take a long time. It's, and that's one of the ways that the
1517.28s: government weasels its way out of being pinned down by litigation is because since the government
1524.48s: essentially has unlimited budget to fight these kinds of things. It's not technically true, but
1530.64s: it's kind of practically true. So it lets them, it let's like, it lets them draw things out. Because
1541.44s: for people that are hiring counsel to pursue something, that all costs money and it costs money
1548.24s: over time. So yeah, one of the tactics that you'll find from government entities is to
1554.32s: specifically move very slow. And again, like it or like it or not, it's fucking smart. It's really
1560.80s: smart because they're essentially just waiting people out.
1564.16s: So,
1567.12s: cactus jacks is, did you ever see the interview with ib Petr Fee? I'd like to point out that we have
1571.84s: come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system? Yeah, definitely. That's exactly
1575.84s: one of the main things that I'm, I'm actually referencing when talking about this stuff is
1582.24s: he, he saw exactly what most of us can see, which is that there is a huge, huge, huge problem here.
1593.60s: So,
1603.84s: Jen, how close we were to this system breaking something failing? How close were we, Thomas?
1610.00s: We were frighteningly close on January 28th when we had 50 million registered shares
1619.12s: at the same time. We had 70 million shares short and 150 million shares short
1629.84s: via short coal options. So, you'd
1634.08s: love some short calls, eh? Yeah, no. And like you said, frighteningly close. So yeah, we were,
1643.84s: we were on the cusp. Absolutely on the cusp.
1650.08s: Um, all right, cool. So, let's take a look at, well, first, do we have any updates to our
1656.96s: eight map? We have less people here now. So, I'm, I'm concerned that the likelihood of us filling out
1663.20s: via Madagascar or Reunion or Moritas. That one's also viable. What's this one?
1673.12s: The third one.
1676.08s: Hurt Island in McDonald Islands, others, two of them.
1681.92s: Is that hurt Island? This one?
1687.68s: A lot of names.
1692.80s: All right. Looks like our map is up to date to my chagrin.
1696.56s: Uh, let's take a little bit of a look at GameStop where we sit today. So, we see a few things
1706.16s: going on right now at a high level. As we can tell, we, this, I haven't redrawing anything on
1713.68s: this for some time now. And we're very, very range bound. And it looks like perceived nominal value
1722.40s: at this point is like mid 20s. And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor
1729.28s: that it's been moving around within for some time now. So, it's very likely
1735.28s: the where this thing is starting to be accepted as a price level. Now, I find a couple things
1745.92s: interesting. One of which is if you take a look at the move of volatility, it is collapsing.
1755.52s: So if I move this out to a year, you can see obviously where we had that bit of a spike back in
1764.08s: May, absolutely skyrocketed. Short-term vol and it started sending 30-day vol very high.
1771.76s: And then essentially from those points, they've been steadily contracting with a couple
1776.56s: bumps along the way, but still very much a declining line here. And volatility is just being
1783.36s: pulled more and more out of here. So that's one of the biggest things that I see going on with GameStop
1790.08s: is the volatility has been contracting massively. If we take a look at the movements in the
1798.00s: both average true range, average day range, both of those are coming down massively. So if you look
1804.64s: at the 90-day average day range, 5.29% now it's at 2.88, almost half. So across the board, it just
1812.80s: tells us things are quieting down. Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think
1821.52s: it's at least worth while as a general data point. So taking a look at the options chain itself,
1831.44s: it has also gotten very quiet. So there's still a two-to-one relationship between puts and calls,
1838.48s: but overall volume is very, very light. And most of the OI at this point is actually out in 17 Jan
1846.00s: 25. So we're not seeing a bunch of these really near-term style options being thrown around
1852.32s: anymore, whereas before the front expiration is used to be really, really, really heavy. And that's
1858.32s: just not what we're seeing now, because you can even see after the 17 Jan expiration cycle,
1866.00s: the next largest on the call side at least is 15 NOV. So we're not seeing the same centralization
1873.68s: in the one NOV expiration cycle the eight NOV so far. So yeah.
1883.60s: Vladimir says, GME didn't close 22 or even once mid-20s are a far way off. Yes, sorry,
1890.96s: what I meant by that is mid-20s, like mid-20s, not mid-20 handle, but mid-$20, $50, $20, $60,
1903.04s: that's what I meant there. So, but back to the options, volatility is super low. So volatility
1914.40s: is collapsed pretty massively. It's not even, we don't even have anything over 100 now,
1919.36s: the next largest is an 8 NOV at 92% vol. And IV percentile, this uses IV rank,
1927.60s: but IV percentile is 13%. IV rank is 5 and 3 quarters. So, vol,
1934.80s: vol across the board just siphoned out very, very low.
1940.24s: Let's take a quick look and see if there is anything that came through from an interesting
1945.20s: order flow perspective. I didn't see much that caught my eye, but we'll take a peek.
1950.56s: DJT on the other hand has been crazy.
1956.40s: And let's look at
1960.64s: last seven days.
1965.60s: So, I mean, there's a little bit going on, but not a ton. And a lot of these are still
1972.96s: a little bit on the smaller side, as per what we've seen when things start getting really,
1978.32s: really active. So, that's what I'm seeing at a high level. As always, if there's anything in
1984.48s: particular that you guys want to take a peek at, let me know. But otherwise, we can pivot over to
1990.16s: the cats, the cats last series of trades and see if we can't pick up anything from there.
1999.92s: Anything that you guys came across, was there any interesting like DD that's popped up or anything
2003.76s: like that?
2017.12s: Sova. I'm not going to look at Sova yet. Maybe we'll take a look towards the end,
2022.80s: but I like keeping this more game stop focused. So, I'm going to stick on this.
2029.68s: Yolo Tweet. Oh, yeah, let's see.
2033.68s: Mm-mm.
2064.48s: Looking for...
2070.88s: Why is Cohen's accounts over defined?
2077.84s: Wait, Yolo Tweet, by who?
2082.32s: Okay, he got rid of it.
2091.04s: I saw this. That was hilarious.
2093.84s: He just seems to like to bother people.
2104.08s: Because he knows that this will piss some people off. What are the comments to this?
2114.32s: There it is.
2117.92s: What the fuck?
2124.24s: Let's see what the letterwork looks like. It looks good so far.
2144.88s: This looks like a solid tattoo.
2146.96s: That's a good artist.
2152.64s: The problem with red though is the red won't last. That's the downside.
2155.92s: The red starts to fade in. I have a little bit of red on this one.
2160.08s: It's still good, but it's faded in. This one has some white on it.
2165.36s: That is like essentially completely gone.
2168.00s: Wow, okay.
2188.16s: Dude, the comments in this are fucking crazy.
2191.52s: Okay.
2212.40s: Okay. I think we're good. That's entertaining enough.
2217.84s: All right, so let's see where we had left off here.
2226.64s: All right. So we had saw those series of trades leading into this that looked like he was kind
2233.68s: of like testing positions. Then I don't remember. It's been a while now.
2243.36s: What we thought the exit.
2252.00s: Ruin Titty says it's funny. His tweet was about Trump, but all everyone saw our tips.
2256.96s: Oh, you know, see like that. That's the kind of thing that you know.
2262.08s: Like what I mean is you know, you know Ryan Cohen specifically did that. You know that.
2269.12s: And again, the reason why I know that is because he makes it obvious enough that you can pick it
2275.04s: up, right? It's not like this insanely deep message that takes people years to figure out.
2283.12s: It's pretty superficial, pretty easy to pick up. So like if you look at the stuff that he tweets,
2290.16s: he's just a troll. He just likes to fuck around. And I've seen that. And that's again from that
2295.28s: same interview that we've watched a few times. I think we can see that there as well where the
2299.92s: dude just likes to fuck around. He likes to troll, which is hilarious to me. I enjoy it. I'm a big fan.
2309.68s: So for his for the cats, trades here. Wait, where did we? Is this all the way caught up?
2319.84s: 13 June. Okay. So we got through all of it.
2329.12s: And for the exit here, I think that there was a lot of debate whether or not
2339.44s: he exercised or not. I don't remember what the ending solution was.
2349.68s: Okay.
2359.04s: A vampire that says we're caught up. Seven know of hype date from Newton.
2366.88s: Well, I mean, I definitely hope that works. I don't really do the whole. I don't do the whole hype date thing.
2380.32s: But maybe.
2386.16s: Yes. So let's see what happened in here.
2388.32s: 567 54 20. So basis would be what 25?
2411.60s: 2567?
2419.12s: The empiricist says you put in the data, but then analyze the June ones. There we go. Thank you.
2424.80s: Okay. Yeah. Let's do that.
2434.48s: So we know that these went on between 10 and no, that's a lie. That's a big bold face lie.
2443.44s: We know that they went on between. Oh, I forgot. We don't know when they went on.
2448.64s: All right. Let's figure that out.
2456.96s: Let's get to the bond with that.
2462.08s: Um.
2467.12s: So sometime between 16 April and 2 June 24, that's not super useful. But prior to 2 June,
2473.76s: and I think we'll see them pretty easily. So if I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere around May.
2478.48s: Where most of these happen.
2485.28s: So let's go to
2491.36s: all of May.
2494.96s: I'm going to get rid of the puts. Yeah.
2499.60s: Yeah.
2503.52s: So these look like.
2510.40s: These look like him. What is this 10?
2530.00s: Okay. So first thing I'm going to do is just try to isolate the by 5,000 order blocks.
2538.64s: I'm not going to use the bid, mid or ask. I'm literally just going to count all of the 5,000 order blocks.
2545.92s: And so we need size to be minimum 5,000.
2549.44s: And I mean, we could just do some counting one.
2569.76s: These don't count. Yeah, I'm going to do the 20s as well.
2579.60s: As some says, what is the cat do all day long probably hangs out with this family and looks at the
2583.84s: markets like I do. I'd. A lot of us that are full-time.
2589.52s: Creators do the same do the same bit.
2594.08s: One, two, three.
2609.68s: So there's 25 total.
2622.00s: Which gets us to 125. So I had 120.
2631.60s: I wonder if he sold one of them.
2638.88s: Let's go through all these because this does generally look like it's all him.
2644.24s: And we'll sort this by time.
2649.52s: We'll start here.
2658.00s: I'm.
2667.76s: Time is 12, 49, 16.
2676.96s: Not worried about GME.
2680.72s: I'm going to move this to the end.
2687.52s: I'm.
2713.36s: I'm in India. I did the wrong thing.
2717.52s: I'm.
2731.68s: We got what is the Dorito thing?
2734.16s: I've heard people talk about this Dorito thing quite a lot and I don't know what it is.
2740.64s: And there is what 25 of these.
2742.48s: So two.
2743.52s: Oh, shit.
2747.68s: 20.
2762.16s: 20 May.
2770.40s: Well, 50 or seven.
2771.84s: And.
2776.80s: 2.3.
2782.88s: And this is in millions.
2790.00s: To keep it the same as the others.
2792.96s: Actually, now just go here.
2796.72s: 2.3 2.4 2.
2802.16s: 21 May.
2815.20s: 11, 59, 45.
2818.96s: These are standard time frames for bigger trades.
2822.16s: This is where you get slightly better liquidity.
2825.36s: So a lot of the trading that I do is in the last trading hour of the day.
2832.32s: You.
2840.32s: 2.5 2.4 8 2.75.
2848.72s: 2.88.
2852.32s: And then there's one two three four five six seven eight nine and 11 12 of these.
2861.68s: So.
2871.68s: So my dinner is about to get here super early.
2876.48s: So I think we have like another 20 minutes or so.
2882.08s: 0.8 52.37.

3212.00s: 21.
3216.00s: 2.
3220.00s: 4.
3224.00s: 12.
3226.00s: 21.
3230.00s: This follows his pattern.
3234.00s: This is the process of fingerprinting.
3238.00s: He's got a lot of things to figure out.
3242.00s: People's tendencies and behaviors.
3244.00s: And one of them that I can clearly see is he starts early
3248.00s: with a couple small stuff.
3250.00s: This is the other version that we looked at a while ago.
3254.00s: This one is that middle version that we kind of tested.
3258.00s: We were sort of curious about what we think might be him,
3262.00s: but not sure.
3264.00s: He's just confirming that what we just did here.
3268.00s: That's what this is up here.
3270.00s: But he's done this multiple times where we see him scaling in small
3274.00s: and then building building into the position.
3278.00s: And then this one we missed.
3284.00s: I don't know which one we left off of here.
3288.00s: How many are in this one?
3290.00s: So we have that.
3292.00s: Two, three.
3294.00s: Two.
3296.00s: So 21 may.
3298.00s: Is where.
3300.00s: We left it out of this version.
3304.00s: But I think this one was close to closer to netting out.
3310.00s: So we know what the residual basis was here for the position.
3314.00s: We did all that stuff.
3316.00s: So let's take a look.
3318.00s: I want to specifically.
3320.00s: Fun all on the unwind.
3322.00s: So between 10 and 13 June.
3326.00s: The first thing we can easily do is just go between.
3330.00s: 10.
3332.00s: And 14 June.
3346.00s: So I don't see size here.
3348.00s: That would indicate.
3352.00s: Yeah, no, I don't see size here that would indicate him exiting by selling.
3364.00s: My hunch.
3369.00s: Vladimir says, but depending on volume couldn't limit orders be broken into smaller blocks.
3374.00s: So I think that's what I mean.
3376.00s: Yeah, they can be.
3378.00s: But you can still aggregate them together.
3380.00s: So a lot of times.
3382.00s: Depending on what we're looking at, you'll actually see that.
3386.00s: With those little stacked figure that will be in between these.
3388.00s: It's like a little stacked icon.
3390.00s: That's pulling together multiple trades.
3392.00s: That then.
3396.00s: That are aggregated up, but they were individual positions.
3400.00s: So that's what I think here.
3408.00s: Would be that he would have sold.
3410.00s: I don't see them here.
3412.00s: But that's still my.
3414.00s: My guess is that he would have sold.
3418.00s: And the reason for that is because he still had enough time on these options.
3423.00s: Well, I mean, he definitely sold some of them.
3424.00s: We know he did.
3426.00s: And the reason why we know he did is because he didn't take on the full share allocation.
3429.00s: And so.
3431.00s: Not so sure.
3433.00s: Why that like that should be in here.
3435.00s: I actually don't know why it's not here at all, but it should be.
3439.00s: Let's do minimum size like a thousand.
3445.00s: Yeah, I mean, that's nowhere near enough.
3457.00s: And this still is nowhere near enough.
3461.00s: I have no explanation for that.
3469.00s: Other than I just don't trust the data that's here is the explanation I have.
3475.00s: The reason for that is.
3478.00s: Rowing to the says I don't think he sold.
3480.00s: But I mean, like we've we absolutely know he sold at least some of it.
3484.00s: Right.
3486.00s: So the way that we know the way that we know with certainty that he sold some of it is because if you do the math.
3496.00s: That's 120,000 calls.
3500.00s: Times a hundred, which would be.
3504.00s: One point what I'm going to show you on the calculator just so that you can see exit.
3510.00s: Well, I thought the calculator would rotate.
3513.00s: Calculators break them a balls right now.
3515.00s: It's.
3518.00s: Yeah.
3520.00s: So.
3523.00s: 120,000.
3526.00s: Options here.
3528.00s: Again, you have to move the decimal place over twice.
3531.00s: So he would be adding another 12 million shares.
3534.00s: And he doesn't do that, right?
3536.00s: Like I can clearly see he doesn't do that.
3539.00s: Because if we go to this, he's only adding what?
3544.00s: 4,000,000 or whatever it was 4,000,000.
3549.00s: Oh, no, this was the stocks split from before.
3553.00s: So the tricky part about this is I know for a fact.
3559.00s: Again, based on this, I can conclusively conclude.
3564.00s: That between 11, 12 and 13 June.
3570.00s: That there should be.
3573.00s: At the very least.
3575.00s: Most of this being sold.
3577.00s: Because he, if we take the hypothetical that he did exercise.
3582.00s: If we take that hypothetical, I can tell you he didn't exercise all of it.
3587.00s: And because he doesn't even have enough cash in the account to take all of it.
3593.00s: The other component here is he had access to 12 million.
3598.00s: And he took on 4,000,000,000.
3601.00s: So we've done this before, but we can take a look at what the basis of that is.
3609.00s: So then we have what is this 10 June?
3614.00s: 10 June, 24.
3619.00s: And then we have 13 June.
3625.00s: And then we have 5 million at 21, 274.
3637.00s: 21, 27, 4.
3642.00s: And then we have 9.1 or 9.001 at 23 4135.
3651.00s: 23 4135.
3657.00s: 23 4135.
3660.00s: And then now this is 9.001.
3671.00s: Literally thing I just copy the math.
3675.00s: Thank you.
3706.00s: I'm getting caught up on the on the chat.
3720.00s: Vladimir says the ball on those calls was 141 K on 12 and 13 combined.
3732.00s: That would sound right to me.
3734.00s: Yeah.
3735.00s: And I would expect the exit to occur over that time frame.
3738.00s: The tricky part is I just I'm struggling to see where the exits actually happened.
3744.00s: Because there's no way that he would have been exiting in sub $500 lots.
3752.00s: Right?
3753.00s: Like there's just no way.
3755.00s: So I don't understand.
3759.00s: Yeah, I just don't understand.
3762.00s: So this.
3768.00s: Yeah, I like why would there there's it would be so difficult to unwind that whole position in like 200 lot, 100 lot.
3783.00s: And I just don't see it.
3796.00s: But the corve rules this minus this divided by this.
3806.00s: 20, 609, which again I think we all, we've seen all these numbers before.
3814.00s: So on his option, his basis would have been.
3823.00s: What do we have?
3824.00s: It was 565.
3829.12s: His basis would have been 56754.
3834.64s: So the option was 56754.
3839.88s: And they were the 20s.
3841.64s: So the basis, if he exercised would be this,
3844.84s: plus this, 25674 is what is effective basis would be.
3854.00s: So this doesn't exactly line up, not massively far apart.
3864.00s: So it would be really difficult.
3867.00s: Magnum says, maybe he sold and exercised market maker internalized trade
3872.00s: again, why sitting around his cost basis.
3876.00s: No, because he wouldn't have the market maker out of
3884.00s: like the market maker, they can't change this.
3888.00s: They can internalize the order so it doesn't hit the tape,
3891.12s: but the value of it is still going to be at market value at that time.
3898.00s: So the market maker, if he exercised,
3904.00s: this is what the cost of the exercise,
3906.20s: this is what the basis would have been at, the delta basis,
3909.44s: which isn't here.
3914.00s: Off-putances remember that on 12 June,
3915.92s: GME shares declined 16.5% on the day he got out.
3921.00s: I think that's a different factor.
3927.00s: Because him exiting his options trade there wouldn't make
3931.00s: that kind of difference.
3937.00s: And it wasn't the, okay, you said the 12th.
3944.00s: Well, no, it wasn't the 12th.
3949.00s: Because the 12th was Saturday.
3952.00s: Did you mean the 11th off-puting?
3959.00s: No, off-put, I'm not saying exercising,
3962.00s: I'm not talking about whether, well,
3964.00s: it can be reflected in volume depending on where the shares are sourced from.
3968.00s: But that's not, yeah, that's not what I'm referring to anyways.
3974.00s: I'm confused now.
3979.00s: Royntady says, what was his cost basis?
3981.00s: Yeah, so his actual cost basis on based on the variance between these two,
3987.00s: the 10 June update and the 13 June update,
3990.00s: his basis would have been 2609 on what he added.
3994.00s: Now again, this is on average.
3996.00s: There is a world, and again, like this can be the case,
4000.00s: there is a world where he could have exercised a very small amount of his options
4005.00s: and then bought the rest on the market to create an average basis of 2609.
4011.00s: Off-puting says June 12 was Tuesday, not Saturday.
4014.00s: What?
4015.00s: Am I in the wrong month?
4017.00s: Oh, wait.
4020.00s: The impurities says bingo.
4021.00s: I don't think it's bingo because there's another reason I don't think he did that.
4025.00s: Oh, I'm in 21.
4026.00s: I was like, what the fuck is going on with this calendar?
4029.00s: I'm seeing pages you now, off-puting, sorry about that.
4033.00s: I was like, I was like, are we like missing days on this count?
4037.00s: I'm so suspective data now after doing a lot of this stuff.
4042.00s: Okay, so you said 12 June here, which is Wednesday.
4050.00s: So you still fucking lied to me, but we're still closer.
4053.00s: 12 June is Wednesday.
4055.00s: Rantitty says that says 2568, closing price of GME on 12 June is 2546.
4065.00s: No, so this, this shows if he exercised.
4071.00s: So if he exercised, this is what his basis, that's what this number here should be, if he exercised.
4081.00s: This represents the variance between the added cost and the added shares, not the variance.
4089.00s: It represents the variance between these two posts.
4093.00s: What was on 10 June, what was on 13 June, the delta between these.
4099.00s: So the change in his cost basis from 21274 to 234135
4108.00s: and by adding 4,000,000,000 shares, this is what his basis would be.
4116.00s: Lon Swaisy says does that include fees?
4119.00s: Fies don't come part of the basis.
4122.00s: So fees are assessed as a separate line item.
4126.00s: That's why on brokerage platforms, it'll actually show you like total commissions and fees as a line item.
4135.00s: So this is all encompassing whatever the platform tracks.
4143.00s: So Magnum says, didn't he have 20 options that he got dirt cheap premium and could exercise.
4152.00s: It's not so much about the premium being cheap.
4158.00s: He still would have left a massive amount of time value left in the options.
4163.00s: So we can take a look at an example of this together.
4166.00s: Let's go to 11 June.
4175.00s: Here.
4178.00s: 24.
4183.00s: June, which will 11.
4187.00s: Actually, you don't even have to go to 11.
4192.00s: Let's go to 13th when we know he got out.
4195.00s: This will be the.
4198.00s: This will be a better.
4201.00s: He says wasn't there only a week left.
4203.00s: There was only a week left.
4205.00s: But again, I'll show you what I mean.
4209.00s: This is the cool part of.
4213.00s: Options.
4215.00s: So let's go to 20 not 26 octets today's date.
4218.00s: I again, I'm an idiot.
4220.00s: So 13 June.
4223.00s: And.
4225.00s: Right now he has the what is it?
4228.00s: So let's go to 10 July.
4231.00s: 20 calls.
4234.00s: So let's take a look.
4238.00s: And I'll show you why I don't think he did exercise.
4251.00s: And Newton and I we had a long debate about this because Newton also thinks that he exercised.
4257.00s: But I think that's just because Newton doesn't fully understand options.
4262.00s: And he was the I think the thing Newton was doing there was pattern seeking, right?
4268.00s: It was confirmation bias.
4270.00s: He wanted them to exercise because of Newton's perception of what that would mean in terms
4275.00s: of creating like another wave potentially.
4278.00s: But I don't think mathematically it lines up again, just from calculating the residual basis.
4284.00s: We already see his basis would have to be on average 26 or nine.
4288.00s: But more importantly, let's take a look at his options.
4291.00s: Which were the 21 June's.
4295.00s: And he had the 20's.
4297.00s: So let's actually do the math here and let's not do the lazy back of the napkin way of doing this.
4304.00s: So right now game stop is trading at 28.
4309.00s: 5 6 9 9.
4315.00s: His 20 calls.
4322.00s: He has 20 calls.
4327.00s: Titi says could he have rolled his options? No.
4331.00s: He couldn't have because they would be here.
4334.00s: The fact that they're not here tells me he didn't roll them.
4343.00s: Right now his 20 calls are trading for $8.80 call it.
4358.00s: So now if we break this intrinsic versus extrinsic value.
4373.00s: Oh, because the vault so fucked up.
4375.00s: I don't even know what they would have classified it as.
4382.00s: Interesting.
4385.00s: So it's like 23 cents something like that.
4399.00s: So then.
4400.00s: If we have 23 cents on again, it wouldn't be the full.
4405.00s: Because again, we know that he didn't exercise all 120,000.
4410.00s: Right. That's again, it's just an objective fact.
4413.00s: Because he only added 4 million 1000 shares.
4420.00s: So for him to get to that.
4428.00s: He could have done 40,000 and 10.
4437.00s: This is what if we take the exercise scenario, this is what he would have exercised.
4442.00s: And the issue with this is this is his extrinsic value here.
4451.00s: I'll create some labels.
4456.00s: Intrinsic equals.
4464.00s: This minus this.
4468.00s: So this is his intrinsic value.
4475.00s: So this is going back to basic options.
4483.00s: And I can zoom this in a little bit to make it easier to see.
4495.00s: So he could have exercised up to 40,000 and 10.
4499.00s: If he did that.
4502.00s: This is this is what would have happened.
4509.00s: He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts.
4516.00s: And then he would essentially give up a million dollars.
4528.00s: Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up that he otherwise could collect.
4538.00s: By selling the option and then going to the open market.
4543.00s: So from two data points.
4549.00s: I don't believe he exercised.
4552.00s: The first one is because the basis here doesn't match up.
4558.00s: Again, if he exercised using this 40,000 and 10.
4564.00s: His additional basis would have had to have been 2609 and it wasn't.
4572.00s: So that's the first part.
4574.00s: The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars.
4583.00s: And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is not super concerned.
4587.00s: But I also don't think he's in the business of just throwing money away, which is literally what that is.
4592.00s: It's just throwing it away.
4594.00s: So I think that he wanted to monetize the calls before expiration.
4601.00s: And one of the few instances where he actually exited relatively early, most of the other periods he exited when the option still had like no time left.
4611.00s: So this is why I don't think he exercised his options.
4616.00s: And this is why I think that the math leads us towards him selling the options and then buying the shares on the market.
4627.00s: That's what I think.
4630.00s: Magnum says, well, he did end up giving up being a millionaire, a billionaire, but makes sense.
4635.00s: Yeah, exactly. He did give up being a billionaire.
4638.00s: That's hilarious, but it's wild that that is the case.
4642.00s: Did you imagine being a billionaire off of GameStop stock?
4645.00s: Like what a story that is incredible.
4649.00s: Absolutely incredible.
4652.00s: I mean, that looks pretty clear to me in terms of did he exercise or did he not?
4661.00s: And this to me overwhelmingly looks like he did not.
4666.00s: So interesting though, very, very interesting.
4671.00s: Anything else we should take a look at before we wrap up for those that are typically in the normal live streams.
4678.00s: I don't have any live streams slated for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
4684.00s: I'm doing a little bit of travel.
4687.00s: I need to go get my back looked at by a specialist.
4691.00s: So I'm actually flying to Florida to go do that.
4693.00s: So I will not be live streaming.
4696.00s: I might live stream on Tuesday because we might wrap early enough, but I would be live streaming on East Coast hours.
4704.00s: So I would probably be doing something at like 6 p.m.
4708.00s: Their time, which would be 3 p.m. Pacific time.
4711.00s: Something like that.
4712.00s: So that is the the near term game plan.
4715.00s: Now for tomorrow, I will be doing two different live streams.
4720.00s: I'm going to do a live stream again at like 1530.
4723.00s: That's going to be open for everybody.
4726.00s: And that one will be like the standard market outlook that I normally would do on Monday.
4732.00s: To kind of compensate for that.
4734.00s: And then I'll still have the outlier pro specific live stream at 1700.
4738.00s: We're going to be digging into specific trades and stuff like that.
4742.00s: So that's the game plan.
4747.00s: Roryntady says, is it for pro low therapy?
4750.00s: I don't even know what that is.
4752.00s: So I actually have no idea what that is.
4754.00s: What is pro low therapy?
4755.00s: But I'm not saying it wasn't a couple mill for the bigger picture kind of thing.
4760.00s: Was just a couple, but that's the thing is that it wasn't really.
4763.00s: It didn't cause like a bigger picture effect.
4765.00s: Unfortunately.
4766.00s: So.
4770.00s: I think the Roryntady says traveling for healthcare sucks.
4773.00s: We might have to take my mom to Colorado.
4775.00s: I'm actually in the opposite camp like I'm choosing to I'm for those that are in like I'm going to go see Brian Carroll.
4782.00s: He's the guy that co authored the gift of injury with Stuart McGill.
4787.00s: So I'm really fortunate in that I'm doing this.
4792.00s: It's completely all out of pocket for me, but I'm doing it because I think that he's the right guy for me to to go see and to have an assessment with and to create a game plan with.
4802.00s: Now for somebody like you, Roryntady, I feel for you there because that does suck.
4810.00s: Like if I had to drive 10 hours to go somewhere, that's a pain in the ass.
4815.00s: I feel for you there.
4817.00s: Roryntady says isn't that why everyone travels for medical potentially?
4823.00s: Yeah, I mean, that absolutely could be the case.
4826.00s: I'm not sure why most people do what they got to do.
4831.00s: They said that they got here, but I don't think they're here.
4836.00s: All right, gang, I'm going to go link up with this door dash driver.
4859.00s: I will see you guys in the discord.
4861.00s: Thank you for the positive energy.
4862.00s: If you've impured us and then I will catch you guys when I get back normal life schedule will resume on Thursday.
4869.00s: Be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier ape, whatever is most applicable and I'll catch you all later.
