771.06s:  both
772.16s:  so
775.36s:  companies
777.02s:  offer
777.98s:  as
778.82s:  people who like the stock even more than him that wouldn't go this route. There's a lot
784.38s:  of people who like the stock more than him that probably wouldn't have multiple 50% drawdowns
791.38s:  plus while being in the stock. So that's why the patience is surprising to me because
801.46s:  a lot of what he does from a trading perspective largely differs from the playbook of like rational
812.02s:  trader behavior. But again, this goes back into the broader point that this is, you could
817.90s:  tell like this was a yolo and he labeled it as such and he traded it as such. So I think
826.50s:  the reason why he's able to do this and deal with this kind of portfolio of altilities
830.90s:  because this isn't his entire portfolio. I don't believe I think there's a little bit more to it.
838.34s:  SM says seems like a lot of false alarms. Okay, when you say false alarms, is that people doing
844.10s:  like the date calling thing? I've never fully understood that yet. But is that what you mean by
849.46s:  false alarms? Roaring Titty says a lot of people got really wrecked when Robin Hood took away the
855.70s:  buy button. I don't understand that to be honest. I don't understand how Robin Hood taking the
861.22s:  buy button away and other brokerages taking the buy button away like wrecked people because you can
866.74s:  still sell. You can still get out. So I understand that that means that the stock didn't keep going up
875.62s:  parabolicly. But that goes back to the thing that I've talked with Newton about and I've also talked
882.18s:  with Peruvian Bull about where the like again, like this is why I don't fully understand that the
892.34s:  angle sometimes because Roaring Titty says a lot of brokers went down retail couldn't do anything for
900.50s:  a time. Is that is that accurate? Like they couldn't sell either because that actually would be
909.78s:  very surprising to me. Now if it was frozen, limit up, limit down, then yeah, you'd have to catch it
915.94s:  outside of the lock periods. But from what I saw, there was still order flow happening.
930.50s:  Yeah, Jimmy says it made people lose faith in retail trading, I think. I don't know. I just,
937.62s:  it surprises me so much. The reason why it surprises me so much is because I don't understand how
946.74s:  anybody in their rational mind would expect any stock, not GameStop, but any stock to go up into
956.50s:  essentially to a point where it could collapse the financial system. I'm not saying that the conditions
964.18s:  being set, leading to that as a possible outcome irrational, they're not. That's from a bunch of
969.30s:  bullshit. Completely agree. No debate. But I think it's interesting to me when something that
976.74s:  Cleary hasn't had a big change in fundamental value goes up over, you know, to over 400 bucks
983.86s:  for multiple days and then to just kind of sit there and hold it, right? Because if I'm not
991.54s:  mistaken, it hung up in like the multiple hundreds for a few days. Let me make sure I'm not
997.94s:  way off base. Does trading view do like pre-adjusted split basis or whatever?
1011.86s:  It doesn't look like it. It looks like it does split adjusted. Yeah, because it was over
1021.54s:  400 back here. Lauren says the fact that a stock going up could wreck the financial system is
1032.34s:  a little problem in my opinion. It's a huge problem. The fact that that's a thing and the fact that
1039.70s:  that was the case here is insane. And this is literally one of the shining examples of broad
1047.14s:  manipulation, like 100% broad manipulation. And the fact that this was at such a severe range
1057.30s:  is crazy to me that it was even allowed to be like, how can something be multiple hundreds
1064.10s:  percent short? There's only so many fucking shares. So like that stuff is so frustrating. And again,
1072.90s:  I completely agree with like those components. But again, it's so important to decouple
1079.86s:  frustrations, preferences, what we wish reality was from what reality is. And the fact that this
1089.46s:  shouldn't have been multiple 100% shorted and even in a position to be able to go up to 400 plus.
1097.38s:  That can only happen from a systemic manipulation that's being caught in unwound. So
1103.70s:  love that because I would love for those people to get wrecked. But to still again, from the practical
1111.14s:  side of things, to not exit your position on the 27th, the 28th, the 29th, the first.
1120.98s:  Like that's a that's a solid four day window to GTFO, take profits, and then wait for another run
1132.90s:  to get back in. So that's just the part that I don't understand. Like I get that this movement
1142.50s:  didn't materialize as far as it theoretically could have. We know that for sure.
1147.70s:  But we also know again, pretty reasonably that we're not going to allow the financial system to
1154.10s:  collapse because of this issue. Again, we have to like we have to partition these things. Because
1160.90s:  in my opinion, if there's the intervention to prevent the collapse, then those who are
1167.30s:  systemically on the wrong side of this trade, they should go out of fucking business. And they
1171.46s:  should have to pay. Like I literally think they should go bankrupt. But that's a that's a again,
1176.26s:  that's like another part of the broader partitioning mentality that I go through. But like if this
1182.26s:  goes into a total financial collapse, then nobody makes money anyways. The stock market collapsed.
1189.30s:  So it's like I just I don't understand the broader the broader expectation there. It's from as you
1196.90s:  could tell from a trading perspective, it baffles me. But from a systematic perspective, it shows that
1203.54s:  we have massive problems, massive problems. And they're still here. That's the other frustrating
1208.66s:  part about this is that I am also in the camp that I don't really think that everybody's unwound
1217.70s:  that should have unwound. That's what I think.
1222.34s:  Of Roentit, he says they changed the rule when retail starts to fuck up their money,
1226.74s:  which is largely profiting off of us. In this case, I agree with you.
1232.74s:  I fully agree with you. Again, I think that this is a is a prime example of a problem of literally
1241.22s:  a big problem. So yeah, I completely completely agree with that.
1251.22s:  Magnum says those investing click the buy cell blaming the buy button off is like blaming
1256.74s:  gun doing during a shooting incident. Yeah, it is kind of like that, I think that the main thing is
1263.54s:  again, I just I don't think anybody has a good argument that the buy button being turned off hurt
1269.06s:  them is all it can frustrate them. We could have thought something should have gone further.
1273.54s:  Like all of those are completely completely viable points. But there was plenty of time to unwind
1280.10s:  here, like plenty of time to get out. I did. I traded multiple movements on these because again,
1286.58s:  even though I wasn't as involved in GameStop as I am now, I've been trading a long time.
1291.54s:  And I was trading this. So yeah, like you could still move around in here.
1297.62s:  VisDesign says, GM me to four figures in your opinion, not through a squeeze, I don't believe.
1303.62s:  I don't believe that it will be permitted to run in a game of squeeze, four figures plus.
1310.18s:  I think that if it somehow changes as a fundamental business and we're talking like 35 years
1316.34s:  down the road, sure, I think it could do that. I think it could do that if it really starts to grow
1323.06s:  as an effective efficient business. But I don't think that again, I don't think the market is going
1328.42s:  to permit a squeeze to that degree. I just it's so disruptive for the rest of the financial system,
1336.02s:  I think. Roy and Titi says it was demoralizing regardless of selling. There are diehards that won't
1342.42s:  ever sell. I get that. Yeah, I get that. Roy and Titi says, why not HKD 1 to 2500? I'm not saying
1352.34s:  it couldn't. Again, they just asked my opinion if I think it's going to. The reason why I don't
1356.58s:  think it's going to is because there's so much new float that's been injected into the system.
1363.14s:  And the market cap is now growing with how much cash they have. It starts to become more
1368.18s:  difficult for that kind of manipulation to occur and then to be squeezed out like that.
1374.02s:  I think one of the big things the ape community had going for a long time was having a pretty
1379.94s:  significant amount of the float locked. But with the recent offerings, it's going to take a hot minute
1386.98s:  for retail to slowly attempt to scoop up the new float and DRS hit and lock that. And it's a
1396.26s:  pretty long process. So I have like genuinely it is completely possible. I just don't think it's
1404.02s:  likely to answer their question more specifically. So yeah, Lon Swasey says at this point, I'm wondering
1413.46s:  how many shares traded each day or just created liquidity no matter which stock, which is a fair
1418.26s:  question. That's a really fair question. And I think it's one that most people, especially now,
1425.62s:  we have a, I mean, we literally have a fucking right to ask stuff like that. Because again,
1432.98s:  the manipulation is very clear like you can see it. And it's literally out in broad daylight.
1444.34s:  That's actually why I'm really, really stoked. I don't know if any of you guys saw, but I had my
1449.86s:  boy, lower on the Dave on the podcast not too long ago talking about the fed manipulation
1460.98s:  game stop, that kind of stuff. And I'm actually really, really stoked with what they're doing.
1466.98s:  And the reason why I'm stoked with what they're doing is because they're actually starting
1471.86s:  to try and make a make a fight out of this. And that makes me super happy.
1478.26s:  And it makes me happy because nobody else is really doing it at the level that they are.
1483.46s:  And it takes a lot of time and effort to do this kind of thing, which is, you know, kind of how it
1489.78s:  goes. So yeah, I think we have clear elements of manipulation. We can see it. It's there.
1499.46s:  But again, there's a reality to things that Lawrence says I'd be curious to hear updates on how
1506.42s:  that's going is just starting. So I don't think that there's really going to be any big updates for
1510.10s:  a little bit. The litigation process is going to take a long time. It's, and that's one of the ways
1516.82s:  that the government weasels its way out of being pinned down by litigation is because since the
1524.10s:  government essentially has unlimited budget to fight these kinds of things. It's not technically true,
1530.34s:  but it's kind of practically true. So it lets them, it lets them draw things out because for people
1541.94s:  that are hiring counsel to pursue something, that all costs money and it costs money over time.
1549.30s:  So yeah, one of the tactics that you'll find from government entities is to specifically move
1555.54s:  very slow. And again, like it or like it or not, it's fucking smart. It's really smart because
1562.02s:  they're essentially just waiting people out.
1567.14s:  Cactus Jackson, did you ever see the interview with IB Petter Fee? I'd like to point out that we
1571.78s:  have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system? Yeah, definitely. That's exactly
1575.86s:  one of the main things that I'm actually referencing when talking about this stuff is he saw
1585.14s:  exactly what most of us can see, which is that there is a huge, huge, huge problem here.
1592.90s:  How close we were to this system breaking something failing? How close were we Thomas?
1610.02s:  We were frighteningly close on January 28th when we had 50 million registered chairs
1619.14s:  at the same time. We had 70 million shares short and 150 million shares short
1629.86s:  via short coal options. So you'd love some short calls, eh? Yeah, no. And like you said, frighteningly close.
1641.22s:  So yeah, we were on the cusp. Absolutely on the cusp.
1652.02s:  All right, cool. So let's take a look at, well, first, do we have any updates to our
1656.90s:  8MAP? We have less people here now. So I'm concerned that the likelihood of us filling out
1663.22s:  via Madagascar or reunion or mortis. That one's also viable. What's this one?
1675.06s:  Herd Island in McDonald Islands. Others, two of them.
1682.66s:  Is that herd island? This one? A lot of names.
1692.82s:  All right, looks like our map is up to date to my chagrin.
1697.46s:  Let's take a little bit of a look at GameStop where we sit today. So we see a few things going on
1706.74s:  right now at a high level. As we can tell, we, this, I haven't redrawed anything on this for some
1714.82s:  time now. And we're very, very range bound. And it looks like perceived nominal value at this point
1723.14s:  is like mid 20s. And that's just because this is kind of like a new floor that it's been moving
1730.18s:  around within for some time now. So it's very likely the where this thing is starting to be
1738.42s:  accepted as a price level. Now, I find a couple things interesting. One of which is if you take a
1748.66s:  look at the move of volatility, it is collapsing. So if I move this out to a year, you can see obviously
1761.22s:  where we had that bit of a spike back in May, absolutely skyrocketed short-term vol and it started
1768.74s:  sending 30 day vol very high. And then essentially from those points, they've been steadily
1775.38s:  contracting with a couple bumps along the way, but still very much a declining line here. And
1781.54s:  volatility is just being pulled more and more out of here. So that's one of the biggest things that
1787.70s:  I see going on with GameStop is the volatility has been contracting massively. If we take a look at
1795.62s:  the movements in the at both average true range average day range, both of those are coming down
1803.06s:  massively. So if you look at the 90 day average day range, 5.29% now it's at 2.88, almost half.
1811.22s:  So across the board, it just tells us things are quieting down.
1814.58s:  Again, I don't think that's any shock to anybody, but I think it's at least worth while as a
1824.42s:  general data point. So taking a look at the options chain itself, it has also gotten very quiet.
1834.82s:  So there's still a two to one relationship between puts and calls, but overall volume is very,
1840.34s:  very light. And most of the oh, I at this point is actually out in 17 Jan 25. So we're not seeing a
1848.02s:  bunch of these really near term style options being thrown around anymore, whereas before the
1854.34s:  front expirations used to be really, really, really heavy. And that's just not what we're seeing now
1859.38s:  because you can even see after the 17 Jan expiration cycle, the next largest on the call side at
1868.18s:  least is 15. So we're not seeing the same centralization and like the one note of expiration cycle,
1875.94s:  the eight know so far. So yeah.
1883.62s:  Vladimir says, GME didn't close 22 or even once mid 20s are a far way off. Yes, sorry. What I
1891.22s:  meant by that is like mid 20s, like mid 20s, not mid 20 handle, but mid $20, 50 cents, $20, 60 cents.
1902.98s:  That's what I meant there. So
1907.22s:  but back to the options. Volatility is super low. So volatility is collapse pretty massively.
1916.90s:  It's not even we don't even have anything over 100 now. The next largest is an eight know of it, 92%
1922.02s:  vol. And IV percentile, this use I've uses IV rank, but IV percentiles 13% IV rank is five and three
1931.78s:  quarters. So vol, vol across the board just siphoned out very, very low. Let's take a quick look and
1942.02s:  see if there is anything that came through from an interesting order flow perspective. I didn't
1946.90s:  see much that caught my eye, but we'll take a peek. DJT on the other hand has been crazy.
1956.42s:  And let's look at
1958.66s:  that
1960.66s:  last seven days.
1965.54s:  So I mean, there's a little bit going on, but not a ton. And a lot of these are still a little
1973.30s:  bit on the smaller side as pretty like what we've seen when things start getting really, really active.
1980.18s:  So that's what I'm seeing at a high level. As always, if there's anything in particular that you
1985.14s:  guys want to take a peek at, let me know. But otherwise we can pivot over to the cats,
1992.10s:  the cats last series of trades and see if we can't pick up anything from there.
1999.86s:  Anything that you guys came across? Was there any interesting like DD that's popped up or anything
2003.70s:  like that?
2016.10s:  Sova. I'm not going to look at Sova yet. Maybe we'll take a look towards the end,
2022.82s:  but I like keeping this more game stop focused. So I'm going to stick on this.
2029.62s:  Yolo Tweet. Oh, yeah, let's see.
2045.14s:  Sova.
2067.38s:  Looking for.
2070.90s:  Why is Cohen's accounts over defined?
2075.86s:  Wait, Yolo Tweet by who?
2082.34s:  Okay, he got rid of it.
2090.98s:  I saw this. That was hilarious.
2098.34s:  He just seems to like to bother people.
2101.46s:  Because he knows that this will piss some people off. What are the comments to this?
2114.42s:  There it is.
2117.94s:  What the fuck?
2131.62s:  Let's see what the letterwork looks like. It looks good so far.
2144.90s:  This looks like a solid tattoo.
2149.86s:  That's a good artist.
2152.58s:  The problem with red though is the red won't last. That's the downside. The red starts to fade in.
2157.30s:  I have a little bit of red on this one. It's still good, but it's faded in.
2162.18s:  This one has some white on it. That is like essentially completely gone.
2175.06s:  Wow, okay.
2188.10s:  Dude, the comments in this are fucking crazy.
2197.46s:  Okay.
2206.42s:  Okay. I think we're good. That's entertaining enough.
2217.86s:  All right. So let's see where we had left off here.
2226.66s:  All right. So we had saw those series of trades leading into this that looked like he was
2233.54s:  kind of like testing positions. And then I don't remember. It's been a while now.
2243.38s:  What we thought the exit.
2251.94s:  Rowan Titty says it's funny. His tweet was about Trump, but all everyone saw were tips.
2257.14s:  Oh, you know. See, that's the kind of thing that you know.
2262.10s:  Like what I mean is you know, you know Ryan Cohen specifically did that. You know that.
2269.14s:  And again, the reason why I know that is because he makes it obvious enough that you can pick it
2275.06s:  up, right? It's not like this insanely deep message that takes people years to figure out.
2283.14s:  It's pretty superficial, pretty easy to pick up. So like if you look at the stuff that he tweets,
2290.18s:  he's just a troll. He just likes to fuck around. And I've seen that. And that's again,
2294.90s:  from that same interview that we've watched a few times. I think we can see that there as well.
2299.54s:  Where the dude just likes to fuck around. He likes to troll, which is hilarious to me. I enjoy it.
2307.06s:  I'm a big fan. So for his, for the cats, trades here, wait, where did we,
2318.26s:  is this all the way caught up?
2321.86s:  13 June. Okay. So we got through all of it.
2329.14s:  And
2333.78s:  where the exit here, I think that there was a lot of debate whether or not he
2340.10s:  exercised or not. I don't remember what the ending solution was.
2348.58s:  Vampirita says we're caught up. Seven know of hype date from Newton.
2367.38s:  I mean, I definitely hope that works. I don't really, I don't really do the whole,
2374.42s:  I don't do the whole hype date thing. But maybe.
2386.18s:  Yes, so let's see what happened in here.
2388.34s:  567 54 20. So basis would be what 25?
2411.62s:  2567?
2419.06s:  So the
2421.06s:  Vampirita says you put in the data, but then analyze the June ones. There we go. Thank you. Okay.
2425.78s:  Yeah, let's do that.
2434.50s:  So we know that these went on between 10 and no, that's a lie. That's a big bold face lie.
2443.38s:  We know that they went on between, oh, I forgot. We don't know when they went on.
2448.66s:  All right, let's figure that out. Let's get to the bond with that.
2462.10s:  Um,
2467.14s:  so sometime between 16 April and 2 June 24, that's not super useful. But prior to 2 June,
2473.78s:  and I think we'll see them pretty easily. So if I'm not mistaken, it's somewhere around May.
2478.50s:  Where most of these happen.
2485.30s:  So let's go to
2491.30s:  all of May.
2494.90s:  I'm going to get rid of the puts. Yeah.
2499.62s:  Yeah.
2503.54s:  So these look like
2510.42s:  these look like him. What is this 10?
2529.94s:  Okay. So first thing I'm going to do is just try to isolate the by 5,000 order blocks.
2538.66s:  I'm not going to use the bid, mid or ask. I'm literally just going to count all of the 5,000 order blocks.
2545.94s:  And so we need size to be minimum 5,000.
2549.46s:  And I mean, we could just do some counting one.
2569.70s:  These don't count. Yeah, I'm going to do the 20s as well.
2579.62s:  As some says, what is the cat do all day long? Probably hangs out with this family and looks at the
2583.78s:  markets like I do. I'd
2587.22s:  a lot of us that are full-time
2589.46s:  graders do the same do the same bit.
2594.10s:  One, two, three.
2609.70s:  So there's 25 total.
2622.02s:  Which gets us to 125. So he had 120.
2631.62s:  I wonder if he sold one of them.
2638.90s:  Let's go through all these because this does generally look like it's all him.
2644.26s:  And we'll sort this by time.
2649.46s:  And we'll start here.
2657.94s:  I'm going to move this to the end.
2687.94s:  I'm in India. I did the wrong thing.
2718.42s:  Oh.
2730.66s:  Uh, we got what is the Dorito thing? I've heard people talk about this Dorito thing quite a lot.
2737.30s:  And I don't know what it is.
2740.66s:  And there is what 25 of these. So two. Oh shit.
2748.66s:  So
2754.38s:  we picked 20.
2763.62s:  Twenty-Ey
2771.62s:  Well 50 seven.
2777.94s:  And this is in millions.
2784.94s:  To keep it the same as the others, actually, no, just go here.
2796.94s:  2.3, 2.4, 2.
2799.94s:  2.
2804.94s:  2.
2806.94s:  2.
2809.94s:  2.
2814.94s:  2.
2818.94s:  2.
2821.94s:  2.
2824.94s:  2.
2827.94s:  Last trading hour of the day.
2834.94s:  2.5, 2.4, 8, 2.75, 2.88.
2851.94s:  And then there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 of these.
2870.94s:  And my dinner is about to get here super early.
2875.94s:  So I think we have another 20 minutes or so.
2880.94s:  0, 8, 52, 37, 0, 9, 0, 4, 54, 0, 9, 18, 58, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0, 8,
2898.94s:  58, 0, 9, 56, 43,
2911.94s:  and 26, 36, 11, 15, 53,
2922.94s:  11, 28, 29, 11, 32, 33,
2933.94s:  11, 38, 49, 12,
2943.94s:  both three, 45, 12, 52,
2950.94s:  29,
2954.94s:  and 2.5,
2959.94s:  2.5,
2964.94s:  2.7,
2967.94s:  2.93, 2.9, 3.1,
2973.94s:  3.13, 3.35,
2977.94s:  2.3, 2.38,
2984.94s:  OK, 24,
2989.94s:  4,
2995.94s:  11, 0, 9,
2998.94s:  49,
3004.94s:  11,
3006.94s:  49,
3008.94s:  39,
3010.94s:  1.68,
3017.94s:  1.75,
3022.94s:  28,
3025.94s:  28,
3028.94s:  9, 21, 28,
3032.94s:  12, 40, 26,
3039.94s:  4.13,
3042.94s:  3.2,
3046.94s:  39,
3050.94s:  30,
3054.94s:  30,
3058.94s:  30,
3062.94s:  30,
3066.94s:  30,
3070.94s:  30,
3075.94s:  39,
3077.94s:  2.75,
3081.94s:  30,
3083.94s:  and 31,
3087.94s:  12, 59,
3089.94s:  39, 12, 54,
3093.94s:  24, 2.6,
3096.94s:  2.8,
3099.94s:  So one of these,
3103.94s:  I don't think is him,
3107.94s:  because there's an extra one.
3111.94s:  So the total here is 69,
3115.94s:  36,
3122.94s:  his cost,
3126.94s:  I guess I could use them.
3128.94s:  So I think it's a little bit more
3132.94s:  expensive than the one I used to do.
3136.94s:  So I think it's 65,
3140.94s:  65,
3144.94s:  75,
3148.94s:  but it's very close.
3152.94s:  I'm trying to see if any of these are like clearly.
3156.94s:  I think I messed that one up.
3160.94s:  No, it's not.
3170.94s:  So I'm not really super concerned
3174.94s:  about where the 5,000 is or where the extra five is.
3178.94s:  I mean,
3180.94s:  there's a couple that look slightly different to me,
3184.94s:  but I'm actually not quite that much.
3190.94s:  I'm getting hit up by my door dash.
3196.94s:  They said that we got like a half hour.
3202.94s:  So we got plenty of time.
3206.94s:  So
3210.94s:  the 21st
3214.94s:  two trades,
3218.94s:  four trades.
3222.94s:  This was 12,
3226.94s:  2, 2, 1, 1, 1.
3228.94s:  This clearly follows his pattern.
3230.94s:  Again, this is the process of fingerprinting.
3234.94s:  You can pretty clearly start to figure out
3238.94s:  people's tendencies and behaviors.
3242.94s:  And one of them that I can clearly see is he starts early
3246.94s:  with a couple small stuff.
3248.94s:  Like this is the other version that we looked at a while ago.
3252.94s:  This one is that middle version that we kind of tested.
3256.94s:  We were sort of curious about what we think might be him,
3260.94s:  but not sure.
3262.94s:  So this is just confirming that what we just did here.
3266.94s:  That's what this is up here.
3268.94s:  But he's done this multiple times where we see him scaling in small
3272.94s:  and then building building into the position.
3276.94s:  And then this one we missed.
3282.94s:  I don't know which one we left off of here.
3286.94s:  How many are in this one?
3290.94s:  So we have that two, three.
3294.94s:  So 21 May is where we left it out of this version.
3302.94s:  But I think this one was close to,
3306.94s:  closer to netting out.
3310.94s:  So we know what the residual basis was here for the position.
3314.94s:  We did all that stuff.
3316.94s:  So let's take a look.
3318.94s:  I want to specifically.
3320.94s:  Fun all on the unwind between 10 and 13 June.
3324.94s:  So the first thing we can easily do is just go between 10 and 14 June.
3346.94s:  So I don't see size here that would indicate.
3352.94s:  Yeah, no, I don't see size here that would indicate him exiting by selling.
3362.94s:  My hunch.
3368.94s:  Vladimir says, but depending on volume couldn't limit orders be broken into smaller blocks.
3372.94s:  That happens to me. Yeah, they can be.
3374.94s:  But you can still aggregate them together.
3378.94s:  So a lot of times, depending on what we're looking at,
3382.94s:  you'll actually see that with those little stacked figure that will be in between these.
3386.94s:  It's like a little stacked icon.
3388.94s:  That's pulling together multiple trades that then.
3394.94s:  That are aggregated up, but they were individual positions.
3398.94s:  Because my instinct here.
3402.94s:  Would be that he would have sold.
3405.94s:  I don't see them here.
3407.94s:  But that's still my.
3409.94s:  My guess is that he would have sold.
3414.94s:  And the reason for that is because he still had enough time on these options.
3419.94s:  Well, I mean, he definitely sold some of them. We know he did.
3422.94s:  And the reason why we know he did is because he didn't take on the full share allocation.
3427.94s:  So.
3429.94s:  Not so sure.
3431.94s:  Why that like that should be in here.
3434.94s:  I actually don't know why it's not here at all, but it should be.
3438.94s:  Let's do minimum size like a thousand.
3443.94s:  Yeah, I mean, that's nowhere near enough.
3457.94s:  And this still is nowhere near enough.
3461.94s:  I have no explanation for that.
3468.94s:  Other than I just don't trust the data that's here is the explanation I have.
3475.94s:  The reason for that is.
3477.94s:  Roryntady says I don't think he sold.
3479.94s:  But I mean, like we we absolutely know he sold at least some of it.
3484.94s:  Right.
3485.94s:  So the way that we know the way that we know with certainty that he sold some of it is because if you do the math.
3495.94s:  That's 120,000 calls.
3499.94s:  Times a hundred, which would be.
3503.94s:  One point what I'm going to show you on the calculator just so that you can see exactly.
3509.94s:  Well, I thought the calculator would rotate.
3512.94s:  Calculators break them a balls right now.
3514.94s:  So it's.
3517.94s:  Yeah.
3519.94s:  So.
3522.94s:  120,000.
3525.94s:  Options here.
3527.94s:  Again, you have to move the decimal place over twice.
3530.94s:  So he would be adding another 12 million shares.
3534.94s:  And he doesn't do that. Right.
3536.94s:  Like I can clearly see he doesn't do that.
3538.94s:  Because if we go to this.
3540.94s:  And he's only adding what for four million 1000 or whatever it was four million.
3548.94s:  2000.
3549.94s:  Oh no, this was the stock split from before.
3552.94s:  So the tricky part about this is I know for a fact.
3558.94s:  Again, based on this, I can conclusively conclude.
3563.94s:  That between 11, 12 and 13 June.
3569.94s:  That there should be.
3572.94s:  At the very least.
3574.94s:  Most of this being sold.
3576.94s:  Because he, if we take the hypothetical that he did exercise.
3581.94s:  If we take that hypothetical, I can tell you he didn't exercise all of it.
3586.94s:  And because he doesn't even have enough cash in the account to take all of it.
3592.94s:  The other component here is he had access to 12 million.
3597.94s:  And he took on four million 1000.
3600.94s:  So we've done this before, but we can take a look at what the the basis of that is.
3608.94s:  So then we have what is this 10 June.
3614.94s:  10 June.
3616.94s:  24.
3618.94s:  And then we have 13 June.
3624.94s:  And then we have 5 million at 21.
3629.94s:  274.
3636.94s:  21 274.
3641.94s:  And then we have 9.1 or 9.001 at 23 4135.
3651.94s:  23 4135.
3653.94s:  23 4135.
3658.94s:  And then now this is 9 0 0 1.
3670.94s:  And literally thing I just copy the math.
3673.94s:  Oh no, I can't.
3700.94s:  I'm getting caught up on the on the chat.
3723.94s:  So the last time, I saw that a lot of the top 10, that was 111 K on 12 and 13 combined.
3732.94s:  That would sound right to me.
3735.94s:  Yeah, and I would expect the exit to occur over that time frame.
3739.94s:  The tricky part is, I just I'm struggling to see where the exits actually happened.
3746.94s:  Because there's no way that he would have been exiting in sub $500 lots, right?
3752.94s:  just no way. So I don't understand, yeah, I just don't understand. So this, yeah, I,
3769.50s:  like, why would there, there's, it would be so difficult to unwind that whole position
3776.54s:  in like 200 lot, 100 lot elements like I just, I just don't see it.
3789.90s:  equals this minus this divided by this, 26 or nine, which again, I think we all, we've seen all
3808.86s:  these numbers before. So on his options, his basis would have been, what do we have? It was 565.
3825.10s:  His basis would have been 56754. So the option was 56754 and they were the 20s. So the basis, if he
3843.10s:  exercise would be this plus this 25674 is what is effective basis would be. So
3859.18s:  this doesn't exactly line up, not massively far apart, so it would be really difficult.
3866.70s:  Magnum says maybe he sold and exercise market maker internalized trade again, why sitting around his
3873.26s:  cost basis. No, because he wouldn't have the market maker out of like the market maker, they can't
3885.90s:  change this, right? They can, they can internalize the order so it doesn't hit the tape, but the value of
3892.06s:  it is still going to be at market value at that time. So the like the market maker, if he, like,
3902.78s:  if he exercised, this is what the cost of the exercise, this is what the basis would have been at,
3907.66s:  the Delta basis, which isn't here. Off-put and says remember that on 12 June, GME shares to
3916.62s:  clients 16.5% on the day he got out. I think that's a different factor,
3926.78s:  because him exiting his options trade there wouldn't make that kind of difference.
3937.18s:  And it wasn't the, okay, you said the 12th.
3939.58s:  Well, no, it wasn't the 12th, because the 12th was Saturday. Did you mean the 11th off-put?
3959.42s:  No, off-put, I'm not saying exercising, I'm not talking about whether, well, it can be
3964.86s:  reflected in volume depending on where the shares are sourced from. But that's not, yeah, that's
3971.18s:  not what I'm referring to anyways. I'm confused now. Rointit, he says, what was his cost basis? Yeah,
3981.58s:  so his actual cost basis on based on the variance between these two, the 10 June update and the 13 June
3989.02s:  update. His basis would have been 2609 on what he added. Now again, this is on average.
3996.78s:  There is a world, and again, like this can be the case, there is a world where he could have
4002.22s:  exercised a very small amount of his options and then bought the rest on the market to create an
4007.50s:  average basis of 2609. Off-put and says June 12 was Tuesday, not Saturday. What? Am I in the wrong month?
4017.26s:  Wait, the empiricist is bingo. I don't think it's bingo because there's another reason I don't
4023.10s:  think he did that. Oh, I'm in 21. I was like, what the fuck is going on with this calendar? I'm
4029.98s:  same page as you now. Off-put and sorry about that. I was like, are we like missing days on this
4037.02s:  count? I'm so suspective data now after doing a lot of this stuff. Okay, so you said 12 June,
4046.78s:  here, which is Wednesday. So you still fucking lied to me, but we're still closer. 12 June is Wednesday.
4056.06s:  Rantitty says that says 2568 closing price of GME on 12 June is 2546. No, so this, this shows if he
4069.82s:  exercised. So if he exercised, this is what his basis, that's what this number here should be.
4078.38s:  If he exercised, this represents the variance between the added cost and the added shares. Not
4088.46s:  the variance, it represents the variance between these two posts. What was on 10 June? What was on 13
4096.22s:  June? The delta between these. So the change in his cost basis from 21274 to 234135 and by adding 4
4109.10s:  million 1000 shares, this is what his basis would be. Lon Swaisy says does that include fees? Fee's
4119.34s:  don't come part of the basis. So fees are assessed as a separate line item. That's why on brokerage
4127.98s:  platforms, it'll actually show you like total commissions and fees as a line item. So this is
4137.50s:  all encompassing whatever the platform tracks. So Magnum says, didn't he have 20 options that he got
4148.38s:  dirt cheap premium and could exercise? It's not so much about the premium being cheap. He's
4157.82s:  still would have left a massive amount of time value left in the options. So we can take a look at
4164.22s:  an example of this together. Let's go to 11 June. Here.
4183.18s:  24 June. Which will 11? Actually, you don't even have to go to 11. Let's go to 13th.
4193.90s:  When we know we got out, this will be the. This will be a better.
4200.54s:  Roryntady says wasn't there only a week left. There was only a week left. But again, I'll show you
4205.82s:  what I mean. This is the cool part of options. So let's go to 20, not 26, that's today's date.
4217.02s:  I again, I'm an idiot. So 13 June. And right now, he has the what is it? The 21 July?
4232.30s:  20 calls. So let's take a look.
4247.42s:  And I'll show you why I don't think he did exercise. And Newton and I, we had a long debate about
4253.50s:  this because Newton also thinks that he exercised. But I think that's just because Newton doesn't
4259.26s:  fully understand options. And he was the I think the thing Newton was doing there was pattern seeking.
4268.46s:  It was confirmation bias. He wanted them to exercise because of Newton's perception of what that
4273.98s:  would mean in terms of creating like another wave potentially. But I don't think mathematically
4280.94s:  it lines up. Again, just from calculating the residual basis, we already see his basis would have
4285.74s:  to be on average 26 or nine. But more importantly, let's take a look at his options, which were the 21
4293.42s:  June's. And he had the 20s. So let's actually do the math here. And let's not do the lazy back of the
4301.90s:  napkin way of doing this. So right now, GameStop is trading at 28 5 6 9 9.
4315.02s:  His 20 calls.
4321.98s:  He has 20 calls.
4323.18s:  Titi says, could he have rolled his options? No, he could not because they would be here.
4333.50s:  So the fact that they're not here tells me he didn't roll them.
4342.70s:  Right now, his 20 calls are trading for $8.80.
4353.18s:  So now if we break this intrinsic versus extrinsic value.
4372.94s:  Oh, because the vaults so fucked up, I don't even know what they would have classified it as.
4377.10s:  Interesting.
4392.94s:  So it's like 23 cents, something like that.
4395.90s:  So then if we have 23 cents on again, it wouldn't be the full because again, we know that he
4406.86s:  didn't exercise all 120,000. Right. That's again, it's just an objective fact because he only added
4415.90s:  4 million 1000 shares. So for him to get to that,
4428.14s:  he could have done 40,000 and 10.
4436.62s:  This is what if we take the exercise scenario, this is what he would have exercised.
4441.82s:  And the issue with this is this is his extrinsic value here.
4451.74s:  I'll create some labels.
4456.30s:  Intrinsic equals this minus this.
4465.58s:  So this is his intrinsic value.
4474.78s:  So this is going back to basic options.
4483.18s:  And I can zoom this in a little bit to make it easier to see.
4495.34s:  So he could have exercised up to 40,000 and 10.
4499.34s:  If he did that, this is what would have happened.
4509.50s:  He would have taken this 40,000 in 10 contracts.
4516.70s:  And then he would essentially give up a million dollars.
4525.50s:  Because this is the extrinsic value that he would have given up that he otherwise could collect
4538.38s:  by selling the option and then going to the open market.
4543.26s:  So from two data points, I don't believe he exercised.
4551.42s:  The first one is because the basis here doesn't match up.
4557.50s:  Again, if he exercised using this 40,000 and 10, his additional basis would have had to have been
4568.46s:  20609 and it wasn't.
4571.98s:  So that's the first part.
4573.90s:  The second part is that he would have given up 920,000 dollars.
4582.70s:  And I just I know that he's not in it for the money is not super concerned,
4586.46s:  but I also don't think he's in the business of just throwing money away,
4590.22s:  which is literally what that is.
4591.74s:  It's just throwing it away.
4594.06s:  So I think that he wanted to monetize the calls before expiration.
4600.62s:  This is one of the few instances where he actually exited relatively early.
4604.78s:  Most of the other periods he exited when the option still had like no time left.
4610.54s:  So this is why I don't think he exercised his options.
4615.74s:  And this is why I think that the math leads us towards him selling the options and then buying
4622.70s:  the shares on the market.
4626.86s:  That's what I think.
4628.14s:  I think Magnum says, well, he did end up giving up being a millionaire, a billionaire,
4634.30s:  but makes sense.
4635.02s:  Yeah, exactly.
4635.74s:  He did give up being a billionaire.
4637.82s:  That's hilarious, but it's wild that that is the case.
4641.74s:  Did you imagine being a billionaire off of GameStop stock?
4644.94s:  Like what a story that is incredible.
4648.70s:  Absolutely incredible.
4651.42s:  So I mean, that looks pretty clear to me in terms of
4657.82s:  did he exercise or did he not?
4661.02s:  And this to me overwhelmingly looks like he did not.
4665.98s:  So interesting though, very, very interesting.
4671.18s:  Anything else we should take a look at before we wrap up?
4675.34s:  For those that are typically in the normal live streams, I don't have any live streams slated
4681.50s:  for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
4684.70s:  I'm doing a little bit of travel.
4687.82s:  I need to go get my back looked at by a specialist.
4690.94s:  So I'm actually flying to Florida to go do that.
4693.66s:  So I will not be live streaming.
4695.82s:  I might live stream on Tuesday because we might wrap early enough,
4700.86s:  but I would be live streaming on East Coast hours.
4704.62s:  So I would probably be doing something at like 6 p.m.
4708.54s:  their time, which would be 3 p.m. Pacific time.
4711.10s:  Something like that.
4712.62s:  So that is the the near-term game plan.
4715.02s:  Now for tomorrow, I will be doing two different live streams.
4720.78s:  I'm going to do a live stream again at like 1530.
4723.74s:  That's going to be open for everybody.
4726.30s:  And that one will be like the standard market outlook that I normally would do on Monday
4732.86s:  to kind of compensate for that.
4734.38s:  And then I'll still have the outlier pro-specific live stream at 1700.
4738.46s:  We're going to be digging into specific trades and stuff like that.
4742.30s:  So that's the game plan.
4747.18s:  Roryntady says, is it for pro-low therapy?
4750.14s:  I don't even know what that is.
4751.90s:  So I actually have no idea what that is.
4753.98s:  What is pro-low therapy?
4755.58s:  But I'm not saying it wasn't a couple mill for the bigger picture kind of thing.
4760.06s:  Was just a couple.
4760.94s:  But that's the thing is that it wasn't really, it didn't cause like a bigger picture effect,
4765.34s:  unfortunately.
4766.86s:  So I think the Roryntady says, traveling for healthcare socks, we might have to take my mom
4774.38s:  to Colorado. I'm actually in the opposite camp.
4777.50s:  Like I'm choosing to I'm for those that are in like I'm going to go see Brian Carroll.
4782.54s:  He's the guy that co-authored the gift of injury with Stuart McGill.
4788.06s:  So I'm really fortunate in that I'm doing this.
4791.98s:  It's completely all out of pocket for me, but I'm doing it because I think that he's the right guy
4797.26s:  for me to go see and to have an assessment with and to create a game plan with.
4805.10s:  Now for somebody like you, Roryntady, I feel for you there because that does suck.
4810.78s:  Like if I had to drive 10 hours to go somewhere, that's a pain in the ass.
4816.54s:  I feel for you there.
4819.74s:  Roryntady says, isn't that why everyone travels for medical?
4823.58s:  Potentially?
4824.54s:  Yeah, I mean that absolutely could be the case.
4827.26s:  I'm not sure why most people do what they got to do.
4834.38s:  They said that they got here, but I don't think they're here.
4845.58s:  All right, gang.
4847.58s:  I'm going to go link up with this door dash driver.
4849.58s:  I will see you guys in the discord.
4851.58s:  Thank you for the positive energy.
4853.58s:  I've impured us and then I will catch you guys when I get back.
4855.58s:  Normal life schedule will resume on Thursday.
4857.58s:  Be an outlier.
4859.58s:  Be an ape.
4861.58s:  Be an outlier ape.
4863.58s:  Whatever is most applicable and I'll catch you all later.
4875.58s:  you
