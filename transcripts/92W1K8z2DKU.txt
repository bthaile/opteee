 Systematic technical analysis, this is going to be a two-part series that walks you through exactly how I've developed my approach to using technical analysis when trading options for the past 16 years. I really emphasize finding things that are simple, yet effective, and the first video here is going to walk you through my methodology for technical analysis and then the tools that I use. And then the second video is going to walk you through the process I employ with some examples and best practices. My goal for these two videos is to really give you a sense on how I use TA in my trading. I know there are some evangelists out there that think TA can perfectly predict the future. I'm not one of them. I know there's also people out there that think it's complete voodoo, not one of them either. I find myself in the middle of the road where I find it useful in helping me determine probabilistic outcomes so that I can make better informed decisions. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make editing like this possible, which makes the videos more fun for everybody. So if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing up. It helps me make better content for you. So let's take a look at what we have first methodology. So really what I want to talk about here are a handful of concepts that really guide my approach when it comes to technical analysis. The first one is that it has to be efficient. You can spend way too much time getting into the weeds, even trying to learn individual candle stick patterns and stuff like that. And that's not me. I don't think that's a great return on the time, especially compared to the literally thousands of hours of research I've put into comparing how effective these different tools are in helping me determine direction. So I'm looking at what gives me the best bang for the buck. What things allow me to look at over 5,000 products and quickly distill it down into something that is a usable list for me to then get more in depth. Applicable is really important. This might not jump out to you as an important point upfront, but making sure that the analysis were applying is appropriate for what we're analyzing. So for example, if I'm trading a one year thesis that intraday charts really don't matter at all. So it's making sure that whatever analysis were employing aligns with the broader thesis that we're exploring and that takes a little bit of time. I still use the same tools. I just adjust what I'm looking at so that it applies context first and then precision. I use technical analysis to help me understand the broad stock market because here's the deal technical analysis is based on two things. Price and volume and no matter what price and volume are the ultimate things that matter to us as traders. That's what determines direction price and volume. So understanding the broad markets behavior in that context and then using technical analysis to help me really pinpoint specific areas of interest. It helps me formulate where I want my profit and lost targets to be things like that. So it's going to start zoomed out and then it's going to zoom in over time to help me get really detailed. Another quick note on this concept of price and volume. It's that markets inherently are not purely rational. However, investor behavior is still captured in price and volume. So it's one of the few tools we can use that allows us to truly understand what's going on in the markets outside of the theoretical understanding of people being rational actors because markets are not always rational. It's because human beings are emotion. We've already talked about this idea of multiple time frame. So I'll skip over that for now. When I'm going through my technical analysis tools. I have a subset of tools that allow me to analyze a few different things which we'll get into in just a second. And I'm looking for a confluence of evidence. What that means is if I see moving averages moving in one way and then a momentum indicator moving in another way and volume behaving a certain way. I'm not necessarily going to look at any one of those as the end all be all of my thought process. Each one of them comes together to form a picture. So I'm looking to create an entire vision using all of these different tools that analyze different aspects of technical analysis so that I can then apply a decision. So it's important to think of this as a individual system then leads into a total process. The entire concept when we're going through any sort of analysis is these two things right here. We're looking for knows and trades have to earn your money. What does this mean? What is looking for a know? I think one of the defining features for unsuccessful retail traders is as they're looking for trades. I'm looking for reasons to say yes. They're trying to coax themselves into the trade. Whereas I find more successful traders were typically saying no 98% of the time I'm saying no. And then I'm finding that smaller subset of occurrences that looks so appealing to me that I can't say no. But it makes too much sense in terms of a risk to reward profile for me to turn it down that shift in your mindset. I think is really important because it moves us from forcing trades into finding really great trades. Now let's get into the tools. This should be pretty straight forward for most people if you've ever looked at my charts, but I want to look at the tool and then I want to show you it on the chart quickly. So first things first we have moving averages. We have a long term moving average, which is the 200 or 150. Then we kind of have a mid long term, which is like a 50 day and then two shorter term moving averages, a 21 and a 9. These numbers change slightly. You can take her with different variations as you can tell. I tend to move between these. The 50 is almost always on the chart and then these sometimes change sometimes I use an 11 sometimes I use a seven sometimes I use 22 instead of 21. You can play with these numbers a little bit. It doesn't make that big of a difference. These are what I found to generally work. And there's a handful of things that matter to me as I'm looking through these, but I want to really emphasize this point to you as we go through all of these different indicators. There are a handful of traits that I'm going to apply the first is multiple time frames. So I'm not going to look at moving averages just in a vacuum. I'm going to look at them across different time frames, just like all of these. It helps me gain context first and then precision scale velocity, durations, the relationships, all of these things matter to me. So I'm not just looking at the moving averages and saying, oh, here is a nine day moving average below the 21 day. I'm looking at what's the width between these two? What's that relationship doing? What's the steepness of these moving averages, understanding how they behave. So for example, nine day moving averages, they're going to move pretty voraciously because it's not using a lot of data. However, if we look at something like a 200 day moving average, notice how it doesn't really move quite that much. But then when I see it picking up this kind of slope, this is massive in relation to how this moving average typically looks. So part of is you have to develop a relationship with the different tools you use. So for me, I'm going to use moving averages across those time frames. I'm looking for the width between them. That indicates strength just as slope, how steep is the slope? I'm looking for orientation is the nine above the 21 above the 50 above the 200 with price above them all. If that's the case, that's pretty dang bullish in terms of moving averages, then you can take a look at short term crossover is like the nine below the 21 or the nine above the 21. You can see how that all looks in relation to longer term moving averages. All of these things matter. Now I'll leave you to tinker with this to find specifics that work for you. But for me, I really want to understand what the slope is, what the relationship is. What the relationship is between them and where is price in relation to them? That really matters to me. And then depending on the duration of the trade, I use different crossovers for different things because if you'll notice, if you use, let's say, for example, a 50 day crossing below the 200 day, that's going to be a much slower indicator because there's a lot more data integrated into it. If you're trading a really short term strategy, this might not align well with you. You have to figure out what time frames matter most for the individual strategy are applying next up linear aggression channels 50 and 100. So these are the kind of these gray lines in the background. This gray line here is the 50. This one is the 100. The 50 encompasses 50% of the moves on the chart in the aggregation period. The 100% encompasses 100% of them. You can view these kind of like standard deviation channels with this being a plus one minus one plus two minus two. It's not perfect slight difference, but it typically will operate. So I'm looking at two things primarily. The first thing, what is the trend? Are we positive sloping? Are we flats? Are we negative sloping? So as a look at IWM on a one year daily, this is positive sloping. Maybe if we come into a six month daily, we see it still positively sloping. Then if we come into a three month daily, we see it negatively sloping. So you can see as you look at different time frames, you're going to see slightly different things. The first one I'm looking for is the overall direction. The second thing I'm looking for is price extension. Most price is going to fall within this inner band, the 50% band. When I see price starting to get strong out to these outsides, it can tell me that we're looking a bit overextended. Does it mean that it can't go past it further? No, it certainly can, but I'm looking at technical analysis in terms of probabilistic outcomes. If I see something hovering near an extreme, I tend to think we might see some sort of aversion provided that we see other support for it. So in this case, linear regression channels upward sloping, however, we get up near a plus two linear regression channel, which is near term resistance price balls flow, the nine, nine day moving average and so on and so forth. So you can kind of paint a picture for yourself. Now back to moving averages really quick in terms of simple moving averages, exponential moving averages, voluited moving averages. Because you can tinker with all of them. I've studied all of these in depth and I genuinely do not think there's a giant difference between them. I think it doesn't matter. What I like to do is for the short term moving averages, I use simple moving averages because they already have enough sensitivity to current price. And for the longer term moving averages, I like to use exponentials sometimes because it helps me become a little more sensitive to current prices with the longer term moving average again, you could use SMA for all of them. So M A's linear regression channels. Next we have volume profile average volume. If you recall, the two things we care about is price and volume. So the volume profile tells us where transactions have occurred in the highest frequency. This gives us an idea of support resistance inherently. So what this means is where we see the most transactions that tends to serve as support than resistance resistance and support depending on where prices around it. So for example, the point of control, which is where the most transactions occurred in that aggregation period that happened right here around like one. One 84 something like that notice how one price came down to it. It bounced around here for quite a while. That's because there's a lot of people willing to buy here. Then it bounced up and out came back down. Now it fell below. So this tells me that if it comes back up to this point, there's probably going to be a good bit of resistance there because there's a lot of people that might be wanting to get out that bought here. They have a chance to get out for a scratch and they might want to exit the trade. The other thing I use them for is kind of these shelves, these nodes. So you notice how when price fell below the point of control notice how there's no gray area here that tells me that there was not a lot of transactions at this point and notice how easily price fell below until it started getting to these other nodes and now prices starting to congest out again. So when you see nodes like this, it just means that again, there's people willing to transact there. And when you look at these big gaps, those to me look like areas that we can move quickly. around whether it's up through them to the bullish side, whether it's down below them. And again, it's really important to look at different time frames because if we look at a one year daily, this notice still there, it's just not the point of control. The point of control is actually down here. And if you'll notice price happened to bounce right around it. So this tells me that there's a lot of people willing to buy here. And again, on both of those two time frames, we looked at there's a big gap here. There's not a lot of people transacting at that price. So that just kind of doubles down that thesis that we might see movement quite a lot. So quickly through this zone where there's not a lot of transactions occurring. Now volume average is really just for context and it helps me understand break outs and break downs. The thing to know about price is that it can fall under its own weight. It doesn't need a lot of transactions to fall fast in order to raise in kind of bounce through resistance or to have it an extended up move. It needs outsized volume. So what I like to do is use a volume average. This purple line is a 30 day volume average. And you can see I'm wanting to use kind of a shorter term time frame, which is 30 days. You can use longer term 50 days depending on, you know, the duration that you're looking to trade, but I'm looking for anomalies. I want to see periods where if we're rallying and volume is really low like this case here, I'm, I don't really trust that that much. That's really what that means to me. If we're rallying and we see outsized volume like this, I'm more interested, especially if there's multiple days with extended volume to the upside like these two days. If you look at this transaction. These three days, we had a red day here, then two green days, but on all three of these. There was a lot of volume. So that gives me an idea that there could be some support at this level, because there's a lot of people looking to transact. Then if you look back at the point of control that we saw in a longer term time frame, that confirms that we know a lot of people are looking to transact here. So again, you can see how we paint a picture using these things. Remember stock can fall under its own weight. So I'm not going to let you know that. I'm going to just use a little bit of used time frame. It's going to be a bit of a tricky to use. I'm going to just use a little bit of time frame. So I'm just going to show you how I'm going to use that. I'm just going to show you how I'm going to see how I'm going to if it starts dropping on less impressive volume, that doesn't mean anything. Now, if it starts dropping and it has impressive volume, that means there's a lot of people selling, a lot of people selling. So you can also add that to your toolkit. Next, support resistance trends. This is a visual representation of support resistance, which again, I'm kind of getting from these volume profiles and moving averages anyways. But I like to use different trends for different time frames. So if you notice, if I go out here to like a two year, I have this pretty long term channel plotted out. And then I also have these price levels at interesting points where there was a lot of transactions. The way to think about support and resistance is you're looking for congestion. Look, you're looking for areas where prices moved around a lot. And also remember, the more recent the time frame is that you're looking at the more powerful that that support and resistance area is the more relevant it is. So if we see some sort of support and resistance here, like this is a great example, this section right above my head, this will serve as near-term resistance whenever we get back up here. And if we get back up there quickly, this is very recent. So this would be kind of powerful, especially because the number of touches or transactions in a very congested area that tends to amplify the strength of whatever indicator you're looking at. So if you're looking at really old charts, like something like a three year weekly and there's a bunch of congestion up here, it may or may not be relevant. In this case, I think it would be just because there's a lot of people back holding right now. But the point being is when we're looking at these different areas using support resistance, I'm looking for where's congestion. And then when I'm evaluating it, the more recent the congestion is, the more interested I am in it. I'm not that passionate about these breakdowns. Like you could see it fell below this longer term trend. And it was okay. It came back up. It's more for context that I put these like if it dropped down and it really shot down below it, then I would just view this as potentially resistance. But not so much for the trend lines. It's more of these price levels that are horizontal that are showing me where there's congestion of transactions in oscillator. This is like a secondary indicator for me. So I use the money flow index or volume weighted moving average convergence divergence. The money flow index is kind of like a volume weighted RSI. But you can use it to help with pinpoint timing, things like that. The main thing I would talk to you about using these is one, seeing if they're flattening out and if price starts to flatten out beyond it, that's interesting to me. I also am interested. Not so much if it gets overextended, under extended, I'm less concerned with that. But if there's divergence. So if price is rallying and this is going down, that tells me that the rally is suspicious. Or if we see price starting to shoot up and out, and this was negative trending for a while, that tells me that I would expect this to start turning up. And if it doesn't, again, I would be suspicious. So it's just kind of like a tertiary indicator to me. Breath allows me to look at the market as a whole. So slightly different than all these TA tools. Breath like net highs and lows, that gives me a sense of the total market and net highs and lows is down here. So this is looking for the New York stock exchange. And it's telling me exactly that net highs and lows. How many stocks are making highs compared to those to those making lows? And typically when we're bullish, you'll see net highs being very positive. Same thing when we're going down, you'll see net highs lows being quite negative. So it's almost like a MACD for use to those. But this is for the whole stock market. This is looking at everything in the New York stock exchange. And I like to add two moving averages. I have a 10 day and a 50 day. This is all just think scripts that I've made. But the whole idea here is to get a sense on what the market is doing as a whole. So as this sits at the bottom of my chart, this is not high to whatever I'm looking at. This is always tied to the entire New York stock exchange. And again, looking at this in multiple time frames is really important because you can see this period here. It looks really big, really interesting. Like, wow, that's a lot of net highs in this time frame. But if we zoom out to kind of like a weekly time frame, you notice how lame it actually looks compared to something like you see back here. So getting that context is really important when using something like net highs and lows. But this is a big important indicator for me because when I see this kind of consolidation, I'm not looking to get really long the market here writ large. I'm looking to get that confluence of evidence. If I'm bullish, I want as many of these things to look bullish to me as humanly possible, which will get more into in the next video on how I overlay all of these together. But it's a good reminder. And then the last one here is the IV HV plot. This one's super simple. This one is really for those options traders out there. And it's a way for me to visualize implied and historic volatility. That's all. So if you're not an options trader, this will be nothing to you. But if you are an options trader, I am making sure that in general, I want to see implied trending over historic because that's where variance risk premiums are. And that's typically how they will be priced. And I use this a lot during earnings. I use this a lot if I'm trading any sort of variance risk premium capture strategy. But the idea here is to give me a better understanding of the gap between implied and historic moves. That's additionally important context specifically when you're trading options and volatility strategies. So that's mostly it. Some of these tools change. Sometimes I add some, sometimes I remove some. It's a slightly breathing list. But in general, you're always going to see the MAs and you're going to see the regression channels. You're going to see the volume average profiles, support and resistance oscillator. Sometimes less weighted. The breath will always be there. So these are kind of the heart and soul of what I do. I tinker with a lot of different tools. But I have hands down the highest efficacy with these. Now your challenge is in your own trading. Figure out what tools you like to use. Ideally, it's not a huge list. And then track how well you can determine direction. Open up an Excel sheet. List that a bunch of random stocks. Apply your technical analysis in the columns. List out the different analysis you're performing with the different moving averages. If you're using volume profiles. So I'm so forth. And then at the end, list out whether or not your bullish bearish or your neutral and then track how you do that will help you so much with identifying what works and what doesn't work for your specific style of trading. It's massive. Cannot emphasize that enough. So the next video we're going to go into the actual process. How I put all of this together to look at things efficiently with a pretty high degree of accuracy. As always, if there's any questions, throw them in the show notes below. And I'm happy to take a look. I try to answer all of them when they pop up. If there's anything I left out, also let me know. Don't forget to like, subscribe, share the video. So we get some more views on these things, huh? And be an outlier. And see you guys later.
