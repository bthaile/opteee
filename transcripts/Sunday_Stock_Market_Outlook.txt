0.54s: [Music]
0.84s: what up outliers quick Market Outlook
3.44s: for the week ahead we had a bit of an
6.64s: interesting week last week we obviously
9.12s: saw the FED cut rates there's a lot of
12.32s: speculation now what that means for the
14.24s: markets going forward there's people
16.40s: like myself that are still kind of not
18.36s: convinced that we're in the the land of
21.16s: soft Landing there are other people that
23.32s: think we've nailed it and we're good
25.40s: only time will tell so I just want to
27.80s: take a quick look of the market what's
30.48s: coming up this week and that will
33.76s: essentially hopefully set us all up for
36.40s: a solid week because there's a couple
37.96s: things so first off I still am seeing
41.52s: obviously relative strength within large
43.64s: caps the other thing I'm seeing is that
45.96s: even the qes are starting to Rally
47.84s: they're still like 20 points off off of
50.16s: highs and then if we take a look at
52.40s: small caps small caps have now taken
55.48s: down to seven points off of highs so
59.24s: what that tells me is Tech still is not
63.24s: really that strong and then that tells
66.20s: me when I'm looking at the performance
68.64s: of the S&P 500 it's not it's not
72.24s: primarily coming from technology it's
74.28s: coming from these other sectors it's
76.72s: coming from xlu it's coming from XLF
79.84s: which is now just back up essentially at
82.24s: alltime highs we'll see how that goes
84.04s: it's coming from xlc it's coming from
85.88s: xlb it's coming from xli I so this is
89.32s: one of those really interesting
90.44s: scenarios where for so long technology
93.08s: was really dragging everything up with
96.24s: it and it's kind of the inverse it's the
98.84s: rest of the sector or the rest of the
101.40s: index via all these different sectors is
103.48s: what's really dragging spy up it's not
106.52s: being fueled by Tech and again this is
109.72s: just not super common so when I'm
112.72s: looking for opportunities it's really
115.12s: interesting I'm still finding a lot of
118.04s: really interesting things in utility for
120.52s: sure and which I don't think most people
124.72s: thought that that's where we would be
125.84s: looking right now but that is where
128.48s: we're still continuing to see some level
130.52s: of strength the other thing is looking
132.96s: at a market perspective this coming week
136.08s: we have a few things coming up so when I
139.96s: look at the
141.40s: 23rd main thing are going to be services
144.12s: in manufacturing PMI then the 24th
147.60s: consumer confidence I'm actually not
149.48s: that jazzed about it meaning I don't
151.48s: think it's going to be a big deal but I
152.76s: do think it's going to be an important
154.04s: read Because what I can tell you right
156.20s: now is if we take a look at Fred there
159.40s: are few things going on so the first
161.24s: thing is if we take a look at
162.32s: delinquency rates I can see a few very
165.36s: clear Trends the first one is
166.72s: delinquency rates on credit cards are
168.80s: still going up I can also see that
172.92s: consumer loan charge offs is also going
176.16s: up so I don't like seeing all these
178.96s: different debt instruments from a
180.52s: consumer perspective increasing and I
183.44s: also can see that personal savings is
185.64s: actually Contracting which I don't love
188.32s: so a big part of this is understanding
191.12s: you know what the new Norm is what the
192.72s: new paradigm is but what I can tell you
195.16s: is it's not like the consumer is in this
196.84s: fantastic position now I still fully
199.24s: expect to see things in like real estate
201.36s: showing strength because as rates come
203.60s: down the real estate market is likely
205.36s: going to become a little bit more active
207.76s: but I'm not sure that the consumer is in
210.40s: this Rock Solid position and again
213.04s: there's leads and lags to this whole
214.48s: thing so it can take a little while
217.20s: before we see the consumer starting to
219.44s: struggle holistically then if we look at
221.76s: the 25th nothing really going on home
224.40s: sales again I don't see anything really
226.92s: on the 25th that's jumping out at me the
229.08s: 26th big day so we have GDP quarter over
232.56s: quarter final we have jbless claims both
234.92s: of those are going to be a really big
237.40s: deal because now we need to see base on
240.00s: the cut that we had what kind of path
242.52s: are we on and then we also have a bunch
244.60s: of different fed speaker but our boy JP
247.24s: will be speaking in the morning so that
249.68s: typically brings with it a little bit of
252.84s: Market volatility and then on the 27th
254.80s: we have more inflation level metrics so
257.04s: we have things like pce um both regular
260.32s: and core and then we have the University
262.72s: of Michigan sentiment so when I look
265.00s: across this personal income consumption
268.12s: these I'm expecting to see kind of fall
270.24s: within a range based on again what I'm
272.80s: seeing here but I think the big thing is
276.16s: the market is now trying to see what
278.92s: what is the path forward How likely is
281.20s: it that we find ourselves in a soft
283.56s: landing and there's actually a really
286.16s: important series of events coming up
288.24s: very soon that are going to help us
290.44s: identify that so if we take a look
293.84s: now at the calendar it's pretty quiet
297.32s: right now but again if we take a look at
299.88s: October we start to open up with the
302.80s: banks reporting earnings I think this
305.00s: earnings report is going to be really
307.84s: this earning season is going to be
309.68s: really really important and the banks
311.20s: are kind of like the canary and the coal
312.64s: mine you'll be able to see how they're
315.12s: behaving in the current environment and
317.68s: what they're forecasting for the rest of
319.88s: the year and all of them are going to
321.44s: integrate obviously their expected
323.72s: impacts from the Fed rate Cuts because
326.72s: if we take a look now at the FED watch
328.76s: tool the Fed rate scenario or really the
332.32s: Sofer rate is really interesting so if
335.68s: we take a look at the probabilities here
338.64s: it's literally already showing the
341.48s: probability of us landing between 4 and
343.36s: a quar and 4 and a half as 51% come the
348.24s: 7 November meeting so this is going to
351.04s: be really important to track because
353.36s: that's showing literally a greater than
356.92s: 50% probability right now today of
359.88s: another 50 basis point cut that starts
363.04s: to become kind of aggressive and I
366.24s: thought that the recent rate cut was
368.60s: whatever uh it's 50 basis points in
370.68s: terms of where we're at is not a giant
372.24s: deal but if we continue down this path
375.96s: that I don't want to say is alarming but
378.80s: it is concerning I think because
381.92s: obviously the probability of no change
384.32s: is essentially null it's gone away
386.08s: entirely and we're 50/50 split between
389.04s: 25 basis points in 50 that starts to get
392.88s: really aggressive and it has us
396.04s: hitting this 2 and 3/4 to
400.16s: 3% it has this Landing there by
404.48s: September of next year which this is the
409.08s: first spot where I see the probability
411.60s: of a pause that surprises me I would
415.04s: expect to see a pause much sooner in
417.40s: this sequence but I mean who knows we
419.60s: will soon find out so when I look across
422.44s: the broad Market though I think this
425.16s: upcoming earnings is going to be really
427.64s: informative for us so I'm eagerly
430.36s: awaiting that now for the outlier Pro
433.28s: members we have our live stream later
434.76s: today so we'll dive into running through
436.36s: some scans looking at some trades but
438.96s: for everybody else I will catch you on
440.40s: the live stream tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.
442.76s: Pacific time being out liar I'll see you
444.52s: guys out there
