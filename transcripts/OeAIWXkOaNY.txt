0.00s: What's up, outliers? Time for a quick market analysis on GameStop specifically because
5.06s: man was there a day today. I want to talk about the overall price action where it seems
10.38s: to be sitting. At the end of the video, I'll go through some position updates for the
14.40s: coverage strangle. I don't imagine most people are super interested in that, but I'm sharing
18.18s: that just because I said I would. So I'll save that towards the end and we'll spend most
22.30s: of the time just talking about the stock, the movement, what things look like because
27.66s: this is a noteworthy day. I did a little homework and I went back essentially to the
37.12s: inception of GameStop and I wanted to look at what's the frequency that we saw 10% plus
44.48s: down moves specifically. And as you can see is a total representation of days, it's just
51.32s: over 1%. This is rounded down because like 1.02 or something like that. So you can see
56.28s: that this is a hyper rare case, 75 instances as a gross count. So you would think this would
67.36s: be necessitated or follow some sort of big news cycle. Maybe Ryan Cohen steps down. Maybe
77.60s: this could be GameStop decides that it's going to file for bankruptcy. None of that's happening.
86.88s: Cohen is still doing his job. He's doing a great job. We're not seeing any underlying change in
94.00s: the company at all. So the fact that there's this big of a move on literally no news that I can find
103.92s: is exceedingly suspect. Then we take this article from yesterday funny enough. This is from
114.08s: Benzinga and you can see that there was a bit of a bearish series of trades that came in for
123.84s: GameStop yesterday, literally yesterday. Did that activity cause this sort of movement?
132.80s: Personally, I don't think so. Did that activity front run a potential movement? Maybe I don't know.
140.72s: I can't prove it one way or the other. But what I can tell you objectively is that when I look
146.80s: across the other tickers that are most closely associated with this, and we grab XRT,
156.64s: XRT had a inside day today. What is this down 0.86% it's showing us? So open here at 78 52,
167.12s: closed at 77 59. So the broader sector that it's a part of didn't experience this move. Then if we
176.16s: take a look at small caps, small caps literally had an update. So what happened here? Now I did take a
186.40s: look at AMC just at a curiosity because it is frequent that you will see somewhat sympathetic moves
194.80s: between these. Now you can see the lead in to the previous drops looks different in AMC than it does
200.72s: for GameStop. But both of them do have four consecutive drops that culminated with a much larger
207.28s: drop today. Interesting. Is that not? So it starts to beg the question, what the fuck is going on?
217.36s: Why would this happen? What's causing this? Because it's already fallen out the 10 days rolled over,
225.36s: 20 day rolled over, it punched right through the 50. And now it's charging towards the 150. I'm
231.12s: going to change this to a 200 out of curiosity to see how this stacks up. Still got a long ways
239.20s: before it gets to a 200-day AMA, which is still shockingly positively sloping. So
247.44s: I don't see anything. I haven't seen any sort of news that would explain this move.
252.80s: Now the other thing that we were talking about before though was the expectation that this week
257.76s: was going to be volatile. And we can see that the front wall here is literally 136%.
265.28s: Now it's really important when we're quoting volatility like this to differentiate between
271.52s: upfront wall for this front expiration and wall for the underlying itself. When people
276.56s: standardly quote volatility, they'll standardly quote this 102. Or it was a little bit lower earlier
283.52s: today that it was sub 100. But that's for 30 day vol. That's forward looking and it's using a month.
290.88s: We can get more specific than that with options chains by looking at internal
296.32s: expirations from that standard expiration cycle about 30 days out somewhere in here.
303.12s: And you can see that it's 136.2% on this front expiration. A lot of that. And we knew part of this
309.68s: was going to happen this week because of this. There are a ton of options. There's literally
315.76s: 540,000 calls against 153,000 puts that expire this week. This is expanded day over day as compared
326.08s: to contracting, which is really interesting because expiration is a few days away here.
331.76s: The over half of the total call OI is in this Friday's expiration. That is unequivocally a
340.56s: recipe for volatility. You're going to see it. And we are seeing it. It is what it is.
346.88s: So that being said, when I see the movement here in GameStop, I see literally nothing that I
354.64s: can directly point at other than some interesting sympathetic moves with some interesting other names.
361.20s: This is why I talk about technical analysis being something that you can loosely apply to GameStop.
367.44s: You cannot apply standard technical analysis to GameStop because it does not follow the standard
375.12s: behavior of supply and demand because for this to happen, there has to be an excess of supply that
383.52s: is built up typically driven by some sort of news event. Overall volume today was 11.76,
393.20s: 11.77 mil, which is a little bit over the five day average, which is a point eight,
401.84s: and over the 20 day average, which is 10.6. So big expansion in volume on a relative basis,
410.48s: mostly sell side, no surprise. And this thing just got absolutely punished on what looks to be
416.80s: absolutely no news. Now the good part, volatility is alive. That's not all bad. The reason why that's
425.12s: not all bad is because it offers a lot of different opportunities for positioning and adjusting
431.44s: existing positions, especially for us options traders. I made a bunch of adjustments to make GameStop
436.32s: position today that we will talk about in just a few seconds. I want to take a look at this
440.48s: front expiration cycle though. Look at the build out. The net change in OI over yesterday into
445.84s: today is massive. We're seeing lots and lots of new options flowing into this thing on a really
453.76s: short term basis. We are not seeing anywhere near that scale on the put side. So then who stands to
460.64s: benefit from this? There's not a bunch of open options in the front expiration that are set to
465.84s: take advantage of this. So then that begs the question, what was opened recently? Was there anything
471.04s: that stuck out to me from a recent options entry perspective? And not really because if we isolate
480.56s: this to puts over the last couple of days, there really wasn't that much going on. There really
486.00s: wasn't. There's obviously some being bought, but nothing big, nothing that would lead me to
490.24s: believe that somebody knew something and is trying to front run a big order via derivatives,
494.08s: at least in the short term. So that part's also kind of interesting. I'm not seeing any big
499.68s: artifacts popping up from the options chain that would indicate that. So what do we do from here?
505.92s: Well, first, it's always good to understand what we're trading and the behavior of GameStop.
511.60s: And the fact that it does not comply with normal supply and demand rules because part of it is
517.84s: we can see that there are some clear signs of manipulation. We also know that this is a highly
522.48s: volatile stock. We also know that this is coming up on one of the biggest options,
526.96s: explorations that it's had in some time with over 500,000 calls expiring this week that's going
533.84s: to cause a certain level of volatility. What I also found interesting is if we take a look at
539.76s: just overall gamut exposure, we can see that there's obviously a tremendous amount of exposure
546.08s: at the 30s. And we can see that dealers are likely net long gamma. So their hedging behavior
555.12s: really shouldn't be adding massively to market volatility here. But on a big, sustained move like
561.20s: this, it's going to cause some larger changes in their book. But we can also see as we go further
567.92s: up that there's bigger concentrations of gamma and down by where we are now, 2728.
575.76s: Really light. There really isn't a whole lot there. So that also is slightly interesting
583.68s: and anomalous to me. So I don't see a clear reason. And I wish I could discreetly identify
590.08s: something for you. But as you know, I'm not here to give you bad information. I'm here to tell you
596.16s: what I see from my experience in markets. And then you to decide what you think is going on.
601.76s: But this to me doesn't look like it's news driven. It doesn't look like I haven't seen any sort
607.60s: of big reports by any big funds that are prospectively selling out their holdings of the stock. But
613.12s: that is one thing we should track going forward is institutional holdings. And if there's any big
617.12s: changes on that side of things. So fascinating movement today in games now to talk quickly about
625.76s: a few of those adjustments that I made. You'll notice now that we're actually down 100 shares.
631.60s: So we're sitting on 200 shares with the basis of 2827. So the first adjustment that was made
637.44s: was actually unwinding some of the shares. I had 100 that came out from an original basis.
644.56s: Realistically, this should be 2431. What I do in for this one is I'm using
652.24s: FIFO accounting. And literally the only reason for taking some of this down today was to wait
660.00s: and see what the stock does. Because for this coverage strangle, I still only have $25,000 allocated
666.40s: to the trade. So it's not much money. And I'm still already sitting at 54% utilize now.
672.48s: And you can see that I'm about split evenly with the little edge in terms of
678.32s: hash secured put requirement. And that's because of the volatility. I'm purposely getting a little
683.84s: more exposure via cash secured puts at this juncture because volatility is so high.
690.40s: So this is designed one to capture hopefully some of this movement. But it also will capture some
699.04s: of the wall. And what I do to manage the equity side of it, you can see I already have alerts set.
707.20s: So these alerts are just like, hey, it's starting to go back the other way. Start buying outright.
712.88s: That's the cool part about being a trader is I can come in and out of things to manage my basis.
719.60s: Because here's the scenario. Let's just say GameStop comes all the way back down
725.20s: into this area down here where the point of control is. And it's in the 22s. I'm not saying it's
729.92s: doing that. I just don't know. But if it does, there's no reason for me to hold onto it at a basis of
735.04s: 28 as it comes down here when I can exit on the way down and then regain my exposure at a better
742.80s: basis where I can accumulate a larger position for the same amount of money. And then conversely,
748.00s: if it starts skyrocketing, go in the other direction, just buy it outright and then take it to the
752.16s: upside. So this is the difference between a trader's approach with GameStop is what I'm trying to do
758.72s: is capture profits based on these movements, which subsequently allow me to build larger
764.72s: positions without adding any more money. I'm literally creating money out of the movement.
771.12s: That's what's going on right now. The other thing that you'll notice in addition to those puts,
776.64s: I took off, I think both of these. Yeah. So I took off the 32s and the 28s and then I essentially
783.28s: consolidated them into these. And then the other thing that I did was take these calls down for about
790.72s: 19 cents. And then I offered new calls. And the new calls are out in 21 fed. Same as the new puts,
799.44s: puts are at 26 calls are at 35 35 strike is well still well above my basis. And I'm still at a one
805.92s: to two ratio. So in terms of a, a vol perspective, this is in just really, really healthy spot.
813.60s: Some of these when I copy and paste it over for my primary sheet or wrong like the stock PNL,
818.24s: it's because I lock cells, but then I move it and it's in a different spot on this one,
823.68s: which is why you'll see some of these showing up wrong. But I adjusted it because this would be
828.64s: locking in a profit if I ended up getting assigned at 35 with the basis of this. So that's the,
834.88s: that's the near term game plan here is to continue running the coverage triangle. I took some of the
839.76s: shares down, seeing which way the stock decides to go. I don't really care which way it goes in the
844.88s: near term to be honest, because if it goes up, I buy if it goes down once it looks like it's
848.80s: finally setting, I buy. So the, the game plan is very, very simple. But what I'm doing is I'm monetizing
856.32s: the movements that we're seeing. Because if you don't do this from a trading perspective,
863.44s: you kind of just hold through these movements and your PNL will change, but it's unrealized. You're
869.20s: able to start building a larger position and compounding the position. That's really the,
875.20s: the whole point here, but this break is no good in my opinion. It is now in this really big volume.
881.12s: It's the second largest volume. No, that's on here. But to me, the level to be beat is here now.
887.76s: Because once if it falls below this, there's nothing. There's very, very, very little support
896.40s: all the way down until it gets down towards here. So I don't necessarily foresee that happening
902.48s: just yet. I never know. I also didn't foresee this move today happening. So just because I don't see
907.68s: it coming, doesn't mean it won't happen. But I do think that there's a pretty good chance that it'll
914.40s: consolidate in here for a while, just because there's a lot of people that are willing to,
917.76s: willing to transact at these levels. So it will be a really, really big, big open tomorrow to see
924.48s: where this thing sits. After hours, it ticked up about 10, 10 cents. So not a big up move at all.
930.32s: But it's better than seeing it continuing down in the after hours. So that might show a little
936.32s: bit of strength tomorrow. But based on a big move like this, they tend to go one or two ways. None of
941.68s: this is revolutionary. It'll either tend to accelerate massively or it'll likely consolidate one
947.28s: of those two. They can come out with like a V and shoot up and out. But typically you need news for
953.44s: that. And there's no news for this new jump. So we will have to see how it goes. As always,
959.12s: if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier.
