 Hey everyone, Eric here. I wanted to do a quick update on the Small Stacks portfolio. And I've been a little bit more active in there than I was expecting to be primarily because I'm trying to balance two things in conjunction with one another. And that's reducing risk as much as I can as well as capitalizing on opportunity as I see it emerge. So in general, I would expect to really be quite a bit less involved than I have been. But I'm not opposed to making adjustments when I see that they're logical and they make sense. So let's jump over the screen and take a look. First off, I closed out Zinga. I sold that originally. It was eight and a half put, sold it out on one September. And I collect 27 cents. I close it for 18 cents. So it's overall P&L 9 bucks. Again, in this scenario, it's really nothing to write home about. It's essentially just commissions for a handful of trades or whatever. But if we look at things in kind of a vacuum and use percentages to guide some of our decisions, even closing that at 18 cents collecting $9, it's still over a percent return on the eight and a half put. So going back to that message, I continue to beat. This isn't the account that you're going to make a bunch of money with. It's turning $5,000, $10,000, $25,000, even $100,000 into a bunch of money isn't really in the cards for most folks. What we're really looking to do is build an approach that works. So for me, it was time to take those splits down because they were well within 20 days of expiration. And that's my typical window for wanting to close those trades to limit my exposure to gamma risk. So as soon as I saw a decent opportunity, I took it. And I would take it again and again because in this scenario, it's the right move for me. The other thing I did is I closed out of the bank of America, BAC, the diagonal I had in there. And the reason why I did that is because I wanted to establish a position in XLF, covered strangle. So I neutralized the BAC diagonal. And that was an overall PNL of positive 26 bucks. So, and it's not because I needed the money to open up XLF. It's just because I didn't want XLF, which is the financial sector ETF and BAC. So really the trade off there is moving from BAC to XLF, which is that sector ETF gives me more exposure. It helps limit some of that unsystemic risk. And as you can see, it's a really good return for the money. It's almost a 2% return, just shy of a 2% return on the capital tied up. So I really like that trade and doing a covered strangle and something like an index ETF is very appealing to me. Same thing with the sector ETF. So that's why I made that move. I didn't want to replicate financials. So where that puts us right now, oh yeah, and the other thing, sorry, is I ended up selling a call in CROGAR. So I had a good spot in there to lay out a call. My intention there is to probably add to the position if it still hovers around where it is right now. I was actually hoping it went just a little bit lower to add that other call, the long call. So it hasn't quite hit that threshold just yet as you can see. I should obviously we can look at things historically. What I was about to say is I should have added down here, but I was more or less expecting it to come down a little bit more. So I didn't want to sell or I didn't want to buy in during these updates. And I want to see what this down day turns into before I add additional capital to CROGAR. But I am looking at scaling into that that diagonal a little bit more. So we'll see we'll see what opportunity comes up. But for the meantime, I just have a short call out to turn it into that covered position and collect a little bit more money up front. So that's where I'm at in CROGAR. So looking at the portfolio at large, where 64% utilize, we have 3,600 in cash out total P&L so far, $616, which represents about 11% return since starting this on one September, which again, I'm really, really stoked on that. But there's an outlier. Pfizer was an outlier trade. It returned really well very quickly. So you can see the general performance of the other trades, $50 or $24 bucks, $9 bucks, $26 bucks. CROGAR is another high earner and you can see right now that the diagonals are far outperforming the covered strangle, which is why I like to diversify some of the strategies I'm using to benefit when they're working. Because there's a plenty of instances where the diagonal doesn't work well. We started seeing that in CROGAR as it fell below where I could reasonably sell calls and collect money. So I was essentially just holding the position. So that's where balancing between the two different approaches is it's a good way to go about it for me. So right now we have $116 and credit out, which represents another 2% return on the new on the entire portfolio. So overall, we're doing well. We went from $5,000 to $5616. So the account is growing and the most importantly, the mechanics are leading us in a good direction thus far. So what I'm looking to do going forward is I probably will stay away from the covered strangle. I'll leave XLF as that primary position for now. The reason is if I own stock in there, I'm okay with it and I'll collect the dividend turn into a cover call that sort of thing. But I want to be able to add more to it if I need to, although I wouldn't expect to. But what I would like to do is find another diagonal candidate. So that will be my homework for this evening to find something else that looks attractive for a diagonal. Luckily in markets right now, this is why I started making some of these moves because with some of the down moves in the market, it becomes very appealing for a diagonal and entering into short premium positions on some sort of down move. Unlike my margin account, I probably will not scale out of this very much leading into the election. Simply because it's such a small amount of capital that I would rather just maintain the exposure and write out the move. But I will take down at least half of the account. So I guess I am planning on scaling out just not anywhere near to the effect that I will be doing in my margin account. And that's again, just going back to the fact that I need to maintain exposure in this really small account. So that is where we're looking right now. Next up will be if we find a good candidate, otherwise the portfolio will sit as is and will look to take in that 116 bucks, continue boosting the overall performance of the account. So right now I'm looking, we are just over one, two, three, three weeks into the into the small stacks account. We'll see what opportunity pops up and then otherwise we will hold tight. It's always if anybody's any questions or anything they want to talk about, let me know and I will catch everybody later.
