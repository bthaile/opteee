0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.00s: I wanted to do a quick update on the Small Stacks portfolio.
5.50s: And I've been a little bit more active in there than I was expecting to be
9.84s: primarily because I'm trying to balance two things in conjunction with one another.
14.24s: And that's reducing risk as much as I can
17.44s: as well as capitalizing on opportunity as I see it emerge.
22.44s: So in general, I would expect to really be quite a bit less involved than I have been.
30.20s: But I'm not opposed to making adjustments when I see that they're logical and they make sense.
36.46s: So let's jump over the screen and take a look.
38.60s: First off, I closed out Zinga.
40.64s: I sold that originally.
42.44s: It was eight and a half put, sold it out on one September.
46.20s: And I collect 27 cents.
48.04s: I close it for 18 cents.
49.28s: So it's overall P&L 9 bucks.
51.72s: Again, in this scenario, it's really nothing to write home about.
55.64s: It's essentially just commissions for a handful of trades or whatever.
60.04s: But if we look at things in kind of a vacuum and use percentages to guide some of our decisions,
70.08s: even closing that at 18 cents collecting $9, it's still over a percent return on the eight and a half put.
77.12s: So going back to that message, I continue to beat.
81.16s: This isn't the account that you're going to make a bunch of money with.
84.08s: It's turning $5,000, $10,000, $25,000, even $100,000 into a bunch of money isn't really in the cards for most folks.
92.88s: What we're really looking to do is build an approach that works.
97.88s: So for me, it was time to take those splits down because they were well within 20 days of expiration.
104.40s: And that's my typical window for wanting to close those trades to limit my exposure to gamma risk.
110.00s: So as soon as I saw a decent opportunity, I took it.
113.56s: And I would take it again and again because in this scenario, it's the right move for me.
118.96s: The other thing I did is I closed out of the bank of America, BAC, the diagonal I had in there.
126.28s: And the reason why I did that is because I wanted to establish a position in XLF, covered strangle.
132.56s: So I neutralized the BAC diagonal.
137.60s: And that was an overall PNL of positive 26 bucks.
142.04s: So, and it's not because I needed the money to open up XLF.
146.56s: It's just because I didn't want XLF, which is the financial sector ETF and BAC.
151.88s: So really the trade off there is moving from BAC to XLF, which is that sector ETF gives me more exposure.
162.36s: It helps limit some of that unsystemic risk.
166.76s: And as you can see, it's a really good return for the money.
170.24s: It's almost a 2% return, just shy of a 2% return on the capital tied up.
177.16s: So I really like that trade and doing a covered strangle and something like an index ETF is very appealing to me.
183.68s: Same thing with the sector ETF.
185.00s: So that's why I made that move.
186.16s: I didn't want to replicate financials.
188.84s: So where that puts us right now, oh yeah, and the other thing, sorry, is I ended up selling
196.12s: a call in CROGAR.
197.72s: So I had a good spot in there to lay out a call.
201.68s: My intention there is to probably add to the position if it still hovers around where it is right now.
208.92s: I was actually hoping it went just a little bit lower to add that other call, the long call.
214.60s: So it hasn't quite hit that threshold just yet as you can see.
218.88s: I should obviously we can look at things historically.
222.60s: What I was about to say is I should have added down here, but I was more or less expecting it to come down a little bit more.
228.60s: So I didn't want to sell or I didn't want to buy in during these updates.
232.76s: And I want to see what this down day turns into before I add additional capital to CROGAR.
239.48s: But I am looking at scaling into that that diagonal a little bit more.
246.36s: So we'll see we'll see what opportunity comes up.
249.20s: But for the meantime, I just have a short call out to turn it into that covered position and collect a little bit more money up front.
257.68s: So that's where I'm at in CROGAR.
261.20s: So looking at the portfolio at large, where 64% utilize, we have 3,600 in cash out total P&L so far, $616, which represents about 11% return since starting this on one September,
277.08s: which again, I'm really, really stoked on that.
279.20s: But there's an outlier.
280.52s: Pfizer was an outlier trade.
281.96s: It returned really well very quickly.
284.76s: So you can see the general performance of the other trades, $50 or $24 bucks, $9 bucks, $26 bucks.
292.60s: CROGAR is another high earner and you can see right now that the diagonals are far outperforming the covered strangle,
298.92s: which is why I like to diversify some of the strategies I'm using to benefit when they're working.
305.00s: Because there's a plenty of instances where the diagonal doesn't work well.
308.68s: We started seeing that in CROGAR as it fell below where I could reasonably sell calls and collect money.
314.24s: So I was essentially just holding the position.
316.80s: So that's where balancing between the two different approaches is it's a good way to go about it for me.
326.36s: So right now we have $116 and credit out, which represents another 2% return on the new on the entire portfolio.
337.24s: So overall, we're doing well.
340.20s: We went from $5,000 to $5616.
343.88s: So the account is growing and the most importantly, the mechanics are leading us in a good direction thus far.
353.60s: So what I'm looking to do going forward is I probably will stay away from the covered strangle.
362.56s: I'll leave XLF as that primary position for now.
365.88s: The reason is if I own stock in there, I'm okay with it and I'll collect the dividend turn into a cover call that sort of thing.
372.56s: But I want to be able to add more to it if I need to, although I wouldn't expect to.
377.36s: But what I would like to do is find another diagonal candidate.
381.92s: So that will be my homework for this evening to find something else that looks attractive for a diagonal.
388.04s: Luckily in markets right now, this is why I started making some of these moves because with some of the down moves in the market,
394.72s: it becomes very appealing for a diagonal and entering into short premium positions on some sort of down move.
403.20s: Unlike my margin account, I probably will not scale out of this very much leading into the election.
410.28s: Simply because it's such a small amount of capital that I would rather just maintain the exposure and write out the move.
417.84s: But I will take down at least half of the account.
422.12s: So I guess I am planning on scaling out just not anywhere near to the effect that I will be doing in my margin account.
429.52s: And that's again, just going back to the fact that I need to maintain exposure in this really small account.
434.88s: So that is where we're looking right now.
437.80s: Next up will be if we find a good candidate, otherwise the portfolio will sit as is and will look to take in that 116 bucks,
447.44s: continue boosting the overall performance of the account.
450.88s: So right now I'm looking, we are just over one, two, three, three weeks into the into the small stacks account.
462.08s: We'll see what opportunity pops up and then otherwise we will hold tight.
468.24s: It's always if anybody's any questions or anything they want to talk about, let me know and I will catch everybody later.
