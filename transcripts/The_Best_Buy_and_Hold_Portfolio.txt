0.64s: what's up to all the outliers eric here
2.64s: i'm gonna show you two market beating
4.16s: portfolios in less than seven minutes i
7.20s: had to pick seven because the last one
8.80s: ran a little long but i want to show you
11.04s: some good detail and most importantly
12.96s: how you can play with some different
14.56s: variables to find the portfolio that
17.68s: fits your risk to reward profile so
20.64s: whether you are a buy and hold investor
23.28s: just looking to set something up that
24.56s: you don't have to worry about and you
25.68s: can stop paying the mutual fund managers
28.96s: more than they deserve
30.40s: or if you're a trader like me especially
32.96s: for newer traders
34.64s: you don't know if trading is going to be
36.00s: a right fit for you you don't want to
37.68s: burn all your money trying to figure out
39.44s: if it's a right fit so setting up a buy
41.60s: and hold while you're paper trading
43.52s: learning to trade is a great approach
45.92s: and super efficient so with that let's
48.72s: dive straight in first off why buy and
51.28s: hold as i mentioned we know it works we
54.32s: know it works
56.00s: most traders fail statistically speaking
59.12s: so with that
61.04s: buy and hold should have a place in most
62.80s: people's portfolios and then the other
65.04s: cool thing as i was alluding to just
66.88s: before is
68.40s: it can be modular in nature meaning you
70.96s: can structure these to have different
73.44s: risk reward profiles based on what you
75.92s: want exposure to
77.68s: okay so let's get on to actually setting
80.24s: this thing up i'm assuming you have a
82.08s: broker picked out and you have an
83.52s: account opened up once that's happened
85.84s: you need to figure out the amount of
87.12s: money you're going to put into your
88.16s: account drop that in and then we're
90.08s: going to pick some tickers what we're
91.52s: going to do is split that principal
93.44s: amount between two buckets equity and
96.08s: debt
97.04s: i offer you a list of some different
99.12s: products here however i'm going to be
100.96s: focusing on a few of these in the
103.52s: following pieces now you can be as
106.88s: creative as you want and see what works
108.88s: for you even down to sector etfs or
111.76s: adding in individual stocks which might
114.16s: be a great idea for people with a little
116.96s: higher risk tolerance so
119.76s: with that let's get a look at the first
122.40s: portfolio here
124.48s: this is an 80 20 split between an equity
128.24s: etf and bonds the equity etfs that we're
132.08s: going to be looking at is spy
134.24s: iwm and qqq that's the s p 500 the
137.36s: russell 2000 and then the nasdaq
140.16s: and then down at the bottom we have a
141.60s: control which is the spy itself the s p
144.48s: 500 index etf
146.48s: now this study goes from 2003 until the
150.00s: end of april and there's some important
153.20s: data points i want to show you here the
155.52s: starting balance for all of them is ten
157.36s: thousand dollars i pick something that's
158.88s: easy to scale just do a little bit of
160.48s: math and you can see what this would be
161.84s: worth
162.88s: the final balance is what was the
164.96s: portfolio worth at the end of the study
166.96s: ideally we want this number to be higher
168.96s: means we're going to walk away with more
170.16s: money
171.04s: the kager compound annual growth rate is
173.68s: a super useful tool that tells you
176.00s: essentially how much you would be
177.28s: earning each year to end up with the
179.84s: principle from the initial balance
182.08s: then we have standard deviation
184.64s: this we tend to look for lower numbers
187.36s: meaning there's a lower variance in our
189.52s: returns more consistency and less
191.44s: volatility
193.12s: the best year we want that number to be
195.12s: higher this is the highest returning
196.88s: year against the worst year the lowest
199.04s: returning year for that portfolio
201.28s: the max drawdown is the worst drawdown
205.20s: that the portfolio faced meaning the
207.76s: most money it lost on a percentage basis
209.92s: throughout the life cycle of the entire
211.68s: study
212.56s: and then we're going to be focusing more
213.84s: on the sortino ratio which is a
217.04s: risk to risk reward assessment where
220.16s: we're focusing on how much good money
222.96s: are we making on bad risk or another way
225.76s: to think about it especially for the
227.44s: sortino ratio is the higher the sortino
230.32s: ratio is the more money we're making on
232.96s: the risk that we have out focusing on
235.36s: downside risk not just upside risk so
238.08s: the sortino ratio does not punish
240.40s: volatility necessarily where as sharp
243.60s: ratio tends to
245.44s: okay so with this you can see hands down
247.84s: the cues wins it walks out almost double
250.48s: the nearest competitor and it's the only
252.64s: one that actually beat the s p 500 but
255.52s: not all that glitters is gold it has a
259.28s: couple detractors compared to the other
262.08s: portfolios
263.44s: meaning that the worst year is worse
265.52s: than something like
267.20s: iwm tlt split things like that so we'll
270.72s: see a couple different comparisons in a
273.04s: minute
274.16s: so that you can get an idea of some how
276.88s: some of these different portfolios flush
278.40s: out against one another so on the top
280.72s: here i have a 100
283.04s: of the
284.48s: index etf compared to one another the
287.04s: only nuance to call out here is this is
289.84s: looking from 2001 to present so that's
292.88s: why you're gonna see a slightly
294.00s: different figure than these bottom two
295.52s: but i just wanted to give you a general
297.04s: idea in terms of best your worst year
298.72s: those kinds of things let's turn our
300.48s: attention down here though
302.08s: to the 80 20 and 60 40 split so the 80
305.20s: 20 is what you just saw and then the 60
307.44s: 40 takes instead of you know um
310.64s: 80 spy and
312.88s: 20 tlt down here it's 60 spy 40 tlt 60
318.00s: iwm so on and so forth so you'll notice
320.88s: a few things the final balances on all
323.52s: of these has come down however even this
326.32s: final balance 6040 of cues to tlt
330.56s: outperforms everything up here that's an
333.44s: important note
334.80s: the other thing to keep in mind is our
337.04s: compound annual growth rate is really
339.76s: healthy for this 60 40 split now a
343.04s: couple other things to note we see some
345.60s: difference in our standard deviations
347.44s: and max drawdowns so again for example
350.40s: this 60 40 tlt split comes in at a 12
354.48s: kagger compared to the
356.36s: 13.8 percent for the 80 20 but the max
360.24s: drawdown is actually quite a bit better
362.48s: the max drawdown for the 60 40 split is
365.44s: down 22 as compared to down 36 percent
369.12s: and then the same thing for the worst
370.48s: year we have a six percent better worst
373.28s: year for the 60 40 split however you'll
375.92s: also notice we have a six percent worse
379.36s: best year for the 60 40 split so what
382.08s: you'll notice is as you add more money
384.72s: to tlt
386.00s: we're going to expect a few things we're
388.48s: going to expect our kaggar to go down
390.56s: we're going to expect our standard
391.76s: deviation to decrease we're going to
394.08s: expect our best year to decrease we're
396.88s: going to expect our best year to get
399.68s: better and we're going to expect our max
402.48s: drawdown to also get better so i want to
405.84s: leave you with two ideas
408.56s: the top portfolio here i call it the 25s
411.44s: which is 25 spy iwm and qqq
415.92s: and then 25 tlt and then the bottom is
418.72s: that same portfolio i've showed you a
420.24s: couple times the eighty percent cues
422.48s: against twenty percent tlt
424.64s: this is kind of set up in a heat map way
428.24s: so that you can get a sense for what
430.40s: risk reward profile works best for you
433.04s: the reason why i offer you this is tech
435.52s: might not be hot forever and that is a
438.48s: primary reason why you're seeing the
440.48s: queues just being far and beyond
443.28s: everything else tech has been so hot so
446.88s: if you are still on that same thought
449.44s: process cool there's a great portfolio
451.36s: for you if not i offer you this other
453.84s: portfolio that also beats the market
456.16s: with lower standard deviation a better
458.48s: worst year in a better max drawdown
461.12s: doesn't quite outperform the 80 20 q's
463.52s: portfolio
464.40s: but again maybe in a different market it
466.48s: would so let me know what you think and
468.64s: if you enjoy this kind of content make
470.40s: sure you subscribe and like the video so
472.80s: that we can emerge in the youtube
474.24s: algorithm and get some more people into
476.16s: the outlier community and i look forward
478.80s: to catching you all later be an outlier
