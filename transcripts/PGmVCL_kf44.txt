0.00s: A bit of a hectic market today.
1.80s: I want to talk through a couple of broader concepts on what I saw going on today to share
6.20s: with you all.
7.40s: And then I want to take a look specifically at a handful of questions I got on GameStop.
12.40s: As I'm always happy to look and share what I can see with you all.
16.40s: So what happened today?
17.80s: A couple things.
18.80s: The major thing I noticed was this broad rotation in movement of capital because if we
25.60s: take a look across the primary indices, the SPX literally gaped down.
30.44s: That's not crazy, but it's not common.
32.88s: If you go back through this chart and you look for periods where this is over the last six
36.80s: months where it actually gaped down like this, it's not super frequent that it makes those
42.32s: kinds of movements.
43.32s: The SPX spy, whichever you want to use, it tends to be a little slower than that.
48.52s: So we were at a just crazy high level.
53.48s: I wouldn't start freaking out when you see something come off a high and go into a consolidation.
60.12s: That's a very normal behavior.
61.84s: I feel like sometimes people get so used to things kind of going this parabolic up that
66.80s: we forget that there are other directions.
69.48s: So that's one thing I saw.
71.16s: The other thing I saw was when I look across technology using the NASDAQ as a proxy, it
76.56s: took way more of the front.
79.32s: And that's probably because tech has been so focused on for so long that this is no
87.04s: surprise to me.
88.96s: Everything within tech essentially needs to exceed extremely high expectations.
94.72s: So this also looks like something that probably needs to consolidate in base for a little
99.92s: while in order to shake out the weekends, getting some new money and to base appropriately
105.68s: for a solid foundation.
107.68s: To me, it doesn't look like, okay, tech is falling off a cliff and everybody that has exposure
114.44s: to tech has screwed, nothing like that.
115.92s: But this does look like it is entering a consolidation period.
118.80s: This is not an insignificant gap down.
121.00s: I flattened out my teachable cues position today because it ran through a bunch of my
124.64s: zones.
126.16s: And then the other thing I want to show is the Russell because it is showing relative strength.
132.56s: So everything else gaped down today.
134.48s: This did not.
135.88s: It's partly because in my opinion, the Russell is playing catch up.
139.96s: It has been so lazy on the year compared to everything else until we started getting
144.56s: a change of rate cut environment, things like that, which sent it up and off into the
149.72s: moon to catch up.
151.56s: So that's why in my opinion, we're not necessarily seeing the kind of rotation across here.
157.08s: All right.
158.08s: So that's enough from a broad market perspective.
160.12s: I really want to talk about some of these GME updates because there's some interesting
164.76s: things going on with a down date today.
168.36s: Crazy, right?
169.84s: So right now, GameStop closed down 1.96% and after hours, it's trading around 2760.
177.88s: So about another 40, 30, 40 cents lower than where it sits right now.
182.96s: This also looks normal to me.
184.80s: It's not surprising to me at all to see GameStop come down today when the broad market was
189.16s: down.
190.16s: That's not to say GameStop.
191.52s: GameStop couldn't go up because it can when the whole market's down because I always
198.16s: endeavor to remind everybody this, it behaves differently.
201.88s: What I mean by that is say, for example, you're looking at another sector.
205.48s: Let's say you're looking at the financial sector and you're looking at stuff like Wells Fargo,
210.40s: City Group, you're looking at Bank of America, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley.
216.76s: If you look at that basket of stocks off of them, let's say financials are going down
220.76s: writ large.
222.00s: The probability of one of them being up when the rest of the basket is down is not impossible,
227.84s: but it's pretty low.
229.08s: That's not common at all.
230.92s: It's the same thing for GameStop.
232.24s: A rising tide lifts all boats and if we have a waning tide, it tends to pull things down
238.40s: in mass.
239.72s: So there were segments of strength today, but they were confined.
244.12s: It was not strong across the board by any means, obviously.
248.16s: So to see GameStop come down a little bit today, to me seems completely normal.
251.44s: It's been on an up move, essentially from the first of July.
254.56s: It's just been moving up.
256.56s: The other thing I want to highlight, if we move in closer is that if you look at the S&P
262.72s: 500, it gapped down.
264.88s: If you look at GameStop, it didn't gap down.
267.28s: It's essentially just an inside candle here relative to the previous day.
270.96s: So on a relative basis, this is actually showing strength, which is hilarious because
276.00s: how often would you consider finding strength in GameStop compared to the S&P 500, which
282.16s: today technically it was?
284.16s: The other thing I notice here is the volume.
286.80s: We still have higher than average volume over the past two weeks.
291.08s: Most of it was sale volume, but price didn't really crater that much.
297.12s: That's telling to me because there was definitely selling pressure today, but GameStop didn't
301.76s: capitulate to it and it's kind of hanging out here.
305.24s: So this doesn't look bad to me at all.
308.12s: This looks like it might be consolidating a little bit, which again, it's completely
311.84s: normal for products to go through these consolidation phases.
315.16s: It's important for them to do that.
317.48s: So there's that.
318.48s: And I know that there was a lot of excitement today.
320.28s: A couple of people were asking me about the thesis.
323.92s: I guess there was some dude on Reddit somewhere that was referencing access to like a Bloomberg
329.64s: terminal is some sort of like Oracle of information and that today was supposed to be a big
333.52s: day.
334.52s: Let's break that down.
336.84s: The first thing in trading is you're going to come across this all the time.
339.72s: This appeal to authority.
341.20s: I know somebody that's a market maker.
342.84s: I know somebody that's out of prop firm.
344.36s: I know this.
345.36s: I know that.
346.36s: I have this tool.
347.36s: I have that tool.
348.36s: That's not to say you should ever dismiss those data points.
349.88s: There's still viable data points.
352.32s: They're not necessarily the arbiter of truth or some sort of forcing function that's
359.12s: really unique to that scenario.
361.24s: It's not never the case, but it's rarely the case.
364.44s: Especially if it's something like GameStop, the longer I look at this, the more I find,
367.96s: there's tons of people trying to make guesses about when we're going to see some sort of
372.60s: big move because it's fun, right?
374.96s: But the problem with that is you can come across a lot of really convincing arguments that
380.84s: just don't pan out because the market doesn't care.
383.28s: The market doesn't care how good a hypothesis is.
386.00s: To see these kinds of moves, you need very specific conditions to emerge.
390.36s: And sometimes they're very difficult to pick up on ahead of time.
393.56s: I definitely didn't top tick any of these.
395.44s: I didn't get into this at 10 and I would add 6483.
399.28s: It's super difficult to do that kind of stuff.
401.60s: So what I would recommend to people is the digestion of information is good.
408.08s: Eating open to information is good.
410.16s: But coming out and then asking, which I literally had people send me different snippets of,
416.20s: I didn't see the post, but different snippets about that post.
419.24s: And they're asking if they should buy super far out of the money, short term calls for
423.64s: this week, predicated on that information.
426.16s: Would you probably already know my response to that?
427.76s: I chuckle because it's hilarious.
429.48s: I think like what a difficult way to make money in this business long term doing something
433.72s: like that is so low probability.
436.40s: But I always go back to you got to do what's right for you.
438.52s: But what I would encourage people to do is be receptive to information, always be skeptical,
444.72s: healthy skeptical, meaning requiring a certain level of validation.
448.60s: So for example, Bloomberg terminals are really cool.
450.52s: I've messed with them for a long time.
451.72s: There's a lot of great data in there.
453.36s: There's nothing magical in there.
455.00s: There's no secret edge that's baked into a Bloomberg terminal.
458.36s: There's literally thousands of people that are on there every day looking for them.
463.08s: So for example, I know that they were referencing swaps.
465.84s: You can see the swaps.
467.08s: So we know that they're there.
469.00s: It's not this insanely impactful insider information that nobody knows.
474.84s: It's somebody that's talking to the CEO that knows that there's going to be some sort of
478.76s: big merger acquisition.
480.16s: It's nothing like that, right?
481.64s: It's still generally publicly available information.
483.72s: Yeah, you have to pay for the Bloomberg terminal.
485.52s: But anybody could get one if you're so inclined.
487.76s: It's just like what 20 grand a year.
490.00s: So all I'm going back to is be open to information, be skeptical, but to try and bet your life savings
499.28s: on these slew of different calls that we see coming out, difficult to do.
505.24s: You got to do a try for you.
506.40s: That's the name and the nature of being a trader.
509.12s: But it just kills me.
510.12s: That's why I'm obviously talking about it is because I don't want to see people lighting
514.44s: money on fire chasing things.
516.88s: And for some people, this might be the last $5,000 that they can invest.
521.16s: And then they're going to throw it in super fire out of the money's yellows for this week.
525.40s: It's like, I just hate to see that.
527.28s: I would love to see people taking a slightly more pragmatic approach to this to hopefully
532.36s: see some success in this long term because you do get moves in GameStop.
536.08s: GameStop does move.
537.08s: That's one of the cool things about it.
538.08s: It even moves now.
539.44s: Some people are not missing or fully appreciating the fact and are missing the fact that from the
545.56s: first of July until yesterday is up like 20%.
549.88s: That's in like two weeks.
551.00s: That's a that's still a respectable move.
553.80s: That's not insignificant.
556.08s: So all of that to summarize is just be thoughtful.
560.28s: Pay attention to what makes sense for you.
563.00s: Digest information, but always be careful about overweating data from other people and
568.60s: be careful to fall too quickly online with appeals to authority that can mislead your
575.32s: decision cycle.
576.32s: I think that's where I would leave that.
578.44s: So let's take a look now at the options.
580.80s: We did see a big trade come through.
584.56s: We have 3,000 of the 26 July 30 calls.
590.00s: These came in closer to the bid.
592.44s: So the market was 226 by 235.
595.28s: So it's a little closer to the bid side, which would infer likely a sale.
600.52s: My guess is these are some sort of covered calls.
602.84s: That's my best guess here.
604.60s: And this looks interesting to me, but it's nothing to write home about because it's
611.40s: one.
612.56s: Now if we start seeing more of these coming in, then you could make some guesses about
617.00s: who that could be.
619.00s: But right now this is somebody that has probably a decent stock position that's selling shares
624.20s: or selling options against it.
626.36s: And it's still a big stock position potentially.
629.88s: But it's a little early to decipher too much other than the fact that this is something
634.36s: to be aware of.
635.36s: That's the way I look at that kind of thing.
638.52s: Looking out at total volume today, it was very high.
642.20s: 312,000 calls against 67,000 puts.
648.76s: Very heavy call volume going on here.
651.68s: The vast majority of it still is right in here at the 30s.
656.56s: 19 July 24 30s are on fire.
661.20s: They're so active.
663.00s: Hey, I saw a couple of those today.
665.04s: So oh yeah, I forgot to update you guys.
667.16s: I typically don't like talking about my positions.
668.88s: I don't want it to be about my positions.
670.88s: It doesn't matter to anybody.
672.68s: I don't want to mislead anybody's conscious or subconscious processing based on what I'm
678.12s: doing.
679.12s: But these are some short calls that are able to move up from the 29s.
684.08s: And the market being the market, the perpetual comedian that it always is, it has this really
688.96s: interesting ability to make everybody wrong at the same time, even if they have opposing
693.00s: positions.
694.28s: And this, my 29s were like in the money at the money.
697.20s: And then as soon as I rolled them out here for a slight profit, then we dropped below
701.80s: 28.
702.80s: Perfect.
703.80s: Love that for me.
705.60s: So sick.
706.60s: But these are still just against both long options and long shares.
713.36s: This is, well, I'm part of this volume party today, except my volume will actually
718.64s: decrease potentially, well, on this, the 29s, my volume will decrease the OI because
725.96s: I was closing my positions out.
728.12s: But these are very active.
730.20s: The 30s still have 77,580 OI with 48,000 transacted today.
736.80s: That's a really, really busy, really busy strike with 7,000 OI added net over yesterday.
743.76s: So these are getting very active.
745.96s: Lots of interest in them.
747.72s: So the facility is up in these without a doubt, 212%.
752.28s: But right now that just looks like standard high game stop volume that doesn't look like
758.68s: anything that I'm looking at as really anomalous here for the product.
764.16s: It's anomalous in general compared to normal products, I should say.
767.80s: But for this so far, it's not crazy.
771.40s: We see the puts going off the shelf as they always do.
775.72s: This is very normal.
777.72s: And this doesn't surprise me.
779.44s: It's grossly outrunning the calls though.
782.20s: When we were seeing a lot more of that bullish vol skew to the calls, the calls literally
786.96s: were outpacing the puts.
788.88s: But that's not what we're seeing now.
790.60s: So the market is not heavily pricing in vol on the call side.
794.56s: It is pricing in vol heavily on the put side.
798.08s: So the last thing I want to talk about was another question I got about these spreads.
801.88s: So people were talking about, hey, there was a bunch of puts that traded yesterday.
807.84s: And there was.
809.16s: But these were seemingly part of spreads.
813.24s: So that matters because it exhibits a little bit less conviction than had they been single
819.08s: trades.
820.08s: The whole point of trading verticals is to decrease the sensitivity of the position.
825.16s: And the positions that I saw got put on were really interesting.
828.36s: It looked like a mix of 40s, 45s and 50s.
833.80s: So what I mean by that is if we take a look at these series, right, you can see that there's
837.80s: a bunch of 30s that came through at the 40 puts.
842.60s: And then you can see that there's blocks of 15s that came through at the 45s.
847.80s: So if I sort these by time, you'll see a few things.
851.76s: You'll see that a lot of these traded around one another near the same time as they were
857.24s: being filled.
858.60s: The other thing is if you click these little arrows, they're really useful here actually.
862.00s: They help us identify things.
864.24s: So for example, I can see 15 of the 40 puts came through at the mid.
869.80s: And then I can see 15 of the 45 puts came through at the bid at the same exact time at
875.00s: the same exact size.
876.72s: That again, tells me that these two are overwhelmingly likely tied to one another.
881.72s: And it looks like a 40, 45 put spread.
885.16s: And for these, if the bid is at the 45, that means we're selling this one, the 45s, the
891.60s: further in the money in this case, and then we're buying the closer to the money, we're
895.84s: buying the 40s.
897.80s: So if you click this, it'll show you what it thinks it's tied to.
900.88s: You can kind of link the sizes pretty clearly.
904.16s: And yeah, so it's still a big position.
906.96s: There was a ton of them that got hit.
909.76s: I don't think it's quite as exciting as some people thought it was based on somebody
914.64s: buying up the entire chain or selling the entire chain.
918.16s: They're spreads.
919.32s: But still, if we take a look at the way that these look, if you're long the 40s and you
925.40s: are short the 45s, I'll model that trade for you.
930.04s: Looks a little bit like this.
931.60s: So really it's a bullish trade.
933.92s: It wants the underlying to go up, but it needs to move in order for them to really start
940.14s: making money.
941.52s: The positive to this is it does have downside risk protection.
947.24s: There's a lot of things you can read into with a position like this.
949.76s: It's very interesting to me because it's not the purest expression of an idea.
954.48s: It's a sizable trade.
956.24s: It's inefficient to trade them via vertical spreads as compared to single options and
960.00s: sizing down.
961.28s: You never know what's going on in the rest of the book.
964.36s: You never know what else is going on, what else to surf the hedge.
968.76s: It's difficult to tell.
970.76s: But this is definitely an informed trader.
973.44s: You don't trade something at this size by happenstance, by just slinging something.
977.76s: So there's an idea here, but we just can't really fully look into it.
982.60s: I just wanted to make sure everybody knows though that this isn't some sort of massive
986.96s: buying or selling of options.
988.36s: It's actually both.
989.36s: It's a vertical spread.
990.92s: So that's that.
991.92s: All right, you guys.
993.68s: So we have a couple days left into expiration and we are eagerly waiting to see what's
1000.16s: going on here.
1001.92s: Overall, it looks like the options positioning is standard, I would say.
1007.92s: Meaning I'm not seeing a bunch of super crazy volatility, but I'm also not seeing any.
1014.72s: I'm not seeing crazy skew just yet.
1017.84s: So this looks like a little bit of a let's see how it goes scenarios.
1022.96s: So as always, if you have any questions or anything you want me to take a look at, let
1025.96s: me know, be an outlier.
1026.96s: See you guys later.
