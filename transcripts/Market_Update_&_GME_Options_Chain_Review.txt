0.68s: what's up outliers quick update video
2.92s: before our YouTube live stream today at
5.76s: 5:00 P p.m. Pacific time in a couple
7.12s: hours want to walk through the markets
8.60s: at a high level it'll be a quick video
11.20s: because not a lot happen today there's a
13.96s: couple small things that I want to point
15.68s: out I want to take a stroll through gme
18.48s: specifically as per usual keeping that
20.12s: on the Cadence a lot of people are
21.76s: interested in staying up to date on the
23.60s: options chain there so we'll do that and
26.12s: yeah should be a pretty simple one here
28.60s: now I got to say hello from the other
30.80s: side because now I'm on this side of the
32.40s: screen per the recommendation of one of
34.68s: our Discord members which was probably
37.00s: the simplest recommendation on planet
38.88s: Earth that makes such a tremendous
40.76s: amount of sense so that I'm now not in
42.68s: the way of things so you guys will have
45.60s: to find something else to not be happy
47.92s: about in the videos so I mean we'll see
50.24s: what you guys come up with there's
51.12s: always something I suppose so what do we
54.04s: want to talk about the main thing is
55.92s: this S&P 500 and the q's did nothing
60.00s: today it was a completely flat boring
63.12s: day with these tiny little baby candles
65.52s: that just are not moving much iwm
69.04s: however continued to diverge this is
72.52s: important the reason why it's important
74.56s: is take a look at where spy landed take
77.12s: a look at where Q's landed and then take
79.32s: a look at where iwm landed iwm is now
84.60s: essentially at the close that it saw on
87.56s: the 6th the other two indices are still
91.56s: above they're still rallying although
94.48s: they've contracted a bit this is
96.12s: important the other thing is the S&P 500
99.64s: as an index with the percentage of
102.00s: stocks Above This is using their 50-day
104.56s: moving average his cratered even though
107.44s: this didn't move quite that much so I
110.56s: interpret most of this as under the top
114.52s: level
115.60s: rotation and small caps are still seeing
118.28s: the brunt of it the other thing I
120.28s: noticed is take a look at the sale
122.36s: volume today in iwm as compared the sale
126.80s: volume in spy in Q's you can see kind of
129.88s: how much of that candle or I guess the
132.04s: bar down here is consumed in red and in
135.00s: this case it's the majority so if we
137.16s: take a look at iwm quickly specifically
140.32s: we can see the exact number which was
142.48s: 75% sale volume so heavy sale volume
146.56s: today hovering right around this point
149.32s: of control this is an important level
151.52s: for me this is also why I do not have
154.40s: any sort of long position right now on
156.08s: small caps even though I do still find
158.52s: them interesting and I think that
160.12s: there's still opportunity for them but I
162.72s: think as it sits right now it's just not
165.68s: great and I need to see what it's going
167.76s: to do now one other admin note is
170.84s: variance risk premium plays are still
173.04s: coming in literally beautifully and I
176.64s: noticed that because we can see it even
179.36s: here in the Russell where Varan premiums
183.40s: have just spiked essentially from the
185.96s: 9th to the 12th this is just expanding
190.08s: very meaningfully and this is the
191.92s: shortterm vrp is moving quite a lot so
195.68s: I'm still trading zeros I'm still using
197.68s: SPX myself but another great opportunity
201.56s: here inside iwm now as far as SPX I'm
205.60s: running a couple positions in here I got
207.92s: filled on some box spreads I can tell
211.16s: you what it was it's the 30 a
215.40s: 56000 strikes for
218.28s: 997 so those are a th000 point wide and
222.28s: they have 18 days to expiration right
225.20s: now the percent annual yield for the
228.40s: duration of that trade is 6.08
231.00s: one% with fees included it's like plus
235.88s: 0.71% over the current risk free rate
238.52s: for the same time frame so just a way to
241.32s: put money to work while I am keeping an
244.64s: eye on things this is uh there's a
247.20s: really cool tool that well it's kind of
248.92s: simple let's not Church it up Eric it's
251.08s: a very basic Excel sheet but I like it
253.52s: it's cool and you can access it if you
256.04s: want there's a video that I did if you
257.48s: literally just type in box spreads
259.08s: you'll probably see it pop up because
260.60s: not a lot of people are talking about
261.84s: that stuff it's kind of boring but it's
263.40s: a big part of what I do with capital
265.32s: that's otherwise sitting on the
266.44s: sidelines because in this case my money
268.56s: is going to earn again
270.84s: 6.81% annualized return that's not the
273.24s: total return on the trade as it goes out
276.48s: that's really important to note that's
279.40s: annualized the return on invested
281.44s: Capital will be much lower than that but
283.40s: it's doing something in the time frame
286.52s: that we're working because right now the
288.04s: current risk-free rate is for a one
290.76s: month is
292.44s: 537 so and it tailors down from there
295.76s: two months is 5 295 and so on and so
298.60s: forth so rates are chilling out a little
301.00s: bit there are still some kinks in the
303.60s: structure so 3E is at 3843 5 year is at
309.12s: 3758 and then 7 year is at 3805 so five
313.76s: is depressed compared to the three and
317.56s: the Seven you can trade those kinds of
319.24s: relationships too but kind of a boring
321.24s: trade not what I'm looking at right now
323.52s: myself okay so that's that now let's
325.92s: pivot over to
328.04s: gme G m e that sounded like g m didn't
334.32s: mean that meant gme and uh I mean you
338.64s: literally can't even see the volume
340.52s: which is unfortunate it's just so light
344.20s: volume we're not we're really just not
347.44s: seeing much happening here so the
350.64s: percent buy volume for today is 52
352.64s: versus 48% on the sales side total
356.40s: volume was 4.4 million against 10.4
359.08s: million so just anemic volume now one
361.88s: admin note is I know a lot of people
364.48s: talk about the dark pool volume and how
366.92s: you don't really get to see the actual
368.84s: volume there's just an important
371.16s: difference between dark pool ATS
374.16s: transactions versus transactions that
376.28s: are internalized they're kind of
378.24s: different things so with dark poool
380.28s: orders they still will hit the
382.24s: Consolidated tape it's just delayed if
385.08s: it's internalized that will not hit the
387.20s: tape you're not going to see that so if
389.08s: orders there's heavy internalization of
391.72s: orders you're not going to see any of
393.24s: the follow through and that's one of the
394.88s: problems with GameStop and I actually
397.36s: don't know to what degree the orders are
399.60s: being internalized and if anybody has
401.60s: good research on that I genuinely would
403.68s: love to be able to take a look at it if
405.68s: you have access to it let me know so
407.72s: that I can take a peek throw it in the
409.48s: comments below because I'm very
411.12s: interested in that question because we
413.08s: know that for GameStop the off exchange
415.20s: volume is massive however if we take a
418.56s: look at the off Exchange volume today
420.36s: was
422.20s: 47.64 and the 30-day average is 52 so a
425.76s: little bit lighter than that now again
427.76s: the problem with this is we don't
429.60s: actually know of this off exchange
433.20s: volume how much of it is internalized
435.76s: versus not in this case obviously I
437.80s: would assume not internalized because we
440.40s: have a number but this then doesn't help
443.36s: us understand what the total volume is
445.40s: that's been internalized so yeah I would
448.04s: be interested in exploring that that
449.72s: problem set a little bit more and
450.92s: learning more about it myself because I
453.16s: do find that to be an interesting
454.84s: potential problem when we're looking at
456.40s: the reporting in something like GameStop
458.88s: now let's take a quick look over at the
461.76s: options chain and there's a few things I
464.52s: want to highlight first off volume very
467.60s: light less than 100,000 calls against
470.20s: 21,000 puts now it is again good to see
472.92s: such a disparity between calls and puts
475.32s: most of it is centralized in this
476.88s: expiration cycle so we are still seeing
479.60s: a ton of volume in this front expiration
483.12s: cycle so as we take a closer look at the
486.36s: existing open interest it's
489.20s: 6699 to 337 so again this is also good
493.28s: that the calls are being built out more
494.80s: and more and we are seeing some of these
498.56s: other expiration Cycles being built out
501.16s: alongside of it however the majority of
504.48s: what I'm seeing so far indicates kind of
507.12s: a a quiet week two weeks ahead from an
511.24s: options perspective that doesn't mean
512.52s: that the stock can't pop off as soon as
514.56s: there's a catalyst that's what makes it
516.32s: special and do what it does but there's
518.48s: just not a lot of positioning expecting
520.76s: that as compared to what I saw when I
522.32s: originally got into GameStop towards the
524.32s: end of April early May so we can still
528.24s: see a bunch of net ads coming in so
530.44s: people are still building into these
531.96s: positions which is not super surprising
534.72s: and these 50s are getting hit pretty
537.28s: heavy so there's 1869 four with 6,000
541.68s: added over the last trading day another
543.44s: 1,600 traded today you can see that
545.64s: there's just a lot of volume on these
548.12s: near the money options and again this
551.16s: goes back into this is a tough way to
552.92s: make money and these are swimming
555.24s: Upstream because they need a big move
557.24s: very quick in order for them to really
559.48s: show a profit now these have a little
562.32s: bit more of a padding because Theta
564.56s: Decay on these is like 10 cents 9 cents
566.72s: against something that's 64 65 cents
570.92s: total or maybe you know 45 cents for
573.56s: these 22 halfs that's still a massive
576.08s: percentage of the remaining premium
577.80s: that's bleeding out from Theta de K
579.92s: which is kind of problematic you really
581.52s: need to move quick in order for this to
583.08s: make sense what I see also of interest
587.20s: is V has collapsed essentially across
591.32s: the entire options chain we only see
594.44s: slightly elevated VA in 13 in 20 step
598.88s: expiration cycles and it has earnings on
602.56s: four which is really important to me
606.12s: because I would expect this expiration
608.96s: cycle the 6p expiration cycle to be much
611.68s: higher than it is relative to 13 and 20
615.60s: the fact that 13 and 20 are higher than
617.72s: six and six is the expiration cycle that
620.00s: includes the release at least as it's
622.04s: scheduled right now here forth before
623.84s: the market is fascinating to me that is
626.08s: an anomaly that's not normal you do not
627.92s: see that frequently which again can't
630.28s: help but find that interesting now
632.36s: looking across I didn't see anything
633.92s: jump out at me in terms of TNS time and
636.16s: sales there's a glorious mix of
638.28s: positions going out there's a mix of
640.56s: expiration Cycles from 16 a 23 a kind of
644.20s: again standard fair but most of these
646.08s: are really small positions right so the
648.16s: 125s 334 trade went out but they're
651.00s: trading for two pennies the bigger
652.68s: trades are kind of these that have a
654.60s: higher price sometimes I like sorting by
656.80s: them not to see a million Naas that's
659.56s: actually kind of annoying I don't even
661.28s: know why they put them in here but it's
663.16s: to find these These are the bigger
664.84s: traits you can see most of these are
667.00s: kind of deeper in the monies and we
669.44s: still see those far out in time 125s
673.20s: getting pinged off a little bit can't
675.84s: help but find that interesting some of
677.92s: these still look like the other side of
680.52s: the trade that looked like originally
682.44s: sold these so because there was a a
686.04s: fairly large position over 1 million
687.72s: notional value that that started hitting
689.72s: these but yeah most of the trades that
692.12s: are at any reasonable size are not so at
697.84s: not at really high prices is what I'm
699.36s: trying to say there so if I switch this
701.88s: minimum quantity being like a 25 lot
704.60s: something again uh let's do 10 lot
706.88s: actually because sometimes people I
708.16s: notied move blocks of 10 in here and if
710.76s: we look at minimum 10 we're not seeing a
712.96s: bunch of these now these again further
715.24s: out in time people building longer term
717.00s: positions what make which makes sense in
719.88s: here but yeah nothing jumping out of me
722.88s: today so that's all I got for this one
725.32s: as always if there's anything you want
726.44s: me to take a look at please send it to
727.76s: me love taking a look doing my best to
729.36s: help you guys out and also learn
731.28s: alongside of you all and then I'll see
733.60s: you on the YouTube live session later
735.32s: today be an outlier see you guys later
