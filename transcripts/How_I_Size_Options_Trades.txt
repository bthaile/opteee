0.12s: how can you logically size your options
3.20s: trades this video is designed to dive
5.80s: directly into that topic and to cover
8.68s: three main topics why you should care
10.76s: about this the process that I use and
13.56s: then some best practices at the end for
15.72s: you to consider because like most things
18.68s: trading options the devil's in the
20.80s: details so if you want to apply a RIT
24.44s: large all trades are sized at 6% you can
27.76s: do that you're going to have issues with
29.80s: that for a bunch of different reasons
32.36s: which I'll show you why the other thing
34.32s: is if you just size off of how you feel
37.56s: that's another set of issues which we're
39.24s: going to talk about that as well what's
40.40s: up everybody Eric here welcome back to
41.80s: the outliers shout out to the patreon
44.24s: family consider joining and if not you
46.60s: should at least hop in our free Discord
48.28s: it's another cool spot to hang out let's
50.52s: talk about this in a nutshell so why are
53.64s: we doing this well here's a deal if we
55.40s: take a look at these different
57.00s: utilization levels let's say you have a
59.24s: single strategy and in that single
61.28s: strategy on Monday in January you size
65.36s: at 1% then in February 6% that at the
69.16s: end of February on a Thursday it's 2% so
71.80s: on and so forth what I'm highlighting
73.68s: here is that if it is just a shotgun
75.96s: blast of sizing there's nothing that you
79.36s: can logically project the performance
82.40s: you could rationally come up with an
84.68s: average and then use that the issue with
87.32s: that is you might find this 29% kind of
90.76s: scenario could actually lead to enough
93.04s: draw down that you then couldn't put
94.92s: this trade on anymore so you can't
97.28s: approach sizing trades haphazardly so
100.64s: what does the process look like for me I
102.84s: try to keep it straightforward I start
104.80s: with looking at the portfolio as you
107.20s: probably would imagine now when I'm
109.72s: doing this I'm making sure that I'm
112.56s: defining the objectives for what I'm
115.56s: looking to add what this means is if
118.24s: your goal is to AG aggressively grow
120.80s: your portfolio guess what that means you
123.28s: probably need to use most of it most of
125.28s: the time you do not have the luxury of
127.60s: sitting 30% cash waiting for things to
130.48s: pop up again depending on your trading
132.60s: style maybe that actually does fit in
135.04s: which we'll get into in a little bit but
136.60s: in general if you're trying to
137.96s: aggressively grow your portfolio you
139.64s: have to be pretty aggressive with your
140.72s: utilization same thing with the
142.84s: subsequent sizing of your positions and
145.00s: it's the inverse is true if you are
147.52s: looking to reduce variance in your
150.32s: portfolio returns then maybe you're not
152.88s: sizing things quite as large because you
155.16s: want to keep more on the side so that
157.08s: you're not experiencing the same
159.20s: variance this is why after you look at
161.60s: your portfolio defining these objectives
163.64s: is a non-negotiable part of the process
166.64s: once we do that this is when I actually
169.96s: start the process of sizing a position
174.08s: and it's relatively straightforward I'm
176.28s: going to start by looking at how this
178.60s: trade fits into a portfolio folio I'm
180.48s: going to understand what my hypothesis
182.88s: is for this trade what the corresponding
186.08s: strategy is from there this will lead me
189.76s: to however much money I'm going to
192.80s: allocate to the position and I have an
194.80s: example that walks through this to give
196.56s: you some numbers to help you follow
198.88s: along and create your own ideas from the
201.32s: allocation so let's say I have a
203.36s: strategy that's going to get 10% of my
205.76s: money then I'm going to look at the
207.92s: initial outlay so of this allocation I'm
211.12s: going to set aside X number of dollars
213.00s: for this trade in its entirety then I'm
215.08s: going to say of this amount of money I'm
217.32s: going to use a smaller subset upfront to
220.24s: gain my initial exposure then I'm going
223.32s: to keep some residual amount of money so
226.00s: that I can add more risk to the strategy
229.44s: based on whatever that strategy is again
232.40s: we'll get into a couple examples in just
233.96s: a minute once I finish this process I am
236.92s: going to then validate whatever I came
240.08s: up with this means I'm going to review
242.56s: the allocation I'm going to review the
244.60s: corresponding strategy make sure it fits
247.12s: with my disposition towards the stock
249.00s: market make sure that it fits within the
251.04s: portfolio and what else is in the
252.92s: portfolio I want to make sure that I
255.16s: have one final sanity check so this is
257.36s: the process in a nutshell so now the
259.64s: natural question is okay well then how
262.36s: much should we allocate per trade how
264.84s: much should we use in an outlay how much
267.88s: should we set aside for scale scaling
270.20s: and these are important questions so
272.04s: let's take a look at a sample portfolio
273.96s: in this case we have a $100,000
275.96s: proverbial portfolio I split my
278.64s: portfolio into two buckets you do not
280.88s: have to do this so I bring that up front
283.48s: so that you understand the lens I'm
285.28s: applying here I have a core allocation
287.28s: and a speculative allocation to my
288.80s: portfolios if this concept is completely
291.28s: foreign to you I will throw a link in
293.16s: the notes below that walks through this
295.64s: but it doesn't really matter you can
297.72s: literally get rid of this in entirety if
300.56s: you were so inclined and you could just
302.28s: say I have a $100,000 portfolio then you
305.20s: could determine how you want to size
306.56s: positions off of that there's a couple
308.28s: things to keep in mind now for me for
310.80s: the core allocation of a portfolio I
313.92s: tend to accept larger position sizes so
317.36s: this is using a generic answer up to 70%
322.32s: of the portfolio can be in the core of
325.32s: that 70% all of it can be into one
328.48s: position if I am so inclined this is not
332.48s: 70% of the 70% I'm using it as a total
335.88s: of the portfolio to keep this easier to
338.08s: follow along for everybody so what does
339.76s: this mean well this means that if I'm
341.36s: trading something like the coverage
343.48s: strangle in iwm I might allocate all
347.60s: $70,000 of the core allocation to it I
350.32s: might you don't have to do that you can
352.12s: find whatever numbers make sense for you
354.52s: this is how I tend to split the
355.80s: portfolio between core and speculative
357.96s: if I were not to do this then I would
361.04s: treat most of the positions as
363.32s: speculative there's a couple ways you
364.96s: have to think about this and the way
366.88s: that I tend to apply sizing if I'm
370.04s: meeting my return objectives with the
372.04s: core allocation I will give this more
374.20s: money if I'm not meaning let's say ID
377.00s: iwm is not doing well or if the Market's
379.36s: going down and the coverage strangles
381.16s: are not performing well then I'm going
383.32s: to size up the speculative allocation of
386.84s: the portfolio in this case I might
389.56s: reduce this up to 60% of the portfolio
392.80s: and keep the remainder in the core you
395.04s: have to find what metrics make sense for
397.44s: you in general I want to try to keep as
399.96s: much Capital as I possibly can in the
401.80s: core allocation because it gives me the
405.16s: most amount of flexibility depending on
407.44s: what the Market's choosing to do now
409.28s: another caveat if I'm trying to
411.60s: aggressively grow my portfolio I'm going
414.16s: to bump this 70% down this might be up
417.60s: to 60% but it might generally run around
421.20s: 30% something like that you have to
423.80s: figure out the way you try to split your
425.92s: portfolio in this case going with this
428.84s: example if we have $70,000 allocated to
432.44s: iwm let's say the initial outlay is
435.92s: $35,000 half of the position then I'm
438.96s: using that residual Capital the
441.20s: remaining $35,000 and I'm going to look
444.16s: at iwm every time it makes a 5% move up
447.20s: or down a 10% move up or down whatever
449.88s: your strategy calls for but this scaling
452.88s: piece is really important as well as
454.88s: this outlay here's how I think about it
457.08s: if I'm allocating $70,000 and I have a
459.96s: very strong conviction in my trade
462.96s: meaning I want to maximize as much of my
465.52s: exposure to the trade hypothesis is
467.92s: possible this outlay can be up to 100% I
471.44s: could put all of the money out there if
473.12s: I want right up front what's the
475.12s: downside you lose the ability to scale
478.04s: both to the upside and to the downside
480.08s: so with something like a coverage
481.24s: strangle we're adding risk as things go
483.72s: down similar to dollar cost averaging
485.92s: that becomes problematic so I tend not
488.20s: to do that with something like the
489.48s: coverage triangle and if you're curious
491.08s: about how I run finances for this
492.96s: strategy by itself I will throw a link
495.56s: in the video below now let's say you're
497.96s: not looking to split your portfolio out
499.96s: into corn speculative don't worry I got
502.08s: you let's take a look at if we had
505.28s: speculative trades only so in this case
508.36s: I have position set to be up to 10% this
511.96s: is again a generality I definitely would
515.36s: not want speculative positions exceeding
517.84s: 15% when I'm sizing things I try to give
521.32s: myself room again this is up to 70% up
525.76s: to 15% that means in general I'm going
528.36s: to look to size about 10% some people
530.68s: might look at that and say wow that's
532.04s: like really large for an individual
533.52s: position it could be for you maybe
535.20s: you're better off looking at something
537.08s: like 5% here's the thing you have to
539.48s: consider when you're trading something
541.84s: like short premium strategies you
544.64s: there's a difference between what the
547.04s: margin requirement is and what the value
550.24s: at risk is that's an example we'll get
552.44s: into in a minute here when I'm looking
554.00s: at this these are both strategies that
556.28s: are going to use most of the money UPF
557.76s: front so for me I'm looking to find a
561.28s: balance if you size things too small you
564.84s: have to put on a bunch of stuff that
567.20s: might be okay for the way you trade that
569.48s: might be a headache again depending on
571.64s: how you trade so this number in general
574.88s: it's going to be variable based on what
576.28s: you're looking for so when we look at
579.40s: then perhaps adding another position so
582.04s: we have this Tesla ratio called diagonal
584.48s: this thing's out and running it's
585.76s: bullish and you want to get bullish in
587.16s: Nvidia as well how do we think about the
589.24s: sizing of that if you'll remember we
591.44s: need to look at the portfolio because
594.44s: Tesla and Nvidia behave very much like
597.44s: one another they're very correlated so
599.72s: am I going to use the maximum allocation
602.64s: for position sizing in this instance if
605.48s: I already have something that's behaving
607.40s: quite like it maybe if that's the
609.76s: exposure I want maybe not if I want to
612.04s: diversify my exposure a bit more the
614.60s: important thing to take away from
616.96s: looking at these different kinds of
618.48s: strategies is you have to strike that
620.80s: balance you need enough money working in
623.00s: order to meet your portfolio objectives
625.68s: but you also need to diversify your risk
628.36s: profile to the degree that you want if
630.76s: you don't do that and you have a bad
633.44s: Market move against you you might have
636.60s: all your position sized at 5% but if
639.44s: they all act like one another it doesn't
642.20s: really matter that means essentially
644.72s: you're using all of your account in one
647.60s: kind of position that behaves like one
650.08s: single position that's a problem that's
652.52s: why the portfolio review section of this
654.76s: is so freaking important now to help tie
658.88s: some of the Concepts together I want to
661.08s: give you some specific details to
663.48s: consider the first one is in the
665.00s: beginning contrary to what your
667.84s: girlfriend might tell you smaller is
670.88s: better when you're first starting to
673.04s: trade options when you're first starting
675.04s: to roll out strategies but then again
677.80s: you still have to get to a point where
679.52s: you are trading at your scale whatever
682.24s: your corresponding scale is the other
684.68s: thing is sometimes you will hear people
686.48s: refer to options and stock position
689.96s: sizing as the same thing they're not if
693.12s: we check out Apple here which is trading
695.04s: at 187 if you buy 100 shares of Apple
698.64s: you're going to take up
701.20s: 18739 bucks in this instance you can put
704.88s: on a similar notional value position
708.52s: using way less money with options let's
710.52s: say for example we buy this deep in the
712.60s: money 91 Delta call at 155 this means
716.60s: you're controlling 15,500 $100 worth of
720.32s: Apple using 3500 bucks so when you buy
724.84s: this position do we use the 15,500 or
728.48s: the 3500 well depends on the way you
731.36s: think about this but for me I would be
733.56s: using the actual capital I have
735.60s: committed to the trade now there's an
737.28s: inverse scenario let's say you choose to
740.32s: sell a put in apple and let's say you
743.64s: come in here to the 27 Delta 180 well in
747.40s: this scenario I have portfolio Market
749.16s: Marg you'll see that the margin
750.48s: requirement is only 1,800 bucks but
752.80s: technically the max loss is undefined
754.84s: all the way down to zero so your loss
757.48s: potential is way more than the $1,800 so
760.64s: in this kind of scenario if you're using
762.28s: an undefined risk trade me I think the
765.16s: best practical scenario is to define the
768.52s: risk so in this case based on your
770.64s: trading plan and your strategy outlines
772.76s: which you have as Apple Falls below your
776.32s: strike if this is a cash security put
779.56s: you'll say okay well then I would buy
782.04s: this option that means I need the money
784.68s: to buy 100 shares at $180 if that's not
788.28s: what you want to do you need to define a
790.64s: period that you either would hedge the
792.76s: position via short shares or you need to
795.88s: find a point that you would exit for the
797.64s: position at a loss and you need to
799.40s: Define that before you enter your trade
802.12s: that will give you your value at risk
804.20s: there are some downsides here because
805.76s: markets can move the value at risk you
808.16s: are postulating
809.68s: is saying if I intervene I would be able
812.08s: to do it at this point which you may or
814.12s: may not be able to do it exactly at that
816.44s: point so you have to give it some slack
818.24s: next up we have this idea of expected
821.04s: return this is a guiding concept the
823.28s: reason why expected return is so
825.24s: important is because it lets us see how
827.80s: a system will perform in the long run
830.48s: which is another consideration for you
833.36s: is that you have to cons you have to
835.08s: consider both individual trades and
838.56s: system Returns what does that mean well
840.88s: if you have a trade that's so big that
844.08s: one loss can erase your account but in
846.76s: the long run it looks like it would make
848.72s: money doesn't matter because you have so
850.56s: much value at risk that one losing
852.68s: position can completely detract your
855.40s: ability for any future returns so you
857.68s: have to think about that but you also
859.52s: have to balance it with the systematic
861.24s: returns because if you have a process
864.44s: that returns a modest amount of money
866.40s: you might say ah this doesn't look that
868.12s: great but then if you project it out
869.56s: over a long enough time frame it starts
871.24s: to make a lot of sense so when we're
873.36s: doing this kind of thought process and
875.44s: sizing things one of the concepts to
877.76s: remember is the sequence of returns what
879.76s: do you expect to see so in this case I'm
882.28s: giving you guys a chart a reference
883.96s: chart the number of consecutive losses
886.08s: is here on the Y AIS and then the x axis
889.68s: is the probability of a win so what's
891.84s: the probability of having five
894.52s: consecutive losses with a 60% chance of
897.64s: winning 1% so this means that you can
901.08s: look at whatever strategy you're running
903.12s: look at the average losing size of that
906.40s: strategy and you say okay there's a 1%
908.68s: chance I could lose five in a row how
910.28s: much would I lose if I lost five in a
911.80s: row and you can do some math to figure
913.56s: out if you can withstand drawdowns based
915.64s: on the probability of experiencing
918.28s: consecutive losses we already talked
920.12s: about correlation this has to be baked
922.88s: into your system we also need to think
925.08s: about what kind of move we're trying to
927.64s: trade and how much risk we're taking to
929.80s: get there for example if you are risking
932.72s: $10,000 to make a 50 c move expected
936.32s: return will tell you that doesn't make
938.04s: sense so both of these are tied
941.32s: intimately with one another and this
944.16s: also will inform how you think about
946.72s: your initial outlay and then your
948.64s: scaling protocols if you're deploying
951.20s: something that has a tight stop in those
953.88s: instances I tend to size up more because
956.84s: my value at risk is constrained if I'm
960.12s: trying to give something more room to
961.88s: breathe and I'm Trend following I'm
963.68s: going to decrease how much money I give
966.28s: that trade because I'm expecting more
969.04s: variance in the trade at the end of the
971.16s: day you have to make it make sense what
973.24s: this means is in this example if we have
975.04s: a $100,000 account we want a 15% return
977.88s: per year but we only allow ourselves 1%
980.80s: positions and we're managing those at
982.60s: 50% saying that they're short premium
984.96s: strategies well that's going to give you
986.52s: $1,000 per trade you're going to have to
988.56s: put on a bunch of them right 1,000 if
991.60s: we're trying to get this 15% you're
993.48s: going to have to put on at least 50 of
996.12s: them probably more this puts you in
998.20s: these crappy little trades that you're
999.84s: making 45 bucks over 20 days this gives
1002.44s: you $540 a year what I'm highlighting in
1005.48s: this instance is that it doesn't make
1007.08s: sense based on your size and your return
1009.72s: objectives this sizing doesn't make
1011.92s: sense so you have to think through your
1013.72s: strategies what the average wins and
1015.52s: losses are and you have to make it make
1017.80s: sense otherwise
1019.36s: you're just putting stuff out there and
1021.88s: you're not going to follow it because
1023.32s: innately you know it doesn't make sense
