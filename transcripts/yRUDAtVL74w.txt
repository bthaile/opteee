0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.40s: Wanted to follow up on a really good conversation I was having with one of the members of my
5.86s: Facebook group on why think or swim is lying to you.
10.20s: And what I want to talk about is IV rank versus IV percentile.
14.28s: Although they're used interchangeably, these are completely different calculations and it's
18.24s: important to understand that in the way that they're calculated to know how we can use them.
22.48s: One is far better than the other and I'll explain why.
26.52s: According to normal market conditions, these two are very similar, which is why they're
29.96s: used interchangeably.
31.48s: People just send in them as essentially and they don't really pay respect to the difference
36.26s: between it to them.
37.84s: But when we see really large outlier moves like we saw when the market crashed earlier
43.60s: this year, that's when the difference in their computation becomes super apparent and
49.40s: it's important for us as traders to understand that difference because it will completely
53.64s: change the way you approach a trade.
56.64s: So what I have here is a snapshot from think or swim.
61.20s: Took it right before this video on today's option statistics, which is under the Trade
66.24s: tab below all of the options chains and this is for Tesla.
71.96s: So what this is showing you is it says current IV percentile is 30%.
76.52s: It's completely false.
77.84s: It's not 30%.
78.84s: That is a lie, literally bold phase completely incorrect.
83.96s: That is IV rank and I'm going to explain over the next couple slides here why this is so
89.96s: important to you and what the difference is here.
93.44s: So when we look at IV rank, that is calculated by you take the current IV, you subtract the
101.84s: 52 week low IV and then you divide that number by 52 week high IV minus 52 week low IV.
110.56s: And if you use the numbers again from that same screenshot from the prior screen, you get
115.76s: 30%.
117.00s: This is the calculation for IV rank, not IV percentile.
121.96s: The reason why it's so important to understand the difference here is because this is susceptible
126.08s: to outlier skew.
127.60s: It's taking the extremes, the high and the low.
130.76s: So this can completely give you a false perception of where things are right now.
137.36s: And that is why IV percentile is so much more useful than that.
142.76s: So when we look at IV percentile, it simply takes the number of trading days below the
149.12s: current IV and divides it by the number of trading days in the year, which is 52.
153.44s: As you can tell by this simple calculation, it is way less susceptible to skew because
159.36s: it's not using the extremes.
160.80s: It's just calculating the number of days above or below levels.
164.76s: And if you'll notice the screenshot, I actually don't use today's option statistics much
169.16s: because I have think scripts that populate that data for me on the chart.
173.92s: So I normally see it here.
176.04s: What I'll do is I'll include this in the description below so that you can have the IV percentile.
183.80s: And this is why.
185.00s: Right now, again, IV rank is 30.26% is what they're saying.
189.60s: In IV percentile is 66%.
192.76s: That's a huge difference.
193.76s: That's a giant discrepancy between those two figures that typically are close to one
197.72s: another and people associate certain trades with.
201.04s: In this instance, completely different.
203.00s: And I would approach these trades completely differently if it was at a 30% or at 60%.
209.20s: So again, wanted to share this with everybody.
211.12s: We follow up on that conversation.
212.12s: It's a really good one.
213.36s: It's an educational one.
215.00s: And if anybody has any questions, let me know.
217.16s: Happy to dive in further.
218.64s: Catch you later.
