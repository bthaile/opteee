0.00s: Trading options can be incredibly lucrative.
3.32s: However, if you're anything like me when I first started,
6.12s: I just kind of started trading.
8.20s: And unfortunately, that led to a bunch of wasted time and effort.
12.24s: So the goal of this video is to share nine questions I would ask myself
16.80s: if I were to start trading options all over again.
19.72s: And no, this isn't to confirm whether or not options are right for me to trade
24.44s: because they are.
25.92s: It's to make sure that I'm going down the right path
28.68s: because it is so easy not to.
31.80s: Let's dig right in.
33.08s: Taking a look at the first three, this first question is no mistake.
38.52s: Do you understand the trouble that you're in?
40.56s: And it sounds a little dramatic, but here is the long and short of it.
45.04s: The vast majority of traders fail.
47.28s: We know this.
48.00s: There's all different kinds of statistics on it.
49.72s: You can find a lot of data on it on my website.
52.44s: Here are a list of studies that you can check out that report the behavior
56.60s: and the results of most traders.
58.96s: So why do I bring this up?
60.52s: If I already know that I want to trade, but I know that a lot of people fail at it.
65.56s: Well, two reasons.
66.56s: The first one is in order to succeed at something that's incredibly difficult,
70.04s: you have to understand how difficult it is so that you can then conduct the proper preparation
77.08s: in order to succeed in it.
78.92s: The same thing if you go through any sort of harder military training course, if you just
83.68s: show up and hope it's going to go OK without doing all of the physical requirements ahead
87.72s: of time to make sure that you're ready to go through that training.
91.16s: There's a good chance you fail.
93.12s: The other thing is trading has a remarkably low barrier to entry.
99.20s: So if you think about being a professional athlete, you've probably played your whole
102.60s: life.
103.60s: You played it in all different kinds of leagues.
104.60s: You've probably done really well.
105.60s: I had a lot of coaching, yada, yada, yada in trading.
108.60s: None of that.
109.60s: But really, sign on to a website, open a brokerage account, put some money in your now a trader.
115.56s: That's it.
116.56s: There's nobody looking at anything you do, which is both the beauty, but a lot of people's
122.68s: destruction is having complete and utter autonomy because everything that happens as a trader
128.52s: is only one person's fault our own.
133.80s: So that's the trouble that we're in.
135.60s: We're interfacing with a very difficult system with absolutely no structure around it.
140.72s: Essentially one of the beautiful things about the outlier community, which you should
143.72s: check out the link in the discord below, link to the discord below.
148.44s: And you can join the free side to paid side either or, but that's the whole idea is to
152.28s: help people add some structure to this stuff.
154.84s: OK, so the next question I have for us, once we understand that this is difficult, it's
160.96s: easy to mess up, but it's worthwhile.
163.60s: We're understanding the challenge here.
165.56s: The next thing we need to do is level set on goals because how often have you heard
169.68s: something like, I just won a hundred dollars a day.
172.68s: Well, this is sound too crazy, especially if you have the average trading account, which
177.52s: is $5,500 according to the bank for international settlements.
181.28s: That seems OK.
182.28s: But if you actually look at the percent return, it's 72,190% return.
187.44s: Pretty damn good.
189.24s: Now for context to be clear, my return from 2018 to 22 was 24.6% on average.
197.40s: And my compound annual growth rate from 2007 is in the 20% range.
202.96s: And this is 72,190.
204.96s: Apparently I have a lot of work to do.
207.68s: Really, the point being is people can perform way better than me to be clear.
211.24s: And a lot of people should.
212.24s: I've approached trading very specifically with the intent of doing well, but consistently.
217.24s: I've only had two down years, my first two and both of them are less than 5% draw downs.
222.04s: So yeah, I have a different objective.
224.92s: But the point I'm trying to make is that a lot of people get into this with the idea of
230.64s: making a small amount of money.
232.20s: They're taught not to be greedy.
233.40s: They think they're doing that.
234.68s: But once you actually start looking at the numbers a little bit, you're like, OK, you're
238.28s: actually setting yourself up for failure right from the jump.
241.52s: So you have to answer this question.
243.52s: Before you move on to the next three, why are you different?
246.88s: What are you going to do different than all of these people?
251.48s: What are you going to do different than the 90% plus group of people that try to do this
257.32s: in fail?
258.32s: And it can't be something as simple as I'm going to try hard.
260.92s: I'm going to study hard.
262.40s: Lots of them do that.
263.40s: You have to go further than that.
264.96s: And one of the things I want you to start thinking about now is what are the qualities
269.64s: you have personally that can help you gain an edge in the markets?
275.48s: So when I think about myself specifically, I'm not that gifted with math.
280.52s: I didn't come for money so I didn't have some big bank role to start with.
284.00s: So what were the things I had in my favor?
287.72s: I'm incredibly organized.
290.00s: So as I go through my trading career, I spend a lot of time tracking things that create
295.84s: a feedback loop.
297.04s: So you'll see some of that later in here.
298.84s: The other thing is once I start something and I'm interested in it, I tend to become
304.56s: obsessive.
305.56s: And I use this metric all the time.
306.92s: It's actually higher than this now, obviously, but I've spent over 30,000 hours looking at
311.96s: these things.
313.12s: And the reason why that matters is because taking the time to learn the products and to learn
318.44s: what this is is not easy.
319.80s: It's all delayed gratification.
321.44s: It's your first five years, your first eight years.
325.32s: You're not going to see much.
326.44s: You might trade really well.
327.76s: You might be growing your money.
329.32s: But if you're like me and you start without a lot of money, even if you have a great return,
333.12s: it's not going to move the line really that much as a gross dollar amount.
337.48s: So you have to think about you.
339.80s: What are you really good at?
341.08s: Are you good at pattern recognition?
342.80s: Do you see things over time and you can start to catch patterns that continue to reoccur?
347.44s: You'll find that in the market all the time.
349.68s: Are you really good at being objective with yourself?
352.44s: We'll get into that a little bit later.
354.40s: But one of the biggest downfall traders have is literally the inability to control themselves.
359.40s: And that's a massive drawdown.
360.72s: So think about that as we proceed forward.
363.36s: What are you good at and how does that make you different than most people who try this
368.68s: and fail?
369.68s: Next three questions.
370.68s: You probably caught some of this from what I was just talking about, but how serious
374.72s: are you about doing this?
376.48s: Because a lot of people will start trading like, I'll just throw some money in and see
379.80s: how it goes.
380.80s: Stand, it's gone.
382.76s: It's fine.
383.76s: You could do that.
384.76s: It doesn't like, okay.
385.68s: But trading, especially as a wealth development vehicle, is a terrible hobby because you have
392.76s: to wear so many hats as an individual retail trader.
398.48s: You have to research things.
399.92s: You have to be a data analyst to look through a bunch of data.
402.88s: You have to be a technical analyst to be able to look at charts.
406.00s: You also have to be your own counselor and psychologist because guess what?
411.48s: Out of all of the people that interact with the stock market, we all have access to
416.40s: the same information.
417.96s: You have access to the same information I do yet 90% plus of traders fail within five
424.32s: years.
425.32s: I haven't.
426.32s: I've obviously outperformed the market for that timeframe.
428.48s: Is it because I have better tools, better information?
430.72s: No.
431.72s: So what does it come down to?
432.92s: It comes down to the way that I manage myself, the way I understand myself and the way
438.68s: that I'm able to bear myself to myself.
441.80s: What I mean by that is we have an ego and it's very difficult to manage the ego and
446.28s: it leads to things like the disposition effect where we take winning trades down too fast
451.84s: because we want to realize the gain and then we let losing trades run because we don't
456.28s: want to realize loss.
457.28s: I know that's a thing.
458.40s: So I've created systems that allow me to control that and limit my ability to sabotage
463.96s: myself.
464.96s: The point being is if you are going to be a trader, there's nobody looking over your
469.64s: shoulder telling you to be honest, telling you to do the hard work.
473.80s: It's all on you.
474.80s: Not a good hobby.
475.80s: It's a great way to lose a lot of money.
477.56s: So speaking of losing money, how do you plan on making it?
480.32s: A lot of traders just think that if I start trading options, it'll all make money.
483.36s: It's not how it works.
484.92s: You have to define what I like to call a money making mechanism.
488.12s: I have an entire video on this.
489.36s: I'll link to that in the notes below.
491.28s: But you have to figure out options are just a vehicle.
494.16s: There's something we can trade.
495.96s: They're a type of security.
498.08s: So trading options doesn't equal making money.
501.84s: You have to figure out what is the money making?
504.04s: Are you going to be good at trading directionally?
506.28s: Are you good at finding breakouts?
508.56s: Are you good at finding things that have increasing volume and institutional support and you're
512.40s: able to follow that?
513.64s: Are you able to analyze broad market data sets and find inefficiencies like various risk
520.32s: premiums that you can capitalize on?
523.32s: They're all out there.
524.32s: They exist.
525.32s: So what's beautiful things about being a retail trader is you get to check about a lot
528.52s: of different boxes and find what works for you.
531.00s: But simply trading options is not a way that you make money.
533.60s: Actually, for most people, for being honest, it's a way to lose money.
536.72s: Why haven't you started a trading plan and trading log?
539.36s: This is simple.
540.60s: If you haven't done them, do them.
541.92s: I have a video in the notes that will walk through both of them in depth.
546.16s: But as you notice, you have to do a lot of things.
549.12s: The idea that you're going to be able to do all of those things and just memorize it really
553.64s: organized in your mind and perform well is wild.
558.48s: Even if over time you don't really refer to your trading plan all the time, I don't.
563.60s: But going through the exercise of building it is so important.
567.96s: Last three questions.
569.04s: Are you familiar with the Dunning Krueger effect because you have to be?
572.56s: Here it is.
573.56s: It's essentially this cycle that we go through where in the beginning, you don't know anything.
581.96s: Then you go through three or four really hard intensive years of learning and you think
587.08s: you know what's going on.
588.48s: Fortunately, we don't.
590.32s: My Dunning Krueger effect essentially occurred after four years of trading.
593.96s: That's where I had the largest percent drawdown on my portfolio.
596.92s: That sends you down here.
598.28s: You've just now realized that shit.
600.92s: I have a long way to go.
602.28s: You have a choice now.
603.28s: Do you do the learning?
604.64s: And if so, after average 10,000 hours, which if you want to break that down, that means
611.36s: you spend five hours every single day for five and a half years without missing a single
616.60s: day that will put you just over this 10,000 hour mark to give you an idea of how long this
621.12s: takes in order to develop this skill set.
624.04s: If you're not ready to just say, yep, stuck it up, buttercup, we got to get through this
629.08s: and I think I can.
630.40s: This isn't for you.
631.68s: It's like if you start training Jujitsu.
634.16s: If you start training Jujitsu and your goal is to be a black belt within three years,
638.00s: it's not happening.
639.00s: It's literally not happening.
640.96s: It takes too long.
641.96s: So what does that mean?
642.96s: Well, maybe you still want your black belt and that's a longer term goal and you're committed
646.40s: to that longer term goal, but you learn to prioritize smaller processes along the way.
653.72s: And you break it up into smaller chunks and then you start working.
657.48s: Last two questions.
658.48s: How will you keep yourself honest right here?
661.36s: Rating plan and your trading log.
663.44s: That's how.
664.44s: Whether we acknowledge it or not going back to one of the many hats, we have to acknowledge
669.80s: and wear one of them is psychologist.
672.56s: And if you think about our behaviors as humans, we get away with doing a lot of mental manipulations
679.08s: in order to save our ego or in order to save discomfort.
683.08s: However, if that's your disposition, trading is going to be very difficult.
686.60s: You have to get comfortable being uncomfortable pretty regularly.
689.64s: So the easiest way to make sure that you're doing the hard work, that you're accomplishing
694.68s: what you're setting out to is to document what you're doing.
698.76s: And then the last thing, without this none of this matters because you're going to go
703.36s: through this phase, you're going to have really bad draw downs.
706.60s: You're going to get really tired of looking at this for five years in a row and still not
711.36s: seeing the exact results that you want.
713.72s: This is what keeps it all pushing.
716.52s: Why does this matter you?
718.92s: For me, the simple, I grew up poor.
721.40s: I had a single mom.
722.76s: She worked as a contractor.
723.96s: She was a physical therapist.
725.36s: She had no retirement.
726.48s: I knew as a young man, I'm the retirement.
730.20s: If I'm not in a spot to take care of my mom, who the fuck is going to do it?
736.08s: Language.
738.28s: So for me, that was simple.
740.60s: That's why this matters to me.
742.24s: That's why when in college, as my friends are going out to party, rightfully so, and I
746.92s: used to party too, make no mistake about it, but a lot of times I would say no because
751.52s: I was in my room doing homework because there was something bigger and more important
757.04s: than me at stake.
759.24s: Why does this matter to you?
762.48s: You have to answer that and visualize it because this is what matters.
768.52s: The time that I told my mom, you don't have to worry about working ever again.
772.20s: I have your back.
773.96s: That was the culmination of all of this time and effort and it's completely fucking worth
780.04s: it.
781.04s: I'll see you later.
