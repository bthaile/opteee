0.76s: what's up outliers quick GameStop video
3.12s: cuz I didn't talk about it yesterday in
6.32s: the Market Outlook so I want to level
8.96s: set on the week as it stands out ahead
12.04s: and just keeping it a buck I don't see a
15.12s: whole lot right now it still seems
18.04s: fairly quiet in here we had a really
20.36s: interesting gme live stream we do this
22.56s: every Saturday at 5:00 P p.m. Pacific
24.36s: time and the last one we took some time
27.52s: digging into a little bit of game stops
30.64s: older
31.72s: transaction and one of the things that
33.84s: we did notice that was kind of
36.40s: interesting is that if we go into the
38.16s: dark pool feed to just see what kind of
40.80s: transactions are happening and different
43.72s: sizes we filter this by 5,000 shares
46.96s: again this is specifically for shares
49.00s: I'm going to filter by
50.56s: GameStop and we can
52.80s: see that there have been a a bit of a
56.52s: run of these 5,000
60.48s: share blocks and it's been ebbing and
63.40s: flowing now one of the Curiosities we
65.68s: had during the live stream was hey what
68.64s: did this look like before the cat came
73.16s: back in May so what we did was actually
76.68s: go back and take a look at essentially
80.00s: what transactions took place through
83.28s: this entire period at that block level
85.96s: and we can see if we go all the way back
88.12s: we can see a bunch of them in in late
91.00s: may but if we filter this down and we're
93.72s: like okay what does it look like the
95.20s: very beginning of May I think he came
96.88s: back on the 12th if I'm not mistaken so
99.32s: if we take like 1 to 10 May nothing and
103.48s: then if we go to April out of curiosity
105.68s: and take a look nothing but then if we
108.88s: go 13 to
111.84s: 24 we see them really starting to pick
114.80s: up a little bit later right so if you
116.44s: take a look at 21 22 so what this tells
119.56s: me is a lot of these transactions
121.40s: actually got kicked off by a lot of the
123.16s: movement that we saw and I don't
125.84s: necessarily think that the 5,000 block
129.00s: trades mean a whole lot I know a lot of
131.28s: people are generally um assigning that
134.72s: to Roaring Kitty is you know kind of
136.64s: like a calling card sort of thing but I
138.52s: I think it's a little misplaced and the
139.96s: reason is because we saw him move 5,000
143.64s: block lots of
145.68s: options and that's for a very specific
147.76s: reason 5,000 Lots in options is a much
152.60s: bigger position than 5,000 shares 5,000
155.40s: shares is actually quite small on a
157.20s: comparative basis and just in terms of
159.32s: the market liquidity it's completely
161.88s: different so I think some people are
164.60s: maybe mistakenly associating the
168.40s: 5,000 the 5,000 lot options trades that
171.64s: he was making and then we see these dark
173.80s: pool trades hitting at 5,000 blocks
175.72s: thinking oh maybe it's him and I get why
178.40s: everybody's curious I'm curious to know
180.60s: what he's doing how could you not be
182.00s: it's literally this is literally like
183.96s: one of the most interesting stock market
187.36s: stories that I've ever come across my 17
190.20s: years doing this it's fascinating but
193.64s: again my job I see as a Trader is always
196.28s: to try to look at things as objectively
198.00s: as possible and like nobody really has
201.00s: any sort of you know ownership over
203.84s: 5,000 especially when it comes to shares
207.44s: it's a nice round number and it doesn't
210.16s: really jump out at me as any one single
212.16s: entity and again like we can go back
214.40s: through a bunch of different time frames
217.20s: and see that this has been going on
219.56s: primarily since we started seeing the
221.96s: movement in the beginning miday into
224.32s: June so I thought that was generally
226.84s: interesting going through that exercise
228.48s: this past weekend we actually didn't
229.84s: finish we have to go through a part
231.72s: three of analyzing roaring kitties old
235.00s: trades which we're going to do this
236.68s: coming Saturday um I think we're in 202
240.28s: now so we're essentially going literally
242.44s: update by update understanding what the
244.64s: market looked like what kind of
245.80s: decisions were being made what kind of
247.20s: Trades were being made what kind of
248.40s: money was moving in and out of the
249.72s: account just to again dive in because
252.04s: it's absolutely
253.36s: fascinating and so this I I think is a
257.44s: data point to be aware of but it's
259.44s: nothing that's jumping out at me as like
262.00s: maybe as big of a deal as we might think
264.48s: it is so if we take a look at today we
266.80s: can see that there was a handful of
268.28s: these if we clear out this 5,000 filter
270.80s: you'll notice that there are still tons
273.04s: of these trades that are just way larger
275.88s: so what it tells me is that people that
277.84s: are positioning at 5,000 it's because we
280.96s: explicitly we being the Royal we whoever
283.32s: is doing this they explicitly want 5,000
286.80s: or 5200 right it's not because they're
288.68s: doing it because of a liquidity thing
290.84s: like what we saw when roaring Kitty was
293.72s: buying 5,000 lots of options that was a
296.20s: liquidity consideration this not so much
298.88s: this just looks like
300.16s: what different entities want to scoop at
303.00s: and again there's plenty of liquidity
304.64s: there was a 62,000 share transaction
306.60s: today they cleared on the dark pool 1.26
308.64s: million right through no
310.80s: problem so there's that now if we do
314.16s: take a look over at GameStop and we take
316.64s: a look at the options
318.40s: activity and I'm actually going to look
320.48s: over this month so far and let's filter
324.56s: by just people that are buying calls and
327.16s: see what this looks like so we saw these
328.68s: transactions come through ready we
330.60s: already kind of have the the whole deal
332.44s: on those that these came and went right
334.48s: so if I throw the bid back in you'll see
336.56s: those drop right off and Beyond these
339.56s: trades it has been exceedingly quiet now
343.56s: the again my assumption is that these
346.28s: are tied together in some sort of way
349.68s: meaning you know whoever made this
352.32s: series there's more of them further down
354.32s: but whoever made this series in the 22
355.96s: and a Hales probably did these we don't
358.12s: have that definitively yet but
360.56s: that's what it looks like and if I zoom
363.32s: this in a little bit now and just kind
364.60s: of look over the past you know week and
367.72s: today we had the
371.32s: 17 of Jan 202s there was a big trade
375.80s: that went through at the 20s over a
377.52s: million dollars big big trade but that
379.64s: was back on the 11th and this is kind of
382.04s: a longer term exposure one of the things
383.72s: I'm noticing is for most of these bigger
385.48s: trades right so we see 2025 2025 2025
389.12s: most of the greater than 100,000 premium
392.20s: which is a a bigger trade for sure
394.32s: they're out into 2025 we're not playing
397.12s: these really aggressive one month two
399.20s: month thre Monon front expiration trades
402.04s: so what that tells me is that there's
404.28s: just a a change in positioning compared
406.56s: to what we've seen previously and if we
408.80s: take a look at the total premiums out
410.80s: there it's just a little bit lighter
412.48s: essentially so if we look at open
414.24s: interest right now there's 630,000 calls
417.08s: against sub 300,000 puts that is
419.64s: actually notable call skew in terms of
422.60s: total positions but this is the
424.84s: difference if you take a look at these
426.60s: different color bars you'll see that
429.08s: there definitely is representation in
430.56s: the 20 SE and we typically run pretty
433.00s: front month heavy but you'll actually
435.24s: see that in 18 o there's quite a lot out
439.60s: in 17 Jan there's quite a lot so what
442.92s: I'm noticing is that there's being
444.48s: buildout of the next primary expiration
447.76s: and then this front expiration is
449.24s: actually a little bit lighter than it's
451.00s: been historically so 167,000 out of the
454.24s: 630 that's relatively light for the
457.08s: front expiration cycle than what I've
458.84s: seen so there's not necessarily a direct
462.72s: takeaway other than the kind of
465.72s: undercurrent of GameStop from an options
468.56s: perspective is slightly different than
470.44s: when it's been a little bit more active
473.48s: we can see total volume way more calls
476.92s: traded today 101,000 versus 22 ,000 puts
480.40s: but if you'll notice 40% of those were
482.76s: at the bid or below tells us that those
485.40s: are people selling calls and I
488.24s: understand why because if we take a look
489.52s: at the GameStop chart it kind of dropped
492.12s: off after earnings and it's been just
494.08s: trending sideways and even before this
496.68s: drop which seems big on the chart but
499.12s: it's actually not that significant it's
501.52s: been trending sideways essentially from
504.60s: the 1st of August something like that
507.76s: just a general sideways trend
510.32s: and so now the name of the game is
512.60s: what's the next Catalyst that starts to
514.60s: move things a little bit my guess is
516.12s: that will be some shred of news either
518.20s: from roaring Kitty or if the GameStop
522.04s: leadership starts talking a little bit
523.72s: about their plans with their literal
526.32s: pool of gold coins that they have at
528.32s: their disposal and if we take a look at
532.72s: the volume volume is starting to slow
535.08s: down so on earnings on the 11th kind of
538.96s: right after earnings we see that there
540.80s: was a spike of volume 28.9 million then
543.44s: it dropped to 992 then it dropped to 8
546.64s: then it dropped to
547.96s: 5.9 so we're volume is downward sloping
552.08s: in here so that also tells me just from
554.48s: a general trading perspective it's
555.88s: getting really quiet now what does that
558.08s: mean I don't know volatility has come
560.16s: down a lot implied volatility percental
562.48s: right now is only
563.96s: 38% which volatility as a raw figure is
567.08s: still quite high it's like 90% but for
569.92s: something like GameStop that's
571.16s: relatively low so yeah bit of a quiet
574.48s: period as far as I see it the next video
576.68s: on GameStop I'll go a little bit deeper
578.88s: into seeing if there's any interesting
580.56s: positioning and options as I looked
582.12s: through the chains nothing was jumping
584.12s: out at me this 20 step is kind of all
586.04s: over the place people are still building
587.72s: out kind of the standard fair but it's
589.96s: just all generally smaller sizes we're
592.24s: still seeing more activity on the
594.20s: further out of the monies this continues
595.88s: to be the case anything from these three
598.60s: Deltas out to these one deltas and you
600.72s: know I've talked about that at nauseum
602.52s: so I won't beat that drum anymore on why
605.00s: I think for retail Traders that's
606.60s: typically not a great approach got to do
608.96s: whatever is right for you but there are
610.24s: smarter ways to buy options in my
612.68s: opinion in something like GameStop but
614.96s: that is what it is so that's where we're
618.04s: sitting for now your boys keeping an eye
620.44s: on it as always if there's anything I
621.68s: should take a look at let me know be an
623.64s: outlier and I'll see you all later
