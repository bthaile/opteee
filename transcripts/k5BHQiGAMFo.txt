 Let's up, Allies. Quick market update before the options trading for beginners live stream later today at 5pm Pacific time. Let's take a look at what happened in two names this week. The first one we're going to look at is rocket lab, RKLB. And then we'll take a look at games stop to see how it wrapped up this week into next week. And then somebody also asked me to take a look at AMC. So happy to take a peek at all of these and just see from a general trading perspective, obviously my lens as options. See what it looks like. So taking a look at rocket labs, the reason why this one came up is because one of my buddies at the gym, he's not a trader. He's just a dude that, you know, dabbles and stocks. And he was just like, hey man, because he knows I trade. He's like, hey man, what do you think about rocket labs, RKLB? And I was just like, okay, there we go. And it's so funny to me because you could tell how people come across these different names. And I was just like, oh, yeah, you know, I'm familiar with that. It's getting popular on like, ready. He's like, yeah, that's where I found it, which is perfect. So what's going on here? Well, I mean, it's been breaking out and continuing to break out. Like that's mostly from what I see from a technical perspective. It's like very, very standard fair where we have big movement, consolidation of some sort. Sometimes the consolidation can be a several percent contraction, but it should be less than 10 and starts to get too steep. Then we have another bit of a surge back up to these levels consolidation, bit of a surge, consolidation. And this process can go on for some time, depending on, you know, what the overall favorability is for the stock, what the news looks like, all those kinds of things. So this is very common. Now, one thing to highlight are the volume. So we absolutely are seeing pretty significant volume on these big updates. And that's important to me because that means that these larger upmoves are broadly supported. Now, the volume is definitely contracted from what we saw right after earnings and then kind of a few days after when some news broke. But other than that, the volume on these updates is noteworthy to me. So I mean, you can already see, but I have something on and here, this is where essentially my stop is set. And I'm just following it up. That's as simple as it goes for me from a trend following perspective. I'm using options just because it's a little bit way to gain leverage cheaply. So I'm not looking to buy a bunch of shares. It's easier for me just to trade it with options. So that's what I'm doing. But if we take a look at the overall position and this is as always my pass through IRAs, so there's no positions. There's nothing, no nothing in here. It's just so that all my account information isn't blasted all over the place. So, but taking a look at it, it has tremendous call skew. Absolutely tremendous call skew, right? So we can see that 354,000 calls against 170,000 puts. So people are playing this to the upside, no doubt. And if we take a look at the volume today, 33,000 calls against 13 and a half on the put side and the majority of the puts are sales coming in at the bid or below. And the majority of the calls that are discernible are being bought at the offer or above. So I mean, right now it looks just generally bullish. I mean, that's the long and short of it. We obviously have a bit of an interesting series of kinks in the volatility smile because we have earnings coming up on the sixth. So you can see that represented in a few different spots, the sixth of November, by the way, not obviously this month. But when we look across the different volatilities, you can see that it starts to peak up here, right? So 90 and a half, 89 and three quarters, 88 and three quarters, then 94. So why does it pop up to here? It's because this expiration contains earnings. So yeah, overall, it looks interesting to me. So let's take a quick look then at just overall how it's behaving inside. See enough, there's any unusual activity going on. So if we grab unusual whales and we take a peak, we can see from a broad perspective that, I mean, it's mostly calls, right? Like you can see that's what the green is showing us. And then the put volume is right on top there. So we already generally knew this, at least from the course of today. So let's take a look and see if there's any big trades that have happened recently. And this is just a standard look that I would take. I would probably use like the past week and see. So there are some decent sized trades in here. And we can see that a lot of them are very long dated though. 15 Jan 27, 17 Jan 25, right? So these are further out in time. These are people playing the longer term play here, which obviously they're thinking rocket labs up. So that's all this is, but there are some no worthy size trades in here. I've been following this for a while since it was introduced to me for the meme stock trading segment. So yeah, overall this looks about right. So yeah, overall rocket labs looks like it's still being strongly supported. The way that I look at it is again, you can see where I'm getting out. If it starts dropping below that, otherwise I'll keep following it up. The next kind of interm alert I would put would be somewhere right around here. I prefer to use a close on this first one. This is kind of like the preemptive trigger and then secondary trigger. So yeah, that's that. Let's take a look now at GameStop then AMC for GameStop. We talked a lot about this yesterday, actually, with Peruvian Bull. So I'm not going to go super far into detail here, but I do want to overview some of the late happenings with it. So primarily we're still in this very range bound segment. And I want you to notice that the point of control is actually about to shift. So this is a six-month daily chart. If I squish all this down, you can see that right here, the volume note is about almost the same size as this volume node. So this volume node is actually going to shift down here soon enough, which tells me that again, a lot of people are transacting here. Relative basis, I should say. So what that means to me is from a broader perspective, I think you have to start thinking where is the floor? This is actually one of the things that came up on the conversation. And Peruvian Bull is of the opinion that it's somewhere around 20, which I think is a completely, completely fair estimation. So we can see how it's training sideways here. I'm a little more conservative. So I would use this near-term resistance, maybe somewhere 19 range, high 19s. But the only reason why I say that is because we can see it's been supported at this 1980 handle ish. It's not a precise target, right? So it's ranges. But it's bounced around there a few times at this point. So we can see how it starts to behave around the 20 handle, which is very, very close to it. But it looks like it penetrates a little bit further down than the 20 handle to me. But we'll see, it looks like 19 and a half to 20, I think is a completely fair shake. So from a price perspective, that's mostly what's going on here. Trending sideways, very, very light volume volume is dried up massively. So if we go back to this kind of larger day, we can see it was 7 mil, 5.6 mil, 4.6 mil, and then now 5.2, 5.3 mil. So very, very light volume, quiet period is what I see. Now going to the options, we already talked a little bit about this again recently, but there's a few things that I think are worth noting. The first one is the put side did take up a little bit in terms of a lie, but still no or near closing in on that two to one ratio. And the other thing I have to keep hammering is the fact that GameStop is not centralized in the front explorations anymore, which is new. This continues to be slightly different than what we've seen previously when it was like highly active. So this isn't to suggest that it's inactive, but this tells me that people are playing things a little further out, which makes a lot of sense to me, because it's been quiet. So I'm not sure why we would want to play really near term moves if volume is slowing down, if price is consolidating. I think that's good for the stock to do that, as compared to too many big jumps around, it just creates choppiness and price, and it can chew a lot of traders up, which I don't want to see. But when I see price consolidating like this, it makes sense to me to see options starting to favor this kind of configuration, or spread out a little bit. We're not getting eviscerated via extrinsic value decaying away in our options. The other thing I want to show you is the wall surface really quick. So if I use specifically out of the money options, which is my preference, so it's going to look at out of the money calls and puts for the upside downside, let's get rid of this front explorations. It's always going to be skewed. And there's a few changes in this. And I look at this all the time. There's a few changes that I notice. The first one is take a look at this 11-Oct exploration, the blue line. Look how low this is for the at the monies. And then look how high all of these other explorations are. And then look at how high the 11-Oct penetrates out above all the others. That's unique. So this is something where I look to trade the expansion of the at the money wall relative potentially to the contraction of next cycle out of the money we're at the money wall, depending on where I can find ideal. I wouldn't call them mispricings, but definitely wall disparities to play relative value wall place here. But the thing I can tell you outright is that typically you would have the front expiration a bit higher than the others very normal. Also typically you have this put side being higher than the call side. That's also a market fears the downside very normal. But you normally would not have the at the monies for these 11s so low relative to all of these others. So for example, if we take a look at rocket, I've just had a curiosity. I don't know what it is. I didn't look at. But let's see. Yeah. So a bit of a different story already. Let me get rid of this front expiration. Well, that's just a fucking mess. So this is just madness. This is this is a smile like mine because this is it's got peaks here, trows here. This is all over the map. So this is a bad example. Let me show you something that would be at least a better example for the sake of a conversation. I'll get show you Apple and get rid of this. This is way more normal. So you notice how the call side typically is lower than the put side. Notice how this blue line is higher than most of the other lines. That's very, very standard exactly what I would expect to see. So the reason why this does this is because the front expiration becomes so pronounced that it overwhelms all the others and flat and some out on a relative basis. That's why I get rid of this one more at expiration because this will be so peaked out. All right. So now let's take a look and see if there's any interesting trades. I didn't see anything that stuck out to me. And again, I look at this every day, but we'll talk about a couple of these. So these we already covered. So I don't when I say I didn't see anything. It's not that anything didn't happen. But we already talked about these. We can see this build out further out in time. Much heavier exposure. This is actually similar to what you're seeing in rocket labs where we're not just playing the near term craziness. We're actually playing slightly longer term ideas here. That's where most of the money is. So from an options perspective that tells me again that the market is trying to play the long term move or at least a longer term move slash window as compared to this high concentration in the front expirations. So a game stop to me in general looks to be consolidating the areas that I'm really interested in. Let me get rid of Apple boring Apple. The areas I'm interested in realistically are if we start to see a break above here and it would need to be joined by volume or a break below here. This to me would indicate some sort of change to the downside. I'm going to get rid of this line just to make it a little cleaner. So you can see the range that I'm eyeballing here and I want to see breaks above or breaks below. And when I say want to see it's just because it helps me identify which way we're going. Right. Because right now it's very much a who knows right we're just chopping sideways. This is standard consolidation. But one thing I don't love is that this relative high here is lower than this. I would love to see that higher. Now also don't love that this low is slightly lower than this relative low. So that's typically a bit of a curve turning over. So we'll see how it goes sideways action for now. All right. Last one is AMC. And this was I'm not going to AMC's interesting to me to be clear all meme stocks are interesting to me. But I don't I haven't like gotten into the story for AMC like I have game stop. So I'm not going to pretend I know anything about AMC or game stop for that matter. But definitely even less AMC. So I'm just going to look at this purely from a trading lens. I don't want you guys to think that there's a lot of baked in ideas here because there really isn't I don't have a lot of context here for AMC. But the main thing I do see with AMC is it's essentially falling below this point of control. So the point of control clearly was established during this time frame when it was running sideways pretty hard. And then it's since started rotating down a little bit. So it's kind of exhibiting similar behavior as some of the other meme stocks. So to me it looks like near term floor looks like something like this. And this would be a close below that somewhere around there. And then really once we start breaking above this point of control is where it starts get interesting to me to the upside. Notice how I use a close for below. Simply because what I'm seeing is these candles are getting down towards these swings. They extend a little bit but then they suck back up in or they don't extend at all and they just hammer out. So there's not like these really big body candles that are crossing below this threshold and shooting back up above. So that's why I would want to see a close for something a little more definitive. And then for the above side of breakouts a breakout. So these things can start moving really really fast. So that's why this is a mark price alert. This is why this is a close price alert like difference in what I look for. The other thing I see here is volume is also siphoned out massively. So 10,000, 27, 12, 12, 9, 7, 9, 8, 5, almost 6, 9. So from here it's contracted a lot here. It actually expanded not not insignificant. Again, I'm going to zoom us in a little bit further so we can get rid of that madness. Yeah. So we can open this up a little bit and see on a relative basis. A lot of sale volume. See all this red. A lot of sale volume. And so yeah, it looks like we had a little bit of a peekiness and volume established here, which obviously kicked these averages up a little bit. But now the longer term moving average, I think we're right below that here. Yeah, it's 9.4 for a 20 day. So a little bit more volume activity from what I can see today compared to the last few days, but still not anything like what we were seeing in here around earnings or even before earnings. So this to me on a short term time frame does look way more like a downtrend. Right. So on a three month chart, linear, these are standard deviation channels negative sloping. I'm seeing continuation of lower highs. So a high here, a lower high here, a lower high here, a lower high here, a lower high here. That's a very standard downside continuation. Now the question always is where does it grab a bite and where does it start to level out? It looks like it's starting here. Right. So if we draw just a loose price level here, you can see that it kind of messed with this level here, here, here, and here. Sloppy though, right? Because that's a pretty meaningful range around this, not massive, but enough. And again, I always remind people when I'm looking at stuff like these different kinds of lines, I use the lines because they're easier, but that's not what I mentally visualize. What I mentally see when I draw those lines, I'll show you. It's a little bit more of like a value area. So what I would do is I would grab essentially this. Right. So movements in this area are what start to interest me because we can see it bounced off of it here. And then if I zoom this out a little bit for context, we can see that it interacted with this same level back here, right? That's I wasn't zoomed in there. It's not by happenstance. Just kind of out goes. So last thing I want to look at in here are the options. And let's kill this front wall. Yeah. So very put heavy stuff. Nothing jumping out at me there. Let's grab all of these tremendous calls you. From Mendes. One mill versus 244,000 puts. That's massive. Like unequivocally, that is massive. And there is a lot traded today. Look at this. 63,000 calls traded today. 52% were bought of those 63. That's interesting. That's really, really interesting to me. That's not insignificant. Fascinating. So let's see where that volume was concentrated. So it looks like a little bit of rolling activity, right? So taking the fronts, meaning the four, moving them out to the 11th, it does have earnings on 7 November. So what I want to do now is see for open interest, where is it concentrated? The 11th has 40, 18th has 81, 13, 11, 3, 71. 82, 281. So this is where it starts getting deep. Yeah. There it is again. 154. So a lot of this volume is at, look at all that. That's over half the volume is greater than 17 JN out. So these were longer term plays. That's most of what I see here. This is not people playing a bunch of like near term movement expectations because over 600,000 of these calls are further out in time. So interesting there. Last thing we'll take a look at quick is any interesting trades for the week. And this looks quiet. So I see largest trade here was 89. Let's see just between all of them. If there's any big trades, and when I say all of them, just the sides of the trades, I normally look at calls on the offer, but we can see sometimes if there's something close to the mid that maybe lean towards the offer or whatever, but this is pretty small in here to me. So most interesting part about AMC here for me definitely is this this calls you. That's pretty significant. I'm actually guessing that's probably why somebody asked me to look at that. This is because they know I look at that stuff. So interesting. All right, gang. Well, that wraps me up for today. We have options trading for beginners 5 p.m. tonight, GME live stream tomorrow, 5 p.m. Pacific time, and then market prep on Sunday for the outlier pro members. If you guys anything, hit me up. Let me know if there's anything you want me to take a look at. More than happy to be an outlier. See y'all later.
