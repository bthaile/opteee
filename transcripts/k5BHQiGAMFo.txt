0.00s: Let's up, Allies. Quick market update before the options trading for beginners live stream
4.92s: later today at 5pm Pacific time. Let's take a look at what happened in two names this week.
11.88s: The first one we're going to look at is rocket lab, RKLB. And then we'll take a look at
16.40s: games stop to see how it wrapped up this week into next week. And then somebody also asked
22.24s: me to take a look at AMC. So happy to take a peek at all of these and just see from a general
28.64s: trading perspective, obviously my lens as options. See what it looks like. So taking a look at
36.08s: rocket labs, the reason why this one came up is because one of my buddies at the gym, he's not
42.64s: a trader. He's just a dude that, you know, dabbles and stocks. And he was just like, hey man,
48.48s: because he knows I trade. He's like, hey man, what do you think about rocket labs, RKLB?
53.36s: And I was just like, okay, there we go. And it's so funny to me because you could tell how people
59.12s: come across these different names. And I was just like, oh, yeah, you know, I'm familiar with that.
62.32s: It's getting popular on like, ready. He's like, yeah, that's where I found it, which is perfect.
66.96s: So what's going on here? Well, I mean, it's been breaking out and continuing to break out.
71.92s: Like that's mostly from what I see from a technical perspective. It's like very, very standard
77.12s: fair where we have big movement, consolidation of some sort. Sometimes the consolidation can be a
82.56s: several percent contraction, but it should be less than 10 and starts to get too steep.
87.44s: Then we have another bit of a surge back up to these levels consolidation, bit of a surge,
92.56s: consolidation. And this process can go on for some time, depending on, you know, what the overall
98.56s: favorability is for the stock, what the news looks like, all those kinds of things. So this is very
102.64s: common. Now, one thing to highlight are the volume. So we absolutely are seeing pretty significant
110.32s: volume on these big updates. And that's important to me because that means that these larger
115.60s: upmoves are broadly supported. Now, the volume is definitely contracted from what we saw right
121.92s: after earnings and then kind of a few days after when some news broke. But other than that,
127.12s: the volume on these updates is noteworthy to me. So I mean, you can already see, but I have
131.36s: something on and here, this is where essentially my stop is set. And I'm just following it up.
136.96s: That's as simple as it goes for me from a trend following perspective. I'm using options
141.68s: just because it's a little bit way to gain leverage cheaply. So I'm not looking to buy a bunch of
147.92s: shares. It's easier for me just to trade it with options. So that's what I'm doing.
151.68s: But if we take a look at the overall position and this is as always my pass through IRAs,
157.84s: so there's no positions. There's nothing, no nothing in here. It's just so that all my account
162.00s: information isn't blasted all over the place. So, but taking a look at it, it has tremendous
168.00s: call skew. Absolutely tremendous call skew, right? So we can see that 354,000 calls against 170,000
175.28s: puts. So people are playing this to the upside, no doubt. And if we take a look at the volume today,
180.72s: 33,000 calls against 13 and a half on the put side and the majority of the puts are sales coming
187.92s: in at the bid or below. And the majority of the calls that are discernible are being bought
194.56s: at the offer or above. So I mean, right now it looks just generally bullish. I mean, that's the long
202.24s: and short of it. We obviously have a bit of an interesting series of kinks in the volatility smile
207.52s: because we have earnings coming up on the sixth. So you can see that represented in a few different
212.48s: spots, the sixth of November, by the way, not obviously this month. But when we look across
219.36s: the different volatilities, you can see that it starts to peak up here, right? So 90 and a half,
225.60s: 89 and three quarters, 88 and three quarters, then 94. So why does it pop up to here? It's because
232.16s: this expiration contains earnings. So yeah, overall, it looks interesting to me. So let's take a quick
238.00s: look then at just overall how it's behaving inside. See enough, there's any unusual activity going
245.92s: on. So if we grab unusual whales and we take a peak, we can see from a broad perspective that,
255.20s: I mean, it's mostly calls, right? Like you can see that's what the green is showing us. And then
260.88s: the put volume is right on top there. So we already generally knew this, at least from the course
268.00s: of today. So let's take a look and see if there's any big trades that have happened recently.
273.68s: And this is just a standard look that I would take. I would probably use like the past week
278.72s: and see. So there are some decent sized trades in here. And we can see that a lot of them are
283.36s: very long dated though. 15 Jan 27, 17 Jan 25, right? So these are further out in time. These are
290.24s: people playing the longer term play here, which obviously they're thinking rocket labs up. So
296.32s: that's all this is, but there are some no worthy size trades in here. I've been following this for
300.80s: a while since it was introduced to me for the meme stock trading segment. So yeah, overall this looks
307.12s: about right. So yeah, overall rocket labs looks like it's still being strongly supported.
311.76s: The way that I look at it is again, you can see where I'm getting out. If it starts dropping below
315.60s: that, otherwise I'll keep following it up. The next kind of interm alert I would put would be
320.40s: somewhere right around here. I prefer to use a close on this first one. This is kind of like the
325.76s: preemptive trigger and then secondary trigger. So yeah, that's that. Let's take a look now at
330.48s: GameStop then AMC for GameStop. We talked a lot about this yesterday, actually, with Peruvian
335.68s: Bull. So I'm not going to go super far into detail here, but I do want to overview some of the
341.68s: late happenings with it. So primarily we're still in this very range bound segment.
346.80s: And I want you to notice that the point of control is actually about to shift. So this is a six-month
352.08s: daily chart. If I squish all this down, you can see that right here, the volume note is about
357.12s: almost the same size as this volume node. So this volume node is actually going to shift down here
362.16s: soon enough, which tells me that again, a lot of people are transacting here.
367.44s: Relative basis, I should say. So what that means to me is from a broader perspective,
373.20s: I think you have to start thinking where is the floor? This is actually one of the things
378.24s: that came up on the conversation. And Peruvian Bull is of the opinion that it's somewhere around 20,
383.12s: which I think is a completely, completely fair estimation. So we can see how it's training sideways
388.96s: here. I'm a little more conservative. So I would use this near-term resistance, maybe somewhere 19
395.60s: range, high 19s. But the only reason why I say that is because we can see it's been supported
400.88s: at this 1980 handle ish. It's not a precise target, right? So it's ranges. But it's bounced around
408.16s: there a few times at this point. So we can see how it starts to behave around the 20 handle, which is
412.88s: very, very close to it. But it looks like it penetrates a little bit further down than the 20
417.76s: handle to me. But we'll see, it looks like 19 and a half to 20, I think is a completely fair shake.
422.96s: So from a price perspective, that's mostly what's going on here. Trending sideways, very, very
429.44s: light volume volume is dried up massively. So if we go back to this kind of larger day, we can see it
434.96s: was 7 mil, 5.6 mil, 4.6 mil, and then now 5.2, 5.3 mil. So very, very light volume, quiet
444.08s: period is what I see. Now going to the options, we already talked a little bit about this again recently,
449.84s: but there's a few things that I think are worth noting. The first one is the put side did
454.88s: take up a little bit in terms of a lie, but still no or near closing in on that two to one ratio.
460.00s: And the other thing I have to keep hammering is the fact that GameStop is not centralized in the front
465.68s: explorations anymore, which is new. This continues to be slightly different than what we've seen
470.24s: previously when it was like highly active. So this isn't to suggest that it's inactive, but this
475.84s: tells me that people are playing things a little further out, which makes a lot of sense to me,
481.92s: because it's been quiet. So I'm not sure why we would want to play really near term moves
487.84s: if volume is slowing down, if price is consolidating. I think that's good for the stock to do that,
494.16s: as compared to too many big jumps around, it just creates choppiness and price, and it can
499.20s: chew a lot of traders up, which I don't want to see. But when I see price consolidating like this,
505.04s: it makes sense to me to see options starting to favor this kind of configuration, or spread out
511.28s: a little bit. We're not getting eviscerated via extrinsic value decaying away in our options.
517.52s: The other thing I want to show you is the wall surface really quick. So if I use specifically
522.16s: out of the money options, which is my preference, so it's going to look at out of the money calls and
525.44s: puts for the upside downside, let's get rid of this front explorations. It's always going to be
530.32s: skewed. And there's a few changes in this. And I look at this all the time. There's a few changes
536.40s: that I notice. The first one is take a look at this 11-Oct exploration, the blue line. Look how low
544.32s: this is for the at the monies. And then look how high all of these other explorations are.
550.72s: And then look at how high the 11-Oct penetrates out above all the others. That's unique.
557.36s: So this is something where I look to trade the expansion of the at the money wall relative
563.92s: potentially to the contraction of next cycle out of the money we're at the money wall,
569.52s: depending on where I can find ideal. I wouldn't call them mispricings, but definitely
574.72s: wall disparities to play relative value wall place here. But the thing I can tell you outright
580.24s: is that typically you would have the front expiration a bit higher than the others very normal.
584.96s: Also typically you have this put side being higher than the call side. That's also a market
589.28s: fears the downside very normal. But you normally would not have the at the monies for these 11s
596.24s: so low relative to all of these others. So for example, if we take a look at rocket,
603.52s: I've just had a curiosity. I don't know what it is. I didn't look at. But let's see.
607.36s: Yeah. So a bit of a different story already. Let me get rid of this front expiration.
612.64s: Well, that's just a fucking mess. So this is just madness. This is this is a smile like mine
619.76s: because this is it's got peaks here, trows here. This is all over the map. So this is a bad example.
627.76s: Let me show you something that would be at least a better example for the sake of a conversation.
633.12s: I'll get show you Apple and get rid of this. This is way more normal. So you notice how the call
638.72s: side typically is lower than the put side. Notice how this blue line is higher than most of the other
643.76s: lines. That's very, very standard exactly what I would expect to see. So the reason why this does
650.72s: this is because the front expiration becomes so pronounced that it overwhelms all the others and
656.00s: flat and some out on a relative basis. That's why I get rid of this one more at expiration because
660.48s: this will be so peaked out. All right. So now let's take a look and see if there's any interesting
665.68s: trades. I didn't see anything that stuck out to me. And again, I look at this every day, but
669.36s: we'll talk about a couple of these. So these we already covered. So I don't when I say I didn't
675.20s: see anything. It's not that anything didn't happen. But we already talked about these. We can see
680.24s: this build out further out in time. Much heavier exposure. This is actually similar to what you're
684.96s: seeing in rocket labs where we're not just playing the near term craziness. We're actually playing
689.92s: slightly longer term ideas here. That's where most of the money is. So from an options perspective
696.00s: that tells me again that the market is trying to play the long term move or at least a longer term
702.80s: move slash window as compared to this high concentration in the front expirations. So
709.60s: a game stop to me in general looks to be consolidating the areas that I'm really interested in.
714.64s: Let me get rid of Apple boring Apple. The areas I'm interested in realistically are if we start
720.56s: to see a break above here and it would need to be joined by volume or a break below here.
727.60s: This to me would indicate some sort of change to the downside. I'm going to get rid of this line
732.88s: just to make it a little cleaner. So you can see the range that I'm eyeballing here and I want to see
738.64s: breaks above or breaks below. And when I say want to see it's just because it helps me identify
747.04s: which way we're going. Right. Because right now it's very much a who knows right we're just
752.64s: chopping sideways. This is standard consolidation. But one thing I don't love is that this relative high
759.52s: here is lower than this. I would love to see that higher. Now also don't love that this low
765.68s: is slightly lower than this relative low. So that's typically a bit of a curve turning over. So
772.96s: we'll see how it goes sideways action for now. All right. Last one is AMC. And this was
780.64s: I'm not going to AMC's interesting to me to be clear all meme stocks are interesting to me. But
786.64s: I don't I haven't like gotten into the story for AMC like I have game stop. So I'm not going to
791.84s: pretend I know anything about AMC or game stop for that matter. But definitely even less AMC.
797.20s: So I'm just going to look at this purely from a trading lens. I don't want you guys to think
803.84s: that there's a lot of baked in ideas here because there really isn't I don't have a lot of context
808.88s: here for AMC. But the main thing I do see with AMC is it's essentially falling below this point
815.84s: of control. So the point of control clearly was established during this time frame when it was
820.96s: running sideways pretty hard. And then it's since started rotating down a little bit.
828.16s: So it's kind of exhibiting similar behavior as some of the other meme stocks. So to me it looks
832.96s: like near term floor looks like something like this. And this would be a close below that
839.20s: somewhere around there. And then really once we start breaking above this point of control is
844.64s: where it starts get interesting to me to the upside. Notice how I use a close for below.
850.24s: Simply because what I'm seeing is these candles are getting down towards these swings.
855.68s: They extend a little bit but then they suck back up in or they don't extend at all and they just
860.08s: hammer out. So there's not like these really big body candles that are crossing below this
865.28s: threshold and shooting back up above. So that's why I would want to see a close for something a
869.68s: little more definitive. And then for the above side of breakouts a breakout. So these things can
874.88s: start moving really really fast. So that's why this is a mark price alert. This is why this is a
881.20s: close price alert like difference in what I look for. The other thing I see here is volume is also
889.28s: siphoned out massively. So 10,000, 27, 12, 12, 9, 7, 9, 8, 5, almost 6, 9. So from here it's contracted a
902.48s: lot here. It actually expanded not not insignificant. Again, I'm going to zoom us in a little bit
908.32s: further so we can get rid of that madness. Yeah. So we can open this up a little bit and see
911.92s: on a relative basis. A lot of sale volume. See all this red. A lot of sale volume. And so yeah,
918.16s: it looks like we had a little bit of a peekiness and volume established here, which obviously
923.28s: kicked these averages up a little bit. But now the longer term moving average, I think we're
929.76s: right below that here. Yeah, it's 9.4 for a 20 day. So a little bit more volume activity from what
936.08s: I can see today compared to the last few days, but still not anything like what we were seeing in
941.76s: here around earnings or even before earnings. So this to me on a short term time frame does look
946.96s: way more like a downtrend. Right. So on a three month chart, linear, these are standard deviation
952.24s: channels negative sloping. I'm seeing continuation of lower highs. So a high here, a lower high here,
959.36s: a lower high here, a lower high here, a lower high here. That's a very standard
965.92s: downside continuation. Now the question always is where does it grab a bite and where does it start
971.12s: to level out? It looks like it's starting here. Right. So if we draw just a loose price level here,
979.44s: you can see that it kind of messed with this level here, here, here, and here. Sloppy though,
985.12s: right? Because that's a pretty meaningful range around this, not massive, but enough. And again,
989.28s: I always remind people when I'm looking at stuff like these different kinds of lines, I use the lines
994.56s: because they're easier, but that's not what I mentally visualize. What I mentally see when I draw
999.44s: those lines, I'll show you. It's a little bit more of like a value area. So what I would do is I
1004.48s: would grab essentially this. Right. So movements in this area are what start to interest me because we can
1014.08s: see it bounced off of it here. And then if I zoom this out a little bit for context, we can see that
1020.48s: it interacted with this same level back here, right? That's I wasn't zoomed in there. It's not by
1025.12s: happenstance. Just kind of out goes. So last thing I want to look at in here are the options.
1031.60s: And let's kill this front wall. Yeah. So very put heavy stuff. Nothing jumping out at me there.
1038.24s: Let's grab all of these tremendous calls you.
1043.92s: From Mendes. One mill versus 244,000 puts. That's massive. Like unequivocally, that is massive.
1052.24s: And there is a lot traded today. Look at this. 63,000 calls traded today. 52% were bought of those 63.
1061.28s: That's interesting. That's really, really interesting to me. That's not insignificant.
1068.96s: Fascinating. So let's see where that volume was concentrated.
1075.20s: So it looks like a little bit of rolling activity, right? So taking the fronts, meaning the four,
1079.44s: moving them out to the 11th, it does have earnings on 7 November. So what I want to do now is see
1086.72s: for open interest, where is it concentrated? The 11th has 40, 18th has 81, 13, 11, 3, 71.
1098.80s: 82, 281. So this is where it starts getting deep. Yeah. There it is again. 154.
1106.96s: So a lot of this volume is at, look at all that. That's over half the volume is greater than 17 JN out.
1114.80s: So these were longer term plays. That's most of what I see here. This is not people playing a bunch
1119.68s: of like near term movement expectations because over 600,000 of these calls are further out in time.
1126.64s: So interesting there. Last thing we'll take a look at quick is any interesting trades for the week.
1134.40s: And this looks quiet. So I see largest trade here was 89. Let's see just between all of them.
1142.72s: If there's any big trades, and when I say all of them, just the sides of the trades, I normally look
1147.36s: at calls on the offer, but we can see sometimes if there's something close to the mid that maybe
1152.56s: lean towards the offer or whatever, but this is pretty small in here to me.
1157.76s: So most interesting part about AMC here for me definitely is this this calls you. That's pretty
1162.88s: significant. I'm actually guessing that's probably why somebody asked me to look at that.
1165.84s: This is because they know I look at that stuff. So interesting. All right, gang. Well, that wraps me
1171.36s: up for today. We have options trading for beginners 5 p.m. tonight, GME live stream tomorrow,
1175.44s: 5 p.m. Pacific time, and then market prep on Sunday for the outlier pro members.
1179.92s: If you guys anything, hit me up. Let me know if there's anything you want me to take a look at.
1182.72s: More than happy to be an outlier. See y'all later.
