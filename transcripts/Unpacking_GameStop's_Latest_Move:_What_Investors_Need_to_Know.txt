0.12s: here's a 30-day 4our chart GameStop
4.80s: notice anything about it anything
6.32s: special anything stick out to you other
9.52s: than the fact that it is parabolic up
14.32s: and right it's gone from 20 A2 it hit a
17.48s: high today of 28 I did a video on it
20.00s: yesterday but I have to talk about it
22.16s: again simply because it's showing a lot
24.16s: of movement and the options markets are
27.48s: also getting heavily involved and
29.24s: there's a couple really important things
30.56s: I want to highlight as I look at this
32.16s: specific chart now first and foremost I
36.48s: don't do a ton of like Candlestick
40.28s: patterns but I do look at candlesticks
43.24s: for the qualitative information that
44.96s: they can provide to us because they can
47.20s: do that so for example if we look at a
51.08s: candle like this it has a relatively
53.96s: small body where it opened here closed
56.28s: here and it obviously had much longer
59.12s: high and low wig
60.88s: what that tells me is that over the
62.96s: course of this candle's lifespan which
65.04s: for those interested right now again
66.68s: it's a 30-day 4H hour chart so it's a
68.80s: 4-Hour time frame in this candle it
71.60s: tells me that there's a really
73.20s: significant battle over price it means
76.48s: that at some point it opened here it
79.28s: went all the way up to here then enough
81.88s: sellers stepped in and then some to
84.16s: drive it all the way down somewhere
86.24s: towards here buyers stepped in enough
88.36s: and then they reconciled down here
90.92s: that's a different story than the second
95.20s: half of what you see
97.00s: today so this is the candle essentially
99.84s: from 10:30 Pacific Time into the close
102.12s: it opened down here notice how it has no
104.48s: tail to the downside that tells me that
106.88s: this is voracious buying pressure up
110.12s: until it started breaking above 28 then
114.60s: it stepped into moderate cell pressure
117.04s: notice how this candle split almost
118.64s: 50/50 it's 57 buy 43 cell in terms of
121.92s: volume but all of that happened in here
125.44s: so this is still really extensive buy
127.92s: pressure and we've seen this sustained
130.56s: over a few days now which I find
132.32s: interesting the video yesterday that I
133.96s: did literally was talking about the
135.80s: importance of 25 and I even said
140.48s: yesterday I genuinely believed that it
143.88s: would break through 25 simply because of
146.56s: the way it acted here it popped above 25
150.00s: 5 got pushed down just below and it
153.08s: means lots of people happily unwinding
155.92s: that started happening today but take a
157.92s: look at the expansion in volume still
161.40s: we've gone from 5.5 million here now
166.84s: 15.9
168.76s: 25.7 this is where things are busy now I
172.60s: know a lot of gme um community members
176.44s: Apes they are looking for moas which
180.56s: hats off I hope I hope you get it but
184.28s: for those like myself again I I am very
187.44s: straight forward with you all I have my
190.04s: position in GameStop but I trade around
192.92s: GameStop at the same time the reason why
194.56s: I trade around it is because this kind
196.92s: of movement is really tradable and again
199.96s: in the video yesterday I talked about
202.04s: the position that I built here in
204.04s: addition to my existing position simply
206.32s: from the expansion of volume and trying
207.96s: to play at least a probable IC move and
211.44s: another note people were asking why did
213.44s: I enter here instead of something like
215.72s: here or before when it looked like it
217.76s: was building a floor and it's because I
220.28s: need movement I a Trader this is how I
223.20s: make money is by trading I need to
225.24s: realize the gain in order for me to make
228.76s: money that's how I live so the issue
232.48s: with this is sometimes stocks can stay
235.52s: really quiet on these periods so I don't
238.44s: like getting in during these for a trade
241.92s: now if it's for a longer thematic
244.28s: position it's completely different
245.96s: because this is showing you again I
247.60s: didn't draw this line anytime recently
249.36s: this has been here for at least a month
251.76s: and this we can see that there's a floor
254.60s: here and whether or not it breaks
256.76s: through that floor is TBD right price
258.92s: can always do whatever it wants but the
260.48s: main point is that it didn't here that's
263.88s: worth noting so I enter here because
268.16s: it's a low risk RK trade in terms of how
271.64s: I structure the position the risk on the
274.72s: position itself is set with an exit
277.36s: below this perceived floor which is 20
279.84s: 25ish something like that I had gotten
282.80s: in at 2173 so it's about point and a
286.40s: quarter of total risk which is Trivial
289.28s: it's tiny so then you can build a much
292.28s: larger position because the risk is
294.84s: managed to the downside and then see if
298.40s: you can get a bigger move it's about
300.08s: creating an asymmetric payoff potential
302.76s: again for the shorter term aspect of the
304.72s: trade so I wanted to talk about that cuz
307.64s: I I got literally two emails about it
309.44s: which are great questions and I I want
312.08s: what I do to be explained and understood
314.80s: by people so you understand when I'm
316.76s: analyzing this stuff how I'm looking at
318.32s: it because there's two very different
320.28s: perspectives that I see three actually
322.68s: with GameStop there's the structural
324.64s: perspective in terms of its manipulation
326.72s: and the way that its manipulation is
328.28s: somewhat predictable to a degree and how
330.44s: that can be traded the second time frame
333.12s: or the second perspective is a shorter
334.68s: term time frame which results around
336.88s: trading these kinds of moves and then
339.36s: the third perspective is the longer term
341.24s: time frame where GameStop is now sitting
343.80s: on literally stock piles of cash slowly
347.36s: starting to reinvent itself as a
348.96s: business and I cannot root hard enough
352.44s: for GameStop to get through all of it's
354.88s: been through so far because this was
357.76s: almost another victim of seller boxing
360.56s: which is just shitty it's shitty that
363.00s: that is a thing and people are that
364.36s:  greedy so I love it from a
367.88s: long-term perspective because it's doing
369.36s: a good job Reinventing itself is like a
371.28s: legitimate business it's not just a
372.60s: charity case a lot of time one of the
375.60s: thing that supported GameStop for so
377.36s: long was a voracious investor community
380.88s: that was just like we just like the
382.12s: stock we don't care you guys we'll
383.88s: stay here for three years and for three
387.40s: years the stock might not do a ton but
389.24s: we don't care we're still here and
391.40s: that's admirable because without that
393.24s: kind of support GameStop would probably
394.76s: be in a different picture but now it
396.84s: becomes an even more interesting story
398.76s: in my opinion because they just started
401.56s: the new branching out with card grading
403.56s: which is really cool Newton was teaching
404.96s: me about that which is really neat I
406.40s: don't do collectible cards it's not
407.84s: really in my wheelhouse but it's cool as
410.12s: a business line and you can see that
411.52s: they're Reinventing themselves that's
414.04s: you you can't enjoy that enough so we
416.72s: are seeing a really significant move
418.84s: here that's what this comes down to take
420.32s: a look now it does look like the next
424.32s: serious volume node right we already
426.04s: broke through this one single day popped
427.88s: right above it didn't care Off to the
429.52s: Races the next serious volume node
432.28s: really starts that it's going to
433.84s: interact with is this here and this is
436.28s: using a six-month daily chart so it's
438.24s: looking at essentially the 27 to 28
442.56s: handle something like that if I go up to
444.32s: a year you can see that that volume node
446.76s: holds and it's already breaking through
449.20s: it
450.84s: so the interesting part here is as it
454.52s: breaks through this there's really not a
458.08s: lot of overhead support that's in the
461.28s: market now the reason why overhead
463.68s: support or I'm sorry overhead resistance
466.08s: the reason why overhead resistance is so
467.92s: important is because overhead resistance
470.48s: comes in the form of again all these
472.64s: different traders that got in at really
474.36s: high levels that are selling because
476.80s: there are people that got in at 50 that
478.84s: are just happy to have an opportunity to
480.88s: get out even at a marginal profit if
483.20s: they continued scaling in which a ton of
484.80s: people transacted in here look at the
486.28s: size of these candles and volume
488.32s: thousands and thousands and thousands of
490.12s: people were transacting in this entire
492.52s: range so there's a good chance a lot of
494.76s: these people will look to unwind here
497.36s: but so far it doesn't matter the buying
501.08s: pressure is showing up now let's take a
503.04s: look at the option side of things
505.68s: because here's another thing that is
507.96s: incredible to me take a look at the
510.08s: calls 420 literally can't make that up
513.32s: 420,000 calls against 77,000 puts
516.80s: incredible incredible call volume on the
520.04s: day what's even more interesting now to
522.44s: me is the fact that take a look at how
525.12s: many of these were bought over 30%
528.04s: likely were bought you because you can't
530.00s: tell on the mid but some of this mid is
531.72s: going to be bought some of it's going to
532.80s: be sold so definitely over 30% will have
536.00s: been bought of this total volume so
538.48s: there are there there's massive massive
540.80s: influx of calls coming in and take a
544.60s: look they're short dated so if you take
547.56s: a look at these different strikes now
549.64s: the 30s had
551.36s: 53,000 contracts trade today we have the
555.16s: 25s at
557.32s: 33,8
558.92s: 46 so what does that mean well if we
561.64s: come in here and we start to take a Peak
564.68s: at if we start getting near the 30s it
567.28s: gets really interesting because the open
569.76s: interest here on the 30s is literally
571.92s: about to double the existing oi right
574.44s: now is 23k there's 53k transacted today
577.76s: so at least half of that is going to
579.72s: Port over to new trades it doesn't look
582.28s: like there are a ton of Trades that were
583.56s: closed so the only risk I see here right
587.72s: now in terms of like really starting to
589.32s: build out a big move is this is still
592.80s: heavily predicated on underlying
595.28s: transactions driving this and I say that
598.00s: because the total open interest in here
600.96s: essentially from the 27 and2 28 282 29
604.80s: is very light so we obviously saw a bit
607.88s: of a ramp happen here not significant
610.52s: but enough to Edge price for sure
613.08s: through some hedging Behavior because
615.64s: this in and of itself isn't going to
617.40s: cause massive hedging Behavior 33,000
620.60s: were traded today but the 1452 that were
622.76s: added over Friday not a ton of activity
625.72s: on that just yet so what I'm looking for
629.16s: is is to see what this materializes into
632.40s: cuz take a look at these 28s
636.60s: 16,700 volume today against
639.80s: 3000i it's moving after hours just
642.80s: ticked up almost to 28 if this 28 gets
646.72s: gobbled up that starts to look pretty
649.56s: aggressive to me because these again are
652.36s: a little bit weaker but there's been so
655.20s: much added here at the 30s that it's
658.48s: likely going to for some hedging
660.20s: Behavior there's still pretty low Delta
663.16s: so it wouldn't surprise me if market
664.96s: makers tried to be cheap here but again
667.28s: the tricky part about this whole thing
668.60s: is that it's still not hard to borrow so
671.68s: the access to shares isn't going to
674.12s: cause a restriction just yet and there's
676.84s: not enough in this options chain to like
679.24s: really force a true gamma squeeze but it
681.60s: can absolutely add some pressure and I I
683.64s: I fully expect to see that now a couple
686.76s: other things take a look here we have
689.84s: some serious size entering the equation
692.92s: so there's some really big trades going
695.20s: down and this doesn't surprise me by the
697.12s: way you see these out in 2025 how
700.04s: they're moving these are people that
701.44s: establish these I I have trades that are
703.48s: further out in time literally for these
705.00s: kinds of instances because what you can
707.32s: do is you can get them on for pretty
708.64s: cheap when you get your move you can
710.28s: unwind part of your position to cover
712.20s: the remaining cost of your existing
713.60s: position so it's literally a risk-free
715.04s: trade so that then you can hold on to it
717.28s: up until expiration with no issue and if
720.28s: you get a giant move now it's a true
722.60s: asymmetric payoff potential so seeing
725.80s: some of these longer term options coming
727.40s: off doesn't surprise me at all what I am
729.72s: interested in specifically though are
731.72s: what's happening with this near near
734.52s: expiration this upcoming Opex the reason
737.04s: why this matters so much is because this
738.88s: is where the near-term pressure starts
740.48s: to come in and we can see a few things I
742.60s: want to make sure I'm not filtering by
743.92s: any size it looks like we're good and
746.44s: I'm sorting by premium so we can see
748.60s: that there's a few $100,000 trades
750.80s: coming in today the reason why these are
752.44s: like actually a little more impactful
754.08s: than I typically would give Credence to
755.80s: this size trade is because it's for this
757.84s: Friday this is for a really short
760.72s: duration so these are really strong
763.40s: trades that need movement and they need
765.68s: movement fast in order for them to
767.92s: really show a profit so you have a th000
770.76s: of the 27s here 1 th000 of the 27s here
773.68s: again it's really really hard to see
776.12s: because this almost looks like they were
777.92s: offloaded here right so it could be
779.60s: somebody that bought ,000 $156 another
782.44s: th000 at 2 Unwound the whole thing at
784.56s: 230 they still made a decent chunk of
787.20s: change on that trade if it's the same
788.88s: person it's a little hard to tell so
791.08s: this looks like some near-term trading
792.76s: activity to Me overall the other thing I
795.48s: want to take a look at really quick is
797.52s: just the actual uh dark pool feed on
800.20s: shares and see um if there's anything
803.92s: that jumps out at us here I haven't
805.84s: looked at this
807.44s: yet and
809.72s: a couple let me sort this by
813.96s: premium yeah I mean there's some big
816.24s: trades coming through this is a little
818.20s: bit more
819.44s: too this is over the last I want to say
822.84s: like 90 days it's looking so let's
824.92s: restrict this to
826.88s: today and we have three of them four of
830.72s: them that are over a million
833.48s: bucks so there's there's pretty
836.28s: significant overall
840.12s: share volume here now let's take a look
842.84s: over the last week out of
847.64s: curiosity and you can see yeah the the
851.24s: the bulk of these larger trades are
852.76s: really focused on today so I just wanted
855.76s: that for General context it looks like
857.44s: the the stock definitely has some pretty
860.76s: significant um volume stepping in no
863.68s: doubt so next steps we need to see how
866.80s: this continues to run I think one of the
868.52s: most important things to keep in mind is
870.64s: that this has pretty significant
872.16s: Tailwinds right now pretty significant
873.88s: Tailwinds and a lot of that stems from
876.52s: this this is the Russell 2000 Futures
880.12s: Russell 2000 iwm all of them looking at
882.72s: the same thing but small caps are on a
885.76s: freaking tear so this is finally adding
888.76s: wind to the back of gme where for a lot
891.88s: of small caps gme included it's been win
893.88s: in the face and it's still been
896.56s: increasing slightly even in that context
899.08s: attack so on a longer term time frame
903.08s: this looks like the floor to me 19 and2
906.44s: to the low side it looks like about 20
909.68s: and a half is being respected so far and
913.28s: that's essentially been the case from
915.52s: the end of September so we'll see where
918.96s: hopefully um the floor just continues to
922.36s: slide up on this thing because from a
923.88s: fundamental perspective it kind of
926.00s: warrants some of it and right now the
930.52s: next threshold that we need to get
932.88s: through is going to be this block here
935.32s: really and it's not even that severe the
938.04s: the 28 handle so that's what I'm looking
940.80s: at as always if you have any questions
942.44s: anything you want me to take a look at
943.52s: let me know be an outlier be an ape I'll
945.40s: see youall later
