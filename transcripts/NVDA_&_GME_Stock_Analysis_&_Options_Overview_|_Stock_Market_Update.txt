0.72s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.64s: before the YouTube live session later
4.32s: today I just got off the inversion table
6.56s: so your boy thinking crystal clear but I
9.48s: want to talk about two products I want
11.76s: to talk about Nvidia and then I want to
14.64s: talk about GameStop primarily because
17.32s: both have earnings coming up slightly
19.80s: different time frames but for NVIDIA
22.40s: we're looking at earnings coming up here
26.16s: on the 28th after the market so that'll
31.04s: be this Wednesday now when I've been
33.56s: keeping an eyeball on it I'm seeing a
35.28s: lot of companies exhibit this exact
38.36s: price Behavior specifically within Tech
41.40s: where we are just navigating sideways
44.80s: into earnings uh another recent example
47.20s: of this actually is chewy right we had
49.44s: this nice rally and it's just been
50.64s: trending sideways quietly leading into
53.68s: earnings I'm kind of just seeing that
56.16s: happening uh with quite a few products
58.44s: here and again chewy is not in Tech I
60.76s: give that as a noncorrelated
63.32s: comparison so a couple things here the
66.52s: first one is implied volatility is very
69.36s: high we have implied volatility raw at
72.72s: 77% and then the implied volatility
75.48s: percentile puts us at
77.56s: 97% and for those that are unfamiliar
80.60s: with the difference between implied
82.24s: volatility implied volatility percentile
84.48s: implied volatility Rank and why some of
87.20s: those are better than others I'll throw
89.36s: a link in in the notes below for you to
91.16s: check out but I definitely prefer
93.24s: implied volatility percentile because it
94.88s: gives me a cleaner look and volume has
98.88s: been also fairly static we can see both
102.32s: primary time frames I track the the
104.48s: averages on the 5day and the 20-day and
108.00s: they're kind of just floating sideways
109.60s: here so again no big surprise to that
113.40s: end from me it looks like we're really
115.60s: looking ahead to earnings and rightfully
117.76s: so so what is the expect well the first
120.80s: thing is when I take a look at the
123.56s: options
124.84s: chain and we take a look at the
127.64s: positioning that we have leading into
130.36s: earnings I'm going to take a look at all
133.76s: we have 13 million 13.1 million calls
137.92s: against 13.1 million puts so about same
141.16s: same now one of my preferred tools now
144.08s: is to look at just the expiration cycle
147.88s: that has earnings because this this has
150.16s: all sorts of contracts in here and you
152.56s: can tell if I look at the put side you
155.44s: see all these white boxes these are all
157.88s: further out in time this is 17g and 25
160.56s: these are people adding General broader
163.00s: portfolio Hedges designed to take place
166.52s: over a longer period of time they're
167.80s: hedging their stock Yad yada y this
170.00s: doesn't tell me how we're positioning
173.04s: specifically for earnings however we can
175.56s: easily get to that if we take a look at
177.68s: this and when we look at specifically
180.52s: for earnings I see
183.20s: 950,000
184.84s: calls again
187.24s: 788 th000 puts so there's very clearly a
193.08s: bit of a call skew but it's not enough
196.16s: for me at least that I would consider
198.64s: this heavily remarkable so I don't see
202.52s: like a clear signal that I would lean on
206.56s: just in terms of OI and I say that
209.08s: because sometimes you can see that it's
210.96s: a little harder with really big stocks
213.72s: especially like Mega cap stocks like
216.04s: Nvidia the ability for you to come in
218.16s: here and see a massive skew is overall
221.16s: pretty unlikely now if I look at the
224.40s: implied volatility for the upcoming
227.28s: cycle we can see that we are pricing in
229.56s: the downside which is not meaning that
231.76s: the options markets is expecting a
233.60s: downside move necessarily but this is
236.72s: standard put skew with respect to V that
239.40s: is very common especially in bigger
241.04s: products like this we tend to hedge and
243.72s: fear the downside a little bit more than
246.48s: playing to the upside this is super
248.16s: common so again nothing anomalous here a
250.72s: lot of what I look at in markets when I
253.08s: look at this stuff is just seeing if
255.28s: something looks off or weird that's
258.48s: pretty much it and in this case not so
261.08s: far now taking a look at the volume
263.28s: today specifically for the 30 a there's
267.84s: 700,000 calls against 41,000 puts that
272.00s: actually is slightly interesting to me
274.60s: because if I take a look at the change
276.96s: in oi in this front expiration cycle my
280.04s: guess is people are actually just now
282.20s: starting to build into their earnings
283.88s: positions which is essentially what I
286.08s: will be doing I wait until it gets very
288.56s: very close before I place any sort of
290.48s: earnings positions because I'm trying to
292.08s: isolate the earnings move itself so now
296.20s: let's take a quick look at how it's
299.04s: performed during previous earnings if
301.76s: you're not familiar with this analyze
303.64s: Tab and what I'm showing you here I got
306.08s: another video in the description below
308.20s: that I recently put out actually that's
310.64s: doing terribly by the way so you should
312.40s: go check it out so that it can probably
314.72s: emerge through the YouTube algorithm but
317.68s: I just do like a a really quick walkr of
319.64s: the analyze Tab and this is one of the
321.04s: tools that I use a lot which lets me
322.84s: look at the previous earnings so looking
324.96s: at the the past series of earnings most
327.08s: of the bigger gaps that I see are to the
329.24s: upside essentially exclusively there are
331.80s: a couple down moves like here but it's
333.96s: pretty moderate same thing here and I
336.60s: regularly see historic V exceeding
339.04s: implied so for me that tells me it's
341.56s: more of a directional earnings play in
343.44s: my opinion so there's a couple other
346.52s: things we can look at specifically with
349.04s: respect to pre- and post movements and a
352.40s: big thing that I like to pay attention
354.32s: to is just what's the variance in IV
357.72s: before and after we can see that for all
359.36s: these different expiration Cycles but
361.40s: then also just what's the overall move
363.92s: that we see on a relative basis um after
366.92s: earnings is announced and to the upside
369.44s: it looks like one of the largest moves
371.96s: we see is 27% which is pretty massive
374.96s: and then to the downside it's not
376.36s: terrible we're looking at like neg5 I
378.56s: see7 there so overall not uh a pretty
382.60s: significant down move but again to be
384.92s: clear this is looking all the way back
386.68s: from the starting point of 5 days before
388.60s: what I care about is the movement around
390.92s: earnings itself but it does seem to have
394.04s: a bit of positive drift now the one
396.12s: exception I would say in my opinion
398.40s: towards this earning specifically is
401.76s: show me the money and what I mean by
403.76s: that is nvidia's got to deliver they got
405.72s: to be on the freaking ball here because
409.52s: they have been valued into the sky and
414.00s: Beyond they have to deliver near
416.88s: perfectly in order for this kind of
419.08s: valuation to maintain can this kind of
421.64s: parabolic upside valuation continue it
424.84s: can but it needs to be supported by near
428.84s: perfect delivery which will look like
431.44s: another really solid EPS beat it will
434.52s: look like increased sales revenue those
436.88s: kinds of things so I'm actually really
439.40s: really eager to see because to me it
441.20s: looked like a lot of the earnings we
442.48s: were seeing before this was the kind of
443.76s: like the Euphoria of understanding how
445.88s: big this Market could be specifically
448.04s: through Ai and stuff like that and the
449.72s: support Nvidia supports for it and I
453.80s: think now we have an opportunity to see
455.92s: like what does this look like in a
457.32s: little bit of a more mature phase
459.40s: because again the market is a
460.72s: discounting mechanism it's not what have
463.32s: you done for me and it's not what are
464.96s: you doing today it's what are you doing
466.96s: over the next 6 to n months that I care
469.72s: about so this will be a really important
472.96s: earnings release in my opinion and then
475.20s: we have crowd favorite gme bummed today
480.04s: I didn't like this move this is sending
482.84s: us a little bit now on a declining
486.08s: pattern on this really short term time
488.00s: frame so if I take this into like a
489.44s: 30-day this is 4 hours so each candle
492.12s: here is for 4 hours just because most of
493.80s: mine are daily candles I don't want to
495.12s: confuse anybody so it's essentially two
497.92s: candles to each day and essentially
502.80s: from Friday what two weeks ago we've
506.88s: slowly been rotating over now now we're
509.76s: getting to the point where the
511.24s: consolidation in my opinion is starting
513.36s: to break so the first half of the day we
516.08s: fell out of this really tight
518.04s: consolidation Zone which I kind of Mark
520.12s: it by the bottom these lows here we fell
522.88s: out below that and then we continued
524.48s: below it I'm seeing the moving averages
526.76s: starting to rotate over which doesn't um
530.04s: look favorably at least near-term in my
532.56s: opinion and we're looking at the slopes
535.96s: of some of the longer term moving
537.92s: averages essentially leveling out which
541.00s: again I I don't love to see so from a
544.68s: chart perspective I was actually kind of
547.96s: hoping it would be a little bit more
549.88s: quiet leading into earnings and then
552.36s: once we got closer to earnings maybe we
554.20s: would see a little bit of an expansion
556.16s: in volume or something like that but
558.28s: we're still looking at just highly
560.96s: highly compressed volume now on a solid
563.64s: note I suppose we did exceed the 5day
567.24s: average volume of 3.7 mil we hit at 4.7
570.20s: mil which is good but we're still at
572.76s: least a mil below the 20-day average and
575.20s: at this point you can see again just
577.04s: from the size of these they're they're
579.76s: the volume is so contracted not even
582.40s: again comparing it to the squeeze here
584.48s: but to this time frame in here as well
586.92s: the volume is just so so so light so to
589.96s: me it looks like we are really coming
591.52s: into a bit of a a quiet SL rotation
594.96s: period from a charting perspective I'm
598.60s: seeing a lot of high percentage sale
601.96s: volume on the day and yeah I mean it'll
607.36s: be like that sometimes if something is
610.60s: like highly in favor and then Capital
612.64s: starts rotating out for whatever reason
615.52s: and then if I take a look at the RSI
618.96s: which I like to use two different lines
621.12s: I use a smoothing period in this case
622.92s: it's a four period and then I use the
625.28s: RSI line itself and you can see here I I
629.44s: like to track the slope of both the RSI
632.96s: and the EMA over the previous day so
635.80s: they're both turning down and typically
638.28s: when I see RSI dropping below the four
640.84s: period that generally favors a little
643.80s: bit more of a downside move normally I
646.20s: use this as kind of a momentum indicator
648.16s: personally where if I see it flattening
650.92s: is when I won't add more so this is
653.04s: actually another reason why bit of an
655.28s: aside here but when I take a look at uh
658.24s: QQQ I've already started trimming and
661.68s: flattening out my Q's position because
663.56s: it's exhibiting the same behavior does
665.52s: that mean that it can't pivot and go up
667.00s: it absolutely can and if it does I'm
668.80s: here for it but it's not what it's doing
671.36s: so again from a trading perspective my
673.56s: job is to do what it's doing not what I
675.20s: wanted to do so in this case this is
677.20s: also starting that so for my trading a
680.24s: lot of people ask me about that and I'm
681.52s: always happy to share I'm I'm a open
683.20s: book with respect to it I try not to
684.76s: make it the focus of it I try to focus
686.84s: more on just providing you information
688.84s: that you can digest and do whatever you
690.68s: want with it hopefully to to help inform
693.80s: the way you model things and provide
696.00s: data but beyond that so the way I'm
698.48s: looking at it is the same as usual I
700.40s: still have my long shares but I'm
702.08s: selling calls against the long shares to
704.36s: capitalize on the price rotating down to
706.48s: hedge some of the long share bullish
708.68s: directional preference but I sell them
711.28s: at a ratio so what that means is if I
713.84s: have 100 shares and I sell one call if I
719.24s: play that scenario out and GameStop
721.32s: rallies well then I don't participate to
723.08s: the upside cuz I've capped my upside
725.32s: potential cuz I have a one:1 ratio of
728.16s: short calls which again for those
729.96s: unfamiliar each one call equals 100
732.16s: shares so in this kind of scenario what
734.96s: I'm doing is let's say I have 5,000
737.40s: shares of GameStop well I can sell maybe
740.68s: 10 15 calls something like that so I
744.92s: still am very much preferring the upside
747.76s: move but I'm Al going to make a little
749.96s: bit of money while we're oscillating
751.76s: sideways and then if there is a really
753.64s: big upside move I still have a bunch of
755.72s: shares in that scenario that would not
757.64s: be covered so that's the the broader
760.60s: thesis here again quick reminder still
762.72s: have earnings coming up looking at the
765.20s: fourth before the open and then when I
768.24s: look at the options in here I see a few
772.52s: things going on the first one is we're
775.40s: actually accelerating on the call side
777.12s: more than I thought which I'm I'm
778.44s: actually very happy about that what I
780.52s: mean by that is I'm seeing 8,000 calls
782.80s: against 264k puts so we're almost at
785.24s: that 2:1 ratio again that I like to look
787.36s: for and in GameStop really I I prefer to
789.68s: be even higher like three I've seen it
791.72s: up to four and change but that's when
794.08s: we're in a really bullish configuration
796.00s: I still just like that we're playing to
797.40s: the upside that's what this tells me and
799.52s: I love seeing that disposition here now
802.24s: the other thing I've been keeping a
804.16s: really close eye on is this which I just
806.68s: am confounded by it again I will never
809.40s:  you guys if there's something I
810.96s: don't know I'm going to tell you and the
813.52s: overwhelming majority of instances I
815.64s: would expect to see earnings with higher
818.48s: volatility than this next random week
820.96s: Beyond earnings this week is becoming a
823.76s: bit of a puzzle to me if anybody knows
825.40s: what's going on in the 13th of September
827.96s: I would be so eager to understand and
830.64s: learn about it because something's going
832.16s: on there the fact that the earnings week
834.92s: is at 72% the week after earnings is
838.04s: 92.6 % and then it drops to 87% that's
842.00s: not normal something weird is going on
844.64s: there so my guess is the market is
847.16s: expecting something the week of the 13th
850.08s: I don't know what I don't know why but
852.08s: that's all I can see from the vs here
853.84s: that again as you could tell I am quite
856.28s: infatuated by a couple people have asked
858.60s: me like why do I keep covering GameStop
861.32s: even though it's it's not doing a whole
862.88s: lot it's literally for things like this
864.96s: I continue to find from an options
867.56s: trading perspective the the long longer
869.36s: you do this stuff the less stuff
871.04s: surprises you because you see a lot of
872.96s: it but this product continues to put all
876.08s: these strange anomalies in front of me
878.76s: that I just find intriguing to explore
881.20s: like this right here that's anomalous so
884.44s: I like learning about it and digging
886.16s: into it and yeah so it's it's one of the
888.68s: reasons why I love taking a look at the
890.16s: product now let's take a quick scoll
892.08s: down time and sales because this stuck
894.48s: out to me we started seeing some actual
897.76s: volume coming into today and this is
901.16s: looking at the call side all of these
904.88s: are purchases so we're seeing blocks of
908.28s: 500 coming out at the 21 a halfes in 30
912.60s: August
914.40s: curious then we're seeing some blocks in
918.32s: six step and 13 Step at the 23s and the
922.44s: 22 and a Hales these are starting to get
925.60s: to be meaningful size positions not huge
927.96s: but larger
929.48s: for an alternate view we can see here
931.48s: through our friends over at unusual
934.84s: Wales uh again the the size of these
937.72s: trades is not big 88,000 like these are
940.16s: relatively small trades but what I do
942.44s: find interesting is that we're seeing a
944.64s: couple of these sep expirations getting
946.92s: hit and again what I find interesting is
949.68s: this one the fact that we're starting to
951.84s: see a little bit of build out in this 13
954.28s: step I don't know what 13 step is but
957.60s: it's something
959.96s: I don't know what it is but it's
961.36s: something and I can clearly see that
963.04s: it's something the stuff playing the
966.40s: shorter term stuff like the the 6p my
969.36s: guess is these are kind of earnings
970.92s: shots of some sort I don't honestly know
973.60s: why you would buy calls into earnings
975.68s: here because typically V will tend to
977.92s: contract but again in this case my
980.12s: expectation is V will continue to expand
982.52s: actually pretty meaningfully so this
984.68s: could be somebody that's playing a
986.04s: little bit of a directional disposition
987.76s: but then also trying to play play an
989.16s: expansion in IV because 63 12% Vols for
993.08s: this is is light I think and there's a
996.00s: good chance that the Vols in here will
997.80s: expand even if the option itself doesn't
1000.80s: move that much the other thing you can't
1003.28s: help but find
1007.88s: 1069 just a fun number I suppose now I
1012.72s: does look like unusual Wales is
1015.36s: combining that with a couple other
1017.12s: orders here because they take them up to
1019.76s: 2,000 and I can see a couple other
1022.72s: transactions going through for the six
1026.04s: app right so I can see a Trona 350 come
1028.40s: through here and stuff like that so
1029.96s: there's a chance this could be somebody
1031.64s: hitting it repeat actually we can check
1033.40s: that really fast this one came through
1035.28s: at like 10 uh what is that 10:57 so this
1039.28s: is Pacific Time by the way so let me
1041.28s: scroll down to
1043.60s: 1057 and see if we can find a couple
1047.12s: other transactions yeah in here
1050.08s: yeah so it looks like that person built
1051.60s: up and it looks like they gave them all
1053.32s: of these
1056.00s: here but that still is a little bit
1059.20s: light for the
1061.84s: 2K so I'm not sure which other
1064.44s: transactions unusual whales attributed
1066.84s: to them unusual whales has a slightly
1069.20s: different system where they'll look a
1071.24s: little bit broader in terms of time
