0.06s: risk management for Traders it's not
2.34s: what you think the vast majority of
4.26s: people really don't understand what this
6.96s: means or what it looks like so we're
9.00s: gonna do two things the first thing is
10.44s: I'm going to show you real examples of
13.14s: what retail Traders think about when it
15.84s: comes to risk management and then the
17.58s: second thing is I'm going to walk you
19.32s: through exactly how I manage risk in an
23.22s: active trading portfolio I've been doing
24.90s: this since
25.88s: 2007. so let's take a quick look and
28.94s: Baseline on what the Godfather himself
32.52s: says about risk the first world on
35.52s: investment is don't lose and the second
37.56s: rule on investment is don't forget the
38.82s: first rule and that's all the rules
40.02s: there are I mean well there it is
41.52s: couldn't say it better myself and if you
43.80s: couldn't hear because it's kind of an
44.82s: old video essentially he's ingest saying
47.52s: the first rule is don't lose and the
49.38s: second rule is don't forget rule number
51.06s: one which is don't lose why is that the
52.92s: does that matter so much well let's take
54.84s: a look this is is a projection for
57.96s: compound growth and I'll get my head out
59.76s: of the way in a second but I want to
61.02s: show you something we have this first
62.76s: portfolio on the left hand side we're
64.68s: looking at a hundred thousand dollars in
66.18s: total and it has all positive years
68.52s: although one year it went ten percent
70.92s: ten percent two percent ten percent five
73.14s: percent so overall we had a pretty slow
74.76s: year let's compare that to portfolio
77.04s: three which is right underneath my head
78.78s: here we have thirty percent so this
81.00s: return is three times the highest return
83.82s: that portfolio one saw then we had a 25
86.66s: drawdown then 12 14 12 all of the
90.66s: returns here except for that one single
92.70s: negative return is higher than what we
94.98s: saw in portfolio one yet portfolio one
97.38s: walked away with more money 142 550
100.26s: compared to 139 you might be saying oh
102.42s: that's pretty close it is but if you
104.40s: take a look at the impact of this
106.92s: drawdown and what this has on our
109.86s: compounding returns long term this is
113.52s: catastrophic you have a portfolio that
116.10s: absolutely has crushed the first
118.26s: portfolio yet it walks out ahead look at
120.54s: the average return 8.6 percent compared
122.88s: to 7.4 percent 1.2 percent higher in
126.48s: portfolio three is the average return
127.92s: including this giant negative year
129.54s: however the compound annual growth rate
131.76s: lacks quite a bit this is why you should
134.76s: care about risk and this is why you need
137.52s: to completely change the way you think
140.16s: about risk because it's not something
142.02s: that we just figure out while we're in
144.00s: the trade and hope it works out because
146.16s: let's take a look at how that goes this
149.76s: is from Wall Street bets and it's using
151.86s: that joke I'm never going to financially
154.08s: recover from this right and but this
156.66s: portfolio is down
158.54s: 91.6 percent well for this specific
160.92s: trade okay you might be saying that's
163.26s: Wall Street bets we expect that from the
165.54s: degenerates you're not wrong well let's
167.70s: take a look at day trading this is
169.56s: another scenario really bad trade long
171.48s: story short this person took a stop and
173.64s: then it ran up away from them and you
175.26s: could tell this was a whole emotional
176.88s: cycle because the last part I highlight
178.74s: here how do you guys deal with such
180.54s: things do you recommend I take a break
182.82s: for a few days again that's all fueled
184.86s: by emotion and you might be saying okay
186.60s: well that's day trading obviously day
189.24s: trading is a perilous sport still
191.64s: degenerates you're not wrong maybe we
193.80s: look at investing should I jump or not
195.90s: when I first saw this I thought it was a
197.34s: suicide thing but it's not actually what
199.38s: it says let me slide this down just a
201.54s: little bit so you could see easier what
203.10s: this actually says is I'm 64 and
206.16s: freaking out over having 60 of my funds
209.04s: in a money market right now in the
210.54s: market is rising I won't need 30 percent
212.70s: the point being completely emotionally
216.00s: fueled process here and this is pretty
218.28s: reasonable let's take it another step
220.20s: further here we have dividend investing
222.96s: what most Traders would consider to be
225.00s: the pretty mellow group the ones that
227.10s: are looking for a little bit of money
228.48s: and this guy's saying solid value and
231.18s: dividend play for Verizon this is what
233.70s: the chart looks like for Verizon
235.32s: where's the value this person is
238.50s: contorted because of the yield that they
241.68s: see in Verizon and they see dollar signs
244.86s: so what I'm hoping you're picking up in
246.78s: these different examples is it's not
248.52s: really as much as we like to joke about
249.84s: it it's not just the degenerates that
252.84s: have a problem here it's most people so
255.12s: let's talk about what this looks like
256.86s: the very first concept I want to cover
258.84s: here is why risk why do we care about
261.18s: this and it's exactly what Warren
262.74s: Buffett said if you don't have any
264.42s: principle to invest there's nothing to
266.40s: do you don't belong in this conversation
268.32s: so risk managing risk is what makes sure
272.10s: you have investable income so that you
274.92s: could do something so that you can
276.24s: invest you can invest zero dollars the
278.52s: way you stop from going to zero dollars
280.50s: is through managing risk but what I just
282.54s: showed you there are some of the
285.06s: psychological effects that people have
287.76s: when we talk about things like risk for
290.52s: Traders stuff like the disposition
292.32s: effect which is when we have a
294.90s: propensity City to look at winning
297.42s: potential and losing potential
299.52s: differently and what I mean by that is
301.92s: we have the tendency to sell winners way
306.18s: too fast and we hold losers way too long
309.36s: because we like feeling like we're
311.58s: winning it's Strokes our egos but we
314.46s: don't like feeling like we've lost or
316.56s: that we're wrong it hurts our egos so we
319.26s: don't want to have these losing
320.94s: positions and then you couple this with
323.16s: loss aversion and this essentially means
325.38s: that we are more sensitive to losing
327.66s: things than gaining by a factor of about
330.42s: two I encourage you to read both of
332.22s: these studies but the whole idea of loss
333.96s: aversion and this is a biological in
336.24s: context loss aversion exists because
339.20s: biologically if you have enough to
341.70s: survive if you lose something off of
344.52s: that that could mean you die whereas if
347.28s: you have enough to survive and you could
349.74s: gain a little bit maybe live slightly
351.84s: more comfortably but if you lose it you
354.18s: die you don't really care about about
355.68s: gaining whatever it is as much so both
358.08s: of these run rampant and this doesn't go
360.12s: into everything else like ego and stuff
362.28s: like that but it those are important
364.32s: notes nonetheless however I want to talk
367.08s: to you about how I think about risk and
370.20s: then how I actually deploy risk
372.18s: management efficiently so in this case
374.34s: we have a question that we have to solve
376.50s: for by ourselves our goals versus the
379.44s: risk we want to take if your goal is to
382.08s: make 100 on your account by the end of
384.90s: the year double your goal or double your
386.70s: account it's a pretty aggressive
388.86s: goal does that mean that you can't have
390.42s: that as a goal no you can have it but
392.34s: what does that mean in terms of the risk
394.02s: you are going to have to take in order
396.30s: to even stand a shot at that goal
398.52s: massive So based on the way you think
401.22s: about your goals your risk is going to
404.16s: have to correspond to it one way or the
405.96s: other so for me personally when I was
407.94s: aggressively growing my account I looked
410.16s: at 15 per year as my goal I broke that
413.52s: down to monthly Target targets to give
416.22s: me a little bit of context on how much
417.96s: risk I should be taking on a monthly
420.42s: basis in order to hit those targets so
422.70s: the idea is 15 per year for me it was
426.12s: doable and it didn't force me to take so
429.60s: much risk that I wouldn't be able to
431.40s: significantly scale this and my compound
433.68s: annual growth rate is maintained pretty
435.42s: far above that at least by five percent
437.28s: but nonetheless that was my goal and the
439.56s: reason why I picked that goal is to
441.06s: really control the rest of all these
443.40s: psychological functions that we have so
445.80s: now let's get into what my Approach
447.90s: actually looks like first we need to
450.30s: understand the idea of expected return
452.52s: and then we need to Overlay that with
454.86s: the idea of Tails tail risk because
457.38s: here's the deal every single time you
460.56s: are in a trade and you start messing
463.14s: with your win rates or your loss rates
466.26s: the average wins and losses are going to
468.72s: change same thing if you mess with the
470.82s: average loss size then I'll get into an
472.44s: example in a second and if you need kind
474.30s: of more detail on what this all looks
476.64s: like I have a video I'll link to it in
478.32s: the notes below but if we decide that we
481.38s: want to have lower average loss sizes we
485.10s: want to reduce the size of our average
486.66s: loss it means we're going to have more
489.30s: losses because you are managing that
491.88s: risk you obviously are going to pass
494.16s: that same threshold on your way to
496.08s: whatever your max loss is however my
499.08s: entire approach to managing risk is to
502.38s: maximize this relationship and what that
504.84s: means is the following we can take a
506.88s: look at a data set something like this
509.22s: whatever you want this is just data from
510.90s: Yahoo finance and I get an idea of how
514.02s: something moves what you're going to
516.06s: look at is going to vary drastically by
519.00s: your strategy but I'm giving you an
520.44s: example of how we could use data to make
522.12s: choices that make sense so we could say
524.34s: what are the number of occurrences where
526.56s: over the course of a weekend we move X
528.84s: percentage and what does that mean for
531.48s: whatever the strategy is that we're
533.04s: running what I'm trying to do is look
535.02s: look for the outliers I want to find the
538.38s: instances where we have either big moves
541.74s: or little moves and I want to use that
543.90s: to inform how I treat tops so stops can
548.16s: be problematic if you integrate stop
550.62s: losses in any sort of trading strategy
553.08s: you are going to increase your loss
556.32s: frequency your average loss may go down
559.14s: because our stop is decreasing how big
561.96s: our loss can get to but we're going to
563.64s: have more of them but we don't want to
565.20s: do that because if you modulate your
567.78s: loss rate and your loss size too much
570.90s: such that it starts to overwhelm your
574.02s: winning side of the equation now you are
576.84s: managing risk fine but you're running a
579.72s: negatively expecting strategy we don't
581.52s: want that so to find what works is
584.28s: pretty simple what you need to do is
586.02s: take a look at your strategy a great
588.00s: example is my earnings strategies I like
590.52s: to look at at least the past eight
592.74s: quarters if not 10 to 12 depending on
595.44s: the time frame of the product that I'm
597.30s: looking at and I want to see how it
598.56s: moves in general then if I'm trading a
601.74s: short straddle for this earnings plate
603.78s: to capture that variance risk premium
605.76s: which if you're not sure what that is
607.14s: there's a link in the notes below as I
609.60s: do that I know that I have break even
612.60s: points my short straddle gives me room
614.94s: to the upside and the downside but if it
616.68s: moves too much I lose money I don't want
619.20s: to have a stop where If It Moves enough
621.78s: to hit my stop but then it comes back in
624.18s: profitable well now that's just hurting
626.16s: the profit side of my equation I don't
628.86s: want that so what I need to do is I need
631.38s: to look at the strategy and say okay if
634.02s: it moves 10 up looking at a specific
637.26s: product what is the frequency that it
639.42s: moves 10 percent up but then would fall
641.70s: back into my profit Zone and if it's a
644.52s: really low percentage like two percent
646.08s: of the time ah I now just found the tail
650.34s: so if I set up a stop for that strategy
654.12s: in that specific product that cuts off
657.24s: the tail it will help improve my average
660.24s: loss meaning decrease it without
662.90s: impacting my loss rate too much it will
666.12s: still impact it slightly but not too
668.40s: much this is exactly the way we need to
670.68s: think about managing risk it's not just
673.38s: a haphazard approach we need to be
676.14s: thoughtful about what we're picking and
678.30s: how it impacts our expected return so
680.94s: what I like to do is this down here I
684.00s: like to use two different bands for most
687.36s: positions and then I break down risk
690.54s: into portfolio in individual positions
693.60s: so first let's take a quick look at this
695.22s: banned concept I have a position on an
697.74s: apple and you can see what this band
699.90s: concept actually looks like up here is
702.30s: my first band and then down here is my
704.94s: second band I'm bullish so what this
707.04s: means is and I actually have to move
708.24s: this first band up to 177.61 so this is
711.90s: a prime time example I'm going to remove
713.52s: this one and I'm gonna slide this alert
716.22s: up to 166 and this or 176 this is just
719.64s: to manage profits and this is well
722.16s: 166.50 sorry we're going to screwed it
724.08s: up even more because it's making good
725.70s: money making good money so I'll actually
728.04s: move it up to
729.50s: 177 and then this is exactly how it
733.02s: works so this first band is when I take
736.20s: a hard look at the position and I say is
738.78s: this still working the way that I want
740.94s: it to work in this case it's yes and
742.86s: let's say apple hit this first band I
745.02s: would make a choice I would say do I
747.48s: want to get out here yes or no and if
749.64s: it's no I need a really good reason to
752.04s: stay in then I have my second band which
754.62s: I also need to move up now to here and
757.62s: this second band is essentially if it
760.32s: hits this I'm done I'm out no matter
762.48s: what what this does is protects severity
765.66s: it makes sure that I am mentally
769.58s: overwriting this entire concept of the
772.98s: disposition effect and loss of version
775.20s: I'm not allowing these losing trades to
778.32s: expand because I don't like to look at
780.24s: them I'm not allowing winning trades to
782.70s: get cut too short because I know where
784.74s: my loss is going to be managed so in
786.90s: this case specifically with apple I
789.36s: don't have to take the trade down to say
791.28s: oh I want to lock in this profit I'm
793.26s: scared that it's going to lose I don't
794.94s: care I'll let the profits run because I
797.04s: have a loss plan for the downside to
800.28s: make sure that I don't allow this
802.14s: winning trade to turn into a losing
803.52s: trade this allows me to let winners run
805.20s: but make sure that I'm managing the
806.82s: losses at a point where it makes sense
808.98s: based on the individual strategy and the
810.90s: expectancy for that strategy so to kind
813.42s: of round this idea out I'm going to give
815.34s: you some of the things that I like to
816.60s: look at for both the portfolio and then
818.58s: individual trades so for the portfolio I
821.10s: like to look at these kinds of metrics
823.08s: I'm going to look at beta weighted
824.52s: Deltas this essentially takes all of the
826.44s: different Deltas of your portfolio and
827.88s: it puts them into a single language so
829.74s: to speak into a single ticker so that
831.60s: you know what your exposure is in terms
833.46s: of size across all your different
835.14s: positions and then you also know how
836.76s: it's going to behave I typically like to
838.32s: Beta weight either against the Spy or
840.24s: the SPX and it lets me know like if I
843.06s: have 1 000 positive beta weighted Deltas
846.24s: to the SPX then I know all of my
848.70s: positions are essentially behaving like
850.56s: long 1000 shares of SPX so by doing this
853.38s: it gives me a lot of fidelity over the
855.36s: risk profile and how I feel about it and
857.40s: then I'm also going to look at the gamma
859.08s: Theta Vega for the entire portfolio all
861.30s: of this kind of gives me an idea of
863.16s: sizing and correlation that's why I like
864.90s: beta weighted Delta so much but it's not
866.94s: just the correlation of the individual
870.36s: directional risk of each strategy but
872.58s: also Theta also Vega how fast is my
875.28s: portfolio set to move these will give me
877.38s: some of those details then for the
879.60s: portfolio we already talked about this
881.40s: kind of this goal that's the return
883.02s: Target for my entire portfolio so I keep
886.92s: that in mind on an annual on a monthly
888.60s: basis and I make sure that the risks
890.28s: that I have out at any given point in
892.02s: time serves that broader purpose then
894.06s: I'm always going gonna make sure that
895.56s: there if there are any events coming up
897.24s: I'm aware of it depending on how much
899.04s: risk I have out in the portfolio but
900.66s: things like fomc rate statements that's
902.76s: kind of a big deal right now so in those
904.62s: instances I want to make sure I know
906.18s: it's coming up for the week so that I
907.68s: can adjust the portfolio as needed and
909.36s: then p l bands I set p l bans for the
912.66s: portfolio now a really important note
915.06s: let's say if I want to make 100 in a
917.28s: month in my portfolio and I make that
919.20s: 100 that does not mean I stop that does
923.04s: not mean I stop it just means I get more
925.20s: selective there are no real time frames
928.26s: when it comes to the market the market
929.70s: doesn't really know if it's Tuesday or
931.56s: Wednesday the point being is if you're
933.30s: making money and things are working why
935.46s: would you stop just because you hit a
937.32s: number this month what happens next
939.12s: month when it's a slow month this is how
942.00s: in aggregate I'm able to come out ahead
944.40s: is I set these p l bands to guide me but
948.42s: they absolutely do not specifically The
950.70s: Profit bans it doesn't mean I stop and
952.68s: then the loss bans this is just in case
954.60s: is I'm asleep at the wheel and then I'm
956.94s: not doing a good job managing the risk
959.04s: in individual positions so that I don't
961.62s: allow my entire portfolio to start
963.66s: losing way too much because again if
966.12s: you'll recall the impact of these
969.06s: compounding returns is massive if we
971.64s: have a big drawdown it's a big impact we
974.16s: don't want to see that so that's kind of
976.08s: how I set up for the portfolio and you
977.88s: have to figure out what's right for you
979.02s: if your goal is to make a hundred
980.58s: percent over the course of a year you
982.44s: better believe that you better be ready
983.82s: for some big portfolio movements to get
986.10s: there but it doesn't necessarily mean
987.78s: that it makes sense and you'll have to
988.92s: figure out what suits your goals and
990.96s: what risks you're comfortable with now
992.28s: for individual positions I care about
994.50s: the expectancy of the individual
996.24s: strategies as I mentioned this helps
998.58s: inform how I'm going to allocate to the
1000.92s: position this stops me from
1002.90s: automatically adding to losing trades
1005.78s: which is really common for people so I'm
1008.00s: going to allocate things out via an
1009.68s: initial allocation and then I have
1011.24s: subsequent scaling targets so for
1013.28s: something like this I have a video that
1015.08s: talks about portfolio management I'll
1017.06s: also link to that in the notes below so
1018.56s: you can see more about it every single
1020.42s: position is going to have those p l
1021.92s: targets profit and loss for the loss
1024.32s: size or lost side I'm going to use those
1026.54s: bands I'm going to have two bands
1028.22s: sometimes it's based on support and
1029.78s: resistance sometimes it's based on the
1032.06s: value of an option it really comes down
1034.04s: to the individual strategies so you have
1035.72s: to see what makes sense for your
1036.68s: strategy and then again I'm always
1038.48s: always going to pay attention to events
1041.00s: what events are coming up for that
1042.74s: individual position because those can
1044.96s: have a really big impact on the overall
1047.24s: profitability so if you made it to the
1048.98s: end like subscribe be an outlier and
1050.96s: comment down below what you learned if
1053.36s: anything new I'll catch you guys later
