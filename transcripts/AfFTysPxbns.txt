 you you you you rightario L the position to try and quote unquote fix it. There's another common version of this that you will hear, which is referred to as trade repair, which also drives me absolutely crazy. So the session for today is to talk about these concepts first, like what they are, what they actually mean. And then the second element is to kind of tip my hat a little bit and give you a peek inside as to why I hate that framing. And then the third thing more importantly is to actually talk about some of the steps we can functionally take to adjust positions. And as you can tell, that's my preferred framing is adjusting. Now at a very high level, this is one of those things that only somebody that is a purist or is very interested in the details of something would really even care about this. And what I mean by that, the fact that it even bothers me, that it's referred to as defending versus repairing versus something else, that's kind of like a very nuanced position that most people won't really care about and rightfully so because it's objectively not that big of a deal. But like most things, as you gain experience, you start to have certain things that the details matter a lot. And then there's other things that the details don't really matter. And you can, lots of fair refer to things interchangeably that may not otherwise tend to be so a great example of that is something like scalping. We refer to that commonly even though that's 100% not functionally what it is, but it's close enough doesn't really matter. Now let's first talk about this topic. I'm going to move over to the main screen so that I can look a little more simply at what we're talking about and then we got to grab. Let me grab another scratch pad just for random activities. Okay, cool. So you guys should be on the main screen now, which is great. So let's start with the conversation. And when we get into it, there are going to be these two primary threads lenses. We're going to look at things through. We're going to look at things through the lens of spread style strategies, but then also single style strategies. So I intend to talk about both of those. So first, let's start with the terminology as it sits so that we are speaking the same language. I'm going to make the text a little bit smaller so that it's easier to see. There we go. Okay, so we have this idea of defending. Physicians. And then we know this is broken down into other terms synonyms. Right, so we had things like repair. We have things like salvage, adjust. All means the same thing. The core concept here is we have a position that conditions change enough that it requires our intervention. So position requires intervention. The reason why I prefer adjusting is because you can adjust positions that are both working in your favor and working against you. The entire baked in expectation, when we talk about terms like defending, repairing, salvaging, that immediately has a negative connotation. This immediately would make you believe that something is happening in this tray that we don't like and we are trying to make it better. That's the entire nature of defending. The idea of repairing, which is the prospect of putting something back to its original state literally doesn't apply in trading. You can literally throw the entire idea of repairing a trade because there is no going back to the original state. Shit is changed. And again, it might sound really trivial annoying thing pedantic to get hung up on the details here, but the reason why that matters because they all program the way your brain thinks about the scenario, the way you perceive information and then the way that you choose to move around the circumstance that you find yourself in. So if you go into this world of adjusting positions with the defensive mindset, that absolutely at the subconscious level is going to impact the way you process information. Same thing is let's say that I had a trade that I put on a short put and the underlying goes against me. And my goal when I set out as the trader is to repair that trade. Guess what I've just done? I've given myself a task that cannot be accomplished. So then what do you think again is going to happen as you go through that repairing phase? You're going to be really upset. You're going to be upset about something that you shouldn't even be upset about. You're going to be flustered about something you shouldn't be flustered about because the fact of the matter is as you've given yourself a task akin to go back in time. Literally can't do it. So that's why I care so much about the stupid, pedantic words we use around these. Even though they functionally mean very similar things, all of these impacts your subconscious processing of literally the entire rest of the process that you're about to undergo. So that is why in my view, I think it makes way more sense to simply refer to positions that require intervention as adjusting in a position, which is agnostic. That's not inherently good. It's not inherently bad. It simply means it's something that requires our attention. That's exactly what all of this other stuff means. It just adds a lot of bullshit to it that doesn't need to be there. Okay. I think hopefully I've made that point abundantly clear. The reason why this matters so much is because I learned a long time ago, this was back in middle school. I used to say to myself, I'm bad at math because I struggled. It was harder for me. I would say to myself, I'm bad at math. And guess what? I can I genuinely continue to struggle. And it's because I just accepted that as the reality. And this is just a deficiency that I have as a human being. And then at one point, it was like eighth grade. I just decided to stop saying it. I'd still believed it, but I literally just stopped allowing myself to verbalize it. That's it. And then all of a sudden math gradually started becoming much easier. That is a God honest true story from when I was a little kid. And at that point, it's when I realized like, okay, the way we think about things and the language we use absolutely impacts the rest of our relationship with whatever that thing is. And it's no different here. So little bit of context is to the, you know, back in Eric's archives is to why this kind of thing matters so much to me. And I think it should matter to you. Let's talk about this concept, however. So now we know that we don't want to refer to it as this stuff. We'll call it adjusting positions. So when we have to adjust a trade, what are the primary reasons that we might need to adjust to trade now? Before you start answering in the chat, I want you to apply organization in the way that we brainstorm this. So I want to start from guiding concepts big overarching things. And then we can get into further and further detail. So with that context, I would love to hear from you in the chat as to what are the circumstances that might lead us into deciding that we need to adjust one of our traits. We need to adjust the position starting from a very high level concept. And in the meantime, I'll answer Ben's question. Ben says, maybe you could explain why overall in options this concept exists. Why is it not just took a loss and now I'm taking another trade? That's a great question. And it's actually one of the artifacts that's very specific to options is that again, going back to the beginning, when we adjust a trade, it doesn't actually mean inherently that we're losing. If you remember, when we look at an options trade, it has multiple profit factors, multiple things that impact the premium of said option. So let's say, for example, I wanted to sell a put that is at a 30 delta. So I'm just picking a random expiration. And then I'll get rid of some of these because we don't need quite as many line items open. 75 should be good. And let's say I wanted to sell this 30 delta put that's 36 days out. When I sell this put, it's going to go on with a 33% probability of expiring in the money and a 66% chance of being touched. Kind of like Bill Cosby. Okay. So with that, if the options markets starts to move and we see that our 30 delta option is now at a 40 delta, things are going against us. All of these other subsequent probabilities change. All of the rest of our Greeks change. So it could be the scenario that we still like the trade, but now we've now gained too much gamma for what we want in the position and it requires an adjustment. Another example of this, that's in the concept of losing trade. Another example of this is actually something I've been doing with all of the levered coverage stringle strategies that I have on right now and ratio call diagonals because of the way that markets are behaving. If I sell a call, that's a 30 delta. And then the market moves, let's say 20 points away from where I originally sold that call. When I sell that call on 30 60, right now I'm gaining 16 cents of theta per day. If there's, let's say again, a 20 point move, so that would make our 579 option look like the 599. So we'll just use the 598s because they're close and I don't want to add more. We can see that my theta has now changed. My theta originally was 16 cents. Now my theta is 7 cents. The trade has moved in my favor in this scenario, but my daily profit from theta has been cut in half. So this could be another scenario where it's like, well, I still want to collect a higher theta because that's what fits the overall portfolio. This is now moved too far away. I need to readjust this position to then continue producing what I needed to produce in the context of the broader portfolio. So to summarize all of that for Ben, the reason why this exists in options trading and it can exist in other kinds of trading, by the way, but the reason why this exists in options trading is because we're dealing with securities that have a lot of other factors that impact their movement and their behavior. And very frequently when we put on a position in the beginning, we have a certain idea of the exposure we want or we should. If you don't, that just means you're a lay trader that's kind of just seeing how things go, which is not going to work well. For most of the more sophisticated traders, the Greeks matter a lot, the way that our position is going to behave matters tremendously. So that's exactly why this world of adjusting is so prevalent in options trading is because things move a lot and we want to have different methods to maintain the exposure we want. So now going back to the brainstorming in terms of the scenarios and the context, as to why we might use the adjusted trade. Let's see what you guys have come up with. Tommy says underlying price hits soft stops. I'm going to zoom that up. Tommy and I'm essentially going to say P and L targets. And this again can mean different things. It could mean we just take the whole trade down. It could mean that we adjust the position. So this is completely fair to include here. Next, travel says what we expect to happen with the trade does not happen or the opposite happens. Okay. So I would argue that is partially captured in the P and L targets, but you're onto a very important point because when we talk about options, there's a underlying factor that's very unique to them in the fact that they expire. So we can have P and L targets that are hit, but we can also have a trade. I have no idea what that is. I need to just like reload this. I have no idea why what they're okay. Great. Awesome. We figured it out. So the other thing here from P and L targets is there's absolutely a scenario where our P and L targets might not be hit, but duration. Or good old tit. I'm in trade. It requires us to do something. There's another third bucket here, which is the Greek profile. Changes. So you'll notice compared to again, the more basic understanding of something like adjustments, which is going to rest primarily on the stock is moving against us. There's actually quite a few additional circumstances that might be relevant to us to adjust a position. And this is kind of like a high level overview of most of it. There is another one that absolutely goes in here, which would be the portfolio fit, which can change. So one of the realities is I could have other positions that I'm doing things with, taking them down, adding more, that then somehow indirectly impacts what's in this position. So that's absolutely another factor that again is important to keep in mind. Now, as always, the reason why I structure it this way in that there are these broad buckets is to help organize your thoughts. If we approach this exercise from the world of just spitballing all of the conceivable situations that we might adjust a position in, this would be chaotic. And it would be very difficult then to even logically process through what makes sense. And as you all know, bringing order to chaos where possible is very important when you're dealing with really complex systems. So that's exactly why I set it up this way for you. So let's start with the subtext around these main things. P&L targets being hit is pretty easy. This means that the trade hit our thresholds. So then we have to do something. Duration time in trade. This simply means trade, didn't. Hit thresholds. In time frame. Greek profile changes. This means the original profile changed enough. That it impacts our idea. More portfolio. So what this means. What this means is actually pretty simple. Oh, I can't slide it over. I realize that it was on the edge. That's okay. What this means is pretty simple. Over the life cycle of a trade, other things can move around with respect to volatility, with respect to time, with respect to correlations that then change what the Greeks of our portfolio or positions look like that then require us to look at each individual trade and to figure out what makes the most sense for that new condition. And again, the reason why this is important is because if you have one single trade, T1, not really that big a deal, right? You're going to have your Greeks. They're going to be whatever they are. What starts to become more complex is then if you have T2, T3, all the way out to T30. Because if all of these individual trades are kind of out there doing their thing, living their best lives, and then all of a sudden just for whatever reason, things start changing in the broad market, the systematic risk profile changes. Or whatever if you're using only one individual kind of strategy, which is a mistake. If that starts to all coalesce together, then all of a sudden your entire portfolio can take a completely different risk profile than you had originally intended. That's a problem. So monitoring the Greek profile, not just obviously for the individual trade, but for the portfolio. That is a lot. And obviously that bleeds beautifully into the last one, which is there can be instances where other positions require adjustments to trade. So a good example of this. Let's say I have a bunch of 30 delta short puts on. I found something new that looks really, really good that I really want to sell premium in. And then I looked through the rest of my portfolio and I realized like, man, I have a lot of VOMMA right now, big vague risk. Let me go through my existing positions and see if there's anything I can either take down or adjust. Maybe I move the strike out a little bit further, something like that to reestablish if it's in profit, whatever the case is. So that then I can add this new opportunity without the rest of my portfolio skewing too much because that becomes dangerous. So if we're talking about this world of adjusting a trade, these are kind of the broad buckets that lead us to then need to adjust a trade. So now what I want to do for the next 10 minutes or so before we wrap up is I would love to look at a couple examples with you, but I would love to source the examples from you. So if there are specific strategies that you like to trade, that you're trying to think about scenarios that you might want to adjust, then that's perfect. I'd love to grab maybe one or two of them for us to take a look at. I know one of the scenarios from the discord. I think Paulo, and I think he might be the one that originally asked the question, I'm not positive, but Paulo is saying folding diagonals into calendar, straddles, into narrower, or strangles into narrower strangles of straddles, iron condors to butterflies. All those are completely viable. I just want to know if there's any specific one that we should focus on because the reality is when we're adjusting positions, you're not going to be shocked at all to hear me say this, but we should be executing something that's defined ahead of time. So my goal here is to try and help give you some equipment to think about how to proceed through deciding how to adjust a specific position so that then you can apply the framework to other kinds of things. Ben says, I know you don't like credit spreads, but can you adjust credit spreads? Yeah, we can definitely talk about that. Thomas says double diagonals on soy. I mean, if we want to talk about double diagonals, we can, I think it's less relevant to most people, and then it doesn't, it's completely agnostic to the whatever we're trading. Like soy wheat, like, doesn't matter. But I think credit spreads is probably way more applicable anyways. So let's take a look at what might be able to be done for a credit spread. And I think we can close this down. I want to actually look at we'll go into on demand and we'll literally look at a trade together. So Ben or anybody else, we'll talk about a vertical spread. I assume that's what you mean by a credit spread. For those that don't know, credit spread literally just means that you get a credit for putting on the spread. You can have a lot of different kinds of structures that yield a credit as a spread. So the connotation I'm assuming from Ben though is probably thinking vertical spread. That's what I'm assuming, but I want to confirm first. Ben is that correct or did you have a different strategy in mind? Yes. Okay. Got it. So that's great. So Ben, let's take a look then and we're going to talk about verticals for the sake of a vertical and we can go through this pretty quick so that we can probably hit one more. So when we're looking at a vertical spread, Ben, do you want to do something that's bullish or bearish? For context, what I'm going to do is find a timeframe in the chart that does the opposite of what we want. I'm going to put on different versions of the same trade so that we literally can go back in time and then see how they behave and how they perform. So that's really the next thing is I just need to know if we're talking about putter call side, put credit spread, call credit spread, either of those bullish overalls would be a put credit spread. Great. So that's perfect. So let's go to the 28th of Feb, completely good timing here and then we'll literally put on a couple different versions and then we'll see what kind of things we might be able to do with them. Let's go to 28th Feb and then this is going to start to load. And we'll literally we'll play the scenario out, we'll eyeball it and then hopefully it'll give you a little bit of context. Let's get over to the options chain. And we'll just apply kind of standard protocols. We'll go out either 21 or 48 days. I'm not going to use the weeklies. Okay, and then again, we'll just use like standard protocols. So we'll do like a short on the 30 delta. So then we'll do a $1 wide. Let me get rid of the other ones. So that's a $1 wide, then we will do a $2 wide. And then we will do a $5 wide. And then we will do a $10 wide. And then one more, we'll do a $20 wide. So what I'm doing right now is I'm giving us multiple versions to look at. Now this is a again, like a broader thing to be aware of when you're testing ideas, what I'm doing here is very purposeful because by inherently testing multiple ideas in one shot, it makes it much more efficient for me because then I can eyeball the difference between all of these relatively quickly. And then just get a sense of, okay, well, what what happens here? What matters here? That's the whole point. So the first things that I would do if I were like testing this more seriously is I would build a little bit of a tracker, which you've all seen different versions of this before. So I would start with a date. So the date that we're at in the scenarios 28 Feb. And then I'm not going to waste the time to fill it in because it would take a while. But what I would do is essentially break it out by the different trades that I would have on. So I would have a strike stock price. I would have a strike price. I would have all the Greeks Delta Gamma, or Gammy, data, Vega. And the whole point of this is so that I could monitor how they change as things move. It gives me ideas. So that's exactly what I would build. But that aside, let's now take a look at these different trades. We know with these different vertical spreads, our ultimate preference would be for the stock to go up. So we know that if the stock goes down, that's not that's doing what we don't want. So then the next question we would ask ourselves, and this is looking at it through the vacuum of just the position. So I purposely used short the 570 in all of them so that we only have one short strike to look at in all of these scenarios. Again, it's much more efficient. So then for the chat, for the group here, let's brainstorm how might we choose to attempt to manage this short but vertical spread? What might we do when? So we know that there's absolutely a time component to it. That's for sure. And in this case, the passage of time actually helps us. So as time goes, if it's not hitting our PNL target, well, doesn't effectively matter that much unless we choose to set some sort of early time-based management for whatever reason, which absolutely can be the case. If again, our system requires that. So that's something that we could consider. What else could we consider? The most obvious one is if the short strike gets breached, because here's the reality. Even though that this is a spread, and our risk is going to be defined at the onset of the trade, well, there absolutely will be a problem come expiration. Because if the short strike is breached and the long isn't, then we have a problem. Now, you're still generally going to be okay depending on your broker and how your broker would manage that trade for you. But the reality is it absolutely can occur where your short strike is breached, you're assigned on the short, and then you still have the long or the long expires. That kind of sucks. So we don't really want that scenario. So we'll hone in on that specific circumstance. But again, to give you a playbook to work off of, those are some of the other circumstances that might matter to us even for something like a vertical spread, where there could be a time-based element, where after a certain amount of time in the trade based on our system that we've developed, even if it doesn't hit our PNL targets, it could be another spot that we choose to manage the trade. But this one we will use when it breaches our short strike of 570. And again, we picked a quote unquote favorable time for this example, because we know it happens. I don't know exactly what day it happens. We'll figure it out in a sec. And then let's keep going to the six. And then I might have picked a bad example, because these might be far enough out of the money. There it is, finally. So it happens on the seventh. So now our short strike has been breached. And it started a little bit lower than what it was now. So let's actually move us back in time closer to the open so that we can be closer to the actual let's see what time I don't know what time it settled around that low figured out. Let's try 830. There we go. This works. So 0830, Pacific time we notice that our short strike has been breached at this point. The entire spread is in the money. So now let's take a look at all these different spreads. First, we'll start with the dollar wide, the 570 and the 569. This is the trade we're going to look at. We were looking to make 23 bucks risking 77. Now let's figure out what this trade would look like at this point when it finishes buffering. And again, this is the 570, 569. Let's see. One of the things that you will notice with something like vertical spreads is your ability to do much is actually limited depending on the width. So here the 575, 569 right now the mid price is 42 cents and the natural is 34 cents. So our trade here in this context because we sold it for 23 cents, our trade here would effectively be trying to buy it to close at 42 cents. So the first thing most traders will try to do is just close the whole spread down if they want and then you can absolutely look at potentially trying to roll the spread. The issue with trying to roll a vertical spread, especially if you try to roll it as a vertical spread is you'll notice that there is a big liquidity constraint for two reasons. One, we only have 41 DTE 49 54 70. So the next primary expiration is out here 70 days to expiration. The next thing is we now know we need to get something that if we got a fill at 42 cents, which notice this is an 8 cent wide bit ass spread. So if volatility is going up and if your trade is struggling, let's say that it might be more probable for you to get a fill something like 45 cents if things work out appropriately. So let's see where I would have to go in order to get a 45 cent wide, but oh shit, what's the next thing I notice? What happened to the dollar wide strikes? I see some of them here at the 580, but below 580, I don't see dollar wide strikes. So what happened? It's liquidity. The market has an opened up dollar wide strikes on these because they're 70 days out. So now that's another hurdle we are going to have to figure out. So let's say then our short leg is at the 570 and we say, well, we don't want to go any worse than 570. So let's see if we can sell the 570 and get the 565. Well, of course you can, but what's now happened is you've increased your risk by $4. We've gone from $1 wide to $5 wide. This might not represent the position you want at all. So to summarize the very small with vertical spreads is you're going to come into various versions of liquidity constraints. That doesn't mean you can't roll, but one of the things, one of the only ways to even stand a chance at trying to roll a vertical spread, especially during volatile periods is by adjusting the individual legs. And that opens up different risks depending on the order that you adjust the legs. So to summarize all of that with something like a vertical spread, the overwhelming stance of sophisticated traders, including myself, that would trade a vertical spread, especially narrower, like five points and in is you just, it's just a directional hypothesis. And it's either going to be right or wrong. That doesn't mean that you can't take it down early for a loss. If something moves against you big and you think it's going to stay down there, it doesn't mean that you have to sit there and wait, but it does mean I'm not going to try to roll it. That is the exact kind of scenario where I would just close that trade. And then if my idea is still appropriate, sure, I can go open a new one, but to try to pair those as a rolling order, really, really, really challenging, very challenging. The probability of getting filled at anything even remotely favorable is about zero. In fact, it's not going to happen. So that's one scenario. Now what I was just alluding to opens us up to discuss the second scenario, which is one of these wider verticals. So let's take a look at this 20 point wide vertical. In this 20 point wide vertical that we first put on, our true intention is probably not using the 50 as a risk management. The probability of somebody trading this kind of vertical, the 57550, this is way more likely to be somebody that's just using the wing for margin management, right? Because if you have a smaller account and you want to just sell the 570, that's really expensive. But if you can see that in this case where we're 20 points wide, it's only asking for 2 grand. And it's limited to that 2 grand, which is kind of nice, you know, again, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. So my broader point here is that the person who's trading this is much likely to be somebody that's trading this as a vertical in the traditional sense and more so probably adding the wing and treating that short put as a naked short put. Okay, fine. So what changes in this context, not much, but the difference is that this again, the context of trying to leg around this, I think going to happen, meaning to trade this as a vertical spread and then hit create a rolling order where it's going to try to close this one and open a new one in the same order stream. It's not going to happen. So what you can do in this kind of scenario is absolutely manage the trade by rolling it again in line with whatever your approach is, but you would have to do it in individual legs. So then it opens the question, what is the order of legs that makes the most sense? It's always going to be managing the short option first. Because what's very dangerous is if I choose to close my long option first and then or whatever reason at that moment before I have a chance to get the new long on something happens for whatever reason, you now have an undefined risk trade on and your broker again, if you don't have the money for it, they might not even allow it. They might say that you can't close this individual leg because you would exceed the margin required for the position. So the way to manage something like this is is pretty easy. Normally what we would do is close out the 570. So close out that put. You can leave this long put on if you're so inclined until you finish the roll. Don't have to. You can close the 570 and then you can close the 550 or you can just close this as an entire vertical and then open up a new one. Now if you're trying to get an optimal fill and if you're trying to play spreads, what you can do is close the 570, go roll out in meaning figure out we're going to go with that 570, make that adjustment while keeping that 550 on because your risk is still managed in this context and then you can add the other leg once you complete that then close this residual long leg. It kind of adds complexity for no reason for most people. The easiest way to adjust something like this is to leg out of it and then put a new one on. So when we're trading verticals more often than not, the concept here is essentially just leave it alone. Now Elizabeth opens up another really great question which is roll the untested side. Rolling the untested side occurs differently from verticals and that will happen in this context. Let me get rid of these. And then let's go back like we did to 28 beb for the same scenario and then I got to open the door for a throat real quick. Okay. So it looks like it's still hitting me with a buffer. All right. So now let's take a look at what this roll the untested side means. Let's say that we were selling strangles. I do this all the time. We have 19 delta there and because of all the skew, we have to go super far out of the money on the call side to get to these. And then 19 delta here. So here's the trade that we have on. And from a margin requirement, this asks for 15k effectively. So now let's fast forward time again because we know this goes against us, which is convenient. And we have the 545 and the 623. I don't know if it gets bad in either of these technically, but that's okay. Because we'll take a look at the change in the delta. It's buffering right now. So here's what's happened. In this scenario, we started where both legs were a 19 delta. If we take a look now, our short puts have moved up to a 30 delta. They're not quite challenged yet technically, typically speaking when we're referring to challenge, it would be when they're like at the money. But this still is that side being tested. And the rolling of the untested side is actually what I was talking to you before in the context of the covered strangle. Remember how I told you for the covered strangle. I'm in the process of rolling in the money short puts out and down trying to adjust those. And I'm rolling the calls closer at the money. That's rolling the untested side. So in this context, tested refers to whichever leg is being challenged by the market of a short option. So in this case, it would be the put side. And then the untested side in this case is the call side. And effectively, what we're saying, if this is a short strangle, well, here's what's happening. That's really dangerous. These are gaining way more deltas. And the puts and the call side is losing deltas. So normally, if we're trading something like a short strangle and we want to keep it more balanced and to try to actually isolate volatility, what that means is as this starts to move and this is now a 30 delta, what does that mean for our position? Well, it means that if the underlying moves down, we lose 30 cents here. How much would we gain from the corresponding call side? We gain nine. Not a great trade off. Pretty shitty. It feeds the purpose. Now, the benefit here is that if it moves in our favor, meaning the price goes up, we gain 30 cents and we only lose nine. But what's the difference here? We've effectively taken a strategy that was designed to be neutral. And it has a very clear directional tilt at this point. This trade wants the market to go up. It needs the market to go up if it continued to move either direction. So the idea of rolling the untested side is to rebalance the position. So I originally put this trade on 19 deltas on the short side on the calls and puts 19 short deltas 19 long deltas. They balance each other out. So that means that if it moves in either direction, I don't have big directional risk. Now I do. So to fix that, I can say, I'm going to take in these six 23s. I would take them in at a profit because they will be making money. The calls will be cheaper than what I sold them for. And I might take them all the way into a 30 delta here. And I can take them to the 596s. So now what I've effectively done is rebalance the deltas. This is rolling the untested side. Now you can roll the untested side for a bunch of different reasons. It really depends on the purpose of the position. In this context, I'm showing you rolling the untested side to rebalance your deltas for the context of a covered strangle. I'm not really trying to rebalance my deltas. I don't care. It's just the fact that the underlying is moving down and I can make more money with the short calls by continuing to move them down with the underlying. So in the context of a covered strangle, it's not really to rebalance the deltas as to follow the move. But the concept is we're adjusting the side of the trade that effectively is in profit. And it's to regain sensitivity to the rest of the Greeks. Elizabeth, does that make sense? Do you have any follow-up questions for that? And then I will pivot to Pallos in a sec. But I want to make sure Elizabeth years is good. The cook cannot pineapple bubbly. It's pretty solid. Elizabeth says, make sense? Need to write that down. Yeah. If I were to write it down, I would essentially phrase it as when I have a position. I mean, you can even roll an untested option. It would be not referred to as the untested side. When we say the tested versus untested side, that infers that there's a spread of some sort. But you really can adjust the untested option at any point. So you can have just a short call. And then the market can move in your favor, meaning it's untested and you can choose to rebalance it. So the way I would think about it is essentially adjusting an option where it's moved in my favor. And I want to regain a certain Greek profile. Cool. So Pallos says, I'm most puzzled by diagonals to calendars. When is this tactic worthwhile? Pallos, do you have an example of a trade that you would like to look at together? And then happy to explore it with you. If you don't, we can talk about it in a theoretical concept. But if you have a specific trade or a specific version of the strategy, that would be ideal for me. Because as you know, I do my best to make the stuff that we review during the streams more relevant to you, the individual. That's kind of the fun part, I think at least. And then if not, like I said, happy to just build one. Okay, so Pallos says Oracle, let's do that. And when Pallo, when did you put the trade on just so I can go to that day? If you put it on recently, that's fine. With on demand, we essentially are blacked out for the last nine trading days. So if it's in the last nine trading days, then I'll just pick another time, go as close as I can to it. And then I see just before earnings. Okay, when did they have earnings? Well, they like just had earnings. Yeah, okay. So just before what had been on the 10th, I think the furthest we can go back. I mean, that's pretty good. It's super close. But I think this is fine, actually. We just won't be able to fast forward, which is okay. I'll punch this down. And you're talking about when it went to 140 them back to 150. So it had a 10 point move. 65, 53. Okay. Okay, let's just even eyeball the trade as it sits. So you had the March 28th. And then the March 14th. So two got it. So the March 28th, you had the 150s. Is on the put side. And then did you put it on for a creditor, a debit, I'm assuming you bought it. Around five March. I know that this one isn't your trade, but I'll fix it to be what we want. I just want to know what leg you did what with if you bought our sold. Now for those that don't know when you're looking at things like diagonals, well, there's a couple different ways to look at them. Calendar spread is effectively when you're same strike, different explorations. Diagnals is when you combine a vertical move and a horizontal move, get it diagonal move. So it's when you're in different explorations, but then you're also at different strikes. So I'm waiting to see what Apollo put the diagonal on for. If you sold the back or bought the back, which will effectively say whether this goes on for a credit or a debit debit. Yeah, okay. So you paid, which is super common. So what that means is he's long the 150s and 28 March. And then in 14 March here, he is short. It looks like the 140s. So let me see if I have this. No, I flipped them. My bad. My bad. This is 28. So it's this one. 28 at the 150. And then this one is the 14th at 140. So then this effectively will go on for a debit. The reason why this is the case is we're buying a more expensive further out in time option. And then we are selling a cheaper, near dated option. So this is what the diagonal will look like in this context. So now what what Apollo is talking about is turning it into a calendar. And there are two ways we can turn it into a calendar. We can either roll the further dated option or we can roll the near dated option. And the defense, quote, unquote, really depends on the way that it moves and what we're trying to accomplish. And we can just kind of, you know, think through logically what might happen in the scenario. So if we go back to analyze and let's say the stock does move. And let's say the stock right now is at 148 in this scenario. And what did Oracle do? You said it went down in them back up. So let's say Oracle goes down. You said it went down to like 140, which would be like near max profit, something like that. And then it went up to 150. So if we're in this scenario where the option that's further out in time is doing most of the work and the option that's nearer in time is doing less of the work, right? Like think about what adjustment might make sense. In this case, we sold the 140 put. It's now trading down towards 140. Would we in any scenario want us to roll that put up to the 150? Probably not. Could do it, but doesn't make a lot of sense. So then we could choose to roll the long option that's further out in time down. Now would that make sense in this context again, probably not. The main reason being is because unless you have a longer term game plan for the strategy. If it's sitting at your max profit, which effectively this is, then that's actually getting closer to what I would consider to be your P&L management approach. So in this context, I don't really think it makes a lot of sense to roll either of them. Now in the world where why we might choose to do that, let's take a look at the Greeks. So we can see that right now the 150s that are 18 days to expiration, they have effectively a 50 delta to gamma 24 theta that we're losing and 14 vega. So then if we wanted to convert this into a calendar, we would then need to share the same strike, which may or may not make sense. One of the more common instances I would see this convert into a calendar is actually if we're moving this short put to roll it out in time and then we might hit the same strike, but still not super frequently. And it's because I wouldn't want to roll the short put all the way up into something that's at the money if it's trading at 150, I would want to roll it down. So then what's the context on what happens to the long option that's out in 28 March? Well, if we take this 150 and we roll it down, what does that do? Well, it decreases our short delta, it decreases our gamma, decreases our theta, and decreases our vega. It essentially desensitizes literally all of the Greeks. So why might we do that if we want something to move slower or whatever reason? So the process of converting, and I wouldn't even view it personally, I think it's too constraining to view it as like converting a diagonal into a calendar. It's kind of myopic. I would just view it as adjusting the further dated leg and the shorter dated leg to whatever strikes makes sense for your idea. So whenever we're talking about the adjusting of options, it's important not to get wrapped up in what the structure might be called, it doesn't really matter. What matters is does the position reflect the position we want to have? And that can be the position for the specific trade that we have on, or it can be the position that fits with the portfolio better. So, Paulo, in your case in this scenario, I don't really see a scenario where I personally would want to turn this into a calendar. Now, the scenario that might be more appropriate for a calendar is if you put it on for a credit and you're adjusting the further out in time option, that can make sense. And what that means is if we flip this like we were talking about before, and let's say that we close this, I'm just going to have it by the diagonal. And in this case, I don't want to, yeah, this is fine. So in this case, what's happening is we're going to be long the 4 April 145 and then short the 28 March 25. So you can have this configured a few different ways, but we can have this where we're actually short the further dated option and then long the near dated option. So in this kind of trade, it changes things a bit. And the reason why it changes things for a bit is because let's say Oracle does indeed start rallying down. And let's say our short option that's out in 145, something like that. Let's say that that first starts getting challenged, but then all of a sudden, it starts rallying the other direction. We might want to pace the short put and move it up to the 150 to follow that price movement to capture as much as we can. Kind of a different method to adjust it, but again, very similar to verticals, very infrequently does in my opinion, it make a bunch of sense to adjust diagonals in this way. It's primarily the way I would think about it specifically managing a diagonal into a calendar. It's like very specific. I would think of it way more as just adjusting the individual legs to get the exposure that I want. My ratio call diagonals, for example, I manage the long legs differently than the short legs. And I manage the short legs pretty actively, but I'm not like trying to turn it into a calendar or anything specific. I'm just trying to make the trade look however I want. So key takeaway there and broader recommendation when we think about this stuff is like don't constrain the positional adjustments to names. And again, I know that that's not the real question that's being asked, you know, diagonal to calendar, but again, like that's the subtext that comes through. There's nothing wrong with adjusting either leg, one strike, and keeping it as a diagonal if that better reflects your idea. So there are scenarios however we're adjusting the individual legs can make sense. Most of those instances are going to be following profit movements and it's typically going to be done more so on the short leg, just in the long leg absolutely can be done. But the short leg, if something's moving in your favor, typically the long leg is going to continue to gain more deltas, which is what you want. And the short leg is going to potentially gain or lose deltas again depending on which way it goes. But if it goes in your favor, considering the short leg, you start losing deltas and a lot of times you'll want those back for the broader position. So to recap what we talked about in the context of defending positions, I like to view it way more as simply adjusting positions. And the way that I mentally think about it is always just getting the position to reflect the risk that I want to have on. That's the ultimate objective. That's the entire purpose of any of these adjustment style strategies, where the original risk profile of our trade looked one way, then as the market moved, it then looked differently. And we want it to look more reflective of again, whatever the idea is that we have. So any questions on any of that, anything else that you guys want to hit? I have a couple minutes. So if we want to talk about the markets really fast, let me know. I can take a look at any individual tickers quickly. I know that we're at an hour, but my dinner's not going to be here for a little bit. And I already pretty much did the work I need to do for the broader videos. I already have most of the videos queued up, which is awesome, meaning for when I'm traveling next month to Ireland. So that this way you guys will still get material while I'm out prowlicking with the leprechauns. I will report back if I find a leprechaun. I'm eager to see if I can get my eyeballs on one. Feel like there's got to be at least one in like a costume. I hope at least. South Korea to prepare measures on US steel tariffs and march interesting. Bay areas. Can you take a look at Palantir? What are your expectations for the potential news based event? Marley, yeah, take a look. I have a position on Palantir. So first things first, Palantir has had pretty mellow moves. The average move using a rolling 20-day window is like three quarters of a standard deviation, which is actually a little bit lighter than what it should be, which is interesting. Now, today Palantir rallied a bit up 7%. And this was for a couple reasons. I don't know if you guys saw, but there was new news that came out that I think it was last night actually. The news came out that there was another contract that Palantir was being targeted for. Let's see if that news came out yesterday. No. I don't see that news here. I'm curious when the news came out. One sec. I'm just wondering what actual time that news came out. So, I remember seeing it. Let's see if this cut would have been in the evening. Here we go. No. Here we go. ApeCon and Defense Deals be the combat catalyst. No. It's not the main one. There was literally just... Maybe I don't remember. There was a specific article. I literally remember reading it on my phone about a new contract that somebody was going to open with Palantir. I don't remember. But anyways, that part aside, I think Palantir itself is still pretty well positioned. Let's take a look at what the options tell us. No, that's not right. 2.1 mil against 1.4 on the call side. If we take a look at the vol for tomorrow or for 21 March, it's 95% for this front expiration. It's 113. So definitely pricing in pretty heavy vol for the rest of this week. Let's take a look at what this week is showing us for options. It's effectively two times almost. Paul's to puts. So that generally would lead us to believe that the market is positioning and positioning itself for an upside move. That's the broad, the broad note. Let's see if there's anything else we can uncover quickly. The LTR. What I'm doing now is I want to get a sense of, yeah, so like this is people positioning today. So what I'm doing is I'm looking at the net call premium in how that reflects sentiment. This is obviously a lot of people unwinding. But the interesting thing here is if you take a look at the overall activity today, it's definitely bullish leaning and this is going to be positioning primarily for tomorrow. Now let's take a look at the near term. I'll answer. Let's take a look at plus seven days. And then what I want to do is actually look at this specific expiration for this Friday. Yeah, look at this. Two million at the 75s. 1.2 at the 75s. These are interesting. These being so tight in. What is this part of? Yeah, this looks like a hybrid of stuff tied to the 86s because it would be a strange spread for the 86s to be tied to the 75s. Let's see. This is like impossible to tell. So this one's really, really hard to tell. This could be short the 75s and then long these, but it looks the inverse where the 75s came in at 1003 much closer, not much, but a little bit closer to the offer. So it looks like they might be thinking that this could be a cost spread, 2000 contracts each. So it does look somewhat generally bullish positioning. Take a look at the volume for today. And then let's take a look at the volume for the 14 March 189. Let's see. How do people take in general shots as you would expect? Super active. Really, really active. Yeah, this looks like a general makes back, but in general, what I can loosely identify is slightly more favorable bullish side positioning for the expectation on tomorrow. Call side looks like a higher probability of a downside move, but more upside severity. But what's interesting is I'm looking at it is for the near strikes, it's actually lower on the call side. So what do we have? 85. Let's go 10 points wide. 103. Yes, so it's actually favoring that's fascinating. So it's favoring a higher probability of a smaller up move with a slightly higher severity of a downside move, but then it becomes overwhelmed to the upside. So what this means is it's a higher probability of a small upside move with the moderate probability of a slightly larger downside move with a low probability of a really big upside move. That's what all of that means. I hope that makes sense. Interesting. Scott says GME and earnings call later this month. Yeah, boy. I owe you guys a video on GameStop. So I'll do a literally wrap this up and then I'll take a look at that. Base says new contracts with Heineken and Walgreens potentially more for to be announced tomorrow allegedly. I saw I got to figure out what the fucking news I saw yesterday, but I saw something about maybe no, it wasn't lunar. I figured out, but there was also there was literally news. I saw come out last night that talked about a couple couple new things. Ben says you mentioned these smaller medium companies with weird option activity. Would you say it's a valid path to chase it? Would you say no? I mean, it's definitely valid. Is that the best return on time for a newer trader? I would argue absolutely not because it's one of the more nuanced places to try to do anything. I think the better time spent for a newer option trader is to get good market fundamentals down, which is essentially finding ways to optimize beta return. I think it's a great starting point. And then once you get through optimizing beta and you have like a good core approach that generally is sustainable and makes money, then it's okay to venture off into the weeds and take a look at all these other random approaches, but I think it just becomes more difficult to rationalize. But I'm going to hop off so I can make this game stop video because I owe it to everybody and there's a couple adjustments. If you guys need anything, let me know Friday is our second to last options trading basic stream. So don't miss that. We're going to be talking about managing a portfolio. Be an outlier. See you later.
