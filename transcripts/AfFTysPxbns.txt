0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: with
150.00s: the position to try and quote unquote fix it.
154.40s: There's another common version of this that you will hear,
158.16s: which is referred to as trade repair,
163.84s: which also drives me absolutely crazy.
168.96s: So the session for today is to talk about these concepts first,
174.16s: like what they are, what they actually mean.
176.48s: And then the second element is to kind of tip my hat a little bit
183.92s: and give you a peek inside as to why I hate that framing.
189.60s: And then the third thing more importantly is to actually talk about some of the steps we can
195.04s: functionally take to adjust positions. And as you can tell,
201.20s: that's my preferred framing is adjusting.
204.16s: Now at a very high level, this is one of those things that only somebody that is a purist
213.76s: or is very interested in the details of something would really even care about this.
221.04s: And what I mean by that, the fact that it even bothers me, that it's referred to as defending
227.36s: versus repairing versus something else, that's kind of like a very nuanced position that most
233.76s: people won't really care about and rightfully so because it's objectively not that big of a deal.
240.08s: But like most things, as you gain experience, you start to have certain things that the details
249.68s: matter a lot. And then there's other things that the details don't really matter. And you can,
255.20s: lots of fair refer to things interchangeably that may not otherwise tend to be so a great example
261.20s: of that is something like scalping. We refer to that commonly even though that's 100% not
268.64s: functionally what it is, but it's close enough doesn't really matter. Now let's first talk about
274.32s: this topic. I'm going to move over to the main screen so that I can look a little more simply
280.72s: at what we're talking about and then we got to grab. Let me grab another scratch pad just for random
288.32s: activities. Okay, cool. So you guys should be on the main screen now, which is great.
303.20s: So let's start with the conversation. And when we get into it, there are going to be these two
312.00s: primary threads lenses. We're going to look at things through. We're going to look at things through
317.92s: the lens of spread style strategies, but then also single style strategies. So I intend to talk
326.32s: about both of those. So first, let's start with the terminology as it sits so that we are speaking
336.48s: the same language. I'm going to make the text a little bit smaller so that it's easier to see.
344.08s: There we go.
349.04s: Okay, so we have this idea of defending.
356.32s: Physicians.
360.40s: And then we know this is broken down into other terms synonyms. Right, so we had things like repair.
368.24s: We have things like salvage, adjust. All means the same thing. The core concept here is we have a position
381.20s: that conditions change enough that it requires our intervention. So position requires
394.64s: intervention.
399.84s: The reason why I prefer adjusting is because you can adjust positions that are both working
409.52s: in your favor and working against you. The entire baked in expectation, when we talk about terms
417.52s: like defending, repairing, salvaging, that immediately has a negative connotation. This immediately
427.20s: would make you believe that something is happening in this tray that we don't like and we are trying
431.92s: to make it better. That's the entire nature of defending. The idea of repairing, which is the
439.12s: prospect of putting something back to its original state literally doesn't apply in trading.
444.40s: You can literally throw the entire idea of repairing a trade because there is no going back
450.72s: to the original state. Shit is changed. And again, it might sound really trivial annoying thing
457.36s: pedantic to get hung up on the details here, but the reason why that matters because they all
462.72s: program the way your brain thinks about the scenario, the way you perceive information and then the
468.00s: way that you choose to move around the circumstance that you find yourself in. So if you go into this
473.44s: world of adjusting positions with the defensive mindset, that absolutely at the subconscious level
479.68s: is going to impact the way you process information. Same thing is let's say that I had a trade that
486.00s: I put on a short put and the underlying goes against me. And my goal when I set out as the
494.16s: trader is to repair that trade. Guess what I've just done? I've given myself a task that cannot
501.60s: be accomplished. So then what do you think again is going to happen as you go through that repairing
508.88s: phase? You're going to be really upset. You're going to be upset about something that you shouldn't
513.44s: even be upset about. You're going to be flustered about something you shouldn't be flustered about
517.20s: because the fact of the matter is as you've given yourself a task akin to go back in time.
524.80s: Literally can't do it. So that's why I care so much about the stupid,
530.32s: pedantic words we use around these. Even though they functionally mean very similar things,
536.88s: all of these impacts your subconscious processing of literally the entire rest of the process
543.20s: that you're about to undergo. So that is why in my view, I think it makes way more sense to simply
552.64s: refer to positions that require intervention as adjusting in a position, which is agnostic.
560.96s: That's not inherently good. It's not inherently bad. It simply means it's something that requires
566.24s: our attention. That's exactly what all of this other stuff means. It just adds a lot of bullshit
572.48s: to it that doesn't need to be there. Okay. I think hopefully I've made that point abundantly clear.
579.28s: The reason why this matters so much is because I learned a long time ago, this was back in middle
587.92s: school. I used to say to myself, I'm bad at math because I struggled. It was harder for me.
595.20s: I would say to myself, I'm bad at math. And guess what? I can I genuinely continue to struggle.
601.84s: And it's because I just accepted that as the reality. And this is just a deficiency that I have
607.28s: as a human being. And then at one point, it was like eighth grade. I just decided to stop saying it.
614.08s: I'd still believed it, but I literally just stopped allowing myself to verbalize it. That's it.
622.24s: And then all of a sudden math gradually started becoming much easier. That is a
629.60s: God honest true story from when I was a little kid. And at that point, it's when I realized like,
635.36s: okay, the way we think about things and the language we use absolutely impacts the rest of our
643.20s: relationship with whatever that thing is. And it's no different here. So
651.20s: little bit of context is to the, you know, back in Eric's archives is to why this kind of thing
656.48s: matters so much to me. And I think it should matter to you. Let's talk about this concept, however.
664.16s: So now we know that we don't want to refer to it as this stuff. We'll call it adjusting positions.
668.40s: So when we have to adjust a trade, what are the primary reasons that we might need to
679.60s: adjust to trade now? Before you start answering in the chat, I want you to apply
685.68s: organization in the way that we brainstorm this. So I want to start from guiding concepts big
693.68s: overarching things. And then we can get into further and further detail. So with that context,
700.64s: I would love to hear from you in the chat as to what are the circumstances that might lead us
707.36s: into deciding that we need to adjust one of our traits. We need to adjust the position starting
713.20s: from a very high level concept. And in the meantime, I'll answer Ben's question.
725.12s: Ben says, maybe you could explain why overall in options this concept exists. Why is it not just
732.48s: took a loss and now I'm taking another trade? That's a great question. And it's actually one of the
737.60s: artifacts that's very specific to options is that again, going back to the beginning,
743.20s: when we adjust a trade, it doesn't actually mean inherently that we're losing.
748.64s: If you remember, when we look at an options trade, it has multiple profit factors, multiple
756.96s: things that impact the premium of said option. So let's say, for example, I wanted to sell a put
768.88s: that is at a 30 delta. So I'm just picking a random expiration. And then I'll get rid of some of
776.48s: these because we don't need quite as many line items open. 75 should be good.
783.12s: And let's say I wanted to sell this 30 delta put that's 36 days out. When I sell this put,
791.28s: it's going to go on with a 33% probability of expiring in the money and a 66% chance of being touched.
802.48s: Kind of like Bill Cosby. Okay. So with that, if the options markets starts to move
812.08s: and we see that our 30 delta option is now at a 40 delta, things are going against us.
819.92s: All of these other subsequent probabilities change. All of the rest of our Greeks change.
827.12s: So it could be the scenario that we still like the trade, but now we've now gained too much gamma
834.16s: for what we want in the position and it requires an adjustment. Another example of this,
839.76s: that's in the concept of losing trade. Another example of this is actually something I've been doing
844.32s: with all of the levered coverage stringle strategies that I have on right now and ratio call
848.56s: diagonals because of the way that markets are behaving. If I sell a call, that's a 30 delta.
858.08s: And then the market moves, let's say 20 points away from where I originally sold that call.
866.16s: When I sell that call on 30 60, right now I'm gaining 16 cents of theta per day.
874.40s: If there's, let's say again, a 20 point move, so that would make our 579 option look like the 599.
882.16s: So we'll just use the 598s because they're close and I don't want to add more.
886.48s: We can see that my theta has now changed. My theta originally was 16 cents.
893.60s: Now my theta is 7 cents. The trade has moved in my favor in this scenario,
900.40s: but my daily profit from theta has been cut in half. So this could be another scenario where it's like,
908.48s: well, I still want to collect a higher theta because that's what fits the overall portfolio.
913.84s: This is now moved too far away. I need to readjust this position to then continue producing what I
921.04s: needed to produce in the context of the broader portfolio. So to summarize all of that for Ben,
927.44s: the reason why this exists in options trading and it can exist in other kinds of trading, by the
932.48s: way, but the reason why this exists in options trading is because we're dealing with securities
940.00s: that have a lot of other factors that impact their movement and their behavior.
945.68s: And very frequently when we put on a position in the beginning, we have a certain idea of the exposure
953.68s: we want or we should. If you don't, that just means you're a lay trader that's kind of just
960.00s: seeing how things go, which is not going to work well. For most of the more sophisticated
967.60s: traders, the Greeks matter a lot, the way that our position is going to behave matters tremendously.
973.84s: So that's exactly why this world of adjusting is so prevalent in options trading is because
980.16s: things move a lot and we want to have different methods to maintain the exposure we want.
986.40s: So now going back to the brainstorming in terms of the scenarios and the context,
992.56s: as to why we might use the adjusted trade. Let's see what you guys have come up with.
999.36s: Tommy says underlying price hits soft stops. I'm going to zoom that up. Tommy and I'm essentially
1006.80s: going to say P and L targets.
1015.52s: And this again can mean different things. It could mean we just take the whole trade down.
1020.08s: It could mean that we adjust the position. So this is completely fair to include here.
1025.44s: Next, travel says what we expect to happen with the trade does not happen or the opposite happens.
1032.80s: Okay. So I would argue that is partially captured in the P and L targets, but you're onto a very
1041.92s: important point because when we talk about options, there's a underlying factor that's very unique
1050.48s: to them in the fact that they expire. So we can have P and L targets that are hit, but we can
1059.04s: also have a trade. I have no idea what that is. I need to just like reload this.
1070.72s: I have no idea why what they're okay. Great.
1073.76s: Awesome. We figured it out. So the other thing here from P and L targets is there's absolutely a
1084.24s: scenario where our P and L targets might not be hit, but duration. Or good old tit. I'm in trade.
1095.60s: It requires us to do something. There's another third bucket here, which is the Greek profile.
1108.56s: Changes. So you'll notice compared to again, the more basic understanding of something like
1117.76s: adjustments, which is going to rest primarily on the stock is moving against us.
1122.72s: There's actually quite a few additional circumstances that might be relevant to us to adjust a position.
1128.80s: And this is kind of like a high level overview of most of it. There is another one that absolutely
1136.64s: goes in here, which would be the portfolio fit, which can change. So one of the realities is I
1143.92s: could have other positions that I'm doing things with, taking them down, adding more, that then
1150.16s: somehow indirectly impacts what's in this position. So that's absolutely another factor that again
1156.88s: is important to keep in mind. Now, as always, the reason why I structure it this way in that there
1167.28s: are these broad buckets is to help organize your thoughts. If we approach this exercise from the
1175.20s: world of just spitballing all of the conceivable situations that we might adjust a position in,
1182.56s: this would be chaotic. And it would be very difficult then to even logically process through
1188.40s: what makes sense. And as you all know, bringing order to chaos where possible is very important when
1195.36s: you're dealing with really complex systems. So that's exactly why I set it up this way for you.
1200.64s: So let's start with the subtext around these main things. P&L targets being hit is pretty easy.
1212.72s: This means that the trade hit our thresholds.
1223.52s: So then we have to do something. Duration time in trade. This simply means trade,
1230.80s: didn't. Hit thresholds. In time frame.
1245.12s: Greek profile changes. This means the original profile changed enough.
1260.88s: That it impacts our idea.
1271.44s: More portfolio. So what this means.
1280.80s: What this means is actually pretty simple. Oh, I can't slide it over. I realize that it was on
1287.76s: the edge. That's okay. What this means is pretty simple. Over the life cycle of a trade,
1296.72s: other things can move around with respect to volatility, with respect to time, with respect to
1306.72s: correlations that then change what the Greeks of our portfolio or positions look like
1315.92s: that then require us to look at each individual trade and to figure out what makes the most sense
1323.92s: for that new condition. And again, the reason why this is important is because if you have one
1330.24s: single trade, T1, not really that big a deal, right? You're going to have your Greeks. They're
1337.76s: going to be whatever they are. What starts to become more complex is then if you have T2, T3,
1344.08s: all the way out to T30. Because if all of these individual trades are kind of out there doing
1351.84s: their thing, living their best lives, and then all of a sudden just for whatever reason, things
1356.56s: start changing in the broad market, the systematic risk profile changes. Or whatever if you're using
1362.96s: only one individual kind of strategy, which is a mistake. If that starts to all coalesce together,
1369.04s: then all of a sudden your entire portfolio can take a completely different risk profile
1373.84s: than you had originally intended. That's a problem. So monitoring the Greek profile, not just
1381.44s: obviously for the individual trade, but for the portfolio. That is a lot. And obviously that
1386.16s: bleeds beautifully into the last one, which is there can be instances where other positions
1393.68s: require adjustments to trade. So a good example of this. Let's say I have a bunch of 30 delta
1412.08s: short puts on. I found something new that looks really, really good that I really want to sell
1417.28s: premium in. And then I looked through the rest of my portfolio and I realized like, man,
1422.24s: I have a lot of VOMMA right now, big vague risk. Let me go through my existing positions and see
1428.00s: if there's anything I can either take down or adjust. Maybe I move the strike out a little bit
1432.56s: further, something like that to reestablish if it's in profit, whatever the case is. So that then I
1437.76s: can add this new opportunity without the rest of my portfolio skewing too much because that becomes
1443.92s: dangerous. So if we're talking about this world of adjusting a trade, these are kind of the broad
1450.32s: buckets that lead us to then need to adjust a trade. So now what I want to do for the next 10
1457.20s: minutes or so before we wrap up is I would love to look at a couple examples with you, but I would
1462.88s: love to source the examples from you. So if there are specific strategies that you like to trade,
1472.56s: that you're trying to think about scenarios that you might want to adjust, then that's perfect.
1479.28s: I'd love to grab maybe one or two of them for us to take a look at. I know one of the scenarios
1484.72s: from the discord. I think Paulo, and I think he might be the one that originally asked the question,
1489.20s: I'm not positive, but Paulo is saying folding diagonals into calendar, straddles, into narrower,
1501.76s: or strangles into narrower strangles of straddles, iron condors to butterflies. All those are
1506.72s: completely viable. I just want to know if there's any specific one that we should focus on because
1513.84s: the reality is when we're adjusting positions, you're not going to be shocked at all to hear me say
1519.76s: this, but we should be executing something that's defined ahead of time. So my goal here is to try
1526.72s: and help give you some equipment to think about how to proceed through deciding how to adjust a
1535.12s: specific position so that then you can apply the framework to other kinds of things. Ben says,
1540.96s: I know you don't like credit spreads, but can you adjust credit spreads? Yeah, we can definitely
1545.20s: talk about that. Thomas says double diagonals on soy. I mean, if we want to talk about double
1550.88s: diagonals, we can, I think it's less relevant to most people, and then it doesn't, it's completely
1555.04s: agnostic to the whatever we're trading. Like soy wheat, like, doesn't matter.
1561.36s: But I think credit spreads is probably way more applicable anyways.
1567.92s: So let's take a look at what might be able to be done for a credit spread.
1574.72s: And I think we can close this down. I want to actually look at we'll go into on demand and we'll
1580.08s: literally look at a trade together. So Ben or anybody else, we'll talk about a vertical spread.
1587.04s: I assume that's what you mean by a credit spread. For those that don't know, credit spread literally
1591.92s: just means that you get a credit for putting on the spread. You can have a lot of different kinds
1597.52s: of structures that yield a credit as a spread. So the connotation I'm assuming from Ben though is
1604.48s: probably thinking vertical spread. That's what I'm assuming, but I want to confirm first. Ben
1611.92s: is that correct or did you have a different strategy in mind? Yes. Okay. Got it.
1622.40s: So that's great. So Ben, let's take a look then and we're going to talk about verticals
1629.68s: for the sake of a vertical and we can go through this pretty quick so that we can probably hit one
1633.68s: more. So when we're looking at a vertical spread, Ben, do you want to do something that's
1641.28s: bullish or bearish? For context, what I'm going to do is find a timeframe in the chart that does
1647.44s: the opposite of what we want. I'm going to put on different versions of the same trade so that we
1651.52s: literally can go back in time and then see how they behave and how they perform. So that's really
1658.00s: the next thing is I just need to know if we're talking about putter call side, put credit spread,
1666.48s: call credit spread, either of those bullish overalls would be a put credit spread. Great.
1673.28s: So that's perfect. So let's go to the 28th of Feb, completely good timing here and then we'll
1681.76s: literally put on a couple different versions and then we'll see what kind of things we might be
1685.60s: able to do with them. Let's go to 28th Feb and then this is going to start to load.
1698.56s: And we'll literally we'll play the scenario out, we'll eyeball it and then hopefully it'll give you
1703.92s: a little bit of context. Let's get over to the options chain.
1723.60s: And we'll just apply kind of standard protocols. We'll go out either 21 or 48 days.
1731.36s: I'm not going to use the weeklies.
1738.24s: Okay, and then again, we'll just use like standard protocols. So we'll do like a short
1743.04s: on the 30 delta. So then we'll do a $1 wide.
1751.60s: Let me get rid of the other ones. So that's a $1 wide, then we will do
1757.20s: a $2 wide.
1765.20s: And then we will do a $5 wide.
1773.44s: And then we will do a $10 wide.
1777.44s: And then one more, we'll do a $20 wide.
1788.48s: So what I'm doing right now is I'm giving us multiple versions to look at.
1794.32s: Now this is a again, like a broader thing to be aware of when you're testing ideas,
1799.52s: what I'm doing here is very purposeful because by inherently testing multiple ideas in one shot,
1807.60s: it makes it much more efficient for me because then I can eyeball the difference between all of
1815.20s: these relatively quickly. And then just get a sense of, okay, well, what what happens here?
1821.44s: What matters here? That's the whole point. So the first things that I would do if I were like
1830.08s: testing this more seriously is I would build a little bit of a tracker, which you've all seen
1837.68s: different versions of this before. So I would start with a date. So the date that we're at in the
1844.88s: scenarios 28 Feb. And then I'm not going to waste the time to fill it in because it would take a while.
1850.00s: But what I would do is essentially break it out by the different trades that I would have on.
1856.40s: So I would have a strike stock price. I would have a strike price.
1864.72s: I would have all the Greeks Delta Gamma,
1869.52s: or Gammy, data, Vega. And the whole point of this is so that I could monitor how they change
1878.24s: as things move. It gives me ideas. So that's exactly what I would build. But that aside,
1884.56s: let's now take a look at these different trades. We know with these different vertical spreads,
1890.24s: our ultimate preference would be for the stock to go up. So we know that if the stock goes down,
1896.32s: that's not that's doing what we don't want. So then the next question we would ask ourselves,
1902.40s: and this is looking at it through the vacuum of just the position. So I purposely used short
1910.00s: the 570 in all of them so that we only have one short strike to look at in all of these scenarios.
1918.48s: Again, it's much more efficient. So then for the chat, for the group here, let's brainstorm
1925.84s: how might we choose to attempt to manage this short but vertical spread? What might we do when?
1937.92s: So we know that there's absolutely a time component to it. That's for sure.
1943.36s: And in this case, the passage of time actually helps us. So as time goes, if it's not hitting
1952.16s: our PNL target, well, doesn't effectively matter that much unless we choose to set some sort of
1959.44s: early time-based management for whatever reason, which absolutely can be the case.
1966.40s: If again, our system requires that. So that's something that we could consider.
1972.64s: What else could we consider? The most obvious one is if the short strike gets breached,
1981.68s: because here's the reality. Even though that this is a spread, and our risk is going to be defined
1990.40s: at the onset of the trade, well, there absolutely will be a problem come expiration.
1998.08s: Because if the short strike is breached and the long isn't, then we have a problem. Now,
2004.88s: you're still generally going to be okay depending on your broker and how your broker would manage
2009.36s: that trade for you. But the reality is it absolutely can occur where your short strike is breached,
2015.20s: you're assigned on the short, and then you still have the long or the long expires. That kind of
2019.84s: sucks. So we don't really want that scenario. So we'll hone in on that specific circumstance.
2027.60s: But again, to give you a playbook to work off of, those are some of the other circumstances that
2032.64s: might matter to us even for something like a vertical spread, where there could be a time-based
2037.44s: element, where after a certain amount of time in the trade based on our system that we've developed,
2042.56s: even if it doesn't hit our PNL targets, it could be another spot that we choose to manage the
2047.92s: trade. But this one we will use when it breaches our short strike of 570. And again, we picked a
2056.80s: quote unquote favorable time for this example, because we know it happens. I don't know exactly what
2061.68s: day it happens. We'll figure it out in a sec. And then let's keep going to the six.
2070.40s: And then I might have picked a bad example, because these might be far enough out of the money.
2078.88s: There it is, finally. So it happens on the seventh. So now our short strike has been breached.
2089.68s: And it started a little bit lower than what it was now. So let's actually move us back in time
2096.64s: closer to the open so that we can be closer to the actual
2105.44s: let's see what time I don't know what time it settled around that low figured out.
2115.20s: Let's try 830. There we go. This works. So 0830,
2122.56s: Pacific time we notice that our short strike has been breached at this point. The entire spread is
2128.00s: in the money. So now let's take a look at all these different spreads. First, we'll start with the
2132.64s: dollar wide, the 570 and the 569. This is the trade we're going to look at. We were looking to make
2142.96s: 23 bucks risking 77. Now let's figure out what this trade would look like at this point when it
2150.64s: finishes buffering. And again, this is the 570, 569. Let's see.
2165.44s: One of the things that you will notice with something like vertical spreads is your ability to do
2172.08s: much is actually limited depending on the width. So here the 575, 569 right now the mid price
2180.08s: is 42 cents and the natural is 34 cents. So our trade here in this context because we sold it
2190.40s: for 23 cents, our trade here would effectively be trying to buy it to close at 42 cents.
2199.68s: So the first thing most traders will try to do is just close the whole spread down if they want
2206.64s: and then you can absolutely look at potentially trying to roll the spread. The issue with trying
2214.64s: to roll a vertical spread, especially if you try to roll it as a vertical spread is you'll notice
2223.12s: that there is a big liquidity constraint for two reasons. One, we only have 41 DTE 49 54 70.
2233.04s: So the next primary expiration is out here 70 days to expiration. The next thing is we now know we
2238.80s: need to get something that if we got a fill at 42 cents, which notice this is an 8 cent wide
2245.60s: bit ass spread. So if volatility is going up and if your trade is struggling, let's say that it
2252.80s: might be more probable for you to get a fill something like 45 cents if things work out appropriately.
2258.96s: So let's see where I would have to go in order to get a 45 cent wide, but oh shit, what's the next
2267.20s: thing I notice? What happened to the dollar wide strikes? I see some of them here at the 580,
2276.08s: but below 580, I don't see dollar wide strikes. So what happened? It's liquidity. The market has an
2284.56s: opened up dollar wide strikes on these because they're 70 days out. So now that's another hurdle we
2289.68s: are going to have to figure out. So let's say then our short leg is at the 570 and we say, well,
2295.44s: we don't want to go any worse than 570. So let's see if we can sell the 570 and get the 565. Well,
2301.36s: of course you can, but what's now happened is you've increased your risk by $4. We've gone from
2308.56s: $1 wide to $5 wide. This might not represent the position you want at all. So to summarize the very
2316.40s: small with vertical spreads is you're going to come into various versions of liquidity constraints.
2323.20s: That doesn't mean you can't roll, but one of the things, one of the only ways to even
2327.76s: stand a chance at trying to roll a vertical spread, especially during volatile periods is by
2332.88s: adjusting the individual legs. And that opens up different risks depending on the order that you
2338.56s: adjust the legs. So to summarize all of that with something like a vertical spread, the overwhelming
2345.12s: stance of sophisticated traders, including myself, that would trade a vertical spread, especially
2350.72s: narrower, like five points and in is you just, it's just a directional hypothesis. And it's either
2358.00s: going to be right or wrong. That doesn't mean that you can't take it down early for a loss.
2362.48s: If something moves against you big and you think it's going to stay down there, it doesn't
2367.04s: mean that you have to sit there and wait, but it does mean I'm not going to try to roll it.
2371.28s: That is the exact kind of scenario where I would just close that trade. And then if my idea is
2376.00s: still appropriate, sure, I can go open a new one, but to try to pair those as a rolling order,
2383.12s: really, really, really challenging, very challenging. The probability of getting filled at anything
2387.68s: even remotely favorable is about zero. In fact, it's not going to happen. So that's one scenario.
2394.24s: Now what I was just alluding to opens us up to discuss the second scenario, which is one of
2401.20s: these wider verticals. So let's take a look at this 20 point wide vertical. In this 20 point wide
2409.92s: vertical that we first put on, our true intention is probably not using the 50 as a risk management.
2420.72s: The probability of somebody trading this kind of vertical, the 57550, this is way more likely to be
2427.12s: somebody that's just using the wing for margin management, right? Because if you have a smaller
2433.12s: account and you want to just sell the 570, that's really expensive. But if you can see that in this
2439.36s: case where we're 20 points wide, it's only asking for 2 grand. And it's limited to that 2 grand,
2444.96s: which is kind of nice, you know, again, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. So my broader
2449.36s: point here is that the person who's trading this is much likely to be somebody that's trading this
2453.76s: as a vertical in the traditional sense and more so probably adding the wing and treating that short
2459.84s: put as a naked short put. Okay, fine. So what changes in this context, not much, but the difference is
2467.92s: that this again, the context of trying to leg around this, I think going to happen, meaning to
2476.08s: trade this as a vertical spread and then hit create a rolling order where it's going to try to close
2482.08s: this one and open a new one in the same order stream. It's not going to happen. So what you can do
2488.00s: in this kind of scenario is absolutely manage the trade by rolling it again in line with whatever
2495.60s: your approach is, but you would have to do it in individual legs. So then it opens the question,
2501.04s: what is the order of legs that makes the most sense? It's always going to be managing the short
2507.36s: option first. Because what's very dangerous is if I choose to close my long option first and then
2516.96s: or whatever reason at that moment before I have a chance to get the new long on something happens
2525.20s: for whatever reason, you now have an undefined risk trade on and your broker again, if you don't
2532.00s: have the money for it, they might not even allow it. They might say that you can't close this
2536.16s: individual leg because you would exceed the margin required for the position. So the way to manage
2542.72s: something like this is is pretty easy. Normally what we would do is close out the 570. So close out
2552.56s: that put. You can leave this long put on if you're so inclined until you finish the roll. Don't
2557.68s: have to. You can close the 570 and then you can close the 550 or you can just close this as an
2566.24s: entire vertical and then open up a new one. Now if you're trying to get an optimal fill and if you're
2572.72s: trying to play spreads, what you can do is close the 570, go roll out in meaning figure out we're
2579.44s: going to go with that 570, make that adjustment while keeping that 550 on because your risk is still
2585.84s: managed in this context and then you can add the other leg once you complete that then close this
2592.48s: residual long leg. It kind of adds complexity for no reason for most people. The easiest way to
2597.84s: adjust something like this is to leg out of it and then put a new one on. So when we're trading
2603.44s: verticals more often than not, the concept here is essentially just leave it alone.
2610.48s: Now Elizabeth opens up another really great question which is roll the untested side.
2616.16s: Rolling the untested side occurs differently from verticals and that will happen in this context. Let
2623.68s: me get rid of these. And then let's go back like we did to 28 beb for the same scenario and then
2633.20s: I got to open the door for a throat real quick.
2648.16s: Okay. So it looks like it's still hitting me with a buffer.
2656.88s: All right. So now let's take a look at what this roll the untested side means. Let's say that we
2672.16s: were selling strangles. I do this all the time. We have 19 delta there and because of all the skew,
2682.00s: we have to go super far out of the money on the call side to get to these.
2687.28s: And then 19 delta here. So here's the trade that we have on.
2698.00s: And from a margin requirement, this asks for 15k effectively. So now let's fast forward time again
2705.92s: because we know this goes against us, which is convenient. And we have the 545 and the 623.
2713.36s: I don't know if it gets bad in either of these technically, but that's okay.
2719.84s: Because we'll take a look at the change in the delta.
2729.44s: It's buffering right now.
2730.80s: So here's what's happened. In this scenario, we started where both legs were a 19 delta.
2741.44s: If we take a look now, our short puts have moved up to a 30 delta. They're not quite challenged
2748.64s: yet technically, typically speaking when we're referring to challenge, it would be when they're
2752.24s: like at the money. But this still is that side being tested. And the rolling of the untested side
2760.16s: is actually what I was talking to you before in the context of the covered strangle.
2765.60s: Remember how I told you for the covered strangle. I'm in the process of rolling in the money short
2770.48s: puts out and down trying to adjust those. And I'm rolling the calls closer at the money. That's
2777.84s: rolling the untested side. So in this context, tested refers to whichever leg is being challenged
2784.16s: by the market of a short option. So in this case, it would be the put side. And then the untested
2790.72s: side in this case is the call side. And effectively, what we're saying, if this is a short strangle,
2797.60s: well, here's what's happening. That's really dangerous. These are gaining way more
2804.96s: deltas. And the puts and the call side is losing deltas. So normally, if we're trading something
2813.68s: like a short strangle and we want to keep it more balanced and to try to actually isolate volatility,
2821.04s: what that means is as this starts to move and this is now a 30 delta, what does that mean for
2828.96s: our position? Well, it means that if the underlying moves down, we lose 30 cents here. How much would
2838.24s: we gain from the corresponding call side? We gain nine. Not a great trade off. Pretty shitty. It feeds
2847.04s: the purpose. Now, the benefit here is that if it moves in our favor, meaning the price goes up,
2853.52s: we gain 30 cents and we only lose nine. But what's the difference here? We've effectively taken
2858.64s: a strategy that was designed to be neutral. And it has a very clear directional tilt at this point.
2864.56s: This trade wants the market to go up. It needs the market to go up if it continued to move either
2871.68s: direction. So the idea of rolling the untested side is to rebalance the position. So I originally put
2879.84s: this trade on 19 deltas on the short side on the calls and puts 19 short deltas 19 long deltas. They
2888.00s: balance each other out. So that means that if it moves in either direction, I don't have big
2893.36s: directional risk. Now I do. So to fix that, I can say, I'm going to take in these six 23s. I would
2900.48s: take them in at a profit because they will be making money. The calls will be cheaper than what I
2906.16s: sold them for. And I might take them all the way into a 30 delta here. And I can take them to the
2911.76s: 596s. So now what I've effectively done is rebalance the deltas. This is rolling the untested side.
2920.72s: Now you can roll the untested side for a bunch of different reasons. It really depends on
2926.32s: the purpose of the position. In this context, I'm showing you rolling the untested side to rebalance
2932.48s: your deltas for the context of a covered strangle. I'm not really trying to rebalance my deltas. I
2938.48s: don't care. It's just the fact that the underlying is moving down and I can make more money with
2942.96s: the short calls by continuing to move them down with the underlying. So in the context of a covered
2948.16s: strangle, it's not really to rebalance the deltas as to follow the move. But the concept is we're
2954.40s: adjusting the side of the trade that effectively is in profit. And it's to regain sensitivity to
2962.08s: the rest of the Greeks. Elizabeth, does that make sense? Do you have any follow-up questions for that?
2971.60s: And then I will pivot to Pallos in a sec. But I want to make sure Elizabeth years is good.
2982.88s: The cook cannot pineapple bubbly. It's pretty solid.
2991.68s: Elizabeth says, make sense? Need to write that down. Yeah. If I were to write it down, I would
2995.84s: essentially phrase it as when I have a position. I mean, you can even roll an untested option. It would
3004.56s: be not referred to as the untested side. When we say the tested versus untested side, that infers
3010.72s: that there's a spread of some sort. But you really can adjust the untested option at any point.
3019.36s: So you can have just a short call. And then the market can move in your favor, meaning it's untested
3024.80s: and you can choose to rebalance it. So the way I would think about it is essentially adjusting
3030.88s: an option where it's moved in my favor. And I want to regain a certain Greek profile.
3041.28s: Cool. So Pallos says, I'm most puzzled by diagonals to calendars. When is this tactic worthwhile?
3050.24s: Pallos, do you have an example of a trade that you would like to look at together?
3056.56s: And then happy to explore it with you. If you don't, we can talk about it in a theoretical concept.
3064.40s: But if you have a specific trade or a specific version of the strategy, that would be
3070.48s: ideal for me. Because as you know, I do my best to make the stuff that we review during the
3078.40s: streams more relevant to you, the individual. That's kind of the fun part, I think at least.
3085.52s: And then if not, like I said, happy to just build one.
3092.88s: Okay, so Pallos says Oracle, let's do that. And when
3101.84s: Pallo, when did you put the trade on just so I can go to that day? If you put it on recently,
3107.04s: that's fine. With on demand, we essentially are blacked out for the last nine trading days.
3115.36s: So if it's in the last nine trading days, then I'll just pick another time, go as close as I can to it.
3120.64s: And then I see
3137.44s: just before earnings. Okay, when did they have earnings? Well, they like just had earnings.
3142.56s: Yeah, okay. So just before what had been on the 10th, I think the furthest we can go back.
3157.68s: I mean, that's pretty good. It's super close. But I think this is fine, actually.
3163.68s: We just won't be able to fast forward, which is okay.
3166.00s: I'll punch this down. And you're talking about when it went to 140 them back to 150.
3177.20s: So it had a 10 point move. 65, 53.
3183.28s: Okay.
3193.52s: Okay, let's just even eyeball the trade as it sits. So you had the March
3204.72s: 28th. And then the March 14th. So two got it.
3213.20s: So the March 28th, you had the 150s.
3219.12s: Is on the put side. And then did you put it on for a creditor, a debit, I'm assuming you bought it.
3233.76s: Around five March. I know that this one isn't your trade, but
3240.40s: I'll fix it to be what we want. I just want to know what leg you did what with if you bought our sold.
3251.44s: Now for those that don't know when you're looking at things like diagonals,
3255.92s: well, there's a couple different ways to look at them. Calendar spread is effectively when you're
3261.04s: same strike, different explorations. Diagnals is when you combine a vertical move and a horizontal move,
3268.80s: get it diagonal move. So it's when you're in different explorations, but then you're also at different
3273.36s: strikes. So I'm waiting to see what Apollo put the diagonal on for. If you sold the back or bought
3285.20s: the back, which will effectively say whether this goes on for a credit or a debit debit. Yeah,
3291.52s: okay. So you paid, which is super common. So what that means is he's long the 150s and 28 March.
3300.48s: And then in 14 March here, he is short. It looks like the 140s.
3311.92s: So let me see if I have this. No, I flipped them. My bad. My bad. This is 28. So it's this one.
3321.52s: 28 at the 150. And then this one is the 14th at 140.
3332.24s: So then this effectively will go on for a debit. The reason why this is the case is we're buying a more
3341.12s: expensive further out in time option. And then we are selling a cheaper, near dated option.
3350.00s: So this is what the diagonal will look like in this context. So now what what Apollo is talking about
3359.12s: is turning it into a calendar. And there are two ways we can turn it into a calendar. We can either
3367.20s: roll the further dated option or we can roll the near dated option. And the defense, quote, unquote,
3377.52s: really depends on the way that it moves and what we're trying to accomplish. And we can just kind of,
3382.64s: you know, think through logically what might happen in the scenario. So if we go back to analyze and
3389.60s: let's say the stock does move. And let's say the stock right now is at 148 in this scenario.
3399.36s: And what did Oracle do? You said it went down in them back up. So let's say Oracle goes down. You
3406.08s: said it went down to like 140, which would be like near max profit, something like that. And then it
3412.16s: went up to 150. So if we're in this scenario where the option that's further out in time is doing
3422.32s: most of the work and the option that's nearer in time is doing less of the work, right? Like think
3427.92s: about what adjustment might make sense. In this case, we sold the 140 put. It's now trading down
3436.40s: towards 140. Would we in any scenario want us to roll that put up to the 150? Probably not. Could
3447.28s: do it, but doesn't make a lot of sense. So then we could choose to roll the long option that's
3454.16s: further out in time down. Now would that make sense in this context again, probably not.
3461.12s: The main reason being is because unless you have a longer term game plan for the strategy.
3467.44s: If it's sitting at your max profit, which effectively this is, then that's actually getting
3472.16s: closer to what I would consider to be your P&L management approach. So in this context, I don't
3478.16s: really think it makes a lot of sense to roll either of them. Now in the world where why we might
3486.00s: choose to do that, let's take a look at the Greeks. So we can see that right now the 150s that are
3494.80s: 18 days to expiration, they have effectively a 50 delta to gamma 24 theta that we're losing and 14 vega.
3507.52s: So then if we wanted to convert this into a calendar, we would then need to share the same strike,
3516.64s: which may or may not make sense. One of the more common instances I would see this convert into
3523.04s: a calendar is actually if we're moving this short put to roll it out in time and then we might
3532.64s: hit the same strike, but still not super frequently. And it's because I wouldn't want to roll the short put
3539.68s: all the way up into something that's at the money if it's trading at 150, I would want to roll it down.
3545.84s: So then what's the context on what happens to the long option that's out in 28 March? Well,
3551.76s: if we take this 150 and we roll it down, what does that do? Well, it decreases our short delta,
3561.60s: it decreases our gamma, decreases our theta, and decreases our vega. It essentially desensitizes
3570.16s: literally all of the Greeks. So why might we do that if we want something to move slower or whatever
3578.48s: reason? So the process of converting, and I wouldn't even view it personally, I think it's too
3585.04s: constraining to view it as like converting a diagonal into a calendar. It's kind of myopic.
3595.60s: I would just view it as adjusting the further dated leg and the shorter dated leg to whatever strikes
3603.44s: makes sense for your idea. So whenever we're talking about the adjusting of options,
3611.68s: it's important not to get wrapped up in what the structure might be called, it doesn't really matter.
3618.56s: What matters is does the position reflect the position we want to have? And that can be the position
3625.60s: for the specific trade that we have on, or it can be the position that fits with the portfolio better.
3631.20s: So, Paulo, in your case in this scenario, I don't really see a scenario where I personally would
3642.80s: want to turn this into a calendar. Now, the scenario that might be more appropriate for a calendar
3651.52s: is if you put it on for a credit and you're adjusting the further out in time option,
3658.96s: that can make sense. And what that means is if we flip this like we were talking about before,
3666.88s: and let's say that we close this, I'm just going to have it by the diagonal. And in this case,
3678.88s: I don't want to, yeah, this is fine. So in this case, what's happening is we're going to be
3685.60s: long the 4 April 145 and then short the 28 March 25. So you can have this configured a few
3697.44s: different ways, but we can have this where we're actually short the further dated option
3704.72s: and then long the near dated option. So in this kind of trade, it changes things a bit. And the
3714.00s: reason why it changes things for a bit is because let's say Oracle does indeed start rallying down.
3721.20s: And let's say our short option that's out in 145, something like that. Let's say that that first
3729.92s: starts getting challenged, but then all of a sudden, it starts rallying the other direction.
3736.72s: We might want to pace the short put and move it up to the 150 to follow that price movement to
3743.36s: capture as much as we can. Kind of a different method to adjust it, but again, very similar to
3750.40s: verticals, very infrequently does in my opinion, it make a bunch of sense to adjust diagonals in
3760.00s: this way. It's primarily the way I would think about it specifically managing a diagonal into a
3768.96s: calendar. It's like very specific. I would think of it way more as just adjusting the individual
3774.48s: legs to get the exposure that I want. My ratio call diagonals, for example, I manage the long legs
3782.56s: differently than the short legs. And I manage the short legs pretty actively, but I'm not like
3787.68s: trying to turn it into a calendar or anything specific. I'm just trying to make the trade look
3793.36s: however I want. So key takeaway there and broader recommendation when we think about this stuff is
3800.64s: like don't constrain the positional adjustments to names. And again, I know that that's not the real
3807.68s: question that's being asked, you know, diagonal to calendar, but again, like that's the subtext that
3812.00s: comes through. There's nothing wrong with adjusting either leg, one strike, and keeping it as a
3819.92s: diagonal if that better reflects your idea. So there are scenarios however we're adjusting the
3826.64s: individual legs can make sense. Most of those instances are going to be following profit movements
3832.32s: and it's typically going to be done more so on the short leg, just in the long leg absolutely
3837.44s: can be done. But the short leg, if something's moving in your favor, typically the long leg is
3846.08s: going to continue to gain more deltas, which is what you want. And the short leg is going to
3850.64s: potentially gain or lose deltas again depending on which way it goes. But if it goes in your
3855.28s: favor, considering the short leg, you start losing deltas and a lot of times you'll want those
3861.60s: back for the broader position. So to recap what we talked about in the context of defending positions,
3871.36s: I like to view it way more as simply adjusting positions. And the way that I mentally think about
3879.28s: it is always just getting the position to reflect the risk that I want to have on. That's the
3887.68s: ultimate objective. That's the entire purpose of any of these adjustment style strategies,
3894.32s: where the original risk profile of our trade looked one way, then as the market moved,
3899.28s: it then looked differently. And we want it to look more reflective of again, whatever the idea is
3907.92s: that we have. So any questions on any of that, anything else that you guys want to hit? I have a
3914.00s: couple minutes. So if we want to talk about the markets really fast, let me know. I can take a look
3918.72s: at any individual tickers quickly. I know that we're at an hour, but my dinner's not going to be here
3925.04s: for a little bit. And I already pretty much did the work I need to do for the broader videos.
3931.60s: I already have most of the videos queued up, which is awesome, meaning for when I'm traveling next
3937.68s: month to Ireland. So that this way you guys will still get material while I'm out prowlicking
3947.52s: with the leprechauns. I will report back if I find a leprechaun. I'm eager to see if I can get my
3956.24s: eyeballs on one. Feel like there's got to be at least one in like a costume. I hope at least.
3965.52s: South Korea to prepare measures on US steel tariffs and march interesting.
3971.44s: Bay areas. Can you take a look at Palantir? What are your expectations for the potential news
3979.04s: based event? Marley, yeah, take a look. I have a position on Palantir.
3985.92s: So first things first, Palantir has had pretty mellow moves. The average move using a rolling 20-day
3995.68s: window is like three quarters of a standard deviation, which is actually a little bit lighter
4001.20s: than what it should be, which is interesting. Now, today Palantir rallied a bit up 7%.
4012.16s: And this was for a couple reasons. I don't know if you guys saw, but there was new news that came out
4017.28s: that I think it was last night actually. The news came out that there was another contract that
4023.28s: Palantir was being targeted for. Let's see if that news came out yesterday. No.
4037.28s: I don't see that news here. I'm curious when the news came out.
4044.16s: One sec.
4045.60s: I'm just wondering what actual time that news came out. So, I remember seeing it.
4064.08s: Let's see if this cut would have been in the evening. Here we go.
4067.44s: No.
4076.00s: Here we go.
4077.12s: ApeCon and Defense Deals be the combat catalyst.
4083.60s: No. It's not the main one. There was literally just...
4091.84s: Maybe I don't remember.
4093.60s: There was a specific article. I literally remember reading it on my phone about a new contract
4098.48s: that somebody was going to open with Palantir. I don't remember. But anyways, that part aside,
4106.88s: I think Palantir itself is still pretty well positioned. Let's take a look at what the options
4114.08s: tell us. No, that's not right. 2.1 mil against 1.4 on the call side. If we take a look at the
4124.08s: vol for tomorrow or for 21 March, it's 95% for this front expiration. It's 113. So definitely
4132.80s: pricing in pretty heavy vol for the rest of this week. Let's take a look at what this week is
4139.60s: showing us for options. It's effectively two times almost. Paul's to puts.
4146.08s: So that generally would lead us to believe that the market is positioning and positioning
4151.60s: itself for an upside move. That's the broad, the broad note. Let's see if there's anything else
4158.32s: we can uncover quickly. The LTR.
4163.84s: What I'm doing now is I want to get a sense of, yeah, so like this is people positioning today.
4173.36s: So what I'm doing is I'm looking at the net call premium in how that reflects sentiment.
4179.44s: This is obviously a lot of people unwinding. But the interesting thing here is if you take a look
4186.96s: at the overall activity today, it's definitely bullish leaning and this is going to be positioning
4194.00s: primarily for tomorrow. Now let's take a look at the near term.
4199.76s: I'll answer. Let's take a look at
4211.20s: plus seven days. And then what I want to do is actually look at this specific
4218.96s: expiration for this Friday. Yeah, look at this. Two million
4228.40s: at the 75s. 1.2 at the 75s. These are interesting. These being so tight in. What is this part of?
4249.60s: Yeah, this looks like a hybrid of stuff tied to the 86s because it would be a strange
4259.36s: spread for the 86s to be tied to the 75s. Let's see.
4279.28s: This is like impossible to tell. So this one's really, really hard to tell.
4290.00s: This could be short the 75s and then long these, but it looks the inverse where the 75s came in
4299.68s: at 1003 much closer, not much, but a little bit closer to the offer. So it looks like
4308.80s: they might be thinking that this could be a cost spread, 2000 contracts each.
4320.00s: So it does look somewhat generally bullish positioning.
4328.16s: Take a look at the volume for today. And then let's take a look at the volume for the 14 March
4334.48s: 189. Let's see.
4353.60s: How do people take in general shots as you would expect?
4360.24s: Super active. Really, really active. Yeah, this looks like a general makes back, but in general,
4372.72s: what I can loosely identify is slightly more favorable bullish side positioning for the
4380.96s: expectation on tomorrow. Call side looks like a higher probability of a downside move,
4388.32s: but more upside severity. But what's interesting is I'm looking at it is for the near strikes,
4399.52s: it's actually lower on the call side. So what do we have? 85. Let's go 10 points wide. 103.
4408.16s: Yes, so it's actually favoring that's fascinating. So it's favoring a higher probability of a smaller
4417.04s: up move with a slightly higher severity of a downside move, but then it becomes overwhelmed
4424.40s: to the upside. So what this means is it's a higher probability of a small upside move with the
4430.08s: moderate probability of a slightly larger downside move with a low probability of a really big
4435.28s: upside move. That's what all of that means. I hope that makes sense. Interesting.
4446.48s: Scott says GME and earnings call later this month. Yeah, boy.
4452.40s: I owe you guys a video on GameStop. So I'll do a literally wrap this up and then I'll take a
4457.28s: look at that. Base says new contracts with Heineken and Walgreens potentially more for
4464.56s: to be announced tomorrow allegedly. I saw I got to figure out what the fucking news I saw yesterday,
4469.20s: but I saw something about maybe no, it wasn't lunar. I figured out, but there was also there was
4474.96s: literally news. I saw come out last night that talked about a couple couple new things. Ben says
4480.40s: you mentioned these smaller medium companies with weird option activity. Would you say it's a valid
4484.48s: path to chase it? Would you say no? I mean, it's definitely valid. Is that the best return on time
4489.76s: for a newer trader? I would argue absolutely not because it's one of the more nuanced places
4495.76s: to try to do anything. I think the better time spent for a newer option trader is to get good market
4502.96s: fundamentals down, which is essentially finding ways to optimize beta return. I think it's a great
4510.24s: starting point. And then once you get through optimizing beta and you have like a good core approach
4516.08s: that generally is sustainable and makes money, then it's okay to venture off into the weeds and
4523.04s: take a look at all these other random approaches, but I think it just becomes more difficult to
4527.68s: rationalize. But I'm going to hop off so I can make this game stop video because I owe it to
4532.32s: everybody and there's a couple adjustments. If you guys need anything, let me know Friday is our
4537.68s: second to last options trading basic stream. So don't miss that. We're going to be talking about
4543.20s: managing a portfolio. Be an outlier. See you later.
