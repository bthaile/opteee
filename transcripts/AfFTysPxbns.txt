0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  Ganze
150.00s:  the position to try and quote unquote fix it.
154.40s:  There's another common version of this that you will hear,
158.16s:  which is referred to as trade repair,
163.84s:  which also drives me absolutely crazy.
168.96s:  So the session for today is to talk about these concepts first,
174.16s:  like what they are, what they actually mean.
176.48s:  And then the second element is to kind of tip my hat a little bit
183.92s:  and give you a peek inside as to why I hate that framing.
189.60s:  And then the third thing more importantly is to actually talk about some of the steps we can
195.04s:  functionally take to adjust positions. And as you can tell,
201.20s:  that's my preferred framing is adjusting. Now at a very high level,
206.48s:  this is one of those things that only somebody that is a purist or is very interested
216.40s:  in the details of something would really even care about this.
221.04s:  And what I mean by that, the fact that it even bothers me,
224.80s:  that it's referred to as defending versus repairing versus something else,
230.88s:  that's kind of like a very nuanced position that most people won't really care about.
236.08s:  And rightfully so because it's objectively not that big of a deal. But
242.48s:  like most things as you gain experience, you start to have certain things that the details
249.68s:  matter a lot. And then there's other things that the details don't really matter.
254.24s:  And you can, you know, laws of fare refer to things interchangeably that may not otherwise
259.68s:  tend to be so a great example of that is something like scalping. We refer to that
264.80s:  commonly even though that's 100% not functionally what it is, but it's close enough. It doesn't
270.96s:  really matter. Now let's first talk about this topic. I'm going to move over to the main screen so
277.44s:  that I can look a little more simply at what we're talking about. And then we got to grab
284.40s:  let me grab another scratch pad just for random activities.
295.60s:  Okay. Cool. So you guys should be on the main screen now, which is great.
303.20s:  So let's start with the conversation. And when we get into it,
310.40s:  there are going to be these two primary threads lenses. We're going to look at things through.
316.48s:  We're going to look at things through the lens of spread style strategies,
321.28s:  but then also single style strategies. So I intend to talk about both of those.
328.00s:  So first, let's start with the terminology as it sits so that we are speaking the same language.
337.84s:  I'm going to make the text a little bit smaller so that it's easier to see. There we go.
344.56s:  Okay. So we have this idea of defending
356.32s:  positions. And then we know this is broken down into other terms synonyms.
364.24s:  So we had things like repair. We have things like salvage, adjust,
374.80s:  all means the same thing. The core concept here is we have a position
385.12s:  that conditions change enough that it requires our intervention. So position requires
394.64s:  intervention.
395.36s:  The reason why I prefer adjusting is because you can adjust positions that are both working in
409.60s:  your favor and working against you. The entire baked in expectation when we talk about terms like
417.92s:  defending, repairing, salvaging, that immediately has a negative connotation.
426.24s:  This immediately would make you believe that something is happening in this trade that we don't
430.88s:  like and we are trying to make it better. That's the entire nature of defending.
436.16s:  The idea of repairing, which is the prospect of putting something back to its original state,
442.96s:  literally doesn't apply in trading. You can literally throw the entire idea of
447.12s:  repairing a trade because there is no going back to the original state.
452.32s:  Shit is changed. And again, it might sound really trivial annoying thing,
457.36s:  pedantic to get hung up on the details here. But the reason why that matters is because they all
462.72s:  program the way your brain thinks about the scenario, the way you perceive information,
467.68s:  and then the way that you choose to move around the circumstance that you find yourself in.
472.08s:  So if you go into this world of adjusting positions with the defensive mindset,
476.88s:  that absolutely at the subconscious level is going to impact the way you process information.
483.36s:  Same thing is, let's say that I had a trade that I put on a short put and the underlying goes
489.28s:  against me. And my goal when I set out as the trader is to repair that trade. Guess what I've just
498.00s:  done? I've given myself a task that cannot be accomplished. So then what do you think again
505.20s:  is going to happen as you go through that repairing phase? You're going to be really upset.
511.52s:  You're going to be upset about something that you shouldn't even be upset about. You're going to be
514.80s:  flustered about something you shouldn't be flustered about because the fact of the matter is,
518.96s:  you've given yourself a task akin to go back in time. Literally can't do it. So that's why I care
528.72s:  so much about the stupid pedantic words we use around these. Even though they functionally mean
534.88s:  very similar things, all of these impacts your subconscious processing of literally the entire
541.76s:  rest of the process that you were about to undergo. So that is why in my view, I think it makes
550.64s:  way more sense to simply refer to positions that require intervention as adjusting in a position.
558.48s:  Which is agnostic. That's not inherently good. It's not inherently bad. It simply means it's
565.28s:  something that requires our attention. That's exactly what all of this other stuff means. It just
571.20s:  adds a lot of bullshit to it that doesn't need to be there. Okay. I think hopefully I've made that
577.44s:  point abundantly clear. The reason why this matters so much is because I learned a long time ago,
586.48s:  this was back in middle school. I used to say to myself, I'm bad at math because I struggled. It
593.84s:  was harder for me. I would say to myself, I'm bad at math. And guess what? I can I genuinely
600.16s:  continue to struggle. And it's because I just accepted that as the reality. And this is just a
606.08s:  deficiency that I have as a human being. And then at one point, it was like eighth grade. I just
611.60s:  decided to stop saying it. I'd still believed it. But I literally just stopped allowing myself
619.28s:  to verbalize it. That's it. And then all of a sudden math gradually started becoming much easier.
628.80s:  That is a god honest true story from when I was a little kid. And at that point, it's when I realized
635.28s:  okay, the way we think about things and the language we use absolutely impacts the rest of
642.88s:  our relationship with whatever that thing is. And it's no different here. So
651.20s:  little bit of context is to the you know, back in Eric's archives as to why this kind of thing
656.48s:  matters so much to me. And I think it should matter to you. Let's talk about this
663.28s:  concept however. So now we know that we don't want to refer to it as this stuff will call it
666.96s:  adjusting positions. So when we have to adjust a trade, what are the primary reasons
678.48s:  that we might need to adjust to trade? Now before you start answering in the chat,
682.56s:  I want you to apply organization in the way that we brainstorm this. So I want to start
691.04s:  from guiding concepts, big overarching things, and then we can get into further and further detail.
698.80s:  So with that context, I would love to hear from you in the chat as to what are the circumstances
705.84s:  that might lead us into deciding that we need to adjust one of our traits. We need to adjust
711.52s:  the position starting from a very high level concept. And in the meantime, I'll answer Ben's question.
725.12s:  Ben says maybe you could explain why overall in options this concept exists. Why is it not just
732.48s:  took a loss and now I'm taking another trade? That's a great question. And it's actually one of the
737.60s:  artifacts that's very specific to options is that again, going back to the beginning,
743.20s:  when we adjust a trade, it doesn't actually mean inherently that we're losing.
748.64s:  If you remember, when we look at an options trade, it has multiple profit factors, multiple
756.96s:  things that impact the premium of said option. So let's say, for example, I wanted to sell a put
768.88s:  that is at a 30 delta. So I'm just picking a random expiration. And then I'll get rid of some of
776.48s:  these because we don't need quite as many line items open, 75 should be good.
782.64s:  And let's say I wanted to sell this 30 delta put that's 36 days out. When I sell this put,
791.28s:  it's going to go on with a 33% probability of expiring in the money and a 66% chance of being touched.
802.48s:  Kind of like Bill Cosby. Okay. So with that, if the options markets starts to move
812.08s:  and we see that our 30 delta option is now at a 40 delta, things are going against us.
819.92s:  All of these other subsequent probabilities change. All of the rest of our Greeks change.
827.12s:  So it could be the scenario that we still like the trade, but now we've now gained too much gamma
834.16s:  for what we want in the position and it requires an adjustment. Another example of this,
839.76s:  that's in the concept of losing trade. Another example of this is actually something I've been doing
844.32s:  with all of the levered coverage stringle strategies that I have on right now and ratio call
848.56s:  diagonals because of the way that markets are behaving. If I sell a call, that's a 30 delta.
858.08s:  And then the market moves, let's say 20 points away from where I originally sold that call.
866.16s:  When I sell that call on 30 60, right now, I'm gaining 16 cents of theta per day.
874.40s:  If there's, let's say, again, a 20 point move, so that would make our 579 option look like the 599.
882.16s:  So we'll just use the 598s because they're close and I don't want to add more.
886.48s:  We can see that my theta has now changed. My theta originally was 16 cents.
893.60s:  Now my theta is 7 cents. The trade has moved in my favor in this scenario,
900.40s:  but my daily profit from theta has been cut in half. So this could be another scenario where it's like,
908.48s:  well, I still want to collect a higher theta because that's what fits the overall portfolio.
913.84s:  This is now moved too far away. I need to readjust this position to then continue producing what I
921.04s:  needed to produce in the context of the broader portfolio. So to summarize all of that for Ben,
927.44s:  the reason why this exists in options trading and it can exist in other kinds of trading, by the
932.48s:  way, but the reason why this exists in options trading is because we're dealing with securities
940.00s:  that have a lot of other factors that impact their movement and their behavior.
945.68s:  And very frequently when we put on a position in the beginning, we have a certain idea of the exposure
953.68s:  we want or we should. If you don't, that just means you're a lay trader that's kind of just
960.00s:  seeing how things go, which is not going to work well. For most of the more sophisticated
967.60s:  traders, the Greeks matter a lot, the way that our position is going to behave matters tremendously.
973.84s:  So that's exactly why this world of adjusting is so prevalent in options trading is because
980.16s:  things move a lot and we want to have different methods to maintain the exposure we want.
986.40s:  So now going back to the brainstorming in terms of the scenarios and the context,
992.56s:  as to why we might use the adjusted trade. Let's see what you guys have come up with.
999.36s:  Tommy says underlying price hits soft stops. I'm going to zoom that up. Tommy and I'm essentially
1006.80s:  going to say P and L targets.
1015.52s:  And this again can mean different things. It could mean we just take the whole trade down.
1020.08s:  It could mean that we adjust the position. So this is completely fair to include here.
1025.44s:  Next, travel says what we expect to happen with the trade does not happen or the opposite happens.
1032.80s:  Okay. So I would argue that is partially captured in the P and L targets, but you're onto a very
1041.92s:  important point because when we talk about options, there's a underlying factor that's very unique
1050.48s:  to them in the fact that they expire. So we can have P and L targets that are hit, but we can
1059.04s:  also have a trade. I have no idea what that is. I need to just like reload this.
1070.72s:  I have no idea why what they're okay. Great.
1073.76s:  Awesome. We figured it out. So the other thing here from P and L targets is there's absolutely a
1084.24s:  scenario where our P and L targets might not be hit, but duration. Or good old tit. I'm in trade.
1095.60s:  It requires us to do something. There's another third bucket here, which is the Greek profile.
1108.56s:  Changes. So you'll notice compared to again, the more basic understanding of something like
1117.76s:  adjustments, which is going to rest primarily on the stock is moving against us.
1122.72s:  There's actually quite a few additional circumstances that might be relevant to us to adjust a position.
1128.80s:  And this is kind of like a high-level overview of most of it. There is another one that absolutely
1136.64s:  goes in here, which would be the portfolio fit, which can change. So one of the realities is I
1143.92s:  could have other positions that I'm doing things with, taking them down, adding more, that then
1150.16s:  somehow indirectly impacts what's in this position. So that's absolutely another factor that again
1156.88s:  is important to keep in mind. Now, as always, the reason why I structure it this way in that there
1167.28s:  are these broad buckets is to help organize your thoughts. If we approach this exercise from the
1175.20s:  world of just spitballing all of the conceivable situations that we might adjust a position in,
1182.56s:  this would be chaotic. And it would be very difficult then to even logically process through
1188.40s:  what makes sense. And as you all know, bringing order to chaos where possible is very important when
1195.36s:  you're dealing with really complex systems. So that's exactly why I set it up this way for you.
1200.64s:  So let's start with the subtext around these main things. P&L targets being hit is pretty easy.
1212.72s:  This means that the trade hit our thresholds.
1223.52s:  So then we have to do something. Duration time in trade. This simply means trade,
1230.80s:  didn't. Hit thresholds. In time frame.
1245.12s:  Greek profile changes. This means the original profile changed enough.
1260.88s:  That it impacts our idea.
1271.44s:  More portfolio. So what this means.
1280.80s:  What this means is actually pretty simple. Oh, I can't slide it over. I realize that it was on
1287.76s:  the edge. That's okay. What this means is pretty simple. Over the life cycle of a trade,
1296.72s:  other things can move around with respect to volatility, with respect to time, with respect to
1306.72s:  correlations that then change what the Greeks of our portfolio or positions look like
1315.92s:  that then require us to look at each individual trade and to figure out what makes the most sense
1323.92s:  for that new condition. And again, the reason why this is important is because if you have one
1330.24s:  single trade, T1, not really that big a deal, right? You're going to have your Greeks. They're
1337.76s:  going to be whatever they are. What starts to become more complex is then if you have T2, T3,
1344.08s:  all the way out to T30. Because if all of these individual trades are kind of out there doing
1351.84s:  their thing, living their best lives, and then all of a sudden just for whatever reason, things
1356.56s:  start changing in the broad market, the systematic risk profile changes. Or whatever if you're using
1362.96s:  only one individual kind of strategy, which is a mistake. If that starts to all coalesce together,
1369.04s:  then all of a sudden your entire portfolio can take a completely different risk profile
1373.84s:  than you had originally intended. That's a problem. So monitoring the Greek profile, not just
1381.44s:  obviously for the individual trade, but for the portfolio. That is a lot. And obviously that
1386.16s:  bleeds beautifully into the last one, which is there can be instances where other positions
1393.68s:  require adjustments to trade. So a good example of this. Let's say I have a bunch of 30 delta
1412.08s:  short puts on. I found something new that looks really, really good that I really want to sell
1417.28s:  premium in. And then I looked through the rest of my portfolio and I realized like, man,
1422.24s:  I have a lot of VOMMA right now, big, vague risk. Let me go through my existing positions and see
1428.00s:  if there's anything I can either take down or adjust. Maybe I move the strike out a little bit
1432.56s:  further, something like that to reestablish if it's in profit, whatever the case is. So that then I
1437.76s:  can add this new opportunity without the rest of my portfolio skewing too much because that becomes
1443.92s:  dangerous. So if we're talking about this world of adjusting a trade, these are kind of the broad
1450.32s:  buckets that lead us to then need to adjust a trade. So now what I want to do for the next 10
1457.20s:  minutes or so before we wrap up is I would love to look at a couple examples with you, but I would
1462.88s:  love to source the examples from you. So if there are specific strategies that you like to trade,
1472.56s:  that you're trying to think about scenarios that you might want to adjust, then that's perfect.
1479.28s:  I'd love to grab maybe one or two of them for us to take a look at. I know one of the scenarios
1484.72s:  from the discord. I think Paulo, and I think he might be the one that originally asked the question,
1489.20s:  I'm not positive, but Paulo is saying folding diagonals into calendar, straddles, into narrower,
1501.76s:  or strangles into narrower strangles of straddles, iron condors to butterflies. All those are
1506.72s:  completely viable. I just want to know if there's any specific one that we should focus on because
1513.84s:  the reality is when we're adjusting positions, you're not going to be shocked at all to hear me say
1519.76s:  this, but we should be executing something that's defined ahead of time. So my goal here is to try
1526.72s:  and help give you some equipment to think about how to proceed through deciding how to adjust a
1535.12s:  specific position so that then you can apply the framework to other kinds of things. Ben says,
1540.96s:  I know you don't like credit spreads, but can you adjust credit spreads? Yeah, we can definitely
1545.12s:  talk about that. Thomas says double diagonals on soy. I mean, if we want to talk about double
1550.88s:  diagonals, we can, I think it's less relevant to most people, and then it doesn't, it's completely
1555.04s:  agnostic to the whatever we're trading. Like soy wheat, like, doesn't matter.
1561.36s:  But I think credit spreads is probably way more applicable anyways.
1567.92s:  So let's take a look at what might be able to be done for a credit spread.
1574.72s:  And I think we can close this down. I want to actually look at we'll go into on demand and we'll
1580.08s:  literally look at a trade together. So Ben or anybody else, we'll talk about a vertical spread.
1587.04s:  I assume that's what you mean by a credit spread. For those that don't know, credit spread literally
1591.92s:  just means that you get a credit for putting on the spread. You can have a lot of different kinds
1597.52s:  of structures that yield a credit as a spread. So the connotation I'm assuming from Ben though is
1604.48s:  probably thinking vertical spread. That's what I'm assuming, but I want to confirm first. Ben
1611.92s:  is that correct or did you have a different strategy in mind? Yes. Okay. Got it.
1622.40s:  So that's great. So Ben, let's take a look then and we're going to talk about verticals
1629.68s:  for the sake of a vertical and we can go through this pretty quick so that we can probably hit one
1633.68s:  more. So when we're looking at a vertical spread, Ben, do you want to do something that's
1641.28s:  bullish or bearish? For context, what I'm going to do is find a timeframe in the chart that does
1647.44s:  the opposite of what we want. I'm going to put on different versions of the same trade so that we
1651.52s:  literally can go back in time and then see how they behave and how they perform. So that's really
1658.00s:  the next thing is I just need to know if we're talking about putter call side, put credit spread,
1666.48s:  call credit spread, either of those bullish overalls would be a put credit spread. Great.
1673.28s:  So that's perfect. So let's go to the 28th of Feb, completely good timing here and then we'll
1681.76s:  literally put on a couple different versions and then we'll see what kind of things we might be
1685.60s:  able to do with them. Let's go to 28th, Feb and then this is going to start to load.
1698.56s:  And we'll literally we'll play the scenario out, we'll eyeball it and then hopefully it'll give you
1703.92s:  a little bit of context. Let's get over to the options chain.
1723.60s:  And we'll just apply kind of standard protocols. We'll go out either 21 or 48 days.
1731.36s:  I'm not going to use the weeklies.
1738.24s:  Okay, and then again, we'll just use like standard protocols. So we'll do like a short
1743.04s:  on the 30 delta. So then we'll do a $1 wide.
1751.60s:  Let me get rid of the other ones. So that's a $1 wide, then we will do
1757.20s:  a $2 wide.
1765.20s:  And then we will do a $5 wide.
1773.44s:  And then we will do a $10 wide.
1777.44s:  And then one more, we'll do a $20 wide.
1788.48s:  So what I'm doing right now is I'm giving us multiple versions to look at.
1794.32s:  Now this is a again, like a broader thing to be aware of when you're testing ideas,
1799.52s:  what I'm doing here is very purposeful because by inherently testing multiple ideas in one shot,
1807.60s:  it makes it much more efficient for me because then I can eyeball the difference between all of
1815.20s:  these relatively quickly. And then just get a sense of, okay, well, what what happens here?
1821.44s:  What matters here? That's the whole point. So the first things that I would do if I were like
1830.08s:  testing this more seriously is I would build a little bit of a tracker, which you've all seen
1837.68s:  different versions of this before. So I would start with a date. So the date that we're at in
1844.80s:  the scenarios 28 Feb. And then I'm not going to waste the time to fill it in because it would take a
1849.28s:  while. But what I would do is essentially break it out by the different trades that I would have on.
1856.40s:  So I would have a strike stock price. I would have a strike price.
1864.72s:  I would have all the Greeks Delta Gamma,
1869.52s:  or Gammy, Veda, Vega. And the whole point of this is so that I could monitor how they change
1878.24s:  as things move. It gives me ideas. So that's exactly what I would build. But that aside,
1884.56s:  let's now take a look at these different trades. We know with these different vertical spreads,
1890.24s:  our ultimate preference would be for the stock to go up. So we know that if the stock goes down,
1896.32s:  that's not that's doing what we don't want. So then the next question we would ask ourselves,
1902.40s:  and this is looking at it through the vacuum of just the position. So I purposely used short
1910.00s:  the 570 in all of them so that we only have one short strike to look at in all of these scenarios.
1918.48s:  Again, it's much more efficient. So then for the chat, for the group here, let's brainstorm
1925.84s:  how might we choose to attempt to manage this short but vertical spread? What might we do when?
1937.92s:  So we know that there's absolutely a time component to it. That's for sure.
1943.36s:  And in this case, the passage of time actually helps us. So as time goes, if it's not hitting
1952.16s:  our PNL target, well, doesn't effectively matter that much unless we choose to set some sort of
1959.44s:  early time-based management for whatever reason, which absolutely can be the case.
1966.40s:  If again, our system requires that. So that's something that we could consider.
1972.64s:  What else could we consider? The most obvious one is if the short strike gets breached,
1981.68s:  because here's the reality. Even though that this is a spread, and our risk is going to be defined
1990.40s:  at the onset of the trade, well, there absolutely will be a problem come expiration.
1998.08s:  Because if the short strike is breached and the long isn't, then we have a problem. Now,
2004.88s:  you're still generally going to be okay depending on your broker and how your broker would manage
2009.36s:  that trade for you. But the reality is it absolutely can occur where your short strike is breached,
2015.20s:  you're assigned on the short, and then you still have the long or the long expires. That kind of
2019.84s:  sucks. So we don't really want that scenario. So we'll hone in on that specific circumstance.
2027.60s:  But again, to give you a playbook to work off of, those are some of the other circumstances that
2032.64s:  might matter to us even for something like a vertical spread, where there could be a time-based
2037.44s:  element, where after a certain amount of time in the trade based on our system that we've developed,
2042.56s:  even if it doesn't hit our PNL targets, it could be another spot that we choose to manage the
2047.92s:  trade. But this one we will use when it breaches our short strike of 570. And again, we picked a
2056.80s:  quote unquote favorable time for this example, because we know it happens. I don't know exactly what
2061.68s:  day it happens. We'll figure it out in a sec. And then let's keep going to the six.
2070.40s:  And then I might have picked a bad example, because these might be far enough out of the money.
2078.88s:  There it is, finally. So it happens on the seventh. So now our short strike has been breached.
2089.68s:  And it started a little bit lower than what it was now. So let's actually move us back in time
2096.64s:  closer to the open so that we can be closer to the actual
2105.44s:  let's see what time I don't know what time it settled around that low figured out.
2115.20s:  Let's try 830. There we go. This works. So 0830,
2122.56s:  Pacific time we notice that our short strike has been breached at this point. The entire spread is
2128.08s:  in the money. So now let's take a look at all these different spreads. First, we'll start with the
2132.64s:  dollar wide, the 570 and the 569. This is the trade we're going to look at. We were looking to make
2142.96s:  23 bucks risking 77. Now let's figure out what this trade would look like at this point when it
2150.64s:  finishes buffering. And again, this is the 570, 569. Let's see.
2165.44s:  One of the things that you will notice with something like vertical spreads is your ability to do
2172.08s:  much is actually limited depending on the width. So here the 575, 569 right now the mid price
2180.08s:  is 42 cents and the natural is 34 cents. So our trade here in this context because we sold it
2190.40s:  for 23 cents, our trade here would effectively be trying to buy it to close at 42 cents.
2199.68s:  So the first thing most traders will try to do is just close the whole spread down if they want
2206.64s:  and then you can absolutely look at potentially trying to roll the spread. The issue with trying
2214.64s:  to roll a vertical spread, especially if you try to roll it as a vertical spread is you'll notice
2223.12s:  that there is a big liquidity constraint for two reasons. One, we only have 41 DTE 49 54 70.
2233.04s:  So the next primary expiration is out here 70 days to expiration. The next thing is we now know we
2238.80s:  need to get something that if we got a fill at 42 cents, which notice this is an 8 cent wide
2245.60s:  bit ass spread. So if volatility is going up and if your trade is struggling, let's say that it
2252.80s:  might be more probable for you to get a fill something like 45 cents if things work out appropriately.
2258.96s:  So let's see where I would have to go in order to get a 45 cent wide, but oh shit, what's the next
2267.20s:  thing I notice? What happened to the dollar wide strikes? I see some of them here at the 580,
2276.08s:  but below 580, I don't see dollar wide strikes. So what happened? It's liquidity. The market has an
2284.56s:  opened up dollar wide strikes on these because they're 70 days out. So now that's another hurdle we
2289.68s:  are going to have to figure out. So let's say then our short leg is at the 570 and we say, well,
2295.44s:  we don't want to go any worse than 570. So let's see if we can sell the 570 and get the 565. Well,
2301.36s:  of course you can, but what's now happened is you've increased your risk by $4. We've gone from
2308.56s:  $1 wide to $5 wide. This might not represent the position you want at all. So to summarize the very
2316.40s:  small with vertical spreads is you're going to come into various versions of liquidity constraints.
2323.12s:  That doesn't mean you can't roll, but one of the things, one of the only ways to even
2327.76s:  stand a chance at trying to roll a vertical spread, especially during volatile periods is by
2332.88s:  adjusting the individual legs. And that opens up different risks depending on the order that you
2338.56s:  adjust the legs. So to summarize all of that with something like a vertical spread, the overwhelming
2345.12s:  stance of sophisticated traders, including myself, that would trade a vertical spread, especially
2350.72s:  narrower, like five points and in is you just, it's just a directional hypothesis. And it's either
2358.00s:  going to be right or wrong. That doesn't mean that you can't take it down early for a loss.
2362.48s:  If something moves against you big and you think it's going to stay down there, it doesn't
2367.04s:  mean that you have to sit there and wait, but it does mean I'm not going to try to roll it.
2371.28s:  That is the exact kind of scenario where I would just close that trade. And then if my idea is
2376.00s:  still appropriate, sure, I can go open a new one, but to try to pair those as a rolling order,
2383.12s:  really, really, really challenging, very challenging. The probability of getting filled at anything
2387.68s:  even remotely favorable is about zero. In fact, it's not going to happen. So that's one scenario.
2394.24s:  Now what I was just alluding to opens us up to discuss the second scenario, which is one of
2401.20s:  these wider verticals. So let's take a look at this 20 point wide vertical. In this 20 point wide
2409.92s:  vertical that we first put on, our true intention is probably not using the 50 as a risk management.
2420.72s:  The probability of somebody trading this kind of vertical, the 57550, this is way more likely to be
2427.12s:  somebody that's just using the wing for margin management, right? Because if you have a smaller
2433.12s:  account and you want to just sell the 570, that's really expensive. But if you can see that in this
2439.36s:  case where we're 20 points wide, it's only asking for 2 grand. And it's limited to that 2 grand,
2444.96s:  which is kind of nice, you know, again, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. So my broader
2449.36s:  point here is that the person who's trading this is much likely to be somebody that's trading this
2453.76s:  as a vertical in the traditional sense and more so probably adding the wing and treating that short
2459.84s:  put as a naked short put. Okay, fine. So what changes in this context, not much, but the difference is
2467.92s:  that this again, the context of trying to leg around this, I think going to happen, meaning to
2476.08s:  trade this as a vertical spread and then hit create a rolling order where it's going to try to close
2482.08s:  this one and open a new one in the same order stream. It's not going to happen. So what you can do
2488.00s:  in this kind of scenario is absolutely manage the trade by rolling it again in line with whatever
2495.60s:  your approach is, but you would have to do it in individual legs. So then it opens the question,
2501.04s:  what is the order of legs that makes the most sense? It's always going to be managing the short
2507.36s:  option first. Because what's very dangerous is if I choose to close my long option first and then
2516.96s:  or whatever reason at that moment before I have a chance to get the new long on something happens
2525.20s:  for whatever reason, you now have an undefined risk trade on and your broker again, if you don't
2532.00s:  have the money for it, they might not even allow it. They might say that you can't close this
2536.16s:  individual leg because you would exceed the margin required for the position. So the way to manage
2542.72s:  something like this is is pretty easy. Normally what we would do is close out the 570. So close out
2552.56s:  that put. You can leave this long put on if you're so inclined until you finish the roll. Don't
2557.68s:  have to. You can close the 570 and then you can close the 550 or you can just close this as an
2566.24s:  entire vertical and then open up a new one. Now if you're trying to get an optimal fill and if you're
2572.72s:  trying to play spreads, what you can do is close the 570, go roll out in meaning figure out we're
2579.44s:  going to go with that 570, make that adjustment while keeping that 550 on because your risk is still
2585.84s:  managed in this context and then you can add the other leg once you complete that then close this
2592.48s:  residual long leg. It kind of adds complexity for no reason for most people. The easiest way to
2597.84s:  adjust something like this is to leg out of it and then put a new one on. So when we're trading
2603.44s:  verticals more often than not, the concept here is essentially just leave it alone.
2610.48s:  Now Elizabeth opens up another really great question which is roll the untested side.
2616.16s:  Rolling the untested side occurs differently from verticals and that will happen in this context. Let
2623.68s:  me get rid of these. And then let's go back like we did to 28 beb for the same scenario and then
2633.20s:  I got to open the door for a throat real quick.
2648.16s:  Okay. So it looks like it's still hitting me with a buffer.
2656.88s:  All right. So now let's take a look at what this roll the untested side means. Let's say that we
2672.16s:  were selling strangles. I do this all the time. We have 19 delta there and because of all the skew,
2682.00s:  we have to go super far out of the money on the call side to get to these.
2687.28s:  And then 19 delta here. So here's the trade that we have on.
2698.00s:  And from a margin requirement, this asks for 15k effectively. So now let's fast forward time again
2705.92s:  because we know this goes against us, which is convenient. And we have the 545 and the 623.
2713.36s:  I don't know if it gets bad in either of these technically, but that's okay.
2719.84s:  Because we'll take a look at the change in the delta.
2729.44s:  It's buffering right now.
2730.80s:  So here's what's happened. In this scenario, we started where both legs were a 19 delta.
2741.44s:  If we take a look now, our short puts have moved up to a 30 delta. They're not quite challenged
2748.64s:  yet technically, typically speaking when we're referring to challenge, it would be when they're
2752.24s:  like at the money. But this still is that side being tested. And the rolling of the untested side
2760.16s:  is actually what I was talking to you before in the context of the covered strangle.
2765.60s:  Remember how I told you for the covered strangle. I'm in the process of rolling in the money short
2770.48s:  puts out and down trying to adjust those. And I'm rolling the calls closer at the money. That's
2777.84s:  rolling the untested side. So in this context, tested refers to whichever leg is being challenged
2784.16s:  by the market of a short option. So in this case, it would be the put side. And then the untested
2790.72s:  side in this case is the call side. And effectively, what we're saying, if this is a short strangle,
2797.60s:  well, here's what's happening. That's really dangerous. These are gaining way more
2804.96s:  deltas. And the puts and the call side is losing deltas. So normally, if we're trading something
2813.68s:  like a short strangle and we want to keep it more balanced and to try to actually isolate volatility,
2821.04s:  what that means is as this starts to move and this is now a 30 delta, what does that mean for
2828.96s:  our position? Well, it means that if the underlying moves down, we lose 30 cents here. How much would
2838.24s:  we gain from the corresponding call side? We gain nine. Not a great trade off. Pretty shitty. It feeds
2847.04s:  the purpose. Now, the benefit here is that if it moves in our favor, meaning the price goes up,
2853.52s:  we gain 30 cents and we only lose nine. But what's the difference here? We've effectively taken
2858.64s:  a strategy that was designed to be neutral and it has a very clear directional tilt at this point.
2864.56s:  This trade wants the market to go up. It needs the market to go up if it continued to move either
2871.68s:  direction. So the idea of rolling the untested side is to rebalance the position. So I originally
2879.68s:  put this trade on 19 delta on the short side on the calls and puts 19 short delta 19 long delta
2887.68s:  they balance each other out. So that means that if it moves in either direction, I don't have big
2893.36s:  directional risk. Now I do. So to fix that, I can say, I'm going to take in these 623s. I would take
2900.64s:  them in at a profit because they will be making money. The calls will be cheaper than what I sold
2906.56s:  them for and I might take them all the way into a 30 delta here and I can take them to the 596s.
2913.52s:  So now what I've effectively done is rebalance the deltas. This is rolling the untested side.
2920.48s:  Now, you can roll the untested side for a bunch of different reasons. It really depends on
2926.32s:  the purpose of the position. In this context, I'm showing you rolling the untested side to rebalance
2932.56s:  your deltas. For the context of a covered strangle, I'm not really trying to rebalance my deltas.
2938.40s:  I don't care. It's just the fact that the underlying is moving down and I can make more money with
2942.96s:  the short calls by continuing to move them down with the underlying. So in the context of a
2947.92s:  covered strangle, it's not really to rebalance the deltas as to follow the move. But the concept is
2953.84s:  we're adjusting the side of the trade that effectively is in profit and it's to regain
2961.20s:  sensitivity to the rest of the Greeks. Elizabeth, does that make sense? Do you have any follow-up
2970.08s:  questions for that? And then I will pivot to Pallos in a sec. But I want to make sure
2980.96s:  Elizabeth years is good. The coconut pineapple bubbly is pretty solid. He'll be H.
2991.76s:  Elizabeth says, make sense. Need to write that down. Yeah. If I were to write it down, I would
2995.84s:  essentially phrase it as when I have a position. I mean, you can even roll an untested option. It
3004.40s:  would be not referred to as the untested side. When we say the tested versus untested side,
3009.84s:  that infers that there's a spread of some sort. But you really can adjust the untested option
3018.40s:  at any point. So you can have just a short call. And then the market can move in your favor,
3023.68s:  meaning it's untested and you can choose to rebalance it. So the way I would think about it is
3028.72s:  essentially adjusting an option where it's moved in my favor. And I want to regain a certain Greek
3038.24s:  profile. Cool. So Pallos says, I'm most puzzled by diagonals to calendars. When is this
3048.88s:  tactic worthwhile? Pallos, do you have an example of a trade that you would like to look at together?
3056.56s:  And then happy to explore it with you. If you don't, we can talk about it in a theoretical
3063.36s:  concept. But if you have a specific trade or a specific version of the strategy, that would be
3070.48s:  ideal for me. Because as you know, I do my best to make the stuff that we review during the
3078.40s:  streams more relevant to you, the individual. That's kind of the fun part, I think at least.
3085.52s:  And then if not, like I said, happy to just build one. Okay, so Pallos says, oracle, let's do that.
3096.64s:  And when.
3101.84s:  Pallo, when did you put the trade on just so I can go to that day? If you put it on recently,
3107.04s:  that's fine. With on demand, we essentially are blacked out for the last nine trading days.
3115.36s:  So if it's in the last nine trading days, then I'll just pick another time, go as close as I can to it.
3120.64s:  And then I see.
3137.44s:  Just before earnings. Okay, when did they have earnings? Well, they like just had earnings.
3142.56s:  Yeah, okay. So just before what had been on the 10th, I think the furthest we can go back.
3157.68s:  I mean, that's pretty good. That's super close. But I think this is fine, actually. We just won't
3164.24s:  be able to fast forward, which is okay. Crunch this down. And you're talking about when it went
3172.16s:  to 140 them back to 150. So it had a 10 point move. 65, 53.
3193.52s:  Okay, so let's just even eyeball the trade as it sits. So you had the march.
3202.72s:  28th. And then the March 14th. So two got it. So the March 28th, you had the 150s.
3219.12s:  Is on the put side. And then did you put it on for a credit or a debit? I'm assuming you bought it.
3232.80s:  Around five March. I know that this one isn't your trade, but I'll fix it to be what we want.
3242.48s:  I just want to know what leg you did what with if you bought or sold.
3251.52s:  Now for those that don't know when you're looking at things like diagonals,
3255.92s:  well, there's a couple different ways to look at them. Calendar spread is effectively when you're
3261.04s:  seeing strike different explorations. Diagnals is when you combine a vertical move and a horizontal
3268.08s:  move, get it diagonal move. So it's when you're in different explorations, but then you're also
3272.96s:  at different strikes. So I'm waiting to see what Apollo put the diagonal on for if you sold
3283.84s:  the back or bought the back, which will effectively say whether this goes on for a credit or a debit
3290.88s:  debit. Yeah, okay. So you paid, which is super common. So what that means is he's long the 150s
3298.80s:  and 28 March. And then in 14 March here, he is short. It looks like the 140s.
3309.92s:  So let me see if I have this. No, I flipped them. My bad. My bad. This is 28. So it's this one.
3321.36s:  28 at the 150. And then this one is the 14th at 140. So then this effectively will go on for a
3335.92s:  debit. The reason why this is the case is we're buying a more expensive further out in time option.
3344.24s:  And then we are selling a cheaper near dated option. So this is what the diagonal will look like in
3353.12s:  this context. So now what what Apollo is talking about is turning it into a calendar. And there are
3362.32s:  two ways we can turn it into a calendar. We can either roll the further dated option or we can
3371.44s:  roll the near dated option. And the defense quote unquote really depends on the way that it moves
3380.16s:  and what we're trying to accomplish. And we can just kind of think through logically what might
3385.76s:  happen in the scenario. So if we go back to analyze and let's say the stock does move.
3393.76s:  And let's say the stock right now is at 148 in the scenario. And what did Oracle do? You said it
3401.76s:  went down and then back up. So let's say Oracle goes down. You said it went down to like 140,
3407.60s:  which would be like near max profit. Something like that. And then it went up to 150. So if we're
3415.76s:  in this scenario where the option that's further out in time is doing most of the work and the option
3424.08s:  that's nearer in time is doing less of the work. Right. Like think about what adjustment might make
3429.36s:  sense. In this case, we sold the 140 put. It's now trading down towards 140. Would we in any scenario
3441.04s:  want us to roll that put up to the 150? Probably not. Could do it, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.
3449.92s:  So then we could choose to roll the long option that's further out in time down. Now would that
3458.08s:  make sense in this context? Again, probably not. The main reason being is because unless you have a
3464.80s:  longer term game plan for the strategy. If it's sitting at your max profit, which effectively
3470.24s:  this is, then that's actually getting closer to what I would consider to be your P&L management
3475.04s:  approach. So in this context, I don't really think it makes a lot of sense to roll either of them.
3482.16s:  Now in the world where why we might choose to do that, let's take a look at the Greeks.
3490.40s:  So we can see that right now the 150s that are 18 days to expiration, they have effectively a 50 delta
3500.48s:  2 gamma 24 theta that we're losing and 14 Vega. So then if we wanted to convert this into a calendar,
3513.52s:  we would then need to share the same strike, which may or may not make sense. One of the more common
3520.16s:  instances I would see this convert into a calendar is actually if we're moving this short put
3529.44s:  to roll it out in time. And then we might hit the same strike, but still not super frequently.
3536.64s:  And it's because I wouldn't want to roll the short put all the way up into something that's at the
3541.92s:  money if it's trading at 150, I would want to roll it down. So then what's the context on what happens
3548.24s:  to the long option that's out in 28 March? Well, if we take this 150 and we roll it down, what does
3555.36s:  that do? Well, it decreases our short delta, it decreases our gamma, decreases our theta,
3565.76s:  and decreases our Vega. It essentially desensitizes literally all of the Greeks. So why might we do that
3575.12s:  if we want something to move slower or whatever reason? So the process of converting,
3582.32s:  and I wouldn't even view it personally, I think it's too constraining to view it as like converting
3589.60s:  a diagonal into a calendar. It's kind of myopic. I would just view it as adjusting the further
3599.68s:  dated leg and the shorter dated leg to whatever strikes make sense for your idea. So
3606.80s:  whenever we're talking about the adjusting of options, it's important not to get wrapped up in
3614.40s:  what the structure might be called, it doesn't really matter. What matters is does the position reflect
3621.76s:  the position we want to have? And that can be the position for the specific trade that we have on,
3627.68s:  or it can be the position that fits with the portfolio better.
3631.20s:  So, Paulo, in your case in this scenario, I don't really see a scenario where I personally would
3642.80s:  want to turn this into a calendar. Now, the scenario that might be more appropriate for a calendar
3651.52s:  is if you put it on for a credit and you're adjusting the further out in time option,
3658.96s:  that can make sense. And what that means is if we flip this like we were talking about before,
3666.88s:  and let's say that we close this, I'm just going to have it by the diagonal. And in this case,
3678.88s:  I don't want to, yeah, this is fine. So in this case, what's happening is we're going to be
3685.60s:  long the 4 April 145 and then short the 28 March 25. So you can have this configured a few
3697.44s:  different ways, but we can have this where we're actually short the further dated option and then
3705.68s:  long the near dated option. So in this kind of trade, it changes things a bit. And the reason why
3714.64s:  changes things for a bit is because let's say Oracle does indeed start rallying down. And let's say
3722.08s:  our short option that's out in 145, something like that. Let's say that that first starts getting
3730.56s:  challenged, but then all of a sudden, it starts rallying the other direction. We might want to pace
3738.64s:  the short put and move it up to the 150 to follow that price movement to capture as much as we can.
3745.36s:  Kind of a different method to adjust it, but again, very similar to verticals, very infrequently
3753.20s:  does in my opinion, it make a bunch of sense to adjust diagonals in this way. It's primarily
3763.92s:  the way I would think about it specifically managing a diagonal into a calendar. It's like very
3770.08s:  specific. I would think of it way more as just adjusting the individual legs to get the exposure
3775.60s:  that I want. My ratio call diagonals, for example, I manage the long legs differently than the short
3783.60s:  legs and I manage the short legs pretty actively, but I'm not like trying to turn it into a calendar
3790.08s:  anything specific. I'm just trying to make the trade look however I want. So key takeaway there
3797.28s:  and broader recommendation when we think about this stuff is like don't constrain the
3803.12s:  positional adjustments to names. And again, I know that that's not the real question that's
3808.24s:  being asked, you know, diagonal to calendar, but again, like that's the subtext that comes through.
3813.04s:  There's nothing wrong with adjusting either leg one strike and keeping it as a diagonal if that
3821.28s:  better reflects your idea. So there are scenarios however we're adjusting the individual legs can make
3827.92s:  sense. Most of those instances are going to be following profit movements and it's typically going
3833.52s:  to be done more so on the short leg, just in the long leg absolutely can be done, but the short leg,
3841.36s:  if something's moving in your favor, typically the long leg is going to continue to gain more
3847.28s:  deltas, which is what you want. And the short leg is going to potentially gain or lose deltas
3852.48s:  again depending on which way it goes, but if it goes in your favor, considering the short leg,
3857.84s:  you start losing deltas and a lot of times you'll want those back for the broader position.
3864.16s:  So to recap what we talked about in the context of defending positions,
3872.32s:  I like to view it way more as simply adjusting positions and the way that I mentally think about it
3879.60s:  is always just getting the position to reflect the risk that I want to have on. That's the ultimate
3888.16s:  objective. That's the entire purpose of any of these adjustment style strategies where the original
3895.44s:  risk profile of our trade looked one way, then as the market moved, it then looked differently.
3900.80s:  And we want it to look more reflective of again, whatever the idea is that we have. So any questions
3911.04s:  on any of that, anything else that you guys want to hit? I have a couple minutes. So if we want to
3915.44s:  talk about the markets really fast, let me know. I can take a look at any individual tickers
3920.64s:  quickly. I know that we're at an hour, but my dinner's not going to be here for a little bit, and
3926.24s:  I already pretty much did the work I need to do for the broader videos. I already have most of the
3932.64s:  videos queued up, which is awesome, meaning for when I'm traveling next month to Ireland.
3939.52s:  So that this way you guys will still get material while I'm out,
3946.40s:  for all looking with the leprechauns. I will report back if I find a leprechaun. I'm eager to see if I
3955.76s:  can get my eyeballs on one. Feel like there's got to be at least one in like a costume.
3960.40s:  I hope at least.
3965.52s:  South Korea to prepare measures on US steel tariffs and march. Interesting.
3974.32s:  Bay areas, can you take a look at Palantir? What are your expectations for the potential
3978.80s:  news-based event, Marley? Yeah, take a look. I have a position on Palantir.
3984.08s:  So, first things first, Palantir has had pretty mellow moves. The average move using a rolling 20-day
3995.60s:  window is like three quarters of a standard deviation, which is actually a little bit lighter than
4001.52s:  what it should be, which is interesting. Now, today Palantir rallied a bit up 7%.
4012.08s:  And this was for a couple reasons. I don't know if you guys saw, but there was new news that came out
4017.28s:  that I think it was last night, actually. The news came out that there was another contract that
4023.28s:  Palantir was being targeted for. Let's see if that news came out yesterday. No.
4037.36s:  I don't see that news here. I'm curious when the
4041.12s:  news came out. One sec.
4051.52s:  I'm just wondering what actual time that news came out, because I remember seeing it.
4064.08s:  Let's see if this cup would have been in the evening. Here we go.
4067.44s:  No.
4076.00s:  Here we go.
4077.12s:  ApeCon and Defense Deals be the combat catalyst.
4083.52s:  No. It's not the main one. There was literally just...
4091.84s:  Maybe I don't remember. There was a specific article. I literally remember reading it on my phone
4096.88s:  about a new contract that somebody was going to open with Palantir. I don't remember.
4103.76s:  But anyways, that part of side, I think Palantir itself is still pretty well positioned. Let's
4112.16s:  take a look at what the options chain are telling us. No, that's not right.
4119.04s:  2.1 mil against 1.4 on the call side. If we take a look at the vol for tomorrow,
4125.84s:  for 21 March, it's 95% for this front expiration. It's 113.
4131.76s:  Definitely pricing in pretty heavy vol for the rest of this week. Let's take a look at
4138.48s:  what this week is showing us for options. It's effectively two times almost.
4144.00s:  Pulse to puts. That generally would lead us to believe that the market is positioning and
4151.12s:  positioning itself for an upside move. That's the broad note. Let's see if there's anything else we
4158.48s:  can uncover quickly. Deal to your. What I'm doing now is I want to get a sense of, yeah, so like this
4170.16s:  is people positioning today. What I'm doing is I'm looking at the net call premium in how that
4177.20s:  reflects sentiment. This is obviously a lot of people unwinding. But the interesting thing here
4185.36s:  is if you take a look at the overall activity today, it's definitely bullish leaning and this
4192.16s:  is going to be positioning primarily for tomorrow. Now, let's take a look at the near term.
4198.88s:  Pulse here. Let's take a look at
4211.20s:  plus seven days. And then what I want to do is actually look at this specific expiration
4220.72s:  for this Friday. Yeah, look at this. Two million at the 75s.
4232.48s:  1.2 at the 75s. These are interesting. These being so tight in. What is this part of?
4250.56s:  Yeah, this looks like a hybrid of stuff tied to the 86s because it would be a strange
4259.36s:  spread for the 86s to be tied to the 75s. Let's see.
4280.24s:  This is like impossible to tell. So this one's really, really hard to tell.
4290.00s:  This could be short, the 75s and then long these, but it looks the inverse where the 75s came in
4299.68s:  at 1003 much closer, not much, but a little bit closer to the offer. So it looks like they might
4309.44s:  be thinking that this could be a cost spread, 2000 contracts each.
4320.00s:  So it does look somewhat generally bullish positioning.
4328.24s:  Take a look at the volume for today. And then let's take a look at the volume for the 14 March
4334.56s:  189. Let's see.
4353.60s:  How do people take in general shots as you would expect?
4359.44s:  Super active.
4369.04s:  Yeah, this looks like a general makes back, but in general, what I can loosely identify
4376.08s:  is slightly more favorable bullish side positioning for the expectation on tomorrow.
4382.48s:  Call side looks like a higher probability of a downside move, but more upside severity.
4392.48s:  But what's interesting is I'm looking at it is for the near strikes, it's actually lower
4402.08s:  on the call side. So what do we have? 85? Let's go 10 points wide. 103.
4408.08s:  Yes, so it's actually favoring that's fascinating. So it's favoring a higher probability of a smaller
4417.04s:  up move with a slightly higher severity of a downside move, but then it becomes overwhelmed
4424.40s:  to the upside. So what this means is it's a higher probability of a small upside move with the
4430.08s:  moderate probability of a slightly larger downside move with a low probability of a really big
4435.28s:  upside move. That's what all of that means. I hope that makes sense. Interesting.
4446.48s:  Scott says GME and earnings call later this month. Yeah, boy.
4452.40s:  I owe you guys a video on GameStop. So I'll do a literally wrap this up and then I'll take a
4457.28s:  look at that. Base says new contracts with Heineken and Walgreens potentially more for
4464.56s:  to be announced tomorrow allegedly. I saw I got to figure out what the fucking news I saw yesterday,
4469.20s:  but I saw something about maybe no, it wasn't lunar. I figured out, but there was also there was
4474.96s:  literally news. I saw come out last night that talked about a couple couple new things. Ben says
4480.40s:  you mentioned these smaller medium companies with weird option activity. Would you say it's a valid
4484.48s:  path to chase? Who would you say no? I mean, it's definitely valid. Is that the best return on time
4489.76s:  for a newer trader? I would argue absolutely not because it's one of the more nuanced places
4495.76s:  to try to do anything. I think the better time spent for a newer option trader is to get good market
4502.96s:  fundamentals down, which is essentially finding ways to optimize beta return. I think it's a great
4510.24s:  starting point. And then once you get through optimizing beta and you have like a good core approach
4516.08s:  that generally is sustainable and makes money, then it's okay to venture off into the weeds and
4523.04s:  take a look at all these other random approaches, but I think it just becomes more difficult to
4527.68s:  rationalize. But I'm going to hop off so I can make this game stop video because I owe it to
4532.32s:  everybody and there's a couple adjustments. If you guys need anything, let me know Friday is our
4537.68s:  second to last options trading basic stream. So don't miss that. We're going to be talking about
4543.20s:  managing a portfolio. Be an outlier. See you later.
