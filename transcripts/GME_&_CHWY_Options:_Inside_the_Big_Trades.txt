0.64s: what's up everyone taking a look at
2.56s: GameStop today there was a pretty
3.88s: interesting trade that I want to go over
6.00s: with you as well as an update on the
7.48s: options chain because I do see a shift
10.00s: going on and then I also want to address
12.24s: some comments yesterday from the chewy
14.16s: video where people were seeing
15.36s: interesting activity in those options
16.84s: chains I actually collated data from the
19.24s: entire month for us to take a look
21.40s: through together in a spreadsheet the
23.44s: overall goal here is to share
25.08s: information stuff that you guys can
26.72s: learn how to analyze things a little bit
28.40s: better maybe structure a little bit
30.48s: smarter which we'll talk about that as
31.80s: well so let's dig right in first things
34.20s: first I think we need to pour one out a
36.72s: moment of silence for all of our homies
39.44s: out here at the 128 call 67,341 expired
45.68s: worthless difficult trade super far out
47.84s: of the money very low probability trade
49.92s: this goes back to something I talked
51.36s: about most of the week as I saw people
53.40s: piling into these very low probability
56.68s: trade so I know a lot of people are
58.56s: looking kind of for those Lotto style
60.40s: plays that's a tough way to make money
62.36s: in this business long term which is what
64.72s: I'm concerned with I've been doing this
66.24s: for over 16 years now consistency and
68.76s: making money long term is important now
72.56s: I understand every once in a while you
73.76s: might want to take a shot see if you can
75.32s: hit one out of the park so that's kind
77.72s: of the concept of the video I've been
79.20s: citing and I'll link it below again
81.56s: about buying options smarter there's
83.48s: nothing wrong with taking a shot looking
85.72s: for a lower probability higher payout
88.28s: trade kind of asymmetric profile
90.68s: but if that's the only thing you're
92.32s: doing it's very difficult to make money
94.96s: so what happened today well a few things
97.96s: one of them that was very interesting
100.16s: was this trade right here at
102.76s: 0744 Pacific time for today's expiration
106.48s: somebody transacted 496 of the 11 calls
110.28s: this is an interesting trade because it
112.92s: landed towards the center of the bid ask
115.52s: spread a little bit closer though to the
119.00s: ask so I'm thinking that these are buys
122.44s: not just for that reason but also on the
124.84s: dynamic of the transaction what does
127.00s: that mean well if you're selling options
130.28s: and let's say he has this the shares and
132.88s: he wants to sell the calls against the
134.40s: shares typically you want to do that to
136.28s: capture some time value there's
137.80s: essentially none of that left in here
139.56s: there's so far in the money with zero
142.00s: DTE so I don't think that they're trying
144.48s: to do that I think that this was a
147.56s: method to buy shares that's my best
149.64s: guess they pay a little bit of a premium
151.56s: to do it via options but they have the
153.24s: benefit of getting it at a certain
155.32s: strike they don't have to fight the
157.28s: market trying to fill a position of this
159.00s: size because this is a pretty big trade
162.64s: the premium of the position is over
165.24s: $700,000 by itself these are very very
167.56s: deep in the money so that's my best
169.80s: guess this was somebody looking to enter
172.40s: in Via shares so we'll have to see how
175.20s: this one goes because it wouldn't
176.44s: surprise me to see a pretty decent flood
178.88s: then of short calls of people trying to
181.40s: capture capitalize and capture the
184.52s: elevated volatility as much as there is
186.80s: left and this is a pretty sizable
189.88s: position to do so this is again 496
193.40s: contracts each worth 100 shares that's
196.40s: my guess and if we take a look again at
198.96s: the options chain the vast majority of
201.24s: the volume at this strike is that person
203.44s: it's not like they got in got out my
205.80s: guess is they were looking to onboard
207.64s: shares so interesting trade though not
210.52s: anything else in here that stuck out too
212.60s: much it did look like aggregate buying
215.52s: activity though and it's essentially
217.60s: across expiration Cycles but as you will
220.72s: typically note The Lion's Share of it is
223.64s: going to be in the standard expiration
226.04s: Cycles so if you'll take a look at the
227.88s: 19 July the larger value trades that
231.92s: were bought there vastly larger than
234.88s: everything El everything else except
237.12s: this one today occurred here and I've
240.28s: explained that before it's essentially
241.80s: for liquidity you're going to get way
243.36s: more liquidity going to a standard
245.32s: expiration cycle as compared to the
247.00s: weeklys so it's very very common to see
250.00s: that movement now if we take a look down
252.80s: here at open interest there's about a
254.76s: million calls to 575,000
257.92s: puts and if we see where those are
260.44s: centralized it's in this front
262.24s: expiration with
263.48s: 350,000 calls and
266.16s: 130,000 puts so we're seeing a lot of
269.52s: this activity fall off the majority of
272.16s: it is going to fall off at least in
273.84s: terms of what's centralized in any one
275.60s: expiration cycle so once these 350 come
278.48s: out of the 1 million still obviously
281.12s: there will be 650,000 or so and that's
284.16s: kind of spread out pretty massively
286.00s: except the next large expiration cycle
288.92s: is this 19 July 217,000 calls 131,000
293.48s: puts and this is kind of standard for
296.72s: what I'm noticing the activity here in
298.84s: GameStop it's almost like in Futures
301.00s: where the front expiration is hands down
302.88s: the busiest and then we start to see a
305.04s: little bit movement into the next
307.08s: expiration cycle the very next one as we
308.80s: get closer there's a benefit to that you
311.40s: based on the style of the positions
314.00s: You're Building you will be a little
315.84s: more sensitive to spot price changes
319.20s: however the downside to this is you kind
321.72s: of lose a lot of money if it doesn't
323.24s: move in your favor in that time frame
324.76s: this again goes back to that other video
326.20s: I was referencing and the benefit of
328.16s: establishing positions that are a little
329.48s: bit further out maybe a little bit more
331.60s: expensive to get into overall but it
333.56s: gives the position some time to work all
335.92s: right the last thing I want to talk
337.44s: about is volume the vast majority of the
340.92s: volume today still over 200,000 but the
343.44s: vast majority was in the near expiration
346.44s: so again if we clear out that 341,000 we
349.48s: take a look at today it was 175,000 over
351.48s: half of it was in this front expiration
353.84s: so we are seeing a bit of a shift out
356.08s: into this 19 July there's
358.04s: 35,000 calls there there 12,000 that's
361.36s: it out in 16 August now I do find this
364.32s: part interesting where in the five July
366.20s: there's 86,000 calls that is a little
370.32s: bit anomalous especially compared to
372.48s: kind of standard open interest you'll
374.64s: see that the five July have 109k against
377.64s: the 19 July 217 so this is a lot of
380.52s: people just just moving out one week
382.72s: just trying to keep keep the dream alive
385.60s: if you take a look at the volatility
387.84s: 227% IV for today and then next week
391.12s: it's only 111 then it jumps back up into
394.64s: the 120s why is that well it's a short
397.00s: week next week we have July 4th happy
399.40s: birthday America coming up so it's a one
402.48s: less trading day that drastically will
404.84s: impact volatility typically and I think
407.00s: that's why this is the case here so the
409.20s: probability of seeing some sort of
410.56s: really massive move is not being priced
412.40s: into the options now I know that that
414.84s: conflicts with some other ideas that are
416.84s: floating around in terms of the
418.92s: different
420.16s: Cycles but right now the markets aren't
423.16s: seeing that so in GameStop long story
426.84s: short it looks like we're seeing a bit
428.60s: of flattening we are seeing still more
431.08s: calls transacting to puts we're seeing
433.28s: massive movement from this front
434.96s: expiration no surprise out into the very
437.80s: next expiration with still 19th July
442.60s: being the next largest expiration that
446.32s: is kind of topical for us so that's what
449.24s: I'm seeing in here so far as always if
451.16s: there's any questions or anything that
452.24s: you want me to dive into let me know now
454.64s: let us pivot over quickly to chewy so I
457.80s: took a look through the options chain
459.92s: and there's some
462.20s: interesting I don't know there's some
464.24s: interesting movement but nothing that
466.32s: I'm really falling over myself about I
469.80s: do think a few things though so if we
472.24s: take a look at the open interest you'll
473.60s: notice that these are much closer than
475.44s: what you typically see in something like
476.80s: gme which is way more call skew chewy
480.04s: right now is at 383k calls against 295k
484.04s: puts still call skew but nowhere near to
487.68s: the same degree that you're seeing in
489.40s: something like GameStop and if we take a
491.52s: look at the volume for today it's much
494.20s: quieter so 158k against 79k so nothing
498.48s: too crazy I want to show you this so
501.60s: this is where essentially I collated
503.88s: data from the entire month it's kind of
505.72s: unwieldy and the strike prices are
507.68s: really weird because of the way that you
508.96s: have to pull data so you kind of just
510.96s: have to learn how to read this a little
512.56s: bit it's not the simplest but I'll walk
514.08s: you through it because there's only a
515.16s: couple things that actually look very
516.72s: interesting to me here now in an
519.60s: aggregation p uh in an aggregation lens
523.48s: looking at these here the 30 calls that
526.68s: are expiring the 19th of July there's
530.64s: 18,6 79 of those that's a pretty big
533.64s: centralization at that strike price I
536.48s: also see it at the 35s in the same
539.04s: expiration
540.16s: I also see it at the 37 halfs and also
542.80s: at the 45s so this expiration is
545.68s: actually pretty hot and if you take a
547.96s: look at the overall volume for this
551.16s: expiration compared to the others for
552.56s: the entire month it's much much higher
554.88s: so yeah 19th of July is interesting now
558.96s: if we go through kind of individual
560.72s: trade data here we can sort and what I
564.88s: want to do is as soon as I sort this by
567.12s: the way it's going to destroy this table
568.48s: don't worry about that
570.04s: but we want to get rid of everything
571.72s: except for long calls in this case to
573.48s: see where we can see bigger trades going
575.32s: on and then what we can do is sort by
579.92s: value and see where the bigger trades
582.36s: are and there are quite a few of them
585.92s: and again a lot of them are in 19th July
588.44s: let's actually take a look at that
590.16s: expiration specifically here and see
593.44s: what's going on there's a bunch of them
595.44s: again I didn't I wasn't as strict in
597.64s: terms of what I would consider a large
599.40s: trade I included a lot in the 200s which
601.32s: I typically wouldn't bother with but I
603.80s: thought it was interesting nonetheless
605.12s: to take a peek at so if we take a look
607.08s: at the sizes here there are some really
609.20s: big trades so we do have a couple of
612.52s: these several thousand lot positions
616.64s: that are worth quite a lot of money so
619.92s: these are definitely coming in at the
622.08s: current offer so these are buying these
624.24s: calls the 35s the 35s and these this is
627.08s: like a million A5 dollar position this
629.60s: right here is combined just a super big
633.56s: position in the same expiration slightly
636.36s: different execution times on these but
639.72s: still big big positions and there's a
642.60s: handful of these that size up pretty
644.96s: pretty quickly so if we sort this by
648.32s: some of the larger positions some people
650.64s: were talking about these 5,000 contract
653.28s: blocks and there were a few of them in a
655.28s: couple different expirations but there
657.12s: also is one of them here the main thing
659.44s: I'm trying to highlight is there's a
661.20s: pretty meaningful inflow of call volume
665.84s: at not insignificant prices again I
669.24s: typically prefer to sort this by value
671.16s: so that you can really see where the
672.44s: larger players are at which is what I
674.12s: would consider this section here and you
676.48s: can see that there's some entries
678.40s: across different days phasing into
681.80s: positions but this is very much
684.00s: centralized in the 30 strike and the 35
686.68s: strike hands down so if we slide this
690.00s: out of the way we come into chewy we go
691.84s: out here again to the next primary
693.64s: expiration 19 July and we take a look at
696.28s: these we have the 30s which are becoming
698.56s: very very active there's 15,000 oi with
701.40s: 9,000 almost 10,000 transacted today so
704.96s: there's a lot of people moving into this
706.60s: and then if we come out here to the 35s
708.48s: you'll see another big block of people
711.40s: 16,700 oi and 5,000 traded today so
714.52s: there are absolutely people building a
716.44s: position in here the volatility is not
718.96s: that high and if we take a look really
721.72s: quick at the out of the- money implied
723.72s: volatility for an idea we still have a
726.28s: standard volatility smile at least for
728.32s: this near-term expiration let's take a
729.64s: look at the 19 July yeah so again if
732.44s: you've looked at any of my other videos
733.96s: you'll notice that this looks so
735.36s: different than what GameStop looks like
737.44s: in here there's standard emphasis to the
740.04s: downside typically you'll see something
742.48s: that looks more like this that's tail
744.08s: heavy to the downside in terms of
746.56s: implied volatility are a little more
748.00s: equal whereas a lot of GameStop implied
751.28s: volatility for the out of the monies is
752.64s: actually very high on the call side
754.88s: meaning fear or expectation of upside
757.32s: movement you're not seeing that here but
759.12s: you do see some of these really large
761.44s: Kinks like this right here behind my
763.12s: head that's also very tradable but yeah
765.92s: even these 30s they're not overpaying
767.96s: for them a ton which is kind of nice
769.88s: from a practitioner standpoint in terms
772.40s: of your entries but this also doesn't
774.88s: necessarily look to me like there's just
777.92s: a bunch of act ity going on something
780.96s: massive coming down the pike as I always
783.24s: say that doesn't mean that that's not
784.52s: the case but this definitely looks a
786.52s: little bit slower than what I'm seeing
788.52s: in uh GameStop so as always any
791.28s: questions let me know be an outlier see
793.20s: you guys later
