0.40s: hey everyone eric here the uh
3.52s: next card chat segment is
6.64s: more or less directed towards kind of
8.24s: the the younger investors but
10.48s: i really do think it applies to
12.56s: everybody um
13.92s: anyways but nonetheless it really is
16.56s: something that
17.92s: as i reflect on it it's stuff that i
21.84s: wish
23.12s: i thought about a little bit more when i
25.60s: was starting off
26.88s: so for those of you that don't know
30.00s: right i started investing pretty young
32.72s: and
33.28s: that's a great thing right it gives you
35.12s: more time
36.40s: um more exposure to the market all of
38.64s: that is good
39.60s: stuff now one of the things that people
44.00s: don't widely talk about is some of the
46.96s: downsides of starting
48.32s: early and i found that honestly there's
51.44s: a lot of them it's not as easy as just
53.44s: start
54.00s: young and then you know you'll be good
56.88s: you'll benefit it's just
58.32s: not how it works especially if you want
60.16s: to be an active investor if you're a
61.60s: passive investor i can see that
63.60s: but if you're actively investing it's
65.52s: really not so much the case and it's
67.12s: important
68.16s: to kind of understand that and i say
70.00s: that because everybody
72.80s: not everybody is dramatic most folks
76.24s: who are financially savvy will encourage
79.60s: people to invest and start young good
82.88s: that's a good start the problem with it
86.40s: is without good direction
89.52s: that early start can just perpetually
92.72s: set you
93.36s: back and that's the bad part of it
96.64s: a lot of younger traders do not think
100.24s: through
100.72s: what they're doing and essentially they
103.92s: just start losing money
105.84s: and when you lose money early on you're
109.20s: really starting to take your future
111.36s: wealth away from yourself
113.44s: and losing some money is natural it's
115.68s: going to happen to anybody who's
116.80s: starting to invest
118.16s: but there's got to be a line in the sand
120.32s: somewhere where you realize that you're
121.76s: being counterproductive
123.36s: so i wanted to run through a couple
126.16s: things
127.04s: that really i guess i would call it
129.76s: advice to myself
131.44s: if i were to sit my younger self down
135.36s: that's first starting
137.36s: and really
141.12s: i guess that would apply to you know
142.96s: other folks who are younger
145.04s: so when i started at 17 the very first
147.92s: thing
148.56s: that i would tell myself is learn
151.84s: to take paper trading seriously and i
154.64s: know that it's a pain point for a lot of
156.40s: folks
156.96s: it's very difficult to take paper
159.36s: trading seriously for this reason or
161.20s: that reason
162.96s: when i look back at it if you can't find
165.44s: the discipline
166.72s: to take paper trading seriously you're
169.20s: gonna have a hard time with most of this
171.36s: so that's one of the very first things i
173.52s: would tell myself
174.40s: is learn to take paper trading seriously
177.12s: because the only thing it's gonna do
179.36s: is save you money it will allow you
182.88s: to get most of the big kinks
185.92s: out of your approach without you having
188.48s: to pay for them
190.16s: and to me that's a that that's really
193.04s: big that's an important thing
195.36s: because especially when we're starting
197.84s: most of us have limited capital
199.92s: and you really can't afford to you know
202.24s: just kind of piss it away
204.16s: so that's the very first thing
207.76s: learn to take paper trading seriously
210.56s: the next piece of advice
212.08s: that i would give myself is one that i
214.72s: actually
215.28s: reiterate pretty frequently and it's
217.76s: that the money
219.36s: i am trading with is not
223.04s: going to be the source of my future
225.20s: wealth
226.08s: that's something i completely missed the
227.76s:  train on i
229.84s: i don't know i i guess that i thought
231.68s: that i was going to be able to
232.72s: aggressively grow that money to start
234.64s: drawing on it
235.92s: and it's just not the case so
239.44s: what i wish i would have told myself or
241.52s: you know what i would tell
242.88s: myself is the money that you're gonna
245.84s: like truly
246.88s: benefit from is stuff
250.00s: that you're not gonna see it until
252.48s: you're 25
253.36s: 30 and even that's young i'm really
255.68s: fortunate in that sense
257.84s: but you get the point the fact is is the
260.96s: money that you're trading when you're
262.40s: first starting
263.36s: that's not the money that's going to be
264.72s: your wealth the focus
267.12s: should be developing a strategy that's
270.00s: consistent
271.20s: and once you can maintain consistency it
273.92s: means that you can control
275.52s: variables and then that's something that
278.32s: you can
278.88s: adapt in scale to become profitable
282.56s: so that's something that if i were to
285.44s: give myself
286.24s: like one solid piece of input that would
289.12s: be the one thing
290.48s: is stop trading you know that small
293.44s: account
294.00s: as if it's going to be your future
295.60s: wealth because you start focusing too
298.16s: much on
298.88s: dollar returns on the account as
301.68s: compared to
302.48s: good fundamentals that as you earn more
305.68s: money as you spread into different
307.52s: business ventures and create more
309.04s: capital
310.32s: that you could then move to that account
312.48s: and deploy successfully
314.40s: so first thing learn to take paper
317.76s: trading seriously
318.96s: the second thing is um
322.96s: to like understand the context of the
325.44s: account
326.40s: and really what the strategy is the next
329.84s: thing
330.64s: that i would absolutely tell myself
334.80s: um and this is one that i think
337.68s: everybody hears but they don't listen to
339.44s: so
340.00s: i have a different message the message
342.72s: would be
343.36s: the summary message would be learn learn
346.40s: patience
347.44s: stop trying to rush this and
351.04s: the only thing that's happening in those
352.72s: scenarios is again
354.08s: just setting myself back so
359.12s: what what i would tell myself obviously
362.00s: i would like to be able to tell myself
363.36s: that message but again just
364.40s: self-identifying none of us can listen
366.00s: to that it doesn't work it just doesn't
367.68s:  connect
369.12s: so what i then would offer myself as a
371.92s: follow-up
373.04s: is at the very earliest
376.56s: the account will start to develop some
378.80s: sort of meaningful
380.00s: value after i hit 25
383.76s: and the reason why i think that that's
385.36s: helpful is it just kind of puts the idea
387.52s: out of my mind that this is going to be
390.00s: wealth that i'm going to be using you
391.44s: know in my early 20s and again
393.76s: i continue to say this because it's true
396.64s: 25 is still
397.60s: super young and it's
400.64s: that's like the earliest point that i
403.12s: started developing
404.08s: any sort of meaningful wealth and a lot
406.56s: of it is
407.20s: due to good circumstance i wouldn't say
409.68s: that that's the norm
411.20s: i'm not saying other folks can't do it
413.04s: but i just
414.24s: like to reiterate that message to level
416.08s: set because if that's the you know the
418.56s: the mark you put on it you might be kind
420.56s: of upset when that doesn't happen
422.96s: so the third the third message
426.48s: is understand the timeline
429.60s: that the account really needs
432.88s: in order to do anything for you and that
435.52s: is if you're consistently successful
437.84s: so that would be the third thing the
440.88s: fourth thing
442.08s: that i would say to myself
445.92s: is one that i think
450.00s: i focus a lot more on it now as a trader
453.60s: but it's focused more
456.80s: on learning to manage risk as compared
460.16s: to
460.80s: pretty much anything else and when i
463.76s: look
464.00s: at the overall world and space of
467.68s: trading
468.88s: i find that the thing that really
471.52s: separates traders that
472.96s: exists perpetually or can stay in the
475.44s: game long term
477.04s: is their relationship with risk and
479.44s: their ability to
480.32s: modulate it at different points in time
483.04s: to accomplish different things
485.12s: and i find that to be super important
488.00s: and
488.96s: definitely something that i would
490.84s: reiterate um
492.16s: to myself early on because it's so easy
494.16s: to try to focus on
496.08s: you know um finding that good trade or
499.76s: finding that next strategy whatever the
501.68s: case is and all that stuff is good and
503.60s: important in and of itself
505.44s: but i really should have paid more
508.08s: attention to managing risk
510.00s: and i think that that would have done a
512.88s: good job
513.60s: for me to just
516.72s: limit the amount of capital wasted so
520.40s: that's the next thing the
523.68s: fifth thing i think i would tell myself
526.72s: and this is i don't know i guess i kind
529.04s: of just recently started thinking about
530.96s: this one
532.08s: um but it's the value of that external
535.84s: audit
536.32s: that i talk about when i first met my
538.96s: mentor
539.76s: i was kind of i don't know on the fence
542.24s: really of like what i thought about him
543.92s: how much i could trust him
545.92s: and that kind of stuff so
549.36s: i was kind of keeping some of my cards a
551.36s: little close to my chest
552.72s: which i think is fine but what i found
556.16s: is even verbalizing my process with
560.08s: a friend who has a limited understanding
562.96s: of investing
564.00s: was still super helpful so
567.04s: by taking the time to verbally walk
569.44s: through what i was doing
571.36s: it's you know something that we all kind
573.12s: of know exists but
574.72s: it really helps us a lot with really
577.68s: flushing through the details of the
579.12s: strategy
580.32s: so that's something i think that i could
582.16s: have benefited from earlier
584.32s: um and i guess that dovetails perfectly
586.56s: into the next thing
587.68s: is write a plan write a plan i don't
590.88s: know what it is about investing and how
592.80s: few people
593.92s: really want to take the time to write a
596.16s: plan because i was one of them
598.24s: i wanted to just trade and make money
600.72s: but
601.52s: the thing i would tell myself is that
604.96s: trading is one of those interesting
607.20s: things
608.00s: where anybody can start if you have a
611.52s: tax id number social security number and
613.60s: a bank account that you can link to
615.04s: you can start trading it is a very
617.76s: select
618.88s: small subset of traders that are able to
622.56s: beat the market
623.92s: and let alone the component to
627.92s: um you know be profitable i guess i
630.40s: should have phrased that opposite
632.08s: it's a small subset of traders that are
634.24s: profitable that actively invest
636.48s: and it's even a smaller subset still
639.52s: that beat the market consistently and i
642.72s: think to me that's a really powerful
644.40s: message in terms of the amount of time
646.32s: and effort
647.36s: that it takes to actually get good
650.64s: at this craft one of the things that
654.16s: i really would compare it to is the
657.20s: amount of effort
658.32s: that it took me to kind of groom myself
662.24s: to you know go the marine officer route
664.72s: the physical component the mental
666.32s: component all of that stuff
668.56s: i put in a lot of effort to be
670.24s: successful in those endeavors
672.40s: and when i first started trading i put a
674.32s: fraction of that effort into trading
676.32s: for some reason i think it's because
677.76s: most people think you can start and just
679.44s: make money
680.40s: it's not the case so i would tell myself
683.52s: that example
684.56s: essentially the amount of effort that i
686.24s: was putting in to groom myself to be a
688.80s: marine officer
690.00s: is i would almost say the baseline level
693.04s: of effort required
694.16s: in the investing game to be successful
696.80s: and
698.56s: i think that that lays a good context
700.80s: again for my
702.56s: younger previous self for those of you
706.32s: that haven't gone that route that you
708.32s: know
708.64s: example may not make sense so i would
711.28s: you know also maybe liken it to
713.76s: if you're a d1 athlete or
716.96s: you know something like that pretty much
718.88s: the amount of effort required to rise
721.28s: to the top of a pack in a competitive
724.00s: environment
724.96s: that's a you know fairly suitable
727.44s: analogy
729.68s: so one of those things is putting in
733.12s: that planning
733.84s: putting in that mental rigor and
736.24s: developing
737.12s: a written plan i cannot overemphasize
740.48s: the value of that written plan enough
742.16s: because it forces you to come to terms
744.56s: with what you're thinking
745.84s: on paper objectively and be able to
749.28s: answer
750.32s: your thought process and there's a lot
752.40s: of value in that
753.36s: for me the next thing
756.64s: that i would tell myself is
760.24s: do not be a one-trick pony but
764.00s: be focused on the strategies and
767.76s: approaches
769.04s: that i take the time to learn when i was
772.08s: first starting like a lot of folks
774.32s: i was trying just a ton of strategies
777.28s: just a ton of them
778.64s: um butterflies calendars vertical
782.08s: spreads iron condors
784.24s: short puts like like pretty much
786.64s: everything
787.84s: and a lot of that would have been better
790.80s: suited
791.36s: in a paper account that's what i do now
793.92s: is
794.64s: when i'm testing a new strategy i don't
796.48s: immediately go live with it
798.00s: i'll do it in a paper account for a
799.20s: little while to see if i like it and can
800.64s: develop a good
801.52s: outline for it and
804.80s: for whatever reason when i first started
806.40s: trading i was doing all that live
809.28s: and pissing a lot of money away doing it
811.12s: was stupid
812.48s: careful luckily i was really careful
815.04s: with
815.68s: size and i was very uh judicious in
818.24s: maintaining
818.80s: good size so that was helpful
822.32s: but otherwise it was still generally a
824.96s: waste of capital
826.32s: and that is another good note if you
828.48s: find yourself
830.40s: not not focusing on size or risk
833.28s: allocation it's something that's
834.48s: worthwhile
836.16s: the last thing that i would say
840.00s: um that i really would kind of tell my
843.12s: younger self
844.96s: is don't focus just on
848.56s: the investing markets like stock stock
851.68s: markets
853.28s: i found that a really key component to
855.76s: my ability to develop
857.36s: wealth at a relatively young age
860.48s: was spreading into other business
862.80s: ventures
864.32s: and you kind of come across different
867.12s: opportunities that way
868.96s: the market is a really helpful way to
872.16s: you know continue to enhance your wealth
874.56s: but like i said if you're starting with
876.24s: a relatively small amount of money
878.24s: it's probably not going to be your you
880.40s: know source of future wealth i say that
882.64s: a lot
883.68s: so some of the business ventures that i
886.96s: got into
887.68s: a little bit later in life that would
889.20s: have been helpful earlier
891.28s: things like real estate obviously that's
893.60s: tough to get into
894.72s: when you're super young but the sooner
897.60s: you can get into stuff like that
899.28s: i think it's helpful another thing
903.04s: another you know just general business
904.80s: venture that i think
906.40s: would be um pretty wise
910.00s: to crack into is finding ways to turn
913.52s: hobbies
914.64s: into sources of income one of the things
917.52s: i used to do
918.48s: in college was buy
921.60s: cars that were you know
925.12s: in disrepair and i would fix them
928.24s: and i would sell the the fixed car and
931.12s: that actually was a pretty good source
932.88s: of money
933.92s: and one of the bigger producers of kind
936.96s: of my
937.92s: my wealth development early on so
941.28s: i would echo getting into things like
943.36s: that a little earlier
945.04s: i felt like i took a while to get
947.84s: started on that because i was scared to
949.52s: take risk
950.80s: and i think that's kind of where i would
953.84s: wrap this video up
955.20s: is do not be afraid to take risk
960.40s: it's it can be scary um
964.00s: but if you don't risk anything or if you
967.76s: don't
968.32s: take good risk there's
971.44s: very little return on whatever that is
974.48s: so i would tell myself take
977.76s: good risk and when i talk about good
980.40s: risk
980.96s: that's something that has good prospects
983.28s: of return
984.00s: whatever it is so for example those cars
987.60s: i would avoid different cars that i
990.48s: didn't think would sell well
991.92s: that would be bad risk and i'm thankful
994.96s: for doing that so whatever version of
996.72s: that applies to whatever you get into
999.28s: i think i would make sure to
1002.32s: be comfortable and willing to take risk
1005.36s: but make sure that it's calculated and
1008.16s: it's good risk
1009.68s: if you take risk just for the sake of
1011.68s: taking risk
1012.80s: sooner or later you're gonna get caught
1014.16s: in a shitty spot and you're just gonna
1015.68s:  lose money
1016.96s: it's like if you go to you know a casino
1020.88s: there's certain games that have worse
1024.24s: or more even house odds some of the
1027.28s: better games blackjack
1029.04s: craps stuff like that and then there's
1031.92s: some
1032.32s: really really shitty games slot machines
1034.48s: the worst house odds you can find
1036.80s: so i do like to gamble if i go to the
1039.52s: casino
1040.24s: i'm not going to play the slot machine i
1042.64s: don't go to a casino
1044.00s: to you know make money really it's more
1046.64s: for entertainment
1047.68s: but nonetheless i'm still going to pick
1049.36s: something like craps that's
1051.60s: you know enjoyable but not the worst
1053.60s: odds like that kind of thing
1055.60s: so take good risk if you are too risk
1059.36s: adverse
1060.88s: it's going to be hard to make
1062.16s: anything and if you are too
1064.08s: reckless you're going to lose everything
1065.92s: you have so
1067.20s: it really is about finding that balance
1070.16s: and
1071.52s: it's an unforgiving scale to try to
1074.64s: develop
1075.76s: if you are unsuccessful in developing
1077.84s: that balance like i said you're either
1079.36s: going to miss a lot of opportunity
1081.28s: or you're going to start losing a bunch
1082.96s: of money if i were to
1084.96s: skew my approach it would be to be
1089.92s: kind of less risky as compared to too
1092.00s: risky
1093.04s: and i say that because i generally
1096.24s: am pretty conservative and what that
1099.12s: means is
1099.92s: you know like these people like bezos
1102.32s: bezos sorry
1103.36s: um and steve jobs and bill gates like
1105.76s: these people who like stop doing
1107.84s: everything and put all of their
1109.76s: resources into this idea that they have
1112.40s: i'm not sure that i have the intestinal
1114.40s: fortitude for that that's scary
1116.16s: to me
1116.96s: and i feel really uncomfortable in those
1118.88s: kind of scenarios
1120.40s: so that kind of risk where you're taking
1123.36s: like a big gamble but for a
1125.44s: really big reward
1127.12s: it works for some people but my general
1129.84s: approach really isn't
1131.36s: really like that it's way more of these
1134.16s: base hits
1135.44s: until i can develop something a little
1137.52s: bit more meaningful
1138.64s: and that's just kind of a reflection on
1140.56s: how i take risk
1142.08s: but spend some time to understand your
1144.48s: risk profile and how you
1146.16s: how you approach risk so that you can
1148.88s: develop
1149.68s: a good relationship with it early on
1152.64s: that's going to be important for your
1154.00s: longevity and investing
1156.32s: so those are a handful of things that
1159.92s: i would tell myself first starting out i
1162.40s: was actually thinking about turning this
1164.16s: into a little bit of a mini series kind
1166.16s: of
1166.48s: you know like a monologue with my
1168.80s: younger self because
1171.20s: i see a lot of young traders on reddit
1173.76s: and in the discord groups i'm a part of
1176.24s: and i i just see so much of myself
1178.88s: because we
1179.84s: most of us are very similar if we're
1181.84s: trading there's a lot of similarities in
1183.36s: what we're doing
1184.72s: and i think that we can seriously stand
1188.08s: to learn so much from one another
1190.32s: um and kind of enhance the process
1193.20s: looking back
1194.48s: i have been super fortunate in kind of
1197.12s: the risk that i've taken
1198.48s: and where i've been able to navigate
1200.88s: myself to
1202.24s: and if i can impart some of that to
1204.48s: folks
1205.44s: so that they don't have to take the
1207.04s: steps back that i did
1208.96s:  man like they're you could be super
1211.60s:  successful
1212.88s: really early if you
1216.88s: still benefit from the education side of
1219.36s: things without having to pay for it
1221.68s: so that's really my goal with this you
1223.92s: know self monologue thing
1226.32s: but anyways as always let me know if
1228.80s: there's anything that you want to see me
1230.16s: talk about in particular happy to do it
1232.64s: and i will catch everybody later
