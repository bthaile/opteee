0.08s: I have a question for you do you know
2.28s: how you actually make money in trading I
6.20s: asked this because I had a conversation
8.20s: in my Discord a couple days ago that
10.00s: really reminded me that a lot of people
12.08s: have kind of these different Notions
14.92s: about where and how they make money but
16.96s: they really don't understand at a base
19.36s: level the function that leads to making
22.60s: money and I'm going to walk you through
24.48s: three ways to actually make money in the
27.56s: stock market and no one of the ways to
29.44s: make money isn't day trading you can
31.40s: lose money day trading so what I hope to
33.96s: do is to get us to a better
36.56s: understanding of the actual functions
38.80s: that lead to making money so that you
40.64s: can spend more time focusing on
43.12s: developing those functions so that you
45.48s: can make more money what's up everybody
47.20s: Eric here welcome back to all the
48.40s: outliers and a shout out to the patreon
49.88s: family you guys make content like this
51.92s: possible so that my video editor can
54.16s: make these fun for all of us to watch
56.20s: and uh yeah so you guys are paying him
58.16s: so he thanks you let's take a look at
60.80s: what I'm talking about here I want to
62.40s: start with some level setting this was
63.88s: from the Discord now I blanked out the
65.96s: dude's name because this isn't meant to
67.96s: drag anybody this is literally meant to
70.16s: have a conversation because my guess is
72.12s: the vast majority of people would answer
74.36s: this the same way so here I ask him what
77.60s: are ways that you can conceive of that a
79.48s: Trader can make money in the market two
81.20s: to three is fine now to be clear three
83.40s: is not an exhausted list there's plenty
84.96s: of ways to make money in the stock
86.04s: market but I'm going to talk about three
87.72s: broad functions and I wanted to see if I
90.12s: could get this person even close to any
92.84s: of them because a couple of them are
94.40s: pretty common ones and their response
96.64s: was many things day trading Futures
99.24s: swing trading options Buy and Hold
101.56s: stocks now when I read this I
103.72s: immediately saw what was going on they
105.88s: were completely disconnected from what
109.12s: actually makes money versus activities
112.12s: you can buy and hold a stock that goes
115.00s: down you don't make money you can swing
117.32s: trade options and not make money you can
119.32s: day trade Futures and not make money
121.68s: these the specific Futures options
124.44s: stocks those are just products Buy and
126.32s: Hold is a strategy swing trading is a
128.24s: type of strategy day trading is a type
130.00s: of strategy none of those inherently
131.80s: lead to making money so again my hope is
134.36s: to get people to a closer understanding
137.04s: of what functions actually make money
140.12s: because in this example if I were to ask
142.60s: this Trader how do you make more money
144.32s: they might say well I need to day trade
145.80s: Futures more that probably actually is
147.68s: the worst thing they could possibly do
149.20s: the worst IDE I ever heard but they view
152.20s: that as a way to make money so let's get
154.64s: to the heart and soul of what's
156.88s: Happening Here I asked what are the
158.76s: actual functions that lead to making
160.84s: money and they responded with trading
162.56s: buy and sell which is kind of
163.96s: reiterating this slightly different and
165.80s: then I kind of pointed out what I just
167.40s: pointed out to you that none of these
168.72s: essentially inherently lead to making
170.72s: money another thing I saw in the option
173.16s: subreddit was this I've built together
175.52s: this option strategy it seems to
177.92s: guarantee a profit let's just just you
180.04s: know completely pretend that guarantee
182.64s: at least was spelled correct in the
184.96s: context of talking about something that
187.00s: automatically makes a profit in options
188.88s: trading now to be clear if he was
190.80s: Trading long box spreads in a European
193.32s: style cash settled index like SPX
195.84s: technically that does guarantee a profit
197.80s: but then the second sentence quickly
199.48s: tells us that's not what he's talking
200.72s: about so anyways the point being is this
203.36s: also doesn't guarantee anything so what
206.00s: are some other commonly cited ways to
209.08s: make money in the stock market that are
210.68s: incorrect well Theta Decay that's not
213.60s: you can lose money while you are gaining
215.92s: Theta Decay so no that's not one selling
218.40s: options and buying options neither of
220.08s: though inherently leads to profit being
222.32s: long gamma that does not inherently lead
225.24s: to making profit the point being is that
227.32s: these are all different measures of how
229.32s: things behave or these are different
230.80s: strategies these are different products
233.12s: but this isn't how money is made there's
236.64s: a giant disconnect for people between
239.40s: these two things and I continue to beat
241.64s: this point to death because I think it
243.44s: is so important for Traders to be able
245.20s: to clearly articulate simply how they're
248.88s: making money so that you can make more
252.04s: money you can optimize whatever that
254.32s: thing is but if we can't even identify
257.72s: the thing that we need to optimize then
259.72s: what are we even doing here so now let's
262.64s: talk about these three methods The First
265.12s: One Direction this is a really common
268.44s: approach to Trading for example you can
271.20s: look at something like the can slim
273.00s: method where they create a system that's
275.84s: structured around very careful timing so
279.20s: that they can buy things at what they
280.68s: consider to be a lowrisk entry and then
283.44s: Buy Low sell high that is absolutely a
287.76s: way to make money you can also short
289.84s: stocks selling high and buying low you
291.96s: can also do this with volatility if you
293.88s: think volatility is overpriced or
295.32s: underpriced you could buy or sell it but
297.76s: direction is one of the oldest tricks in
300.12s: the book and being directionally correct
303.52s: is absolutely a function that can lead
306.04s: to making money trading now notice how I
308.56s: have a couple bullet points here though
309.96s: and I think these are important to call
311.88s: out because you can be good at
314.32s: determining Direction in a bunch of
315.88s: different capacities you could have a
317.16s: very high win rate but a low average win
321.24s: and moderate losses that in agur
323.84s: aggregate is positively expecting you
325.92s: could have another scenario where you
328.04s: actually have a very low win R you could
329.92s: be right 25% of the time but if your
331.92s: winning trades are big enough you can
334.08s: still make money so this is why I
336.44s: believe in this scenario there's two
338.64s: things that we really need to focus on
340.88s: is getting good at determining Direction
343.00s: and some capacity but then also
345.52s: intertwining managing money effectively
347.64s: being able to follow winning trades if
349.68s: that's your style being able to capture
352.08s: a certain win amount if you're trying to
353.84s: hit a higher win rate but directional
355.92s: trading is a really common one the next
357.80s: one we have is risk assumption so this
360.04s: is kind of also known as structural
362.04s: Alpha and this is where we assume other
365.48s: people's risk this is the very commonly
369.16s: cited risk Premia in options trading now
373.16s: there are other ways you can assume risk
374.92s: for people there are other kinds of
376.48s: structural Alpha that just risk premiums
378.40s: is one of them and this is essentially
380.44s: the force where if we take a look at spy
383.16s: here we go 29 days out just picking an
385.12s: expiration and we look at the 443 puts
387.44s: that's oh I'm sorry let's look at the
388.68s: 445s the 445s are a 34 Delta and those
393.20s: are trading for
394.80s: $384 for the 445s 34 Delta now if we
398.08s: look at the corresponding 34 Delta call
399.96s: same expiration those are only trading
401.48s: for $297 so why is there an extra dollar
405.04s: essentially on these puts that's putc
407.88s: that is structural Alpha this is showing
410.68s: us that the theoretical understanding of
412.76s: options pricing is not what happens in
414.80s: the markets because people are willingly
418.12s: overpaying for puts and that's for a
420.96s: bunch of different reasons this is why
423.24s: things like this do exist because a lot
425.88s: of the times when we talk about the
427.04s: stock market we talk about it in the
428.60s: context of a theoretical vacuum where
430.52s: everything's perfect everybody's a
431.76s: rational actor but we know markets are
433.88s: not rational and we also know that there
436.56s: are a lot of players that have a bunch
439.04s: of rules they have to follow if you're a
440.92s: pension fund manager and you want to
442.92s: keep your job next quarter you can't
444.60s: have big draw Downs so they would rather
447.12s: overpay for downside protection so that
449.84s: they can keep their job and sacrifice
451.68s: some profit potential knowing that
453.28s: they're inefficiently buying that
454.72s: protection they don't care so this is a
456.92s: way for retail traders to make money is
460.04s: you can assume that risk for other
461.64s: people one example this right here
464.08s: selling cash secured puts we know in
466.48s: general there are variance risk premiums
468.96s: baked into put options because of put
471.40s: skew and also implied volatility tends
474.44s: to be priced over realized volatility so
477.28s: both of those put together can lead to a
479.12s: w to make money so how can you make
480.84s: money doing this well you have to study
482.28s: this idea of risk premum then you have
483.96s: to figure out how you want to capture it
485.36s: and then you have to optimize it but
486.60s: this is a second method let's take a
488.04s: look at a third method we have
489.40s: inefficiencies now this one's
490.96s: interesting because some here are more
493.16s: available to Traders than others so for
494.96s: example something like mispricing this
496.72s: could be a market maker turns on their
498.84s: quote machine and literally it has the
500.80s: wrong price that is insanely improbable
504.04s: it's not frequent at all and your
506.20s: capacity one to spot it fast enough to
508.52s: then Trade It is essentially zero it's
510.76s: not impossible entirely but it's so
513.12s: insanely unlikely there are literally
514.72s: alos that are looking for stuff like
516.92s: that and if you think about really these
519.48s: kind of two styles of trading assuming
522.04s: risk or looking for structural alpha or
524.40s: looking for inefficiencies you're kind
526.04s: of providing a service in all of these
528.44s: circumstances because here the service
530.44s: you're providing is taking somebody
531.64s: else's risk here let's say if you could
534.00s: catch one of these mispricings you are
535.72s: then normalizing prices to what they
537.52s: should be in a set Market Marketplace
539.92s: then there's things like cross exchange
541.64s: Arbitrage this is where you find
543.28s: something on one exchange that might be
544.92s: trading expensive and you sell it and
546.84s: you buy it on another exchange where
548.24s: it's trading cheaply here you are
550.56s: normalizing prices but you are also
552.32s: providing liquidity that's another
553.88s: service you're providing value
555.56s: dissonance is interesting because this
557.64s: is kind of when we can clearly see and
560.84s: have a system to assess when a move is
564.00s: overdone and there's a break from the
566.44s: current price of something and whatever
568.48s: you perceive the value to be because
570.64s: again going back to periods of mania
573.64s: like GameStop where that was a short
576.04s: squeeze that turned into a bit of a pump
577.72s: and dump where people are still waiting
579.40s: for the mother of all squeezes to come
581.12s: up and there are different forces that
582.92s: happen there but during that squeeze
585.16s: there's value dissonance that starts to
587.20s: occur where nobody looks at that and
588.84s: says GameStop is worth this nobody
590.52s: thinks that but because of structural
592.68s: forces in the markets and artificial
594.56s: manipulation we saw this giant move in
596.60s: price and you could have either rode it
598.48s: to the upside or taking the short to the
600.32s: downside when it eventually did collapse
602.20s: but you can find ways to look for Value
605.00s: that's just completely out of whack and
606.76s: to place a trade on it there's also
608.64s: things like peed and no this is not what
611.24s: you do with your boyfriend in the
612.80s: bathtub on the weekends this is positive
615.36s: earnings announcement drift this is a
617.68s: really well-studied Force where after an
620.04s: earnings release if something has a
621.52s: really great release and a giant beat to
623.60s: the upside there's certain parameters
625.08s: that have to be met and there are
626.60s: studies that you can find on ssrn on
628.72s: this thing that over the next quarter
631.68s: they tend to go on and have outsized
633.56s: returns that's because the market is not
636.08s: efficient enough to price in that new
638.16s: information quickly enough and it takes
639.96s: time for it to be digested that's
642.12s: exactly what leads to this that is a
643.92s: potential way for you to make money as a
646.64s: Trader the point here is every single
649.44s: one of these things is tied to a way
652.80s: discreetly to make money if you are
654.96s: directionally correct if you are able to
657.20s: price and take risk for other people
659.04s: providing a service or if you can find
661.24s: different types of these efficiencies
663.08s: inefficiencies sorry there's all
664.60s: different kinds of these and then if you
666.64s: have any questions on how do you build a
668.56s: strategy around this well I have a video
670.32s: that I'll throw in the link in the notes
671.84s: Below on this exact thing that really
673.92s: goes into building an option strategy in
675.72s: depth however this is the general flow
678.72s: that you're going to take so let's say
679.96s: that your profit mechanism is being
681.56s: directionally correct your hypothesis is
684.00s: one of two things one of three things
685.32s: you could pick whatever your hypothesis
686.64s: is but let's just say your hypothesis is
688.64s: that you can use technical analysis
691.00s: whatever indicators you choose to be
692.68s: correct 51% of the time that would lead
695.16s: to a profitable outcome provided that
696.80s: you manage your money effectively so
698.36s: then you can test that hypothesis you
700.24s: can test those tools you can test your
701.72s: money management you can test other
703.44s: tools other management other
705.00s: alternatives to see what actually works
707.32s: best then you figure out which one of
710.40s: those combinations offers the greatest
712.28s: opportunity then you can live test that
714.64s: track the results and optimize none of
716.84s: this is easy trading is not supposed to
718.76s: be easy that's why there's an
720.12s: opportunity here the barrier to entry is
722.72s: so low anybody can start imagine if it
725.40s: was so easy to make money no there would
727.20s: be nothing left to pick up off the
728.68s: ground you have to look in the difficult
731.04s: places you have to spend the time
732.68s: thinking through these things so that
734.56s: you can outsmart other participants
737.28s: because it is a competitive landscape
739.36s: this is exactly the art of trading you
742.20s: have to get used to it so these are
743.72s: three ways you can actually make money
745.20s: trading like I said there's plenty more
746.96s: but I wanted to give you something you
748.20s: can bite onto that most people could
749.88s: probably wrap their head around fairly
752.32s: reasonably but as always if you have any
753.88s: questions let me know don't forget like
756.00s: subscribe share be an outlier see you
758.24s: guys later
