0.80s: hey everyone eric here um
3.28s: been offline for a few days now just
5.04s: kind of enjoying the weekend and still
6.88s: hanging out with uh
8.32s: some friends that are in town but
10.24s: anyways time to get back
11.76s: and start sharing some updates of note
15.60s: small stacks this will be the last
17.92s: segment for
18.64s: small stacks so i've been working on
21.28s: this
21.84s: uh portfolio for about three months now
24.48s: and
26.48s: today just happened to be when i i
29.36s: essentially flattened everything out
31.44s: so over the last couple weeks is when i
33.68s: exited
34.56s: my positions in kroger and intel which
37.52s: were the diagonals
39.04s: and those were the last trades that i
40.40s: had on and
42.16s: i took a second to kind of review the
43.84s: portfolio overall the performance has
45.92s: been really good
47.28s: and unless there's some sort of
50.40s: you know specific conversation somebody
52.96s: wants to have
54.00s: about the small stacks approach in
56.00s: general which i'm happy to do
57.76s: i think in general my approach is pretty
60.64s: clear
61.60s: and what i how i went about the small
64.24s: account
65.04s: um i think i expressed that over the
67.20s: last three months
68.48s: so i don't really have much else to add
71.84s: to that as of right now
73.68s: i will say though um that i
76.96s: am planning on doing another similar
79.76s: segment
80.72s: with taking a certain amount of money
82.80s: opening up a fresh account
84.56s: and then trading whatever that amount of
86.48s: money is uh kind of how i would now
89.28s: so i'm still looking into that if
91.04s: there's any suggestions on account size
92.80s: that you would like to see me do let me
94.40s: know
94.88s: as of right now i am thinking a larger
96.80s: account um
97.92s: something 500 000 1 mil something like
101.20s: that
101.84s: because i think that once you start
103.36s: getting to those numbers the
104.88s: approach drastically changes to the way
108.24s: that we invest as compared to
111.04s: what we're seeing here okay so let's
114.24s: take a look at the screen and let's do a
117.84s: quick overview
119.52s: so i started on the first of september
122.08s: opening up some trades
123.52s: started with five thousand dollars today
126.32s: i
126.64s: ended the account with six thousand
128.72s: eight hundred seventeen dollars which
130.16s: represents a
131.24s: 26.65 return the
134.24s: two trades that really did me the best
136.72s: um
137.44s: were diagonals it was kroger
140.56s: and then pfizer now
144.32s: as i look through these trades overall
147.44s: you can tell that the lion's share of my
150.48s: return
151.36s: is coming from the diagonals which is
154.16s: about what i would expect these stand to
156.48s: make a decent amount of money if you let
158.16s: them work
159.36s: so the coverage strangles
162.72s: definitely lagged they only gave me 225
165.20s: bucks
166.00s: but that's kind of part of having a
168.88s: diversified portfolio
170.24s: in some instances i accepted a smaller
173.20s: return
174.00s: in the coverage strangle simply to
176.80s: balance out the more aggressive play
178.72s: with the diagonals
180.32s: but in general the account returned well
184.48s: it was a good time in the market so if
186.16s: we take a quick look
188.80s: so this is essentially what the market
190.96s: did since we started at the beginning of
192.80s: september
193.84s: um it definitely had some ebbs and flows
196.40s: which is good i didn't want it just to
198.16s: move straight up that doesn't help us
200.08s: with anything
201.28s: so you know we had this dip rally dip
203.84s: and then we're in the
205.20s: midst of a follow-on rally but
207.28s: nonetheless you get the point the market
209.12s: during this time was not just straight
210.80s: up it's actually pretty damn similar to
213.20s: where it was when we started the month
215.28s: not too different from there which is
217.36s: again a good thing
218.56s: that's where we have a chance to see how
220.16s: a strategy works
221.84s: so overall um
225.28s: the portfolio really didn't have a whole
228.64s: lot of trades in it
229.92s: and that's by design the thing for small
232.32s: accounts is
233.12s: commissions hurt they can take winning
235.12s: trades and turn them into losing trades
236.64s: if we're not cautious
238.16s: so i purposely do not try to you know
241.28s: super actively scalp
243.44s: in smaller accounts plus i think it just
245.68s: exposes us to
246.96s: outsized risk so what i wanted to really
250.64s: focus on here is
251.76s: talking about um some of my key
254.40s: takeaways
256.08s: so the first one is something that i've
258.00s: talked about several times now
260.08s: and i can't help but reiterate it
262.00s: because i really think that this is
263.60s: probably the biggest
265.36s: component to this is that your five
268.64s: thousand ten thousand twenty thousand
270.80s: fifty thousand dollar account
272.88s: is not going to be the source of your
274.64s: future wealth it's not
277.04s: and the sooner we can get over that
280.40s: the better off we're going to be able to
282.16s: trade because what happens is when we
284.56s: take a smaller amount of money
286.72s: and we try to turn it into our future
289.12s: wealth
290.00s: we take tremendous risk and
293.20s: vast majority of the time we're going to
294.64s: find ourselves losing money taking a
296.56s: step back
297.76s: and then having to relearn this thing
299.52s: all over again so we've just wasted time
302.16s: and money trying to do something that we
304.72s: already know
305.92s: isn't that smart so it is a pill that's
309.76s: hard to swallow but nonetheless you got
311.44s: to get it down because
313.28s: if you can't accept the fact that a
315.68s: small amount of money
316.72s: is not going to magically turn into your
318.80s: retirement account
320.40s: um you're you're going to make mistakes
322.80s: trying to make that happen
324.00s: so that's the first note on that the
326.32s: second thing
327.84s: is the primary
331.12s: purpose of trading in a small account
334.96s: is not to make money yes we want to make
338.32s: money
339.12s: the primary purpose is to make sure that
341.84s: you are developing the skill set
344.72s: because what's going to happen is in
347.44s: your account
348.48s: you're going to invest hopefully you'll
350.88s: make some money on your investments
353.04s: and that will increase your account
355.12s: value however much
358.08s: what we should be focusing on is
360.84s: aggressively
362.24s: saving money in if you are actively
365.68s: investing
366.64s: developing a skill set that you can rely
368.56s: on that we understand can return a
370.32s: certain amount
371.68s: still adding your savings that's
375.04s: how you grow wealth that is how you're
377.28s: going to make a lot of money
378.64s: with investing it's not going to be
380.64s: throwing 10 000
381.92s: in account and never touching it again
383.68s: just trading it hoping it grows that's
385.28s: not it
386.56s: so that leads me to the second point
388.40s: here which is less is more we went over
390.16s: that you know in my last
391.60s: section i do think that if you have a
394.08s: small account
394.96s: you really probably shouldn't be trying
397.52s: to actively trade
398.96s: on a daily basis you know scalping sort
401.36s: of thing
402.16s: and i also think trading earnings plays
404.72s: and stuff like that just doesn't bode
406.48s: well for these accounts
407.60s: they can't handle big drawdowns
410.64s: and whenever we're you know trying more
414.16s: uh short-term strategies variance of
416.96s: returns is very high
418.64s: so what that means is you can get on a
420.64s: roll where it's a losing streak it
422.64s: happens you can lose four or five trades
424.32s: in a row
425.36s: well the difference between a big
426.88s: account a small account is a big account
428.64s: can exist
429.44s: beyond those five trades and continue on
431.44s: whereas a small account
433.20s: if you lose half that account you're
435.44s: completely on a different trajectory
437.84s: than if you hadn't done that so it's
439.92s: important to keep that in mind
441.20s: and then don't forget commissions they
443.04s: exist and they
444.56s: mean something next one is patience this
447.92s: one really ties to the first one this is
450.00s: probably the most difficult for most of
451.52s: us but again
453.28s: i just continue to re-emphasize that
455.76s: first point because i think that is
457.20s: probably the biggest hitch
458.56s: i come across with people that start
460.32s: trading with a small amount of money
462.48s: the next one is to save i already hit on
465.04s: that before
465.92s: but again just to reiterate the entire
468.72s: you know
469.28s: goal of this is we're going to develop a
471.20s: skill set that we can rely on
473.60s: and then continue to save so that as the
476.96s: account is returning money we're saving
478.64s: money which is actively growing the
480.24s: account
480.96s: that's when we're really going to see
482.32s: growth and then once you start finding
484.40s: your account in the 200
485.68s: 000 300 000 range that starts to become
488.32s: meaningful
489.68s: because on those accounts you can return
491.92s: 10 make 20 30k
493.60s: over the course of a year it starts to
495.60s: matter
496.96s: so just kind of again keep the long game
499.76s: in mind here
501.04s: the next one is risk control i bring
503.20s: this one up because
504.40s: it is next to freaking impossible to
506.80s: maintain a good risk reward profile in a
509.12s: small account
510.24s: and i talked about that a lot in the
512.40s: small stack segments
514.00s: so what i want to highlight here is not
516.96s: some sort of magical way to control risk
519.04s: in these accounts because it doesn't
520.24s: exist but it's more to acknowledge the
522.32s: risk that we're taking
524.24s: and make sure that our risk to reward at
527.12s: least makes sense
529.04s: and that's really important because
531.44s: again if you find yourself on a losing
533.20s: streak smaller accounts can be
535.12s: completely debilitated
537.20s: if that happens to to any sort of
539.52s: extreme so
540.96s: it's important to acknowledge the fact
543.68s: in a small account
544.96s: it's very difficult if not impossible to
548.40s: have a good risk profile overall we're
551.04s: gonna be over invested we're gonna be
552.88s: over allocated
554.40s: for most of the time my account was
556.08s: hovering 70 to 80 percent invested where
558.56s: my
559.04s: you know my margin account was around
560.56s: 20. so it's just
562.64s: how it goes with smaller accounts if you
564.64s: want to successfully deploy strategies
566.64s: you're going to have to use the money
568.72s: but that gives you a really limited room
571.60s: to adjust
572.64s: so we got to be really careful with
574.24s: where we take our shots
576.32s: and then the last thing this is what
578.80s: it's all about
579.76s: consistency when we're trading a small
582.64s: account
583.44s: we're refining a skill set so that we
586.48s: can be
587.20s: consistent in our returns
590.72s: the reason why this is so important is
592.48s: because in this example on a five
594.32s: thousand dollar account i returned
595.92s: twenty six percent
597.20s: it's a good return on a five thousand
599.44s: dollar account it's like sixteen hundred
601.04s: bucks
601.68s: doesn't really mean anything but if i
604.80s: can maintain
605.76s: some sort of semblance of similar return
609.84s: obviously it's going to normalize and
611.44s: hit whatever it hits
613.04s: but if i can maintain that semblance of
615.44s: return
616.48s: well as i continue to grow my account
618.80s: and aggressively save
620.96s: now instead of having five thousand
622.64s: dollars of principal i might have
624.16s: ten twenty fifty and if i can
627.60s: execute the same way with
630.64s: that as i did with that five thousand
632.24s: dollar account with that fifty thousand
634.24s: dollars
635.44s: all of a sudden the paradigm changes and
637.60s: this becomes a very powerful concept
640.16s: focus on consistency with these smaller
643.36s: accounts
645.12s: again the idea isn't to turn this into
647.92s: your next car
648.96s: or house just focus on getting the
652.08s: consistency down because as your account
654.72s: grows in value that consistency is going
656.88s: to become
657.52s: invaluable that's the kind of skill set
660.88s: that allows you to retire early while
663.52s: continuing to earn
664.88s: money on your money that's in the
667.20s: account
667.92s: so that you're not actively drawing on
669.76s: it to live you're making more so you can
671.68s: live off of that while preserving
673.28s: principle
674.32s: that allows you to enable um existing
676.96s: through drawdowns
678.80s: again think deep game here it's
682.00s: really important if you start too
683.76s: nearsighted with this stuff
685.44s: um you're gonna piss a lot of money away
687.44s: like the vast majority of active traders
689.76s: do
691.04s: all right that about wraps up the small
693.20s: stack segment it's been fun
694.96s: um it's interesting taking a look at
696.72s: these because it is i said it before
699.12s: it's like tetris it's like
700.32s: a puzzle trying to solve because there's
703.36s: no great trade-offs and you kind of have
705.52s: to just accept
708.24s: trade-offs that you might not normally
709.76s: make in your margin account but it's a
711.44s: good exercise nonetheless
713.68s: like i said i'm planning on another
716.00s: version of this so let me know if
717.92s: there's a specific style that would make
719.60s: sense for you all
720.80s: and otherwise i'll talk to everyone
722.64s: later
