0.00s:  What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the LR podcast. I have Jared here today to essentially
8.32s:  let everybody know how messed up we all are in the head. I'm sure you have no shortage
13.32s:  of insights into that side of the world. But before we get into talking about the psychology
19.20s:  of trading, kind of the correlations that you found between different things like I seek
24.28s:  off clubs. I know that there's some betting side of the stuff trading side. There's a lot
29.08s:  of different ways to talk about the mindset and the human psyche, which interestingly enough,
34.24s:  Marines were not really the smartest group around, but we actually are pretty introspective.
40.00s:  We like to spend a lot of time understanding what makes us tick. So I'm actually really,
44.00s:  really eager to chat with you. So first, thanks for coming to hang out for a little bit.
47.48s:  Yeah, happy to be here, man. Good to chat about this stuff. I know it's important for
51.44s:  a lot of people that sometimes I don't always have a framework to understand it well.
56.56s:  We'll see. Well, and that's actually a great starting point to be honest, because before
61.32s:  we get into your background, we'll just kind of jump right in. One of the things I find
65.08s:  so interesting is for newer traders, when you hear people talk about trading psychology,
70.84s:  it sounds like the hogwash. It sounds like just this random stuff that's in the ether
76.12s:  around the world of trading. And then once you trade for a while, you realize like at
80.88s:  least in my opinion, there's no amount of psychology that will inherently create edge.
87.76s:  You have to have some sort of system that is profitable, but you could have a very profitable
92.32s:  system. And if you don't have the correct psychological constitution to execute it,
97.36s:  good as it. So I actually wanted to talk to you about that. What comes first, the chicken
102.80s:  or the egg, the edge of the psychology? The edge. 100%. I mean, like military training,
110.24s:  I mean, I know it offhand, not directly. They're training you to thrive in situations where
119.04s:  you might die. And so the standard for that training is really, really high. So that your
125.44s:  emotions are not going to do something that's going to get you killed. But I'm sure there's
131.20s:  plenty of situations where that's not feasible. And somebody gets injured and so trading
138.32s:  is no different. Like the training though often happens in the live market. There isn't really
144.32s:  a good simulator that can actually help to inoculate you to that environment. So early on,
150.80s:  traders are just feeling their way around. Meanwhile, there's just a huge swings in their
155.20s:  emotions. But those huge swings in emotions, I think are largely to do with the fact that
160.72s:  they have no idea what they're doing. And so you really need to have a very robust strategy.
169.12s:  It does not have to be wildly profitable yet. But you have to have something that you can kind of
175.12s:  anchor yourself to in order to then be able to tease out. Where are my emotions actually affecting
181.52s:  my execution? Because when you are too new and don't have that, then it's easy to get sort of
188.16s:  swept up in the frustration from losing. But like that frustration might be because you don't know
193.84s:  what the F you're doing. And the fear might be because you don't know what the F you're doing.
200.00s:  And so to not have a lot of confidence in is correct to get overconfident and think you know
206.64s:  what you're doing is going to be really, really damaging. So the humility to be able to say
213.12s:  like I need to establish a clear understanding of what I'm doing technically, strategically first
221.20s:  is really, really important. There's definitely people in this space who say that trading is all
226.08s:  about psychology and they are absolutely full of shit. There's no amount of tactics that
234.32s:  can be replaced. There's no amount of mentality that can be replaced from
238.16s:  poor tactics. I mean, the mentality, the mental game can only help to bring out
245.20s:  you know what you know, it can't create it. What a what a great way to frame it. And you mentioned
251.44s:  another thing there to dovetail off of it slightly. And you mentioned like this, you know,
254.96s:  level of like overconfidence at some point. I've always been really interested in just research.
262.72s:  Just enjoy reading different kind of stuff. You can find off of SSRN. There's a great paper
267.52s:  that's called the behavior of individual investors. Anybody that's familiar with my work will know.
271.76s:  I've cited that a million times. So I think everybody should read it. One of the things they talk
274.80s:  about in there is the Dunning-Croover effect. And I'm sure you're familiar with that.
281.84s:  When there's this really interesting thing though, where I feel like people can be familiar
287.60s:  with the Dunning-Croover effect. But I don't think familiarity with it stops people from still
294.24s:  falling over that same edge. Do you think that there's some method for traders that and for those
301.36s:  unfamiliar, well, maybe you could talk a little about the Dunning-Croover effect first in your lens
304.80s:  and then we can move on to the second part. Yeah. So Dunning-Croover effect has two sides.
309.76s:  You know, one is that you don't even know what you don't know. And so as a result, you become,
315.92s:  you know, overconfident. And you know, I would classify these people in the
325.04s:  American Idol contestants who like have no concept of like what, you know, elite level singing looks
333.04s:  like. And so they've kind of been in this like bubble. They've gotten all the sort of positive feedback
339.60s:  because people, you know, need to get positive feedback. It need to have that belief in all those
344.56s:  affirmations, yada yada yada, well, they're, you know, delusional. They do not have the skill
351.52s:  to be able to properly determine where they rank. And so they naturally become overconfident.
357.04s:  And interestingly enough, there's also a lot of research that describes how prevalent
361.12s:  overconfidence is in Western society. And I don't mean that it's not, doesn't exist in
366.08s:  Eastern cultures as well. It's just, it's been researched more here. And so, you know, around 70% of people
374.00s:  rate themselves as having above average intelligence, above average sense of humor, level of attractiveness.
381.12s:  So, you know, and that doesn't account for the people who are on the other side of the
387.20s:  Dunning-Furrier Effect, which is those who are undervaluing what they bring to the table. So,
391.76s:  it might not be 20% of people overconfident. It might be even higher than that. So,
397.20s:  yeah, the other side of the Dunning-Furrier Effect is people who have a ton of skill, who end up
402.88s:  having lower confidence because they falsely assume that everybody else knows what they know and
407.60s:  what they have is just not that worthwhile. So, what this really helps to show us is that
411.60s:  confidence is not causal, right? Being confident for the sake of being confident, you know, could
417.28s:  actually be quite dangerous. Because I have clients who, you know, are new and they objectively have more
424.08s:  confidence than some of my other clients who've been doing this for 30 years. And that should not
429.84s:  be. I mean, there's not a single chance in the world that if I was asked who I would bet on,
434.88s:  making more money in 2025, that I would bet on the two-year newer trader. So, confidence is not
441.68s:  causal. And we're really looking at kind of the underpinnings of your competency because that is
448.16s:  ideally what should align your confidence. Super interesting. And obviously, you've spent a lot of time
455.12s:  both. You've written a couple books, analyzing a lot of the psychology of trading. And you obviously
460.64s:  have your client base. So, you have a good sample of people that you've looked at. One of the things
465.44s:  that I've always found so interesting is that there's this effect. It's obviously so obvious. But
472.80s:  I just, I can't understand a way around it. The effect is if you are talking to that two-year
480.00s:  trader and you're explaining to them, the stove is hot. If you touch the stove, you're going to burn
484.64s:  yourself. And yet, there are still, there's that compulsion to like have to touch the stove.
491.84s:  Like, you can't just take it second hand from somebody. Like, what is that? And is there a way
498.16s:  to coach people so that you actually can effectively learn lessons, you know, second hand without
504.64s:  having to touch everything yourself? Yeah, I mean, some people are just experiential learners.
510.24s:  And I would put myself in that category. If I'm going to learn a concept, I need to have kind of
516.40s:  some experience to really be able to kind of anchor that concept too. So I can kind of learn it
522.80s:  first, but very quickly, my mind is going to kind of start to wander and not really be
527.92s:  that interested in like reading more concept. Like, I need to just go experience it. And I need to go
532.24s:  touch that stove. In trading, you can touch the stove. Make sure it's not like burning hot. It's
538.32s:  actually going to like, you know, create, you know, six degree burns. You can scale down this thing
544.96s:  so you can gain experience at very, very low cost and very, very low pain. But like, gives you the
551.60s:  ability to kind of stick your hand on the water and feel around and get a sense of it, gain some
556.16s:  experience. So yeah, there are some people that just you just cannot learn everything from the
561.04s:  sidelines. You can gain concepts. You can gain wisdom experience, gain knowledge from other
566.96s:  people's experience. But then you have to then go and start to translate it for yourself. And
572.08s:  then ultimately developing your own fingerprint, your own style as a trader. So yeah, some of it
578.24s:  is just that. But I think maybe more to your question is the people that have already started to
584.96s:  put their hand on the stove and they themselves feel the heat and they get burned. But then they
591.92s:  keep doing it again. And that is a bit more complicated. Now we're getting into, you know, more of
600.56s:  the kind of the underlying drivers with which compels us to do things. So for example, a lot of
607.92s:  traders get into this enterprise or I should say a lot of people, they're not traders yet. A lot of
613.68s:  people get into this enterprise looking to make money quickly, looking to make easy money,
618.56s:  thinking that they can, you know, they see stuff on Instagram elsewhere, you know, driving
623.44s:  lambo's and beach houses and finer on the world and yadda yadda. Well, I want that to. And
629.60s:  truly there are no different than somebody who is, you know, going to buy a powerball ticket.
634.72s:  But they are convincing themselves that it's, you know, more of a skill, which it is, but they're
641.28s:  not actually interested in acquiring the skill. So, you know, where this is going to show up mostly
646.24s:  and then just kind of continuing to touch that fire, it's, you know, phoma, but something's ripping,
651.28s:  you know, don't get in unless you have like a viable setup and if you missed it, like, all right,
656.72s:  it sucks. Stay out, hold your capital and wait for another opportunity that's going to present
662.16s:  itself. Like, no, I want to make money quickly and easily. This seems like an opportunity to do that.
669.60s:  And that compulsion, right, to objectively, you and I might say, well, you're actually sticking
675.68s:  your hand right on that stove again. To them, they're blinded by that desire to make money quickly
682.48s:  and easily. And that blocks out any perception in the moment that there is any, any danger, right,
688.56s:  to them. It's just like, no, no, this, this still goes gold. Like, I have to put it up my hand on it
692.88s:  in order to grab something. So that, that's just like one example of where, you know, those underlying
697.60s:  flaws bias is wishes illusions can compel us to do some dumb things. So what got you interested in
706.40s:  like the psychological element of the world, really? Because again, like we were talking about
710.88s:  in the beginning, it's not really relegated to just trading. You have actually a pretty varied
714.64s:  background. Yes, I've worked with golfers and poker players and, you know, professional gamblers,
719.92s:  sports bettors, eSport athletes, pool players, radiologists, lawyers, doctors, you know, business
726.00s:  people. So it is like the psychology of performance. And what got you interested in it was like my
733.36s:  own mental hangups trying to, you know, play professionally as a golfer. 97 tried to qualify for the
739.52s:  U.S. Open played amazingly well, T-Degreene. Now, the U.S. Open has to, to, you know, kind of rounds
746.48s:  qualifying. This is the first round. So it's not like I'm, you know, I was like on the doorstep
750.24s:  to actually playing in the open, but, you know, at 18, like I was close to, and that second stage,
757.28s:  like you're playing with PGA tour players, like this is, this is real. And, you know, I missed a
762.80s:  bunch of puts, you know, of this line where, you know, putting it was my weakness, but, you know,
766.88s:  the pressure really kind of got to me. And that was the first time that I'd ever played an event
770.96s:  of that magnitude. I'd gotten good very, very quickly. Having been, you know, a baseball player,
776.24s:  tennis player, and, you know, kind of chose golf because I was 4-11 as a freshman in high school,
780.80s:  and, you know, figured out my prospects of playing professionally in that sport was going to be a
785.28s:  little bit higher than baseball and tennis. So I just kind of dove into it, we got a good
790.24s:  real quickly. And then, you know, suddenly you have it as position where it's like, wow, you're
794.32s:  like, you're on the doorsteps of living a dream. And, you know, basically just kind of put them
798.80s:  on my shoes. So it happens once, like it's not that big a deal, but then in the, in the U.S.
804.00s:  San qualifier later that year, same thing happens, like just play it awful. And, and now, you know,
809.20s:  the kind of pattern starts to take hold. And I, you know, just like dove into golf psychology,
814.00s:  read a bunch of books and try to find answers to this issue. And generally speaking, my performance
819.76s:  continued to elevate. Now, I was, this was like the summer after my freshman year of college.
825.12s:  And I had won two events at freshman year and, you know, won a few more of the following year. And
829.92s:  was an all-american in Division III, continuing to get better except, you know, when I would step
836.24s:  out and play in some of these big, you know, events that were more aligned with my longer term dreams.
841.84s:  And so at that point, you know, I was like, all right, well, I'm not one to get kind of like,
846.08s:  you know, try something. I wasn't going to turn professional without really feeling like I had
850.88s:  an answer to this. And so I decided actually to derail my aspirations at that point and go and get
858.64s:  a master's degree in counseling psychology. What I reasoned was missing from the sort of sports
864.88s:  psychology, golf psychology equation at that point was an understanding of the causality.
870.08s:  A lot of what I was reading, a lot of what was being expressed was very kind of behavioral in nature,
875.20s:  meaning like you're feeling too much pressure. We're going to teach you to relax. You're not
878.64s:  feeling confident enough. We're going to boost your confidence. You're getting angry when you get
881.60s:  to calm down. It was to me kind of ones and zeros. And as I said, it worked, but not under the most
887.68s:  intense pressure, heat and stress where any weakness is going to get magnified and ultimately
892.96s:  affect you. But therapists, right, their job is to dive deep and to problem solve at very
899.92s:  personal levels. And you know, at the time I was thinking, maybe this was personal, what I've
905.12s:  come to find out find out is it's not always personal. It's more of these performance flaws,
911.84s:  biases, wishes, illusions, how we're perceiving ourselves, our skill sets, the environment,
917.68s:  our competitors, et cetera, those misperceptions, the flaws in which we're sort of seeing
923.52s:  you know, all of those factors ultimately create the emotional volatility. Now yes, there can be
929.20s:  personal issues that are, you know, that can be part of the equation there. It doesn't have to be.
935.84s:  So I get my master's degree from Northeastern, you know, spend two years getting licensed as a therapist,
942.08s:  and then as soon as that happens, you know, July 20, 2005, I basically now like beginning to kind
948.88s:  of incorporate my system or beginning to build my system, which is combining those two things.
954.88s:  And I moved Arizona, start working with golfers at a local club and start building up a roster,
961.36s:  worked with a gal who, you know, won on the LPGA tour, few other professionals, some other good
965.68s:  junior players. But ultimately kind of found traction in professional poker. There was a big
971.44s:  enough base of people who understood that if they were not sharp, they were going to lose money.
979.12s:  And you know, golfers have a way of kind of convincing themselves that, you know, that it's more about,
984.96s:  you know, hitting the range and hitting the punting green and working on their technique, which,
988.00s:  again, we talked about is important. But ultimately when, you know, there's enough
993.20s:  impairing your judgment is not just about that anymore. So, you know, started building up a
999.36s:  big roster of clients in poker wrote a book in 2011, meant like a poker. And in 2013,
1005.44s:  shortly after my second poker book came out, traders started picking up the first one, saying,
1010.08s:  you know, if you change the word poker to trading, it all went the same stuff. So I start building
1014.96s:  up a roster of traders and, you know, bland and institutional quiet where I'm flying in person,
1020.16s:  working with 40 of their traders over the course of four or five days and doing sessions all day
1025.12s:  and, you know, really kind of diving into that and, you know, start building up a roster of
1028.40s:  retail traders and, you know, independent people and some other opportunities along those lines.
1034.24s:  landed gig with team liquid, which is one of the largest esport teams organizations in the
1039.68s:  world working with the Dota teams and Counter-Strike teams. And again, environments where I'm not,
1045.04s:  you know, an expert in golf is my, you know, primary of expertise, air of expertise, but I
1050.16s:  translated what I did there into poker, into trading, into esports, you know, and then into
1055.44s:  other areas and, you know, in doing that have really kind of honed my system, you know, over all
1060.80s:  these years. And yeah, it applies in every environment. There's obviously unique applications,
1067.20s:  but at the end of the day comes down to, you know, us being human beings and, you know, we're just not
1072.88s:  that unique. We're not that special. At this point, you know, there's just not a lot of novelty in
1078.08s:  the underlying causality of what I see. There's a lot of variety and uniqueness of the people that I
1084.32s:  work with and the way that they experience those problems, but at the end of the day, it's just not
1088.80s:  that unique. We're not that special. Right. And obviously, you still have clubs to swing around. So
1095.44s:  how did golf end up going for you? 2007. This is sort of an interesting kind of note. Like,
1102.96s:  I firmly kind of solved my issues at that point, was playing some of the best golf in my life.
1108.08s:  So we're playing some mini tour events, you know, kind of the minor leagues of golf.
1112.80s:  And, you know, not doing terribly great, but like started to see some signs that like, okay, you know,
1119.76s:  I'm ready to kind of give this a go. You know, you kind of estimated that point. It's about, you know,
1124.40s:  250 grand over three years of, you know, travel expenses, training, etc. to really make it worthwhile.
1130.32s:  Obviously a big expense. Didn't have the capital. Probably could go find it. But poker is like
1135.12s:  ripping. Like things are taken off. It's like, okay, you know, here's the fork in the road. I could
1139.76s:  take a risk on myself or I could continue to kind of go down this path and see, you know, and maybe
1145.76s:  I'll have another opportunity. Because truly, like at that point, like poker was the same for bed.
1152.40s:  So, you know, I still played at high level, you know, even more recently, this is, you know, now 20 years
1157.68s:  later. And truly what I've kind of come to is I love the game. But I'm incredibly happy with
1167.04s:  the coaching practice that I've developed and the work that I do. And yeah, I think I would not be
1172.80s:  as as fulfilled as a person. If I was a professional golfer, I'm certain I'd be happy. I'm not saying
1178.16s:  that I wouldn't be happy, you know, having to live out a dream. But, you know, the road that's
1184.00s:  taken me here is uncovered aspects of my character, my personality, my ultimately my intelligence,
1188.88s:  that I just never would have found otherwise. It turns out I was dyslexic. Didn't know that as a kid.
1194.72s:  You know, didn't really know it till I was in my 30s, which explains why, you know, education was
1199.44s:  challenging. Frankly, even now golf was challenging. I'm not saying that was the cause of my pressure,
1204.16s:  but certainly the way in which I made decisions out there was a little affected. So, having, you know,
1209.68s:  uncovered a lot about myself, you know, through this has really been, I think a big source of what
1219.68s:  validates and fulfills me today, because I work at my own everyday coaching as now my primary
1226.32s:  area of performance. And I take my work incredibly seriously and, you know, want to be the best I can
1231.12s:  be with it. Yeah, that's super cool. It's it's also really interesting to find, you know, the original
1237.04s:  idea of what we think the journey is going to look like and then kind of accepting the pivots as
1241.92s:  they come reminds me of I'm really big into martial arts and jujitsu's, you know, obviously part of
1248.00s:  that game. And there was a famous teacher, John Danahar, and he's very similar to this where he's
1256.80s:  not like personally had a massive jujitsu level career. He's successful, but he's not like some sort
1263.28s:  of renowned jujitsu player or anything like that, but he's the people that he coach now are essentially
1268.72s:  the best in the world. So he definitely, it sounds similar to you like found his calling. He found
1275.36s:  the thing where he really enjoys it, which is it's just always cool, you know, to to see that match
1281.36s:  up with people. Totally. And sometimes, you know, the criticisms of people in my, you know, spot or,
1292.00s:  you know, like the guy that you're just mentioning, you know, it's like those who can't teach,
1296.80s:  but the reality is that those that you those that do oftentimes can't teach, right? Tiger Woods is
1302.80s:  awful, is an awful golf coach. He would be a terrible coach to most most golfers. Right. Just be
1307.44s:  better. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Yeah. He's good. He's good with other professionals because they kind of
1312.24s:  talk the same language, but when there's a huge skill gap, he's not capable of really filling it.
1317.92s:  So yeah, it kind of takes somebody, and I think what I've been able to bring to poker and trading,
1324.32s:  you know, specifically is like almost like an anthropologist, sociologist, kind of perspective,
1329.28s:  where I've really like researched, you know, the way in which traders talk and experience these issues.
1337.04s:  And, you know, ideally kind of reflecting back to you, you know, where some of the big holes are.
1342.72s:  And I'll just throw one example out here, and I'll kind of turn the tip back to you. Like with FOMO,
1348.64s:  FOMO is an awful term because it's really, really imprecise. People talk about it like it's a problem.
1355.04s:  But, you know, if you went to the doctor and the doctor said, you know, we weren't feeling well and
1360.08s:  something was wrong. You know, it's clearly something was wrong. And he said, you know what, Eric,
1363.60s:  you're sick. Like, well, what does that mean? Like, you're sick. You know, just go home and get well.
1371.12s:  I mean, like, obviously that would be a horrendous doctor. You'd never go back to again. Right.
1376.56s:  When a lot of traders say that they have FOMO, they're effectively saying the same thing. It's so imprecise
1382.48s:  that you're not really able to correct it. Right. Once you start to peel back the layers and understand
1387.60s:  that, you know, anger and overconfidence and alacaconfidence and fear can all produce FOMO,
1394.96s:  then we got, we've got an, you know, an avanus for being able to dissect it in how you experience it
1401.36s:  because that is what matters to being able to correct it. So things like that, even like greed. I mean,
1406.48s:  greed, your job is to make money. Like, is, is Tigerwood was Tigerwood's greedy because he wanted to win,
1415.84s:  you know, every major championship and every tournament and practically did. Like, oh, we, of course,
1420.80s:  he praised and it like Patrick Mahomes was not greedy trying to win a third Super Bowl on a row.
1426.72s:  Right. Didn't do it, but that doesn't make him greedy. So you're not greedy when you try to make more
1431.20s:  money. You're greedy when the execution of your tactics go beyond what you know is sound. Right. When
1440.32s:  Patrick tries to make an aggressive throw into traffic, like, maybe we could say he was a little bit
1446.80s:  greedy early on. I'm not, again, it's to him, it's for him to decide. Right. Armchair quarterbacks,
1452.64s:  not really that great analysis, but the point is like, the greed is a determination based off of
1458.48s:  where your strategy got excessive, not based off of some, you know, like overarching idea that is bad.
1466.24s:  Right. Traders make, you know, your job is to make money. That's the same thing as Tiger or Patrick
1471.12s:  trying to win championships. It's so funny that you pivoted to greed because I literally wrote it
1476.72s:  down in my notebook to mention that one next. And it's because the funniest thing I find about greed
1483.12s:  is a lot of traders. I don't think it's actually the correct terminology, but I always call it like
1488.80s:  false attribution where they'll say, oh, I, you know, I got greedy so blank happened. And to your
1496.16s:  exact point, I always think of it from the perspective of, okay, yeah, there might be an element of
1500.64s:  that. But what about like, where was the presence of a plan of like an actual profit management point
1506.48s:  loss management point like these things that are typically predefined before you enter a trade,
1510.64s:  that kind of just sort circuits the greed. It doesn't matter necessarily if it's there. If you already
1515.12s:  have these areas pointed, the main thing is just to echo your broader point where it's like, I feel
1520.16s:  like a lot of times people arrive at like these superficial answers that they think sound smart
1524.96s:  and self, you know, revealing, but really it's still just like the very tip of the iceberg. So to turn
1531.92s:  up and a lot of times that happens because people can't tolerate uncertainty to say, I don't know
1537.60s:  why this happened is way harder to tolerate because like you'd rather know something,
1543.92s:  you'd rather attach yourself to a false idea for the sake of not feeling unsure. And frankly,
1550.00s:  like if you're unsure of something, that means you're you're in a position where you actually can
1554.64s:  learn. Again, it goes back to that false confidence, right? If you're one of those people who are
1559.12s:  overconfident, in this case overconfident, you're voted to dissect and diagnose your trading
1564.32s:  issues, well, then you're going to be in a position where you're never uncertain, which means you're
1568.48s:  never going to learn. What an interesting point. It'd be yeah, it just kind of becomes this vicious
1574.96s:  cycle that feeds on itself, which is the follow up. Yeah, the follow up I wanted to ask you there,
1582.00s:  which is so I feel like traders go through this series where they get to the point where they
1588.72s:  feel like they're self identifying these issues, right? Like I'm greedy. And that's what caused
1593.68s:  this to go bad. But obviously as we're talking about a lot of times, that's actually quite superficial.
1599.36s:  What are some methods that you use to help traders move past that superficial top level analysis
1607.52s:  into the actual positive attribution of like what's the the feeding forces that are leading to this
1614.48s:  behavior? Yeah, so I'd say easiest way to do that is what I call a data collection worksheet.
1620.16s:  Okay. Freely available on my website, geratandlow.com, backslashworksheets.
1625.84s:  But like the basic ideas are pretty basic. So you're identifying in real time around your
1631.52s:  trading mistakes, the triggers for that what you think is greed or at least your emotions,
1637.52s:  the thoughts that you have in that moment, whether they're in your head or things you say out loud,
1644.08s:  you know, trying to kind of peel back the emotion, right? Describe what the emotion is in that moment.
1650.00s:  Describe the actions or the behaviors or the physical sensations you feel at that time, right? Are you
1654.96s:  kind of just like walked into a one chart when you should be having a book or kind of
1660.56s:  zoomed out focus? Are you toggling down to lower time frames? Yeah, are you just like turning off
1669.36s:  certain factors, you know, or indicators that might help you? How does your perception of the
1675.36s:  market change? How does your perception of your positions change? How does your perception of
1679.36s:  your own strategy change? Be very, very detailed and capturing as much data as you can. You might not
1684.96s:  get all of those points at any one time, but you get like two or three. Well now all of a sudden you
1689.76s:  start to create some some data that's going to help you gather more data, right? In other situations,
1695.76s:  or in suit with clients, they'll have them print this out or have it on their computer and,
1700.32s:  you know, situation comes up where, right, they feel that film, they feel that greed, they feel
1704.40s:  that fear of losing the revenge trading, whatever, right? They are capturing as much data as they can
1710.56s:  in real time. After the trading days over, they'll go back, review it, add any additional notes they
1715.04s:  can. You do this day over day, all of a sudden now, there's going to be start, you're going to start
1719.84s:  to see some patterning, you're going to see if you see some repetition. And frankly, like I wrote
1724.16s:  the mental game of trading, help like within mind that you could find like kind of comparing the
1731.44s:  data you find with what you see in the book. And then the book can help to kind of walk you through,
1736.96s:  you know, what might be underlying those particular issues. Yes, you could obviously spend some
1741.52s:  time reflecting asking yourself some questions and trying to figure out why you're experiencing what
1746.08s:  you're experiencing and get good answers. But the book, right, I'd say captures about 80% of what
1752.16s:  traders are experiencing. So it's definitely a little bit of a cheat code to be able to kind of
1756.48s:  dissect it for yourself, because I've given you a little bit of a road map to be able to do that.
1760.72s:  Yeah, that's, it's super interesting. And another question I have dovetailing off of this idea
1766.32s:  of self analysis. And this might be a little bit of the caveman side of my brain. But I've,
1773.52s:  I've always found the juxtaposition between analysis and actually like root cause analysis to be
1781.28s:  useful. But then I feel like there's another layer of that where it's over analysis, where we're
1787.76s:  just like almost analyzing new problems into creation. Is that something that you've seen at all? And
1795.20s:  if so, like what are some methods for people to conduct effective analysis where they're getting
1800.80s:  to an answer? And then they're confident in this answer and then able to move on to, you know,
1805.76s:  the next piece. Well, the key word you said is confident. They can do an answer and they're actually
1811.20s:  not confident. It's the same reason why traders system hop, right? Whether they're continually looking
1815.44s:  for kind of the next best thing because there's not a base of confidence that's being established.
1822.32s:  And ultimately, as I said before, it needs to come through competency, right? Your confidence is
1828.32s:  most aligned with your competence when it's, when it's effective, when it's grounded. So,
1835.92s:  you know, if you're continuing to over analyze, then you have to come back and ask yourself like,
1842.72s:  do I feel like I have the skill to properly determine whether or not this is the problem or not?
1850.24s:  And if the answer is yes, then you have to invariably trust that first answer and then go research
1858.72s:  and test whether or not you were right or not. If the answer is I'm not sure or no, then get better
1864.96s:  at that analysis first before you go and start analyzing another problem because like, it doesn't
1870.88s:  mean or if you might choose to analyze another problem, but you're doing so in the spirit of trying
1876.56s:  to maybe solve something but also get better at that analysis. Like there's kind of two parts to it.
1882.64s:  You know, as a trader, as an independent, you don't have the ability to, well, I mean,
1890.40s:  that's why people hire me, right? It's like to kind of bring them on your team. But like,
1894.80s:  we know if you're on a sports team, right? You have people naturally around you who you rely on to
1902.16s:  do that diagnosis. What really good coaches are able to do? Not just help you to analyze, but also
1909.12s:  figure out from a training standpoint how to be better, how to solve those issues. And if it's
1913.76s:  something mechanical, they'll find experts to fill those gaps and I mean, really good coaches
1920.24s:  know what not to focus on so that you can really zone in and focus on what you do. When you're trying
1925.68s:  to be a coach for yourself, from a mentality standpoint, from a risk management standpoint,
1931.12s:  from a technical standpoint, it's hard to kind of toggle between those. But it sort of begins with
1936.24s:  the honesty to say like, all right, you know what? I'm not very good at this thing yet. So let me just
1941.04s:  keep practicing and not kind of getting accessible. I think that's a way of slowing down that extra
1948.16s:  analysis. Yeah, that's super useful. It's interesting. Another thing I've come across that I'm
1956.24s:  interested your perspective on are looking to achieve things either. I don't know the correct
1962.16s:  terminology, but when you're trying to achieve something to achieve the thing or when you're trying
1966.88s:  to achieve the thing to avoid failure, I don't know the correct, I don't know what that's called, but
1972.32s:  it's not a problem. Yeah, I know I know either. Yeah, okay. Well, whatever that thing is,
1977.60s:  is that something that you've analyzed across your clients and have you come across any
1984.32s:  commonalities between specifically the trading world where if it's more effective when people
1989.92s:  are trying to hit something because they want to hit this versus avoid that or vice versa,
1994.96s:  they're both effective. The fear of failure, the fear of losing, the fear of being destitute,
2001.44s:  the fear of not being able to pay your mortgage and have your, like all those things, the hatred of
2006.72s:  losing, like all those things, like the all the avoidance motivators can be very, very effective.
2012.48s:  However, they're limited when, you know, like you're actually successful. I mean, Jordan,
2019.92s:  Michael Jordan was famous for constantly needing people to think less of him and to slight him and
2026.32s:  to find that anger, that's what allowed him to be his absolute best. But he had to like create it,
2034.80s:  and he had to mentally manipulate his mind, and he was an expert at being able to do that. It's
2039.36s:  hard for mortals to do that reliably and continue to find failure and fear at a high level. So,
2050.00s:  invariably, you know, they'll kind of go through those ways of like, all right, don't fuck up,
2055.52s:  don't fail, and then you're like, oh, okay, I can breathe the end. And then you've got to fall back
2059.84s:  down to earth only to kind of find that next pivot. It's like, well, what's going to keep you kind of
2064.00s:  continuing to thrive? Some people are much more motivated by their aspirations. And so, yes, I think
2071.52s:  when you have a more pure motivation towards your goals, towards what you want to accomplish,
2077.76s:  there is an independence to that, right? You're not relying on external outcomes to drive it.
2084.32s:  But sometimes maybe you're not as aspirational as you could be because what you envisioned,
2089.60s:  your own potential to be, is based off of your own perception of yourself, which could actually
2095.20s:  be too well, right? You might be capable of making eight figures a year or eight figures period
2102.64s:  and building that kind of wealth. But if you're only kind of aiming lower because you have a
2108.48s:  strange relationship with money because you grew up poor or your parents weren't super supportive,
2114.64s:  and so you're having a little bit of that imposter syndrome, when you're having success, well,
2119.84s:  then that undervaluing may not give you the sort of authentic real aspirations. So, there's not
2128.80s:  kind of a one-size-fits-all that's going to help everybody. I think the end of the day is like,
2133.44s:  once you achieve some success and you find that you maybe need to be a bit more aspirational and
2140.08s:  less defensive in a sense, or you need to be more offensively minded, a little bit more
2148.24s:  in that kind of corrective place to fix some of the faulty perspectives you have to yourself.
2155.84s:  So, you can actually be more offensive. Everybody's got to figure out their own mixture and formula
2164.56s:  for what's going to allow them to be successful. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all option,
2168.88s:  can I solve it for everyone? Sure, sure. So, then essentially, you haven't found some sort of
2175.12s:  stronger correlation or output if somebody is acting out of fear-based incentives versus aspirational,
2182.32s:  it's kind of just very specific to the individual. Yeah, got it. And I was smiling before because you
2188.08s:  started doing that thing again where I, in my defense, I wrote this one down earlier, but it was
2193.76s:  the very next thing I was going to move on to that you naturally started blending us into.
2197.92s:  Which is this idea of trying to balance like thinking big, right? Aspirations, trying to not
2204.16s:  glass ceiling yourself, but then also being realistic and balancing the ever-present, you know,
2213.04s:  potential for failure. So, for traders, are there any tips or tricks that you have with respect
2221.60s:  to helping them figure out like what the right focus is, what the right target is, which obviously
2228.96s:  will be highly personalized and commensurate with individual performance capabilities, but from
2234.24s:  a broader perspective. I think the biggest thing is not getting emotionally attached to the bigger
2239.60s:  vision. That's where your energy, when it get, or your emotions, when they get too attached to
2248.08s:  those bigger aspirations that they can cause a lot of problems. And I think people having done that
2253.92s:  before, maybe in other environments, and having gotten whacked and not being successful as they wanted
2259.52s:  to, and they end up kind of naturally like aiming lower, right? Because they don't want to get swept
2267.52s:  up in that emotionality. So, you're really kind of band-aid in the problem by like not engaging it
2275.44s:  versus like, no, have those massive aspirations, but use them to guide you to understand
2283.44s:  like what's required in the next month, three months, six months, or as far out as you can plan.
2288.56s:  Generally, you know, you get a year-out, like you're kind of making estimates and it's,
2292.56s:  you know, general ideas. But like that's where your nose needs to be. Like on the grindstone,
2298.08s:  doing the work day to day, really expanding your precision with your execution, with your
2303.20s:  improvement with your learning, whatever mentality, technical, risk management, right? All that is
2308.56s:  what matters day to day. But sometimes having those bigger aspirations out there can place
2316.56s:  greater demands on your time, help to make you make better choices. I'm not saying you have to have
2322.64s:  them, right? You're, you can, you know, want trading to be like a really nice side income that's
2328.32s:  going to give you the ability to take your family out on like one nice trip a year. And that that's
2332.56s:  your aspiration. Awesome. Like, you know, make it happen. But the same thing is true. Like, you know,
2338.48s:  like what's required, what figure out what is required to reach that outcome? You know, best way I
2343.60s:  could describe this is like results and process fit together, right? Results demand a certain process,
2350.48s:  which you're not really sure what it is yet. But you'll know based on the results, you know,
2355.60s:  over enough time, right? Did I do enough to achieve my goal? No. Okay. Well, let's retool and figure
2361.36s:  out. Yes. Cool. Okay. Well, what's next? And so results and process fit together. It's not like
2367.44s:  a long journey. It's a journey with many destinations and those destinations that are predetermined
2373.68s:  give you feedback on your process. Right? If it's just process with no outcome, I mean,
2379.52s:  then there's kind of no wrong answers, right? Theoretically. So we want to have the ability to know
2384.56s:  whether or not your meeting targets are not, you know, but we don't want to be emotionally attached
2388.96s:  to those targets because that will like demotivate us or blind us to the realities of what's required
2394.64s:  to give us a chance of getting there. And if we fall short, fine, figure out and figure out how to
2399.60s:  fill that gap, right? Whether that means, you know, reaching outside of your immediate purview to
2405.36s:  do more research and find people who can help you to do that. Interesting. And you mentioned something
2412.08s:  in there that I'm really interested in, which is I found I'm a little more in that first group
2420.88s:  where I did grow up fairly poor. So my original goal was still at the time I considered really
2428.72s:  aggressive. Obviously, as I got close to it became pretty modest in nature. And I found myself for
2436.08s:  a long time telling myself like, I'm okay with blank, right? Whatever this thing is. And then I
2444.80s:  started to realize that part of that was essentially me lying to myself and just being comfortable with
2451.04s:  where I'm at because it's comfortable there. And that's the reality and the prospects of potentially
2455.84s:  reaching induces failure of potential and stuff like that. But I had like this really interesting
2460.72s:  just self reflection that I went through as I started identifying that. How do you guide people
2467.60s:  through that process of setting good goals, but making sure that the goals aren't based on comfort
2476.40s:  where if somebody says to you like, Jared, I am I'm completely comfortable with just my trading
2481.36s:  being the side income. Whereas if they had the potential for the trading to actually be the full
2486.16s:  time job, they would jump on it immediately. But they're concerned to make that jump.
2492.48s:  It's hard. I mean, I my you know, without talking to somebody, right? I think it's
2499.04s:  another part of the question. Without talking to somebody, it's hard to kind of know where a little
2505.44s:  bit of that BS lies, right? Where something's just a little bit off. You know, like you said two things
2512.88s:  that I'll challenge you specifically on and maybe gives those that are watching some ideas of like
2517.60s:  how to find this. But like write out your goals and then write out the wise behind your goals.
2522.80s:  And and if you find language that feels a little bit soft, feels a little bit, you know,
2528.40s:  wafer or undefined or unclear, well, then that's probably an indicator, right? So when you said,
2534.40s:  you know, I'm okay with X. That basically means that you're saying I'm okay being okay.
2540.64s:  That's truly what you want. Well, then cool. Okay, is enough. But is okay enough? Clearly it wasn't.
2550.72s:  That was one, two, I'm completely comfortable. Whenever time we add those superlatives or
2560.72s:  I don't know the right word is like an adjective on top of the comfort, it kind of tells us that
2566.72s:  we're trying to convince ourselves or something like I am comfortable with making this kind of
2573.28s:  money. I'm comfortable with the idea and I have evidence to prove that I'm completely comfortable.
2578.88s:  Are you? Are you trying to convince yourself of that?
2584.32s:  Those would be kind of a couple things to look at for. Yeah, super interesting. I
2589.52s:  very interesting, especially like the the add on language. That makes a lot of sense.
2593.44s:  I know that I don't have you for too much longer as you could tell. I literally can talk
2598.40s:  you you're off because as soon as you say stuff, more stuff gets written down and it's this vicious
2603.36s:  cycle for you. But don't worry. I may have promised you I'll keep it. But the next thing I wanted to
2608.96s:  talk to you though, one of the most fascinating things I find about trading is that it's it's
2613.92s:  like very holistic, meaning as a retail trader, you have to be researcher. You have to be the boss.
2619.68s:  You have to be the risk management department. You have to be this parser psychologist. You have to
2623.44s:  there's a lot of things you have to do and it feels like one of the things you mentioned earlier
2627.60s:  really stuck out with me, which is when you're dealing with some systems that add pressure,
2632.96s:  just about any of your weaknesses are going to eventually come to light. You're going to see them.
2639.28s:  Do you have any tips for traders as you know, they might be newer, not fully sure what their
2645.44s:  weaknesses might actually be yet because they don't know what they are. Do you have any tips for
2649.84s:  those kinds of people to become more self aware of what some of those weaknesses might be?
2655.04s:  Look at other things you've done seriously. Hobbies don't really count because it's not really
2659.28s:  going to draw them out. The things that you really cared about will give you at least some
2664.80s:  guideposts to maybe like you hate losing because you hated losing since you were a kid or you
2671.68s:  tend to feel a lot of pressure when you're taking tests or giving presentations or when you're really
2676.72s:  kind of under the heat. You're not really a confident person. You tend to be a little bit arrogant.
2684.16s:  You're a little procrastinator. You can see these patterns in elsewhere in your life and maybe they
2690.88s:  don't harm you in significant ways. They don't really kind of impair like you're happy and
2697.92s:  satisfied. But in trading, they're going to come out and they're going to be problem. So you can
2704.48s:  kind of start to get ahead of it before you even develop the sort of technical precision to have a
2709.76s:  strategy that's going to maybe show some of these problems to be damaging and costly in trading
2719.28s:  ahead of time. Especially the ones that are related to work ethic and responsibility and
2724.80s:  discipline, motivation, like those are ones you really want to get ahead of because they are
2732.00s:  absolutely going to slow you down. They'll be the barnacles on your ship here that reduce the
2737.60s:  friction or the increase friction and slow down your growth curve. So yeah, if you see any of that
2743.28s:  stuff, then absolutely get ahead of it. And it doesn't mean I'm not saying like work ethic in this
2749.84s:  space sometimes means like nose of the grindstone, you know, just full board. There is definitely a
2758.00s:  relationship where you got to start thinking about yourself as a performer. And you know, this is not
2764.80s:  like you're taking a test once like you're studying for the MCATs or studying for the GREs or whatever.
2771.52s:  This is not nine months of study before you start trading. I mean, I work for a handful of people
2777.68s:  that have done that, but they've already known that that is their style of learning. And they know
2784.00s:  that it works. You know, if you spend a year just studying before you start to enter the live market,
2792.16s:  you know, if you're not certain that that style is going to work, you are at risk of
2799.04s:  getting into the market with expectations that are way too high because I would think of the transfer
2806.08s:  from studying and preparing yourself and learning to the live market to like a funnel, right?
2815.92s:  Like you're only going to get a little bit through at a time, right? Our mind only has bandwidth
2821.12s:  for so much. And so when you feel like you're really strong command of certain ideas, concepts,
2827.60s:  etc. You know, in study or even in the Sim, it may not necessarily all just kind of copy-paced over.
2836.16s:  Right? It's going to take some time. So those faulty expectations are really damaging,
2842.56s:  you know, when you spend an inordinate amount of time studying before you actually,
2846.96s:  you know, kind of make the transfer. But that's just kind of one tip on top of the overall idea
2851.28s:  of what I was mentioning earlier and just kind of using past other performance environments to
2856.08s:  kind of help understand what what issues may affect you. Yeah, I love that. What a great way to
2862.88s:  try to add a little clarity to something that's truly ambiguous by using references like that,
2867.28s:  super smart. I have two questions left. We only have time for one. So I'll let you pick the one
2872.32s:  that you like the most. One of them is really boring. So I'm actually not even going to pitch that one to
2877.20s:  you. I'm happy to go away, Negron. I can I can answer questions in five seconds if we need to. So
2882.24s:  beautiful. Okay, then let's do that. What are the most common destructive behaviors you see in traders?
2893.04s:  I'll say assuming that they know the cause of their problems.
2899.52s:  Love that. What are the most common
2904.48s:  nefarious destructive behaviors for traders? The differentiation I'm making here is something that's
2912.16s:  commonly afflux people, but people don't know. It's a normal reflection, meaning that it's
2918.72s:  something that impacts a lot of people, but it's commonly overlooked.
2928.16s:  I mean, I want to say revenge trading, but I know it's so commonly talked about. So maybe we'll go
2933.04s:  like desperation. There is like such a deep desire because sometimes desperation where you're just
2943.84s:  really violating your rules in ways that feel so justified in the moment. You're either leveraging
2950.96s:  up, sizing up, eliminating stop losses, daily loss limits, etc. to sustain the hope that you can
2958.96s:  still make money today, make money in this trade, continue to move forward. There's not a lot of
2965.60s:  emotion that feels present in real time. There's just this compulsion that is like driving you to
2975.12s:  violate like all of your rules and it feels as I said, justified at the moment. So that's probably
2980.88s:  the one that like again, it's not always in a very emotional experience. Sometimes it could be
2984.96s:  filled with anger, but they're at the heart of that is a very strong weakness and confidence that
2991.20s:  underlies it. Interesting. Okay. Last one, easy one. What are some of the most common traits
2998.32s:  that you see in successful traders? I know you've answered this a million times, but you got to ask
3001.84s:  when you're talking to psychological dude. Same thing as anything else. You've got to have a love
3007.44s:  and a passion for it and that love and the passion translates into doing the work required. So
3013.36s:  it's the passion and the work ethic. I mean, it literally is no different than anything else. And
3018.48s:  the love and passion, some of you can't fake it. You can be infatuated by trading. You can
3028.08s:  really enjoy it and still be good at it. But in order for you to be great, you have to love it.
3034.88s:  It has to be like a part of you. And that means that you're going to be obsessed by it.
3040.00s:  And that obsession to others is going to look like gambling and being a workaholic and yada yada
3048.24s:  but again, nobody called tiger a workaholic. Nobody called Kobe and all the greats in any
3054.08s:  progression like workaholics. Like it's just that's what's required to achieve your goals. And
3060.64s:  you know, there are no choices at that point. Awesome. All right. I made a promise. I intend to keep it.
3067.84s:  I do have more questions written down, but I will get you on another time to continue diving in.
3074.88s:  As you could tell, there's two things that I really like to pull out from this. The way that you
3079.36s:  look at things, the way that you analyze the world and trying to give people some ways that they can
3084.00s:  adopt some of them. But I also think that you did a really great job and I'm appreciative of trying
3090.24s:  to open the lens for people about different factors that I guess is a lot of people have varying
3096.88s:  levels of awareness of like all these different factors as they impact. So thank you so much for
3101.52s:  coming to hang out for a little bit. You mentioned your website earlier, but please, if you could
3105.68s:  also throw it in the description, but then anywhere else that you would like people to be able to find
3110.08s:  you, I think I think I found you on X. So I'll throw that in there as well. You did. I'm not super
3114.88s:  active on there right now. You know, it's social media has just been something that I've invested
3121.12s:  time into in the past and I'm just not interested anymore. I do also have a YouTube channel which,
3127.04s:  you know, shockingly has like grown way more since I've been inactive there. So I've got a bunch
3133.76s:  of other recorded content that's sort of free we available. And it's just Jared Tendler, you know,
3140.40s:  on YouTube. That's right. But yeah, websites, best places kind of start. Like free worksheets,
3145.28s:  got an ebook on intuition, you know, put out a monthly newsletter, monthly blog on new topics.
3153.44s:  I also have a private community called the Mental Given Trading Live. So if you want some support,
3158.40s:  you know, my coaching is 500 bucks an hour. This is 50 bucks a month and you get, you know,
3163.52s:  certainly a bit more accountability, community content, and, you know, an ability to have some
3170.00s:  interaction with me. That's not exactly like a one-on-one, but, you know, decent replacement for one
3174.72s:  tenth of cost or maybe even more than. And then, you know, the mental given trading, which is,
3180.64s:  you know, the book, free we available, not free we available. It's available anywhere.
3184.72s:  You can go anywhere. Yeah. Software here, hardcover, audio book, ebook, etc.
3189.68s:  Awesome. Jared, thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit, sharing your expertise.
3193.52s:  I will throw links to that stuff in the notes below for everybody that's interested. And I
3198.64s:  definitely would love to connect with you another time. That's great. Good to see you.
3202.24s:  Bye, sir. Yeah.
