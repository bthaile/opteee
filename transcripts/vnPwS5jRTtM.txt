0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the LR podcast. I have Jared here today to essentially
8.32s: let everybody know how messed up we all are in the head. I'm sure you have no shortage of
14.20s: insights into that side of the world. But before we get into talking about the psychology
19.20s: of trading, kind of the correlations that you found between different things like I seek
24.30s: off clubs. I know that there's some betting side of the stuff trading side. There's a lot
29.08s: of different ways to talk about like the mindset and the human psyche, which interestingly
33.64s: enough, Marines were not really the smartest group around, but we actually are pretty
39.12s: introspective. We like to spend a lot of time understanding what makes us tick. So I'm
43.40s: actually really, really eager to chat with you. So first, thanks for coming to hang out
46.84s: for a little bit.
47.84s: Yeah, happy to be here, man. Good to chat about this stuff. I know it's important
51.32s: for a lot of people that sometimes don't always have a framework to understand it well.
56.72s: People say, well, and that's actually a great starting point to be honest, because before
61.32s: we get into your background, we'll just kind of jump right in. One of the things I find
65.08s: so interesting is for newer traders, when you hear people talk about like trading psychology,
70.84s: it sounds like the hogwash. It sounds like just this random stuff that's in the ether
76.12s: around the world of trading. And then once you trade for a while, you realize like at
80.88s: least in my opinion, there's no amount of psychology that will inherently create edge.
87.76s: You have to have some sort of system that is profitable, but you could have a very profitable
92.32s: system. And if you don't have the correct psychological constitution to execute it,
97.36s: good as it. So I actually wanted to talk to you about that. What comes first, the chicken
102.80s: or the egg, the edge of the psychology?
105.72s: The edge. 100%. I mean, like military training, I mean, I know it offhand, not directly.
115.44s: They're training you to thrive in situations where you might die. And so the standard for
121.72s: that training is really, really high. So that your emotions are not going to do something
127.36s: that's going to get you killed. But I'm sure there's plenty of situations where that's
132.84s: not feasible. And somebody gets injured and so trading is no different. Like the training
140.84s: though often happens in the live market. There isn't really a good simulator that can actually
146.84s: help to inoculate you to that environment. So early on, traders are just kind of feeling
151.96s: their way around. Meanwhile, there's just a huge swings in their emotions. But those huge
156.96s: swings in emotions, I think are largely to do with the fact that they have no idea what
161.64s: they're doing. And so you really need to have a very robust strategy. It does not have
169.92s: to be wildly profitable yet. But you have to have something that you can kind of anchor
175.48s: yourself to in order to then be able to tease out. Where are my emotions actually affecting
181.56s: my execution? Because when you are too new and don't have that, then it's easy to get
187.72s: sort of swept up in the frustration from losing. But like that frustration might be because
193.48s: you don't know what the F you're doing. And the fear might be because you don't know
198.96s: what the F you're doing. And so to not have a lot of confidence in is correct to get
205.20s: overconfident and think you know what you're doing is going to be really, really damaging.
210.16s: So the humility to be able to say, I need to establish a clear understanding of what
217.36s: I'm doing technically, strategically first is really, really important. There's definitely
222.72s: people in this space who say that trading is all about psychology and they are absolutely
228.72s: full of shit. There's no amount of tactics that can be replaced. There's no amount of
235.80s: mentality that can be replaced from poor tactics. I mean, the mentality, the mental game
242.68s: can only help to bring out what you know, it can't create it.
248.56s: What a great way to frame it. And you mentioned another thing there to dovetail off of it
253.32s: slightly. And you mentioned like this level of like overconfidence at some point. I've
258.60s: always been really interested in just research. I just enjoy reading different kind of stuff.
265.00s: You can find off of SSRN. There's a great paper that's called the behavior of individual
269.16s: investors. Anybody that's familiar with my work will know. I've cited that a million
272.72s: times. I think everybody should read it. One of the things they talk about in there is
277.00s: the Dunning-Cruelver effect. And I'm sure you're familiar with that. When there's this
283.72s: really interesting thing though, where I feel like people can be familiar with the Dunning-Cruel
288.52s: ver effect, but I don't think familiarity with it stops people from still falling over
294.92s: that same edge. Do you think that there's some method for traders that, and for those unfamiliar,
301.96s: well, maybe you could talk a little about the Dunning-Cruelver effect first in your lens,
304.76s: and then we can move on to the second part. Yeah. So, Dunning-Cruelver effect has two sides.
310.36s: One is that you don't even know what you don't know. And so as a result, you become overconfident.
317.72s: And I would classify these people in the American Idol contestants who have no concept of
330.04s: what a weak level singing looks like. And so they've kind of been in this bubble. They've
336.52s: gotten all the positive feedback because people need to get positive feedback. It need to have
342.84s: that belief in all those affirmations, yada yada yada, well, they're, you know, delusional.
348.76s: They do not have the skill to be able to properly determine where they rank. And so they naturally
355.48s: become overconfident. And interestingly enough, there's also a lot of research that describes how
360.60s: prevalent overconfidence is in Western society. And I don't mean that it's not, doesn't exist in
366.04s: in Eastern cultures as well. It's just, it's been researched more here. And so, you know, around 70%
372.44s: of people rate themselves as having above average intelligence, above average sense of humor,
379.40s: level of attractiveness. So, you know, and that doesn't account for the people who are on the other
386.84s: side of the Dunning-Furrier effect, which is those who are undervaluing what they bring to the
390.92s: table. So it might not be 20% of people overconfident. It might be even higher than that. So,
397.16s: yeah, the other side of the Dunning-Furrier effect is people who have a ton of skill, who
402.28s: end up having lower confidence because they falsely assume that everybody else knows what they know
407.24s: and what they have is just not that worthwhile. So what this really helps to show us is that
411.32s: confidence is not causal, right? Being confident for the sake of being confident, you know, could
417.24s: actually be quite dangerous. Because I have clients who, you know, are new and they objectively have
423.56s: more confidence than some of my other clients who have been doing this for 30 years. And that should
429.64s: not be. I mean, there's not a single chance in the world that if I was asked who I would bet on,
434.60s: making more money in 2025, that I would bet on the two-year newer trader. So confidence is not
441.72s: causal. And we're really looking at kind of the underpinnings of your competency because that is
448.20s: ideally what should align your confidence.
451.96s: Super interesting. And obviously, you've spent a lot of time both. You've written a couple books,
457.00s: analyzing a lot of the psychology of trading. And you obviously have your client base. So you
461.88s: have a good sample of people that you've looked at. One of the things that I've always found so
466.52s: interesting is that there's this effect. It's obviously so obvious, but I just, I can't understand
474.92s: a way around it. The effect is if you are talking to that two-year trader and you're explaining to
480.92s: them, the stove is hot. If you touch the stove, you're going to burn yourself. And yet there are still,
487.48s: there's that compulsion to like have to touch the stove. Like you can't just take it second hand
493.88s: from somebody. Like what is that? And is there a way to coach people so that you actually can
501.32s: effectively learn lessons, you know, second hand without having to touch everything yourself?
506.84s: Yeah, I mean, some people are just experiential learners. And I would put myself in that category.
512.92s: If I'm going to learn a concept, I need to have kind of some experience to really be able to
519.64s: kind of anchor that concept to. So I can kind of learn it first, but very quickly, my mind is going
524.60s: to kind of start to wander and not really be that interested in like reading more concept. Like I
530.44s: need to just go experience it. And I need to go touch that stove. In trading, you can touch the
536.12s: stove. Make sure it's not like burning hot. It's actually going to like, you know, create, you know,
540.92s: six degree burns. You can scale down this thing so you can gain experience at very, very low cost and
547.72s: very, very low pain. But like gives you the ability to kind of stick your hand on the water and
553.72s: feel around and get a sense of it, gain some experience. So yeah, there are some people that just,
558.84s: you just cannot learn everything from the sidelines. You can gain concepts, you can gain wisdom,
564.60s: experience, gain knowledge from other people's experience. But then you have to again go and start
570.20s: to translate it for yourself. And then ultimately developing your own fingerprint, your own style
575.80s: as a trader. So yeah, some of it is just that. But I think maybe more to your question is
582.12s: the people that have already started to put their hand on the stove and they themselves
587.96s: feel the heat. And they get burned. But then they keep doing it again. And that is a bit more
596.60s: complicated. Now we're getting into, you know, more of the kind of the underlying drivers with which
604.12s: compels us to do things. So for example, a lot of traders get into this enterprise or I should say
611.16s: a lot of people, they're not traders yet. A lot of people get into this enterprise looking to make
616.44s: money quickly, looking to make easy money, thinking that they can, you know, they see stuff on
621.64s: Instagram elsewhere, you know, driving lambos and beach houses and finer on the world and yadda,
627.56s: well, I want that to. And truly, they're no different than somebody who is, you know, going to buy
632.84s: a power ball ticket. But they are convincing themselves that it's, you know, more of a skill,
639.96s: which it is, but they're not actually interested in acquiring the skill. So, you know, where this is
645.24s: going to show up mostly and then just kind of continuing to touch that fire, it's, you know,
649.24s: phoma, but something's ripping, you know, don't get in unless you have like a viable setup. And if
655.08s: you missed it, like, all right, it sucks. Stay out, hold your capital and wait for another opportunity
661.48s: that's going to present itself. Like, well, no, I want to make money quickly and easily. This seems
667.96s: like an opportunity to do that. And that compulsion, right, to objectively, you and I might say, well,
674.84s: you're actually sticking your hand right on that stove again. To them, they're blinded by that
681.16s: desire to make money quickly and easily. And that blocks out any perception in the moment that
687.00s: there is any, any danger, right, to them. It's just like, no, no, this, this still goes gold. Like,
691.40s: I have to put it up my hand on it in order to grab something. So that, that's just like one example
695.72s: of where, you know, those underlying flaws bias is wishes illusions can compel us to do some dumb
702.20s: things. So what got you interested in like the psychological element of the world, really? Because
709.96s: again, like we were talking about in the beginning, it's not really relegated to just trading. You
713.16s: have actually a pretty varied background. Yeah, I've worked with golfers and poker players and,
718.44s: you know, professional gamblers, sports betters, eSport athletes, pool players, radiologists,
723.88s: lawyers, doctors, you know, business people. So it is like the psychology of performance.
730.28s: And what got you interested in it was like my own mental hangups trying to, you know, play
735.08s: professionally as a golfer. 97 tried to qualify for the US Open played amazingly well T-Degrean.
743.88s: Now the US Open has two, two, you know, kind of rounds of qualifying. This is the first round.
747.72s: So it's not like I'm, you know, I was like on the doorstep to actually playing in the open, but,
751.88s: you know, at 18, like I was close to, and that second stage, like you're playing with PGA
758.28s: tour players. Like this is, this is real. And, you know, I missed a bunch of putts, you know,
763.88s: of this line where, you know, putting it was my weakness, but, you know, the pressure really kind
767.64s: of got to me. And that was the first time that I'd ever played an event of that magnitude.
772.68s: I'd gotten good very, very quickly. Having been, you know, a baseball player, a tennis player,
776.92s: and, you know, kind of chose golf because I was 4-11 as a freshman in high school and, you know,
781.88s: figured it my, my prospects of playing professionally in that sport was going to be a little bit higher
785.80s: than baseball and tennis. So I just kind of dove into it. We got a good, really quickly. And then,
791.80s: you know, suddenly you have it as position where it's like, wow, you're like, you're on the doorstep
795.32s: of living a dream. And, you know, basically just kind of put them on my shoes. So it had,
800.36s: again, it happens once, like it's not that big a deal, but then in the, in the USM qualifier
804.60s: way to that year, same thing happens, like just play it awful. And now, you know, the kind of
809.64s: pattern starts to take hold. And I, you know, just like dove into golf psychology, read a bunch of
814.60s: books and trying to find answers to this issue. And generally speaking, my performance continued to
820.20s: elevate. Now, I was, this was like the summer after my freshman year of college. And I had one,
825.80s: two events at freshman year and, you know, one, a few more of the following year. And was an
830.44s: all-american in Division III, continuing to get better except, you know, when I would step out and
836.60s: play in some of these big, you know, events that were more aligned with my longer-term dreams.
841.88s: And so at that point, you know, it's like, all right, well, I'm not one to get just kind of, like,
846.04s: you know, try something. I wasn't going to turn professional without really feeling like I had
850.84s: an answer to this. And so I decided actually to derail my aspirations at that point and go and
858.44s: get a master's degree in counseling psychology. What I reasoned was missing from the sort of
864.52s: sports psychology, golf psychology equation at that point was an understanding of the causality.
870.04s: A lot of what I was reading, a lot of what was being expressed was very kind of behavioral in
874.68s: nature, meaning, like, you're feeling too much pressure. We're going to teach you to relax. You're
878.52s: not feeling confident enough. We're going to boost your confidence. You're getting angry when you
881.48s: get to calm down. It was, to me, kind of, ones and zeros. And as I said, it worked, but not
886.92s: under the most intense pressure, heat, and stress, where any weakness is going to get magnified
891.56s: and ultimately affect you. But therapists, right, their job is to dive deep and to problem solve
899.56s: at very personal levels. And, you know, at the time I was thinking, maybe this was personal,
904.84s: what I've come to find out, find out is it's not always personal. It's more of these
910.36s: performance flaws, biases, wishes, illusions, how we're perceiving ourselves, our skill sets,
916.36s: the environment, our competitors, et cetera, those misperceptions, the flaws in which we're sort of
922.28s: seeing, you know, all of those factors ultimately create the emotional volatility. Now, yes,
928.52s: there can be personal issues that are, you know, that can be part of the equation there.
933.88s: It doesn't have to be. So I get my master's degree from Northeastern, you know,
939.56s: spend two years getting licensed as a therapist. And then as soon as that happens, you know, July
943.88s: 20th, 2005, I basically now like beginning to kind of incorporate my system or begin to
951.56s: build my system, which is combining those two things. And I moved Arizona, start working with
957.88s: golfers at a local club and start building up a roster, worked with a gal who, you know,
962.68s: won on the LPGA tour, a few other professionals, some other good junior players. But ultimately,
967.88s: I kind of found traction in professional poker. There was a big enough base of people who
973.56s: understood that if they were not sharp, they were going to lose money. And, you know,
980.20s: golfers have a way of kind of convincing themselves that, you know, that it's more about, you know,
985.24s: hitting the range and hitting the punting green and working on their technique, which again,
988.68s: we talked about is important. But ultimately, when, you know, there's enough
993.24s: impairing your judgment is it's not just about that anymore. So, you know, started building up
999.24s: a big roster of clients in poker, wrote a book in 2011, that's a good poker. And in 2013,
1005.48s: shortly after my second poker book came out, traders started picking up the first one,
1009.64s: saying, you know, if you change the word poker to trading, it all went the same stuff. So I start
1014.68s: building up a roster of traders and, you know, the land and institutional quiet where I'm flying
1019.48s: in person, working with 40 of their traders over the course of four or five days and doing sessions
1024.12s: all day and, you know, really kind of diving into that and, you know, start building up a roster of
1028.36s: retail traders and, you know, independent people and some other opportunities along those lines.
1034.20s: Landed gig with team liquid, which is one of the largest esport teams organizations in the
1040.44s: working with the Dota teams and Counter-Strike teams. And again, environments, what I'm not,
1045.00s: you know, an expert in golf is my, you know, primary of expertise, air of expertise, but I
1050.12s: translated what I did there into poker, into trading, into esports, you know, and then into other
1055.64s: areas. And, you know, in doing that have really kind of honed my system, you know, over all these
1061.00s: years. And yeah, it applies in every environment. There's obviously unique applications,
1067.16s: but at the end of the day, it comes down to, you know, us being human beings and, you know,
1072.04s: we're just not that unique. We're not that special. At this point, you know, there's just not a lot
1076.84s: of novelty in the underlying causality of what I see. There's a lot of variety and uniqueness of
1083.64s: the people that I work with and the way that they experience those problems. But at the end of the
1087.80s: day, it's just not that unique. We're not that special. Right. And obviously, you still have clubs to
1094.52s: swing around. So how did golf end up going for you? 2007. This is sort of an interesting kind of
1102.12s: note. Like I firmly kind of solved my issues at that point was playing some of the best golf in
1107.08s: my life. So we're playing some mini tour events, you know, kind of the minor leagues of golf.
1112.76s: And, you know, not doing terribly great, but like started to see some signs that like, okay,
1118.52s: you know, I'm ready to kind of give this a go. You know, you kind of estimated that point. It's about,
1124.12s: you know, 250 grand over three years of, you know, travel expenses, training, etc. to really make it
1129.64s: worthwhile. Obviously a big expense didn't have the capital. Probably could go find it. But poker is
1134.92s: like ripping. Like things are taken off. It's like, okay, you know, here's the fork in the road. I
1139.48s: could take a risk on myself or I could continue to kind of go down this path and see, you know,
1145.40s: and maybe I'll have another opportunity. Because truly like at that point, like poker was the
1151.08s: safer bet. So, you know, I still played at a high level, you know, even more recently, this is,
1156.76s: you know, now 20 years later. And truly what I've kind of come to is I love the game. But I'm
1165.88s: incredibly happy with the coaching practice that I've developed and the work that I do. And
1171.32s: yeah, I think I would not be as as fulfilled as a person if I was a professional golfer. I'm
1176.68s: certain I'd be happy. I'm not saying that I wouldn't be happy, you know, having to live out a dream. But,
1182.60s: you know, the road that's taken me here is uncovered aspects of my character, my personality,
1186.92s: my ultimately my intelligence that I just never would have found otherwise. It turns out I was
1192.36s: dyslexic. Didn't know that as a kid. You know, didn't really know it till I was in my 30s, which
1196.92s: explains why, you know, education was challenging. Frankly, even now golf was challenging. I'm not
1202.92s: saying that was the cause of my pressure, but certainly the way in which I made decisions out there
1206.68s: was a little bit affected. So having, you know, uncovered a lot about myself, you know, through this
1213.32s: has really been, I think a big source of what validates and fulfills me today, because I work at
1223.48s: my own everyday coaching as now my primary area of performance. And I take my work incredibly
1228.92s: seriously and, you know, want to be the best I can be with it. Yeah, that's super cool. It's,
1233.80s: it's also really interesting to find, you know, the original idea of what we think the journey is
1239.56s: going to look like and then kind of accepting the pivots as they come reminds me of I'm really big
1244.68s: into martial arts and Jesus, you know, obviously part of that game. And there was a famous teacher,
1252.04s: John Danahar. And he's very similar to this where he's not like personally had a massive
1260.12s: jujitsu level career. He's successful, but he's not like some sort of renowned jujitsu player,
1265.08s: anything like that, but he the people that he coached now are essentially the best in the world.
1270.12s: So he definitely, it sounds similar to you like found his calling. He found the thing where he
1276.44s: really enjoys it, which is it's just always cool, you know, to see that match up with people.
1282.60s: Totally. And I just wait, like, you know, sometimes, you know, the criticisms of people in my,
1290.44s: you know, spot or, you know, like the guy that you're just mentioning, you know, it's like those who
1295.24s: can't teach. But the reality is that those that do those that do oftentimes can't teach,
1301.80s: right? Tiger Woods is an awful golf coach. He would be a terrible coach to most,
1306.28s: most golfers. Right. Just be better. Oh, thanks. Yeah. He's good. He's good with other professionals
1311.80s: because they kind of talk the same language. But when there's a huge skill gap, he's not capable of
1316.20s: really like filling it. So yeah, it like kind of takes somebody. And I think what I've been able to
1321.96s: bring to poker and trading, you know, specifically is like almost like an anthropologist, sociologist,
1328.44s: kind of perspective where I've really like researched, you know, the way in which traders talk
1335.16s: and experience these issues. And, you know, ideally kind of reflecting back to you, you know,
1341.40s: where some of the big holes are. And I'll just throw one example out here and I'll kind of turn
1345.40s: the tip back to you. Like with FOMO. FOMO is an awful term because it's really, really
1351.96s: imprecise. People talk about it like it's a problem. But, you know, if you went to the doctor and the
1356.84s: doctor said, you know, we weren't feeling well and something was wrong. You know, it's clearly
1361.48s: something was wrong. And he said, you know what, Eric, you're sick. Like, what, what does that mean?
1367.80s: Like, you're sick. You know, just go home and get well. I mean, obviously that would be a
1373.88s: horrendous doctor. You'd never go back to again. Right. Right. When a lot of traders say that they
1378.12s: have FOMO, they're effectively saying the same thing. It's so imprecise that you're not really able
1383.64s: to correct it. Right. Once you start to peel back the layers and understand that, you know,
1388.92s: anger and overconfidence and alacacolifidence and fear can all produce FOMO, then we got, we've got
1396.20s: it, you know, an avanous for being able to dissect it in how you experience it because that is what
1402.44s: matters to being able to correct it. So things like that, even like greed, I mean greed.
1407.40s: Your job is to make money. Like, is, is Tigerwood was Tigerwood's greedy because he wanted to win,
1415.80s: you know, every major championship and every tournament and practically did like, oh, we,
1419.64s: we, of course, he praised and it like Patrick Mahomes was not greedy trying to win a third
1425.16s: Super Bowl on a row. Right. Didn't do it, but that doesn't make him greedy. So you're not
1430.04s: greedy when you try to make more money. You're greedy when the execution of your tactics,
1436.76s: go beyond what you know is sound. Right. When Patrick tries to make an aggressive throw into
1444.28s: traffic, like, maybe we could say he was a little bit greedy early on. I'm not, again, it's to him,
1449.24s: it's for him to decide. Right. Armchair quarterbacks, not really that great analysis, but the point
1454.76s: is like, the greed is a determination based off of where your strategy got excessive.
1461.32s: Not based off of some, you know, like overarching idea that is bad. Right. Traders make,
1467.32s: you know, your job is to make money. That's the same thing as Tiger or Patrick trying to win
1471.56s: championships. It's so funny that you pivoted to greed because I literally wrote it down in my
1477.16s: notebook to mention that one next. And it's because the funniest thing I find about greed is a lot
1484.20s: of traders. I don't think it's actually the correct terminology, but I always call it like
1488.84s: false attribution where they'll say, oh, I, you know, I got greedy so blank happened.
1495.32s: And to your exact point, I always think of it from the perspective of, okay, yeah, there might
1500.12s: be an element of that. But what about like, where was the presence of a plan of like an actual profit
1505.64s: management point, loss management point, like these things that are typically predefined before
1509.56s: you enter a trade, that kind of just sort circuits the greed. It doesn't matter necessarily if it's
1514.36s: there. If you already have these areas pointed, the main thing is just to echo your broader point,
1519.32s: where it's like, I feel like a lot of times people arrive at like these superficial answers that
1523.72s: they think sound smart and self, you know, revealing, but really it's still just like the very tip
1529.00s: of the iceberg. So to turn that. And a lot of times that happens because people can't tolerate
1534.60s: uncertainty. To say, I don't know why this happened is way harder to tolerate because like,
1542.28s: you'd rather know something, rather than patch yourself to a false idea for the sake of not
1547.88s: feeling unsure. And frankly, like, if you're unsure of something, that means you're, you're in a
1553.40s: position where you actually can learn. Again, it goes back to that false confidence, right? If you're
1558.04s: one of those people who are overconfident, in this case, overconfident, you're voted to dissect and
1563.08s: diagnose your trading issues, well, then you're going to be in a position where you're never uncertain,
1568.12s: which means you're never going to learn. What an interesting point. It just kind of becomes
1574.04s: this vicious cycle that feeds on itself, which is the follow up. Yeah, the follow up I wanted to
1581.40s: ask you there, which is so I feel like traders go through this series where they get to the point
1588.12s: where they feel like they're self identifying these issues, right? Like I'm greedy. And that's what
1593.40s: caused this to go bad. But obviously as we're talking about a lot of times, that's actually quite
1598.04s: superficial. What are some methods that you use to help traders move past that superficial top
1606.36s: level analysis into the actual positive attribution of like, what's the feeding forces that are leading
1613.24s: to this behavior? Yeah, so I'd say easiest way to do that is what I call a data collection worksheet.
1621.00s: Free of freely available on my website, geratandler.com, backslashworksheets.
1625.88s: But the basic ideas are pretty basic. So you're identifying in real time around your trading mistakes,
1632.84s: the triggers for that what you think is greed or at least your emotions, the thoughts that you have
1639.16s: in that moment, whether they're in your head or things you say out loud, you know, trying to
1645.48s: kind of peel back the emotion, right? Describe what the emotion is in that moment. Describe the
1650.68s: actions or the behaviors or the physical sensations you feel at that time, right? Are you
1655.00s: kind of just like walked into a one chart when you should be having a book or kind of zoomed out
1661.16s: focus? Are you toggling down to, you know, lower time frames? Yeah, are you just like turning off
1669.40s: certain factors, you know, or indicators that might help you? How does your perception of the
1675.32s: market change? How does your perception of your positions change? How does your perception of your
1679.48s: own strategy change? Be very, very detailed and capturing as much data as you can. You might not
1684.92s: get all of those points, you know, at any one time, but you get like two or three. When I was
1689.48s: sudden you start to create some some data that's going to help you gather more data, right? In other
1695.24s: situations or in suit with clients, they'll have them print this out or have it on their computer and,
1700.36s: you know, situation comes up where, right, they feel that phomo, they feel that greed, they feel that
1704.68s: fear of losing the revenge trading, whatever, right? They are capturing as much data as they can
1710.52s: in real time. After the trading days over, they'll go back review it at any additional notes they
1715.08s: can. You do this day over day, all of a sudden now, there's going to be start, you're going to start
1719.80s: to see some patterning, you're going to see if you see some repetition. And frankly, like I wrote
1724.12s: the mental game of trading, like within mind that you could find like kind of comparing the data you
1731.96s: find with what you see in the book. And then the book can help to kind of walk you through, you know,
1737.24s: what might be underlying those particular issues. Yes, you can obviously spend some time reflecting
1742.36s: asking yourself some questions and trying to figure out why you're experiencing what you're
1746.20s: experiencing and get good answers. But the book, right, I'd say captures about 80% of what traders
1752.52s: are experiencing. So it's definitely a little bit of a cheat code to be able to kind of dissect it
1757.00s: for yourself, because I've given you a little bit of a road map to be able to do that.
1760.68s: Yeah, that's it's super interesting. And another question I have, dubtailing off of this idea
1766.36s: of self analysis. And this might be a little bit of the caveman side of my brain, but I've always
1774.36s: found the juxtaposition between analysis and actually like root cause analysis to be useful.
1782.12s: But then I feel like there's another layer of that where it's over analysis, where we're just
1787.96s: like almost analyzing new problems into creation. Is that something that you've seen at all? And if so,
1796.52s: like what are some methods for people to conduct effective analysis where they're getting to an answer
1801.80s: and then they're confident in this answer and then able to move on to, you know, the next piece.
1806.84s: Well, the key word you said is confident. They call to an answer and they're actually not confident.
1811.80s: It's the same reason why traders system hop, right, whether they're continually looking for kind
1815.80s: of the next best thing because there's not a base of confidence that's being established.
1822.28s: And ultimately, as I said before, it needs to come through competency, right? Your confidence is
1828.36s: most aligned with your competence when it's when it's effective, when it's grounded. So,
1836.04s: you know, if you're continuing to over analyze, then you have to come back and ask yourself like,
1842.76s: do I feel like I have the skill to properly determine whether or not this is the problem or not?
1850.28s: And if the answer is yes, then you have to invariably trust that first answer and then go research
1858.76s: and test whether or not you were right or not. If the answer is I'm not sure or no, then get better
1865.00s: at that analysis first before you go and start analyzing another problem because like it doesn't
1871.00s: mean or if you might choose to analyze another problem, but you're doing so in the spirit of
1876.28s: trying to maybe solve something but also get better at that analysis. Like there's kind of two parts
1881.88s: to it. You know, as a trader, as an independent, you don't have the ability to, well, I mean,
1890.44s: that's why people hire me, right? It's like to kind of bring them on your team. But like,
1894.84s: we know, if you're on a sports team, right? You have people naturally around you who you rely on
1902.04s: to do that diagnosis. What really good coaches are able to do? Not just help you to analyze,
1908.44s: but also figure out from a training standpoint how to be better, how to solve those issues. And if
1913.48s: it's something mechanical, they'll find experts to fill those gaps and I mean, really good coaches
1919.24s: know what not to focus on so that you can really zone in and focus on what you do when you're
1925.48s: trying to be a coach for yourself from a mentality standpoint, from a risk management standpoint,
1931.08s: from a technical standpoint, it's hard to kind of toggle between those, but it sort of begins with
1936.20s: the honesty to say like, all right, you know what? I'm not very good at this thing yet. So let me
1940.92s: just keep practicing and not kind of getting accessible. I think that's a way of slowing down
1947.56s: that extra analysis. Yeah, that's super useful. It's interesting. Another thing I've come across
1955.80s: that I'm interested your perspective on are looking to achieve things either. I don't know the
1961.88s: correct terminology, but when you're trying to achieve something to achieve the thing or when you're
1966.60s: trying to achieve the thing to avoid failure, I don't know the correct, I don't know what that's called,
1972.36s: but yeah, I know I know either. Yeah, okay. Well, whatever that thing is,
1977.56s: is that something that you've analyzed across your clients and have you come across any
1984.36s: commonalities between specifically the trading world where if it's more effective when people are
1990.12s: trying to hit something because they want to hit this versus avoid that or vice versa,
1995.00s: they're both effective. The fear of failure, the fear of losing, the fear of being destitute,
2001.40s: the fear of not being able to pay your mortgage and have your, like all those things,
2006.12s: the hatred of losing, like all those things, like the all the avoidance motivators can be very,
2011.56s: very effective. However, they're limited when, you know, like you're actually successful.
2018.68s: You know, I mean, Jordan, Michael Jordan was famous for constantly needing people to think less
2025.08s: of him and to slight him and to find that anger. That's what allowed him to be his absolute best.
2033.24s: But he had to create it and he had to mentally manipulate his mind and he was an expert
2037.96s: to be able to do that. It's hard for mortals to do that reliably and continue to find
2045.72s: failure and fear at a high level. So invariably, the kind of go through those ways of like,
2053.96s: all right, don't fuck up, don't fail. Don't go right. And then you're like, oh, okay,
2057.56s: I can breathe the end. And then you've got to fall back down to earth only to kind of find that
2061.72s: next pit. It's like, well, what's going to keep you kind of continuing to thrive? Some people
2065.96s: right are much more motivated by their aspirations. And so yes, I think when you have a more pure
2073.32s: motivation towards your goals, towards what you want to accomplish, there is an independence to that.
2079.88s: Right, you're not relying on external outcomes to drive it. But sometimes maybe you're not
2086.28s: as aspirational as you could be because what you envisioned your own potential to be is based off
2091.40s: of your own perception of yourself, which could actually be too well. You might be capable of
2098.92s: making eight figures a year or eight figures period and building that kind of wealth.
2104.44s: But if you're only kind of aiming lower because you have a strange relationship with money,
2109.80s: because you grew up poor or your parents weren't super supportive. And so you're having a little bit
2116.92s: of that imposter syndrome, when you're having success, well, then that undervaluing may not give you
2123.16s: the sort of authentic real aspirations. So there's not like kind of a one-size-fits-all that's
2130.28s: going to help everybody. I think the end of the day is like, once you achieve some success and
2135.24s: you find that you maybe need to be a bit more aspirational and less defensive in a sense,
2142.52s: or you need to be more offensively minded, a little bit more in that kind of corrective
2151.24s: place to fix some of the faulty perspectives you have to yourself. So you can actually be more offensive.
2160.52s: And everybody's kind of got to figure out their own mixture and formula for what's going to allow
2165.32s: them to be successful. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all option, because we'll kind of solve it for
2169.64s: everyone. Sure. So essentially, you haven't found some sort of stronger correlation or output
2177.80s: if somebody is acting out of fear-based incentives versus aspirational, it's kind of just very
2183.08s: specific to the individual. Yeah, got it. And I was smiling before because you started doing that
2189.08s: thing again where I, in my defense, I wrote this one down earlier, but it was the very next thing
2194.44s: I was going to move on to that you naturally started blending us into, which is this idea of
2199.64s: trying to balance like thinking big, right? Aspirations, trying to not glass ceiling yourself,
2205.88s: but then also being realistic and balancing the ever-present, you know, potential for failure.
2214.92s: So for traders, are there any tips or tricks that you have with respect to helping them figure out
2224.04s: like what the right focus is, what the right target is, which obviously will be highly personalized
2230.60s: and commensurate with individual performance capabilities, but from a broader perspective?
2235.96s: I think the biggest thing is not getting emotionally attached to the bigger vision. That's where your
2242.60s: energy, when it get, or your emotions, when they get too attached to those bigger aspirations
2250.52s: that they can cause a lot of problems. And I think people having done that before, maybe
2254.92s: in other environments, and having gotten whacked and not being successful as they wanted to, and
2261.88s: they end up kind of naturally like aiming lower, right? Because they don't want to get swept up
2268.04s: in that emotionality. So you're really kind of band-aid in the problem by not engaging it versus like,
2276.20s: no, have those massive aspirations, but use them to guide you to understand what's required in the
2284.68s: next month, three months, six months, or as far out as you can plan. Generally, you get a year-out,
2290.52s: like you're kind of making estimates and it's general ideas. But that's where your nose needs to be,
2297.00s: like on the grindstone, doing the work day to day, really expanding your precision with your
2301.64s: execution, with your improvement, with your learning, whatever mentality, technical
2306.60s: risk management, all that is what matters day to day. But sometimes having those bigger aspirations
2313.96s: out there can place greater demands on your time, help to make you make better choices. I'm not
2321.56s: saying you have to have them. You can want trading to be a really nice side-income that's
2328.36s: going to give you the ability to take your family out on one nice trip a year, and that's your
2332.76s: aspiration. Awesome. Make it happen. But the same thing is true. What's required to reach that
2341.64s: outcome? Best way I can describe this is like results in process fit together. Results demand a certain
2350.04s: process, which you're not really sure what it is yet, but you'll know based on the results.
2355.56s: Over enough time. Did I do enough to achieve my goal? No. Okay. Well, let's retool and figure out.
2361.40s: Yes. Cool. Okay. Well, what's next? Results and process fit together. It's not like a long journey.
2368.84s: It's a journey with many destinations and those destinations that are predetermined give you feedback
2374.68s: on your process. If it's just process with no outcome, then there's no wrong answers.
2382.12s: So we want to have the ability to know whether or not your meeting targets are not.
2387.24s: But we don't want to be emotionally attached to those targets because that will
2391.00s: demotivate us or blind us to the realities of what's required to give us a chance of getting there.
2396.12s: And if we fall short, fine. Figure out how to fill that gap. Whether that means reaching
2403.48s: outside of your immediate purview to do more research and find people who can help you to do that.
2408.76s: Interesting. And you mentioned something in there that I'm really interested in, which is
2417.24s: I found I'm a little more in that first group where I did grow up fairly poor. So my original goal was
2426.68s: still at the time I considered really aggressive. Obviously, as I got close to it, became pretty
2432.76s: modest in nature. And I found myself for a long time telling myself like, I'm okay with blank,
2441.64s: right? Whatever this thing is. And then I started to realize that part of that was essentially
2447.88s: me lying to myself and just being comfortable with where I'm at because it's comfortable there.
2452.76s: And that's the reality and the prospects of potentially reaching induces failure potential
2458.12s: and stuff like that. But I had like this really interesting just self reflection that I went through as
2463.08s: they started identifying that. How do you guide people through that process of setting good goals,
2472.60s: but making sure that the goals aren't based on comfort where if somebody says to you like, Jared,
2478.04s: I am I'm completely comfortable with just my trading being the side income. Whereas if they had
2483.32s: the potential for the trading to actually be their full-time job, they would jump on it immediately.
2488.68s: But they're concerned to make that jump. It's hard. I mean, I my
2496.84s: you know, without talking to somebody, right? I think it's part of the question. Without talking to
2501.56s: somebody, it's hard to kind of know where a little bit of that BS lies, right? Where something's
2508.12s: just a little bit off. You know, like you said two things that I'll challenge you specifically on
2514.92s: and maybe give those that are watching some ideas of like how to find this. But like, write out your
2519.64s: goals and then write out the wise behind your goals. And if you find language that feels a little
2525.64s: bit soft, feels a little bit wavy or undefined or unclear, well then that's probably an indicator.
2533.00s: Right? So when you said, you know, I'm okay with X. That basically means that you're saying,
2539.00s: I'm okay being okay. That's truly what you want. Well, then cool. Okay is enough. But
2548.44s: is okay enough? Clearly it wasn't. That was one, two, I'm completely comfortable.
2556.92s: Whenever time we add those superlatives or I don't know what the right word is, like
2562.04s: adjectives on top of the comfort, it kind of tells us that we're trying to convince ourselves
2567.96s: or something. Like I am comfortable with making this kind of money. I'm comfortable with the idea
2574.84s: and I have evidence to prove that I'm completely comfortable. Are you? Are you trying to convince
2581.56s: yourself of that? Those would be kind of a couple things to look out for. Yeah, super interesting.
2587.72s: I very interesting, especially like the add-on language. That makes a lot of sense.
2594.44s: I know that I don't have you for too much longer as you could tell. I literally can talk
2598.44s: you ear off because as soon as you say stuff, more stuff gets written down and it's this vicious
2603.32s: cycle for you. But don't worry, I may have promised you I'll keep it. But the next thing I wanted to
2609.00s: talk to you though, one of the most fascinating things I find about trading is that it's
2613.80s: it's like very holistic. Meaning as a retail trader, you have to be researcher, you have to be
2619.16s: the boss, you have to be the risk management department, you have to be this parser psychologist,
2622.92s: you have to there's a lot of things you have to do and it feels like one of the things you mentioned
2627.24s: earlier really stuck out with me, which is when you're dealing with some systems that add pressure,
2633.00s: just about any of your weaknesses are going to eventually come to light. You're going to see them.
2639.24s: Do you have any tips for traders as they might be newer, not fully sure what their weaknesses
2645.96s: might actually be yet because they don't know what they are? Do you have any tips for those kinds
2650.28s: of people to become more self aware of what some of those weaknesses might be?
2655.08s: Look at other things you've done seriously. Hobbies don't really count because it's not really
2659.24s: going to draw them out. The things that you really cared about will give you at least some
2664.84s: guideposts to maybe like, you hate losing because you hated losing since you were a kid or
2670.92s: you tend to feel a lot of pressure when you're taking tests or giving presentations or
2675.72s: when you're really kind of under the heat. You're not really a confident person. You tend to be
2682.84s: a little bit arrogant. You're a little procrastinator. You can see these patterns in
2689.48s: elsewhere in your life and maybe they don't harm you in significant ways. They don't really
2695.40s: kind of impair like you're again, happy and satisfied. But in trading, they're going to come out
2702.20s: and they're going to be problem. You can kind of start to get ahead of it before you even develop
2707.16s: the sort of technical precision to have a strategy that's going to maybe show some of these problems
2713.80s: to be damaging and costly in trading ahead of time. Especially the ones that are related to
2722.44s: work ethic and responsibility and discipline, motivation, those are ones you really want to get
2730.12s: ahead of because they are absolutely going to slow you down. They'll be the barnacles on your ship
2736.12s: here that reduce the friction or the increase friction and slow down your growth curve.
2741.88s: So yeah, if you see any of that stuff, then absolutely get ahead of it.
2746.44s: And it doesn't mean I'm not saying like work ethic in this space sometimes means like
2752.12s: knows the grindstone, you know, just full board. There is definitely a relationship where
2759.72s: you got to start thinking about yourself as a performer. And you know, this is not like you're
2765.16s: taking a test once. Like you're studying for the MCATs or studying for the GREs or whatever.
2771.40s: This is not nine months of study before you start trading. I mean, I
2775.96s: work for a handful of people that have done that, but they've already known that that is their
2781.48s: style of learning. And they know that it works. You know, if you spend a year just studying before
2790.12s: you start to enter the live market, you know, if you're not certain that that style is going to work,
2795.64s: you are at risk of getting into the market with expectations that are way too high. Because
2803.96s: I would think of the transfer from studying and preparing yourself and learning to the live market
2812.28s: to like a funnel, right? Like you're only going to get a little bit through at a time, right?
2819.08s: Our mind only has bandwidth for so much. And so when you feel like you're really strong command
2826.12s: of certain ideas, concepts, et cetera, you know, in study or even in the SEM,
2832.44s: it may not necessarily all just kind of copy-paste over, right? It's going to take some time. So
2838.60s: those faulty expectations are really damaging, you know, when you spend an inordinate amount of
2845.24s: time studying before you actually, you know, kind of make the transfer. But that's just kind of one
2849.08s: tip on top of the overall idea of what I was mentioning earlier and just kind of using
2853.88s: past other performance environments to kind of help understand what what issues may affect you.
2859.72s: Yeah, I love that. What a great way to try to add a little clarity to something that's
2864.76s: truly ambiguous by using references like that. Super smart. I have two questions left. We only
2870.28s: have time for one. So I'll let you pick the one that you like the most. One of them is really boring.
2875.32s: So I'm actually not even going to pitch that one to you. I'm happy to go lightning, right? I can
2879.88s: answer questions in five seconds if we need to. So beautiful. Okay, then let's do that. What are the
2884.76s: most common destructive behaviors you see in traders? They are assuming that they know the cause
2897.56s: of their problems. Love that. What are the most common nefarious destructive behaviors for
2907.32s: traders? The differentiation I'm making here is something that's commonly afflicts people,
2914.04s: but people don't know. It's a normal reflection, meaning that it's something that impacts a lot of
2919.96s: people, but it's commonly overlooked. I mean, I want to say revenge trading, but I know it's so
2930.76s: commonly talked about. So maybe we'll go like desperation. There is such a deep desire because
2940.12s: sometimes desperation where you're just really violating your rules in ways that feel so justified
2948.12s: at the moment. You're either leveraging up, sizing up, eliminating stop losses, daily loss limits,
2955.16s: etc. to sustain the hope that you can still make money today, make money in this trade,
2961.40s: continue to move forward. There's not a lot of emotion that feels present in real time. There's
2969.96s: just this compulsion that is driving you to violate all of your rules and it feels as I said,
2978.20s: justified at the moment. That's probably the one that, again, it's not always in a very emotional
2983.96s: experience. Sometimes it could be filled with anger, but at the heart of that is a very strong
2989.24s: weakness and confidence that underlies it. Interesting. Last one, easy one. What are some of the most
2997.24s: common traits that you see in successful traders? I know you've answered this a million times,
3001.08s: but you got to ask when you're talking to psychological dude. Same thing as anything else. You've
3006.76s: got to have a love and a passion for it and that love and the passion translates into doing the
3011.56s: work required. So it's the passion and the work ethic. It literally is no different than anything else.
3017.96s: And the love and passion, some of you can't fake it. You can be infatuated by trading. You
3027.96s: really enjoy it and still be good at it. But in order for you to be great, you have to love it.
3034.92s: It has to be a part of you and that means that you're going to be obsessed by it.
3040.76s: That obsession to others is going to look like gambling and being a workaholic and yada, yada,
3048.20s: but again, nobody called tiger a workaholic. Nobody called Kobe and all the greats in any
3054.04s: progression like workaholics. That's what's required to achieve your goals. And there are no choices
3062.12s: at that point. Awesome. I made a promise. I intend to keep it. I do have more questions written down,
3069.48s: but I will get you on another time to continue diving in. As you could tell, there's two things
3076.52s: that I really like to pull out from this. The way that you look at things, the way that you analyze
3081.00s: the world and trying to give people some ways that they can adopt some of them. But I also think that
3086.68s: you did a really great job and I'm appreciative of trying to open the lens for people about different
3093.56s: factors that I guess is a lot of people have varying levels of awareness of like all these different
3099.00s: factors as they impact. So thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit. You mentioned
3102.92s: your website earlier, but please, if you could also throw it in the description, but then anywhere
3108.36s: else that you would like people to be able to find you, I think I found you on X. So I'll throw that
3113.00s: in there as well. You did. I'm not super active on there right now. It's social media has just been
3120.04s: something that I've invested time into in the past and I'm just not interested anymore.
3124.36s: I do also have a YouTube channel which, you know, shockingly has grown way more since I've been
3131.64s: inactive there. So I've got a bunch of other recorded content that's sort of freeway available.
3139.00s: And it's just Jared Tendler on YouTube. That's right. But yeah, websites best place to start,
3144.20s: like free worksheets, got an ebook on intuition, you know, put out a monthly newsletter,
3150.44s: monthly blog on new topics. I also have a private community called the Mental Gimma Trading Live.
3156.52s: So if you want some support, you know, my coaching is 500 bucks an hour. This is 50 bucks a month
3162.76s: and you get, you know, certainly a bit more accountability, community content, and, you know,
3169.24s: an ability to have some interaction with me. That's not exactly like a one-on-one, but, you know,
3173.56s: decent replacement for one-tenth the cost or maybe even more than. And then, you know,
3179.00s: the mental game of trading, which is, you know, the book, freeway available, not freeway, it's
3183.72s: available anywhere. You can go anywhere. Yeah. Software here, art cover, audio book, ebook, etc.
3189.64s: Awesome. Jared, thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit, sharing your expertise.
3193.48s: I will throw links to that stuff in the notes below for everybody that's interested. And I
3198.68s: definitely would love to connect with you another time. Good to see you. Yeah.
