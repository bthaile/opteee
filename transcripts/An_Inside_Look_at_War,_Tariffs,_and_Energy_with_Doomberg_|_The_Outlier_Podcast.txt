2.64s: what's up outliers welcome back to the
3.92s: outlier podcast I'm my friend doomberg
6.56s: and the timing for this is beautiful
9.52s: because as per usual there's no shortage
12.00s: of crazy things going on I always find
15.32s: my inability to fill out the stock
18.00s: market and economic Bingo cards to be
20.84s: pretty hilarious I I never really get
22.84s: that far how's the year starting off for
25.32s: you well it must be said that Donald
27.96s: Trump is nothing if not fantastic for
29.88s: the the newsletter
31.44s: business I was joking with my wife about
35.64s: that because it's it's like to your
38.52s: exact point if nothing else you have no
41.56s: shortage of constant streams of clips of
44.84s: things to talk about because I was
47.56s: watching him signing like a bunch of
48.84s: different executive orders and he's
50.36s: given like a a press conference while
52.64s: he's signing these things you know we
55.00s: have a good friend um sir JJ over at
57.48s: Market Vibes a new substack who I like a
59.40s: lot he's a old school traiter 50 years
61.56s: in the pit um yeah and a recent piece
64.36s: that he published under his Mast head he
66.36s: he had an interesting comparison which
68.32s: is FDR's Fireside Chats you know in a
71.36s: way Trump is playing the media in the
74.64s: same way that FDR did um totally
77.20s: accessible for all of his faults and
78.96s: believe me he has many um the man has
82.32s: stamina and endurance and is never
85.08s: afraid of the microphone and the
87.24s: contrast between four years of a staff
90.28s: trying to hide Joe Biden from the public
92.60s: and Donald Trump unabashedly afraid to
95.56s: talk to a bunch of microphones at 2 in
97.20s: the morning on a return flight from
99.08s: California is really quite something
102.32s: it's a it's a stark contrast so talk to
105.60s: me a little bit about from an overall
109.24s: lens how the year is starting off were
112.48s: things so far in line with expectations
114.64s: were there new injects to the mental
116.96s: models in terms of just how you expected
119.08s: things to go and I'm really isolating to
121.60s: one level of analysis economic markets
124.52s: political really just anything in
126.60s: general the main reason why I'm asking
128.44s: it this way is I want to get a sense
130.40s: from your Paradigm what's sticking out
132.64s: to you so far this year yeah the only
134.76s: thing that matters is the speed and
136.32s: efficiency with which Trump is hitting
137.88s: the ground and smashing the opposition
139.84s: whatever your views are whether you are
142.60s: you know right leaning left leaning um
145.56s: Donald Trump had four years to ponder
147.40s: what went wrong how he quote unquote
150.04s: loss 2020 um how his first
152.68s: Administration was sidelined by
154.88s: Distraction after distraction and
157.04s: perhaps sabotage from within and he had
159.76s: four years to plot his revenge and um he
164.20s: ascended to the presidency on January
166.44s: 20th and it is just simply undeniable
168.88s: that he is flooding the
170.48s: field with all manner of good policy
173.88s: crazy policy insane statements um the
177.24s: new cycle can't keep up with whatever it
180.28s: is he's rolling out and um you know he's
184.16s: he's deputized Elon Musk to do a variety
187.12s: of things and he's getting his nominees
189.52s: through the Senate um making crazy
193.08s: statements with Netanyahu at this press
195.48s: conference like he's just a whirlwind um
198.92s: and again whatever your views on the man
200.84s: or his politics or his morals he is a
205.24s: tornado that is that is impacting
207.80s: everything he's impacting stocks he's
209.32s: impacting politics he's impacting War
211.40s: he's impacting peace he's impacting the
213.76s: tax code he's impacting the federal
215.24s: government budget he is just a
217.80s: steamroller the likes of which the US
220.76s: frankly I don't think has ever seen and
222.88s: history will record Trump regardless of
225.88s: how his term ends as a tour to force
228.92s: whether it ends up being net positive or
231.16s: negative of course depends on future
233.68s: events and depends on your perspective
235.84s: coming into these events but the man is
238.28s: undeniably
239.96s: just an Energizer Bunny of of just
243.16s: unlike we've never seen it maybe it's
245.16s: just the contrast between what Trump
247.36s: would characterized as the Sleepy Joe
250.32s: Administration um but he it's just
253.04s: really is something to behold and
254.40s: frankly we are having trouble keeping up
256.00s: with it all um trying to Chronicle it um
259.44s: and trying to bring some sense to it but
261.20s: um it's nothing if not interesting to be
263.72s: sure yeah so so far you bring up a
266.72s: really interesting point about just how
268.44s: much is going on of of the just Litany
272.24s: of policies executive orders statements
274.40s: that are being made are there any
276.48s: specific items that he's been talking
279.00s: about that really stick out to you and
281.48s: if so why so there's the assault on us
286.24s: Aid or us Aid depending on your um your
291.36s: perspective and that is really just
295.08s: going right at the juggler of the power
296.76s: structure of the Democratic National
298.48s: Committee um and somebody gave Trump
301.16s: really good advice um before he came
303.32s: into to the presidency the second time
304.80s: around so there's the proactive things
306.52s: he's actually doing and look that's a
308.16s: scandal like I mean I think that
310.20s: is is really going to be a major story
313.72s: for months to come as we see all of
315.76s: these foreign quote unquote newspapers
317.48s: and media Outlets suddenly going out of
319.80s: business because they were actually just
321.16s: paid fronts of the democratic party of
324.92s: of the United States um opposition media
328.00s: in Hungary for example is just one
329.40s: example where Victor orbon was tweeting
331.12s: about recently so there's the things
332.96s: he's doing but then there's the things
334.32s: he's not doing which I think are just as
336.04s: important and just as profound which is
338.52s: what we're trying to get our hands
339.80s: around to to write a few pieces on which
341.72s: is he really doesn't want anything to do
343.32s: with Ukraine I mean I think this is
345.72s: Biden's War don't forget Trump was
348.08s: impeached over Ukraine in 2019 it's not
351.16s: like he's unaware of what's really going
353.32s: on over there and how this all came
355.16s: about and he would like to just wash his
357.64s: hands of it turn the keys over to Europe
360.12s: which of course is akin to losing the
361.96s: war because there is no way in which
364.28s: Ukraine can sustain itself in the
365.60s: absence of continued us support and he
367.84s: just doesn't actually want to talk about
369.48s: it um the stuff he does say when asked
372.92s: is mostly wrong um sort of indicates to
377.32s: us that he's not really studying the
378.60s: issue all that closely it's kind of like
380.96s: that that issue in the back of your mind
383.32s: that you know is there that you wish
384.40s: would just go away and so you don't
385.52s: spend much time thinking about it which
386.88s: is sort of consistent with Trump's
388.40s: personality because he gravitates
389.56s: towards winning and strength and all of
391.92s: those things like we're losing that war
393.36s: NATO will lose that war Russia will win
395.08s: that war um and he's kind of just trying
397.96s: to drop the bags on Europe and uh one of
400.36s: the pieces we're working on right now is
402.60s: how you know this amazing interview that
405.28s: Mark Rubio gave with Megan Kelly where
407.84s: he all but says that the US will Retreat
409.92s: to a uh sphere of influence slash you
413.36s: know multi-polar World um there's no
416.56s: scenario in which the European Union
418.40s: survives an American can retreat in that
420.44s: regard and that's what's coming Rubio Al
423.12s: but signal it Trump's absence of
425.28s: forceful you know for all the talk of
427.36s: I'm going to solve the war in a day and
428.72s: I'm going to call Putin and we're going
429.80s: to you know negotiate a deal he's done
431.40s: none of those things and um I I don't I
434.84s: I can understand why he was dealt a
437.40s: losing hand we've said many times in our
440.20s: articles and on podcast appearances that
442.36s: one of the reasons why you you avoid
444.00s: picking fights as you might lose them uh
446.84s: and this is especially true when the
448.96s: when the cost of defeat is larger than
450.84s: the prize on offer you know uh and so um
454.44s: he just wants to ignore Ukraine and
456.88s: every day that he ignores Ukraine you
458.92s: know the Russian army continues to sort
462.16s: of roll up the parts of Ukraine that it
464.64s: now considers Russia and zalinsky gets
467.24s: more and more desperate it's it's a real
470.40s: Fiasco one for which the blame lies at
473.04s: the feet of the Biden Administration to
474.44s: be clear I I I think with a high degree
477.56s: of certainty that Trump statements that
479.16s: the war would not have happened if he
480.32s: had won in 2020 or absolutely true we
482.44s: would not be involved in this war um and
485.12s: so it's it's not just what he's doing
486.56s: but what he's not doing and and he is
489.52s: um really taking an assault a frontal
493.80s: assault on the vast waste and fraud and
497.92s: mismanagement of public money that has
499.64s: occurred in Washington under the opes of
502.32s: both Democratic and Republican regimes
505.72s: um in our view there's team DC and team
508.04s: Trump and DC is about to get
513.40s: rinsed couple things here the first one
516.80s: going back to the Ukraine war two
519.20s: questions the first one is you're
521.84s: hypothesizing that Russia is likely to
524.76s: win when you say win what does that mean
528.56s: like how would you define Russia winning
530.60s: in this context Russia will impose its
533.80s: objectives by military force and there's
536.76s: nothing that Europe or the US can do
538.88s: about it
540.36s: that is my definition of winning it will
542.92s: secure the quote four regions it will
545.72s: degrade Ukraine's military capabilities
548.56s: it might not be able to enforce upon
550.72s: Ukraine that the Russians that live
552.84s: within what's left of Ukraine get you
555.00s: know the rights to speak their language
557.20s: and go to church and all of those things
559.40s: but the broad important military
561.64s: objectives will be achieved by force
564.48s: which is sort of the ultimate definition
565.88s: of winning in a military conflict as I'm
568.20s: sure you more than any body would be
569.96s: aware yep and the follow on is why do
574.76s: you think Trump is taking such a a
577.96s: passive position on it obviously
579.68s: understanding the context of being dealt
582.00s: kind of a difficult hand to work with
583.52s: but that also seems
585.08s: like a really great potential win for
588.72s: him and his platform he doesn't have the
592.12s: leverage to win and Trump hates hates to
594.68s: be seen as losing right I mean I I don't
597.52s: want to be like armchair psychologist
599.80s: sure but but he is a relatively
601.76s: straightforward person to understand
603.88s: right um he is I think a very empathetic
607.40s: person a very patriotic person um a very
611.08s: bombastic person um he enjoys a good
615.72s: negotiation the art of the deal wrote a
617.64s: book on it and I think has very good
620.04s: intuition for when he is walking into a
622.12s: situation where he doesn't have the
623.84s: leverage and since he didn't create this
626.68s: situation but he only inherited it I
629.40s: think the
630.48s: motivation like in his first 100 days he
633.08s: wants to be seen as winning as much as
634.76s: possible and this is just a losing hand
637.64s: um and and so I I just think passive
639.76s: aggressively he wants to ignore
641.64s: it what makes you think so much that
644.56s: it's a losing hand I I know I've been
647.28s: studying the day-to-day you know line of
650.44s: combat moves and what both sides are
653.52s: telling themselves internally for
654.96s: propaganda and body counts and all the
656.76s: things that you would want to study to
659.72s: get your own independent analysis of
662.56s: what's going on on the ground and this
663.92s: is very hard we wrote a piece a year ago
665.64s: called mapping the war and we open that
667.88s: piece with the difficulty involved in
669.56s: cutting through propaganda and one of
671.60s: the things we have learned to do which I
673.24s: think serves us very well is we read the
675.56s: propaganda of all the sides because even
678.36s: just learning what they're telling each
679.80s: other is a very valuable input into
682.28s: what's possible and what's likely
684.88s: happening and and we're seeing um look
688.12s: it's just the mathematics of it are very
689.88s: clear you have a giant country next to a
691.80s: relatively small country you have a vast
695.84s: industrial machine that the West
698.48s: radically underestimated I don't know
700.16s: why for centuries invading armies always
703.32s: underestimate the industrial capacity of
705.04s: Russia um their supply chain is far
707.56s: closer to the line of combat than ours
710.28s: um it is viewed internally within Russia
712.60s: and is spun as much within their
714.32s: propaganda as an existential threat to
716.36s: the country it's a nice to have War for
718.76s: us you go to the Midwest and you go to
720.80s: the mall and you ask a 100 people do you
723.00s: care about Ukraine I I bet you wouldn't
724.44s: find a single yes if you go to the same
727.20s: Mall in Moscow it's a it's an
729.24s: existential threat so you have one side
731.40s: fighting existentially the Russians for
735.24s: whom their entire industrial base is
737.24s: right
738.04s: there and um then the us through its
742.32s: sort of proxies and in the EU with very
744.76s: long extended Supply chains much of
746.80s: which has been outsourced to China by
748.60s: the way who is allied with our opponent
750.72s: in this war um this is highlighting huge
754.36s: weaknesses in the US military industrial
756.20s: complex which I think Trump is is um
759.12s: motivated to
760.36s: fix and in many ways this has opened the
763.20s: eyes of I think the Department of
764.60s: Defense which is we we would sort of
766.16s: View Washington as the dod largely Pro
768.96s: Trump and CIA Wall Street largely Pro B
771.40s: pro Biden you know um the dod recognizes
774.24s: the holes in the supply chain doesn't
775.56s: really want to escalate the war in
777.56s: Ukraine um and sees that it's just a
780.60s: fight that we can't win like we've spent
782.48s: how many tens of billions of dollars on
784.84s: this war and um if you just go to like
788.84s: you know um the Deep State mapping
791.12s: project and play the video of the
793.36s: movement of the line of com uh combat
795.60s: over the last year it's very clear that
798.32s: it's a one-way traffic um and
802.16s: so Russia's Army's never been bigger
804.28s: it's never been better equipped um the
806.20s: head of NATO just admitted that Russia
808.76s: is prod producing three times as many
810.20s: weapons as the entirety of the NATO
811.96s: countries integrated by factor of
814.76s: three we're not going to win this war um
817.32s: we're not going to go to we're not going
818.80s: to resort to nuclear you know weapons
821.84s: that's pretty clear and so if if one of
824.32s: the reasons why you don't pick a kinetic
826.36s: conflict with a nuclear superpowers
828.40s: unless you're willing to use your
829.72s: nuclear weapons they're not much of use
831.40s: to you um so I I just think reading is
834.88s: on the wall um and especially if Trump
837.44s: pulls away you know we've cut off fun
839.44s: and uh a few other things like it won't
841.92s: be long and um and so I I I just
845.28s: think sometimes you just got to take the
847.36s: take the L and and Trump is probably
849.52s: willing to take that L um because by the
851.48s: way it's very hard like how would you
853.04s: win this war from here if if you were in
854.72s: charge Eric I'd be curious like I I
856.84s: don't see how we can do it we we've
858.88s: exhausted a huge amount of our
861.52s: Weaponry um we're more concerned about
864.68s: China really than Russia and I think
867.32s: Trump is provably more concerned about
869.84s: China than Russia so I I I just don't
872.08s: see it and and by the way if you're
873.76s: going to lose and once everybody sort of
875.80s: understands that you're going to lose
876.60s: these things T to collapse pretty
879.04s: quickly yeah no I think you have a an
881.76s: interesting perspective I think the the
884.52s: only followup I would have there then is
886.80s: why is the war still going if Russia is
890.36s: this giant superpower it's super close
893.68s: to the line of conflict it has this
896.12s: industrial complex it can steam Ukraine
899.32s: and yet the war is going on so two
901.80s: reasons um from the Russian side Putin
904.08s: is genuinely interested in minimizing
906.24s: Russian casualties so slow steady don't
909.48s: let your troops outrun your um your
912.24s: drone coverage um you know uh and by the
915.60s: way he has he has stated his military
917.44s: objectives which is the four regions
919.20s: which they're he now considers Russia um
922.68s: and then on the Ukrainian side zalinsky
924.12s: has no room to maneuver right I mean you
925.44s: have this far right band right um
929.16s: portion of of of Ukraine which um has
933.64s: zero desire for compromise and would
935.32s: rather sort of die trying to push the
936.96s: Russians out and the moment zalinski
939.56s: takes a step towards compromise I think
941.20s: his personal position would
942.80s: be um very
946.00s: precarious um losing Wars is hard like
950.32s: if you just look through
952.32s: history um admitting that you have been
954.88s: defeated early enough to salvage
957.52s: something reasonable from the situation
959.24s: is almost
961.24s: impossible um and putting leaders in
963.44s: such positions is a no- win situation
965.96s: for them um and so a slow
969.88s: grind that ultimately inevitably ends in
972.72s: total defeat is sort of a boiled frog
975.88s: you know situation for those on the
977.96s: losing side of War again picking Wars we
981.08s: should have a very very high barrier to
983.64s: like getting involved in Wars because
985.60s: you could lose them um and as col pal
988.36s: says if you don't have a plan up front
989.72s: for overwhelming Victory what are you
991.12s: doing we had no such plan from the
993.32s: beginning like there was no scenario
994.56s: where we were going to impose a kinetic
996.36s: defeat on Russia from afar um maybe we
1001.60s: were naive enough to think that from the
1003.04s: beginning but after the first few months
1005.24s: it should have been clear that that was
1006.36s: unlikely to happen certainly after the
1008.64s: large counter offensive from Ukraine was
1010.40s: defeated by Russia um at that point like
1014.24s: you know the war is over and again if
1016.48s: you just go back through history Eric
1017.96s: like Napoleon you know pick your
1020.92s: favorite like people roll into Russia
1023.68s: and then what happens they get ground
1025.80s: down to a p Russia is not afraid to
1028.88s: fight a war of attrition and to win them
1031.28s: um so that's where we are I think that's
1034.12s: by the way not a controversial opinion
1035.72s: anymore we may have been early to that
1037.48s: opinion but I think that's broadly if
1040.12s: you just read The Economist and the
1041.64s: financial times and the British papers
1043.24s: are starting to come around to the fact
1045.40s: that maybe this war is not winnable and
1047.68s: we should begin to sort of Salvage
1049.28s: what's left but it's very difficult to
1050.72s: lose a war losing a
1052.80s: war um in a way that minimizes the
1056.64s: totality of negativity on your country
1059.84s: takes a level of statesmanship that is
1062.48s: very very rare um and by way it
1065.84s: statesmanship involves convincing the
1068.64s: people you lead to go along with it and
1071.12s: and sometimes it's just impossible so
1073.32s: you know it again it's a terrible
1075.08s: situation the biggest losers in all of
1076.76s: this by far like scandalously so or the
1079.76s: people of Ukraine um you know the US can
1082.64s: wash his hands of it Trump could wash
1083.92s: his hands of it
1085.20s: and there might be some mild political
1087.52s: price to pay in the US but compared to
1089.76s: what has happened to the people of
1090.88s: Ukraine this has been a Calamity true
1093.84s: Calamity um one for which people should
1096.36s: be held to
1098.16s: account and one last question on this
1100.52s: one um while we're on it I I'm trying to
1104.68s: understand your perspective on Trump's
1107.80s: preference to eventually let this one go
1111.68s: with it being such a massive Global
1115.04s: focus in such a massive part of his
1117.64s: campaign I would see it hard to look at
1121.04s: it any other way than a colossal failure
1123.20s: on
1124.44s: Trump's on Trump's scorecard if so yeah
1128.96s: y go ahead no no no that's I think you
1131.00s: got it yeah so first of all it's early
1133.76s: for him right and if he puts enough W's
1136.60s: on the board maybe he can wash away an L
1138.28s: or two but I actually think more likely
1141.12s: is um for all the talk of a trump Putin
1143.96s: meeting I think there's going to be a
1145.76s: trump Putin X
1147.28s: Summit um where big broad spheres of
1150.76s: influence are
1152.16s: delineated and Trump gets concessions
1154.40s: and other areas and seeds Ukraine and
1158.04s: again anybody from Ukraine listening to
1159.40s: this will be quite angered by me
1161.92s: characterizing it in this way and I
1163.12s: fully understand that I'm just trying to
1164.72s: get into Trump's head I'm not telling
1166.00s: you what I would do um I think there's
1168.28s: going to be some Grand bargain look what
1169.48s: has Trump focused on since since he
1171.24s: became president Ukraine Panama Canada
1174.60s: colia Mexico Venezuela Western
1177.72s: Hemisphere spheres of influence Monroe
1179.80s: Doctrine um Ukraine's not on the board
1182.96s: um it's it's a true tragedy I'm I'm not
1185.84s: trying to to downplay it it is a
1188.08s: catastrophe but in a world where Trump
1190.56s: and G and Putin get together and decide
1192.96s: the world for the next 40 years it's not
1196.00s: like we're going to be able to convince
1197.20s: Putin to to
1199.28s: to to turn around and and just hand back
1201.36s: Ukraine to to Europe it's just I just
1203.16s: don't think it's going to happen and I
1204.36s: think as Traders as investors as analy
1206.88s: you have to see the pieces on the board
1208.16s: as they as they are and play them
1209.80s: accordingly sure yeah one last question
1212.88s: on this one and then um I actually want
1214.56s: to Pivot to talk to you a little bit
1216.04s: about the whole tariff game that's
1217.72s: happening but on the on the war as it
1220.44s: sits what are your thoughts specifically
1223.56s: on the way new technology is essentially
1226.68s: reshaping the ability for smaller forces
1229.92s: to be able to compete CU obviously as
1231.80s: you're doing your research on the battle
1233.76s: lines I'm sure you're coming across no
1236.00s: shortage of actual live videos or
1239.16s: recorded videos of the conflict as it
1241.04s: sits and you see $2,000 of drones
1244.64s: knocking out $15 million of equipment so
1247.60s: then it starts to call into question the
1249.56s: industrial capacity and the ability to
1251.32s: produce you know large weapons able of
1254.36s: reaching far a lot of these missile
1256.12s: systems and stuff like that the drones
1259.16s: have changed all of that so how does how
1262.52s: does that yeah how does that fit into
1264.04s: your
1265.04s: analysis yeah so I would say look I mean
1267.64s: full credit to Ukraine I mean they are
1270.20s: the second strongest military in Europe
1272.36s: today by a wide margin through the cauld
1274.80s: drum of having to fight right
1278.24s: um the technological development and the
1281.44s: necessity of doing so in order to sort
1283.56s: of stay one step ahead of your
1285.68s: competitor has made both Russia and
1288.24s: Ukraine
1289.40s: far stronger um technologically than
1292.32s: almost any other military in the world
1294.56s: and it's only because Russia is so much
1296.36s: bigger and and has such a stronger
1299.16s: military-industrial complex to rely upon
1300.88s: and frankly more people to uh entice to
1304.68s: join its Army um entice being sort of a
1308.08s: a purposely broad term
1311.40s: um like Russia is a far stronger
1314.32s: military force today out of necessity
1317.80s: than it was when
1319.56s: what Putin would call the special
1320.76s: military operation commenced in 2022 far
1324.32s: stronger than America um today and I
1326.80s: think China has been studying the
1328.24s: situation very carefully like Russia has
1330.40s: a million plus strong army or you know
1333.20s: military not just Army um and they have
1336.76s: been sort of you know trial by fire in
1340.48s: the most like brutal disgusting
1344.88s: horrifying way possible which is like a
1348.04s: a war in which a bunch of people die
1349.84s: every day I think like both sides are
1351.96s: suffering hundreds of casualties a day
1353.60s: we see the latest um evolution of fiber
1357.00s: optic controlled drones out of Russia
1358.52s: have you seen these where these super
1360.60s: thin wires like basically a giant
1362.52s: fishing line that spans kilometers and
1365.32s: these drones basically can't be
1367.24s: interfered with um using you know
1370.24s: electronic um um weapons and so they
1374.04s: just are flying now with full autonomy
1376.92s: all over the battlefield and I think
1378.64s: this has been the most recent of the
1381.24s: sort of technological developments that
1383.16s: is changing the piece of change on on
1385.12s: the front line because if you can't
1386.92s: really use you know electronic um um
1389.20s: interference weapons to uh distort the
1391.84s: path and and and aiming capabilities of
1394.24s: these drones and now you literally have
1395.72s: a hardwire drone flying through the air
1398.36s: with a super thin fiber optic cable
1400.68s: controlling it um that's just the latest
1403.84s: Innovation that would never have
1404.88s: happened if the if this war hadn't been
1407.72s: you know fought for the past three years
1410.20s: it's amazing by the way that we're
1411.40s: coming up on three years war um it's
1414.00s: really sad actually it's a real
1415.76s: indictment of of the current slate of
1418.64s: Western leaders that that we've allowed
1420.20s: this thing to go on for long as long as
1421.92s: we have but yeah huge amount of
1423.96s: technological development old weapons
1426.40s: that cost millions of dollars a pop
1428.00s: totally obsolete right um and then you
1431.44s: know beyond that sort of missile
1433.36s: development the oric missile which
1435.28s: doesn't get much press in the west but I
1437.84s: think really shocked and Open the Eyes
1439.88s: of of of NATO yeah I mean that necessity
1443.16s: is the mother of invention and there's
1444.48s: nothing more necessary than trying to
1445.80s: win a war and we're seeing an amazing
1449.76s: adaptation of AI and and drone
1452.52s: technology and and all the things that
1454.40s: should scare people you know autonomous
1457.28s: um robot technology I've seen some films
1459.68s: of by the way I should should say you
1462.56s: don't want to watch too many of these
1463.60s: films because there's a lot of like
1465.04s: actual real people dying in horrific
1467.52s: ways in the footage that you can see
1469.92s: online and every person that you see
1472.00s: dying is somebody's kid somebody's
1474.36s: sibling somebody's cousin somebody's
1476.04s: friend and um it's a real human tragedy
1478.76s: and and it
1479.76s: can one thing you don't want to do is
1481.56s: ever get sort of normalized to watching
1483.48s: such things um because it's it's it's
1485.92s: quite
1487.08s: sad can be yeah definitely can be really
1490.44s: interesting I I enjoy hearing your
1492.24s: perspective there's a lot of nuance to
1493.80s: it there's a lot of things um yeah that
1496.84s: I think are just a very interesting lens
1498.84s: to apply but I'd love to to Pivot now
1502.16s: and pick your brain a little bit on the
1506.12s: the game of tariffs that's a foot is
1508.76s: that how did you think that that was
1510.52s: going to play out and how is it trended
1512.44s: so far not sure if you saw it but we
1514.64s: just wrote about it um yesterday um and
1517.76s: so it was top of mind for us um we have
1519.68s: a lot of friends and connections to
1521.04s: Canada and we actually take Trump on on
1524.40s: this issue we take Trump at face value
1527.00s: um the fentanyl crisis is a real issue
1530.16s: we're losing 100,000 people a year to
1532.48s: overdoses in the country which is almost
1534.60s: certainly a significant
1536.44s: underestimation um 80% of those
1538.80s: overdoses are from fentanyl a lot of
1541.04s: those fentanyl overdoses are from people
1542.96s: using other drugs not knowing that
1544.48s: fentanyl has been cut in and so they
1547.00s: overdose by accident and they die this
1549.36s: is a chemical war declared upon the US
1551.56s: by China that largely targets military
1554.24s: AED um adults in the country and it's
1557.88s: long time that we get serious about
1559.56s: trying to stop it um most of the
1562.40s: fentanyl that Finds Its way into the US
1564.04s: comes in Via Mexico or Canada and
1569.08s: Canadians were shocked and angered and
1571.40s: bewildered at being lumped in with
1573.08s: Mexico as co-equal participants in the
1575.84s: sort of fenel trade but as we wrote in
1579.32s: our piece Undeclared um there's strong
1582.40s: circumstantial evidence to support
1584.24s: Trump's claims and the main counter sort
1587.88s: of argu ments that the Canadian media
1589.92s: and the Canadian government have been
1590.88s: putting forward don't really pass muster
1594.04s: and don't stand up to to close scrutiny
1597.28s: and you'll notice um you know there
1600.88s: there sort of this theory that Trump is
1602.28s: just a economic arsonist or a mad man
1605.20s: and orange man bad and all this stuff um
1608.60s: when he campaigned he said over and over
1610.08s: and over and over again I will make
1613.12s: fentanyl a top priority and I we use
1615.04s: tariffs to convince Mexico China and
1617.32s: Canada to do something about it that's
1619.64s: what he does the if you actually read
1622.40s: the executive order that um lays the
1625.12s: groundwork for these tariffs it begins
1626.76s: with
1627.48s: fentanyl within 24 hours after he
1630.28s: announced the tariffs um both Mexico and
1633.20s: Canada um pledge to do substantially
1636.36s: more on the fentanyl issue and Trump
1638.60s: says okay let's delay the tariffs until
1640.12s: we can negotiate a permanent settlement
1641.92s: like it's very clear he he called a shot
1645.64s: he explained why he was doing it he did
1647.72s: it the moment he got movement on the
1650.12s: main issue that was the driving force
1651.48s: for the tariffs he relented like
1653.96s: fentanyl is a real issue we we're losing
1656.28s: more people of fentanyl than we lost um
1658.48s: in the battlefield in World War II like
1661.00s: that will shock people to look at that
1662.40s: statistic we lost 400,000
1665.20s: soldiers dead in World War II for the
1668.00s: entirety of the war and we've lost that
1669.84s: many people to fent on the last four
1671.76s: years five years like it's a big deal um
1676.16s: it's destroying families and communities
1678.36s: across the country look there's a demand
1680.36s: side argument to be made and I get that
1684.12s: um but there's more that Canada and
1687.04s: Mexico and the us could do um and Trump
1691.96s: is is well within his his rights and
1694.60s: frankly we applaud to him for finally
1697.28s: making this uh an issue of the highest
1700.60s: priority for the US federal government
1701.96s: like if if not this then what you know
1705.00s: like we're we're losing a 100,000 people
1707.04s: young people
1709.44s: um it's a big deal and um there's far
1712.76s: more fentanyl being produced in Canada
1715.48s: than the Canadians would like to admit
1717.84s: and beyond that the Chinese gangs in
1720.36s: Canada Excel um at you know uh moneya
1724.64s: laundering and they've they've embarked
1727.36s: upon a synergistic collaboration with
1728.92s: the Mexican cartels to help them turn
1731.20s: their drug profits into money good and
1734.80s: and this is real and Trump is uh should
1737.20s: be applauded for for recognized now look
1740.36s: the bluntness of tariffs and Trump's
1743.00s: sort of style and statements leave a bad
1745.64s: taste in some people's mouth but on this
1747.40s: particular issue um we find ourselves
1749.60s: wholeheartedly supporting the
1752.36s: president yeah I I just like the way you
1754.80s: framed the the modality because I agree
1758.68s: it definitely can rub people all
1761.48s: different kinds of ways one of the one
1764.04s: of the things that I have to agree with
1766.00s: you on broadly though is that in order
1768.44s: to move things quickly you kind of have
1770.72s: to do things that are a little I don't
1773.64s: know Brash is the right term but
1775.12s: definitely a little heavier handed than
1778.80s: the standard bureaucratic process of
1781.76s: call a summit have leaders come talk
1783.92s: about it and so on and so forth because
1785.80s: to your broader Point think of how fast
1788.44s: they're now you know Mexico sending what
1790.72s: is it 10,000 troops you know to the
1792.72s: Mexico side of the Border just as a
1794.80s: loose
1795.92s: example yeah yeah and that and that
1798.40s: happened over the course of you know 48
1800.36s: hours so you don't really get speed like
1803.28s: that unless you do something a little
1805.68s: more drastic now I find an interesting
1809.04s: exercise is to think about what the next
1812.24s: month might look like though and
1814.64s: specifically the element that I think
1816.76s: your expertise will probably lend in in
1819.92s: understanding a lot better is let's say
1821.48s: 30 days go by and they're unable to
1824.68s: arrive at a conclusion or a deal I mean
1826.84s: my expectation honestly is that they
1828.24s: would because I think it's in
1829.00s: everybody's benefit but just you know
1831.52s: playing the scenario that maybe maybe
1833.20s: they
1834.28s: don't what do you think about the
1837.48s: implementation of tariffs then the retal
1839.88s: the retaliatory tariffs from Canada and
1842.72s: how that might shape the broader
1844.76s: economic picture at least in the near
1846.40s: term three six months-ish here's why a
1849.20s: deal has to happen
1851.36s: um exports from Canada to the US account
1854.88s: for 22% of Canadian GDP
1858.80s: and exports of the US to Canada account
1861.56s: for 1.5% us should be there's just no
1865.24s: leverage on the Canadian side like Trump
1867.96s: will dictate the terms and and Canada
1870.08s: will follow them that is the outcome
1872.68s: that is in everybody's economic interest
1874.92s: um and if they don't the terorists will
1877.68s: come on he'll probably put them up to
1879.64s: 50% um there will be a revolution of
1883.04s: some kind in Canada and there'll be a
1885.44s: new partner for Trump to negotiate with
1887.64s: um this one I again I have many many
1890.24s: close friends and other associates in
1892.56s: Canada and our peace provoked all manner
1895.12s: of
1895.84s: responses um on this one Canada would be
1900.36s: wise to be seen as doing as much as
1902.96s: possible and by the way it's an easy off
1905.16s: rant like who could be opposed to
1907.36s: rolling up fentanyl labs in rural
1909.72s: British Columbia who could be opposed to
1913.08s: tightening the border crossings across
1914.92s: the rural western part of the country um
1917.92s: you're going to pay all those soldiers
1919.04s: who have monitor the Border anyway um
1922.08s: and and who could be opposed to cracking
1924.68s: down on TD Bank and the moneya
1927.92s: laundering that they've been accused of
1929.56s: doing to enable the fentanyl trade like
1931.56s: fentanyl is a dastardly drug that all
1935.32s: law- abiding citizens should be fully
1937.40s: supportive of of of of eradicating from
1940.72s: our our Collective socities Canada too
1942.64s: by the way they Canada you know loses
1944.20s: three to 4 thousand citizens a year to
1946.60s: fentanyl overdose it's not quite at the
1948.76s: same Pace even correcting for uh
1950.80s: relative population that we see in the
1952.28s: US but it's still material every one of
1953.96s: those is a tragedy every one of those
1955.52s: deaths is somebody's kid um and and and
1959.28s: it should be eradicated and and the
1961.56s: Mexican cartels and the Chinese cartels
1964.04s: are deeply evil people like and and we
1967.16s: should be fighting them um me Mexico for
1970.40s: example has just huge potential Runway
1972.68s: which is a piece we're pondering writing
1975.60s: um for a variety of reasons if they
1977.96s: could just get their cartel situation
1979.16s: under control and I know it's been that
1980.60s: way for decades and it's a hard problem
1983.20s: but like same thing in Canada like look
1985.92s: we
1986.88s: have very strong evidence that there
1990.80s: are
1992.36s: dangerous
1993.92s: Chinese organized criminal
1996.56s: elements saturating British Columbia and
1999.20s: the City of Toronto mostly interfering
2002.16s: with Canadian elections um causing all
2005.00s: manner of crime um blowing the property
2007.36s: bubble in Vancouver and Toronto like it
2010.20s: used to be that you could say such
2011.64s: things without being accused of you know
2013.64s: xenophobia but it's true it's real
2016.04s: everybody knows it's real let's get a
2017.36s: handle on it like again one of the
2019.44s: things about Trump is he just sort of
2020.68s: has a knack
2022.44s: for saying sort of loudly and sometimes
2025.40s: inappropriately all the things that
2026.60s: everybody's thinking quietly let's just
2028.72s: go ahead and put it on the table and get
2030.40s: it
2032.52s: fixed so then to summarize that it
2034.88s: sounds like your overarching expect
2038.76s: is arrive at a deal it's impossible
2041.84s: impossible they wouldn't Eric I mean
2043.40s: come on I mean 22% of your
2046.68s: GDP I mean I mean we say that in to be
2049.96s: clear I actually agree with you but I
2052.56s: mean what's the point of even starting
2054.08s: them with retal retaliatory tariffs uh
2057.08s: you know Trudeau's lame duck wants to be
2060.16s: seen as strong this is a an injection of
2063.60s: uncertainty into an election campaign
2065.64s: that was imminent and looked likely to
2067.28s: be a deep defeat for the Liberals if
2070.64s: Trump if if if Trudeau could be seen as
2073.16s: standing up to the bully and fighting
2074.72s: for Canada then maybe whoever replaces
2076.56s: him on the ticket stands a better chance
2078.16s: of of minimizing the defeat that they
2081.28s: look set to suffer to the conservatives
2083.36s: I mean there's you know people optimized
2087.04s: for all kinds of uh outcomes in
2089.64s: situations like this um and look it gave
2092.68s: Trudeau a chance to to be relevant again
2095.80s: for one thing and and to his credit I
2098.20s: think he did actually a pretty good job
2100.48s: of handling the situation certainly
2101.80s: being portrayed as such in the Canadian
2104.20s: media which I follow closely um and you
2107.20s: know that the as we articulated in the
2109.24s: piece which we thought was pretty
2110.56s: balanced um this this move by Trump
2115.04s: sparked a rare moment of national
2117.12s: political Unity across Canada which is
2119.56s: not to be ignored and and isn't
2122.48s: inconsequential and so it changed the
2124.64s: game like that the least happy person is
2126.48s: Pier P you know like
2128.72s: waiting to ascend to the throne of prime
2130.68s: minister of Canada then suddenly the
2132.16s: entire rules of the game change that's
2134.12s: not good when you have a winning hand
2136.00s: you want stability and this is a deeply
2138.00s: destabilizing event when you have a a a
2140.96s: losing hand uh instability is is is a
2144.08s: potential opportunity and so and look
2146.20s: Trudeau handled it well he relied on you
2149.00s: know there's these sort of Council of us
2150.68s: relations within Canada and and Lord
2153.20s: knows within Canada The Stance and
2155.40s: negotiation towards the United States is
2157.08s: probably the most important political
2158.32s: issue on the board and and Trudeau again
2161.92s: to his credit um handled the situation
2165.16s: quite well and look I'm no fan of
2167.00s: Trudeau like we've written very
2169.00s: critically about Trudeau over the years
2170.80s: especially his sort of um totalitarian
2174.76s: instincts around the freedom Convoy and
2176.60s: all that stuff but in this particular
2178.32s: case isolated to the event that issue um
2181.64s: trudo comes out looking pretty good in
2183.16s: my
2184.96s: view one of the things I noticed when
2187.36s: the the tariffs are coming out I have a
2189.48s: a bunch of people in my audience that
2191.36s: are Canadian and you could definitely
2192.72s: tell that there's a lot of people that
2193.84s: were just kind of like pissed off about
2196.16s: it right it felt like yeah it felt like
2198.96s: our neighbor is being lame and why is it
2201.44s: like this and one of the arguments I saw
2203.24s: posed that was pretty interesting um was
2207.68s: the fact that Canada represents a really
2210.16s: significant portion and this is right up
2211.76s: your alley of us heavy oil imports so
2216.80s: not crude but sand oil and the US
2220.88s: doesn't really have deep production of
2223.60s: that in place just yet I think that
2225.68s: there are different ways that the US
2227.04s: would manage through it but just to play
2229.52s: out the scenario because it's an
2230.60s: interesting thought
2232.20s: exercise tariffs let's say 30 days for
2236.00s: whatever reason the impossibility does
2237.72s: occur and they don't arrive at a an
2239.72s: agreement maybe it's political maybe
2241.72s: it's part of the to your to your broader
2244.84s: Point part of this broader election
2246.40s: whatever the scenario is
2248.24s: and let's just say that the scenario
2250.80s: escalated somehow to where Canada says
2254.44s: we are going to cut sending you heavy
2258.12s: oils now I I think that that's kind of
2260.60s: suicide for Canada but just for the lens
2263.12s: of the US how does something like that
2267.44s: impact the US and how do you think the
2269.96s: US would navigate through that kind of
2272.80s: decision I'm going to give you an answer
2274.72s: that'll surprise you um can Canadians
2277.84s: are vastly vastly overestimating the
2280.84s: leverage that we sell the us heavy oil
2283.36s: brings to them um refiners who are
2287.28s: optimized to refine heavy crude prefer
2291.08s: to refine heavy crude because they have
2293.68s: made the Investments necessary to take
2296.00s: sulfur out of heavy crude and heavy
2298.72s: crude tends to be cheaper that doesn't
2300.88s: mean that they can't refine other crude
2305.40s: and so there's this thought that if
2307.80s: Canada shuts off the spigots that
2309.68s: somehow the US will um find itself in a
2312.68s: refined products crisis and that's just
2315.00s: not true um we export we the US I live
2318.64s: in the US um the US exports light crude
2322.68s: and imports heavy crude because the
2324.84s: newest refineries out
2327.56s: there prefer to refine light crude and
2330.56s: the old refineries here prefer to refine
2334.20s: heavy crude it doesn't mean they
2335.84s: couldn't make due with the light crws
2337.96s: that we have it'd be suboptimal um you
2341.04s: know they might not run at full capacity
2343.00s: and some of their operational units
2345.08s: might be idled um but in the long run
2348.88s: the US which has by the way massive
2351.84s: stores of these refined products and who
2353.60s: go many many weeks um with you know
2357.36s: while the refiner retooled and and work
2359.72s: through the inventory they have online
2361.20s: like this is um compared to the 22% of
2364.60s: your GDP being reliant on US exports
2366.92s: this is no leverage at all and these are
2369.76s: the happy stories you tell yourself when
2371.68s: you have no leverage again I'm sort of
2373.36s: reminded of Ukraine um the US would be
2377.56s: in a far better place to handle a a u
2382.40s: slowdown in the Imports or even a
2384.52s: complete cessation of the Imports of
2386.16s: heavy crude from Canada um it would be
2389.20s: suboptimal people wouldn't make as much
2390.84s: money but the US gas pumps would not run
2393.80s: dry I you know um and by the way
2397.92s: um it would uh accelerate the necessary
2400.36s: Investments needed to optimize the US
2402.76s: Refinery Fleet for light grades which
2405.12s: would then permanently reduce any
2406.72s: leverage fleeing as it might be that
2409.08s: Canada might have and so when I see such
2412.16s: commentary in the media cringe because
2414.28s: it it tells me that the people actually
2415.56s: don't know what they're talking about
2417.36s: and that it might uh inform political
2419.60s: leaders to make decisions based on
2421.08s: Leverage they think they have that
2422.04s: doesn't actually exist um you know the
2425.20s: US petroleum industry is exceptionally
2428.28s: sophisticated and they aren't trapped in
2431.00s: some like oh my God we need Canadian
2432.92s: heavy crout we'd like to buy Canadian
2435.16s: heavy crude at a discount WCS is a
2438.12s: discount and why should I pay up to buy
2441.24s: this light crude um that others in
2443.48s: foreign lands are willing to pay up for
2445.32s: when I could buy my um cheap crude here
2447.64s: and and capture a bigger spread when I
2449.16s: sell my gasoline and my jet fuel and my
2450.76s: diesel that there's a a vast difference
2453.04s: between economic optimization and
2454.96s: economic necessity and and this is a
2457.92s: card that I think is is wildly ere
2460.12s: exaggerated uh in the Canadian media
2462.08s: today to the Canadians Jetman yeah yep I
2466.40s: I fully agree with that one and the the
2468.24s: other part that I was doing a little bit
2469.84s: of research on is just e even if we
2472.60s: needed if the US needed to find some
2474.96s: sort of shortterm replacement there are
2478.00s: other places that produce crud as well
2482.08s: globally traded yeah right it's glob
2484.12s: just turn the spigots on in Venezuela I
2486.48s: mean you know Mexico but like it's
2489.04s: produced all over the world it's it's
2490.80s: it's floating around in cargo ships if
2492.84s: we truly needed it we could just pay up
2494.40s: and buy it um the US is not going to run
2497.28s: out of gasoline diesel or jet fuel
2498.92s: because Canada turns off the Taps just
2501.52s: isn't yeah the US is a global energy
2504.20s: superpower and the reorientation of the
2507.24s: system given the price disparities that
2509.44s: would temporarily materialize would only
2511.56s: further erode Canada's leverage over
2514.20s: time right now speaking of energy and
2518.68s: just what that might look like for the
2520.32s: year we obviously talked last time about
2522.20s: some of Trump's policies about you know
2524.60s: drill baby drill and the the different
2527.00s: things that we might expect to see from
2529.72s: an energy Evolution standpoint but I'd
2533.36s: love to get an update on any Key Energy
2537.16s: themes that you guys are seeing and
2540.32s: expect to play out this year yeah I mean
2543.56s: you know Chris Wright just you know
2545.56s: elevated to the SEC of energy um which
2548.40s: was a big vote that we were watching
2550.00s: very carefully earlier this week he's
2552.56s: taking aggressive action to implement
2554.72s: Trump's agenda I'm looking at the board
2557.84s: right now and I see WTI at
2560.96s: $70.50 you know basically at the low end
2564.64s: of opec's desired manag range um Saudi
2568.60s: Arabia needs 95 to 105 um to balance its
2572.20s: budget that's of the the financial Break
2574.48s: Even price of Saudi Arabia OPEC is on
2576.32s: its back foot
2577.80s: um I note with great interest that the
2579.84s: envoy that Trump sent to Venezuela
2582.08s: seemed to have pretty good success in
2583.52s: freeing some us hostages in air quotes I
2586.40s: don't know what they were up to in
2587.84s: Venezuela but they have since been
2590.08s: released um and other concessions um
2592.80s: being made by Venezuela i' I'd keep a
2595.28s: close eye on chevron's desire to get a
2598.44s: license renewed to continue to operate
2600.28s: in Venezuela um Trump seems to be
2602.56s: playing the Monroe Doctrine um this
2605.24s: whole concept that we need to increase
2606.80s: production in the US for Trump to
2608.72s: achieve his objectives which is $40 oil
2611.88s: to sort of put pressure on Putin and
2613.60s: maybe get a better deal in Ukraine um um
2617.08s: misses the fact that there are other
2618.28s: ways for Trump to increase Global oil
2619.96s: production right here in the Western
2621.00s: Hemisphere Guyana Venezuela um Argentina
2624.44s: I keep a close eye on Colombia which
2626.04s: seems to be taking a pretty uh combative
2628.92s: stance towards Trump and I wouldn't be
2630.88s: surprised if we see regime change there
2633.08s: sometime this year a very interesting
2635.16s: situation to follow um so there's plenty
2638.44s: to do at home and Trump has signaled
2640.60s: that he's interested in doing those
2641.76s: things at home um and it's not just the
2644.04s: US I mean if Exxon Mobile radically
2647.08s: increases Drilling and production in
2650.28s: Guyana how is that different than the
2652.52s: peran base and increasing production
2654.48s: right I mean it's an American company
2656.68s: you know um leading a joint venture
2659.20s: which actually by the way includes a
2660.80s: Chinese company um increasing Global
2663.60s: Supply of oil the Chinese are interested
2664.96s: in lower oil prices too uh and so you
2668.52s: know I I just think looking at the board
2670.72s: right now while hugging the bottom end
2672.96s: of the preferred managed range of OPAC
2675.96s: um hard to see what the catalysts are
2677.36s: for a significant upside from
2679.28s: here interesting and I know they got to
2682.44s: run in a couple minutes one two more
2684.96s: questions the first one is looking at
2688.16s: the global stage right now obviously
2690.48s: there's so much talk about you know
2695.44s: Canada Mexico
2697.64s: Russia Ukraine and you mentioned earlier
2699.96s: an important player that just has seemed
2702.16s: to have kind of been a little more quiet
2703.92s: until the Tariff conversation earlier
2706.36s: this week and that's China so where does
2709.84s: China fit into the broader mix the
2712.20s: broader Global and geopolitical scale as
2714.88s: you can see um just from like a Curr
2717.04s: current thematic
2718.40s: perspective I think China's playing its
2720.72s: cards exceptionally well as it always
2723.36s: does I think it's a serious error to
2725.76s: underestimate your
2727.76s: geopolitical opponents I think if Marco
2730.12s: Rubio is indeed out there talking about
2733.60s: spheres of influence and
2735.24s: multipolarity um this is music to
2737.12s: Chinese
2738.04s: years um they have been the Arsenal in
2741.84s: support of Russia's imminent victory in
2744.16s: Ukraine and between those two countries
2746.76s: and the great catastrophic geopolitical
2750.40s: disaster of driving them together that
2753.12s: happened in the last four years which is
2755.16s: something the US has tried to avoid for
2756.60s: decades by the way um this strong
2759.68s: cohesion between Russia and China is
2761.12s: going to be a formidable competitor to
2762.64s: the US in a new multi-polar world and I
2765.24s: think China is emboldened to gradually
2768.16s: take back Taiwan in the way that it
2769.64s: wants to which is without armed conflict
2772.88s: um and I don't know what Trump can do um
2777.00s: in a world where where that begins to
2779.12s: happen because it's not like we can
2780.92s: project uh enough power from here to
2783.88s: there especially when China controls so
2785.28s: much of our military industrial supply
2786.68s: chains and especially as we've learned
2788.44s: in Russia that proximity to the
2789.72s: battlefield is is really determinative
2793.40s: and there's nobody closer to Taiwan than
2795.16s: China I mean by definition it's right
2797.00s: there um so um X is sitting back um the
2802.48s: nice thing from China's perspective not
2805.72s: necessarily from ours but if you're
2807.36s: China um you you don't have an urgency
2810.44s: you know you don't have that four-year
2811.76s: electorial cycle you don't have the need
2813.36s: to be seen as doing something
2814.64s: consequential in your first 100 days
2817.36s: China thinks in decades it has all the
2820.72s: cards by doing nothing it continues to
2823.56s: win I expected to keep doing nothing
2826.00s: like why would it
2827.24s: provoke a war over Taiwan now when it
2831.00s: could just continuously and gradually
2833.44s: and incrementally achieve its objectives
2835.80s: in a way that doesn't disrupt its
2837.32s: economy and doesn't force it to fight
2839.76s: and next thing you know wake up one day
2841.12s: in a Checkmate um and I think that's
2843.28s: what they're going to do um I think X
2846.00s: would certainly attemp and a summit
2848.28s: between Putin and Trump uh if for no
2851.84s: other reason that they would know that
2853.32s: it's two onone and I think China and
2856.60s: Russia have a pretty good read on Trump
2858.76s: by the way his ego and uh what drives
2862.16s: him and and what his needs are and how
2864.52s: they could Jiu-Jitsu those needs for
2866.76s: their own objectives I mean I I you know
2868.80s: if if you're just being objective and
2869.96s: you take a step back like Trump is not
2871.60s: really a complicated guy um and
2875.32s: so it's going to be be fascinating to
2877.48s: see we of course are nothing more than
2879.84s: interested observers um but I think
2882.96s: China um has its own challenges
2885.00s: internally and people point to them all
2886.52s: the time although the same people point
2888.48s: to various challenges in Russia that
2889.88s: never seem to materialize in anything
2891.36s: meaningful um demographics and the
2893.76s: property buff and all that other stuff
2896.36s: uh I don't know it kind of reminds me of
2898.36s: the p b guys um you know anly looking
2901.08s: for well depletion rates in the peran
2903.00s: for proof that we're about to fall off
2904.72s: the cliff in global oil production um
2907.60s: but nonetheless I I would say that um my
2910.40s: own personal history in dealing with and
2913.28s: being in and around China uh in my
2916.32s: industrial career um they're not to be
2918.56s: taken lightly um they they they play the
2922.00s: game on a horizon that is longer than
2924.48s: ours they're infinitely patient um
2928.00s: they're more than happy to take the free
2929.64s: we you know the the free bees um as we
2932.48s: as we toss them up uh and then wait for
2934.36s: the next one and uh and and shall see
2937.28s: but I I think um the odds of a sort of
2939.72s: kinetic conflict over Taiwan I think are
2941.36s: going down with each passing day as it
2943.76s: becomes apparent that that would just be
2945.12s: sort of a losing battle so um and I
2947.40s: think that's their objective you know
2948.76s: like U nobody should want war um the
2951.24s: Chinese haven't really started a war
2953.68s: that I can remember in in modern history
2955.76s: and so why would they want us to provoke
2957.56s: one now over the Taiwan
2959.92s: issue definitely and I think while I
2963.24s: agree with the element of like Supply
2964.92s: chains and stuff like that that that
2966.48s: actually is one of the the Hallmarks of
2969.28s: US military is our ability to project
2971.28s: power and we we've spent a lot of a lot
2974.20s: of resources developing carrier strike
2976.20s: groups and things like that and that's
2978.20s: not to weigh in whether or not that's
2979.84s: the deciding factor between winning a
2981.76s: conflict wrapped around Taiwan or not
2983.56s: but to your broader Point that's just
2985.48s: the path of more resistance for
2986.88s: everybody and it looks like in the US
2989.32s: we're starting to try to incentivize
2990.96s: more domestic chip production and if
2992.96s: that happens then the stake in Taiwan
2994.68s: from the US perspective starts to Wayne
2996.32s: and you know so on and so forth so let
2998.28s: me ask you a question do you think a US
3000.20s: carrier strike group could resist an
3001.88s: oresnik missile attack today and do you
3004.48s: think that right you actually think that
3006.12s: I that be interesting to see I I I don't
3008.40s: do um we could agree to disagree um but
3012.44s: if if if they can't that's a game
3014.20s: changer you would agree right like um if
3017.08s: certainly yeah if Hypersonic missiles
3020.36s: can penetrate the anti-missile shields
3024.08s: of us carrier groups then us carrier
3025.80s: groups become a lot less relevant so I
3028.96s: mean you certainly have more experience
3030.48s: in this space than I do um but I I I
3033.00s: would be let's put this way if Russia
3035.40s: and China believe that they can't I
