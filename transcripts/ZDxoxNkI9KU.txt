0.00s: Welcome to Outlier Options Trading Tips where I teach you something in three minutes or
4.76s: less, let's get right to it.
6.00s: One of the most common mistakes new options traders make is when they're analyzing something
12.68s: just like Visa for an example because it's up and we want to take a position on it.
17.68s: We think it might continue to go up.
20.08s: We're not exactly sure what timeframe it might continue to go up, but as we take a look
24.64s: over at the options chain, we can see that there are a lot of different explorations
29.28s: available to us and we say, well, I think it might happen in 25 days.
34.36s: So a lot of novice traders do is they pick this 25 day expiration because in their
41.56s: idea, the trade might play out sometime over the next 25 days.
46.28s: What's the problem with this?
48.28s: Well, I'll show you exactly the issue.
51.76s: If we take a look at two different scenarios with the same exact trade, you're right
58.80s: above my head, you can see you can't see a lot of the trade details don't worry about
62.32s: it, or essentially buying it at the money call in Visa using two different explorations.
67.12s: There's 16 Jan 26.
69.44s: So that's a little over 300 days away.
71.88s: And then there's 21 March 25, which is pretty close.
75.16s: It's 20 something days away.
77.08s: And we might say, well, my idea corresponds with this 21 March 25 expiration.
82.12s: So I'm going to buy these ones also.
84.32s: They're way cheaper.
85.76s: These are only $750.
87.72s: Whereas the 16 Jan 26 is their 3790 much more expensive.
91.72s: So let's click into this.
93.28s: And I want you to pay attention to a specific column this one right here, the delta and
98.96s: then the theta.
100.32s: So for those that don't know, delta is the rate of change of your premium per one point
104.52s: movement underline.
105.52s: So you have about a 51 delta on these options.
108.28s: You take a look at your theta.
110.16s: You're losing $21 in 45 cents per day.
116.40s: You have to pay attention to this number because the longer your idea doesn't come to pass,
123.68s: the more your options decay.
126.84s: So what that does is it requires a larger and larger move in order for you to subsequently
133.24s: make money.
134.24s: Now if we take a look at this longer data option, and we take a look at the delta, this
137.76s: one is a 61 delta.
139.16s: So slightly higher delta, but if you take a look at your theta, even though it's much
143.28s: more expensive, you're only losing $6.42 per day.
147.36s: So what this means is this longer term option, you might not expect to hold it for that
151.32s: whole duration, but it's kind of like a down payment.
153.40s: It's something that you put out for a little while with the expectation of taking it down
157.92s: sooner, but this decreases your daily faded decay.
161.00s: Now there's more that goes into the equation than this obviously, but this is something
164.48s: you should consider being out there.
166.08s: See you later.
