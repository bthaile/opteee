0.20s: the Greeks are seemingly confusing but
3.64s: really simple and once you know how to
5.56s: use them they become second nature to
8.00s: help you build smarter trades the goal
11.24s: of this video is to walk you through a
13.28s: step-by-step process on how you can
16.44s: default on what makes the most sense
18.84s: based on what you're trying to do for an
20.40s: individual trade so that the Greeks seem
23.16s: way less overwhelming and this is stuff
25.40s: that you can quite literally practically
27.20s: apply whenever you feel like it the way
29.44s: to think about the Greeks is they're
31.40s: like the instrument cluster to your car
34.44s: it gives you a lot of information it
35.84s: tells you if your car is running hot and
38.96s: potentially going to overheat it tells
40.40s: you if your oil pressure is good if your
41.96s: oil temperature is good so on and so
43.56s: forth that is exactly what the Greeks do
47.16s: so they can seem overwhelming but really
49.92s: they just give you information on how an
53.40s: option or grouping of options known as a
55.48s: structure or strategy is going to behave
58.52s: so let's talk talk about Basics here now
62.44s: I have a video that goes pretty deep
64.40s: into detail on the Greeks so I'm going
66.52s: to spend very little time on the basics
68.72s: and I want to speak more so from the
70.76s: practical application of using them to
72.36s: build smarter trads but for those that
74.88s: need a reminder on the basics you can
76.64s: gloss over this very quickly and you'll
79.16s: be essentially caught up now one admin
81.72s: note is that these are what we consider
84.36s: the primary Greeks some of them would
86.76s: call these the first order Greeks but
88.96s: really they're not because gamma is not
92.16s: a first order Greek it's a secondorder
94.32s: Greek which is a nerdy cocktail party
97.36s: fun fact that nobody cares about but you
99.80s: should know the way to think about first
102.24s: order second order third order simply
104.36s: pertains to what does the Greek measure
106.92s: notice how for Delta Theta Vega row it
110.64s: has everything to do with premium rates
113.92s: of change relative to something
117.52s: pertaining to the option notice how
120.08s: gamma is not the premium rate of change
122.84s: but the Delta rate of change so second
125.64s: order Greeks tell us how some of the
128.08s: other Greeks might behave given
130.00s: movements now from a retail trading
132.04s: perspective you don't really need to
133.68s: care that much about it if you're
135.08s: curious I actually built a chart in this
137.32s: other video that I'll link to below that
139.04s: goes through all of the different orders
141.24s: of Greeks there's even more than this
142.68s: technically but you can go beyond third
144.80s: order Greeks talking about things like
146.48s: color speed Ultima Zama it goes deeper
149.44s: than that but for the general person you
151.76s: don't need more than this now you do
153.84s: need to know some of the general traits
156.76s: of the primary Greeks notice how row is
160.08s: not on here and that's because interest
162.04s: rates do not tend to move that much the
164.96s: way to think about row is when you're in
167.28s: interest rate sensitive environments
168.84s: like we are now it becomes a little more
170.36s: topical but in general the risk-free
173.12s: rate relative to an options expiration
175.88s: is generally pretty static so let's
179.48s: first eyeball how Delta behaves across
182.84s: different expirations do you notice how
185.64s: on this 31 DTE which is the white line
188.16s: compared to the 325 DTE do you notice
190.36s: how the white line is actually quite
192.08s: steep for the at the monies and as well
195.64s: as the further out of the money that has
198.80s: everything to do with what is happening
200.96s: to Delta as you get closer to expiration
204.12s: if an option is out of the money the
206.68s: Delta is going to approximate to zero we
209.36s: can take a look at that in something
210.76s: like Nvidia let's take a look at this
212.48s: zero DTE options chain notice how the
215.32s: out ofth the- money options are
216.84s: literally at zero and these ones that
219.48s: are showing one these will be zero and
222.64s: the options that are in the money will
224.04s: have a Delta of one so as time passes a
228.44s: Delta has to approximate to one of those
230.96s: two states and only one of those two
233.36s: states one or a zero that's why you'll
235.40s: see it get steeper over time this
238.44s: matters a lot because it's going to
240.12s: impact the way that your trades might
242.72s: behave so say for example that we're
246.44s: holding in out of the money option in
249.96s: something like Nvidia and let's say that
252.48s: we started with something that was 7
254.84s: Days taxation we bought something that
256.36s: was like a 10 Delta and this is again 7
260.36s: days to go well as time passes unless
264.08s: this option moves closer and closer to
265.72s: the money this is actually going to lose
268.48s: Delta and again you can see that
270.80s: reflected here because that same option
274.04s: that we were just looking at the 10
275.36s: Delta which is a 124 strike if we take a
279.00s: look at the 1244 strike with Z DTE is is
281.80s: zero so that's one of the issues with
284.40s: really short durate duration out of the
286.56s: money options is they're actively losing
288.84s: Delta you have to be aware of that so if
292.88s: we look at Theta the main thing to know
294.72s: for Theta is that it decays as a rate
298.96s: higher
300.36s: as you get closer to expiration and it
302.08s: really starts to pick up once your 60
303.88s: DTE now there are nuances to this
306.84s: because if you have an option that is at
308.72s: the money where there's more extrinsic
310.72s: value versus an option that's really
312.80s: deep in or out of the money where
314.84s: there's less extrinsic value it'll be a
317.32s: little bit lower gamma ramps up as we
321.00s: get closer to expiration because again
322.88s: we just talked about this with Delta
324.12s: Delta has to make a choice and Gamma
326.56s: measures the rate of change of Delta so
329.80s: this is important because of some of the
331.84s: traits we'll talk about with Building
333.40s: Trades with respect to gamma and then
335.88s: Vega you'll notice is typically more
339.08s: elevated the further out in time we go
340.88s: because Vega operates in the extrinsic
343.08s: value of an option so this means that if
345.08s: you're trying to trade something related
347.36s: to the volatility expansion of an option
350.24s: you might actually want to go slightly
352.60s: further out of the money because it will
354.16s: have a bigger impact provided that the
356.92s: impact of implied volatility is relative
359.08s: to that time frame so I want to fast
361.88s: forward to this this is really a
364.92s: checklist that you can use to help think
368.16s: through how to use these and I want to
369.68s: use some examples with you so let's take
372.92s: a look at Delta and let's take a look at
374.92s: Delta in a vacuum Delta is agnostic to
377.52s: time frame meaning if I go out 500 Days
381.04s: these will still have all different
382.64s: kinds of Deltas they'll be skewed
385.40s: differently this is because of
386.36s: volatility don't necessarily go super
388.24s: far into detail on that but you'll
389.96s: notice that the at the money for the
393.16s: strike the 134 is actually 66 Delta so
397.04s: but you'll notice that Delta is whatever
399.04s: it is this is one of the reasons why if
401.64s: you're buying options a lot of times it
403.72s: can make sense to go further out in time
406.80s: because we're decreasing the amount of
408.84s: Delta Decay that we're experiencing and
411.80s: Delta is whatever it is so that means
414.16s: that if I buy something that has a
415.56s: higher Delta it's going to move closer
418.72s: dollar for dooll removing the underlying
420.64s: while mitigating some other factors that
422.36s: we'll talk about one of the downsides to
424.60s: this though is your gamma will be lower
427.84s: so let's say that you're trying to buy
429.88s: cheaper options that have the ability to
432.60s: compound way more if I go to 7 days to
435.80s: expiration and I take a look at the
437.28s: gamma for these for the at the Mone is
438.68s: they're five and the out of the money is
440.76s: there's two three and four if I look at
443.76s: that same thing 70 days out notice how
445.72s: the gamma is essentially a one or a two
448.40s: much much lower so what that tells you
450.48s: is the further out in time you go the
453.52s: lower your gamma inherently is going to
455.56s: be and that means that the rate of
457.72s: change of your Delta will be slower this
460.32s: is why for something like ratio
462.16s: diagonals when I go at least 60 90 days
464.80s: out I'm picking things that have a
467.24s: higher overall Delta because I know I'm
471.04s: not going to get a big Boost from gamma
473.76s: if I'm trying to trade a short-term
475.40s: movement I might go a little nearer term
478.16s: in time and pick something that might
480.80s: rapidly compound because of a very high
483.20s: gamma because if we think about the time
487.12s: value of options going back to this
491.04s: little graph is they're very DTE
494.32s: sensitive and there's two ways we need
496.84s: to look at Theta we can track it as
500.20s: Theta itself but we can look at it in a
502.88s: gross Manner and a relative Manner and
505.88s: I'll show you what that means so options
508.60s: that have long days to expiration will
510.80s: naturally have more Theta and let's go
514.32s: out to these 280 DTE and we take a look
518.00s: at THU you'll see that for the in the
519.56s: monies it's 3 cents 4 cents 5 cents for
522.08s: the at the monies and then goes back
523.56s: down for the out of the money so that
525.84s: means every single day on these options
527.36s: for the at the monies they're going to
528.56s: lose about $5 that's their Theta for 20
532.40s: 280 days out if I come in here to 35
535.80s: days out you'll notice that Theta is 6
539.60s: cents 10 cents it's 11 cents for the at
541.92s: the money so it's about double it's very
543.44s: very high and then you'll notice
545.28s: something interesting if I go into the 7
546.84s: DTE and we take a look at Theta you'll
549.24s: notice that it's super super high we
552.12s: have 23 cents that's because these are
554.32s: decaying away literally today into
556.72s: whatever they're going to be so all of
558.24s: this value has to bleed out and then if
560.72s: we go really close data expiration and
563.72s: this is using zero but you can use even
565.44s: closer than this you can actually find
568.40s: that Theta will slow down and on a
571.84s: relative basis let's take a look at spy
573.60s: this will have more expiration so that
575.00s: you can kind of see what I'm talking
576.28s: about if I look at 7 days to expiration
579.44s: my Theta for an at the money is about 33
583.52s: cents if I look at a 3 DTE and I look at
586.36s: my Theta for an at the money it's about
588.76s: 23 cents why is it less well it's
591.56s: because as you get really close in time
593.48s: there's less overall x trinic value to
597.72s: come out but
599.92s: if you look at 23 cents relative to
602.44s: something that is worth a dollar and you
605.52s: compare that to something that's this is
608.72s: 24 against something that's
612.64s: $280 even though this can be lower at
617.36s: times on a relative basis it's huge this
620.32s: is about a quarter of the remaining
622.44s: value whereas this is not quite and I
625.08s: realized before I think I said 33 I
627.20s: meant to say 24 for the Theta value so
631.40s: that's the difference here and if we go
633.80s: further out in time to 35 DTE notice the
636.48s: Theta here is only 14 so overall amount
640.64s: of theta will be much more but you're
642.72s: losing less of it on a daily basis and
645.12s: this will continue as you go further and
646.56s: further out in time if we go 280 days
649.04s: out there's way more overall Theta but
652.20s: you're losing less of it on a per day
654.20s: basis it's kind of like a down payment
656.28s: to something so if I were to SU arize
660.20s: those main points for you and we already
661.84s: talked about Vega I don't think we have
663.60s: to go super far into it because I don't
665.04s: think Traders often are trying to
666.72s: isolate vegga specifically but for those
669.08s: options traders that are you should
671.76s: refer to this plot so if you're trying
675.00s: to trade the expansion or contraction of
677.40s: volatility of something we need to pay
680.28s: attention to Vega but you can see most
682.80s: of it from what I just showed you so if
684.32s: we come in here and we take a look at
685.52s: Vega or the at the monies these are 219
689.32s: 19 16 something like that and then if I
692.92s: go out here to the
694.60s: 35s Vega for these is
697.32s: 74 and then if I go out to these that
699.68s: are 70 they're a dollar for and that's
703.64s: because Vega operates in the extrinsic
706.08s: value of an option so if there's more
707.52s: extrinsic value there's a larger Vega
709.80s: impact now again this can be done as a
712.24s: gross value or relative value as a gross
715.28s: value A1 four on something that's $155
718.92s: is a different ratio than something
721.72s: that's 33 cents on something that's 280
725.36s: and change so the way to think about a
729.24s: lot of these metrics Theta Vega they're
733.12s: relative to the time frame but then
736.16s: they're also relative to the total
737.60s: premium of an option so here's the
740.52s: cliffnote summary if I buy an option
744.64s: that is a higher Delta it's going to be
747.04s: more expensive but it's going to move
748.84s: close for a dollar for dooll move in the
751.12s: underlying it's also going to compound
754.40s: less what that means is this one Delta
758.32s: there's no compounding value it's going
760.20s: to move $1 for each dollar move in the
762.96s: underly and it's going to be more
764.88s: expensive as compared to something that
766.88s: might be cheaper that I can buy more of
771.08s: that starts at a 30 Delta but for each
774.36s: $1 move in the underlying it's going to
776.68s: gain five deltas and then after another
779.92s: dollar move in the underlying it's going
781.24s: to gain six Deltas so it compounds very
785.12s: very quickly so the tradeoff here is
789.16s: higher Delta moves better dollar for
791.52s: dooll lower Delta depending on whatever
794.56s: gamma is lower Delta will be cheaper but
798.08s: you can buy more of them and then for
801.04s: gamma we just naturally hit on some of
803.56s: that gamma's going to be higher the
805.76s: closer you are in time which if you're
808.72s: correct
809.72s: will allow you to compound faster if
811.52s: you're buying your option but if you're
814.28s: wrong your option is going to Decay from
816.84s: Delta Decay as we get closer to
819.24s: expiration so you can strike a balance
822.44s: between these based on what kind of risk
824.56s: profile you're trying to achieve in your
826.00s: option now for Theta if you use let's
830.60s: say long options and you buy something
833.56s: that's s days to expiration your Theta
836.00s: as a gross value might be less but as a
839.80s: percentage of what you bought into is
841.80s: going to be way more the reason why this
844.00s: matters is because then as your 24 cents
849.08s: decays away from these
851.24s: $280 call options well that means that
854.48s: even if you get your dollar move and get
856.56s: 52 cents out of the Delta you're
859.08s: essentially paying 24 cents of that or
861.84s: $24 to counteract your Theta Decay now
866.04s: if you go further out in time to avoid
868.52s: that you're going to pay a larger gross
870.88s: amount but you're going to get less
873.88s: gamma you're going to get less of a
875.20s: compounding effect so this is why for a
877.56s: lot of buying strategies I prefer to
879.52s: going a little further out in time and
882.08s: at the money slash a little bit deeper
884.52s: in the money typically targeting around
886.44s: a 70 Delta now if I'm trying to compound
889.72s: an option more I'll come in a little
891.68s: closer in time and I'll pick something
894.36s: that's a little further out of the money
895.84s: from a buying perspective that still has
898.56s: a higher gamma that's going to ramp but
901.08s: this is a shorter Fus trade I need to be
902.96s: correct in a timely manner now if I'm
905.44s: selling premium I don't want to come
908.28s: super far in time because if I do that
910.84s: even though I collect a higher amount of
915.00s: theta relative to the price of the
916.76s: option I'm experiencing a lot of gamma
919.92s: to get it whereas if I pick something
922.92s: that's further out in time to
925.04s: sell and I might get let's say here I
929.08s: might only get $10 a day or something
932.20s: like that but I'm cutting my gamma down
934.36s: a lot and again $10 of theta here
938.08s: relative to the total premium is much
940.32s: less but $10 as a gross amount is way
944.60s: more than I might get for a commensurate
947.32s: option if I'm selling something that's
948.80s: super far out of the money or something
950.20s: like that so with Theta you want to look
952.36s: at it in both of those manners whether
954.12s: you're buying or selling relative to how
956.64s: much you stand to make if you're selling
959.00s: but then also as a gross value because
961.64s: another example here is if I sell let's
964.44s: say the same 30 Delta option here that
966.40s: has 7 days left to go well I'm getting
968.24s: 25 cents of theta if I compare that to
971.64s: the 35s I'm only getting 10 and then if
974.56s: I do compare that to something like the
976.44s: 3 Days To expiration same 30 Deltas I'm
980.04s: getting
980.84s: 19 so all of these provide a slightly
984.68s: different amount of money and again once
987.08s: it's taken relative to the total premium
988.96s: it makes a big difference but this is
991.08s: how you can use all of these different
993.28s: Greeks to naturally back you into a
996.40s: position so if you have any questions as
998.60s: always let me know be an outlier I'll
1000.32s: see you later
