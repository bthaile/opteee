210.50s:  reference
220.98s:  about
221.72s:  Cheryl
226.86s:  John
232.46s:  C on
234.80s:  buy a few people and yeah, I understand I get like why people are interested in this. So I'm happy to
242.96s:  talk about it. So the goal for the session today is to just talk a little bit about my path as a
249.20s:  trader. So I had a Google form set up and I ended up getting even more submissions to be completely
256.00s:  honest than I would have expected. So what I did to try to make the session a little more logical
262.96s:  is I bucketed them so that I kind of put them in different categories so that I can talk about the
271.36s:  topics in an order I think that that makes sense versus like a shotgun blast of stuff. I think
276.80s:  that might be kind of confusing. And even though really the session is branded and we're doing it
285.68s:  as like the path of an options trader and an AMA asks me anything sort of thing, I'm really not
291.12s:  thinking about this more so as like it being about me. I'm trying to frame it as the path of a
297.52s:  trader hence the title, right? And the goal is to spend more time focusing on how my path likely
306.56s:  will have many elements that you either have or will come across in your path. And the intention
316.56s:  that is hopefully to accelerate your movement through your path. Because one of the big things that
324.40s:  you'll find actually there's a couple questions in here about it about like mentorship and learning.
329.36s:  And like the overwhelming majority of what I've done has been largely self taught. I have had a
337.92s:  couple mentors that I'm going to talk about. But I think most of them probably are less prescriptive
347.76s:  than I think, then I think people might think they are. And I actually think that's a really
353.92s:  important admin note for us. So as always, we've got to say hello to everybody that's hanging out.
359.68s:  So I see we got Samota Joey M. Ram. That's a cool name. Elon songs. Shrej.
366.80s:  Shrej. Fun fact. One of the guys actually, I think he's, yeah, here, funny enough, here. Let me grab
374.56s:  this. I was going to start with this anyways, just so that people that don't know much about me,
380.16s:  they'll have a little bit of context. My goal is to go through this super fast. I just want people to
384.24s:  understand the the background. But anyways, this dude right here, he's at my house right now.
390.56s:  He's the guy that introduced me to investing. So anyways, Shrej, this comment specifically for you,
397.36s:  because he was checking out the elephant that you got me, which is super cool. It's out in my
401.60s:  living room. And he was asking about it. So yeah, you peaked his interest. He, you know, I have all
406.88s:  sorts of like random art pieces and stuff around the house, but he really like honed in on that elephant,
411.52s:  which is sick. So again, thank you very much. I really appreciate that.
415.12s:  We have a Pollo, Zachariah, Lauren. Hello, AI made horrible choices this week. Have to hear more about
423.84s:  that. We got Andrew Eric, my doppelganger, and Mick D from Southwest Florida, hell yeah.
431.36s:  And then we have Mr. Off Putin. There's Newberry. Isn't that very near West Point? Yeah, it's probably
437.04s:  less than two hours for sure, probably closer to an hour and change. I've been through West Point
441.76s:  a few times. We actually did like some of our physical evaluations there and stuff. So yeah,
447.04s:  really, really close. So yeah, one of the things that I wanted to start with, not AI, I, me,
456.24s:  darn typos. Oh no, Lauren, now I'm even more interested. What kind of horrible choices did you
463.68s:  make? We have to dive into that. So Off Putin says beautiful part of the Hudson Valley gorgeous.
472.80s:  The Hudson Valley itself is absolutely stunning. That's one of the cool things about the north east
479.44s:  is that if you take a look through the Hudson Valley, I mean, it's this is just beautiful.
487.28s:  It is absolutely, absolutely beautiful. There's so many cool elements. And I think one of the coolest
493.20s:  things about the Hudson Valley is the history. There's so much history there. But it's funny because,
500.24s:  well, damn, what the hell? That seems dramatic. I guess we, well, everybody's going to have a couple
505.76s:  haters. But yeah, I, the overall area is stunning. So we have Roaring Titty in the house. It's great
516.48s:  to see Roaring Titty. Everybody shout out to our fan favorite Roaring Titty. And we got Mick D from
522.16s:  New Pals. Yeah, New Pals is pretty sick. So the summary here is my start as a trader is probably
531.44s:  the same as most people because I very much did not come for money. I had single mom. Most of you
536.64s:  know all this stuff. Again, I'm not going to go super far into detail unless there's questions.
540.56s:  Obviously, feel free to ask anything. But the reason why I always go out of my way to highlight
547.04s:  that fact is because I think it's important to understand the starting point. And I think it's
554.88s:  important to understand, at least in my opinion, that trading is one of the very few things that
560.72s:  genuinely is accessible to everybody. It is. So it's not like something that you have to have in
569.68s:  somewhere. You don't have to have a connected parent that then connects you with an opportunity.
576.00s:  The markets are open to everybody. That's one of the coolest things about it is that it is
581.28s:  genuinely whatever you make of it, which is very, very cool because a lot of other things that
588.64s:  involve money, wealth, development of wealth, they actually are quite kind of tight groups where it's
596.24s:  like people pull each other in that they want to work with and stuff. That's not the case for
601.28s:  trading. Okay. So that's essentially the main background I wanted to share. I'm going to slide
606.64s:  this out of the way and then we can kick off with some of the questions. Now, again, these are the
613.28s:  questions that got sent in. If you have any questions as we go through these or any clarifying
618.24s:  questions as we go through these, throw them in the chat. I always prioritize the people that are
621.92s:  here live. Bose says, which books can you recommend? That's a great question. Love to start with that.
628.24s:  So from a learning perspective, if you dance over to the website and if you go to the options
637.60s:  trading guide for beginners, you'll notice down at the bottom, I give you a reading list.
646.16s:  And what I do is I highlight a handful of the, I really think you need to read these books.
652.16s:  I genuinely believe I cut this list down into the smallest grouping that I possibly could.
661.68s:  So what I'm saying is is I genuinely believe if you, if I were going to be a trader,
666.32s:  I would absolutely read all of these. But understanding that finite time, have to prioritize
673.60s:  what I try to do is highlight the ones that I really, really think should be read.
678.08s:  Now, there's a lot more than this. This is absolutely not even close to kind of like the full
687.60s:  reading list that I would recommend. But I think there comes a point where there's diminishing
693.52s:  returns on what you read. I genuinely do believe that. I think that you can learn a decent amount.
699.68s:  And then some of the early books that you read will be essentially revolutionary because they're
704.96s:  going to introduce you to things that you've never heard before, never considered stuff like that.
709.76s:  Then what you'll find is a lot of follow on books. They're helpful, but they have a much less
719.20s:  level of impact, the scope scales down a lot. And it's just because it's kind of like filling in blanks
725.92s:  here and there. Mick D says I've been wanting to share how the improvements to the website have been
730.40s:  awesome. That's awesome. I love to hear that. Yeah, I've had a few people from the community
734.16s:  help me with some ideas. And then my the biggest shout out is actually to giggles. I've had him on
739.76s:  the YouTube channel way in the beginning. We used to do a little thing together called tech talk
744.32s:  and just, you know, bullshit on a video together that I would post about technology.
749.36s:  And he was absolutely pivotal to like the design of the website, specifically with stuff like this,
757.36s:  like just using spaces and trying to have everything consolidated onto a page and stuff like that.
763.04s:  It's still you could tell it's still self-made, right? Like I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,
766.72s:  but I try to make it definitely a little more navigable at least as the idea.
772.00s:  So yeah, I'm glad that it's been useful.
774.56s:  Wigglyworm says you're talking about books to read. I am indeed. And it says, okay, what's a great
779.52s:  foundational book or two? Literally here. I show you. That's what I'm highlighting.
783.84s:  So the books that are highlighted on this list are exactly that. They're like the books that I think,
790.32s:  especially for an options trader. I think these have to fit into the equation.
794.72s:  Options as a strategic investment would be my go-to for like actually starting to trade options.
801.60s:  And then when we look at general markets like understanding markets, I really,
806.96s:  really like trading in exchanges because it goes into a lot of specific details about the process
814.00s:  of markets, how they behave, the different participants. And I actually think a lot of people
819.52s:  don't fully appreciate that for what it is. So I think that's probably why I have that as the
825.92s:  starting point, because I think that's actually super, super, super important context. And then I
830.40s:  think after that, you can go into, you know, again, wanting to trade options or other stuff like that.
837.68s:  But I think this is probably the right spot to go. LPB says, is there a karma sutra for traders?
845.60s:  What would the equivalents us? Let's ask chat GPT. I'm actually really, really curious which
850.00s:  chat GPT will answer this as I'm actually really, really interested. What is the options trading
860.80s:  equivalent of the karma? Is it karma or karma? Karma sutra book. Let's see.
875.60s:  I have to save this so I can post this in for you. Oh, this is so good. This is so funny.
896.80s:  All right. This is directly from GPT.
913.36s:  So for those that are wondering, it's a great question. And I'm glad it's one that we could
917.36s:  explore together. But we can see that the karma sutra is a text renowned for its complexity
926.80s:  and breath in the context of relationships. Would be a comprehensive guide that covers intricate
934.48s:  strategy, so on and so forth. The very first one is options as a strategic investment, which I
939.20s:  can't help, but find to be absolutely hilarious because that is essentially the book I most
946.16s:  commonly recommend to people. So I now feel like I can comfortably and confidently say,
957.12s:  I recommend the karma sutra equivalent of options trading. Literally perfect.
964.80s:  That's now I'm not even going to I'm not even going to think of the book in the context of options
970.72s:  as a strategic investment. I'm only now going to introduce that book as the karma sutra equivalent
977.52s:  for traders. That's about as sick as it gets. I love that. All right. So let's start running
986.80s:  through some of these. I don't know how long this is going to take. It'll go really however
990.80s:  amount of detail that you guys want me to go into. The way that I intend to answer these is kind
997.84s:  of give you a broad level overview so that I'm not fucking ranting about stuff. But then if there's
1003.92s:  specific elements of it or questions that you have as I go through some of these, let me know.
1010.08s:  And then I'll use that as my cue to dive in a little bit further. But otherwise, I'll just kind
1014.80s:  of give you a top line summary. And then yeah, see if that satisfied because my goal is not to
1020.24s:  spend time talking about the stuff that people aren't highly interested in. I want to stick to what
1025.12s:  is most interesting to you because again, the goal for this is to kind of use the last almost
1031.68s:  17 years of my trading experience as a bit of a lens for you, hopefully to look through where
1037.84s:  you're at in your trading career. And again, to give you some ideas on things to think about how
1042.32s:  to think about it, that kind of stuff. So early stages. The first one is what inspired you to
1049.28s:  start trading in 2007 and how did you approach learning the markets during your early years?
1054.24s:  This is pretty simple. I got into trading in 2007, because it was 2007. It's actually because I
1060.48s:  got introduced to investing by that teacher that I was just introducing you to. And I was looking
1066.32s:  for a way to make money. Like most people I grew up, I literally did grow up poor. So that's why.
1072.08s:  And when it came to the like, how did I start learning? I had the opposite problem that I think
1080.16s:  most people have today where for me, it was not information overload. It was kind of the
1086.64s:  inverse because the internet was still pretty new and it wasn't as anywhere near as robust as it is.
1094.08s:  So I was essentially restricted to what I could find in the library. Like that's pretty much it.
1099.20s:  So that's how I started learning in the beginning is going through stuff that I could find in the
1104.64s:  library. Then as the internet started absolutely compounding and expanding, I leveraged as much
1111.92s:  online learning as I possibly could. Vladimir says, I'm assuming that your account grew over time
1121.12s:  from regular cash deposits, from outsides from outside earnings as well as growing your OG
1126.32s:  pot of cash, the overwhelming majority of my starting capital and my early trading account came
1133.60s:  from saving the overwhelming majority. And that's something I continually try to remind people of.
1140.08s:  And this is something that I will happily take this as an opportunity to talk to you about. So
1147.76s:  back to the website. And I'm getting better at this example. So it should be a little bit quicker
1154.48s:  than some of my previous renditions. I'm like, starting to nail this example down.
1159.36s:  The main thing I want to show you is just where compound interest takes over.
1163.60s:  So when we look at like an initial balance with no contributions over a set time frame with a
1168.96s:  rate of return. Again, you guys have seen different elements of this before. But in this case,
1174.16s:  at $5,000, 10% for 20 years, you have 33 grand. If you add literally $100 per month, you would have
1181.36s:  102 grand. This is the point in the beginning, saving is non-negotiable. In the beginning, saving is
1189.20s:  what gets you to your desired point sooner rather than later. Now let's change this. Now let's do
1196.08s:  $500,000. If you have $500,000, 20 years, 10% return per year. Again, this is saying we've gone
1204.64s:  from small account to now we're growing our account. And we have a larger account. Now you'll notice
1209.68s:  that you have $3.36 million. If you saved $100 more per month, you go to $4.32. So this is still
1219.92s:  that that's still a lot of money, right? No, no doubt. Going from $3.36 to $3.43,
1225.44s:  that's a non-negotiable amount of money just for $100 a month. However, the percent difference
1230.96s:  here is trivial. This is very small now on a comparative basis. Whereas before when I showed you
1235.92s:  with this $5,000 account, I'm literally tripling the account plus. That's not the case when you
1242.72s:  have a $500,000 account. You get an extra, what, 60 grand, something like that. It's a not
1250.16s:  insignificant amount of money, but it's not a ton. What matters as your account grows,
1255.36s:  now let's take a look if you get a 1% return better over the same time frame. You would go from $3.36
1263.20s:  to $4.03. That now matters because we've just added about $700,000 nearly a million dollars
1272.40s:  by just getting a 1% better return. So going back to off-putons, kind of not so much a question,
1279.68s:  but inference, which is completely accurate. In the beginning, saving is your path. It is the path
1287.68s:  to actually grow money very quickly. Then there comes a distinct point where it switches.
1296.08s:  Where now your additional savings add a much smaller incremental amount that is much more trivial
1303.12s:  in the broad scheme of things as compared to having a better rate of return. This now is getting
1311.20s:  1% better return than the 10% is now light years more important to you than saving the $100
1319.36s:  a month or whatever. So yeah, to off-putons initial question, I absolutely, I slaved in my early 20s,
1329.92s:  probably until like 24 when I had to slow down and start focusing on like my military career more.
1336.00s:  I did everything I possibly could to make more money all the time. It was always top of mind to me.
1343.44s:  I was unbelievably disciplined with what I would spend. And one of the biggest things I always
1350.96s:  would go back and remind myself is that's why I built this calculator. I had it in an Excel sheet,
1356.40s:  so it didn't look quite this visual. But I would constantly remind myself that like
1363.52s:  when the rugby team was going out for drinks and to go hang out, I would always go.
1367.76s:  But I would go on Thursdays when it was nickel beers. I could do that. But when they wanted to go out
1373.84s:  to like anything nicer than that, I would go hang out, but I wouldn't get anything.
1379.44s:  And it's because I wanted to hang out with the people. I wanted to have fun. I still wanted to enjoy.
1384.00s:  But I also knew that I was making a short term sacrifice for a hopefully not long term gain.
1393.28s:  That's the whole point. Is the stronger you delay gratification early on, the less you have to
1400.24s:  delay gratification in mass. If I delay gratification massively early on and focus on building this account
1408.32s:  to as much as I humanly can, the earlier I get to enjoy it, it's literally how I became a millionaire
1415.12s:  before I was 30 in a multi-millionaire in my early 30s. Once you start getting over those
1420.56s:  thresholds, it starts to compound pretty quickly. And again, I'm, well, I would say I'm healthy.
1426.72s:  I have a fucked up disc. So there goes that idea. But the broader point is that if you can get to
1433.92s:  a good spot early on, then the overall delayed gratification actually isn't as delayed as when I
1442.00s:  look at most of my peers. The vast majority of my friends haven't even bought a house yet,
1446.64s:  or they're just buying their first house, which I'm very happy for them for. But they're getting
1450.32s:  into like their first starter house. And that's just not where we're at, fortunately. We're kind of
1455.84s:  at a different spot in our lives. Like in my neighborhood, I am, we are 30 years younger at the
1463.36s:  least compared to all of our neighbors. So we're in just in a very fortunate spot at our age.
1471.52s:  So yeah, for Mr. Off Putin, absolutely. The beginning is all about saving. What I want to
1479.28s:  summarize this whole thing is no matter what you do, no matter what you do, this $5,000 account is not
1487.12s:  going to be your future wealth. It's not going to happen. Even if you get a 50% return for 20 years,
1492.72s:  you have $16.6 million, that's your future wealth. What's the probability of you getting a 50% return
1499.76s:  on your $5,000 account? It's essentially fucking no. It's essentially fucking no.
1508.08s:  The vast majority of traders will not beat the stock market. So then if you think about the
1514.32s:  continuum of beating the stock market, I beat the stock market typically. And I have a good return.
1520.80s:  It's actually much better than this. I still have an update of that. But it's still, again,
1525.28s:  this isn't 50%, right? He's not even close because here's the other reality that's important for
1530.48s:  people to understand that the incremental changes that you walk into after this is really fucking hard.
1539.20s:  So I argue that if you can paste the market slightly outperform and then inch your way past that,
1548.08s:  it's a pretty good way to create repeatable success over time. However, once you start getting into
1554.96s:  higher return thresholds, it's really difficult to move the needle incrementally further. So for
1561.52s:  example, for me, going from a 15% average return to 20, genuinely was not that life changing.
1568.96s:  It was not that difficult. It obviously took a lot of effort in context, but it was quite doable.
1575.84s:  I can summarize that as whereas now I'm in like the mid 20% returns. If I wanted to grow to like a
1582.64s:  30% compound annual growth rate, that's really, really hard. That's really, really hard. It's doable,
1589.92s:  but really, really hard. So there comes like a natural cap on return potential. So then if we look
1596.48s:  at something like this and we say, okay, well, what if you're a rock star and you're able to return
1600.56s:  25% per year for 20 years on your $5,000. Six story, bro, you have $433,000 pre-tax.
1609.44s:  That's not your future wealth. Now again, if you would save just $100 more, you literally double it.
1617.44s:  You go to 845. And if you become a slightly better saver, then all of a sudden this becomes
1623.76s:  much more powerful. So this goes all the way back to the beginning point that I want to reinforce.
1630.16s:  In the beginning, saving is the entire, entire goal, the entire goal.
1639.12s:  Then as you build your skill sets, then we worry about that 1% return variance and getting slightly
1647.28s:  incrementally better as we continue to trade. But one of the worst mistakes we all make,
1653.12s:  which is actually one of the questions I'm probably going to pop up in here. One of the worst
1656.56s:  mistakes we all make is trying to start with a $5,000 account. And we are so focused on trying to
1662.72s:  get this really crazy return, not understanding that even the ability to hit that return for one
1669.20s:  year, two years, five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 fucking years, still doesn't get you there.
1679.04s:  It's the wrong focus. In the beginning, there is no substitute for savings period. That's all there
1685.60s:  is to it end of story. So I'm really glad that you brought that up off Putin because that's
1690.24s:  absolutely huge. That Lauren says, how much did you start with? What was your first big trade?
1697.20s:  It was definitely 5,000 or less. I don't remember it was 5,000 or 3,500 when I actually started
1702.48s:  trading because I opened up an account and I started investing for a few months before. So I don't
1708.24s:  know which of those it was. I want to say it was about a $5,000 account. And when you say that
1714.56s:  Lauren, when you say for first big trade, what do you mean? Like the first big position size I
1718.88s:  put on or like the first big win that I had? Because I also have to be honest, as I'm thinking about
1724.64s:  that, I don't remember either outright. I remember my biggest loss. That one is visceral. I remember
1730.24s:  that plane is day, but like the first actual big winning trade, I don't remember. I remember
1741.20s:  my biggest winning trade, which the reason why I remember is because it was last year. So that one
1745.52s:  is very top of mind for me. But yeah, I don't remember the like the first big winning trade.
1753.28s:  The biggest loss for me as a percentage of the portfolio happened after I had been trading for
1758.32s:  a few years. So I had already been trading probably for five or six years. And I was trading good,
1766.56s:  all right. And in the rut, I was trading a really wide iron condor, a massively wide iron condor.
1778.56s:  And it was a short-term trade. It was like a one week trade. And I was trying to make 500 in
1783.76s:  something bucks. It was like less than 600 bucks. I want to say it was like 560 or 580. It wasn't
1788.08s:  that much. Super wide iron condor. And I was just like, it had such a high probability of winning.
1793.68s:  So I went into this thinking just let the probabilities play out, right? Super high probability trade.
1801.92s:  And sure as shit, it had a big move that breached one side. And I remember distinctly, I was pulling
1808.64s:  up to the gym to go work out with a buddy. And I looked at my phone, I got an alert and I saw
1815.68s:  the trade and I saw it was going really bad. And this was like a day into the trade. Maybe a
1820.72s:  couple days. I don't remember how long it was mid week. And I put the trade on earlier in the week.
1826.08s:  And then I walked into the gym. I looked at the phone again and I saw it and I saw that things were
1832.16s:  still going really bad. So I like sat for a minute. I decided to close the trade. I realized the loss
1840.88s:  and it was over a 30% drawdown on the account. And I just kind of sat there for a second.
1847.12s:  And then I went and did my workout with my buddy. And that was the largest drawdown I've ever had
1854.80s:  on the account since never anything even close to that, especially on one trade, not even not
1860.80s:  even close. But yeah, that was a really formative experience for me. That's when I I decide like I
1869.92s:  took some time to like really think about it. And I decided to start taking it really seriously
1874.96s:  from there. Because I thought I was doing a smart thing. I thought I was picking some sort of
1879.68s:  really high probability trade. And the biggest mistake I made in that was focusing so much on what
1887.44s:  I wanted to win and what I thought I was going to win that I spent exactly zero time thinking about
1894.08s:  what the path of the return could look like and how I would react during the path of the return.
1900.64s:  My favorite part about the story is that if I had just held the trade, it would have been a
1908.64s:  complete winner. It landed right in the range. It would have been a complete winner. And I actually
1914.56s:  was never upset about that. I always just thought that that was like a funny, a funny part of the
1918.96s:  story that it would have been a complete winner. But I still think going like looking back at it now
1925.76s:  in that context, I would make that same choice every time where I make the hard choice. I realize
1931.68s:  the loss. And then I reconstitute and figure out what I'm going to do because here's the here's
1939.12s:  the funny part. I look at that year. What year was that? That year was in those 2011. So I started
1948.00s:  trading in 2007 that happened in 2011. And it was a two week trade. Sorry, I thought it was a one
1956.32s:  week trade. It was a two week trade. And that year I still landed up 13.99%. That trade literally
1968.08s:  transformed what I did. So I think that trade had a really profound impact on the way that I
1976.00s:  thought about this stuff. So yeah, definitely remember that losing trade without a doubt.
1982.08s:  LPBBO say Zacharias says research time versus earning capital time. How do we contribute to each?
1990.48s:  That is a fantastic question. I think that you create time for both of them. Like they, if you
1998.48s:  want to be really efficient about growing your money, we can't work unilaterally. We have to work
2005.28s:  in conjunction in tandem with multiple things. So in terms of research, you can set a specific
2010.56s:  amount of time each day that you want to dedicate to researcher each week. And then the same thing
2015.28s:  for expanding your income. And I think both of those just have to be really well thought out,
2021.92s:  right? Because if you're at a really high earning job or a job with really high earnings potential,
2026.96s:  rather than bothering and go getting a side hustle, you might be better off grinding it out at work,
2031.92s:  getting a promotion, fighting for yourself, arguing for mid-year raises because nobody else does it.
2037.60s:  And they're a thing you can get those. You just have to advocate for yourself and have the right
2043.52s:  results to back up your worth to the company. But I think spending time on that in like a high
2049.52s:  earning job, that's the best place you could spend the time. Because the incremental gain of picking
2054.16s:  up a side hustle is probably not much. For me, it was the opposite. Well, I was in college. I did
2059.52s:  side hustles. That's all I did. And when I was in when I was in something like the Marine Corps,
2068.80s:  there's no time for like, well, there's nothing I can do in the Marine Corps to advocate for myself
2074.72s:  to get promoted faster and get paid more. It's a standardized pay scale. So in those instances,
2079.36s:  I had to absolutely start looking at other things. So that's one of the ways I got into flipping
2084.80s:  motorcycles. That was I made a lot of money flipping motorcycles. And same thing with like cars,
2090.56s:  I've told you guys a million times, like, yes, I have nice cars now, but I've always been a car guy.
2095.76s:  That's why I got a Corvette and I started building it because I like cars. It's why I have
2099.28s:  them a Clarence. I like cars. It's not because I think that they're like what the finance guru's
2104.00s:  supposed to do. I kind of suck at the finance guru's supposed to do thing. I just happened to like cars.
2110.16s:  But that's a big way that I got into cars is I applied a skill set that I learned as a kid,
2115.28s:  which was fixing my mom's car because we didn't have money to go take it to a mechanic. My brother
2121.20s:  and I had to become mechanics. And then I just continued to apply the skill set. So I did that
2127.76s:  literally all through college. Yeah, I think that that was a really important
2135.60s:  process for me actually. And I think understanding your current scenario and identifying what makes
2143.44s:  the most sense for you. So again, I would take a good hard look at where you're at in your professional
2155.92s:  career. If you can make an incremental investment in order to make a larger impact on
2164.88s:  what you're trying to do in terms of your ability to promote, then that makes sense to me.
2170.64s:  If you're in a career where that's not really looking good, you're already pouring it in,
2174.64s:  whatever it's not happening. And again, the most important part there is you have to advocate
2179.44s:  for yourself. You absolutely have to advocate for yourself. But beyond that, I think
2187.92s:  picking one of those two paths to expand your income is first. And then taking the time to build a
2197.20s:  fundamental understanding of trading would be done in tandem. I would focus more on earning more
2202.24s:  money in the beginning because in the beginning, again, we all try to move so fast with respect to
2207.52s:  how much we're going to learn. And it's honestly a waste of time and effort in my opinion. Like,
2211.68s:  it doesn't actually matter quite that much in the beginning. I think that you'd be much better off
2219.92s:  increasing your overall starting principle and then going from there. Mixed as I love my
2225.84s:  Ducati. Yeah, I love them. That was actually one of my favorite bikes. I had multiple monster 1200
2231.12s:  S's. That was always my favorite. I had the pantogollies. I like those. They were cool. They're not my
2236.88s:  favorite sport bike. I much prefer the R1. But yeah, the Ducati's are beautiful. I really liked
2243.76s:  the monsters. I've probably had like 10 or 12 of those now. Big, big fan. So yeah, that's how I
2251.36s:  think about like earning versus learning Zachariah. Zachariah then also says, ever listen to Dave
2261.36s:  Ramsey? No, literally never. I've never listened to any of his material. I've seen some of his like,
2266.64s:  YouTube shorts will pop up once in a while. But he seems to deal from my understanding. He seems
2271.52s:  to deal with more like general finance stuff, like basics of budgeting and debt and stuff like that,
2277.68s:  which is not that's not my bag. So not really.
2285.04s:  Joey says, do your neighbors think you deal drugs? Yeah, it's actually funny. One of the most,
2289.60s:  here's a funny story for you, Joey, when this is a hilarious story. When we were walking around
2295.92s:  the house that we live in now, we were at an open house. And you know, it's my wife and I,
2301.52s:  and we're just kind of cruising around looking at the place. And I swear to you, there was this woman
2307.20s:  with her husband. And they had a kid that they were holding. And then I guess it was the woman's
2314.56s:  parents that were also walking around with them. And I was coming out of this room right here,
2320.56s:  the office that I'm in right now. And I was walking out. And the the older lady, I guess she was
2328.16s:  the grandma, the mother of the couple. She literally looks at me and she goes, so who are you guys looking
2334.08s:  for? It's just my wife and I here. I was just like, yo, for us, bitch. But I thought the way
2347.60s:  that she said that was so epically funny. She was like, so who are you looking for? And I was
2355.52s:  just like, what the fuck do you think I'm here for? Like it's just me and her. If like, what does
2362.88s:  this even mean? I thought that she was so funny. And the absolute best part about that interaction
2373.76s:  is after I said, I'm looking for us, she didn't say anything. She just turned and walked into the
2385.92s:  bedroom because we were going back out to the living room. She didn't say anything. She didn't say
2393.36s:  like, even, oh, interesting. Oh, cool. Oh, good for you. Oh, okay. Fucking nothing.
2401.28s:  Absolutely nothing. I can I just, oh, my God, I was dying so hard. I couldn't stop laughing at
2412.40s:  that interaction. The fact that she just straight up said nothing, dog. So funny. But yeah, I don't
2423.28s:  know if they think that we are drug dealers, but because most of my neighbors know like what I do
2429.68s:  and what Mel does because Mel also is a high earner. But we yeah, her and I we complement each
2436.72s:  others like return profiles really, really well. Wigglywarm says doesn't one beat the market by
2447.28s:  becoming the house and selling options? No, definitely not. Negatron goes writer. That is not the way.
2452.72s:  Apollo says a Japanese trader pulled off 100% returns for several years. Now that's an outlier.
2459.76s:  But potentially again, even I don't know that the Japanese trader and I don't know like what the
2465.20s:  background is behind them. But the most important part of the game for that is keeping the money.
2474.16s:  Because I had a video and I'll link to it here because I think it's an important video. It's
2478.64s:  about risk management. There are tons of traders that I've seen. He go. This one.
2492.24s:  There are tons of traders that have made tons of money. But the name of the game is to keep it.
2503.36s:  So yeah, that Japanese trader or the Singaporean trader might have done really well, but the whole idea is
2508.64s:  how well did you keep it? Zacharias says people underestimate the ability of a V.A. loan.
2514.80s:  Sort of. You have to have the money to back it up. The V.A. loan just grants you access to something.
2520.72s:  But because like we had to put money down on the house anyways. So yeah, it's not like we did like a
2525.84s:  zero money down V.A. loan for the were in a not cheap house. It's over seven figures. So yeah,
2533.76s:  the V.A. loan is very powerful, but you have to have the finances to back it up.
2538.56s:  Otherwise, they're not going to give you a V.A. loan. It makes no sense for them. They take all
2541.76s:  that risk. So yeah. So yeah, Wigglyworm, happy to dive more into that, but no. The way that
2553.44s:  a person beats the market is not by becoming the house and selling. There's elements to that that
2558.56s:  are useful, but I think that's the exactly wrong conclusion to land with.
2564.72s:  Off-putin says it takes 400K per year gross on average to live the American dream in 24.
2573.20s:  Yeah, I think it depends on the concept of a American dream, right? That's everybody will have
2577.60s:  their own version of the dream. I'll tell you right now, like 400 per year is decent, but it
2582.88s:  depends on what somebody cares and values. Roryntady says, okay, so you save at what point in
2589.60s:  your saving do you start trading? I think you start trading immediately, literally immediately.
2595.36s:  I think the way to think about trading is that I would start paper trading right away,
2603.68s:  because you stand nothing to lose. And if you again, it's working in tandem,
2609.28s:  it's coming up with a proof of concept for yourself that then you can continue to leverage.
2616.48s:  So this video, which is like one of my worst viewed videos so far this year, but I think it's
2622.48s:  really important anyways. That's why I made it. That video talks about how to use paper trading
2629.76s:  to completely leverage, just expand what you're doing. Wigglyworm says, man, it all comes back
2636.72s:  to the paper trading video. That's it, dog. Always back to paper trading, because I think
2644.88s:  if I were to do this in the most efficient way I possibly could, I would save money,
2652.16s:  I would find ways to make more money. I would learn about trading, I would paper trade while I'm
2657.52s:  learning about trading. Then when I have a decent track record of successful paper trading,
2664.00s:  then I would start live trading. That's exactly the way that I would do it. But the tricky part is,
2674.24s:  again, like most people, myself included, like I'm not innocent with this, but most people myself
2682.88s:  included think that we're just going to somehow strike it, strike it rich, make a bunch of money
2688.56s:  with very little effort, very little experience. It's so unbelievably naive, but most of us think like
2695.28s:  that. That is exactly what I would do. I truly believe that's the most efficient path you can take
2704.24s:  to sort out and quickly move through that for sure.
2713.28s:  Joey says, when you feel you're ready to start sizing up your trades, well, I size them up too
2717.12s:  early. So I think after I went through that loss, I just came up with way more strict risk control
2727.44s:  parameters and would get stopped out a lot. But I set very, very clearly to find limits to what I
2733.28s:  would let myself put up for sure. Roy and Titty says, you have a back to the future card, DeLorean,
2744.80s:  no, I wish. DeLorean, those are very cool. But I don't think I would actually want one that's
2750.96s:  not my car, but I think they're very beautiful. I like them a lot. LPB says, do the shoddy's melt for
2756.64s:  the McLaren. That's actually funny, especially out here in Southern California, because I run a
2761.04s:  car club. There's a pretty cool car culture. And the McLaren definitely seems to draw more
2769.92s:  more of the females that are they just like the paint, the look of the car, it looks expensive.
2777.28s:  I think that's probably the superficial way that they'll look at it. And then the Corvette actually
2782.56s:  gets a generally equal amount of attention, which is kind of funny, because well, it's because
2787.52s:  it's totally built. But I'd never really expect women to feel any type of way about it. I always get
2793.12s:  a kick out of that though. Like when dudes think if they get a cool car that like women somehow
2798.16s:  are gonna melt over it, it's like it's the dumbest thing. The overwhelming majority of people that
2804.00s:  are interested in cars are fucking dudes. So it's like, yeah, if you want to find a bunch of dudes
2810.08s:  and talk with dudes about cars, then for sure, that's the place to do it, because that is the
2816.64s:  overwhelming majority of people you're going to talk to. The main thing I get is when like there
2823.36s:  will be girls at the car meets that want to take a picture with the car, which I'm always,
2827.68s:  always cool with. But I have actually a funny story about that because most girls that
2833.92s:  ask to take pictures of the car, they're really respectful. So they'll say like, is it okay if I
2838.48s:  lean on the car or can I do this? And then more often than not, I'll tell them don't touch my
2844.72s:  fucking car. But sometimes like if it's like a little kid or something of course, like I've put
2849.28s:  little kids on the fucking hood, like they get special treatment. But yeah, if you're like a 20-year-old
2854.56s:  chick like fuck you. But the funny part was is there was a girl that didn't ask and she like went
2861.52s:  to like lean back and it was this was on the Corvette. And I was literally, I literally, I was just,
2869.12s:  I didn't skip a beat. I was like, get the fuck off my car. You fucking crazy. And you can tell that
2874.80s:  she was blown away that somebody would talk to her like that. It's actually quite funny because
2883.92s:  to me, you have to be in such, you have to be in such a spot in your brain that you think you
2889.60s:  could do something like that. And then to not like to never have somebody like reprimand you,
2897.28s:  that was absolutely hilarious. Big, big fan. So yeah, they different people definitely like them
2906.64s:  though. That's for sure. Mick D says Eric, what are your opinions on Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs and the
2913.28s:  new options on Bitcoin? I like options on Bitcoin ETFs. Those are very, very tradable.
2919.36s:  With respect to Bitcoin ETFs, I don't care about them. Right now, I hold the cryptocurrency itself.
2925.76s:  And it's not a big part of my overall book. I literally, it was actually funny. I was on the
2930.16s:  phone with a buddy the other day and Bitcoin came up. Literally, the only time I check it is when
2935.36s:  it in this context, like I literally was just going to go check it because I never think about it.
2940.00s:  And I forgot how to log in for a second. I was just like, shit, this is a problem because there's
2945.52s:  no, there ain't no extra way to get in there. But yeah, so I'll hold the cryptocurrency itself,
2951.52s:  but I don't really care about holding the ETFs. There's not a need for that for me.
2955.68s:  But the options on them that's completely completely different. So yeah, I think for sure,
2963.68s:  Bitcoin is cool. Bitcoin ETFs are cool. However, I think they have to fit in well with what you're
2971.60s:  doing. And a Bitcoin ETF, if there's a way, I don't know, if there's one that's structured well,
2976.40s:  I would be interested. But yeah, I haven't seen much of that.
2982.00s:  Speedrunner says, Rims, he got rich selling multi-level marketing garbage. He doesn't like talking
2988.96s:  about that because he's the big Christian. I did not know that he was in multi-level marketing.
2993.44s:  But I mean, yeah, people gotta do what they gotta do.
2998.64s:  Wigglyworm says I can throw a vertical spread at the wall and make money to compound earnings.
3004.48s:  No, that's not how that works. Olli Poppins says, keep getting ads, man, sorry about that.
3010.48s:  I literally have it turned off, but I do not control YouTube, unfortunately. So yeah, I literally have
3019.20s:  this literally turned off on my end. So
3023.68s:  Rowan City says YouTube is changing ads, Olli. It's YouTube. Oh, okay, God, thank you,
3028.64s:  Rowan City. I was literally going to ask about that because yeah, I literally have this shit turned off.
3031.52s:  I think I'm almost caught up.
3042.80s:  G36 says, man, I wish I was into this shit when I was 18. That's the cheat code.
3047.52s:  The earlier you can start, that's where it's literally magic. That's literally where all
3055.04s:  the magic starts because this, this, if you're 17, isn't that long. If you're 17, it's not that long.
3065.52s:  And if you get good at this stuff while you're doing this, then all of a sudden this becomes a
3071.44s:  very viable roadmap. Now, if you're in your early 20s, you just have to get better here at your
3078.08s:  contributions. Here's what I find with most of my peers, people that are my age, I'm 33. I find that
3084.16s:  most people that are my age seem to feel like they deserve a certain lifestyle. And I think that
3090.32s:  kind of entitlement is a mental disease that will keep most of them fucking poor or at least stock
3098.00s:  in their current threshold because the worst thing people do, and I've already given you this
3102.48s:  example before, the worst thing people do is as they make more money, they incrementally grow their
3108.08s:  lifestyle. And what they don't realize is that incremental lifestyle growth is trivial. It doesn't
3113.36s:  really matter, but if you just maintain your existing lifestyle as your income rose, then you
3118.88s:  can save more. And then what ends up happening is as you decide to fill your lifestyle, your earnings
3125.60s:  potential grows exponentially. And then you can fund a really cool lifestyle at a relatively young
3132.08s:  age. It's the same thing I've talked to you guys about even with like the toys that I bought,
3136.00s:  right? Like the cars, I bought all those in cash because there's, I don't have to take out loans
3140.56s:  for them. I think, well, I think auto loans are terrible. But if you delay gratification a
3147.36s:  little bit early on hardcore, then it's less of a delayed gratification path in its entirety.
3154.96s:  So yeah, I think G36 you're on it. And that's the thing also G36 is everything you guys can do
3161.76s:  to talk to other people about this. I think that it is absolutely critical to share this
3169.92s:  information with people because it's fucking life changing. It literally is life changing.
3175.28s:  It's why I'm doing this session. I much, I don't know, I don't mind talking about like my path
3180.08s:  and my background, but I really don't like it being about me. That's kind of the military side of
3184.40s:  me, especially the marine officer side of me. Like if you look at my little notebook, there's
3188.40s:  a thing that we always write, which is marine officers eat last. Right? It's not about you. It's about
3192.96s:  the dudes. It's about other stuff. But I think in this context, the ability for other people to talk
3199.60s:  about and to share this kind of information with people is literally life changing. So I'm glad
3205.60s:  G36 that you're identifying that. And then the next question though is make sure you share it with
3212.16s:  people because that's really, really where it's super powerful. Like super powerful.
3219.52s:  I'd rather be skiing say I like to say I don't beat the market. I learn how to be consistently
3225.68s:  profitable. I think that depends on the goal because to me, I think the idea of trading is to
3233.68s:  beat the market. Otherwise, I would just take the beta risk because there's really no other reason not to.
3242.16s:  Yeah.
3242.48s:  Yeah.
3252.08s:  Bow loses. I'm just curious what's your MBTI personality type?
3258.48s:  The fuck is MBTI? Myers-Breg-Thompton? What the fuck is MBTI? MBTI test.
3268.88s:  What is this?
3273.44s:  Could I take this?
3276.80s:  Am I supposed to take this? Where do I take this? I'll take the test. Where do I take it though?
3291.92s:  Where's the Myers-Bregs you took it at some point?
3296.72s:  I remember I took a Deloitte version of it because Deloitte, they have their own little fancy version for it.
3306.96s:  Is this the right one? I'll take it right now. Does this look correct?
3314.80s:  MBTI test.
3321.76s:  From 16 personalities?
3328.88s:  Where do I take it through truity? Which one of these do I take it through?
3336.32s:  Does 16 personalities? That sounds like somebody with really bad schizophrenia. Where this one?
3342.64s:  Okay.
3345.28s:  Choose this phrase that describes you best. Very organized. Very logical.
3351.68s:  Ooh, that depends. Typically speak up. Don't care about attention. I always care about that.
3364.08s:  That way.
3364.80s:  Hence.
3370.80s:  Hence.
3373.60s:  More that. Probably more that way. More that.
3380.40s:  Always that.
3382.96s:  Mostly that.
3385.68s:  Always that.
3386.88s:  Accurate.
3391.28s:  Medium.
3393.60s:  Accurate.
3396.40s:  Very much.
3399.60s:  Definitely. Definitely not.
3403.36s:  Always.
3405.60s:  Not so much.
3408.24s:  I think about why people do always
3410.96s:  have to do with their own abilities.
3414.16s:  Adding with new acquaintances.
3418.16s:  Yeah. Always. This is actually this is one of the funniest things.
3422.16s:  Whenever I like I literally have designated places for everything and it always cracks me up because sometimes Mel will try to
3430.16s:  like she puts I don't know I literally don't understand how it works but she just like puts shit down into like fucking evaporates. I don't understand how it works.
3440.56s:  That is never been.
3444.16s:  I don't know. It's so bizarre to me. Even down to like what I'm going to wear.
3456.16s:  I essentially lay out what I'm going to wear the night before.
3460.16s:  So this is like literally always. I enjoy being there for people when they're feeling sad.
3468.80s:  Now I'd rather go with the flow than have a set schedule. This depends.
3474.48s:  Philosophical. Yes. Large party in my honor. Fuck no.
3479.12s:  Very attentive to deadlines.
3480.88s:  Helpful to people I hope so. Bigger picture. Yes. Easy to talk to people. Yes.
3485.84s:  I believe in the importance of art.
3489.68s:  Medium.
3492.48s:  Please others.
3493.84s:  Fuck others.
3496.00s:  Personal problem. Sure.
3498.24s:  I'd like mysteries universe. Yes. Yes. Yes.
3502.72s:  A thrill sometimes. Probably that.
3506.32s:  Sensitive to the feelings of others. Sort of.
3509.12s:  Scientific theories. Yes. Yes.
3512.24s:  Make new friends. Kind of.
3516.88s:  I like to have a detailed plan before. Sometimes people tell me I'm too quiet. I've never heard that in my life.
3522.88s:  I would prefer to come up with the original solution to a problem. Sometimes.
3527.84s:  Being around lots of people energizes me does not.
3531.28s:  I have trouble sticking to a routine.
3534.40s:  Clearly inaccurate.
3536.00s:  Service to others. Yes.
3538.80s:  Examinate myself in my life. Yes.
3541.60s:  How long do you make new friends? No. Private person generally.
3545.12s:  That I care about their feelings. Probably not.
3548.72s:  Full of new ideas. Sort of.
3551.92s:  Yo, this is way longer than I thought.
3556.00s:  It's been time. Choose the phrase that describes you best.
3559.76s:  Oh, fuck. Both of those.
3563.84s:  Real life. I don't even know what this means.
3570.00s:  This.
3572.72s:  Don't know what this means.
3575.36s:  Both.
3577.20s:  Both.
3581.04s:  Active bustling. Oh, this would be terrible.
3583.68s:  That by step.
3586.24s:  Figure out things as I go.
3588.96s:  I like to finish all my chores before I do something fun every single time.
3592.16s:  Question why things why they are typically. Almost always.
3595.92s:  Care out my plans. Yes.
3598.72s:  Minimize emotion. Yes. Lose my belongings at psychotic.
3602.16s:  Follow traditions. Maybe.
3604.72s:  I let other people know what I think. Sort of. Don't care about conflict.
3609.12s:  I have trouble controlling impulses. Do not.
3612.56s:  Yeah. I'm terribly with terrible with music.
3616.40s:  Needed. No, I don't like being.
3619.20s:  You like being alone.
3621.52s:  I forgive moderately easily. Do you like new hobbies?
3625.04s:  Very active. When my back's not fucked up.
3628.88s:  I try my absolute best to be objective.
3632.16s:  I have a rich fantasy life. I don't know what the fuck that means.
3636.56s:  I like to do things as they read on the past.
3639.28s:  I avoid arguing when I disagree completely.
3641.60s:  Get rid of that. I have a lot of fun. Always.
3646.64s:  I resist temptations all the time.
3649.12s:  I succeed.
3650.48s:  Three time alone.
3652.16s:  Yeah, typically alone or with my wife.
3655.92s:  One of the coolest things about hanging out with my wife, I think, is we're both really good.
3660.24s:  Like we can be around each other.
3662.16s:  But we don't have to constantly engage.
3664.88s:  So like, I actually really enjoyed just being in the same room and just chilling.
3674.88s:  Punished for mistakes depends on the mistake.
3677.28s:  Speaking of experiences all the time on the go.
3680.64s:  Yes, yes, yes, no.
3686.72s:  Medium.
3688.64s:  Dislike. I don't care.
3691.52s:  Always. Yes.
3694.72s:  Care.
3696.56s:  Rarely. Yes.
3698.72s:  Need support. No. Love museums.
3702.08s:  Avoid noisy crowds. Yes.
3708.40s:  Funny enough for me, I actually think it's easier to do this.
3714.48s:  Yeah.
3716.40s:  Ballard by disorder. None or really care.
3718.48s:  Yes. No.
3721.28s:  No.
3723.04s:  Don't care.
3725.04s:  No. Yes.
3728.48s:  Yes. Yes.
3731.04s:  Don't care.
3733.04s:  Very much.
3735.04s:  Generally.
3737.04s:  Do not.
3739.04s:  Don't care. Don't care.
3740.64s:  Don't make me uncomfortable.
3742.64s:  I'm not.
3743.84s:  I'm not.
3744.64s:  I'm not.
3745.84s:  Don't care.
3747.44s:  Don't make me uncomfortable.
3748.64s:  I don't care.
3754.48s:  All right.
3755.92s:  What am I?
3757.44s:  Any guesses?
3758.88s:  Elizabeth says my guess is ESTJ.
3765.44s:  I am ENTJ.
3768.00s:  What is the ENTJ?
3769.68s:  What am I?
3771.04s:  Very skeptical.
3772.00s:  That's spot on.
3773.60s:  That is.
3774.48s:  I am highly skeptical.
3775.76s:  That is completely true.
3777.60s:  Super curious, very true.
3779.60s:  Dominant doesn't surprise me.
3781.12s:  Driven doesn't surprise me.
3782.96s:  Innovative sort of
3786.64s:  analytical objective.
3788.24s:  Yep.
3789.68s:  Assertive, chicken charge, organizing people.
3791.68s:  Yes. Yes.
3792.72s:  Blunt and prone to certainty.
3794.32s:  Yep.
3795.68s:  Yes.
3796.96s:  Yeah. This is actually, it's actually kind of nuts to be honest.
3799.76s:  Like how accurate a lot of this stuff is.
3802.24s:  Because I literally completely grew with this.
3804.32s:  I think that this makes a lot of sense.
3807.92s:  The gaining power in influence part,
3809.92s:  I don't actually identify with that,
3811.44s:  but like the vast majority of it.
3813.84s:  I think is absolutely solid.
3815.76s:  Cool.
3816.16s:  Well, forgot who asked that question,
3818.24s:  but now we know the answer to that myself included.
3821.36s:  All right.
3821.68s:  Let's get back to these.
3822.56s:  Okay.
3832.32s:  Okay.
3832.48s:  So there's a conversation about
3835.12s:  hypocrisy and Christianity.
3836.80s:  That's kind of fun.
3838.80s:  Speedrunner says, I'd buy a 2024 Corvette.
3841.60s:  If any of you get rich,
3842.48s:  avoid the Dodge Viper unless you're a pro.
3845.20s:  Don't say that.
3846.24s:  Dodge Viper is fine.
3849.04s:  Wigglyworm says, at least,
3850.00s:  if that is the cheap car.
3852.00s:  Yeah.
3852.32s:  The vet is that, well,
3853.68s:  funny enough, after the work,
3855.04s:  it's definitely not like with the amount of time
3857.84s:  and parts that I've put in it to build it.
3859.68s:  It's definitely definitely not.
3862.24s:  But yeah.
3866.64s:  Okay.
3866.88s:  Cool.
3868.64s:  So now,
3871.52s:  Samoji says, I'm going to watch dishes play a tornado warning tone.
3875.20s:  I don't know how to do that.
3877.28s:  I don't have that.
3878.88s:  It has to be a do shit that I can't do.
3880.96s:  All right.
3881.44s:  Let's get on to the next.
3884.08s:  How did the 08 financial crisis shape your perspective on risk
3886.80s:  and market volatility?
3888.64s:  I didn't really know what I was looking at.
3890.32s:  So this one, I don't actually think
3893.04s:  had a massive impact because it was so early on my trading career.
3897.92s:  I don't think that,
3902.24s:  yeah, I don't think I fully understood and had it soak in.
3905.04s:  It was just like a weird year.
3906.48s:  I didn't have a lot of risk out.
3908.72s:  Speedrunner says, you tap the gas just a little too hard
3911.04s:  and you're going into the wall.
3913.04s:  I can tell that you've never driven a Dodge Viper
3915.44s:  because it's actually not the case at all.
3917.44s:  That's one of the most common misconceptions I continue to hear
3923.60s:  about the Viper.
3925.12s:  If you look at the Viper, take a look at the Laguna,
3927.60s:  the Laguna Seka track times.
3929.60s:  And if you look at the Viper ACR,
3931.36s:  it's one of literally the best handling cars that exists.
3934.56s:  So yeah, that's
3936.80s:  that ain't it.
3937.60s:  It's completely wrong.
3939.20s:  The thing that people probably don't understand about
3943.44s:  something like a Viper specifically is like
3946.24s:  understanding how to apply power through a corner
3949.44s:  in order to maintain slash gain traction.
3951.76s:  That's probably a bigger issue that people will have with it.
3955.12s:  But yeah, they literally handle actually exceedingly well.
3958.56s:  Even the old school ones, I've driven 1994,
3961.92s:  or was it a 96, GTS?
3964.32s:  And that was way better behaved than I would have expected.
3968.00s:  And they definitely, like, if you're a completely lay driver,
3973.84s:  trying to drive it aggressively,
3975.84s:  then yeah, that would probably be slightly problematic.
3980.24s:  But if you're reasonably understanding of a car,
3983.36s:  then it's not that bad.
3986.24s:  You'd wonder, says, my neighbor had one.
3987.84s:  He always warned me, never let me drive it.
3990.48s:  That's just because he didn't want you driving his car.
3992.56s:  There's no reason not to let somebody drive your fucking car.
3997.12s:  Yeah.
3999.20s:  Triple in says, what's the insurance on those cars?
4001.68s:  I actually don't know.
4003.20s:  I literally don't know what I pay for insurance.
4004.96s:  I have it all bundled together.
4006.96s:  So like, my insurance, I paid every six months.
4010.40s:  And it's several thousand dollars.
4012.64s:  But that's for all my shit, like the house, all the cars and stuff.
4016.48s:  So I don't know what it is per car, unfortunately.
4020.00s:  So yeah, that's the O8 crisis.
4024.00s:  Let's move on to the next.
4026.32s:  What mistakes did you make early on that had the biggest impact
4028.80s:  on your trading strategy today?
4032.32s:  That's a good question.
4036.88s:  I think not prioritizing enough the performance of a system.
4043.76s:  So in the beginning, I was like really, really, really
4048.00s:  willing to modify and to change what I was doing to try to salvage individual trades.
4054.80s:  And I didn't fully respect how much how useless that was.
4058.88s:  Because if we think about it for something like a long-term path as a trader,
4065.60s:  it's your ability to reliably deploy at a specific level for an extended duration.
4072.88s:  So it's like, if even if I break all the rules and I do everything I can,
4076.32s:  and I have one good successful trade, that's okay.
4079.36s:  But the problem with that is it doesn't, it's not replicable into the same degree.
4084.80s:  So then when I come into a similar circumstance in the future,
4087.92s:  I'm actually not in a good spot to manage it.
4090.16s:  That's actually highly problematic.
4094.24s:  And I think that's one of the most common mistakes new traders make is focusing on
4098.88s:  individual trades too much and not the process or the system of trades.
4103.60s:  That's what I would say.
4107.20s:  Mick D says, how long did it take for you to adjust to bear markets and downturns?
4111.44s:  Yeah, that's a really great question.
4113.36s:  And how did you adjust your trading?
4114.96s:  That's a fantastic question.
4116.56s:  Because I think that question is so important because as a trader,
4120.80s:  if you can't trade directionally well, both directions,
4125.36s:  you're missing a lot of opportunities.
4126.96s:  Now a lot of traders can do very well trading one direction.
4129.68s:  It's a thing.
4130.56s:  The problem is that in that context, if that's your approach,
4134.80s:  you run into some problems.
4136.64s:  So say, for example, we look at SPX and we go back to five years.
4143.44s:  If you can only trade one direction,
4145.68s:  when the S&P 500 is fumbling like it did in 2022 here,
4151.28s:  a lot of people struggled a lot trying to trade this.
4155.52s:  And if you're not able to pivot effectively,
4158.48s:  this essentially completely puts you at a disadvantage period.
4162.88s:  So the way that I try to think about it is I think
4170.16s:  when trying to trade direction is to remap the way that we look around markets.
4176.16s:  Most of us think of markets like going to the store, right?
4181.20s:  By low, sell high, that whole thing.
4184.40s:  But there's actually a lot of things
4188.08s:  that start to make more sense when you get rid of that mindset.
4194.00s:  And you think way more just about direction.
4197.52s:  And you'll hear me say it all the time,
4199.84s:  I try to reinforce some of these really important points, at least for me.
4204.64s:  And one of those points in this context is that
4208.40s:  my job isn't to want anything from the market or think the market should do something.
4213.04s:  My job is to do my absolute best to see what the market is doing
4217.28s:  and see how I can get on with it. That's what I think about.
4220.88s:  So when I think about bear markets, I understand the tendencies for bear markets.
4226.88s:  I have entire data sets that break out the performance
4230.16s:  and different ways for me to flag when we're coming into a bear market,
4233.92s:  different topping things that I look for.
4236.40s:  So it essentially allows me to reposition so that then I can trade to the downside.
4241.28s:  And it's also why I pick the strategies that I do.
4244.24s:  Because it's really not a big list of strategies.
4246.64s:  I continue to remind you of this because I don't think that you have to have this massive stable
4253.68s:  of strategies. So when we look at something like
4258.00s:  directional, these are essentially the way I'm going to trade directionally to the downside.
4262.08s:  And it's three things. Ratio put diagonal short calls or long puts. That's pretty much it,
4267.68s:  almost always. So yeah, I think more so of trying to identify trade movement
4277.68s:  and or market movement and then figuring out a way to structure trades around it.
4283.84s:  I think way less about applying a normal mindset to markets where we're just trying to buy low sell high.
4290.80s:  I think the sooner you can break out of that, the like the light years better off you're going to be.
4295.76s:  So it's a really, really good question, Mick. It takes a little bit of time,
4299.28s:  but it's like anything else genuinely. Like if you go back and you pay per trade back to
4304.72s:  paper trading and you pay per trade, these kinds of markets, you have a lot of really good ideas.
4310.08s:  Because there are going to be tendencies that you'll identify in down markets versus up markets.
4315.28s:  One of the biggest ones and you've heard it before. And it's absolutely true. That markets tend
4320.72s:  to take the elevator down and the stairs up. So what that means is when I'm trading markets to
4325.20s:  the downside, I'm thinking more so about velocity. How can I trade things that move quickly?
4331.52s:  That's really important to me. So I think that's probably one of the biggest ways that I started
4336.40s:  pivoting is I reshaped my thought about trading, meaning dumping the idea of just trying to
4344.48s:  trade things as they're going up and adopting the idea of trying to trade direction as it is.
4349.12s:  Then I just used the simplest strategies that I could to take advantage of those movements.
4355.68s:  So let me know if that answers your question, Mick.
4359.12s:  Sam says, how do you go about choosing your stop loss? It's another great question.
4362.72s:  It's not a set rule. So there's some general parameters that I tend to apply to things.
4369.52s:  And actually in that video that I posted earlier goes into it. I'll throw it in here again about
4375.12s:  risk management for options traders. But essentially the cliff notes version of it is I actually
4382.72s:  look more so at what makes sense for an opportunity. And we can look at some examples. So let's say that
4388.96s:  I'm trading, well, I can find something I'm trading right now so that we have a live example.
4395.04s:  I'm just going into my trade log. You see if I can find something that's
4399.68s:  sucking wind. No, that's going well. That's going well.
4404.80s:  Is this okay? This might, nope, I'm out of there already. This might be a good one. And yeah,
4409.92s:  so we can look at gold.
4415.36s:  So with something like this, this trade is going well so far. But right now I'm just long gold
4420.64s:  futures and I have no options against them. Now the way that I set up this trade is I essentially
4427.44s:  look in this case, I look for a breakout and I'm trying to trade the breakout. So as it's
4432.56s:  breaking out, I need to decide where do I think near term, and this is, let me take a giant step back,
4439.36s:  sorry, the way that I think about my portfolio is there's two buckets core allocation speculative
4444.80s:  allocation. This would be a speculative allocation. This is me taking a shot. This is me thinking
4450.64s:  I have some idea about what may or may not happen and I'm trying to quantify and then ideally
4457.36s:  monetize that idea. It's not something like my core allocation where I'm really trying to take
4461.60s:  advantage of core concepts like long term positive drift and equities and stuff like that.
4467.04s:  Okay, so in something like this, I'm going to start by thinking first about the portfolio level.
4472.48s:  What's a reasonable amount of risk to have on in a trade? We'll use a $100,000 portfolio.
4478.40s:  So you can start by determining what is the maximum amount of dollars you would be comfortable
4485.20s:  losing on any one individual trade. That's the starting point. So if I have $100,000,
4493.20s:  if I want to make it simple, I can do a $1,000 loss, I can do a $10,000 loss, which is kind of big.
4499.68s:  I can do a $5,000 loss, I can do $2,500 loss. You have to pick what's right for you and what aligns
4505.44s:  with your approach. Because for me, I have a lot of trades on at a given point in time. So I can't
4512.32s:  have a really big maximum loss. So say, for example, in that $100,000 portfolio, it's not uncommon
4519.92s:  for me to have anywhere from 50 to 100 trades on at a given point in time. So that already tells me
4525.44s:  that if I use something like a 10% stop, I'm so like I'm toast if there's some sort of really bad
4532.96s:  that is a really, really bad structure for that style. Now it's completely inverse. Let's say that
4540.72s:  I'm only trading five names or 10 names at a time. Now in order to get enough risk on for the
4547.04s:  portfolio to make sense, then maybe 10% actually starts to make sense. Again, I would argue that
4551.76s:  might be a little high, but it's reasonable. It's not outside the realm of possibility for that
4555.52s:  to make sense in that scenario. So it'll be entirely entirely dependent on your processes
4562.56s:  of trader and what you're trading. For me, I tend to find 5% or less is okay. And it's because
4570.00s:  there's a lot of uncorrelated returns and I will go over 5%, but it's not always 5%. So for example,
4577.44s:  let's use this example. If we have this trade and let's say we started trading it on this breakout
4584.56s:  right here, well, then I say, okay, well, where's near term resistance? I see near term
4588.16s:  resistance here, just judging off of the volume profile. I see nothing and then I see near term
4592.08s:  resistance down here and right below it. So maybe that's where I would want to put a stop.
4596.64s:  So more around 25, 23, something like that. And this would speculate in entry around 26, 15.
4604.16s:  So now if we take a look at the active futures and we look at a model trade, I'm in my pass through
4610.56s:  account. And we look at what the loss would be at 25, 23. If we go to analyze, we go to 25, 23,
4619.84s:  we can see that's a $15,000 loss. Wait too big for a $100,000 account for this kind of
4625.36s:  opportunity. Okay. So then what does that mean? Well, it means that I can go into a smaller product
4631.60s:  like MGC, same thing. I was trading this earlier and let's use that same scenario. So let's say,
4639.52s:  it'll be the same pricing. So 25, 23 I said, I think before, right there. And again,
4646.96s:  it's presuming an entry at 26, 15 or so. So let's take a look at this. Let's take a look at
4655.12s:  this, this, this. Now I have to adjust the price. 26, 15 I think I said was the entry.
4663.20s:  Something like that. Yeah, it's like 26, 15 for an entry using 25, 23 for the exit. So then
4674.32s:  down here, I can add another price slice. I can show 25, 23. And I can say, what's my loss there?
4683.28s:  It's 920 bucks on one mini. So then I say, okay, well, I'm actually okay losing 5% on the account
4691.04s:  on this one trade. So then that tells me I can lose up to 5 grand if we're using a $100,000 account.
4695.84s:  So now I can literally size this up until I get close to that number. So here I can put on 5 of those
4703.52s:  where if I look at 5 and I get stopped out at that level, then it's a $4,600 loss that falls
4711.04s:  within risk tolerance. Okay. So now it's sized about right now. I just need to look at probabilities.
4716.56s:  Right. So like, what's the probability? And again, this is using slightly hindsight. This is
4721.12s:  pretending that the entry was here. Because that's actually when I did enter. But it's now up here.
4726.56s:  So the probabilities will be different. So I'm not going to go through that exercise. But what I
4730.16s:  would do is at this point, I would check the probabilities of where I'm entering. What's the
4735.52s:  probability of me coming down here versus the probability of me having some sort of up move?
4740.88s:  If there's no reference, I create my own reference. So when I say no reference, I normally will go
4746.08s:  back as far as I can, right, to come up with an idea. But gold is hitting highs. So I don't have
4751.60s:  some sort of other reference. So actually what I like to do is look at prior moves before pauses.
4757.92s:  So like, for example, if I look at this move here, it went from 2420 and then it got up here
4766.24s:  and it closed at 2552. So 2420 to 2552. So about what 130 point move or something.
4774.32s:  So then I can use that as a reference. I can say, okay, I have no reference where I think this might
4778.96s:  go. But maybe I'll just use that previous model move and I'll say that it'll move 130 points or so.
4784.32s:  Okay. So then that takes me to 2750 or so. So now we're literally very close to that. That will
4789.92s:  become the planning factor. And then I calculate my expected return. That's the exact process.
4796.72s:  So for Sam, let me know if that answers your question.
4804.48s:  Roryntiti says, define max loss per trade or per day or doesn't matter per trade. I don't
4809.12s:  care about per day. Per day doesn't really matter. Any sort of time frame doesn't matter. So the way
4815.12s:  that I think about, and again, it's in that video up above. But the way that I think about defining
4819.68s:  risk is I have two risk defining functions. I have risk that's defined at the portfolio level
4826.08s:  called circuit breakers. And then I have risk that's defined at each individual trade level.
4831.76s:  So for me at this point, if I have like a 15% drawdown on the total portfolio, that's triggering a
4837.20s:  circuit breaker where I'm going to go in and I'm just going to start hacking and slashing stuff.
4841.44s:  Because it's telling me something's gone wrong. I don't know what, but something's definitely
4845.68s:  gone wrong. And I need to try to figure out what it is. So then that's exactly why I go through
4850.96s:  that process. So yeah, I think at the trade level, I just make sure each individual trade is
4858.64s:  sized logically for the size of the account. That's my approach there.
4867.36s:  Off-boons says so many big moves happen extended hours when options aren't trading. How to react
4871.92s:  to a bad overnight surprise. They don't actually happen that much. So one, I think it's important to
4877.76s:  understand the product that you're trading and the friction of the not the friction,
4888.88s:  understanding the product that you're trading and the frequency that it has different kinds of moves.
4894.64s:  Vladimir off-boons says SMCI happened. Yeah, I'm not saying that they don't happen. Again,
4898.72s:  people do this all the time. When I say something like it doesn't happen often,
4904.48s:  that does not equal. It doesn't happen. What I would return to you is that what happened in SMCI
4912.56s:  is rare. That's not very frequent. Now that goes back to sizing. And if you had a trade on an SMCI
4920.32s:  or something that you know is prone to move a bit, because like none of these gaps are bad,
4926.72s:  it's had some gaps. But none of these are like break your portfolio size gaps. Like the biggest
4934.88s:  gap that I see here over the last six months is what? This right here. So this closed at 547
4946.16s:  and opened at 485. What is that? 547 to 485. 547 to 485 to 11% move.
4960.00s:  Like I'm not saying that that's small. That's a big move. It's a big overnight move. But that's not
4964.96s:  like break your portfolio size big, especially if you're sized well. So yeah, I mean in my opinion,
4972.56s:  I think the the boogie man of overnight moves is really, really overdone by people.
4978.72s:  And they don't actually understand the math behind it and like the severity of it.
4984.88s:  But it does happen. Like you can have these big gaps. Like if you're fading SMCI here and you get
4989.84s:  ran over. But again, here's the other thing that you have to keep in mind is understanding the
4995.52s:  individual security that you're trading. If I look at the average five day range, I see 10.5%
5002.08s:  and then for a 20 day range, I see seven and a quarter. So this is daily range. If I added true
5008.88s:  range, which I can add right now really quick, it'll give me context right out of the gate about
5014.16s:  what may or may not make sense. So this is five and 20. Let's see what this shows me.
5023.04s:  I'm going to get rid of this. It's for the same time frames. So that's why I don't care.
5033.04s:  But I can use ATR to show me obviously the full range, including the reason why I was the same
5038.80s:  as because there is none of those gaps in that window. But yeah, so actually let's do this really
5045.36s:  quick. I'll add the ATR. And then I'll change this so that rather than five and 20, we'll do just
5057.60s:  like 30 years. Vladimir Alpun says 10% for the underlining translates to a much bigger move for
5065.20s:  the options. Yeah, dog. Fucking welcome to options. Do not again, don't understand the point.
5071.68s:  If the points that options have leverage, then I completely agree with you options absolutely
5078.88s:  have leverage. Let's do like a five day ATR and then let's do like a 90 day ATR.
5085.60s:  And then I need to change that label just for a context.
5101.60s:  Yo, this thing is so slow. I think I have like too many indicators and things scripts open,
5109.04s:  so it always freezes up. This is going to be 90 days now.
5116.48s:  And then I'll slide this next to the other one for context. Make it nuclear yellow.
5127.28s:  And then drop that up there.
5133.12s:  Bingo. So I can see as I look at this, I'm like, okay, the average range that I see here is again,
5143.84s:  for the day, I'm seeing pretty significant moves. And then this is plotting the high and the lows
5150.72s:  that it hit over those periods in case you're wondering. But
5157.68s:  Alpun says the question is how to counter that big move size the trade well. So let's literally
5162.96s:  look at the example. So let's look at SMCI. We'll go back in time. And then we'll see. Like,
5167.76s:  let's go through the sizing process. What did we do? We looked at this one here. Is that correct?
5172.88s:  Or was it, which one would we look at? Remember, I think we did this one. So let's go back to 27
5180.88s:  aug. And let's look at it together. So it's a really good question. But I think your fears will be
5188.48s:  abated. We have to go back up to 2024. And I said, what is it August 27th?
5197.84s:  Something like that. And in this case, we know we get ran over to the downside. So the first
5208.16s:  thing, straight from the jump, I'm not trading this bullish. Right. I'm not trying to trade this to
5216.96s:  the upside. That's all there is to it. However, let's just say for the sake of the examples so
5224.56s:  that we could put the trade on together, that we were feeling really silly and chose to do that.
5232.88s:  But reinforcing that it's literally a straight up terrible idea. There's no reason to be bullish
5239.76s:  in this right here. You can see essentially what it looks like. So now the first thing I see
5246.16s:  is analyzing the ranges, the five day average daily range, six and a half percent. And then I see
5254.00s:  seven point nine seven percent. And then average true range. I see six point nine and 10 point eight
5263.84s:  percent. So this is giving me a bit of a heads up right from the jump. I got to open the door real quick.
5278.80s:  I need time. I do that. That's because Thor is either looking to enter or exit the office. In
5283.36s:  this case, it was an exit. So now here we go 10.8 percent average true range. So the first thing
5293.92s:  that I see here is that I'm looking at something that's actually quite gappy. Right. And again,
5299.36s:  this is objective. I can see it. So when I think about how I'm going to set my risk control metrics,
5307.36s:  that's going to matter a lot. Again, there's no way looking at this that I would go long, but I have
5313.36s:  to play along with the scenario. So the next thing I do is I try to find where I see potential support
5319.28s:  and resistance. I look at this handle here, right. So where we're trading right now, I'm reluctantly
5326.80s:  going to I'm reluctantly going to make a bullish trade. And I'm going to say I would have to expect
5335.28s:  us to retrace down to this. So maybe my thought process is once it gets down to this 495
5342.08s:  handle, maybe I think it's going to rally and bounce up and on Eric or Eric. I just saw
5347.68s:  Ryan Osay Eric, hope you had a great week. Thank you so much. I did have a good week. I got some
5351.44s:  shots in my back yesterday, which is very fun. But I have to keep reiterating there's no chance.
5358.32s:  I would put this trade on literally no chance because the first thing I would do is wait and see
5362.96s:  how it consolidates around this level. Okay, that aside, I think I've made that disclaimer
5369.28s:  loud and clear. Where do I see it going after that? Here's here's what I see again from an objective
5375.76s:  analysis standpoint. You saw me do this on other tickers. This isn't overfitting for a back test.
5380.88s:  This is me saying where do I see support at the next level? The next volume node I see is here
5387.44s:  at 425 and that's a weak volume node, but it is a volume node. I wouldn't want to take it all the
5395.04s:  way down here to the point of control. It's way too big of a move. So then that becomes my next
5400.24s:  area that I might expect to get stopped out. Okay, so now let's say that I again am fucking crazy
5408.00s:  and want to buy options. I wouldn't want to do this. But if I did, I would come in here and I would
5413.92s:  say I want to buy calls that are probably like a 70 delta, something like that. I will get into
5421.84s:  these calls for 120 bucks. Now what I need to do is analyze what I think my risk again, we're
5435.28s:  using a proverbial $100,000 account. Roy and Titi says why not buy puts. Roy, T, come on girl,
5442.56s:  you know what we're doing? We're trying to analyze this scenario of getting ran over with options.
5448.16s:  So if I buy puts, it would help me in this scenario. We know it gaps down. So yeah, that would be
5454.32s:  much more close to what I would choose to do. But yeah, that's why we wouldn't buy puts is because
5461.76s:  off-poon's kind of question, which is a fair question, is how do we do, like how do we deal with
5469.28s:  down moves? And I'm kind of working through this step by step gaps because the first thing I'm
5474.16s:  showing is how I find the different levels that I'm going to factor or trade around. So again, in this
5479.92s:  case, I look at the fact that over the last 90 days, the average true range is about 11%. So I have
5488.56s:  to be thinking of about an 11% move. Then I can see what kind of range that price that places price
5497.84s:  movement out, which is about 60 points. Ish. So now I'm saying, where do I think it might go to
5504.96s:  and where's my planning factor? So my planning factor for the downside if I'm wrong on these long
5510.64s:  calls would be about 42.55. That's where I see the next area of support, again, which is going out
5518.72s:  a year and pinning off of this volume node. And it's not a discrete number. It's like something
5524.56s:  pretty close. It just happens to be 45 and a half. Okay. So now I have to see at that handle,
5530.64s:  what would the loss be at 425 55, which is way over here, it would be about in eight grand
5540.16s:  loss. So if I'm trading a $100,000 account for me personally, this would be a pass because it's
5549.20s:  already too big for what I'm trying to put on. Now I have a couple choices. I could come back in,
5556.56s:  again, to try to force fit the scenario. I can look at maybe the 80 DTE come into something that's
5562.88s:  like a 70 and see if I can size this so that it makes sense. Get rid of that. And then I can look
5573.04s:  at that 425 handle and it's a great yeah. So for me, I literally would be, it would be, I would be
5579.04s:  priced out of the trade. But since we're here, let's just take a look at the example. So the first
5585.04s:  warning sign is being bullish on something going down, stupid. The second warning sign is my,
5593.12s:  the way that I fit trades literally naturally keeps me out of this trade. If I blow past both of
5602.64s:  those bright warning signs and choose to put the trade on anyways, let's see what this looks like.
5608.64s:  So using that 425 handle, I would expect to have my loss capped at about eight grand. Now I know
5617.84s:  definitively my risk is controlled at $11,000. I cannot lose more than $11,000 because I'm buying a
5626.48s:  so that's already the case. My max risk as defined is done. I've already sized this at max size
5637.84s:  and again, I know I can't lose more than that. But for the planning factor for the example,
5644.00s:  I'm thinking, okay, I want to go off of, I gotta get that out of the way. I want to go off of where
5650.00s:  I think my stop is. So I'm going to throw this in here, throw my stop in, which is going to be 42550.
5656.72s:  Right there. And that puts me at not a 16 because there's two and 8400 I'll loss. That's how much I
5663.92s:  think I'm going to lose. Okay. So now let's fast forward time. And then let's go into the morning
5669.68s:  because that's where I would be looking at this. And the gap down is to 520. That's where the gap
5680.32s:  started. So now if I go into the analyze and I see how I'm doing here at 520, which is a 5% decline,
5689.12s:  I lose 3400 bucks. That would actually be closer to the max loss I would want to take on
5699.68s:  the kind of trade. But anyways, so it's a $2,000 loss. This is extra criteria. Just exit the trade.
5707.52s:  I could wait a little bit if I wanted to see if it would eventually consolidate against this.
5712.16s:  Again, let's play the scenario out. But the first thing I'm showing you is the sizing protocols
5716.88s:  that I already did. They even with that gap, I'm okay. It's like we're doing okay here. It's not
5725.04s:  ideal, but we're not blown out and we're down a few thousand dollars. So now let's continue the
5733.20s:  scenario though. Roryntady says, do you do you cut your losses before they reach your stop?
5739.60s:  It is context dependent for sure. In this kind of case, I would realize that I'm a colossal
5746.40s:  fool for putting on a trade here. There's no chance I would have put a long trade on here.
5751.28s:  And then seeing it gap down, I would have been like, oh shit, that's right. I forgot. I wouldn't do
5757.04s:  this in the first place. So yeah, in this case, it's coming down right away. Now again, to play
5762.32s:  this scenario out from the other perspective, adopting that, let's say we're like, okay,
5767.60s:  well, I really think this 495 handle is going to be my support. So let's see how it does tracking
5773.20s:  towards that 495 handle. I'm going to fast forward two hours. We'll go to 842 and see how it does.
5779.12s:  Okay. So it touched down to it came back up. Again, if I'm playing this scenario realistically,
5785.36s:  I would have not freaked out about that. That would have been okay. And I would I would genuinely
5790.24s:  continue to let it ride here. Now realistically, again, would have been out already. But
5797.68s:  well, I would have never put the trade on. I don't know if I've mentioned that yet. I don't know
5801.12s:  if you could tell how reluctant I am with this because I think it's putting on bad trades is just so
5805.92s:  silly. But let's continue. Let's go another two hours and see what materializes.
5813.12s:  This
5817.76s:  off-poon says, I held it some C.I. calls, but the move, oh, sorry, I just realized sorry, dude,
5822.64s:  I am not trying to paint this as if like you've like you're dumb. Like I was saying I'm done
5827.52s:  in this scenario. I want to be super clear. I'm really not trying to
5832.08s:  pick on like this at all in the context of you. I'm just talking about this opportunity.
5837.76s:  I don't want you to feel like you have to defend or that this is about. It's really not.
5843.20s:  I'm just talking about the prospect of managing gaps. So is the gap the next day? Is that what's
5851.36s:  going on here? There, no, there's no gap there. Where's the gap? Line the gap. The 27th into the 28th.
5860.08s:  This doesn't show the gap. Maybe I'll do it like first thing in the morning.
5875.20s:  There we go. 456. So I have 456. It's still it's still within tolerance. It's not good,
5889.04s:  but that gap down still doesn't kill us. So the whole point here is sizing the trade.
5898.40s:  Sizing the trade entirely takes care of all of it. That's the point. So the way that we deal with gaps
5907.28s:  is by sizing the trade well. That's what it is entirely.
5918.08s:  Because even in this case where we deal with a couple gaps, we're still we still live to fight
5924.16s:  another day. It's still okay. So yeah, it's a great question. But what I find is if you look at
5930.64s:  the numbers on it a little bit and you actually become familiar with them, you'll find that people
5935.52s:  talk about the the boogie man of gaps and they're not that bad. Sometimes they are. I think somebody
5942.80s:  talked about a 33% down. Yeah, in Intel. But that's an earnings play, right? So if we go to Intel
5952.96s:  and we look at this gap again, at what point in this kind of thing, we were like, oh, I should be
5959.20s:  long Intel. Right? Like there's nothing about this that tells me I should be long Intel at all.
5967.36s:  If I look at its past earnings, gap down, gap down. Right? So again, this is one of those things
5974.72s:  that is completely, completely preventable by even the smallest monochrome of research. It's
5983.60s:  entirely preventable. There's no reason to get right over here. So yeah, earnings in and of itself
5992.00s:  are really, really tricky. But yeah, I think this shouldn't surprise anybody. Like there's nothing
6001.92s:  surprising about this. Cool. Let's keep flying through these. This next one says, looking back,
6015.28s:  what would you have done differently in your first few years of trading? Focus more on the process.
6019.76s:  I think focus, focus more on the process and focus less on trying to grow my small account into a
6025.60s:  bunch of money. I think that is hands down the biggest components. And then I'll flip through
6032.72s:  these next two. We'll do the strategy development section and then I'll pause this and then we can
6036.88s:  just talk about whatever else you guys want. This one says at what point did you realize you needed
6042.24s:  to specialize in a particular strategy or asset class and how did you choose it? I didn't do this.
6047.92s:  This is actually kind of the antithesis of how I trade. So the, I guess it's actually funny
6057.12s:  because I actually felt like I did the opposite. And I didn't specialize.
6066.40s:  I just realized I need to see if.
6069.76s:  Colonel ordered.
6076.88s:  Can you grab me?
6078.48s:  Mango orange. I gotta get a refill on my sorter water.
6087.84s:  So yeah, the way that I looked at it actually was by not honing in on a specific strategy.
6095.68s:  By picking a basket of strategies. And again, you can see the strategies that I run. I'm very,
6102.88s:  very open about all of them. There's no secrets to what I do. There are a handful of things. It's
6108.08s:  ratio diagonals, call or put, covered strangles. Ratio covered calls sometimes typically not.
6115.84s:  I would be part of this. But sometimes straddles, strangles, single options. That's literally
6124.72s:  the overwhelming. That's essentially all I do. Sometimes I'll do verticals very rarely.
6132.40s:  But yeah, I mean, the way I look at this is kind of the inverse where my job is to try to find
6139.12s:  things that are moving. Roy Titty says, what do people call, what do most people call ratio
6145.92s:  diagonals? Well, they would call it a diagonal. But most people don't do the ratio.
6154.32s:  Roy Titty says, you know, the wrong term so I can follow along with it. Oh, a poor man's covered
6160.00s:  call. I don't know if they call it a poor man's covered put. They probably would. But yeah,
6165.44s:  the the wrong term is a poor man's covered call. That's hilarious because you know, you know,
6170.48s:  I hate those. I hate those terms so much. But you make me say it, but I will do it for you.
6177.92s:  Roy Titty, you know that. But yeah, that would be a ratio call diagonal ratio put diagonal. I
6185.76s:  think stick into the right terms is the way to go. But yeah, does that make sense at least for
6190.72s:  for this question, which is like I act, I really do think the the aspect of not specializing in
6197.20s:  a specific strategy and not specifically picking like a one asset class, I want the mobility
6208.24s:  of looking around and finding things that look interesting, finding things that offer opportunities
6215.28s:  that again, I can exploit. And it's by not being like super locked in.
6220.08s:  Roy Titty says, I respect you, but why don't you buy a ton of the mango orange seltzer waters?
6224.16s:  I literally have a ton right now. I know I'm asking for a refill from my wife, so I don't
6228.48s:  have to step away, but she might be working. So I might have to go grab it. But yeah, I have I
6234.56s:  bulk by them. I have tons. I don't run out of stuff. So yeah, it's kind of like part, part
6242.96s:  and parcel. Jonathan says, did you revisit unity yet? I may have missed it. No, we haven't looked
6248.40s:  at really any individual names. We've been just talking more about fundamentals of trading and
6254.72s:  I think we talked a little bit about my personality type because that came up. I took a test. But yeah.
6263.28s:  Joey says, how about specializing in certain profit mechanisms?
6268.32s:  That didn't happen. Like I didn't even think about classifying them as profit mechanisms
6273.36s:  until like I had been trading for over a decade. Easy. Yeah, because I never even looked at this
6281.28s:  stuff before then. I had ideas about movement, but I've never gotten to like the really specific
6290.64s:  elements of profit mechanisms, the subcategories. Like I would have been a decade into trading deep
6298.32s:  before I started thinking about that. And I think that's mostly because
6309.92s:  I think it's mostly because I didn't know and like nobody taught me that.
6317.04s:  So it didn't really occur to me to think of it that way, I think. So I probably didn't
6324.16s:  think about profit mechanisms and sub mechanisms or subcategories the way that I do now.
6330.16s:  But I would say that I definitely thought about specializing in like these concepts, meaning
6338.16s:  trading directionally up and down and then trading volatility in these different manners. Like that
6343.44s:  I knew I was doing. And to do that, I did spend time trying to figure out like the qualities of
6351.44s:  movements, but I don't think I had it down to anywhere near the science that I do now. Whereas
6357.52s:  for me, I can look at a chart quickly classify the kind of movement and then I already have a massive
6363.12s:  repository of data in my mind about how this thing is more likely to move and then I can fit something
6369.60s:  to it. It definitely was not always like that. So yeah, Joey, let me know if that answers
6376.64s:  your question because I know it's a little bit of a non-answer, but it is the truth. Like in the
6382.00s:  beginning, I didn't even think about the way I think about profit mechanisms and characterizations
6387.84s:  like I do now. And especially anybody that's in like the mentoring program, when we go through
6393.04s:  different profit mechanisms, like you can tell like I literally have a fucking template essentially
6398.40s:  that we fill in about understanding in depth specific profit mechanisms. That's not something I
6405.12s:  thought of for probably the first half of my trade and career. It's something that I think I
6410.16s:  indirectly had it's like captured and started to tinker with because again, like I definitely knew
6416.08s:  about these traits, but I didn't get into the habit of fingerprinting them like I do now.
6421.68s:  And having like really, really solid understandings of the specific behaviors that's quantified.
6428.32s:  That's a big thing is I don't really rely on my ability to just look at it and see it. It's very
6432.96s:  much how can I put numbers behind this so that I can then make good probabilistic assessments.
6438.40s:  And this goes back to even the gold trade that I have on because when I first put on this gold
6444.72s:  trade, the probabilities, it was literally partially negatively expected when I entered the trade
6452.08s:  because the neutral density probabilities that it gave me were very high for me getting stopped out
6457.44s:  compared to where I thought it might go using that 130 point mover, whatever. So, but I kind of
6465.44s:  I kind of knew differently from the neutral density. I didn't take that. I took it under
6471.92s:  advisement, right? Like I understood that the probability of as it was being plotted in the way
6476.32s:  that the options markets were plotting things, but I absolutely expected there to be a bit of momentum
6482.16s:  and drift, which fortunately did materialize here. So there's a little bit of nuance there.
6490.56s:  The next question here is, wait, let me go back to your guys.
6496.00s:  Roin Titty says, did you start trading with margin? I'm resistant to trade with margin.
6501.28s:  Well, just make sure you understand the difference between with margin and on margin. I don't borrow any
6505.60s:  money. Yeah, I don't borrow any money with respect to margin. So as I'm looking at, like for example,
6515.52s:  if I went through and I wanted to buy gold, if I buy a call, I'm trading with margin, right? So like,
6526.32s:  I have access to margin. I have access to the leverage, but I'm not on margin. I'm not borrowing
6533.92s:  money for the position. So I don't think there's a reason to borrow money. The way to think about
6542.40s:  that Roin Titty is essentially margin is fine. Margin is what you naturally gain access to when you
6549.04s:  trade options. You're not borrowing. You don't owe anything. You owe money, meaning you're borrowing
6554.48s:  money and you have to pay interest. When your cash and sweep goes to zero, that's when you're now
6561.92s:  borrowing money. So I don't do that. I don't see a reason to do that. I know people are happy
6569.68s:  doing that, but it is absolutely not my not my approach at all. I don't borrow.
6577.60s:  Joey says I was thinking it's better to specialize in surf and profit mechanisms over certain
6582.00s:  strategy. Yes, a class. Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. I think when it comes to things like
6587.44s:  profit mechanisms, I think you like at least if it were me, I would be trying to focus on the
6597.52s:  highest probability stuff first and then starting to get more specific from there. So like, again,
6604.40s:  I think that I use all the time in the mentoring sessions with people is new traders will have all
6609.76s:  different kinds of numbers that they think they want to hit. Like, oh, I want a 25% return or
6614.72s:  I want an 18% return. But then as soon as we start going through the actual track record,
6620.48s:  we might be lucky if we're not negative. So it's like, we're focusing on the wrong thing to start.
6626.88s:  I think it's much easier to use some sort of benchmark as the starting point. Buy and hold.
6633.20s:  That's an easy benchmark to use that it's a 100% beta no alpha return. Okay. Then if we can
6640.56s:  optimize that buy and hold approach slightly and get a slightly better return, now we're
6645.76s:  introducing at least an element of alpha over the market. Cool. That's the very first step
6652.16s:  it takes to start beating the market. Most people want to skip past that whole process and immediately
6659.68s:  get into the idea of making 15% per year every year without fail. And it's a low probability way
6667.44s:  to go about that. So I think the idea of starting with profit mechanisms is super logical.
6674.32s:  And you don't need that many of them. So for me, you again, you can see on you can see on this,
6683.68s:  what I tend to focus on, which is about as simple as possible.
6689.44s:  So I'm looking at things like trend momentum, breakouts, breakdowns, and drift. That's
6702.56s:  directionally generally what I'm looking at. For volatility, I'm looking for risk premium,
6708.32s:  mean reversion, skew, mispricings, sometimes less so on mispricings if I'm being honest because
6714.80s:  they're kind of hard to come across, but still keep my eyes out for those. Those are really the
6721.68s:  core of the profit mechanisms that I focus on. So yeah.
6729.04s:  Make these says, can we to join them? Mentoring, just waiting to master the basics of
6732.80s:  options trading, even though I've been trading futures and forks for 15 years. Yeah, that's
6735.76s:  awesome. Literally whenever you're ready. I have people that I work with that literally are brand
6740.48s:  new and I have people, I have a couple of people that I work with that I've actually been trading
6743.76s:  longer than I have. The main thing is just for anybody that wants to do the mentoring stuff,
6749.36s:  it's like you have to know what you're trying to accomplish and then my job is to help you accomplish
6754.64s:  that. That's the way I look at it. So even if it's a beginner trying to learn options, my job for
6759.84s:  that person is to get them to learn options as efficiently as humanly possible. But I think
6767.04s:  the most important thing is having like, and I do this with most people in the beginning,
6771.92s:  which is workout like really clear objectives for what we're trying to accomplish.
6777.52s:  And I think that that's just massively important so that it is a good use of time because I always
6782.96s:  try to pack the time as much as, even just like these live streams, I try to get as much information
6788.88s:  into the smallest amount of time as possible. Zacharias says, can you define that terminology?
6794.48s:  Could you let me know what it was? Sorry. If you let me know what terminology I was using.
6802.48s:  Reese says, where do you think it'd be if you started on Robinhood? There's no chance. I would
6807.36s:  have started on Robinhood. I hate Robinhood. Any opportunity I have to talk shit and to just express
6815.52s:  my hatred for Robinhood, I'm always down for that. Robinhood is literally straight trash.
6822.80s:  Let me show you Robinhood.
6832.08s:  Let me see really quick.
6845.60s:  Here we go.
6853.12s:  You should read this study. This is one of many because Robinhood is trash.
6857.84s:  But this talks about essentially their terrible fills.
6868.80s:  So yeah, they're garbage. I hate them.
6875.60s:  Zacharias says borrowed versus mechanism.
6881.04s:  Sorry, I'm not totally following. Are you talking about profit mechanism and then give me one
6885.76s:  second. I need to go get a refill.
6915.76s:  Okay.
6922.96s:  All right.
6942.96s:  We are back at it.
6948.96s:  And Zacharias says margins.
6954.48s:  I see.
6955.48s:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6956.48s:  So let's talk about margin, because I think it's a good example.
6961.64s:  So there's a difference between trading with margin versus trading on margin.
6967.92s:  I actually think I have a video, probably an old video about this.
6973.58s:  So this video is about portfolio margin.
6978.72s:  And then I think in my options 101, I talk about margin.
6988.56s:  So here's the way to think about it.
6991.60s:  When you're trading options, you're trading with margin.
6998.96s:  So you essentially gain access to leverage.
7002.96s:  That's all it is.
7004.40s:  So let's look at an example.
7010.24s:  If I want to, let's do APLD.
7015.00s:  I saw somebody pop that in before.
7017.60s:  So if we look at APLD and we want to buy a call, this call costs us $175.
7030.40s:  If that $175, you're gaining access to $700 worth of stock.
7039.00s:  So here you are still trading with margin.
7043.24s:  The margin that's provided to you is via the leverage.
7048.28s:  So in a buying scenario, it's essentially relegated to whatever you choose to buy it
7054.04s:  for.
7055.04s:  That's going to be the margin.
7056.04s:  Now, let's say I want to instead to sell a putt.
7059.48s:  This would be a $55 putt that I get.
7064.08s:  If I analyze this, you'll see that there's a margin requirement.
7068.28s:  And again, this is a pass through.
7069.60s:  This is using an IRA pass through account.
7072.44s:  So this one is going to be cash secured.
7074.96s:  It's not regulation T.
7076.80s:  But what I'm showing you is it's showing you how much money it wants you to set aside.
7083.04s:  But you're not borrowing that money.
7085.52s:  There's no loan.
7087.40s:  There's no interest that you have to pay.
7089.68s:  This is just the amount of money that your broker is saying I want you to set this aside.
7094.36s:  That's it.
7096.00s:  Then there's trading on margin.
7100.12s:  On margin is let's say I have that $100,000 account.
7105.24s:  And let's say for whatever reason I wanted to get 10,000 of these.
7114.48s:  So in this case, I would be exceeding the overall value of the account.
7121.80s:  However, the broker would, if you're trading in a margin account, would extend you a certain
7128.28s:  amount of money that you can borrow in excess of your available resources.
7134.80s:  So when you're trading options normally, buying options, selling options, you're trading
7139.56s:  with margin, but not on margin.
7142.70s:  And you then run through all of the money in your cash and sweep.
7148.18s:  And that's zeroed out.
7150.22s:  That means you've used all of your available capital.
7153.98s:  And now the broker is lending you money to put on new trades.
7159.78s:  So the easiest way to think about it is as long as your cash and sweep is not zero, you're
7165.10s:  not borrowing money yet.
7172.54s:  So yeah, let me know if that makes sense.
7176.82s:  Rointitys says, sorry, I'm confused, you trade with the margin account, but you don't
7180.30s:  trade on margin.
7181.30s:  That's correct.
7182.30s:  That's exactly correct.
7183.30s:  So now, even once you have a certain size account, I forgot what it is.
7186.86s:  I don't know if it's 125,000 or 150,000 or whatever.
7190.38s:  But you can get what's called portfolio margin, which actually gives you even better rates
7198.38s:  in terms of if I wanted to borrow, but then also in terms of what they require and what
7203.46s:  they set aside for you.
7205.10s:  Because regulation T by its design is highly, highly, highly conservative.
7211.42s:  And if you don't want to deal with that overly conservative margin requirement, then you
7215.94s:  can use portfolio margin, which would ask for even less.
7219.90s:  So for example, in this IRA account, it won't show us.
7224.46s:  But when I tried to sell that put, the margin requirement was $700.
7228.42s:  If I had a regulation T account, if one of you guys do you guys could tell me what it
7231.90s:  would cost to sell that put, but it would be much less from that $700.
7235.74s:  It'd probably be maybe $100 and something dollars or maybe $200.
7238.98s:  I'm not sure.
7240.26s:  But then with the portfolio margin account, it would be even less than the regulation
7244.50s:  T requirement.
7245.90s:  So I can tell you exactly what it would be with the portfolio margin account.
7248.90s:  Give me one sec.
7249.90s:  I'll log in and I will tell you.
7255.46s:  And what we're looking at, APLD 21 7 put.
7259.90s:  Give me one sec.
7260.98s:  APLD.
7262.98s:  Let's take a look at the options chain.
7270.26s:  21 days.
7271.26s:  The 7 put.
7272.26s:  Come on, just tell this.
7283.26s:  So the, oh, that's actually really fascinating.
7291.42s:  So the margin requirement on, well, it's a good example.
7296.78s:  But the margin requirement, even with portfolio margin, is $645, really, really high margin.
7302.94s:  So that's an example of something that's like, oh, I see, because I'm still in the wrong
7307.34s:  account.
7308.34s:  That's my bad.
7309.34s:  Yeah.
7310.34s:  Joey says 125 bucks.
7311.34s:  Yeah.
7312.34s:  Okay.
7313.34s:  So that makes sense.
7314.34s:  Thank you, Joey.
7315.34s:  Yeah.
7316.34s:  So essentially, the margin requirement in those different accounts will be very different because
7320.26s:  of the sizing is required.
7323.66s:  Growing Titi says, and they were letting my shares, even though I opted out.
7326.38s:  So now I won't use margin account.
7329.38s:  Um, yeah.
7330.38s:  I mean, you could do that.
7331.38s:  I, I'm an options trader.
7333.18s:  So margin is just a force multiplier for me.
7335.74s:  It's something that I like.
7337.02s:  But if it's not something that you want, then yeah, there's no reason.
7342.22s:  Off Putin says, you often look at a chart of the underlying, but you ever use toss to
7346.38s:  look at the chart of individual options for me.
7349.02s:  It's a very nice tool.
7350.02s:  Not really.
7351.02s:  It doesn't matter to me.
7355.38s:  I do it really when I'm investigating stuff for if I'm conducting research with like trades,
7360.50s:  people have said that they made or whatever.
7363.02s:  But I don't really bother looking at the chart of options because the other thing is the
7368.38s:  chart of options is, is not super telling because of the way that it's reported.
7373.62s:  So yeah, I mean, it could be cool, but otherwise not so much.
7378.70s:  Okay, cool.
7382.98s:  And let me look at the next couple here and then we'll just kind of bullshit for a little
7389.30s:  bit longer and then I'll wrap up.
7392.10s:  Um, can you walk us through a strategy?
7398.34s:  That didn't work out in how you adopted it after realizing it wasn't profitable.
7402.98s:  There's one that comes straight to the front of my mind.
7406.50s:  Can any of you guess what it might be?
7411.02s:  Because this one, it just slams.
7416.82s:  Slams home.
7421.02s:  Spreads.
7422.02s:  That's exactly right.
7423.26s:  100% correct.
7425.86s:  It was spreads.
7427.38s:  So I was trading vertical spreads for years and I had decent win rates.
7433.82s:  Overall, I thought vertical spreads were like pretty solid.
7438.34s:  And then I was going back through my trading log realizing that I was, I was trading a
7446.18s:  lot.
7448.22s:  And I noticed that the biggest issue I had with spreads is I actually had a pretty good
7454.70s:  win rate.
7456.46s:  But the issue was the losing trades were too big and they would take out too many winners.
7463.18s:  And it becomes a massive, massive headache.
7468.98s:  So I found after trading them literally for several years that they looked better than
7475.46s:  they actually do.
7477.86s:  And it was misleading because I didn't know to look for it because I had been winning
7483.78s:  like pretty regularly.
7486.22s:  Like Dices, do you have a video on search mechanism to finding trades?
7489.46s:  Yeah.
7490.46s:  So that one's about like building strategy is like the basis.
7496.70s:  And then this video is about scanning for options trades.
7502.50s:  Definitely.
7503.50s:  It's a big part of the process, especially to do it very efficiently.
7511.54s:  Zacharias says an example of spreads.
7513.34s:  Sure.
7514.34s:  Let's take a look.
7516.06s:  So APLD, let's say instead of buy or let's say instead of just selling this put, we sell
7523.34s:  the put and we buy the put and we come up with a spread.
7528.70s:  Now the funny thing is that at this configuration, if I was actually able to get 35 cents, this
7534.98s:  would be a really good spread.
7536.50s:  I would do that spread.
7541.22s:  You're unlikely to get a fill here.
7543.38s:  That's why it's a 10 cent wide spread like you probably get 30 if you're lucky.
7549.14s:  So this, this is a vertical spread.
7552.06s:  So vertical spreads are super inefficient in the sense that if you're right, you stand
7559.10s:  to make very little money.
7560.90s:  They're highly efficient in that they take up very little amount of money.
7566.02s:  So if we look at the margin requirement for this trade as compared to, so if you remember,
7571.34s:  even in the IRA, if you remember selling the put by itself, we had to put up $700.
7577.18s:  Here you only have to put up 100 bucks.
7579.86s:  So it gives you a massive, massive, massive buffer.
7583.98s:  The problem is that if I am directionally correct, let's say I go through all my research,
7589.66s:  I get all my ducks on a row and everything looks good, well, I can only make 30 bucks.
7595.82s:  So that's the downside with vertical spreads, especially small vertical spreads is that
7603.82s:  you literally just can't make decent money with them because of like quite literally
7608.66s:  their very structure, which is one of the annoying parts for it in my opinion.
7615.02s:  Because otherwise, I mean, it looks really, really good, right?
7619.14s:  Because it essentially balances everything.
7627.98s:  It can be a high probability trade.
7630.46s:  It can be defined risk, which is awesome.
7636.42s:  And yeah, that's really the main problem that you're going to run into with it though,
7642.46s:  is that they don't tend to work well long term.
7647.26s:  So they're misleading.
7651.02s:  Zachary says just a little return for the labor.
7653.58s:  Well, it's not just the fact that it's a little return that definitely is part of it,
7656.74s:  but the other part of it is again, I'm risking $70 to make 30.
7662.34s:  So that's a problem because even if I'm right several times, if I'm wrong once, then
7669.98s:  I've undone several winning trades.
7673.46s:  And then you also add the issue with friction.
7676.02s:  You're going to pile up fees because there's more legs.
7679.14s:  If I want to get in, I have two legs I have to pay for.
7682.18s:  If I want to get out, I have two legs I have to pay for.
7685.38s:  Oh, and don't forget, what is it?
7687.30s:  What are the average option commissions right now?
7689.30s:  I don't even know.
7690.30s:  I'm going to ask Chachapetit.
7692.06s:  What is the average option mission?
7703.26s:  It's 50.
7704.26s:  It says between 50 and $1.
7706.26s:  So let's use 50.
7707.58s:  Let's keep it.
7708.58s:  Let's keep it mellow.
7710.14s:  So in order to put up the trade, I'm going to give up a dollar and my max profit is $30.
7717.18s:  So right out of the jump, it's a 3.3% drag right out of the jump.
7723.90s:  Just to get into the trade, 3.3% gone.
7727.46s:  30 bucks, you just give up a dollar.
7729.94s:  Now the max you can get is 29.
7731.90s:  Just before you apply any management, if you do not take it all the way to expiration,
7737.66s:  which is not smart, you have another dollar that you're going to give up.
7745.42s:  So then as you give up that other dollar, now you're literally adding over 6% drag, almost
7751.06s:  7% drag to your to your trade.
7754.58s:  And there's not that much to give up.
7757.06s:  So that's the big problem with spreads as far as I see it.
7765.06s:  How do you handle the balance between risk management and maximizing profit?
7773.66s:  Well we already talked about risk management.
7775.38s:  That's pretty easy.
7776.38s:  And then maximizing profit is also easy.
7778.30s:  It's typically following trades.
7781.34s:  So if I hit a profit target of sorts, so for example, if we go back to this gold
7786.66s:  trade, like if I hit that, you know, target that I had, I don't automatically get out.
7796.66s:  I just move my stop up incrementally.
7799.78s:  So essentially the initial stop goes there, then we start to rally up and out, second stop
7804.86s:  goes there.
7806.14s:  If it starts basing here and then goes up, then the stop goes up to here and so on and
7811.58s:  so forth.
7812.66s:  So I don't just get out.
7814.62s:  I essentially ride the movement up as far as I can.
7819.38s:  I tend to choke things a little bit, especially as they get ran up.
7823.38s:  I don't want to let it turn into a losing trade or give up too many of the profits that
7828.30s:  I've accumulated because the way that I trade is I'm always happy to get right back
7832.78s:  in.
7833.78s:  And that's a really, really, really big mental hurdle that I think a lot of traders have
7839.26s:  is the idea of like once you get out, then you're out that you have to go look for
7842.38s:  something else.
7843.38s:  So say, for example, in this trade, let's say I had a stop there and let's say that
7848.22s:  there's a big enough move below it that it convincingly moves below the stop for me.
7853.70s:  I get out.
7854.78s:  If it starts rallying back up and out, I will happily get back in.
7858.98s:  I'll get right back in.
7860.74s:  I do not care if I get stopped out on something like that.
7863.74s:  I will get right back in because to me, I don't mind that process, but that takes a long
7869.78s:  time to build if I'm being completely honest.
7873.06s:  Most of the time I think traders once they get stopped out, they feel some type of way
7876.14s:  about it.
7877.14s:  They feel like the trade's over and that they have to go look for something else.
7880.02s:  For me, I normally will set alerts when I get stopped out of something if it still looks
7884.54s:  good.
7885.54s:  If I just think that the range that it happened to catch me in was a little bit wide,
7890.14s:  which will happen sometimes.
7891.14s:  And that's okay.
7892.14s:  But there's no reason to sacrifice like a really good opportunity because that happens.
7899.30s:  Well, Rowan Titty said you have exemption on wash trades.
7902.86s:  Yeah.
7903.86s:  So if you have day trading with your account and the way that you file your taxes, you're
7911.70s:  marked to market daily.
7913.10s:  So wash sales inherently don't apply.
7916.54s:  The other thing to consider those is if that doesn't apply to you, then it's less of
7923.22s:  a tax consideration.
7924.90s:  And it's simply more of what efficiently makes sense, right?
7930.06s:  Because what I try to remind people is you only pay taxes on what you make.
7934.50s:  So while we want to be mindful for taxes without a doubt, we definitely don't, in my opinion,
7942.14s:  want to overemphasize taxes because you pay taxes on what you make.
7949.58s:  So Moda says, yeah, that trade you were down 30% on what have worked if you had set a
7953.54s:  stop and then got back in.
7956.14s:  That one probably not because it was a short premium trade.
7959.58s:  It's a little more difficult to do that with short premium trades, I think, but yeah,
7965.02s:  to your point broadly at what of?
7969.62s:  Rowan Titty says, yeah, because you can't claim it as a loss, right?
7972.22s:  Yeah.
7973.22s:  Exactly.
7974.22s:  Wash sales essentially just prevent the short term entry and exiting of same or similar
7982.26s:  products essentially to try to play taxes.
7986.14s:  But if you're again flagged as a full-time trader, then they know that that's not so much
7990.94s:  your game.
7991.94s:  And again, like there's other drawbacks to that because you're automatically going to be
7995.10s:  marked to market.
7996.62s:  So well, I think you can, I don't know, can you, you might be able to elect it or not.
8001.26s:  That part I don't remember.
8004.06s:  But yeah.
8006.06s:  Cool.
8011.70s:  And then the last one, how do you decide what strategies to try?
8015.86s:  In the beginning for me, I tried everything, literally everything.
8019.46s:  So what I started to do is realize that I needed to refine down what I was trying because
8025.02s:  a lot of stuff.
8026.86s:  It's like, again, the problem that you have as a trader is you have to strike this really
8032.82s:  important balance.
8035.14s:  And let me get rid of this and grab this so that I can draw you something that hopefully
8041.50s:  will be priceless art that moves you.
8045.54s:  But more importantly, something that might be able to explain the point.
8052.26s:  So let's say that you have a system that you're trading and let's say that this is the
8058.06s:  zero line.
8060.62s:  And let's say that this is number of like occurrences.
8067.70s:  And then this is PNL.
8068.70s:  Oh, that got stuck there.
8073.50s:  So here's the problem.
8075.78s:  If you try the strategy, let's just pick a random strategy.
8081.10s:  That sounds cool.
8082.10s:  Maybe a vertical, long vertical.
8084.74s:  Let's just do like a long, all vertical.
8091.50s:  That's your strategy.
8093.30s:  Now there's a process that has to happen in order for you to identify how effective this
8101.62s:  strategy is for you is if you put on, let's say your, whoa, that got stuck.
8109.38s:  If you put on 10 trades and then let's say that you get 50 trade and then let's see
8114.10s:  if you get 100 trade.
8116.98s:  What will happen in this first 10 trades is you'll be here maybe.
8128.06s:  So what I'm trying to highlight is that in your first 10 trades, it could look something
8134.10s:  like this that's kind of skewed to one side, right?
8138.82s:  So we can see that we have one, I didn't really count how many I put.
8142.70s:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
8144.62s:  Oh, that's good.
8145.62s:  The math worked out.
8146.62s:  So you could have seven winning trades and three losing trades, which is actually kind
8149.42s:  of funny because that's about right.
8151.18s:  So then you could be looking at this in the beginning and say, oh, wow, this looks great.
8154.54s:  I'm doing a great job.
8155.86s:  I have seven wins, three losses.
8158.02s:  Now again, you'll realize that if these are max losses, this might not actually look
8162.30s:  that good.
8163.50s:  It's even more dangerous is if instead of your sample looking like that, it looks like
8168.74s:  this.
8171.74s:  That's even more dangerous.
8178.10s:  And the reason why it's more dangerous is because you think, oh, okay, cool.
8182.78s:  Like I put on, you know, 10 trades and this is working really well.
8187.66s:  And then what's even more dangerous still is if you put on another 15 trades, I'm not
8192.06s:  counting the dots anymore, but let's just count the losers.
8195.94s:  And you're like, shit, you know, I put on another 15 trades and only if three losers,
8200.22s:  this is great.
8201.98s:  Here's the issue.
8203.34s:  You need a large enough sample size to actually show you the performance of something.
8210.66s:  This is also under the context that you're doing it the same way every time.
8218.90s:  So it means that we're using the same deltas.
8221.98s:  We're using the same entry criteria.
8226.98s:  We're using the same signals.
8230.38s:  All of this has to be done the same in order for this to mean anything because what happens
8236.06s:  after this first group and you're like, wow, you know, after this group, I'm going to
8240.94s:  try actually changing my deltas.
8243.26s:  Guess what?
8244.26s:  You need to start again at zero because you just changed some shit.
8248.82s:  Then after a little while, you're all the way up here in like your 50 trades, you get
8253.66s:  through those and you're like, oh, man, maybe I want to try this new signal for my entry.
8257.58s:  Guess what?
8258.58s:  Back to fucking zero because every time we make these little tiny tweaks to a strategy,
8264.38s:  if we want to understand how efficacious it is, we have to keep same thing same so that
8269.42s:  we can compare it.
8270.86s:  And then the problem is it takes time to understand the performance of something.
8277.90s:  It's not instant.
8279.06s:  It takes actually a really long time to get a good sample size.
8283.22s:  So by testing too many strategies, you're kind of half ass testing a bunch of stuff.
8291.62s:  That's why the way that I talk to people about this stuff is by starting with the profit
8296.78s:  mechanisms, then the signals, then the structures.
8302.46s:  Because rather than toiling, testing with all these different option strategies out there
8307.34s:  that might sound great, if we focus more on identifying profit mechanisms and fitting
8313.46s:  stuff to them, we can keep things so much simpler.
8318.66s:  So that's my sales pitch on what strategies to try.
8323.06s:  I think no matter what, a trader should try essentially everything they come across.
8327.70s:  But I would just differentiate whether you're trying stuff with real money or paper trading,
8331.58s:  I would paper trade the vast majority of it.
8333.22s:  There's no reason to throw real money at the overwhelming majority of it.
8338.10s:  So yeah, I actually really enjoyed a bunch of these questions so far.
8342.54s:  I think they're pretty cool.
8344.94s:  I will save the rest.
8346.58s:  We'll go through the rest in the next one.
8349.50s:  And then if you guys have anything else that you want to hit quick, I'm happy to do that.
8354.82s:  And then in the meantime, there's a couple adjustments.
8358.58s:  I need to start making to my little platform here because I want to actually know, I think
8365.38s:  this looks okay.
8366.38s:  Never mind, I'm good here.
8370.18s:  Joyce says, can you clarify signals here?
8372.02s:  Like candlestick patterns, T-indicators?
8374.02s:  Yeah, exactly.
8375.26s:  So when I think about signals, it's what allows me to identify the profit mechanism.
8383.94s:  So for example, a signal in this case is the moving averages.
8390.70s:  And the actual signal here is when, let's say, prices above the short-term moving average,
8398.26s:  then maybe that's my first signal of a bullish configuration.
8401.98s:  Now there's going to be typical multiple signals, but that's the first one.
8407.42s:  And then what I do is I look at the, I call it the breadth of evidence.
8411.62s:  So essentially compiling all the different signals and stuff.
8414.86s:  And then seeing what I think based on the totality of what I see in front of me.
8422.10s:  So yeah, I think, I think that's the main way I look at it personally.
8433.82s:  And then I think signals have to be tailored to the profit mechanism as well.
8441.30s:  So I think it's lazy and not useful if you try to do the same exact signals for everything
8447.98s:  that tends to not work well at all.
8450.74s:  So yeah, signals are essentially what provide some sort of entry criteria.
8456.74s:  And then it's less frequently any one signal, but more kind of all of the signals combined
8461.94s:  that I'm using.
8464.78s:  Mike says, over your trading career, how many major levels in aha moments?
8470.94s:  And were they all triggered by losing trades?
8472.62s:  No, no, no, no, definitely not all by losing trades.
8474.98s:  I definitely had that big one from that one losing trade.
8480.94s:  In terms of like big breakthrough moments, there's not a ton that jump out at me because
8491.02s:  for me, it was like a very process growth, like procedural growth roadmap.
8501.62s:  So I didn't have a lot of things where I was like doing something and then I came across
8506.02s:  something at some point, which was like light bulb moment.
8509.46s:  This is completely new to me.
8511.98s:  Now there definitely are a ton of elements of those.
8515.74s:  I'm saying like there are tons of them.
8518.10s:  But there's not many that like jump out at me as like pivotal or like changing my trading
8523.58s:  career.
8524.58s:  That losing trade was a big one.
8526.38s:  But other than that, there's not a ton of them that jump out at me.
8530.62s:  But I would say a lot of the times that I would get those bigger feelings of kind of unlocking
8536.18s:  something is probably like between the five and eight year mark.
8543.22s:  Because at that point, you're looking at stuff long enough, you're starting to identify
8546.82s:  things that are interesting for some reason or another.
8549.82s:  You're starting to see stuff and then you start getting smart enough to like understand
8554.90s:  how to analyze it and justify what you're seeing.
8559.82s:  That's really cool.
8560.82s:  That I actually like a lot.
8564.74s:  And that happens mostly during that time frame because you're at that balance where you
8570.22s:  now have enough experience that you've seen enough.
8573.14s:  You're starting to build a roll of decks of information and then you're getting to a
8577.02s:  point where you're kind of like rising to the next trading cognitive level that you
8581.42s:  can like overlook all these different things from a point of experience.
8586.22s:  And then you can see like, oh, yeah, like this clearly like now I understand the actual
8592.18s:  effect behind this.
8594.30s:  And I can like, I've seen it before.
8595.90s:  I kind of knew it was there, but now I know why it's there.
8599.26s:  It kind of builds a little bit over time.
8602.34s:  Yeah.
8603.34s:  Zacharias says, what I learned today, earn some money and eat beans and rice, invest
8607.86s:  early, learn the trade.
8609.62s:  It'll sticks.
8610.62s:  I'm still on beginner.
8611.62s:  Yeah, that's fair.
8612.62s:  I think you can even do a little bit better than beans and rice and just go to ramen.
8616.10s:  I spent a lot of time on ramen.
8618.38s:  That's for sure.
8619.38s:  But yeah, invest early, no debate and earn as much money as possible as early as possible
8625.42s:  no debate.
8626.66s:  And then Samota says, how do you decide what time frame to use for T8?
8631.62s:  Yeah, that's easy actually.
8634.06s:  So for technical analysis, the way that I frame that is it just needs to fit like what
8639.50s:  you're trading.
8640.50s:  So I have a couple videos that go through technical analysis.
8644.90s:  Here's the first one.
8647.46s:  And then here's the second one.
8651.58s:  Part one or part two.
8655.74s:  Essentially, I fit the technical analysis that I'm doing to the time frame that I'm trading.
8660.78s:  That's the way I think about it.
8662.10s:  So like, for example, if I'm trading zero DTE options and SPX, I don't care about a
8666.94s:  six month chart.
8668.34s:  If I'm trading something that I want to trade for like a month or so, two months, then
8672.34s:  I do care about the six month chart that kind of becomes like my one click up.
8676.30s:  The way I try to think about like a trading time frame is just observing the time frame
8681.06s:  I want to trade in a chart, a click up, a click down.
8684.58s:  And it's kind of relative, but a lot of my trades are about a one month thesis if that
8688.70s:  of holding time frames.
8690.34s:  So I actually use like a three month chart a lot, a lot.
8694.02s:  And then a lot of times I'll use six month chart for like the broader context of something.
8699.70s:  And I use a year more out of curiosity than anything.
8703.70s:  And then I'll use longer term time frames again, just to explore based on curiosity, not
8708.86s:  for some practical functional reason.
8711.50s:  Most of the time I'm going to use like six month, three month time frames for most
8715.54s:  of my charts.
8717.06s:  And even that can be argued that it's a little bit long.
8719.78s:  I do tend on a slightly longer time frame.
8723.86s:  Like a one month chart would make a whole lot of sense and a two month chart really would
8727.78s:  fit even better.
8729.66s:  But I kind of like these time frames.
8732.62s:  They are a little bit longer, but it gives me a little bit more context.
8739.10s:  So yeah, I think that's mostly what I use.
8744.62s:  Mick D says I agreed tonight was fun.
8746.98s:  Thanks for sharing your Friday night.
8748.02s:  Yeah, I love hanging out with you guys.
8749.34s:  You guys know that I always have a blast.
8752.74s:  Annabella says do you use other tools to analyze price and charts?
8759.86s:  You mean do I use stuff other than price and charts?
8763.46s:  Or Annabella, could you clarify your question just a little bit?
8768.30s:  To analyze price and charts.
8770.78s:  Because to analyze price and charts, I would use charts to analyze price because that's
8777.82s:  really what charts are a representation of.
8780.46s:  But I can't tell if you're asking for like a broader analysis question.
8787.50s:  Zachary says do you think technical analysis is driving the price due to the fact everyone
8791.78s:  is doing it and ignoring the outliers?
8795.10s:  No, I think supply and demand is what drives price and technical analysis or just in general
8801.50s:  is the way that we can visualize it.
8803.42s:  That's all.
8804.62s:  So we can see human traits and human qualities come through in technical analysis.
8812.14s:  The frequency for people to look at something at a specific level or stuff like that.
8817.94s:  But it's really just broad supply and demand functions that are happening and a chart
8822.74s:  that lets you visualize the supply and demand functions playing out.
8826.74s:  But you can also see a lot of human psychology in them, which is hilarious, right?
8830.62s:  Because I've told you guys about this.
8831.90s:  I was reviewing this on the pro livestream yesterday.
8835.18s:  I have a trade on in Baba and it is literally to no surprise.
8839.70s:  I actually have to move my stop up again.
8845.22s:  It is no surprise to me to see something like this move this fast.
8850.22s:  And this is about how information is being integrated into a price of something, right?
8859.66s:  And as you can tell in this case, it's obviously being integrated, not cleanly is what I would
8866.82s:  frame it as.
8868.98s:  So yeah.
8872.98s:  I think when I look at the movement of stuff like this, it's just such a great visualization
8882.06s:  about how people behave.
8888.70s:  Rointit says is it true that charts are structured off of UK cheese.
8892.14s:  I've not heard that, but that's actually funny.
8896.62s:  Mick D says that's why fibs are so effective.
8899.06s:  They're actually not.
8901.02s:  I've done a lot of studies about fibonautchies.
8904.50s:  I think what you're experiencing there is just confirmation bias.
8910.02s:  They're not completely ineffective, but like in an actual like practical sense, they're
8916.50s:  really not that effective.
8918.54s:  The most effective indicators that you'll find in general are going to be volume and moving
8926.22s:  averages.
8927.22s:  That's why I use those is like those are hands down.
8929.90s:  The most accurate reflections and predictive tools that we have available stuff like fibs
8936.18s:  and stuff like that.
8937.18s:  They like a fib doesn't mean anything, right?
8939.38s:  Like a fib is totally random.
8941.54s:  It's just using the natural sequence as something of consequence, but it doesn't actually
8948.46s:  mean a whole lot.
8949.98s:  And so like to Joey's point, Joey likes VWOPs.
8952.50s:  People use VWOPs and funny enough if you plot a moving average compared to a VWOP,
8957.30s:  they're not that far apart.
8958.90s:  So you can kind of see them in the same.
8960.90s:  That's the thing is like so many of these tools, they're so damn close to one another.
8966.06s:  There's really not a massive amount of difference between them.
8969.18s:  So yeah.
8972.74s:  Sweet.
8973.74s:  Super fun.
8974.74s:  Great.
8975.74s:  Hang in out with you guys.
8976.74s:  I'm going to hop off, go hang out with the fam for a little bit, take the pub for a
8980.88s:  walk, grab some dinner.
8982.54s:  Tomorrow we have the GME live stream.
8984.26s:  We're going to be diving into roaring kiddie's trades.
8987.46s:  I think this is part four, is that right?
8991.70s:  It is part four.
8993.22s:  So we have to keep getting into the weeds on the cat and what he's working on.
8999.46s:  As always, anything you need, let me know, hit me up.
9002.02s:  I'm around.
9003.02s:  Be an outlier.
9004.02s:  I'll see you all later.
