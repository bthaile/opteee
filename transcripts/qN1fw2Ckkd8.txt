0.00s: What's up, allies? Happy Sunday. Today we're just going to do a quick video looking out
5.12s: at the week ahead so that everybody's equipped with what's coming up, what to keep an eye
9.36s: out for because we are at an inflection point. That's what I think. I think that the markets
14.84s: right now are still very emotional in terms of the way that we're pricing and information.
21.04s: And I mean, you can see based on the chart that I have up here, this kind of movement
25.36s: is strange. And I looked back over decades to get some context because while I feel based
34.72s: on all of my subconscious processing that this looks anomalous, I also want to make sure
39.84s: that it's not just some sort of random emotional visceral reaction. So I looked it up. And
45.28s: this indeed is rare, this kind of movement. This is almost like what we saw again,
51.04s: much pare-down version. But this is almost like we saw during the COVID bear market.
56.16s: And I bring that for context because the COVID bear market was fascinating. If I zoom this in
62.16s: for you, you can see the period where we're just crashing as we're understanding the impact of
69.84s: this pandemic and yada yada yada. But the period that we actually set in a bear market was like
76.32s: three days. I think one of the shortest bear markets we've ever had at least in the last century.
82.48s: So because of these kinds of movements, it started making me curious about what's going on? Why
89.12s: is the market starting to have these kind of like really aggressive moves to the downside that's
94.80s: generally been the case? That's nothing new. You've heard the saying, I'm sure markets take the
100.24s: elevator down, but the stairs up. But in this case, it's literally taking the elevator
106.00s: down and then back up. That's look at this. That's exactly what this is. Now in this case,
110.48s: the elevator back up was brought on by a ton of economic stimulus, a lot of support from the fed.
120.56s: I don't see the support here. Obviously, the support loosely would be the rate environment and
126.08s: whatnot. But really what I'm highlighting is that very little has changed between these two
132.24s: periods other than and it's important to call out the Bank of Japan and the overall
137.76s: Japan economic system starting to chill out a little bit. I do think was part of this
143.28s: significant drop down and now the subsequent okay, that's been abated. Now we're coming back up.
148.08s: But man, like that's just a really big move to go through in such a short period of time without
154.96s: a really big catalyst. Again, I understand that Japanese economy definitely influences the US
162.72s: economy. I would argue that the US economy leads. But nonetheless, there's interplay there and not
168.40s: to overemphasize this move. This isn't a crazy move, but this is still 50 points that unwound
175.84s: over the course of two, three weeks essentially. And it really got super steep here. But then after
183.44s: again, another week and a half, two weeks, we're back up to where we were. So I bring that for
189.84s: context, not to say that this is right or wrong or that this is okay or not okay, none of that
193.84s: matters. The market's going to do whatever the market does. But my job as a trader is to do my best
200.80s: to understand what it's doing so that I can interface with it well. So that goes all the way back
206.16s: to my first comment that I think we are in an emotional market that's highly, highly sensitive
213.12s: to new information as it should be because we're at a really interesting point in our economy.
220.80s: We've gone through a series of stimulus that we've never seen before. We've made a bunch of moves
227.84s: that we've never done before from like the Fed picture. Now everybody's just sitting here thinking like
233.60s: how does this go? Where do we go from here? At first, it was like no, it's impossible for us to have
239.44s: a soft landing. Then it was looking like, wow, it looks like we're actually going to have a soft
243.28s: landing and then it switches back again to there's no way we're going to have a softlet like nobody
248.32s: knows. So in those kind of scenarios though, it tells me that I have to be really thoughtful about
255.76s: the way that I'm positioning things. So if we take a look at the sectors, there's still a lot of
264.96s: interesting divergence going on, but it's in differing degrees. So what I mean by that is the
270.32s: S&P 500 is essentially almost back at highs, where 10 points off of highs. The Q's is closing in,
277.12s: but it's still 25 points off of highs. So what I'm highlighting for you is a difference in recovery
284.00s: because if the S&P 500 is almost back, it's again, 10 points of highs. Well, Q's typically
293.52s: tech, very well representative for tech, I should say a lot of people don't realize that there's
297.44s: other companies in Q's. It's just that tech is definitely the largest portion of the index.
302.96s: So we use Q's as a proxy for tech. So in this case, if Q's is not all the way back up there yet,
310.32s: it tells me that this move in spy is not being purely driven by tech. There's other things going on
318.16s: that's causing this movement and we'll figure out what that is in a second because again,
322.00s: there's a lot of trading opportunities here and then we can see small caps. We're not even,
326.40s: we haven't even closed the drop gap yet. So these stocks are figuring out if they're going to get
331.52s: back to all time highs with the S&P 500 leading and IWM is kind of like just bouncing around down here.
337.60s: The reason why I think that's so topical is because going all the way back to this emotional
341.12s: market concept that I was talking about. Well, some people might say, well, the big catalyst for this
347.20s: is that we think that rates are going to get cut. Make sense. If we take a look at the Fed watch tool,
353.76s: the current probabilities for a rate cut are really, really high. Let me drag this over here so we
358.08s: could look together and there's still sitting essentially at 100% chance of an ease and it's been
363.60s: bouncing between whether it's going to be 25 or 50 basis points right now. It's looking more so
368.56s: like 25 again for a while. It was looking like 50 basis points and whatever. We know that again,
375.52s: come 18 September right now, the bottom market is pricing in 100% probability of a cut. Okay.
382.40s: So then what's happening here? Why is this not playing? It indicates a slightly different
389.20s: tenor because what caused this parabolic literally record breaking up move for IWM in a two-week
395.60s: basis was the same thesis. This is when we started thinking that the Fed was going to cut.
402.88s: Small caps took a run as again, I was expecting them to. But what's been interesting to me is that
410.08s: now with rate cuts even being more of a probabilistic outcome here, they're not playing. So what it
415.44s: tells me is that there are other themes now that are coming into play that are even more interesting
420.88s: than just the rate cut because of these relationships. So I wanted to share some of that with you all.
426.64s: Now the other thing I want to highlight is this down here. Take a look at VIX. This has been one of
430.40s: the biggest slam dunk trades I've had this year. And I try to remind people that fading the VIX
435.84s: or fading volatility is not comfortable because it can go through extended durations where it's
441.28s: really moving against you big. And it's not a nice position to look at. But if you understand the
448.00s: way that the products work and you have patients, I've never not seen the VIX come back down. Let's
454.32s: go back out max. So this is the entire lifespan of the VIX. It has had some massive, massive jumps
461.52s: like this right in late 87. This is one for the book soup or super interesting. Oh, nine global
468.40s: financial crisis. Oh, wait, oh, no, I should say. And then we have global pandemic. Then we have this
475.20s: giant spike not to the level of global pandemic, but also not that far off. It's like 20 points off,
481.92s: which to me they're very different events, but still again, this really emotional theme. But more so
488.00s: what I find important to highlight here is the fact that it always, always comes back down.
494.24s: So whenever I fade something like VIX, it is never, ever in the context of naked short calls or
501.44s: anything like that. It is just not worth the risk. And it's because your position will adjust over
506.72s: time. You'll have blowout in terms of your margin that becomes a giant problem. I always define the
512.00s: risk. This is a primary example of a position where I will not trade naked options specifically
519.84s: against it for those reasons. It's just structurally, it would work technically if you can withstand
525.04s: the move, but you have to withstand the move. And some of these can get pretty aggressive. So
531.12s: just again, talking about that trade because it's something I've mentioned a few times now,
535.44s: I'll probably do a standalone video on it because this one is quite anomalous. I've been fading VIX
540.16s: most of the year. We haven't seen a lot of great moves to do it on, right? Like the last great
545.20s: moves was essentially when we're breaking above 15. That's when it's been interesting thus far.
549.60s: In this case, we clustered a little bit, but this one offered a really interesting opportunity
554.00s: that I started fading into a little bit early, got ran over, but continued to scale into it because
558.56s: again, I know all this works. Now, the interesting part though is that the unwind was really quick,
563.52s: which I find again, generally interesting. All right, so let's take a look at what's coming up
569.36s: ahead. So when I look out at the week, I again, emphasize the emotional concept. Again, reason for
578.48s: that is because I think the news events that we see to me are more and more important. And there
584.08s: are things that I'm trading. I'm primarily trading with short dated options and stuff like that.
588.24s: And for the outlier pro members, the Patreon folks later today during the live stream will go
593.12s: a little further into detail on some of the things that I've been working on for these events
597.20s: because they've been providing a little bit more volatility than I've typically seen around the
601.60s: events. So a lot of my historical references for how I trade the events are changing and adapting
607.68s: to the new information that we're seeing. Beautiful part of markets. They continue to evolve.
612.96s: So this week we have on the 19th, not a whole lot. We have the leading index Fed speaker,
619.76s: nothing crazy. But what I do want to highlight is we're coming into another week where there's
624.88s: quite a few Fed speakers. So on the 19th, there's Waller, then there's Boss stitch bar. The only reason
630.72s: I bring this up is because you're going to actually see differing opinions about where we're at.
635.68s: As you typically will see when these different folks speak, which is just kind of good because
640.08s: it helps me understand the way that the Fed is looking at things. Again, I think that the bond market
644.80s: at this point is going to start forcing the hand and we started seeing the cards being shown
648.88s: there. But I still like the way I still like to see the way that they're thinking about things.
654.08s: So crude oil inventories on the 21st, the meeting minutes on the 21st, big deal. And it's because we
661.60s: get more details when we get the Fed rate statement, it's just a statement. But when we get the meeting
666.32s: minutes, we get to see what they're talking about how they're viewing the information. There's
669.76s: much more qualitative information in here. So this is one that I absolutely am going to be playing,
675.20s: but keeping a pretty close eye on. And then on the 22nd, we have a few big deal releases.
681.52s: Jobless claims, we're still very sensitive to that. And then we also have PMI, which both the composite
687.68s: services, manufacturing, all of those obviously looking at slightly different things and then all
692.00s: together. But again, any of these economic efficiencies or productivity metrics are a big deal.
697.84s: Because this is really what caused that original spike that we saw in the probability of a rate cut,
702.88s: because we were starting to see small cracks showing up. And one of the issues that you'll find with
707.84s: stuff like this is that there's leads and lags. If we're starting to see cracks now, then by the time
713.12s: we start making changes and those changes are felt, you're dealing with a really lagging system
718.40s: that can start to become pretty problematic pretty quickly. Now the Fed's preference to prefer
723.28s: over tightening and kind of holding it there long enough, I understand, because it's a lot easier
728.56s: to offer economic stimulus and some sort in a recession as compared to allow inflation to
734.08s: start running off the handle again and then trying to rein it back in. That's not easy to do.
737.44s: We haven't seen a lot of successful iterations of that historically.
741.60s: So moving through the rest of this, we don't have a ton going on the 22nd, the balance sheet.
747.68s: I don't actually think it's going to be that big of a deal. New home sales change. This hasn't been
752.48s: that much of a hitter as of late. I'm interested for two reasons because I also invest in real estate.
757.60s: And I'm also looking for some more property now. But other than that, this hasn't been as big of a deal.
763.28s: So it's one I'm keeping an eye on. But to me, really, the big stuff from this week is going to come
768.48s: out on the 22nd when we're getting into more of those economic indicators as well as the meeting
773.68s: minutes on the 21st. Those are really the big ticket items that I'm keeping eyeball on.
779.44s: Now the last thing I want to take a look at is the crowd favorite chewy and
785.04s: psych game stop. I was just looking at you. That's why it's on the mind. But
789.44s: let's take a quick look at GameStop. It has been consolidating here. So we already looked at the
794.48s: options chain. I did want to show you what fell off from the previous expiration cycle because we
800.72s: just went through op X and there's a lot of stuff that fell off. So now the new baseline that we're
806.80s: looking at for call. Oh, I is 455,971 contracts against 246,904 puts. Now one big difference compared
819.04s: to what we've seen historically. Take a look at all of these different colors. All of these different
823.52s: colors indicate different explorations. We do not see the front expiration focus that we've seen
832.16s: essentially since I've started doing this regular coverage of GameStop. What does that mean?
836.88s: I can't tell you definitively because I don't know. But one, I can tell you that this is different
842.00s: than what I've seen since I started looking at this thing. And two, I can tell you that it does mean
846.64s: obviously that there's less interest built into these expiration cycles. That's what causes
853.28s: people to flood into derivatives markets is when there's something really perceivably interesting
857.92s: going on. And we want to gain exposure to it in this case. That's not the case for this week.
863.36s: So does that mean 23 August a quiet week? Again, I have no idea. But what I can tell you is that
869.12s: the options market is not positioned for it to be a firework style week. Now the other thing that I
876.96s: keep drawing attention to because I keep finding it to be just crazy interesting is that the
882.08s: expiration cycle that contains earnings, which is this six six sep cycle because earnings right
888.40s: now is on the fourth before the market. It still is really low IV. So this is again something that I
893.84s: intend to trade. But the fact that the next expiration cycle, which isn't even a primary expiration
900.08s: cycle is just 13 sep. Or whatever reason has much higher vol which I just I can't I can't put
907.68s: heads or tails on it. I don't know why this is the case. The it's it's an anomaly like in the
913.60s: pure sense when I look at the volatility surface, the fact that those two are flipped that much.
919.12s: Like you don't normally see this much crossing over of a volatility surface. So to give you like a
926.56s: better example, if you look at something like Apple, just something that's super liquid. And if we
930.64s: take a look, this is what a normal volatility surface looks like. Notice how there's not a bunch
936.00s: of these kinks and random lines crossing over one another because this is more uniformly accepted.
942.00s: There's some alterations specifically things that will include perceived events earnings coming
947.52s: up. You'll see that where the lines cross over and really what I mean by when the lines cross over,
952.88s: this is where we're expecting different expiration cycles to have higher vol than other expiration
957.84s: cycles. And typically it just kind of ladders out very neatly like you just saw. But if you look at this,
963.84s: this is not that. This is all over the place. So there's a ton of relative value options plays.
969.76s: Like if you take a look at this line right here, it's hard to see. But there's a line right here.
975.20s: And it looks like six, except to me, that's really, really peaked out. So you can trade those relative
980.40s: value vols if you're so inclined. But yeah, this has been a really curious one for me to keep an eyeball
987.44s: on because the vol is you could tell I've been honing in on it. So it's so weird. Now where do we
994.08s: go from here? We got to see we got to see what the week looks like ahead. I'm eager. I'm hopeful
998.40s: that we start to see some volume. That's been one of the hardest parts about this is that I'm just
1003.76s: not seeing a ton of volume in the stock. I mean, it is just as suppressed as you can get.
1010.48s: One of the things that I did specifically for GM is I actually added a second moving average
1015.92s: so that I could have some better context. So I still have the 20 day volume average, which is
1020.88s: like that dark purple line. And then the light purple is a five day. They're both inverted,
1026.40s: meaning the longer is above the shorter. So obviously tells me shorter term is much lighter.
1031.68s: The five day average ball. And they're both negative sloping. So vol is still siphoning out of here.
1037.52s: So that's the biggest thing I'm waiting to see is some vol enter the picture. As always,
1043.76s: anything you want me to take a look at, I'm here for it. Let me know. Drop me a line. Throw it
1047.12s: in the comments. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
