0.00s: You know, I didn't have this one on my bingo card. I really thought today
3.80s: GameStop was gonna crack above 25. It was also very close and
9.30s: We ended up closing today at
12.20s: 24
13.74s: 97
16.30s: Close very close but not quite spend most of the day above that handle can help
21.40s: I find that slightly interesting now another interesting component to this though is the fact that we were bumping up
29.20s: against the point of control or the volume profile which is what this is here
35.90s: It just tells me where we were transacting the most within a specific time frame in this case a three-month daily
43.00s: There's a lot of people that are holding shares right now at 26 44 like somewhere around there and if we go out to six months
51.20s: It's kind of right around that same exact period 26 48-ish and then if we go out to a year
58.16s: You'll notice it's still very close to that 26 62 the reason why that matters so much is because a lot of times when you look at different time frames
67.50s: You'll actually see the point of control move around as people are buying at all different kinds of time frames
72.80s: This doesn't surprise me to see a lot of selling happening as we get up to this point of control because for a lot of people
80.36s: This is where they've been holding for a pretty prolonged period of time and
86.52s: Some people are trying to get out at a profit now whether or not the ape community is gonna handle that and
94.40s: People not holding well that's up to y'all to take a look
97.64s: I'm just telling you what I see here, which is people that are unwinding as they are getting back towards break even
104.40s: Reminds me of that gif or the meme of the dude that says it with the news around his neck and he goes first time
110.80s: I feel like most of the apes have been here so long that being down under the point of control by a dollar is
118.60s: That probably doesn't even register at this point
121.28s: But for some people especially if they have reasonable size positions that they've been holding for a year say like say even back further than this
129.84s: And then they're having an opportunity to unwind that starts to look kind of attractive depending on what your
137.88s: Disposition is as a trader and what you're trying to accomplish which
141.32s: Everybody needs to do what's right for them trading is an individual endeavor
146.36s: I would call it an individual sport, but it's so physically inactive. It doesn't feel comfortable saying that
152.76s: So let's take a look at the options chains
156.36s: What are we seeing? Well the very first thing is compared to yesterday
160.44s: volatility has now
162.12s: expanded actually quite a lot
164.76s: And I don't think that that's
167.24s: Coincidental I think that we're starting to see a
171.72s: Heavy amount of options activity
174.04s: So when I look at this today
176.52s: There was over three hundred thousand calls that transacted today and only 86,000 puts
184.20s: Very heavy call activity. This has been hovering in like the mid-to's and it's even been now below two a couple times over the last week or so
192.60s: So this is a reasonable surge in call volume and it's very much centered
199.24s: Around the 19 July and the 12 July expiration. So if I just look at those two
205.32s: 255,500 of that volume are in these front two expressions
212.84s: As you can see here
214.44s: Now we have a little bit of a lone ranger all the way up here
218.12s: And this is showing us in the 19 July the 30s there was 41,700
223.96s: Contract trades today
226.92s: And if we just take a quick look at that specific contract to get a sense of how
233.40s: Prevalent it was was there any really big sizing
236.68s: And apparently all my alerts are going off right now
240.28s: And there really weren't very many big trades realistically
244.04s: So as I look at this the biggest one I saw was the 30s now what I did do is grab
251.40s: Unusual whales which I have a link in the description for anybody that wants to sign up with a small discount
257.72s: I do get a kickback for that
259.48s: but
260.60s: The main thing is if you like the tool otherwise we can look at it together and let's take a quick look at those
267.32s: 30s
268.84s: We need to go to the strike and we want to look only at the 30s
274.12s: for 19 July
277.32s: And let's see
279.32s: Like there's some decent size trades but nothing to significant right 43,000 and 37,000
284.60s: This isn't like the transactions we've been seeing recently with a couple 200,000 plus
290.20s: Dollar trades which funny enough there was somebody in my comments that was saying like
295.24s: They were expecting like a 20 million dollar trade and
298.84s: I was sitting there thinking like how crazy is this whole story
303.32s: That that's become the expectation that it's boring until there's a 20 million plus dollar position
310.04s: And not only that but there's a single dude that does that
315.08s: And it's reality we've already seen it before
319.96s: The fact that that is part of the conversation here is so crazy to me
325.48s: And it is part of the conversation which is quite hilarious
329.88s: So that's a interesting amount of activity but yeah from here you can see it's a lot of activity for sure
337.08s: But the majority of it smaller trades but tons of them right tons and tons of five lots and lower
344.52s: So
345.88s: There's a little bit of building out
348.28s: happening there
349.88s: And then we also see quite a bit of activity in the 12 July's resuming
354.28s: So specifically at the 30s which we have seen going off for a while
358.28s: At the 26 which is relatively new and then I would assume these are the 25s which they are
362.52s: So let's take a look now at the 12s which are literally two days away
366.68s: And we see
368.68s: Overwhelming volume
371.64s: for the 26
374.04s: That's interesting
376.04s: 9,600 ohi and there's 20,636 volume today that's a ton of opening positions no matter what
384.12s: We see a bunch of opening positions here at the 26 and a half at the 27s
389.64s: We see opening positions all the way out here at the 30s
392.92s: So people very clearly are still building positions even though there are two days left to go
399.88s: Now we are coming up on a perspective start to another one of these cycles we need to explore a little bit more
406.60s: I actually have
408.36s: A another live stream scheduled with newton
411.56s: This coming Saturday at 1700 Pacific time the same exact thing we did last week
415.64s: But this time I have like two hours
417.40s: So plenty of time to dig way further in the detail
420.04s: So we'll be able to talk a little bit about what we see happen this week
423.32s: But there does look to be some positioning around that going on because
427.72s: There's two days left and there's 10,000 contracts at least
432.20s: That were open today here at the 26th handle which is really interesting same thing here at the 25 handles
436.92s: 17,500 contracts traded again 16,000 online so that's a lot of opening positions
442.20s: The other thing is we had that homey that was in at the tens. Let's see if they're still here
446.92s: All the out here at the tens
449.32s: Aha they bounced
453.48s: So wait was it the 12 July's or was it the 19 July's let me see
459.24s: No, it's this looks right it looks like the 19 July's because it looks like they're still there. I messed up
464.36s: So yeah, because there was that dude that I saw come through buying the tens which was a little different
469.00s: And it was a pretty meaningful size position
471.64s: And it looks like they're still there so I remember there was around 300 oh, I you guys can fact check me to make sure
476.28s: I'm not completely off base here, but I think that that's right
480.60s: So
482.12s: What's the deal here? Well a couple things
485.32s: One of the things I noticed is volatility is coming up here. This was really low
489.80s: This was like low ones just yesterday in the day before
493.24s: And now it's already starting to peak back up so you could tell that the more the options market knows
498.12s: When there's expiration coming shit gets weird like that's the trend the overwhelming trend
503.96s: That I've started to pick up on since I've started following this more closely and rightfully so I totally get why it does that
510.44s: When I look at most of the call transactions today 33% of them were at the offer above meaning they were buys
517.00s: And on the put side
518.84s: It looks like they were at the bitter below slight edge by three points and that means that those are probably cells
525.96s: so
527.32s: Overall bullish leaning in the overall volume that we saw transacting today
533.08s: Now let's take a look at the oh I because this expanded a lot now we have 835
538.60s: Thousand calls to 43 puts so this is built out quite nicely
543.88s: The other thing that you guys might
545.96s: Notice happening here. I know I do is there's way more of these 16 augs popping up here here here here
554.76s: We're seeing more red squares popping up in here
558.76s: That's important because this also means that there are people playing multiple cycles right like for me
565.40s: I was in the 16 augs and I actually just recently moved out to the 20 September's
569.88s: But that's the way that I trade these things
572.12s: It's very different than most people that I come across at least in the space that are really really centered on these super short-term
579.00s: explorations. It's just not how I do it. So
582.68s: I
583.64s: don't
584.84s: I don't find it anything other than
588.28s: Conviction leading people out to establishing this far out at this point because it's still kind of early
594.36s: We didn't see this kind of building in this 16 aug which in this case are 37 days out
600.36s: We didn't see this kind of building in the prior expiration cycles at least for the last few weeks people have been playing the fronts
606.44s: Very very heavily. So another interesting data point here
609.88s: So that's mostly what I'm seeing here
612.04s: We have an expansion of volatility in the short term without a doubt
615.64s: I see 139 134 132 and then it starts to drop off a cliff from there
621.08s: So my expectation would be as like something like 16 aug gets closer
626.20s: I would fully expect this volatility to start expanding that's kind of the overall trend that I've been seeing
632.28s: And it's also something I've actually started trading
634.84s: Because it has been fairly consistent thus far with meaningful moves I should add
640.52s: So
641.72s: As always any questions anything I should take a look at let me know be an outlier see you guys later
