0.60s: what is up you scall Wags I got to keep
3.56s: it a buck I had zero intentions of doing
6.92s: a gme update video today there wasn't
9.24s: too much that was sticking out to me I
11.28s: was just going through and cating data
14.48s: because I now am invested in this
17.24s: mentally I have an obsessive personality
19.68s: so I was just checking things tracking
22.60s: things and then something stuck out to
25.40s: me that looked pretty interesting so
27.96s: we'll take a look at that together in
29.56s: just a second now quick recap though
31.64s: since we're here looking at 23 June
34.28s: which was yesterday into today 24 June
36.52s: nothing sticks out to me crazy there's
38.76s: definitely depression across the entire
40.88s: options chain in terms of implied
42.60s: volatility so a lot of that is just IV
46.40s: bleeding off to a degree and as you'll
49.48s: note from the video I made
51.64s: yesterday the put implied volatility for
56.04s: the out of the monies on this front
57.52s: expiration is increasing as I absolutely
60.80s: anticipated which again is a tradable
62.92s: event it is now over
65.80s: 52% Vol something like that for the far
68.20s: out of the money puts there's a little
70.28s: more Kinks going on on these calls which
72.80s: is also another tradable event for
75.24s: volatility Traders none of that really
77.24s: matters so much here what's stuck out to
80.00s: me is completely different and it's
82.00s: actually not even anything in terms of
84.68s: the broad chain volatility or the
86.44s: volatility within the product what stuck
88.60s: out to me was this
90.72s: the call volume today was huge
94.80s: 27,7 40 contracts traded on the call
97.60s: side compared to
99.60s: 92666 uhoh on the put side don't know if
102.56s: that's ominous or not and the other
104.96s: thing I find interesting is this is
106.68s: blank I tried reloading the platform and
109.04s: it still didn't update which is kind of
110.52s: annoying so I was really really
111.88s: interested to dig into this call volume
114.00s: and see what the heck is going on if
116.16s: this UPS updates I will let you guys
118.48s: know and I'll just drop it as a comment
120.16s: in the video so I can see what it was
122.56s: but the fact that this is doing that is
124.68s: kind of weird but this is very novel to
128.60s: me and if you take a look at these
130.04s: purple boxes it's all 28 June that's the
132.96s: vast majority of this volume for both
136.04s: the call and the put side that's where
137.88s: all the activities going on there's some
140.36s: of these kind of Grays which if we take
142.24s: a look we can confirm I think these are
144.40s: probably the 19 July which they are the
147.04s: 30s are seeing some action as our the
151.24s: 40s the other thing I did was take a
153.28s: look at time and
154.84s: sales there was nothing in here that
157.40s: really made me feel any type of way
159.08s: except whoever bought the
162.28s: 1,110 of the 128 calls for 3 cents first
167.00s: yeah I it's a YOLO right you're just
168.56s: throwing money away essentially hoping
170.20s: something sticks here this is a cheap
171.76s: position that might seem like a big size
173.40s: but it's not at 3 cents it's like $3,000
176.24s: maybe 3,300 bucks so no big deal this is
180.28s: also hilarious to me just the fact that
182.20s: they literally paid way way way way too
185.84s: much for the V on these 5 190% Vol on
190.28s: these so if they get a big move they'll
192.20s: get paid out which is great hopefully so
194.28s: but these options are going to Decay
195.80s: super super fast if we take a look at
197.40s: these 128s
199.12s: quickly all the way out here and we look
202.68s: at the Theta Decay it's 2 cents they're
205.00s: right now mid at three so after a day
208.20s: they essentially lose their investment
209.56s: that's essentially what this is showing
210.92s: you they need a big price accommodation
213.08s: in order for these to come alive and
214.64s: again if you watched my videos on buying
216.68s: call options in gme smarter which I will
218.64s: link below in case you haven't the other
220.76s: problem with these super far out of the
222.00s: monies is that they need a huge move
224.84s: before they would start to pay you
226.08s: anything because the gamma is so low so
229.60s: even if you get a 10-point move these
231.76s: don't care that much you're not going to
233.84s: see much of it at all which is
235.80s: unfortunate because you need a really
237.92s: big move in order for these to pay you
240.16s: much of anything so maybe they think of
243.36s: big moves on the horizon but with a
245.44s: $3,300 position that's not super
247.88s: conviction on my side this just looks
249.84s: like somebody hoping something sticks
251.64s: and I'm hopeful for them maybe it will
254.04s: but it doesn't necessarily look great
256.24s: this I also thought was interesting
257.60s: right after the open that in the five
260.00s: July we had about a thousand of the 23
263.00s: puts go through and notice these are at
265.32s: a way more conservative implied
266.88s: volatility 112 so much much lower V
270.32s: happening at that transaction but long
272.60s: story short as I poke through this I
274.28s: definitely see more activity in the 28
275.80s: Junes but there was nothing that I
277.76s: thought yeah okay this is really really
279.88s: interesting buy
281.40s: activity I didn't see it and right now
284.12s: I'm only filtering by 100 lots and above
286.60s: typically for stuff like this especially
288.32s: if you're looking at a cheaper product
290.88s: like this one of the easier ways to
292.72s: filter this if we're kind of being
294.40s: efficient would be to Jack that up to
295.92s: like 500 because you'll see way less you
298.24s: can see where the bigger orders were
300.20s: and there just are not that many of them
302.96s: some are a spread so we don't really
305.72s: care about that yeah
309.48s: so time in sales isn't telling me too
312.00s: much but this is interesting so I looked
315.32s: at the strikes where this was kind of
317.52s: heavy and again it was the 25s and the
320.32s: 30s so what I'm postulating is if we pop
324.28s: over in here and we go to the 25s and
325.88s: the 30s let's take a look at the volume
329.40s: today
330.52s: matches there the volume exceeded the
333.04s: open interest so we know right out of
335.48s: the gate that we we can't go negative on
338.00s: the oi a lot of these are going to be
339.68s: opening positions at least 8,000 of them
341.72s: even if you take the 10,600 out of this
345.12s: you still have essentially 8,000 left
347.32s: over on the buy side so people are
349.32s: buying there and then if we take a look
350.96s: at the 30s there was
353.40s: $18,995 it about could flatten it out my
356.40s: guess is that's not what's happening
357.60s: here my guess is the majority of this
359.12s: also will probably be buy side at least
361.60s: as of now now the other thing that could
364.04s: be happening is people could be leing
365.52s: into spreads where they might be buying
368.36s: these selling these that can be a thing
371.56s: but we'll have to see how that goes the
373.72s: main thing that was interesting to me
375.16s: today was the amount of volume this I
378.44s: thought was novel especially given that
380.64s: there again isn't a lot of catalysts I
382.96s: haven't seen anything from roaring Kitty
385.12s: I haven't seen any real big updates I
386.84s: think there was a live stream earlier
388.52s: today by Larry but other than that it
391.68s: just I'm not seeing it so if you guys
394.36s: have any ideas from your side as always
396.52s: throw them in the comments I had a
398.36s: chance to connect with Richard I'm
400.36s: actually going to try to talk to him a
401.68s: little bit more to pick his brain as
402.96s: much as I can on what he's looking at I
404.52s: had a chance to go through his big Excel
405.84s: sheet and learn more about that and I
408.60s: mean I already dropped a thing in the
410.76s: Discord for my people but I mean the the
413.20s: tin foil hat is on for me so I'm in the
417.52s: process now as well of just starting to
420.40s: track ftds I'm going to Overlay
423.32s: volatility on top of this and then I'm
425.84s: actually going to start feeding a model
427.68s: that I'm in the process of building to
429.84s: try and forecast potential Cycles based
432.96s: on the rule sets that I've seen from
434.84s: Richard and bigy Smalls really just out
437.04s: of sheer curiosity I'm way too
438.40s: fascinated at this point like I've told
440.16s: you guys before this is like a crazy
442.56s: story for me and in the trading space
445.24s: there's not a lot of opportunities to
446.72s: come across stuff like this especially
448.60s: I'm fortunate at this point I've been
449.80s: doing this for a long time so I have a
451.76s: lot of different things I can look at
453.52s: and I know to look at so that's the game
455.36s: plan if you have any questions anything
457.32s: that you want me to take a look at let
458.60s: me know be an outlier I'll see you guys
460.24s: later
