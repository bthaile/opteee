0.56s: what's up everyone happy Monday we're
2.36s: going to do a quick recap here I
4.32s: specifically just want to take a look at
6.32s: crowd strike in GameStop in this video
8.96s: because we have the YouTube live session
10.48s: later today to drive into the broader
12.80s: markets cuz there's a lot going on for
15.24s: us to take a look at so let's pivot away
18.04s: from all this noise and let's take a
20.40s: look at crowd strike first really quick
22.76s: and boom there it is I had a short on in
25.32s: there today because it just gapped down
29.64s: and I did not see that getting better it
32.00s: was a very basic thesis about as basic
35.08s: as you could possibly get bad news and
38.16s: with a gap down on top of that it just
41.08s: looked like the sellers were coming out
42.60s: and they did if you take a look at this
44.32s: volume candle behind my head right here
46.52s: this volume candle was 90% sale volume
49.12s: there there was just nobody wanting to
50.88s: step in front of this thing and that's
52.16s: really what led to this big red candle
55.76s: all the way down so this I surprised me
58.76s: a little bit it looked like it was
60.28s: starting to mellow out especially
61.96s: because we had the candle come down
64.16s: touching the 200 is whatever I I guess
66.48s: it's something I don't care so much
67.84s: about that it's just the fact that there
68.92s: was a candle because what that tells me
70.64s: like this Wick because it tells me that
72.44s: people were still selling selling
74.00s: selling and then sooner or later
75.32s: somebody started buying right that's
77.76s: what moved it back up so the fact that
80.52s: it went down here and then moved back up
83.60s: it indicated to me that people might be
85.52s: willing to start buying this thing and
87.96s: then today just nope gap down all the
90.44s: way down and notice how little tiny this
92.64s: Wick is this is just massive sale volume
95.20s: all day not a lot of people wanting to
98.56s: transact in there so what does this mean
101.52s: well this is why when I talked about
103.32s: this over this past weekend I set two
105.00s: alerts to the upside and downside and I
107.28s: specifically said I'll trade it either
109.32s: direction I don't care I still think
111.32s: this move is probably overdone when we
114.76s: finish getting the news I think the
116.08s: reason why it's not overdone right now
117.56s: is because the market is still
118.80s: synthesizing the Imp
120.64s: and the overall severity of things which
122.80s: clearly we don't have a firm grasp on
125.20s: just yet so that's that interesting now
129.44s: let's pivot over to GameStop because
131.84s: there were a couple people that hit me
133.44s: up today asking about a bunch of put
137.52s: volume in the stock and it looks like
140.28s: folks were seeing a lot of put sales is
142.88s: what they tell me so I thought we could
145.00s: take a investigative look together and
147.56s: see what's going on in here so let's
150.32s: Dive Right In the first thing I notice
152.24s: is we're still so
155.84s: range-bound we have this low over here
159.40s: which is not using the wick using the
161.84s: body the body of this is somewhere
163.88s: around like 23 and a qu something like
165.88s: that and then to the upside again just
168.08s: using the bodies not the wick it's like
170.76s: 2850 something like that so we are just
173.32s: so range Bound in here and we're seeing
177.44s: a little bit of life just in terms terms
180.08s: of upward pressure but if you take a
182.28s: look at the candle today it's still not
185.32s: super bullish so it was 48% sale volume
189.28s: today so what this tells me is that
192.72s: there are still people trying to fade
195.36s: this but there are just a slight slight
198.32s: Edge in people wanting to buy it which I
201.12s: do find interesting I also find
203.28s: interesting that it crossed over slunder
205.88s: on the CCI I'll get myself out of the
207.92s: way real fast so you can see right
209.44s: there's CCI I don't care a ton again
213.60s: about technical analysis in this
215.04s: specific product because it is so
217.44s: different in how it behaves I see people
219.44s: say all the time like oh it respects
221.24s: this perfectly and it's like no it
223.28s: doesn't man like it doesn't it's it's
225.40s: why it does this is because it does
228.24s: other stuff so the main thing I'm trying
231.96s: to emphasize is when you're looking at
233.76s: something whose price behavior is not
236.88s: solely determined by whether whether or
240.00s: not people are valuing the company
241.40s: higher than they did yesterday there are
243.16s: other forces at play and it's important
245.64s: to acknowledge that because if the idea
247.96s: here is that you can run technical
249.40s: analysis in here like standard technical
251.92s: analysis like you're you're going to
253.12s: have a hard time you're going to have a
254.44s: really hard time moving in playing with
256.52s: this thing because the other thing like
258.40s: just from a general price movement
260.16s: perspective something to go from
262.48s: essentially all the way down here to
264.84s: shoot up to this it's like that's an
266.92s: abnormal movement it's what makes it so
269.32s: cool so I would just encourage people to
271.64s: keep an open mind when it comes to
273.20s: looking at the product you'll see that I
274.60s: still will overlay some level of
276.12s: technical analysis but it's a sliding
278.08s: scale if I'm trading something like this
280.36s: as compared to the indices the weight
282.92s: that I'm going to apply on technical
284.24s: analysis is going to be completely
285.44s: different rightfully so because they
287.92s: behave very differently so let's take a
290.52s: look at these options chains the first
292.64s: thing I noticed is that volume today was
295.28s: heavy but light here's what I mean from
298.40s: an overall volume persp persective we're
300.28s: just under 200,000 contracts that's
302.32s: relatively light for GameStop it's heavy
305.44s: in the sense that this 200,000 call
307.92s: volume was opposed by just
311.80s: 46,000 puts so really big call skew
316.76s: volume on the day and we're back at it
320.00s: yet again with the majority of this
323.00s: being for this coming
325.84s: Friday I've learned one of my favorite
327.96s: sayings that they use you guys use in
330.64s: the the a community which I'm
332.56s: continually just loving learning about
335.12s: but they'll say you know that it's
336.88s: always tomorrow oh I I actually love
339.40s: that so much we use similar sayings in
341.20s: the military we'll say things like the
343.24s: easiest day was yesterday and
345.60s: like that but it it reminds me of that
348.00s: where it's just like it's always
349.32s: tomorrow because I mean this is just a
352.36s: lot of volume for a seemingly quieter
356.96s: period but again that that's what makes
359.12s: this thing so interesting is that a
360.36s: quiet period could be quickly not a
362.04s: quiet period I mean and to to prove that
364.20s: point and to kind of provide the counter
366.56s: to my own statement there this was a
369.24s: real quiet period it had a high of 15 a
372.16s: low of 10 and it was just kind of
373.68s: trending around in here and then all of
375.20s: a sudden it was no longer quiet like
377.68s: pretty quick so I understand that now
380.40s: again the way I would structure my
381.72s: trades and all that stuff is very very
383.52s: different but that doesn't matter so
386.84s: let's take a look Instead at some of
389.40s: this open interest now where we're
391.76s: starting to see more call oi building
394.76s: out still has a ways to go in order to
396.68s: get to like it's at least two times put
400.12s: oi right so the put oi on this right now
402.48s: is 37 I'm sorry uh 371,000 compared to
406.72s: 622k on the call side so this isn't the
410.12s: same ratio we've seen previously when it
411.80s: starts getting like super super bullish
414.00s: now let's take a look at the time and
415.56s: sales and see if we can find these
417.12s: series of put trades that people are
418.56s: talking about people are saying that
419.80s: there's a bunch of like bullish put
422.04s: trades that come out so the first thing
423.84s: I'm going to do is kill off these
425.04s: spreads I don't really care to see
426.88s: spreads in this context so I nuked those
430.72s: the next thing is I'm looking at both
432.52s: calls and puts both buys and sales in
434.48s: here and there are different ways we can
438.44s: filter this so what I'm going to do is
440.40s: start by filtering and looking at just
443.40s: the put side to see if I can find where
445.68s: all these puts were coming in so here's
447.44s: one block right here that I can see
449.24s: clearly day so these the market was 162
453.88s: by 182 so this came technically towards
456.24s: the mid of that market but it's closer
459.92s: to the bid side so this tells me that
461.84s: looks like a sale that looks like
463.04s: somebody sold
464.92s: 847 of the 25 puts expiring in two a
468.48s: that's what that looks like to me and
470.52s: you can run through and do that kind of
472.72s: analysis all the way through here so in
474.64s: this case for the 26th July expiration
478.88s: the 24 half puts these look like
482.56s: somebody bought them because the market
484.84s: was 59 by 66 these came in at 66 that's
488.24s: looks like a a purchase trade now again
490.84s: the kind of syntax that thinker swim
494.08s: uses if it's red it's telling you that
496.48s: it likely was sold and then if it is
500.28s: green it likely was bought so if we sort
504.24s: these by quantity to kind of see where
505.84s: the bigger trades came in I don't see
509.64s: this giant sale volume that people were
512.20s: alluding to I do see sales for sure but
514.96s: I also see a lot of buying of puts so
518.44s: all I'm kind of pulling away with here
521.00s: is that this doesn't look conclusive to
522.72s: me either way that there is massive
524.80s: massive massive amounts of one or the
526.40s: other it looks like a bit of a mixed bag
529.08s: now to get a cleaner view we can take a
530.96s: look at something like this from our
533.52s: buddies over at unusual whales which
536.28s: they have a neater tool right it's just
538.64s: cleaner to see
540.04s: and we can take a look we want to see
542.16s: instances where we transacted at the bid
545.08s: and we want it just for the puts and we
547.08s: want it for today which is what this is
548.64s: looking at and there was a couple big
550.76s: trades no doubt so we have out in 2026
556.56s: two of them and that's important to note
559.16s: so we have
561.36s: the uh what are these the 12s and the
565.84s: 125s out in 2026
569.60s: for the more near term into August we
572.72s: have the
574.88s: 25s so these are big but not crazy not
579.16s: absolutely insane for what we've seen
580.88s: now if we open this up to take a look at
583.40s: the premium that's been transacted in
585.04s: here it's a little bit of a different
586.88s: story because I actually see another
589.48s: thing that's way more interesting to me
591.12s: which is
592.44s: this take a look at
594.60s: that that is a series of calls out in
598.76s: 202 in 2026 so these are long-dated kind
601.68s: of boring for the near-term stuff but
603.92s: take a look at this they're getting
605.12s: punched in relatively consistent timing
608.04s: 500 500 500 500 500 all at the
612.04s: 20s and they're bringing in a lot of
615.72s: money so this is somebody that's selling
618.84s: calls they sold 463,000 there 46 like
623.48s: this is a ton of money that they brought
625.00s: in this here is easily over $3 million
629.32s: worth of Premium especially if this is
631.28s: also the same person which I probably
633.16s: would guess it is so these 20s got
637.60s: cracked with a ton a ton of short
642.32s: premium that somebody with a pretty big
645.56s: position is building this up so if we
647.36s: have
649.84s: 500 500 contracts that gives us 50,000
653.68s: shares times 1 2 3 4 5
657.64s: 6 we'll start there
661.16s: that gives us
663.36s: 300,000 shares right there then we have
668.20s: essentially let's call it
670.52s: another
672.48s: 50 100 I mean this is a a pretty massive
677.20s: position is kind of what this boils down
679.60s: to I'm probably seeing something to the
682.04s: tune I'm guessing of like maybe 400,000
684.60s: shares a little over that especially cuz
687.12s: I just noticed it goes even further down
688.52s: here that were that they were still
691.08s: hitting these now this is a really
693.60s: really interesting trade to me because
696.00s: for me from a trading perspective the
698.48s: prospect of selling premium that's all
700.88s: the way out there in 2025 is fascinating
704.56s: the reason why it's fascinating is
706.16s: because it doesn't move that much so if
708.44s: we go out here to 17 jan25 I think
711.20s: that's when those were right the 17
714.72s: Jans uh this one okay or no window one
718.96s: sec there it is there it is a little bit
721.84s: of a delay yeah 17 J 25s so as I look at
726.84s: those I look at the 20s they're in the
730.00s: money so that's good from a perspective
733.32s: of essentially hedging a potential
735.28s: downside so if you have a really big
736.88s: position and you want to hedge some of
739.04s: the downside you can sell those calls in
741.00s: the money because if they fall out of
743.00s: the money you've made a ton of money now
746.40s: the other interesting thing that I find
748.20s: about these 20s is if you look at the
749.84s: Theta they're getting 2 pennies a day
752.76s: it's just not that much money especially
755.36s: if they had instead came into something
757.28s: even as close as the 25s but like the
759.60s: 32s 39s even these 60s if we take a look
763.20s: at something like those 20s there're
765.16s: still at least add an extra penny a day
767.04s: which might not sound like a lot but on
768.40s: a position that size it's actually quite
770.08s: meaningful and 60 days within 60 days is
772.68s: right as stated Decay starts to really
774.60s: accelerate so that position is is very
777.68s: interesting to me and that looks like
779.48s: somebody building a position that has a
782.60s: lot of shares cuz that's you're that's
784.52s: the reason why these would be sold in my
786.08s: opinion is against shares they could be
788.72s: sold naked
790.64s: definitely to me that would be Madness
795.04s: especially on something that can move
796.56s: the way that this thing does to sell
798.36s: those in the money I would say that this
800.16s: is far more indicative of somebody who
802.28s: has shares that they would not mind
804.08s: selling at 20 if they had to and they're
807.44s: collecting a bunch of money to do it
810.72s: that's what that is now from the other
813.04s: trade that I saw today that was really
814.48s: interesting was the 362 lot at the 20s
820.04s: again same expiration this is out though
822.04s: in
823.24s: 2026 and these came in at the offer so
826.44s: somebody bought these and they bought
827.84s: almost
828.76s: $500,000 worth of this position so
831.84s: there's a lot of big volume coming into
834.72s: this thing if you take a look at the
836.24s: premium that's being transacted in
838.44s: remember the last couple couple times I
839.48s: showed you this you know we see like a
841.36s: handful maybe 10 12 positions with total
843.28s: premium above $100,000 now if you take a
845.28s: look at this it's literally this whole
846.80s: entire top of the screen that's above
849.04s: $100,000 now if we limit this
851.44s: specifically to people that are buying
853.40s: calls you'll see that it's
855.76s: slower we do have that giant half a
858.28s: million dollar position but beyond that
860.52s: it's much slower so this to me looks
862.96s: like people settling in not necessarily
865.84s: playing these really short-term giant
867.96s: upside moves but moving around
870.44s: established positions that's my best
872.48s: guess as it sits right now we'll see as
874.80s: always we'll see it's fun to keep an eye
876.60s: on this it's fun to see where it goes if
878.72s: there's ever anything you want me to
880.08s: take a look at let your boy know I love
881.80s: looking at this stuff be an outlier I'll
883.92s: see you guys later
