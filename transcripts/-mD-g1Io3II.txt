0.00s: 29.8. So close. So today's video is a quick update on GameStop because we are coming
9.32s: into earning soon and we are literally consolidating. Like this is a normal consolidation.
15.68s: The ADR is a little bit wide with some of these candles being so broad, but look at the
21.68s: volume and look at the price level. This is about as exciting as I think it gets for
26.96s: our GameStop is a company in general. Now I specify as a company in general because
32.40s: this doesn't necessarily strike me as parabolic short squeeze, gamma squeeze up. Again,
40.72s: it can always happen. We don't know when the conditions are set for that to occur.
45.24s: But what I'm highlighting is from an underlying company perspective. This is a company
50.24s: that's actually gaining a little bit of attention and that's a good thing. Because if we
55.20s: look at the volume here, it's been sustained from the 8th of November and the volume
61.84s: is high. So it was 15 million here, 26 million here, 18 million here, 18.5 million here, 16.5
69.84s: here, 16.5 here, 8.5, 8.7, 22 as of today. The reason why that matters is because a lot
80.56s: of people are curious, if roaring kiddies involved in literally who knows that dude is like
86.24s: fucking Batman. He just kind of shoves up when it's time for him to show up. Could be. But the
90.56s: cool part about this is that even if roaring kiddies part of this, he's not all of it. And that
95.92s: is even more powerful in my opinion for GameStop as a company to start garnering some attention
103.68s: and capital. If we zoom this out to a six month time frame, we've been basing above this 25
111.44s: handle since November 11. We haven't seen this level since essentially we were around the squeeze
119.84s: period from the spring slash early summer. So the fact that we're rallying up to this point
127.04s: and then remaining above this point is really cool for me to see. Look at all the moving averages,
133.28s: they're starting to organize as I would prefer them to. So we have short terms that are upward
138.32s: sloping. We have mid term moving averages that are upward sloping, crossing above slightly longer
142.88s: term moving averages. So there's a really great configuration that's going on here. The other thing
147.52s: from an RSI perspective, it still has momentum. Right. So the RSI indicator line itself is hovering above
156.40s: the what is what do I have here a seven day moving average for the RSI and their upward sloping,
163.12s: they're not overextended. Right. So we can see that they're still hovering below 70. So all
168.64s: and all this looks really strong to me. Now just because it looks strong doesn't mean that it's not
174.64s: going to consolidate, come back down, consolidate, shoot back up. The main thing I'm trying to highlight
179.52s: as I look at this is the price action, the fact that we're getting several days consecutively
184.64s: above the 25 handle generally organized in a consolidation zone, slightly bigger candle,
190.24s: slightly bigger volume is good. That's all good in my opinion. So when we take a look at implied
197.20s: volatility, we do have still really high IV, right. This is showing one 31.8% if we take a peak at the
204.72s: options chain, you can see that it's obviously looking at the next primary expiration. That's
209.36s: 30 days away out here. We can see that there is elevated volatility on the near term
214.32s: expiration. We still see pretty strong call skew as it pertains to OI relative to the puts with
221.52s: 683,000 calls against 250,000 puts. Now one of the things we noted on the live stream last night
227.92s: as we were looking at this is a big change in the structure of the OI breakdown. What I mean by that
236.40s: is if we take a look at a lot of these green boxes that's actually 17,000, 25, these are 60
244.64s: day options and there's a lot of them. The cool part about that is that a lot of the activity that we're
252.56s: seeing here is funneled in near term explorations that used to be the case. Now we're spread across
260.80s: explorations, which leads to a slightly more robust options picture for it. And it means that
268.00s: people aren't just trying to play super short term pops. These are people that are actually positioning
273.84s: for the upside of the company. This also is bolstered by what we were just talking about in
278.96s: terms of the chart and how that looks now. These are people that are starting to play the company
283.68s: itself more so to the upside as compared to just the violent moves up and down, which still
288.64s: can occur and still can be played. But again, my perspective on GameStop is I want to see it do
295.12s: well as a company. I want to see GameStop be one of those stories where people were essentially
300.48s: trying to short it into the dirt, try to make it go bankrupt so that rich people could get a
304.80s: couple of tax breaks on their gains. And this entire story has been propped up first by the retail
311.60s: trading community that essentially didn't let it happen. And if the company itself can then turn around
318.32s: and be something that's really profitable, really effective as a company is a business to me.
323.12s: That's a Cinderella story. Like that is really, really cool. That is a really interesting
328.32s: scenario where like the little guy stood up against the big guy out maneuvered them and then
333.04s: through good leadership the company is starting to turn itself around. So that's why I'm excited
337.28s: to look at it from that perspective. And I understand that a lot of people really prefer to look
341.12s: at it from Moas trying to see this big giant squeeze, which I still would love to see that myself.
346.16s: But I really love the fact that it looks like the company itself is being respected and it's growing
352.56s: and it looks like it's doing well. So we'll take a look at what the earnings expectations are coming
357.12s: up. Take a look at the call volume today. 348,000 calls against only 52,000 puts. And if you take a
362.48s: look at the breakdown, most of them were buys. So these are people that are buying calls playing
369.68s: this probably to the upside. We'll take a look at unusual whales in just a moment. I want to take
374.24s: a look at the wall, picture now as you know, I like to do to get a sense of the surface. And as
380.24s: pre-usual, I'm going to look at the primary exploration, it's just because it helps get rid of some
384.08s: of the noise. Let's do June and take a look. We now have call skew on all of them. All of them.
395.20s: That's also very interesting. So the call IV for the out of the money calls is priced high relative
402.24s: to the put IV. And again, this is typically we price, we being the market, but market makers and
408.48s: the rest of the market will typically price IV more rich in the direction that we expect to see movement.
414.96s: That's kind of the notion behind it. So it definitely has IV call skew right now, which is very
419.92s: interesting. And it shows that standard, I don't want to call it fear to the upside. Although it is
425.28s: partially fear, you want to get compensated. For example, if you're selling calls to the upside,
429.44s: you don't want to get ran over and that's why these will be priced up a little bit, but it's also just
433.92s: expectation of movement. So that's very interesting for me to see. So now let's take a look at unusual
442.16s: whales. And there's a couple of things that stuck out to me. So this is looking at GME and we're looking
451.76s: at GME for this week. So essentially from the 18th to the 22nd, we have pretty strong call buying
460.56s: activity as far as it looks. Again, there's nothing huge popping off of me here. There's a
466.00s: 350,000 dollar, 27, which that is a big trade I want to be clear. And this is also a very,
471.04s: very short term. So that absolutely is interesting, but it's still not quite massive enough where,
478.72s: you know, I'm reading super far into it, we do see more build out at these longer
483.76s: explorations though. The 2025s are getting hit here for the 20s. So the 2026s are being traded.
491.84s: So there's people trading these deeper explorations, which is generally cool to see. But there
496.48s: wasn't a whole lot from the option chain that's jumping out at me thinking like, oh, this is crazy.
501.28s: Can't believe this is happening. It looks active. It looks moderately active as the way that I would
506.48s: think about it. Now if we take a look at the dark pool really quick, just to see if there's anything
511.84s: special going on this week as well. And oh, oh, that's because it's, I was going to say that's like
523.04s: really interesting that it would be that light. Yeah, relatively quiet. So there's definitely a
529.76s: handful of million dollar transactions over the last few days, but it's a little more quiet
535.44s: than it's been the last few weeks. So again, nothing jumping out at me here as super
541.60s: indicative one way or the other just looks like interesting movement, but this isn't like skyrocketing
546.40s: up and out. I'm not seeing anything like that. So the last thing I want to look at really quick though
552.08s: is, well, first, ball and like bill shout out to my buddy Benjamin from the Benjamin YouTube channel.
560.24s: Let me grab that real quick. If you guys haven't seen this video, it's a must.
565.44s: Yeah, Ben is a fucking hilarious dude that can tell fantastic stories. And this is all about
573.12s: bill weighing. And you should absolutely bill watch this video. Make sure you subscribe to his channel
578.56s: too, because his stuff is just comedic relief. The Benjamin's also kind of like Batman. I talk to
583.12s: him pretty regularly, but you never know when you're going to get a video from him. You guys should
587.20s: know though that I'm, I'm like your biggest advocate. I constantly am ballering him to make
591.84s: more videos for you all because from a selfish perspective, I like what he makes. So it's not just for
597.52s: you guys. It's also for me. But you know, I try to keep him pushing on on making funny videos for us,
604.88s: because he's good at it. But looks like he's going to present for good old 18 years. And a rough
612.96s: round the edges of it. So let's read a former billionaire soon, quick weighing bill weighing sentenced
621.12s: to, it's nice that they really simplify that for us Americans. You know that they really tend to do
626.08s: that with some of these names to really just make it about his base. It's not even a hard American name.
632.48s: 18 years in prison, Wednesday, which costs Wall Street more than 10 billion. He was sentenced.
638.16s: We're jury convicted him on 10 criminal charges, including wire fraud, security,
642.24s: fraud, and market manipulation. The amount of losses that were caused by your conductor larger
646.48s: than any other losses I've dealt with. That's nice. He's said a new personal best. I'm a
650.80s: big fan of that and a gym and whatnot. My personal best in the gym these days look really sad.
655.28s: Some still dealing with the fucking herniated disc. So it's a lot of like how many pushups can I
659.28s: do before my leg goes to sleep or something. But you know, still nice to get some peepees out here.
663.52s: And it says the US training office man had in saute 21 year prison term for herwing,
668.40s: unusually long for a white collar case and for him to 4-fit 12.35 billion in make
674.16s: restitution for victims. I'm actually curious what he's going to have to pay. Let's see.
683.44s: Net Worth has fallen at most. 55.3 mil. So it looks like he's doing okay.
692.72s: A little too okay. We'll have to see. I'll have to dig a little deeper into this and see
697.20s: like what he's actually going to pay because that's, you know, that doesn't seem like a bad margin.
701.84s: If that's all you're losing on something like that. But back to this and GameStop,
707.20s: I do want to talk really quick about where we're seeing these options come through simply because
713.92s: trying to understand the broader build out for these traits. So there's a healthy mix. I'm not
721.44s: going to worry too much about the bids right now. I'm actually going to pull those down. Again,
725.52s: sometimes we can have purchases that happen at a bid. It's just rare. So I want to
731.28s: remove the noise so that we can focus on the the call side and see if there's anything sticking
736.08s: out to us. And in terms of overall premium buildouts, there's a mix, but there's quite a few out
743.92s: in 25. So these are people building slightly longer term positions. So I see the tens. I see the 20s.
752.00s: I see the 30s. I see the 29. So it's kind of like across the chain. I see the 20s like we talked
757.44s: about before. And again, I like to see that. The fact that I see this happening at a bunch of
762.48s: different strikes and whatnot tells us that there's multiple participants. So it becomes a bigger
767.68s: movement if there's more actors involved as compared to one person that may or may not be a cat
773.20s: who can have a massive impact. And hopefully we'll see more of a footprint from him at some point.
778.24s: I'm excited. I look literally every day to see if I can pick anything up because it's kind of fun.
783.28s: It's like playing detective. It's, you know, the sad life is a trader. It's pretty fucking boring.
787.28s: If you think about it, especially when you figure out how to trade, it's kind of like a repetitive
791.12s: process. You know what you're doing every day. It's not like a bunch of surprises or excitement.
794.40s: So this is where I get to find my excitement. Try to see what kind of nonsense or crazy trades are
798.40s: going on. But the from a broader perspective, the fact that it's is flat across different
804.48s: expressions, different strikes is good. That means that there's a lot of participants building
808.64s: out and trading to the upside, which is honestly exactly what I think we would want to see.
813.52s: Let's take a look at one more thing. And you can see on GameStop, net premium is heavy to the
821.52s: buy side. We can see obviously there's a really, really large call premium coming through. So yeah,
829.12s: I mean, the overall trend that we see here is is really positive in my opinion. There's just so many
835.52s: more calls coming through and so many more calls being bought, which is again, I think generally
842.40s: generally strong. And it's yeah, being be-and-traded and built out to the upside. So that's what
848.08s: it's like, and like, stoked to see the life, stoked to see 30 within sight. And the biggest thing
852.72s: I'm stoked about with respect to 30 is not, it's not like a blow through 30 because of, again,
858.72s: a squeeze is happening, which is always fun. But this is like literally the company is being valued
865.20s: higher. And we'll take a closer look as it gets nearer to earnings so that we can run through that
869.20s: together. But overall, strong movement. As always, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know,
873.44s: be an outlier. I'll see you later.
