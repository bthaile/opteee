0.00s: Let's talk about trading in your IRA account.
2.34s: This is one of the less discussed topics
5.30s: because a lot of people kind of set and forget their IRA.
8.10s: And I actually think it's a mistake.
9.62s: If you're taking the time to build the skill set
11.58s: of trading and you're successful at it,
13.78s: there's no reason not to translate that over
15.98s: into your retirement accounts.
17.82s: So I'm gonna walk you through some different ways
19.78s: you can think about it, how I like to think about it.
21.90s: And then at the end of the video,
23.14s: I'm going to give you a couple actionable strategies
26.14s: that you could bounce around
27.78s: and see if they're a good fit for you or not
29.54s: to employ in your portfolio.
31.58s: What's up everybody?
32.42s: Eric here, welcome back to all the outliers
33.94s: and a shout out to the Patreon family.
35.54s: You guys make content like this possible
37.06s: if what I do help do in any way, consider signing up
39.74s: so that I can pay my editor
41.26s: to make these videos more fun for you to watch.
43.26s: Should you trade your IRA account?
45.94s: My opinion I would argue for yes.
48.62s: I think it makes sense and it's for a few reasons.
51.06s: The first one is if we look back at 2022,
55.34s: using my own account as an example,
57.54s: the S&P 500 was down 19.4%.
62.34s: Yet I ended up the year up 5.3% on my IRA,
67.70s: which was about a 15% return on an invested capital,
70.62s: 5% 5.3% return on the account itself.
73.68s: And this was with 32 trades.
75.94s: I did not interact with the portfolio much at all.
80.18s: Yet I grossly outperformed the S&P 500.
84.74s: To me, this is why it's worth your consideration.
88.10s: So why only 32 trades if I'm trading my margin account
93.10s: way more than that?
93.82s: Well, it's for a few reasons.
95.14s: The way I approach my IRA is I want to optimize
99.78s: the long-term performance of the account.
102.42s: But I don't want to spend a bunch of time in there
104.18s: because again, I'm already spending a bunch of time doing
106.26s: a lot of other things.
107.34s: So my goal in trading an IRA account
109.78s: is actually wrapped right around efficiency.
113.02s: How can I very efficiently trade my portfolio?
117.38s: So there's a couple of things to keep in mind.
119.66s: The whole idea here is trading it
121.86s: is because it's tax-advanced.
123.62s: So depending on if it's a raw through traditional,
125.70s: there's different tax advantages that come with both.
127.94s: But the reason why this matters is because if you can
130.90s: optimize and achieve better returns here,
133.74s: you kind of double the effect because of the tax
136.62s: considerations.
137.62s: So that's why it's worth at least some of your effort.
140.22s: Now, as far as I see it,
141.82s: there are kind of two different ways
143.38s: you can go about this.
144.58s: You can either employ an inactive...
149.94s: Did I stutter?
151.46s: Yes, yes, he did.
152.94s: Style, where your dollar cost averaging into an index ETF.
157.14s: So you could do things like spy, IWM and the queues.
160.18s: You could do things like leverage ETFs if you're so inclined.
163.38s: And this is kind of what that looks like.
165.90s: So you can take a look at portfolio visualizer
169.86s: to get idea of different portfolio structures
171.98s: and whatnot to see how the performance goes.
174.02s: But the reason why dollar cost averaging
176.42s: is really important for those that don't know what that is.
179.30s: All we're doing is setting a regular cadence to buy things.
182.94s: So if your dollar cost averaging into spy,
185.14s: that means like every single month,
187.18s: you would put in the same dollar amount into spy.
190.14s: And this helps us streamline and smooth our returns.
195.22s: If you buy all of it at once,
197.30s: then there's a chance you might buy it when it's really high.
199.98s: And that doesn't benefit you in case it drops.
202.22s: But if you buy it every single month,
204.86s: well, that means that sometimes you'll buy it when it's I,
206.82s: sometimes you'll buy it when it's low,
208.10s: sometimes you'll buy it when it's in the middle,
209.62s: so that in the aggregate,
211.18s: you actually develop a pretty good cost basis.
213.90s: So that's really the idea for an active.
216.10s: You can pick something as simple as that.
217.86s: Then there's more active.
219.74s: Now, again, this is nowhere near as active as I am
222.14s: in a margin account,
223.22s: but you can kind of combine some of the benefits of this
226.82s: with the skillset that you've taken the time to develop
230.50s: via trading options, whether it's trend trading,
233.06s: but for me, I tend to look at the coverage triangle,
237.02s: which this probably is nothing new to anybody here.
239.50s: I actually have a recent video that goes through the coverage
242.74s: triangle in depth, which I highly encourage you to take a look at.
246.90s: But other things that makes sense in here,
248.62s: a ratio covered call in diagonals,
250.58s: which I have videos about both of those as well.
252.70s: All of them will be linked in the notes below,
254.86s: but I am not trading a lot of speculative trades in here personally.
259.58s: This is all core style trading,
262.10s: and what that looks like is typically the coverage triangle.
265.94s: And I'll show you what that looks like and how I employ it,
269.14s: because again, it's a pretty optimized approach for me.
272.42s: I'm not interacting with the account much at all.
274.34s: I'd probably look at it like once a month, if that.
276.66s: So let's take a look now at what we can trade in an IRA
281.74s: so that we understand what's available to us.
283.86s: So this is from Schwab.
285.18s: You're going to have to check with your broker on whatever they offer,
288.26s: but these are the different things you can do in a Schwab IRA account.
292.86s: These are kind of bigger descriptions on some of the things
297.38s: that you cannot do, like short selling, selling naked,
301.06s: or trading on margin.
302.38s: And then for those that are wondering that whether or not you can use
306.22s: like portfolio margin in an IRA account, you can not.
311.06s: Again, double check with your broker.
312.70s: So each be slightly different, but this is generally what you're able to do.
317.30s: So if you'll take a look, the coverage triangle fits into this, no problem.
320.98s: Now let's take a look at how I deploy the coverage triangle
324.70s: in a quick kind of overview style.
326.94s: The strategy itself is pretty bullish.
329.82s: That's where we make the most money, but it does okay in neutral market conditions.
334.06s: You can tailor it different ways to appeal to either income or growth.
338.94s: And then once you take the time to develop the strategy,
341.18s: it's really rinse and repeat.
342.54s: I'm not spending a lot of time each month doing this.
344.86s: This is why for the coverage triangle, I typically trade in index ETF.
348.30s: And I just cycle the product in there.
350.42s: Now for a year like 2022, when the market's down a lot,
354.50s: notice how this doesn't work well in bearish conditions.
357.10s: So how did I walk out unscathed?
363.50s: By dollar cost averaging in and by the short call component to the strategy.
368.82s: That's how I ended up making money.
370.50s: So all in all, I think something like the coverage triangle probably makes sense
375.66s: in quite a few people's portfolios, I have to center myself there.
378.90s: I was way off kilter throwing me off.
380.82s: But I think the coverage triangle is a great choice in an IRA account.
385.14s: It's something that you can build a sustainable position in an index ETF
389.46s: and US-based index ETFs continue to make highs over time.
393.70s: It's not like what you see in Japan, meaning you can dollar cost average
397.74s: into something like this with your entire account.
400.14s: And still makes sense long term.
401.94s: Now, if you are a little more risk averse, you're trying to appeal to different
406.10s: portfolio objectives, you could build a split portfolio that you trade
410.18s: coverage triangles.
410.94s: So you can have your equity allocation again via index ETF.
414.50s: And then you can have a bond allocation that you also trade the coverage
417.30s: trend.
417.82s: The reason why it's such a great approach is because it allows us to dollar
420.90s: cost average in regularly.
422.22s: Overall, if it's a down market that actually gives us a lot of ability to make
425.42s: a bunch of money when we get a rebound because this is a longer term hypothesis.
429.14s: And then you're also trading short calls against it.
431.14s: So when things do go down, you start to hedge some of that risk and make a
434.74s: little bit of money, even when things are kind of trending flat.
437.38s: So let me know what you think.
