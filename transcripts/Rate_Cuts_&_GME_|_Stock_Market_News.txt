0.84s: what's up outliers quick market update I
2.60s: want to talk about two things the first
4.32s: thing is just some general broad Market
6.48s: updates and flow as we're getting into
9.08s: this next interesting period next week
11.92s: of the Fed rate Cuts expected on 18
14.92s: September and then I want to talk a
17.00s: little bit about GameStop just because
19.64s: we came up on another expiration so I'm
21.60s: going to get us prepped up for our
23.52s: GameStop live stream tomorrow at 5:00
26.28s: p.m. Pacific time so let's get right in
28.44s: what's going on in the market a pretty
30.60s: big turnaround that's what I noticed
32.08s: this week RIT large so if we take a look
34.84s: across the different sectors we can see
36.32s: that the S&P 500 is now kind of hovering
40.00s: right near all-time highs again it's
42.00s: rallied right back up it's had a fairly
45.28s: one-sided move starting from the 9th we
48.48s: can see Tech is still rallying um it's
52.64s: lagging behind the s&p500 still and it
56.08s: is still a bit away from alltime well
60.84s: near term highs I should say here as
63.00s: compared to spy and then the Russell
65.28s: caught a really big bid today except it
68.32s: still is not even getting near its
71.44s: near-term lower highs let alone
74.24s: near-term highs so the Russell is also
77.92s: lagging quite a bit vix is down 16 and a
82.48s: half bonds are up so what's going on
85.64s: here well in my opinion it looks like
88.56s: the market is starting to to price in a
90.92s: little bit more this whole probability
93.08s: of a cut and we're trying to see how
95.24s: things are going to settle you can see
97.20s: for the New York Stock Exchange net
99.16s: highs lows the net lows essentially
101.88s: evaporated um there's on a gross low
104.60s: basis there's 10 so the New York Stock
107.04s: Exchange is really starting to take off
108.72s: pretty meaningfully here and if we take
110.96s: a look at the NASDAQ it's still you know
114.32s: gaining momentum but nothing near like
117.08s: what you're seeing in the New York Stock
120.20s: Exchange so from a a broader perspective
124.16s: here the market I find to be at a still
127.36s: a very interesting point I don't read
129.72s: into this move too much I'm playing it
131.92s: I'm both long right now um Futures and
136.28s: options in all of the indices I have
138.84s: positions in e- minis q's and
142.04s: Russell and that's mostly just following
144.60s: the movement at this point it's not that
147.08s: I'm fully sold and baked in on what this
149.92s: movement looks like because a big thing
151.80s: that's going to start getting factored
153.16s: into pricing soon is what we think about
155.72s: recession it's a little too early to
157.68s: worry too much about it yet but that is
159.44s: going to become increasingly topical
161.20s: last I saw from Goldman Sachs they had
163.40s: an article out that talked about like a
165.04s: 20% chance of recession which I argue
168.04s: still seems a little low to me not that
170.60s: I know better than them I just can't
172.24s: help but think that after everything
174.32s: that's gone on to think that it would be
176.28s: that low just seems not highly probable
179.48s: but again that's just based on
181.20s: essentially intuition so I wouldn't wait
182.92s: my opinion there too heavily so that's
185.68s: that now as I already mentioned we do
189.04s: have a big rate cut coming soon and when
192.92s: I say rate cut it's been priced in for
195.04s: some time now we've been looking at
197.00s: essentially 100% probability of a cut
199.68s: since this new um this expiration became
204.24s: the front expiration so on 18 STP is
207.28s: what we're looking at now you can see
208.68s: what bonds were pricing off of and
212.52s: here's the interesting point it used to
215.40s: be really high probability of 25 basis
218.12s: points now it's like 50/50 between 25
220.84s: and 50 basis points this turned a
223.92s: relatively not exciting event in my
226.44s: opinion into quite an exciting event the
229.32s: reason is because I felt the probability
232.16s: of a 25 basis point had been priced in
234.80s: for some time and we can see that
237.28s: because across the futures if we look at
240.68s: the bond Futures you can see that you
243.28s: know they've rallied but their volume
244.92s: has already started dying down it's not
247.40s: like the volume is pouring into bonds at
249.48s: this point it's really not so there's
253.20s: this really interesting phenomenon that
256.08s: we're seeing because I think most of
258.80s: this probability of a 25 basis point cut
261.08s: probably started getting priced in
262.36s: pretty heavily back here and we've been
265.52s: you know Meandering sideways here but
267.96s: the Revival of a 50 B basis point cut I
270.72s: actually think starts to make this look
272.56s: a little more interesting and the
275.44s: ability for that to have a little bit
277.12s: more of a market effect I think is
278.84s: pronounced but if we look across again
281.76s: 30-year bonds here for the last week
285.32s: essentially it's been running below both
287.32s: 5day and 20-day average volume if we
290.24s: take a look at something a little nearer
292.44s: term and we use 10 years you'll see the
295.24s: same exact thing it's been below volume
297.60s: most of the week and then if we go even
299.68s: CL are
300.64s: still look at the 2-year it's about the
303.16s: same still so bonds are being bought no
306.80s: doubt and I think most people have
308.88s: already captured most of this move this
310.72s: is again a reflection of the market as a
315.32s: discounting mechanism for those that are
317.96s: thinking like oh I want to get into
319.52s: bonds today because I think the Fed rate
321.16s: Cut's going to move prices literally
324.00s: like not even days late over a month or
326.64s: two late that already has happened again
329.04s: you can see that back here clear as day
331.16s: that's exactly what this is now it
332.76s: continues to drift up I'm not saying
334.16s: that this is the maximum of the move or
335.76s: at all that it can't continue it sure
337.40s: can but all I'm saying is that if you're
339.64s: arriving to that conclusion now you you
341.52s: are late to the party so that doesn't
344.32s: mean you can't play it but it just means
347.08s: you now have a higher risk trade because
349.52s: if for whatever reason the economy
350.92s: starts faltering it starts looking a
352.76s: little bit ugly to the down side then we
355.60s: don't really know exactly how bonds are
357.32s: going to behave there because the the
359.32s: bond Equity relationship had broke down
361.68s: pretty meaningfully throughout 2020
363.96s: until almost present it's just now just
366.04s: starting to normalize so I don't even
367.84s: think it's fair to say like oh yeah if
369.84s: you know it starts looking like
370.76s: recession bonds are going to look really
372.12s: good maybe I mean we might think that
374.88s: but we also have to understand the rest
376.76s: of the conditions that are around us
378.40s: because again correlations change over
380.60s: time and they did pretty massively so
382.96s: for people that used to run risk-on
384.84s: risk-off portfolios using equities bonds
387.12s: they were getting massacred over the
389.36s: last few years because the relationship
391.68s: broke so yeah that's kind of what I see
395.28s: going on with the bond market now the
397.56s: other thing I want to take a look at is
400.36s: the movement of capital between the
402.80s: sectors I find interesting so if we go
404.76s: to institutions and this is looking more
407.16s: at like value institutions I'll open
409.12s: this up a little bit so that you can see
411.88s: over here and there's a few things that
415.16s: jump out at me when I'm looking at this
417.28s: down here is when we look at where most
420.28s: of the exposure is again we can see
422.60s: technology is Contracting it continues
424.64s: to contract quarter over quarter so it
427.20s: hit its peak concentration like back in
429.68s: here which is around
432.44s: Q3 of 21 Q2 22 somewhere in that range
437.72s: and it's been contracting ever since uh
439.88s: that's a lie it did tick up here my bad
441.84s: I lied to you where where is this this
443.72s: is like yeah
446.12s: 2023 Q2 is but then it's been contra
449.52s: rting from there for real this time so
452.48s: this idea that like we're heavy Tech
454.64s: concentration I actually think is a
456.60s: little misguided at this point now it's
459.48s: important to also understand this is
461.24s: looking at when we're looking at sector
463.68s: exposure and people if we look at
466.36s: individual products we can absolutely
468.60s: see that we're still very very very
471.40s: heavy into Tech right so if we sort this
474.80s: by ads you can see birkshire is coming
478.04s: up really big Google
480.24s: um Aon MSC msci ACN Baba so it's like a
484.96s: a healthy mix of things and if we take a
488.00s: look at
490.60s: offloads or kind of the smallest ads
493.08s: it's been in energy which again that's
494.84s: no big surprise because if you take a
497.00s: look at Energy's composition in these
499.16s: portfolios it's been super super low for
501.92s: some time so what I'm noticing from an
504.68s: expanding standpoint is if you look at
506.56s: Industrials they're starting to open up
508.48s: a little bit you're seeing consumer
510.44s: defensive it opened up kind of started
512.44s: closing back down I don't think there's
514.08s: a lot there that interests me at the
515.72s: moment just from a flow perspective and
518.24s: then we absolutely see Financial
519.72s: Services opening up so in when I say
522.40s: opening up I mean consuming more of uh
525.60s: transactions and the percentages of
527.32s: portfolios so to recap all of that from
530.88s: what I see now I think the market has
533.08s: already largely priced in a 25 basis
535.36s: point cut if not a 50 basis point cut
537.24s: probability at this point I think if it
539.48s: it is a 50 basis point cut the market
541.28s: will probably move pretty heavy off of
543.20s: that because it'll still be relatively
544.88s: new news um that's not fully priced in
547.44s: yet cuz it's even still less than a 50%
549.48s: probability but if it keeps trending
551.24s: that way I think it becomes more
552.84s: probable so interesting Market Behavior
556.84s: this week and this is where again until
560.24s: the market decides if it's going to go
561.84s: left or go right this is exactly where I
564.40s: I like to trade these markets but you
566.28s: got to be really careful and I use
568.32s: really tight stops even this the stuff
570.20s: that I'm running in the NASDAQ I just
572.20s: follow it all the way up and for things
574.20s: that I typically would handle a previous
576.16s: retracement without batting an eyelash I
577.96s: would rather just get out watch and then
580.04s: go back in I haven't been knocked out
581.76s: yet but I have literally orders resting
583.96s: right now to to start dropping me out if
586.60s: need be all right so let's switch over
588.32s: to GameStop quick then for those that
590.44s: don't know later today at 5:00 p.m.
592.04s: Pacific time we have the outlier options
595.04s: trading for beginners series that's at
597.20s: 500 p.m. Pacific time and we dive into
599.56s: the world of options for beginnner so
601.44s: it's a chance to get your feet wet we've
603.16s: been doing I think this is going to be
604.32s: our 14th episode so we're going to have
605.84s: a quiz and it's really just designed to
608.28s: help people sharpen the sword get more
609.96s: familiar with options more comfortable
611.40s: with how they fit in the portfolio
612.88s: understanding the difference between
614.00s: things like profit mechanisms and how to
615.68s: capitalize on them with options because
618.20s: options get a bad rap but it's because
620.00s: people jump into them too fast is what
621.64s: it boils down to so going over to
623.92s: GameStop little bit of an update today
625.80s: that was absolutely awesome to see
627.28s: inside day 1.23 3% up but it's still
630.72s: hovering right above 20 so the fact that
634.48s: it's continuing to hold this is good to
636.36s: see and if we take a look at volume we
638.92s: can see that there was a spike of volume
641.72s: leading into earnings post earnings
644.44s: another Spike of volume and then if we
646.72s: take a look even at these last two days
648.92s: although these last two days seem
650.68s: insignificant compared to the prior 4
653.32s: these last two days are still much
654.88s: larger than a lot of what you saw in
656.96s: here right so today we had 8 million
660.04s: volume 92 million volume yesterday if we
662.32s: go back to a random sample during this
664.04s: period it's 4 1/2 3 and 1/2 so much much
668.40s: much less volume in here so there's
670.20s: still elevated volume and I think that
672.68s: that's an important note because it
676.08s: tells me that we're still supported here
678.40s: now whether it breaks down below this
680.04s: TBD don't know yet but I like the fact
683.60s: that it hasn't yet and I'm keeping a
686.12s: pretty close eye on that now let's jump
688.72s: over to the options chain and we have a
691.52s: few things to go over in here so today
694.12s: we had
695.04s: 172,000 calls against 49,000 puts so way
698.56s: more calls traded and again this looks
700.60s: like mostly moving out into the next
702.52s: expiration right so we can see a bunch
704.16s: of these 13 septembers these are almost
706.28s: assuredly trades that are coming down
708.72s: and these 20 steps are going to almost
711.44s: all be opening trades for people moving
713.36s: out into the next primary expiration
716.32s: open interest still hovering right
718.28s: around 73 30,000 calls against 361 on
722.04s: the put side and it's still a healthy
725.20s: mix of call open interest across
729.08s: different expirations I'm not seeing any
731.92s: sort of massive concentration here that
734.16s: leads me to believe that you know the
735.92s: market is pricing something in or the
738.04s: market thinks something in particular is
740.04s: going on I just don't get that sense at
743.12s: least as of right now so let's take a
745.88s: quick look
747.84s: now at any interesting trade volume that
752.24s: we've had come through I'm going to get
754.12s: rid of the puts for now I'm going to get
755.88s: rid
756.68s: of the bids for
759.08s: now and I'm going to limit it to just
762.04s: today to kind of clear out some of that
764.00s: noise we had a couple trades that looked
767.04s: interesting to me but so we have the um
770.96s: 18th of next month the 15 calls I
774.60s: thought those looked a little off place
777.92s: but not much it is a bigger trade
779.96s: 287,000 again that's not big by typical
782.92s: GameStop standards when things are like
784.64s: really busy but it's something I'm just
786.40s: looking at and then we have another
788.32s: $174,000 trade but this isn't out until
790.92s: 2025 so yeah you know future dated
793.72s: positioning totally fine but beyond that
795.84s: just pretty quiet in here not much to to
798.48s: highlight that looks really interesting
801.00s: to me or anything like that now I do
803.68s: want to take a look at the dark pool
805.12s: really fast and see what kind of
806.76s: transactions we had today and and if we
810.72s: take a look there's a bunch of those
811.84s: 5000s again so I'm going to do is sort
814.44s: this by size see if the 5000s are in
816.32s: here typically they're not because
818.12s: there's a bunch of much bigger
819.32s: transactions like these these are
820.84s: actually
822.04s: interesting well before I'm going to
824.48s: look at just today
829.04s: though and let's see so we have yep look
832.16s: at all these fives again this is like
835.72s: this has been non-stop the last few days
839.88s: so let's
842.64s: count so and there's a couple over here
846.04s: that are like different sizes right 5500
848.08s: but these what is
850.56s: this it's like over 30 maybe like 35 or
855.32s: so and then I see a couple High fours
861.32s: so
865.00s: interesting really interesting I don't
867.48s: know what to make of the fives the their
869.64s: activity has been ebbing and flowing so
872.04s: if we look at this over the last week
874.16s: for example I'm going to filter by just
876.32s: those 5,000 and again these are not
877.96s: options these are
880.88s: shares and now I'm going to sort it by
883.28s: date so that we can kind of see how it
885.32s: es and flows so you can see on the 12th
887.80s: was massive right absolutely massive
890.96s: number of transactions then on the 13th
893.96s: there's still again over 30 I would bet
897.16s: but not like an insane amount like the
900.04s: 12th then if we go to the 11th it's more
904.72s: than the 13th less than the 12th we go
907.84s: to the 10th it's less than both of those
909.96s: the ninth less still the
914.68s: sixth and we run out of um space at the
917.80s: bottom we run out of returns so it I
922.04s: just can't help but find it interesting
923.76s: I don't think that again I'm not
925.60s: suggesting that this is the same person
927.12s: trading here nobody has a monopoly on
928.68s: this side but I just can't help but find
930.68s: it so interesting so right now my main
934.24s: goal here is to just continue following
936.00s: these shares through the dark poool and
938.48s: I just want to see if there's a change
941.28s: in the number of 5,000 returns that's
943.52s: what I'm looking at right now is
945.04s: obviously that's what I see over the
946.72s: 12th to today and that's what I'm
948.76s: keeping an eye by on because the options
950.80s: change right now is quiet it is what it
952.32s: is is is exciting as I would prefer it
954.20s: to be right now it's quiet the stock
955.84s: price itself is quiet which again as we
959.08s: with GameStop it's quiet until it's not
961.64s: so that's all we got for today as always
963.48s: let me know if there's anything I should
964.76s: take a look at be an outlier I'll see
966.52s: you guys later
