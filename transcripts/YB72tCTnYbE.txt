0.00s:  What's up, we'll give everybody just a couple of seconds to make their way in and then we
13.08s:  will kick this bad Larry off.
17.04s:  I hope the week is wrapping up pretty well for everybody.
22.36s:  I think we had a really interesting trading week.
27.08s:  So excited to talk a little bit about that, but really the primary goal for today's
31.56s:  session is going to be talking about some, whoa, turn that off.
39.28s:  I'm right now.
40.28s:  I'm trying to stream to, let me see if this is working.
47.04s:  It doesn't look like it.
48.52s:  That's okay.
49.52s:  I was trying like this multi stream thing, but it looks like it is not doing what it's
55.92s:  supposed to do.
56.92s:  That's cool.
57.92s:  That's how it goes.
60.84s:  So let's see who we got.
61.84s:  It looks like we got Reese Lauren.
64.80s:  We got Liz chicken nugget chicken nuggets.
68.44s:  Always a fun name.
71.00s:  That Lauren says I already feel personally attacked with this title of the lie that's,
77.04s:  honestly, it's not that far off.
78.48s:  I actually think that would be that's a.
81.28s:  I don't know if we're going to necessarily pick on you specifically today, but you could
85.16s:  technically be a candidate.
86.96s:  I think that that's, that's completely fair.
89.64s:  I don't blame you.
91.44s:  Cool.
92.44s:  So let's, let's get this, let's get this thing going.
96.76s:  Now a couple of things that I do want to start with is, it is the end of the month.
103.88s:  So as I typically talk to people specifically in our community, now's like a perfect time
110.20s:  to start.
111.20s:  Well, not start.
112.20s:  And if you're just starting now, I have to be completely honest.
114.32s:  You're a little bit late, but now's a perfect time to go through the overall performance
120.96s:  for the last month.
121.96s:  A lot of people don't do this, which is actually super interesting to me, the fact that the
128.28s:  vast majority of people don't do that.
131.12s:  But now's the time.
132.36s:  If you haven't already done it to do it.
134.64s:  And what I try to do is at the end of each month, go through my performance a little bit
138.64s:  more in depth.
139.64s:  Actually, what we're going to start reviewing on the Sunday live stream is my performance,
145.84s:  how the month went where I sit for the year and specifically looking at plans into the
151.48s:  end of the year.
152.48s:  That's the entire idea.
153.60s:  So highly recommend that process.
157.68s:  Now before we get kicked off, I would love to hear you all specifically.
162.84s:  If there's anything in particular that you want to hone in on throughout the session,
166.56s:  I feel free to throw that into the chat.
169.28s:  But otherwise, literally my game plan was to spend a little time poking around Reddit
173.64s:  as one does and just see what we see there.
177.96s:  And I think every time I go through Reddit, it provides such a great conversation point.
183.52s:  And I think it's such a great learning tool, which I have to be honest.
186.60s:  It's a great learning tool more often than not about what not to do genuinely.
191.12s:  And that's not to throw shade at people on Reddit or any other place.
194.96s:  It's really not at all.
196.04s:  Just a way to learn from each other's mistakes.
198.92s:  And we do this kind of learning in the military all the time, especially as a marine officer,
204.40s:  when you go through your early on schools and stuff like that, you spend a lot of time
209.60s:  watching your peers get blasted.
212.64s:  And as one of your peers is getting blasted, you don't typically sit there and think like,
217.12s:  snickering at them, haha, haha, they fucked up because you know your time's coming too.
222.56s:  And it's just a matter of time before you're the one getting blasted.
225.88s:  So it's actually a really great communal learning environment where you realize everybody's
230.08s:  going to get fucked up.
231.68s:  And the best possible thing you could do is watch your friend get fucked up, see what
235.72s:  they're getting fucked up for, and then try to learn how not to get fucked up for that
240.12s:  thing.
241.12s:  And then you are going to be an example for somebody else at some point.
245.36s:  It's it's going to happen.
247.36s:  And but that kind of learning environment where we can healthily learn from each other's
252.84s:  mistakes is a rapid accelerator and taking it back to Reddit.
257.52s:  Reddit offers a lot of places where you're going to find novice traders.
262.24s:  The only reason why I post on Reddit is because I have a social media platform that's
271.76s:  completely centered around trading.
274.60s:  If I didn't have a social media presence a YouTube channel, the last possible place
279.00s:  that I would be with any sort of frequency, I would still post on a place like Reddit
283.08s:  because it's actually one of the first places that I started using when I was learning
288.80s:  about social media, like understand what people are looking at, how they think about
292.56s:  the markets.
293.56s:  But I wouldn't go to Reddit for information.
296.16s:  I can tell you that I would go to Reddit to try to help people intermittently at best.
301.48s:  But you're not going to find a lot of people that are like purposefully going to Reddit
306.00s:  to share quality information.
307.80s:  That is just the facts.
309.32s:  So if we look through what we expect to see, I would wager that we're going to see 98%
317.64s:  completely beginner posts.
319.88s:  And then the 2% of quality ad posts are going to be from people like me that have an incentive
328.12s:  to post to Reddit.
330.08s:  It's I mean, I work in plain sight, right?
334.00s:  The incentive for me to post to Reddit is twofold.
336.68s:  First is it allows me to do something that I derive marginal utility from, which is
343.20s:  I genuinely enjoy helping people.
345.12s:  So it allows me to do that.
347.16s:  And then it also helps my overall social media footprint.
351.28s:  So because of those kinds of things, I have a baked in incentive to interact there.
357.68s:  Most people don't.
359.16s:  Most people will lurk on Reddit.
361.00s:  And again, the only reason I'm spending time talking about this is because I'm trying
364.04s:  to prime the beginner options trader mind, right?
368.16s:  That's what the session is for.
369.68s:  Options trading for beginners.
372.52s:  And Reddit is not a great place to actually learn what to do.
379.72s:  It is an incredibly great place to learn what not to do.
385.96s:  And both of those have completely efficacious, inviable use cases for a trader.
392.84s:  So I think it is time for us to pop over and let's see what's in here.
400.08s:  This is hilarious literally for so this is from options.
404.36s:  And this is the very first post, which is hilarious.
408.88s:  Love that.
410.88s:  Actually, like legitimately kind of kind of hilarious.
415.72s:  I suppose we start here.
417.44s:  I mean, we click into this once you what's going on.
419.80s:  I lost 3K trading options for the first time.
423.48s:  Basically this was my first week trading options.
425.64s:  I was up 3K earlier this week and by the end of this week down to 3K.
429.08s:  3K is a lot of money to me and I feel like such an idiot.
431.76s:  I've never made irrational stupid decisions like this.
434.76s:  Now this is, I have to talk about this.
438.36s:  I can.
440.68s:  I don't want to be harsh to this person.
442.20s:  I don't know them.
443.20s:  I can literally guarantee them that this is not the only place they've made irrational
448.08s:  and stupid decisions.
449.68s:  This is why I spend so much time emphasizing and talking about the nuance of communication
456.32s:  and evaluation.
458.32s:  There is actually a member in the discord earlier today that I made a post.
463.36s:  I typically do an end of market on close, MOC post and ask people how things went.
469.88s:  Except for this one, I focused a little bit more on how did the month go because this
474.24s:  is a new month now.
476.56s:  And one of the conclusions that the person had was one of their strategies.
481.88s:  They were saying essentially don't trade this strategy because it doesn't work.
486.36s:  And I had to qualify and work with them on actually analyzing that statement because
492.56s:  it's not actually the strategy itself that didn't work because as they rightly pointed
498.04s:  out, there actually wasn't really a strategy built.
501.72s:  So this is a false attribution and it's a really, really big problem when you're trying
508.40s:  to objectively analyze things.
511.00s:  You cannot go down the path of false attributions because it leads you down the entire wrong path.
517.56s:  This is the same thing that I get pissed off when people say like you'll never go broke
521.68s:  taking profits.
522.68s:  It's a false attribution.
524.84s:  You can absolutely go broke taking profits.
527.96s:  So it's so important to break things down into their core concepts so that then you can
534.84s:  objectively analyze them.
536.36s:  Taking it back to this post, I can literally guarantee you this is a false attribution
541.40s:  from this person because guess what?
544.48s:  I know that I've made more than one irrational or stupid decision.
552.92s:  I've made more than one.
553.96s:  I've made fucking a lot more than one.
557.00s:  So for them to chalk this event up as if this is the one that they've made, it doesn't
565.48s:  make sense, right?
566.48s:  It's a false attribution.
567.96s:  This is going to send them down the wrong path thinking like oh, because again, what this
573.68s:  means to this person is that this is the anomaly, right?
578.40s:  Normally, I'm really rational.
580.84s:  I don't make any stupid decisions.
582.36s:  This is just an anomaly, right?
584.80s:  And by building it in their mind is just an anomaly, it's going to get a completely different
590.48s:  level of mental rigor in analysis.
593.36s:  So let's continue with the post.
596.56s:  I just have been seeing everybody else make money.
598.92s:  You've all seen this a million times.
600.84s:  So I'm not going to spend time on that.
602.72s:  And plus my relationship ending just sent me into a spiral.
605.84s:  And again, this is not to pick on this person at all.
608.96s:  It's not like I've made all of these kinds of errors.
611.76s:  I talk about these things not in the context of trolling somebody else for trying something
617.24s:  new and fucking up because I literally do that all the time.
621.72s:  I'm being very precise and I'm absolutely thoroughly evaluating what they're talking
627.76s:  about.
628.76s:  And I'm being honest.
629.76s:  It's one of the big things people, at least I feel like in my generation that we're starting
634.04s:  to lose is the ability to be honest with one another, right?
637.80s:  Because we can't hurt feelings.
639.48s:  Everybody's super soft.
640.88s:  And then you say something mean and then they go fucking cry about it or some shit.
645.56s:  That doesn't mean the inverse where you go be a dickhead to people just to be an asshole.
650.48s:  But that's the opposite of this.
652.16s:  This is me taking the time to use this person's scenario to teach other people.
656.52s:  Maybe they end up watching this video, which would be great.
658.72s:  I think that would be great for them, right?
660.76s:  So that they can get genuine, honest feedback from somebody that is designed to try to help
667.28s:  them get better, right?
669.16s:  So this tells me a massive problem.
672.52s:  How emotional are you as a person when you go through a breakup?
678.64s:  Some of the worst periods I've had in my life looking back have been during relationships.
683.84s:  They have fucked up the way that I think the way that I analyze.
687.16s:  They make me act out of character.
689.72s:  So to start something like trading options at the time when a relationship is ending, that's
700.12s:  not a great time to start picking up a skill set like this.
703.76s:  That's not to say don't keep learning to trade options.
706.80s:  That's completely okay.
708.40s:  Maybe not the time to go live with your money for the first time, right?
712.56s:  That's again, this is saying I've never made irrational stupid decisions like this.
716.64s:  This is another one right here.
718.68s:  So beyond whatever risk they were doing to have their account, that's irrational and not
724.20s:  super logical.
725.76s:  And then this here is a second irrational choice that I can see within two sentences.
732.36s:  After I lost my initial 3K that I was up on, I panicked and tried to get my money back.
736.84s:  This is super common and lost three more thousand rather than just being even.
741.32s:  I feel like such an idiot and I could have really used the money to buy necessary things
744.32s:  for medical school when I start next year.
746.88s:  So there's like everything about this genuinely is wrong.
753.12s:  And one of the problems that this person has again is I'm guessing they're not getting
758.44s:  any real good dose of genuine direct feedback on what they're doing.
766.20s:  Because I like honestly, I cannot see a good decision that's been made in this entire
772.36s:  thing at all.
774.72s:  And that's not to belittle and that's not to bear down on them.
778.32s:  It's just to let them know that like this whole thing ain't it?
782.32s:  All of this like this on fire, use it as an experience, like realistically speaking,
790.00s:  3K super cheap, super cheap learning experience.
793.84s:  You get that done out of the way.
795.68s:  But my guess is because of all the false attributions that are going on here, as they start to
801.84s:  scrape together more money, they're going to fuck it up again.
805.96s:  And I don't want them to again, I have to be so clear because when I say stuff like this,
810.36s:  people will naturally take the inverse of what I'm saying, right?
814.16s:  So when I say something like they're going to fuck it up again, people will infer that
817.00s:  I want them to the last possible thing I want to happen.
820.92s:  But this is the overwhelming probabilistic outcome for this person based on what I see
826.44s:  here.
827.72s:  So when we look at something like this, Wiggly warm is exactly on it, right?
833.56s:  Dude was tilted into press, lost, focused, due to break up.
836.88s:  That's 100% correct.
839.28s:  This is the last possible time to start trying to trade with real money, especially being,
843.52s:  I don't know how old this person is.
844.92s:  I can kind of tell that they're a little bit younger, not just from the medical school
849.28s:  start, but also from again, like what's going on here?
852.72s:  The way that they're presenting themselves is an immature person.
855.88s:  Again, that's not a dig.
857.20s:  This is just somebody that is still not going through the maturation process.
861.20s:  That's actually one of the most beautiful things about going through the military route,
865.36s:  and especially going through as an officer is you really do mature super fucking fast
870.60s:  because there's a lot of gravity placed on you at a super young age.
874.80s:  And it makes you think about things completely differently.
876.92s:  You're still very immature to be super clear, but you are quite more mature than most people
883.00s:  like this at this point in time.
885.24s:  Essentially, one of the reasons why when I was in college, when a lot of my friends were
889.56s:  kind of chilling, going out partying, I still did my fair share of that, but I had no
894.60s:  problem on Friday night spending literally eight hours after school ended, just digging
900.12s:  into learning about options.
901.28s:  I did that all the time.
902.68s:  I spent the bulk of my learning time as a percentage of available time during college,
907.68s:  learning about options.
910.72s:  And it's because I took this shit really seriously, but going back to this person, I think they
917.04s:  need to sit down and really spend the time to analyze what the fuck they're doing and
923.16s:  to be honest with themselves.
924.32s:  That's the biggest thing I see here is it is going to be so difficult to make a successful
928.40s:  run at this if we're not being very thorough with our self analysis and stuff like this.
936.20s:  This is like literally, it's a dismissive statement.
939.56s:  This is chalking up something bad that happened to an anomaly and it's a bad choice.
944.80s:  All right, I'm open to window.
954.20s:  Anything else you guys would add to this one?
955.56s:  Yo, what up Tommy?
956.56s:  Good to see you.
962.36s:  Lance says they need to not Google their name.
965.24s:  Interesting.
966.24s:  It makes me want to Google that, but I also am willing to take Lance at face value here.
971.68s:  I think it's fair.
976.28s:  Lauren says learning options feels like learning five languages at once.
979.60s:  It's a bit overwhelming, definitely.
981.32s:  It is.
982.80s:  Not only do you have to learn finance, not only like the most tricky part about learning
987.56s:  to trade options is without a doubt there's no structure for you.
996.00s:  There's a lot of shit you have to do.
998.12s:  Right.
999.12s:  There's a lot of shit you have to do right.
1001.00s:  And most people I wasn't ready either.
1004.48s:  In my late teens, early 20s, I was not at a point where I was ready to do the things that
1009.52s:  needed to happen.
1010.52s:  And if I look back through my performance, I can see it.
1013.60s:  I've been really fortunate and I've only had two negative years.
1016.56s:  My first two, both of them were less than 5% draw downs.
1021.00s:  That was due to pure luck.
1024.16s:  And the fact that because of my background, I grew up at the scarcity mindset.
1029.16s:  So I was terrified of losing money.
1031.36s:  Somebody like this obviously has a completely different background because if you grow
1035.44s:  up, I'm not like destitute poor, but like if you look up that like objectively, I was
1040.52s:  poor.
1041.52s:  I was like, if you grow up poor, this is not your activity.
1045.76s:  Like this is not the way this tends to go that early on.
1049.48s:  Because you're too scared to learn what you spent so much time trying to build and collect.
1053.88s:  So people that have my kind of background have a whole litany of other mental hurdles
1059.60s:  to get over, which is being too risk off.
1063.92s:  As compared to somebody like this, where they are too risk on, they're too comfortable
1068.88s:  throwing money out in something that they know nothing about, money that they know that
1072.68s:  they can't lose.
1073.68s:  And again, my guess is that they probably have a family that tends to bail them out.
1079.28s:  That's my guess because if you don't have that kind of structure, this kind of move is
1086.20s:  catastrophic.
1087.72s:  It genuinely is.
1089.40s:  So my guess is that they've had a support system that's been able to help them periodically.
1093.64s:  What I don't know, I'm guessing it's a lot of guessing, but I just inferring based
1098.56s:  on what presents here.
1100.04s:  So I think for them, they probably need to like this person.
1107.64s:  I would recommend full stop, stop trading, go to paper trading.
1113.36s:  That's the advice for most people.
1115.56s:  And I think that's most applicable here.
1118.24s:  All right.
1119.56s:  Let's see what else we got.
1122.68s:  Will options ever trade an extended hours?
1124.88s:  That's a good question.
1127.00s:  Crypto option income strategies.
1129.68s:  I kind of like that.
1131.48s:  Deep in the money calls.
1133.76s:  Do deep in the money calls get assigned if you write them?
1136.76s:  I was trading some box spreads and only short in the money put options got assigned.
1142.96s:  Yeah.
1143.96s:  So this is a good question.
1145.40s:  So the first thing here for Lord Timothy, that's a fantastic name is I don't know why we're
1152.00s:  trading box spreads and this kind of thing, right?
1155.72s:  You guys already know the approach to trading box spreads that I take, which is very different
1159.32s:  than this.
1160.32s:  And I think it should be done in stuff that European style options.
1164.92s:  That's cash settled.
1165.92s:  But there's no early exercise.
1167.56s:  But that being said, deep in the money calls, they absolutely can get assigned.
1173.56s:  And there's a specific scenario that tends to lead to that.
1177.48s:  And that's if there's a dividend coming up and the dividend is greater than the remaining
1183.88s:  extrinsic value of those options.
1186.32s:  That's the primary timeframe where that is a risk.
1189.52s:  Now it can happen at any point, any American style option can be exercised at any point,
1197.48s:  whether it's logical or not, right?
1199.64s:  Because there's going to be some people who are just fumble fucking the buttons and they're
1203.08s:  like, oh, let me try doing this.
1205.40s:  And they might accident.
1206.40s:  It's more difficult than that.
1207.48s:  I'm kind of being a little facetious here because you kind of have to message your broker.
1211.56s:  There's not like a button that says like exercise my option, but you can like they can message
1217.08s:  their broker be like, yo, I want to exercise this.
1218.96s:  The broker be like, yo, that doesn't make sense.
1220.44s:  So you sure you want to, yeah, fuck it, yolo.
1223.40s:  And then they do that.
1225.68s:  So it absolutely and then you could just happen to be paired with them.
1228.92s:  So that is absolutely a thing.
1230.56s:  Wilyworm says, can you show us how we might fumble fuck our buttons?
1235.60s:  Yeah.
1236.60s:  So that typically comes down to not using a tray checklist early on.
1240.32s:  Now again, in this case, I'm being a little bit facetious simply because for exercise,
1246.72s:  you would have to like fumble fuck typing an email to the, to your broker, asking them
1251.92s:  to exercise the options.
1253.16s:  And after they tell you, it doesn't make sense.
1254.64s:  You would have to fumble fuck a second email, right?
1256.72s:  So it's not really a great example that's super realistic to occur.
1260.76s:  But in terms of something like just not clicking well is if like we have examples of this
1267.52s:  through somebody in the discord not too long ago that was talking about a tray that
1270.28s:  they put on.
1271.28s:  They thought that they sold and they bought or vice versa.
1274.16s:  I forgot which order.
1275.52s:  We've all done that.
1276.52s:  Absolutely done.
1277.52s:  I did that not too long ago, not sold instead of buy.
1281.84s:  But the position that I traded was different than I thought it was.
1284.80s:  And it's because I was trading futures in bed at like 12 a.m. trying to put on a position
1290.24s:  in corn.
1291.56s:  And I had the, I didn't put on the exact position that I wanted.
1295.32s:  It was slightly missized.
1297.80s:  And like I haven't made a dumb mistake like that in a long fucking time.
1302.76s:  But that shit happens, man.
1304.64s:  It happens.
1306.04s:  So we've all literally been there before.
1309.80s:  Now Wigglyworm says trade checklist is a new term for me.
1314.00s:  Wigglyworm, don't tell me that you hate my shit like that.
1318.96s:  That's unbelievable.
1323.44s:  Here is Wigglyworm.
1326.44s:  There you go.
1327.72s:  That is a video called simple options trade checklist.
1333.12s:  It's something that I think new traders should do.
1335.56s:  And it's not something that you have to do forever.
1337.72s:  It's something that you kind of tolerate for a while.
1341.00s:  It's like the thing if you, if you're a fighter, right?
1343.00s:  If you do any sort of striking martial art, you will, at least for me, you, I have a tendency
1350.12s:  to have my head too high.
1352.36s:  So we do the game of a lacrosse ball under the chin and the reason why it's a lacrosse
1357.76s:  ball is because it's kind of heavy.
1359.40s:  Even if you take up any bit of pressure, it will fall and then typically you're punished
1363.80s:  for being undisciplined, a disgusting, undisciplined human being.
1368.48s:  So that is a guard rail that's put into place across ball to make sure that you're not being
1375.84s:  laxed as a goal and then just have your channel a little too high and get knocked the fuck
1379.60s:  out.
1380.68s:  So it's, that's the purpose of a trade checklist.
1383.60s:  I don't, I don't have a lacrosse ball when I spar anymore, right?
1388.40s:  It doesn't need to be there because I've learned the lesson.
1391.28s:  So it's in gray now.
1392.28s:  It's muscle memory.
1393.28s:  I'm, I'm pretty good.
1394.96s:  So it's the same thing with the trade checklist.
1397.80s:  The ability, and this is why I like paper trading so much because the ability to make lots
1402.20s:  of dumb mistakes is very high for a new trader and it is instantaneous.
1409.08s:  It happens super quick.
1411.00s:  So a trade checklist is literally designed to slow you down.
1415.64s:  That's the biggest thing is to slow you down and to make sure that you're looking at
1420.28s:  all the requisite details that are important to what you're doing before you enter a trade.
1428.16s:  So that we really decrease the frequency that we're making dumb mistakes.
1434.68s:  Pain retains.
1435.68s:  It's a thing.
1436.68s:  The problem is is in trading, the pain is your money and the problem with that is your
1442.32s:  money typically takes a non-linear amount of time to build to what you'll lose it in.
1449.40s:  Meaning you might work for two weeks to come up with your $500 of savings and you can
1453.84s:  blow that literally in 30 seconds.
1456.48s:  The non-linear relationship makes it really, really difficult to come up with the next
1461.08s:  $500 over the next two weeks and then to learn again that way.
1465.12s:  It is simply not viable.
1467.80s:  It's not viable at all.
1469.80s:  So for most people a trade checklist to me is especially for the first six months of
1478.76s:  trading, there's no reason not to do it.
1482.52s:  I'm honed.
1483.52s:  It says, how do you recover from big losses?
1485.36s:  I had a big loss two years ago and my trading confidence is still FME over.
1489.48s:  Okay.
1490.48s:  So for I'm honed, how has your performance been since you've had those big trading losses?
1497.84s:  So meaning if you look back over the last two years, what is your performance been?
1503.24s:  My guess is going to be your performance probably has not been super great.
1508.76s:  And I'm just guessing because if your performance has been good, normally you would have a different
1515.32s:  response than that.
1517.96s:  So yeah, help me understand that and then we'll talk a little bit about it.
1528.84s:  Chris, I think it's Chris.
1532.12s:  Chris.
1533.12s:  Chris, Chris, Tom, Chris, Tom.
1537.56s:  Funny story actually.
1538.56s:  I was face timing with my buddy for a while.
1543.04s:  Earlier today he's literally my best friend.
1545.64s:  I met him in high school and he and I have a very small friend group and he's been literally
1551.04s:  a lifelong friend.
1552.28s:  Very different people, which is funny, but we have a lot of similarities.
1555.36s:  So his Christ's name reminded me of him because he's going to a Halloween.
1560.48s:  He's in New York.
1561.48s:  He's going to a Halloween party tonight and he's being Jesus Christ.
1565.92s:  So we literally spent like 40 minutes talking about all the different things he can do
1570.88s:  to up his Jesus Christ costume.
1574.00s:  He actually bought $20 of like Eucharist.
1577.96s:  You get a thousand of them.
1579.40s:  He bought $20 worth of Eucharist off of Amazon.
1582.68s:  So he is like the perfect ensemble.
1585.16s:  I'm very, very excited for the for the get up that he manufactured.
1590.52s:  But we're going to have to iterate on it.
1592.64s:  On it.
1593.64s:  You're over here.
1594.64s:  That's the game plan.
1595.64s:  But Chris says I've got my account to only be able to write covered calls and buy to
1600.40s:  close.
1601.40s:  I don't even want the temptation to buy options.
1605.72s:  Honestly, if that's a thing like again, like if you don't think you have the discipline
1609.68s:  that if they give you the ability to buy options that you wouldn't, if you didn't want
1613.92s:  to buy options that like you would be possessed and compelled to do so.
1617.76s:  Like, that's a fucking problem.
1619.76s:  That's a giant discipline problem.
1621.48s:  And again, my guess is that that will absolutely come out in a lot of different places.
1628.44s:  It's not going to be relegated to the way that you write options.
1631.60s:  So I'll be super careful about that, to be honest, that that doesn't sound right to
1635.88s:  me.
1636.88s:  I'm home says I've been too scared to be risky and feel like I can't be good.
1644.00s:  Performance has not been good, but I also feel like I'm climbing up a hill.
1646.40s:  Yeah, I mean, you're definitely going to be climbing up a hill as a trader.
1648.72s:  That's the name of the game.
1649.72s:  So yeah, get used to the slope.
1652.20s:  But you're, there's a lot there.
1658.40s:  Like there's a lot there that I would actually want to unpack because so for example, I'm
1664.52s:  at home, like I can see self limiting beliefs, right?
1667.32s:  The I can't be good.
1668.96s:  And then using even speaking like that will bring it into existence to a degree.
1673.72s:  An example of that is I used to say all the time, I'm not good at math, not good at math.
1678.88s:  Even as I say it right now, it feels fucking cringey when I say it.
1681.56s:  Like I don't like it.
1682.80s:  And it's because I've taught myself not to say that.
1686.00s:  And it's because math didn't come easy to me.
1688.96s:  And I didn't have somebody to really help me with it.
1692.16s:  But it I'd like just decided one day to stop saying it.
1697.52s:  I literally just this was an I want to say seventh grade that I decided to just stop saying
1702.80s:  I'm bad at math.
1704.72s:  Sure as fucking shit.
1708.08s:  I stopped being real bad at math.
1710.92s:  Polarious.
1712.20s:  So anyways, I can see some of that going on in your language.
1716.88s:  And then I can also see a lot of the a lot of this self attribution, like just wrongful
1723.48s:  attribution going on there, right?
1726.36s:  Because the performance not being good doesn't have to do with being risky, right?
1732.36s:  You can have good performance and not be risky.
1735.48s:  My guess is that you don't have clearly defined performance metrics.
1740.04s:  My guess is that you don't have a clearly defined trading plan and a trading log to support
1747.28s:  your goal, right?
1748.68s:  Your path towards those trading metrics.
1751.56s:  So I'm honed.
1753.56s:  I bring that up simply because I just I think that you don't have the foundation based on
1758.32s:  what you're saying here.
1759.32s:  So your sensation doesn't surprise me.
1762.24s:  I would feel the same in that scenario.
1765.24s:  So for something like that coming back from a loss, absolutely is it's entirely possible.
1771.40s:  I had like over 30% drawdown on my account on one single trade.
1776.48s:  And this is when the account wasn't that big.
1779.32s:  So I just and this was a several years into trading.
1782.68s:  I've been trading for like five years at the point, something like that.
1786.12s:  And the the trick there was it absolutely wasn't easy to get over that, but it's entirely
1794.00s:  possible.
1795.64s:  A big part of that was taking the time to start building confidence again.
1801.28s:  But the way that I'm able to build confidence is by having a written trading plan that
1805.80s:  I trust because it's built on research that I've done.
1809.32s:  And then a trade log to then validate what I'm doing.
1812.04s:  I size trades way down so that I'm losing tiny amount of money while I start getting
1818.58s:  a feel for things again and then slowly start scaling back up.
1824.04s:  That's kind of the general process.
1826.40s:  And because like if you have a big loss that also says that we're over sized right,
1833.76s:  we're trading too large.
1835.56s:  And if I were to take a gander or what's going on there, I guess that you were too focused
1841.16s:  on what you could stand to making the trade and you didn't spend enough time analyzing
1845.16s:  the potential downside to the trade, meaning the bad path of the trade doesn't do what you
1849.24s:  want.
1850.24s:  Another very common thing that we've all done before.
1852.68s:  So it's a lot of feedback based on a couple of sentences from you in the chat.
1858.16s:  But I hope some of that at least connects in helps think, help you think about the way
1864.36s:  to frame it going forward.
1866.92s:  But again, the solution in my mind for somebody like you genuinely is it's simple, right?
1872.76s:  People again, a lot of trading is very simple that doesn't make it easy.
1879.52s:  So in the instance for that person, I think the game for them is going to be to again,
1884.40s:  stop trading, live money to then put that capital into some sort of buy and hold index ETF,
1892.56s:  whatever they're comfortable with, like that's fine.
1895.52s:  And to switch over to paper trading, the work on the trading plan to work on the trading
1899.68s:  log to get the trading fundamentals done.
1902.80s:  Everybody wants to blow completely past.
1907.80s:  They want to blow completely past the process of building the skill set to be a trader.
1914.48s:  But people just want to jump to the end point of being a trader.
1918.20s:  They want to go directly to I want to be a successful trader.
1921.60s:  There's a lot of fucking work that has to happen in order to go into it.
1925.00s:  And like thankfully, the reason why I'm thankful for that is because that's what provides
1929.32s:  the opportunity. If there was a low barrier to entry, the opportunity would essentially
1935.12s:  be priced out, but it's not.
1937.60s:  So you should also be thankful that trading is difficult because if it weren't, the opportunity
1943.96s:  wouldn't be there to the scale that it is.
1951.68s:  Chris says I don't have the technical skills to evaluate stocks at this point to feel comfortable
1957.00s:  taking on the risk and seeing so many worse stories of people losing everything.
1960.44s:  Reddit has plenty of these stories.
1962.00s:  Sure.
1963.48s:  And that's the, that's the other scenario that you have to be aware of is the comparison
1974.32s:  group, right?
1975.64s:  One of the reasons why we look through Reddit is because as I mentioned before, it genuinely
1980.00s:  is a good place to look at how not to do things.
1984.16s:  That's because that's what happens with Reddit doesn't mean that that's what happens to
1991.04s:  everybody.
1992.80s:  Reddit is naturally, like if you think of it in terms of a sample and a population, right?
1998.40s:  You guys know that I, I love me some statistics.
2002.80s:  So Reddit is a little misleading in that sense to a lot of people and I'll explain to you
2009.68s:  why because when we look at something like Reddit, we have this scenario, oh, I think,
2021.44s:  hold on, where is it?
2023.44s:  One of these is, there it goes.
2024.80s:  I can't see anything when I do that though.
2026.84s:  That's kind of a problem.
2029.72s:  So let's go here.
2033.68s:  Do I have anything in this?
2038.52s:  I need to find like a blank, a blank spot.
2047.72s:  Maybe, oh, maybe if we do like spread hacker, perfect.
2052.44s:  We got a blank spot.
2053.96s:  It's exactly what we need in our life.
2056.96s:  Okay.
2057.96s:  And now we need to change this back to yellow.
2060.68s:  So let's talk about what Reddit shows us.
2063.88s:  We have a total population of retail traders.
2075.88s:  Of this population, there's a much bigger subset of retail investors.
2087.08s:  So retail traders are a small subset of retail investors.
2093.08s:  Of retail traders, you'll have people that are all over the place.
2098.12s:  Reddit will show you this.
2104.72s:  Reddit is showing you this tiny subset and the rest of the retail trader population is
2111.76s:  out here.
2114.52s:  So what I'm trying to help you visualize here is it is completely okay to go to Reddit,
2120.28s:  to produce the Reddit, to learn from Reddit.
2122.44s:  You have to be very thoughtful about what you're reading.
2124.80s:  Here's a great example, a perfect example.
2127.72s:  When I started having the herniated disk stuff and I had like agonizing sciatic pain,
2133.92s:  all this kind of bullshit.
2135.20s:  So I was doing a ton of searching to try to learn about what the fuck is going on with
2139.36s:  me and what does this look like?
2141.00s:  There is literally a subreddit for sciatica and I have to, I'll show you because I think
2149.92s:  it's worth the example.
2154.44s:  You'll see exactly what I mean.
2164.12s:  So what do you think I'm going to find today if we scope, if we think about the people
2186.60s:  that are going to be on the sciatica subreddit?
2190.00s:  Who's going to be here?
2191.72s:  And again, this ties back to trading.
2194.04s:  It'll make sense.
2195.04s:  I think this example will help you.
2197.20s:  The people that are going to be on this are the people that have persistent problems and
2204.28s:  you're going to find people that are disrupted enough to seek advice and counsel from an
2212.28s:  online community.
2214.16s:  This goes all the way back to understanding incentives and this goes back to understanding
2219.80s:  the sample that you are interacting with.
2223.64s:  This skill set is not relegated to just your success as a trader.
2228.44s:  This is literally a life skill set to be able to look at a sample that you're interacting
2234.72s:  with and understand that sample's archetype.
2238.20s:  Their background, what their leanings are going to be because all of that is going to skew
2243.84s:  the majority of what you see one way or another.
2249.12s:  So as I'm reading through this subreddit, I'm sitting there.
2252.96s:  The first thoughts I have is like, fuck, I'm fucked forever.
2256.72s:  There's people in here that have all sorts of problems like this, aching chronic pain.
2261.48s:  They have all these kinds of issues.
2263.32s:  They have a, hey, L5S1, that's actually not that bad.
2266.92s:  That's a pretty big bulge or herniation, but it's not terrible.
2272.56s:  It's just like, tons and tons of issues with people that again are struggling with
2280.00s:  sciatica, which I understand.
2283.56s:  However, that being said, as I'm reading through this and I'm thinking to myself, I'm fucked.
2292.20s:  This is terrible.
2293.64s:  All of these people have all of these problems, but guess what?
2297.12s:  There's 39,000 members, 35 online.
2301.36s:  This is a small, small, small subset of people.
2306.68s:  Then I also have to layer on the fact that there's going to be a physiological difference between
2313.12s:  me and most of these people.
2315.76s:  That's not to say that I'm some sort of physical specimen, I'm not, but I'm in decent shape.
2320.48s:  I'm decently active.
2322.04s:  And I take shit like this really fucking seriously.
2325.48s:  So I spend all the time reading all these different research papers, understanding what
2328.96s:  recovery methods work while yada yada yada, all this bullshit.
2332.60s:  So what I'm emphasizing is that the sample that I'm looking at is going to have a specific
2338.68s:  archetype.
2340.00s:  I do not fit the archetype for this sample.
2343.52s:  That doesn't mean I can't derive value from this sample, but it means that I have to
2347.84s:  be very cognitive of the propensity as I'm scrolling through the very many posts that are
2354.60s:  in here to not allow my brain to think that this is the reality for everybody.
2363.24s:  It's not.
2364.56s:  And it's easy to happen.
2366.04s:  It happens all the time, meaning when you read through this stuff and it's like shit,
2371.40s:  this is like really bad, this is terrible.
2375.32s:  And you read through tons and tons of posts like that.
2378.64s:  And then you start to think that that's representative of the landscape, it is not.
2384.16s:  So let's what's going on with the sciatical bullshit.
2386.76s:  So that same exact thing applies when you're interacting with any, any community.
2394.40s:  You have to understand the archetype of the sample that you're interacting with so
2399.92s:  that you can use that information to temper and modulate the way that you receive data
2406.84s:  and knowledge from that group.
2409.64s:  That's the case.
2411.44s:  So there's a lot of great information that you can find from places like Reddit and
2416.56s:  whatnot, but it is so important to take the time to understand what you're looking at.
2422.00s:  So that takes us back to our example here.
2425.48s:  When we're visualizing the option subreddit of retail traders of retail investors, it
2433.16s:  is a tiny, tiny sliver of the total population.
2437.24s:  And you have to remember the incentive structure in the background behind the people that
2441.96s:  are there because otherwise it's so easy to false represent what the broad picture looks like.
2459.32s:  Wiggle here.
2460.32s:  Wiggle.
2461.08s:  Worm says also those who found the miracle curious from switching to vegan mayonnaise.
2469.08s:  That's hilarious.
2472.08s:  Well, it's actually funny because I was seeing a physical therapist in the beginning and
2480.48s:  one of the things that they were telling me is like, oh, you know, you should avoid anti-inflammatory
2485.04s:  foods.
2487.60s:  Like they started listing out the different foods that they feel are anti-inflammatory.
2492.56s:  And I'm a milk drinker.
2493.56s:  I like milk.
2494.56s:  And they were like, you know, you should avoid dairy.
2497.68s:  I was like, well, I drink whole milk.
2499.36s:  I drink like two gallons, three gallons every single week.
2502.76s:  I have like my entire life.
2505.20s:  And they were like, oh, yeah, you probably shouldn't, you know, you should avoid that.
2510.04s:  And I'm sitting there thinking like their point isn't moot.
2514.88s:  I understand they're common about, you know, avoiding inflammatory foods.
2520.88s:  That makes sense.
2522.44s:  But I also am logical enough to realize that there's no amount of not inflammatory foods
2533.44s:  that are going to fix the fucking herniation in my back.
2539.40s:  It's there.
2541.96s:  It's physical.
2543.56s:  There's a physical interaction between the herniation and the nerves.
2548.24s:  Me not drinking milk is not going to fucking fix that.
2551.32s:  This goes back to another process that's very important.
2554.16s:  And this is something you learn in the military very early on, which is solve the problems
2558.68s:  that need to be solved.
2560.32s:  Meaning you can't spend your time trying to optimize every tiny little piece of thing
2565.24s:  that you're doing for this one specific thing.
2568.28s:  It's to her point she might view milk as inflammatory, but milk has a ton of great qualities
2575.12s:  about it.
2576.52s:  And that helps my overall nutritional picture pretty massively.
2581.08s:  So I'm not going to over solve and optimize for the herniated disk because there are
2588.56s:  bigger, much bigger inputs that will move the needle much more than me not drinking milk.
2596.72s:  Right?
2597.84s:  Understanding where different problem sets fit into the conversation is really, really important.
2606.20s:  And again, this goes directly back to trading.
2610.76s:  How does it go back to trading?
2611.96s:  You might ask.
2612.96s:  That's a great question.
2613.96s:  I will show you.
2616.12s:  So one of the most common things that I work on, that Lauren says, milk saying makes
2624.60s:  some people gassy.
2625.60s:  I think it makes people gassy that aren't used to drinking milk because I went through
2630.04s:  a period where I didn't drink milk.
2632.68s:  And when I started drinking it again, it literally gave me diarrhea for a couple days.
2637.12s:  So I was like, oh shit, maybe I shouldn't drink milk anymore.
2640.24s:  But all I did was slow down how much drink, how much milk I was drinking because I went
2644.80s:  right back to what I typically drink.
2647.12s:  And it's your body getting accustomed to something that's slightly different again.
2651.68s:  People will view that as like a negative attribution of milk or something like that.
2657.16s:  But your body gets very used to the rhythm of what you give it.
2660.60s:  And when you give it, this is why there's like travelers diarrhea or travelers constipation
2665.60s:  depending on your body and how it behaves, it you'll get one or the other.
2669.92s:  And it's because your body is getting a completely different series of things that it's
2673.92s:  not used to.
2675.32s:  So a lot of people will experience that to a degree.
2677.72s:  Even though there's nothing inherently wrong with the food, the water is okay.
2680.88s:  There's not a bunch of fucking parasites in there that are fucking you up.
2683.56s:  It's literally just different.
2685.28s:  So I think for a lot of people, that's for me at least, that was the case with milk.
2690.24s:  Is I literally, I was like, oh, fuck, is this lactose intolerant thing like actually a thing?
2695.00s:  Because I always thought, you know, joking aside, my mom, she says she is and stuff.
2701.04s:  But I like, I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it's not.
2703.52s:  But all I did was start, I just started drinking a little bit of milk and just scaled back
2710.28s:  up and then I was completely okay.
2712.36s:  But going back to this option trading thing and something that I talk a lot about with
2719.32s:  people specifically in the mentoring program because you have to understand the people that
2723.56s:  join that program are people that are like really, really interested in figuring this
2728.32s:  thing out.
2729.44s:  And they are very serious about it, right?
2732.16s:  I offer that context because the people that are in there, they're not like the casuals.
2736.36s:  They're not the people that are like, oh, I just want to see if I can make a hundred
2739.28s:  bucks.
2740.28s:  These are the people that are like, I want to be able to use this either for my primary
2744.24s:  income or to supplement my primary income.
2746.84s:  Like, I literally, like, this is important to me.
2750.36s:  So I bring that context because it's going to show a difference in, again, I'm giving
2754.92s:  you the sample in the archetype of the sample because it should influence the way that you
2760.20s:  receive the information about it.
2762.64s:  So in that space, I'll have people that trade all sorts of stuff, people that have, I
2768.00s:  literally have people that have traded for over 30 years.
2770.64s:  And I have people that have traded for two months, right?
2773.08s:  Big, big, barrage of people, lots of different approaches doing different things, trying different
2777.16s:  stuff.
2778.40s:  The very first thing that I spend working on with the overwhelming majority of them is if
2786.84s:  we think about the world of trading and you already know the outlier strategy process
2792.72s:  in the outlier trading process because we've talked about these before.
2796.84s:  But if we think about the majority of your performance, it's going to come from this
2801.32s:  bucket here.
2803.16s:  And then there's a slightly smaller bucket below it that's going to contribute some
2808.68s:  performance.
2810.16s:  And then there's another bucket below that that supports the broader performance and so
2816.00s:  on and so forth.
2818.40s:  But the very first thing that traders have objectively have to get right, profit mechanisms
2835.68s:  without an understanding of a profit mechanism.
2841.88s:  There's nothing else to be done as a trader.
2844.92s:  There's literally nothing else to be done.
2847.36s:  There's no amount of risk management that's going to help you.
2850.68s:  There's no amount of technical analysis that's going to help you.
2854.16s:  There's no amount of option structure analysis that's going to help you.
2858.40s:  There's no amount of Greeks that is going to help you.
2862.48s:  That is the first thing.
2863.84s:  Unequivocally, that is the first thing for every single trader on planet Earth no matter
2867.40s:  what.
2868.40s:  That is the first thing.
2870.68s:  But the overwhelming majority of traders skip right past this process and they start
2877.32s:  thinking about do I want to do verticals or diagonals?
2884.80s:  Huh, we're solving the wrong fucking problem.
2890.44s:  This is not your problem.
2893.00s:  This is not even a concern yet.
2896.44s:  First things first, we have to solve the problems that matter in the order that they matter.
2904.80s:  This is the first problem for every single trader that has ever lived.
2912.08s:  That is the first fucking problem.
2915.24s:  Without an understanding of that, there is nothing else to be done.
2920.84s:  This goes back all the way circling back to the point that we were talking about, which
2926.48s:  was the fact that it's so easy as a trader to start trying to solve lots of different things
2933.36s:  and optimize for lots of different things.
2936.24s:  But you have to stay organized and you have to work through the order of operations that
2940.36s:  make that's applicable to the world of trading.
2944.08s:  It's not this haphazard thing.
2946.16s:  It is this first always no matter what full stop period.
2950.80s:  And again, that's to the chagrin of a lot of people that join the mentoring program.
2955.56s:  They hate that.
2956.56s:  They hate the fact that the first thing I tell the majority of them is we're not even
2960.20s:  to fucking talk about options yet.
2962.44s:  Because there's no conversation for me to have with you until you can clearly articulate
2967.40s:  the profit mechanisms that you understand that you can qualify, quantify, you understand
2972.20s:  the types.
2973.76s:  Once those two steps are done, sure.
2975.96s:  I would love, literally love, I love options.
2978.80s:  I would love to talk about options.
2981.44s:  But before that point, there's no fucking conversation.
2985.80s:  It literally doesn't make sense.
2991.20s:  So it's something else to keep in mind.
2993.16s:  That's one of the things that you'll find the majority of people on a place like this
2998.08s:  that they do is they're so worried about all of these trivial details that don't really
3005.36s:  apply to them yet.
3006.56s:  It doesn't really matter just yet unless we can have an honest conversation that's logical
3014.52s:  about profit mechanisms, the type of profit mechanisms, which includes the qualities
3020.16s:  and then signals that are associated with it.
3024.12s:  So off point and says all that talk of Derry made me fix myself a 50 50 float half vanilla
3031.24s:  ice cream and half orange juice stand efforting in case any of you guys are familiar with
3035.04s:  them.
3036.04s:  He doesn't orange juice with I want to say like Greek yogurt, which is essentially the
3040.00s:  same thing as that.
3041.00s:  It's like orange cream sickle.
3043.28s:  I think his is a little bit more macro dense, but yeah, I've never done that, but I've
3050.24s:  heard of people doing that before.
3052.80s:  It wouldn't be my go to personally, but let's look at the next one.
3058.48s:  Does Delta neutral mean you need to day trade?
3063.40s:  Delta doesn't delta change with every tick.
3066.20s:  How do you make it neutral by shorting longing the underlying yet with another option?
3070.32s:  Huh?
3072.28s:  I assume it's easier with the spread since they're both moving.
3076.12s:  Oh, wow.
3077.12s:  Okay, so this is lots of problems.
3079.12s:  What do you guys think here?
3081.92s:  How would you answer this?
3084.92s:  Because the first thing I see here is this person completely misunderstands Delta hedging.
3093.24s:  So this is from how much and the first thing is does it mean you need to day trade,
3100.16s:  meaning trade every single day, sort of.
3103.60s:  You have to be prepared to trade every day.
3106.36s:  It doesn't mean that you have to sit in front of a screen and monitor everything, right?
3114.44s:  Because the way that Delta hedging works is, well, depending on what you're trying to do,
3119.36s:  I'm actually thinking that they might be thinking gamma hedging, but what they might be
3124.36s:  doing is flattening out their gammas and then Delta hedging off the residual as it moves
3129.48s:  around and then maintaining through Delta hedging.
3133.40s:  And the first thing that you have to understand with that kind of process is that the more you
3137.20s:  do it, the more expensive it gets.
3139.52s:  So most of us that will Delta hedge around something, we set up bands, bands to make our
3144.60s:  dance.
3145.60s:  I'm just kidding.
3146.60s:  They set up bands so that we're not unnecessarily Delta hedging every fucking tick.
3153.80s:  It's just unrealistic and it's also very expensive.
3157.52s:  So doesn't mean you need to day trade not inherently, but it does mean you need to be
3161.92s:  prepared to because if your Delta bands get out of whack, you do have to intervene.
3168.16s:  Otherwise your underlying approach is going to completely decouple.
3172.88s:  And it's unforgiving because as your Delta is interact with gamma gain more Delta, it
3179.20s:  goes faster and faster.
3181.04s:  So that's why you have to absolutely, you have to maintain a band.
3187.48s:  Now there are other component about Delta hedging with other options.
3191.12s:  Most won't do that.
3192.12s:  You can.
3193.12s:  There's no rules against it.
3194.64s:  But by Delta hedging with another derivative, which is going to move because it's going
3198.76s:  to have gamma, most was use the underlying to Delta hedge because it's a Delta one security,
3204.36s:  it's a Delta one product.
3206.16s:  So if I'm trying to scrub off Delta's, I'm not going to use more often than not unless
3211.08s:  I need it for another reason, an additional option.
3214.44s:  I'm just going to use the underlying buy or short it so that I scrub off the Delta's
3219.32s:  with the Delta one product.
3220.96s:  And then I just modulate the Delta bands based on the thesis.
3227.92s:  So I like this question, but they need to learn a lot more about Delta hedging in my opinion
3234.08s:  in order for this to even be viable.
3236.72s:  For the vast majority of retail traders sitting there trying to Delta hedges not the way
3239.76s:  to go.
3240.76s:  This is one of the most common misconceptions that I ever come across in trading where retail
3247.80s:  traders believe that the best way for them to create success for themselves is to emulate
3256.28s:  institutional trading.
3259.20s:  It is completely wrong.
3263.04s:  It is completely wrong.
3265.56s:  What is the same thing as saying I am going to emulate the Kenbe Mutumbos basketball
3275.68s:  style to be a successful basketball player.
3280.08s:  That's my game plan.
3281.88s:  Do you understand the parallel I'm drawing here?
3286.24s:  It's completely, completely wrong.
3290.76s:  The reason why it's completely wrong is the Kenbe Mutumbos is a certain height.
3296.48s:  His certain attributes that I do not have.
3299.88s:  Now your boy does have hops.
3301.52s:  I can jump, but I'm still not that tall.
3304.92s:  Not as tall as him.
3306.12s:  So there's no way that I could emulate his style without some sort of adaptation for
3311.68s:  myself and be successful.
3314.72s:  So, the real trading and institutional trading are completely different fucking things.
3322.40s:  And it is a gross misconception for retail traders to think the way that they're going
3328.08s:  to make money at this is to emulate what institutions are doing.
3332.56s:  They're playing an entirely different game than you.
3336.16s:  So most people that come across this idea of being Delta neutral is coming from stuff
3340.96s:  that is trickled out from institutions that doesn't actually fully apply to us here,
3346.60s:  unfortunately.
3347.60s:  And you have to be aware of that.
3349.52s:  Because again, if you're going to be a successful trader and you spend a bunch of your time trying
3354.84s:  to emulate something that actually doesn't make any sense to emulate, it's very difficult
3361.96s:  to make money like that.
3364.16s:  Joey says same thing as copying Pelosi.
3366.60s:  That I disagree with.
3367.60s:  If all of us should stop everything we're doing and just do what Pelosi does because she
3372.40s:  apparently has got it down right and she has hundreds of millions of dollars from being
3376.92s:  just a great trader.
3379.08s:  And I regret my life choices because that's what I should have been doing this whole
3384.88s:  time.
3385.88s:  I've been sitting here worrying about building different kinds of models and spending thousands
3389.80s:  of hours looking at different charts and coming up with different strategies.
3393.60s:  And meanwhile, all I had to do is copy Nancy Pelosi, a giant mistake.
3401.08s:  It's, you know, we learn from our mistakes though.
3402.80s:  So I hope I'll be a better man for this maybe.
3407.96s:  Hard to say.
3410.44s:  Lance says, Lance says it helps being able to inside trade.
3414.20s:  Oh, yeah.
3415.20s:  I mean, that's the trick of the trade here, right?
3417.36s:  It's just just deal in a place that gets more access to information and influence policy
3423.68s:  than regular people and then make trades based off those things, right?
3427.84s:  It's simple, super simple.
3429.84s:  And sometimes I ask myself like, well, why am I not doing that?
3432.80s:  Right?
3433.80s:  Because it's simple, super easy.
3435.08s:  Just no shit that other people can't know and influence policies that other people can't
3441.92s:  do and make trade decisions off of that.
3446.28s:  And I'm sitting here thinking like, why the fuck did I think of that?
3450.04s:  That it just makes, it's clearly makes a lot of dollars.
3454.04s:  So it makes sense.
3455.92s:  And yeah, sometimes I just, I make things so much more difficult for me than I need to.
3462.52s:  It's a giant, giant problem, big gap in the way that I analyze stuff.
3468.72s:  Lily Warms says, be able to write financial policy and buy before the policy happens.
3473.76s:  Yeah, exactly it.
3474.76s:  Lily Warms says I'll vote for you.
3475.76s:  That's the last thing anybody needs is me in any sort of political office.
3479.36s:  I am the last person that would be even remotely qualified.
3483.84s:  So you guys should not vote for me.
3486.24s:  That would be, that would be my entire platform is don't fucking vote for me because it's a terrible
3490.96s:  choice.
3492.96s:  All right, let's see what else we come up with here in the last few minutes.
3496.40s:  I'm going to wrap up in a couple minutes here.
3498.00s:  So if there's anything else that you guys want to hit on before I wrap up, let me know.
3503.40s:  Um, let's see.
3506.80s:  No, no, no, no.
3518.40s:  No.
3525.40s:  There's a long strangle on DJT foolproof that we know is not true.
3538.00s:  There's just so much in here that's just not it's terrible.
3543.76s:  I did a video on this guy.
3546.52s:  I think the.
3550.24s:  There's more red flags that go off with this dude.
3553.72s:  And I can like literally point at.
3555.72s:  Oh, here we go.
3559.24s:  Lost $100,000 to buying options no longer should lose money.
3563.76s:  I will now only sell options instead since literally all my plays result in losses.
3568.36s:  I will now sell options where I think the options will end up in the money.
3572.80s:  So that's obviously a person.
3575.64s:  I like that they're playing around.
3577.52s:  They're having fun.
3584.44s:  Let's see.
3588.12s:  Which strategy makes options interesting to you?
3593.76s:  There you go.
3595.24s:  Right.
3596.24s:  This is the exact thing I was just talking about.
3599.32s:  We think that a strategy is going to make us money.
3604.16s:  It's that the cart is so far in front of the horse here.
3609.80s:  You can't even see it.
3613.76s:  The first thing is finding stuff that makes money.
3618.40s:  So if they're talking about buying calls or trading the wheel, both of those are fine.
3622.84s:  You can do either of those.
3624.92s:  If you pick stuff that goes down.
3629.28s:  When you get in, it doesn't matter which of those you do, you're going to lose money.
3634.20s:  So this is one of the most common mistakes I see just working with newer traders.
3641.00s:  We think that there's going to be some sort of edge inherently in an option structure.
3648.28s:  Which again, these aren't even strategies.
3650.32s:  They're just talking about option structures.
3653.32s:  So interesting stuff.
3659.36s:  The last thing, oh yeah, the last thing I want to talk about is I'm going to have an
3663.64s:  updated live stream schedule next week.
3666.52s:  I'm actually pairing down a little bit on the live stream.
3671.92s:  So my game plan is it'll probably be Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
3676.08s:  And then I'll still plan to do the Sunday stuff.
3678.68s:  The Tuesdays and Thursdays, those will be ad hoc.
3681.40s:  Like if there's something going on, I'll absolutely hop on.
3683.68s:  But if there's not, then I probably won't.
3687.40s:  But I so there will be stuff coming about that this weekend just so that everybody's
3692.72s:  ahead of the changes there.
3695.52s:  So that's the near term game plan.
3698.24s:  And then for Sunday for those in the outlier pro community through Patreon,
3705.28s:  I asked you guys already to please make sure that you have your end of month AIRs complete
3712.16s:  so that we can spend a little time talking about it.
3715.04s:  So I'll be going through my performance, what things went well, what didn't go well.
3719.92s:  This was a incredibly good month for me, very, very lucrative.
3724.04s:  So I'll talk about kind of some of this stuff that set that up.
3727.80s:  And then we'll spend time, you know, going through everybody else's stuff to make sure
3731.16s:  that we have a solid game plan into the end of the year, two months left.
3735.44s:  So the market right now, I think is up just over 20%.
3739.84s:  So if you're not there, you have to take a really, I'm not saying start scrambling to try
3744.28s:  to get there.
3745.28s:  We have to take a hard look at what you're doing and to make sure that you're truly committed
3750.20s:  to making this happen because when you miss out on market years like this, because now
3756.08s:  the market can go flat for two, three years and still have an okay average return because
