0.00s: The skies have parted and a unicorn has arrived on scene.
4.48s: I put on a ratio call diagonal in Apple and it has worked literally perfectly from when
10.12s: I enter the trade.
11.44s: I want to walk you through three things.
12.92s: The first thing is why this structure is so much better than the commonly sought after
18.60s: alternatives that people typically use for this kind of hypothesis.
22.68s: The second thing I want to talk you through is how I analyze the trade, how I structure
26.24s: the trade, how I intend to manage the trade.
28.68s: And at the third thing at the end of the video, I want to walk you through the exact
32.68s: thought process I use for winning trades to identify how can we maximize our profit potential.
40.96s: I spend so much time doing videos, management videos on managing losing trades, how to
45.80s: get out of this thing, unscathed or make a few bucks.
48.16s: I like those.
49.48s: But this is a different kind of problem set to work through, which is how do we maximize
53.60s: the profit potential here on the walk you through exactly that.
56.28s: And shout out to the Patreon family.
58.92s: Thank you guys so much for your support.
60.28s: You make videos like this possible.
62.08s: And just for your viewing pleasure, I just kept my shirt off today.
65.20s: So you're welcome.
66.96s: And let's get right into the details.
69.72s: So the ticker, as I mentioned, is Apple.
71.84s: We are trading the ratio call diagonal.
74.12s: If you are unfamiliar with this structure, that's okay.
76.76s: I have an entire playlist on it and I will link to it in the notes below.
80.76s: But essentially, we're going to use a long call that's deep in the money that's further
84.92s: out in time and then sell near term short calls against it.
88.84s: It's similar to a covered call, not the same.
91.20s: I hate the terminology, poor man's covered call because that's not what this is.
95.36s: The strategy is a diagonal.
97.60s: And it's specifically a ratio called diagonal.
100.20s: So let's talk very quickly about the general principles of the trade.
104.84s: And then I'm going to get into some specific details on the remainder.
109.00s: So the first thing is I entered this trade on 10 May.
112.84s: I had a $10,000 allotment.
115.20s: So super small trade.
117.04s: It was mostly to speculate on a movement.
120.64s: That's really what this is.
122.16s: I fully anticipated this trade not working out in my favor, but I've been delightfully
127.48s: surprised.
128.48s: So I entered in with the vast majority of the capital for the trade, 95%.
134.92s: And this essentially the reason why I make this allocation is it just prevents me from
137.92s: getting stupid if things don't go in my direction.
140.56s: But this is my average entry.
142.72s: So there is a two lot at 4745.
145.88s: So I bought two of the 130 calls expiring 17 know for 4745.
153.76s: Those were about a 90 delta when I first put them on right now.
156.84s: They're about an 83 delta.
159.00s: So what this means is I wanted to gain long exposure.
165.72s: Why?
166.72s: Well, it's a bullish.
168.44s: This is a six month daily on Apple.
171.72s: There's a lot of interesting things going on.
174.20s: But first post earnings, we got this nice big gap.
178.28s: I didn't enter right away.
180.04s: I wanted to see how it reacted about this gap.
183.76s: And if you'll notice, I actually entered on this day, not the one that the arrows pointing
187.88s: to because that would be too simple.
189.80s: I actually entered here on the fourth day.
192.84s: This is the 10th of May.
195.52s: And it's because it held this level.
198.12s: So what I did was set up what I consider to be a high probability trade.
203.00s: What that means is in this trade, I set my initial stop here.
208.16s: So first stop is right here.
209.84s: This was the initial.
210.84s: Now my new stop is here.
212.48s: So my first stop was at 16447.
215.12s: And it's kind of at this next level of resistance.
218.28s: And it's attached to this big volume.
220.04s: Now that you see permeate all the way over here, because if we fell below that, then
223.64s: it's kind of telling that I'm just completely directionally wrong.
226.60s: I've since moved this stop up, which we'll get into in just a minute.
229.68s: That's part of the profit taking approach.
232.24s: But the reason why I do this very clearly is because I have super clear bounce.
237.92s: I have a $10,000 max value trade.
239.96s: I'm using 94, 9950, whatever it was, 9490.
246.40s: The one permutation that I didn't say.
249.60s: But I'm essentially using the vast majority of the money, 95 hundred bucks.
254.08s: So I want to be correct.
256.36s: That's why this is a pretty tight window for me to operate in.
260.16s: Before I place the trade, I wanted to see how it handled this level.
263.48s: I also wanted to see what the volume looked like throughout that period.
267.16s: I also wanted to identify how it did most recently with its earnings trends and expectations.
273.28s: And overall, I had a positive bias.
276.64s: I liked the way it looked on the linear regression channels.
279.40s: The moving averages were all aligned beautifully, exactly as I wanted.
283.72s: And that was actually the first kind of warning stop that I had configured,
289.20s: which is this 50 day moving average, which is very common for me to use that as a stop for longer term trades.
296.00s: But it lined up pretty well with this resistance zone, which is kind of why I move myself there.
301.56s: So that's the overall thought process.
303.32s: It's again, nothing super complex here.
305.68s: Just bullish.
306.36s: I like what I saw.
308.44s: So to set up the stop metrics, I typically like to use the stock because this is a directional trade.
316.52s: Some people like to use a random number for the long calls, i.e.
320.28s: If the long call falls by X dollars in terms of its premium, then I get out to me.
326.80s: That's arbitrary.
327.64s: Our volatility is going to move.
329.08s: Lots of stuff is going to move.
330.52s: That's not the right way for me to set these up.
332.44s: So what I like to do is use my hypothesis.
334.76s: This is a directional hypothesis.
336.68s: If it fell to this level, I knew I was wrong at that level, I risk losing $1,600.
342.44s: That doesn't include the premium I would have collected on these short calls,
346.84s: essentially because those would make money as it goes down.
349.20s: But this is just for the long calls to tell me when I'm getting out.
351.64s: So essentially, if these long calls went from 4745 down to 3945,
357.64s: Eric is exiting the trade easy.
360.04s: So that sets up the loss side of my structure.
364.92s: The original short call outlay is down here.
369.08s: So on the 10th of May, I sold the two June 175 calls.
373.80s: I sold two of them collected $2.38.
377.40s: Those were originally 42 delta.
379.24s: So slightly out of the money from when I entered first enter the trade.
382.84s: And you can see when I entered the trade, Apple was trading at 172.73.
388.60s: So what's going on here?
390.92s: Why did I get in at 238 and then out at 204?
395.08s: Great question.
396.12s: Good question.
397.56s: And it's tied to this.
398.92s: If you look at 26 May is when I adjusted this trade.
402.28s: So if we pull this back up and we go over here to 26 May,
408.20s: we can see that again, that this is the 10th of May when I entered,
411.48s: 26 May is this candle right here.
413.88s: This is right when we started running up above 175.
418.20s: I was in a very fortunate scenario.
420.92s: It's one of my favorite things to see where my short calls were in the money.
425.96s: These were in the money.
427.24s: But I was still able to exit this trade at a profit for two reasons.
433.32s: One, volatility contracted to time had passed.
436.84s: They kind of it's the same mechanic to make money.
439.16s: Valtility and time operate in the same space in terms of the value it provides to an option.
443.40s: But because of both of those moving in concert in my favor,
446.84s: even though directionally in isolation, this trade is wrong,
451.48s: I still was able to get out at a profit, which is beautiful.
454.84s: So I didn't look the gift horse in the mouth.
457.56s: I took the trade off and I said, let me reconfigure slightly.
461.40s: So I went out from two June to nine June and I stayed at that same 175.
467.40s: Why did I stay at the 175?
469.00s: It's simple because it had a pretty damn good run.
471.72s: It had this gap up and then it started accelerating in here.
476.36s: So I didn't want to slide my strike too far out of the money
480.20s: because I was able to get 327 and I only essentially needed to do a one lot here.
487.16s: Because in this case for a two lot, I made what call it $480.
492.68s: That would have been my max potential there.
494.60s: In this case, I have a one lot and I still collected 327.
498.76s: Decent percentage on this with one entire less lot.
502.68s: The reason why this change in lot matters is because it unlocks additional upside potential,
508.84s: which again, this is a bullish trade.
513.00s: So now if we take a look at the PNL graph, as we can see, we're pretty much in max profit.
517.72s: This trade can make a total of 991 and I'm making 954.
521.56s: These short calls expire the 9th of June.
524.84s: We got a few days left.
525.88s: So you're actually going to see at the end of the video how I'm deciding what to do here,
530.60s: which is one of the most beneficial parts of this in my opinion.
534.60s: Now the other part I promised to talk to you about was comparing this to an equivalent position
540.68s: and explaining why this is better.
542.60s: A lot of people would trade a covered call here or attempt to.
546.28s: And this trade makes significantly more money than the covered call equivalent.
552.28s: Why?
553.48s: Let's use the same principle amount of money.
555.48s: 9490, that's what I have invested.
558.12s: If we look over here at the covered call equivalent 9490,
562.04s: when I got into the trade when Apple was trading at 172.73.
565.96s: So this is saying we have 9490 when Apple was trading at this price, you can get 54 shares.
571.24s: If I bought those 54 shares first, there is no short calls against it because you don't have
576.60s: enough for a covered call.
577.72s: You would need at least 100 shares.
579.32s: So you're losing that profit target right out of the gate.
582.20s: The second thing that's happening, the PNL at this point is $340.
587.32s: Whereas this trade is up $900.
589.96s: That's leverage working in my favor.
592.60s: The third thing is I control a much larger position.
596.60s: That's why I'm making more money.
598.04s: Again, leverage.
599.48s: So overall, the covered call in this scenario is far inferior.
604.28s: There are instances where this looks better.
607.48s: One, if there's a good dividend.
609.48s: Two, if you don't have a specific time frame you're operating in, I did.
615.40s: My hypothesis wasn't Apple is going to go up over the next five years.
621.08s: After I saw this move, my hypothesis was Apple is going to go up soon, meaning over the next
627.80s: quarter at least, which is exactly why I went out about six months.
631.96s: It gives me plenty of room to give it some space.
634.76s: But I'm not going out into infinity, which is one of the benefits of the covered call.
639.32s: The point being is in this scenario, if you can get the direction correct, you can make
644.28s: way more money on these than these.
647.24s: Okay.
648.04s: The next thing I want to talk to you about is this.
651.00s: What are my choices here?
652.36s: So I talked to you about wanting to maximize my profit potential, how I've been managing this trade,
657.16s: how I went from a two lot to a one lot.
660.36s: It gives me more upside potential.
661.88s: So that's what I'm doing so far to maximize my profit potential.
665.64s: But now we're at kind of a sticky spot.
669.08s: Because Apple is trading at 179.21 and I have 175 short calls.
674.28s: So what can I do to manage these?
675.88s: Well, I have three choices that I like.
678.44s: There's more than three, but I like these three.
680.44s: The first one, I can roll out the short call and we'll look at an example of that in a second.
686.04s: The second, I could close the short call for a loss and sell one of my long calls to cover the cost.
693.88s: It essentially makes sure that I'm blocking in a profit.
697.48s: So what this means is let's say I buy back this 175 call and right now they're not super expensive.
705.56s: Let's take a look.
706.92s: So if I look at this one, seven, five short call, which still is about 20 cents left,
712.36s: it's why I haven't done it yet.
713.96s: But we're going to pay four dollars 50 cents.
718.04s: So I'm going to essentially give back this three 27 and I'm going to give them
725.08s: another $1.75 cents, something like that, depending on where it lands tomorrow after the
730.84s: Theta Decays out about a dollar.
733.08s: So what this means is I need to cover that $100 loss.
737.80s: There's different ways I can do it.
739.32s: And one of those ways is by selling one of these calls, long calls at a profit.
744.20s: I realize the profit.
745.40s: It overwhelms the cost here.
747.40s: I make sure I'm realizing again as I'm realizing a loss that gains super seeds the loss in terms of value.
753.00s: So overall, I'm still net green.
755.16s: That's one choice.
756.60s: Then the third choice here is to close the whole thing down out of profit.
760.12s: So let's talk about these three scenarios.
762.28s: The very first one is I'm not super inclined to do this just yet.
766.20s: The reason I'm not super inclined to do option number two is because there's still decent
771.96s: profit left to be made in this trade.
773.96s: And this would allow me to take advantage of some of it, but not quite as much as I could
778.76s: if I choose to stay in the trade.
780.68s: So it really comes down for me.
782.68s: Do I want to stay in this trade or do I want to take my ball and go home?
786.20s: Now, if we look at closing the trade again, let me pull this up.
791.24s: We're going to walk out making about a grant.
793.80s: And again, that's also on top of the $68 that we made before.
798.20s: So overall, if this thing closes out on time, it's about a 10, 12% return on invested capital
804.68s: once we factor in whatever this loss is going to be.
807.48s: So there's that.
809.16s: Or I can roll out this short call.
812.36s: So again, if we pull up the platform and we take a look at our choices,
816.28s: let's pretend that this 20 cents decays out.
819.00s: So we wait a little bit longer.
820.68s: We're not really at any sort of risk of the dividend ex-div coming up
826.44s: forcing some sort of early option exercise, nothing like that.
830.60s: So if we let this 20 cents come out and that takes our option, essentially down to
837.08s: $4.30 if we're meeting it at $450.
841.00s: So what I'm looking for is at $4.30, how far out in time do I have to go to make a profit?
847.48s: And I essentially could go out a couple weeks and I would make some money.
852.04s: I would actually make decent money rolling these out to the 175 same strike a little further
855.80s: out in time that would increase max profit potential.
858.68s: I could even go a little further up so I can go from the 175 to 177 and a half.
863.56s: That's a math problem and if you're still watching the video, which one of those makes more money.
868.12s: You tell me or I could always do another strategy where instead of just selling one of these at the
876.36s: let's just call it $6.00, I could sell two of them and go even further out of the money
881.40s: to collect enough of a credit.
883.00s: And I still would have upside potential because I'm moving this further out and up the short call
889.48s: so we have three choices here.
891.64s: This is definitely the one I'm leaning towards and I will resolve this trade probably on
897.08s: expiration as I see what the market has done where we're settling, how much extrinsic value is left
903.56s: in the option. So it's a little bit of a TBD but this gives you a preamble to what I'm doing,
908.60s: how I'm thinking about it and as always if you have any questions, let me know, throw them down in
