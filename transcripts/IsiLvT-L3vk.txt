0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.72s:  Well, I don't know if I was going to be able to fly the drone that day because
123.22s:  it was like so windy. But I thought this was insanely cool. I couldn't get too close
129.08s:  to it because of how windy it was. But it has like this nuts waterfall that just
134.76s:  right runs right down the center like that's not manmade is just like that, which I thought
139.82s:  it was pretty sick this funny enough it's coming up to the point where I almost crash
146.90s:  crash the drone. We'll save that for next time, but that did happen. And when I pretty much,
154.18s:  let me see if this changes the thing automatically really quick as I'm talking.
158.18s:  Oh, it didn't. Okay, cool. So I made sure to click back into OBS. But yeah, when I was flying right
165.22s:  around there, the wind was absolutely insane. And it made it very difficult. You'll see in the
172.90s:  next time that we do a live stream on Monday, when I do like the Iceland video, I have a bunch
178.74s:  of drone footage. So we're still working through the Iceland one. What's up, everybody?
185.78s:  It's great to see you all. We actually had two live streams today. I just finished one
190.34s:  like 45 minutes ago where I was kind of just talking about a strategy thing that I think will
195.86s:  be kind of fun to do together. But this video is entirely different. This video is about the
204.90s:  crowd favorite, the fabled GameStop. So let me get my study materials. And we have a couple
212.90s:  ways we can start the video. We can either do like a quick recap of GameStop. I was actually planning
217.86s:  on doing a little bit more of like a current state GameStop analysis tomorrow for tomorrow's
224.66s:  market prep video because I haven't done one in a while. And so today we can dig straight in to
232.98s:  take a look at the cats old stuff and see what we can dig up and learn. We still have a long
237.94s:  ways to go with respect to analyzing his trades and making sure that like I'm actually building
244.74s:  the trades as I want. So we can dive right into that if we want. I'm going to grab his YouTube
252.02s:  channel as well because I want to take a look at some of the stuff we were picking up on last
258.10s:  time. So we have a lot to get into. Now as for always before we get too far started, let me grab the
265.30s:  chat. And I would love to do two things first. Say hello to everybody second. I want to take a look
274.50s:  at our map. Good old ape map. So as I'm saying hello, if you haven't told me where you're from
283.70s:  before, please let me know. As you can see, we're getting built out here. This has actually been a
288.58s:  completely unexpected but very fun side project view of where all the apes are from. So we have
295.22s:  raptures who was here early. We have I'd rather be skiing, Lauren Ricky, Ben Joe. Oh, that's a
303.06s:  that's a hell of a name. Ben Joe, Macausie, Mac, Mac, oh shit. How do you say that? Ben Joe,
312.34s:  Mick, Kazooie, McCazooie, Ben Joe McCazooie. Let me know if my third grade teacher is proud or not
321.14s:  proud right now. And then we have Joe Tato, Darshlop, Oli, good to see you Oli James. James says how
330.18s:  much longer till spy is a good dip by if you wait until it depends on what you're trying to do.
337.86s:  Because if you're trying to if you're trying to wait for a dip, there might not fucking be one.
346.90s:  And that's the problem if you're trying to put money into spy via something like dollar cost
351.70s:  averaging is that people spend I think too much time waiting and not and not of time investing.
360.26s:  James says I have 10k I can't lose a thousand getting in at the wrong time. If you have 10k you
364.82s:  can't lose a thousand. Don't get in the market's not for you. That's a it's a terrible terrible
371.30s:  place to put your money. That's it's yeah, just don't don't do that because there's just about
377.22s:  nothing you could put your money into. And you create yourself in that scenario that you just
382.50s:  gave me James, you gave yourself essentially an unwinnable scenario because you don't want to get
388.98s:  in if it's too early, but then you're not willing to experience an unrealized loss of a thousand
395.06s:  dollars. So yeah, pick your poison. That's that's how markets be. So yeah.
403.14s:  Yeah.
403.30s:  Tea digger. That's a great name. What up, tea digger. We got Mr. Offpoon. Good to see you.
410.18s:  Offputin says, how's the food in Iceland? I don't think that I've ever seen an Icelandic restaurant
414.50s:  even in New York City. Yeah, it's not. I don't know. I think well, you've been on
418.74s:  enough of the streams by now. You probably know in general, but like I'm not a foodie, right?
424.50s:  Food is not like I don't really care. The food was fine, but I can tell you that there's nothing
430.26s:  remarkable about the food in Iceland. What I can tell you though, genuinely is the skier
435.94s:  that they eat is talking fantastic. So big, big, big, big, big fan of the skier that they have.
444.66s:  That's actually what we get now back in the States because I don't know, I just really like that.
450.82s:  Greek yogurt is good. I think skiers light yours better.
453.38s:  So that part highly remarkable. Just about that part, I don't really, yeah, there was nothing
464.58s:  really too remarkable. The other thing that I thought actually, it's funny because you mentioned
471.86s:  an Icelandic restaurant even in New York City is because one of the things that
476.90s:  comes across in Iceland that's very similar to New York City is they really like hot dogs.
484.18s:  They really, really like hot dogs. So if you go into a gas station, they all have this little
489.86s:  griddle and it's like super normal to get hot dogs. I got a bunch of hot dogs while I was there.
494.74s:  Whenever I go places, I eat local. So if I was in Tanzania, literally I was drinking fucking
500.42s:  snake blood mixed with goats milk or goats milk mixed with goats blood because that's what they
506.82s:  fucking ate there a lot. So that's the moss. So I like I would have that when I was there and when
513.30s:  I was in Iceland, I dumped into the fucking the hot dog game because apparently they like
518.98s:  fucking hot dogs that that shit was everywhere. It was actually really surprising. I don't know what
524.58s:  it is. And it's like very American style hot dogs. Whereas in Norway, they also do the hot dog
532.02s:  stuff, but it's more like like a bratwurst. It's I don't like those. I don't like like a bunch of
538.50s:  like little pieces of fat in the hot dog. I prefer the hot dog to be just purely highly ultra-process
544.18s:  meat so that I can't discern the fat from like the chicken toes. But yeah, the bratwurst thing
550.34s:  not so much. So yeah, that was very strange about Iceland, but they I'm telling you they were
555.86s:  really big into that. And like you could go into just about everywhere and they might not have much
560.58s:  but they have a fucking hot dog. And yeah, I just strange how culturally that happens. It's
566.74s:  absolutely fascinating to me. James says with spy, if it falls hard, I'm scared it'll just be
575.30s:  more than a one K issue. Yeah, it could be. But that's the nature of buying hold, right? Like if
581.54s:  and that's okay, like if you determine that your risk is that tight, that's why I said,
585.78s:  don't put your money in the market. It's just not a good place for you. And that's okay.
588.58s:  The market is not necessarily the right place for everybody to put their money.
593.94s:  But yeah, like if somebody tells me I like I can't or I don't I don't know how to frame it. Like I
599.70s:  can't handle risk. I don't want to handle risk or whatever framing you want to use. If somebody
605.78s:  tells me that the first thing I would tell them is like literally don't put your money in the market.
609.46s:  It's not a good place for your money. And all right, let me get caught up on our map. We need the map.
619.14s:  So we have
620.98s:  Omaha. Okay. Do we have Omaha? We do have Omaha. So Omaha is on our list. Do we have Vienna? We do
637.94s:  not have Vienna. Vienna is now added to our list. That's fantastic. Hey, you're like our first
644.58s:  Slavic country. That's perfect. Great. Detroit. I'm almost positive we have.
657.54s:  Okay, then maybe I look like I was wrong. We didn't have Detroit. Now we got that.
663.06s:  James says San Diego, which we already have San Diego for sure because that's where your boy is.
671.78s:  I am a rep in us in San Diego, but I'll add San Diego proper if that's you're down that way.
680.02s:  Do we have that? Off-Punsa's Vienna is in Slavic. I didn't say Vienna was Slavic. I said it's
686.98s:  in a Slavic region. Everything around Vienna is very Slavic like Slovakia, like Hungary, like Austria,
695.46s:  like pretty much all of these. Beverly Hills, we don't have that one yet. Beverly Hills,
706.18s:  that James is from Coronado, okay. Nope, that's Corona. I'm an idiot for a Nado.
718.58s:  Perfect. Very good. Akron. Akron, I feel like I've heard before, but we'll add that. Perfect. All right.
733.38s:  So we still have homework because we still need to find representation either from Iceland
745.78s:  or from Greenland and then Madagascar or what was Tasmania? Those were the choices. That's what we
755.14s:  need to add to the list. We're very close. We had a New Zealander at one point. We're very,
760.98s:  very close. But we need to get a Tasmanian on here. So just remember that we have a little work
769.94s:  to do. So we really need to get you guys out there, combing the streets. If you can get on
776.02s:  the Superstank subreddit, if you're there, the GME reddit or wherever you like to be.
782.10s:  And if you can find a fellow ape that is from any of these places, that would be, I mean,
789.30s:  they don't even have to stay for the whole time. They just got to pop in and say, yo, I'm from
792.90s:  Greenland. I'm out. And then that's fucking, that's mission complete as far as I'm concerned. So
798.74s:  yeah, great. That's really, and we're really missing Africa. Huh? Nobody from Africa.
808.50s:  Ukrainians are probably a little bit busy right now. As I imagine, most of the Iranians and
814.66s:  Israelis are Kazakhstan would be kind of cool too. Okay. We got a few more on our map. Nice job.
822.82s:  All right. So let's kill that. Let's kill that. And let's get into
832.10s:  the workbook. And then we need to get over here to the CACs trades. Okay. So this was looking at
841.14s:  the last thing we did. We looked at all of his 20 calls that he had scaled into. So we're
851.38s:  right in here. Arab says Arab Rick Arab Rick Arab Rick. Don't do me dirty like this. Do not
865.14s:  tell me that your name is Arab Rick. And you're not from a fucking somewhere somewhere around here.
873.54s:  I'm grabbing the map back again. So Arab Rick, I'm just going to slowly start zooming in. And you
883.70s:  could just tell me where to stop. Anything. Anything starting to feel like home. Does this feel
894.66s:  right to you? Maybe if I scroll a little bit to the right Arab Rick. Is this Arab Rick says
903.78s:  where I'm watching from or where you're from. Not where you're from or you're watching from.
907.94s:  And with the name like Arab Rick, I'm expecting you to be watching from any of these. Let me know.
915.62s:  You zoom in a little bit more. Let me know if the mouse is starting to feel like it's
921.86s:  Texas mother. What a fucking catfish. What a catfish. I thought Arab Rick that we were really
932.50s:  going to be able to do some magic. Palestine. You're I don't care if you're from fucking Palestine.
940.42s:  Rick, you're in Texas. I could have checked off Palestine. That would have been pretty cool.
946.90s:  We would have just been sitting here clicking in and slowly clicking in and getting warmer and warmer.
952.58s:  And sure as shit. Rick out here just playing games with my heart. Damn it, Rick.
962.26s:  Damn it. Arab Rick says, well, I'd be impressed to be on the internet there. Fuck in Starlink.
968.58s:  Dog. Don't play me like this. I really can't read any of this. These literally just look like
977.22s:  squiggles. That's nuts. Netherlands. I think we have. Let's see. Yeah, we do have the Netherlands.
995.30s:  We have two different areas in the Netherlands. We have in Shenday, in Sheday, in Amsterdam.
1010.10s:  Robo says ads on FYI. Yeah, I literally have no say in it anymore. I have that. I literally have
1017.86s:  them turned off. So I think that might be a a new thing because that slowly started to change.
1031.54s:  But only I'm always curious how many people like it because it doesn't look like everybody's.
1040.66s:  Dan says boring Colorado. Hey, that might be where I'm moving to.
1044.74s:  Chill on Colorado. Right now we're eyeballing outside Colorado Springs.
1057.30s:  Arab Rick says I'll reach out to some friends in Saudi, Qatar and Jordan when they wake up. Yeah,
1061.54s:  see, that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Hit those dudes up.
1064.74s:  I'm be like, yo, there's a really important mission right now. We have a real need to check off
1072.18s:  more of these little blocks on this on this map. That would be sick. All right. Time to get to work,
1080.10s:  though. We need to we need to dive in and talk a bit about some game stop. Now I already made a video
1090.42s:  that talked about the fine for the cat reporting and stuff. So I'm not sure that we really need to
1096.90s:  dive too deep into that unless there's any specific questions anybody has on it. But that just,
1102.82s:  yeah, I mean, it's entertaining enough as it is. Like the I don't know anybody that saw that video,
1109.06s:  but it was essentially just satire the whole video just because I think the the scenarios kind of
1113.46s:  entertaining. But that I don't think that there's a massive impact. And then from a broader
1120.90s:  game stop perspective, there's a little bit interesting stuff going on, but there's not like a
1126.26s:  ton. So I figure I can spend a little bit more time probably tomorrow. And I can go, you know,
1136.34s:  further in the detail on everything. But like I said, if there's anything in the interim that
1141.62s:  you're really, really interested in taking a look at, let me know. I'm happy to take a peek at it.
1146.82s:  But Robloz says, well, Ken, be okay. Well, like I've told you guys, and I hope I made it clear
1154.58s:  in that video. I think right now what Ken probably needs more than quite literally anything
1162.58s:  is your thoughts and prayers. So I think it's always important to take care of those who take care
1168.90s:  of us. And right now Ken is going through a very, very challenging time. So you know, I just
1178.90s:  try to remind everybody to let's just keep Ken in our thoughts because you never really know, right?
1189.70s:  Ken is he's he's going through some trying times. That's I mean, I said that I think as clear as I
1195.86s:  could in the video, because I mean, right now Ken is worth what 43 billion dollars. So even if he
1205.38s:  was personally culpable for that, it's just that's a lot to take on for poor Ken. And I think that
1216.50s:  it's incumbent on us to just always take care of those who take care of us. And Ken is in a he's in
1225.14s:  the fight really the fight for his life. So yeah, poor Ken.
1234.74s:  Doctors, they says oligarchs going to oligarch. Yeah, I know. When I saw that, I mean, I get I'm
1242.90s:  I'm not of the opinion genuinely that, you know, we should be or that Ken should be
1248.58s:  like raked over the calls genuinely. And I definitely think you should be held accountable for sure,
1256.90s:  but I don't think you should be raked over the calls. And the reason why I don't think you should
1261.22s:  be raked over the calls is because that that individual thing does look like a process issue. But
1269.46s:  he literally has he gets no pity from me because he could hire an entire team of PhDs if he wanted
1283.46s:  to do just that to just do compliance. So it's very clear that he just doesn't give a fuck.
1289.62s:  And for that, I think he should be raked over the calls because it's it's I think it's clearly
1295.62s:  clearly an indication of not caring at all. And if you think about it, he's not made to care.
1308.66s:  There's nothing about a million dollar fine for Citadel, which did 2.9 billion in trading revenue
1317.30s:  last quarter alone. Like that's super frustrating. Like that, I really don't like that.
1325.06s:  Long Swayze says, do they have to correct the reports? I don't know. I assume that they would
1328.50s:  have to amend them because I think that in the article I read, they had already amended some of
1333.86s:  them, but they needed to go through and amend more of them. So because they had found another error
1341.38s:  going back. So I do think that they'll probably have to go through and fix them.
1346.66s:  The problem is, and I think a lot of people might be thinking that there's some sort of like
1351.70s:  really nefarious activity going on underneath the surface and there could be, but I just really
1357.86s:  doubt it. The reason why I really doubt it with respect to this specific thing to be clear,
1363.70s:  not with respect to Citadel, but with respect to the reporting is because with like even if they
1371.78s:  don't comply or they try not to comply, it's not like they're going to get away with it. And
1377.38s:  they know they're not going to get away with it. It's like if you fuck your taxes, you could
1382.18s:  fuck your taxes for a year and maybe slide that under the radar or something maybe. But like if you
1389.22s:  fuck your taxes every single year, you're literally going to get caught. It's just a matter of time.
1396.42s:  So a place like Citadel that already has the ability to make so much fucking money. I don't think
1406.66s:  that they would purposefully not comply with this thing to try and make a little bit more money
1414.26s:  thinking that they might not get caught. Like I just that I don't really see happening personally.
1420.58s:  They're smarter than that. Like it is what it is. They're smarter than that.
1429.14s:  Citric says, I don't think that he is evil, but it's weird that most traders or trades are
1434.74s:  internalized. So it feels like he's moving price where he thinks is right. But I'm also retarded
1440.42s:  so who gives a fuck. Yeah. Well, I mean, the order internalization process I don't like. Now again,
1447.94s:  they're they're playing the game as it's laid out for them. Right. So the reason why they do that
1452.74s:  is because they can and it's advantageous for them to do so. So it's kind of like it's like when
1459.62s:  Trump was debating Hillary Clinton and he came out with that again, not getting political, just the
1466.34s:  comment and the content of what I'm saying. And there was during that one debate where Hillary says,
1472.98s:  oh, well, you know, Trump doesn't pay taxes. And Trump says, no, like I do pay my taxes, but I use
1479.14s:  these write-offs so that I can decrease how much I have to pay. And I think the question that
1484.50s:  the moderator asks is like, do you use like these tactics or whatever to, you know, decrease how
1489.62s:  much you have to pay. And Trump says, of course, I do because, you know, it's the same reason why
1496.58s:  I do it in like her donors use it. So really what he's signaling there is if he's not supposed to
1503.86s:  use that series of tax breaks as he can, then it should be written out of legislation. And really,
1510.10s:  he was just highlighting how, yeah. I'd rather be skiing says to be very, he doesn't the team of
1520.02s:  accountancy hires does. Yeah, definitely. But he's the reason why I say he it's because he's
1524.50s:  ultimately responsible. Even if you have an account and do your taxes, you the individual are culpable
1530.26s:  for what's done. So yeah, like in if he said, I don't want you to use these loopholes,
1538.90s:  then they wouldn't use the loopholes, right? He could dictate that to them if he was so inclined.
1543.46s:  But again, like it would be, it literally would be dumb. If Trump didn't do that, I would think
1549.86s:  that's dumber than thinking some type of way about him using that loophole. And it's not even a
1555.94s:  loophole. Like we call it loophole, but it's, it's just literally following the laws. It's written.
1562.74s:  So if I actually don't really know what loophole means, maybe it is a loophole. Let me look at
1567.14s:  one second. I'm going to look at the definition.
1576.66s:  No, no, this one. I'm grabbing warm and chat GPTX. We're going to need it to find loophole.
1586.74s:  Let's see. The loophole is a gap ambiguity or inadequacy in a law ruler system that allows someone
1600.98s:  to circumvent its intent without technically breaking it. Yeah, then I don't think that's a,
1606.26s:  I don't think he's using loopholes like he's literally following it as it's written.
1610.18s:  Like for example, there's a really important, I try to talk to, to traders about a holistic approach
1621.62s:  to wealth. And then we'll get to games that by promise. But I hope this point is well received
1625.62s:  slash useful for some of you. So one of the things about being really smart about being a trader
1633.86s:  is developing a holistic approach to wealth. How can you do that? By having different asset classes,
1639.70s:  there are different asset classes that behave differently, that provide different benefits. So for
1644.42s:  example, I think it's exceedingly smart for most people to get some sort of exposure to real estate.
1651.70s:  And the reason why I think it's super important to get exposure to real estate is because there is
1657.14s:  insanely better tax treatment there than other places. As a trader, you are destroyed on taxes.
1666.18s:  In real estate, you are not. It's very, very tax incentivized. So having a broader approach to wealth
1675.62s:  typically leads to better outcomes. But that's my two cents.
1681.46s:  Okay. So let us get into GameStop. Close. Don't need that anymore. So last time, let me put us into
1699.46s:  on demand so that I can see where we left off. And let's go to
1712.42s:  here. Okay. Yeah. So my memory is just jogged. So the first thing I need to do is update this really
1720.26s:  fast. I like to add timestamps for people so that they know when this thing actually starts,
1725.62s:  because we always spend a little time kind of like fucking around in the beginning. I always enjoy
1728.74s:  that. But so what time is it in the video 2854? We'll call it 29 29 000.
1740.98s:  BME content starts. For anybody that watches it afterwards, you're welcome.
1748.66s:  Okay. Hey, roaring titties here. What up, roaring tittie? Great to see you. Everybody, you know,
1754.74s:  big shout out for roaring tittie. Crowd favorite here. Big fan of that name. There's a couple,
1760.26s:  there's a couple names that really make me happy. And that's one of them. Okay. So where we left off
1766.50s:  was we were deconstructing a series of trades. And there was actually a broad conversation that
1771.62s:  underwent about another series of trades that we are trying to attribute to the cat,
1778.98s:  which I think we should take a look at. So we spent a little time looking at a series of trades.
1787.46s:  And we took the time to build this. And if I'm not mistaken, off-pooden, let me know. I think it was
1795.78s:  somewhere in like the 22nd is where the additional 20 000 would have been put on at some other strikes.
1803.78s:  Or no, I'm sorry, not some other strikes, just at different points during the day.
1808.10s:  So what I'm highlighting here is I think we have a pretty good idea of the position that he built out,
1817.86s:  when he built it out and how he built it out. And when I looked at the way that he moved into this
1823.30s:  position, I did find it really interesting. Because if we kind of color code this a little bit,
1830.74s:  we'll run that orange for the 20th. Then we'll go that for the 21st.
1843.54s:  22nd, which again, if I'm not mistaken, I think off-pooden said that there's two more here.
1853.78s:  Vladimir says, I haven't recorded from my alternative universe, but it does add up looking at
1858.58s:  premiums, oh, and volume. And put in just for my context, was that on the 22nd, am I remembering
1863.94s:  that correctly? Or did you find, was it another day? I just wanted like add a mental note so at least I
1869.62s:  can track it. So there's, oops. So here's the 24th, the 28th, and then the 30th.
1889.14s:  Putin says the 20th to the 29th, oh, that's super not helpful. You're saying that the additional 20,000
1899.30s:  up here from his position, you're saying that the additional 20,000 occurred over all of these days,
1907.70s:  not on a single one of the days. Is that correct?
1910.10s:  I just want to make sure I'm following. 22nd was the big day at 70K. Okay, so 22nd here, let's track.
1922.74s:  Yeah, okay, so I have it right. So because I'm tracking 50 that came through in these blocks. So
1929.46s:  you're tracking 70, which would mean that there, that's, this is exactly what it would have been.
1933.62s:  Okay, I didn't think that I was missing that. I'm going to add additional, but it wasn't in 5K
1942.82s:  blocks though, correct? Additional 20K, 20 calls. Putin, can you let me know if you saw it in
1957.86s:  small, this was 5K. Well, I tracked all of the 5K. All right, let's do this together really quick.
1964.10s:  Oops, well, while I'm in here, I might as well pick an emoji. Is there a cat? That would be good.
1969.30s:  Hey, here's some cats. Cool. All right, so let's take a look at the 22nd.
1975.94s:  Do you mean we need to go to May 22.
1991.30s:  So here's, I think I caught that one at the mid. Let me double check.
1996.98s:  Okay, all that's good. All right, so I'm going to filter it by
2003.54s:  2021 June. That's kind of annoying. Do I have to like manually type it in? If it's old 21,
2019.14s:  106 2024. Can I do that? Yeah, that's silly. That's real silly. Okay, so I'm looking on the 22nd.
2042.26s:  There were no larger than 5K. I don't think so. Let me see, actually, let me take that back.
2049.46s:  Yep, okay, so there were no larger than 5K. That I can see.
2056.18s:  I wish I could filter by this freaking contract.
2071.06s:  Oh, frustrating.
2072.58s:  All of Putin says 70K was the total. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to calculate here.
2080.10s:  So let me grab handy dandy workbook on this side for the 22nd. I'm just going to do a quick count.
2086.18s:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
2091.38s:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. So there's two more that are
2100.02s:  missing from here that we need to add. Now I get to play the very fun game of figuring out out of
2106.18s:  this whole thing, which you're missing. Love this for me. So 335 is there, 338, aha, there's another
2115.54s:  right here. 22, May 24. This one came through at 1203, 1203, 45.
2133.70s:  GME would be at the same price as this matter, 523, 5000, 3.53 million, okay.
2142.02s:  You want to have 293, 275, 313, 2925, 198. That's another one that's missing.
2158.10s:  22, May, 198. This one came through at 0936, 0936, about 34.
2172.02s:  We have 5,000. And then premium was 1.98, got it. Then we have 3,1,
2185.62s:  25, where's this 2,5? 0918. That's not here. Oh, there it is. Oh, it came in at the mid.
2205.62s:  Do I have 25 twice? 0852, 25. No, that's okay. So this just,
2228.26s:  293, so this just needs to be moved. 293, 25, then 275 goes up here.
2242.66s:  Oops, delete this. So now we are missing 10,000.
2258.18s:  So let's see if any more of these might have gotten broken up.
2268.02s:  21, let's limit it to the 20 call.
2273.22s:  20, 20.
2280.18s:  So this is all. I just don't see this being him. These are just way too small.
2303.86s:  Yeah, I don't see this.
2313.06s:  Vladimir, where's the rest that you see from here? Because you're telling me that you're tracking
2319.06s:  70 here.
2327.78s:  Vladimir says where is it written that unusual documents all our options trades.
2334.18s:  I don't understand your point.
2346.34s:  I can pass on what I have. Yeah, well, if you can, you can throw it in either shoot it to me via email
2352.42s:  or you can throw it in the discord if you're in there. I'm not sure where you're at. But yeah,
2357.62s:  if you send it to me, I'll take a look and see if we just compare notes.
2363.46s:  Because otherwise, really, my guess is it might have happened on one of these other days.
2368.18s:  So if we look at the 21st, let's take a look. 1, 2, 3 blocks, the 20th,
2376.02s:  1, 2 blocks, the 24th, another 23rd.
2390.98s:  Looks like no. 24th, 1, 2 blocks.
2397.78s:  24th, 27th, nothing.
2408.74s:  28th, 2 blocks.
2415.22s:  29th, no blocks.
2421.22s:  30th, 1 block.
2427.06s:  31st.
2429.62s:  Aha, there it is. Found it.
2433.14s:  It was the 31st.
2436.02s:  There she blows.
2444.98s:  12, 54, 44, 5,000.
2452.74s:  And this was at 2.8 mil.
2455.54s:  Found it.
2457.46s:  So Putin, it's not 70,000 on the 22nd.
2464.34s:  It's only 60,000. That's where he built most of his position.
2468.34s:  And then I can see one came through on the 31st.
2482.58s:  Nothing on the June. I'm just going to do this whole week really quick.
2486.66s:  OK, so there's five left to go.
2493.46s:  I don't know where the five is.
2496.26s:  Off Putin says 10k on the 23rd.
2505.14s:  I didn't see any on the 23rd.
2509.86s:  It wouldn't be 10k on the 23rd anyways.
2513.86s:  That would be wrong.
2516.50s:  Because that would put us at over this.
2531.78s:  Yeah, so Putin, I don't think the 23rd is accurate.
2535.86s:  What I can, what I can clearly see is the.
2544.66s:  There's definitely something on the 31st.
2550.18s:  That I missed before because we didn't go there.
2553.94s:  But yeah, there's not 10k on the 23rd.
2557.94s:  And then the 24th, there's 10k.
2562.50s:  And then you have 5k on the 20th and the 21st.
2565.78s:  That's not right.
2569.30s:  So Putin on the 20th, there's 10k.
2572.98s:  And then on the 21st, there's 15k.
2575.22s:  Yeah, so I think your numbers are off a bit from what I'm seeing here at least.
2579.54s:  But I'm still missing five.
2585.30s:  So maybe I'll go back.
2586.66s:  Let's just do all of them really fast.
2622.26s:  Oh, no, that's not it.
2639.14s:  It's in here.
2640.42s:  It's definitely in here because I just counted 24.
2646.42s:  It's definitely in here.
2648.18s:  Going to sort this by date.
2657.94s:  31st, 30th, 29th, 28th, 1, 2,
2668.74s:  24th, 1, 2, 23rd, nothing.
2683.14s:  22nd, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
2699.62s:  Oh, I fucked up my count.
2706.50s:  Yeah, I'm at 9, I have to double check.
2711.30s:  I'm just going to change the size minimum.
2713.38s:  I can make this way cleaner.
2714.58s:  Let's do a minimum of 1,000.
2717.62s:  Yeah, duh.
2719.78s:  Okay, good, good, 1, 2, good, 1, 2, good, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11.
2740.74s:  So I have an extra one in here now.
2743.54s:  How did that happen?
2744.58s:  How did that happen?
2748.58s:  So this, I need to double check.
2757.78s:  So let's continue on the 21st, there's 3, 20th, there's 2.
2764.90s:  But this is 4 May 17th.
2767.30s:  I don't think that's it.
2769.54s:  Where the fuck?
2779.94s:  Where the fuck?
2783.78s:  He posted this one to you, Julian?
2790.18s:  Then maybe...
2792.66s:  April?
2799.30s:  Oh, man.
2804.82s:  That's frustrating.
2806.26s:  That's so frustrating.
2810.50s:  There's something...
2814.42s:  There's something of a gap here.
2819.22s:  Vladimir says, keep in mind since you are pinning the results on 5K blocks,
2823.22s:  you know the premiums, the total,
2825.30s:  the most match with RK paid.
2826.74s:  Yeah.
2827.62s:  Well, I'm not pinning the results to 5K.
2832.10s:  So if you notice I'm doing a minimum size of 1K,
2835.30s:  it's just because there's a reality at some point,
2837.70s:  instead of doing a 5K block, you did a few 1,000 blocks.
2842.10s:  But what I am taking as an assumption is that if he's going to build the rest of this position,
2847.70s:  he probably wouldn't have been able to do it by...
2854.66s:  by small trades.
2858.82s:  So let me run through these really quick.
2862.10s:  353-338-333-333-
2866.26s:  Wait.
2868.18s:  Fuck, this is a different order.
2869.54s:  How did I order this before?
2870.90s:  I don't want to have to redo this.
2872.58s:  Okay, good.
2875.38s:  Okay.
2876.18s:  So 353-338-353-25293-25275
2884.82s:  313-2925-31.
2890.98s:  So this is the extra one.
2899.38s:  Now, before I do that though, I want to see what I saw here.
2905.70s:  Let's do 0-936.
2912.34s:  I'm going to sort it by time.
2922.02s:  Yeah, okay.
2925.06s:  You can stay.
2928.02s:  All right.
2928.66s:  So now,
2932.74s:  fuck, now I'm like really, really confused.
2939.70s:  Because we're missing literally 10,000.
2948.26s:  And I have no idea where they are.
2958.50s:  Let's look at maybe 500.
2961.06s:  And it still doesn't let me pick the fucking expiration cycle.
2963.86s:  That's so frustrating.
2965.46s:  This would be so much cleaner if I could just pick the correct expiration cycle.
2970.58s:  Brain Titty says he could have had them before.
2972.58s:  Yeah, we'll probably have to go back, yeah, months before.
2975.38s:  Maybe it absolutely could be the case.
2978.90s:  I just want to verify that I'm not missing anything short term here.
2982.90s:  But I'm generally agreeing with you
2986.10s:  the wrong.
2999.06s:  All right.
2999.38s:  So now let's go back.
3001.94s:  I mean, let's start from fucking 24.
3005.46s:  Let's see.
3010.18s:  That's not it.
3017.06s:  That's not it.
3025.38s:  That's not it.
3034.18s:  Those are me.
3038.82s:  My head isn't a fucking blender right now.
3043.14s:  Ah, ah.
3044.42s:  Ah, I have another idea.
3047.22s:  I have another idea.
3051.70s:  Here or not, I have one more idea.
3054.50s:  Let's try this.
3055.14s:  Let's go to when did he post his update to June?
3060.26s:  Is that correct?
3069.06s:  Doctors says you're missing 5K and 529.
3071.86s:  Oh, perfect.
3073.06s:  Maybe this is easier than you say I'm missing 5K on 529.
3077.86s:  So that would go in here.
3080.02s:  Let's check.
3080.74s:  That would be a fucking hope that's true.
3083.78s:  529.
3086.34s:  Market open, market close.
3090.82s:  I don't think I am.
3093.86s:  Doctors, where are you seeing that?
3099.30s:  I see nothing that returns here.
3103.22s:  529.
3106.02s:  Whole market day.
3109.22s:  Minimum size 500.
3113.22s:  Strike 2020.
3118.42s:  All those are on board.
3124.42s:  There's nothing to do with multi-leg.
3128.42s:  Yeah.
3129.62s:  I don't know if you can see that.
3132.50s:  I don't see that, but I have another method here.
3136.34s:  So what I'm going to do is this is on demand.
3142.58s:  Now I'm going to look at the 21 June 20s.
3146.34s:  Let's wait for this to load here.
3151.62s:  And then let's analyze the volume.
3156.42s:  Okay.
3160.66s:  So this we consume in massively.
3164.26s:  So right now what this is showing me is the volume
3167.46s:  for the options themselves.
3171.06s:  This specific option.
3174.98s:  All Putin says volume was 8460 on the 29th.
3180.34s:  Yeah, the volume could be 8460.
3182.58s:  Yeah, exactly.
3183.22s:  The volume's 8460, but that doesn't mean that he traded it.
3186.34s:  Because if I look if I'm limiting it by 500.
3197.06s:  Yeah, it's that's not him.
3205.38s:  Because this is going to look at any of the larger trades that happen.
3210.10s:  So what that likely means is that there's a lot of small trades.
3216.18s:  That happened.
3221.78s:  Which would make sense because again, I've told you guys this already.
3224.90s:  This is this is how I found the trade being built out because of really interesting volume.
3233.30s:  So let's see what days had over 5000 volume.
3238.18s:  The ninth of May.
3245.70s:  I'm going to.
3250.10s:  Vladimir says I just don't know that unusual whales captures everything large.
3253.94s:  Yeah, I mean, I just I I hear you, but in this instance, I have no idea why they would screen out
3262.18s:  to 5000 blocks, right?
3263.86s:  Like they're tracking every other one of these blocks.
3268.98s:  Doctors, they says 529 at 1053.
3272.42s:  Okay, so let me do this then.
3274.98s:  I'll check another data source to see if I can corroborate what doctors.
3279.94s:  They has found.
3281.62s:  So let me log into this super fast.
3285.14s:  Because.
3287.54s:  Doctors, they are you getting that from unusual whales or are you getting that from another provider?
3299.78s:  Delete this.
3302.10s:  Really, can you send me a screenshot?
3305.54s:  Yeah, please, because that's crazy.
3308.10s:  And this does not help at all.
3313.14s:  With my.
3315.38s:  Absolute aha.
3318.02s:  There it is.
3322.10s:  This is at the bid.
3338.10s:  Hmm.
3349.38s:  At.
3353.94s:  Just doesn't make sense.
3355.38s:  I want to see the.
3366.66s:  There's like the actual.
3376.18s:  This isn't it.
3378.90s:  Wow, that's so confusing.
3381.46s:  That's so confusing.
3385.22s:  I mean.
3405.22s:  I mean.
3408.26s:  Sorry, I'm like really stuck on this because there's the part of me that is clearly
3414.90s:  reading into this.
3416.82s:  And what I'm reading through is.
3421.78s:  I cannot help but think at the 5,000 size, it's him.
3426.82s:  I cannot help but think that.
3430.26s:  However, I.
3434.18s:  Just fully do not comprehend.
3438.50s:  How this would have been at the bid.
3442.26s:  I do not understand that.
3444.74s:  So let's take a look really quick.
3447.06s:  The premium.
3449.30s:  The premium on this.
3451.94s:  Was two seven five million.
3457.14s:  Two seven five million.
3458.74s:  So how about five thousand hundred five five?
3463.38s:  How?
3466.50s:  How is that coded at the bid?
3468.74s:  It doesn't make sense.
3470.90s:  It's.
3474.74s:  Oh, it's so frustrating.
3482.74s:  Okay, I mean, I'm going to.
3485.38s:  My best guess.
3489.30s:  We'll be to take it at as what it is.
3494.90s:  Doctors say it says why is it so weird that it's at the bid?
3498.58s:  Because the bid.
3501.54s:  It is especially for an order of that size.
3506.18s:  It is essentially next to impossible to get filled at the bid.
3511.38s:  So Ricky says we need PV or Richard here to help.
3514.98s:  No, not not to sound conceited but neither of those guys would know the answer to this.
3520.42s:  Because.
3523.46s:  Like it literally looks like a codifying.
3527.94s:  Error because the transaction here.
3532.50s:  Literally is not at the bid.
3535.54s:  Right?
3535.86s:  Like that's what right.
3537.22s:  Look, the bid asked was five forty five by five sixty five.
3542.74s:  Spot, which is what he transacted at here was five fifty.
3546.90s:  That's not the bid.
3548.50s:  That's mid.
3550.18s:  It's towards the bid, but it's not the bid.
3553.54s:  So the coding on this one is very strange.
3557.06s:  Very, very strange.
3558.18s:  I'm glad that we found it.
3559.22s:  It's a great find, but it doesn't make sense.
3563.06s:  So I'm going to flag it anyways is something to take a look at out of curiosity.
3567.94s:  But yeah, this is a very weird, very weird fill.
3578.02s:  So zero seven fifty three.
3579.46s:  Fifty three.
3584.66s:  Got thirty nine.
3586.18s:  Yeah.
3589.22s:  GC says no, the Viking knows more.
3591.94s:  Yeah, on this thing I and again, it's not the sound conceited, but I'm very confident that
3598.18s:  yeah, in the way I think about this one.
3604.90s:  And then this was two points of five.
3609.54s:  Okay.
3611.94s:  Let's find this other Gremlin.
3616.98s:  Doctors, hey, as you said that there was another day, five twenty nine and the twenty
3627.06s:  seconds is where I'm missing another one.
3629.46s:  Let's go to the twenty second.
3631.38s:  And then it should be flagged at the bid.
3638.02s:  We'll go by size.
3640.42s:  There it is.
3643.46s:  See, this one, this one makes more sense.
3648.74s:  This one makes a lot more sense.
3651.62s:  It's still unbelievably unlikely.
3655.54s:  But it does make sense.
3658.26s:  Like this, this is conceivable to occur.
3661.70s:  Three thirty five three thirty eight three fifty three two five.
3668.02s:  So this is the other two five I was missing about it.
3670.10s:  Okay.
3672.90s:  So then copy you.
3674.98s:  You came in at zero nine.
3678.82s:  Zero four fifty four.
3683.22s:  And then size was five.
3686.42s:  And then two point five.
3691.06s:  Ah.
3693.14s:  First of all, shout out to everybody for getting through this.
3700.98s:  This is fantastic.
3710.26s:  Let's take a look at here.
3713.94s:  Total cost was sixty five seven hundred.
3718.02s:  This is tracking total cost at sixty seven.
3720.82s:  That's close enough.
3721.62s:  There could be like rounding errors and stuff like that.
3727.62s:  I'm not super pressed on it.
3732.18s:  I think this.
3734.34s:  This is super helpful.
3735.54s:  Okay, great.
3737.70s:  Beautiful.
3738.50s:  Glad that that's done.
3739.46s:  Great job.
3739.86s:  Thank you.
3740.66s:  Thank you.
3741.46s:  Beautiful.
3742.10s:  Glad that that's done.
3743.22s:  Great job friends.
3745.22s:  So.
3749.54s:  Now.
3751.86s:  Let's take a look at.
3758.02s:  There is another series of trades that we needed to look at as well.
3772.26s:  Okay.
3783.46s:  I wanted to find those other blocks.
3785.70s:  I think it was from April.
3791.54s:  We got the.
3795.14s:  Let me see.
3801.86s:  I'm.
3803.86s:  I'm glad to hear says do your premiums add up to around sixty eight point one there's sixty seven seven nine.
3811.46s:  And I see his total cost at sixty five seven.
3815.86s:  So there's definitely a variance there.
3823.46s:  His price paid was five six seven fours.
3826.02s:  Let's see.
3831.54s:  um
3834.34s:  Um.
3861.34s:  Yeah, like literally almost perfect.
3864.34s:  So I have his basis here at 565, which again, I think that that's, that's probably about right.
3880.58s:  And then you yeah, exactly.
3882.26s:  So then there's a little bit of commissions that'll be added on top of it.
3885.82s:  So his pure his pure cost here 565 and then his basis is 567 54 equals no let's do.
3902.06s:  How do I want to do this?
3903.14s:  I'm going to add a row here.
3905.62s:  Get rid of this.
3906.82s:  This would be a little size to premium move those here.
3916.10s:  This will be a long option basis.
3924.06s:  And then his long option reported basis is 5.6754.
3932.42s:  And equals.
3937.38s:  Uh.
3941.38s:  Those 100 times this.
3953.98s:  Times this.
3959.42s:  So his total premium comes to 68104800.
3964.18s:  And then the variance between these this minus.
3973.70s:  This times this times 100.
3981.22s:  314,000.
3984.06s:  So then this divided by this.
3987.62s:  You 62.
3992.46s:  It seems.
3995.86s:  It seems steep.
4001.46s:  Off Putin says need to be around 68.1.
4003.98s:  Yeah.
4004.26s:  So I see 68.1 for his value on price paid.
4012.58s:  My long option basis is correct.
4015.90s:  Because my long option basis is 565.
4019.58s:  His is 56575.
4023.58s:  So I think this is fine because this is using just the premiums.
4027.06s:  This isn't including anything.
4030.30s:  So then we can see what is overall fees were, which is about 314,000.
4035.10s:  But that seems too much.
4037.98s:  Because you guys are saying each rate is like 50 cents a contract.
4050.14s:  Hmm.
4055.14s:  Let's see.
4058.14s:  What is this times 0.5?
4063.14s:  That's only 60.
4065.14s:  Yeah, interesting.
4069.14s:  So the variance is a little bit higher.
4073.14s:  I don't.
4075.14s:  Don't totally have an answer to it right now, but I don't actually think it matters that much to be honest.
4083.14s:  I'm not ultra concerned about it.
4088.14s:  So.
4089.14s:  So.
4094.14s:  There's a couple of things that stick out to me here.
4098.14s:  The first thing that sticks out is the way that he scaled into it.
4110.14s:  Because these.
4113.14s:  These look a little bit like an after.
4118.14s:  After thought.
4122.14s:  Let's take a look at GameStop on those days to start with.
4130.14s:  We'll take a look on the 29th, the 30th and the 31st.
4143.14s:  Jimmy.
4145.14s:  We're going to go back the year.
4148.14s:  I'm going to turn my air off in my house.
4153.14s:  Don't need the air running right now.
4161.14s:  29th.
4162.14s:  Year.
4164.14s:  30.
4165.14s:  31st.
4169.14s:  Hmm.
4173.14s:  Very interesting.
4181.14s:  So.
4184.14s:  He started scaling into this.
4187.14s:  Looks like the 20th.
4190.14s:  I'm here.
4193.14s:  And then I know that there's some conjecture.
4196.14s:  About him putting on another trade.
4201.14s:  Before this.
4206.14s:  Because the other thing that I would love to know.
4211.14s:  Is when did he build his share position.
4218.14s:  He had five million.
4222.14s:  Let me clear this stuff out.
4225.14s:  So then he had.
4227.14s:  Five million shares.
4230.14s:  And he had.
4233.14s:  And he had.
4236.14s:  The last we saw.
4240.14s:  Was 200,000.
4245.14s:  And he had at 200,000.
4250.14s:  55.1774.
4255.14s:  And.
4257.14s:  Now when he comes back the basis.
4261.14s:  21274.
4264.14s:  Okay.
4268.14s:  Okay.
4272.14s:  Okay.
4274.14s:  Okay.
4277.14s:  Okay.
4280.14s:  Hmm.
4283.14s:  Hmm.
4286.14s:  So.
4291.14s:  From the eight.
4295.14s:  So.
4301.14s:  From the eight community.
4304.14s:  What's the current.
4307.14s:  What's the current best guess.
4310.14s:  On the the variance.
4312.14s:  And when he when he bought this stuff.
4315.14s:  I don't know what the like the larger theory is.
4320.14s:  So this was on.
4323.14s:  21 July.
4325.14s:  Is that right.
4326.14s:  And then two June.
4328.14s:  Two June 24.
4330.14s:  And then this was like 21 July.
4333.14s:  I think 21 or April.
4334.14s:  I'm sorry.
4335.14s:  21 April.
4336.14s:  21.
4337.14s:  Something like that.
4350.14s:  Okay.
4352.14s:  So does the.
4353.14s:  Do you know if.
4354.14s:  If the community has.
4356.14s:  I like I haven't seen any like prior D.
4359.14s:  D or anything like that.
4361.14s:  I just don't know if anything like that exists.
4364.14s:  B. H. Mordek says I think Newton has a good breakdown.
4369.14s:  I looked at Newton's stuff.
4371.14s:  I think we looked at this together for the cat.
4374.14s:  I'm going to zoom out really far.
4381.14s:  I thought it was in here.
4390.14s:  Wait, I'm confused.
4394.14s:  No, not the R S.
4397.14s:  Where's his stuff.
4405.14s:  Wait, I'm so confused.
4408.14s:  I thought it was on this tab.
4410.14s:  Oh no, there was a tab called D.
4414.14s:  V.
4417.14s:  There's a we're missing a tab here.
4420.14s:  I got a text him.
4421.14s:  I was literally just texting him.
4423.14s:  Did he fucking get rid of D.
4426.14s:  V.
4431.14s:  Texting Newton.
4433.14s:  Quick question.
4435.14s:  Did you get rid of the D.
4438.14s:  V.
4439.14s:  Tab.
4445.14s:  Asking because I'm trying to understand the prevailing theory
4453.14s:  behind when he bought the how many options is it or how many
4460.14s:  shares 4.8 million when he bought the 4.8 million shares from his
4472.14s:  April 21 update is to June 24 update.
4486.14s:  Let's see what Newton says.
4497.14s:  Magnum says stock split in 22 price adjustment.
4500.14s:  Yeah, we would have to.
4502.14s:  Oh, that's a great point.
4503.14s:  Actually, great, great point.
4504.14s:  What was the split that happened in 22?
4513.14s:  2022 stock split and it's a 4 to 1.
4520.14s:  Okay, thanks equals this times 4.
4525.14s:  So then this equals this divided by 4.
4533.14s:  Okay, that's super helpful.
4535.14s:  Thank you guys.
4536.14s:  This was 2022 4 to 1.
4542.14s:  Great catch.
4544.14s:  See, this is this is why genuinely why I love doing this shit with you guys because you know stuff like this that I genuinely do not know.
4555.14s:  So this is going to be our summary stuff.
4557.14s:  So then really it's not that it equals this minus this 4.
4564.14s:  2 mil.
4565.14s:  I got to change that really quick.
4570.14s:  4.2 mil.
4575.14s:  Okay.
4579.14s:  All right.
4591.14s:  And it looks like.
4595.14s:  It looks like there's no general.
4597.14s:  Let me see if.
4598.14s:  Let me see if chat GPT can dig up any research on it.
4611.14s:  And then his basis then was 13, 7, 9, 4.
4618.14s:  And then he's going to be.
4633.14s:  Chat GPT is looking.
4636.14s:  I doubt it's going to find anything but I'm just trying.
4642.14s:  Well, that's running on the go grabs another drink or two because I'm super thirsty right now I'll be back.
4672.14s:  You
4702.14s:  You
4732.14s:  You
4762.14s:  Sun
4765.14s:  Some.
4769.14s:  But I too
4773.14s:  I
4774.02s:  Have
4777.14s:  About that game.
4778.14s:  A few moments longer than usual. But I thought the word
4781.14s:  Thaue
4784.14s:  The time would be well received because I went and got a guest for us new low
4790.14s:  We have the one and only Thor.
4793.98s:  He's coming into inspect.
4796.58s:  He wants to know when we're going to get to the bottom of this whole mystery.
4802.22s:  And you could tell he's very eager to get to those details.
4806.22s:  So Thor is ready to rock and roll.
4809.70s:  He's going to inspect what we're doing very carefully.
4812.90s:  There you go.
4820.14s:  All right.
4824.38s:  We're ready to.
4827.22s:  Ricky says Thor, one is GMM going to moon.
4830.66s:  When is Jimmy going to move?
4832.34s:  When it's going to go up?
4834.62s:  When is Jimmy going to go up?
4836.66s:  You know,
4840.42s:  what's it going to go up?
4842.30s:  We're going to have to come up with like a Thor equivalent of a magic eight ball.
4846.06s:  I'm not sure what it is.
4848.46s:  I try to get him to hold stuff sometimes.
4850.14s:  He's not really good at holding things.
4852.94s:  Hello.
4854.74s:  Yeah, it doesn't really like holding stuff.
4859.14s:  You would think he might.
4861.06s:  There's these little Tony paws.
4864.14s:  Ah,
4867.34s:  Oh boy.
4872.38s:  Okay.
4878.18s:  I always figure it's worth a couple extra seconds on the break time to grab, grab the union
4884.30s:  lead here.
4885.74s:  Also Norna's Thor.
4891.94s:  Robo says belly equals moon.
4893.58s:  I guess that's true because his tuxedo is very white.
4897.98s:  So maybe that's what he was indicating is that that went to the moon.
4902.42s:  Nifey says I just subbed about the content, but damn Thor is a sweet.
4905.82s:  Yeah, Thor, he's a straight homie.
4907.38s:  He's also, he's trained pretty well.
4909.26s:  Actually, I keep forgetting.
4910.70s:  I'll take a couple videos of him tonight on our walk, which his head just tilted when
4915.06s:  I said that because he, yeah, he's, I spent a while kind of teaching him different stuff
4921.02s:  that I think is some useful, some not.
4926.46s:  Nothing from Newton yet.
4927.86s:  So we will, we'll see what Newton, Newton has for us.
4933.98s:  I'll keep an eye on when he responds.
4943.10s:  Often says don't forget, RK had cash position, cost basis of two or four.
4948.46s:  Yeah, well, we'll take a look really quick.
4952.54s:  So the residual.
4954.54s:  So let's see.
4960.30s:  So this is equals this times this.
4967.30s:  So one, oh, sex.
4970.98s:  One, two, wait, what is this?
4975.98s:  One, two, seven, four, yeah.
4987.82s:  So then his cost basis here is what, 22, four, seven, oh, eight, which this equals.
5000.26s:  22, four, seven, oh, eight, that's on the delta shares.
5009.86s:  Oh, man, this is tricky.
5027.70s:  24 mil.
5034.10s:  Robo says.
5037.74s:  Newton's video touched on an RK exercise into force naked shorts to buy.
5042.22s:  When do we think he exercised from that video, Robo?
5049.54s:  We can take a look at that.
5051.34s:  So you mean on this most recent one or when in May, when in May, when in May, when in
5069.26s:  May, buy in May, go away, sell in May, go away, there's also a saying that goes along with
5074.34s:  may of some shit, some about may.
5077.26s:  Yeah, if you guys let me know, well, Robo, if you can take a look at the video at some
5084.26s:  point, let me know and we can take a look.
5086.98s:  The reason why I think this happened here is because everything was caught completely
5092.46s:  off sides.
5093.46s:  That's what I think because we started seeing volume ramping in the stock.
5099.78s:  And let's take a look at the options markets from one to 10 May, one to 10 May.
5117.02s:  And let's get rid of, we'll keep the bids for now.
5119.34s:  It doesn't really matter.
5121.62s:  May 10 May 17.
5124.38s:  So this is a big part of what I think happened here.
5134.82s:  Let me get rid of the restriction on the 20s.
5154.38s:  You know who that looks like.
5162.98s:  The thing that I don't think aligns well is the duration because this is like 11 days.
5177.58s:  But let's take a look.
5178.58s:  We now have references.
5181.94s:  Let's take a look at some of his old work and see if he bought like really short dated
5186.50s:  options like that.
5195.02s:  So this looks like all exits this we can get rid of.
5207.58s:  I'm going to add a column here.
5211.50s:  And then I also, I want to go back to the beginning because we started from like one step here.
5216.62s:  So let me, let me finish satiating this desire.
5222.06s:  What I want to do is I'm just going to add a column like when he bought options because
5228.42s:  Newton already has somewhere where stock was bought.
5231.46s:  I know that that was done.
5234.62s:  So I'm not going to replicate him adding stock plus we can also see when some of it changes.
5240.30s:  But I want to specifically look at the options because there's not a ton of times that he
5245.02s:  did it.
5246.50s:  So this should be.
5248.62s:  This should be pretty fast.
5249.62s:  Flip through.
5263.62s:  Because I started building this tracker after we had looked at a couple of these.
5271.46s:  Okay.
5272.46s:  So here's the beginning.
5274.22s:  This was eight step 2019.
5280.62s:  These I'm going to change the format because I want the year to be included since we're going
5298.42s:  back so far.
5300.46s:  Custom.
5301.46s:  There we go.
5308.30s:  What the fuck?
5315.30s:  I don't care where Jimmy was.
5327.14s:  So total gain from the starting point.
5335.86s:  I think there might be a couple updates.
5338.10s:  So I'll start this one up here.
5340.46s:  So total gain was 40.
5344.74s:  6 4 3 3.
5348.94s:  9 6.
5349.94s:  Cash.
5350.94s:  I'm going to slide this over a little bit.
5354.42s:  You guys won't be able to see some of it, but that's okay.
5357.34s:  Cash in the account was 13962.
5363.34s:  9 6 2 13962.21.
5367.34s:  Value is 113962.21.
5371.34s:  Okay.
5373.54s:  So these I'm just going to copy up.
5383.54s:  Oops.
5392.14s:  And then here we're going to start with what he had.
5396.38s:  So here he's holding 15 Jan 21 calls.
5413.50s:  And his basis was 53 cents total.
5429.02s:  So then add this and then this will be option trade.
5437.82s:  So this is already holding.
5442.66s:  So there's no trade that I'm going to flag for this.
5445.38s:  This is just what he's holding.
5449.86s:  And the thing that I want to track here.
5455.42s:  This will be basis.
5458.62s:  This will be.
5462.62s:  Okay.
5471.34s:  So here's the 15 or it's let's do.
5482.62s:  Expiration.
5484.62s:  Right.
5489.62s:  So here we have 15 Jan 21.
5496.38s:  Strike price is the eight.
5500.02s:  Vases is 0.53.
5503.18s:  And then DTE is pretty simple, which will just be this minus the post date.
5512.78s:  It's what he has to start, which is already kind of interesting.
5519.78s:  Okay.
5523.78s:  Let's eat.
5528.78s:  This is 11, 17, 11, 17,
5546.54s:  EG.
5550.20s:  46, 433.96.
5555.18s:  Damn, I thought we were dealt with this part.
5556.94s:  I didn't realize that I started so late.
5559.42s:  I thought there was only a couple that I was going to have to do.
5561.26s:  But it looks like, I don't know how many times he posted 113962.21.
5568.54s:  And then there were no trades, no options trades.
5573.90s:  Okay.
5574.90s:  Cool.
5575.90s:  11 step. Oh, okay, cool. Yeah, I don't think there's a ton then. This one is 30
5585.90s:  step. 2019. Okay. GG. GG was 62.433.96. Passes 112.4.98. Value is 11712.
5615.90s:  4.98. And 1000 at 53. Oh, I forgot. I could absolutely add size. Didn't I? Size is 1000.
5630.64s:  And then we'll add another one here just because it'll calculate it automatically. No work
5637.92s:  off our back this times this times 100. So no change still.
5655.42s:  October 31 oct 2019 31 oct 2019. GG 51 933.96.
5681.00s:  Pass is 1193 9.05. Value is 117.439.05. Okay. And there's no change to his option still.
5702.22s:  So the first thing I'm seeing is I'm going to add another column here preemptively, which
5712.52s:  is going to be a DTE at management. Because what I want to track here is the DTE that he
5724.16s:  runs when he starts is massive. Right. So he's starting at 495 days, which is obviously
5736.62s:  a really, really, really significant. These are I'm just going to kill all of that. Is it's
5748.72s:  not going to have like any variant stuff to offer me? So there's 31 oct. Yeah. Okay. So
5753.52s:  this will be super quick. How many days are in November 29? Is that right? There's more than 29 days
5760.68s:  in November. He's just been. No. Okay. So TG 176.433.96.
5781.76s:  Asch 628.66. Value 23628.66. Okay. And no changes. Okay.
5809.20s:  11.19. James says November 30. Thank you. I never there was like a knuckle thing you could
5822.56s:  do. But I never I never knew anything about that knuckle thing. TG here is 21882.38.
5833.20s:  And I'm going to have a look at the cash 577.02. Value is 83 077.02. This will be also
5844.12s:  really interesting. I'm going to plot the change in portfolio value. That's going to be a
5853.80s:  really, really interesting. Visual. Off Poon says arcade bought is very last long call.
5865.88s:  First campaign on 31. That first trading day after it was veal through SEC that co-inid
5878.60s:  bought a 9% state got it. Okay. So let's see. That's 11 days. I'm assuming there would
5886.48s:  be a month thing. 31 D's 31 D's 19. TG 21 529.17. Damn it. 21 529.17. Ash 22 300.
5912.56s:  1 3. Oh, this is perfect. Because there's some movements and options. 11 2 900.13. Eager to see
5922.88s:  what these are. All right. So let's see what changed in these options. Shall we? I don't know why
5931.92s:  it would stop there. So it's this one. So we sold 400 of the 15 Jan 21s. Okay. So this
5947.08s:  we are going to have to had sold 400 15 Jan 21 calls added 21. Okay. This is useful.
5964.84s:  20. This is super useful. 21 Feb 21 8 calls at 8 calls 0.19. We're going to have to check
5988.20s:  the DTE. Because that's what two months from this. Yeah. I'll just add it in a second. Then
6000.36s:  the 17 April 10 calls. We added 400 of these 17 April 10 calls. We added 400 of those.
6015.32s:  At 0.20. And then he added 17 July 12 calls. 600. And those were done for 0.18.
6045.56s:  And then I'll add one other note here so that he's still holding. He has the 15 Jan 21.
6063.48s:  8 calls.
6067.96s:  4 notes 600 of those. And that's at 0.4417. Okay. So this I'm going to have to this is kind of an annoying
6082.28s:  series of trades just because there's a bunch that happened there. But what I'm going to do is
6088.84s:  track the DTE for the closest. And then for what he added. So here the closest is 15 Jan 21.
6099.96s:  And it is 31 December 2020. So 31 Ds 2020. And then 15 Jan 21.
6115.32s:  And as this. He's holding these with 15 DTE.
6120.76s:  Okay.
6127.24s:  Make sure I'm on the right one. I have to go down one row.
6137.80s:  Okay. So this is fascinating. So we added 21 Feb.
6145.96s:  He added 52 DTE.
6154.12s:  So we add here.
6160.92s:  52 DTE.
6165.96s:  17 April.
6169.00s:  107 DTE.
6182.36s:  And then 17 July.
6187.16s:  17 July.
6187.96s:  198 DTE.
6199.80s:  And then these are.
6211.16s:  15 we said 15 Jan 21. Yeah. 15.
6215.72s:  So these are 15 DTE.
6223.72s:  Okay. I'm just reorganizing some of the.
6234.04s:  Some of the numbers here. So normally the lot size goes in the beginning.
6238.12s:  I'm just going to keep that standard.
6240.68s:  Throughout this whole thing. So it's easier to track.
6243.08s:  And then I'll be able to track all the DTEs despite the fact that there's.
6250.04s:  I don't love this format, but it'll work for us.
6256.60s:  Okay.
6262.76s:  So these I'm actually just going to kill these rows. 15 Jan 21s.
6268.44s:  And that was on 8 September 19.
6272.20s:  So 8 September 19.
6277.64s:  495. I'm just going to keep the same format.
6281.80s:  Holding.
6283.64s:  1000.
6288.20s:  15 Jan 21 calls.
6293.00s:  15 Jan 21.
6295.40s:  These are the eight calls.
6303.24s:  45.
6307.16s:  DTE.
6310.52s:  0.53.
6313.24s:  And then these are just going to kill for now.
6319.80s:  Okay. So let's D's.
6322.28s:  And 14 Jan 14 Jan 21.
6333.32s:  EG.
6335.48s:  I'm glad.
6337.32s:  I'm glad that this is going to be holistic.
6339.88s:  So there's the main benefit to going back and fill in this end.
6346.84s:  This should be 14 Jan 20.
6349.24s:  And there shouldn't be too many more.
6352.36s:  A little gain.
6354.92s:  Negative.
6356.60s:  34 829.
6359.64s:  03.
6363.08s:  Cash.
6364.60s:  6441.9.
6369.16s:  Value.
6370.20s:  56 541.9.
6376.04s:  All right. Let's see what's changed here.
6378.44s:  17.
6382.44s:  Okay.
6384.28s:  So this is.
6389.56s:  This is interesting.
6392.68s:  This is really interesting.
6394.52s:  Oh, this is very exciting.
6396.28s:  Yeah. So there is absolutely evidence of him.
6401.56s:  There's absolutely evidence of him buying
6404.68s:  super shady cheap out of the money options.
6408.60s:  That are very short DTE.
6413.16s:  So we bought to open.
6416.20s:  200.
6419.00s:  17 Jan 20.
6425.32s:  Which is 3 DTE.
6431.24s:  And that was done for 0.03.
6435.48s:  Okay.
6437.48s:  That's so cool.
6438.28s:  Very, very cool.
6439.80s:  So then he's still holding 21 fab.
6449.88s:  I'm going to do no change.
6451.80s:  Otherwise.
6456.28s:  And then 16 April.
6458.76s:  Do we have those in here?
6462.04s:  17 April.
6465.32s:  Oh, how do I.
6470.76s:  I want this to.
6473.72s:  There we go.
6477.08s:  17 July.
6484.04s:  So he still has the Jan 15s.
6495.96s:  But it looks like those 16 April 21s were added.
6502.68s:  Yeah, because those weren't there before.
6507.40s:  So here he bought to open.
6510.36s:  516 April 21.
6516.92s:  12 calls.
6518.12s:  18 April 21.
6524.04s:  The expiration here is 16 April 21.
6529.80s:  The day of this update is 14 Jan 14 Jan 20.
6538.36s:  458 days.
6542.20s:  458 DTE.
6545.08s:  And this was done for.
6547.80s:  60 sons.
6550.60s:  Okay.
6553.32s:  And okay.
6558.36s:  So now he has some 3 DTE options here.
6567.24s:  Here the closest DTE.
6569.72s:  This isn't 15.
6573.72s:  These are way longer.
6574.92s:  This should be 15 Jan 21 from 31 D's 19.
6587.32s:  15 Jan 21 from 31 D's 19.
6591.48s:  391 DTE.
6595.80s:  391.
6597.96s:  And what I'm going to do is change this.
6603.40s:  So that the order remains the same compared to his updates.
6610.36s:  So now the closest thing he has to expiration in this bundle is 58 52 DTE.
6621.16s:  So this is Ricky says yay.
6624.52s:  Question mark.
6625.40s:  Yeah.
6626.04s:  So the reason why this is very exciting to see is because I can clearly identify
6632.84s:  this is the first time I've seen him buy really short dated options, which means it's much less
6640.60s:  of a departure for him to do this kind of thing as as compared to if he never did this sort of
6648.04s:  thing. So the fact that this is part of it actually is really really cool to me.
6653.56s:  So it is yay.
6654.68s:  It's actually a pretty big yay for me at least.
6658.12s:  This is 31 Jan 2020.
6660.84s:  So 31 Jan 2020.
6665.56s:  TG.
6668.28s:  Negative 4 A 1 2 5.
6673.64s:  7 5.
6675.64s:  Cash here is 6441.99.
6681.24s:  Value is 42.
6684.20s:  541.99.
6691.88s:  I'm going to release the how and really quick so that Mel can feed him.
6704.12s:  Okay.
6716.20s:  All right.
6717.16s:  So let's take a look at what happened here.
6722.12s:  We are now.
6723.00s:  Now.
6731.08s:  The 17 Jan 21s are gone for 17 Jan 20s 17 Jan 20.
6740.60s:  Looks like.
6744.44s:  I don't know what GameStop was trading for.
6746.20s:  I'm going to go out on a.
6751.00s:  Wild guess here.
6753.32s:  And assume that they expired.
6754.84s:  I'm an idiot and I didn't catch the.
6759.64s:  The strike price from before.
6764.12s:  Over these seven calls.
6774.12s:  Yeah, I'm going to guess that it didn't get there.
6775.96s:  Is that correct?
6777.24s:  Vladimir says expired.
6778.92s:  Can anybody corroborate.
6782.76s:  This is January 2021.
6788.04s:  All food and said just look at his cash and cost basis they expired.
6795.24s:  Yeah, let's take a look.
6800.36s:  So here.
6803.96s:  Cash no change.
6805.56s:  Yep, agreed.
6808.12s:  So 17 Jan 20 these expired.
6813.08s:  Worthless.
6816.28s:  And then 400 600 600 500.
6829.64s:  400 400 600 600
6840.84s:  500.
6841.72s:  Yep, okay.
6845.16s:  Other than that, no change.
6851.80s:  So then the closest DTE now would be those February 21s.
6858.12s:  So 21, February 21.
6862.52s:  And then he has the.
6865.96s:  What is this update 31 Jan 31 Jan.
6872.60s:  21.
6873.08s:  21.
6873.72s:  Wait, those are 21s.
6875.72s:  20s.
6878.76s:  21.
6879.56s:  21 DTE.
6880.76s:  So now he's at 21 DTE for the near term.
6885.96s:  Okay.
6887.88s:  So now let's add another.
6890.92s:  Another one.
6893.08s:  Ed.
6895.16s:  This one is what 28 29 29.
6899.40s:  So that's the end.
6901.32s:  So let's add the next one.
6903.32s:  And then we have the next one.
6905.32s:  So let's add the next one.
6907.32s:  So let's add the next one.
6909.32s:  Okay.
6911.32s:  Okay.
6913.32s:  And.
6915.32s:  Man, this is so fucking interesting.
6917.32s:  EG negative 42377.39.
6923.32s:  Hash 183.
6927.32s:  83 value 44483.
6933.32s:  383.
6935.32s:  All this stuff drops down.
6941.32s:  And really the main thing I want to see here now.
6947.32s:  Okay. 17 April.
6949.32s:  We had 21 DTE.
6953.32s:  He did have something in fab.
6957.32s:  So we had the 21 fab.
6959.32s:  This should be 20.
6965.32s:  So we had the 21 fab.
6969.32s:  20.
6971.32s:  And.
6977.32s:  Those were the eight calls.
6981.32s:  2528 calls.
6987.32s:  And what's happened here?
6997.32s:  He's been in the first place.
7001.32s:  Passes down.
7003.32s:  So he spent money.
7009.32s:  Glad says sold those 21 fab for 4K.
7017.32s:  I don't think you can't.
7019.32s:  I don't think it's possible for you to confirm that.
7025.32s:  So.
7031.32s:  Yeah.
7037.32s:  That's tricky.
7039.32s:  I don't have glad.
7041.32s:  How are you?
7043.32s:  10,000 to 5820 for the.
7047.32s:  Yeah, it's not that simple though.
7049.32s:  Because at this point, he's moving money in and out of the account regularly.
7053.32s:  So.
7057.32s:  So.
7061.32s:  And again, to your point, you could have sold those.
7065.32s:  And actually we can take a look at it.
7067.32s:  We can see what the maximum value would have been.
7071.32s:  And.
7073.32s:  We can see what the maximum value would have been.
7077.32s:  And.
7079.32s:  But look at the going price for those contracts.
7081.32s:  Yeah, let's do that.
7083.32s:  So this was the 21 fab 28.
7089.32s:  Let's take a look.
7093.32s:  Let's go to 21.
7095.32s:  Oh, yeah, okay.
7097.32s:  21 fab.
7107.32s:  And well, now I have to go back a little bit.
7117.32s:  When did.
7123.32s:  That was the end of Jan.
7127.32s:  And he still had them.
7129.32s:  And then the end of fab they're gone.
7131.32s:  So it would have been between Jan and fab.
7135.32s:  And this is the fab 21s.
7141.32s:  So let's take a look at.
7146.32s:  Here 21 fab.
7149.32s:  And.
7159.32s:  400 of the eight.
7163.32s:  400.
7167.32s:  Those position wasn't there.
7171.32s:  When did he well doesn't matter because he had them at the end of January.
7177.32s:  So we can look at the end of January.
7183.32s:  So the last they traded it doesn't matter.
7185.32s:  So the next time they traded after January was.
7189.32s:  A volume of four of 18 fed.
7193.32s:  The 19 fed there is another volume of four.
7197.32s:  And then there's no transactions until 21 fed.
7201.32s:  So off Putin I don't think you're correct.
7205.32s:  Because there's no volume.
7207.32s:  It looks like they expired worthless to me.
7209.32s:  And my guess is he added money.
7215.32s:  Because the going rate for the contracts.
7222.32s:  There's no volume.
7224.32s:  So maybe we go later in the day.
7227.32s:  And since.
7229.32s:  Yeah, but Putin you're you're missing my point here.
7239.32s:  My point is there's no volume.
7249.32s:  Like there's no again.
7251.32s:  Following his fab update here.
7257.32s:  There's no volume.
7259.32s:  Is the so that that's what's confusing me here.
7263.32s:  I don't see how you're drawing that.
7266.32s:  I don't see how you're drawing that the eights came down.
7271.32s:  For 10 cents because I don't see any volume for those eights.
7284.32s:  So yeah.
7287.32s:  That would be helpful to understand.
7290.32s:  Because what I like from what I see now.
7293.32s:  From the last point he updated.
7296.32s:  There were essentially no changes.
7301.32s:  To the position.
7303.32s:  And then from what I can see here, there was no volume.
7311.32s:  And I don't see any volume for the last 10 cents.
7322.32s:  Hence, hence my supreme confusion here.
7327.32s:  Let's see what it looked like in this time period.
7331.32s:  We got to grab the crowd favorite Yahoo Finance.
7338.32s:  I'm not going to be talking about this.
7348.32s:  No, they're not.
7350.32s:  What are you talking about, dude?
7353.32s:  These are 21 feb 20.
7354.32s:  Oh, you're saying the ones I'm looking at.
7356.32s:  Wait, no, I'm not.
7357.32s:  Yo.
7358.32s:  Glad you got to give me a break here.
7360.32s:  You know that I am a I'm a simpleton.
7362.32s:  Yeah.
7363.32s:  Okay.
7364.32s:  You can't confuse me.
7365.32s:  I'm easily confused.
7366.32s:  It's like, it's like doing magic on a child.
7372.32s:  I'm very easily confused.
7374.32s:  It can happen in moments.
7378.32s:  Alright, so we're looking in 2020.
7384.32s:  We're looking in feb.
7388.32s:  Let's zoom in.
7389.32s:  Yeah.
7395.32s:  So those look like they expired worthless, man.
7401.32s:  What is it?
7402.32s:  Two dilutions or does this account for the dilutions?
7405.32s:  Does it?
7406.32s:  Do you know if Yahoo Finance automatically updates the old chart?
7410.32s:  I think toss does.
7416.32s:  Matt says, brother, kitty is a plant.
7418.32s:  Your math isn't off.
7420.32s:  What?
7421.32s:  What does that mean though?
7422.32s:  Like what is the what is that theory behind the cat being a plant?
7428.32s:  I've heard other people say that before, but I don't understand the I don't understand the argument.
7434.32s:  Like what's the what's the point of that?
7438.32s:  Of the cat being a plant.
7446.32s:  But yeah, based on what I see here so far at least this looks like those expired
7451.32s:  worthless.
7456.32s:  I'll double check in a second, but that's what it looks like.
7462.32s:  So now the closest expiration that he has.
7469.32s:  From this update on 29th.
7475.32s:  That Lawrence is a plant like a firm.
7478.32s:  I love firms too.
7479.32s:  So fun fact, I have a plant called Mr Burns that I've taken with me everywhere.
7485.32s:  It's a piece of my dad's plant who's dead now.
7490.32s:  And I still it's it's come with me everywhere.
7493.32s:  And I actually have pieces of Mr Burns that I've left all different kinds of places.
7500.32s:  As because they it's the aloe vera grows like a mother.
7503.32s:  So then you have to like cut little pieces off to take a little piece with you because it's too big to take the rest of it.
7508.32s:  And yeah, that Lawrence says you named your plant.
7512.32s:  Yeah, I named it Mr Burns because I remember I burned the shit out of my hand playing with fire as a young child.
7521.32s:  When when I was with my dad, we did a lot of hood rat shit.
7525.32s:  So Mr Burns helped me a lot with the series of different burns that I've had.
7533.32s:  So yeah, 100%.
7536.32s:  Cemicrition says I name my cars. I used to name my motorcycles, but I haven't named any of my cars yet.
7542.32s:  I don't know why.
7545.32s:  But Mr Burns is an OG.
7549.32s:  Cedric says the theory is that there's a rico case going on to catch all stock manipulation and he works for the state, but what?
7560.32s:  I don't understand that at all.
7563.32s:  Yeah, that argument wouldn't make any sense. I would love to hear Matt's argument or like what his position is.
7568.32s:  So I just don't understand it.
7572.32s:  Lance says could cause a lot of retail to FOMO in and lose tons and premiums for worthless contracts.
7578.32s:  Now that at least I could understand the incentive there.
7581.32s:  Again, I I think that it's a really, really silly theory to be completely honest.
7587.32s:  Just because even in that scenario, hedge funds can make or not even hedge funds, but market making firms hedge funds institutions can make so much more money than what they could conceivably pull from retail by, you know, playing little games like that.
7607.32s:  So I struggle.
7612.32s:  I struggle with it from that perspective, but.
7617.32s:  Nifey says why would he stream to 600 people in claim it's just him working alone?
7624.32s:  I don't understand. What does that mean? Why would he stream to 600,000 people in claim it's just him working alone?
7632.32s:  I mean, what?
7634.32s:  Could you explain that to me? I don't understand that argument either.
7644.32s:  Yeah, I don't.
7649.32s:  Okay, got it. I was super confused.
7654.32s:  Matt says not saying he's not a phenomenal trader, but he drops his tweets to the minute of when price action violently hits.
7663.32s:  No one can know when volume. Oh, I see what you mean.
7667.32s:  I actually think you're looking at that backwards to be honest.
7671.32s:  Right. I don't think that he is dropping tweets right ahead of when something moves.
7679.32s:  Most of what I see so far is when he tweets now, which is important to know. I mean, let's take a look at it.
7687.32s:  I'm down for a fucking.
7690.32s:  It's a field trip. Let me finish.
7693.32s:  Deb.
7695.32s:  Any more do we have.
7697.32s:  April. Okay, perfect. Yeah, this is going to go fast. Let me finish this.
7700.32s:  And then let's do an analysis on when the cat tweets and what game stop price did.
7706.32s:  Can one of you do me a huge favor and can one of you grab a list of dates that he tweeted from 2020 to presents.
7722.32s:  We can pick random dates.
7724.32s:  And what I'm going to do is I'm literally going to download game stop data.
7728.32s:  And I'm going to do minute level data for those specific days.
7733.32s:  And then we'll look at price behavior like to literally to the minute.
7738.32s:  I just need a list of dates to look for tweets. And I don't want like cherry pick dates.
7742.32s:  I don't want you to pick a date where he tweeted and we know it moved.
7746.32s:  I know that happened recently a couple times.
7749.32s:  I think it would be good to do it a little bit like sporadic picking random dates.
7754.32s:  I tell you test these kinds of things, but I just don't have an archive of like, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7760.32s:  I think Newton does. This could be perfect. Hold on.
7764.32s:  Does this have dates.
7769.32s:  Posted date.
7774.32s:  Oh, fuck Newton.
7778.32s:  Newton fucking breaks my balls at this stuff.
7782.32s:  The formatting in his Google sheets makes it so difficult to analyze data.
7793.32s:  Matt says not saying he's not a phenomenal trader. No one can know.
7797.32s:  Yeah, we'll take a look, Matt. I don't think.
7800.32s:  Yeah, I think that based on what I understand in like what I've seen, I do think that that's reversed.
7809.32s:  They say, hey, look, because the other thing is, again, like, if he was tweeting right before that there's a move, that would literally get caught onto so fast, like so fast.
7823.32s:  1, 2, 2, .5, 9.
7827.32s:  Passes 1, 1, 7, 3, 5, 6, .8, 3.
7832.82s:  Values 2, 1, 5, 5, 8, 9, .3, 3.
7839.14s:  And let's drag these down.
7844.00s:  Any changes here?
7845.00s:  All right.
7852.64s:  All right.
7852.92s:  I'm going to do myself a huge favor.
7854.60s:  This is going to be a little bit annoying for a second,
7856.84s:  but I think it's going to be worth it.
7864.60s:  Oh, I want a little extreme there.
7868.96s:  So there's 1,000.
7873.28s:  OK, so this is the first trade.
7882.32s:  So here, sold to close, 400, 15, 2, 1 calls.
7893.16s:  What I'm doing is I'm just reformatting this
7901.44s:  so that it'll be much easier to look at all of this stuff
7906.32s:  going forward.
7917.32s:  So here, he bought to open.
7923.84s:  Here, he bought to open.
7931.44s:  And then here, he bought to, oh, perfect.
7944.12s:  So what I'm going to do is now I can essentially track all of these,
7950.40s:  which will be much easier.
7955.12s:  I bought to open their water for open here.
7972.04s:  What sizes do we want all this exercise to iron 9?
7980.56s:  No, that wasn'arn't it?
7984.60s:  Why is this all fucked up?
7990.60s:  That's so annoying.
7996.60s:  Okay, so here, I'm actually going to add more.
8003.60s:  So then what I'm going to be able to do is look at all these different positions
8010.60s:  and track when they're open and closed like this.
8017.60s:  17 Jan
8021.60s:  These
8027.60s:  17 Jan 20
8031.60s:  21 calls
8037.60s:  or the eight calls. Wait, what fucking calls are these?
8041.60s:  I don't remember.
8044.60s:  When was this?
8046.60s:  Let's get it right. It was 3D to E.
8053.60s:  Wait.
8055.60s:  I'm fucked up. Oh, here we go.
8058.60s:  I got it. I got it. I got it.
8060.60s:  Everybody relax.
8064.60s:  I got it.
8066.60s:  That's that. Okay, perfect.
8068.60s:  So these go over here.
8075.60s:  So the 17 Jan
8078.60s:  20 seven calls.
8087.60s:  Those expired worthless. Got it.
8089.60s:  I
8096.60s:  Okay.
8099.60s:  So
8101.60s:  Damn, need more water.
8111.60s:  So now
8113.60s:  there was another that expired worthless.
8118.60s:  Is that what we were just talking about right now?
8124.60s:  Where we at we are at 30 April.
8132.60s:  This is from the Fed update.
8135.60s:  I just want to confirm the positions I had for them for Fed.
8143.60s:  So we sold to close
8148.60s:  400 and then he
8151.60s:  holds
8154.60s:  600 of those 21s.
8157.60s:  Okay.
8159.60s:  Good.
8162.60s:  Okay.
8164.60s:  Then
8166.60s:  Fab has gone April
8168.60s:  July.
8169.60s:  So we're missing some positions here.
8172.60s:  I
8174.60s:  know.
8178.60s:  Who's this one for 14 Jan 2020.
8185.60s:  This post is from Fed.
8192.60s:  Date here.
8196.60s:  29 Fed. This is down here.
8200.60s:  And
8203.60s:  let's go to Jan.
8205.60s:  This is right.
8207.60s:  This is row 10.
8208.60s:  Okay.
8211.60s:  So here.
8215.60s:  21 Fed.
8221.60s:  Here.
8226.60s:  This belongs here.
8230.60s:  This belongs here.
8236.60s:  Do we have April?
8238.60s:  Yes.
8239.60s:  And calls.
8240.60s:  Yes. So this belongs here.
8243.60s:  July 12 calls.
8244.60s:  Longs here.
8247.60s:  He still has the same.
8249.60s:  Here.
8250.60s:  No change.
8252.60s:  And then.
8255.60s:  16 April.
8257.60s:  So these belong further down.
8262.60s:  Here.
8264.60s:  Okay.
8265.60s:  Cool.
8271.60s:  So now.
8275.60s:  This is Jan.
8276.60s:  So now we go to 29 Fed.
8280.60s:  Here. Perfect.
8282.60s:  29 Fed.
8288.60s:  We still have.
8292.60s:  These.
8296.60s:  21 Fed's look like they're gone.
8304.60s:  Yeah.
8305.60s:  21 Fed 20 calls.
8307.60s:  So these are gone.
8309.60s:  So 21.
8312.60s:  Fed 20.
8317.60s:  8 calls.
8321.60s:  Fired.
8323.60s:  Worthless.
8326.60s:  And then.
8334.60s:  What else did he do at the end of Fed?
8338.60s:  Which end of Fed is.
8341.60s:  11.
8343.60s:  Let's go here.
8346.60s:  Then he has April 17.
8348.60s:  So he still has those.
8351.60s:  The lie has those January has those.
8359.60s:  Then he has April 16.
8361.60s:  Okay. Cool.
8362.60s:  So that's good.
8368.60s:  And now let's go up here.
8372.60s:  April.
8376.60s:  So now April is the 30th.
8379.60s:  And this is where we left off.
8381.60s:  Great.
8383.60s:  So.
8385.60s:  July 17th 20.
8388.60s:  I don't know where these go.
8394.60s:  Oh, right here.
8395.60s:  Yeah.
8396.60s:  That goes there with 3DT.
8398.60s:  Okay.
8399.60s:  Cool.
8400.60s:  So that's good.
8406.60s:  July is here.
8408.60s:  So that still exists.
8413.60s:  Is a 6 and a 12.
8419.60s:  So then he bought.
8422.60s:  What is this on.
8426.60s:  30.
8428.60s:  Well, between this update for 30 April.
8431.60s:  He bought.
8439.60s:  17 July 6 calls.
8446.60s:  So here.
8448.60s:  He bought.
8449.60s:  Open.
8451.60s:  About to open.
8453.60s:  About to open.
8458.60s:  Of food.
8459.60s:  And says he sold.
8461.60s:  What do you mean he sold?
8463.60s:  He didn't sell.
8465.60s:  You mean like the total number.
8470.60s:  Because he had 600 of the 12's.
8475.60s:  that came down to 500. So he sold.
8480.76s:  He sold it looks like 100 of those. I'm looking at these six calls.
8486.88s:  Because those look like that got added. Let's go back here real quick to check.
8493.24s:  Yeah. So those got added.
8496.56s:  No, fuck me out, man. I told you, I'm highly, highly susceptible to getting completely fucked up.
8505.60s:  So here he now.
8511.28s:  What to open.
8515.44s:  No, he didn't sell 100. What are you talking about?
8519.20s:  They didn't exist before.
8520.56s:  So,
8521.60s:  watch with me.
8523.12s:  Here.
8524.12s:  I'm going to go back to my phone.
8526.12s:  I'm going to go back to my phone.
8527.64s:  I'm going to go back to my phone.
8529.64s:  I'm going to go back to my phone.
8531.64s:  I'm going to go back to my phone.
8534.64s:  There's no six call. There's none of them.
8538.64s:  10, 12, 8, 12.
8542.64s:  There's no six call. Doesn't exist.
8544.64s:  No six call and a fed.
8549.64s:  We get here to end of April. There is now a six call right there.
8556.64s:  Bro, look at 414, yolo.
8570.64s:  Great catch.
8576.64s:  Necky snake.
8579.64s:  So we added the sixes on the 14th.
8582.64s:  So we missed an entire day because of that sneaky little update.
8586.64s:  Great catch.
8588.64s:  So this is 14 April.
8591.64s:  20.
8595.64s:  So TG is 1, 2, 7, 8, 6, 9.
8603.64s:  I got 39.
8604.64s:  I,
8605.64s:  Passes 103,
8608.64s:  857,
8611.64s:  that one, 2.
8613.64s:  Value is 298,
8616.64s:  394.62.
8619.64s:  Perfect.
8620.64s:  Yeah. Great catch.
8621.64s:  I totally missed this entire update from this entire series because that was a fucking sneaky thing that completely was different from all the other ones.
8632.64s:  So fantastic.
8635.64s:  Okay.
8638.64s:  So,
8641.64s:  Let's take a look at the positions.
8646.64s:  So the jans are gone.
8651.64s:  So we sold to close. That right.
8656.64s:  This looks like he sold to close or exited.
8661.64s:  No, these would have been sold to close.
8664.64s:  So it took close 600.
8667.64s:  That right.
8669.64s:  That just seems so off.
8672.64s:  15 Jan 21.
8679.64s:  Is the.
8686.64s:  All Putin says sold for 83.
8689.64s:  You can't.
8690.64s:  I'm going to keep telling you, man, like you can't determine that.
8696.64s:  Because the problem is is we don't know what cash is being added or removed from the account.
8703.64s:  So you can't look at.
8706.64s:  You can postulate.
8709.64s:  It's completely okay to say I think.
8712.64s:  But it is not okay to say sold.
8715.64s:  For ex number of dollars.
8718.64s:  Because we don't know that.
8722.64s:  Okay.
8724.64s:  So the 15 jans are now off.
8727.64s:  So I'm going to.
8737.64s:  I'm going to fill this is like a closing trade.
8741.64s:  That I can use the same columns.
8744.64s:  I want all of these to not wrap.
8749.64s:  Or to not expand.
8751.64s:  Okay.
8752.64s:  This is just going to make it way easier for me to find stuff.
8755.64s:  So these are still here.
8756.64s:  The 10 calls are still there.
8758.64s:  17 July 12 calls are still there.
8762.64s:  And then he bought to open some new ones.
8765.64s:  But these are still here.
8768.64s:  Okay.
8771.64s:  So.
8774.64s:  When did he do these?
8779.64s:  The 17 Jan 20s.
8783.64s:  I need to go back.
8787.64s:  And fix those.
8790.64s:  Oops.
8795.64s:  17 Jan 20s.
8799.64s:  That would have been here.
8809.64s:  Nope.
8812.64s:  Well, 31. Thank you.
8815.64s:  Where's the December.
8820.64s:  That's January.
8821.64s:  Okay.
8825.64s:  Here we go. Thank you.
8828.64s:  I'm going to go back.
8834.64s:  No, he didn't get those here.
8838.64s:  He had the 15 jans.
8842.64s:  So then I think it's here.
8844.64s:  14 Jan. Yeah, that's it.
8846.64s:  Okay.
8847.64s:  So 14 Jan.
8851.64s:  Is this one.
8856.64s:  So here.
8860.64s:  I need to add another row.
8874.64s:  So here he bought to open these 3DT.
8883.64s:  And then this is the one that over here.
8890.64s:  Okay.
8891.64s:  And then this on his next update end of Jan.
8897.64s:  Which would have been the 10th on the or the row.
8901.64s:  This one.
8902.64s:  Perfect.
8903.64s:  Okay, cool.
8906.64s:  We are.
8909.64s:  Okay.
8912.64s:  Okay.
8915.64s:  All right.
8918.64s:  Let me get caught up on the ideas.
8923.64s:  Jonathan says as far as when we look at the timing entry,
8927.64s:  I don't think it's a Jesse special information.
8930.64s:  Yeah, I completely agree.
8933.64s:  I do not think he has any sort of special information based on what I see so far.
8937.64s:  I also shout out to the chat.
8939.64s:  There's 69 people in here, which is quite literally the exact correct number of people for this series.
8947.64s:  It would, again, it would be great to have 169.
8949.64s:  That would be that would be like dream material for me.
8953.64s:  But I love the fact that it's 69.
8956.64s:  So yeah, really, really stoked.
8958.64s:  Tim 70.
8960.64s:  Well, I'm glad somebody else joined, but I'm a little, I'm a little bummed because we had a,
8965.64s:  we had a perfect arrangement just one moment ago.
8968.64s:  I am sending Mel her dinner order before she murders me.
8973.64s:  Because she likes to wait for me to eat, but obviously,
8978.64s:  these go, however, I always tell her to like these are going to go, however long they're going to go.
8983.64s:  I don't think anybody has any control.
8985.64s:  I don't have any control over it.
8986.64s:  I don't think you have any control over it.
8988.64s:  I think it just kind of happens.
8992.64s:  All right.
8997.64s:  So, okay.
9000.64s:  I have like a.
9012.64s:  I don't know if he was a millionaire, but I do think he had money.
9027.64s:  Because you like it was very clear that he opened up like a specific yellow account.
9037.64s:  Matt says Moas will never happen.
9039.64s:  I'm surprised to see a run to a new all time high.
9042.64s:  GME can't be valued at something.
9044.64s:  It's not worth the market one.
9046.64s:  Allow it.
9047.64s:  Well, Matt, I agree to a to a degree specifically related to Moas, but I don't agree in terms of the market,
9058.64s:  not allowing it because not permitting valuation at something.
9062.64s:  It's not worth because that's actually not how markets work.
9065.64s:  It's our perfect valuation machines.
9068.64s:  They're supply and demand measurements.
9071.64s:  So, I don't agree with that.
9073.64s:  I do agree with the market won't allow it because the numbers that I've seen for Moas are literally insane.
9079.64s:  Because I mean, they turned off the buy button before.
9085.64s:  And that was to prevent like quite literally a systemic collapse.
9090.64s:  So, I completely agree with you.
9094.64s:  I mean, I think that they wouldn't allow GameStop to run into forever.
9098.64s:  Now, I also do think though that they could let GameStop run more and hurt the people that probably should be hurt, at least in my opinion.
9109.64s:  But yeah, I mean, they're not going to let GameStop just go into infinity.
9116.64s:  So, the people that are like really hoping for Moas and whatnot, I get it.
9120.64s:  I don't think it would happen.
9124.64s:  Okay, so this is 14 Jan.
9131.64s:  Which is row nine.
9134.64s:  Just make sure we're good.
9136.64s:  So, this worry bought those. Yeah, perfect. Okay, good, good, good.
9146.64s:  So, all of this should be up one.
9153.64s:  Yo, I need to lock this.
9166.64s:  How do I freeze this?
9169.64s:  Can you not freeze a call?
9172.64s:  Here.
9183.64s:  This will make my life much easier. Beautiful.
9188.64s:  Right now we're here.
9190.64s:  And this is where he did all this stuff.
9200.64s:  Perfect.
9203.64s:  Great.
9206.64s:  Now we go to 31 Jan.
9212.64s:  Beautiful. Okay, good.
9214.64s:  So, 31 Jan.
9220.64s:  We believe these expired worthless.
9229.64s:  Cool.
9233.64s:  And then any other changes.
9237.64s:  So, on 31 Jan here.
9241.64s:  As I look at it today, he should have 21, 5, 8.
9245.64s:  He does 17 April, 10. He does 17 July.
9251.64s:  12. He does 16 April.
9256.64s:  12. He does.
9263.64s:  Yep. Okay, so all that's good. Fantastic.
9265.64s:  Now we go to fab.
9268.64s:  Where is this one?
9270.64s:  What was this one from?
9274.64s:  Off Putin.
9278.64s:  So, I'm going to go to the next one.
9281.64s:  Sold 100 each of the July.
9285.64s:  6 and 12s.
9287.64s:  No, I'm not there yet.
9290.64s:  He doesn't have those yet.
9293.64s:  It's the.
9294.64s:  That's up where he has those two updates that I missed the one.
9297.64s:  This one here.
9298.64s:  So, this one is 14 April.
9302.64s:  Wait, no, where's the end of fab?
9306.64s:  Okay, those are gone. Okay, great.
9309.64s:  So, now we're down here.
9318.64s:  And a fab.
9322.64s:  So, and a fab.
9324.64s:  The 21 fabs are gone.
9327.64s:  He still has.
9334.64s:  21s.
9343.64s:  Oh no, something's changed here.
9345.64s:  For those April 20s or 21s.
9353.64s:  These are April 20s.
9355.64s:  17 April 20s.
9358.64s:  Okay, so 17 April 20s.
9360.64s:  So, they look like they go away.
9368.64s:  So 17 April 20s.
9370.64s:  Oh no, they're there.
9371.64s:  I mean, I'm just an idiot.
9373.64s:  They're still there.
9374.64s:  So, there's 400 of those.
9375.64s:  That's good.
9380.64s:  The 21 fabs are gone.
9384.64s:  The 15 Jan 21s.
9388.64s:  So, he still has 600 of those.
9395.64s:  Okay.
9399.64s:  16 April 2112 calls.
9404.64s:  So, he bought those.
9406.64s:  It still has those.
9408.64s:  But now he has more of them.
9410.64s:  So, here.
9412.64s:  He bought to open 500.
9415.64s:  16 April 21 calls.
9422.64s:  And these are April 21s.
9427.64s:  April 2121 calls.
9433.64s:  And these.
9434.64s:  This update is 29 fab.
9439.64s:  So, 16 April 21.
9442.64s:  And then 29 fab 20.
9446.64s:  412 DTE.
9451.64s:  412 DTE.
9457.64s:  Perfect.
9462.64s:  Got that.
9464.64s:  That is fab.
9468.64s:  Beautiful.
9469.64s:  Okay.
9473.64s:  So, now is where he has the sneaky one.
9476.64s:  Yep.
9477.64s:  So, here's the April one.
9478.64s:  This is the one I missed before 14 April.
9481.64s:  Okay.
9482.64s:  So, 14 April.
9484.64s:  He sold to close 600 of the 15 Jan.
9487.64s:  So, that's flat now.
9490.64s:  The 17 April.
9496.64s:  He offloaded 100 those.
9498.64s:  So, sold to close 100.
9501.64s:  Of the 17 April 20.
9507.64s:  I think these are the 10 calls here.
9510.64s:  Yeah, 10 calls.
9511.64s:  So, he got rid of.
9514.64s:  100 of those.
9517.64s:  Holds 300.
9520.64s:  Okay.
9522.64s:  17 July 12s.
9527.64s:  Still here at 600.
9529.64s:  No change.
9532.64s:  16 April 21.
9535.64s:  No change.
9541.64s:  And then.
9549.64s:  So, he added the July.
9554.64s:  Six calls.
9556.64s:  Right.
9557.64s:  He has the 12s there.
9558.64s:  Yeah.
9559.64s:  So, he bought to open.
9564.64s:  500.
9567.64s:  Of the 17 July 20.
9571.64s:  Six calls.
9577.64s:  17 July 20.
9583.64s:  17 July 20.
9586.64s:  Let's take a look at these.
9590.64s:  This is from 14 April 14 April 20.
9596.64s:  This is 94 DTE.
9600.64s:  94 DTE.
9603.64s:  And he did that for one five.
9606.64s:  And then.
9612.64s:  So, that is it.
9616.64s:  Six calls one five.
9618.64s:  Okay.
9620.64s:  All.
9622.64s:  All.
9623.64s:  All.
9624.64s:  Please says don't forget his first purchase of GME shares.
9627.64s:  I honestly don't care about the shares here.
9629.64s:  We completely honest.
9631.64s:  Newton already has all the shares.
9633.64s:  Yeah.
9638.64s:  I don't really care about the shares.
9640.64s:  I've already done all the analysis on like the shares and stuff like that.
9647.64s:  I'm less, less interested in those in general.
9651.64s:  But.
9654.64s:  Off Putin says in the end, he only holds shares.
9657.64s:  It doesn't really mean anything to be honest.
9659.64s:  That sounds more of an idealistic kind of thing than anything.
9663.64s:  Right.
9664.64s:  Because he, like it, it like quite literally doesn't matter at all.
9668.64s:  He holds options straight up all the time.
9673.64s:  So I don't think that it that really matters.
9682.64s:  Okay.
9685.64s:  So now we're good here.
9688.64s:  Let's go to this and then after this one, I forgot what we were going to do.
9693.64s:  But I want to go do whatever it is we were going to do.
9697.64s:  What was that?
9698.64s:  Do you guys remember?
9702.64s:  And April.
9703.64s:  Here we go.
9705.64s:  I totally forgot what we were going to do.
9708.64s:  Okay.
9710.64s:  17 July six calls.
9713.64s:  What you're here.
9716.64s:  Salt to close 100 of these.
9724.64s:  He's now holding 400.
9732.64s:  And then the 12 calls.
9738.64s:  17 July 12 calls.
9744.64s:  to close 100 of these.
9751.24s:  Holding 500.
9755.04s:  Okay.
9757.12s:  16 April 12.
9761.08s:  Thousand of those has those.
9763.56s:  These are gone.
9765.96s:  So the 17 April 20s.
9775.64s:  17 April 20s.
9781.84s:  All Putin says we did this ready.
9783.84s:  No, yeah, we did.
9785.04s:  We did it for stop starting up here.
9787.32s:  I'm just getting caught up to close this gap because I didn't do it for this early stuff.
9792.76s:  So I want to.
9795.88s:  Yeah, I just want to have it for this.
9799.60s:  So here the 17 April 2010 calls.
9805.64s:  They.
9812.64s:  17 April.
9814.16s:  Let's see.
9814.76s:  So the last update was 4 Feb 14 April 30 April.
9821.32s:  Okay.
9821.84s:  So let's see what it looked like there in 2020 April.
9826.32s:  This looks like these are split not split adjust.
9838.04s:  So what would these have been trading for?
9845.16s:  14 he bought them.
9851.88s:  And then on the 30th of April.
9855.32s:  You guys know if Yahoo.
9857.32s:  If Yahoo is if they split adjust, these are not because it doesn't look like it.
9862.04s:  Because these would have been trading for what?
9863.92s:  Like for.
9867.24s:  12 cents two weeks prior.
9869.84s:  No, no, I'm talking about the stock.
9871.36s:  I'm just trying to see what the stock was going to be worth around here.
9874.52s:  Because we can see when he got into them in 17 Jan.
9880.84s:  Way back machine.
9881.60s:  Yeah, we could take a look.
9882.88s:  I don't know what think or swim does either, but let's take a quick look.
9890.00s:  Yeah, because it does this weird goofy shit that I can't tell what's what.
9903.40s:  Where we at 30 April.
9913.84s:  Putin says 573 close.
9924.52s:  Yeah, okay.
9925.00s:  So this is trying to do the split adjusted thing.
9928.52s:  It looks like on the.
9931.12s:  There it goes.
9931.84s:  So it looks like on the day that you look at it, it gives you the actual day,
9935.72s:  but then it does the split adjusted.
9938.80s:  So then.
9940.24s:  598.
9941.96s:  Yeah, so those tens definitely would have expired worthless.
9945.68s:  So.
9949.60s:  This would be 500 expired worthless.
9958.12s:  Okay, so that calms for you now.
9963.32s:  Okay.
9964.24s:  And then what is this 17 Jan those are gone.
9980.16s:  17 July.
9981.60s:  Oh no, okay, good.
9982.52s:  So he has those six is so great.
9984.28s:  Okay, cool.
9986.32s:  Got it.
9988.48s:  I think we Gucci here.
9991.12s:  And then.
9994.60s:  That's 30 April.
9997.36s:  May.
9998.40s:  June.
10000.44s:  July.
10002.72s:  August September 1st.
10004.16s:  So I pick it up at September 1st.
10007.04s:  We only have a couple left.
10012.16s:  May.
10013.84s:  June.
10017.08s:  This is 31 May 20.
10024.72s:  Okay.
10026.20s:  GG.
10030.44s:  Negative.
10032.48s:  And 554.75.
10037.16s:  Ash 8848.89.
10041.56s:  So fuck ton of eights.
10043.68s:  Value.
10045.32s:  148.713.89.
10054.68s:  This all gets populated for us.
10057.92s:  No work required.
10061.72s:  And then let's take a look at these positions.
10065.84s:  So we have.
10072.76s:  17 July.
10077.52s:  12 calls.
10079.84s:  Those are still here 500.
10082.24s:  At least all is 500 no change.
10087.68s:  Here.
10092.52s:  16 April's.
10094.48s:  Those are still there 1000 that's done.
10098.72s:  Does he have 400.
10102.76s:  Of the July 6 is he does.
10107.16s:  Okay.
10108.16s:  So then he is the 16 oct 20s.
10115.36s:  Thought to open 200.
10120.00s:  This 16 oct 28 calls.
10127.32s:  Need did that for 35 cents.
10134.04s:  And then what's the DTE on those.
10138.56s:  16 oct 20.
10142.76s:  31 May 20.
10144.60s:  So 138 DTE.
10150.00s:  80.
10153.28s:  Okay.
10164.08s:  So those are net new.
10166.68s:  15 Jan 21s.
10180.12s:  I'm just getting this spacing on these so that I can more readily.
10184.16s:  See this stuff.
10190.52s:  Yes, we added those.
10195.96s:  15 so bought to open 200.
10205.16s:  Of the 15 Jan 21 15 calls.
10211.76s:  Needed that for 20 cents.
10215.16s:  And then he bought to open.
10219.56s:  200.
10220.44s:  15 Jan 21.
10221.92s:  20 calls.
10222.92s:  Needed that for 0.10.
10224.92s:  So he's buying stuff that's like pretty far out of the money, which is also very interesting to me.
10238.44s:  So this is again 31 May 20.
10242.44s:  15 Jan 21 2290 DTE.
10251.44s:  So.
10269.92s:  So.
10280.44s:  He's only done the short DTE option stuff once.
10285.84s:  And my guess is he realized that it doesn't actually...
10291.52s:  At least there, I think he realized it doesn't actually work that great.
10298.80s:  30 June...
10301.88s:  20.
10305.28s:  TG here is negative 15377.26.
10313.04s:  PASH 51101.69.
10317.24s:  Value 121.271.69, giga-de.
10322.04s:  Alright, let's see if there's any changes here.
10326.12s:  So we have 16 oct.
10339.52s:  The eights, he's got those.
10343.24s:  He has got 15 Jan 21s, 15s and 20s.
10350.08s:  Those got bigger.
10352.12s:  We added three block to open.
10356.44s:  I'm just going to do a plus 300.
10361.00s:  Comment plus.
10363.68s:  We added 300 both of those.
10371.96s:  This I'm just going to change the format.
10374.28s:  So it's a little easier.
10377.40s:  Minus 100.
10378.40s:  Minus 100.
10379.40s:  Minus 100.
10386.40s:  Okay.
10390.40s:  So I see 500 there, 500 there.
10396.64s:  What about these 16 oct.
10398.84s:  Did he do anything with those?
10400.24s:  Yeah, he did.
10401.24s:  He added 300.
10402.24s:  That's sneaky snake plus 300.
10405.00s:  So he's building out here.
10409.04s:  The 17 July 12s, 500 of those still the same.
10430.08s:  17 July 6s.
10433.76s:  He had 400.
10436.76s:  So he sold another 100.
10447.68s:  The April's there's a thousand that's the same.
10454.88s:  Okay.
10460.64s:  So here it looks like any changes to the 12s.
10465.96s:  He had 500 of the 12s.
10469.96s:  Okay.
10470.96s:  So he didn't add anything here.
10474.76s:  Well, I mean, any new line items, he bought more options.
10483.84s:  And sold some.
10485.84s:  Okay.
10486.84s:  That's June.
10496.84s:  July.
10498.84s:  Twenty.
10501.84s:  Okay.
10505.84s:  So TG.
10507.84s:  Negative 61 275.17.
10513.84s:  Ash 26, 6, 3, 8, 7, 8, value.
10520.84s:  11223, 8, 7, 8.
10526.84s:  Okay.
10527.84s:  This all copies down.
10530.84s:  No effort required.
10535.84s:  All right.
10536.84s:  Let's see.
10537.84s:  Look at these options.
10538.84s:  The OX 16s.
10540.84s:  These are coming up soon.
10544.84s:  These are coming up.
10553.84s:  So plus 300, which makes him at 500.
10557.84s:  So he added here, which is hilarious.
10560.84s:  So plus 300 here, which puts him at 500 here.
10565.84s:  This puts him at 400 here.
10575.84s:  This puts him at 400 here.
10585.84s:  And this puts him at 1000.
10600.84s:  Plus.
10606.84s:  Plus 500, which puts him at 1000.
10614.84s:  And then here minus 100.
10619.84s:  This put him at 400.
10623.84s:  Minus 100.
10625.84s:  Put him at 300.
10632.84s:  All right.
10633.84s:  So here he added another 500.
10638.84s:  Yeah.
10639.84s:  Plus.
10642.84s:  Plus 500.
10645.84s:  Put him at 1000.
10650.84s:  He 15, Jan.
10651.84s:  It looks like you just moved to everything to 1000.
10654.84s:  Is one open, one, two, three, four, five, six.
10660.84s:  It's open.
10661.84s:  One, two, three, four, five.
10663.84s:  Okay. And something came off.
10664.84s:  I don't know what though.
10671.84s:  But something came down.
10683.84s:  Off food says 17th, six and 12s expired worthless.
10688.84s:  Okay, got it.
10692.84s:  So the 15 Jan, 21.
10697.84s:  What are these 15 calls for the 15s?
10715.84s:  These should be 10.
10718.84s:  And calls.
10720.84s:  And call.
10721.84s:  So here plus.
10724.84s:  Plus 500.
10727.84s:  Take some to 1000.
10730.84s:  And that's for the tens.
10733.84s:  Same thing for the 15s.
10738.84s:  The 15 Jan 21, 20.
10740.84s:  So we added those.
10744.84s:  Let's get rid of what he cleared out first.
10749.84s:  So we're going to get rid of the 17 July.
10755.84s:  So these are gone.
10758.84s:  And these were the no wait.
10760.84s:  These aren't gone.
10762.84s:  They.
10763.84s:  They might be.
10764.84s:  Yeah.
10765.84s:  Oh, damn.
10767.84s:  These expired worthless.
10779.84s:  These.
10782.84s:  April 21s.
10783.84s:  There's still there.
10784.84s:  He's at 1000.
10785.84s:  So that's the same.
10789.84s:  These July six is what had done the same.
10796.84s:  That leaves them one, two, three, four.
10799.84s:  The shins.
10800.84s:  One, two, three, five.
10807.84s:  Okay.
10808.84s:  So I forgot which one he added the 15s.
10812.84s:  The 15 15.
10815.84s:  Let's do here.
10820.84s:  So here he bought to open.
10824.84s:  1000.
10828.84s:  Of the 15 Jan 21 15.
10834.84s:  All's.
10836.84s:  He did that for 0.14.
10840.84s:  And then let's just do a quick pack.
10844.84s:  And 31 July 20 168.
10850.84s:  168.
10853.84s:  Okay.
10855.84s:  Excellent.
10858.84s:  All right.
10859.84s:  We are just about caught up then.
10861.84s:  We have August and then we're good.
10864.84s:  Most excellent.
10866.84s:  31.
10867.84s:  2020.
10871.84s:  31.
10873.84s:  2020.
10877.84s:  EG.
10881.84s:  441 410.93.
10886.84s:  8391.84.
10892.84s:  Value.
10895.84s:  612.
10898.84s:  191.84.
10902.84s:  Hey Newton texted me.
10904.84s:  Let's see what he says about the sheet.
10907.84s:  But I can ask him what the sheet.
10916.84s:  It's at the value tab now at the bottom.
10919.84s:  Aha.
10920.84s:  So he just moved it.
10921.84s:  Still there.
10922.84s:  That's good to know.
10928.84s:  All right.
10929.84s:  So.
10930.84s:  Ox.
10936.84s:  Let's see if there's any.
10939.84s:  Any changes here.
10942.84s:  16 oct 8s.
10943.84s:  Has them.
10946.84s:  So there's one one two three four five six one two three four five.
10952.84s:  So we added something.
10955.84s:  So the ox are there.
10957.84s:  In 21s.
10959.84s:  10s 15s.
10960.84s:  It looks like he added the 17s.
10966.84s:  He bought to open.
10970.84s:  1000.
10973.84s:  Of the.
10976.84s:  What is this?
10978.84s:  15.
10980.84s:  21.
10982.84s:  17 calls.
10984.84s:  At 0.15.
10985.84s:  This is nuts.
10986.84s:  So he's just building massive, massive unit positions out here.
10991.84s:  See, this is this is exactly what I was hoping to start being able to identify with him.
10995.84s:  Because.
10998.84s:  If you look at the movements that he's making.
11002.84s:  Like this is literally.
11005.84s:  Just building units.
11006.84s:  Like that's all this is.
11008.84s:  This is 31.
11009.84s:  20.
11010.84s:  130.
11011.84s:  70.
11012.84s:  The part that I.
11016.84s:  Actually, that's a lie.
11018.84s:  I actually take that.
11021.84s:  10 Senate新 favorite.
11046.84s:  Let's go back to this one because he did a bunch here on 31 July 2020.
11052.24s:  And then we're finally all cut up here, which is fantastic.
11056.32s:  But let's take a look at this.
11057.32s:  Let's go to what did I say 31 July 2020?
11065.36s:  31 July.
11067.76s:  And let's take a look at those options.
11072.20s:  Because
11074.04s:  the behavior is really interesting here to me.
11081.92s:  I'm going to wait for this to finish free buffering as it were.
11099.48s:  All right.
11103.84s:  Let's take a look at these 15 Jan 21s.
11108.84s:  Yeah, man.
11110.20s:  That's crazy.
11115.20s:  That's absolutely crazy.
11119.20s:  So the normal
11122.20s:  that's absolutely crazy.
11126.20s:  So the normal
11128.20s:  that's absolutely crazy.
11131.84s:  The normally if you go far out of the money like this, it's to build units.
11136.84s:  And that's if you start to get a big move, the gamma of your options will compound quickly.
11142.48s:  And you can buy more of them, right?
11144.04s:  That's why he's able to buy a thousand of these.
11149.04s:  He had some money at this point.
11150.40s:  So he could afford it anyways, but he can afford to buy more gross number of options
11158.92s:  by going super far out of the money like this.
11162.28s:  Now the really interesting part about this though is that my guess is that he had not priced targets
11168.72s:  because I don't think he trades with price targets.
11171.08s:  We literally have spent I haven't I haven't actually
11179.96s:  tabulated yet like how many gross hours I've spent looking at this stuff now.
11185.20s:  But it's dozens and I think I think he's trading under the general premise of he thinks
11196.20s:  the stock is going to go up right?
11197.80s:  Obviously, but like that's the main thing to me.
11201.00s:  It looks like he's he's focusing on.
11203.76s:  So the really fascinating component to this is he's essentially trying to play these
11211.28s:  as a leveraged delta play because if you can get a few thousand of these for super, super cheap
11217.68s:  on something that you think is going to go up even though it's not building a massive gamma ramp
11222.24s:  necessarily because it's so far out in time.
11224.24s:  Like for example, if I go 49 DTEs and we look at some of the options that are still super far out
11230.72s:  of the money, like you'll notice that the gammas are much like massive comparatively, right?
11236.00s:  So if we look at a 10 delta here or even a 13 delta, the gamma on these 168s is eight,
11244.72s:  but up here they're 16 because options that are closer in time are going to have way,
11249.92s:  way, way more gamma.
11251.32s:  So it's not building a gamma ramp.
11252.88s:  It's way too far out in time for that.
11254.96s:  And this looks far more like trying to build leveraged directional exposure.
11260.00s:  The other thing that I cannot help but notice is that so far we've literally seen him do this
11269.76s:  once where he buys these much near term DTE options.
11277.68s:  He literally did it this once and then it doesn't look like he touched it again,
11283.20s:  which I can't help but find that interesting.
11285.76s:  The vast majority of his entries here, 495 DTE, he added more, which would still be a couple
11296.48s:  100 DTE, 52 DTE, 107 DTE, 198 DTE, 458 DTE, 3 DTE.
11304.08s:  It's the only one that you see like that, which is 94 DTE for this one.
11310.08s:  Here it's 138, 229, 229, 168, 137.
11321.28s:  So if we were to plot those numbers, the overwhelming majority of them are greater than 100,
11327.44s:  and essentially all of them except for one are greater than 90.
11333.36s:  I think that's really important because this, I don't know what this was.
11340.32s:  I don't know if he thought, was there news on this day that you guys are aware of the 14th of Jan?
11346.16s:  Because that's also a weird day for the update.
11351.92s:  So what happened there?
11355.60s:  14th Jan.
11366.32s:  Here you go, holiday sales readout. So that's my guess.
11370.40s:  My guess that he thought something was going to happen around this.
11375.36s:  It looks like he was playing the event itself because there's really no other reason for
11380.40s:  the departure on that. And it ties well the fact that there was an event there.
11385.52s:  So that's what that looks like. Him trying to play that event with a little bit of money.
11390.08s:  So the overwhelming information that I have available now, based on all of these old
11399.36s:  trades analyzing literally all of these old trades, is that he has some very, very clear tendencies
11405.92s:  in terms of holding duration, delta selection, DTE selection. This clearly was a departure that
11413.68s:  was predicated on a specific event. So one of the artifacts we can take away from this is that
11418.96s:  if we see him play near dated options that probably in first he thinks an event is happening.
11424.88s:  Because otherwise all of these other options that I can see, they tell me that he looks at them
11432.72s:  as just longer term opportunities to trade something to the upside with leverage.
11438.56s:  Like that's that's very, very, very much what I can see here. And then he doesn't touch these
11444.08s:  again until 25 know it looks like. And it looks like he sold the 17s. So I mean, let's just
11453.36s:  break this down. So he sold the 15 Jan 21 17s. Is that this one?
11461.68s:  15s the 17s. So here, he sold to close. Well, I don't know what he did. So here, exited.
11475.28s:  I don't know exactly what happened. It doesn't really matter. But what matters is I can see the change.
11485.84s:  And then here, he exited on the 15s alone. These ones on this one.
11498.88s:  And then no change, no change, no change, no change. And then here, he took the tens down.
11505.28s:  5 Jan 21, he took the tens, which were this one.
11518.56s:  And then he takes the 15 Jan 21s.
11527.60s:  These ones.
11541.84s:  Oh, yeah, sorry, BH Murdock. Okay, so one Newton moved the value tab to the, it's on the value
11551.68s:  value tab at the bottom. And then he says that we don't have visibility on the shares or what price.
11560.00s:  Yep. He thinks he never sells GME. He thinks he sells calls, which I don't agree with.
11565.92s:  If he sold calls and played cycles, yeah, so he just talks about the delta, I see.
11570.88s:  So I'm going to let him have got it interesting. Thanks.
11577.52s:  I highly doubt he sold calls, but could have.
11588.00s:  We've gone through all of his old options trades and not once has he sold calls.
11601.20s:  I think it's contrary to his thesis.
11604.64s:  So that's why I think that.
11608.16s:  So the 16 April 20s, he took 200 down here. So here it's minus 200. And then he's holding 800.
11622.00s:  So then the 15s, he sells 300.
11632.88s:  Holds 500.
11638.64s:  Shares. And then it looks like he exercised the 16 April.
11652.64s:  So then these look like they would have expired worthless, these 16 ox.
11668.40s:  And here.
11671.44s:  So these look like they expired.
11682.16s:  And then yeah, that resolves them for what we have.
11689.12s:  Absolutely fascinating.
11693.44s:  And then we have the two June 24 comeback. That's where we'll pick up.
11700.56s:  BH Moredox says new and had a tab called Biggie's theory. Yeah, I don't know.
11704.80s:  I can ask him about that one, but I have to hop off. It's time to go grab dinner.
11709.84s:  Absolutely. Blast hanging out. If you enjoyed, please like the video because that does help us.
11714.40s:  And then if you can share it with anybody that might have any information or enjoy going through
11718.88s:  the process with us, I also appreciate that tomorrow. I'm going to do a live stream in the afternoon
11723.60s:  about following up on what I started today building this strategy. And then tomorrow afternoon,
11729.36s:  we have the pro livestream. So tons of stuff. Live streams every day at 5 p.m. Pacific time. Be an outlier. See you later.
