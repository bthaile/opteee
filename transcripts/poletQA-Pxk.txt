362.00s:  you
390.00s:  you
392.00s:  you
420.00s:  you
450.00s:  you
452.00s:  you
480.00s:  not being assigned. So let me grab GameStop and I'll actually show you what I'm talking about
488.64s:  here. So if we go back here to like the seventh of November and we eyeballed, this was like the
496.00s:  pre-run-up move. We can see GameStop's trading for like 23. So what I did was as I popped into this
502.32s:  and I just found an equivalent 30 delta reference. So with SpotPrice at 33,
510.48s:  31 delta puts us at 30. So about 3 points lower or 10% in this case. So applying that same methodology
518.96s:  about 10% lower from here would put us at about 21. So what I'm showing you is that if I sold a 30
526.16s:  delta put on a relative basis back here on the seventh of November, I would have made a few bucks.
535.44s:  However, the stock didn't even get near it. So I never would have actually taken the shares on
543.04s:  and I collected, let's call it $2 or something like that, which is decent, but I gave up $10
550.64s:  in Rally and the underlying itself. Bad tradeoff. So when I'm trading something like the covered
556.96s:  strangle, if I want to get assigned on the puts, what I'm going to do is make sure that I
565.28s:  selling close to at the money. And the reason for doing that is I want to get assigned to take
572.88s:  on the shares. I'm not trying to just sell puts and collect the premium. I'm trying to get assigned.
577.04s:  So I need to be more aggressive. I need to come closer to the money. Now for the puts today,
582.32s:  I originally sold them when the stock was down a bit more in sub 32. So when I originally sold the
590.64s:  puts that I reviewed in that video earlier today, which was in the 32, they were pretty much right
596.40s:  at the money. I think it started just rallying up and out, just up and out. So for all intents,
602.16s:  purposes, they were at the money. So the game plan though is I would never enter that way if I
609.92s:  didn't already have long shares. And if I want to enter something for a covered strangle,
615.44s:  I will typically open up with shares and selling a put, but I would just buy less shares than I
621.36s:  ultimately intend to hold. So yeah, overall, you got some of it, which is good, right? Like you
631.60s:  got a couple elements of what I'm doing there, but I think you just mistook buying versus selling.
639.68s:  And it's probably just because you're defaulting to buying because most people do. And I think
645.44s:  that's completely natural and okay. But instead of buying in this case, I'm selling actually.
653.60s:  So yeah, not too far off.
657.60s:  Sweet. So let's take a look back at our other screen because I do want to flip through this a little
666.48s:  bit more and see what we can come up with. So this is black well. Here we go. So this becomes
675.76s:  interesting. So man, this is just this technology is going to absolutely pivot how things work,
688.40s:  but this is what you should take away from from this keynote speech. And I'll literally grab a
695.60s:  screenshot and I'll throw it up on Twitter or X, but Nvidia is telling you what the ecosystem is.
706.08s:  This is literally directly from them. So I'll drop this on.
715.28s:  Oh, one sec. I'm making a post on it right now. So Nvidia AI ecosystem.
724.48s:  Outline.
725.12s:  I'm the names you like. And
740.96s:  so this is cool. The fact that you can essentially see what the big boys video you the ecosystem has.
752.64s:  And you can gain exposure to a lot of these Accenture is publicly traded for sure.
758.24s:  Teradata publicly traded Oracle publicly traded and liquid I should add on top of that. SAP
765.36s:  CrowdStrike Adobe all of those and Info Systems a lot of these are. So the cool part is if you like
776.16s:  some of these and there are things that you want to add to your portfolio. Let's take a look at
780.80s:  Oracle, for example, it's starting to be bid down. So maybe it's a entry opportunity for a longer
785.52s:  turn play. Completely rational, especially when you see again, the involvement that companies like
795.92s:  this are going to have with the broader ecosystem. Let's take a look at CrowdStrike that'll be more
802.48s:  from a security perspective, I believe. They've been trending sideways for a while now. Actually,
808.40s:  kill this. So this looks good either for near term short put style, just kind of collecting some
818.48s:  premium or for a longer term bullish thesis in how this landscape might evolve. Really interesting,
825.52s:  I think. So let's I want to see what he actually says about this stuff. Again, I'm going to be
832.16s:  reading the subtitles with you because I'm trying to keep the video from being allowed. But we got
841.20s:  to ramp this up way too slow. So it's talking about now how this model behaves and what it does.
854.64s:  I specifically want him to talk about this here. We're going to be working with the ecosystems. These
862.56s:  AI technologies are integrated. We have great partners. Really great work being dumb at SAP,
869.84s:  Demon, Hayden's great works and nopsis perplexity. They're just kind of not really saying anything.
880.00s:  He's just saying that these are good partners, which is fine. But I didn't know if he was going
884.08s:  to have specific things to say about them.
892.32s:  That's another thing to pay attention to if you didn't see what he was just saying about the future
902.40s:  of coding and that we're very likely going to see a future where crazy enough, but you're going to
915.12s:  have people who are writing code that have help essentially assistance from some sort of AI
924.88s:  assistant level tool. And I think that that's super important, to be honest. And the reason I think
930.00s:  that's so important is because that changes the landscape from an employment perspective,
937.20s:  from a hiring perspective. That's going to change a lot about the way that businesses view
944.32s:  the landscape going forward, which it's something to be aware of because there are going to be
950.24s:  companies that are going to be vulnerable during this. And you will find companies that don't pivot
955.76s:  as well. Companies that lag heavily. So the idea is to identify those kinds of things before
965.92s:  they start crashing. So either you can trade alongside with them, meaning trade them to the
970.56s:  downside or you can get out of the way. So Lauren says code writers knew they were on the way out.
978.72s:  That's what a friend told me. Well, that's the thing though is that I actually don't view them
982.64s:  on the way out at all. Coters are their job is going to change. But there is no replacement yet.
991.68s:  Still for human methodology. That's a big element of these kinds of things because again,
998.16s:  we can see it even in really good coding platforms and stuff like that. You can just use
1003.52s:  GPT E. Clawed any of those for a general proxy. And they're good. But you still need a human to
1011.68s:  go through troubleshoot to get it on target. Now I'm not saying that that's not going to evolve.
1017.20s:  It absolutely is going to evolve probably massively over the next decade or two. But I still think
1022.88s:  Coters even at that point will still have a seat at the table. But they're going to have to
1029.20s:  reskill slightly. And it'll be less of them being the individual subject matter experts
1039.68s:  on coding because AI will be able to help a lot with that. And instead,
1045.52s:  they're going to have to be able to manage AI and use it as an accelerator across an enterprise,
1053.04s:  which is a very different skill set than being the person that's physically sitting there
1057.20s:  plugging in code. And this will apply to data analysis is going to be another really big one.
1064.24s:  So people that are running dashboards in Tableau or that are trying to build queries in SQL
1073.68s:  to manage large data sets. You already have a massive accelerator through AI, but you still need
1082.00s:  a bit of the human element for all of it. So I think you will see pivoting. And that's the
1088.24s:  important thing to pay attention to in my opinion from a trading perspective because depending on
1093.60s:  how we pivot and who pivots well and effectively, they will those kinds of companies will do really,
1100.32s:  really well in my opinion. And the companies that fail to pivot like that, they will suffer and
1105.52s:  they will get left behind. And there will be some of those that always are. So let's see.
1115.84s:  AI PCs, this is interesting. All right, let's see what this is.
1121.52s:  And created for the cloud.
1123.68s:  Enjoying AI on phones. Going to have continuous AI that's going to be with you and you use those
1131.68s:  meta glasses, of course, that I'm really excited for. Really, really excited for
1138.96s:  when AI is integrated into augmented reality.
1145.12s:  Want to do more than anything is put our PC. That's cool. So he's talking about Windows 95.
1153.84s:  And how that changed the platform a lot of broader ecosystem of things.
1161.44s:  And he's saying that they want to have AI essentially become an assistant versus apps and
1169.44s:  AP or instead of APIs. Generative AI for sound. That's really cool. That's really, really cool.
1178.32s:  So to use AI, there was another thing I was seeing when he was going over this, I think the RTX.
1187.76s:  And one of the fascinating things about that is he was talking about how they're using AI to
1194.00s:  generate pixels. So that like pixel offload and something like that is fucking crazy.
1203.12s:  I think that'll be a pretty big deal for personal computing and stuff like that.
1209.04s:  All right, so WSL to two operating systems within one developed for developers.
1218.80s:  And you can have, I'm just giving them through the stuff that doesn't matter.
1223.60s:  Optimize for CUDA, which is important for this.
1241.20s:  So as long as the computer fits, you're going to have many models that fit whether it's vision
1246.08s:  models, language models or animation models. So you're going to have access to different kinds of
1250.08s:  models based on this, which is I think really, really cool too.
1257.12s:  And then physical AI. So that's, we just went through kind of like PC level AI. And then now they're
1264.56s:  talking about physical AI, which is if this happens in my lifetime, I cannot tell you how fucking
1274.24s:  stoked I'm going to be where if I can have a robot just roaming around my house.
1280.88s:  Because the main thing I think about with having a robot roam around the house is really not,
1288.40s:  I mean, just think of how much that changes things to be able to like sit in my office and control
1294.56s:  my robot to go bother my life throughout the day. Like, is there a better existence than that to
1301.92s:  just be able to like remote go up there and just like poker a couple times and then have the robot
1307.04s:  walk away or to another favorite thing for me to do is just like walk up and just move something
1314.24s:  on our desk, right? It's literally just a pester off, just to bother her a little bit. And this is,
1321.20s:  this is what I need in my life is to be able to do that with a robot. So I already do it with the
1327.44s:  cleaning robot. We have a like a I think a Robo rock or whatever it's called, but like I'll take
1333.52s:  manual control and I'll chase her with it, which is super fun. I like that a lot.
1339.68s:  So you guys in non terrorist, I enjoy having fun and playing around, especially at the expense of
1347.12s:  somebody else. It's, you know, always fun to play around, but when you can do it at the expense
1353.12s:  of somebody else, all the better. I'll be.
1356.88s:  Physical AI autonomous vehicles. I was actually looking at, so speaking of autonomous vehicles,
1364.96s:  I was looking at this, this weekend's my wife and I were going to go up to Idle Wild because I'm
1371.92s:  not out of the the mountain vibe yet. So we're going to go hang out idle wild. I'm cove is actually
1379.04s:  pretty, pretty high. So and I don't where I'll tie this back as you guys know.
1388.32s:  So we're going to go here to a side rock. Damn, I didn't realize that it was like that. Don't get
1393.44s:  any ideas gang. If I don't come back, it I'm not that for me. So Idle wilds pretty cool. It's like
1403.76s:  up in the mountains and there's hikes and, you know, different kinds of things you can do. That's
1408.64s:  pretty fun. But what I was thinking about doing was I was looking on Turo and
1419.20s:  poking around at different whips and it struck my idea to go to
1429.04s:  like a cyber truck. So let's see. Let's see what we could do for cyber truck. Sure. 10 to 10 is fine.
1444.96s:  Make the other one I was looking at was not a Rivian. What is it? A lucid. That's the other one.
1453.52s:  I really like to look at those lucids. I think they're sick.
1460.88s:  There we go. A lucid model air. But I was actually looking at a cyber truck because I pre-ordered one
1470.32s:  of them. I didn't really intend on taking delivery of it just because I just don't think I want
1478.72s:  I want one yet. But I was also looking at maybe grabbing a cyber truck to go just test it out
1485.92s:  see if we like it because I genuinely don't know yet what they're like. I haven't driven one.
1491.52s:  I've seen them out which has been really, really cool. But I've not I've not actually driven one
1501.60s:  and like traveled with one. But looks kind of cool to drive around in and look like the the
1508.40s:  warthogs from Halo. Only thing is I can't load it with fireworks obviously. And I imagine if I go
1518.16s:  anywhere near Vegas, I'm going to get a bunch of weird looks. So we'll have to we'll figure that
1526.16s:  out. I don't know exactly. I mean, I guess I could load it. Fireworks just feel like the right
1531.44s:  thing though. It just feels right. And we'll see we'll see what I load it with.
1538.64s:  David says don't take cyber truck to it. Yeah, exactly my thought. Yeah. That's exactly right.
1547.68s:  Oh, that's it. Rowing Titty. That's exactly. Hey, yeah, what up, Rowing Titty? I was thinking that's
1552.48s:  exactly what I should do is rent a cyber truck and then like fly my drone over the cyber truck
1559.12s:  and just be a general public menace. But all of that going back to what we're talking about over
1567.04s:  here. What I'm very interested in is how this ecosystem is going to evolve because the autonomous
1576.40s:  driving world is still very limited and definitely dominated by Tesla, especially out here in California.
1585.92s:  Which is kind of interesting because you think California generally speaking a little more left
1591.04s:  leaning liberal in what you would expect. Elon has gone a little further off to the right hand side.
1598.80s:  So I was always thinking that there's a chance a bunch of the more left committed people will be
1604.96s:  like I don't like test line anymore, but you see it everywhere. So to me, that just goes to show how
1611.12s:  powerful that ecosystem is. And you can see a bunch of the different names up here that they're
1616.88s:  talking about working with Lucid being one of them. Rivian, another thing I want to highlight.
1621.76s:  I don't know. I noticed this yesterday when I was driving back from LA or no two days ago when I
1626.48s:  was driving back from LA that I thought was really interesting is notice how all the text for these
1631.52s:  names is the fucking same. Rivian is essentially the same as Zika, which is essentially the same as
1637.28s:  Lucid, which is essentially the same as Zooks. It's I'm noticing a lot of these car brands are pivoting
1644.56s:  back to like the just very basic text. I noticed that on a couple Honda, there was like a Honda SUV I
1651.60s:  saw it with Lexus. They're all just doing like this style branding like this very, very basic
1658.00s:  text, just super interesting to me from a branding perspective.
1666.96s:  All right. Okay. So they're talking about essentially their involvement and you can see that he's
1671.84s:  working with every major car company around the world and say it is this is insane. In video,
1682.32s:  I still feel is a massive, massive value. This is crazy. Like this sell off from yesterday. I just
1691.92s:  think is a pretty significant opportunity to gain entry if somebody wanted to.
1700.80s:  In video is the kind of company I think in five years when you look back and you decide,
1707.12s:  you know, if you're happy with your investment, I just have to imagine Nvidia would be one of those
1712.96s:  ones where you buy, you look back in five years and you're stoked about it. I mean, it's already the
1718.56s:  case, but I think it still has so much more to go, especially with Nvidia. I mean, listen,
1727.12s:  let's talk about it. This dude is wearing like a fucking snake skin leather jacket. You can tell
1739.12s:  that he's not, he's obviously a CEO of a tech company, but you literally can tell that this dude
1745.60s:  is picking up like a rock star persona. He loves it. You can tell he loves it. He loves,
1751.92s:  I can tell the way that he talks about things, the way that he presents stuff. He isn't just a dude
1760.40s:  that's really into tech, like a Zuckerberg kind of thing. This is a guy that's actually enjoying
1768.48s:  Stardom. He literally has become a star. The fact that there's a tech company CEO that is now
1779.36s:  becoming a partial rock star that tells you a lot, it tells you a lot about the industry, what it
1787.36s:  looks like, where it might be going, and is weird and is off the beaten path that is in terms of
1795.28s:  analysis. I do think there's a lot to pick up from this. The way that he presents himself, it's
1801.84s:  just very different. I find the potential for a company like Nvidia, every time I look at it,
1809.52s:  I find the potential to be tremendous. It's one of the reasons why trading the leveraged
1816.96s:  covered strangle on Teachable Cues to me is very satisfying because the Cues is pretty heavy in
1823.36s:  all of these main tech companies that I really do think there's going to be a pretty strong
1829.36s:  future for. There's actually a few ETFs that track just the Mag 7 that I absolutely would trade.
1835.92s:  They're just not liquid enough just yet. There's even a couple leveraged versions of them that
1841.60s:  look really interesting like a two times leverage and a three times leverage. It's just a little early.
1847.36s:  Enough liquidity, I would happily rotate into something like that from Teachable Cues.
1853.68s:  That's one of the benefits of trading an index ETF like Cues is that you get a lot of exposure
1858.96s:  really to this broad ecosystem and Nvidia being a significant part of it.
1867.04s:  So they're partnering with Toyota, which is huge.
1876.32s:  Oh, I saw the word Thor hold on.
1888.96s:  A robotics computer.
1896.96s:  It was funny when I was going to the, I was dropping the McLaren off today.
1905.76s:  So one of the things you can get with the McLaren is like an extended service contract.
1910.32s:  And I mean, I normally like working on cars myself, but especially for something like the McLaren,
1917.28s:  I much prefer to have the extended service contract, right? So I'm going to drop it off.
1922.64s:  And as I'm dropping it off, there's a lineup of all super expensive cars. There's a bunch of
1929.60s:  Bentley's a couple of the McLaren's. There's a few Lamborghini. It's all shit like that, right?
1936.16s:  As I was looking at all of these different cars, I literally could see all of the technology
1943.52s:  laden all over these cars. When we look at Nvidia, they are continuing to penetrate and spread
1955.76s:  into a ton of different industries. And the automotive industry is not slowing down at all.
1965.84s:  With adoption or technology technology integration.
1971.12s:  Actually, one of the reasons why I like the McLaren 570s as compared to something like a 720s or
1978.00s:  a 650s, those are the 650s I was very close on. I really like that car. It says a very similar
1984.96s:  structure and body as the 570. But when you start looking through the amount of electronics that it
1990.88s:  has in the car world, we call them nannies and an IES. They're kind of like things that help you
1998.40s:  drive. And obviously, makes a lot of sense, right? Fast, powerful cars. You're going to be faster
2006.24s:  with the technology for sure. But a lot of us that are buying stuff like this, we're not necessarily
2012.16s:  getting into it because we think, you know, we're trying to be the the next fastest car on planet
2018.80s:  Earth or running lap times or something. Sometimes we do it just because we like driving. We like
2024.32s:  the experience. And even something like the 570s is fascinating because it has electronic steering
2031.76s:  which is different. Most cars will have hydraulic steering. It's a much different feel. But
2036.32s:  all of those other versions that I was telling you about, like the 650s, they have dynamic
2047.36s:  dynamic spoiler systems. Same thing with like the 670. If you take a look at the 720s,
2055.12s:  it's the same story. So they have a massive amount of technology that's built into it, which is
2064.88s:  really cool. But again, for like a driving experience, it really starts to sabotage a lot of it
2071.04s:  from my preference with respect to driving. So it's neat. Like this entire spoiler system
2078.48s:  is completely dynamic. And it will move and rotate as you're driving, as the car decides that you
2087.84s:  need different things, which is really, really cool. But yeah, it's I think indicative of the future.
2096.88s:  I was actually thinking about that. Funny enough, I was thinking how I'm kind of getting ready
2106.32s:  to grab another car just because I like them. And as I started looking through stuff,
2112.24s:  I'm struggling to find something that kind of scratches the itch from a modern perspective.
2117.52s:  So as I was like looking and scrolling through stuff, I was going further and further back in time
2123.36s:  to find things that give the experience that I'm looking for, which I just find so interesting.
2129.12s:  I understand more and more why old dudes tend to like classic cars. I totally get it. Because I
2136.48s:  can only imagine, I mean, I think most old dudes were excited when fuel injection came around and
2142.08s:  like independent rear suspensions and differential like that kind of stuff. I think universally people
2149.12s:  liked, but cars are getting to the point now where they have collision detection. And
2155.20s:  that's actually put me in more precarious spots more than it's helped me. Funny enough,
2160.32s:  where like you're trying to pull out, but it notices something that just went by and there's a lag
2164.96s:  when it receives what went by versus when you're trying to go and it's you're working in a
2169.36s:  window of seconds. So the technology is just going nuts, man. And if you see some of the new models,
2181.52s:  let's take a look at the Artura. We don't want the spider. We just want the Artura.
2186.80s:  But this thing has a crazy amount of technology in it, gorgeous car. It looks really,
2199.12s:  really pretty. But you can even see it in the front, like the entire front, lower body panel
2203.92s:  is all electronic. It has the same thing with the spoiler system you can see that this will lift
2209.44s:  up. So very, very interesting, but super, super technology, Layton, which I just,
2224.32s:  oh, this one doesn't have the active arrow. That's actually kind of cool. It's probably in the
2228.64s:  suspension itself. Well, let's see what we're going to get, shall we? Hands in it. Tins in it's a
2235.04s:  beautiful color, but it wouldn't be my pick. We would have to go with orange.
2241.76s:  All right, let's see.
2248.72s:  Not volcano orange. This is what the 570 is. Is it hold on?
2260.24s:  I literally can't see the difference.
2265.76s:  This is what I have. So the McLaren is papaya spark. And the cool part about it is that it has
2276.56s:  like a lot of yellow flaking it. I mostly just want to see the technology that's in this thing.
2285.36s:  I don't care about all this stuff.
2287.36s:  I don't care about any of this. Pack pack. I have backpack. Oh, black pack.
2298.88s:  Don't care about any of this. Don't care. Don't care.
2304.08s:  I thought that they would have like a thing that talks about, here we go, tech lux. Let's see
2310.08s:  what this is.
2317.20s:  Their panels, their little devices typically aren't very good.
2322.16s:  It's funny. The console that I have in the Corvette is nicer than the one that's in the McLaren.
2328.88s:  Not even joking, like pretty significantly.
2340.56s:  Let's see. I don't care about entertainment.
2347.60s:  I want to see. Let's take a look at Volvo. They was talking about Volvo's
2355.36s:  Nvidia relationship. See what this is. So they've been partners since 16. They have the Nvidia drive
2368.40s:  platform.
2376.96s:  And then it looks like it's powering the self-driving element.
2386.72s:  That's really interesting.
2391.76s:  Oh, fuck is that thing? Is this?
2394.96s:  I think it's just the way it's going, man.
2406.48s:  Yeah, take a look at this. Computer on wheels. That sounds exactly right.
2420.80s:  All right, let's see what our boy, what else he has.
2431.92s:  20 times processing. See, and that's,
2436.08s:  I go back. That's the other really cool thing about where we're at right now with this
2440.80s:  technology. Take a look at this. So, or is 20 times the processing capability of the last
2448.32s:  generation, Orin? I would assume it would be, if it's Thor, I was guessing it'd be like Odin,
2452.88s:  but maybe it's Orin. I can't hear him. I'm guessing that the the C.C.s might be messed up.
2458.48s:  But we're still at the point where the technology that we're looking at is so rapidly expanding.
2468.16s:  I mean, massively expanding. That I also find intriguing because it's almost like the first few
2475.60s:  versions of the iPhone, right? The iPhone had some really, really huge leaps and bounds that it
2484.72s:  moved. And then it kind of started to slow down. And now with the iPhone, it's kind of like
2491.76s:  year over year, you just get the same shit, slightly different thing. I've already bitched about
2497.60s:  it. I'll take this opportunity happily to bitch about this again. Don't worry. But one of my
2502.40s:  least favorite things is this new button. This is the dumbest thing I've ever dealt with on a new
2509.44s:  phone in my life. I see absolutely no reason for this button. It takes me to the camera, but you
2516.80s:  can still just get to the camera by pressing the button on the front. Like this button is so stupid,
2524.40s:  but it's there. So, thought I would share my hatred for that button with you.
2530.16s:  But back to this, let's see. Full production, full robot, that's also smart. So they're using it
2541.04s:  in different things, which is super smart.
2543.68s:  Safety drive OS, first software defined programmable AI computer that's certified up to
2561.36s:  ASLD, which is I guess some sort of standard, standard rating, functional safe computer,
2577.44s:  building a robot in video kuda, omniverse and cosmos to do in the context of self driving.
2590.24s:  Oh, yeah, let's see. Let's see. How they use the card to reconstruct digital twins
2603.04s:  and to train future models. All right, let's see what this is.
2611.68s:  So, hold on, I realize I'm watching and not talking. Sorry. So it looks like they're using three
2623.68s:  computers. They have an Nvidia DGX that trains the models, omniverse test drives, and generates
2632.96s:  synthetic data. And then AGX is a supercomputer inside the car that tries to address edge real-life
2645.36s:  scenarios. That's crazy. That's absolutely crazy.
2665.60s:  So it has the maps built in, but then it has a supercomputer that helps it analyze real time
2672.72s:  through the various vehicle sensors to identify any of the strange circumstances like this,
2680.16s:  like if there's road work or something like that, that's so cool. That's a big problem of
2686.72s:  what's missing right now and what I think will still take a long time for this kind of thing
2694.08s:  right here, right, where we have a dude saying go slow, and then this isn't even that difficult to
2702.80s:  be honest. There's instances you all have been in them where like you have to drive in the opposite
2707.84s:  side of traffic. Like I'm really curious how is it going to do when it's forced down opposite
2715.52s:  side traffic or something like that? And it seems like that's the whole point of the super computer
2721.36s:  side of things. AGX is that it'll help it be able to learn that after it goes through the training
2729.12s:  element, which is really cool. Man, what? So cool. Literally so fucking cool.
2751.76s:  Even the process of like building the database to train this is absolutely insane.
2760.72s:  All right, what's this next one robotics? We got some robots.
2764.88s:  AVator Geeks says we are at level two automation now. All this stuff is for level three, which
2770.88s:  is just driver assist still not full automation. I don't know the actual nomenclature for like the
2776.40s:  different levels. I don't know if AVator is that like an actual nomenclature that you're using
2782.48s:  or you're just kind of coming up with what you would consider it to be because the reason I'm asking
2789.68s:  is it to me this still seems like level one, maybe level 1.5. I still feel like we are so far in
2797.92s:  the infancy of this whole thing.
2806.96s:  Oh, there's a whole line of them.
2814.40s:  Ah, you see that's a great way to frame it. That's a great way to frame it.
2821.52s:  AVator says yeah, industry talks. So then how many levels are there? Because if we're saying
2826.00s:  levels like two and three, I would have to imagine based on that that there would be like fucking
2831.12s:  100 levels. Like you would have to be a ton of levels in that scaling system.
2842.08s:  But do you see what he's talking about here? This is important. The chat GPT moment for general
2848.80s:  robotics just around the corner. That's fucking cool. So for those that don't know what this is
2859.92s:  alluding to chat GPT as most of you know, kind of like sprung up and became the household name
2865.60s:  for AI. And obviously what he's saying is that soon enough, we're going to see this like these
2872.64s:  kinds of general robotics introduced across the broader ecosystem rapidly, which is I think just
2880.80s:  super, super cool. So this is saying why general robotics is so important as compared to
2895.52s:  tracks and wheels is that green fields, brown adaptation is perfect. We could build these
2906.56s:  robots and deploy them in the world that we've built for them through robots are a genic robots.
2916.08s:  So information workers.
2922.40s:  Okay.
2927.84s:  If we have the technology to solve these three, the largest technology industry, the world's ever
2933.68s:  seen. Yeah. The critical capabilities, how to train the robots, which will be a really big thing.
2944.64s:  Obviously,
2951.76s:  imitation information, the human demonstration, laborious need to come up with a clever way to make
2956.56s:  hundreds of demonstrations, thousands of demonstrations. That's actually something I feel
2962.72s:  doesn't necessarily get as much credit as it might need just how detailed and how in depth,
2972.24s:  the training element of this whole thing is, which is just absolutely massive.
2983.12s:  So they're just talking about essentially using synthetically generated motions to help
2989.20s:  teach it to perform a task. But that's a clunky, blocky process.
3006.08s:  That one walks weird.
3019.20s:  Group. That's a great name.
3036.80s:  Okay. So this is talking about essentially a robot as the interface to reduce risk.
3042.80s:  I mean, that feels not really.
3056.32s:  I am just eager to see all the videos. Can you imagine all the videos we're going to see
3062.80s:  of these robots when they're first being rolled out in how bumpy everything is going to be?
3070.80s:  The videos are going to be hilarious.
3076.96s:  Corey launched a shrunk it to DGX.
3080.48s:  I'll harmonize it with RTX, AGX, OVX.
3087.28s:  And it revolutionized DGX1.
3093.44s:  So it revolutionized artificial intelligence and they want to make it possible for researchers
3098.40s:  and startups to have out of the box AI supercomputers. This is one of the things I saw from a clip
3103.76s:  that looks really, really interesting. So this, if I'm not mistaken, I think this is like the $3,000
3109.20s:  supercomputer.
3117.20s:  So that's the, God, look at that.
3131.52s:  Project digits right now.
3139.84s:  So it runs the entire Nvidia AI stack.
3148.16s:  Wireless or connected to a computer.
3158.40s:  That's so sick.
3166.00s:  So that's the thing where they talk about the price of this thing.
3196.48s:  Okay, what kind of car was that?
3204.72s:  Wait a minute.
3207.68s:  Oh, it's a Corvette CA right there.
3215.04s:  That doesn't look like a Z06.
3217.92s:  It's your winner.
3228.24s:  This reminds me of the fifth element.
3235.44s:  You guys, you guys see the fifth element? There's a scene where the dude is choking.
3240.80s:  And he's like pressing a bunch of buttons,
3244.80s:  trying to, because he has robots that do everything around the office, but there wasn't one
3249.92s:  that can help him. Hold on. Let me see if I can find it.
3255.12s:  I don't even know what to type in.
3258.08s:  Fifth element.
3260.40s:  Okay.
3270.64s:  This is what it reminds me of.
3278.64s:  This is what he's drinking that with, by the way.
3282.64s:  What do you put a cherry in like that?
3284.80s:  Also shout out to this plastic thing, the universal sign.
3290.72s:  So now he's like pressing all these little office buttons.
3296.24s:  And you see we're choking.
3298.08s:  So I don't know why, but seeing all these robots around reminded me of this.
3303.44s:  Like we're going to have robots do all all this crazy shit, but then we're not going to have
3309.68s:  the basics covered as humans anymore.
3313.36s:  Super cool.
3315.04s:  Now I wanted to flip through this, not just the Nvidia, but I wanted to flip through the rest of
3322.96s:  CES because there's a couple of other really cool pieces of technology that I want to take a look at.
3333.20s:  So let's see.
3336.96s:  Rollable laptop? What?
3339.36s:  It just looks like it.
3351.60s:  That's pretty cool.
3353.44s:  So it looks like it extends up.
3358.80s:  That's very, very neat.
3359.92s:  So you can see like there's these rails that you can extend it up and obviously the screen rolls
3364.96s:  somewhere just all the way. That's pretty neat.
3370.16s:  I don't care about this.
3374.24s:  I don't care about this.
3380.00s:  It was like a health scanner thing that looked really cool.
3389.44s:  What the fuck?
3391.28s:  That seems dramatic.
3395.92s:  That looks crazy.
3397.44s:  That I wonder if we need more of this.
3401.28s:  We need more.
3402.56s:  Remember what is the name of that little last car?
3405.52s:  The smart cars.
3406.72s:  This is I guess it looks a little cooler than a smart car at least.
3413.36s:  That don't care.
3415.60s:  Whoa, that's actually kind of cool.
3425.92s:  The box looks like a toaster.
3428.48s:  After a few seconds, the machine swaps out the depleted battery in the case.
3434.88s:  Oh, so it's like in a case weird.
3437.68s:  That's pretty neat.
3439.20s:  Battery backup for your fridge.
3440.72s:  That's not really anything cool.
3446.56s:  That's so excessive.
3455.76s:  Moveable TV.
3456.96s:  That's kind of dumb.
3459.12s:  This one seems so absurd.
3461.60s:  This one seems absolutely so absurd.
3464.08s:  Just like there's like these little fucking robot arms that pick up things.
3467.60s:  I could just imagine how useless that's going to be.
3473.04s:  Smart glasses.
3479.84s:  No.
3481.28s:  No.
3482.32s:  Digital art.
3483.52s:  That's kind of cool with fewer cables.
3489.52s:  That's really interesting.
3495.68s:  Wait, what?
3502.72s:  We're at a new strain of Audrey's.
3506.80s:  They unveiled a smart planter.
3510.64s:  Oh, I thought it was saying that like the focus.
3517.92s:  Where's this fucking?
3519.68s:  Let me find it.
3520.96s:  Here's this health scanner thing.
3530.16s:  Oh, that's interesting that it's withings.
3531.60s:  I didn't realize the brand because that's.
3535.20s:  I've seen their brand on a couple different things actually.
3540.96s:  But take a look at this.
3545.68s:  Whole body scanning thing.
3548.08s:  I'm a jig.
3551.12s:  So it's called the omnia.
3556.40s:  It's a transformable experience.
3558.48s:  Concentral product offer 360 degree body scans.
3563.20s:  Weight, heart, lung health, sleep activity, nutrition.
3568.40s:  From some sort of connected wearable.
3570.96s:  That would be so sick.
3574.72s:  That one I think is interesting.
3578.32s:  Rafael joined.
3581.12s:  Why not says he's going to slap the shit out of the robot.
3583.60s:  That's so funny.
3585.84s:  Rointit, he says it wasn't a cherry.
3587.44s:  It was a fireball.
3589.04s:  Yeah.
3589.60s:  Rafael says what is he looking for?
3591.44s:  I'm not looking for anything.
3592.40s:  I'm poking through CES.
3595.04s:  There's a ton of new technology coming out.
3599.60s:  I love new technology.
3601.04s:  I love trying to find things that look really interesting and investible,
3606.56s:  which we came across some of it actually.
3610.16s:  Nvidia specifically.
3611.20s:  I think that's like the main.
3612.72s:  That's like the main thing I can come across.
3614.96s:  The Nvidia ecosystem.
3618.88s:  Rafael says this is boring.
3620.48s:  Oh, that's cool.
3621.04s:  Hop off, man.
3621.76s:  Yeah, totally cool.
3623.44s:  This is a completely different style of stream,
3626.48s:  where that's why it's called crater hangout.
3628.88s:  We have no agenda.
3629.84s:  We're here just to bullshit.
3631.36s:  Take a look at stuff and explore.
3634.40s:  So yeah, no issue if this ain't your bag.
3639.84s:  But we'll catch you later on the next one.
3645.44s:  What do you guys think of these?
3649.28s:  Anybody going to be cruising around in the hyper ice night
3654.00s:  these are the people that do a lot of recovery stuff.
3660.00s:  So I think I have hyper ice boots already.
3663.44s:  And then I think they do a couple other things.
3666.64s:  I don't know if they do like the massage guns and stuff.
3669.44s:  But those look nuts.
3672.08s:  Interesting though that they appeared with Nike.
3673.92s:  Where he says only if they massage my bunions.
3683.92s:  I don't really know what a bunion is.
3685.84s:  I've heard of that.
3687.36s:  But I have no idea what the affliction is.
3691.60s:  Would you want that in a shoe?
3693.12s:  Something that does that?
3698.56s:  Lauren says those shoes look like a weapon.
3700.16s:  Yeah, no shit.
3701.20s:  They look crazy.
3702.08s:  They look like jet boots or some shit.
3707.20s:  Cool.
3708.48s:  CES, a lot of really, really cool technology.
3712.40s:  I think the main takeaway looking through this though is very much eyes on Nvidia.
3720.72s:  And that will be important because if I were looking for ways
3727.04s:  to capitalize on this new technology wave, a lot of the things that we're seeing coming out,
3732.96s:  Nvidia is kind of at the heart of it.
3735.20s:  So it's something that I would integrate into the broader plan pretty carefully.
3742.40s:  Because as we're seeing all the different connectedness between these different tools,
3749.84s:  you can see clear as day that Nvidia is kind of at the heart of most of it.
3756.32s:  Meaning Nvidia is powering all the different automotive manufacturers.
3761.36s:  Nvidia is powering the robots.
3764.08s:  Nvidia is powering the self-driving side of things.
3768.24s:  Nvidia is powering the AI side of things.
3771.52s:  So that tells you if you're trying to gain exposure from a trading position to this kind of stuff,
3780.48s:  I think the way that we gain exposure is Nvidia is kind of the core of it.
3789.28s:  And then you can find offshoots, smaller individual companies that are in that broader ecosystem
3798.80s:  that might have bigger growth perspectives.
3801.68s:  Because that's the other thing to keep in mind.
3804.32s:  Is when we're trying to find
3809.28s:  like this list.
3812.48s:  And some of these will be better positioned to grow more than others.
3817.76s:  And depending on how well they participate, obviously, will directly impact the growth potential.
3826.56s:  Where is this?
3833.60s:  Uh-oh. Time to figure out the dinner order.
3845.68s:  All right. Let's go through some of these.
3853.84s:  I want to see Lama index.
3858.32s:  So Lama index is private.
3868.56s:  Obviously, GPT still is.
3875.84s:  Let's see what else.
3879.52s:  Let's try Lang chain.
3887.84s:  Not publicly traded.
3890.96s:  Through AI.
3898.08s:  So crude AI looks like it is.
3902.00s:  What's the ticker?
3910.64s:  There's a bunch of videos about analyzing crew AI stock.
3915.76s:  But I don't see a ticker.
3917.84s:  Is this a publicly traded company? Do you guys know?
3926.96s:  Well, let me move the chat over here so I can pay.
3935.92s:  Yeah, I'm trying to, I don't see crew AI.
3940.16s:  Is it ticker? But I'm seeing stuff talking about
3942.96s:  analyzing it.
3949.12s:  Okay, so it says privately held.
3950.64s:  So I have no idea what those videos were talking about.
3952.80s:  Probably something else.
3955.68s:  Let's take a look at synopsis.
3962.08s:  So that is SNPS.
3966.32s:  And they've done nothing for the past year.
3970.40s:  That's interesting.
3971.76s:  So this one here is synopsis from the agent platforms and applications.
3976.64s:  We take a look at that.
3977.92s:  SNPS.
3982.24s:  They're not doing shit.
3986.00s:  So big, big, big roll over here.
3993.52s:  Strangely though, it looks like they might be grabbing a little bit.
4001.20s:  Of support. But I mean, that's just like, that's a deep contraction from here.
4005.84s:  What is this 621 down to 47? That's too far.
4010.16s:  That doesn't look good to me.
4012.32s:  So interesting to see them doing so poorly.
4016.40s:  Let's take a look at maybe NetApp.
4023.04s:  So these guys we know in tap.
4026.00s:  These guys are doing better.
4032.00s:  Still on a short term time frame though.
4035.52s:  Contracting pretty heavily. Let me grab app.
4039.84s:  Just adding these to our list.
4047.04s:  Yeah, they don't look great.
4049.52s:  I take a look at maybe data loop.
4058.80s:  Private still fast.
4064.00s:  L-O-N.
4066.16s:  Is this right?
4070.32s:  What is this?
4079.92s:  E-Mining opportunities in Romania's in Bob Lee.
4093.52s:  Yes, so this ain't it.
4097.84s:  That's a whole different bag.
4104.72s:  Dan says I'm debating whether or not the market would care of LA Burns.
4107.92s:  I don't think so.
4109.04s:  The other thing is we've, California has had enough fires at this point.
4113.28s:  It's not really anything hyper unique.
4119.04s:  All right, so it looks like tonight's dinner plan will be some zah.
4127.36s:  So I got to find when you're in California though, you can't get good pizza.
4132.48s:  You just kind of have to resign the fact that you're going to get like shitty,
4136.40s:  shitty pizza and just get over it.
4141.44s:  Not ideal, but you do what you got to do.
4151.12s:  All right, let me get this order over to her.
4154.32s:  And now is a great time.
4156.40s:  If there's anything that you guys want to take a look at, poke through,
4159.76s:  please start throwing them in the chat and then we'll go through them together.
4166.24s:  I made a sauce, pepperoni, that's good.
4175.52s:  Perfect.
4178.56s:  Just a standard, standard pizza.
4183.28s:  What we don't like is putting a bunch of weird shit on our pizza.
4188.48s:  That part's kind of unacceptable.
4196.64s:  Okay.
4212.32s:  I am Gucci.
4215.68s:  Phil, yo, what up Phil?
4218.00s:  Phil says, what are we thinking for GME this week?
4222.80s:  Well, from the video earlier today, in case you guys didn't catch it, I did do an update
4229.28s:  on the GameStop coverage triangle that I have on right now.
4234.16s:  And I'm still scaling into the position, but I still have a lot of it open.
4240.56s:  So at least for me, that means I'm leaving a little bit of risk to be added on.
4245.76s:  I'm about 67.5% utilized right now.
4249.92s:  And so I'm using 16,900.
4254.08s:  And the total allocation is 25.
4258.96s:  Okay.
4259.92s:  So I'm leaving a little bit extra to be able to scale into it.
4265.28s:  I don't really see anything in front of it.
4269.36s:  That's like thinking like because it's kind of in a free zone here.
4273.36s:  It doesn't have a bunch of overhead resistance at this point.
4277.12s:  And the only overhead resistance stems back from like three years ago.
4283.68s:  That's a long time to like, I don't really consider that resistance overly relevant at this point.
4291.36s:  So this looks like it's probable that it'll oscillate in this range that I defined.
4300.96s:  And we originally defined this range some time ago.
4304.72s:  It's like 30 to 35 handle because again, this is just going back to the prior point of control
4311.76s:  that we could see from older timeframes and seeing how it's running in this general range.
4319.12s:  But one of the things I will note is that it does look like it's established a bit of a floor here.
4324.56s:  And it's actually starting to break above.
4327.44s:  And what I would consider to be potentially the new floor if it holds that as support,
4334.16s:  which is too early to tell.
4335.36s:  It needs to.
4338.88s:  It needs to oscillate a little bit more so that we can actually see what it might do.
4345.52s:  But that's what I'm seeing here.
4347.44s:  As always, thank you for the $1.99.
4350.56s:  And I like that it's specifically a $1.99.
4353.20s:  It makes me happy.
4354.00s:  I look forward to being reminded.
4357.28s:  That I am essentially a cheap prostitute.
4361.60s:  But hopefully that is helpful.
4363.76s:  It's my guess is somewhere range bound between 35 and 30.
4368.40s:  In terms of end of week movement,
4372.08s:  I already told you that I sold those puts and there's honestly a really good chance
4377.12s:  I'm going to have to move them up.
4379.28s:  So I have the 10 Jan.
4382.48s:  And when I first sold them, they were literally at the money.
4387.68s:  So there already a 50% I didn't even see this.
4391.12s:  They're already a 50% profit.
4393.84s:  So I sold the 32s and 10 Jan.
4398.40s:  They were a 44 Delta when I entered.
4400.32s:  So essentially what the 33s are now.
4403.12s:  And I sold them for 95 cents.
4405.28s:  So I'm going to have to chase this up a little bit.
4408.16s:  So what that means is I what did I get in at earlier 32 23.
4416.48s:  So yeah, because when I entered the stock,
4421.44s:  when I bought the stock, the stock was trading at 32 24.
4424.56s:  So then I sold the 32.
4426.56s:  So I'll probably take that down tomorrow, Tbh.
4430.64s:  And then my expectation is I will
4438.08s:  yeah, I'll have to move them up into like the 33.
4440.96s:  I don't want to get too far into chasing it because at some point,
4445.52s:  I would rather just buy the stock, but I don't think it's necessarily breaking out just yet.
4450.40s:  So yeah.
4456.72s:  Interesting, interesting behavior though, so far in GameStop.
4462.32s:  The other thing I wanted to do was, oh, hold on, I got another question from Tommy.
4471.04s:  Tommy says, are you going to roll up the GME puts?
4476.16s:  Yeah, that's essentially what it would be.
4480.24s:  Common.
4480.88s:  And this actually is an example where I would call it a role.
4485.52s:  But and it's because interestingly to talk about the concept of rolling and the
4492.16s:  how weird it is, this is a little bit different because I'm essentially running it at the same,
4500.24s:  the position is the same thing in my mind.
4502.40s:  I want it to do a specific thing.
4504.80s:  And it's just not doing it right now, obviously making money, but I would rather be making
4510.16s:  the money via long equity at this point on some of it.
4514.88s:  So what's it trading at right now?
4520.00s:  This is marking it at 2055, which just doesn't sound right.
4526.08s:  Yeah, because this shows it closed at 33.
4528.32s:  So does this just need to reload?
4530.72s:  I want to see if this updates.
4532.00s:  But this is another example where I essentially make much less via the short put
4545.12s:  than I would make if I literally just had the equity itself at least on the day.
4552.88s:  Now again, you can't always look at stuff that way.
4557.04s:  It's not really a fair comparison, but it is absolutely something I think about is
4566.96s:  that's why I try to gain most of the exposure via the long equity so that then the short put
4572.80s:  side of things is really designed to help me manage my basis more than anything.
4578.32s:  So because if I take a look, where are we?
4583.76s:  We are...
4587.12s:  what's GME distance off of 52 week highs?
4589.68s:  I think it's like 50% or something like that, right?
4592.56s:  48.5%.
4594.56s:  Now that again, that's using a squeeze high, so you can't really use that.
4600.08s:  But the total percent...
4603.44s:  That's another thing I need to take a look at one sec.
4607.52s:  I'm adding another thing in here for the current stock value as a percentage,
4614.40s:  because I like to see how much of the position is in stock versus puts.
4623.68s:  So what I do is I track the cash secured requirement, which includes stock and options.
4632.48s:  But then I like to split it out.
4633.84s:  So I'll do like stock requirement and then work put,
4641.44s:  the SP requirement, so that we can track these separately.
4647.36s:  So then of this, divided by this, and then we'll just do throw a negative sign in front of it.
4658.96s:  So right now for the long side of it, it's like 50.50, which actually I don't love.
4667.52s:  I would prefer it to be a little better balanced than that.
4673.60s:  Yeah, definitely.
4674.80s:  It's literally just about 50.50.
4676.80s:  It's 52% short puts right now, which isn't enough.
4680.96s:  So that means we need to gain a little bit more exposure here.
4690.00s:  So the way that we'll do this is definitely, definitely rolling up those short puts.
4697.36s:  That's going to happen.
4698.40s:  That has to happen at this point.
4700.40s:  And then from there...
4703.44s:  Yeah, from there, we will see.
4711.60s:  Because I'm going to try to put those, the short puts to be essentially,
4718.08s:  essentially parked right at the money.
4725.44s:  Yeah, super interesting.
4727.44s:  Well, we got a little bit of work to do then.
4740.40s:  I mean, realistically though, the year has been super, super mellow.
4744.72s:  So, you know, I'm kind of taking for what it is at this point.
4748.72s:  It's been very, very, very easy to make.
4755.52s:  So we need to add underneath CS required.
4763.52s:  I got to reformat these.
4765.36s:  That's okay.
4766.64s:  Cool.
4768.08s:  What else we got?
4768.88s:  Anything else we want to hit?
4773.20s:  Lauren says, I'm going to be so annoyed if GME bon cones on a day I'm busy at work.
4777.84s:  Well, you got to be prepared because you never know.
4780.32s:  You literally never know.
4782.08s:  Reese says you have a profit target in the coverage triangle.
4785.12s:  So the whole point of the coverage triangle is to maintain a long holding.
4791.20s:  So the way that it will work though as I'm moving into and out of the position is essentially
4797.36s:  if the underlying itself doubles.
4799.60s:  That's when I start scaling out, specifically for GameStop.
4803.12s:  Because what I did is I analyzed all the price, the previous price behavior for GameStop.
4810.40s:  And that's what I will base that off of.
4814.72s:  So yeah, I'm being just continue to run it.
4820.00s:  And then once we see a double of some sort, then I'll start scaling.
4827.28s:  Sweet.
4829.04s:  Well, that wraps me up for the pro members.
4831.52s:  Don't forget if you want to do the outlier options trading pair program.
4838.72s:  O T P P O O P P think O O T P P.
4845.36s:  Keep the acronyms.
4848.00s:  Don't forget to sign up.
4849.12s:  I'm going to look to kick that off probably next week.
4851.60s:  So I'm going to leave that open throughout the rest of the week for those interested in signing up.
4856.64s:  And then if there's anything you guys want me to take a look at it as always,
4860.24s:  let your boy know.
4861.44s:  Be in outlier.
4862.80s:  I'll see you guys later.
