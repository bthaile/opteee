0.00s: a really common issue for new options traders is not knowing or thinking through what structure
7.36s: to fit into the trade that you're looking at. So what this means is let's say that you're trying
12.32s: to play some sort of directional breakout to the upside. You're expecting a big movement.
16.88s: Yet maybe you're used to selling puts or selling put vertical spreads. Well the problem here is
24.08s: if you think about the profit mechanism in this instance being something going up a lot and then
29.12s: you sell a put or a put credit spread or you buy a call debit spread. Well you're capping your
36.80s: profit potential. So you're trading something that you're expecting a really big move but then you're
43.28s: capping your ability to actually capitalize from that big move. So really simple example of trying
48.96s: to make sure that the structure you're selecting fits the profit mechanism that you're trying
54.24s: to capture. Be an outlier. See you later.
