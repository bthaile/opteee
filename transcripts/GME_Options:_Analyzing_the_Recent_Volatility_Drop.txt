0.92s: what's up everyone somebody shot me a DM
2.88s: asking what I thought of the volatility
5.52s: movement in GameStop today and as you
7.88s: know I'm here for it happy to take a
9.16s: look so overall to me it looks like
11.68s: volatility is cratering that's what I'm
13.60s: seeing I'm it's essentially across the
15.36s: chain at this point and we're seeing
17.48s: broad approximation to the longer term
19.32s: expirations this front expiration cycle
21.84s: used to look really really hot and now
25.28s: it does not let me show you what I'm
27.76s: talking about so the 16th of June this
29.44s: was over the weekend on Sunday right
30.92s: before the shareholders meeting and VA
33.28s: was expanding pretty meaningfully up to
35.08s: 280% that's a lot one over a weekend to
38.96s: for a shareholders meeting a
40.28s: shareholders meeting typically isn't
41.88s: that big of an event you'll see that for
44.24s: really big news releases biotech phase
46.36s: trials stuff like that so the fact that
47.68s: it was getting that high was very
49.36s: interesting to me we had the
51.28s: shareholders meeting which a lot of you
53.60s: informed me that the perception was it
55.68s: was a nothing Burger not much was talked
57.24s: about and as I looked through the
59.20s: transcript I could see what you mean
61.08s: there was very little said it was all
62.88s: kind of broad brush stroke muscle
64.92s: movements not a lot of specifics so I
68.20s: now better understood that perspective
70.60s: and that led to volatility Contracting
72.76s: massively but I actually thought this
75.68s: was going to contract more the fact that
77.32s: it dropped 76 points is big but for
79.88s: something that elevated that much for
82.20s: that event and that little seemingly
85.60s: came out of that event I really thought
87.64s: this was going to fall more than it did
89.08s: but it didn't it still cratered a lot
91.08s: but not that much comparative to what I
93.72s: was expecting then fast forward to today
96.52s: after the close we have now VA down at
98.76s: 160 this is the jump I would have
101.12s: expected after that shareholders meeting
103.52s: going from 280 to 160 that was kind of
106.04s: maybe not all the way down to 160 but
107.48s: pretty close to that so the fact that we
110.60s: have now gone from 204 down to 160 is
113.32s: just tells me that the market is not
115.60s: expecting anywhere near the same volume
117.32s: of movement that we were expecting
118.76s: before and that also permeates to some
121.52s: of these surrounding expiration cycles
123.84s: that used to also be above 200 now
125.92s: they're 150 140 much much much lower so
130.96s: if we take a look at the options chain I
133.64s: want to highlight a few things for you
135.72s: all the very first one is when I look at
139.32s: the closer strikes to at the money so
143.44s: like 100 strikes I'm seeing right now
146.72s: open interest is still approximating
149.52s: toward WS the put side and if we include
153.32s: all of the strikes it still is but not
157.16s: as much so it tells me lots of people
158.92s: are playing with really far out ofth
161.08s: money options if we're talking looking
163.12s: at strikes that are 100 points away from
166.88s: the at the money so there's still very
170.20s: heavy call skew here surprisingly so to
172.96s: me to be honest with you now the other
175.68s: thing that I want to highlight is if we
177.24s: centralize this to the near-term
178.72s: expirations you'll notice that that of
180.24s: that 1.2 million that we saw across all
182.96s: chains all strikes about 818 th000 of
187.32s: that call oi is within this week and
189.68s: next week massive same thing for the put
192.68s: skew this is still essentially two to
195.00s: one called a put which is not normal
197.28s: normally it would maybe not be inverse
199.20s: you don't necessarily see that big of a
200.60s: disparity but you typically would see
202.76s: more puts than calls the markets tend to
206.48s: hedge the downside so this is still
210.40s: topical to me the fact that I see this
213.08s: much skew over this short of a time
215.96s: period because as soon as we start going
217.84s: further out let's say that we go out
219.44s: instead to like this 19 July 16 August
221.56s: and October take a look at the call oi
224.80s: and the put oi like it's much closer to
227.08s: parity and as you go further and further
229.08s: out that parity then eventually inverts
231.76s: like I would expect it to in normal
233.32s: markets so again that tells me that the
235.20s: market is kind of pricing in the action
238.00s: from within October essentially that's
240.96s: what I see here so far the other thing
243.40s: that we got to take a look at is the
244.56s: transaction volume for today calls and
246.20s: puts and it's very similar to what we
247.80s: saw yesterday much more call volume but
252.44s: again quick recap we got to get rid of
254.48s: between the market we can't tell if
256.44s: those are buying to open or selling to
258.32s: open but we can make some inferences
260.68s: based on if it transacts at the bid or
262.48s: the offer and in this case the fact that
265.12s: 39% of the calls transacted today were
268.36s: at the bid or below that tells me that
271.92s: those are again mostly sales more likely
275.20s: than not so that's again short calls
278.44s: whether they're part of a covered call
280.16s: which the disposition for the holder of
282.08s: that would still want it to go up I
283.60s: suspect a lot of those are probably
285.32s: covered calls but this still this is
287.28s: still people looking to capitalize on
290.16s: some of the volatility that we're seeing
292.04s: and they are trading at least the
293.96s: options to the downside that's why we
296.20s: would be selling calls at the bid or
298.92s: below now for the puts it's kind of an
301.28s: even split between potentially selling
304.48s: and buying today so not much to take
306.68s: away from there necessarily again more
309.88s: volatility focused if they're selling
311.52s: puts in my opinion because if you think
313.92s: GameStop or something like that is going
315.24s: to fly to the upside you wouldn't sell a
317.04s: put you would rather just either buy the
319.88s: stock buy calls something that would
321.96s: give you that uncapped upside potential
324.00s: cuz if you sell a put you don't get that
326.00s: so in this case of people selling puts I
327.76s: don't necessarily perceive that as
329.24s: massive bullish to me it seems more like
331.20s: we're just trying to squeeze this
332.96s: cratering volatility out which is
334.64s: actually a pretty smart play now from a
336.56s: technical perspective you have to be
337.88s: really really careful doing stuff like
339.68s: that in products like GameStop because
341.08s: it can go crazy at any point and you
342.88s: don't want to get stuck off sides with
345.00s: naked options trying to trade a little
346.56s: bit of all but I can see why it's
349.64s: happening the other things we got to
351.40s: take a look at super quick are the
354.00s: volume and if we see the volume
356.64s: transactions across the chains across
358.52s: the strikes again reflects what we see
361.12s: here but I want to Bon Us in on these
364.52s: near
365.84s: term and that actually surprises me
369.80s: 319,000 call volume compared to 149,000
375.52s: put volume now a lot of this can be
378.32s: potentially closing transactions
380.44s: actually yesterday when I was taking a
381.96s: look at this at this near-term
383.32s: expiration I was really surprised to see
385.92s: this the 30s actually bid up I I think
389.68s: these were at like 66,000 or something
391.36s: like that yesterday if I'm not
392.64s: misremembering so there definitely was a
394.88s: lot of sale volume that came in but
396.24s: there was even more buy volume that came
397.88s: in which I find interesting people are
399.84s: doing the cheap out- ofth money options
401.80s: thing and if I take a look at the volume
404.08s: again today now 42,000 contracts these
407.80s: expire in 3 days and the Market's not
409.60s: trading tomorrow so this is kind of
411.96s: crazy to me this is and I don't see the
414.32s: Catalyst right now that these people
416.24s: could be attempting to swing for the
417.96s: fences on but that's not a trivial
419.64s: amount of volume and again the
422.00s: volatility is now starting to Abate
423.92s: quite a lot so I don't see that the
425.60s: market even sees whatever Catalyst these
427.92s: people might be attempting to play now
430.48s: again the other thing to keep in mind is
432.24s: a lot of this can be sale volume which
434.48s: so far looks to be the case and that
437.56s: could just be people trying to capture
439.40s: these exceedingly exceedingly High
441.44s: premiums especially if they're covered
443.36s: with shares last thing we'll take a look
445.52s: at is the implied volatility let's take
447.60s: a look at the smile we'll look at the
448.72s: out of the monies for this this and I'm
450.68s: going to clear out a bunch of the
452.32s: different series to kind of decrease the
454.52s: noise and what do you notice even
456.84s: compared to yesterday really let me dump
459.12s: this one for
460.08s: now even compared to yesterday I see a
463.44s: couple massive changes so if spot price
466.36s: right now is about right there kind of
468.32s: where the vertical axis is of my cursor
472.12s: the first thing I noticed is that we are
473.88s: seeing way more tail side V put side
478.40s: which again makes a ton of sense for a
480.36s: quick recap on how to read this this is
482.44s: only looking at outof the- money options
484.72s: so all of the puts that are below the
487.52s: current price are out of the money and
489.20s: all the calls above are out of the money
491.60s: so when we're looking to this side of
493.64s: that cursor these are all out of the
495.24s: money and if you'll notice even compared
496.88s: to yesterday we started seeing a normal
499.44s: smile now it's actually putc where we're
502.52s: seeing way more all on the put side
504.44s: which again that starts pricing in
506.92s: downside expectation the cost side is
509.96s: flattened out quite a lot and that's a
512.68s: really steep smile at this point whereas
515.00s: if we look out to the 28 Junes slightly
517.60s: different story they are a little bit
521.04s: more normal I see kind of the way that
523.36s: this tailor up and out you you have to
526.20s: be careful with the way that you read
527.52s: this and the reason why you have to be
528.52s: careful is because since the stock is
530.56s: trading at 24 bucks it caps out to the
532.76s: downside so this might look like it's
534.68s: this really seemingly long tail part of
537.56s: that is because it's crazy that people
538.76s: are transacting all the way out here but
540.88s: it's also
541.92s: because this just has a natural floor of
544.56s: zero so there's just not much below you
547.20s: can go here so it might kind of skew
549.88s: your perception of what you're looking
551.08s: at a little bit so I want to call that
552.52s: out so what's the take away from here
555.40s: expiration for 21 June is pricing in put
559.84s: volatility
561.40s: premiums more normal skew more normal
564.92s: smile
565.96s: approximation 28 June is still more flat
570.28s: than I would expect to see and there
572.60s: absolutely is still some call skew so
575.52s: for example if I take back to current
578.28s: price and I go to the top of the the
581.56s: put volume I'm sorry volatility on the
585.12s: downside I want you to look over to the
587.36s: right and see how much of the Blue Line
588.96s: Peaks up above it's actually kind of
590.36s: behind my head let me slide out of the
592.56s: way take a look at the line to the right
595.24s: hand
596.12s: side so notice how if we go to the right
600.24s: there is still call Premium all the way
604.28s: all the way super high so essentially
607.04s: this is what we would be calling uh
608.72s: severity the Market's pricing in
610.64s: slightly if there is a catastrophic
613.04s: massive upside move they're demanding a
615.44s: premium for these really far out ofth
616.92s: the- money options because that's still
618.96s: not fully off the table otherwise you
620.52s: would not see this here and again I'm
622.24s: not here to spread hype or fud I am here
625.56s: to do my absolute best to look at the
627.52s: data and just share what I'm seeing so
629.64s: that you can make whatever inferences
631.44s: from it you choose but that's why that's
633.72s: there like that if we look at other
635.60s: products you don't see that kind of
637.48s: upside skew like this now again look at
640.48s: the put side there's nothing even close
642.20s: the market is not scared quite literally
644.52s: at all about a massive up move this week
647.28s: in terms of what it's pricing into the
648.56s: vaults as always if you have any
650.24s: questions just let me know I'm happy to
652.00s: take a look at this stuff any time I
653.84s: enjoy looking at options I do it
655.72s: literally all day every day so I'm here
658.24s: for it and also thank you guys for
660.12s: helping me understand some of the memes
661.60s: raring Kitty is dropping it's kind of
663.88s: fun learning more about the lore I'll
667.04s: see you guys on the next one
