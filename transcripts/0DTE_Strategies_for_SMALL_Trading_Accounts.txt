0.32s: what's up outliers Eric here we're going
2.28s: to talk about zero DTE strategies for
5.92s: small accounts for those that don't know
8.40s: I trade zero DTE literally every single
11.04s: day it's a big part of my book and in
14.16s: general I think they're very difficult
16.20s: to apply in smaller trading accounts but
19.00s: the goal of this video is to walk you
20.68s: through a little bit about the
22.44s: background of Zer DTE how it can make
24.28s: sense and then it give you some ideas on
26.52s: how it might be able to fit into your
28.52s: portfolio but it's a tight squeeze
30.28s: that's all there is to it I'm thinking
31.52s: of this from the context of like a
33.28s: $110,000 account and under but ideally
36.56s: we would be trading something way more
38.56s: than that and you'll see why that
39.68s: matters so much so let's dive straight
42.80s: in and get to it so what are zero DTE
45.04s: options well they're essentially options
47.00s: that expire the same day so today's the
49.08s: 10th of September if I traded which I
51.12s: did zero DTE it means I trade options
53.48s: that are expiring the very same day
55.28s: that's all and what's the idea behind
57.52s: this well a lot of people think it's
59.20s: fast easy money which I guarantee you it
61.92s: is anything but that however there is a
64.72s: significant opportunity available in
67.76s: zero DTE options so here are a couple
70.84s: studies that you can take a look at this
72.68s: is called zero DTE trading rules and
74.92s: then this one is called retail Traders
76.36s: love zero DTE options but should they
78.52s: and these talk a bit about the
80.36s: phenomenon of zero DTE options and I'll
83.24s: explain exactly what this is and for
85.64s: those that are in the patreon you can
87.84s: download I have a file that kind of
89.48s: compiles SS all of these studies for e
91.48s: but these are all free and accessible
92.96s: for everybody you can just look them up
94.52s: on ssrn so what's the profit mechanism
97.08s: for zero DTE options in this case I'm
100.08s: primarily looking at variance risk
102.60s: premiums what is that simply put it's
105.12s: the tendency for implied volatility to
107.56s: Trend over historic volatility I have a
110.48s: video that goes into zero DTE in detail
114.08s: that I'll link to below it's literally
115.84s: an entire playlist but there's one
117.44s: specifically called Master zero DTE
119.32s: options that I'll share with you so that
122.04s: you can learn way more about the
123.40s: background I want to kind of build off
125.52s: of that spend less time on the
126.92s: theoretical background and talk about
128.44s: the application so this is essentially
130.80s: Varian RIS premiums and what you'll
132.44s: notice is these yellow lines represent
134.40s: implied volatility which is forward
136.04s: looking these white lines represent
137.88s: historic volatility which is backwards
139.56s: looking and you'll notice that in
141.08s: general the yellow lines are above the
143.52s: white lines in general there will be
145.44s: periods that the white lines come above
147.72s: the yellow lines but it's not ways and
150.40s: you'll also notice some very specific
152.20s: qualities about the lines when it does
154.36s: that which we'll talk a little bit about
156.48s: more in detail so what's going on here
159.32s: again not to rehash the other videos but
161.32s: to get everybody level set this is
163.08s: simply the tendency for options to be
165.60s: priced too richly with respect to
168.08s: volatility compared to what the market
170.96s: ends up moving which again that's what
173.36s: historic volatility is so we're
175.28s: expecting in pricing in more movement
177.92s: than is actually happening and this this
179.96s: is very persistent again you can check
182.28s: out those studies not take my word for
184.52s: it I will always do my best to connect
186.24s: you with resources that you can look it
188.04s: for yourself and if we look back over a
190.36s: longer term time frame again you'll see
192.08s: that this is generally the case there
194.28s: will be periods where it's not again
195.92s: take a close look at those periods
197.80s: because it's an important factor so
200.12s: that's in a nutshell what zero DTE
202.64s: options are all about so what's the
204.40s: signal exactly what we just talked about
206.48s: now that signal can be caused by event
209.92s: related things so maybe an fomc
212.28s: announcement is coming out and that's
213.56s: driving up volatility or just the
215.68s: overall Persistence of Varian or
217.28s: premiums which again is a documented
218.88s: phenomenon now one really important
221.04s: admin note here is for people that sell
223.16s: volatility very often hear the idea of
225.76s: you know we sell V when it's high and
227.84s: buy when it's low that's actually not
230.04s: exactly correct it's kind of a a simple
232.44s: way to create a rule of thumb but it's
235.52s: not representative and I'll show you
237.32s: what that means really the signal and
239.92s: what matters in this case what we're
241.24s: measuring is IV over HV this can happen
245.08s: if implied volatility is high or this
247.36s: can happen if implied volatility is low
249.96s: and I'll show that to you so if we take
251.72s: a look at this period here we can see
254.64s: over the past year which this is what's
256.96s: showing you again that's what the
258.52s: aggregation is of the chart you'll see
260.20s: that this is actually the highest period
261.88s: of volatility over the past year for
264.28s: short-term V and then for 30-day V it's
266.88s: the second highest compared to this
268.32s: period over here so volatility on a
270.08s: relative basis is very very high in the
272.48s: instance yet realized volatility or
275.08s: historic volatility is even higher so
277.40s: this is an example where if you sold
279.60s: volatility when it's high it didn't
281.84s: matter because you still got beat out by
283.72s: price so again the important is the
286.60s: relationship between implied and
289.44s: historic that's actually what these
291.12s: purple lines plot for us I can get rid
293.68s: of all these yellow lines and just have
295.48s: these purple lines cuz that's it's
296.88s: charting the difference for the same
298.68s: time frames between and again for those
300.56s: that are in the patreon there's a
302.12s: download available in the shop that's
303.88s: free for all patreon members that has
305.80s: this very thing script for you it's one
307.80s: that as you could tell I I use all the
309.88s: time because it helps me visualize this
311.84s: so that's the signal now when it comes
313.80s: to capturing I'm going to use things
315.76s: like short options I use short strangles
318.16s: or short straddles but that's not going
320.20s: to work for small accounts because if
322.52s: you are on a regulation te account it's
325.56s: going to be probably hundreds of
327.12s: thousands of dollars if you want to sell
329.00s: a $20 Delta short strangle for example
331.88s: in SPX so then we have to think about
334.72s: and for those that are curious in a
336.04s: portfolio margin account it's like
338.12s: $75,000 so that's going to be heavy for
341.08s: most smaller Traders so then how can we
343.48s: think about a way to run this approach
346.40s: well I back tested it for us so that we
348.36s: have some data that we can look at again
350.60s: the way that I do this is ideally built
354.00s: on a process that's deployed long term
356.20s: so that's why back testing something
358.40s: like this it actually doesn't involve a
360.00s: lot of discretion it's kind of generally
362.12s: running the strategy and that's why
363.80s: you'll notice I have this concept of
366.24s: occurrence-based and careful discretion
368.76s: because I am still discretionary there
370.48s: are certain conditions that based on my
372.28s: personal strategy will lead me to enter
374.28s: or not enter or delay an entry but you
376.80s: have to be so careful about it because
378.64s: the performance of all this this
380.72s: specific kind of strategy it's kind of
382.36s: an aggregate numbers sort of thing as
385.00s: you have more and more occurrences the
387.40s: output will approximate toward WS the
390.00s: value of the strategy so if you start
391.80s: cutting too many occurrences because of
393.96s: discretion that's skewed in some way
395.84s: that will drastically impact your
397.60s: results so using discretion is
399.92s: completely okay but you have to very
401.92s: carefully track it so that you're not
403.84s: killing the output of the system so
406.20s: let's take a look at a couple studies
407.60s: again the other videos in the playlist
409.60s: have huge study sets on this so I'm
411.92s: going to skip through some of the high
413.12s: points I already know based on my
414.88s: studies that the better entry times are
417.04s: later in the day so this is looking at
418.96s: Eastern St or time essentially 1330 or
421.72s: 1400 entry periods tend to be best so I
424.40s: carry that through the study this is
426.04s: just looking at short calls Deltas long
428.76s: call short putut long put Deltas the lot
431.04s: size in this scenario is looking at a
432.76s: two lot and then these are all going to
434.64s: be zero DTE there's no Max profit
437.20s: applied to any of them but there is a
439.00s: stop- loss applied and again this is
440.56s: based on what I've seen previously that
442.28s: not having a Max profit tends to
443.96s: increase the performance you can again
445.92s: go back to the playlist that I
447.08s: referenced before that goes to all of
448.60s: this super far detail so this is looking
450.68s: at a 10 Delta strangle 15 Delta strangle
453.00s: 10 Delta strangle 15 Delta strangle at
455.48s: 1330 1400 respectively and you can see
457.84s: that these are good performing
459.08s: strategies the reason why I show you the
460.92s: difference in a half hour between these
462.68s: is to show General robustness around the
465.00s: time frame then I take a look at adding
467.24s: wings so I have a 10 15 strangle but I'm
470.44s: buying the five Delta wings for both I
473.56s: do that at 1330 and then 1400 you could
476.24s: see at 1330 it does not do well you can
479.20s: see
480.00s: one important difference here though
481.76s: take a look at the width of the spread 5
483.88s: Points versus 10 points take a look at
486.00s: the change in p&l it's much much much
489.08s: higher performing at the wider spread
491.32s: with no p&l management applied then when
494.52s: we take a look at 1400 which is again
497.68s: I'm just picking a time period I'm not
499.32s: trying to optimize it heavily I'm just
501.24s: trying to show you a concept so if we
503.96s: take a look at 10 Delta 15 Delta again
506.60s: doing the entry at 1400 notice that the
508.88s: performance increases massively for the
512.20s: kind of wider iron Condors well really
514.28s: for this but again take a look at the
516.16s: width of strikes and take a look at the
518.36s: impact of performance so the first
519.96s: takeaway you can grab from here is that
521.72s: wider is better now this is going to be
523.84s: dependent on what your account can
525.80s: afford because if you're doing something
527.92s: like a 15 Delta and five Delta we can
530.68s: look at it together really quick let's
532.44s: grab I'll use a one DTE it's not going
534.56s: to matter because it's a defined risk
536.16s: trade but let's sell this 15 Delta and
539.04s: buy the five and then let's do the same
541.60s: thing on this side we'll sell the
543.80s: closest to 15 and then we'll buy the
546.12s: five and then let's take a look at what
548.36s: that grabs us for margin requirement
550.20s: it's four grand so even if you have a
552.84s: smaller account again if you have a
554.32s: $5,000 account this is now your entire
556.44s: account in a trade that's kind of
557.64s: dangerous and the other problem you have
559.16s: is if you have a $5,000 account you're
561.04s: risking
562.64s: 3265 which is way too much so you might
565.92s: have to start playing and that's why I
567.68s: show you with a stop loss and you
569.64s: actually notice it really improves the
572.04s: performance of the strategy for both now
574.40s: a really important note this is in a
576.88s: frictionless environment this is not
578.68s: including fees this is not including
580.56s: spread which would absolutely chew these
583.24s: to Pieces the performance for all of
585.16s: these will contract meaningfully so one
587.40s: of the ideas is to decrease occurrences
589.64s: number of Trades it's to decrease the
591.40s: number of legs as much as possible and
593.56s: we want to try and touch the trade as
595.76s: little as possible once it's on because
597.84s: fees are quite detrimental now the last
600.12s: thing I wanted to show you however is
601.92s: that the 10o yde 20 Delta did not
604.88s: perform quite as well it had a decent
607.60s: win rate but still underperformed but
609.84s: again the 20 Delta 5 Delta without
613.20s: profit management absolutely crushed the
615.84s: 15 Delta 5 Delta without profit
618.60s: management so there's absolutely an
620.88s: important argument to be made for
622.76s: managing profit on the iron Condors or
625.64s: the spreads that are being used but
628.08s: again in a non-f frictionless
630.20s: environment that includes fees and
631.56s: transaction costs there is absolutely a
634.16s: cost associated with it so let's talk
636.08s: about a couple other things really
637.52s: quickly I want to highlight this path
639.44s: dependence and I actually asked you to
641.44s: pay attention to this earlier path
643.32s: dependence is essentially one of the
645.48s: properties you'll find in returns in
647.44s: general and volatility really amplifies
649.60s: it cuz volatility does This Thing Called
651.48s: cluster where when it goes through a
653.56s: transition it tends to hang out in a new
655.76s: place for a little while before it
657.04s: transitions again so if we take a look
659.44s: at short-term volatility which is the
661.80s: white line and the bright yellow line
663.92s: you'll notice that when it's breached it
666.20s: tends to be breached for a few days
668.64s: before it comes back down so for example
671.00s: in this case uh December 20th it was
673.76s: still okay with slight vrp then on the
676.68s: 21st we actually turn negative then if
680.52s: we go to the 22nd we're still negative
683.40s: if we go to the 26th we're negative go
686.36s: to the
687.24s: 27th we're coming back to break even so
690.12s: what I'm highlighting in this instance
691.96s: is for me if I get stopped out and I
694.92s: know that volatility is starting to
697.08s: expand I actually might not Place some
699.76s: trades on additional that's the
701.36s: discretionary portion because I know
703.16s: volatility tends to Cluster it's very
704.92s: infrequent that you'll see where this
706.56s: white L like this here where historic
708.56s: volatility exceeds implied and it's only
710.64s: for a day it's infrequent that I see
712.52s: that so a lot of the times when I'm
713.96s: trading variance risk premiums I will
716.24s: wait until historic volatility on a
718.72s: short-term time time frame is less than
720.64s: implied volatility because again if you
722.52s: just do it at nauseum completely
724.76s: indiscretion you'll get these results
726.52s: which are still good you can optimize
728.36s: them a little bit so zero GTE for
730.76s: beginners and specifically small
733.08s: accounts I think that they absolutely
735.88s: can be applied but they have to be very
738.36s: very very carefully used because for
740.64s: example even if you have a $10,000
742.68s: account and you look at the 15 and fives
744.72s: and you're like wow that's pretty good
745.88s: $49,000 return on a two lot well here's
748.28s: the problem the loss is $650 so even if
751.28s: you have a $10,000 account that's way
754.52s: too big of a loss on an individual trade
757.40s: because these again are path dependent
760.28s: and you need a number of occurrences in
762.72s: order for the returns to approximate so
765.24s: if you have a $10,000 account you might
767.92s: actually have to look at a slightly
769.60s: suboptimal 10 and five wide so that your
772.28s: max loss is now contained to 860 bucks
776.16s: which I actually would argue is still a
777.76s: little bit too high you might have to be
779.60s: even tighter than that so the main issue
782.44s: that small accounts are going to find
784.48s: when trading something like this is the
786.60s: ability to put on something that is
788.48s: logical that makes a decent return that
791.16s: still captures the benefit of what the
793.96s: structure is and what the profit
795.44s: mechanism is without giving up too much
798.16s: profit in order to reduce Max risk
800.80s: that's the main issue that these are
802.08s: going to run into now the last thing I
803.68s: want to highlight is for me if I'm going
805.76s: to let them go into expiration it has to
807.92s: be European style option if it's not
810.36s: European style options then you have the
812.60s: risk of assignment and that opens a big
815.68s: problem the other benefit to using
817.52s: something like SPX as compared to other
820.28s: products you can use something like
822.48s: xxxp which is slightly smaller it's
824.76s: going to be less liquid and the problems
826.56s: you're going to face in this in terms of
828.56s: spreads are going to be exacerbated but
830.20s: it's also doable but the other benefit
832.40s: you get is section 1256 of the tax code
835.52s: where 60% of the gains are going to be
837.28s: longterm and 40% will be short ter which
839.44s: will be at your rate the last note is
841.92s: that when it starts to suck is when it's
844.20s: important to keep doing the strategy
846.08s: because the way that this works if you
848.08s: follow the math on your average win it's
850.80s: $200 for I'm just picking this 10 Delta
853.32s: here randomly your average loss is 465
856.56s: so as soon as you have one loss it's at
858.52s: least wiped out two wins and again
860.84s: that's in a frictionless environment it
862.48s: probably would be a little bit worse
863.88s: than that if we're looking at the
865.04s: spreads it's even worse still if we're
867.12s: looking at the $10 short s $5 Longs you
871.00s: have $107 average win with $220 average
875.24s: loss not terrible but then if you're
876.80s: doing the 15 and fives 220 average win
879.68s: 714 average loss so really really
882.08s: difficult to make these up without
883.92s: giving yourself enough Runway to get
886.28s: enough occurrences on so another thing
888.04s: that I like to look at and I can look at
889.64s: in a future study if we' want is the uh
892.76s: propensity for average losing streaks so
895.40s: that you have an idea of what that looks
896.76s: like I use that pretty heavily in all of
898.76s: mine my strategy so that I can at least
901.04s: have an understanding of what is likely
903.40s: to occur it's not limited to that you
905.04s: can always have longer streaks but it
906.36s: gives me some ideas so it doesn't feel
908.00s: like I'm flying quite blind so hope the
910.56s: video is useful specifically zert
912.68s: options for small accounts it's a tricky
914.64s: Prospect but can be done SPX again is
918.00s: the preferable tool in my opinion but
919.92s: something like XSP is also viable and it
