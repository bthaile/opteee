 back to the basics. I'm going to walk you through five investing and trading fundamental concepts that I lean on very heavily for my own success and it centered on one general concept, really, in the basics. You've heard me say this before because in the Marine Corps, we deployed all the time. We are focused on the skill sets that have the highest probability of application and what really lead to ultimate success. That is all trading is about. Now, it's kind of a fairies because in trading, we start from a point where you go through this big cycle. The first part of the cycle is you don't know anything. You learn a few fundamental concepts, but you can't really deploy them effectively. Think if you pick up a new sport, think if you're playing basketball. This is when you can't really dribble the ball well, you can't really hit a jump shot because your form sucks, those kinds of things. Then we learn a bunch of stuff. Now, we know all different strategies, different products and we're starting to get it together, but you don't really have a bunch of success. This is kind of like in basketball. When you're trying all these different things, you're trying to play down on the post. Now you're playing up as a guard. Now you're trying to get really good at passing. You're trying to find what works for you. Then at the other end of this, we kind of start returning back to very basic concepts that we can execute exceptionally well. That is what I want to focus on in today's session. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to Allie Outliers. A huge shout out to the YouTube members and the Patreon family. Thank you guys so much for the support and let's get right into this video. Now the first thing I want to start with actually is is this. This is one of my favorite things. This is from Goodreads.com. It's a pretty cool website, but I just really like this quote and it's something that I think about pretty regularly. So let's check it out. It is from Leonardo Da Vinci and it says simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This goes back to exactly what I was just talking about. It's this idea of trying a lot of different things, then distilling it down to the simplest concepts that you can deploy extremely well. That will take you much further than trying to reinvent all of these crazy ideas and thinking that you're going to be the one. Some people will. Some people can develop a brand new strategy, carve new ground and do really well. I am stoked for them. I am here to make money. That's what I care about. What gets me to that goal most efficiently? And we're going to talk about that. To get us started, let's take a look at the first one and you'll notice that there are going to be action items for each one. So I'm going to walk you through the concept and then I'm going to give you a specific action item that applies to that concept so that you have clear take away through this whole thing. So the very first one, risk first. You can't trade no money. This is probably one of the most slept on overlooked concepts that I can conceive of for traders and it's because we're too worried about the profits. We're thinking more about how much money we're going to make. What we're going to do with all the money we're going to make. All of those kinds of things and it leads to taking on too much risk and losing money. So what is the action item here? It's pretty simple. Every single trade and your entire portfolio as a whole must always have defined risk. This does not mean you can only trade risk defined strategies like vertical spreads. That's not what I mean. If you buy stock every single stock transaction that you make before you even enter it should have a pre-determined loss. If you bought a stock at $10, your risk is set at $7. You're willing to accept that $3 drop. Whatever it is for you, it should be defined and then there should be no questions asked. Once you get there, it's made its move. It's time to get out. This is actually why I typically like to use two stops. I have a first threshold. This is kind of when I really take a look at something. See if I want to stay in or get out at that point and then I have a hard threshold. This is when I'm just wrong. I'm just wrong and it's time to get out. That is probably one of the most pivotal changes somebody can make as a trader is taking the effort to define every single trade. Now as a portfolio, you might have single trades. Let's say you have 30 single trades and you start losing on all of them. Well, that means that your whole portfolio is going to be suffering. You got to define it for the portfolio too. This is because if it's going to tell you a lot of stuff. So in that same example, if you have 30 trades and 20 of them start losing your portfolio draws down 30% which it should not do. But let's say it does draw down 30%. Now you're looking at it saying, oh man, what's going on here? Here's the deal. I can already tell you you have 20 trades that are behaving way too similarly at the same time. Your portfolio risk is massive. Even though you think you're doing a good job bucketing all of these different trades, maybe managing the risk in each individual trade, it needs to make sense at the trade level and then as an entire portfolio. Next one, making a plan. You've heard me talk about this a million times, but I like to use an example here. If you think about a sports team or a business, what entity typically wins? Is it the entity that just kind of starts something spontaneously and then tries to figure it out as they go day by day? I can't think of a successful entity that operates that way. Sure, you can have spontaneous components to what you do. However, if you do not take the time to plan, you are going to get eaten alive. It is important to remember who is in the stock market. And it's a lot of people who want your money and they're willing to put in the time to plan. They're willing to put in the time to research what you do so that they can capitalize on it as efficiently as possible. I have a video on the notes below that talks about Wall Street versus retail. And there's some really important different concepts and approaches that I think you need to be aware of. So with that, what's the action plan? Got a creative trading plan. I will throw a video in the show notes below. The whole idea of a trading plan is it gives you a few things. One, it gives you a mental exercise to actually think something through as best you can from start to finish. News flash, the first one you do is going to suck. That's why it needs to evolve over time as you learn more. But going through that painful process will save you a lot of money and it will actually help you make a lot of money because the second thing is you will start to control for variables that you can then optimize and make them better. That is how you make money long term in the market. Next one, simple strategies. So like I said, simplicity, ultimate form of sophistication, brilliance at the basics. We kind of talked about this at the beginning. So what does this mean? I'm talking about exploring efficiently. Like I said, we all go through this cycle where we don't know a lot and suck at deploying whatever we know. We start learning things, start to figure it out, and then we kind of refine back down. You have to go through that phase. Just about everybody does, you have to figure out what it is. So when I say explore efficiently, that doesn't mean don't try the complex strategies, but it's to remember that you are going to want to be able to distill anything you do down to the simplest concepts that will get you much further than having this crazy list of criteria that your one trade has to hit in order for it to work 60% of the time. You're going to realize that's really difficult to find and put on for the long run. Again, if we're trading successfully, this should be a 40, 50, 60 year long endeavor. Begin with the end in mind. It is completely fine to try all different kinds of things I encourage you to. However, start taking clear notes on what's working for you and then start distilling that down into the basic concepts so that you can really spend time building what is actually working for you as compared to just trying all these neat new things that you see every day because they're going to be there. The next one tracking results. So as we're talking about exploring efficiently, we've already have a trading plan started. You have to create a supporting data set. Think about the movie Moneyball where they essentially started bringing statistics into baseball and people are like, what do you mean you're going to get rid of this big name dude that plays baseball really well? Legs are gone. Great. We'll be lucky to get 60 games out of you. Why do you like them? Because he gets on base and you're hitting this guy when the guy's like, well, because he gets on base, what they're talking about is creating an objective data set to make better decisions. Literally every successful entity does this. Data-driven decision making is massive and it's because of how fallible the human psyche is. But then there's no more guesswork. If you're trading short strangles and you're like, well, is it better to trade 35 days or 20 days? I'll tell you what's not the correct answer to see what tasty trade says in their research and then just trying to copy that. That doesn't work and the written that's not shitting on tasty trade. I like them overall. But they have a specific business and they have a specific way of going about that business. The best possible way to create success long term trading is to create your own data set. And this is going to fit neatly into your trading log, which again, I will throw a video in the show notes below so that you can figure out how to do the trading plan and the trading log. All right, the last one here, reviewing and optimizing. Or iron sharpens iron and remaining relevant two different things. The first thing iron sharpens iron. This is another thing we say in the military. I actually think it's biblical nature. But what we're talking about is being receptive. Even once you know what you're doing, being receptive to feedback, being receptive to looking at your own work, acknowledging the fact that there might be a better way to do it and continually looking for that. This is why you see people like Kobe Bryant in the gym working his ass off, rest in peace, but working his ass off, even though he already had a bunch of rings. And it's because he was still at it. He was still at the drawing board. He was still wanting to sharpen every single piece of his game. That is the same thing for trading if you want to be successful. And then the second part here is remaining relevant. This might sound weird, but things change. Things change over time. The perfect example this past week in the newsletter outlier insights. It's completely free. If you're not signed up, again, that's also in the notes below. But I was talking about post earnings announcements drift, which is after we have an earnings announcement with a big move, a big beat or loss. The underlying tends to track in that movement. That's already changed. Whereas large liquid underlines very much now do not follow what we used to see them do. And it's because things change. Markets change information changes. You have to stay relevant. You were going to be in for a rude awakening. If you think the one thing you do now is going to work for that 50, 60 year long runway that we're hoping for, you've got to stay relevant. You've got to continue looking at what you're doing, evolving to the current markets, looking for the next effective approach because it continues to change over time. So with this, you have to create a priority list. And what I mean by that is what matters to you? What are we trading for? What are we attempting to accomplish? And then based on that priority list, we're going to create metrics that assess our progress towards towards those priorities. And then we're going to set a cadence to review them. I like to look at things loosely daily, weekly and loosely. I mean, just kind of going through my notes, no specific structure. I kind of have a routine built over time. But it's just a cursory overview. There's a handful of things I'm looking for. What stood out? What outliers do I have for profits? losses a whole times compared to my trading plan, all of those sorts of things. But then I have a in-depth monthly review where I actually built a checklist that I go through line by line in Excel and track my results so that I can review them month over month to make sure that I'm in pursuit successfully of my annual goal, my two year goal, my five year goal, you believe it by 10 year goal. I'm going out 10 years and I'm measuring my performance monthly against that. Is it a perfect science? No, sometimes you hit them, sometimes you don't. But I need to make sure I'm trending in the right direction. And that is an incredibly important exercise. So if there's anything that I missed, throw it in the comments below. Also, I'm curious, what's your favorite out of this? Maybe I'll do a specific video that dives into that a little bit more. But until next time, be an outlier, see you all later.
