0.00s: What's up, outliers? Welcome to a new podcast episode. This is actually Shrey J's Brain
8.96s: Child. We were talking in the community about different ways to convey information and
16.00s: Shrey had the idea for this podcast, which we're calling outlier trading unfiltered. The
22.08s: goal for this is to try and explore topics of interest to the community, whether it's stuff that
28.08s: we recently covered, something that the community is struggling with trying to work through,
32.24s: that we think is beneficial for just broader folks to be aware of, to think through themselves.
38.80s: The reason why Shrey J is such a good fit to do this is actually because he's been in the
45.76s: community essentially since the beginning. So he knows the way that I think in the way that I do
51.84s: business very well. And he's also familiar enough and more temporally proximal to the new trader
61.04s: journey, which is a lot of you know, I literally started in 2007. I've been doing this for nearly
67.44s: two decades. I definitely remember some of the aspects of when I started, but I'm under no
73.60s: false pretence that I somehow completely understand the paradigm of like the beginner trader today.
80.64s: So I think he will be super useful in helping bridge that gap because sometimes when I'm
88.00s: explaining something or talking about something, I will think all the dots are connected,
93.92s: we're at a good point and this topic is like you know, well discussed. And in my own ignorance,
100.64s: I'll kind of forget the point that in that conversation or in that thought line, there might be
106.16s: several things that I'm taking for granted on the other side of the equation and the other trader
111.36s: might be like, yo, what is implied volatility, right? Like something that simple, like I take that
116.40s: as granted, but it might not be. So first of all, Shrey J, welcome on again. It's been a while since
123.28s: we did any sort of video together, but I'm super, super stoked to do this with you to chat. And I think
130.32s: it'll be genuinely like really, really useful for people. So thank you for doing this and then also
135.44s: thank you for recommending the idea because this wasn't on my radar, but we can make things happen.
141.04s: So welcome on man. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you a lot. I'm really happy to be here.
146.08s: Thanks for having me. It's always a blast chatting with you. I really enjoy it. But before we get to
151.36s: the main topic, I actually want to do take a few minutes diving to some of the market updates
156.32s: from this week. Did anything from banks earnings that I've reported so far? Catch your eye?
162.72s: Hmm, a couple things I think in general, the health of the consumer is still like profound.
170.32s: I also think that you're getting a glimpse as to how effectively the banks are going to be able
174.72s: to navigate the lower rate environment because you can see that across the board a lot of the
180.48s: banks are beating, right? So if we look at Bank of America, they did okay, even Goldman Sachs,
186.32s: they had a gap up. They did okay. So you're also seeing it across like different size banks,
193.92s: different general leanings for the banks walls far go. Apparently they were able to open up a
199.52s: big a bunch of like fake accounts for people. So they absolutely crushed it. You never know what
204.56s: those guys if it's actually good earnings enough, but so far it looks really good. I think the
209.84s: financial sector has just been displaying unmitigated strength. Like that's what continues to stick
215.68s: out to me at the sector level and then you can see it across the sub sectors. I think the most
222.16s: interesting thing is death definitely charge offs and seeing the difference between commercial
227.60s: level charge offs and consumer level and the consumer is still strong. And I think a lot of people
234.16s: haven't really expected that at least up into this point because it's been kind of a challenging
239.52s: environment for a lot of people. Especially if you consider stuff like the average mortgage payment
246.88s: as a percentage of disposable income. If you've taken a mortgage out since the rate
251.04s: environments have been up, it's way higher. That's not easy on people. Yet there's still finding ways
258.24s: to engage, essentially across everybody offer different terms, offer ways to lower down,
265.44s: mortgage rates and whatnot. So overall synopsis of all of that robust. Like that's what strikes
272.64s: me. The financial sector looks really robust and the deregulate story environment with Trump.
278.64s: I mean, you can see that just bleeding through. That's why we saw one of the initial moves in
283.28s: financials when Trump had won and I think that that's just continuing to play out.
288.16s: Yeah, I think I'd agree particularly in the big banks that they've once that do the investing
292.64s: business investing banking business. They're a lack of fees. They've been more constantly
297.76s: checking mortgage.js. There's M&E activity going on. IPU activity that they're exposed to.
304.00s: So generally good revenue, they're continuing to generate more assets and management from both
310.16s: the asset and wealth department. So even like you mentioned, the consumer facing banks are actually
315.44s: doing well as well. The consumer doesn't seem that stressed, at least from the reporting that they
321.60s: will follow somehow had to have an opportunity to drop off the net loan charge off that they're
328.56s: doing. So they're able to get away with that. So I guess they have more money to invest
334.00s: them back up low bike records. So we'll see what happens. But from last week, I was particularly
340.80s: interested in delta airlines earnings. I didn't know if you called that. They were talking about
346.24s: expanding the premium offering premium seats. And that was that is a certain shift in how things
352.24s: are done in the airline industry. Usually to be cramming as many number of people that
356.88s: building up units. Like how we talk about, right? Just getting to getting to revenue from that.
362.24s: But now it seems like they're expanding their offerings, doing upgrades within existing airplanes,
368.08s: retrofitting them and ordering new planes with larger number of private or premium seats. So
373.52s: yeah, really interesting economy where they are able to see that. There's a section of
378.96s: consumer so can pay more and hire much and generate hire much and from that.
383.20s: The interesting thing about that is in environments like this, especially the higher rate
389.20s: environment, the unfortunate reality is those of us with money just get more.
395.76s: That like that is how it goes. It's it's shitty to say, but that is the reality. And I've talked
402.72s: about this. Like not only just my own trading returns, but the last few years have been my hands
409.20s: down most profitable since I've started this whole thing. And these kind of environments help a lot.
417.68s: So it's one of those really nasty dichotomy of just human existence.
424.64s: Where those with this kind of environment, it actually doesn't really hurt that bad in in some ways.
431.28s: It's quite beneficial. And then those without they're just punch twice because now they're just
437.12s: trying to make ends meet and shit's more expensive and like definitely feel fuel for that group.
443.12s: So the reason why I make that point is I actually had in one of my notes from like three years ago
453.04s: a couple. I do like outlines on some themes that I think are going to happen with different
460.00s: industries broadly, just that curiosity and one of the things I literally talked about was
467.52s: premium airlines. I actually think that this might be the beginning. I think that you might find that
473.76s: there could be flights that are not on 747s, but slightly smaller planes. But are a kind of gap
482.40s: between private and commercial. Because there's an appetite for that. I think the airline
490.00s: industry has been so interesting because there are a product of what consumers wanted.
494.56s: Right? Consumers themselves were the ones saying like, we want cheaper tickets. We want cheaper tickets.
500.00s: Well, what do you think comes with cheaper tickets? Smaller seats. You're going to get one
506.48s: thing of peanuts if you're lucky. Right? Like that's what makes cheaper tickets. Now again,
513.12s: I'll always make the point. The CEOs always seem to be doing okay. So I don't think they're
519.36s: margins are quite that bad. The CEO compensation for these things is tens of millions of year,
525.68s: which is insane. So yeah, I'm not sitting here saying like, whoa, is the airlines. They're doing
532.48s: all right. But that is a byproduct of that pressure and that preference for the consumer of
539.76s: things being cheaper. But I think exactly like we were kind of talking about a little bit earlier.
544.88s: We absolutely are starting to see that there is definitely appetite for the higher end consumer
551.28s: for a different experience. And I'll definitely tell you from my own. Like the first time you fly
556.80s: even first class, it changes. Like it changes a lot because you no longer dread getting on the plane
565.84s: at all. Like you know that you're going to have a spot for your bag above your head. So you never
570.80s: have to play the game of like, oh, I don't want to check a bag. So I got to make sure I get on my
574.00s: seat quick. So I have a space for my bag. That goes away. And you're in like genuinely comfortable
580.08s: seating. So when you're on a 10 hour flight, 15 hour flight, even the life-latt seats. Like that's a
586.88s: game changer. So yeah, I think for people that have the ability to travel in any version of those levels,
595.20s: it's typically really, really nice compared to the alternative. So yeah, I imagine the demand
601.12s: for real actually continue. And it wouldn't surprise me to see these hybrid spin-off
606.56s: like offerings at some point. I don't think it could be for a while. But at some point,
610.48s: because margins for airlines aren't that great. All things can fit in. Yeah, yeah, it makes sense.
615.12s: It might have been, I do see that the potential of pod for them. Cool. I thought I'll give a
621.68s: little bit of introduction to myself since it's been quite a while. I've been on the channel. So
626.72s: I, well, I see described I've came across a channel about five years ago. I'm an engineer by
634.00s: training, but I'm a trader at heart. I accidentally came across your channel on
640.16s: through a Reddit post. In fact, the post was talking about the nuances of covered-striangle
645.52s: versus the real, the common section of that post was on fire. It was sending you to the
652.80s: Netherrealm company. It was like what we call bad out there. I'm like this guy's about that
657.68s: value. He's trying to teach us something important here. This value here. So that's how I came to
663.60s: visit the YouTube and I stayed there since it has been really five years. It's difficult for me to
670.48s: comprehend all that have learned during that time. But the first two of those years, we just
676.08s: mean, I think this would be helpful for people starting out in our community now. The first two years,
681.76s: if it was just deep diving. I was immersing myself in the content. You kept putting out so many videos
688.24s: after video. There's so much to learn and I kept just watching it, rewatching it and then slowly
695.28s: after maybe six or seven months. The good thing about me was I did not have to unlearn bad trading habits.
701.76s: So I was a clean slate that helped me to pick up information at the right point. So that I'm
707.44s: really fortunate that way. I was mostly implying whole investor before, you know, getting interested
712.96s: in trading. So I used the two years to mostly learn about what you're talking about. Why does
717.52s: this do keep saying process all the time? Just tell me how to make the body. Why does he keep
721.92s: saying the process process process? What does he mean by that? So I had to understand what that is.
726.48s: So start building logs. That's where I started after watching the videos. Then I made a trading plan,
733.04s: a trading log. And then in half way through the third years when I had enough confidence to
739.12s: deploy cash in real markets after going through paper trading for when you were before that.
745.36s: And since then I've just been doing it. So I wanted to talk about that a little bit because
750.88s: people always want to rush into deploy cash in the markets and real time. Little work is
756.56s: done trying to understand and prepare and just practice. There's no patience. It's difficult.
762.24s: Obviously we need to get to where we need to go past. And that's hard for for in an environment like
769.04s: markets where there are no rules, no boundaries. We can get slapped quickly. So yeah, so more than
777.44s: anything I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you particularly for showing the path.
783.28s: And then hammering it into our heads that it even we can do it. And then giving us the tools to
790.88s: walk that part and creating the space like the outlier discord back when you created. I think
796.56s: it was called the outlier dojo. That's still stuck in my head. I still think of it. I'm very
802.80s: protective of the community and also feel very passionate about it. So I mentioned this to you
808.64s: several times back and forth in the email. So I think of it as a dojo. It's it's it's good people
814.08s: trying to work out there, you know, the skill there. So yeah, I just wanted to thank you for that
819.04s: appreciate that. Yeah, no I really appreciate it. And I think the context that you share is
825.12s: absolutely hyper relevant. I can't imagine many people out there that started trading
833.84s: immediately had everything line up against their expectations and things go the way that
838.40s: they want them to. And there's one thing you said that actually really stuck out to me is that,
842.96s: you know, you can kind of get slapped down pretty hard in the market. And the first thing I popped
848.00s: in my mind is the irony because I think the worst scenario is actually when you get slapped down slow
860.72s: because the markets get they're extremely deceptive. It's not like doing something like surfing
867.84s: or even shooting, which is a hobby of mine or jujitsu or any sort of martial art. It's
874.72s: or basketball or anything, right? Like when you do these other things, you get immediate feedback.
880.56s: If I shoot the ball and I miss, there's a problem. I know I need to recalculate because the end goal
887.36s: of that ball going in didn't happen. If I'm in jujitsu and my goal is to strangle somebody and I wake
894.72s: up from a nap on the map, I made a graveyard. If it was another scenario, I would be dead. So I now
902.64s: need to understand in that exact moment what went wrong and you were so close flash to bang.
909.04s: Like you're still there with the person in the situation, you can rework what happened,
914.16s: work a defense so that you're not prioritizing getting hooks out with both your hands
920.40s: and leaving your neck exposed so that you get strangled. It's complete opposite in trading.
926.40s: Intrating, you can do everything wrong and you can make money and you can make money for
934.32s: some time and that's the concept of path, just how things happen to happen. The real
944.08s: scariest part of that is it can really trick people into thinking like, Oh, what I'm doing is working.
953.28s: I should size up my trades, it's working. Sooner or later, the performance will approximate
963.28s: to the skill. At that point, unfortunately the skill isn't there yet and that's normally when
971.28s: things go absolutely catastrophic for people, rather than just losing a few bucks.
975.60s: They make some money on some trades over a couple months and they think like, oh damn,
978.88s: like, I really got this down.
980.56s: Let me start sizing up.
982.24s: Something happens.
983.88s: And all of a sudden, they realize that, yeah, oil can go negative.
990.96s: Not something most people think about.
992.68s: But if you, in that example, were maybe a long, oil, you're like, oh yeah, I'm going
996.88s: to get super, super long, oil here at a dollar because it's not going to go negative.
1002.28s: And then all of a sudden it goes negative and you sized way up because you didn't think
1006.60s: it could go below a dollar.
1008.60s: Then all of a sudden you're like, oh shit, now I have a margin called now I'm in trouble.
1012.80s: So I think that you sharing your journey and your experiences really, really pertinent to
1020.28s: people because one of the difficult things and this is the same thing in the military.
1027.08s: Is the saying slowest moves smooth as fast?
1030.44s: When you're doing a lot of like very fine fine detailed movements, high motor movements.
1038.04s: And you try to do them really fast.
1040.52s: It inevitably is slower every single time.
1044.76s: And the reason is because when you're under stress, you lose a lot of those minor control
1051.48s: movements and you kind of default to these big gross overarching movements that make it
1057.72s: difficult.
1058.44s: What I'm specifically thinking of is something like a tack reload.
1061.80s: So you're firing your rifle, you need to change your mag.
1066.04s: If you try to do that is fast as you humanly can and that's your mindset, you're probably
1071.48s: going to miss the mag release.
1073.48s: You're probably not going to smoothly fit the new magazine in.
1077.40s: You're not going to see it all the way.
1079.36s: There's all these little things that start to follow parks.
1081.44s: We're trying to move too fast.
1083.20s: And the funny part about that is somebody can look like they're moving at the speed of
1088.24s: lights, but they will perform slower than the person who looks like they're moving in slow
1093.36s: motion.
1094.32s: But everything is super smooth.
1097.20s: So it comes together beautifully.
1099.20s: It's the same thing with trading and a lot of people unlike you are willing to paper trade
1105.52s: for any duration before.
1107.92s: I'm actually curious how that went for you.
1110.72s: When you first started paper trading, what was that experience like in terms of
1118.00s: where you wanting to paper trade was it something you were focusing yourself to?
1123.04s: And then what did you learn over your time paper trading?
1126.48s: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
1127.76s: I did want to paper trade mostly because I didn't have a lot to lose in the market and I had
1133.04s: shorter amount of time.
1134.72s: So I was working with limited capital and limited time.
1137.76s: So my idea was before I get to doing what I really want to do.
1141.28s: Let me familiarize myself with what I'm doing.
1144.56s: Get this minor errors of entering the wrong order, wrong number of large clicking by
1150.56s: instead of sell like all these different.
1152.48s: It's so complex.
1153.52s: We go through so many motions in just placing a single trade that if we don't
1159.36s: inherently build the practice of doing it, it gets
1162.48s: we can introduce these mistakes while trading at scale.
1165.60s: That's really what I wanted to take out.
1167.84s: But more importantly than that, building the trade logs, I wanted to test the trade logs.
1174.80s: I didn't know if these logs would work.
1176.72s: So paper trading was the way for me to check the formulas.
1179.84s: I literally paused the screen on your video.
1183.36s: Python match exactly the color.
1185.44s: Okay, the heading is black with white font.
1187.76s: All the input cells are good.
1189.36s: Light green.
1190.00s: All the output cells are gray and white.
1192.24s: Just a lot of things that I think.
1194.24s: I mean putting aside the shameless piracy, the amount of time it saved me in my own learning curve.
1203.20s: It's massive.
1203.84s: I think it's being, got me much comfortable, much faster in engaging with the markets.
1208.96s: Because I had, I was like having a car that I could take out to a test drive on the real roads
1214.64s: really quickly instead of worrying about building the car and still figuring out in a garage.
1220.64s: So that was most of my work.
1222.72s: My primary driver was for paper trading.
1225.20s: As far as experience goes, it was all over the place.
1228.56s: I really just trying to understand what I was doing.
1232.56s: If I was even doing it correctly and just getting in the habit of collecting logs.
1238.24s: Coming to the desk and entering the trades, just building that habit, morning, evening, whenever
1244.24s: that.
1245.36s: I think those things helped me without even thinking through those things.
1249.44s: They were helping me in the background.
1251.44s: But yeah, it was mostly just trying to get the logs functioning so I could use it in real
1255.60s: month.
1256.48s: Which is huge.
1257.44s: Right?
1257.92s: I, and it's one of the reasons in, you know this, right?
1260.88s: Everybody who's always asked me like, hey, do you have a trade log?
1263.36s: I can download.
1264.56s: And the answer is always the same.
1265.76s: It's always been the same.
1266.64s: It's no.
1267.68s: And I have like the absolute barebone skeletons of one with literally just words of the things that you're
1276.48s: going to have to put in, and then in there somewhere and figure it out.
1280.32s: But that that process of of building is really important.
1285.28s: There's no scenario where at the end of building a trade log that works that you are now
1291.68s: Warsaw then where you started.
1293.84s: That's just the reality of it.
1295.44s: You're going to understand just how these things interact better.
1299.52s: And one of the things I think a lot about actually is efficiency in the workflow.
1305.12s: I specifically set things up so that it literally mirrors my trade process and the trade process
1310.80s: is different depending on what it is.
1312.88s: So sometimes it'll be date ticker.
1315.60s: Sometimes it'll be ticker date.
1317.52s: And it is just completely built so that based on this specific thing that I'm doing,
1323.44s: it is just as efficient as humanly possible to fill everything in.
1328.24s: And that's actually the color coding that you picked up on.
1330.64s: Like I specifically make input cells always light green.
1334.32s: It's always like green always.
1336.64s: And it's so that regardless of where I'm looking at in the trade log,
1339.76s: if I see a light green cell, I immediately know that's an input.
1343.52s: I need to do something here.
1345.44s: Whereas in the beginning I didn't do anything like that.
1348.32s: And then you find yourself having to look over your own trade log for a little bit to find stuff
1352.64s: and like super inefficient.
1355.20s: One of the ways that I was able to like really pack my learning and make it super dense
1362.56s: was thinking in ways like this so that when I'm for example testing a strategy,
1368.80s: if I'm spending an hour testing a strategy,
1372.72s: 50 minutes of it is me actually testing versus having some subset of that duration where I'm just trying
1379.44s: to find shit in my log because I don't know where it is, right?
1383.28s: It's stuff like that that really does add up over time.
1387.68s: And I definitely am glad that you went through that exercise because
1393.52s: I everybody knows I am literally an evangelist for a paper trading.
1397.68s: I literally think everybody should do it.
1399.28s: I still do it today and still I paper trade.
1404.72s: And it's just data.
1406.80s: But again that goes back to people being more comfortable in embracing a process versus
1413.12s: hoping the outcome of this one individual trade is going to pay for their
1417.04s: car payment this month and that's all they're hoping for.
1420.08s: Fortunately that doesn't work super well.
1422.72s: Yeah, another thing I wanted to add about the trade log itself.
1426.16s: I'm glad that you didn't get the formulas.
1428.16s: Although I was really frustrated.
1430.16s: Some boys said, which I didn't need to give it to me.
1433.52s: But I realized now that when I moved stuff around in the log and a formula breaks in a section,
1439.84s: I'm actually able to fix it.
1441.60s: I don't have to like pin you and I, how do I fix that kind of thing, right?
1446.48s: I don't think I'm able to do that if I had just downloaded that.
1451.36s: That's something really good.
1453.28s: I now know how to navigate that.
1457.12s: Yeah, and it's it's actually funny because in the very, very beginning, I actually had like an
1462.96s: actual trade log that I gave to a few people and I became tech support and I was just like,
1469.60s: oh, hell no, like if I'm sitting here like giving something that I took a long time to like
1475.04s: build and refine, giving to you completely for free and then I'm also supposed to help you
1480.00s: troubleshoot that exact thing.
1482.24s: I was like, that's not happening.
1484.96s: So it's funny.
1486.16s: You missed the boat on that because you, you might have had a completely done trade log, but
1494.08s: there is no tech support.
1496.88s: That's funny.
1498.08s: Cool, I think we're, I would pass with through.
1499.84s: So I'll introduce the topic.
1502.16s: Yeah, I think I'll give a bit of a primer of why I came to the conclusion of bringing this as a
1508.32s: first topic.
1509.04s: And it actually ties back into what we were talking earlier is when all of us as new entrants
1516.00s: into the world of market trading investing, what have you.
1520.16s: It's immediately obvious that this is something that we've never done before.
1524.00s: It's it's a, it's a pursuit unlike any other in school.
1528.08s: We have teachers giving us lessons homework.
1531.20s: When we go home home, do the homework, we get great at all that.
1535.12s: We get extra lessons if we need to catch up or extra courses or whatever.
1539.28s: Same thing happens at the job.
1540.80s: We have our manager or whoever gives us a set of instructions.
1545.20s: We take that instructions apply the training that we have received for that job,
1549.92s: output it that either goes to the next person downstream or an x-process downstream.
1555.92s: These both conditions have defined boundaries, a set of roads.
1561.36s: There's a structure, societal structure to all of these things.
1565.04s: Trading is nothing like that.
1566.56s: It's overcome.
1567.84s: It's overwhelming when we come, when we come up on it is no rules unbound, unboundness of it.
1573.52s: So I personally felt really lost when I came up on it.
1577.68s: So as usual, what most of us do when they get overwhelmed,
1581.68s: we try to imitate the person who's doing the best in that, at least what we perceive as the best.
1586.56s: So the day one will be okay, this trade and made x-amounted when using y-strategy.
1592.00s: I'm going to learn that.
1593.84s: One week from later, another trader does y-z amount of money with a strategy.
1599.20s: Now I'm going to learn that.
1600.64s: So just jumping between strategies and watching different people do different things and just trying to
1606.16s: emulate them.
1607.84s: I never considered this is where my time should go, because I didn't know.
1612.80s: I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know what we don't know.
1617.52s: That's that's why we have no idea of regime change.
1621.12s: We don't, we have no idea of part if the person that's posting it as any idea of what they're talking
1626.56s: about, we don't know any of those things.
1628.00s: So I wanted to bring this topic, they bring it back to the concept of optimizing market beta
1635.52s: and then the idea of main effort.
1639.04s: So if you could walk us through what those mean individually and perhaps
1644.56s: why they're important and how we can marry them together, particularly for beginner traders
1650.48s: as they're starting their journey, why, why it is important for them to focus most of the time on
1656.64s: doing this, why it could be important, right?
1658.72s: So take it away from there.
1660.24s: Yeah, for sure.
1661.92s: But funny thing before that that you mentioned that really sticks out was the idea of like
1667.28s: emulation and something traders will come across is that trading, it really requires a
1679.84s: different way of thinking and a lot of people apply their standard day-to-day thinking
1689.20s: to trading, which doesn't work well.
1691.84s: This is things, this includes things like bargain buying.
1696.40s: I use that example all the time, right?
1698.16s: You try to buy stuff cheaper if you need socks.
1701.04s: There's no reason to pay for socks.
1703.36s: But if you do that, well, I was literally just talking with somebody from the discord
1708.80s: this week that was like, how do you not be greedy on fills
1712.24s: because they're putting an order at the mid and then they're not wanting to move it much
1719.04s: and then they just miss the trade entirely, right?
1721.76s: And it's like there's a balance.
1723.44s: If you overemphasize the wrong thing, you're optimizing for the wrong thing.
1727.84s: But again, your brain isn't taught how to think more effectively in a trading environment
1733.68s: versus your day-to-day.
1735.60s: So specifically with the idea of emulation, emulation, again,
1740.88s: in trading is also very, very difficult.
1744.80s: I think it's easy to find things to emulate from people that are like good aspects.
1752.08s: I definitely think you could do that.
1754.16s: But trading is also really dangerous because people will try to emulate what they think a
1762.16s: institutional trader does.
1764.24s: And the funny thing is, what an institutional trader is literally an entirely different game.
1769.60s: You are emulating something that quite literally is not relevant.
1773.92s: There are elements of what an institutional trader does that are relevant,
1778.80s: things like having a risk management plan and actually testing things before you move
1783.76s: them to production and so on and so forth.
1786.32s: So there's elements.
1788.00s: But it's not the same.
1790.80s: It's kind of like you were me trying to emulate LeBron James.
1794.96s: Like, sure, we can emulate some of the moves he does.
1798.32s: But I'm not as tall as he is, I don't think you are either, right?
1801.68s: Like, there's just specific attributes that are just completely different.
1804.56s: And that is what it is.
1806.88s: So just on that point of emulation is a general thought.
1810.32s: I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
1812.64s: But I think you have to be super careful, super super careful because there's a really good
1817.36s: chance that you're going to emulate things that actually can hurt you more than help you.
1823.36s: Now, taking that to this idea of optimizing market beta and main effort strategies.
1832.16s: The concept of optimizing market beta is if a trader was to start investing in that sit.
1844.96s: What's the starting point?
1846.24s: Typically, it's buying and holding in XETF like Spy VIO.
1853.04s: Hopefully saving aggressively adding more to it each month.
1856.96s: So dollar cost averaging and come back 30 years later.
1861.92s: That's what most people do by default.
1865.52s: I think a big mistake that new traders make is going back to basketball if I never touch the ball before.
1877.52s: And my near term goal was to compete with LeBron James.
1884.00s: It's not going to work.
1886.40s: Like there's no competition if I've never touched a ball before.
1889.84s: And my goal for my first time playing basketball is to compete with LeBron James.
1894.40s: That sounds fucking crazy.
1896.96s: But the funny thing is is traders do it all the time.
1900.56s: Traders think that they're going to start trading and compete in outperform.
1906.48s: Everybody, which some level of delusion, I actually don't think it's bad.
1911.68s: You got to aim high.
1912.88s: I don't hate that.
1914.48s: But I do think that you have to have some parameters around it and have a healthy expectation of what's about to happen.
1921.68s: So my my position on that is a really, really, really, really good starting point for traders
1929.28s: is to do what you would do otherwise and see if you can make it a little bit better.
1936.32s: Just a little bit better.
1938.16s: One of the examples of this is actually on my website.
1943.84s: I'll share my screen so that I can show you because you can massively outperform the market
1953.28s: without really doing anything special.
1956.96s: And I think that that part escapes a lot of people because they immediately want to go into and start seeing
1963.20s: you know, how much money they can make super fast.
1966.64s: So this I think is a good example.
1970.40s: What this is is a just example of three different portfolios.
1976.08s: I have them labeled one two three.
1978.16s: And if we take a look at portfolio three, it has a 8.6% average return quite high.
1985.28s: And if we compare that against portfolio one, which only has a 7.4% average return,
1990.56s: we would objectively say portfolio three has a better average return than portfolio
1996.48s: one yet at the end of a five year period, it made less money than something that has a lower average return.
2006.32s: This confuses a lot of people and it's something that they don't appreciate.
2012.00s: To further the point, if we take a look at portfolio one, the best return that it had in any of the years
2021.04s: was 10%. That's the best. The worst positive performance in portfolio three is positive 12%.
2033.68s: So the worst positive performance is better than the best performance in portfolio one.
2039.76s: Only difference between portfolio one and portfolio three is portfolio three had a drawdown of 25%
2046.88s: one year. It came out of the gate 30% return three times that of the other portfolio.
2056.08s: What's going on here? This, this drawdown completely screwed portfolio three.
2065.12s: They're now underperforming fairly to something that really didn't do anything that's special.
2076.00s: Three, three, 10% years of five and a two. The way that this applies to something like
2083.12s: optimizing market beta is this. If we take a look at S&P and we look at S&P over a long time frame five years.
2099.28s: If we think about the way that S&P performs long term, it does well, it goes up.
2106.40s: If you do something as simple as a basic momentum following approach where if a weekly
2116.08s: candle drops below some sort of set moving average, so it's a really slow thing.
2123.60s: What you do is you cut off these big dips that you don't have to get some sort of positive
2130.32s: return through or you can flag in this period where you want to dollar cost average and more aggressively.
2134.80s: However, you want to set it up. The point, though, is that by taking something as simple as what you would do anyways.
2143.20s: Dollar cost average into an index ETF and you find really, really small ways to just make that a little bit better.
2153.28s: That is a perfect starting point. And for those that don't know, my position is that,
2160.72s: like, your first two years of trading, your goals should just be more than zero dollars.
2166.48s: Just try to be positive. That is more than enough of a goal for your first two years of trading.
2171.36s: It's not pacing the market. It's not beating the market. It's just try to not lose your money
2176.64s: and get some experience. Then you can start looking at stuff like this, which is
2182.96s: very realistic. This is way more realistic for people than the ability to
2189.20s: intra-day trade, supply and demand imbalances in a super large index that has so much going on
2198.16s: that they don't know and they're just hoping that they can interface with it. That's not to say
2203.04s: it can be done. It can and I know people that do it, but it is super, super difficult. Very hard.
2210.48s: This is way easier. So to summarize all of that, the idea of optimizing market beta is to aim
2221.60s: low enough so that you actually have a chance of being successful. And then you can kind of
2227.28s: poorly those wins in that success to then get better and better hopefully. Now, the idea behind
2234.40s: a main effort strategy in the military we use main effort and supporting effort. Main effort is
2241.68s: what we refer to as your bid for success. It's kind of like the thing that you think you're going
2245.68s: to do to get the job done and then you have supporting efforts that help the main effort do its job.
2252.88s: In trading now, I think as you pointed out earlier, traders struggle way more with too much
2261.84s: information overload. So the point of a main effort strategy that might be based on something like
2268.96s: optimizing market beta is to give focus. It's to give a good objective that ultimately
2279.28s: shouldn't hurt you even if you fuck it up because you're essentially doing what you would do
2285.92s: anyways. Dollar cost average into an index ETF and try to find ways to make it better.
2292.56s: You can underperform, right? Like you could only sell cash to your puts and never participate in
2298.56s: the upside. You absolutely can underperform. But the probability of you blowing up your accounts
2304.64s: trading a cover triangle in an index ETF would effectively require whatever index you're trading
2312.40s: to blow up. So if you're trading something like S&P, it would require the S&P 500 to blow up.
2320.48s: Not super high probability. But this calls back to what you were talking about before and the
2328.08s: concept I shared in terms of slowest moves smooth as fast. Most people, they hear a good target for
2334.96s: your first two years is to be greater than zero and they think, oh no, I don't have time for that.
2339.60s: And then they think like, oh, well, if I'm only going to try to like slightly outperform the market,
2344.88s: why even bother not realizing that if you ever so slightly outperform the market for a sufficient
2351.68s: duration, you absolutely smash it. But again, people are aiming higher than they can even see.
2359.92s: So the the purpose for that is to try and help people find structure so that that urge to move around
2367.52s: to bounce around goes away. The main reason why traders bounce around is when they're not confident
2373.44s: in what they're doing and if what they're doing works. One of the cool things is when you know
2380.32s: what you're doing works, that itch to bounce around effectively goes away because you know what you're
2389.20s: doing is working. So sure, you might test that new idea you came across with a small amount of
2394.08s: money and see if there's something there sure. It's really cool. But you're not like completely
2398.64s: pivoting your portfolio every time you come across something. So to summarize everything,
2405.92s: optimizing market beta, I think is a great starting point for people because it takes the base
2411.52s: case for what most people would do anyways and it tries to make it a little bit better.
2416.40s: Main effort strategy is designed to give somebody focus so that we're not bouncing around
2423.68s: incessantly in making essentially no progress. You have to you have to give things a fair shake
2429.92s: in order to see if there's something behind it and you have to go through path. So yeah,
2434.96s: that's kind of like my Cliff notes version for both of those but happy to dive into any specifics.
2441.28s: No, that was great. I think I think you answered all the fit and you made a really interesting
2445.12s: point about the itch going away once you have that baseline level of understanding of what
2450.40s: it's for you. That is so true. It's similar to another thing you talk about, like having a good
2457.28s: defense allows you to take opportunistic shot at offense. That's how I think about the main effort
2463.92s: covered triangle as a whole in the strategy. It's like all weather tires for me. It can, it can
2470.24s: bits time many different market regimes and conditions if you have a good plan around it. But it
2475.68s: releases your time to focus on other speculative section because now you know you have the system
2481.36s: that works in the background. So that that each about jumping around is really, really good.
2489.36s: The funny thing about specifically something like the covered triangle too is like,
2494.48s: you know, I have this sample portfolio that I've been sharing with everybody and like you can
2500.64s: apply leverage to it, right? So I'm training a coverage string right now in teachable cues.
2506.40s: With that, I not only absolutely smash the same noxional value performance in QQQ, but I do it with
2517.60s: lower risk. That is really unintuitive to people because you think three times levered more risk.
2524.00s: But again, notice how I emphasize the same noxional value because if I set it up where I'm
2530.32s: trading half a million dollars. And in QQQ, if I wanted to trade half a million dollars of QQQ,
2537.28s: I got to use half a million dollars. But in something that's three times leveraged,
2542.64s: I no longer have to use half a million dollars. I can literally use a third of it.
2547.76s: And I can have the same noxional exposure, lower dollar exposure out at a given point in time,
2553.20s: which then allows better dollar cost average and scaling in. Now, not all that glitters is gold.
2558.56s: There's a lot of nuance when you're trading a leveraged ETF, especially something like
2562.08s: T-TripleQs. There's volatility decay, which isn't like the demon that people think it is,
2568.00s: but it is a thing and you have to be aware of it. But it's just an example of how something as simple
2576.48s: and something as really low touch as a coverage string goal is can significantly drive performance,
2587.44s: which it's funny because sometimes when I'm talking with people,
2592.64s: they'll kind of be a little bit down about like what their return is and stuff like that. And then
2598.24s: if they're trading a coverage string goal will look at that and it's almost always outperforming
2602.56s: the benchmark. So the real sadness is then that there's not more money in that. Because,
2610.80s: we're trying all these other things that aren't working as well. They're like, damn,
2613.68s: you know, my overall portfolio is in outperforming the market. But then when you look at the
2617.92s: allocation for the cover triangle, it's typically beating the market, which is super ironic,
2623.52s: because then it almost gets taken for granted something that even if that is highly specialized
2629.60s: in like everything that a trader does, that itself is worthwhile. And absolutely can make a
2637.76s: significant performance improvement long term. Now you do have to be cautious of drag. Right?
2644.64s: Like if you're doing it in a regular taxable account, you do have to be thoughtful about how much
2649.44s: you're trading and at what size and frequency. Because now you have the additional overhead of
2655.36s: taxes. So not only do you have to outperform a benchmark, but then you have to logically be able to say,
2661.20s: I outperform the benchmark after this drag is added. If it's not the case, then again, it doesn't
2669.44s: necessarily make as much sense. If your goal is to outperform the benchmark, which isn't always the case.
2674.80s: For some people, it's to have a higher performance than the benchmark over like a five-year period
2681.44s: as compared to any one individual year, which I actually think is a much better goal.
2685.60s: Great. I think that covers it. To that point, I came across an interesting paper with a
2692.16s: microguide. I think it was called leverage for the long run. Yeah. Yeah. That talks about exactly what
2698.40s: you said like managing around moving garbage. So yeah, if anyone's interested, I did have a
2704.56s: question from both of all street. Or by the way, shout out to the MN productive, like that and
2711.20s: Ricky for forming a group, a trading group. And I was telling them the other day that when we started
2716.80s: our group, it continues to pay dividends. I think of my group mates as friends really.
2723.04s: My intellectual partners, I found ideas of them. I look forward to meeting them every Saturday.
2728.72s: It's so much fun. So I think I really congratulations for those guys and those labs.
2734.56s: But they had a question here. They're working on understanding how to scope in
2740.48s: different information and in alignment to profit mechanism. I think you addressed this slightly
2746.96s: yesterday in the post pro stream. If you had any extra thoughts or additional thoughts for this one,
2752.72s: you can go into that. But there's a second part to that question was, would you consider
2758.00s: me stop trading a profit mechanism? If so, what are some signals that you would be watching for
2764.80s: that? That area. Yeah, I'll do the second one first because it's pretty easy. I do think you could
2772.32s: consider like meme stocks, a profit mechanism. But I do think you'd have to get a little more
2779.28s: specific because again, the way that I think about meme stocks is probably different than
2783.76s: what a lot of those people in for them as. Like you can have meme stocks that are literally just
2788.16s: popular, have a bunch of memes about them and don't do anything. But I think the real thing that
2795.84s: I would look to trade in stuff like meme stocks is like short squeezes of different kinds. So
2801.92s: stuff that's relevant to that is like short interest, short interest ratios, short interest is a
2807.60s: percentage of float days to cover all of those matter. Then things like volume and volatility. All of
2816.32s: those become highly relevant along with like option trading activity for sure. Giving game stop a shout out
2826.16s: and my deep dive into game stop over the last what year or so, I don't even know how long it's been
2832.80s: now. But the way that I came across game stop like I've always been familiar with the stock.
2840.96s: But I ended up catching part of roaring kiddies' trades as he was placing them. And it came out
2848.56s: on a scanner that I had had no idea it was him, obviously. But I just saw this highly anomalous volume
2855.36s: coming in. So then I ended up trading it again just in expecting some sort of sympathetic move
2862.00s: of an informed trader and turns out was him and then opened up a whole other door. But that's
2872.32s: a really good example of a meme stock that absolutely has a lot of volatility and movement. So
2881.76s: I even trade a covered triangle now in game stop. Part of that is just to support the community.
2887.60s: But it's also because of the way that that profit mechanism behaves and I have uncapped profit
2894.08s: potential, meaning my upside is not covered. And I design. It's because those things can blow off
2902.16s: really, really fast. So I actually have controls for that specific strategy where if certain criteria
2907.92s: or I actually just flatten any sort of short calls that exist at the time, I lighten the cash
2914.80s: secured puts and I just accumulate more shares out right. Sometimes I'll add like kicker calls
2919.44s: and stuff but I always fear for liquidity when trying to trade those during a squeeze. So I think
2924.24s: you're better off with the underlying and something like that specifically. So yeah, I definitely
2929.28s: think that there's a profit mechanism there. I think you just have to be a little more specific though
2934.16s: with like what is the actual piece that you're trying to target. Then zooming out a little bit more
2942.00s: and thinking about like trying to figure out the metrics that are relevant for a profit mechanism.
2951.28s: The way that I think about this is if I have anything that I trade. So do you have an example
2961.04s: of a strategy or anything that we can use for an example? I just wanted to be random. I want to
2968.24s: pick something that I'm not familiar with. Just a triangle, be out of peace triangle 30 days, 60 days.
2975.12s: Yeah, got it. So somebody saw tasty trade and they see that selling strangles or straddles
2982.96s: out, you know, 45 days, whatever, tends to make money and that's where they want to start.
2988.40s: Completely cool. You're starting with something that is supported at least by some level of data
2994.48s: and it gives you a starting point. So then the follow-in way that I would think about that is
3001.04s: I would absolutely start a section in my trade plan about that and I always start with an executive
3008.32s: summary which is just a word picture, a couple sentences of like what I think this thing is supposed
3013.04s: to do. Then I have a section for like set up management AR and in there I'm going to just
3021.36s: qualitatively describe what the profit mechanism is. So in the case of the example that we're using
3027.36s: here, it's variance risk premiums in indices, which is the propensity for implied volatility
3032.96s: to trend over realized and also that gets juiced up double time in indices because they tend to
3039.92s: have put skill. Right. So the next part is if I think about those details in those traits,
3049.60s: the next question I have is what information would let me make more money with this? What do I think
3059.84s: would let me make more money with this? That becomes your list of metrics that you think are relevant.
3068.00s: A great example of this is I was working with somebody that was trading zero DTE's. I trades
3073.60s: zero DTE's community knows and they were tracking VIX when they were trading their zero DTE's.
3082.80s: It's a logical starting point because they're trading zero DTE's and SPX so they wanted to track
3087.76s: volatility. However, if we think about that metric does that metric VIX match what they're trading
3098.08s: with respect to a profit mechanism zero DTE's? Of course not. Because VIX is 30 day forward
3106.40s: of all zero DTE is zero DTE. It's a completely different fall window. So then in that conversation
3112.72s: they were like, oh, what about one day VIX? Even still much better, but still different.
3120.96s: That's still a different thing than what you're trying to trade. So the way that that works though
3127.84s: is that person started what they thought was logical. Then what you do is if you don't have
3134.96s: somebody or some sort of resource that says like what I just walked through right like, well, this
3140.80s: doesn't work for that reason, you could figure it out on your own. How do you figure out on your own?
3145.12s: You track what you think is best in this case VIX. And then at the end of the month, you just run
3151.12s: an analysis. And you say how informative is the VIX measurement on the P&L or some other metric
3159.12s: relative to my strategy? And the funny thing is is you will find that it's effectively not correlated
3165.20s: slightly positive correlation, but effectively no. That's exactly how you narrow down the features
3172.96s: and the metrics that ultimately matter to a profit mechanism. The gain there is you're going to
3179.60s: track a lot of shit that doesn't matter. And everybody will view that as like wasted effort,
3184.48s: but it's not because even if you track something that gives you a null, now you know, this isn't
3192.48s: relevant to this. That is still a data point. So that that process though of brainstorming what we
3201.04s: think is relevant, outlining briefly why we think it's relevant, finding a way to track it in a trade
3208.96s: and then setting a cadence to evaluate it and see how much does it actually add? That's exactly
3215.92s: how you dial in what's relevant to stuff. And you can always begin with accelerators. So if I
3223.20s: wanted to trade variance resprimiums in indices, I'm going to go to SSRN. And I'm going to ask
3230.08s: the RP. I'm going to ask index resprimiums. And I'm going to see what existing research is there.
3236.80s: And I'm going to see what features have they already identified matter because a lot of that work
3243.20s: has been done to give you a starting point. So you don't have to like just make it all up on your own,
3248.32s: especially if you don't know, you should use references like SSRN. There's new ones with it.
3254.72s: I wouldn't take it all at complete face value. But again, if you have no starting point, it's a good one.
3260.48s: So that's the exact process that I would use to kind of narrow down the scope in terms of what
3265.52s: metrics are relevant to the specific profit mechanism that I'm trading and then to validate
3272.80s: those metrics to make sure that they're actually doing something for me. I can't tell you how many times
3277.60s: I've tracked something that ends up coming out of the log because after a decent sample size,
3283.84s: I note that it's not really helping me make more money. It's not helping me predict things.
3289.84s: It's not helping me reduce volatility. So I don't just delete it. I have a section in my trade
3296.64s: log that literally just has expired signals or metrics that I'm tracking different data points.
3304.64s: So then if for whatever reason five years down the line that idea comes back in my head,
3308.96s: I can maybe revalidate. I can see what I did before. Maybe there's a way for me to make it better.
3313.52s: Or I can see what it did before and be like, oh yeah, that's a bad idea. I remember now. That kind of thing.
3318.40s: So yeah, that's it. It's like anything else. It's just process oriented. The more that you can build
3324.80s: things that you can repeat them multiple times, the better off you're going to be in trading because
3329.36s: you have to do a lot of that a lot of times. Great. Great. Thank you. I think that wraps me up.
3336.88s: Thank you for having me on. It was great. Yeah. Great. I did it too. Absolutely beautiful.
3341.20s: Super, super fun to catch up. And for those that are interested, essentially we're going to
3347.68s: plan to do these like once a month. And if you're in the discord, it's free for everybody to join.
3354.00s: If you have like a topic or something that you want to see as discuss and go into more detail,
3360.96s: let's trade you know you can tag him in there and then he can keep a pulse on it for you guys. And
3367.04s: then we can hit it during one of these. So thanks for hanging out. Shraaj, I hope this is useful
3372.32s: to everybody. Let us know if it was. Be an outlier. We'll see you guys later.
