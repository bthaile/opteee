0.42s: option box spreads I'm going to walk you
2.46s: through what they are how I use them why
5.28s: they might be useful for your toolkit
7.92s: because for me specifically these are
10.56s: actually an important part of what I do
12.66s: and namely because a lot of the
14.94s: strategies that I use like the coverage
16.50s: triangle the diagonal the unlocked
18.90s: leverage and one of the ways you can
20.70s: capitalize on The Leverage is putting
22.50s: the money to use that is otherwise
24.98s: scheduled for those other strategies as
27.60s: I listed them so I'm going to walk you
29.10s: through the strategy first and then give
31.02s: you a couple examples on how I like to
32.94s: use them and then finally the management
34.68s: of the strategy so what's up everybody
36.72s: Eric here welcome back to all the hours
38.22s: let's get right to it so the very first
40.32s: thing what is an option box spread well
43.74s: realistically the reason why we use this
47.16s: is It's a way to Arbitrage the risk-free
50.04s: rate from the market and if you don't
52.98s: know what Arbitrage means it's
54.66s: essentially a way for us to guarantee a
56.64s: profit with no risk and there are
58.92s: instances that you can do it but no
60.36s: notice how I say via the risk-free rate
62.52s: the reason why that part is important is
64.86s: because there's not this magical trade
66.84s: that you're finding that just gives you
68.34s: free money this is just a essential way
71.58s: to either loan money to the market or
73.80s: get money from the market yep alone so
76.92s: we'll talk about that in a little bit it
78.96s: is a high collateral and low reward
81.42s: style trade it's exactly what you would
83.34s: expect for any other risk free trade if
86.82s: you look at what you can get in bonds
88.80s: it's essentially the same thing so I
92.40s: typically use these like I said when I
95.04s: have money set aside for something like
96.96s: a coverage strangle and that kind of
99.42s: thing essentially requires a bunch of
101.82s: money for me to be able to buy shares at
104.88s: some point in time it's super
106.86s: inefficient to have that money just
109.26s: sitting there not doing anything at all
111.84s: when you are still being exposed to
114.72s: inflation whether it's high like it is
116.88s: right now relatively speaking or low and
119.46s: there's an opportunity for that money so
121.86s: this is a way for me to put that money
123.72s: to use while I'm still kind of using it
125.94s: for other things and I'll talk about the
127.56s: timing in that in just a second this is
129.90s: overall a delta neutral trade meaning we
132.42s: don't care which way the market goes
133.98s: whatsoever and the Hallmark of this
138.72s: is we need to make sure that the trade
140.70s: is put on where the expiration value is
142.92s: greater than the premium rate uh the
144.84s: premium paid so what is the structure of
148.86s: the strategy well really it's just a
152.52s: debit put spread plus a debit call
154.44s: spread and I'll walk you through what
155.94s: that looks like in just a second but
157.92s: there are a couple important notes up
160.08s: front the very first thing you have to
162.96s: use European options let me reinforce
166.14s: that point you have to use European
168.84s: options if you do not use European
171.00s: options the risk of early assignment
174.00s: exists and there's a dude
176.58s: on Reddit that lost a whole bunch of
178.50s: money lost like fifty thousand dollars
180.30s: to a box spread in uvxy because he
182.94s: thought he was smart and his thesis was
185.52s: decent the product was completely wrong
187.50s: you need to not be at risk of early
190.26s: assignment so don't use American options
193.26s: use European options and really the
195.12s: product I use the most for this is the
196.80s: SPX keeps it simple
198.72s: and that also answers the second Point
200.82s: here which is liquidity you gotta have
203.04s: liquidity in this trade one of the
204.96s: things that eats this trade alive more
207.72s: than anything are fees if you have high
210.72s: commission costs large bid ask spreads
213.48s: this is a very difficult strategy to use
216.72s: with any amount of efficacy so as you
219.60s: can tell here we're talking about the
220.98s: concept of Arbitrage
222.90s: anytime there's a potential risk-free
225.48s: return you would better believe
227.04s: everybody and their mother is interested
229.98s: in it so that means that the margins are
232.98s: very low if you have high cost that's a
236.94s: problem you're going to eat away at any
239.04s: of the potential rewards you have
240.42s: available to you
241.68s: so we need to be mindful of costs and
244.68s: then the last thing timing is variable
246.18s: you can do that's one of my favorite
247.74s: things about these kinds of Trades is
249.42s: you can deploy them in all different
250.86s: kinds of time frames
253.20s: so for example if we look at the SPX
255.36s: here you can see all these different
256.68s: expirations and right now I have a box
258.42s: spread out in 17 March this started as
261.36s: an 18 days to expiration trade which I'm
263.10s: going to walk through this whole trade
264.24s: in its entirety for the example but you
266.46s: can essentially establish box spreads
268.20s: wherever you want but you got to make
270.48s: sure that it's liquid so a lot of times
272.22s: you're going to find the best liquidity
273.66s: in the monthly expirations that's just a
276.12s: function of where most people put their
277.80s: money but you can essentially pick any
280.14s: time frame that you want and that's
281.34s: actually one of the most important parts
282.60s: of the way that I deploy the strategy is
284.76s: because it's typically slaved to a
287.58s: broader strategy that I'm using and I
291.00s: need to be more careful about the timing
293.16s: of this because I need the capital to be
294.84s: available for the other trade now one
296.94s: last note is if you are long the Box
298.98s: spread or along the Box you are loaning
301.68s: money means you're paying money but
303.42s: going to get more back at expiration and
305.70s: then if you're short the Box part it
307.26s: means you're borrowing money you're
308.40s: going to get money up front but then
309.48s: you're gonna have to pay back the
310.74s: principal and then the interest at the
312.96s: end of the trait come expiration all
316.08s: right so what does this look like well
317.64s: this is the like I just said this is the
319.62s: trade I just showed you and this is a
322.68s: long call spread and a long
324.96s: um put spread it's got to be the same
327.12s: expiration and the same strikes so if
328.98s: you look at the example trade down here
330.98s: I am
333.18s: I am long the 4 000 calls I am short the
338.64s: 5 000 calls i in them short the four
343.50s: thousand puts and then I am long the
346.62s: five thousand puts
348.24s: so essentially the way that this trade
350.52s: works is you're going to pay a debit out
353.28s: and then you are going to get more back
355.74s: so what does this look like when I first
357.24s: put this trade on it was 18 days to
359.70s: expiration so a little less than three
361.32s: weeks it was a thousand points wide
363.66s: right so four thousand of five thousand
365.40s: thousand points wide so that means that
367.74s: each contract represents one hundred
370.74s: thousand dollars why do I use 100 why
373.44s: did I use 1000 points wide it's so that
375.78s: I don't have to trade as many of them
377.70s: you don't have to trade them this wide
379.92s: you could trade them ten points wide
381.72s: Five Points wide whatever you want but
383.82s: if you want to put on a sizable position
385.58s: it's a little more efficient to go a
387.96s: little bit wider so in this case each
389.70s: each contract here represents one
391.62s: hundred thousand dollars in total so in
393.78s: this case the total loan out is worth
396.84s: one million dollars but the loan amount
400.32s: what did I actually give to the market
403.40s: is 997
406.28s: 725 dollars so what's the difference
409.74s: here well I just told you that the loan
411.66s: value is one million dollars the way you
413.88s: get to this loan value is you take the
415.62s: width of the strike you multiply it by
417.96s: the number of contracts that you've sold
419.94s: and that essentially gets you out to
422.88s: your loan value so we have a thousand
424.98s: points you gotta multiply it by 100 like
428.10s: you typically would for your options
430.32s: because there are 100 Lots so that gets
432.72s: you to your 100 000 and then it's a 10
434.94s: lot so you add one more zero that's the
436.86s: total loan value
438.24s: and the loan amount is the debit that
441.84s: you pay so in this case it came out to
444.24s: that and it represents a 4.6 annualized
448.56s: return on invested Capital which is a
450.12s: little less after fees than the
452.82s: risk-free rate as it is but that's the
455.88s: nature of the trade and I'll walk you
457.44s: through why I set them up this way but
459.48s: in on this trade I'm essentially sending
461.34s: out 997 thousand dollars and I'm going
463.20s: to get back 22.75. so this is not a bad
466.52s: gross dollar amount but obviously it's
469.74s: just not a good return on invested
472.14s: Capital if you think about the actual
474.30s: return on this it's less than half a
476.40s: percent but again it's all designed to
480.36s: work in tandem with other strategies so
482.64s: what I mean by that is right now I still
485.28s: have money put to work for things like
486.96s: the covered strangle and this money
489.42s: would be sitting there otherwise doing
492.12s: nothing meanwhile the coverage strangle
494.76s: is still completely secured now there's
497.04s: a couple risks when you do this this the
499.20s: first thing is there's always the risk
501.42s: when you're running something like the
502.38s: coverage triangle of early assignment
503.82s: and if the money is not there that's a
506.88s: problem so one of the things I tell
508.56s: people is like let's say for example I
510.42s: have a really deep in the money short
512.70s: put I'm not going to put the capital for
515.34s: that trade into a box spread because the
517.44s: propensity for early assignment is still
519.90s: relatively High especially if there's
522.00s: not a lot of time value left in those
523.44s: options so that's one scenario that I
525.54s: would not deploy a box spread the second
527.64s: scenario that you have to consider is
529.14s: the timing of your trades so for example
532.58s: in this box spread I have 11 days left
535.44s: to go that means that the cash is going
538.02s: to come available in 11 days I don't
539.88s: want to buy this back early because
541.74s: that's more fees and that's another
543.66s: spread that you have to cross all eats
546.42s: into the profitability I want to take
548.04s: this trade to expiration
549.78s: and let it expire it's a cash settled
552.18s: product so even if one of these is in
554.40s: the money and one of them is not in the
555.72s: money or whatever it doesn't matter
556.92s: that's another reason why I trade the
559.14s: SPX is because it's cash settled it
560.94s: doesn't matter if it winds up in between
562.50s: the legs it's going to be a full profit
564.42s: if I let it expire
566.04s: but let's say for example I had a trade
568.56s: in iwm that's going to require X number
571.38s: of dollars and that actually expires on
574.86s: the 9th of March well now I've just
577.44s: created a timing issue because the cash
580.20s: for the coverage strangle which expires
582.84s: nine March is tied up until 17 March so
587.22s: let's say that part of my overall trade
589.80s: thesis for the coverage strangles to
591.72s: take assignment and let's say that those
593.04s: short puts are deep in the money and I
595.80s: still have all that cash available but
597.48s: it's tied up in this box spread that's
598.92s: not going to come out for another two
600.90s: days past this expiration I've just
602.82s: created a problem for myself it's not
604.44s: insurmountable there's ways to go about
606.00s: it you could take assignment on margin
608.40s: and then pay the margin fee until your
610.50s: box spread comes available because
611.64s: here's the thing with the Box spread
613.02s: when you put the trade on there are some
616.02s: important metrics for an account I
617.70s: haven't blocked out because it's privacy
619.08s: but if you think about the net Lincoln
621.00s: day trades that's how much your account
622.56s: is worth if you flatten everything the
625.08s: cash and sweep is how much actual cash
628.14s: is available in your account so the
630.54s: margin requirement for this trade as you
632.88s: can see is only eighteen thousand
634.62s: dollars it doesn't require a lot of
636.66s: money but it takes a lot of cash so what
640.32s: that means is I still have plenty of
642.84s: capital available to trade options to
645.54s: trade on margin because it actually is a
647.76s: very low margin requirement but what
650.22s: what ends up happening is I use all of
652.44s: the cash that's available if you put on
654.18s: too many box spreads and then you
657.06s: essentially if you get assigned early
658.56s: you have the room in your account based
661.08s: on margin but you don't have the room in
663.78s: the account based on the cash so all
666.00s: that means is that you would be trading
667.26s: on margin for a little bit until the
668.76s: cash from this trade comes available if
670.38s: you timed it inappropriately or you
672.84s: could always take the trade down early
674.40s: so right now I could take this trade
675.72s: down for a 600 profit I don't because it
678.78s: still has time left in the trade now I
680.94s: want to talk to you about one other risk
682.38s: in this trade and that is the risk-free
685.20s: rate so as the risk-free rate changes
687.72s: when you put the trade on obviously
689.58s: you're establishing your value but let's
691.74s: say rates increased while I was in this
693.60s: trade well then now I'm kind of not in
696.00s: an ideal scenario because there's a
697.26s: better rate available and I'm locked
698.52s: into this rate so it's one of the
700.02s: reasons why I prefer shorter term time
701.70s: frames especially in a dynamic interest
703.32s: rate environment so box spreads are a
706.62s: fantastic way to utilize leverage and
709.92s: the rest of the cash in the portfolio
711.78s: why it's being used for other things you
713.82s: just have to be pragmatic and smart
715.44s: about the way you do it but this has
717.90s: been one of the Hallmarks of what I tend
719.88s: to do especially coupled with the
721.50s: covered strangle strategy because the
723.60s: coverage triangle is very Capital
724.62s: intensive so this is a way to earn
726.60s: something while the coverage strangle is
729.06s: still working and still has all the cash
730.44s: available to it so while rates start to
733.44s: increase or they maintain a level that
735.42s: at least makes sense to run this
736.62s: strategy I tend to run it now when we
739.44s: were in essentially a near zero interest
741.12s: rate environment I didn't bother with it
743.16s: because after fees there wasn't much to
746.10s: walk out with but that's not always the
748.38s: case especially as we get rates back to
750.36s: a normal place so if you have any
751.92s: questions on the box spread obviously
753.36s: this is all predicated on being long the
755.46s: Box spread loaning the money I don't use
757.20s: this to take money although you could
758.70s: very reasonably and you can get it at a
760.86s: good rate from the market like this so
762.84s: if you have any questions on the box
763.92s: right hit me up let me know happy to hit
765.60s: them up and if you made it to the end
766.68s: like subscribe and be an outlet see you
768.84s: all later
