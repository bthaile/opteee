0.00s: you're gonna trade them I'm gonna trade
1.62s: them so let's talk about how we trade
3.48s: them what exactly zero DTE options I'm
6.30s: gonna walk you through a guide on some
8.04s: of the things that I think should keep
9.18s: in mind pros and cons first second I
11.40s: want to walk you through the downfall of
13.86s: retail Traders integration of them into
16.20s: their strategies via data from a handful
18.78s: of studies that I really like that I
20.94s: also juxtapose against my own data set
23.34s: but nobody should trust my data set I
25.74s: think it's better to use the stuff that
27.06s: you can find that's peer reviewed so
28.62s: we're going to go through that but I'll
30.12s: integrate some of the things that I
31.32s: found personally along the way and then
32.88s: at the end of the video I want to walk
33.90s: you through exactly how I integrate zero
36.66s: DTE expirations into my trading style
38.88s: and how I like to trade them so without
40.26s: further Ado what's up everybody Eric
41.82s: here welcome back to all the outliers a
43.92s: huge shout out to the patreon family and
46.08s: the YouTube members you guys make this
48.00s: all possible this takes a lot of time to
49.86s: put together to give you good
51.06s: information so let's get straight into
52.92s: this video the very first thing that I
55.20s: want to talk about some pros and cons
56.34s: and what you're going to notice from
57.78s: this list is it's not labeled as a pro
59.52s: or on and it's because it really depends
61.44s: on the side of the trade that you're on
62.70s: so for example gamma this really helps
65.28s: long options so if we're on expiration
68.70s: day gamma is super high because every
72.12s: single option needs to approximate to
74.70s: one or two spots either a zero or a one
78.60s: Delta meaning it's out of the money or
80.76s: in the money that's what's happening on
82.38s: expiration day so gamma is very high
84.66s: because all options need to do that that
87.06s: benefits buyers it hurts sellers what's
89.94s: the trade-off here well beta is also
92.82s: fast moving like gamma that benefits
95.76s: sellers not buyers because all of the
98.10s: options that are out of the money need
100.38s: to approximate to zero so that means
102.84s: Theta is going to Decay very very fast
105.12s: so for a great example of this let's hop
107.16s: over to the platform if we take a look
108.84s: at SPX here and we go to form a which is
111.18s: today's expiration
112.86s: um notice how everything that's out of
114.48s: the money is now essentially bid zero
116.64s: offered at five which means that's the
118.56s: minimum bid I spread these are all
119.88s: worthless and then if we go to one data
122.46s: expiration notice how much premium is
124.44s: still in these options but what I really
126.00s: want to hone you in on is this gamma
127.98s: that's this column here it's a little
129.36s: difficult to see but gamma for at the
131.58s: money options relative to the cost here
133.92s: is gonna be pretty high and it's because
136.32s: they need to make that decision if
138.12s: they're out of the money they're going
139.20s: to zero if they're in the money they're
140.82s: going to whatever their intrinsic value
142.26s: is so again that kind of depending on
144.42s: what side of the coin here whether
145.44s: you're buying or selling and it's you
146.88s: know really the same for calls or puts
148.32s: this fast moving Theta and Gamma
150.90s: benefits both or hurts both the
153.42s: volatility Edge really is going to
155.16s: benefit the sellers out there and this
157.14s: is an important concept too though and
158.76s: this is actually going to be one of the
159.84s: things we talk about later but this
161.82s: really just falls into Theta um decay in
165.12s: some case if you're a seller and that's
167.16s: it the fast moving component is what
169.98s: draws people to these products but
172.44s: depending on what side of the trade
173.70s: you're on it's gonna have a different
174.48s: impact this however is universal no
176.70s: overnight risk if you put on these
179.28s: trades you can go to sleep and just
181.50s: chill out because there's no overnight
183.12s: risk now a super important note here
185.28s: though is I think Traders perpetually
187.80s: look for a boogeyman they're looking for
189.72s: something to justify a behavior and
192.06s: overnight risk is not as scary as it is
194.46s: what I mean by that is if you look at
196.74s: portfolio visualizer.com you throw in a
199.20s: ten thousand dollar portfolio and you
201.18s: look back 30 years whatever the case is
203.22s: that has a lot of overnight risk there's
204.96s: a lot of nights over the course of
206.52s: holding that product but somehow it
207.96s: turns out okay it makes money the point
209.64s: being is overnight risk is not the
211.08s: boogeyman here and there's ways to
212.88s: overcome that by the way we structure
214.92s: the trades which I'm going to get into
215.94s: in a minute so while this is a benefit
218.34s: to be very clear not having overnight
220.20s: risk is a benefit I would not permit
222.78s: your mind to say oh I should only trade
225.96s: zero DTE options because they have no
227.76s: overnight risk and that's where all the
229.26s: risk is it is not the case the risk is
231.36s: actually in your shitty strategy that's
233.34s: it so with that little disclaimer aside
236.10s: let's take a look now at what the con is
238.68s: what's the con this is the largest
241.44s: drawback of zero DTE options and I
244.44s: cannot emphasize this point enough we're
246.30s: going to talk about this at length now
248.46s: you might be saying to yourself Eric the
250.62s: cost is only the 40 cents per contract
253.38s: that I'm putting on that's not so bad
255.60s: not the case so coming back over here
258.84s: again to the platform if we go here to
261.48s: one data expiration and you take a look
263.70s: at the bid ask spread there's slippage
266.34s: involved in where you actually get your
268.92s: fill so this is the 4060 at the money
272.16s: put is bid at 19 offered at 19.50 that's
276.84s: 50 cents right there right out of the
278.88s: gate in addition to your fees that you
280.80s: pay on top and for relative comparison
283.26s: if we go here to 16 June and we go to
285.60s: this at the money these are worth the
288.00s: same 40 60s their bid 9180 offered 93.50
292.38s: so as a percentage these are massively
294.96s: more expensive it's like a two percent
296.70s: plus bid ask spread based on the
299.04s: relative value of this compared to out
301.08s: here this is like 1.85 so the point
303.78s: being is the the spreads you're paying
306.30s: on these again on a relative basis is
308.88s: massive and that's important because
310.32s: we're going to talk more about costs in
311.64s: a minute but this is this is really what
313.86s: we're fighting against here and we're
315.42s: going to talk about how we can do that
316.80s: okay so this is going to be the paper
318.00s: I'm referencing But whichever way I
319.98s: should Point um in this scenario this is
321.60s: the paper we're going to be talking
322.38s: about and there's a bunch of other
324.54s: details that I'm baking into this from
326.88s: both my own data set and then a couple
329.04s: other ancillary information sources but
331.32s: I wanted to use a peer-reviewed data
333.90s: source because there's no reason for
335.40s: anybody to really put a whole bunch of
336.84s: weight on my data although I certainly
338.82s: do it is still worthwhile I think to
341.34s: draw some parallels between these two
342.72s: but this is a pretty well done paper
344.28s: there's to be very clear there's holes
346.38s: in any paper that's done so I do not
348.84s: want you to look at this as if this is
350.46s: the end-all be all authority on
351.90s: everything it's not they make
352.98s: assumptions they have to but we can
355.38s: still learn a lot from this paper so
356.82s: with that aside let's get straight in to
360.12s: it what do Traders do well we can tell
362.88s: that traders in general have really
365.94s: started taking on to this idea of zero
369.12s: DTE expiration so you can see the zero
371.46s: DTE here orange and notice how wide of a
375.30s: space this is taking up in monthly
376.98s: trading volume I guess you can't do that
379.02s: because my stupid face is in the way
380.52s: maybe you can now but as you can see
382.98s: this is a massive space that they're
386.10s: consuming this means that the demand is
388.38s: huge the same thing is if we take a look
391.08s: at zero dte1 dte2 so on and so forth
393.66s: notice how prevalent this is compared to
396.96s: everything out there and if you take a
399.42s: look at just short-term duration so
401.88s: essentially zero and one DTE that is
404.52s: also massive so overall there has been a
408.06s: huge spike in monthly trading volume
410.36s: centralized in zero DTE stuff now we're
413.70s: going to look at slim trading volume and
416.94s: the bliffnotes version of what the hell
418.98s: slim is it's a way for us to look at
421.50s: trade level data from sibo and identify
424.74s: the highest probability of retail trades
427.32s: this does not mean that every trade
429.12s: listed in here is retail but we know
431.52s: with relative confidence that most of it
434.16s: is going to be and this is something
436.08s: that I also track personally so I'm
438.18s: familiar with this concept but the again
440.46s: Cliff Notes version is there is a price
442.68s: Improvement protocol put in a place for
444.72s: small orders and indices and whatnot and
447.24s: most of retail orders fall into that
449.34s: bucket of essentially 10 Lots or less so
451.86s: this is how we're drawing on that it's
453.48s: not perfect but it's pretty good so what
455.70s: I want to highlight here though is the
457.86s: monthly you can essentially insert
460.08s: retail Trader volume in general here the
462.72s: monthly retail Trader volume take a look
464.88s: at the total volume which is blue and
467.28s: how much of that total volume is zero
469.14s: DTE it kind of explains itself ever
471.78s: since we had covid we started launching
473.76s: more expirations there's a demand for it
475.98s: and it's just been maintained to a
478.26s: pretty significant order and you can see
480.84s: the slim shirt compared to total volume
483.12s: so we have it breaks down zero DTE non
486.00s: and then total so on and so forth the
487.50s: point being is it's extremely popular
488.94s: and it's not slowing down that's not a
490.68s: good thing or a bad thing it just means
492.00s: that it's very common now this is where
494.22s: we start getting into kind of more of
495.90s: the specific details that I think is
498.06s: pertinent to most people and this is
499.86s: breaking down zero DTE trading volume
502.50s: from again non-retail versus retail and
506.16s: there's a few notes here that I think
508.32s: are important to you and I've
510.24s: highlighted them here when we talk about
511.74s: the breakdown between calls and puts
513.48s: it's essentially same same for retail
515.58s: versus non-retail light ever so slight
518.10s: variance between the two nothing
519.42s: noteworthy if we look at the size again
521.88s: you can see that the gross
523.98s: centralization for retail is in single
526.98s: contracts and that's not the case for
529.20s: non-retail it's still overwhelming
531.66s: single contracts but there's a bigger
533.34s: breakout between two to five and so on
535.32s: and so forth so when we look at these
537.30s: though this is where it starts to get
538.86s: important when we look at the direction
540.36s: whether we're buying or selling you can
543.36s: see that there is a kind of
545.22s: centralization in buying for retail but
548.46s: selling for institutions now I want to
550.62s: be super clear before all of the Theta
552.36s: gang people out there start saying like
554.16s: oh yep I got it right this is all I
556.14s: should be doing let me put my stupid
557.76s: face right in the middle of the screen
558.96s: to hopefully intercede that thought
560.70s: process that is not the case selling is
563.58s: not some sort of magic potion that fixes
565.50s: everything it's really important to
567.06s: understand why selling works and when
569.22s: selling works I'm not going to go super
570.78s: far into detail on this video I will
572.70s: throw a link to a really great video
574.62s: that I made in the notes Below on this
576.84s: exact concept but it is important to
578.88s: note that in general yelling does have a
582.12s: benefit if it's properly deployed which
584.40s: is why you will see this breakdown where
587.72s: non-retail tends to favor selling a bit
590.40s: now whether it's call or puts you can
593.34s: see that this is you know slightly
595.62s: inverted and there's going to be more
597.72s: selling of both on this side but but if
599.94s: you'll notice you know when we look at
601.62s: the the buy versus sell calls versus
603.60s: puts it's nothing too crazy to walk away
606.66s: from here other than you could tell that
608.58s: we prefer selling and from a non-retail
612.30s: perspective and on a retail perspective
613.92s: they're looking to buy so that aside I
616.44s: want to start getting into some other
618.06s: specifics and this is one of the the
620.70s: funny things right we get to joke about
622.56s: this because it is funny but it's also
624.42s: sad to me at the same time which is the
626.52s: people on Wall Street bets love them I
628.68s: am a fellow eight myself and a
630.42s: degenerate in a lot of instances but in
632.70s: this case it's killing them and the part
634.86s: that makes me sad is a lot of these
636.18s: people don't have a bunch of money to
637.38s: lose what this means is this is just
639.24s: looking how popular zero DTE mentions on
642.06s: Reddit has become and you can see
643.80s: essentially from covid somewhere in here
645.72s: on it's exploded and what does this mean
649.02s: it's lotteries people really want to use
652.02s: these as lotteries they want to be able
654.18s: to make a lot of money very fast and
655.80s: that's not that's not what's happening
657.60s: here you can see this is actually
659.10s: looking looking at net and gross profits
661.44s: remember before when I was really
662.94s: harping on this concept of cost well
665.58s: this is where it's coming to Bear take a
668.34s: look at the orange gross profits even in
671.28s: the periods where retail was doing okay
673.50s: with gross profits it's about cut almost
676.02s: in half after fees even in this peak
679.08s: where they did really well fees took out
681.84s: a giant chunk something to the tune of
685.08s: 40 50 60 depending on which exact point
687.72s: you're looking at and it gets worse
689.22s: because when retail Traders are gross
692.16s: losing money meaning they're just wrong
693.96s: the net after fees is massive these are
698.52s: killing these people and it's a bummer
700.32s: to see so what's going on here well
702.72s: again the fees are not relegated to just
705.78s: the commissions you pay there are also
708.06s: fees that you get from slippage
709.92s: transaction cost payment for order flow
712.20s: non not not super competitive pricing
714.18s: all of these sorts of things start to
715.86s: hurt you now the sibo did Institute that
718.14s: price Improvement program back in in
719.70s: 2020 and that did help but it doesn't
721.62s: fix the problem because payment forward
723.18s: or flow still exists so all of this
725.16s: summarized up just means fees are
727.08s: hurting so if we take a look at net
729.00s: profits of a hundred thousand dollars
730.80s: this is looking at month by month
732.72s: there's a 25 sample size there are four
735.18s: profitable months net profits there are
738.36s: nine profitable months gross so we
741.84s: literally are cut in half in terms of
744.36s: our aggregate profitable trades month
746.52s: over month after we include fees you
748.80s: cannot underestimate the cost of doing
751.14s: business as a retail Trader this is also
753.30s: why when retail Traders talk about oh I
755.34s: like to scalp one you don't because
757.56s: retail Traders really were not equipped
759.66s: to scalp scalping is like seconds it is
761.70s: when you are in and out super fast that
763.50s: is what high frequency trading
764.88s: algorithms are doing to essentially
766.56s: capture bid ass differences mispricings
768.66s: Arbitrage stuff like that in general
770.52s: retail is not going to be fast enough
772.02s: but the bastardized version of scalping
774.66s: we do which really is just intraday
776.94s: trading we think it sounds cool we heard
779.04s: you you know Tom sosnov say who I like
781.38s: but everybody wanted to start doing it
783.12s: so it's cool the problem is it doesn't
784.50s: work well especially once you add in
787.50s: fees not just to mention how difficult
790.20s: it is to get small time frames correct
793.56s: directionally that is one of the hardest
795.48s: time frames to get direct directionally
797.34s: correct what do you mean it's such a
798.60s: short-term time frame why is it so
799.92s: difficult because that's when Randomness
801.66s: is at the highest probability if you
803.76s: think about where the stock market is
805.26s: going to be 10 years from now what do
807.06s: you think higher or lower I would bet
808.98s: higher and if somebody wants to make
810.60s: that bet hit me up I do think it could
812.46s: be an interesting
813.66s: um you know thing to follow along and
815.70s: the point being though most people
817.74s: probably would be confident that it's
819.24s: going to be higher in 10 years relative
821.04s: than it is today but if you talk about
822.84s: whether or not the S P 500 is going to
824.88s: go up within a five second increment or
826.80s: 10 second increment very difficult and
828.66s: then you add fees on top of that because
831.24s: scalping typically includes a lot of
832.92s: very small profits and then not just
834.72s: again commissions but the costs
836.16s: associated with doing it very difficult
837.60s: to make money okay now that that horse
839.16s: is beat thoroughly to death let's just
841.20s: talk about this concept of expensiveness
843.24s: this is actually pretty cool to me so
845.10s: from this paper they actually found that
847.68s: retail orders do better in ivix
850.14s: environments and this is typically when
851.58s: people are attempting to sell but over
853.38s: the duration Traders actually became
856.02s: more sensitive to the expensiveness of
859.08s: options which I actually think is super
861.18s: cool so let's talk now very quickly
863.94s: about kind of the so what of all of this
866.70s: well it's pretty simple that retail
868.74s: Traders really like Lottery like assets
871.20s: which is a bummer but it's to No
873.00s: Surprise there's a reason why the
874.26s: lottery makes so much money and zero DTE
876.18s: options enable that and right now retail
879.06s: Traders again in aggregate essentially
881.70s: lose 358 thousand dollars a day on zero
885.66s: DTE S P 500 options that's awful this is
889.26s: the most disturbing part our findings
891.30s: indicate that more than 60 percent of
893.88s: the Lost each day comes in the form of
896.04s: transaction costs easier enemy I think
898.32s: that we have that Point down so let's
900.24s: talk about what I do the very first
902.10s: thing is now that we understand the
904.38s: fight that we're fighting We Now
906.06s: understand that we need to be very
908.28s: careful of costs and we need to
909.96s: construct strategies that enable us to
912.00s: do that so what does that mean well if
913.68s: you like to trade spreads which I don't
915.60s: especially in this context if you're
917.58s: trading iron condors and verticals in
920.10s: zero DTE stuff you are literally getting
922.20s: chewed alive so I typically prefer
924.66s: simple single options whether it's short
926.58s: calls short puts short straddles short
928.74s: strangles it's typically going to be
930.12s: short straddles and notice how I
931.80s: emphasized short on all of those I tend
934.08s: to sell and the reason why I tend to
935.58s: sell is because
937.14s: um there is a Delta range that is really
940.80s: beneficial to sell especially in
942.78s: short-term time frames because of this
944.82s: the IV HV variance is very large and it
949.32s: needs to approximate so if you are
951.66s: trading in a period where the variance
954.06s: between implied and historic volatility
955.56s: is very high you start to stack the deck
957.54s: in your favor and again that video I
958.80s: linked to to before we'll go through
960.54s: this in more detail but this is really
962.40s: important because notice how I didn't
963.78s: say when implied volatility percentile
965.76s: is high or when implied volatility is
967.92s: high or when implied volatility rank is
969.84s: high it's because that's not the period
972.06s: that actually matters what we're trying
974.40s: to capture is the variance risk premium
976.26s: in this scenario and that is when IV is
978.60s: overstated compared to HV that can
981.00s: happen when implied volatility
982.38s: percentile is high when it's low what we
984.72s: want to avoid is when it's in a
986.10s: transition period that's bad so this is
988.08s: when we really try to benefit from the
989.46s: clustering properties of volatility so
991.38s: the other thing here is limit frequency
993.24s: this isn't my go-to I trade and I
995.82s: actually traded it this week on the Fed
998.04s: rate announcement I traded zero DTE
1000.38s: options that's because there's a clear
1002.00s: Catalyst things like that announcements
1004.58s: things like earning statements earnings
1007.04s: releases those are all great catalysts
1009.92s: that really give us a bigger kind of
1012.32s: piece of the pie that we potentially can
1014.18s: chew off and then the other scenarios
1016.52s: when there's a large ivhv variance
1018.50s: because again I'm I'm gonna tend to sell
1020.30s: and that's what I want to see notice how
1021.98s: there's only really two conditions here
1023.54s: this isn't because I think I can make
1025.22s: money faster I don't this isn't because
1027.08s: I'm scared of overnight risk I'm not
1028.82s: this is really the two scenarios where
1031.28s: this makes sense for me to integrate
1032.84s: into my overall approach so if this
1035.72s: video was helpful don't forget to
1037.16s: comment below what you found useful like
1039.44s: subscribe be an outlier share with some
1041.36s: friends and I'll catch you guys later
