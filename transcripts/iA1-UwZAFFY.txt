0.00s: Was that option bought or sold?
2.88s: One of the things you can do is a retail option's traders pay very close attention to order
6.72s: flow and see if anything sticking out to you.
9.00s: I actually had a trade that I reviewed today on that exact concept.
12.16s: However, what we do is we take a guess.
15.96s: So if we take a look at the call volume and the put volume above my head here in GM,
19.96s: we can see what percentage traded at the bid or at the offer.
24.32s: Things that trade at the bid, we typically associate that with a sale and things that trade
29.04s: at the offer.
30.04s: We typically associate with a buy.
33.80s: And I find it really interesting here because a lot of people think that this is definitive,
39.00s: but it's not.
40.16s: We don't know conclusively if an option trades at the bid that it is a sale.
45.16s: We assume that it is, but there are extraneous circumstances where it could be a buy
50.76s: if it shifted during the course of the trade.
53.28s: There's a lot of weird little quirks like that.
55.16s: Although they are the exception not the rule, it's pretty solid otherwise being out
60.20s: of sale later.
