0.00s: I love me some irony. This video is going to be about irony. It's going to be about Andrew
6.50s: left in Citroën research and what's going on with them because there's some really interesting
12.88s: information that's starting to come out with a recent DOJ filing, which we're going to
17.82s: go into all of that. This is primarily going to be about that with a quick recap of Game
22.32s: Stop's expiration today. So for those tuning in, today's about Game Stop for two days in
27.64s: a row, they don't have to get over it for those that want to see something else. We will
31.22s: have time for that for sure, but there's always time in the schedule for just some solid
38.78s: irony. So here we have Citroën research, Andrew
42.84s: left firm. And this was back on three June. And in here it says, we, what made Keith
51.06s: Gil interesting initially was his authenticity. Skip a bunch of words. This time it feels
56.32s: different, appearing more like manipulation without a solid thesis. Now again, trying
63.44s: to be as objective as humanly possible, I could see a world where somebody could think
69.60s: that. If you don't know anything else about Rowan Kitty and you probably operate in a
74.40s: really scummy place where people do stuff like that all the time, sure, maybe. But here's
81.04s: the irony. Andrew left 54 charge with a 16 million stock market manipulation scheme.
94.24s: But, but, but Rowan Kitty is the one manipulating things. Love that. Just love that. It's one of
102.96s: the best ways to try and keep the spotlight off you is to cast rocks at other people
107.92s: for the shit that you're doing. So I want to highlight for the non GME folks, something
114.96s: to be aware of. The ape community, which I still very much view myself as a guest, I
121.28s: do not have the depth with the entire story. I'm still learning about it literally every
126.04s: day. I am not as well versed in this stuff as everybody else. But I begin to understand
132.88s: their perspective of the world of markets and why they say and think the way they do at times.
141.44s: Because if you talk to an ape or somebody that's been around the GME community, they'll
145.44s: pretty much tell you that everything's rigged. It's all bullshit. And I don't fully fall into
150.40s: that camp myself. I do think that a lot of the market is efficient to a degree. I don't think
155.60s: it's perfectly efficient to a degree. But also to their credence, there's very clear examples
162.48s: of this shit, a very clear manipulation. So as I try to remind you guys, my goal when I'm
170.08s: reviewing any sort of information, specifically investing, trading, financial information to come
174.72s: up with ideas, I want to try be as objective as possible. How can I look at this information
180.64s: and strip away as much of my bias as I can, acknowledging the fact that it's never fully gone.
186.56s: It'll still be there to a degree. But I want to be cognizant that it's there. And I think for
192.16s: the people that are not as close to the ape community, the GME story stuff like this,
197.60s: I think those people sometimes are in Lalla land where they think that markets are efficient.
202.16s: It's all fair. It's competitively priced. And then that's one of the reasons why some of those
207.20s: folks might make the jump and say, oh, the GME community, they're all tinfoil hats, conspiracy
214.88s: theorists, they've all gone off the deep end. And it's so easy to dismiss broad concepts and ideas
220.56s: like that and lose all of the nuance because something gets people to that level.
225.84s: So what I would say for the people that aren't familiar with the GME story,
231.92s: this is why, this is why you have people in the ape community that are like, this is all
237.52s: bullshit. And how could you blame them? You have some dude that's throwing rocks at somebody
242.56s: talking about manipulation. Yet this guy has what, 17 counts of securities fraud and one count
250.48s: of securities fraud scheme. That's really difficult to reconcile. Now for the GME folks,
257.92s: I also think it's important to not go too far to where you think everything is rigged.
263.84s: Because then it kind of begs the question, why even do I do anything here?
269.44s: So to me, the truth typically lies in the middle of perspectives like this to a degree,
275.12s: but it is really important to acknowledge that when people hear about GameStop, the ape community,
281.36s: the GME movement, like all those kinds of things, it's not this radical idea. There are clear
288.16s: and very straightforward elements of different kinds of market manipulation to different degrees,
294.96s: different kinds of fraud that are in broad fucking daylight that nothing has happened for a long time.
301.36s: And now it looks like the SEC is finally doing something. Now this goes down a whole other path
308.32s: where I see people saying like, oh, well, this doesn't fix anything or this is just a drop in the
312.56s: bucket. And I don't disagree. This doesn't inherently fix anything. This is not even anything yet.
318.32s: Right? These are just charges. This is just an accusation technically. He's not convicted of shit.
323.68s: So we're at the very infancy of all of this. But what I try to remind people is that it's a step
331.36s: in the right direction. And if you ever get to the point where you're so disenfranchised that a step
337.44s: in the right direction still is meaningless to you, then you probably got to try and re-centred
343.68s: yourself just a little bit so that you can at least see that this is at least a positive direction.
350.88s: Does this entirely fix everything? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. But it's something. And seeing
357.28s: stuff like this starting to come to light is encouraging to me. So I'm excited to see it. Plus,
364.00s: again, like I said in the beginning, I love me some irony, especially when you have some sort of
370.00s: shitty person like this that's throwing rocks at somebody else that's being accused of this.
376.48s: Now it is important to say that he's charged. He's accused of this. This doesn't mean he did this.
385.12s: And again, trying to be middle of the road and to try to allow the system some time to work,
391.28s: then based on the rest of the evidence that we see, based on the arguments that come out,
396.00s: then we can make a decision in an educated one. But right now he's just charged with this stuff.
401.52s: So I probably, again, like to just bear myself to you guys, my bias is I think this dude did this
409.84s: shit. I do think that. But I'm not going to let that bias dictate to me that I conclude with him
416.40s: being charged that he did do it. I need to see the information still. But I do lean that way.
422.72s: Now the other important thing here is that he might have done some of this. Typically when people
429.28s: are going to be charged like this, the DOJ is going to come with everything that they can find
433.44s: in the hopes that as much of it sticks as possible. There's also a reality where he did more than
438.40s: this. And this is just what the DOJ thinks that they can pin to them. All of that boils down to
445.04s: the fact that something is happening here. And I'm really, really excited to see how this plays out
450.64s: and what kind of attention this gets. That's the thing. That's why I'm making a video about it.
454.48s: I'm not an attorney. I don't know anything about any of this stuff. I, like I said, I don't even know
457.84s: that much about GameStop. I've been learning about it for a few months now. And I have a long way to
462.08s: go before I fully know all the details in the story. But I'm really excited to see this. And I'm
468.00s: trying to help spread information about it because I think it's important that this shit gets
472.88s: out far and wide so that people can stop looking at the GME and the apes is just tinfoil had,
479.68s: people that have gone off the deep end and start to understand some of the perspective. But then also
483.68s: to see that there's some bullshit going on in the market. And people need to be aware of it. And
488.72s: I see this as the DOJ finally starting to even pretend to do something about it. Whether I'm
494.56s: eager to see how this goes based on another case recently with Atlas and all those guys. There
500.08s: was some nasty components to that that left a bunch of those guys getting off, which is kind of
504.56s: frustrating to see because that one was also pretty clear based on the evidence that I saw that
509.84s: there was some shady things going on. But because of some technicalities, essentially quite a few of
515.84s: them got off. Which the funny part about that though is one of them took a plea deal in the
520.32s: beginning. And I think that one that one took the plea. So they obviously are getting hammered
524.72s: to a degree where everybody else got off because they fought through it. But I mean they rolled the
528.24s: dice and they were able to navigate it. So I guess that part is okay for them, but it's
534.48s: shitty to see that case go like that. So I hope this doesn't follow that example. But let's see
539.68s: what this is. So it says if convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison on the securities fraud
545.76s: scheme 20 years in prison on each securities fraud count. So there's 17 of those depending on
553.92s: what the average lifespan is and depending on how fast Elon Musk can start implant and chips and
559.04s: people's brains and replace and limbs. We'll see. But based on current human biology, this is the rest
565.36s: of this dude's life in five years in prison on the false statements count. This one right here.
571.36s: Separately, the SEC's complaint alleges that left engaged in a 20 million multi-year scheme
579.76s: to defraud followers by publishing false and misleading statements regarding his supposed stock
585.28s: trading recommendations. The SEC is seeking dis-gorgement not going to lie. No idea what that
592.40s: means in this context. Act of giving up something. Okay. So you got to give stuff up. Prejudgment
598.72s: interest and civil monetary penalties against left and his companies to try and conduct based
604.88s: injunctions and officer and director bar and a penny stock bar. So essentially not letting him
611.68s: participate securities. The other side, I think that the government interest is trying to regulate
618.16s: through cases they prosecute as a result of a mean stock craze. Left has been around since 2001
625.68s: his attorney tells Axios these guys. The DOG's indictment is based on contorted rhetoric,
632.64s: trying to make it appear like he was telling lies and there was not one lie alleged that he's
638.80s: provable. Love that. I mean, listen, shout out to the attorney. He's not even trying to play
645.28s: anything other than technicalities. He's not saying my boy didn't lie. He's not saying my boy
649.92s: did lie. He's just saying, proving which is hilarious. So this is epic and it says left is expected
658.00s: to be arraigned in the next few weeks in the US District Court in downtown LA. So here's the rest
665.60s: of the statement you guys are free to look through this as much as you want. It's kind of essentially
672.24s: a a double down. This was just like a good synopsis that you could check out, which is pretty good.
677.76s: And let's see, there was a couple of other statements from this lawyer here. It says
684.40s: the investor plans to fight the charges. There is no crime here. He said Mr. Left is a publisher
689.84s: who has taken extraordinary steps to comply with all laws and neither the DOJ nor the SEC alleged
695.44s: that he ever once published information, he believes was not true and published. That's a notice
699.60s: that right? He believed was not true and published. So his attorney, again, I'm not a lawyer.
706.24s: There's probably going to be really good lawyers that look at this stuff. But for me, I'm seeing
710.16s: that is provable. And in this case, he believed not true when published, right? New wants. They're
717.04s: looking for new wants here. So that's interesting because there's not a statement here saying that
722.64s: he didn't do this. Again, they're being really calculated what they're saying, which I actually think
728.96s: is smart from his attorney's perspective. So I mean, this is been fascinating to see going down.
737.68s: I'm excited to see where it goes. And yeah, let's see a quick look at GameStop now.
742.64s: So today was, I mean, one of the most inside days you can think of, we had a high of 2477
749.92s: in a low of 2411. Yep. You heard that right. That is a just tiny range for the stock. 66 cents
760.08s: is all it moved today. It just hung out pretty rock steady here. I don't think anybody really
766.72s: anticipated anything else. The stock has been quieting down. Today's sale volume was massive,
772.56s: 97% sale volume. And you can see even though that it was that much sale volume, the stock didn't
778.64s: move a ton. So again, it's just hanging right around this area of support and resistance. And
784.96s: the other thing I want to make a quick note about, there's been a couple videos where I say like
787.92s: technical analysis doesn't matter. And I realize people are taking that literally rightfully so
792.08s: because that's what I'm saying. But I just want to clarify what I mean by that. When we're looking
795.84s: at something like this, technical analysis is essentially a study of human behavior and habits.
803.20s: So when we look at standard technical analysis, we're trying to make inferences based on standard
810.08s: human behavior and how that essentially leads to different behaviors in the markets. The reason why
815.84s: I say technical analysis doesn't work really what I should be saying is standard technical analysis
820.96s: doesn't work because the things that you would typically apply in a quote unquote normal technical
827.20s: analysis approach depending on how colorful or how quantitative you want to get don't really hold
832.88s: here. So what that means is, for example, when I'm figuring out what kind of technical analysis tools,
838.88s: I want to use the standard deviation channels, the different moving averages, the volume profile.
843.84s: I'm not just picking stuff that I think I can see trends. I'm testing it. I have a really large
848.88s: data set that I've purchased from SIBO that includes underlying and options data. So I test the
856.48s: objective performance of the different tools by themselves. That means without my interpretation of
863.28s: them, how does this tool objectively work? What is its overall efficacy? How frequently? What is the
870.88s: standard deviation of the variance from whatever its alerts or signals are? So that I have an
877.36s: understanding of the tools. That's why I have what I have. And when I do all of that with GameStop,
883.36s: all of the standard relationships that I see generally break down, they go away. Stuff that I see
888.80s: in literally hundreds of other underlines does not work here. So that's what I mean because
895.28s: what I can tell you is that the frequency that you see things that go from 995 to 65 80 plus pre-market
903.04s: is seldom. That's not normal. So when you think about the application of standardized technical
910.16s: analysis, you're trying to pick up on standardized behavior. So support in resistance, the idea that
916.00s: every time price gets to this level, people continue to buy it or sell it, keeping it within a
921.20s: certain range of some sort. That's what it infers. That doesn't work here because the other thing
927.04s: that you probably would assume then is as soon as it started getting up here, where is that 16 from
932.24s: 10? It just kept going up. And then why would it keep going from here? So I'm not saying that it
938.32s: can or can't. But what I'm saying is that the standard analysis that you would apply to things
942.96s: like this, there are so many anomalies when you look at the price performance of the stock that
949.76s: standard analysis breaks down. So I make that differentiation because the way that I look at this
955.36s: is through technical analysis, but it's very modified. The way that I interpret the information that
960.56s: I'm looking at is very different than if I'm looking at something like Apple, the way that I'm
966.08s: going to analyze price, I mean, just look at the difference in the chart. It looks completely
969.60s: different. And if you look at most other large cap stocks, the chart will look something like this.
975.84s: So what I'm highlighting to you is that when you look at something like GameStop or even things
979.84s: like biotech stocks, it's not specific to just GameStop. But there's a completely different series
985.52s: of catalysts that are moving the price. And that leads to different price behavior and air go,
992.24s: different requisite analysis needed in order to apply technical analysis. Because if you're
999.28s: applying standard technical analysis, this will leave you behind over and over and over again.
1005.20s: So yeah, things that I really like to wait in terms of analysis are price and volume, right?
1011.60s: That's standard. And for me, that's one of the biggest things here. Because when you look at stuff
1016.80s: like this, the moving averages are ascending, they're widening in terms of the distance between them.
1023.60s: There's no reason technically from a moving average perspective why this would crater like that.
1029.60s: If these are doing that, that typically means you'll get some level of continuation. It's across
1033.44s: all of them. It doesn't happen here. And it's because of a bunch of structural reasons that lead
1039.04s: this to behave very differently. So I just wanted to clarify that. I'm not saying that you can't apply
1044.64s: technical analysis. I do all the time. It's how I find the trades. But what I really am trying to say
1049.36s: is that there is a different kind of analysis required when you're looking at stuff like this.
1054.88s: That's all. You'll find periods, especially going back over the last three years, where
1059.36s: Bollinger bands are telling you that something is supposed to explode. They're super constricted.
1064.24s: And then nothing happens. And it doesn't happen for weeks. So it's a really, really nuanced product.
1069.92s: I'm actually in the process of analyzing tons of different indicators just because it's so
1075.60s: anomalous to me. And I want to know the other indicators that I don't technically use that much.
1079.76s: Maybe they work even better in this than what they work in the other products that I tend to trade.
1084.56s: That's the fun part about something like this, about something that behaves so differently.
1089.84s: So yeah, there's that. All right, let's take a look at the options quick.
1093.44s: We got a few things going on. Volume today 161,000 calls versus 51,000 puts.
1100.48s: And if you take a look, it again looks like more positions moving out at the 25.
1105.36s: So at the 25, we had 22,000 volume in the front expiration. And then in two aug,
1114.88s: Nest week next week's expiration, we had 14,938. To me, I would assume I've been looked at this yet.
1120.80s: I would assume if I open this up, the 25s will have decreased from yesterday.
1125.68s: And my guess is, well, they're all going to be gone now because they expired. But that's my first
1130.08s: guess. Let's see. 25s, did they damn it? Completely wrong. That surprises me.
1136.64s: So anyways, my hypothesis was starting yesterday. I thought that most people were rolling out. Now,
1142.96s: we'll be able to see how many of these did move out net net because there was a lot of volume yesterday.
1148.48s: So it just means that not all of it was rolling out. It means that some people were opening positions
1153.44s: here. So now let's take a look at the two aug. And my guess is the 25 strike, the 25 calls would be
1159.92s: expanding in OI. That's my guess here. Let's see. Okay, got that one right. We're one for two,
1167.44s: which doesn't mean much. So I would throw essentially everything I say out. But what I also can tell
1172.56s: you though is objectively speaking, there's 15,000 volume against 10,500 OI. So there is going to be
1179.12s: at least another 4,000 plus added onto this. So people are still scaling into these 25s. That's
1186.24s: for sure. So this surprised me a little bit to see people still opening 25s. But there was enough
1191.76s: of people opening 25s that it accounted and overwhelmed the number that we're moving out,
1198.16s: rolling out to this. That's essentially what that means. And the reason why I didn't edit any of
1202.80s: that out and make it look like I know is because I think you guys should be completely
1207.68s: full well aware that it were wrong. Traders are wrong all the time. I am literally wrong all the time.
1214.48s: Nobody knows everything. One of the worst things that you can find in somebody is that they make a
1220.08s: bunch of guesses predictions. And then the only thing you hear from them is when they eventually
1224.80s: get something right. That right there is somebody who's too tight to their ego and they're a
1229.68s: bullshit artist. They don't want you to look at the failed track record. They only want you to look
1233.60s: at all this shit that they got right. However, a few or a large that is compared to the sample that
1238.00s: was wrong. And from a consumption standpoint in terms of receiving information, you guys have to
1243.36s: be so careful of that because there's so many people that just like seeming infallible and it's
1248.64s: bullshit. We're wrong all the time. I'm literally I was literally just wrong. So don't ever listen
1255.28s: to somebody just blindly and think that because they're making a video or doing something like this
1260.64s: that they know what the fuck they're talking about. We're all figuring it out together. So I just
1265.60s: think it's so important to reiterate that message because I see a lot of people sending stuff in
1270.48s: of all these different people coming up with these different theories and ideas about what might
1274.56s: happen in that school. But the problem is is that if you buy into them each one of them thinking,
1280.88s: okay, this is the one and then this is the one and then it continues not being the one that leads
1285.84s: to a disenfranchised human being that then when there might be really good information, they're just
1290.72s: like, ah, it's all bullshit. None of this matters. And it sends you down that path, which to me is not
1295.92s: an effective path, especially for something like trading. So yeah, completely wrong there. Back to
1301.76s: this though. I see a few other things going on. As you can tell, the two-walk is still being built
1308.16s: out. Let's see to what degree though. So if we check out the OI and interesting. So this is
1316.40s: starting to scale up more. So we're now at 750,000 total calls to 400,000 total puts. So this is now
1324.16s: getting closer and closer and closer to being at least two to one calls to puts, which again,
1329.44s: that's the general configuration that I've seen previously when this thing was starting to make
1335.04s: big moves up. It's still not there to be very clear. We still have a ways to go. But it's at
1339.60s: least drifting that way. And then let's take a look at these expiration. So the two-walk has 71,000
1346.00s: versus 34,000. So it's essentially two to one, but very light. There's not a lot of conviction
1351.44s: and two-walk. Nine-walk is 26 to 9,000. Just not much there. 16-walk is the next one. And again,
1359.52s: this is almost two to one 200,000 calls to 109K puts. So this to me looks like the next
1367.52s: expectation of a busy cycle. Which again, this aligns beautifully. This is very standard for options.
1373.92s: This is not novel to GameStop where you tend to see more activity in the monthly explorations. They're
1380.56s: more liquid. That's what's happening here. Now, if I'm not mistaken, there was a couple bigger
1388.08s: positions being built out. Yeah. So like these, I've been keeping an eye on these 24s. And it's
1394.00s: because it's not a ton of options, but they're right at the money. And there was another 2,000 traded
1400.56s: today. I'm assuming not all of that is closing. I probably would wager more of that is opening
1404.40s: than closing. And net over yesterday was plus 1,500. So people are starting to build out these 24s.
1410.00s: That's interesting because these are right at the money. As people are buying stuff like that,
1414.16s: it forces the market makers to consider how they want to manage that position. So it's already
1418.56s: over a 50 delta. It's only got seven days left to go. So you don't want to not have the
1423.84s: underlying in order to hedge these if you get an even moderate price accommodation and they fall
1428.56s: further in the money because then you have to start hedging the rest of these that are now bigger
1431.68s: by buying more and more shares. Notice the configuration here. This is actually interesting to me.
1436.96s: 2,000, 1100, 10,000, 1,000, 3,000, 1,000, 2,000, right? That's a lot of shares. And they're all stacked
1444.96s: like that. So as market makers go out and they have to buy the 24s by to cover the 24s, I should say,
1453.60s: then that could conceivably push the 24 and a half in. Then the 24 and a halfs go in. Then we have
1459.12s: to buy to hedge those and that could push us just enough to put us into the 25s, which is a much
1463.68s: bigger strike. Now we got to buy even more, which can easily push you to the 25s and a half to
1467.92s: the 26s over the cat. And you get what I'm talking about. This is essentially what starts a gamma
1472.32s: squeeze. Now I don't want to get people's hopes up. I think you would need much deeper options
1476.48s: chains, but it wouldn't surprise me to see a smaller element of that potentially go with that kind
1481.60s: of buying behavior because it's solo volume because it's solo volume because there's not a ton of
1489.60s: transactions happen on a daily basis. Those kinds of relative style transactions can start to have
1494.88s: a bigger impact on the chain. But again, going all the way back to what I was saying, nobody knows,
1499.68s: nobody is, is been omnipotent. I don't know if you should think anybody's got it right yet.
1503.76s: So what I'm talking about should be completely filtered very heavily so that you are doing what's
1509.28s: right for you. But that's just an interesting function here. Again, in order for this to be like a
1514.72s: true gamma squeeze or something like that, these would have to be really heavy. And we would need
1519.20s: the market makers essentially punch each other in the face so that they can grab shares so that
1524.24s: they can cover theirs, which would make it more difficult for another market maker to get their
1528.64s: shares, really skyrocketing price. I don't necessarily see that here, but I do see an interesting
1534.40s: stacking of OI for all of these right at the monies, which that is interesting to me. We'll have to
1540.00s: see if that leads to some sort of upside pressure in the underlying. I just realized I'm already
1545.84s: at 25 minutes rambling about this. So I am going to wrap it up here. If there's any questions,
1550.48s: let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
