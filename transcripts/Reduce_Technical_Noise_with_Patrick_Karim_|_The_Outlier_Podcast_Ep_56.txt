0.12s: okay
1.08s: awesome I could even everybody Eric here
4.00s: welcome back to all the outliers we're
5.52s: kicking off another outlier podcast I
7.68s: got my friend Patrick here we were
9.00s: literally just talking about ta so one
11.48s: welcome back but two let's get right
13.08s: back to that conversation you were
14.36s: talking me through the context of using
17.52s: technical analysis and relative time
19.08s: frames and I thought it was too good not
20.40s: to record it and well I'm happy to be
22.80s: here it's always been like that like
24.44s: always the conversations I have with uh
27.36s: with uh the interviewer before it's like
29.48s: man even me when I we host people I say
31.72s: okay I should have a habit of hitting
33.80s: record and then just because there's
36.52s: there stuff it's gold and yeah look time
40.04s: frames I posted something on Twitter I
41.72s: don't I could maybe share my um my
44.92s: screen there yeah just to to show people
49.24s: wait you should have rights there so I
53.84s: did this a while back because okay chart
57.04s: Basics on charts guys chart trading and
59.92s: I always trying to uh I don't want to
61.60s: use the word educate but just share this
64.20s: information in Char trading everything
66.28s: is defined by time frame and often
67.72s: you'll say somebody oh I have a breakout
69.36s: breakouts confirmed but people who who
72.56s: don't know about chart trading they just
73.92s: hear the word breakout and they think
75.24s: it's a buy and then they take their
79.04s: mindset their time scale and they apply
81.12s: it to that word but you have to know
83.24s: where did that breakout where was it
85.24s: defined in what realm because if the guy
86.84s: says it's a daily chart defined breakout
89.36s: and you okay I have a breakout I'm going
91.44s: to write this for eight years no there's
93.24s: going to be many breakouts and
95.36s: breakdowns on the daily chart while if
98.28s: if you have a long-term scope you should
99.88s: probably be looking at quarterly charts
101.64s: and because if you have a chart defined
103.32s: breakout on a quarterly chart that thing
105.60s: probably before it breaks down you're
107.84s: going to get five six years whatever
110.76s: you're able to run but within that
112.52s: there'll be run-ups then you'll have
114.00s: breakdowns on the smaller time frames
115.60s: and then we could use like shorter term
117.36s: moving averages to to be able to exit
120.36s: into that like you know shorter term MO
123.08s: fomo so depending on the chart type
125.88s: candle candle charts line charts point
128.16s: and figure charts they each have their
130.92s: own parameters because I C and they each
135.56s: have their own time frame and all that
138.56s: has to be uh pondered and and weighed
140.84s: accordingly so that's why I love
142.96s: December December it's crazy Eric we're
144.84s: coming up December guess what guys
146.80s: December 29th it's a yearly candle close
150.28s: it's a semestral candle close it's a
152.04s: quarterly candle close it's a weekly
153.96s: candle close and a daily candle close
155.80s: man I'm going to be working during the
157.20s: holidays if ever you get it you do it
160.28s: only once a year guys look at those
161.52s: yearly charts those semestrial charts
163.08s: and quarterly charts like now because
164.68s: you might have the
165.88s: greatest entries right now after
169.12s: Christmas when you get those yearly
171.24s: candle closes and if you get a Synergy
173.80s: of all those breaking out at the same
175.96s: time it's like golden it's like people
178.40s: looking at the gold chart gold had a
180.32s: weekly defined breakout had a monthly
182.92s: defined breakout did not have a daily
184.96s: yet it could possibly get a corly uh
188.60s: breakout and yearly and semestrial in a
191.32s: week or two so if you're patient before
194.52s: just like jumping in all in just give
196.76s: yourself a week or two let the dust
198.64s: settle let's see how the year closes and
201.76s: then that could remove a lot of noise
206.24s: because I've seen so many times people
207.80s: jump in let's say even somebody say oh
210.12s: look Patrick I'm on the monthly chart
211.88s: the price is way above let's I have a
213.44s: breakout line at a th000 and during the
215.36s: month the price 1,200 it's convincing
219.08s: and I've seen it so many times even me I
221.04s: fell for it oh man it's not going to go
222.64s: back down below the breakdown line
223.92s: there's only two three trading days and
225.52s: guess what happened bam the price goes
228.20s: below the breakout line it leaves a wick
230.52s: which I call noise that's why Japanese
232.60s: candles they're like awesome because
235.24s: it's the clothes that matters the body
237.08s: and the Wicks was noise from the smaller
239.00s: time frames
240.48s: and how many how many times I've seen
243.36s: these possible breakouts but because I
245.76s: did not wait for the monthly close I got
248.08s: trapped look I could you have the best
249.76s: example here I'll show you the um let's
252.80s: go down memory lane I'll show you the
254.24s: gold
255.04s: chart here is the monthly candle chart
258.28s: and guys It's always important if ever
260.08s: you go on the on the chart always look
262.00s: at
263.60s: the here right here at the at the time
266.88s: frame all these weeks here somebody
269.88s: could have thought it was a breakout oh
271.56s: look during the month during the month
273.28s: for one month here it was out of the
275.04s: cloud two months 3 months four months it
277.08s: was uh above this uh breakout breakout
279.32s: line but every time it trapped people
281.60s: tra people tra people what you want to
283.12s: do is you want to wait for a drastically
286.28s: convincing
287.60s: breakout like this removed all doubt it
290.60s: cleared even cleared the Wicks which is
293.28s: optional but it it solidly closed above
296.04s: all these all these closes and that's
300.08s: how you reduce noise and this is how you
303.36s: have a higher probability of having a
306.36s: sustained run is once the the Market's
309.88s: clear and look this is another thing
312.88s: people often tell me Well Patrick you
314.28s: missed you missed a 70% move well
318.32s: guys this is this is a a revelation I
322.16s: had recently is a good chart Trader will
324.36s: learn to know which moves he needs to
327.92s: avoid which moves to not enter right
330.92s: like you don't you should never have
333.32s: fomo as you see this going up but you
335.20s: know you have a clear breakout line
336.76s: above this move yes it's it's adrenaline
339.28s: rush and it's it's Bonkers and you say
341.84s: I'm gonna get in early because I'll be
343.00s: able to buy more and then I'll make more
346.12s: money right the greed Factor starts
348.16s: kicking in but you gotta say look it's
350.24s: going up but you want to be trapped
352.48s: unless your play was to to buy like the
355.24s: move up and sell at the resistance but
357.52s: if your idea is to buy anywhere in this
359.80s: basing formation because you wanted to
362.08s: play the fast remove reverse upwards
365.76s: then the
367.96s: probabilities as long as you're below
369.72s: this line the probabilities will always
371.44s: be
372.60s: lower for you to have a crazy move like
375.00s: that than after you're above because
376.84s: once you're above then this resistance
379.52s: now becomes support and so like 80% of
382.24s: the time you have a pullback and but
384.36s: this this was this one was so
386.68s: convincing we did practically didn't
389.12s: have a pullback but most of the time you
390.64s: you have some type of pullback to retest
392.20s: it and then it shoots up so never fear
395.24s: fear of missing out the the the line
397.60s: share I tell people it's this this move
399.92s: here this is a line share of
402.64s: the of the trade and you can't even
405.24s: catch probably the top I somebody could
406.72s: have probably even sold even at previous
408.72s: highs even here at the wall the move you
412.08s: could have just traded this this move
414.04s: here you know huge
415.68s: base and in two three months man you're
418.48s: like it's done right the the move's done
421.40s: but this this is these are the lower
423.32s: risk plays so this is like where we are
426.56s: today for gold a lot of people like oh
429.24s: go can't go down well look I don't know
431.96s: if you what if your thesis is wrong
433.84s: that's what I tell people people in
435.96s: hindsight they say oh look I told you
437.36s: Patrick I bought here I'm a genius well
439.60s: okay well what if the price would have
440.88s: went
441.64s: down like how do
444.00s: you how do you conciliate all that
447.24s: always wait for the breakout and even
448.72s: after you get a break break out it could
451.20s: still fail so it's not 100% right it's
453.96s: not 100% probability but statistically
457.48s: these once you you've cleared convincing
459.72s: break uh
461.16s: convincing resistance and breakout line
463.96s: you're supposed to It's supposed to to
467.08s: to go like that right 80% of the time
469.32s: but if it doesn't then no no no problem
472.36s: it fails Falls breakout you exit and you
474.80s: wait for a new pattern to morph into
476.52s: existence right and each F time you get
478.56s: a fa Breakout a new pattern morphs into
480.52s: existence and then you just wait you
482.60s: don't want to get trapped anybody who
484.28s: bought here unfortunately there they
486.56s: they got trapped see all these Wicks I
488.00s: was crazy Eric look at these Wicks traps
490.24s: even me you should I was like the
492.12s: emotions they get you right oh look the
494.60s: price is above but look by the end of
496.12s: the month the price sunk back sunk back
499.08s: all these Wicks but look I I know gold
502.36s: did a crazy Spike overnight there but it
505.20s: doesn't get more convincing than that
506.76s: there like unless you get something like
508.40s: your head back here in June of
511.04s: 2019 that monthly candle close was very
515.00s: very convincing and even here intram
516.92s: month this month the price that Wick the
519.72s: price action was all the way down here
521.16s: during the month it was red candle it
522.56s: looked terrible but then after
525.40s: that the the buyers they came in and
528.32s: what we have right now is some type of
530.28s: spinning dogee uh it could be here like
533.20s: uh here in the January of 2020 February
535.60s: of 2020 we'll have to see if that's
538.04s: going to be a continuation or top but
540.16s: you're above resistance the trend you're
542.60s: above a one-year moving average above
544.04s: the chuku cloud above a threee moving
546.08s: average um the bias is on the monthly
549.44s: time frame the bias is it's it's upwards
552.28s: right I I know I've been hearing people
554.08s: like giving some some $1,200 Target for
557.04s: gold and all that which is fine but you
559.40s: have
560.64s: to weigh that what okay what are the
563.60s: probabilities of having 1,200 gold at
566.68s: this stage today so I would tell people
569.72s: as long as you're above an inclining
571.04s: one- year moving average and you're
572.76s: above a rising trend line above the
575.56s: three-year moving average then the
577.72s: probabilities are reaching 1,200 right
579.48s: now they're they're just they're just
581.00s: not there yet right it's just like here
582.60s: when the price was going down for gold
584.48s: and somebody tell you while gold has to
586.40s: has to Skyrocket back up to 2,000 well
589.68s: the probabilities of gold skyrocketing
591.44s: to 2,000 as it's trending below a threee
594.96s: trending below one year they're lower
597.36s: you're just they're just lower and then
599.16s: just need time to to
601.24s: heal and um yeah I'm sorry I just I just
604.48s: went off on a tangent there but uh all
606.12s: these things they they they all link up
609.32s: together I could have done this on the
611.80s: let's say we have the um the corly close
615.60s: for
616.96s: gold so this is what we're dealing with
619.24s: for for the corly
621.60s: close even here we this is very
624.24s: aggressive it's it's a
626.24s: rising look a rising trend line when it
629.36s: breaks to the upside often either either
631.92s: it's a false
633.20s: breakout and the price reverts down or
636.36s: you create some type of uh like a
639.12s: Sometimes some people call it a
640.12s: Livermore accumulation there and it just
641.68s: squeezes up and then it just goes
644.40s: Bonkers we have to wait now for the end
646.40s: of the month there there's that Wick if
648.32s: gold is able to
649.84s: close 2060 2070 like anywhere the the
654.08s: higher it is the better it is then
656.16s: that's another
657.52s: Milestone uh in favor of gold just like
661.48s: you
662.56s: know pushing upwards what about the
665.52s: yearly I could even do a yearly chart
668.32s: for gold yeah look at that so on the
671.16s: yearly
675.08s: chart that's a Pole flag right Pole flag
680.28s: and that would be a continuation
682.52s: breakout right then you could start
683.92s: doing measured moves I don't know where
686.56s: maybe it starts
687.96s: here
690.08s: you'd add that here and then that would
691.72s: be your measured move yeah
693.92s: 2700 it looks great on on the yearly so
696.84s: there's a people have to match your time
698.88s: frames and you'll see here this is
700.92s: another
701.80s: thing the higher the time frame it's
704.48s: kind of fun that I I hope a lot of
705.76s: people get to watch this the higher the
707.48s: time frame the lower the threshold for a
712.64s: breakout because the time frame is
715.08s: higher there's more time for the Wicks
717.16s: to to to form the more more noise the
721.56s: the higher time frame candle so this is
723.68s: 12 months it's the whole year look at
725.92s: the breakout line here it's 1900 18897
730.32s: the the breakout line for this
732.24s: continuation it's much lower than on
737.40s: the where was I on the monthly on the
739.60s: monthly we had see here's the the the
743.08s: yearly one the monthly it was 1990 and
747.44s: even the daily
749.48s: it's probably even higher because the
750.80s: daily chart is there's a lot of closes
753.96s: on the daily chart which is actually the
756.24s: Wicks well it will be the Wix most of
758.60s: the a lot of the closes will be Wix from
761.40s: the higher time frames so let's I'm at
763.52s: the daily
764.84s: chart it's like there's no confirmed
767.44s: I'll put here on the line chart just to
769.00s: remove the
770.68s: noise look how much higher the price
773.24s: point you need on a daily close to break
775.88s: out so the higher the time frame so
778.92s: often I don't know like you know
780.32s: sometimes I have some teachers Eric at
781.56s: school there they they let when they
783.20s: explain something they put the pros and
784.56s: cons of each thing so yes oh that's a
786.96s: big tank it's strong it's powerful but
788.88s: on the downside it's slow you know it
790.64s: can't can't maneuver so the time frames
792.40s: is like that the hard time frames like
793.56s: the big tank the powerful once they get
795.96s: going you don't want the you want to buy
799.16s: the dips once you have a higher time
801.08s: frame confirmed breakout but the short
803.52s: time frame there's not even a confirmed
805.08s: breakout on the daily chart practically
806.84s: it's h you'd have to maybe draw a
809.80s: slanted one make a case but it's it's
811.76s: noisy you see even here you could have
813.60s: had a false breakout on the daily chart
815.24s: it failed but now because the monthly
818.04s: and the weekly broke out it's offering
820.24s: that longer term support to help the
822.32s: daily chart you know push
825.08s: upwards and um you're letting me rant
827.64s: too much
829.24s: Eric I like listening that's why I like
832.36s: doing these is I have an opportunity to
835.04s: learn uh with everybody else one of the
836.96s: questions I had though is early on
838.76s: you're talking about the relevancy of a
840.40s: close versus a wick can you talk more
843.00s: about that yes definitely
846.80s: so let's go back to the
851.40s: candles here I could even do I I have
854.32s: I'll do one better remove drawings I'll
855.96s: put a horizontal a vertical line at
859.84s: um three months okay when did this when
862.24s: did the year begin the year began
864.20s: January
867.04s: 1st let's do let's do it last year
869.60s: September October so September was the
871.52s: quarter quarter started September and
874.76s: here we are today
877.96s: right I'm on the daily chart so this is
880.44s: probably going to be here when this is
883.00s: September October November no the
885.64s: October starts right October
887.64s: 1st
890.48s: okay there's a whole bunch of closes
892.60s: here on the daily chart right and here
894.88s: you could say I have a
896.72s: breakout right here there's a Breakout
898.76s: out here then after that it tests some
900.96s: longer
903.04s: term price action here maybe if that's
906.88s: probably even a false breakout here on
908.32s: the daily chart if I stretch if I
909.92s: stretch that possibly a false breakout
911.84s: on the daily
913.64s: chart now the month started here the
917.96s: price went all the way up here kept
920.68s: going up so the the quarterly the
922.76s: quarterly the quarterly candle chart
925.92s: will start green at the bottom go up
929.12s: but because right now we're
931.80s: below the the beginning of the month or
935.80s: we're not at the high we're below the
937.16s: high of the month this will be a wick
939.44s: all that noise here is going to be a
941.56s: wick and the higher the price goes
943.76s: before we close the end of the month
946.28s: that noise int month will disappear and
949.16s: hopefully you get a marabu candle where
951.80s: it's the close the entry and the closer
955.80s: practically no Wick it's just power
957.32s: power no SS coming in
959.44s: I'll just put on the
961.84s: corly reset chart zoom in and you'll
965.72s: you'll see look at that so here here's a
967.36s: quarterly close it's beautiful here was
969.80s: October 1st well yeah it's it's going to
972.72s: be here when we we're done and now we
974.72s: have just that Wick here have to remove
976.36s: these lines that's the wick from the
977.80s: smaller time frames which needs doesn't
980.36s: need to disappear but that's that Spike
982.08s: we had intra month going there but right
984.68s: now that's noise and if ever the price
989.48s: goes back all the way back down to 1971
992.36s: then you don't even get that breakout
995.04s: there it's it's totally that corly
996.88s: defined breakout is not there anymore
998.48s: and it just it trapped anybody
1001.88s: who thought this would
1004.96s: close above that breakout line here for
1007.16s: the corle chart did I help I might have
1009.84s: confused things a little bit it's uh I
1012.80s: don't think so I think the way you
1014.32s: framed it is pretty clear in that you
1018.48s: view the Wix as shorter term noise and
1021.84s: the close is the more dominant feature
1024.08s: for you it's yes look another way to do
1027.04s: it guys if if you don't just put a line
1028.88s: chart just just put a line chart and
1031.52s: that's it there's no noise here it's you
1033.68s: get these are closes but yeah you have
1035.84s: to understand that there will be noise
1037.16s: from the smaller time frames and um yeah
1040.80s: you could do it at Old School just uh
1042.52s: just a line chart and that's fine I just
1044.76s: like knowing what's the beauty of being
1046.60s: on the monthly chart and having candles
1049.04s: is you're
1050.48s: able as a chart Trader once like you're
1052.92s: used to it you see the closes right you
1054.56s: I could practically visualize the line
1056.00s: chart there but I like knowing the Wicks
1059.20s: because the Wicks give you details from
1060.64s: the intro month right was it an
1062.28s: exhaustion Wick did some crazy action
1064.96s: happened during the month because that
1066.84s: that's another thing I put on Twitter is
1069.36s: I would always rather a month that
1072.44s: starts weak but closes strong it leaves
1075.48s: a wick here uh like um some type of
1078.40s: capitulation Wick you know it went super
1080.48s: weak here there's a wick the price goes
1082.56s: up it Clos strong I would always rather
1085.04s: that than a month that
1086.96s: starts strong and then closes weak and
1090.12s: then leaves like here like a huge like
1093.40s: the the whoever's like the hedge funds
1095.80s: like I don't know they especially the
1097.12s: quarterly chart you know they they
1098.92s: readjust rebalance ETFs they they they
1101.32s: don't they're not day Traders like huge
1103.44s: money those Capital flows they readjust
1105.08s: at the end of the month end of the
1106.08s: quarter stuff like that and they could
1107.88s: just like
1109.32s: bring the price down back below I don't
1111.80s: that of course I would always the best
1114.12s: case is a month that
1115.92s: starts strong and end strong right
1118.28s: everybody wants that but so that's why
1121.36s: I'm never I don't feel too much fomo
1123.44s: like intrance oh the daily chart Gold's
1125.72s: going crazy or any instrument there now
1127.56s: we're just picking on gold but those
1129.56s: Bonkers kind of scares me sometimes
1131.76s: because I say okay if the sellers come
1133.24s: in they could create some type of ugly
1135.52s: ugly candle because like back in March
1137.76s: of 202 to what do you think the feelings
1140.08s: was for everybody here like I could even
1142.76s: do a trick here for you I I put the fast
1145.04s: forward button I put play see ah it's
1149.04s: too fast I'll slow it
1151.64s: down it's any let me just back it
1158.36s: up it's replaying the month see during
1160.88s: the month I just put on pause during
1162.80s: intram month that candle look like that
1165.92s: how many people uh go the best H the
1169.32s: rest is the worst you know all the gold
1170.92s: bugs jumping up and up and down there
1172.64s: like everybody would must have been
1173.96s: crazy here but if you continue playing
1175.88s: it out oh the sellers came in at the
1178.56s: like and the the buyers weren't able to
1180.60s: bring it up then we get a new candle and
1183.72s: all hopes uh hopes and dreams got
1185.68s: shattered there like the the Boulevard
1187.48s: of Broken Dreams there it's
1191.12s: terrible what do you think about picking
1194.72s: the correct time frame to analyze
1197.28s: something how do you do that
1200.24s: the Holy Grail of time frames well the
1203.80s: first thing people have to match is the
1206.20s: time frame they have to match a time
1207.44s: frame with their emotional yeah a good
1210.44s: Trader has to understand his emotional
1212.60s: state of mind is he does a guy want to
1215.08s: be super active because if he's on the
1216.88s: monthly candle chart he's not he's gonna
1218.72s: he's gonna lose patience right you have
1221.36s: to match the time frame with your
1223.24s: emotional profile your emotional Capital
1225.24s: like are you going to want to check once
1227.12s: per month for Breakout
1228.84s: then if that's all you want to do then
1230.72s: you have to go to the monthly candle
1231.96s: because you'll get all the advantages of
1233.20s: the monthly candle with and the draw
1235.48s: Downs of over trading you don't care you
1237.24s: just want to trade once per month to
1239.16s: readjust uh your assets but if you're
1241.44s: somebody that wants to check every day
1243.84s: then maybe a daily chart could be good
1245.36s: for you but the advantage of the guy who
1247.16s: does it for the daily if he happens to
1251.68s: coincide his buying at the beginning of
1254.24s: a month then it's win-win for him
1256.56s: because he gets to leverage the higher
1257.76s: time frame
1259.44s: and he's still in his universe of the
1261.24s: daily chart look there's no I'll tell
1264.48s: you at the pros and cons longer the time
1267.32s: frame the lower the threshold to get in
1269.96s: but you have to wait way more before you
1272.48s: get to enter but it will create more
1274.48s: powerful moves um the dips will be
1277.40s: bought more often than
1280.08s: sold on the higher time frame you are in
1282.44s: the shorter time frame well you get to
1283.76s: participate more but you will get whip
1286.96s: sod so much
1288.72s: so uh it's it's it's it's crazy on the
1291.48s: daily chart there but it's funny you
1294.16s: bring that up because when I look at my
1296.80s: world which is primarily derivatives
1299.28s: it's the same thing like Traders like
1303.20s: trading shorter term time frames but
1305.48s: that's exactly what happens there as
1306.96s: well is they just get pieced up and then
1309.16s: they wonder what happened so it's just
1311.40s: funny to me to see completely disparate
1313.40s: styles of trading but some of the same
1315.44s: underlying tones one being extend your
1318.04s: your duration and you might find things
1320.60s: to work a little bit better for yourself
1322.96s: yes and it gives you time to breathe it
1324.48s: gives you like you get imagine if I told
1327.12s: Michael Jordan and he's in is in the
1328.80s: playoffs and the defenseman will give
1331.00s: him five 10 seconds extra for him to
1332.44s: take a shot he'd be okay it's perfect
1334.32s: you know but we're not all Michael
1336.12s: Jordans we can't always we don't have
1337.96s: this emotional capacity we can't be
1339.36s: rushed all the time with Twitter info
1341.48s: with fun and if people do fundamentals
1343.12s: on top and they're analyzing this and
1344.52s: move so fast goodness man that's it's
1347.64s: going to give me heart attack you know
1349.32s: so it's and you you you might make more
1351.52s: you might make mistakes you might make
1352.96s: operational mistakes just punching in
1355.36s: the order oh the sell stop you made a
1357.08s: mistake and then something gets
1359.00s: triggered um the markets are
1362.08s: volatile the you could get crazy
1364.20s: sell-offs like you had in FedEx could go
1365.84s: down 10% one day up 8% the other day and
1369.08s: then you're if you don't account for
1370.88s: like if you don't use like ATR or some
1373.28s: type of thing to help you like measure
1375.32s: the
1376.00s: volatility man the market
1379.00s: loves just grabbing you you know
1381.88s: grabbing those cell stops like I I don't
1383.52s: want to go in conspiracy theory but the
1385.92s: the Market's volatile enough to like if
1389.72s: you're too close to the action you you
1392.36s: you you're going to get you get
1393.92s: triggered out before your your profit
1395.44s: limits will get hit like practically a
1397.44s: lot of the times right it's uh yeah I
1400.00s: did it I used to do like a lot of Forex
1401.92s: I was on the shorter time frames playing
1403.56s: the the news releases economic news
1405.24s: releases it was like it
1406.88s: was
1410.40s: you know you have to adjust your style
1411.60s: the time frame to your style
1413.24s: and so that's probably number one look
1415.44s: in the mirror guys understand what type
1417.84s: of personality you have how much time
1419.28s: you have to allocate to this and then I
1422.76s: think your trading will get a lot better
1424.36s: once you match the time frame to your
1426.36s: emotional uh State of Mind makes a lot
1429.24s: of sense I think that applies to trading
1431.48s: RIT large so again that's another very
1433.40s: common theme I find even with
1436.56s: derivatives trading again again people
1439.40s: have to figure out if they are looking
1442.08s: for lower win rates but bigger wins that
1445.04s: necessitates a certain kind of strategy
1446.72s: the inverse necessitates a different
1448.84s: kind of strategy so just another
1450.88s: parallel it's funny because when you
1452.88s: talk to Traders there are commonalities
1455.20s: amongst all of us slightly differences
1458.08s: between what we might look at what we
1459.68s: might use but threads like that I find
1461.96s: to repeat themselves you talk a lot
1464.88s: about trading bullish directions do you
1468.16s: view bearish trades as well do you put
1470.44s: those on or not so
1472.48s: much well not so much look it let's say
1477.28s: somebody wants to short the SPX but if
1479.68s: you look over long long periods of time
1481.64s: let's let's pop up the SPX there the SPX
1484.32s: has everything going for it even the
1486.40s: NASDAQ let's think like it's an index
1489.00s: the 500 top companies it gets to rotate
1491.36s: out the least performing companies so
1493.44s: it's already that it's got 11 sectors so
1496.76s: the least performing SE sectors could
1498.24s: pick up the slack so when the the top
1500.96s: ones like don't don't really do that
1503.36s: that good you know so the draw Downs
1505.44s: there will be draw downs but it's got
1508.08s: It's like if I I have a 200-year chart
1510.28s: here's the SPX 1871
1513.16s: guys it's if you zoom out it had periods
1517.16s: of time where it went sideways for 10 15
1519.56s: years 10 years here 10 years here but
1522.24s: overall statistically it's more up than
1526.28s: down over long periods of time time
1528.08s: right so on that basis it's tough you
1530.72s: got to be really Nimble you really got
1532.96s: to understand the evidence so let's say
1534.24s: I want to short the SPX like uh let's
1536.84s: say the the GFC
1538.80s: well here it was a higher probably short
1541.24s: because it was SPX had already broken
1543.84s: down versus inflation or versus PPI
1546.16s: versus CPI versus gold so it was more
1549.12s: this at this stage here it was more
1551.36s: probable of failing this rally and
1552.96s: getting a rug pull so here you had I
1555.16s: would you could have probably shorted it
1556.36s: but it could have been Shadow like here
1558.48s: you know here even um SPX broke down
1560.88s: versus PPI back here but uh they're
1563.88s: they're tricky to short so I rather on
1566.84s: currency pairs I wouldn't I wouldn't
1568.32s: mind where it's a zero zero some game
1570.24s: like that like Direction there but when
1572.88s: I see a chart like that the SPX I would
1575.56s: rather wait until it's bullish and buy
1578.32s: the dips or instead of shorting the SPX
1581.80s: see what it's underperforming and go the
1584.24s: other asset that's going long that's
1586.72s: outperforming it so here is gold SPX
1589.28s: here breaking down versus gold in 2002
1592.56s: instead of shorting the SPX and because
1594.52s: of all the the reasons I mentioned there
1595.96s: it's like all the money is Flowing to
1597.32s: that always it's like it's a great Rush
1600.68s: right everybody like goes Bonkers oh the
1603.36s: the Dows down 800 points day after day
1605.36s: like it's crazy feeling right especially
1607.60s: if you have a little bit of contrarian
1608.88s: in you and you like you want the system
1610.52s: to break you kind of uh but it
1613.00s: statistically probably it doesn't happen
1616.04s: as much as people think it should happen
1618.12s: so if the SPX is breaking down versus
1621.48s: another asset class I would probably
1622.88s: look to go along the other asset class
1624.68s: which is outperforming it because I'll
1626.24s: show you something here here's
1628.36s: the here is gold versus SPX and I'll
1631.88s: just overlay the
1633.44s: SPX on top of it and I'll overlay also
1640.28s: gold and you'll see here that oh
1642.84s: goodness the scales got messed up you'll
1645.12s: see here that while the ratio of SP X
1647.80s: versus gold is just plummeting look at
1650.00s: this here from the 2003 bottom here's
1652.24s: gold 2003 SPX and gold go up together
1655.36s: but the ratio goes down one's
1657.52s: outperforming the other and that is good
1662.00s: because uh liquidity is going in the SPX
1664.56s: uh Gold's sensing or pricing in whatever
1667.12s: the monetary inbalances the destruction
1669.12s: of the Fiat required to save the the um
1672.44s: the SPX and then you get a double whammy
1675.76s: now gold appreciates price and gets the
1679.00s: the support that the SPX is getting on
1682.36s: the way back up until one day the SPX
1684.80s: breaks out versus
1686.20s: gold like in back here 2013 gold breaks
1690.24s: down and then just go long SPX so yeah I
1692.88s: would short stuff I would short more
1696.52s: let's say like
1698.40s: the anything that goes against like uh
1702.04s: against the stock market that probably
1704.12s: short that while the stock market's um
1707.12s: going hot than the sectors that are
1709.04s: doing so good uh probably like let's say
1711.36s: energy gold and silver miners like
1713.44s: they're just terrible like 90% of the
1715.32s: time it's kind of weird Eric I don't
1717.16s: know if you notice this but people are
1719.12s: attracted to what is statistically least
1722.16s: probable because they they have some
1724.48s: clickbait type of gain attached to it
1726.72s: it's like people want like want to play
1728.88s: the minors all the time but
1730.40s: statistically if you don't if you don't
1731.64s: have ta the time your entry in the
1734.04s: miners you have a higher likelihood of
1736.76s: just dollar cost aaging in losers for
1739.20s: long periods of time than actually
1741.44s: piling on into something that's actually
1743.68s: going up right it's it's
1746.52s: a yeah it's like
1748.84s: um the mindset of regular
1751.80s: people is not what a Trader's mindset
1754.44s: should be right a Traders it's like
1757.64s: either we learn because we we've we've
1760.04s: brought our narratives and biases to the
1761.84s: chart and then it has to go up because
1764.08s: they need solar panels so silver has to
1766.24s: go up but you're not looking at the
1767.92s: price then after losing so much money I
1770.64s: guess people learn either they learn to
1773.32s: accept that the market is always right
1774.68s: and we're always wrong because
1776.52s: I I definitely know that I don't know
1779.28s: anything seriously it's like whenever I
1781.52s: think I know something the market
1782.64s: humbles me says Patrick what are you
1784.64s: doing that's why I've learned to go back
1786.80s: in my shell and look at the chart
1789.76s: because the price is never wrong never
1792.16s: it's like I I tell people that it's like
1795.28s: you could have a story a fundamental
1796.88s: story the pnes whatever it like looks
1799.64s: great but the price you'll never make
1803.36s: money if the price is not going in your
1804.96s: favor Never No Matter What story you
1806.76s: have you know and that's another thing
1808.24s: that's dangerous is you have a story a
1810.88s: narrative the price goes up and you're
1813.44s: aligned with your narrative then you
1815.36s: believe your narrative is driving the
1816.80s: price and when the price starts
1818.00s: faltering you don't believe that the
1819.32s: market you don't understand and then you
1821.36s: think the price is going to go back up
1822.56s: it never does because the narrative
1824.20s: never changed right because you'll hear
1826.16s: Echo Chambers all the time about
1827.48s: narratives right Teslas uh EV the EV
1831.48s: craze you know it's always it piles on
1833.88s: right and you SE those news also you'll
1836.44s: seek you'll follow people who who who
1839.64s: will reinforce your bias right even as
1841.48s: the price is crumbling 10% 20% 50% and
1844.16s: you'll keep following these guys even
1845.68s: more it's uh It's Tricky I forgot I
1848.60s: think I went totally on the tangent
1850.00s: there but it's
1852.68s: um yeah shorting you could do it but a
1856.16s: zero sum game much easier the
1857.84s: probabilities but short shorting US
1860.52s: Stocks you got to be like a surgeon
1862.64s: precise and make sure you have the
1864.24s: weight of evidence that they're uh
1865.88s: they're really really in the bare Market
1867.84s: there yeah it makes sense especially for
1870.84s: the time frames that you're looking at I
1872.32s: kind of generally expected that answer
1874.68s: from um from your side you mentioned
1877.64s: earlier some different Candlestick
1879.48s: patterns I spent quite a bit of time
1882.64s: probably 10 years ago doing a lot of
1885.08s: analysis and just regression on the
1888.12s: accuracy and the efficacy of Candlestick
1890.24s: patterns what are your findings on the
1894.60s: highest efficacy Candlestick patterns
1899.24s: well let me just remove
1903.60s: that the most efficient it's it's it's
1906.52s: practically you have to think like in
1907.80s: the physics the slanted lines the more a
1911.08s: line is
1912.72s: slanted and I'm going to put
1915.32s: my angle thick line here here so here
1917.56s: you see the angle the more the angle no
1920.20s: matter what pattern you have whether
1921.56s: it's a bearish rising wedge or like you
1924.28s: know but this is not related to
1926.72s: specifically to candles uh did you mean
1929.36s: like uh dois uh reversals engulfing
1933.36s: candles and all the are did you mean
1935.76s: specifically the Japanese Candlestick
1938.16s: patterns or what I what I originally
1940.96s: meant was the candlesticks themselves
1942.92s: but I actually like this direction more
1945.32s: anyways because I'm more of
1947.64s: formation SL shape kind of Trader so
1951.48s: this is a perfectly fine Direction yeah
1954.44s: I don't I understand the Japanese
1956.76s: candles the patterns the dois the
1958.96s: spinning tops but I don't trade solely
1961.68s: by those I'm a classical ta guy first
1963.72s: and
1964.76s: foremost the
1966.96s: angle while a bearish descending wedge
1969.52s: maybe I didn't drop the target is
1972.04s: essentially this what I've what I've
1974.04s: seen and with the like we have um a
1976.40s: trade tracker with performance
1977.68s: dashboards this is what I call a one
1979.52s: star breakout these are low probability
1981.28s: trades these while the targets here they
1984.16s: don't often go there the first time and
1986.76s: that's often the bare Market rally here
1988.72s: that traps everybody everybody thinks oh
1990.96s: man it's breaking out but you're
1993.32s: breaking out of what you're breaking out
1994.72s: of a steep descending trend line so the
1998.76s: momentum is it's like you're you're
2001.08s: you're jumping downhill if you
2003.04s: jump if ever you want to get your foot
2005.68s: again before jumping again you might
2007.32s: even go lower so sometimes often you
2009.72s: here you have look even you have a re
2012.44s: goodness see the the retest while it
2014.84s: wasn't that it went low here much lower
2017.60s: than it went back all the way down here
2019.76s: maybe that's not a good example but this
2022.44s: uh I have to go on log chart that's why
2025.16s: that's why it looks
2027.28s: funny the steeper the
2030.12s: angle the least probable the price goes
2032.84s: in the in the vshape up after that here
2035.32s: you would have had the less steep angle
2037.40s: six degrees so this is what I call the
2040.00s: early breakout line a lot of the hard
2041.56s: work the basing is done by here it went
2043.92s: up now it created a swing um a pivot
2047.68s: swing High here and after that it did it
2050.20s: again again coiling
2052.72s: tight so the early breakout line is fine
2056.08s: but the best one is a horizontal plane a
2059.04s: horizontal plane has no more bearish
2063.00s: momentum right because you have to see
2064.60s: those trend lines or the steeper they
2066.56s: are the more bearish momentum there's
2068.32s: still a lot of selling pressure the base
2071.64s: the horizontal breakout line has it's a
2073.60s: flat plane there's zero momentum but
2075.96s: it's it's even more bullish because it
2077.40s: has zero momentum and if ever you get a
2080.24s: breakout you know that a zero momentum
2083.32s: but you're adding bullish momentum
2085.40s: because to break out of it that means
2086.96s: you're starting from below it and going
2088.48s: above and that's that's creating the
2091.28s: initial thrust of upwards momentum but
2094.68s: that upwards momentum is not fighting a
2096.88s: clining plane it's fighting a flat plane
2099.20s: so it has almost no more I don't know
2101.32s: what you want to call it type of uh
2102.92s: gravity or kinetic energy dragging it
2105.12s: down as much as it did back here right
2107.60s: so this these are very high probably
2110.36s: like this is the so much higher
2113.44s: probability the these these huge basing
2115.20s: patterns with flat planes that's what I
2117.40s: play and we've played all these that's
2119.04s: why we know statistically that these
2121.00s: practically uh either they don't work
2123.88s: out well could have happened here I'll
2125.88s: tell you one thing here and it it pra it
2128.24s: almost did back
2130.88s: in I have to cancel this thing here look
2134.60s: at
2135.44s: here look at the gold chart here it was
2138.96s: a breakdown here PE that if you buy here
2142.88s: on the those slanted planes the the more
2145.20s: slanted that could have just kept going
2147.00s: down was below the one year below the
2148.84s: threee like this could have happened
2151.16s: here like people don't think of that in
2153.12s: hindsight oh the gold price went up and
2154.88s: they forget that this was actually a
2156.40s: road MCH if you would have asked me back
2157.88s: in
2158.88s: 2018 to see that chart just like that
2161.60s: without other way of evidence I could I
2163.40s: would have told you my bias is neutral
2166.16s: bearish because what want me to tell you
2168.28s: there's a it's unless it's a false
2170.88s: breakdown and a reverse uh through the
2174.08s: like a reverse move upwards until that
2177.32s: happens this is what I have in front of
2179.52s: my eye I have to deal with this right so
2181.44s: you cannot belong here unless you're a
2183.36s: knife catcher if you want bragging
2185.56s: rights but I don't care like nobody
2187.00s: should be I'm never impressed with
2189.08s: somebody who tells me he bragged that he
2190.64s: bought the low it's like it's it's
2192.72s: nonsense I rather have the the low in
2195.84s: the rear view
2198.56s: mirror and the Market's telling me that
2200.92s: it's already trying to create upwards
2202.16s: momentum so that's a great example uh
2204.84s: same thing here look back in the low in
2206.76s: the Steep even if a crazy move upwards
2209.96s: you're still not of the park and over
2212.40s: time it creates oh look at that minus 8
2215.00s: degre instead of- 6 degre so lot less
2218.24s: downwards force and eventually you get a
2220.80s: horizontal
2221.96s: plane above a a wall here's a support
2225.16s: turn resistance was resistance here
2228.28s: sellers got in and that was look look
2231.40s: how well it held on the on the the
2233.04s: retrace I said like I think four times
2235.72s: out of five there's a there's a retrace
2237.68s: to the breakout line retrace and Bam you
2241.48s: buy that that was uh off it went right
2244.00s: so horizontal
2245.36s: planes are are any pattern that has a
2249.00s: horizontal plane in it that's why people
2250.88s: sometimes they said Head and Shoulders
2252.12s: well what do head and shoulders why are
2253.84s: they so powerful because the breakout is
2255.84s: a horizontal plane and I don't really
2258.48s: care about the the left shoulder but the
2261.28s: right shoulder will be well let's say
2263.40s: it's a head and shoulders bottom the
2264.60s: right shoulder would be a higher low
2266.60s: right so and higher lows what is that
2269.12s: that's the beginning of an uptrend right
2271.08s: all upwards Trend have higher lows and
2273.80s: eventually once you're above the
2276.00s: horizontal PL plane that means it
2277.64s: confirms that you also have a higher
2279.40s: high so now you have you have a channel
2281.28s: you have higher lows and the horizontal
2284.16s: plane confirms that you have a higher
2285.52s: High and um that that's bullish evidence
2289.56s: it's a bullish momentum it's an uptrend
2292.64s: it's all the characteristics of a of a
2295.72s: higher probably
2298.04s: trade how well does this kind of thing
2300.84s: apply to various time
2303.72s: frames well it's like Inception the
2306.00s: movie
2307.12s: this everything I described here applies
2309.16s: to any single time frame so the time
2311.60s: frame is the the multiplier of the pros
2314.36s: and cons of that so I could have zoomed
2316.04s: in this pattern here this fractal here
2318.80s: probably appears 100 times on the hourly
2321.40s: chart you you could probably see these
2323.16s: like all the time there I even did one
2325.32s: recently on
2326.76s: Twitter let me just zoom in I did the
2328.96s: gold
2330.08s: to I did silver but here's silver to SPX
2334.88s: I'll just go in here on the 1 hour chart
2337.96s: res that chart view look at that it's
2339.64s: like let's say I would hide I would hide
2341.60s: here the the time frame it's the same
2343.80s: same concept here I have a
2346.64s: descending 44 degree it's that you see
2349.80s: that that breakout here it's not the one
2352.16s: that brought it back to to the top right
2354.00s: then after that you had a slightly sless
2356.92s: steep oh okay cool the Market's it's
2359.68s: creating a Swing Swing highs and then
2361.60s: after
2362.88s: that then after that you have a
2364.76s: horizontal plane then and each time
2367.16s: these horizontal planes
2369.56s: are you have to always look to the left
2372.52s: as far as you can to see
2374.76s: meaning so that's the same thing I'm on
2378.04s: the one hour chart if I go on the
2379.76s: monthly you sign on the monthly right
2381.40s: this this thing
2383.32s: do it's it's nothing on the monthly
2385.56s: right reset chart look it's uh these are
2388.08s: all my lines I could practically not see
2389.68s: it but so it goes with the pros and cons
2391.68s: of that time frame right
2394.16s: um that let's say you have a bullet
2396.44s: bullish pattern on the 1 hour chart but
2398.52s: if you don't zoom out to the higher time
2399.92s: frame that bullish pattern might get a
2401.96s: rug pull because you might be hitting
2404.64s: monthly defined resistance might be
2406.48s: hitting a 12- month average going
2408.88s: downwards so if you ever you want to
2411.04s: play a shorter term time frame bullish
2413.40s: setup make sure the time frames below it
2416.28s: or above it the 4 Hour 8 Hour the 12
2418.92s: hour the daily you're not going to hit
2421.92s: any resistance and you're actually in an
2423.36s: uptrend in those because if you're in a
2425.32s: higher time frame to uptrend there's
2428.04s: more chances that Capital flows go in
2430.04s: and saves your butt from that instead of
2431.60s: me having a false breakdown on that one
2433.32s: hour chart I have more chances if
2435.56s: there's just influx of money coming in
2437.32s: and oh I reached my target so it's all
2440.08s: about probabilities right so you could
2441.72s: zoom on time frame but always be aware
2444.68s: of um the entire ecosystem of time
2447.44s: frames that are out there yeah makes
2449.80s: total sense it's one of the things I
2452.60s: look at a lot most of my trades are
2454.56s: shorter duration than year plus but I
2458.04s: actually talk about a lot of the the
2460.52s: very same things so again I can't help
2462.92s: just find it funny that different styles
2465.48s: of trading but very similar things that
2469.08s: that you're covering here which is
2470.64s: pretty interesting to me when you look
2473.80s: at these different ratio charts I
2476.24s: remember the first time I talked to you
2477.64s: I thought that was pretty neat that you
2479.20s: looked at a lot of these different kind
2480.48s: of ratio charts we're looking at one now
2483.16s: what's the the thought process behind
2485.20s: those and if somebody was new to them
2488.68s: how should they dip their toe into using
2492.72s: them okay so if I would do racial charge
2496.08s: like essentially people are looking at
2497.44s: racial charge they don't even know it
2498.88s: because any instrument it's it's a it's
2502.00s: a one unit let's say I go to Amazon
2504.52s: before that's a racial chart it's one
2507.20s: share of Amazon divided by the
2509.44s: numerators Amazon and the the den no the
2512.64s: and the denominator is one unit of US
2516.04s: dollar right or it cost so yeah so it's
2519.44s: the unit so here I need 250 or wherever
2522.24s: the price is today I need 153 units of
2525.92s: US dollar to purchase one share of
2527.48s: Amazon that's a ratio so by using ratios
2530.36s: other than Fiat because Fiat has been
2532.04s: the the there's a destruction of
2534.24s: purchasing power of the Fiat that's been
2536.24s: going on forever so
2538.24s: us
2542.08s: purchasing
2543.84s: purchasing just to prease this
2547.32s: this this is your purchasing power guys
2549.16s: since
2551.12s: 1913 so unless we go into Great
2553.40s: Depression for anybody that's just
2555.24s: listening in it's essentially a
2557.96s: completely negative sloping line the
2560.20s: best way I describe it yeah unless we
2562.56s: have a they destroy money unless they
2565.12s: they they we have a huge deflation and
2567.88s: the actual remaining US dollars are able
2570.96s: to purchase more units of more shares
2573.28s: Etc it's it's we've been destroying
2575.56s: purchasing power forever right like it's
2577.44s: a running gag everybody knows it we have
2579.12s: analogies a cart of milk ask your
2581.16s: grandfather I love like you know when I
2583.20s: was young I didn't understand there but
2585.88s: when you see a chart like that it's just
2587.60s: goes down so yes Amazon's going up but
2591.00s: the unit you're measuring it with might
2593.36s: be go Amazon shares might be going up
2595.88s: because the units you're measuring it
2597.44s: comparing it to are uh going down you
2600.36s: know so are you really making money or
2603.72s: you just it's just because the unit is
2606.16s: losing value so if you go back
2608.36s: to SPX divided by so if you want to do
2612.08s: racial charts the first the easiest one
2614.04s: to do guys whatever you want to buy
2616.24s: price it in Gold I even have here an
2618.72s: indicator here where I have by
2621.92s: default whatever instrument I have let's
2624.40s: say
2625.64s: um let's go let's go pick on the Russell
2628.60s: here you always want to outperform so
2632.36s: here I have a ratio of the Russell
2634.60s: versus gold so that's what it looks like
2636.16s: like the ratio chart versus gold here's
2638.24s: a ra the Russell versus SPX so that's
2641.76s: what the racial chart of SPX of Russell
2645.24s: is worth
2646.40s: versus so you want to compare with major
2649.52s: asset classes you want to if you're the
2652.44s: Russell or any instrument if you're not
2654.72s: outperforming the SPX you have to ask
2656.56s: yourself why am I why am I long this
2658.88s: this company there Netflix or whatever
2660.36s: I'm not even outperforming the index and
2662.64s: if you're not outperforming gold the uh
2666.36s: another different asset manager class
2668.60s: because I've shown you
2670.12s: where where there's secular bull markets
2672.96s: in US growth stocks there's often a bare
2676.28s: Market with gold with commodities Etc
2679.32s: and when Commodities are in Bull eras
2681.80s: then there's often a stagnation period
2684.72s: with possible rug pulls in US growth
2687.32s: stocks so you want to be outperforming
2690.24s: SPX and outperforming gold to have in
2694.52s: your head you should always imagine what
2695.96s: what's my percentages of headwinds
2697.52s: versus my percentages of Tail wins I
2699.08s: have in my trade to have a successful
2700.48s: trade so Russell right now while it's
2702.88s: going up nominally it's underperforming
2705.16s: thex and it's still underperforming gold
2707.76s: it doesn't have all the the Tail wins it
2710.76s: needs to really be in the sustained
2712.64s: uptrend so that's a lower probability
2714.92s: play I could pop in uh let's say I put
2717.92s: in um quick segue I trade a lot of iwm
2722.36s: so I have to Grace the iwm gods with a
2725.36s: compliment because we're talking a lot
2726.80s: of about iwm right now and I don't
2729.72s: need them pissed off at me so iwm you're
2732.84s: looking great out there anyways back to
2735.77s: [Laughter]
2737.64s: you
2739.36s: well nor could do great and like you
2742.20s: told me like if you're on the shorter
2744.00s: time frame it's like that movie The Ant
2745.88s: you could tell me Patrick I don't care
2747.24s: about the higher time frames hey I'm on
2749.04s: the 15sec candle Patrick and you're
2751.40s: right sometimes you're so small that it
2754.20s: practically doesn't matter what H is
2756.32s: happening the storm out there right it's
2757.96s: like you're at the atomic Atomic level
2760.08s: and I'm Outdoors you know playing so
2762.96s: I've had that thought like if the guy
2764.32s: really Zooms in like on it might he
2766.96s: might get in and out of his trade
2769.08s: and he's oblivious to what's happening
2771.48s: on the Outer Outer Realms right so that
2774.36s: is a distinct possibility that the the
2778.24s: gods of the the Russell might still be
2780.24s: happy with you if you're trading on a
2781.28s: short time frame it could it could still
2782.84s: look great well I mean realistically I'm
2785.24s: going to lose in it anyways I just don't
2787.84s: need more stacked against me so I'm
2790.24s: just trying to make sure I give them a
2792.04s: goat sacrifice later today to get back
2794.68s: into their good graces I do that also I
2796.96s: used to do that when I used to play
2798.12s: poker I always sacrifice Two Goats
2800.12s: before I go on the poker online always
2802.76s: it never quite worked out for me though
2805.12s: I know it's not working at all but I'm
2806.92s: running out of
2809.00s: goats oh my goodness well like Wells
2811.88s: Fargo another example versus gold look
2815.16s: it's looking like like it's uh trying to
2817.28s: wake up and uh versus
2820.56s: PX what do you make of oil oh goodness
2828.28s: oil oh man let a reset chart view oh man
2831.60s: that Wick kills me they really kill me
2833.28s: with that that negative Wick
2835.40s: there oil oil is
2840.16s: in it's really it's like hanging on it's
2843.24s: like it went up super strong you could
2844.68s: still consider cons consider this a
2846.52s: longer term back test from this the peak
2849.64s: in 2008 One Touch two three four here
2853.28s: was Messi broke out retest so this is a
2855.64s: clear valid breakout but again it's not
2857.92s: a horizontal you know like we just
2860.56s: talked about there the final final
2861.92s: breakout is probably going to be here if
2864.48s: ever oil is able to close above 115 then
2868.68s: it's going to be probably Bonkers so for
2870.52s: me right now it's in a back test
2872.00s: configuration but it's mixed signals
2873.56s: because it's below the threee it's below
2875.52s: the one year moving average it's above
2877.72s: the cloud it's above right here there's
2881.12s: some um it's like a pivot line
2883.48s: resistance support support resistance
2886.00s: support support it's look I'll zoom in
2888.80s: here it's it's in survival mode right
2891.32s: now it's like it's above
2894.24s: support but you really
2896.52s: want you can it's hard to have a
2898.40s: position here because you want it to at
2900.40s: least clear clear clear this line here
2903.20s: and even this line it's provisionary
2905.16s: because it only has two two
2907.52s: bounces for line to morph into existence
2910.28s: you need three reactions so we might
2912.24s: have what small reaction here to confirm
2916.32s: that line exists and then we probably
2917.88s: have a move a reverse symmetry move back
2919.68s: to 115 that would probably be the play
2921.92s: eventually there from 81 to
2924.80s: 115 uh but it's got a that line this has
2929.24s: to support this Confluence here of of
2932.52s: support all this all this this has to
2935.36s: hold here and there's a lot of volume
2937.24s: base like huge volume defin base right
2939.24s: here right below but you want that 70 to
2942.96s: hold goodness man it's like
2946.56s: um yeah that's how I I see oil right now
2949.88s: but there's there's some good signs
2951.44s: because some of the tankers they do
2952.92s: they're doing great so if you look at
2954.96s: other other
2957.28s: instruments like
2959.08s: Frontline look there's some the oil
2961.20s: shippers have been doing great like for
2962.48s: a long time this thing's paying 17%
2964.52s: dividends like we've been in this thing
2966.68s: for a while and these the the the oil
2968.76s: tankers have been in uptrends for for a
2970.40s: while right so there's some bullish
2973.72s: signs in the for oil that what we're
2977.04s: living through right now is simply a
2980.24s: more back test of that breakout line and
2982.04s: the markets are pricing in ahead of time
2984.80s: a rebound in oil um because yeah the oil
2989.28s: plays are they're not that bad the oil
2991.52s: plays there how do you view looking at
2995.00s: subsidi varies of broader Commodities
2998.24s: like this cuz that's actually an
2999.48s: interesting angle that you're bringing
3001.16s: up and I'm curious how that broadly
3002.80s: applies so in this case we're looking at
3004.28s: an oil tanker in relation to oil that
3007.36s: apply across sectors across Commodities
3010.00s: to you always always and if you want
3013.04s: people know the next step for racial
3014.40s: charts is the same thing so let's say I
3016.20s: would take um let's say oil was breaking
3019.64s: out okay fine oil's breaking out then is
3022.04s: oil breaking out versus um xop the let's
3025.24s: say sector of the ETF M you you would
3028.76s: want the sector to be outperforming oil
3031.44s: in the in the in the bull era and
3033.72s: look look at this man this actually oil
3036.32s: has broken down
3038.80s: versus xop which is bullish for the
3041.64s: sector so even if the oil price is has
3044.48s: Consolidated and retesting that 70 70
3047.00s: level
3048.68s: the the oil
3050.88s: plays have actually are outperforming I
3053.84s: could have actually done um maybe
3055.72s: visually it's going to be easier if I do
3058.60s: xop divided
3062.52s: by
3068.08s: oil goodness that n cloud is so
3073.20s: messy probably have to zoom in sometimes
3075.52s: to remove noise I go on the corly for
3077.96s: the oil chart to remove that Wick see
3080.00s: that crazy Wick how it didn't because
3082.36s: the price didn't last long
3084.36s: there
3087.36s: so yeah they're above the that's a
3090.64s: threeyear moving average and that's the
3092.28s: nine-year because I'm on the higher time
3095.04s: frames so it's looking not bad here so
3097.96s: the that looks like
3099.16s: a Pole
3102.12s: flag expanding wedge here oh
3107.56s: goodness so that's a good sign yes so
3109.88s: you could use it like that if the
3111.72s: underlying leverage plays to the
3114.52s: commodity or performing the commodity
3116.48s: that's Full Throttle for the bull era
3118.72s: because often it's the top layer commod
3121.48s: that has to fight versus SPX has to
3123.72s: fight versus um gold but once the major
3127.92s: commodity has a capital flows then after
3130.48s: that the the metrics look so much better
3133.56s: for for the the the companies right that
3135.64s: are dependent on the price of that
3137.20s: commodity either going up or well going
3139.72s: up right they want that commodity price
3141.12s: to go up so this is very bullish
3143.20s: actually there I haven't looked at that
3144.40s: thanks I'm going to have to dive that
3145.64s: one because I haven't looked at the uh
3147.16s: xop by oil price recently I kept looking
3149.56s: at xop versus SPX which is a baseline
3153.64s: but this is a yeah this a good sign
3156.04s: there interesting I think what's even
3158.80s: more interesting is that you said you
3160.04s: had a nine-year moving average which I
3162.44s: can unequivocally say I've never had one
3165.00s: of those on my chart are they fun to
3166.76s: watch I imagine they're boring as
3169.16s: yeah too long n nine years look nine
3171.76s: years it's a when when I do the big
3174.00s: picture seven years years eight years
3175.96s: moving average just just a really really
3177.96s: longterm moving average there but uh to
3181.32s: trade what you could you could do is you
3185.00s: could have that moving average it's fine
3187.00s: understanding where it is it's great
3188.44s: because let's say here I'll put instead
3190.00s: of my 12- month moving average I'll put
3191.68s: the uh the niney year which will be or
3195.00s: eight year even seven years long I'll
3197.44s: put seven
3199.28s: year understanding where you are you see
3202.00s: here when you had the breakout in June
3203.72s: of 2019 you were right above the sevene
3207.16s: which is great and look see how you got
3208.80s: stretched away from the sevene here was
3210.52s: a
3211.24s: pullback you don't want to still you
3213.32s: don't want to be too stretched from any
3215.00s: type of moving average because the more
3216.20s: stretched you
3217.28s: are the more you're at risk of
3220.64s: exhaustion right the you want coiled and
3223.72s: tight here's the here it is the
3225.36s: seven-year and the threee coiled and
3227.40s: tight that's where the price the market
3231.64s: is okay I don't know where to go anymore
3233.16s: and once it takes a direction then it
3235.40s: allows for Price expansion right because
3237.64s: the further you are from a moving
3239.12s: average the more fomo there is the more
3242.28s: people are making money the more they're
3243.72s: talking about they're making money the
3245.16s: more people at the water cooler are
3247.56s: buying but once everybody's bought and
3250.08s: you're super stretched from the moving
3251.28s: average then naturally there's only one
3254.04s: place could go you have to let the
3255.24s: moving average catch up either via a
3257.68s: violent bare Market or a sideways move
3260.68s: where you could let those moving
3261.68s: averages catch up and replenish let the
3265.84s: the ones who got in low let them exit
3267.88s: let them take profits get out of the
3269.88s: game and then after that let new people
3271.84s: come in to buy but you don't want to be
3274.12s: too stretched from the uh any moving
3275.88s: average right the best is when the seven
3278.20s: year three year one year one month all
3280.44s: those moving averages are well here I
3282.64s: have a here I have a setup here called
3284.08s: the heat
3285.96s: map I had the seven month all the way to
3289.40s: the the five day moving average and
3292.00s: you'll see that often the best moves
3294.76s: look at that it looks like a rainbow
3296.08s: you've seen these rainbow type of
3297.44s: indicators well here June of 2019 you
3301.20s: have the shortest of time frames plus
3303.84s: the 700 day moving average which is not
3306.40s: that bad a year and a half coiled and
3308.32s: tight coiled and tight man he got to get
3312.44s: people have to focus on Quil and tight
3314.28s: not ex let's say you tell me about hey
3317.48s: Patrick uh I think Gold's a buy
3319.96s: everybody's talking about it the next
3321.24s: thing Peter shiff says it's going to
3322.64s: 5,000 well I would look at off if
3325.36s: somebody tells me or somebody from my
3327.24s: family tells me to buy something often
3329.88s: I'll look at the price chart and I'll
3331.36s: have something like this where the price
3333.24s: is is getting so stretched from the
3334.96s: longer term moving averages where it's
3337.52s: it's just it's just asking for for a
3340.24s: pullback just like here look at that
3341.96s: look at the beautiful pullback that GFC
3343.80s: here was getting stretched from the
3345.32s: moving average either consolidate
3346.68s: sideways here but it could also come and
3350.00s: did a severe retest of the 700 moving
3352.00s: average look at here goodness look how
3355.04s: tight and quill that was goodness so
3357.60s: that these are the
3359.04s: setups the G like the setups that don't
3361.32s: happen often here and here it's we've
3363.76s: had it just again this is just a coiling
3366.04s: and tightening pattern and if it starts
3368.60s: moving up the further you are away the
3372.72s: the more the move has been
3377.84s: engaged I couldn't agree with you more
3380.88s: on the tight I think everything's better
3383.00s: tight real big fan of tight So for
3386.80s: anybody listening I feel like if you
3389.00s: needed a solid moniker to get better at
3392.32s: understanding moving averages that's the
3393.92s: real I think that really sticks through
3396.52s: for me is the tight just like a nice
3399.84s: bench press got a solid tight elbows for
3403.44s: that drive hell yeah oh man well yeah
3409.20s: yeah I'm G to get in trouble so I'm
3410.60s: gonna usually I get in trouble but uh I
3413.48s: so hard not to do that joke I've been
3414.88s: watching the office recently and that's
3417.04s: what she said jokes they're just the
3418.56s: best man it's like they just before the
3420.80s: woke culture came in you could see the
3423.28s: woke getting in towards the end of the
3424.88s: office there in 2008 or whatever year
3427.32s: like oh no maybe later there but the
3429.32s: beginning of the years it was like just
3431.56s: hilarious it was boners that show I love
3433.88s: it well and that's exactly the setup for
3436.80s: that joke I was just doing anyways right
3439.00s: obviously I'm talking about other stuff
3440.92s: but I transfer it to make everybody feel
3443.48s: like they're creeps by talking
3445.08s: about a sick bench press which is also
3447.40s: great if you have some tight elbows and
3448.92s: a good bench press
3451.48s: but well I'm sure we made a lot of
3453.44s: people laugh and good for them if they
3455.16s: they caught on there I love it yeah yeah
3457.56s: good um a couple other questions I had
3459.84s: for you is looking back at 2023 what
3463.64s: stood out to you so if you are a
3467.24s: relatively new Trader you're building
3469.08s: your technical analysis understanding
3471.96s: and awareness what are some things that
3474.36s: you saw this past year that you think
3477.00s: would be good for them to take a look at
3479.24s: as a reference point as a data piece
3482.20s: that they can integrate into their
3483.76s: broader technical understanding oh
3486.44s: goodness
3487.56s: well I think it'd be racial charts
3490.84s: understanding if you should trust or not
3493.56s: a is it a bare Market Rally or not
3496.44s: because sometimes even if like we did
3497.80s: the Russell chart even if phenomenally
3500.04s: I'll do it I'll do I'll do it again for
3501.76s: the Russell I'm going to anger the
3503.40s: Russell the the Russell God going to say
3505.16s: as long as long as we're not talking
3506.32s:  about the Russell we're good if not
3508.00s: I'm going to have to start lining up
3509.20s: more goats
3510.92s: man so look here here's the Russell I'm
3514.80s: sorry I like picking on the Russell
3516.76s: because it's the weakest of the um the
3518.84s: Russell actually is the it looks exactly
3521.88s: like the inflation adjusted version of
3523.96s: the do Jones or the SPX the Russell is
3526.64s: like a play on the capacity of the major
3530.28s: indices to outperform inflation but in
3534.72s: in any case here's the Russell so
3537.04s: 2023 we're right here so while we know
3539.68s: the Russell is is uh driving upwards or
3542.44s: trying to it's it's it's still hasn't
3545.16s: broken out versus gold so it doesn't
3546.76s: have the headwinds the Tailwinds that it
3548.52s: needs to be successful so that's I would
3552.28s: always look at racial charts if you're
3553.76s: outperforming a competitive asset class
3556.08s: so let's say NASDAQ is probably
3558.04s: outperforming gold in
3560.68s: 2023 hasn't broken out yet but it had
3564.24s: tell wins more than had more T wins than
3567.28s: head wins uh going into 2023 oh my
3570.68s: goodness no in 2023 it hadn't broken
3572.88s: that it broke down in
3576.84s: 2022 yeah 2023 was starting
3580.44s: to let me just put my black line
3585.56s: here yeah so that was a positive here so
3588.00s: somebody would have looked at the racial
3589.60s: chart of NASDAQ versus gold as it was
3592.12s: bouncing above the cloud here
3595.16s: but goodness it's not it's not the best
3598.28s: of scenarios here it's like it's
3600.88s: still goodness the way you still
3604.72s: want remember like I said this those
3606.92s: steep lines off there sometimes you have
3609.64s: a rally you have to wait until the dust
3611.36s: settles I'm really curious to see how
3612.92s: that's going to end the month because
3615.12s: what I'm
3617.12s: expecting I want to I want to see if
3619.92s: we're gonna get some type of more
3621.40s: coiling tightness and that's probably
3625.40s: a play i' I'd be more interested in
3627.36s: playing here something really I can't
3630.92s: even say the word anymore but it is what
3632.60s: it is it's tight and coiled above the
3634.44s: moving averages so I don't want the
3636.64s: NASDAQ to break out here in Gold Bonkers
3638.48s: because it's it's not creating the
3639.96s: optimal ort for me I I would rather
3642.68s: it have something like something like
3645.40s: this here where it's really creating a
3647.96s: strong base where I could have a crazy
3649.52s: move up here with less chances of rug
3652.52s: pulls but uh yeah look early we're going
3655.80s: to know soon there because here we had
3657.92s: here here it did it pretty violently
3660.48s: there yeah that was going to be my next
3662.92s: question is when there's so many I don't
3665.24s: want to call them artificial factors
3666.80s: because they're all Market factors but I
3668.96s: look at Big Daddy JP interest rate
3671.44s: scenario and how much that affected
3673.88s: markets how does having again I don't
3676.92s: know what to frame them I've always used
3678.24s: them as artificial inputs because the
3680.12s: market might want and be do whatever it
3681.72s: wants to do but it has this constraint
3684.68s: does that factor into these kinds of
3686.84s: setups for you like does it have to be
3688.72s: quite as coiled and tight for you to
3690.56s: respect it as much or if that broader
3694.04s: macroeconomic picture is changing which
3696.52s: would ultimately impact stuff like this
3699.56s: does that give you a little bit more
3701.36s: leeway with the setups that you would
3704.88s: accept the the
3706.80s: macro as a pure pure chart Trader the
3709.64s: answer is the macro all macro known
3712.20s: elements are are in the chart right
3714.72s: there so if if if the some crazy macro
3717.24s: thing
3719.56s: happens the the market is going to price
3721.64s: it appropriately if I don't get the
3723.36s: pattern the tight Quil pattern that I
3725.88s: want to play then I I might not play it
3728.76s: so whatever the reasons are so let's say
3731.72s: because I it's hard to tell like can
3733.52s: somebody let give you an example because
3735.80s: yeah there there's a specific scenario
3737.28s: I'm thinking about so right now we have
3739.84s: a it's not it like what we see right now
3743.64s: isn't quite as Consolidated as you would
3746.08s: like it to see let's say in the next
3748.76s: week Powell came out for whatever reason
3751.56s: and he says I'm going to cut rates and
3753.72s: then all of a sudden that starts to fly
3755.44s: off the handle does that lack of basing
3760.56s: still impact your decision cycle against
3763.48s: that to your point new macroeconomic
3765.92s: injection of information that then might
3767.84s: change the landscape I'm curious how you
3770.52s: view the basing patterns just so you
3772.36s: understand the meta portion of the
3774.04s: question
3774.42s: [Music]
3776.04s: well my assumption is that all the
3778.80s: aggregate of Market participants are
3780.76s: going to price in the probabilities of
3782.52s: Powell doing whatever he's going to do
3785.08s: and a lot of people managing way more
3787.04s: money than me are going to place their
3789.24s: bets right according to well even the
3791.64s: FED fund Futures right people know
3793.36s: actually like if when he's going to cut
3795.08s: or there's Pro odds of you know having
3797.04s: Cuts all that stuff all the mechanics
3799.68s: it's like I clear my mind of that and I
3802.52s: just say the the aggregate Market
3804.80s: participants of will be the price chart
3809.04s: so I that that macro element I kind of
3812.40s: dismiss it I'll say look I'll let the
3813.84s: market participants figure it out if I
3816.00s: don't get the setup that I would relish
3819.04s: like something like this and I'll just
3821.32s: move on to another instrument where I
3822.76s: can and that's another thing sometimes
3824.08s: on Twitter I get people well Patrick you
3827.16s: you you're not playing Bitcoin whatever
3829.24s: well I tell look I I don't have the
3831.12s: setup where I know I have higher
3833.00s: probabilities of getting my target if I
3835.32s: don't have the setup I'm looking for
3837.52s: even if the price goes up tenfold if it
3839.84s: just rocketed tfold and I couldn't get
3843.24s: in because I couldn't anchor cell stop
3845.52s: appropriately I couldn't get my risk
3847.00s: reward uh three four to one whatever I'm
3849.88s: seeking I'm just not going to play
3851.56s: there's so many instruments like I'm not
3853.48s: attached to bitcoin I'm not attached to
3854.96s: NASDAQ I'm not attached to any single
3856.88s: instrument if there's a chart with
3858.64s: enough
3859.48s: liquidity in a sector that's breaking
3861.52s: out versus the other asset classes has
3863.80s: that P that coil like like I'll put PBR
3867.64s: here here's another one maybe look at
3870.60s: that that's that's an oil play that
3872.12s: thing gives you 18%
3875.00s: dividends I I've been we've been eyeing
3877.20s: this thing for a while now because look
3879.72s: it's it's doing the Quil look at that
3881.20s: thing like that's ready to it hasn't
3884.00s: broken out yet but that thing is a
3887.68s: candidate like a 10y year 13 what is
3891.16s: that 10y year base man I I rather play
3895.12s: that than play NASDAQ Going Bonkers off
3898.28s: a pattern where I can't anchor my stops
3900.36s: or like it doesn't matter like I'm happy
3902.88s: for you NASDAQ people who ever played it
3905.36s: may I probably have to go on the shorter
3906.72s: time frames to play NASDAQ I probably
3908.48s: get my coiled and tight on the weekly or
3910.72s: maybe on the daily I could probably pay
3912.40s: it but on the monthly on that chart it's
3914.88s: going to be difficult but uh this is
3916.96s: what I'm seeking there these uh these
3918.72s: crazy crazy patterns and they're all
3920.24s: over the place you just have to uh do
3922.68s: the work you know in the look for them
3925.56s: yeah that and that answers the question
3927.68s: perfectly it makes a ton of sense so you
3929.80s: definitely have a clear preference for
3931.48s: your setup and if there's a specific
3934.48s: Catalyst that causes a movement but your
3936.64s: setup still isn't fully formed you seem
3939.08s: to prefer looking for an alternative
3941.88s: that has the setup that you're looking
3943.36s: for yes yes I dig it yeah and it's funny
3947.68s: you say that about the like the federal
3949.28s: funds rate probabilities and whatnot
3950.96s: because I typically agree with you I
3952.84s: think the markets are much smarter than
3955.32s: I am but the obviously the injection of
3958.64s: new information drastically changes
3961.44s: probabilities of things that's why I'm
3962.76s: always curious how that fits into your
3964.52s: bigger probabilistic outcome CU like if
3966.12s: you look at the probability of a cut a
3968.76s: month ago it was like 29% whereas if you
3971.20s: look at it now it's like 82% for the
3973.52s: March meeting which is that much wow I
3977.16s: even it's well that's the beauty of
3979.80s: charts
3981.00s: because I don't have to look at
3982.80s: everything I have the that there's
3984.92s: 10,000 analysts on the planet that are
3987.72s: reporting to their to their Jamie
3989.80s: diamonds of these worlds they're doing
3991.76s: the work for me they're spending hours
3994.32s: and hours crunching all that data for me
3996.00s: and doing recommendations and they're
3997.44s: buying and they're doing the work work
3999.00s: for me I I could I used to go look at
4001.16s: the FED fund rates I used to actually do
4002.68s: Ta on the chart of the FED fund rates
4004.88s: changing and if I would see a breakout
4006.48s: in the probabilities I would apply that
4008.92s: the same logic oh I have a breakout so I
4012.12s: would go for it before there was
4013.52s: actually the cut let's say it was at 20
4015.44s: 20 20% and then it goes to 40 but I had
4018.12s: a clear breakdown line or breakout line
4020.48s: I said man we it's it's gonna happen
4022.76s: there's a high probably chance that we
4024.04s: will cut and I get ahead of the curve
4025.88s: and play that but I haven't done that in
4027.96s: a while right now like I'm focusing all
4030.96s: that stuff there are the probabilities
4032.36s: of everything it's like sometimes it's
4034.96s: like I feel like I've done the I've done
4037.52s: the down too much it's like can it be
4040.00s: that simple like I'm I'm letting
4041.92s: everybody else do the hard work I'm just
4044.36s: focusing on finding the the the end
4047.44s: setup they're focusing on getting the
4049.72s: higher probability plays pure like just
4052.60s: on the charts there yeah I think it's a
4056.08s: a bit of a balance I think we all go
4057.64s: through that phase I was actually
4059.56s: checking out your website just to get
4061.28s: reacquainted with you guys a little bit
4062.76s: more and I saw you essentially started
4064.12s: trading right when I did in 2007 so
4067.40s: looking over that time frame I have done
4070.80s: a very similar process where things got
4073.56s: very busy a lot of noise a lot of stuff
4076.96s: and then I look at what I do now and a
4079.16s: lot of it is very basic in its structure
4081.80s: so I really believe a lot in Leonardo da
4084.60s: Vinci's concept of like you
4087.16s: know Simplicity is the ultimate form of
4090.52s: sophistication I think said that he did
4093.56s: and it's one of the best things that we
4095.16s: talk about in the Marine Corps as well
4096.88s: which is brilliant at the basics if we
4099.36s: have dudes that can do all sorts of
4101.12s: really cool Maneuvers but they can't
4102.76s:  reload their rifle
4104.40s: that's useless to me so we need to be
4106.52s: really good at the basic things and it's
4108.76s: really impressive actually like the
4111.20s: outcomes you can produce if you're
4113.16s: really really really structurally sound
4115.72s: at the basic stuff so Patrick it's a
4118.96s: blast chatting with you man like I I I
4120.96s: really have an opportunity to learn a
4122.68s: lot that's one of my favorite things
4123.92s: about doing the podcast is I get a
4125.36s: chance to really peer into other
4127.64s: perspectives and one of the goals is to
4129.80s: just promulgate these different
4131.92s: approaches to markets so thanks for for
4134.12s: hopping on and spending some time
4136.00s: chatting with us quick question for you
4138.36s: I will throw links to your Twitter and
4140.36s: your website in the notes below but is
4142.76s: there anywhere else that people can get
4144.64s: a hold of you that you want to direct
4145.80s: them to no that's great we have a
4148.20s: YouTube channel also uh people could uh
4150.76s: could go check out there Northstar bad
4153.64s: charts and uh yeah know it it's fun Eric
4156.28s: there maybe we could host you there on
4157.84s: our show there whenever you're you're
4159.60s: available there that could be fun also
4160.96s: there yeah it would be absolute blast
4162.92s: and I can bring the goats so that we can
4164.92s: get the iwm Gods on our favor and I will
4167.52s: be ready to talk about coiled and tight
4169.64s: as much as you are so whenever you
4172.20s: whenever you're ready to rock and roll I
4173.68s: am let's do it man all right Eric all
