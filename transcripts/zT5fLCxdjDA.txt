0.00s: What up, outliers.
1.64s: We are back in the studio.
4.00s: That's really just an office.
5.00s: This is not a studio.
6.00s: Let's not church this up.
7.00s: It's just a standing desk.
8.36s: But we're back and I'm stoked.
10.56s: We have a lot to look at today.
11.80s: I want to go through the market with you all.
14.24s: Take a look at some options.
15.64s: See what's going on out there.
16.80s: I do want to highlight this new addition to the art collection.
21.08s: This is a piece of scrimshaughts like 2000 year old wall wrist tusk that they chisel
28.08s: into.
29.08s: I can show you a close up of it.
31.44s: Super, super cool.
32.44s: But that goes pretty well with the old mammoth tusk.
35.44s: So apparently your boy just likes old stuff because that is slowly what is being accumulated
41.54s: behind me.
42.54s: All right, let's get into it.
44.36s: First, you know, I will share another piece of the trip.
50.04s: This was a helicopter tour, a book for us of Bear Glacier that actually included a
56.08s: landing.
57.08s: This was a private tour, which is pretty cool.
58.88s: We had a chance to go check out the glaciers in a different kind of way.
62.76s: So I'll let's play for you.
63.76s: It's like 15 seconds.
79.92s: So essentially we do some laps around up on the glacier here.
85.20s: And then you can actually see where the glacier is feeding into this lake.
88.16s: I've learned that it's called calving where the glacier breaks off and falls in to make
93.32s: those big ice cubes.
94.32s: I got a bunch of pictures of those and drone footage down there.
97.44s: That's really, really cool.
98.44s: And then we ended up flying down this way.
101.04s: And then we've landed the helicopter somewhere over here kind of on the bank.
105.00s: I had a chance to fly the drone a little bit, you know, check out the glaciers a little
108.40s: closer.
109.40s: Overall fantastic experience.
111.00s: I show you guys this stuff because for me, this is this is literally all part of the
115.12s: power through training.
116.84s: None of this was even on my radar for the vast majority of my life.
122.96s: And the funny thing about this helicopter tour is we didn't even really book it ahead
127.00s: of time.
128.00s: We were just figuring out what we were going to do that day based on some last minute
131.24s: change of plans and we're like, this looks cool.
134.20s: And the ability to just go book this because it looked cool is something I never would
139.48s: have expected.
140.48s: And I think it's really cool.
142.04s: So while I actually think I probably spend more time beating you over the head with
147.80s: the difficulties of trading, this is the cool part.
152.36s: And this is what I try to remind people is that for me, trading is interesting.
157.04s: The markets are interesting.
158.48s: However, the real enjoyment again for me is outside of markets when I can withdraw my
163.68s: money and go do stuff like that with it, which is really neat.
167.20s: So I like sharing that with you all to kind of balance out the doom and gloom side of things
171.64s: because I am quite a bit of a realist and trading is hard work.
175.32s: But there are really cool benefits to it once it's figured out.
180.36s: So that's that.
181.36s: All right.
182.36s: Now for those interested, when I get the drone video I'll put up, I can share a Google
186.44s: Drive link for those that want to check that out.
188.24s: I did one for Iceland, which is really, really fun.
190.20s: I don't think I posted the Norway one, which is also really cool.
193.76s: Maybe I'll get that up for you guys if you're interested.
197.08s: The drone stuff is just kind of neat.
198.52s: It's a cool way to experience the area and in a slightly different way.
203.80s: All right.
204.12s: So what's going on this week?
206.64s: Let's start with some general outlook information so that you all have an idea of what to
215.64s: expect.
216.64s: We'll go to the events.
219.16s: And let's get this set up to this week and take a look through.
223.76s: I haven't looked at this yet.
224.88s: So I am getting caught up real time with you.
227.88s: All this will be a chance for us to see kind of what's going on together.
231.80s: So when I look at the 12th, I see, oh, peck, I see inflation expectations, which that
238.32s: metric I am interested in.
240.28s: And here we go.
241.28s: This is really where things are going to start getting spicy.
244.84s: Is this block here on the 13th and the 14th PPI CPI month over month, year over year?
250.56s: It feels like these metrics just keep on coming out, but they do.
254.08s: And they're super important.
255.52s: Right now the market is at, in my opinion, such a delicate balance.
261.56s: The fact that when we take a look at, let's go into the flexible grid.
266.12s: Let's take a look at this.
267.40s: The fact that when I look at this and I see how the market sold off in here is extremely
276.08s: telling to me, extremely telling to me, I'm zooming it into three months and switching
280.12s: over to the regular indices.
281.68s: So it's not blocked out by noise.
282.96s: Although the feats are up just a little bit right now with VIX down about 1.74%.
289.68s: So I'm coming down a little bit.
291.12s: VIX coins down two and three quarters percent, pretty significant actually.
295.68s: So anyways, sidetrack aside, this is interesting to me.
300.04s: The fact that the market sold off this heavy and then had this kind of rebound.
304.28s: So let's talk about that.
306.04s: When I see the market get to these nosebleed levels, I expect to sell off sooner or later
310.08s: just normalization of price, taking profits like all of that is so normal.
314.68s: Then the market needs to fall enough to get to a point where people are interested in
318.96s: transacting again, buying.
321.44s: And that started happening here.
323.44s: You can see this volume notice really, really deep actually.
327.12s: And then it fell off a cliff.
328.96s: This downside move was pretty severe.
331.48s: And this was driven by a bunch of different things.
333.96s: The bank in Japan, they had that unexpected rate cut, or I'm sorry, rate high, you cannot
338.48s: cut wrong way.
340.24s: Those kinds of things really start to shake things up against the broader perspective
345.08s: of what's going on on the US side of things, which is we're still in inflationary period.
352.60s: Inflation is still elevated.
354.08s: We still have high rates.
355.68s: We still haven't seen a cut.
357.56s: And things are starting to show cracks.
360.92s: We're seeing unemployment numbers coming in, not in line with expectations.
364.56s: We're seeing different economic efficiency indicators and just overall production indicators
369.76s: not coming in line with expectations, really causing people to take pause and say, okay,
375.32s: this actually looks kind of not good.
377.44s: Now we finish this sell off.
380.44s: We get a low of 510 after literally two days before we're hanging around like 550.
387.40s: And then it starts rowing all the way back up to 532.
390.20s: This was looking at spy.
391.52s: So why am I going into all this preamble?
393.72s: It's because I think this is showing you how delicate the market is and just how much
401.24s: this kind of information can have an outsized impact on what the price looks like in the
408.20s: short term.
409.20s: And I emphasize that short term component because I am generally a permable and I think in
415.44s: the long run, the US economy is going to continue to grow, expand, innovate.
419.52s: And I'm just very bullish on the American economy.
423.08s: Until I see evidence that leads me otherwise, but up until this point, even during the darkest
427.40s: of times we've seen the US economy pull through.
430.36s: So I do believe it's extremely resilient.
433.88s: That doesn't mean in the short term, I can't look pretty nasty.
437.48s: And I think that that's quite likely.
440.40s: The reason why I think that's quite likely is we have to also take a look at the divergence
444.88s: now between spy and the Russell, meaning small cap stocks.
449.36s: Take a look at small cap stocks here.
451.40s: They recovered as well, but this small cap move does not look like what you see over
457.04s: here in the large caps.
458.96s: And that's an important note.
461.20s: So to me, it still looks like small caps are under a bit of pressure.
464.96s: They essentially gave up everything that gave us.
467.72s: This was actually really interesting series of trades for me because I played the majority
472.48s: of this run up via ratio called Agnoles and I got chopped up in here.
476.24s: I got stopped out a few times.
478.00s: I tried to reenter, got stopped out because I thought we were getting closer to the ultimate
483.72s: move that I expect occurring and then it did not occur just yet at least.
489.80s: And well, I guess it kind of did and then it undid itself, I should say because this
493.44s: is a massive move.
494.44s: This is one of the largest moves the Russell has seen in this reference time frame, but
498.32s: then it gave it all up.
499.84s: And if you take a look, essentially it fell pre up move levels.
504.68s: So I still view small caps as kind of the Canary in the coal mine.
509.12s: And if we can't see small caps in a healthy place operating well, that tells me a lot
514.28s: about the broader economy.
515.92s: Now notice if you were called during some of the update videos I did while I was on my
520.08s: trip, I was really keying in on how these different days mirrored one another across the
527.12s: indices.
528.12s: They look so similar.
529.12s: Right.
530.12s: But the fifth, if you look at spy cues or I W M, it looks so similar in terms of the
536.40s: price performance.
537.40s: Then if you look at this, the sixth, very similar seventh, so on, eighth, so on.
542.68s: And then the ninth, what happens on the ninth divergence?
545.96s: We see S and P cues move in line.
550.24s: Very similar.
551.24s: We see Russell term tail start rotating over when everything else is going up.
556.08s: So I key into that stuff pretty carefully because in my opinion, we're at a point in
561.00s: the market where you really have to pay attention because it is so easy to get caught off sides
567.68s: in this kind of market because of how visceral it's moving.
573.00s: And when I'm again, I'm talking about these kinds of moves, the fact that over a series
577.60s: of relatively known goods, right, there was not a bunch of shocks that came out here.
584.28s: But it is starting to flag the conversation of recession.
588.88s: And again, I'm not here to try and scare people or make people feel good.
594.00s: I try to look at things objectively.
596.56s: And it's very clear to me, at least, that we are not out of the woods yet that the probability
602.12s: of a recession in my opinion is actually expanding the longer that this goes as it is.
608.08s: And we see that starting to come into light here where if we take a look at the Fed watch
613.76s: tool and we take a look, let's look at the comparison and we take a look at 18 set.
620.72s: Notice we're at 100% probability of an ease.
623.68s: That's already a change from a month ago where there was a 7% probability of no change,
628.68s: not massive, but still enough that it's worth noting.
631.92s: This is really what's different.
633.76s: The probability of a larger cut is expanding pretty meaningfully.
639.04s: Now this just waffled back.
641.72s: This was a much weighted probability of a 50 basis point cut.
648.68s: Now it's looking like a quarter point, which again, it's just kind of interesting to see
656.08s: with where we're at now and how this is starting to line up.
660.20s: I think most people are of the opinion that the Fed is late and it's really easy to cast
666.92s: stones and throw at the Fed.
668.96s: But when I'm looking at the bond markets, I'm looking at just the way that the market
673.52s: is doing.
674.52s: I'm looking at earnings, which is highly, highly informative.
677.32s: And you'll notice that from the newsletter this this past week, enter past weekend,
681.64s: literally today.
683.56s: If you'll notice in the newsletter, there's really strong performance on a relative
689.08s: basis for S&P 500 companies, big companies.
692.68s: They're doing okay and they tend to do okay in these kinds of markets.
697.00s: But again, this is why it's so important to have a slightly diversified view of markets
703.68s: and include things that also flash us some different perspectives.
709.12s: A.K.A.
710.12s: The Russell really helps with that quite a lot.
713.20s: So if we take a look at Russell year to date, I mean, we're essentially hanging right
719.92s: around.
720.92s: We're like within five, six points of where we opened on the year, which is crazy.
724.44s: This essentially hasn't moved.
726.24s: So all of this is to summarize.
729.48s: I think we are at a capitulation point.
733.60s: I think that the market is going to be heavily, heavily sensitive to information coming out
739.12s: like this, PPI, CPI, month of or month of year over year.
742.64s: I think those data points are really, really important.
745.36s: I also think jobless claims, really big deal, retail sales, really, really big deal.
751.56s: All of these standard inflation slash economy metrics that we've been using as a proxy
758.76s: are now I think under a microscope.
762.48s: Because again, I direct you to this kind of movement, we are at a point where this thing
766.32s: can move pretty meaningfully in either direction.
769.84s: Now one thing I will say is I don't necessarily see this same downside profile from here.
778.40s: The main reason is because we've already had a decent size sell off from being up at
784.32s: five, 65 now down to five 30 in the S&P 500 specifically in spy.
790.20s: So this drop can be a little more aggressive when you're at what I would call nose bleeds
794.76s: highs, like really, really high on a relative basis near term highs.
798.92s: But you can see that we're falling into these value areas where people really were stepping
802.84s: into buy.
803.84s: So if I move my head out of your way and you look at this giant down day here, look at
809.00s: the buyers that stepped in.
810.80s: We had massive, massive overall volume show up here, which was people just saying, okay,
817.60s: yeah, sell off got it.
819.32s: But I really like this here long term.
821.32s: That's mostly the positioning that you see there.
823.04s: This is not retail traders.
824.92s: I mean, of course, retail traders are mixed into this, but retail traders are not moving
829.44s: our volume from an average of 57.6 million shares a day to 146 million shares per day.
836.52s: That is institution stepping in big time.
839.56s: So they're kind of showing their hands a little bit.
842.48s: Now does this mean that I think that we're a parabolic up from here?
845.40s: Probably not.
846.40s: Not unless we get really good information.
848.12s: And I think it is going to be news dependent at this point.
850.80s: I don't think that this is just kind of standard good earnings stock market moves up.
855.92s: I think we are now heavily dependent on these other metrics.
859.24s: So a lot of general and slurry background information based on how I'm viewing the market.
864.44s: I wanted to share with you all because I do think that there's a lot going on right
867.60s: now.
868.60s: And I think it's really important for us to have a pretty good sense of what's happening,
873.36s: how to position in light of this.
874.72s: I'm going to go over this really far in detail later today with the outlier pro members
879.12s: because I need to position my portfolio.
881.56s: I'm just getting back from my trip.
883.04s: I need to get risk back out there working.
886.52s: Not necessarily jumping out to throw a bunch of money in the market here.
890.80s: I really need to get into the weeds on where my capital is going to be used.
895.96s: And I need to get really specific because I'm at a great point on the year.
900.08s: I'm well ahead of my annual benchmark.
902.96s: But the other part of trading is not giving your gains up,
907.28s: which I made a video not too long ago talking about some really prolific traders
912.40s: that were able to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars.
915.20s: But they weren't able to keep it.
916.84s: That's the other part of trading is not just making the money.
920.64s: It's keeping the money and both are difficult in the process.
924.92s: So that's that.
926.92s: Now let's take a quick look at upcoming earnings because there are still things coming out.
932.40s: We are definitely tail half of this.
934.84s: So we have like 15 ish percent of S&P 500 companies left to go.
939.56s: This is not limited to S&P 500 companies by the way.
942.12s: This is looking at things with weekly options.
944.12s: That's my general screener.
946.40s: And we have a bunch of names coming up Friday super quiet with absolutely nothing that interests
952.12s: me.
953.12s: But on Monday, we have a few things that you can look at.
956.36s: R-I-L-Y-S-P-W-R.
958.64s: Those are typically okay.
960.88s: It's difficult to trade them, but I don't dislike those.
964.84s: I do like HD.
966.16s: I do like Hut.
967.84s: I do like NU.
969.04s: I like SE.
970.44s: Now these are not like in terms of the company to the upside.
973.40s: It's just like trading earnings in here.
975.16s: I'll have to get a little more specific by looking at them and at their individual profiles
979.68s: to see what they look like to me.
982.52s: But these are the names at least that I'm short listening to look at.
985.76s: C-A-H-W-K-H-S-A-S-T-S-S-S-S-S-Go, Stone, all of those essentially are on play.
992.52s: Boba, John Deere, for sure, JD, no problem.
997.32s: Walmart, a matte for sure.
999.60s: So yeah, there's a handful of names in here that still look really, really interesting
1003.56s: to me.
1004.56s: But I'm not at the point where I'm going to be forcing anything.
1007.28s: What I can say is that a lot of the previous names I've been trading, this has been a really
1012.52s: productive earnings cycle that's been really kind of more in line with general expectations.
1018.84s: We went through a couple quarters not too long ago or just seemed like everything I was
1022.40s: trading was going way off into this new unfounded territory.
1026.48s: But it seems like we're getting back into standardized profiles.
1030.00s: That's what's earnings are looking like to me coming up this week.
1035.12s: Now, I did get a couple questions about a few other names.
1040.28s: One of them was a question about, let me grab it specifically.
1046.96s: We were looking at SoFi.
1050.52s: So let's take a look at SoFi quickly.
1052.92s: This is for Oscar from the Discord.
1056.00s: And he's asking about a ratio called Agnol, which this is a no go for me.
1059.36s: It's literally as simple as it's going down.
1062.48s: So yeah, I mean, there's essentially absolutely no, no other work required for me here.
1070.32s: Like it's in a downtrend.
1071.72s: Again, does that mean that it can't go up?
1073.48s: Does that mean that this down move was overdone and it can't go up from 664 to 733?
1077.96s: No, it can.
1078.96s: Well, one, that's a tiny move that I'm not interested in.
1081.80s: And two, again, it just has the broader wind in its face, not at its back.
1087.08s: Like this does not look very interesting to me to the upside.
1090.24s: Again, totally can go up.
1091.84s: I wouldn't surprise me if we saw some sort of return to value up towards this point of
1095.96s: control to be completely honest.
1097.84s: But the other assessment I have to make is based on this movement, it looks like it's
1101.64s: building a floor and somewhere around here, like 628, 632 ish.
1106.24s: So the downside is generally limited.
1108.36s: But the upside target that I would have would be somewhere right around this point of control,
1112.12s: which essentially going from 664 to 730 is just not an interesting move to me.
1117.40s: I would want to see something that offers more movement than that.
1121.36s: So yeah, I don't like it for a ratio called diagonal personally.
1125.12s: That would be a absolute pass.
1128.36s: The other question we got from the discord is from Rath asking about the VIX.
1133.36s: And we're, they're asking a lot of altilities been pulled out of the market with no new
1137.88s: money flow coming in.
1139.68s: Could that suggest that we're starting to lean more bearish?
1143.64s: Sort of, it absolutely could.
1145.52s: But I mean, the VIX itself is also coming down.
1149.20s: Right?
1150.20s: The VIX is not at this crazy high elevated level anymore.
1155.40s: It's kind of at a, what I consider to be a generally sad level for where I would love
1160.60s: to see it.
1161.76s: We zoom this out.
1162.76s: Let's do like a five year daily.
1164.76s: I mean, even at this generally elevated level in terms of this recent timeframe,
1169.04s: which has been obscenely low, it's really not that high.
1173.92s: So I'm not sure that I think much about actually that money flow argument.
1181.40s: I again would argue kind of the opposite.
1184.44s: So if we go back to spy, take a look at the volume on this day.
1190.44s: Again, this is that day I was showing you where it had massive, massive overall volume,
1195.20s: 146 million volume.
1197.52s: And I'm highlighting the tip of that volume node for you guys in this little tiny graph.
1201.88s: You're looking back five years.
1203.76s: This was higher volume with 51% of that volume being by volume.
1209.80s: And you don't really see that volume until you get back over here, which was another
1213.64s: dip that was heavily bought.
1215.80s: So I'm not really convinced on the money flow thing.
1219.68s: It really, if you're using like a money flow index, depending on what kind of oscillator
1223.32s: you use, it's going to look at this differently.
1225.76s: But I'm just looking at the gross movement of shares.
1228.40s: And there was a lot that were bought here.
1230.64s: So yeah, there's that to me.
1232.92s: I don't actually think that we have a bunch of money rotating out.
1236.12s: It does look like there's profit taking.
1237.88s: There was money rotating out here.
1239.60s: No doubt about it.
1241.00s: But then we had some serious buying going on.
1243.28s: It's serious buying going on on the eighth and also on the ninth.
1246.88s: So on the on the eighth, it was 93% by volume.
1251.00s: And on the ninth, it was 74% by volume.
1253.84s: And still on the eighth, it was above the 20 day average for volume.
1259.24s: So yeah, I mean, overall still really aggressive positioning.
1263.56s: The other question we got is about our fan favorite game stop.
1268.64s: And the main reason I want to look at this is because we are coming up at least on the
1273.16s: next exciting week, which is an expiration week.
1276.08s: It's 16 aug.
1278.04s: I was talking with Newton a little bit.
1279.76s: I actually need to chat with him a little bit more.
1282.28s: He's not feeling well.
1283.28s: So make sure you send your wishes that it feels better.
1286.00s: Feel better, my boy.
1287.84s: But I do want to understand a little bit based on his assessments of this next cycle.
1294.76s: What he thought was going to happen.
1296.08s: I think he felt that the eighth was supposed to be a pretty big day.
1299.84s: I have to be honest.
1300.84s: I haven't caught up on his videos.
1302.16s: He talked about this already.
1303.84s: But I mean, there was a move to his credit.
1306.60s: It just isn't really much.
1308.96s: And I think there's a lot going on here.
1311.00s: Game stop still is part of small caps, which are not doing really that great.
1315.84s: There, well, small bit cap, but they're just in a tough spot.
1319.84s: I would argue.
1321.32s: And the broad market is not offering this a massive back slash tailwind.
1328.84s: It does look like we're starting to create a little bit of a new base here, which is
1333.20s: really good to see.
1334.72s: You can see where I was originally expecting it to go.
1337.32s: Like I talked about before, people were actually really upset at me that I even talked about
1341.04s: it going to like 18, which I again, I'm just looking at it as objectively as I can.
1346.72s: I know people love the company.
1347.72s: I know people wanted to go up.
1348.84s: I want it to go up.
1349.84s: I have shares in it.
1351.24s: But I still do my best to look at things objectively, regardless of what I want it to
1355.32s: do or not and just look at what it might be likely to do.
1359.00s: And again, not exactly to where I thought it was going to go here.
1363.44s: Hit a low of 1873.
1365.44s: So I was about a dollar off.
1368.52s: But this made sense to me because we came down into another value area that people became
1373.32s: interested.
1374.32s: But here's one of the problems I'm finding is this.
1377.44s: I'll get myself out of the way.
1379.68s: And you can see that volume is just anemic.
1384.24s: Volume is so light.
1385.72s: It's so low, even relative to its 20 day average, 20 day average is about 12 million shares.
1391.96s: And what you're seeing is half of that on most of these days or even less.
1396.60s: So volume is pretty light.
1400.00s: And I think that's an important note because it's just kind of like a slow period for the
1404.72s: stock as I see it.
1406.28s: Now it does have oscillators starting to come online.
1408.84s: So the CCI is starting to turn positive.
1411.08s: Again, I'll get myself out of your way.
1412.96s: But it's still not where I would consider to be in bi-territory just yet to the upside.
1417.68s: But this is something that if it continues to hold, it becomes more appealing for me
1422.60s: from an options perspective.
1424.20s: But it's just not doing what I would need it to do.
1428.08s: So I'm looking at 640,000 calls against 334,000 puts.
1434.00s: So still calls you still a little bit lighter than what it typically would be for a really
1438.76s: bullish configuration.
1440.20s: But this is still noteworthy.
1442.88s: I don't want to diminish the fact that it's almost two to one here.
1447.60s: That's pretty meaningful.
1449.64s: But when we see GameStop in like a really bullish configuration, it'd be like really, really
1455.00s: high.
1456.24s: So I'm not necessarily seeing that.
1458.44s: Now when I look at this coming expiration cycle, we do have a pretty stacked options chain.
1464.56s: Now the 24 and a half are really light.
1466.76s: But other than that.
1468.04s: I mean, we have 6,000, 6,000, 4,000, 23,000.
1472.68s: And then it gets light out here to the 30s.
1475.36s: Does this look like a giant gamma ramp to me?
1478.32s: Honestly, no.
1479.68s: It would probably need quite a bit more density here.
1483.72s: But it could be if there is a lot more activity, but it just seems like it would probably
1487.96s: be fairly quiet as far as I can tell.
1491.24s: Now the other thing I wanted to touch on quickly was chewy.
1493.60s: I had a couple questions on this.
1495.56s: And one thing I did look up is for the 13G that Roy and Kitty filed.
1500.32s: If he wanted to trade, if we, you know, are postulating whether he's in or out, he would
1506.24s: have to file an amendment to the 13G if his position fell below the reporting threshold.
1512.56s: So we know at least up until now that the position is still on to some degree.
1518.80s: And we still don't fully know if he's using options or shares.
1522.60s: It seems like shares is my best guess.
1525.44s: But we just can generally postulate that he's still in it.
1530.08s: Now whenever the transaction happens, I think there's a 10 day window or so.
1533.72s: You guys probably know that a little better than me.
1535.28s: I don't want to give you bad information this way.
1537.60s: I think it is about a 10 day window from the day that the change happens.
1541.92s: So it could have happened eight days ago.
1545.24s: And then we wouldn't know until the filing if you waited the full 10 day period in order
1550.48s: to file it.
1552.16s: But it does look like he's still there.
1553.72s: The reason why that matters is because there is a reality where Roy and Kitty is a catalyst.
1559.12s: It's crazy to say that that an individual trader is a catalyst, but he is.
1563.40s: And what he doesn't game stop does serve as a catalyst for movement.
1567.48s: I still don't necessarily think that he's pivoted away.
1570.16s: It doesn't seem like he's turned his back on the stock at all.
1572.12s: I guess he's just kind of exploring the space.
1574.16s: He's looking around the dance floor and he's playing things as he sees it.
1579.12s: It seems like based on all of his social media history and everything he's done previously,
1584.44s: it doesn't seem like he's fully pivoted.
1586.72s: At least I wouldn't think that to be the case until I saw something definitive, meaning
1592.12s: something directly from him.
1593.96s: But until then, to me, it just looks like he's kind of playing opportunities as he can
1597.48s: find it, which makes again, from a trading perspective, it makes a lot of sense.
1601.08s: And it looks like he's trying to play a lot of structural behavior.
1604.32s: There was some interesting call activity that we reviewed already in Chui.
1609.00s: And what that means for Chui, we don't know yet.
1612.52s: But to me, it looks like it's starting to run right up against near term resistance,
1617.76s: which would be right about there.
1619.32s: And the reason why I say that is because it's right on this next volume node, the next
1623.52s: resistance would be down a little bit further.
1625.48s: It would be like right here off of this volume node there.
1630.88s: So it's 24 handle looks like the next general area of congestion that it's going to be bumping
1635.76s: up into.
1636.76s: So we'll see how it runs from there.
1638.44s: But this is kind of in a different configuration, right?
1640.60s: It's above the point of control.
1641.84s: It still has volume coming in that's generally long volume.
1646.32s: So if we look at the eighth, it was 99% by volume.
1649.44s: It's a lot of by volume, which is generally interesting to me.
1653.88s: When we look at the options chain, I see 256,000 calls against 1.4,000 puts.
1660.84s: So way, way less variance between call put, ally, and their calls are kind of all over
1669.20s: the place, right?
1670.20s: You can tell by all these different colors, which represent these different explorations.
1673.32s: It's kind of a mixed bag as far as I see it.
1676.44s: So we're going to keep an eye on it.
1677.72s: The other thing to note though is that earnings is coming up.
1679.92s: And that was my best guess for that trade that I saw on chewy because it was four right
1683.72s: after earnings, if I'm not mistaken.
1685.84s: So to me, again, it makes total sense if you want to trade earnings in chewy to build
1691.84s: a position that essentially expires right after it's on the 28th and it's before the market.
1700.00s: So you can gain exposure right around this earnings release.
1704.80s: And that seems to be what that position was, but we'll find out soon enough.
1709.16s: So quick kick off to the start of the week.
1712.16s: We have a bunch of stuff to look at.
1713.92s: All of the live streams are back online.
1716.48s: I'm going to keep up with Newton to see if we're going to do the GME live stream on Saturday.
1720.88s: If we are not, I might shift it again to Thursday and just do another solo one where I kind
1725.64s: of flounder around by myself with the help of you all to help me figure out what I should
1730.32s: be looking at and continue learning.
1732.72s: But yeah, I'm still talking about Newton.
1734.52s: We'll figure out when we're going to connect again.
1736.48s: Hopefully he feels better.
1737.80s: But if you guys need anything, he's always let me know.
1739.68s: Be an outlier.
1740.68s: See you guys later.
