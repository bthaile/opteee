 What's up everyone? Taking a look at GameStop today. There was a pretty interesting trade that I want to go over with you as well as an update on the options chain because I do see a shift going on. And then I also want to address some comments yesterday from the chewy video where people were seeing interesting activity in those options chains. I actually collated data from the entire month for us to take a look through together in a spreadsheet. The overall goal here is to share information stuff that you guys can learn how to analyze things a little bit better, maybe structure trades a little bit smarter, which we'll talk about that as well. So let's dig right in. First things first, I think we need a poor one out a moment of silence for all of our homies out here at the 128 call. 67,348 expired worthless. Difficult trade. Super far out of the money, very low probability trade. This goes back to something I talked about most of the week as I saw people piling into these very low probability trade. So I know a lot of people are looking kind of for those lotto style plays. That's a tough way to make money in this business long term, which is what I'm concerned with. I've been doing this for over 16 years now. Consistency and making money long term is important. Now I understand every once in a while you might want to take a shot to see if you can hit one out of the park. So that's kind of the concept of the video I've been citing and I'll link it below again about buying options smarter. There's nothing wrong with taking a shot looking for a lower probability higher payout trade kind of asymmetric profile. But if that's the only thing you're doing, it's very difficult to make money. So what happened today? Well, a few things. One of them that was very interesting was this trade right here at 0744 Pacific time for today's expiration. Somebody transacted 496 of the 11 calls. This is an interesting trade because it landed towards the center of the bit asked spread a little bit closer though to the ask. So I'm thinking that these are buys not just for that reason, but also on the dynamic of the transaction. What does that mean? Well, if you're selling options and let's say he has the shares and he wants to sell the calls against the shares, typically you want to do that to capture some time value. There's essentially none of that left in here. There's so far in the money with zero DTEs. So I don't think that they're trying to do that. I think that this was a method to buy shares. That's my best guess. They pay a little bit of a premium to do it via options, but they have the benefit of getting it at a certain strike. They don't have to fight the market trying to fill a position of the size because this is a pretty big trade. The premium of the position is over $700,000 by itself. These are very, very deep in the money. So that's my best guess. This was somebody looking to enter in via shares. So we'll have to see how this one goes because it wouldn't surprise me to see a pretty decent flood then of short calls of people trying to capitalize and capture the elevated volatility as much as there is left. And this is a pretty sizable position to do so. This is again, 496 contracts, each worth 100 shares. That's my guess. And if we take a look again at the options chain, the vast majority of the volume at the strike is that person. It's not like they got in, got out. My guess is they were looking to onboard shares. So interesting trade though. Not anything else in here that stuck out too much. It did look like aggregate buying activity though. And it's essentially across expiration cycles, but as you will typically note, the lion's share of it is going to be in the standard expiration cycles. So if you'll take a look at the 19 July, the larger value trades that were bought there, vastly larger than everything else except this one today, occurred here. And I've explained that before. It's essentially for liquidity. You're going to get way more liquidity going to a standard expiration cycle as compared to the weeklies. So it's very, very common to see that movement. Now if we take a look down here at open interest, there's about a million calls to 575,000 puts. And if we see where those are centralized, it's in this front expiration with 350,000 calls and 130,000 puts. So we're seeing a lot of this activity fall off. The majority of it is going to fall off, at least in terms of what's centralized in any one expiration cycle. So once these 350 come out of the 1 million, still obviously there will be 650,000 or so. And that's kind of spread out pretty massively, except the next large expiration cycle is this 19 July. 217,000 calls, 131,000 puts. And this is kind of standard for what I'm noticing the activity here in GameStop. It's almost like in futures where the front expiration is hands down the busiest. And then we start to see a little bit movement into the next expiration cycle. The very next one, as we get closer, there's a benefit to that. You based on the style of the positions you're building, you will be a little more sensitive to spot price changes. However, the downside to this is you kind of lose a lot of money if it doesn't move in your favor in that time frame. This again goes back to that other video as referencing and the benefit of establishing positions that are a little bit further out, maybe a little bit more expensive to get into overall, but it gives the position some time to work. All right, the last thing I want to talk about is volume, the vast majority of the volume today, still over 200,000, but the vast majority was in the near expiration. So again, if we clear out that 341,000, we take a look at today, it was 125,000, over half of it was in this front expiration. So we are seeing a bit of a shift out into this 19 July, there's 35,000 calls there, 12,000, that's out in 16 August. Now I do find this part interesting, we're in the five July, there's 86,000 calls. That is a little bit anomalous, especially compared to kind of standard open interest. You'll see that the five July's have 109K against the 19 July's 217. So this is a lot of people just moving out one week, just trying to keep the dream alive. If you take a look at the volatility, 227% IV for today, and then next week it's only 111, then it jumps back up into the 120's. Why is that? Well, it's a short week next week. We have July 4th, happy birthday, America coming up. So it's one less trading day, that drastically will impact volatility typically, and I think that's why this is the case here. So the probability of seeing some sort of really massive move is not being priced into the options. Now I know that that conflicts with some other ideas that are floating around in terms of the different cycles, but right now the markets aren't seeing that. So in GameStop, long story short, it looks like we're seeing a bit of flattening. We are seeing still more calls transacting to puts. We're seeing massive movement from this front expiration, no surprise, out into the very next expiration with still 19 July being the next largest expiration that is kind of topical for us. So that's what I'm seeing in here so far. As always, if there's any questions or anything that you want me to dive into, let me know. Now, let us pivot over quickly to Chewie. So I took a look through the options chain. And there's some interesting, I don't know, there's some interesting movement, but nothing that I'm really fallen over myself about, I do think a few things though. So if we take a look at the open interest, you'll notice that these are much closer than what you typically see in something like GME, which is way more callsque. Chewie right now is at 383 K calls against 295 K puts. Still callsque, but nowhere near to the same degree that you're seeing in something like GameStop. And if we take a look at the volume for today, it's much quieter. So 158 K again, 79 K, so nothing too crazy. I want to show you this. So this is where essentially I collated data from the entire month. It's kind of unwieldy and the strike prices are really weird because of the way that you have to pull the data. So you kind of just have to learn how to read this a little bit. It's not the simplest, but I'll walk you through it because there's only a couple of things that actually look very interesting to me here. Now in an aggregation lens, looking at these here, the 30 calls that are expiring the 19th of July, there's 18,679 of those. That's a pretty big centralization at that strike price. I also see it at the 35s in the same expiration. I also see it at the 37 and a halfs and also at the 45s. So this expiration is actually pretty hot. And if you take a look at the overall volume or this expiration compared to the others for the entire month, it's much, much higher. So yeah, 19th of July is interesting. Now if we go through kind of individual trade data here, we can sort and what I want to do is, as soon as I sort this, by the way, it's going to destroy this table. Don't worry about that. But we want to get rid of everything, except for long calls in this case, to see where we can see bigger trades going on. And then what we can do is sort by value and see where the bigger trades are. And there are quite a few of them. And again, a lot of them are in 19th July. Let's actually take a look at that expiration specifically here and see what's going on. There's a bunch of them. Again, I didn't, I wasn't as strict in terms of what I would consider a large trade. I include a lot in the 200s, which I typically wouldn't bother with. But I thought it was interesting nonetheless to take a peek at. So if we take a look at the sizes here, there are some really big trades. So we do have a couple of these several thousand lot positions that are worth quite a lot of money. So these are definitely coming in at the current offer. So these are buying these calls, the 35s, the 35s. And this is like a million and a half dollar position. This right here is combined just a super big position in the same expiration, slightly different execution times on these, but still big, big positions. And there's a handful of these that size up pretty, pretty quickly. So if we sort this by some of the larger positions, some people were talking about these 5,000 contract blocks. And there were a few of them in a couple different explorations, but they're also is one of them here. The main thing I'm trying to highlight is there is a pretty meaningful inflow of call volume at not insignificant prices. Again, I typically prefer to sort this by value so that you can really see where the larger players are at, which is what I would consider this section here. And you can see that there's some entries across different days facing into positions. But this is very much centralized in the 30 strike and the 35 strike hands down. So if we slide this out of the way we come into Chouee, we go out here again to the next primary expiration, 19 July. And we take a look at these. We have the 30s, which are becoming very, very active. There's 15,000 OI with 9,000, almost 10,000 transacted today. So there's a lot of people moving into this. And then if we come out here to the 35s, you'll see another big block of people. 16,700 OI and 5,000 traded today. So there are absolutely people building a position in here. The volatility is not that high. And if we take a look really quick at the out of the money implied volatility for an idea, we still have a standard volatility smile, at least for this near term expiration. Let's take a look at the 19 July. Yeah, so again, if you've looked at any of my other videos, you'll notice that this looks so different than what GameStop looks like. In here, there's standard emphasis to the downside. Typically, you'll see something that looks more like this. That's tail heavy to the downside. In terms of implied volatility, or a little more equal, whereas a lot of GameStop implied volatility for the out of the money is actually very high on the call side, meaning fear or expectation of upside movement. You're not seeing that here. But you do see some of these really large kinks like this right here behind my head. That's also very tradable. But yeah, even these 30s, they're not overpaying for them a ton, which is kind of nice from a practitioner standpoint in terms of your entries. But this also doesn't necessarily look to me like there's just a bunch of activity going on, something massive coming down the pike. As I always say, that doesn't mean that that's not the case, but this definitely looks a little bit slower than what I'm seeing in GameStop. So as always, any questions, let me know, be an outlier. See you guys later.
