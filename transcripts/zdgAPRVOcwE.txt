0.00s: What's up everyone?
1.72s: Taking a look at GameStop today.
3.28s: There was a pretty interesting trade
4.84s: that I want to go over with you as well as an update
7.24s: on the options chain because I do see a shift going on.
10.60s: And then I also want to address some comments yesterday
13.56s: from the chewy video where people were seeing
15.40s: interesting activity in those options chains.
17.68s: I actually collated data from the entire month
20.52s: for us to take a look through together in a spreadsheet.
23.36s: The overall goal here is to share information stuff
25.92s: that you guys can learn how to analyze things
28.00s: a little bit better, maybe structure trades a little bit smarter,
30.84s: which we'll talk about that as well.
32.28s: So let's dig right in.
33.68s: First things first, I think we need a poor one out a moment
37.24s: of silence for all of our homies out here at the 128 call.
43.12s: 67,348 expired worthless.
46.52s: Difficult trade.
47.32s: Super far out of the money, very low probability trade.
50.00s: This goes back to something I talked about most of the week
52.44s: as I saw people piling into these very low probability trade.
57.28s: So I know a lot of people are looking kind of for those lotto style plays.
60.92s: That's a tough way to make money in this business long term,
63.92s: which is what I'm concerned with.
65.60s: I've been doing this for over 16 years now.
67.60s: Consistency and making money long term is important.
71.36s: Now I understand every once in a while you might want to take a shot
74.72s: to see if you can hit one out of the park.
76.76s: So that's kind of the concept of the video I've been citing
79.76s: and I'll link it below again about buying options smarter.
83.32s: There's nothing wrong with taking a shot looking for
86.36s: a lower probability higher payout trade kind of asymmetric profile.
90.56s: But if that's the only thing you're doing,
92.84s: it's very difficult to make money.
94.92s: So what happened today?
96.36s: Well, a few things.
97.80s: One of them that was very interesting was this trade right here
101.88s: at 0744 Pacific time for today's expiration.
106.40s: Somebody transacted 496 of the 11 calls.
110.24s: This is an interesting trade because it landed towards the center
114.72s: of the bit asked spread a little bit closer though to the ask.
119.36s: So I'm thinking that these are buys not just for that reason,
123.60s: but also on the dynamic of the transaction.
126.76s: What does that mean?
127.36s: Well, if you're selling options and let's say he has the shares
132.68s: and he wants to sell the calls against the shares,
135.16s: typically you want to do that to capture some time value.
137.56s: There's essentially none of that left in here.
139.56s: There's so far in the money with zero DTEs.
143.00s: So I don't think that they're trying to do that.
146.16s: I think that this was a method to buy shares.
149.08s: That's my best guess.
150.08s: They pay a little bit of a premium to do it via options,
152.64s: but they have the benefit of getting it at a certain strike.
156.08s: They don't have to fight the market trying
157.92s: to fill a position of the size because this is a pretty big trade.
162.60s: The premium of the position is over $700,000 by itself.
166.80s: These are very, very deep in the money.
168.76s: So that's my best guess.
170.08s: This was somebody looking to enter in via shares.
173.84s: So we'll have to see how this one goes
175.76s: because it wouldn't surprise me to see a pretty decent flood
178.80s: then of short calls of people trying to capitalize
183.20s: and capture the elevated volatility as much as there is left.
187.72s: And this is a pretty sizable position to do so.
191.24s: This is again, 496 contracts, each worth 100 shares.
196.16s: That's my guess.
197.24s: And if we take a look again at the options chain,
200.24s: the vast majority of the volume at the strike is that person.
203.44s: It's not like they got in, got out.
205.52s: My guess is they were looking to onboard shares.
208.16s: So interesting trade though.
210.04s: Not anything else in here that stuck out too much.
213.04s: It did look like aggregate buying activity though.
216.68s: And it's essentially across expiration cycles,
219.44s: but as you will typically note,
221.84s: the lion's share of it is going to be
224.24s: in the standard expiration cycles.
226.92s: So if you'll take a look at the 19 July,
229.40s: the larger value trades that were bought there,
233.52s: vastly larger than everything else except this one today,
238.28s: occurred here.
239.84s: And I've explained that before.
241.28s: It's essentially for liquidity.
242.80s: You're going to get way more liquidity going
244.36s: to a standard expiration cycle as compared to the weeklies.
247.80s: So it's very, very common to see that movement.
251.48s: Now if we take a look down here at open interest,
254.28s: there's about a million calls to 575,000 puts.
258.80s: And if we see where those are centralized,
261.36s: it's in this front expiration with 350,000 calls
265.28s: and 130,000 puts.
267.84s: So we're seeing a lot of this activity fall off.
271.28s: The majority of it is going to fall off,
273.36s: at least in terms of what's centralized
275.04s: in any one expiration cycle.
276.84s: So once these 350 come out of the 1 million,
279.68s: still obviously there will be 650,000 or so.
283.92s: And that's kind of spread out pretty massively,
285.96s: except the next large expiration cycle is this 19 July.
290.68s: 217,000 calls, 131,000 puts.
294.32s: And this is kind of standard for what I'm noticing
297.88s: the activity here in GameStop.
299.32s: It's almost like in futures where the front expiration
302.32s: is hands down the busiest.
303.84s: And then we start to see a little bit movement
306.40s: into the next expiration cycle.
307.88s: The very next one, as we get closer,
309.80s: there's a benefit to that.
310.84s: You based on the style of the positions you're building,
315.28s: you will be a little more sensitive to spot price changes.
318.88s: However, the downside to this is you kind of lose a lot of money
322.76s: if it doesn't move in your favor in that time frame.
324.72s: This again goes back to that other video as referencing
327.24s: and the benefit of establishing positions
329.12s: that are a little bit further out,
330.68s: maybe a little bit more expensive to get into overall,
333.12s: but it gives the position some time to work.
335.84s: All right, the last thing I want to talk about is volume,
339.88s: the vast majority of the volume today,
341.52s: still over 200,000, but the vast majority
344.12s: was in the near expiration.
346.52s: So again, if we clear out that 341,000,
349.44s: we take a look at today, it was 125,000,
351.24s: over half of it was in this front expiration.
353.84s: So we are seeing a bit of a shift out into this 19 July,
357.32s: there's 35,000 calls there, 12,000,
361.08s: that's out in 16 August.
363.20s: Now I do find this part interesting,
365.12s: we're in the five July, there's 86,000 calls.
369.00s: That is a little bit anomalous,
371.28s: especially compared to kind of standard open interest.
374.52s: You'll see that the five July's have 109K
377.44s: against the 19 July's 217.
379.88s: So this is a lot of people just moving out one week,
382.84s: just trying to keep the dream alive.
385.64s: If you take a look at the volatility, 227% IV for today,
390.56s: and then next week it's only 111,
393.32s: then it jumps back up into the 120's.
395.40s: Why is that?
396.24s: Well, it's a short week next week.
397.64s: We have July 4th, happy birthday, America coming up.
401.20s: So it's one less trading day,
403.40s: that drastically will impact volatility typically,
406.68s: and I think that's why this is the case here.
408.84s: So the probability of seeing some sort of really massive move
411.64s: is not being priced into the options.
413.24s: Now I know that that conflicts with some other ideas
416.72s: that are floating around in terms of the different cycles,
421.12s: but right now the markets aren't seeing that.
424.32s: So in GameStop, long story short,
427.36s: it looks like we're seeing a bit of flattening.
429.88s: We are seeing still more calls transacting to puts.
432.52s: We're seeing massive movement from this front expiration,
435.64s: no surprise, out into the very next expiration
439.04s: with still 19 July being the next largest expiration
445.88s: that is kind of topical for us.
448.20s: So that's what I'm seeing in here so far.
450.80s: As always, if there's any questions or anything
452.24s: that you want me to dive into, let me know.
454.36s: Now, let us pivot over quickly to Chewie.
457.44s: So I took a look through the options chain.
459.80s: And there's some interesting, I don't know,
463.88s: there's some interesting movement,
465.20s: but nothing that I'm really fallen over myself about,
469.64s: I do think a few things though.
471.92s: So if we take a look at the open interest,
473.48s: you'll notice that these are much closer
475.32s: than what you typically see in something like GME,
477.56s: which is way more callsque.
479.48s: Chewie right now is at 383 K calls against 295 K puts.
484.64s: Still callsque, but nowhere near to the same degree
488.44s: that you're seeing in something like GameStop.
490.92s: And if we take a look at the volume for today,
493.80s: it's much quieter.
494.84s: So 158 K again, 79 K, so nothing too crazy.
499.72s: I want to show you this.
501.36s: So this is where essentially I collated data
504.28s: from the entire month.
505.32s: It's kind of unwieldy and the strike prices are really weird
508.32s: because of the way that you have to pull the data.
510.36s: So you kind of just have to learn how to read this a little bit.
512.80s: It's not the simplest,
513.68s: but I'll walk you through it because there's only a couple of things
515.68s: that actually look very interesting to me here.
518.40s: Now in an aggregation lens,
523.48s: looking at these here,
525.24s: the 30 calls that are expiring the 19th of July,
529.68s: there's 18,679 of those.
532.56s: That's a pretty big centralization at that strike price.
536.28s: I also see it at the 35s in the same expiration.
540.20s: I also see it at the 37 and a halfs and also at the 45s.
544.04s: So this expiration is actually pretty hot.
547.36s: And if you take a look at the overall volume
550.80s: or this expiration compared to the others for the entire month,
553.36s: it's much, much higher.
554.84s: So yeah, 19th of July is interesting.
558.76s: Now if we go through kind of individual trade data here,
563.36s: we can sort and what I want to do is,
566.20s: as soon as I sort this,
567.08s: by the way, it's going to destroy this table.
568.52s: Don't worry about that.
570.00s: But we want to get rid of everything,
571.68s: except for long calls in this case,
573.44s: to see where we can see bigger trades going on.
576.08s: And then what we can do is sort by value
581.04s: and see where the bigger trades are.
583.32s: And there are quite a few of them.
585.88s: And again, a lot of them are in 19th July.
588.40s: Let's actually take a look at that expiration specifically here
593.08s: and see what's going on.
594.04s: There's a bunch of them.
595.32s: Again, I didn't, I wasn't as strict in terms of what I would
598.48s: consider a large trade.
599.68s: I include a lot in the 200s,
601.20s: which I typically wouldn't bother with.
603.08s: But I thought it was interesting
604.88s: nonetheless to take a peek at.
606.44s: So if we take a look at the sizes here,
607.96s: there are some really big trades.
610.32s: So we do have a couple of these several thousand lot positions
616.56s: that are worth quite a lot of money.
619.64s: So these are definitely coming in at the current offer.
622.92s: So these are buying these calls,
624.72s: the 35s, the 35s.
626.52s: And this is like a million and a half dollar position.
629.32s: This right here is combined just a super big position
634.44s: in the same expiration, slightly different execution times
638.48s: on these, but still big, big positions.
641.92s: And there's a handful of these that size up pretty, pretty quickly.
646.20s: So if we sort this by some of the larger positions,
650.24s: some people were talking about these 5,000 contract blocks.
653.76s: And there were a few of them in a couple different
655.96s: explorations, but they're also is one of them here.
658.84s: The main thing I'm trying to highlight is there is a pretty
661.48s: meaningful inflow of call volume at not insignificant prices.
668.68s: Again, I typically prefer to sort this by value
671.20s: so that you can really see where the larger players are at,
673.60s: which is what I would consider this section here.
676.12s: And you can see that there's some entries
677.72s: across different days facing into positions.
682.48s: But this is very much centralized in the 30 strike
685.92s: and the 35 strike hands down.
688.68s: So if we slide this out of the way we come into Chouee,
691.56s: we go out here again to the next primary expiration, 19 July.
695.48s: And we take a look at these.
696.52s: We have the 30s, which are becoming very, very active.
699.52s: There's 15,000 OI with 9,000, almost 10,000
703.12s: transacted today.
704.76s: So there's a lot of people moving into this.
706.60s: And then if we come out here to the 35s,
708.52s: you'll see another big block of people.
710.92s: 16,700 OI and 5,000 traded today.
714.32s: So there are absolutely people building a position in here.
717.92s: The volatility is not that high.
720.12s: And if we take a look really quick at the out of the money
723.24s: implied volatility for an idea,
725.12s: we still have a standard volatility smile,
727.88s: at least for this near term expiration.
729.40s: Let's take a look at the 19 July.
731.28s: Yeah, so again, if you've looked at any of my other videos,
734.00s: you'll notice that this looks so different
735.76s: than what GameStop looks like.
737.44s: In here, there's standard emphasis to the downside.
740.96s: Typically, you'll see something that looks more like this.
743.48s: That's tail heavy to the downside.
746.00s: In terms of implied volatility, or a little more equal,
748.80s: whereas a lot of GameStop implied volatility
751.72s: for the out of the money is actually very high
754.00s: on the call side, meaning fear or expectation
756.76s: of upside movement.
757.76s: You're not seeing that here.
759.04s: But you do see some of these really large kinks
761.92s: like this right here behind my head.
763.72s: That's also very tradable.
765.40s: But yeah, even these 30s,
766.92s: they're not overpaying for them a ton,
768.96s: which is kind of nice from a practitioner standpoint
772.20s: in terms of your entries.
773.64s: But this also doesn't necessarily look to me like
776.96s: there's just a bunch of activity going on,
780.48s: something massive coming down the pike.
782.68s: As I always say, that doesn't mean that that's not the case,
785.32s: but this definitely looks a little bit slower
787.60s: than what I'm seeing in GameStop.
790.04s: So as always, any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
793.20s: See you guys later.
