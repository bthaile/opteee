0.00s: I want to talk to you about the ugly
1.68s: truth of growing a trading account to
4.74s: make you rich 4010 minutes they traded
7.62s: NASDAQ let me show you how so right here
9.90s: guys we have resistance right so notice
12.60s: how it hit resistance and this is
15.12s: actually where the market opened right I
17.40s: use it on Trader Market open so it came
19.92s: back to resistance again with another
21.54s: rejection when it had another rejection
23.46s: that's when I got in I mean that's
26.16s: pretty much clear I mean pretty much
27.54s: clearer projecting twice boom I got in
29.40s: and I just got it I wrote it down for a
31.68s: quick one-to-one and I was done for the
33.36s: day because it's Friday I'm not done for
35.40s: the day because it's Friday so what did
37.68s: we just see we saw a masterful marketing
41.70s: exercise that is designed to gain your
44.64s: attention through a few things money
46.44s: fast four thousand dollars in 10 minutes
48.48s: that's a lot of money very quickly
50.10s: you're also looking at this as something
52.56s: that's repeatable and easy right we just
54.96s: need a double rejection apparently and
57.18s: then it's gonna go down even if that
59.34s: happened 50 percent of the time that
61.02s: would be great the problem is it's not
62.34s: true everything about that is not true
64.44s: and I want to talk to you about some of
66.78s: the aspects that are true most
69.18s: importantly I want to talk to you about
71.22s: how to actually create a realistic plan
74.52s: to grow a trading account into your
77.46s: future wealth legitimately so there's
79.14s: going to be some stuff in here that
80.28s: you're not going to like to hear because
81.42s: it's going to involve things like work I
83.76s: don't like working
85.10s: I don't want to work oh who wants to do
88.32s: that problem is is if you actually take
90.72s: some of this stuff to heart you might
92.46s: stand a chance out there if you attempt
94.50s: to apply what that dude just showed you
97.08s: probably not going to work super great
98.58s: and don't take my word for it let's
101.10s: actually look at some studies so the
103.26s: very first thing we have a study called
104.64s: option trading in individual investor
106.68s: performance this is not relegated to
108.48s: just options Traders but I talk to a lot
111.06s: of options Traders so I'm using this
112.44s: demographic but at a price applies more
114.66s: broadly so let's see what they found it
118.02s: says our finding that single men with
120.54s: low income and little investment
122.46s: experience that's kind of the Target
124.38s: demographic of new Traders here and
126.66s: notice what they just said single men
128.22s: low income that is a really important
131.22s: cognitive Factor right out of the gate
133.20s: there's desperation baked into this
135.48s: little investment experience this means
138.54s: we're ignorant we don't know what we're
140.04s: doing yet we don't know what we don't
141.54s: know suggests that gambling and
144.30s: sensation seeking are important
146.16s: determinants of option trading so what
148.08s: does this tell you that the people who
150.18s: are starting to try to trade options are
152.22s: looking to gamble and enjoy sensation
154.32s: seeking what does this mean this
155.82s: gambling it means that we want to make a
157.92s: lot of money asymmetric profit potential
160.50s: in not a lot of time without a lot of
162.90s: effort that is what gambling is it
165.24s: doesn't take any effort to walk in and
167.82s: buy a lotto ticket or to sit down at a
169.92s: blackjack table if you're not actually
171.42s: attempting to create Edge and count
172.92s: cards it's not that difficult so this is
175.20s: the demographic that we're talking to
176.88s: and guess what that video was geared
179.28s: Direct quickly towards
181.68s: that this is the reality though this
184.50s: person this is the middle of June today
186.24s: and this person's talking about that
187.92s: they were eight thousand dollars away
189.36s: from reaching one hundred thousand
191.04s: dollars doubling their account Chalker
193.14s: sort of yellowed because I was bullish
195.54s: and then let's take a look at the
197.10s: results and they're down Thirty one
199.02s: thousand three hundred fifty dollars
200.28s: they almost doubled their account but
202.08s: then they blew up they're back
203.22s: essentially to the original principle if
205.08s: they chill out but the problem is the
206.64s: Revenge seeking side of their Finance
208.38s: mind is going to start coming through
209.70s: and my hypothesis here is if you give
212.10s: this a little more time this will go
213.30s: down to just about zero dollars the
214.98s: point being this is what that kind of
217.80s: behavior leads to in the long run the
220.98s: problem is when you get these small
222.24s: snapshots of four thousand dollars in 10
224.58s: minutes you're like oh that looks
226.32s: pretty good I'll tell you what man it
227.58s: looks good to me too but the problem is
229.26s: is I was taught as a kid if something
231.06s: seems too good to be true it probably is
233.76s: and we look a little deeper hence from
236.16s: the study a lack of knowledge about the
238.38s: risk and return characteristics in the
240.24s: use of options might be another
241.38s: explanation for the detrimental impact
243.54s: of option trading on investor
244.98s: performance we don't know what we're
246.18s: doing we're just winging it and the
247.62s: problem is is since we're worried about
248.88s: the wrong thing we're worried about
250.32s: gambling we're worried about kind of
252.06s: these specific risk profiles that set us
254.58s: up for failure for most people they fail
257.34s: but for you for the outlier this is
260.34s: beautiful we want to see this
261.90s: unfortunately because this exists this
265.08s: is precisely why there's opportunity for
268.32s: people that are actually willing to put
271.56s: in the work that threshold of work is a
275.46s: safe haven for us and again the studies
278.34s: bear that out let me get myself out of
280.20s: your way so you can read as well and it
281.64s: says we identify a small group of
284.10s: sophisticated option traders who succeed
286.02s: in consistently outperforming other
287.88s: investors possible that's what this sums
290.10s: up to it's hard most people approach it
292.32s: wrong and dork it up but for the people
294.24s: who actually take this stuff seriously
296.04s: and apply themselves it's possible
297.74s: fantastic news so now what I want to
300.60s: talk to you about is what's within the
302.40s: realm of possibility how does this even
304.02s: all Stack Up what's realistic to think
306.66s: of and then most importantly how do we
309.56s: accelerate our performance I'm going to
312.12s: tell you exactly that so in the bottom
313.68s: left you see the Spy S P 500 returns
317.04s: against my returns we're looking from
318.48s: 2007 from when I started to the last
320.58s: full year which is 2022. we're going to
322.44s: look at compound annual growth rate
324.18s: specifically I also threw in an average
325.92s: there because people tend to ask that as
327.48s: well I prefer compound annual growth
329.52s: rate because that tells us essentially
331.26s: on an annual basis what is the average
333.60s: rate that our money is grown growing at
336.00s: as compared to just the average rate of
338.16s: return on Capital year over year and
340.38s: let's see what we have the S P 500 has
342.72s: returned to eight and a half percent I
344.28s: have returned 20.4 context I'm not a
348.30s: genius I'm not stupid I'm very middle of
350.40s: the road I've worked incredibly hard at
353.34s: this skill set while I was in high
355.14s: school I started while I was in college
357.00s: I obsessed over this stuff while most of
360.18s: my peers were chilling hanging out with
362.10s: friends which is all good I was in the
364.26s: lab working the point being is over this
366.90s: time frame I've spent over 30
369.30s: 000 hours trying to learn this skill set
371.88s: so I'm trying to give you some sort of
373.92s: Benchmark and to help with that
375.48s: Benchmark let's take a look at 2023 year
378.24s: to date again this is the middle of June
380.04s: the S P 500 before today was up 13.6
383.76s: percent and I was up 14.9 percent for
387.00s: context about what the upper echelon
389.70s: looks like if you look at the U.S
391.44s: investing Championship the top three
394.02s: people right now are at 122 percent
397.26s: return 91 and 89 returns respectively
400.98s: this is what the professionals rank at
404.58s: this is what they're doing this is what
406.56s: I'm doing the average person doesn't
409.32s: outperform this even they struggle to
411.96s: break even so if we're looking at the
414.54s: levels to this game you have pacing the
417.48s: S P 500 which is already above average
420.12s: then there's me that's outperforming the
422.82s: S P 500 handedly that's pretty far above
426.00s: average and then there's the top decile
428.52s: there are the people who are producing
430.44s: these kinds of returns and just blowing
432.66s: me out of the water this is the
434.52s: professional athlete and I'm a semi-pro
436.98s: in these results but again there's
439.92s: Beauty in this because you don't have to
442.62s: be a professional athlete level to make
444.72s: a lot of money doing this as a matter of
446.64s: fact I've never pursued these kinds of
449.04s: returns because for me making money was
451.56s: never a choice figuring out how to
453.42s: create wealth was never a choice I have
455.52s: people that depend on me my single
457.86s: mother has no retirement I needed to be
460.50s: in a place to make sure she would be
462.78s: taken care of as well as being able to
464.40s: take care of my family so the point
466.32s: being is even without attempting to hit
468.90s: kind of this Top Line absolute best
471.42s: performance out there you can still do
473.40s: really well if you apply yourself okay
475.68s: so now that we have some ideas about
478.02s: what growth looks like I want to talk to
480.54s: you about some of the return potentials
483.06s: here and I want to start with a
485.46s: comparison so on this right here this is
488.22s: showing us at twenty five hundred dollar
490.20s: initial principal my account back in
492.42s: 2007 adding zero dollars not putting any
495.78s: more money in getting that 20 return
497.82s: which is essentially doubling the market
500.46s: again pretty proud of that that over 15
502.80s: years we walk away with 38 500 not
508.44s: to talk about here however let's take a
511.20s: look at another scenario same thing 2500
513.42s: bucks 20 return for 15 years except in
516.18s: this scenario we are saving just two
518.88s: thousand dollars a month on average over
521.22s: that time frame you walk away with 1.8
523.32s: million at just two thousand dollars a
525.42s: month to put this in a context my first
527.40s: job out of college was a marine officer
530.34s: we got paid well we didn't get paid
532.20s: great the point being is the savings
534.84s: rate here is sliding scale based on what
537.54s: you're able to produce you might look at
539.28s: this if you're in your late teens saying
541.44s: holy crap that's more than I make in an
543.48s: entire year in general how can I
544.86s: possibly save that well there's a few
546.78s: different things we could do to
547.74s: accelerate this but just know this is on
549.60s: average ideally as your income grows
553.08s: your savings rate should also grow
555.54s: exponentially with it so in this case if
558.36s: you can maintain a really good savings
560.40s: rate early and then as as your earnings
562.44s: potential grows you start getting
563.76s: bonuses you're not going out and getting
566.16s: bottle service you're saving and if you
568.92s: do that early on you can walk away with
571.26s: a much better average monthly savings in
573.42s: this I certainly have but the point
575.34s: being is this is something that's
576.48s: attainable to most working professionals
578.82s: provided you make at least fifty
580.56s: thousand dollars a year ideally a bit
582.24s: more and you don't have any side hustles
583.98s: which we're going to talk about because
585.30s: guess what you should so now let's kind
588.30s: of get into the details here and I want
590.70s: to walk us through really what we've
592.38s: talked about so far the first thing is
594.48s: trading a small amount of money even
596.64s: with really good returns is not going to
599.04s: become your future wealth most likely we
601.80s: need to save we need to save very
604.02s: aggressively that's the Ugly Truth The
606.24s: Ugly Truth is starting with the ten
607.68s: thousand dollar account and then
608.88s: watching that YouTube video about this
610.74s: double resistance bounce and then making
612.84s: four thousand dollars every 10 minutes
614.58s: is utter so then we need to
616.98s: make a decision speed and risk the
619.02s: faster you want to try to make a bunch
620.40s: of money the more risk you're going to
622.02s: have to take to get there you have to
623.28s: figure out what's right for you but
624.54s: that's a really important step in this
626.10s: process but then we need to take a look
628.50s: at something like this how can we
631.14s: accelerate this it's simple the first
633.54s: one is saving the more aggressive you
635.76s: save early the more your investable
637.80s: principle is and provide it even if you
640.38s: get a median rate of return you can do
643.08s: well so if we save aggressively we have
645.06s: a good savings rate that's great if we
647.28s: maintain that good savings rate even as
650.34s: we increase our income as we go from a
653.94s: young professional in our early 20s to a
656.88s: somewhat tenured professional mid to
658.68s: late 20s and we maintain that aggressive
661.14s: savings rate as our income is increasing
664.02s: you're talking about some serious money
665.70s: here and this is just talking about a
667.80s: general job if your only income is your
671.22s: W-2 job you are one Bad season away from
674.70s: having no income and being poor bad
677.04s: approach think about your skill sets go
679.50s: do Uber go do um Uber Eats think about
682.98s: different skill sets that you have that
685.38s: you can use to make money that is
687.72s: probably one of the most important
689.82s: things you can do to really increase
691.62s: your savings overall is not to just rely
695.10s: on your day-to-day income but find other
697.20s: ways to do this for example when I was
699.12s: in college I used to buy broken cars fix
701.94s: them because that's the skill set I have
703.32s: and then sell them for a profit that was
705.48s: a way for me to increase income while I
707.34s: was compounding the money I was saving
709.02s: that's one example but the point being
710.64s: is you have to get creative here the
712.26s: more you want it the more you're willing
713.94s: to do problem is a lot of people talk
715.86s: about how much they want something but
717.60s: when it comes time to put in that effort
719.16s: all of a sudden you can kind of see how
720.96s: much they want it which isn't very much
722.28s: and then the last thing get good at
724.20s: trading really what I'm talking about
725.76s: when I say get good at trading is this
728.46s: part let me get this out of your way so
730.62s: it's a little easier to see and the
732.78s: stuff that I'm talking about here is
734.64s: your rate of return I got good at
737.22s: trading so 20 per year is fantastic and
740.22s: it makes a massive of difference in
742.86s: these different compounding growth
744.12s: scenarios so if you figure out the skill
746.10s: set and you get good at trading all of a
748.08s: sudden you can make pretty decent money
749.76s: and continue to accelerate that curve
751.80s: but the punch line here
753.60s: Dave gotta save that is what is really
756.54s: going to get you from your small account
758.70s: to a million plus dollar account is
761.22s: saving all of these other things belong
763.38s: there otherwise you can't save your way
765.24s: to wealth but you've got to save in
767.40s: order to make this whole thing work if
768.96s: you have any questions throw them down
770.22s: in the comments don't forget like
771.54s: subscribe share be an outlier see you
773.34s: guys later
