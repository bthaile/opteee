0.00s: What's up to all the outliers?
3.10s: Welcome.
3.96s: And if you're new to the channel,
5.56s: what's going on?
6.40s: My name's Eric and welcome to you as well.
8.40s: So today I want to talk about portfolio margin
11.64s: as well as margin.
13.12s: And I got a couple of questions about some best practices.
16.38s: So we'll talk about that as well at the end.
19.16s: So to kick us off,
20.62s: let's start with what is margin?
23.80s: Margin in a nutshell is leverage.
26.52s: It is your broker allowing you a little bit
30.76s: of fiscal freedom, essentially,
33.48s: to maybe trade more value,
36.88s: notional value of a product than you have in the account.
40.16s: Or it's when they're asking you to set aside
43.64s: potentially a smaller amount than otherwise required
47.56s: if it were a cash-secured position.
49.56s: So what I have here is actually a couple excerpts
52.92s: directly from the SEC.
55.08s: So we will go ahead and link to this
57.52s: in the video description below
58.84s: if you want to check out any of the articles
60.88s: I'm going to go over today.
62.72s: But you'll notice a few things.
64.52s: We have an initial margin, maintenance margin,
68.12s: and margin calls.
69.84s: Let's start with initial margin.
71.60s: This is essentially the amount of money
73.32s: that the broker asks you to have in the account
76.96s: up front to cover a position.
79.56s: And as you can see, very frequently it's up to 50%
83.32s: of the purchase price of a security.
85.08s: So this is right now we're talking about stock.
86.92s: We'll talk about options as well.
88.60s: But right now we're talking about stock.
90.24s: So if you want to buy $100 worth of stock,
93.56s: whatever it is, essentially the broker would ask you
96.32s: for 50 bucks.
98.08s: Then when we actually establish the position
101.32s: we have what's called maintenance margin.
103.44s: And there's something I want to highlight here.
105.92s: You'll see that for maintenance margin technically speaking,
110.24s: it says at least 25% of the total market value
113.52s: of securities in your margin account.
115.20s: So it means that your initial margin is going to be higher
117.80s: than the maintenance margin going forward.
120.08s: So this is just a broker protecting themselves essentially.
123.20s: The interesting part though is this part down here,
126.80s: which as many brokerage firms have higher maintenance requirements
129.80s: typically between 30% and 40%.
131.68s: I typically see 30%.
133.72s: So it's just important to note that all of the discussion
136.48s: that we have today is going to be specific
139.12s: to your broker because for regulation T,
142.76s: this is set by SEC and FINRA.
145.52s: However, your broker can be more strict.
148.96s: They can't be less strict.
151.40s: So most of them adhere to the 50% on initial
154.16s: where you'll see the variances on maintenance.
156.88s: All right, so let's talk about portfolio margin,
159.48s: the purpose of this video.
161.80s: There's a big difference between portfolio margin
164.32s: and regulation T.
165.36s: Regulation T has already standing permutations
169.80s: that are ran to determine how much money
171.84s: you need to keep in your account at a given point in time.
175.36s: This applies to stock positions.
177.76s: This applies to options positions.
180.00s: And essentially, not all positions are treated as equals.
185.32s: And what I mean by that is, for example,
188.20s: your brokerage might look at an index product,
192.60s: let's call it spy, or Apple,
195.88s: they might look at them differently
197.28s: in terms of how much money they want you to set aside.
199.96s: So for example, more often than not,
203.00s: index products are going to be slightly less margined than none.
209.52s: And it's because there's a perceived lower amount
211.60s: of risk there.
212.80s: So when we're looking at portfolio margin,
215.20s: there's a couple of things that are happening here.
217.40s: The first one is this, and this is kind of an important highlight,
222.40s: is it's based on the, well, I mean across it out,
226.04s: that one, right?
228.36s: It's based on the overall portfolio risk,
232.44s: not each individual trade.
234.76s: Now, if your portfolio is concentrated into one product,
238.96s: then obviously it's still going to assess a higher risk there.
242.20s: Because one of the things your broker is including
244.20s: in their calculation is the overall perceived risk
249.20s: of your portfolio, part of that being how diversified you are.
253.60s: So notice how I say it's a proprietary account margining
258.40s: based on overall portfolio risk.
260.40s: The reason I say proprietary is because it's broker specific.
263.40s: Different brokers will have different computations
266.60s: on how they arrive at how much margin they want for a portfolio
271.40s: or for individual positions.
273.40s: So what I'm going to go over down here is for TD Ameritrade
276.40s: because that's who I use.
278.40s: So just make sure you check with your broker
281.00s: and what their requirements are.
283.40s: So when we look at portfolio margin accounts,
287.20s: a couple important notes.
288.80s: The first one is IRAs are not applicable.
291.00s: It has to be a standard margin account.
293.28s: It also requires a minimum amount of capital,
295.80s: typically 125,000 initials and then 100,000 maintenance.
300.20s: Again, check with your broker and many require a written test.
304.00s: It's super easy, but they require you to do it.
307.00s: For regulation T, you pretty much just need $2,000.
310.60s: But for portfolio margin because there's increased leverage,
315.40s: they're a little more strict.
317.40s: So rather than using those standard calculations
320.40s: that you see in regulation T,
322.20s: portfolio margin uses specific ranges
327.00s: for positions based on the product, as I was mentioning before.
332.00s: So they like right now TD Ameritrade
334.80s: using minus 15% positive 15% for stocks
338.80s: and option positions in minus 12 and plus 10%
342.80s: for large and small cap broad based indices.
345.60s: So notice that difference I was referencing before.
348.40s: And then they also goes into a little bit of detail
351.40s: on how they incorporate implied volatility calculation.
354.88s: So they use what's called sticky strike, sticky delta.
357.68s: Sticky strike is when there's a constant IV computation,
361.20s: sticky delta is when there's a slope involved.
364.00s: And essentially they run through their calculation
366.80s: and they decide how much they want you to have in the account.
370.20s: And notice this last note here,
372.80s: wider stress test parameters that result in a larger,
375.60s: larger requirement may be enforced at any time.
377.60s: Here's the deal.
378.60s: Margin is a luxury afforded to us.
380.80s: It gives us greater leverage, the ability to be more efficient
384.20s: in our portfolios.
385.80s: But this, their broker's not doing this out of the kindness
389.20s: of their heart.
390.20s: They're doing it because it's a selling point.
392.80s: We want to be efficient.
394.40s: But at no point does that mean that the broker is not going
398.60s: to cover their risk?
399.60s: That is their job.
401.20s: So as soon as we see or the broker starts to calculate
405.60s: different volatility metrics and they see increased risk,
408.80s: you would better believe the larger requirements are going
411.60s: to increase.
412.60s: They're not going to cover your risk for you.
415.20s: All right.
415.60s: So a couple of things.
416.80s: This is the SEC site that I was talking about.
418.80s: I will link to this.
420.00s: This one is just a quick comparison
423.60s: of different amounts of capital required for different positions.
426.80s: This is again for TD Ameritrade.
428.80s: So when we're looking at stock, this is showing you
431.40s: that it's a long 100 shares of a random stock at $100.
435.20s: And it's showing you what the initial margin is,
438.80s: what the maintenance margin is, and then what the portfolio margin is.
442.20s: So this is assuming, again, we're a long 100 shares of stock
447.60s: that's valued at a hundred bucks.
448.80s: So we can see for initial, again, 50%.
451.40s: We know that.
452.40s: So that's going to be $5,000.
454.20s: Then you can see for them, they don't use a 25% metric.
457.40s: They use 30%.
459.00s: And then for portfolio margin, you can see it's just $1,500.
463.40s: So there's pretty significant leverage here.
465.80s: Let's take a look at a short iron condor.
468.20s: So there's four legs here now.
470.20s: So for the traditional margin requirement,
473.20s: you could see on this trade, it's $50,000.
476.40s: And then for the portfolio margin is $31,896.
480.20s: So depending on the positions that you have on
483.40s: and depending on how diverse they are,
485.60s: you will see slight variance in what the requirements are
489.00s: as an entire portfolio is assessed.
492.40s: So the other thing I wanted to show you is this right here.
496.60s: This is what talks about their actual computations.
500.60s: And I think it's important for anybody
502.80s: that's trading with portfolio margin to take a look at
505.80s: how your individual broker thinks about things
508.60s: like expected price ranges or points of no returns.
511.40s: Because that's part and parcel to actually existing
514.30s: with an margin account, specifically portfolio margin account.
517.60s: So if you have any questions like this
521.00s: or this content's helpful for you,
522.60s: make sure you like and subscribe
524.20s: so that we can continue growing
526.20s: and I can add content that helps you all out.
529.20s: I think margin is a great tool.
531.70s: And it's really important to understand
533.30s: that there's some best practices that go with it.
535.80s: Like not always redlining it.
538.50s: One of the greatest things we can do is trade
540.90s: how we need to trade, but have more room.
543.80s: If we want to take advantage of things
545.90s: or if we want to leave room for buying power expansion
548.90s: in case the market goes through a downturn,
551.30s: tons of utility from portfolio margin.
555.10s: Obviously with more margin comes more risk.
557.90s: So it's important to think through how we deploy it
560.60s: and make sure that we have a solid plan
562.30s: when we're doing so until next time.
564.90s: Be an outlier.
