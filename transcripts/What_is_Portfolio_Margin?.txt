1.04s: what's up to all the outliers welcome
4.00s: and if you're new to the channel what's
5.68s: going on my name is eric and welcome to
7.76s: you as well so today i want to talk
9.84s: about portfolio margin as well as margin
13.12s: and i got a couple questions about some
15.44s: best practices so we'll talk about that
17.36s: as well at the end so to kick us off
20.64s: let's start with what is margin margin
24.48s: in a nutshell is leverage it is your
27.20s: broker
28.40s: allowing you a little bit of fiscal
31.84s: freedom essentially to maybe trade more
36.16s: value notional value of a product than
38.56s: you have in the account
40.08s: or it's when they're asking you to set
42.72s: aside potentially a smaller amount than
46.24s: otherwise required if it were a cash
48.16s: secured position
49.52s: so what i have here is actually a couple
52.00s: excerpts directly from the sec so we
55.60s: will go ahead and link to this in the
57.60s: video description below if you want to
59.36s: check out any of the articles i'm going
60.96s: to go over today
62.56s: but you'll notice a few things
64.40s: we have an initial margin maintenance
67.12s: margin and margin calls let's start with
70.32s: initial margin this is essentially the
72.48s: amount of money that the broker asks you
75.28s: to have in the account up front to cover
78.40s: a position and as you can see very
81.12s: frequently it's up to 50
83.20s: of the purchase price of a security so
85.12s: this is right now we're talking about
86.40s: stock we'll talk about options as well
88.40s: but right now we're talking about stock
90.16s: so
91.20s: if you want to buy a hundred dollars
92.72s: worth of stock whatever it is
94.16s: essentially the broker would ask you for
96.64s: 50 bucks
98.08s: then when we actually establish the
100.80s: position we have what's called
102.00s: maintenance margin and there's something
104.16s: i want to highlight here you'll see that
107.36s: for maintenance margin technically
109.36s: speaking it says at least 25 of the
112.48s: total market value of securities in your
114.16s: margin account so it means that your
115.84s: initial margin is going to be higher
117.68s: than the maintenance margin going
119.04s: forward
120.00s: so this is just a broker protecting
121.60s: themselves essentially
123.12s: the interesting part though is this part
125.84s: down here which is many brokerage firms
128.00s: have higher maintenance requirements
129.68s: typically between thirty and forty
131.12s: percent i typically see thirty percent
133.68s: so it's just important to note that all
135.76s: the discussion that we have today is
137.44s: going to be specific to your broker
140.40s: because for regulation t this is set by
143.76s: sec and finra
145.36s: however your broker can be more strict
148.88s: they can't be less strict so most of
151.92s: them adhere to the 50 on initial where
154.24s: you'll see the variances on maintenance
156.72s: all right so let's talk about portfolio
158.96s: margin the purpose of this video
161.76s: there's a big difference between
163.36s: portfolio margin and regulation t
165.20s: regulation t has already
168.08s: standing permutations that are ran to
170.56s: determine how much money you need to
172.16s: keep in your account at a given point in
174.24s: time
175.20s: this applies to stock positions this
177.84s: applies to options positions and
180.72s: essentially not all positions are
183.36s: treated as equals and what i mean by
186.00s: that is for example
188.16s: your brokerage might look at an indus
191.60s: index product let's call it spy
194.32s: or apple they might look at them
196.48s: differently in terms of how much money
198.40s: they want you to set aside so for
200.64s: example more often than not
202.96s: index products are going to be slightly
205.84s: less
207.68s: margined than none and it's because
210.00s: there's a perceived lower amount of risk
211.92s: there so when we're looking at portfolio
214.64s: margin there's a couple things that are
216.16s: happening here the first one is this and
219.52s: this is kind of an important highlight
222.40s: is it's based on the oh didn't mean to
225.20s: cross it out that one right
227.52s: um it's based on the overall portfolio
231.76s: risk not each individual trade now if
235.20s: your portfolio is concentrated into one
238.40s: product then obviously it's still going
240.40s: to assess a higher risk there because
242.40s: one of the things your broker is
243.60s: including in their calculation
246.72s: is
247.76s: the overall perceived risk of your
250.32s: portfolio part of that being how
251.92s: diversified you are
253.68s: so notice how i say it's a proprietary
256.96s: account margining based on overall
259.68s: portfolio risk the reason why i say
260.88s: proprietary is because it's broker
262.64s: specific different brokers will have
265.28s: different computations on how they
267.36s: arrive at how much margin they want for
270.56s: a portfolio or for individual positions
273.36s: so what i'm going to go over down here
275.12s: is for td ameritrade because that's who
277.36s: i use so just make sure you check with
279.84s: your broker and what their requirements
282.48s: are
283.28s: so when we look at
285.68s: portfolio margin accounts a couple
287.68s: important notes the first one is iras
289.92s: are not applicable it has to be a
291.60s: standard margin account it also requires
294.16s: a minimum amount of capital typically
296.68s: 125 000 initial and then 100 000
299.52s: maintenance again check with your broker
301.60s: and many require a written test it's
304.16s: super easy but they require you to do it
306.88s: for regulation t you pretty much just
308.56s: need two thousand dollars
310.64s: but
311.36s: for portfolio margin because there's
313.60s: increased leverage
315.36s: they're a little more strict
317.36s: so rather than using those standard
319.68s: calculations that you see in regulation
321.44s: t portfolio margin uses
324.48s: specific ranges
326.88s: for positions based on the product as i
330.48s: was mentioning before so they like right
333.44s: now td ameritrades using minus 15
336.48s: positive 15 for stocks and option
339.36s: positions in minus 12 and plus 10
342.80s: for large and small cap broad-based
345.04s: indices so notice that difference i was
346.72s: referencing before
348.32s: and then it also goes into a little bit
350.64s: of detail on how they incorporate
352.80s: implied volatility calculations so they
355.04s: use what's called sticky strike sticky
356.80s: delta sticky strike is when there's a
359.04s: constant iv computation sticky deltas
361.84s: when there's a slope involved and
364.40s: essentially they run through their
366.00s: calculation and they decide how much you
368.00s: want they want you to have in the
369.12s: account
370.16s: and notice this last note here
372.80s: wider stress test parameters that result
374.72s: in a larger margin requirement may be
376.72s: enforced at any time here's the deal
378.64s: margin is a luxury afforded to us it
380.96s: gives us greater leverage the ability to
383.12s: be more efficient in our portfolios but
386.56s: this their broker's not doing this out
388.48s: of the kindness of their heart they're
390.40s: doing it because it's a selling point we
392.96s: want to be efficient
394.40s: but at no point does that mean that the
396.72s: broker is not going to cover their risk
399.44s: that is their job so as soon as we see
403.84s: or the broker starts to calculate
405.44s: different volatility metrics and they
407.52s: see increased risk you would better
409.12s: believe the margin requirements are
411.20s: going to increase they are not going to
413.36s: cover your risk for you
415.12s: all right so a couple other things this
416.72s: is the sec site that i was talking about
418.64s: i will link to this this one is just a
421.68s: quick comparison of different amounts of
425.12s: capital required for different positions
426.80s: this is again for td ameritrade so when
429.04s: we're looking at stock this is showing
431.12s: you that it's a long 100 shares of a
433.12s: random stock at a hundred dollars and
435.36s: it's showing you
436.64s: what the initial margin is what the
439.28s: maintenance margin is and then what the
440.72s: portfolio margin is so this is assuming
444.08s: again we're long 100 shares of
447.12s: stock that's valued at 100 bucks so we
448.88s: can see for initial again 50 we know
451.60s: that so that's gonna be five thousand
453.36s: dollars then you can see for them they
455.44s: don't use the 25 metric they use 30
458.88s: and then for a portfolio margin you can
461.12s: see it's just 1500 bucks so there's
463.76s: pretty significant leverage here let's
465.92s: take a look at a short iron condor so
468.32s: there's four legs here now
470.00s: so for the traditional margin
472.40s: requirement you could see on this trade
474.48s: it's fifty thousand dollars and then for
476.80s: the portfolio margin is 31 896. so
480.48s: depending on the positions that you have
482.80s: on and depending on how diverse they are
485.52s: you will see slight variance in what the
487.60s: requirements are as
490.00s: an entire portfolio is assessed so
493.68s: the other thing i wanted to show you is
495.68s: this right here this is what talks about
497.76s: their actual
499.04s: computations
500.64s: and i think it's important for anybody
502.72s: that's trading with portfolio margin to
504.32s: take a look at how your individual
506.80s: broker thinks about things like expected
509.28s: price ranges or points of no returns
511.36s: because that's part and parcel to
513.20s: actually existing within a margin
514.88s: account specifically portfolio margin
516.56s: account
517.60s: so
518.88s: if you have any questions like this or
521.20s: this content's helpful for you make sure
522.88s: you like and subscribe so that we can
525.12s: continue growing and i can add content
527.44s: that helps you all out i think margin is
530.48s: a great tool and it's really important
532.64s: to understand that there's some best
533.92s: practices that go with it like not
536.64s: always redlining it one of the greatest
539.12s: things we can do is trade how we need to
541.36s: trade but have more room if we want to
544.72s: take advantage of things or if we want
546.48s: to leave room for buying power expansion
548.80s: in case the market goes through a
550.24s: downturn
551.36s: tons of utility from portfolio margin
555.04s: obviously with more margin comes more
557.20s: risk so it's important to think through
559.60s: how we deploy it and make sure that we
561.12s: have a solid plan when we're doing so
563.52s: until next time be an outlier
