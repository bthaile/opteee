0.76s: what's up everyone we just wrapped up
3.68s: episode four of analyzing this man's
6.96s: trades and all of his yellow updates on
10.12s: Reddit we're almost done we have to get
12.28s: through 2024 yet but we've gotten
14.88s: through everything leading into it so
17.52s: what I want to do in this video is just
18.76s: kind of summarize what we've found so
21.32s: far and it's because it's fascinating to
24.76s: me it genuinely is fascinating to me so
27.60s: I need to start with a couple General
30.24s: disclaimers because I know that all of
32.44s: this stuff is super sensitive with
34.12s: people the reason why I'm doing this is
36.72s: because I've been trading for a long
38.72s: time and it's not common that you come
42.00s: across really uncommon things in markets
46.04s: and what I mean is when I look through a
48.20s: lot of what he's done there are multiple
52.08s: displays of really uncommon behaviors
55.08s: that are fascinating to me it's as if
57.28s: I'm looking at nature and I see an
60.16s: anomaly and it's there I can see what
62.56s: it's doing Loosely I don't understand
64.68s: what it's doing but I can see it so it's
66.88s: fascinating to me I am not doing any of
69.92s: this in the context of trying to
72.40s: replicate what he does I don't think
73.92s: anybody can replicate what he does and I
76.04s: think that's by Design I think that's
77.76s: part of why he's been successful is
79.88s: because there absolutely is an element
82.44s: of survivorship byas in what he does it
85.64s: it is what it is so the last thing I
89.04s: want to offer here is I'm still
91.44s: relatively new to this so I am not going
93.88s: to pretend like I know everything that's
95.16s: going on because I don't I've traded
97.12s: GameStop a lot through its movements
99.44s: from an options trading perspective but
101.84s: with respect to getting into the story
103.60s: the background understanding The
105.28s: Catalyst the characters all of those
107.12s: kinds of things I'm brand new to this
108.96s: thing I really started digging in back
110.84s: in May so I've probably spent few
114.20s: hundred hours on it at this point which
115.96s: is really insignificant compared to a
118.00s: lot of other people I want to make all
119.60s: of that super clear I am applying the
122.12s: analysis from the perspective of a
124.32s: Trader first and foremost and I want to
127.04s: talk about that now let's start with a
130.72s: quick overview of what we've done and
133.64s: what we've found and when I say we it's
135.56s: because I've done most of these on not
137.56s: most all of this on the Saturday Night
140.20s: gme Live Stream So I've purposefully
142.48s: done it with the community so that you
144.76s: all can help me understand what I'm
147.52s: looking at because there's a lot of
149.08s: context that I don't have so what we did
152.08s: is literally go all the way back to the
154.16s: very very first post we went all the way
155.84s: down to the bottom then I started
158.28s: logging a few data points and this is
160.72s: all duplicative I'm not looking for
162.32s: anything to be like nice or pretty here
163.92s: this is literally just for my eyes to
166.00s: track what's going on the entire
168.80s: objective of this exercise was not to um
172.28s: generate a large data set for later
174.16s: manipulation it was literally for me to
176.44s: go line by line understand each change
181.24s: when it happened what did the market
183.08s: look like when it happened what did the
184.84s: commentary look like around when it
186.48s: happened to fully understand stuff
188.84s: because it's easy to share things that
191.24s: we've heard secondhand we might Loosely
193.56s: understand but I demand firsthand
196.88s: information as close as I can get to it
199.16s: because there's a lot open for
200.52s: interpretation and there's a lot of
201.96s: things that can get lost in the details
203.60s: and the devil is in the details that's
205.68s: where I focus so that's why I did this I
209.12s: wanted to get a really good sense of
211.24s: what this whole thing looked like
212.84s: literally post by post
216.24s: so what do we notice a lot of things now
220.52s: I started tracking this on the 1st of
222.96s: September of 2020 that's not the first
225.96s: update that he has I started tracking
228.56s: them a little bit further in because we
230.60s: were going line by line uh previously
233.40s: and kind of getting a qualitative
234.96s: assessment of some of the changes so
237.96s: from this point forward he already had
240.80s: built a little bit of an account he
242.48s: didn't start with his $100,000 but
244.76s: there's a few things that shocked me
247.28s: right from the beginning and the very
249.24s: first one is I always thought that
252.40s: roaring Kitty was primarily a stock
254.80s: Trader and this is my own naive I
257.36s: thought that because of things that I've
258.76s: heard the way I've heard people talk
260.08s: about them communities that are actually
262.84s: like I didn't know this but quite
264.32s: against options so I had just assumed
267.88s: that he was a stock Trader and that's
269.40s: why all of those artifacts were in place
271.32s: but funny enough the very first position
273.56s: that I see for him in his yellow updates
275.60s: in Wall Street bets and this is from 5
277.68s: years ago this is his first post on 8ep
280.96s: 2019 it's actually all options and it's
284.36s: about a $100,000 account now one of the
286.88s: things I identified here again from the
288.88s: live stream last night is that he
292.12s: obviously had other stuff at this point
294.08s: in time and we know that from some of
296.16s: his live streams which is also very
298.36s: interesting so for example if we compare
301.68s: this date again this is the 8th of
303.64s: September we can see the portfolio as it
305.76s: sits this is showing the what's in the
307.80s: portfolio right and we can see the total
310.56s: values and all that kind of stuff and
312.08s: this all lines up so this tells me that
313.84s: this isn't like a snapshot of what's in
315.40s: his portfolio this is what he's
316.76s: currently holding and it's a a thousand
319.08s: total calls across these different
321.48s: expirations different strikes okay now
323.68s: if we go to his YouTube channel and we
325.32s: grab one of these live streams it
326.68s: doesn't really matter which one let's
328.24s: grab this one so so in the different
331.60s: live streams he shows different elements
333.88s: of his tracker that actually show his
337.04s: percent of portfolio um I'm not sure if
339.84s: it's in this one it's probably this one
342.16s: or this one maybe I just want to see if
344.28s: I can find the yeah okay here it is so
346.76s: if I get rid of this and you can take a
349.00s: look at the percent of portfolio as he's
351.04s: scrolling around a little bit and this
353.36s: is clearly after that right so this is 3
356.88s: a 2020 so we already know know that he
360.92s: has other stuff on at this point because
363.24s: he posts this one portfolio that's just
365.12s: GameStop but at a later point in time
368.28s: that he clearly has other positions on
370.56s: so again don't mean anything one way or
373.28s: the other by it but just general
376.28s: information so as we go through the
379.68s: remainder of all these different trades
381.48s: there's a couple things that I picked up
384.24s: pretty
385.76s: discreetly the first thing is there's
388.88s: this thought proc process rightfully so
391.08s: the dude's been tremendously successful
393.60s: but there's been this thought process
395.20s: that he's essentially like this this
397.56s: perfect timing machine that he's like
400.64s: pinpointing individual days that he
403.40s: knows something's going to happen and
404.84s: he's going to get in right before and
406.16s: then right after it or that he knows
408.40s: something's going to happen at this
409.72s: point in time so he's going to get in
410.96s: super early and wait until it happens
413.16s: and it's all fair ideas because we're
416.04s: all guessing what I can tell you
418.32s: definitively is that the value of his
421.72s: portfolio does not line up with that
425.20s: kind of timing premise it generally
428.76s: shows elements of timing for sure it
432.60s: does not line up with that kind of
435.56s: timing premise though what I mean is
437.40s: this if we take a look at 5 genan 2021
442.08s: the total portfolio value at that point
444.20s: was 2.8 mil it rises up to 3 or I'm
448.56s: sorry to seven
450.20s: 368 then it gets all the way up to 22
452.60s: mil then it gets up to 48 mil then it
455.40s: gets down to 33 then it trickles all the
458.52s: way down to 17 mil then it gets so what
461.60s: I'm highlighting is as this is moving
463.72s: around the portfolio value here is
467.40s: exhibiting massive volatility that's not
472.52s: a artifact of really careful timing what
476.40s: this is an artifact of is somebody that
478.84s: has super Supreme conviction in what
481.60s: they're doing and they're exceedingly
484.60s: comfortable taking massive size trades
488.68s: in writing it out and again that's an
491.88s: entire skill set in and of itself but
494.20s: what I want you to look at is this
495.40s: portfolio that went from 11 mil to
497.72s: almost 50 mil to 17 mil how many of you
501.08s: would go through that path probably
503.04s: right like most of us if you have
505.36s: something that goes from 7 to 50 let's
507.56s: say you were even good enough to ride it
509.56s: to that kind of peak there would have
511.28s: been exits for the overwhelming majority
513.28s: of that's life changing money but it's
516.72s: very clear that this is not what it's
518.92s: all about to him and this actually I
521.08s: think bolsters the idea that there are
523.80s: other accounts because one of the ways
526.40s: that you can let something like this do
528.96s: this is if your livelihood doesn't
532.04s: depend on this right because we know
534.00s: that he has a family and obviously I'm
535.84s: he likes to play around he likes to have
537.36s: fun but I don't see him as an irr
539.44s: responsible husband or father I see him
542.56s: as somebody who's trying to take care of
544.08s: his family so if I'm trying to take care
547.16s: of my family and I have an account that
549.96s: probably isn't doing this but is doing
551.48s: pretty well then it gives me the leeway
554.04s: to kind of let this be whatever it's
555.80s: going to be the other thing that we have
557.92s: to identify when we look at his overall
560.44s: approach is from this video and it's not
562.68s: all the way in here it's actually up
564.00s: here in the why I'm not a value investor
566.00s: section but he talks about his
568.00s: willingness to accept lumpy returns
571.08s: which makes a ton of sense sometimes
572.68s: it's going to be up sometimes it's going
573.96s: to be down and he phrases it up big down
576.80s: big right and as I look across his
578.96s: portfolio it's exactly what I see him
581.32s: executing that exact idea so from a
585.36s: trading perspective I see a few things
588.28s: the first thing is I see somebody that
590.04s: is not setting profit targets and again
593.16s: for most of us traditional full-time
595.32s: Traders we absolutely would set profit
597.64s: targets and it's so that we don't go
600.44s: through this kind of volatility and it's
602.80s: again it's because most of us are taking
604.76s: a slightly slower but higher
607.00s: probabilistic approach to the outcomes
609.16s: whereas it's very clear in his case this
611.44s: dude is very convicted and again even
614.80s: this he doesn't even bulk at this $48
618.76s: million worth of the account don't care
622.24s: clearly don't care just let it go next
624.72s: day it's down 10 plus Mill don't care
626.84s: and again we can see this as we get
628.20s: closer in time in the 2024 time frame or
630.32s: he's down over $200 million so from a
633.96s: trading perspective he has a different
635.64s: road map and it's kind of like the idea
637.76s: behind trading squeezes that you can't
640.76s: really apply a standard methodology to
642.80s: them you have to understand the profit
644.28s: mechanism of a squeeze the traits of
647.04s: squeezes how they behave their
649.48s: periodicity their severity their
651.68s: frequency the precursors such as volume
654.88s: all of those things once you have like a
656.48s: a fingerprint I call them of the
658.68s: tendency then you can create an approach
661.36s: around it well for him he's clearly
664.64s: trading this really concentrated
666.76s: approach but it's highly specific to him
670.16s: because as I look at these things the
671.88s: other thing I notice is he has a very
674.72s: strange way to manage these options so
677.84s: when I went back to this video he talks
681.28s: about the ways that he uses options very
684.16s: openly he uses things that are typically
686.96s: leaps meaning greater than a year out
688.92s: forther out in time and there's a couple
691.08s: things that he talks about that clearly
693.52s: let me know he knows exactly what he's
696.08s: doing right because obviously he trolls
698.16s: sometimes he posted that Meme where it
699.96s: was like the banana that had like
701.48s: options 101 or whatever right like
703.48s: joking that he doesn't know what he what
704.68s: he's doing with options but like clearly
706.64s: he does because he talks about the
708.64s: siphoning of liquidity he talks about
710.52s: essentially becoming an agent that's
712.76s: making your own markets that's
714.96s: fascinating because again this is
716.64s: happening four years ago back in 2020
718.80s: when he had had
720.08s: a tiny relative size account to what he
723.92s: had when he came back in 2024 so it
727.28s: tells me that this isn't somebody that's
729.88s: just bumbling through options he knows
732.12s: what he's doing he knows how they
733.44s: operate he even talks about the pricing
736.36s: of them a little bit earlier on where he
738.16s: says he finds a lot of them to be too
739.56s: expensive again that's probably some of
741.48s: the value investor methodology that he's
743.44s: also imparting on the options which I
744.84s: totally get we care about pricing of
746.40s: options we don't want to pay too many vs
748.32s: for something because then it just puts
749.80s: you at a
751.12s: disadvantage the fact that he's doing
753.00s: all that is interesting to me the
757.40s: broader fact that I find so interesting
761.36s: is he seems to be managing these options
765.00s: based on time not by value not by return
771.32s: not by price Target not by new Catalyst
775.72s: by time and that I can't help but find
778.76s: truly fascinating because there's
781.48s: artifacts of him holding options all the
784.08s: way into expiration there's artifacts of
786.96s: him holding opt options very close to
789.12s: expiration seemingly exercising right
791.64s: before that's the example of 16 April of
794.80s: what is this
796.12s: 2021 then there's artifacts of him
798.84s: closing options greater than 45 days out
802.16s: now from this video he says his average
804.80s: holding time is from 3 to 24 months
807.40s: which while that might seem like a crazy
808.84s: large range it again elucidates what
812.32s: he's doing which is not specifically
816.36s: pinpointing something but it's him
819.36s: playing a general idea in this case
822.08s: stock go up for X Y and Z reason and he
824.60s: has a ton of different reasons obviously
827.04s: but it's not this like perfect pricing
831.08s: mechanism so as you've noted I got us
835.72s: through 2021 so we still have to go
838.48s: through 20 24 and I am super eager to
843.28s: get into the 2024 updates and I am dying
847.12s: to know what kind of changes if any
851.16s: occur in his approach because I think
854.16s: we'll see it because I can see a lot of
856.08s: what he's doing here which is
857.52s: fascinating to me so when we start up
860.84s: again on next Saturday we'll go through
863.88s: in depth just like this step by step
866.44s: update by update we'll take a look at
868.20s: what gme looked like at the time of the
870.52s: update to get a sense of essentially
873.80s: what it looks like is going on and if
875.56s: there's a change in his methodology
877.36s: because again from what I see from 2019
880.80s: essentially through 2021 I see somebody
883.36s: who's using a tremendous amount of
885.96s: Leverage backed by a tremendous amount
888.44s: of conviction that is not managing
891.48s: trades based on standard approach things
894.12s: again like return profit Target so on
895.88s: and so forth but most of these are being
897.88s: managed by time because again I use
900.80s: examples like this where the account is
902.60s: up 46 million 47 million 40 million and
907.36s: he doesn't care he just kind of floats
909.24s: right through that looking for seemingly
911.60s: more but I actually don't know if
914.28s: there's a specific dollar Target that
916.92s: he's you know holding out until he gets
918.76s: to it seems like he's just trying to
920.32s: ride this thing up which again I just
923.00s: can't help but find so very curious so I
927.36s: want to see if when we get into 20 24 if
930.12s: there's any changes to some of these
932.20s: metrics that I can see in terms of when
934.00s: money is being put into the account
935.60s: versus coming out of the account we can
937.08s: see that versus seeing what kind of
939.52s: volatility he allows in the portfolio
941.56s: which again I already know most of 2024
943.68s: because I started that's where I started
944.96s: looking at this stuff and he allows a
946.88s: lot of volatility but I want to see
948.36s: exactly how much and so far we're
951.96s: dealing with a true anomaly and I am
955.52s: having literally so much fun trying to
958.96s: figure out what's going on here because
960.60s: it is so damn interesting so I'm sure a
965.64s: lot of you have ideas that we should
967.76s: take a look at or have some thoughts on
970.00s: what's going on here I would always love
971.80s: to hear it because most of you are what
974.64s: have allowed me to understand more of
977.80s: what's going on here so I would love to
979.36s: hear your ideas on essentially what I'm
981.52s: sharing here because again I don't know
983.76s: I'm just guessing I'm going off of what
985.28s: I can see coming up with the best
986.72s: conclusions I possibly can based on on
989.24s: information so if you have information
991.36s: that can help with that I would love to
992.56s: see it now as always if there's anything
994.60s: you need hit me up be an outlier I'll
996.92s: see you all later
