0.00s: As a retail options trader, you really have very few advantages in the market.
6.44s: However, compared to what you're typically probably told, it's not zero.
10.88s: There are a few strengths that we have.
13.96s: So through this video, we're going to talk about five of them.
16.96s: And the goal behind this is so that unlike other areas of life where it typically makes
23.04s: sense to work on your weaknesses and strengthen them up, trading is all about exploiting your
28.32s: strengths.
29.32s: And part of that is understanding even what some of our strengths are.
34.72s: I want to start with a few areas that retail does not have an advantage.
41.72s: So one of these is pretty straightforward, something like short-term timeframes and latency
47.40s: dependent ideas.
49.00s: And it's really because if you think about things like high frequency trading firms, they
53.80s: are executing in millisecond timeframes.
57.52s: This fully automated stuff, they literally have gone through phases where they were buying
62.88s: up real estate closest to the exchanges to decrease the length of their cables.
68.44s: And then the exchanges had to come to a point where they mandated minimum cable lengths
73.96s: to then try to equalize it a little bit.
76.04s: Like that's the game that they're playing.
79.12s: There's absolutely no competition in that space for retail traders.
83.00s: And this is why when retail traders are talking about things like, oh, I scalp.
87.40s: It's like, yeah, you might intraday trade.
89.40s: You might trade shorter-term timeframes.
91.44s: But again, you're competing against things that you really don't stand a chance.
96.40s: So that's not to say that you can't scalp, but it means you probably have to modify it
100.00s: a little bit because you're not really going to be able to scalp in the pure sense of
103.64s: very, very short-term transactions, especially once you include things like fees.
108.44s: So that's one example.
110.72s: Another example is custom products.
113.24s: Now, this might not make a lot of sense up front, but if you've ever watched a couple
119.08s: movies Wolf of Wall Street as one of them, but another great one is the big short, there's
124.12s: a series in the big short where essentially the funds goes into a large bank and they say,
130.88s: I want to create these specific swaps that are against mortgage-backed securities.
137.72s: They're based on mortgage bonds, credit default swap that will pay off if the underlying bond
145.16s: fails.
146.16s: You went about against the housing market.
149.08s: Why?
150.08s: Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages.
154.16s: That's never happened in history.
155.56s: If you'll excuse me, Dr. Berry, it seems like a foolish investment.
159.48s: Based on prevailing sentiment, the market, banks, and popular culture, yes, it's foolish
165.40s: investment, but everyone's wrong.
171.80s: The world of creating swaps, custom derivatives to a specific need really isn't something that
178.08s: retailers access to.
179.08s: It's kind of frustrating because if you think about trying to trade something like variance
183.40s: risk premiums in the market, which is something like this.
187.04s: If we grab the platform really fast and we look at this, we look at the term volatility
193.68s: and we say, okay, it looks like in this company there's a lot of opportunity for trading
199.48s: the persistence of variance risk premiums.
201.52s: Well, the problem is from a retail trading perspective, you can't actually create something
207.56s: that fully isolates this effect, the difference between implied and realized volatility.
214.00s: You have to trade something like a short straddle or a short strangle and then you have to continually
218.12s: delta hedge it, which costs money.
220.88s: And it's really an imperfect play against the idea that you're really trying to capitalize
226.08s: on.
227.08s: However, institutions are able to literally build custom products to exploit or explore
234.12s: very specific ideas that they have.
236.88s: Another example, volatility pricing.
239.48s: This is about as straightforward as it gets, but this is why for retail traders, we use
244.56s: things like implied volatility.
246.80s: We're extracting the price of volatility from the market and it's because our ability
252.88s: to come up with forecast volatility that exceeds something like virtue is about zero.
260.76s: They have literally armies of PhD at market making firms like this or other financial institutions
267.00s: that are going to the process of creating what we refer to as forecast volatility.
271.12s: This is figuring out what the volatility is that we should plug into a pricing model
275.56s: so that we know what the option be priced at.
277.64s: Again, from a retail trading perspective, we typically will extract out implied volatility,
282.36s: which is fine in most cases.
283.72s: Now, this doesn't mean that you don't get to develop some sort of opinion on volatility.
287.96s: You can use other tools, but the game of us thinking retail that we're going to price
294.08s: volatility better than these kinds of places.
296.80s: Again, it's just a complete fool's errand.
298.88s: It's not going to happen.
300.24s: Next example, information availability and processing.
304.12s: This kind of goes off of this very first one, but I wanted to expand it a little bit to
308.76s: give you a specific example.
310.76s: So if you think about something like a Bloomberg terminal, it costs around 24 grand per user
315.60s: per year.
316.60s: It's like 27K if you're only using a single terminal.
319.56s: Now this is the base starting point for any sort of serious institution.
326.68s: They're going to have a suite of these and it's going to cost them hundreds of thousands
331.96s: of dollars to maintain, but they're willing to accept that cost.
334.88s: This is just one example.
336.16s: There are other platforms like Icon and so on and so forth, but the reality is for most
342.04s: retail trading news sources, you're not really going to get cutting edge news or information.
348.00s: And that's actually not the end of the world.
349.92s: Because again, we're not really attempting to compete with these kinds of places in the
353.36s: ultra short term time frame, so we'll get into it a little bit later when we get to one
356.72s: of our strengths.
357.92s: Now this also doesn't even get into the world of the relationships.
363.28s: These institutions will have it with people at other places in the general world to get
369.56s: information that may not even be widely dispersed yet.
373.00s: Now that's not to accost the potential for insider information being passed around between
379.68s: friends to me and make some money.
382.44s: Sure, that doesn't happen.
384.48s: But beyond that, there's even a reality for information that might be more widely available.
390.40s: That's not widely distributed yet.
392.60s: That's being passed around between these closed channels.
396.16s: So it's just another example of a space that you really don't stand much of a chance.
400.24s: Now, let's talk about one of the places you do stand a chance, which is your trade
404.96s: sizes.
406.20s: If you haven't seen, there's a couple versions where Warren Buffett effectively talks
410.36s: about like the potential returns that he would get if he only had one million in Berkshire
416.48s: Hathaway.
417.48s: And the reason why he's using this idea of only having one million is because Berkshire
423.00s: Hathaway sits on such a massive amount of cash, not because they really just want to
429.08s: sit on this amount of cash.
430.52s: It's because the fund has been so successful that it cannot find opportunities that are
436.76s: attractive enough at a reasonable cost for them to get into a position that provides accurate
444.36s: sizing for what the portfolio would need, that it's literally just more effective for
448.52s: them to sit into cash.
450.32s: And what he's saying is that with the smaller portfolio and the ability to put on smaller
454.12s: positions to get into things and not move the market on himself, he would actually be
458.92s: able to perform much better.
460.76s: So our world of trading in single lot, five lot, ten lot, 20 lot trades is an advantage
469.04s: in the sense that we aren't really going to move the whole, the market a whole lot on
473.32s: our own accord.
474.80s: And it also opens up the ability for us to trade other kinds of options specifically that
481.40s: institutions can't even find their way into because there's not enough total open interest
486.76s: to support their volume.
488.52s: That is not so much the case for us as retail traders.
491.56s: We can pretty easily navigate into those things, especially if you are really small trader
496.20s: trading single lots.
498.04s: Another example is trading activity requirements.
501.72s: There are a lot of imperatives for institutional traders depending on what institution we're
507.76s: talking about to actively engage in the markets.
510.56s: A great example of this is a market maker.
512.88s: They have to make markets and there's certain constraints on how often they have to make
517.64s: markets, which is a really high percentage of the time.
520.56s: Well the problem for market makers in that sense is if the market starts being bid in
524.12s: one direction and they have to keep taking the other side of that trade, they're actively
529.00s: disadvantaging them.
530.00s: They know they don't want to be on that side of the trade.
532.56s: And the other problem is as the other line going is going up, there's not an opportunity
536.44s: to offload the contracts that they're buying.
539.24s: So they're just building this massive inventory that they really don't want to hold and they're
545.80s: actively selling options in this case, maybe selling calls into something that's just
550.56s: persistently going up.
551.96s: That sucks.
552.96s: Now, don't worry, you don't have to break out the violence for them, they're doing just
556.68s: fine.
557.68s: But one of the best assets of a retail trader is the ability to do absolutely nothing.
564.36s: There are plenty of instances where there can be days, multiple days, even weeks where
569.96s: you might choose to abstain.
573.84s: And you always have that choice.
576.48s: There is no imperative for you to maintain a certain activity level that is a benefit
582.60s: that you have that is not the same across the board.
586.48s: Another is entry timing.
589.32s: Going back to that example with Warren Buffett, if he's trying to put on and use his
594.32s: over $100 billion of cash, the time that he gets into things is super important because
602.68s: he knows it's going to take him a while to build the entire position that he wants.
606.96s: And as he's trying to build his position, retail traders like us can see it.
612.00s: And we know that there's a high likelihood of a continuation of the build out based on
616.36s: the order flow proceeding.
618.12s: So what this means is as a retail trader, we never have to be the bottom tick or the
622.60s: top tick.
623.84s: We can follow the broader institutional momentum and literally ride the coattails.
631.36s: You do not have to pick the top or bottom, which is really difficult to do if you've ever
635.60s: tried it.
636.76s: We get to just follow the trend, follow the waves produced by the large institutions.
643.60s: That's a benefit.
644.60s: Another portfolio level directives.
648.80s: If you take a look from the CFA and we explore something like an investment policy statement,
655.36s: a lot of institutions, again, and varying capacities will have specific rules about what they
659.96s: can and cannot do.
661.44s: Going back to the market, make a example.
663.24s: They have to make markets and certain amount of names for a certain percentage of the
667.32s: time.
668.32s: If you're talking about a hedge fund, they're going to have a certain approach that they
671.68s: can take that their investors essentially sanction when they're putting their money in
676.56s: the fund.
677.96s: All traders don't have that.
680.00s: The portfolio directive is whatever you want it to be, whenever you want it to be it.
687.64s: Let's say, for example, with the recent market, things are going down.
690.36s: Let's say you were long tech for a long time.
693.36s: Guess what?
694.36s: Q, Q, Q.
695.36s: The ETF cannot do right now.
697.04s: It cannot become short tech.
699.00s: It's essentially long, not just tech, but dominant.
703.16s: They don't just get to change what they're doing.
704.64s: Now that's the ETF provider.
706.32s: But again, depending on the institution, almost all of them have certain rules.
710.24s: Now there are close end funds and stuff like that that really have a complete open world
715.08s: available to them.
716.60s: But in general, this is one of the benefits you have as a retail trader.
721.68s: And the last one, this one's actually pretty interesting if you think about it.
727.16s: It's the fact that really there's no evaluation criteria for you.
731.72s: Your job isn't dependent on your ability to earn a certain sharp ratio.
739.60s: This is also why you see things like hedge funds and mutual funds commonly slightly underperforming
746.08s: the market.
747.24s: It's not because they don't have the skill setter the capacity to outperform the market.
751.68s: It's because that in order to outperform the market, the risk that they take is not worth
757.80s: it to slightly outperform the market as compared to if they grossly underperform, then
762.88s: they look terrible.
764.56s: So they're actively evaluated against those kinds of performances.
767.92s: And this allows retail traders to actually trade things that might have an ugly path,
773.92s: might have big drawdowns along the way.
775.84s: For example, Nvidia's down pretty big right now.
778.36s: And let's say that you bought it at the top.
780.16s: Well, if you are a fund manager trying to get clients and you're coming up on a quarterly
786.44s: out brief of your performance or a monthly out brief, that puts you in a pretty disadvantaged
791.00s: spot because you're like, well, you have to explain that to people.
793.88s: Whereas you can just say, man, I'm actually just going to buy more and video might go down
797.36s: for the next year.
798.36s: Who knows?
799.36s: But I think with AI in the long run, it's going to make sense.
801.72s: So this is another benefit you have.
805.12s: Now the key component here, those that you have to come up with your own, because if you
809.84s: don't evaluate yourself at all, the probability of you underperforming is very high.
814.60s: You still have to be your own boss, but you get to decide the rules that you're going
819.80s: to play by and how you're going to evaluate your own performance.
824.20s: So maybe you don't really care that much if you have super volatile returns as long as
827.88s: the max in the total return is overall strong.
831.52s: That's a choice you have.
833.08s: So there are not a lot of advantages.
835.60s: There are some and you got to lean into them.
837.88s: Be an outlier.
838.88s: See you later.
