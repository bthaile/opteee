0.00s: Have you been here before?
3.40s: Or have you been here before?
6.00s: Or here?
7.80s: Or here?
9.30s: This video is about managing options positions.
12.84s: The whole idea is to walk through what's going on in these scenarios because they all
18.76s: have elements in common.
21.76s: So this person's asking what I don't understand is why I am still down considerably, even though
29.00s: this stock nearly recovered.
32.00s: This person says if I leave the option as is will it mean that it will expire worthless
36.04s: and I don't have to pay anything?
38.32s: This person saying I need help with an exit strategy on my 20 contracts of GME.
44.16s: And then this person is waiting for the dip to then buy more for this hype.
51.48s: Here's what's going on.
52.64s: These are all people that are not carefully thinking through what they're doing ahead
59.06s: of time.
60.06s: And as annoying and as boring as that sounds, that's where money is made in trading, is
67.98s: by being very thoughtful about what you're trying to do so that what you do over the long
75.24s: run makes sense.
76.24s: Let's dive right in.
77.64s: The first thing we need to start with is some context.
80.76s: This is a study that you should absolutely look at.
83.52s: It's called the behavior of individual investors.
85.60s: It's by Barbara Inodeen.
86.92s: I reference this all the time.
88.32s: It's an old study.
89.32s: It's from 2012.
90.32s: However, there are two things I really want to draw your attention to.
93.44s: These two right here.
95.00s: This study is about the behavior of individual retail investors or traders.
101.28s: It applies to both of the groups.
103.40s: And they find a bunch of specific habits that sabotage them.
109.24s: These two are important for you and for this video.
112.40s: The first one is the tendency to sell winning investments while holding losing investments.
119.60s: This is called the disposition effect.
121.56s: We enjoy the experience of booking a win.
124.80s: It affirms our ego.
126.80s: We were right.
127.92s: We also like making money.
129.20s: Who doesn't like that?
130.72s: The process of taking a winning trade down is so easy.
134.28s: And you've also probably heard a lot of really bad information like nobody goes
139.08s: broke by taking profits.
140.72s: Yeah, you actually can.
142.60s: You actually can.
143.60s: And I'm going to show you how.
145.28s: So it's not so much about any one individual trade.
150.64s: It's about a system of trades.
152.76s: The process that you follow, which we'll talk about.
155.80s: The second component here is naivery enforcement.
159.04s: This is where we essentially repeat behaviors that we enjoyed and avoid behaviors that we
165.60s: don't like.
167.32s: So a behavior like losing a position and closing a losing position.
171.84s: That sucks.
172.84s: So the propensity is going forward to avoid doing that or the process of really going
178.32s: through in depth and analyzing what you're doing.
182.20s: That's another painful process because you're going to see a lot of things that you're
184.76s: doing that you may not like.
186.92s: And guess what?
188.56s: It's still part of the process.
189.76s: It's still part of this entire thing that over time pieces together into being a profitable
196.72s: trader long term.
199.24s: That's the goal here because if your goal is to just try to maximize any one individual
204.52s: trade, the overwhelming probability is you're not going to be good at this long term.
209.52s: And it's because it takes a process oriented approach to create success in trading.
214.64s: If you have a streak of winning trades, if you have a streak of winning trades for five
218.04s: years, that still doesn't matter.
220.92s: It doesn't matter unless you're going to stop at the five year mark, take your chips
224.36s: and walk away.
225.36s: Then it mattered.
226.68s: But if you're going to continue trading and you built a bunch of bad habits, you can
230.16s: still lose all of that money you built over five years.
235.16s: Let's dive into how to not lose that money.
239.48s: So there's a couple of things I want to highlight.
241.68s: This is from a deck that I've been building kind of a reference deck, but I really want
246.08s: to draw your attention to these components.
247.92s: This is the decision cycle realistically as it applies to managing an options position.
253.16s: The first thing is managing a position based on profit and loss, meaning you should have
258.84s: defined profit and loss targets.
261.92s: If you have a position that hits either of those, then it's time to manage or at least
265.68s: evaluate the position.
267.84s: Does the individual position still align with your portfolio objectives?
273.20s: So what this looks like is if you're overall bullish in the market and you have a position
277.16s: that's bearish, does that position make sense?
279.96s: Maybe it does.
280.96s: That sets some of your long deltas.
282.64s: Maybe it doesn't.
283.80s: Maybe that position is morphed over time into something that doesn't align or fit with
289.20s: the broader portfolio.
290.76s: But this is the second step.
292.40s: The third step is have you been in the trade long enough, meaning your thesis is disproven
298.40s: or is it coming up on an expiration cycle where it's time to manage your trade?
304.36s: So there's two different examples in here.
306.40s: The first one is if you buy an option and you're coming up on an expiration cycle, maybe
311.72s: you still want the position to be on.
313.12s: Your idea is still intact, but you're now at the point where theta decays really accelerating.
319.48s: Maybe it's time to adjust that position based on the time that you've been into the trade.
324.04s: Or you might at the onset of your trade say, well, I'm waiting for a breakout in stock
329.80s: X, Y or Z.
331.40s: And once I get that breakout, then I'm going to manage my profit here and my loss here.
337.12s: But if you're trading options, they all expire.
340.36s: So you can't wait for a breakout indefinitely, even if you're an investor.
344.52s: If you hold a stock that's going sideways for long enough, there's an opportunity cost
349.00s: to tying up your money in something that's not moving.
353.08s: So time is really important.
355.76s: The last two decision points is there's some sort of new event coming up that forces
361.96s: you to think about your position differently.
365.00s: So if you're looking at something like GameStop and you know that it has earnings coming up
369.76s: on the 4th of September, that's an event.
373.32s: So if you're building options positions in this, you have to know that this is coming
377.92s: up.
378.92s: And you have to decide whether or not you want to hold through earnings, which tend
383.20s: to be pretty volatile.
385.16s: It could also be just broader news that's come out.
388.24s: For example, maybe small caps hasn't been performing well and you've been fading small
393.88s: caps.
394.88s: But then this past weekend, after there was that assassination attempt and now the market
400.52s: is attempting to price in the probability of somebody that's more market favorable in
405.48s: general and the eyes of the market coming into office against the now changing rate expectations.
412.52s: And then all of a sudden, your position starts going the exact opposite direction.
417.04s: There was a series of events that started triggering different market behaviors that you
421.92s: should be aware of.
423.76s: Because for example, maybe on the 11th, when we first started getting glimpses of the
429.24s: rate picture changing, maybe when this happened, it might not have hit your profit or lost
435.00s: target just yet.
436.00s: But if you're trading this to the downside and you see this big gap up and this new changing
441.36s: event, you now have to revisit your thesis.
445.84s: Does this new event, does this time in trade, does my portfolio disposition do any of those
452.80s: inputs impact my trade thesis or require an adjustment?
458.12s: So now the question is, how do we know?
461.20s: How do we know when we're looking at profit and loss management?
465.08s: How do we know if it makes sense to close a trade down?
467.12s: Well first and foremost, this needs to be decided before you enter a trade, not while
473.08s: you're in it.
474.08s: The reason for that is when you are in a trade, you have risk on whether you are close
479.88s: to a robot seemingly emotionless or not, you still have subconscious processing and you
485.16s: know from what we talked about way back here that you are fighting a lot of innate behaviors
491.76s: that are baked into your psyche, baked into your biological processing.
495.36s: The way that human beings view commensurate risk and rewards once a baseline threshold
501.60s: is sustained is different.
503.32s: We don't view them the same.
505.00s: It's literally a psychological underpinning from your long standing biology based on survival.
511.40s: So punch line to all of this figure it out before you place your trade.
517.80s: It doesn't have to be resolute and there are different things you can do while you're
520.60s: in the trade, which we'll talk about.
522.48s: So this very first concept I'm going to share with you is that of expected return.
527.40s: Now remember back towards the beginning of the video that I outlined that you can have
532.52s: a system that performs really well for a long time.
536.88s: So in this example, I'm showing you a system that has 190 winning trades, just 10 losing
542.22s: trades.
543.38s: The total number of trades there is 200.
545.20s: So you have a 95% chance of winning in just a 5% chance of losing.
552.32s: Yet, if we look at this system, it can still be not profitable.
558.76s: How could that possibly be?
560.48s: I'm going to show you.
562.56s: If you have an average win size of $10, you might say, well, that's not a lot at all.
567.40s: Yeah, well, you're winning all the time.
569.24s: You're probably not going to win a bunch of money if you're winning all the time.
572.52s: This is the example of take your profits.
575.20s: Take your profits quick.
576.20s: Don't be greedy.
577.20s: Sounds really smart.
578.20s: Don't be greedy.
579.20s: You're not supposed to be greedy.
580.20s: So there's a psychological component of not doing something that's looked down upon
583.56s: by society.
584.88s: And you're also looking at something and thinking that, oh, yeah, I'm being sophisticated.
588.68s: I shouldn't be greedy.
590.08s: That means this should work in my favor.
592.24s: Wrong mindset entirely.
593.92s: Really you should be taking good risk reward trades.
598.92s: If you have of those 10 trades, your average loser is $190.
604.24s: You can then have 10 trades that come up to a total of $190 on average.
610.40s: You are now flat.
612.76s: You've made 200 trades and you are flat.
616.04s: This is not including opportunity cost of your money.
618.44s: This is not including fees.
620.04s: What I'm demonstrating to you is that you can absolutely have a massively high win rate.
626.40s: You can have a bunch of winning trades and a handful of losing trades can undo literally
633.24s: all of them, every single one of them.
636.08s: So this is why expected return is so important.
641.12s: We can use this to guide our decisions when we're placing trades.
645.84s: So now I want to look at an example with you.
649.00s: Let's take a peek again at GameStop.
651.08s: You want to get into these 30 calls that are at the money that are 31 days out.
654.76s: You can do that.
656.40s: You look to get into them for about $4.35.
659.68s: They're a 57 Delta.
661.32s: So let's analyze that trade.
662.52s: It looks like this.
663.84s: So how can we figure out what our expected return is?
667.32s: It's very simple.
668.88s: What you need to do is figure out where you think this thing might go to the upside
673.40s: and where it might go to the downside and the corresponding probabilities.
678.56s: So let's figure out how to do that.
680.60s: If I take a look at a chart here and I'm just analyzing GameStop.
684.92s: Maybe I think that there's a floor here based off of this one July swing low.
690.28s: And that floor looks something around 23 and change.
693.40s: Maybe I can scoot it up a little bit because there's three of these candles here
697.40s: and you want to manage your risk kind of quick.
699.56s: So maybe you're looking at something just shy of 24, 24 ish.
703.76s: That would be your downside management.
706.08s: You are determining ahead of time based on your technical analysis or whatever tools
710.08s: you like to use that if you see price fall in this case below 24,
714.84s: you're going to exit to the downside and book a loss.
718.24s: So we're defining things.
719.96s: Where do we think it might go to the upside?
721.76s: That's hard to tell, especially with something like GameStop.
724.32s: But as I look at this, it seems like there's not a bunch of overhead resistance.
729.04s: So maybe we target something around this.
732.36s: But if you want to be conservative, you could pick something kind of in the middle.
736.20s: So in this case, 35 bucks, something like that.
738.76s: It's above this previous high.
741.44s: It's something that's based off of elevation above this consolidation period.
746.56s: It's above the high here, slightly.
748.92s: And it's giving you a little bit of room to run,
751.80s: but we're not targeting highs necessarily because you may or may not get there.
756.44s: This is a conservative estimation.
758.40s: So using 35 bucks, target to the upside, 35 bucks, target to the downside is sub 24.
765.68s: So now what we need to do is figure out what the trade would be worth at both of those points.
772.68s: So if we look at 35 bucks, that'll give you about $350 profit.
779.88s: If we look at $24 to the downside, that'll give you like negative 263 ish.
785.36s: So in this case, I have a smart at a $341 profit to the upside,
789.96s: given that target that I just shared with you.
792.60s: And then to the downside about 265.
795.20s: But you'll notice that there's probabilities in here.
797.00s: How do I figure out these probabilities?
799.36s: You can use options, the cool part about them.
802.24s: So we can take a look either at something called a risk profile.
807.92s: You can use a tool like this that analyzes probabilities for you.
811.08s: This is just using the options, Shane's.
812.60s: And I'll show you in the options as well.
814.28s: Don't worry.
815.28s: But we can take a look at the probability of touching.
817.52s: Why do we not need in the money out of the money?
820.28s: Well, because if we're planning on managing when price gets to those levels,
824.60s: the probability of a touch is higher than the probability of expiring in the money.
828.84s: And if you don't need to take it all the way into expiration,
832.60s: then you don't need to use the lower probability.
834.60s: You can use the realistic probability of a touch.
837.04s: So we can go to our expiration cycle, which is about 30 days out.
841.12s: I think we're looking at the 16 August, which are right here.
844.20s: And we can say, what's the probability of hitting our profit of $35?
848.76s: And it is about 64%.
851.96s: What's the probability of hitting our loss of 24?
854.80s: Just south of 24 realistically.
857.36s: We'll call it like 25.
860.44s: Let's go sub 24.
863.52s: We'll pretend we're get out below that.
864.84s: It's like 70% now.
866.56s: So it's actually a little higher than when I first made this video.
868.76s: It was 65%.
869.76s: So we'll keep it as this, but that's what you would do.
872.48s: Now, if you don't want to use the risk profile tool, that's cool.
876.88s: You can also use the options.
878.64s: So you can take a look at the options, Shane.
881.36s: And you can say, well, you're buying the 30s.
883.24s: That's OK.
883.76s: But what's the probability that we touch 35?
887.20s: And you can take a look literally right here at the probability of a touch, 64.5%.
892.68s: Typically speaking, the probability of a touch will be about about two times the delta.
899.40s: It does not work in very volatile products, right?
902.64s: Because the delta here is a 44 delta.
905.16s: So that would be 88% probability of a touch.
907.64s: So in normal products, you can do that.
910.72s: So to give you an example of this, what it would look like in something that's a little
913.84s: bit more normal, if we take a look at this 40 delta call in IWM, same expiration 31 days
922.40s: out, the 40 delta, two times that is 80.
925.40s: The probability of a touch here is 73.32%.
927.72s: Right?
928.72s: So it's close.
929.72s: But in something like GameStop, that's volatile, very volatile.
933.56s: It's not going to be as accurate.
934.80s: The other thing to know about using delta is a probability of something being in the
938.92s: money or a probability of touching is the further out in time you go, the less accurate
944.24s: it is.
945.24s: I have an entire video that dives into this.
947.28s: I'll link that in the notes below.
948.76s: Delta is a probability for those interested.
951.16s: So just know that delta can be used shorter term time frames, less volatile products.
956.12s: Anything other than that, it's very inaccurate.
958.40s: And it's going to negatively impact your calculations, which are important calculations
962.72s: that we're doing.
963.72s: The next one, we need to figure out the probability of touching the 24s by 31 August.
968.48s: And you can see actually from the options chain, it mirrors more similarly to what I
972.56s: had in there.
973.56s: So these are at 22 delta, two times that would be a 44% probability of a touch, but it's
979.48s: actually 63.14%.
981.68s: So you notice these are close enough, right?
984.28s: This is based on when I took it a little earlier today.
987.20s: So now we can calculate what the expected return is on this opportunity.
992.32s: So the expected return is $45 in 99 cents.
997.04s: So why is it?
998.40s: Why is this positive?
999.40s: Why do we have an R multiple of 1.29?
1001.64s: Well, because even though the probabilities are pretty close, they're very similar to
1005.74s: one another, this, you have the probability of making more money than you're going to
1009.48s: lose.
1010.56s: So even though this might be a lower probability trade, it still can yield a little bit
1017.52s: more of a profit potential.
1020.20s: So we need to continue through our example.
1025.24s: So there I attached to you, the expected return, here I attached to you the R multiple.
1033.52s: This is the exact process you can take to evaluate an individual trade.
1038.84s: This is an individual trade.
1040.56s: As I outlined before, it is important to do this for an entire system of trades.
1046.68s: So for example, that's when you build your process, when you're buying options and you
1051.48s: say, okay, well, I'm not going to do 31 days to expiration because they, they did
1054.84s: case too fast.
1055.84s: So I'm going to go further out in 60 days and you codify what you do.
1059.80s: That's the process of building a strategy.
1061.84s: I will link a video in the notes below on this process of building a strategy so that
1068.24s: then you can bake this component of managing options, positions and expected return into
1073.72s: that process.
1074.92s: So you have a comprehensive approach that is much more likely to yield success than the
1081.08s: haphazard process of buying random ass options.
1084.72s: The last thing I'm going to throw in the notes below is a video on buying options smarter.
1089.12s: I continue to push that video because I think it's so important for people to see it.
1093.84s: I see all the time people talking about, well, I don't want to buy the forties because
1097.24s: I don't think it's going to go to 40.
1098.84s: What doesn't matter if it goes to 40?
1100.16s: If it goes up, you start to make money anyways.
1102.80s: That video goes through all of those kinds of details.
1105.20s: As always, any questions, let me know.
1107.76s: Be an outlier.
1108.76s: Share with your friends.
1109.76s: See you guys later.
