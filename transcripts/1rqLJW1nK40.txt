332.00s: you
360.00s: you
362.00s: you
390.00s: you
420.00s: people think about trading something like that.
421.96s: My guess is for a lot of people in the game stop community is probably just buy and hold
426.60s: dollar cost average, which again, that's not about answer.
431.40s: That can work just fine.
433.00s: But I'm curious what the idea here is.
437.92s: Reggie says sell when it gets above 25.
441.12s: So Reggie talked to me when it gets above 25 do you mean that you're selling shares that
446.96s: you had bought before and then looking to get back in or do you mean something else?
452.84s: Okay.
453.84s: So calls above 25 got it.
454.84s: Okay.
455.84s: I could see that.
457.44s: Lawrence says bought the dips.
459.92s: I think that generally makes sense as well.
463.52s: And again, if I were to guess what the majority of the game stop community that does
469.36s: trade something like this would do, it would be that.
473.08s: It would be some form of just accumulating.
476.44s: And the reality is accumulation there, it's not bad.
481.08s: But there's something that we have to pay very, very close attention to when we're doing
485.44s: some sort of accumulation phase.
487.40s: And let's work through this together.
491.32s: Again, my hope at the end of the stream today, I don't have anything planned.
495.76s: This is all just stuff that I'm kind of thinking about as I'm sitting here looking at this
499.56s: with you guys.
501.36s: My goal at the end of the stream is for you to at least walk away with a couple
506.08s: tools in the toolbox for trading something like GameStop because GameStop is extremely
513.08s: unique, extremely unique in what it is, how it behaves and how it can be traded.
521.40s: So I want to talk about that.
525.08s: Let's first just start with a scenario.
531.64s: Let's say we have $25,000.
537.52s: We have 25 grant and you decide that you're going to buy GameStop.
545.12s: Let's walk me through this.
547.96s: If you had $25,000 now, whether you have more or less doesn't matter to me, just step
553.68s: into this scenario with me.
557.56s: If you had $25,000 right now and you were to build a position in GameStop, what would
565.88s: the position be?
567.60s: And for context, GameStop's current price is not a nickel.
571.56s: We're going to call it 2160.
575.40s: So we're going to call Spot Price 2160.
583.64s: So what's the move here?
586.44s: How are we thinking about doing this?
590.76s: We have our position allocation is 25 grants.
594.40s: Spot Price right now is $21.60.
597.72s: What do we think?
599.84s: TCM says at this level, I would buy January 2620 calls.
605.56s: Okay, so we could take a look at that.
608.24s: So we have January 2620 calls and would you use the 25 grant there?
614.00s: Is that the move?
619.20s: Brian says $12.50.
620.64s: Does that mean that you would buy $12.50 worth or what's the scenario you're thinking
626.48s: Brian?
628.48s: Reggie says buying shares under 22 is a great entry to just buy shares.
633.16s: Okay, great.
634.16s: And Reggie, for your trade of this $25,000 were below 22 right now.
643.56s: So what do we think?
653.52s: Do we use the 22 or do we use the 25?
659.04s: Okay, or do we use some subset of that?
662.84s: What do you think?
665.68s: I want to walk through this in detail because I want to show you guys a few things.
670.92s: And hopefully it will be useful, I think it will.
675.20s: Now the first thing is, okay, so TCM would effectively use the 25.
683.80s: So we have one scenario where we are 100% allocated or utilize, sorry.
693.16s: We have one scenario where we are 100% utilized.
697.28s: So this will be 100% of the position.
703.16s: Reggie says, I go all in at this price given the floor.
706.00s: Okay, so we have two, so we have buying these with 100% and then we have buying all shares
713.80s: with 100% capital.
720.76s: Okay.
724.36s: So let's talk about it.
727.96s: TCM says I like short puts here, but I think upside is greater at this level.
732.12s: It's a great topic which we'll talk about as well.
737.64s: First things first, if I were to build a position here in GameStop personally, this
745.84s: is what mine would probably look like.
750.28s: If I have $25,000 to use, the first thing I'm going to do is eyeball where are we in
757.88s: relative ranges.
759.80s: Over the last three years, we are up a handsome amount still about 115% from the presquees
770.32s: lows.
772.04s: Now a lot of stuff has changed.
774.92s: So we can see that there is kind of a new proverbial floor being priced in.
779.56s: However, that floor got challenged pretty massively because it used to look like the floor
786.80s: was around here.
789.16s: And then we've just recently cracked below that 22 handle.
794.00s: So now we find ourselves closer to like this 20 and a half handle floor.
799.04s: So the first thing I'm saying to myself is how confident am I in this 20 and a half handle
807.16s: floor, meaning that generally speaking, GameStop would be broadly disincentivized from
815.04s: going below 20 and a half.
818.64s: That starts to get into a lot of fundamental analysis and stuff.
821.96s: That's worth your consideration broadly, but a little too time consuming for here.
827.32s: So what I'm doing instead is I'm just using some prior benchmarks.
830.48s: I'm going back and I'm seeing that price here was sub 20, not that long ago.
836.76s: Here it's sub 20, here it's sub 20.
839.64s: Again, a lot has changed, but this is still sub 20.
844.16s: So if I were to ballpark, where do I think like a true floor might be?
852.16s: You could use the intrinsic value of the company, which I actually don't know what that
856.68s: is right now.
857.68s: I'm going to ask, rock.
859.52s: I have no idea what the actual intrinsic value is.
861.84s: What is the per share intrinsic value of GameStop stock?
869.64s: Let's see what crox is.
873.00s: The reason why I'm using this is in my mind, I need to come up with some sort of calculus
881.48s: on how I want to scale because one thing I can tell you that I would differ greatly from
886.40s: everybody so far is that I would not use 100%.
889.68s: There's no way I would use 100%.
892.68s: And it's because as soon as you use 100%, you are now stuck and even a rudimentary search
903.16s: of recent history shows that this thing going sub 20, although I instinctually would say really
915.32s: unlikely, doesn't mean that it can't happen.
918.96s: And more importantly than that, it doesn't mean that if it did happen or some version of
924.08s: that did happen, that it couldn't happen for months, just like you saw here where it literally
928.80s: just went completely sideways, effectively for an entire quarter.
933.56s: So I wouldn't want to be stuck there because the risk that we run, if we use 100% of
940.32s: the money and then it does take a bit of a step down, well, now you're kind of in a little
945.80s: bit of a sticky scenario.
947.84s: And again, I'll show you why.
949.40s: You've essentially handcuffed yourself in terms of what kind of basis adjustment you could
955.16s: get.
956.56s: Okay, so let's see.
959.00s: So, Brock says, it looks like a bunch of them are saying $35 a share.
969.40s: A growth exit DCF model is at 1873.
975.00s: That sounds more correct to me.
977.16s: A projected free clash free cash flow model guru focus.
981.36s: I don't know who that is.
983.16s: 759, that seems really, really low.
986.40s: And then base case scenario from Alpha spread, don't know who that is, says 466.
990.80s: That also seems just obviously way too low.
994.00s: Because even though the company is not cash flowing massively from sales and stuff, it still
998.80s: does have a pile of cash and it has a lot of cash.
1002.68s: So I don't think those like single digit estimates are correct.
1008.52s: Like my gut says something high teens low 20s.
1012.92s: That would be my expectation of a potential floor.
1015.88s: And again, I'll show you why this matters to me.
1019.12s: Because if I'm thinking about how do I want to set up this position?
1022.96s: Well, the first thing is it really two years out where that is.
1029.48s: Anyways, what I want to do is see how much money can I use here based on my confidence
1038.48s: interval that it might have some sort of downside move and to what level.
1045.36s: Guess what we can use to help us.
1048.40s: Options.
1050.04s: Now before I get into doing a little bit more of like this detail analysis that I'm
1055.40s: explaining to you, this is my gut reaction, my gut reaction before we validate anything.
1064.16s: Is that I would probably want to target utilization around 80% right now.
1071.12s: That's closer to where I would be.
1073.88s: So that 80% utilization gives me three octo.
1079.68s: I'm just kidding.
1081.52s: It's all formatting.
1083.12s: It gives me 20 grand to use.
1086.40s: Now of this 20 grand, I need to figure out how I want to split this up.
1090.80s: Now for me personally, even though the equity here looks like a good value and it is,
1098.08s: I wouldn't want to be mostly equity here.
1100.32s: Why not?
1101.52s: The reason is because when you trade equity, you make money when the thing goes up.
1108.64s: If it's not going up, you don't make money.
1112.40s: And if it goes down, lose money.
1115.80s: Right now it's going down.
1118.88s: And also again, if I had bought 100% here when it was 23, and then I had gotten out effectively
1129.48s: before the next earnings on that quarter, I would be about flat.
1132.48s: I would have made nothing, but I would have tied up that money for an entire quarter.
1138.40s: Now again, the one thing I want to make sure that is exceedingly clear to everybody is
1144.88s: that I'm a trader that means that I'm trying to maximize price fluctuations and spend less
1153.60s: time just holding things and waiting.
1157.60s: There's nothing wrong with holding things and waiting.
1160.24s: So if somebody says, well, I'm an investor, why would I do this?
1164.12s: You wouldn't.
1165.12s: There's no reason to do this.
1166.12s: If you're an investor and you like to stock long term, beautiful spot to get in.
1170.20s: Literally a beautiful spot to get in.
1173.08s: But if you're not that in your somebody that's like me, where I'm trying to generate
1177.52s: capital and make a profit even when it's doing stuff like this, that's my world where
1184.24s: at the end of this quarter, if I bought 100% of my capital here, and then even if I got
1191.52s: the move to here, right, let's see what return on that money is.
1195.64s: Even if I top-ticked it, that's 19%.
1198.60s: I would have made a 19% return on the capital over the course of five months almost.
1207.32s: So if I break that out to a per month return, it really is not great.
1211.52s: It's a fairly poor return for a more speculative trade like this.
1216.28s: So I'm just giving you my lens for the trading side, which is very different from the
1221.20s: investing side.
1222.36s: Okay.
1223.36s: Now, we have 20 grand to use again.
1226.40s: I'm going to validate these numbers.
1227.88s: I'm just literally giving you my gut feel, and then we'll see how close it is to what
1232.64s: actually makes on this.
1234.04s: So of this 20 grand, I need to split this up.
1236.96s: There's essentially three ways that I would play this.
1241.84s: The first way is with a coverage triangle.
1244.56s: Within the coverage triangle, there's going to be short puts and long stock.
1250.00s: This is the base position.
1253.12s: This would be the main position that I would have on.
1257.84s: I need to figure out of this 20 grand, how much does this get?
1263.32s: Now, again, my typical instinct, I would be probably 15 to 17.5, something like that.
1274.16s: So let's call it 15.
1277.16s: 15 grand.
1279.84s: This is going to get $15,000.
1284.44s: The last strategy that I would use here is long calls of some short of some sort.
1290.56s: Notice how I didn't say ratio called diagonals.
1293.36s: If you're not familiar with the words that I'm saying, they're just different option strategies.
1298.72s: Now, a ratio called diagonal simply is an options version of a covered call with some minor
1306.76s: tweaks.
1308.08s: But I wouldn't do that here.
1310.16s: Why?
1311.16s: Because I kind of have this already.
1312.60s: And this is already generally serving that purpose.
1315.96s: The purpose of a ratio called diagonal is to decrease your gamut exposure, decrease your theta
1322.48s: exposure, and have something that's a levered stock position.
1326.20s: That's kind of where we're at here.
1327.96s: So no need to duplicate.
1330.88s: So for the long call of strategy in general, what am I looking for?
1334.56s: I'm looking for really aggressive moves.
1338.36s: What's the issue with long call style strategies in something like game stop?
1343.48s: The issue is that if it does go into a squeeze, which in my opinion, it is not primed in
1349.76s: any way for right now, I can't see anything that would leave me to believe that, then
1356.20s: if it does find its way into a squeeze, my ability to actually exit my calls and make money
1362.32s: is really challenged.
1364.28s: And it's because of how much volatility comes into the market.
1368.92s: So I actually wouldn't be looking to wait the long calls that much, especially during a
1377.00s: squeeze.
1378.00s: During a squeeze, I want to be in the equity way more liquid, way more liquid.
1383.96s: And you stand a much better chance to get a decent price on your exit.
1389.44s: Now that doesn't mean that I wouldn't use long calls, I still would, and I did during
1394.28s: the prior squeezes.
1395.44s: There's still something there.
1397.40s: But it's really important to note that based on the price of the thing that you're
1400.96s: trading, you're giving up a lot.
1403.24s: And the market is taking their pound of flesh because one thing that really rattles market
1409.40s: makers and other liquidity providers is that as soon as things go just absolutely ballistic
1415.76s: haywire, that's a massive risk scenario.
1419.08s: So they're absolutely going to charge a premium with respect to liquidity because like, there
1425.68s: are some on the line now.
1427.40s: And they're taking legit risk.
1430.92s: So what that means is a lot of the times that I'm going to be using this long call
1436.04s: capital is very, very specific.
1439.36s: So how do I become really, really, really efficient?
1445.44s: The way that I would go about this personally is I would actually bump up how much the
1450.72s: coverage triangle gets.
1453.28s: And I would be prepared to pair this back down to 15k immediately in order to allocate the
1462.36s: $5,000 to the long calls.
1465.48s: But just because the long calls are going to get allocated $5,000 doesn't mean that I
1472.00s: immediately going to employ it here.
1474.68s: In this case, I probably wouldn't.
1476.52s: So what does this all summarize to?
1478.48s: I probably be closer to like $18,000 here and about $2,000 here.
1484.92s: Ish.
1486.24s: Now we still have another problem set to solve, which is for of the $18,000 that's going
1492.76s: into the coverage triangle.
1494.64s: How much of this is in short parts of short puts versus long stock?
1501.04s: As I mentioned before, right now it's at a really advantageous price.
1505.56s: So that means that I don't want to have no stock.
1509.08s: But it's also going down.
1512.44s: So if I buy stock and I buy too much, then I'm eating up the capital that I have to
1518.68s: improve my basis.
1520.64s: Now for an example, really quick on what that looks like.
1525.32s: Let's say we have the $25,000.
1527.92s: And let's say that we use $20,000 when the stock is at $2160.
1535.20s: So this is going to cost us.
1538.00s: Well, this will get us.
1539.36s: Sorry, this will get us 13 July shared.
1543.32s: I like that a game's given me fucking date.
1548.04s: It will give me 926 shares.
1552.52s: So this is spot, this is shares.
1556.76s: Now let's say that game stop then goes down to 20.
1564.16s: And when it's down at 20, I'm going to want to grab some more probably because I already
1568.24s: used some.
1570.20s: And let's say when it gets to 20, I use another $25,000.
1575.80s: I use the $25,000 box.
1579.72s: I get four May shares, also known as $120.25.
1587.96s: That's going to be like the new autistic way of having to come up with a share count
1593.28s: is by doing this.
1600.44s: So it will cost so far here.
1606.36s: This gives us our per share basis.
1611.00s: Let me make this.
1615.60s: Makes sense.
1620.20s: 21 in change.
1623.20s: 21, 41.
1627.00s: What's the problem so far?
1630.00s: The problem so far is I use 20 grand and I got in here, which is good.
1639.48s: But then when it drops down to 20, and I use half of what's remaining, I get 125 shares.
1648.32s: And I've reduced my basis from 2160 to 2141.
1657.88s: And the reason why I don't love that is because I moved my basis minimally less than 20
1664.12s: cents.
1665.36s: But now I have very little capital left.
1668.92s: So then let's say that it does go to 19.
1672.12s: I use the rest of my money there.
1676.20s: What do we get?
1678.32s: We get 132 shares there.
1681.52s: Our basis now is at 1903, which is actually not bad.
1686.20s: But I want you to notice something.
1689.40s: Notice how many shares that we got here compared to here.
1694.76s: It doesn't seem like a lot.
1696.04s: It's only seven more shares.
1698.52s: But this is what I call units and actually building inventory.
1705.88s: When we're talking about scaling and we're talking about the use of the limited capital
1710.36s: that we have, if we're very strategic about when we deploy it, we can create
1716.16s: the maximum effect, the maximum impact to our portfolio.
1721.20s: The risk here is that if you're not aggressive enough in your initial utilization, you're
1726.36s: not going to use enough money and you're going to miss out.
1729.08s: If you're too aggressive, then you miss out on future opportunities if it does have some
1735.36s: sort of larger down move, which now leads to a beautiful tool that we have to help us understand
1742.76s: what's the probability of this different stuff happening.
1745.68s: And we use the options chain.
1747.72s: So if we go into the options chain, and let's go out 69 days because it's a fun number
1755.08s: to 16 Jan 26.
1757.56s: What I can do is I can literally look at the probability of touching different numbers.
1764.04s: So the probability of us touching the 21 strike is about 50, 50 and a half percent over 50
1772.36s: percent chance that we get there.
1775.16s: At 20, it's a 43 percent chance.
1778.76s: At 18, it's a 29 percent chance.
1783.48s: At, I'm sorry, these are probabilities of in the money.
1788.24s: So we got a shift over one more column.
1791.20s: This is the probability of these options expiring in the money.
1795.52s: I was wondering why these seem a little too low.
1798.68s: Probability of touch is a little bit higher.
1800.80s: So anyways, what I'm doing is.
1802.28s: I'm figuring out like, where's the 50 percent chance?
1805.68s: The 50 percent chance is this 18 handle.
1808.88s: There's right now a 54 percent probability that we will touch 18 before 16 Jan 26.
1819.40s: It's a much lower probability that we will expire there, but it's a pretty good probability
1823.76s: over half chance that we touch it.
1827.96s: That matters because when I'm figuring out where I want to scale the rest of this capital,
1835.64s: that helps me determine what would make sense because let's say in my mind, I'm like,
1840.04s: well, I want to make sure that I have money in case it gets down to 10, right?
1844.32s: Just picking a number.
1845.64s: Well, what's the probability of this thing getting to 10?
1848.52s: The probability of us touching 10 is less than 10 percent because this number is wrong.
1855.88s: This is because the bid out spread is blown out.
1858.72s: The accurate.
1859.88s: You could just follow the general trend here.
1861.72s: It's probably like 10 to 11 percent.
1863.72s: It's exceedingly low.
1866.20s: So if I did that, I've now positioned myself in all likelihood to just not use money that
1875.44s: otherwise could have been used at a generally advantageous point.
1880.68s: The last thing that I want to make sure that you guys keep in mind with respect to something
1885.60s: like scaling is this effect here that I was just explaining in terms of building units.
1891.04s: The beautiful part about when a stock does continue lower is you can accumulate more units relative
1901.04s: to cost cheaper per share, which means that you don't need to save as much money to scale
1910.32s: in as it's a little bit further and get an even more meaningful adjustment to your basis.
1915.36s: Let me give you an example.
1918.28s: Let's say we first buy $20,000 worth of 2160.
1922.68s: And let's say when it gets to 21 or I'm sorry, when it gets to 20, rather than doing
1928.76s: 2500 bucks, it gets 500.
1932.60s: Wait less.
1934.00s: And instead, we tell ourselves, I'm going to wait to scale in more heavily when this gets
1940.96s: closer to 1918 something like that.
1945.68s: Then let's say it does get to 18 or so.
1951.04s: As it drifts down towards 18, now is when you can say, well, at this point I have 20,500
1961.20s: used.
1962.20s: So you are running at a capital, but you still have something left.
1966.96s: You still have 26 April capital left, which is 4500 bucks is those keep in score at home.
1976.80s: We're getting close to what seems like the proverbial floor based on the pricing here.
1983.16s: At this point, rather than coming in too light, maybe we come in a little bit heavier.
1989.24s: Maybe we come in at like three grand.
1991.76s: This gets three grand.
1993.64s: What do you notice this does to our total position?
1998.04s: It really allows us to start scaling.
2001.80s: Now this is artificially low because we need to add this number as well.
2008.08s: But it brings us down over half a dollar compared to where we were before.
2013.40s: Why does all this stuff matter?
2015.08s: Because if you do have long shares and you do want to sell some calls against your shares
2020.76s: as the underlying might be oscillating sideways, you want to be able to sell your,
2026.40s: you want to be able to sell calls at a solid basis against your basis without potentially
2034.04s: locking in a loss.
2037.32s: What I mean by that is if you sell short calls against your shares and the strike for your
2043.96s: short calls is lower than your stock basis, you now are potentially
2050.68s: locking in a loss, which is a problem.
2053.88s: All right.
2055.12s: So we have some intuitive understanding of this idea of scaling.
2059.52s: We also have hopefully an intuitive understanding of what my position or my general approach
2067.16s: might look like here to finish this out in terms of short puts versus long equity for
2073.36s: the current utilization of this.
2076.04s: I would say maybe it's like 40%, 40%, like essentially split it or so.
2082.68s: So that means that I would get nine grand and nine grand.
2091.32s: The way that I would reconcile this is I would set some points of interest.
2097.40s: So let's go back in time.
2098.72s: Let's literally go back in time.
2100.16s: Let's go to 12th of June and let's play some of this and I want to play out some of
2107.24s: these different scenarios that we just looked at.
2111.48s: Let's go into on demand and we need to go to 12 June.
2114.88s: Now, before we start this exercise, what questions you guys have so far?
2119.60s: Is there anything that we talked about that's unclear?
2122.32s: This is a completely completely chill space.
2125.44s: So even if you think it's something stupid, it's not.
2129.12s: Let me know whatever it is.
2131.12s: Okay, David says, would it be smart to use half and by warrants instead of call options?
2137.28s: I would not.
2138.72s: I would not do that.
2140.08s: The issue with warrants is that there is a decent probability that they're going to end
2146.36s: up out of the money like a pretty good probability.
2149.96s: So I that's not the route that I would go personally, but it's not a bad idea.
2154.76s: If I wanted to play that kind of upside and effectively have a call like exposure,
2158.64s: I would just use calls versus the warrants.
2161.56s: On let's say, would you consider crazy beta slash ADR stocks mean?
2166.80s: They're like rocket ships.
2168.80s: Really, I would potentially either growth stocks or meme stocks really.
2172.80s: That again, like I genuinely use the term meme stocks in the pure sense of things that have
2178.36s: just a really strong social media following where there's memes made about the stock, like
2183.60s: that kind of thing.
2185.12s: So whether it is or isn't, it might share to your broader point some of the same profile.
2190.60s: But if not technical meme stock, then I would happily consider something like that just
2195.84s: a growth stock, which can have the same exact behavior as meme stocks.
2201.40s: Another thing to remember is that there's a lot of stocks that experience gamusqueases that
2206.16s: aren't meme stocks and it's not mutually exclusive.
2210.12s: So yeah.
2212.64s: Uber, what up?
2214.32s: Zuber says, do you think iron condors and put spreads are safe strategies?
2220.80s: I mean, by definition, they certainly are safe, especially if you size them appropriately.
2227.96s: But the problem is, is like, safe doesn't equal profitable.
2232.80s: And a lot of times people will safely lose a lot of money.
2238.24s: So I would personally worry less about safety.
2243.84s: And I would focus more on, does this thing do the thing that I want it to do?
2248.32s: In terms of like, what risk do I want to take?
2250.28s: What risk don't I want to take?
2252.40s: And does this provide like a healthy return on the risk that I'm taking?
2258.44s: Because otherwise, for example, in something like this, if you're trading put spreads or
2263.08s: something like that, you're kind of defeating the purpose of what you're trading.
2266.12s: You're better off trading that in something that has much greater relative vol compared
2272.20s: to historic moves.
2274.48s: So yeah, objectively, I would consider them safe if they're set up appropriately, even in
2280.72s: iron condor for those that don't know.
2282.36s: That's an iron condor in an index is the position that had the largest percent drawdown
2289.40s: on my portfolio, even to this date that happened like five or six years after I started
2295.72s: trading was a while after I got into trading and I'd spent a lot of time learning.
2299.16s: So there is absolutely even scenarios where something that we might consider safe can still
2306.36s: cause issues that absolutely cause issues for me.
2309.44s: That was a really wide iron condor in the rut.
2313.60s: So they certainly can be safe, but that typically leads to just losing money or underperforming
2319.72s: a benchmark.
2321.16s: And they can also be made unsafe for sure.
2323.64s: I can definitely give you my own experience and testament to that fact.
2330.04s: Omlet says they're really hard to break out trades, so I want to look at options.
2334.84s: They can move like 10x in days.
2337.08s: Yeah, the issue with a lot of stuff like that is, yeah, so and I would even consider some
2343.40s: of those that you're listing definitely meme stocks.
2345.48s: Because I've seen them in the lists, right?
2347.52s: Like O and D S for sure, iron for sure, open for sure.
2351.88s: Like a lot of those I think do qualify.
2354.44s: But yeah, there's definitely a lot of stocks that exhibit a tremendous amount of volatility,
2359.44s: which again is one of the superpowers of something like GameStop.
2363.84s: So let's continue the example.
2367.44s: Let's map out the 100% equity position.
2371.68s: GameStop right now is 2253.
2374.72s: That's the price that we're working with.
2377.24s: And we're going to keep the same total allocation at 25 grams.
2386.16s: That means the 100% equity position is going to get 1109 shares.
2396.80s: And then these calls were about 70 days to expiration.
2401.56s: So let's find closest to 70 days here.
2405.12s: So this will put us in the 15 aug.
2406.84s: That's the the commensurate for doing the 26 Jan 20s.
2411.44s: And GameStop spot price now is what like 20, right?
2415.44s: So this would be like at the money or 21.
2418.00s: So it's like a dollar in the money.
2420.20s: So that would put us at like the 22's.
2424.60s: That gives us $3.35.
2429.84s: So this will be the 64 DTE options, which are what is this 15 aug.
2442.48s: And we're going to do the 22 calls.
2444.24s: We'll know you're a dollar in.
2445.92s: So the 23 calls.
2447.44s: I'm sorry, the 21 calls.
2452.00s: Sometimes I'm an idiot.
2454.84s: That gets us.
2455.84s: So grab those for $3.88.
2462.48s: That means we can get 64 of those.
2476.88s: You get 64 of these for $3.88.
2481.80s: This is the current spot price.
2484.24s: This is the current lot size.
2486.56s: This is this current price.
2488.92s: Again, this is the entry at 2253.
2492.20s: What I'm going to do is help us explore these different scenarios.
2497.64s: And then the other short puts, the short puts would actually do well in this scenario.
2502.80s: So we'll track these as well.
2505.96s: And let's say we did a standard 30 delta that puts us at the 20.
2510.96s: There will be a dollar 60 credit.
2513.84s: But what did I say?
2515.72s: The 20 strike.
2517.88s: So those are the 20 puts.
2523.68s: We'll do these.
2524.68s: I'm just going to do them in 15 aug just to make this all easy.
2527.76s: Realistically speaking, the way that I would maximize the income from the put side, or
2532.68s: I should say the P and L from the put side, is by selling on maybe like 20 days out.
2537.64s: Definitely not this far.
2540.16s: Fuck it.
2540.76s: We'll just do the the more realistic scenario.
2543.40s: Let's do like these.
2548.40s: 30 delta here is the 21s.
2550.40s: So that'll get us the 21 puts or those 21 puts.
2555.20s: We are going to get I'm going to call it a dollar.
2560.00s: And we're going to cash secure them just to simulate likely.
2566.16s: Most people's accounts.
2570.24s: So we take this divided by this times 100.
2576.92s: That gives us 12.
2580.20s: It gives us 11.
2582.48s: Can't round up.
2587.48s: So we have 11 of these 21 puts that we sold for a dollar.
2595.04s: Okay.
2596.04s: And let's take a look at one other scenario using my general positioning that we outlined.
2604.68s: It's a little more complex.
2606.20s: I don't want to like make this super annoying.
2608.44s: So I'm just going to do it as the coverage triangle entirety.
2610.92s: Get rid of this short call piece.
2613.44s: Just to make it easier.
2616.72s: And let's say that they both get 10.
2619.24s: So the same effectively the same.
2620.92s: I'm just not worried about the other piece, just so that you can see how the the coverage
2624.96s: triangle would perform here.
2626.60s: So this is the CS example, I guess I can move this ear.
2634.80s: And this is the positions for CS.
2643.44s: Which is going to be 80% utilized.
2647.00s: And for this, we're going to get $10,000 of stock.
2659.56s: That's going to give us 443 shares.
2665.52s: These are also going to have race ratio short calls against.
2670.64s: That's literally a covered call, but we're going to sell the calls at a ratio.
2675.60s: So we're not going to sell.
2677.04s: Well, really we can't.
2678.64s: It has to be at a ratio because we we wouldn't sell five.
2681.96s: And if we sell four, we have 43 shares on cap, which is great.
2686.32s: And on the short put side, I literally would do the same thing as this.
2691.52s: Except it would be sized a little bit differently.
2695.52s: So for the sizing on these puts.
2700.24s: We have.
2705.52s: We get four.
2711.12s: Okay.
2713.28s: Right now, we are comparing three different positions at the same time.
2719.60s: The positions that we are comparing are first covered triangle.
2728.04s: Second, being 100% equity.
2733.08s: Third, being long calls.
2737.32s: Fourth, being short puts.
2740.84s: Let's fast forward two weeks.
2743.64s: So we'll go from 12 to 27.
2747.64s: I'm going to be two weeks in a day.
2749.64s: And then we're just going to effectively manage like every two weeks on the Friday.
2755.24s: We're not going to like specifically time stuff for the example here.
2763.32s: We're not going to go through the whole duration.
2767.00s: I just want to give you a sense of what the P and L will look like for these different positions.
2774.28s: That's all.
2776.68s: Okay.
2777.32s: So the 21s are now trading for a nickel.
2781.96s: So these are at 0.05.
2787.16s: And again, you have 11 of them.
2790.60s: On the short puts, that means your total.
2798.04s: Let me add a thing here for total credit.
2812.92s: Your total credit was 1100 bucks.
2817.32s: And now I'm going to move everything over just like one or two.
2832.52s: For the short puts, the reason why I'm doing that is so that I can throw this in line to make it
2837.64s: easier.
2842.44s: And it's a
2851.88s: loss this.
2854.44s: I'm going to update it to be a negative.
2861.24s: Okay.
2861.72s: So you made 1045 in terms of a percent return on your capital.
2869.24s: This gave you
2880.12s: 4.52 percent return on a basic capital, not bad.
2884.44s: The 15 aug 21 calls that are now 49 days to expiration.
2895.24s: Those are now at 385.
2900.44s: I'm going to reorganize these so that it can make them a little more critical.
2920.76s: So these were the 21 calls.
2925.08s: We bought them for 388. We got 64 of them.
2931.32s: Now they're trading at 385.
2937.56s: So our total cost.
2942.28s: This times this.
2944.36s: 24,000 current value.
2961.16s: Is.
2961.64s: 10,000.
2971.32s: 10,000.
2972.44s: Not much.
2973.32s: Just like a few bucks.
2975.00s: We'll do the raw cost and then we'll do the current value separate.
2979.40s: So that's a little easier to see.
2981.32s: So this is currently.
2995.96s: Your piano.
2997.08s: You are down $192.
3001.48s: And then the last one really quick.
3005.40s: Or this position, which again, this would have some sort of short calls.
3010.28s: It's kind of like both of these combined, right?
3012.60s: For the equity side we're at 23, 9, 4, 3,
3016.44s: which again, the interesting thing here is that if you notice it actually went up a little bit.
3021.96s: It didn't go up much at all, but it went up a little bit from where we started.
3027.32s: Yet as this thing went up for where we started, the long calls lost money because of theta.
3034.76s: This thing is oscillating sideways, which is hurting this position.
3039.00s: Now your equity position will be doing a little bit better here.
3045.08s: And it's just because it's chilling.
3048.20s: Your equity position doesn't really care that much.
3052.60s: Your equity position made 1567.
3057.48s: So decent move here helped out your equity position.
3062.68s: And your put position is again up 1050.
3071.48s: And then the one thing we have to go back in time for really quick the other direction back to here
3076.44s: is I want to get the short call details just because that will be useful information.
3082.60s: And then for this for the coverage triangle,
3084.92s: I'm literally just going to copy this part and size it appropriately.
3093.72s: So for the coverage triangle, we only got four.
3103.00s: For the short put side.
3107.96s: So these are the short puts.
3109.64s: This is long stock and then ratio short calls.
3113.64s: Because this one's going to have those three legs.
3116.04s: And we'll literally just do this like once or twice.
3119.96s: So the long stock details are effectively the same as the other.
3125.96s: So we got it for 2253.
3129.40s: That means we were able to get 443 shares.
3134.20s: Current price is 2394.
3140.60s: That leads our P&L on this part to positive 625.
3151.00s: So the thing that I want to show you so far without adding the ratio short calls against this
3158.28s: is this position is at 1000 and 5.
3162.12s: So it's underperforming the short puts raw.
3165.64s: It's outperforming the long calls raw.
3169.32s: And it's underperforming the equity, which is exactly what I would expect.
3175.00s: Now for the short calls, we'll put ourselves close to like a 3031 delta somewhere in here.
3181.08s: That's going to give us a $1.53.
3183.72s: So that is the 30 handle.
3188.52s: So this will be the 30 call.
3191.00s: And those are currently priced.
3194.28s: I said at $1.53.
3198.84s: We can do up to 4.
3201.00s: I wouldn't do 4.
3202.20s: I would do 3 of them or so to give the trade a little bit of room.
3207.40s: And then now we'll fast forward and see what they're worth.
3210.52s: Oh no shit, fucked up.
3212.04s: That's the rolling exploration my bad guys.
3215.56s: These would be in the same exploration as these puts, which is like the 3 July.
3221.80s: What's is that get us?
3224.28s: That puts us at like the 26, which is 99 cents.
3230.04s: So 26 call, 0.99 and we get our 3 still.
3234.52s: Okay, now I confess.
3242.44s: All right, so now in 3 July, I'll see what those calls are at.
3247.56s: That's the last part.
3248.60s: Those are at 14 cents.
3251.24s: 0.14.
3254.20s: That's what we're going to have to buy them back for.
3259.00s: So we have this plus this.
3262.68s: Times this times 100.
3268.28s: We get 250.5.
3270.12s: So the net P&L just because this has additional line items for this strategy is 1260.
3278.44s: So here's here's what's happening thus far.
3282.76s: The equity position, the 100% equity position outright,
3289.16s: bought 1109 shares at 2253.
3293.72s: The spot price at our check here is at 2394.
3297.48s: That leads to a P&L of 1567, like really, really solid returns so far here.
3304.60s: The puts are 1045.
3308.68s: The calls are showing negative 192.
3314.28s: And then the covered strangle as it sits right now is again 1260.
3323.08s: So the reason for this scaling protocol being designed as it is is as the underlying oscillates
3334.92s: and finds different prices what we can do is slowly buy more as this thing is moving around.
3344.04s: Because one of the things that's really, really important to know is that these other strategies
3351.08s: are using all of the money. This one isn't.
3356.92s: This one got 1260 using 20 grand. So the return on invested capital here
3364.52s: compared to the others is 6.3%.
3368.44s: The return on invested capital here is 6.3%.
3377.64s: So the thing that I want you to pay close attention to is this strategy even though it's slightly
3385.32s: underperforming in terms of gross dollars, it got the same exact return on invested capital
3392.60s: except it's using less money. So what's the benefit to that? The benefit to that is if
3398.92s: game stop does start to retrace down a little bit, this strategy can do something about it.
3406.68s: This strategy cannot. This strategy can just sit and wait. So let's just see really quick what price
3414.12s: we might want to scale in the short puts at and we'll do the same exact exercise before. We'll go
3421.00s: out a few months. 12 is fine. It's a little far so we'll do like 49 days and we'll find where
3427.80s: the probability of a touch is just over 50%. That takes us to the 21. So that means if we hit 21,
3434.20s: we're going to scale in. That's effectively the protocol. So what I'm going to do is fast forward
3441.24s: like a week or two really quick. I just want to see if it hits anything close to that handle
3446.44s: and then based on that, I just want to show you that that scaling piece so that you can see what
3452.92s: what it would do. Now again, the thing to keep in mind is I just fast forward two weeks. One of the
3458.60s: differences is that the P&L here would be whatever the P&L is at the end of this duration.
3465.16s: The P&L in this will be improved and it's because it's going to have another layer of this trade
3473.40s: and this trade, which again, I can show that to you really quick just so that the example is
3479.24s: based on pieces being left out of the equation. My goal is for you guys again to have like a
3489.32s: pretty clear understanding of what this thing actually looks like. So I'm going to go back really quick
3495.80s: through the 27th and I'm just going to re-establish the positions that would belong in this one.
3501.80s: I'm going to skip with the short puts one for now just because it literally is baked into this
3506.68s: so we can track it there for ease so I'll kill that one but then we'll still look at this one
3511.40s: because it is a bit of a standalone strategy. So now for the short puts, though we would it took
3517.16s: those other ones down and now we're offering new ones. The 30 delts is at the 22 handle we get a dollar
3522.12s: seven. So 22 handle we need to figure out our sizing again, remember for the puts we get 10 grand.
3533.88s: So we need to figure out this divided by this times 100 gets us our size so we can do another
3545.16s: four for puts. So we get four of those puts out and we get a dollar seven for those.
3563.08s: Now the other thing I want you to notice really quick is you can kind of see how this is like
3567.08s: turning into a little thing that you can then build out, right? And it's literally something that I'm
3573.48s: literally just kind of building on the fly. They're it's not pretty at all but it generally does
3581.08s: the main stuff that we need it to. So it's a way to analyze stuff but actually have something to show
3590.84s: for it at the end which is like really, really useful so that you can make a decent comparison
3598.76s: as compared to what you just might happen to remember. Okay so that's the new put position that
3610.04s: went on. This is again the short puts. Let's take a look at the call side where we at like a 31 delta
3615.32s: that takes us to the 28 we get a dollar 10 for those. So 28 calls we get a dollar 10. We're going
3625.32s: to do three of those just like we did last time. And then our long stock,
3635.96s: lat, no change and now let's fast forward two weeks. That takes us to the 11th.
3652.36s: Okay. So this 15 August and I put stuff further out in time 49 days literally just to
3662.04s: make this a little quicker and easier. So now we're at 23, 725 and I'm going to fast forward another
3671.56s: week just to earn another two weeks so that this is closer in time I want to get us closer to like 20
3676.52s: days because that's when it would be managed. That takes us to what's our new spot price.
3691.88s: 2335. So again we're kind of like not doing anything 20 23 dot 35. So now we are about six weeks
3707.64s: into the trade six weeks in your return on the equity side is at 34% return on invested capital
3718.20s: 3.64% not bad for six weeks time but also again not blowing anybody's doors off.
3727.48s: Let's take a look at the 22 puts. Those are trading for 45 cents so we'll take those down. So
3734.36s: minus 0.45 we made 248 there and then let's take a look at those 28 calls those 28 calls are at
3743.24s: 45 cents. Wait did I fuck that up I think I did. Yeah 38 cents. So these are at minus 0.38.
3755.96s: So now what what do you see the first thing that you should see is that
3763.64s: the position itself is actually starting to outpace. The reason with this beginning to out�
3773.24s: pace is because this is still able to generate something while this is now again just kind of doing nothing.
3781.88s: It's waiting until there's hopefully some sort of uptick which just it happened but then we're
3790.76s: kind of oscillating sideways around that level. So now this thing is up 98 and again we still have
3798.44s: $5,000 in reserve. We've not used all of our money like this position just yet and let's check in
3806.92s: on the 15 August 21 calls really quick which is here. Those 21 calls those are trading for $2.70.
3816.04s: So you can see the issue with the calls is that they're they're just decaying. They're becoming
3824.44s: anemic because we're not getting the move that we want. This issue gets compounded for the long
3831.72s: call side of the equation because when you buy long calls and something like gain stop you're almost
3837.72s: always overpaying for fall and if it goes into a quiet period not only did we overpay for
3846.60s: fall but we're experiencing heightened faded decay because of it. This becomes a really challenging
3852.52s: positioning team. So this is probably where the long call buyer might choose to throw in the towel
3859.72s: take that $7,500 loss and prevent further loss. That would be the better decision here or they
3866.44s: could roll it out again and you know maintain exposure but we already know the future in this
3870.92s: scenario which would end up being suboptimal. The last thing I want to do really really quick is I'm
3877.88s: going to fast forward a bunch of time. I just want to see if it gets down to like that 21 handle
3882.84s: or anything close to that which is what we define as our scaling which it looks like it didn't.
3889.48s: It stayed in like the the 20s all the time. So in that scenario we would just be sitting pretty.
3895.32s: Not really using that residual five capital leaving it on the side or whenever you choose to
3903.08s: scale it. Now again for me a lot of times I would use something like this potentially to scale
3909.48s: in a little bit to play the poster and announcement drift with a little bit of a dedicated position
3915.00s: but that's a different story. So I'm going to pause there and I want to summarize what we've learned
3923.40s: hopefully and just again to give you more tools for the toolkit. GameStop goes through
3933.96s: pro-longed periods where it oscillates where it consolidates where it trends sideways with minor
3941.24s: movements. That leads to rapid erosion of long call trades across the board but especially
3949.72s: anything that's within 120 days makes it very difficult for those to make money.
3955.24s: Long equity allows you to capture big moves but in order to monetize big moves you need to sell
3968.04s: your shares. That leads to a timing issue for people. So for example with the stock at 27 that long
3979.40s: equity position would look good. So at 27 that long equity positions up like 19 percent.
3986.84s: But what's the problem? Well the problem in this scenario is the trade itself although is up
3996.04s: decent money it has the confounding problem of you don't actually get it. You don't get the money
4008.84s: until you sell. That's the problem with this position in context. Now again that's not like
4016.44s: the end of the world or anything but it is something that you have to pay attention to.
4022.04s: Because otherwise you can have instances where your equity position will be up handsomely
4026.76s: but unless you have some sort of timing protocol to monetize it and actually realize the money
4033.64s: if we fast forward to where we are now at 2095 and let's say that you did nothing. You just
4039.64s: held it. Well you literally went through a period where you were up 20 percent.
4046.84s: You are now how far is this? This is the 12th of June to the 8th of November.
4054.20s: Like you're a hot minute into this trade and at this point this position literally is nothing to show
4061.56s: for it. You don't even get a dividend here. Yet this position would continue to grind out a
4069.00s: profit of sort. Now the last piece that I said I wanted to show you is the scaling in protocol
4075.16s: and we decided 21. So I'm not going to cherry pick and say 2095 and pick the low. I'm going to say
4081.32s: that we scale in at 21. So with the underlying at 21 that allows us to buy how many shares.
4093.24s: We only have $5,000. So we don't have a bunch of residual capital to use here. So we have $5,000
4102.84s: remaining that we can use for something that's at 21. That means we can get 25 August.
4107.88s: Worth, which is 238 shares. The thing that I want you to pay attention to is this factor right here.
4115.40s: Notice how the underlying is a little bit cheaper, not much cheaper, a little bit cheaper.
4122.92s: But with it being just a little bit cheaper you can still see that the overall position itself
4131.72s: is still pretty damn strong. That means in terms of how much you were able to buy.
4139.48s: So I'm going to track the cost basis for this one and then for that one we need this to calculate
4146.52s: the rest of the position. And then I'll pause here for any questions. So if you have any questions
4153.24s: about any of this now is the perfect time to throw them in. So that's our total cost. This is our total
4161.80s: shares. This is our per share cost. 22. So you got the per share cost down.
4176.60s: Actually, like not too bad.
4195.56s: All I'm doing is finishing the rest of the metrics for you guys.
4198.76s: The thing that you'll see here is actually kind of important.
4204.76s: Which is this. Notice how being able to scale in makes a material difference. Not even in
4212.92s: terms of the gross P&L, again, extra using different amounts of money. But in terms of the actual
4218.76s: return on a vesicapital, we can see that we're actually dampening ourselves pretty significantly
4225.08s: by being able to scale in and by being able to drive our bases down. The last thing that I'm
4229.88s: going to show you on this really quick is if I were to try to sell calls, let's go a 41 days out.
4237.08s: In this trade, I effectively have to sell it 23. Here I can sell at 22 or greater. It's really up to me.
4247.40s: So at 22, you get a dollar 71 at 23, you get a dollar 41. Really, I would pick 23. So it's
4256.28s: no problem in this scenario. The problem becomes if it slips a little further down. Then this
4262.92s: slight difference can make a pretty big impact. So with this position though, over that course,
4270.36s: you can see that you're actually able to still generate an a net positive P&L. Again,
4277.40s: it would be net positive just because we only did two iterations of this. It technically would have
4281.56s: been way more iterations over that time frame. To summarize all of that, there's nothing wrong at
4288.84s: all with being 100% equity. But you need to have some sort of timing protocol. If not, you're just
4295.40s: holding stuff and unless you monetize it, you don't give yourself the ability to actually maximize it.
4304.20s: So what that might look like is something like this. If when it was at, even close to what it was,
4313.40s: well, let's just apply technical analysis. So it rallied, it rallied up here. So this is kind of
4318.52s: like your support and resistance. And then you get a firm close below. So let's just call it 2540,
4324.92s: where we might have gotten out, 25.4. That means that you would have generated $3,182. Why does that matter?
4333.24s: It matters because you started with 25. Now you just added 31.82. You now have $28,000 to do
4341.40s: something with that something can literally be by more shares. But now you have something to do with.
4347.64s: So for example, let's say that you saw this breakout and you wanted to start getting in here,
4354.28s: you could. Or let's say that you were like, okay, I think it's going to roll back over. I'm going
4358.92s: to wait until it's back at the point of control at like 2334. Whatever. What I'm going to do for the
4364.12s: scenario, though, is say at the same price. So the same 2253, if you got back in at that point,
4372.92s: the difference now is that you can get 1250. So the difference in your shares is 141 shares.
4383.32s: You can get 141 more shares now because we realized some of this money and then we used it
4393.72s: to then accumulate more shares. That's the other thing a lot of times people will do with this kind
4399.88s: of strategy and game stop, especially like the true ape style folks that want to build a big
4405.48s: stock position and hold it. You can do that. But if you do something like this to accumulate it,
4412.20s: you can literally buy, again, you made $380 here, you made $248 here. If we convert that to general share
4420.60s: price around that time, which is what 23-ish. So this divided by 23, you could have got 16 shares
4428.04s: with that and then you could have got 10 shares with that. So you could have got 26 shares across
4435.32s: this stuff by using, again, this other income source. This exists because game stop is so volatile.
4447.16s: It's why you get such good premium for the call side of the equation typically wouldn't
4452.92s: you also get it on the put side of the equation. That's super unique. This is exactly why I personally
4460.76s: am trading a coverage triangle in game stop. It's because it does this exact kind of behavior,
4469.24s: this exact kind of behavior for a prolonged periods of time. And the cool part is at the end of this
4476.60s: kind of scenario with the coverage triangle, I will still have a positive in L despite it going down
4485.00s: whereas if you're 100% equity, that's not the case. So if I look at the coverage triangle right now
4493.08s: that I have in game stop out of actual curiosity. When I started trading game stop,
4501.88s: it was at $29 for this example. This is part of the sample portfolio that I was sharing for a while.
4509.40s: It was at $29. So right now the 100 equity position, the 100% equity position is down 25
4522.52s: 0.86%. It's down 25% from where it started. My coverage triangle that I'm trading here is currently
4533.64s: up over 13%, 13.5% positive. That means that I'm outperforming the buy and hold equivalent
4545.08s: by 39.4%. Same thing, same time, same ticker, nothing magic about this approach. But this approach
4557.88s: differently captures one of the more pervasive elements of game stop that if you monetize it,
4567.08s: you can make a lot of fucking money. That's my TED talk on developing different kinds of positions
4575.88s: in game stop and how they behave against one another strategy.
4585.56s: What questions do you guys have? Lawrence says question with this strategy, what's the worst
4596.92s: case scenario and how do you manage it? I think technically speaking the worst case scenario would be
4603.40s: game stop goes in solving and it gets de-listed. Now the way you manage that is by just allocating
4611.40s: the risk to the trade that you are again realistically comfortable with that potential scenario. Now
4619.00s: if I were to apply a probability to that it would be low, I don't think that the probability of
4624.36s: game stop having that kind of scenario is super high. Now that said, if I were to think again
4633.96s: to give you some context in the military in the Marine Corps, we use two different enemy-based
4641.08s: course of action analysis. We have an ML COA and then an MD COA. Now the ML COA is the
4651.80s: enemies most likely course of action. What do we think is most likely to happen?
4659.00s: And then the MD COA is the enemy's most dangerous course of action. Again, so much of this
4665.88s: stuff from the Marine Corps literally applies directly to trading. So what's the MD COA? The most
4671.88s: dangerous scenario here is game stop going in solving and being de-listed. How do we manage that?
4677.80s: We accept it and whatever capital we put into the trade we acknowledge that that could happen
4683.40s: despite it being quite unlikely. What's the most likely scenario? The most likely bad scenario
4691.96s: is what we were just talking about at the beginning trying to gain some context on what the intrinsic
4696.68s: value might be. So in my planning factor that would put us in the high teams that would be the most
4703.96s: likely downside scenario. Again, with some severity added to it. So again, the way that I plan and
4712.68s: manage for that is first by what's the allocation? How much money does the position get? But then the
4718.04s: second is how much am I actually going to utilize? So again, in this case instead of using 25
4725.16s: grants, I'm using 20. And then of that 20, not all 20 is going into something that I can't adjust the
4733.64s: basis of, which is long stock without adding more money. I have that in something that I can adjust
4740.28s: the basis of, which is short puts. So it allows me to maintain spot price sensitivity as it goes down.
4746.92s: So you can see it's literally a layered management approach because there is also short calls.
4753.40s: These will make money if and as it goes down. So the entire position is really built in a way to
4762.52s: really be robust in those kind of scenarios. Rhinese says, do you ever do poor man's
4771.88s: coverage triangle? No, I don't. It could be done. The way that, like the closest version that I get into
4783.24s: stuff like that is a ratio call diagonal, but I don't really do a poor man's coverage triangle.
4789.72s: One of the most important factors for a coverage triangle is to be able to take a assignment.
4795.56s: One of the other most important factors for a coverage triangle is to be able to hold inventory
4802.44s: and wait because there can be prolonged periods where something doesn't look good. And this is actually
4809.80s: a prime example, right? Like if we did that poor man's coverage triangle using the long call position,
4817.24s: that's literally bleeding during this time frame. And that obviously performs completely
4824.36s: differently than this, which is actually still generating a net positive return if the rest of the
4829.00s: trades were calculated in here. So yeah, I don't do that. And it's just because they're very
4835.16s: different profit mechanisms that the strategies are built around. Personally.
4841.32s: Also, I just realized that it's not Brian. It's fucking brain. Sorry. And the emoji helped a lot.
4852.60s: In my mind, you're still Brian now. Unfortunately, excited. I'm stupid. And as soon as my brain
4858.04s: attaches that, now we're fucked. Resize in a massive up move, how might ACS underperform? It's a great
4868.20s: question. So let's take a look. I mean, it's not a massive up move, but let's take a look at this
4872.44s: up move. We can literally see how it would have done over this time frame. So I'll take as to nine
4878.36s: september and we'll re-establish a position and we'll literally compare it so that you can see exactly
4886.76s: how it would behave here.
4893.88s: What I'm going to do is I'm going to go with the assumption that we have not scaled in more.
4904.68s: So we still just have the 10 grand there. And then we have the call position and what not separate.
4913.00s: But what I'm going to do is add more short puts and what will literally trade this move so that you
4919.80s: can see exactly how it would perform. Just give me one second. I got to grab some water.
4950.04s: That last one there was Norway. Pretty six spot. Okay. So let's let's literally build a position
4966.76s: and let's see how it does. So we're going to go out 24 days again and then we're just going to
4972.60s: run in two weeks, two weeks snapshots. I'm going to move this off to the side for now so that I can
4978.84s: go a little faster. Let's let's do it. Okay. So here the 30 delta ish is like the 22. So that's why I would go for
4996.36s: so the 22. What is this divided by? One of my formulas got fucked up moving stuff.
5013.08s: Okay. So we can do four again. We're going to get $2. We'll get four of those. And then for the
5019.96s: ratio short calls again keeping us close to a 30 that puts us at the 26. So the 26 call
5031.80s: we're going to get 82 and we still have four and 43 shares. So we're going to get three of those.
5040.04s: So let's fast forward two weeks. So that takes us to the 23.
5050.28s: Active rehab says so no one hears long on game stop. No, that's completely incorrect. The
5055.16s: coverage triangle is is literally a long delta position. It's quite long.
5067.16s: Okay. So let's see what the short put did. We had the 22. The 22 is now down for seven cents.
5080.20s: And the 26 call is literally now in the money. It's in the money at a dollar 37. So this will
5089.88s: need to be rolled. Now one important note. One of the things that I will do if I have short calls,
5096.68s: but I don't want to unwind my inventory is either roll it or I will instead buy shares as it's about
5105.72s: to breach. But in this case, I'm literally just going to continue to unwind and put stuff back on.
5111.16s: So this one's going to come down for $37, which is a net loss of $1.65. Okay. Let's do one more.
5127.40s: Let's find our way out 24 days or so. And we can get to the 25 for 64 cents.
5135.88s: We can get four of those now with this recent up move. The way that my rule set typically would behave
5147.40s: would be to do less of these after that kind of surge. But I'm just going to keep the overall plan
5154.44s: the same. So these are 64 cents. They're also not getting enough money. They're getting about half
5160.20s: of what they were getting before. So these would actually get less. Those are going to get a two lot.
5166.04s: So we're going to use less, less total capital. I'm going to add a
5173.88s: hash secured element this. This times this times 100.
5183.16s: Just so that you can see what the overall
5184.84s: tracking is. Okay. And then for the call side of the equation, we have a 35 delta for 93.
5198.36s: So this will be the 29 calls. We're going to get those $37. I might get a little more aggressive
5207.56s: just because the last one's came down for $1.37. So I would take those to the 28 calls.
5213.16s: Those will go for a dollar and we can get three of those. Okay. So let's fast forward two weeks.
5220.04s: Well, I don't think we can go two weeks. Anyway. Yeah, we can. I got my fucking months fucked up.
5227.64s: My bed. Well, there's the 30th. Here's the seventh. I want to see if this is at the peak yet or not.
5235.48s: Okay. So that was at the peak. I'm going to go back and then I'm just going to take a look at
5240.60s: where everything's sat at the peak. So like right here. And then this way we can
5248.76s: make a direct comparison. So spot price right now is what 2684.
5257.24s: I'm just waiting for it to go. I think it might be a little higher. Let's see.
5273.00s: I also don't know why it says pre-buffering. Why wouldn't it just be buffering?
5279.88s: Okay. 26.9.
5281.96s: 26.9.
5290.76s: And let me show you where we're at so far. So this needs to be a sum of this.
5301.80s: Oh, no. That's my bed. That's not it. That's fine for now.
5311.16s: So this is the put. This is the calls. This is the underlying. So this is the variance in performance
5334.68s: on a pretty significant upmove. So this shows us we are down about 1200 bucks.
5344.04s: I compared to the long equity position. Now one of the things that is really, really, really
5349.88s: important to differentiate however is this is still open. So unless this was sold and you top ticked it,
5363.24s: meaning you sold it near the top, then this is the best case P&L for the long equity position.
5370.44s: But it's not realized. It's still open. So what that means is as this thing starts to roll over,
5375.32s: you're going to lose this. A big difference between this and the coverage triangle is that the
5381.32s: coverage triangle equity position is up 1900 bucks way less than this. But this is a small portion or
5391.00s: I guess a meaty portion, but not the entire P&L profile for this. So the difference is this 3677.
5401.00s: If I were to split this into realized and unrealized. So realized meaning you booked it,
5410.04s: unrealized meaning you did not book that P&L yet. It's still waiting to be realized.
5418.84s: Is your realized P&L here is 1742. Your unrealized P&L here is that 1935.
5431.80s: So one of the major benefits of something like the coverage triangle is it mixes these returns
5441.40s: which is very, very important because it means that you no matter what have actually booked profit.
5452.28s: And again, for context, this 1742 can be used to buy more shares.
5461.16s: This cannot. You can't buy more shares with this 1935 unless you close it and realize it.
5471.64s: So in the most recent example, this is the underperformance variance. It's about a percent
5482.44s: of the total allocated capital. In terms of a dollar amount, it's about 1200 bucks.
5491.40s: Is the difference. What's again, that's not insignificant. But in the broader context and the
5497.80s: practical application, I'm also full well aware to know that most people are not actually going to
5505.64s: realize that. Most people would have if they're trying to sell in time stuff. They probably sold
5511.24s: some of it on the way up. Let's take a look at a realistic cell scenario, just using a moving average
5516.84s: approach. If we use the moving average approach or a, let's just use the support and resistance
5524.12s: approach, whichever you want, if we did a moving average approach, depending on what moving average
5528.84s: you used, I'm just going to come out on demand to be able to see all of it quicker. If you use a
5534.28s: moving average approach, that would put you out really, they kind of coalesce on the same day,
5539.32s: which is nice because it gap down. So if you use the 10 day, which you would be in and out a lot,
5546.12s: or more commonly for like swing style, you use like a 20 day or so, this puts you at, let's just call
5553.80s: the midpoint of like 25, 64. So let's see in a realistic scenario, what that would look like.
5562.20s: Notice it's still outperforms as I would expect in this scenario. But that means that you got
5568.84s: stopped out at 25, 64 and you made 34, 48. In this case, again, you're still up about 3,100 bucks.
5578.84s: But again, a big difference is that there would be more of these positions on that would boost
5586.36s: this return slightly. So it's not a apples to apples comparison in this context. But what I'm
5592.20s: giving you is two different scenarios, at least to model that question. The first model is perfect timing
5599.48s: you top ticket, difference is about 1200 bucks. In this scenario,
5604.68s: accepting that you're using some sort of momentum following approach that's going to have
5609.32s: some lag to it. This one's making 34.50 and this one would probably be about the same,
5617.08s: realistically speaking with another iteration of these out that it otherwise missed for the example.
5625.16s: But just calling that as it is, this now underperforms by like 300 bucks
5633.80s: if you just stop doing the rest of the stuff. So that should give you at least some like actual
5639.80s: context on the performance difference during, again, like a pretty serious up move. That's like a
5645.56s: 20% up move in a relatively short period of time. From there, you can just model what it would
5651.32s: look like during much bigger moves for sure. Level says was this study using 45 DTE's now?
5662.28s: That 45 DTE's again is like a tasty trade artifact that I think is broken a lot of people
5668.44s: because 45 DTE's especially in something like this would actually underperform significantly.
5675.80s: The reason for that is because something like this that has so much volatility, you get paid for
5682.68s: effectively fighting gamma. But if you're trading something like a covered triangle, you really don't
5688.12s: care about the gamma risk because you have a defined playbook. Either you're going to take
5693.64s: assignment on the puts or you're going to roll them and same story for the calls. So a very,
5699.80s: very different, a very, very different playbook underway here. But it gives you a much more flexible
5706.52s: position as compared to like just wrote being out 45 days. If we just eyeball really quick,
5716.84s: again, for an example, let's just look really quick. 41 days to expiration is here.
5723.00s: Let's do the same position as super fast. So we have the 20s that you get $4 for. So you have the
5729.56s: 20 puts. You get those for $1.4. In terms of a return on a Vesic Capital, you get 30 December
5738.60s: or 5.2% which again, it's a really good return. But this is for 41 days.
5748.28s: If we look at instead where I was doing like 20 to 30 days, which would put us about here,
5755.00s: and we go to that same 30 delta, you're going to get like 56 cents for the 20.
5760.76s: So 0.56 for the same strike, which is the 20. 2.8% but again, this is for 27 days.
5772.20s: So then if you annualize these returns, this is going to annualize out much greater.
5781.24s: That's the reason for something using closer to 2021 days versus the more standard selling
5794.20s: duration, which people typically use something like 45 days. It's not as optimal as people think
5805.08s: it is, unfortunately. But it's just something that a lot of people have heard and then perpetuate.
5815.64s: It's not the end of the world, but it definitely is not. It's not optimal across all scenarios,
5823.00s: especially this scenario. Really interesting conversation, actually went a lot longer than I thought,
5831.00s: but I hope it's useful. Now, before I jump, anything else on this specific conversation,
5838.68s: I'm very, very happy to spend the time with you guys and to try to help. This is one of the
5845.08s: things that I'm very passionate about, especially with the the ape community is trying to help
5850.60s: reframe the way that things are approached to try and increase overall profitability.
5859.40s: Because something like GameStop is a very, very cool stock that a lot of people don't fully
5865.08s: appreciate how you can take advantage of it and still be involved in it in different kind of ways.
5874.04s: Lawrence is I'm still learning how to define risk and if I can't define it, I'm not comfortable
5878.60s: doing it. Yeah, I think that's fair. One of the easiest ways to define risk in something that you're
5883.64s: trading in terms of a price direction is just a touch of price level to it, which is the same thing
5889.48s: is defining the spot that you would be wrong directionally. So for example, in GameStop,
5895.16s: it's kind of like what we did before when I was trying to find what the intrinsic value was,
5901.32s: so then I could attempt to target what the floor is. Because at that point, let's say GameStop
5906.60s: starts violently going below that. Well, I would just take the loss at where I think the floor is,
5913.00s: where I think it won't go below. Because then if it goes below where I think it won't go below,
5917.16s: it means I miss something or something is materially changed. So therefore it's time for me to
5922.52s: reevaluate the trade, make adjustments if needed, but more likely than not get out and just
5929.08s: take the loss is what it is. So the most important part when it comes to being a trader and to
5934.76s: remind yourself is that you actually define what the risk is. Now again, there's exceptions
5943.00s: to that via gaps and stuff like that, but even in those scenarios, you still define the risk by
5948.76s: what you give the trade. You always have control over that. TSM says how to be less bullish. The way
5956.12s: that you hold on, let me clarify, TSM, do you mean how to be less bullish with the coverage
5961.56s: triangle? Or do you mean how to be less bullish on just the game stop itself as it's going through
5968.44s: down moves? Could you clarify that a little bit? Because I think, yeah, depending on which
5976.84s: angle you're approaching on game stop, you could really trade any number of things that become less
5983.40s: bullish. That becomes a factor of like what's the profit mechanism? So if the profit mechanism
5994.68s: is priced direction down, that's one approach. If the profit mechanism is just, I don't necessarily
6002.20s: think it's going to go up as much. That's a different thing. So TSM, in this scenario that you're
6009.00s: outlining, like what's the scenario you're thinking of? What's the hypothesis that you have?
6031.88s: TSM says I only trade GME, which is its own problem. It's not necessarily its own problem.
6037.00s: I mean to be honest, but it just, in this case, it depends on like what's the profit mechanism,
6042.84s: though. So when you're saying, when you're saying less bullish, what's the hypothesis then?
6052.60s: I mean, I just always think it will go up. So it holds me back from selling a lot of covered
6066.60s: calls price goes up. Well, now I'm confused. Because you're asking how to be less bullish, but
6073.80s: if your, if your bias is, you think price is going to go up, then I guess I don't understand that at
6078.84s: all. That seems like a mismatch, which is actually pretty common. But to zoom back out with
6086.84s: something like if it's going to go up, again, there's a bunch of ways to manage the short call
6092.52s: side of the equation. The first one is to do it at a ratio. The second is you can always buy shares
6098.68s: as it's starting to blast through your short call. You can always buy long calls as it starts to
6105.40s: blast through your short calls. Again, there's a bunch of things you can do to manage it, but
6112.36s: you have to have successful timing in management with those. Because if you don't do that,
6119.16s: then you find yourself in a scenario where you're just kind of holding something and losing money,
6125.08s: which is no good. Also, I realized that I didn't actually run the return on invested capital
6134.04s: formula for you guys, my bed. That is not correct.
6148.20s: Oh, because it's doing my bed. It's converting it out of a percent.
6168.76s: I think it's holding two spots at the same time.
6178.36s: Brain says TCM instead of selling covered calls, you can sell call spreads. Certainly wouldn't do that.
6184.52s: Because that, again, the call spread side of the equation really starts to break down the base
6194.84s: that you have. It's a really good way to start like legitimately locking and losses that are unnecessary.
6204.92s: Level says to put your positions on, would you target a specific delta here, like you've shown,
6209.64s: or would you as you support and resist as levels? It's a little bit multifactor in practical
6216.12s: application. A lot of it is based on really how I feel about inventory. Here's the way that I think
6223.88s: first is inventory second is what is it doing? In this kind of scenario where it's like
6229.32s: consecutively and pretty just consistently moving down, then I don't necessarily want to take on
6236.44s: inventory. I'm not going to be super aggressive with my delta's. I'll actually probably take
6240.12s: the delta's down to like a 20 delta or like a 30 delta maybe. If it's something that's like
6248.36s: rallying up like this, I would actually look to be more aggressive. Maybe like 35, 40, even 45,
6254.92s: 50 delta's. If it's something that's like rotating sideways like this, that's typically like a 35 delta
6261.56s: ish. So a lot of it is based on what the underlying is doing, but then the second overlay and
6268.36s: overriding overlay is inventory. Do I want to take shares on or not? That's a really, really important
6276.68s: put. Brain says I'm so confused. Yeah, let me explain I could see how that comment could be confusing.
6284.12s: So let's take a look at a P&L diagram. Maybe this will help a little bit. Let's say that we have
6294.68s: a thousand shares of game stop. I think get rid of the
6300.52s: so we're going to pretend we have a thousand shares of game stop. Let's say that we sell like a 30 ish
6311.00s: delta call against. Let's say we do it at like a 50% ratio. So this is what the ratio covered
6318.20s: called does. Now let's instead do the, let's do the call credits bread and we'll short the 25
6333.00s: and we'll go what like $2 wide maybe? Something like this. And let's just compare these scenarios
6340.04s: against the long stock. And again, we can do like five of these. If I run five of these
6347.24s: and let's say that the underlying does go down to like 2040s or just as 5% down move because
6354.84s: it's already price-themma's a little easier. At this 5% down move, the P&L for my position is down 11,
6362.84s: 24. In this scenario, my position is down 1020. So the big thing that's happening here is I'm
6371.32s: offsetting much more of the position by having more of these calls that are effectively at their
6377.80s: full size. Now the trade-off here is if there's some sort of big massive up move. Let's say that it
6383.32s: goes to 30. At 30, this makes 5860. At 30, this makes 7911. But what's the big difference? The big
6395.00s: difference is that with this, you're going to realize the loss. With the short calls, you don't
6402.36s: actually have to ultimately realize the loss. You can roll them. So you will realize losses along the
6408.60s: way that eventually will pay themselves out. And I'll show you what that looks like really quick
6415.32s: before I got a hop off. Let's go here to again the 9th of September. Here. And I'm just going to
6425.24s: short like an at the money call so that you can see how this effectively plays out. If I sell,
6432.84s: well, let me wait till the options to gain updates. And then I'm just going to literally track it here
6440.04s: so that we can, yeah, it goes. Okay, so it's all good. So I'm going to do something at the money and
6447.00s: I'm doing it at the money on purpose so that we can actually sell it perform. It's like a dollar 65.
6453.40s: So that's the 24 call. We're going to get a dollar 65 for selling it. Now, if we have the
6464.20s: all credits spread in the same scenario, the thing to keep in mind for that call credits spread is that
6469.64s: it's going to lose. It's actually going to lose and then that's all there is to it. But in this
6474.84s: scenario, it's a little bit different. So let's go fast forward a week.
6477.88s: With the underlying at once it loads. Again, I kind of want to try to like top ticket. I want
6491.88s: to get is close to the peak as we can, which I think this is pretty close. I think it peaked out of what
6496.28s: like 27. Yeah, this is close enough. So I'm just going to call it 2680 or I'll just call 27.
6502.68s: But here the 24 call that's going to come down for $2.98.
6513.72s: Okay. So our realized P&L here, her contract is 10 June.
6523.40s: Whoever can guess what that actually is.
6530.52s: Something's fucked up. What's fucked up?
6539.96s: What the fuck's going on here?
6541.88s: What's up?
6547.96s: It'll math from Marines, order of operations, something something order of operations, whatever the
6554.04s: fuck that means. Okay. So here we lost $133. And let's say for the same credit spread $2.
6565.08s: Wide it would have lost like a hundred in change or really whatever that is.
6570.52s: I don't really remember what it was. We can check really quick just for the sake of the example.
6575.96s: Let's say that the credit spread went out here at the 27.
6580.20s: Yeah. So you got $22 for something that's $2. Why? So this is $2. Why? You collected 0.22.
6589.16s: That means your total risk is 31 December of risk. It's so funny.
6600.68s: Is a dollar 78. That's your total risk. 178 bucks. So this in this case at the 2728 it wouldn't have
6609.56s: gotten realized. It doesn't really matter. I just wanted to give you a sense of the size of stuff.
6615.08s: But now let's go back here really quick. And then I just want to show you instead with those
6622.36s: call credit spreads what you can't do is roll them. You just have to establish a new one.
6628.52s: But the problem is with the new one, you're not going to get a lot of money. You're only going to get
6634.20s: that 20 sensor that 20 30 cents. So when you lose on this one, you're losing 178 bucks.
6642.84s: When you win, you're getting 22 cents. So what that means is your risk to reward ratio here is
6650.04s: quite skewed. You need 7 January of these, which is 8. You need a win eight of these. So that's the
6659.16s: problem with that. Now comparatively, really quick. Let's take a look at what this short call could be.
6667.48s: So the short call came in for $2.98 and it was realized at $133 loss. Now that means I need to get
6679.40s: a dollar 33 at least in order for this thing to make money. So I can actually get that right here.
6687.08s: So I can get a dollar 39 by taking it to the 27. So here's what happens in this rolling
6694.76s: option scenario. What I've done is I've moved my basis from 24 to 27 over 10% change in my basis.
6705.72s: I'm going to get a dollar 39 for this. That means that my net P&L here is going to be very little,
6714.44s: but it will be something. So now let's fast forward two weeks or so. And then this will
6721.40s: get us to kind of the the heart of the example. I think we have to go a little bit further.
6727.00s: I'm just going to go into the standard expiration in October. So let's see now what these calls are
6739.24s: trading at. The 27s, they'll effectively be worthless. But I just want to again show you the
6749.88s: difference in these scenarios. Okay. So the 27s are completely flat. There's zero.
6761.08s: So what that means is in this scenario, again, you didn't make much, but the important thing
6768.60s: is that you didn't lose money at the end of it. You actually made six bucks. Why does that matter?
6774.76s: Well, the reason why that matters is because if you lost on your $2 call credits bread,
6781.72s: you lost a dollar 78 or 178 bucks. Again, not the end of the world. But the difference is,
6790.12s: if you then put another one of these on over that timeframe in order to start making some of your money
6797.80s: back, you would have made 22 cents or 22 bucks. So what's your net profit here in
6807.32s: really it's this minus this. So you still lose money. You still actually lose a decent amount of money.
6826.20s: So this trade net, which again, this includes adding another call credit spreads to try to
6835.24s: make some of that money back, a fuck the order of.
6854.36s: You lose 156 bucks. That's the difference. So in this scenario with the naked, it's not even
6862.52s: naked with the covered call. You're able to manipulate it so that you get out at a slight profit.
6868.68s: Again, it's not about the profit here. It's that you walked out and you didn't lose net net overall.
6875.64s: In this scenario, you did lose net net overall. That's the big difference. And that's why
6882.36s: in something like this, I actually would not sell a call credits spread versus the ratio covered
6890.04s: calls. I would just keep the ratio closer to what you want it to be. And then manage the short
6899.96s: call side of the equation because again, this didn't make a bunch of money. But if you look at the
6906.52s: the difference between these, it actually made a decent amount of money. Made a hundred and sixty
6913.72s: two dollars more than this one. That ultimately matters. So that's why I would avoid the
6921.64s: call credits spreads. And instead just focus on management of the ratio, short calls part of the
6927.80s: covered triangle. This is an overview of some of the different ways that you can trade something
6937.32s: like game stop. The main thing that I hope you take away. And genuinely, I normally don't
6942.76s: mention this. But like I really hope you guys share this video specifically with people that have
6949.72s: long equity positions in here, simply to give them information on different ways they can manage it.
6957.56s: That doesn't mean have no long equity position. This covered triangle has a long equity position.
6964.52s: But it's a way to monetize the rest of the factors of game stop, which make it so unique.
6970.76s: And it's so that at the end of the day, you can still buy more inventory if you so choose as
6978.44s: compared to this. So a lot of people do this and they don't time it well and they don't have much to show
6986.12s: for it. The people that do this typically are just lighting their money on fire. This is one of the
6993.40s: more optimized methods to trade something like this. There is a downside where if there's a
6998.28s: massive short squeeze, you're not going to be totally exposed to it. But it doesn't mean that you can't
7003.40s: get exposed during the move. You can still adjust things and move things. But it means that in the majority
7012.84s: of instances for something like game stop, you can still make money from it. If you have questions,
7017.72s: you can hit me up in the discord, be an outlier. See you all later.
