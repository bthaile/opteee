0.64s: what's up outliers let's talk about how
2.32s: to literally revolutionize your trading
5.32s: with reframing the way that we think
7.92s: about how we're placing positions we're
9.92s: going to talk about profit mechanisms
12.04s: this is just a framework in a way of
15.04s: thinking that I've developed over my
17.16s: last 18 years in the markets nothing
20.56s: you're going to see here is novel
22.36s: revolutionary secret proprietary this is
25.44s: all just basic stuff that most of you
27.68s: probably have bits and pieces but but I
30.88s: want to show you how in my brain I pull
33.68s: all of this together to make smarter
36.40s: trades that make more money so what's up
39.96s: outliers let's get into why you should
43.96s: care about what we're about to talk
45.76s: about so first let's start with a
49.92s: scenario and we have to start with the
52.00s: basic understanding that our performance
54.52s: as Traders is literally a reflection of
58.20s: what our skill level is
60.56s: and what our strategies produce over
63.72s: time the reason why this is important to
65.84s: note is because if we get into this very
68.84s: first scenario and we have a Trader that
71.64s: has built a strategy that's designed to
75.20s: profit from expanding volatility and
77.88s: they choose to buy a call then the trade
82.76s: makes money so in this case we don't
85.92s: know yet if the stock went up or if
88.52s: volatility expanded but at this point
91.64s: most Traders are happy with this
95.28s: scenario because they made money what's
99.48s: the rub well the question we have to ask
102.28s: ourselves is do I care if I made money
106.00s: because volatility went up or because
109.00s: price went up and the answer to any
111.64s: Discerning Trader is abolutely
115.24s: if I built a strategy that's designed to
119.96s: make money from expanding volatility and
123.28s: in this scenario I happened to make
126.32s: money because price happened to move in
130.08s: my favor that is pivotal
134.04s: information because it informs how my
137.44s: strategy performs in this example just
140.48s: because price went up that actually
143.68s: could mean that the volatility in this
145.32s: trade contracted so it means based on my
148.48s: idea I was actually wrong but I made
151.68s: money because the stock went up so the
154.80s: reason why this is so important is
156.24s: because traders that are happy with
158.04s: making money regardless of the way that
159.88s: they made money when they're building an
161.28s: options trade they're not going to be
162.68s: around for very long because they're
164.44s: going to think oh wow this worked let me
166.44s: do more of this let me scale this up
169.36s: meanwhile the actual idea that they were
171.80s: trying to express literally was wrong
175.20s: that's dangerous so now let's talk about
179.60s: what what the hell a profit mechanism is
184.48s: so for those that are familiar with a
186.16s: video that I did a while ago about the
188.92s: outlier strategy process again this is
191.12s: just a way of thinking there's nothing
193.12s: novel here but the very first step of
197.28s: this is understanding and identifying
201.28s: profit
202.36s: mechanisms so if we look at this more
205.00s: broadly and how this fits into the scope
206.88s: of things profit mechanisms lead into
210.92s: the way that we analyze things the way
214.24s: that we match fitting option structures
217.44s: and then ultimately the way that we
219.64s: build strategies that can take the most
222.76s: advantage of the profit mechanism so
225.28s: we're going to talk about this more in
226.92s: detail so let's now get into examples of
233.44s: profit mechanism and profit mechanism
235.88s: types the idea behind this is I want to
238.36s: give you some context on how you can
241.24s: integrate this into what you do as a
244.08s: Trader so let's start with some Basics
248.24s: the first one we have here is price
250.88s: Direction up this is pretty
252.92s: straightforward this means if we're
254.56s: looking at a stock and it goes up we
257.36s: make money so if we pop over to a chart
259.52s: this is in on demand this is looking
262.16s: back in time looking at Sofi but price
264.76s: Direction up something goes up it makes
266.60s: money really really straightforward
268.28s: right however you will notice that there
270.76s: are different magnitudes different
273.28s: behaviors that things go up so what are
277.00s: the types of price Direction up profit
280.48s: mechanisms simple we have things like
283.32s: breakouts we have things like drift
285.76s: momentum value investing we have things
288.76s: like mergers and Acquisitions we have
290.48s: things that are news driven maybe
292.52s: there's a new piece of information
294.88s: related to a company they have a new
296.36s: product launch that then causes price to
299.36s: move
300.48s: we have to think about each of these
302.52s: separately over time because the way
305.32s: that we might trade something like
307.80s: example value compared to breakout is
311.12s: very different now in this example you
314.64s: might be able to make money in either
316.40s: scenario if you buy a call that's uh
319.12s: maybe it's a leaps something that's
320.88s: longer than a year you can make money in
322.92s: either scenario but you can maximize how
325.96s: much money you make if you differ
327.72s: between these so another example here
330.68s: would be something like price Direction
333.32s: down so these were trading things like
335.20s: breakdowns things with negative drift
336.88s: negative momentum news driven a great
339.24s: example of a news driven downside trade
341.84s: is if we pop over the platform this is
343.56s: still back in time but I think this will
345.08s: be in here which was crowd strike and if
349.36s: we take a look funny enough it's right
351.08s: around the time frame we're going to use
352.28s: for the example later and this is when
355.00s: they had that systems issue that caused
357.40s: a lot of problems that's a news driven
359.72s: event that ended up causing crowd strike
362.36s: to
363.68s: Crater understanding how news can impact
366.60s: stocks again leads to different kinds of
369.60s: tradable ideas now different kinds of
373.24s: profit mechanisms at a high level
375.60s: volatility expansion volatility
377.28s: Contracting transitory volatility
379.08s: meaning as it's moving between
380.88s: clustering variance risk premiums which
383.32s: is the prevalence for volatility implied
385.48s: volatility to Trend elevated compared to
388.12s: Historic volatility especially in
389.96s: indices especially on the put side the
392.32s: fact that there's typically more
393.72s: volatility on the put side than the call
395.52s: side different Market inefficiencies as
398.72s: in how quick it takes things to be
400.48s: priced in there are all different kinds
403.28s: of profit mechanisms that exist and if
405.64s: you're curious about how to find some of
408.04s: these you can just go into
410.00s: ssrn and research come up with just some
414.00s: basic key terms stock market stock
416.84s: market profit and breakouts momentum
419.96s: value you come up with all these
421.12s: different terms and look at what
423.56s: research is existing you don't have to
425.60s: reinvent the wheel here then you can
427.92s: take some time to understand some of
430.00s: these different subtypes because for
432.84s: example again the way that I trade a
434.48s: breakout is different than the way that
437.20s: I trade something like momentum and I
439.52s: want to show you that concept now but a
443.16s: quick recap on what you know so far that
446.40s: being correct on a trade meaning it's
448.76s: made money is not good enough you have
451.72s: to also be correct and able to track
454.56s: your ability to be correct with respect
456.84s: to the actual profit mechanism you're
458.64s: trying to profit from there are all
460.80s: different kinds of profit mechanisms and
462.72s: then all different kinds of profit
464.28s: mechanism types the reason behind
466.96s: breaking things down this way is so that
469.32s: you can more accurately
472.28s: identify what you're making money from
475.76s: this is a really important function so
478.48s: now let's into an example of how to
481.32s: actually integrate this whole thing into
483.16s: a process and it's also pretty simple
486.12s: now let's start with the price Direction
489.28s: up profit mechanism meaning we make
491.16s: something we make money as something
492.68s: goes up and for the example that we're
495.04s: looking at we're going to eyeball a
497.76s: breakout the qualities associated with
501.40s: breakouts you have to look at them for
504.44s: yourself and see what you find now to
507.48s: give you some you know I guess
510.40s: read ahead notes on what you will find
513.12s: this is from my analysis of this
516.56s: specific Pro profit mechanism in type
519.32s: you'll notice that I tend to see things
521.48s: like consolidation with Contracting
524.04s: volatility before we come into some sort
526.44s: of catalyst whether it's news driven a
529.16s: really solid earnings release something
532.12s: like that and then we normally will see
535.76s: aggressive price movement relative to
538.04s: recent price movement we'll see volume
540.40s: expand we'll see moving averages
542.32s: steepened out we'll see oscillators
544.20s: start to turn over and again I'll show
545.92s: you an example of all of this now how do
548.36s: I know all of these things about it's
549.96s: because I looked for tons of references
554.04s: of breakouts now this is something you
555.80s: can code and look at it within python if
558.56s: you're interested or you can literally
560.80s: just go into a chart and see what you
564.12s: see now this is a great example of a
566.44s: breakdown so this becomes an analysis
569.00s: point we can come up with things like
571.16s: well I wonder how far this move was well
573.72s: it opened here and it ran all the way
575.92s: down to here so this represents a 47%
579.20s: drop in price for this specific stock
581.88s: how normal is that well I can open up a
584.04s: Google sheet and track this moving crowd
586.88s: strike and I can analyze hundreds and
590.48s: thousands of these so that I now
593.52s: understand the Tendencies for these
595.88s: kinds of moves on what to expect this is
597.88s: important to do and again as always if
600.60s: I'm saying these things and you're like
601.76s: man that sounds like a lot of work no
604.64s:  welcome to trading this isn't free
607.64s: money get over it now let's continue
612.00s: with this example after we figure out
614.76s: the profit mechanism we identify the
616.96s: type we start outlining different
619.12s: qualities from us being able to eyeball
621.20s: it we look at charts we look at Broad
623.00s: research that already exists then we
625.60s: start just thinking of different signals
628.36s: that can help us find and measure the
631.80s: profit mechanism and the type so for
634.52s: something like breakouts we might use
636.28s: things like standard deviation channels
638.20s: we might use price action we might use
640.56s: moving averages we might use the moving
642.48s: average slope the width between them
644.92s: price relative to the moving averages we
647.72s: might look at RSI I like to use RSI with
650.36s: a 7-Day vwap moving average we might
652.92s: look at the prior earnings release data
654.84s: we might look at Price movement
657.32s: specifically with respect to this cont
659.36s: tracting Behavior as it's consolidating
662.00s: we might look at average volume volume
663.68s: profile so on and so forth these are
665.92s: things I look at actually specific to
667.76s: this one but for this signal section you
670.36s: just have to jot down ideas based on
673.28s: what you saw as you looked at it so
675.52s: notice the way we come up with this is
677.56s: by taking the time to actually look at
679.76s: it then you can come up with ideas now
683.36s: finally we outline different structures
686.40s: that we might use to help capture this
689.92s: and let's use an example for this
692.00s: breakout concept the question we might
695.32s: say is well do we want to sell puts or
697.80s: buy calls what Delta what days to
700.00s: expiration so on and so forth so how do
702.80s: we answer this how do we figure out if I
705.04s: want to sell puts or buy calls well
706.68s: let's now look at an example let's go
709.40s: back to what we were looking at which
710.84s: was
711.64s: Sofi and we can see that this is
714.88s: following some of the broader Tendencies
717.16s: related to that not perfectly so but
719.04s: some some of them and we can see that
721.52s: there's this light consolidation
723.44s: although volume and overall size of the
727.52s: candle so average daily range was
729.16s: expanding in here the reason why that
731.12s: matters is because that actually
732.48s: violates a little bit what we might
734.16s: expect to see but these different traits
737.40s: they're not Universal and absolute
739.44s: they're traits to look for but really
741.80s: what I'm looking for here and we're back
743.88s: in time right now we're back in October
746.44s: of last year what I'm looking for is
749.32s: price Behavior relative to this
751.72s: near-term price action and then I'm
753.68s: trying to eyeball for a breakout so
755.96s: let's say that we finally see that
757.64s: breakout we see that there's a big
759.24s: volume note here and we start to say to
761.60s: ourselves if price really breaks Above
764.44s: This level that we draw we're going to
766.16s: consider it a breakout and trade it well
768.16s: what does that mean well now I need to
770.76s: decide between two different positions I
773.88s: can either buy some calls or I can sell
776.88s: some puts so the way I look at it if you
779.64s: follow something like my ratio called
781.52s: diagonal strategy which I'll throw a
783.44s: link to below for an entire playlist on
786.44s: it you already know the kind of things
788.16s: I'm going to eyeball I'm going to go out
789.76s: maybe 90 days or so I'm going to look
791.80s: for something that's close to at the
793.36s: money maybe one strike in the money and
796.20s: let's analyze this as if this is a
797.80s: $100,000 account so what that means is
800.04s: I'm going to size my loss at a point
802.64s: that's maybe a percent for $100,000
805.80s: account you for this kind of trade again
808.44s: based on understanding The Profit
809.88s: mechanism and type were wrong a lot so
812.64s: I'm actually going to size it down a
814.24s: little bit than whatever my standard
816.12s: risk control might be so again if we're
818.60s: using a 1% maybe I'll go a little bit
821.44s: under that so I'm going to size it so
823.96s: that I can place a 30 lot of the nine 17
828.16s: genan 25s I get them for a17 and at my
831.88s: exit point of 850 why 850 because again
836.08s: based on my research and understanding
837.68s: of this profit mechanism in type and
839.56s: corresponding signals if it fall belows
841.92s: if it falls below this level I'm just
844.00s: wrong so it means my idea was wrong it's
846.40s: time for me to get out the reason why
848.28s: it's so tight is because it reduces the
850.60s: total risk and it's forcing me to be
854.36s: correct if I'm wrong that's okay I want
856.64s: to be wrong quick so now if we go back
859.12s: into this and we're looking at this call
860.60s: scenario we can see what our p&l might
862.68s: be so let's say if we get a 15% move we
865.76s: would make 2600 bucks and we lose 752
870.32s: essentially if it drops 5% so this
873.20s: places a really high premium on being
875.32s: correct in terms of our directional
877.04s: analysis let's comparatively look at
879.72s: this again selling puts through selling
882.28s: puts we might do something that's like
884.32s: 35 days to expiration in this example
887.16s: and we're using the 26 Deltas they're
888.80s: the first strike at the money so let's
891.68s: take a look at what we can make here
893.52s: sizing it the same so that we lose the
895.96s: same amount of money if it falls to 850
898.04s: and we take our exit because again based
899.92s: on the profit mechanism and the type and
903.20s: Signal it's not dependent on whether I
905.56s: sell calls or I'm sorry sell puts or buy
908.64s: calls the way I exit this trade and
910.92s: manage the risk is by being
912.24s: directionally wrong and that's the risk
914.76s: side of the equation that's what I'm
915.96s: managing for here so if I size it to be
918.60s: about the same I can put on a 50 lot of
922.36s: the8 puts out in 15 no my Max profit is
925.92s: 1,600 bucks so if I get that same 15 %
929.36s: Move I Make
930.92s: $11,000 so we can already see a
933.12s: difference based on these and based on
935.36s: what I expect to see I already told you
937.84s: what this tends to look like which is
939.96s: more aggressive price movement so now
943.56s: let's fast forward a month and see how
946.52s: these perform I'm going to go to the 8th
948.08s: of November and let's just compare them
951.36s: quickly and see how they do so if we
954.28s: fast forward this as well which is part
956.16s: of on demand we have to make sure we're
957.80s: capturing the full profit potential so
960.24s: if we take a look at this on our short
963.48s: put side we make just about Max profit
966.40s: because we're cherry-picking a scenario
968.72s: here but the stock goes up it's still
970.48s: loading but it does go up so we can see
973.00s: that the stock actually rallies up now
975.36s: it's at like 1293 we're at like near Max
978.00s: profit on these short puts that's great
980.72s: that's a fantastic outcome for this
982.28s: scenario if we take a look at the call
984.92s: equivalent you'll see that we're sitting
987.40s: at a profit of 8,000
990.60s: ,000 what's the difference here well
993.88s: based on what I expected to see how I
997.80s: expected the price to behave and move
1001.52s: this was a more fitting strategy based
1005.28s: on the idea to capture this kind of
1008.00s: upside potential so this goes all the
1010.40s: way back why do you care about profit
1012.96s: mechanisms because if you sold the put
1015.72s: you left so much on the table because
1018.28s: you didn't take the time to understand
1020.64s: the nuances of the profit mechanism and
1023.80s: type that you're trying to trade as
1026.52s: always if you have any questions let me
1027.92s: know be an outlier I'll see you later
