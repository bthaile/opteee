0.00s: What's up, everybody? Eric here. I am back with Matt Kruzel from I think is your
6.90s: platform actually like the whole thing called Kruzel insights or is that just the newsletter
10.42s: that we share? That's the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah.
12.94s: Good. Well, it's a great thing. Thanks. Yeah. And I mean, if somebody has real insight,
18.78s: that's probably you not me. So I think at least yours is pretty damn authentic. Thanks, Eric.
25.78s: How's your year going, dude?
28.58s: You know what? To be honest, it's quiet. Like, you know, markets are not cooperative.
33.62s: Like I'm more of a trend trader and we're just kind of stuck in this range. So my aim
38.10s: in these kind of markets is to not get into trouble. That's my go-to strategy at the moment.
42.94s: So trying to avoid that bad chop. You get stuck in one of those kind of trendless markets
48.54s: and you force it and that's never good for anyone. So it's been quite. But you know, it's great
52.06s: because it gives me a chance to kind of focus on other things. Like, obviously, always
54.86s: market related, but rather than the in and outs. And which is a change for me, though.
58.74s: You know, it's funny as you know, you go through your career and you do different things
61.34s: and I day trade it for a year. So it's kind of your glue to the action. Now, it's kind
65.54s: of almost nice to kind of like spread out to other things a little bit. But how's your
68.46s: year going so far? Really good. So for me, I'm one of the fortunate people that the
74.86s: chop is good for volatility, right? So like, I'm sure during the the bull market, you know,
79.70s: before the COVID crash, you were probably killing it. And then that's when I was sitting
84.10s: there, I mean, I was looking under rocks for volatility. So this is, this has actually
90.90s: been like my exact market. It's not too frequent that we get kind of this sort of sustained
96.06s: market over the past. I don't want what year and a half now where it's been pretty similar
99.70s: to this last year, you know, more trending to the downside, but still enough volatility
103.38s: to trade really effectively. And this market so far has just been fantastic. Big fan.
108.70s: You know, it's funny. I started trading on the desk back in the day. I was younger and
113.38s: we were almost all equity guys, but there's a few option guys. I wouldn't really mix too
117.30s: much kind of later on different sides of the desk, you know, but I remember talking to my
120.14s: manager, became close. I said, you know, I had the options guys doing is like, I'm bull
123.38s: markets. They don't really make any much money. He's like, but for the department, the
126.22s: great head, he's like, when things go bad and any equity guys take a beating, they make
129.70s: like a huge multiple of like their normal returns. He's like, so for us, it's more of
132.94s: like a diversifier returns. I know I never, never thought of it that way. But so I guess,
138.10s: you know, the certain kind of truisms of the market all these years later, it means
141.74s: true with your option style too. So it's just a way of the market.
145.66s: Yeah. And I, to be honest, it's one of the reasons why I really like that's, you know,
151.06s: everybody thinks retail traders are perpetually disadvantaged and there are innumerable disadvantages
156.26s: for retail traders to be super clear. But there are some benefits and it's kind of what
160.30s: you're talking about is, you know, not that I could ever trade trends as effectively as
165.62s: you can. You've essentially dedicated a lot of your life to that approach. But I do have
170.38s: the luxury of saying, okay, this strategy set is working well in this market. Now it's
175.90s: not working. I need to do something else. And that's actually why I kind of structure
180.22s: my options trading to not just be one thing. I don't just trade volatility because there
185.66s: are extended periods where it's not there. Whereas, you know, like the dudes on the desk
189.50s: that you're talking about, they essentially, you know, they have a more limited scope
192.70s: on what they're doing because they're part of a bigger picture, which is I say that
196.18s: for the retail traders because retail just likes to bitch and moan that, you know, everything
200.86s: stacked against us. And it is in general, but there are some benefits and being able to pivot
206.26s: pretty quickly is actually kind of a nice thing, even what you're doing now, right, in your
209.54s: strategies, because you're saying that you're just trying to not get in trouble. So what does that
213.38s: look like for you? Are you mostly in cash now? Yeah, but mostly in cash for probably the past
217.94s: month or so. And, you know, like I said, for someone who's looking for trend, even if it's a swing
222.50s: trade, or whatever, I mean, it's just been, you know, it's one of those markets that's deceiving
226.42s: for anyone who's trying to play direction because just as something looks good, it fails,
230.26s: when something looks awful, then it comes back. It's really the reversion to the mean guy.
233.46s: It's the only guy that makes money in this market. So, so knowing kind of went to like, oh,
237.38s: this is time for me to back away and having the tools for that as like a big advantage. Because
240.82s: I mean, this is the kind of market in the past where you know, you go into drawdown, which sucks.
244.74s: And then just you're fighting just to make back your drawdown in good times before you can actually
248.50s: get ahead. And I think for some people who are they, you know, trading for a living is not their
252.50s: their their their main business to say, oh, well, I'll make it back. Whatever, but if you're trading
256.18s: for a living, you build that big hole. It's a big mountain to climb. So you you learn to want to
260.42s: avoid that that loss as much as possible. So it's quiet. That's it's fine for me. You know, for someone
264.90s: who's who used to have, you know, 500 open orders at once and have to run to the washroom and run
270.26s: back to not get the too many fills. Sometimes a bit of quiet. It's not a bad thing. Yeah. And actually
276.02s: one of the dudes from my discord, he pulled in a tweet that you put that I think you were I
280.98s: didn't catch it myself, but I think you were referencing one of Mark's tweets essentially about
284.74s: cash. And I actually love that conversation because sometimes I think people do forget that
291.06s: cash is a position like and there is decay, right? You don't want to stay in cash for too long.
296.26s: And some people do I think fall into the trap of, okay, I feel uncomfortable or I know this isn't
302.98s: right for me. I'm going to move to cash. But then all of a sudden they have a hard time redeploying
307.22s: because the conditions are then never right again, right? It's never perfect. There's always
311.54s: concessions. I want to know how you kind of overcome that because I think that's a common problem
316.74s: for people. You know, that's a really good point. I remember when I, again, when I first started
320.66s: trying to turn the desk and I didn't want to at first. I asked you know, like cocky 20-year-old,
324.42s: you started being some good money and I was training futures and wow, I want to work anywhere,
327.86s: you know, but it just will happen. My wife had a different job in the bank, but happened to be next
331.94s: to the trading desk and so she like introduced me and said, okay, I'll give it a shot. But I learned
335.22s: a lot of lessons, which was great and retrospective. Happy I did it. But I remember I saw I was like the
339.14s: youngest guy on the desk. I was seeing next to the oldest guy on the desk and at one point I hit a
342.82s: drawdown. I forget when it was. It wasn't terrible. But like I was kind of just like, you know, confused
347.14s: and you know, you get those points where you say, you look at the market and everything just looks
350.26s: like like the same thing. You don't know how to read anything anymore. It's like you've gone blind.
353.94s: And he's like, Matt, whatever you do is like, I don't care if you own 100 shares of stock. He's like,
357.94s: whatever, always be trading. He's like, are you lose your feel? You lose your touch. And he had
363.22s: a super point and that helped me a lot over the years. Now I've kind of adjusted a little bit. So I
368.02s: have some tools where it's like when the green sign comes in, I force myself to do some buying.
372.82s: Because if you don't have some kind of rule or some kind of method that's going to force you to buy,
376.50s: you totally lose your touch. And you kind of forget why you got into it in the first place. By the
380.02s: time you come back as you see a headline, the best moves have taken off without you. So like for those
386.98s: who don't have, I think the discipline to kind of stay away, but then force yourself back in.
390.50s: I would almost say it sounds, you know, maybe countertuitive, but yeah, you should always be trading.
395.06s: If you don't know when to kind of force yourself back in because losing that touch is an expensive
398.98s: mistake to make. So a good point to Eric. Yeah, no, and I'm glad that you you kind of give people
404.66s: two different tools because I actually typically fall into that first camp where I almost always have
410.82s: some sort of exposure, almost always. There was a couple periods over the last what two years,
416.98s: where I went completely to cash zero percent utilization. But that was like super short term.
422.02s: And then I immediately looked for any excuse to put something on because I've been there before,
427.38s: man, where it's like I moved to cash and it's like you see everything else just lighting up on
432.42s: fire around you and you're like, wow, this is actually like pretty good. I'm not losing anything here.
436.42s: And then it's I just remember, man, I'm like looking at the markets like, oh, well, this could happen.
441.06s: Or that could happen on all of a sudden. It's like another four days and there's nothing out there.
444.98s: I'm like, all right, dude, I got to put something on. So what stuff has been working for you so far
452.58s: this year in terms of even the those shorter term trades, not necessarily like the big, big trends
458.42s: that you're looking for. But like maybe some of the shorter term stuff that you're looking just
461.86s: for some exposure. Yeah, so January worked out really well. And we came in and again,
467.30s: some like my main tools kind of said, you know, things are conducive. And it's really odd. One of my
471.30s: main tools is looking for like more 52 week highs and 52 week lows. And so although like January
477.54s: markets were lower than where they are now, let's say, you know, especially than the NASDAQ, QQQ,
482.50s: like we we had really strong internals signs. So that worked great. Then after kind of
488.10s: February into March, got the chop in April, I've been cash because it's just been this and like
492.10s: looking back for someone looking for trend when you're a flatline that's like a worst case type of
495.78s: market. So I think like looking back, it's really just kind of at least the tools really did their
500.18s: job. You know, again, like I never fully trust a tool. Like I'm always like, scary that okay,
505.46s: at a certain points and the stop working. And there's like endless stories of like systems that
509.06s: were great and then just stopped and people couldn't recognize it. So I'm always kind of like,
513.94s: if the tool has given me a signal, like I want to like verify that it's this really is representing
518.18s: environment properly. But I think for now, like sometimes just knowing when to get aggressive,
523.62s: when not to aggressive, like the biggest, I think the hardest thing for me to learn over the years
527.14s: was to assess environments. You know, like there's that time to really get really like you
531.22s: pick. You want to like, yeah, as aggressive as you can other times, you know, mediocre and sometimes
535.70s: not much. But kind of like you, I almost always have a position. There's probably like five times
540.18s: I can count in my career, I didn't. I mean, even on my honeymoon, I had positions. Although it's
544.90s: the positions cost me more than my honeymoon did, which is like the other problem having positions
548.42s: when you shouldn't. But yeah, you know, so that's pretty much it. I think just, you know, recognizing
553.46s: the tools are working well, keeping you safe. And they're just waiting for like that fat pitch.
558.02s: So I agree to interview with Drostani Juck and Miller recently where he was saying kind of similar,
561.70s: you know, tough environment for positions. He's like, and you want to wait for that fat pitch
566.26s: to knock it out of the park, you know, so that's really where my focus is.
569.78s: Yeah. Another question I wanted to ask you was, as you're looking at the markets right now,
575.70s: it sounds like there aren't any strong sector leaders that you're king into. But I'm curious how
582.18s: you're monitoring that slash. If there's anything at least you're kind of waiting to see starting to
586.98s: make a breakout or do you think it'll be a while before we actually see that kind of strength.
591.06s: So I do see sector leaders. So that's the thing, you know, and it takes like that discipline,
595.94s: because I see stuff that looks good, but that, but those rotations sometimes can be fleeting.
599.86s: So I kind of in a good market will looks good and really expands and man, does it pay, you know,
604.26s: but like in these choppy markets, you can get violent rotations. But I think the key themes
607.86s: coming out, like I think AI is going to be huge. Like I ate a lot of stuff as hype. So I'm not
612.18s: someone that usually I think one of the problems I face is that I'm sure you know you've been trading
616.34s: for a while too. So like, you know, most professional traders, I know are cynical people because you see
620.02s: so much, you know, crap over the years of CEO's promising this and this trend and then it all ends up
626.50s: like you look back five years later and this stuff's down 90%. So you stop believing like at
630.50s: anything that could be great. But I have some experience with AI. I had a consulting company I'd
636.34s: work with a few years back, although it's like AI is really balloon since, you know, but I think
641.14s: that will be big. And I think that's what's really pushing Nvidia. Nvidia is kind of like the guy
644.82s: selling the shovels to the gold miners of like of AI. So you're seeing a play through that. There's
649.14s: just not a lot of direct plays right now. So I think that's one kind of going beyond that, which I
653.46s: think everyone is like staring at. So it's probably like a late plate, a late trade in the short term
657.86s: is I think you can see like kind of more like affordable dining. I think if you look at Chipotle,
661.14s: Mexican grill, wingstop, some of these stocks are doing great. And I think you know what,
665.14s: obviously with inflation the past few years, you know, for a lot of people it's more affordable to go
669.22s: to lower end diners and you know, they do a good job at their price point. So that's been another
675.06s: strong trend. It's interesting. Another strong trend I found is housing and building, which I have a
680.10s: hard time understanding why given the higher rates, you were thought with higher rates, they'd be
684.66s: getting crushed, but that's been strong. But I don't fully, I don't fully get that move.
690.10s: There's just one stock FND, which is floor and decker that they have a great kind of growth
694.66s: plan coming through FN as in the Nicholas growth plan. So they've been kind of building, but
699.86s: everything's like everything's stuck sideways since February. It's like flat lines and these are
703.38s: some of the stocks that are, you know, you could see with your channel lines coming up, like I mean,
706.98s: it's generally in an uptrend, but it's so like there's such large flat periods. If you don't
711.54s: cash those like fleeting moments of uptrend, like you just stuck with a lot of noise. So it's,
716.58s: it's really interesting you point that out, right? Because yeah, down here it's trading at 69 and then
720.74s: from December to the end of, you know, your, it makes its run to 100 and then it's just from there
728.50s: on, it's flat man, that's a good point. Yeah, so you look at this and say, oh, that's easy, but then
732.66s: in real time, they get a factor of the stock that kind of failed and this and that. So it's kind of,
736.98s: you know, I kind of just realized when the environment's kind of like soft, I prefer to kind of
740.34s: slow myself down. So I always usually have some trades. I had one recently IOT, which was doing great,
746.18s: actually Stanley Druckermill has a position, this is kind of a recent IPO.
750.50s: And so I was positioning in there like in, you know, tail end of March right off those key
754.82s: averages and it's like went to break higher and as it was breaking out, I'm like, I don't know,
759.14s: whenever something breaks out of this market, it instantly fails. So I had a break even stop,
762.66s: it just kind of like rolled over instantly. So that's kind of summarizes a lot of that. I think
767.54s: the big opportunity really was that like early January to February, ever since then it's been just
772.50s: like chop for like three months. It's just been sideways. There's been kind of tough for a trend
777.46s: this is pretty impressive though. This down move here. Yeah. Like what this surprises me. Like I
783.54s: assume this is catalyst driven of some sort like not at all, not at all. This is this is really an
789.46s: environment like of positioning whenever people get like to position one way this such little trend
795.06s: that like it just gets rammed the other way back down and this is totally just a break out that
800.90s: was pushed lower but by short term short term algal or machines or whoever big traders that that's
806.74s: nothing nothing news driven for that. So yeah, because I'm checking out the news and it says that
811.62s: it was moved to a hold and yeah, I mean nothing awful right? Like no, no.
820.58s: That's that's interesting especially yeah, those kind of moves because and it's always one of the
825.38s: favorite thing like one of my favorite things about talking to you is you always introduce me to
828.58s: new tickers because you definitely look at like a very different side of the market than I tend to.
833.94s: So it's always fun to yeah, to take a peek at some of these because most of this stuff it's
838.02s: funny. I look at this chart but most of what I'm looking at this year is actually I care about this
843.54s: chart which is just implied versus historic volatility and that I'm just looking for variance
848.74s: risk premiums essentially. So it's it's interesting because when I look at something like this,
854.10s: there is definitely like good variance risk premiums here at least on a short term.
858.66s: So even though it might not be something I would typically trade if the options are not super
864.34s: gross which they're not they're not great but they're not bad. Who knows man, we might
870.82s: might add it to the watch list. So something like this, are you just looking to really fade like
876.42s: the whole differences or how would you are you are you bringing in trend or direction anyway?
881.30s: Like how would you how would you approach a simple case? I know it's very different very different styles.
887.30s: It's a great question. If if we were kind of more in this sideways trending section then I would
892.26s: be way more pure volatility voiced but with something that makes this kind of down move,
898.18s: you know from what 22 down to 17 18 that's pretty significant move for product this size.
904.18s: I can't ignore direction. So I either need to structure the volatility capture to account for
910.02s: some sort of expected continuation and trends. So like for example, you know who knows maybe there's
916.98s: some semblance of support forming somewhere in here right and maybe I wait to see how it hangs
923.78s: out around this level before maybe it drops down here but the point being is this is not where I would
929.38s: place a directionally neutral volatility capture strategy just yeah I need to wait and see how
935.54s: this thing moves a little bit more because I mean this is six big consecutive down days. So it's
942.58s: you know the volatility expansion especially for this kind of move if we're being honest it's not
947.30s: that impressive. Like typically with this kind of big down move I would expect implied volatility to
954.02s: be increasing kind of like what you see back here like way more and it's not. So it also tells me
959.30s: that this is just a typically more volatile product it runs at a higher baseline which is also
964.02s: seen in the numbers. So yeah with higher volatility is good it gives me just higher propensity to catch
972.10s: larger discrepancies but option traders I think sometimes get too focused on higher volatility
978.26s: forgetting that higher volatility means shit moves. So with something like this man it's easy to
984.50s: get ran over on some sort of directionally neutral trade which actually happened to me in FRC
990.74s: which this has been a fantastic trade. I have been pulling volatility out of this thing
997.62s: for two weeks now and then in what the last week I was attempting to do the same thing I've
1003.94s: been doing for a while now I've been positioning pretty small because I see a insane amount of risk
1010.50s: in this product and I mean whether it's halt because I mean one of the days I was trading it I
1015.38s: had to get out via between halts and that's oh you know how that goes. Yeah yeah. Like in order log
1021.94s: that has to get ran through so you're just hoping to get a fill even out of market order.
1027.94s: So but this is like a prime time example of something where you know I was kind of trading that
1032.82s: capture strategy but then all of a sudden we started moving from 15 down to 11 10 and even that
1038.34s: move was enough to trigger those halts and then the volatility if we pull this up the realized
1044.58s: volatility was just spiking. So I was getting out essentially at small losses as soon as it started
1050.26s: to happen instead of letting it run some of them actually would have been actually decent profits but
1054.90s: I don't I do not like to play with that especially in something like this is like when I was playing
1059.06s: uh playing game stop in AMC I fully acknowledge that I am playing with fucking fire. So I am real quick
1067.94s: to you know get the position on that I think makes sense but then as soon as it starts even remotely
1072.50s: not working I'm getting the fuck out immediately. Yeah yeah no I uh and I've I've played with those like
1079.94s: that maybe not FRC but I've played with the very volatile names like earlier in my career so I
1085.06s: I know the vibe I think you know positions a big part of it you have to just know like the right size
1088.50s: to put on. Yeah you know you always have like that that buffer I used to I mean I used to build into
1093.38s: it like you know because usually you know the high ball you're taking out like huge returns once
1097.14s: work in your way so you do it enough where you say okay I have enough profit even if I raise my size
1100.82s: worst case I'm just giving back my profit and and I don't get hurt too bad and and you size and you
1105.54s: have to know the point where you can't get too greedy or else eventually you will get test nagged you
1109.06s: but um yeah let's do like kind of like merger our type stuff and yet just have to be careful
1113.86s: during that wrong environment where like you know it would fail a knuckle through what you know
1117.86s: like you're picking up pennies in front of a steam roller you gotta be very careful very nimble
1121.62s: you don't want to get run over so yeah I try those. It's so like I literally love the way that you
1127.46s: just kind of phrase that because options traders will say the thing like picking up pennies in front
1132.74s: of a steam roller and I always remind them I was like well just remember like steam rollers they move
1136.98s: pretty fucking slow so if you're just like you said right if you're nimble you can get the hell out
1140.98s: of the way which is kind of a whole name of the game um and it's also I think super-septic that you
1146.82s: brought up sizing because in the discord you know every once in a while I'll drop in some of
1150.98s: the stuff I'm working on and somebody was just like oh man you know how are you handling FRC
1155.70s: you know because I told them that I'm essentially waiting to get out because of the halls and I was
1159.62s: just like I just I'm literally just waiting there's nothing for me to do and the trade is strategically
1165.86s: sized that even if we have another 15% gap down I don't want it to but it's not gonna break the
1172.10s: bank like it's specifically sized because I acknowledge what I'm trading and I think sometimes people
1178.34s: forget being able to flex strategies and sizing based on that and it's kind of like what you were
1184.10s: talking about before right the idea of being more greedy when it's time to be greedy but then
1189.70s: knowing when to back off on that same strategy um so when you're looking at the rest of this year
1196.82s: are you expecting kind of stronger trends so that you can start kind of sizing in a little bit more
1203.30s: or writing more or are you expecting kind of this chop throughout the rest of the year?
1207.70s: No I mean chop no no trend ever lasts like even chop will last you know uh I I mean I think really
1213.86s: one or two things are gonna end up working like this way like either the inflation inflation
1218.42s: is gonna fall more than we thought and the Fed can back off or it stays the way it is and the economy
1224.26s: starts to break down and then the Fed gets scared and it backs off like either way so you know
1229.54s: in my experience even when I was day trade even I was doing kind of the stuff like you were doing
1232.82s: so even I would like day trade and was taking like small trades I always made like by far my most
1239.06s: amount of money when I still cut a trend because the way my mind works like I always play the long
1242.82s: side even I was day trading even in all eight my first year with the financial crisis I made money
1247.14s: just trading long all year I just I would wait I would change like the parameters as to how oversold
1251.78s: something had to be before I would test the waters but I even as a day trader I always play the
1255.78s: long side um but for me it's like whenever I have a strong conviction trade and I'd be day trading
1262.50s: that direction but keeping kind of a core and building and always putting on like more
1265.94s: position more size that was right those are always the years of fireworks so and I've noticed just
1272.18s: maybe this is just my own personal you know character but I've always made like big chunks of
1277.94s: money like in three four months like in all the the trends is like there's that kind of like that
1281.94s: perfect point where you hit the heater where it's just like there's like that ultimate move and if
1286.02s: you're positioned right and you and you get it right if you can move your account like you know triple
1289.94s: digit returns like really fast and hard and then you need to know when to back off so for me and
1295.14s: you know it's interesting listen to drunken miller because although he's like a global macro guy
1298.90s: and I don't really trade that way I think the way he views the world and the way he thinks is really
1303.06s: like I align a lot with him and he was saying something similar to he's like you know I don't see a
1307.06s: fat pitch he's like but the fed's gonna fold they're gonna do something and we're gonna you're
1310.98s: gonna get those windows of opportunity you know I mean his basis is that we're kind of like in a
1314.66s: decade like the 70s like a lost decade but within those you get those one year two year bull markets
1320.10s: where they're sizable money and that's like the fractal nature of the market to even in one year
1324.82s: could be a one year of junk but if you're patient you don't grind yourself down you're gonna get
1328.66s: that you don't need more than three or four if you get a four-month trend your position properly
1333.22s: like that's fireworks you don't need more than that if you're if you're an adaptive flexible
1338.02s: aggressive trader but like this past year and a half spend abnormal I mean we broke we we topped
1344.18s: in in late 21 growth top in like February 21 if you look at the dot com crash which was
1350.82s: you're kind of also very long but you had some serious rallies like coming out of like the
1354.98s: tail end level one you had like a 50% NASDAQ rally off the lows like it was big like countert
1360.10s: this has kind of been like drop in chop which is really kind of like you're looking back over
1366.26s: decades there's like a handful of these kind of markets so it is odd but it's okay I mean like
1370.50s: that the market always you know send you something that gives you a curve while if there's no
1373.62s: out a dodged but the opportunities are gonna come they always come whenever I thought I've missed
1377.86s: something you wait enough time and you just patient the markets in another opportunity so
1382.58s: yeah it's and it's interesting and I think that's actually one of the other things that I find
1386.82s: so impressive about you honestly is that you go through those cycles where you'll have like
1390.90s: triple digits three months return like I've never I literally have never seen that my entire career
1395.38s: so it's like it's to me that's such a cool concept and again so different than the way that I
1401.62s: typically perceive the markets I've always been more of throughout the year I don't have anything
1409.22s: stellar but I almost know with certainty where I'm gonna end at the end of the year almost every
1413.94s: single year and that I think the way that I've used that to grow was sizing right is once once I've
1422.50s: you know built that return over like six seven years I was like okay I've hit this seven years
1427.06s: consecutively in kind of various markets I'm okay to start sizing up here and for a period I was
1432.10s: even going leveraged and stuff like that to really accelerate but how did you develop the discipline
1438.58s: to sit and kind of watch things keeping smaller positions from time to time but then and being
1444.02s: able to successfully making that transition from looking at the markets and then saying okay now it's
1449.70s: time to start scaling in is there kind of like a more rigorous checklist that you look to see in the
1453.94s: markets in terms of the internals and whatnot to provide the support that you think you need for
1457.78s: that trend I'm fascinated by that approach so I'm really curious to understand how you make that
1462.02s: transition mentally you know so for the longest time I always ran kind of multiple strategies so I
1468.18s: kind of I always had day trading going on because I started as a market maker so I was like my starting
1472.34s: point and so it's that kind of thing with you like I knew almost every month like a cash register
1476.42s: like you just like you take X amount out maybe summer months would be a quieter but during the year
1480.34s: it was fairly consistent and it was more when I was running it that way it was more a little bit of
1487.38s: you would get a vibe build it was kind of like the trader instinct you know like Jesse
1490.58s: Levermum Street right like reminiscent of stock operator and like you would just feel I mean like
1494.66s: you know I always love economic history macro trends so I would get a like a thesis like this
1498.98s: market should explode and you they would act differently and that's something like people don't get
1503.86s: like the same bicycles that will work in a really good market would be garbage in other markets and
1509.30s: so when you're when you're new you're like I don't understand I made money for nine months more
1512.90s: money that I thought I was ever going to make and now I can't make a penny it's the environment
1516.34s: that's changed so it's so originally it was kind of like a vibe and you would see things moving
1521.54s: and then you would press the bet at a certain point it's like I mean I'm not sure with with yourself
1526.26s: but like the niche kind of day trading strategy I was putting like I was getting too sizeable for
1530.10s: for what I for to be able to grow so I said you know what I have enough capital where I did the
1534.18s: analysis like you know like I always tell people that this is a business we're running you know like
1536.82s: so what if what if we hit one year period where markets suck because I started no eight so it's
1541.46s: not as if I was like unaware of bad market periods and so I got to a point where I said like I have
1546.26s: enough capital worst case I'm fine it's not a big deal I'm sure I'll bake something or whatever I'll
1550.90s: make extra the year after and so I built all the tools to make sure that would never get off guard
1555.70s: and misadmitted trend that one so I think there's one hedge fund manager Jim Ropel yeah pop
1561.38s: around YouTube and everything and and he he talks with like the idea of guard rails you know he's
1566.34s: like you know you want to have these guard rails to make sure you don't kind of you know it's like
1569.14s: it's like the guard rails won't guide your cars your driving but like they make sure you don't fall
1572.50s: off a cliff so like I've kind of built guard rails into my system where one you don't get demolished
1577.54s: by a trade but also two you never miss a major trend like when I was when I was younger I don't
1583.38s: feel Ralph Accompora one of the co-founders at the anti association yeah he used to come to Montreal a
1587.86s: lot where I was running the chapter and then I ran the national technical analysis organization here
1592.82s: and I remember him talking saying that you know the biggest mistake you can make in this business
1596.42s: because I was young I was like 21 and he was already like the godfather technical analysis and
1600.26s: he's super nice guy and he told me the biggest mistake you could make is like get on the wrong
1603.94s: side of a major trend like never ever get on the wrong side of a major trend so I always kind of
1608.50s: took that to heart so I've made these like guideline rules where just like you know to kind of
1612.82s: full circle from our talk before even if I'm out or I'm trading light I have these rules that
1617.06s: will force me to okay I have to find something to buy or I have to build exposure because my risk
1622.90s: is you stay you stay on the outside lines you got comfortable maybe get a little bit lazy and you
1628.50s: miss out on the opportunity been waiting for so I always have these like strong technical guidelines to
1632.50s: keep me looking in the right areas. Got it and so for like a lay trader we don't have to go super
1638.50s: far in the detail on your guidelines but what are some of the things that they could start to look at
1642.66s: to help them with that. So you can look at different ways you can look at you can have just like
1648.34s: you know general trend rules like you know above key averages or you know that's like really
1653.46s: simplified I think there's I think there's drawbacks to that because it's kind of whipsaws like I know
1659.62s: Ray Dahlie originally his original systems had moving averages and things and he eventually moved
1663.54s: away from that because of the drawbacks and I've seen some of those two so I prefer market breadth
1668.02s: because especially like the way I trade like there's those three four month environments where
1674.90s: things rock and roll where you really want to be exposed and there's a certain kind of kind of
1680.26s: construction to what those environments look like you know similar like similar to like a
1684.18s: financial price like a banking panic you know you just had in March if you look at the action in
1687.78s: March if you look at like COVID drop like even bad markets have a certain character to them so these
1692.58s: kind of like great environments have a certain character for me market breadth like the internals the
1696.74s: way they're acting whether accelerating or decelerating above key thresholds to me that's a better
1701.46s: indication is the overall participation so like I like to focus on growth growth tends to be on
1706.82s: the speculative spectrum like that the jumpier stocks like outy so those do well when there's
1711.94s: confidence so when a lot of stocks are participating those start to participate as well but they go
1717.06s: vertical when people are unsure kind of like now large cap work you know so that's why you're seeing
1721.62s: like you know the biggest names like Microsoft Dominique you're not going to get firework returns
1725.62s: because it's things of two trillion dollar company but it'll edge higher if you're looking at the
1729.54s: index indexes you feel bad just say hey look the NASAS moving up but it's like five mega stocks pushing
1734.42s: it higher whereas most stocks are getting killed so for me to kind of give myself like a realistic
1739.30s: benchmark I use market breadth and like key thresholds to know when the participation is rising
1744.90s: yeah I love that and it's actually one of the things that I started trading it's like you I started
1749.78s: in oh seven and the only reason why I didn't blow up is because I was just starting and I was too
1754.26s: scared to like put a bunch of money out but I started looking at kind of a father's sector rotation
1762.98s: strategy and I think that got me not necessarily to the same degree of sophistication that you have
1769.22s: you know with your market breadth analysis but we do look at a lot of similar things I think because
1773.86s: you've talked about things like net highs lows within you know what in exchange or whatever I look
1779.62s: at that I don't know if you use like tick and trend do you use either of those no I never got
1784.02s: into them I never I never really kind of called out to me yeah because I I started using tick trend
1789.70s: and then like an average weighted trend and then kind of made like a composite indicator with
1794.74s: both of them combined which is yeah it's almost like a it's almost like a MACD for moving averages
1799.46s: just using tick and trend but what other like decent breadth indicators do you talk about that people
1806.50s: can find out or do you think people should look into so I try and like like you know with my study
1813.38s: of like technical analysis like I'm a charter market technician so I study so many tools a lot
1817.86s: of them become redundant you know like I remember like it's kind of like the elixir you come and you
1821.86s: think like I have enough lines on my chart I get enough information but so I got that a point
1826.66s: we're kind of like I'm sure like with your military background like you'll appreciate it's like
1829.94s: you know every everything I'm using needs a specific purpose like I need to know why it's there
1834.50s: like I don't want to carry around extra bulk for no reason like you want to be efficient so I have
1838.66s: like so there are many breadth tools you can use even there's a different like you know that you
1842.18s: call them like breadth thrusts you know where there's like massive and so there's like variation
1846.74s: upon variation and so early on I think when most people start they kind of feel like well the more
1851.30s: I have the more signals the more powerful the signal but not necessarily it probably you end up
1856.10s: with like analysis paralysis where you just can make a decision so I really kind of so I know
1861.46s: of more tools I've studied more but I really keep kind of net highs net lows and I also look at
1865.54s: the advanced decline line I use them really for different things so advanced decline I kind of
1870.10s: look for a longer term divergences this kind of tell where I am in the cycle of the market you know
1874.98s: so early on you'll see a lot of participation and as like the the market gets older and a little
1880.74s: more tired it starts to kind of break down so it's kind of like a bigger picture of you and the net
1885.06s: highs and lows are kind of more my intermediate type of view yeah I love that and I think using both
1891.06s: of them in concert makes a lot of sense and your comment there reminds me of one of my favorite
1895.38s: quotes I tell people which is simplicity is the ultimate sophistication in order to eventually
1900.42s: said that and I talk about that a lot with traders because I feel like we all go through this
1904.50s: parabolic curve where we don't know anything we don't know to use anything then we find everything
1909.06s: we try to use everything and then we scrap most of it and use a few things that we probably saw
1913.06s: the first few days that we started as you know I feel like that exists in a lot of disciplines
1918.02s: like I mean I play guitar and like so when you start you want like a million guitar pedals
1921.94s: and effects and then after you look at like these legendary guitarists and all we want is like a
1925.38s: 1968 Fender Stratocaster with a clean amp and they play and you're like how does it sound so good
1930.82s: and then you have like you're doing a tap dance with like guitar pedal so I feel like I feel
1935.06s: something of like just like of like learning in general like like everything you know anyone
1940.90s: was great at something I find they'll say like oh it's simple but it's almost like you have to
1944.18s: learn all the complexities before you can get back to simplicity and that's kind of like the
1948.18s: I think the way of life almost for a lot of stuff dude I literally could not agree more with you I
1953.30s: think going through that phase of throwing everything at the wall seeing what's sticking because
1958.02s: especially in trading specifically but then also on like basketball or I know jack shit about guitar
1963.70s: but my best friend place so I listen to him sometimes but I agree with you we're like everybody has
1969.86s: their slight nuance for like what works sense for them or like what makes sense for them what
1974.50s: works for them what kind of mentally clicks so I think that makes a like a ton of sense especially
1980.50s: with complex systems because if you leave them to be too complex for too long they're kind of
1984.58s: really difficult to manage speaking of the the bank movements that we're talking about before
1990.82s: what do you make of the new stuff that we're seeing with FRC do you foresee kind of this credit crunch
1998.02s: expanding or do you think that they're doing their best to kind of localize it as much as they can
2002.50s: so that it doesn't become a bigger problem well I think that's trying to localize it but there's an
2006.90s: inherent like structural problem the Fed has made with the market where like by raising rates so
2012.34s: fast and banks are not raising their deposit rates it's just in everyone's interest to pull their
2016.26s: money out of their checking account and go put it into like a money market fund or a brokerage
2021.14s: account that's paying higher rate like why would you stay with 1% when you can get five you know so
2026.90s: it's like you're you're just like giving everyone and you know it's like Charlie Munger would say
2032.10s: like show me the incentive and I'll show you what people will do so like the longer you keep the
2035.30s: song people talk say like you're getting 1% like put in some money market fund you can pull it out
2039.54s: tomorrow you're not locked in but you get like five or four and a half or whatever it is at the time
2044.34s: you know so I think the Fed's kind of hoping that they can kind of beat inflation fast enough
2050.18s: so that then they can kind of they can go back lower to kind of stop this in balance but that's
2054.10s: where a lot of this is coming from and a lot of banks have sure are concerned that you know the
2058.50s: longer there's a disbalance like you know that deposit money you know it's kind of you know banks do
2063.38s: so much at the end of the day the majority of their businesses like banking 101 they're trying to
2067.62s: expand for more profit but like the bulk core of what they do is banking 101 so but this
2074.26s: industry environment is causing a breakdown of that normal system it's kind of forcing away
2081.30s: these easy deposits from from the positives to these money market funds where where banks institutions
2086.18s: don't make as much money with with this and they can with re-learning out the positive so I don't
2091.22s: know it's just a it's a really kind of wild scenario it's like kind of like and it's kind of scary
2095.94s: in a sense because they're kind of putting a patch on top of a patch on top of a patch to fix a
2099.06s: problem but at a certain point they better get to a solution or you know things get calm again
2104.42s: complexity the more complex the scenario the more likelihood of breakdown so we want this to kind
2109.38s: resolve itself sooner rather than later dude I was a little surprised I expected regional
2114.50s: banks to be under pressure after like I felt like that was like a good canary in the coal mine
2119.94s: bad bad practices right like their risk management department completely shit the bad fine you
2124.42s: know that happens but I did see that happening I was like that's kind of interesting and then
2129.46s: what's going on with FRC that makes me a little more concerned for just kind of these
2134.42s: smaller regional banks because I imagine what's happening to them is probably happening elsewhere
2140.02s: is there a tradable opportunity there on the rebound from that kind of sector for you or do you
2147.06s: prefer to wait until there's established strength across the full sector before you start dabbling
2155.54s: so you know it's not really like a specialty of mine it's to kind of play those but like I even
2159.70s: when I was day trading I always kind of tried to kind of move away from these specialty situations
2163.78s: because all this like news to come out and it's like whenever you get into these really
2168.90s: you know unique situations this these are what you know it's kind of like the specialist versus
2172.82s: the generalist type of you know discussion and and these are the scenarios where the specialist
2177.86s: really gets ahead like it's rare it's like you know it's like you're a specialist in financial
2181.30s: services and it's like you could be stuck in the wilderness for like 10 years like waiting for
2185.70s: like some real juice to come into your sector and then when it does like okay then it's really
2189.14s: your opportunity to deliver alpha but for someone on the outside where it's like there's all these
2193.62s: kind of like my new differences it's like a hard place to kind of swim so for me it's more a matter of
2198.58s: like I don't really care what happens with with regional banks you know I just you know as
2202.66s: honest not systemic and everything else kind of like improves that'll bring you know risk on
2207.06s: elsewhere and then that kind of opens up the gates for big profits elsewhere but like to kind of
2210.66s: swoop in and try and find like the undervalued regional bank it's not really my like four-day
2215.86s: got it yeah that makes it's on a sense and I was always curious with something like this
2219.86s: if there was at least based on your your studies like a large return to a mean post
2227.62s: you know the catalyst coming to a conclusion because I feel like as I look at the the financial sector
2233.30s: right now most people are like okay how bad is this and then at least from a volatility perspective
2240.10s: the way that I would view that is volatility will be high until we come to a conclusion till we know
2245.30s: the answer and then volatility will naturally contract because now we have the answer and I didn't
2250.10s: know if that was a tradable event for your kind of style but it makes it some a sense too because I've
2254.58s: been talking a lot about that too where it does feel like it's I call it an emotional market
2260.02s: doesn't really mean anything right there's a fuck of words but it does feel like every different
2264.10s: headline I see there's people pitching a fit about something and I'm wondering you know when we're
2270.90s: looking at the broad landscape talking about inflation a second ago my underlying hypothesis
2277.06s: is that it will probably be around for a bit that's my guess I again I'm just a fucking idiot
2283.14s: sit in my house so what do I know not much but I am like from your perspective are you seeing
2290.26s: inflation being something that once we go through the rate hike perceivably in what a couple days
2296.74s: then we'll kind of whatever happens with rates throughout the rest of the year but are you
2300.82s: expecting inflation to kind of stay leveled out for most of this year then maybe coming down next
2306.42s: like how do you view the inflation picture because for me it just it doesn't seem like it's
2311.06s: responding super aggressively to what's been done even so far you know inflation is that one of
2316.02s: those interesting things like especially with finance like now there's financial engineering and
2320.18s: they try and turn into a science when it comes down to things like money and inflation like if you
2324.98s: there's like these geniuses like Ludwig von Mises like like the Austrian school economics like
2330.90s: like just like they were like brilliant in terms of like they had like full of soft reviews of money
2335.22s: and all of this but like when it comes down to like again all this fluff like with banking all
2339.86s: they tried this and that when it comes like banking 101 is inflation is just confidence in the
2343.86s: currency and the amount of you know supply versus demand and so if people start to believe that
2348.58s: inflation will stick around that's that alone will make inflation stick around you ask for a raise
2352.58s: and you ask for a raise and the products go up so they ask for another raise so it's really in the
2356.90s: Fed's interest everyone's interest to really destroy inflation before it becomes entrenched so
2362.66s: like they're looking at like you know estimates like people like forward you know they do polls like
2367.06s: forward expectations for inflation this and that it seems anchored so that's what I think the
2371.54s: economists are concerned about but economists just sometimes get it really wrong like the polls
2375.06s: just don't really adequately explain what people are feeling so they better get under control
2380.26s: because the other side of that is then like a very deep deeper longer recession because you
2385.54s: have to go really aggressive with rates so I'm not sure like again like this Powell like back off
2392.42s: the second you see a recession kind of coming or if the market starts to break down to be back
2396.18s: off right away does inflation surprise and finally really drop off like core core numbers have
2400.82s: been sticking so core like X food and energy you know like the Fed doesn't really care about food
2405.54s: and they figure look it's out of our control like what the rain is and whether there's like a country
2410.02s: invading other can't really control food and energy but like the rest the core is critical and that
2415.54s: has stopped coming down which I think a big concern for everyone so they're gonna go up another quarter
2422.42s: I think what makes this cycle really different than like other ones at the past when you kind
2426.26s: of look at the 70s early 80s even 1990 is debt levels now are so much higher than before in the past so
2433.46s: you know going from zero to five is astronomically right interested more now than it was 30 years ago
2440.02s: and I mean back then there weren't even like you know mortgage products and all the the same way
2444.02s: you know what credit cards are the way they are now so we'll have to see I think it's really I would
2449.22s: it's better that the Fed you know we take our medicine and the market is not great for a bit but
2454.26s: we get back to normalcy then if inflation gets entrenched it ends up being a long-term problem which
2458.74s: is bad for everyone yeah and it's the the thing I find so curious about it all is it seems like
2464.82s: that we're already starting to see things break right and from what we're seeing from the Fed like
2469.30s: I think most people agree like we have more to go in order to get this thing on a wrap so it's
2474.10s: it almost feels like how how well can we keep things strapped together until we do get things
2480.02s: high enough right high enough to control inflation which leads me to the to the last thing I want to
2484.26s: wrap up with here because I know you're going to run in a second earning so far what are your
2489.70s: general thoughts impressed not impressed in line with expectations outside of expectations how do
2493.86s: you feel about them yeah I think I think what's the good part is they're not terrible like there's
2498.74s: some good some bad kind of mixed I think like the bigger the company the more pricing power like the
2503.62s: better the company is doing so and you're seeing and again typical of the economic cycle right like
2508.34s: in not great times big companies do better because Apple has more pricing power than you know
2512.42s: John's you know John's bike shop you know like obviously like Apple people really want an Apple phone
2518.42s: so I kind of in line but nothing great but it's early you know like like this whole inflation
2523.62s: higher interest rates like I don't think it's so much going from zero to five which that is a huge
2528.98s: what's staying at five like if the Fed stays at five for longer like think about every time
2533.62s: the longer we stay here every month that goes by that's more people who's you know Carlyce has come
2537.86s: you and now they have to make the decision that you know rates that were 0.99 or maybe 7.99 you know
2542.82s: or or people's mortgages come you so the longer you stay here the more interest rate debt
2546.98s: products kind of reset themselves at higher rates and the kind of like the way everything becomes
2552.58s: amplified so I think it's a bit early because they just really jacked up rates like at the tail in
2556.58s: the last year so maybe you know companies can get still get by it would be really interesting to
2561.46s: see if this kind of persists so a lot on the Fed I don't think we go much higher if you look even in
2566.82s: the 80s it's when Volker basically took rates above the inflation rate that inflation was killed
2572.58s: and so we're basically there if you look at cores let's say 4.6 or whatever so it rates at 5%
2577.78s: you're basically there how long do we stay here how would the economy gets you know how quick
2582.90s: all these rates reset it's like big questions man it's hard to tell that I find you know sometimes
2587.86s: we try to know what's going to happen next sometimes it's like unknowable I mean if you look at the
2592.10s: Fed they have like 30,000 people working for them best data in the world and Powell will say well
2596.34s: I don't know what's going to happen next we'll have to see what the data is so you know the kind of like
2599.38s: like you said like being your basement say like I know exactly what's going to happen I think that's
2602.90s: kind of like you know being a little bit over the top you know so I that's why I kind of when times
2608.10s: are really unsure like I always try to have a strong view but one times are really unsure I default
2612.50s: to my tools and and it's kind of like you know most of the time you're flying a plane you're looking
2616.66s: out you know the window to see what's going on but if it's a bad storm just I can't have no
2620.98s: visibility I go back to my my indicators and that's kind of what I do in this environment it's
2626.10s: proven well so I can't complain too much yeah it makes a ton of sense and it's funny I always
2631.94s: think that there's a delicate balance because for me I'm naturally interested in markets and
2637.46s: economics I think the way that the systems work are fascinating but I couldn't agree more with
2643.14s: you on the point that there's a difference between that general interest and trading and I always
2647.54s: tell people like if you are more concerned about being right in a prediction than having like
2653.62s: positive expectancy you're gonna it's gonna be real tough fucking go man it's difficult to be right in
2658.18s: the markets um the very last question I lied to you the very last question because you said something
2663.62s: super interested um based on the homework you've done before to me it seems like we raised rates
2671.30s: pretty quickly in a relatively compressed time frame very famous do you have any indication on
2677.62s: what the unwind might look like do you think that it would be a parabolic drop because to me that
2683.86s: sounds dangerous just by severity but I haven't done that much homework to be honest with you
2688.66s: unlike the the actual coming downside so I'd love your thoughts there well it usually does start
2694.26s: to happen pretty quick and if you look at like historical precedent that's how it happens because
2699.06s: like if you look at what the Fed is but like I said and he's right Powell I have to say at least
2703.14s: he's right you know the the the risk of doing too little is worse than doing too much because like
2708.42s: the the fed's point of view is like if things get bad we could always just drop a ton of money
2711.94s: in everybody's lap and everything's fixed but if inflation expectations get unhinged then like
2716.66s: I said that that's a long process to break so I think they naturally even if they won't articulate it
2722.90s: and you know three quarters of the Fed is trying to understand what they're really saying but they
2727.14s: would rather kind of push things too far and start to break things so and after when they see oh
2731.30s: stuff's breaking now it's quick quick let's like throw the kitchen sink at it so typically
2735.30s: push it to a point where it gets pretty rough and then they have to get aggressive to fix it
2739.14s: but that usually does work to fix things but um you know it's like again complexity the the Fed because
2745.70s: of this this way that they've been working they keep taking a bigger and bigger role in the economy
2750.50s: and when they first started 1913 it was supposed to be just lender of last resort like you know like
2754.74s: FRC for example rata money okay here's some money you've gone from that to like controlling the
2760.66s: entire economy different that you know you have you have QE buying bonds and controlling banking
2765.94s: and repo and and so like their hands are everywhere and and I I suggest everyone read the book the
2771.30s: Lords of Finance um which is basically like a recount of like the the the Federal Reserve and
2777.22s: different that bankers in the I forget the era was now I was like the early 1900s and where we
2782.66s: kind of always feel looking at these these people talk like oh they know what's going on and then
2787.38s: 2021's a perfect example where inflation which to some great investors was so obvious I mean
2792.58s: you guys like drunken miller tutor Jones like the same names like we're say like look inflation
2796.42s: is coming and it's like these other guys who are supposed to have all the data all the people
2800.58s: totally blindsided by like the worst inflation in like 40 years so it's it's kind of like to think
2805.86s: that they know exactly like you know people like like to have this false sense of confidence makes
2810.42s: them feel good that like oh don't worry we're under control um but the the Fed doesn't always really
2815.62s: know quite what's right I mean I think 2021 they're they're transitory inflation college like was
2819.70s: historically bad um like they're kind of going along and what what I think is extra tough is like
2825.54s: they definitely have like ivory tower syndrome where like they're disconnected from what the average
2829.06s: person's going through so they're looking at their models and this and that and sometimes boots on
2833.38s: the ground is like just the only way you can get a sense of stuff especially in complicated periods
2836.98s: and the fact that their role keeps getting more and more complex with more like I mean like look you
2841.46s: know because they have like they've affected rates and they have the repo market that now affected
2846.10s: FRC you know because of you know this this spread between money markets and and so it's like you're
2850.74s: having all these second third order effects like it's so complicated that like I don't envy to
2855.70s: like the feds position gets gets like tougher and and look and it's like I always say you know like
2860.02s: you know the United States is like like the like the best historical experiment ever of like free
2864.74s: markets and capitalism but like since the federal reserve like there's this like small central planner
2869.22s: who was like at the core of it that like made his way in where he's trying to control the price of
2872.58s: money and interest rates which is you know like that's why central planning and Soviet Union failed
2878.02s: is because it's an inferior system but yet the feds taking a bigger bigger enroll trying to like
2882.66s: the central planner and it's tough job tough job yeah yeah man dude huge information I can't thank you
2888.90s: enough especially for that last part because that's that's some homework I have to do like I
2892.50s: literally I haven't studied the unwind nearly as much as I've studied the ramping because
2898.10s: typically the unwind is tradable at least based on what I've seen in my limited experience um so
2903.70s: I gotta check out some some more start precedent on the unwind and see yeah just kind of see what
2908.66s: kind of trade these as we can come up with but thank you so much for jumping on the uh
2913.14s: the outlier podcast brother it's it's honestly it's great to chat with you I love hearing your
2917.46s: thoughts in the markets what you're looking at and then for people that want to get a hold of you
2921.38s: I'll drop your Twitter in the notes below along with your website is there anywhere else that they
2925.78s: should look for you yeah I started putting some you if it is on YouTube as well so if they're
2929.38s: watching this on YouTube yeah they got perusal insights and try to do something as markets are
2933.86s: quieter I say you know let me do like the odd film and this and that different educational things so
2939.14s: they can check me on YouTube as well wait I'll make sure that's in the notes and until next time
2943.54s: we'll catch everybody later thanks
