0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick GameStop video because I didn't talk about it yesterday in the
6.46s: market outlook. So I want to level set on the week as it stands out ahead and just keeping
12.92s: it a buck. I don't see a whole lot. Right now it still seems fairly quiet in here.
19.68s: We had a really interesting GME live stream. We do this every Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific
24.24s: time. And the last one we took some time digging into a little bit of GameStop's older transaction.
32.88s: And one of the things that we did notice that was kind of interesting is that if we go into
38.04s: the dark pool feed to just see what kind of transactions are happening and different sizes,
44.24s: we filter this by 5,000 shares. Again, this is specifically for shares. I'm going to filter
49.60s: by GameStop. And we can see that there have been a bit of a run of these 5,000 share blocks.
62.32s: And it's been ebbing and flowing. Now one of the curiosities we had during the live stream was,
68.00s: hey, what did this look like before the cat came back in May? So what we did was actually go back
77.60s: and take a look at essentially what transactions took place through this entire period at that
84.80s: block level. And we can see if we go all the way back, we can see a bunch of them in late May.
91.84s: But if we filter this down and we're like, okay, what does it look like the very beginning of May?
96.16s: I think he came back on the 12th if I'm not mistaken. So if we take like 1 to 10 May,
102.16s: nothing. And then if we go to April out of curiosity and take a look,
107.04s: nothing. But then if we go 13 to 24, we see them really starting to pick up a little bit later.
115.84s: Right? So if you take a look at 21, 22. So what this tells me is a lot of these transactions actually
121.60s: got kicked off by a lot of the movement that we saw. And I don't necessarily think that the 5,000
128.48s: block trades mean a whole lot. I know a lot of people are generally assigning that to
135.12s: roaring kiddie is kind of like a calling card sort of thing. But I think it's a little misplaced.
139.68s: And the reason is because we saw him move 5,000 block lots of options. And that's for a very
147.28s: specific reason. 5,000 lots in options is a much bigger position than 5,000 shares. 5,000 shares
155.68s: is actually quite small on a comparative basis. And just in terms of the market liquidity,
160.88s: it's completely different. So I think some people are maybe mistakenly associating the 5,000
169.28s: the 5,000 lot options trades that he was making. And then we see these dark pool trades hitting
174.64s: at 5,000 blocks thinking, oh, maybe it's him. And I get why everybody's curious. I'm curious to
180.40s: nobody's doing. How could you not be? It's literally, this is literally like one of the most
184.72s: interesting stock market stories that I've ever come across my 17 years doing this. It's fascinating.
192.64s: But again, my job I see as a trader is always to try to look at things as objectively as possible.
198.56s: And like nobody really has any sort of ownership over 5,000, especially when it comes to shares.
207.44s: It's a nice round number. And it doesn't really jump out at me as any one single entity. And again,
212.88s: like we can go back through a bunch of different time frames and see that this has been going on
219.44s: primarily since we started seeing the movement in the beginning mid-May and to June. So I thought
225.76s: that was generally interesting going through that exercise this past weekend. We actually didn't
229.84s: finish. We have to go through a part three of analyzing Rory and Kitty's old trades, which we're
236.00s: going to do this coming Saturday. I think we're in 2021 now. So we're essentially going literally
242.40s: update by update, understanding what the market looked like, what kind of decisions were being made,
246.80s: what kind of trades were being made, what kind of money was moving in and out of the account.
250.32s: Just to again, dive in because it's absolutely fascinating. And so this I think is a data point
257.92s: to be aware of. But it's nothing that's jumping out at me as like it maybe as big of a deal as we
263.92s: might think it is. So if we take a look at today, we can see that there is a handful of these.
268.96s: If we clear out this 5,000 filter, you'll notice that there are still tons of these trades that
273.84s: are just way larger. So what it tells me is that people that are positioning at 5,000, it's because
280.32s: we explicitly we being the royal we whoever's doing this, they explicitly want 5,000 or 5,200.
287.68s: Right. It's not because they're doing it because of a liquidity thing like what we saw when
292.96s: roaring kitty was buying 5,000 lots of options. That was a liquidity consideration. This not so much.
298.80s: This just looks like what different entities want to scoop at. And again, there's plenty of
304.08s: liquidity. There was a 62,000 share transaction today that cleared on the dark pool 1.26 million
309.44s: right through no problem. So there's that. Now if we do take a look over at GameStop and we take a
316.64s: look at the options activity. And I'm actually going to look over this month so far. And
323.12s: let's filter by just people that are buying calls and see what this looks like. So we saw these
328.64s: transactions come through already. We already kind of have the whole deal on those that these
333.52s: came and went. So if I throw the bid back in, you'll see those drop right off. And beyond these
339.44s: trades, it has been exceedingly quiet. Now the again, my assumption is that these are tied together
347.92s: in some sort of way, meaning, you know, whoever made this series, there's more of them further down.
354.24s: But whoever made this series in the 22 and a half probably did these, we don't have that definitively
359.12s: yet. But that's what it looks like. And if I zoom this in a little bit now and just kind of look
364.80s: over the past, you know, week and today, we had the 17 of Jan 2025's. There was a big trade that
375.92s: went through at the 20s over a million dollars, big, big trade. But that was back on the 11th.
381.12s: And this is kind of a longer term exposure. One of the things I'm noticing is for most of these
385.12s: bigger trades, right? So we see 2025, 2025, 2025. Most of these greater than 100,000 premium, which is
392.48s: a bigger trade for sure, they're out into 2025. We're not playing these really aggressive one month,
398.88s: two month, three month front expiration trades. So what that tells me is that there's just a change
405.36s: in positioning compared to what we've seen previously. And if we take a look at the total premiums
410.48s: out there, it's just a little bit lighter, essentially. So if we look at open interest right now,
414.80s: there's 630,000 calls against sub 300,000 puts. That is actually notable call skew in terms of total
422.80s: positions. But this is the difference. If you take a look at these different color bars,
428.48s: you'll see that they're definitely his representation in the 20s. And we typically run pretty front
433.20s: month heavy, but you'll actually see that in 18 oct, there's quite a lot out in 17 Jan, there's
440.96s: quite a lot. So what I'm noticing is that there's being build out of the next primary expiration.
447.60s: And then this front expiration is actually a little bit lighter than it's been historically. So
452.08s: 167,000 out of the 630, that's relatively light for the front expiration cycle than what I've seen.
459.52s: So there's not necessarily a direct takeaway other than the kind of undercurrent of GameStop
467.76s: from an options perspective is slightly different than when it's been a little bit more active.
473.36s: We can see total volume way more calls traded today, 101,000 versus 22,000 puts. But if you'll notice,
481.28s: 40% of those were at the bid or below. Tell us that those are people selling calls. And I understand
488.40s: why because if we take a look at the GameStop chart, it kind of dropped off after earnings and it's
493.44s: been just trending sideways. And even before this drop, which seems big on the chart, but it's actually
499.52s: not that significant, it's been trending sideways essentially from the first of August, something
507.28s: like that, just a general sideways trend. And so now the name of the game is what's the next catalyst
513.60s: that starts to move things a little bit. My guess is that will be some shred of news, either
518.16s: from Rowan Kitty or if the GameStop leadership starts talking a little bit about their plans
524.88s: with their literal pool of gold coins that they have at their disposal. And if we take a look at
532.56s: the volume volume is starting to slow down. So on earnings on the 11th kind of right after
539.36s: earnings, we see that there is a spike of volume 28.9 million, then it dropped to 9.5, then it dropped
546.32s: to 8, then it dropped to 5.9. So volume is downward sloping in here. So that also tells me just from
554.40s: a general trading perspective, it's getting really quiet. Now what does that mean? I don't know.
559.04s: Volatility has come down a lot. Implied volatility percentile right now is only 38 percent, which
565.44s: volatility is a raw figure is still quite high. It's like 90 percent, but for something like GameStop,
570.72s: that's relatively low. So yeah, bit of a quiet period as far as I see it, the next video on GameStop,
577.28s: I'll go a little bit deeper into seeing if there's any interesting positioning and options as I
581.68s: looked through the chains. Nothing was jumping out at me. This 20 set is kind of all over the place.
586.64s: People are still building out kind of the standard fare, but it's just all generally smaller sizes.
592.00s: We're still seeing more activity on the further out of the monies. This continues to be the case
597.36s: anything from these three deltas out to these one deltas. I've talked about that ad nauseam,
602.40s: so I won't beat that drum anymore on why I think for retail traders. That's typically not a great
607.76s: approach. I got to do whatever's right for you, but there's smarter ways to buy options in my
612.56s: opinion and something like GameStop. But that is what it is. So that's what we're sitting for now.
619.36s: Your boys keeping an eye on it. As always, if there's anything I should take a look at, let me know
623.28s: be an outlier and I'll see you all later.
