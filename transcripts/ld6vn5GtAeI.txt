0.00s: What's up, Alias?
1.00s: Today we're going to talk about how this can destroy your options trades continuing
7.68s: with the option Greeks simplified series today we're looking at Vega.
13.56s: At the end of the video you will have an understanding, a reminder of what Vega is, but
17.36s: more importantly how to practically apply it to your trading.
22.00s: Let's start with a reminder, Vega essentially tells us the rate of change of premium per
28.00s: one point change in implied volatility.
32.04s: There are certain traits of Vega that are really, really important to keep in mind.
38.24s: And that's actually what this shows us.
41.32s: On the left hand side what I've done is look at four different expirations, five days,
47.96s: 30, 86, 450.
50.68s: And I plotted three different deltas.
53.84s: I plotted a 20 delta, a 50 delta, and an 80 delta.
58.16s: I picked these so that you can understand the relationship of Vega across time and across
65.12s: moniness.
66.84s: So if we focus first on day-to-day expiration notice how the further out in time you go, the
74.84s: higher this line is.
77.68s: This means longer dated options have more overall Vega period.
84.92s: And you can see that this actually goes down in descending order.
89.32s: So as we go from 450 to the 86 expiration to 30 to 5.
93.88s: This is not hypothetical market data.
96.04s: This is real market data.
97.20s: This is taken from an actual options chain.
101.04s: That's the first thing you have to be aware of.
103.32s: The second thing is the relationship to moniness.
105.88s: Notice how all of these have this little peak that happens at around 50 delta.
111.32s: Vega is going to be highest in any expiration around at the money.
117.12s: Why?
118.12s: Because that's where the most extrinsic value is.
120.88s: That's where there's more total value for Vega volatility to impact because it cannot
126.36s: impact intrinsic value.
129.28s: And if you're super far out of the money there isn't that much extrinsic value out there
134.12s: at all.
135.56s: This is why you normally see it peak around at the money.
140.80s: Why does all of this matter?
142.80s: Well when you decide to trade options, you're going through a bunch of different inputs.
149.84s: Some of which are how does selling premium become impacted by stuff like gamma.
155.52s: And if you're buying options, how does volatility help or hurt me?
161.44s: And I will show you.
163.12s: If we take a look at this plot, this is in RGTI today's 25 October just to give you
169.52s: a sense of what the data is.
171.68s: And I want to show you this peak.
173.80s: So this is looking at seven day IV.
178.00s: I want to show you a couple other things.
179.96s: Notice the relationship between the seven day vol, again something like the 30 day
186.86s: vol.
189.38s: Notice how they don't necessarily move the same.
193.38s: The reason why this matter so much is a lot of times people will make their trade
197.26s: decision based on what the underlying implied volatility is.
202.38s: That's 30 day vol.
205.10s: So if, for example, you choose to trade something in RGTI because you think 30 day
211.62s: vol is really cheap down here at 96%.
214.70s: We can look at what that is in terms of a percentile, but let's just pretend that this
218.02s: is relatively cheap.
219.70s: And you're like, I think it's going to go up in the near term.
222.34s: And so you buy cheaper seven day options.
226.34s: You've now made a massive mistake.
228.62s: You've made your vault decision based on 30 day vol yet you're trading seven day
232.96s: vol.
233.96s: This example, 30 day vol is absolutely crushed compared to seven day vol.
243.12s: So let's take a look at a practical scenario.
245.24s: Let's say that you choose to buy an at the money call that seven days out in RGTI.
252.12s: And I'm going to pretend that this was on the 12th of August.
255.96s: What happens if we fast forward one day from the 12th of August to the 13th?
262.52s: What is what happens to implied volatility?
264.96s: It goes from 152% down to 91.6.
269.84s: Let's see what that does to an option.
271.80s: I plotted an option calculator here with a bunch of different stuff in it.
275.40s: This is actually something that the outlier pro members are building right now for themselves
279.28s: to help do this kind of analysis in a little more hands-on way.
282.48s: So it's useful.
283.48s: It's useful information to have.
285.28s: But you can build your own leveraging what you see here.
287.88s: Easy enough.
289.12s: But I want to show you a specific thing.
291.08s: I've input an option detail.
293.20s: The only thing to note is everything is the same.
296.12s: Except I fast forwarded one day and then I mirror that change involved that you saw in this example here.
306.00s: So going from 152 to mid 90s.
309.00s: Low 90s I should say.
311.04s: And I didn't change any of the Greeks.
314.04s: I purposely want to isolate as much as I can.
318.64s: What everything else looks like.
321.48s: So I have everything else the same.
324.48s: What happens to implied volatility?
326.28s: Imply volatility dumped by 60 points.
329.48s: It's a 39.7% contraction involved.
333.48s: How does this impact your P&L?
335.24s: So again, picture this with me.
337.12s: You bought a call.
338.48s: You paid whatever you paid for it.
340.80s: And then one day passes.
342.60s: Nothing else changes.
343.96s: Price stayed the same.
345.40s: Delta stayed the same.
347.08s: I'm just pretending even theta stayed the same.
349.60s: Everything stayed the same.
350.52s: Vega didn't move.
351.40s: Everything stayed the same.
352.36s: Price didn't move.
353.36s: Just volatility fell.
355.84s: What happened to your option?
358.56s: It gets cut in half.
360.36s: Your option is now worth 52% less than it was one day before.
367.36s: Why does this matter?
368.32s: Well, let's say you bought that call and let's say that it actually went up a little bit.
372.76s: Let's say it goes up by a dollar.
374.48s: Let's say it went up to 39, 84.
377.40s: So we get a dollar change in our delta.
380.36s: What's our net?
382.64s: We still are losing money.
384.08s: We got a dollar change.
385.64s: Okay?
386.64s: Maybe we try getting a $2 change.
388.88s: Maybe now we got to two bucks in.
392.28s: We're still losing money.
395.32s: So the point that I'm making here is that you can have something that moves in your favor
400.20s: directionally.
401.20s: But if you were not paying attention to the vault component to it, then you can lose
405.76s: money.
406.76s: Now there's one other thing you have to be aware of.
410.44s: Impact to a volatility surface do not impact all of the terms the same.
418.24s: Typically speaking, when you have some sort of catalyst, something that's going on in the
422.40s: front, it will impact the front more.
426.96s: And then as you have stuff going on further out, that's not is common.
431.28s: The back doesn't change as much.
433.44s: Again, why does this matter?
435.60s: It's because when we look at a graph like this and we say like, oh shit, those 450 dates
443.60s: to expiration options have a lot of Vega.
446.24s: So if I buy an option and then volatility goes up, I should make a ton of money, which
451.52s: is a good initial thought.
454.16s: But as usual, an option to small nuance than that, you would again probably lose money.
458.88s: Why?
459.88s: It's because the overall volatility doesn't change as much 450 days out.
467.32s: That's a long time for a near term catalyst news to digest and bounce around.
472.48s: That's why you don't see it move as a gross value that much.
476.04s: And again, you can see that represented here.
478.76s: If I keep the seven day vol on and I bring this out to 365 days, just notice the difference
485.64s: in those lines.
487.88s: What do you see?
489.24s: The total deviation off of the 365 days, there's still deviation for sure.
494.92s: But it's nothing like what you see in this near term.
497.92s: Why does this matter?
499.52s: It's because you have to pay attention to two factors that are happening in unison.
503.96s: The first factor is the fact that further out in time has higher Vega, but raw
510.88s: vol doesn't change as much.
513.04s: And then that switches.
514.68s: Near term has lower Vega.
517.00s: But you tend to see much bigger changes in vol.
520.12s: You have to take that into account whether you're buying or selling so that you're not
524.68s: trading vol in the wrong term.
526.72s: Remember, match it to the term that you're trading.
529.40s: But then the second thing is to understand those two very important details on how it
533.04s: behaves so that you do not do stuff.
536.36s: Something happens and then you're like, why did I lose money?
539.64s: It happens a lot.
540.64s: There's no reason for it to happen.
542.36s: Who's now you know this?
543.36s: Be an outlier?
544.36s: See you later.
