0.00s:  What's up everybody? Welcome back to the outlier podcast where we talk all things abnormal.
8.64s:  I got you and Sinclair back again. We're actually just talking a little bit about the whole
13.92s:  tactical ETF, which is ticker HTUS. And you are kind of running down some interesting stuff
21.08s:  that I want to jump back into. But first I just want to welcome you back. Thanks for hanging
24.76s:  out for a little bit.
25.76s:  Yeah, thanks for inviting me. I don't know if I have anything you to say, but it's always
31.60s:  nice to chat.
32.60s:  I'm always able to find and actually I have an interesting at least for me, probably
37.08s:  not for you, but the, you know, from a selfish perspective, I have a couple interesting
40.00s:  things that I want to dive into you. So and it will be relatively new, I think at least
44.60s:  for us.
45.60s:  But I'll save that for a couple of minutes later. I do want to get back over to the ETF.
49.72s:  So talk to me a little bit about HTUS, kind of, you know, what you guys are looking to
54.44s:  do with it and how it's generally ran right now.
59.36s:  Okay, so the HTUS is designed to be a replacement for a passive stock investment like, like SPY.
69.36s:  It's based on the S&P index. But as most of your listeners will know, there are certain
76.72s:  things that help you outperform the stock market. And these things are not in any way secrets.
82.28s:  There are papers written on them. If you go and look up things like equity anomalies,
86.40s:  you'll find all these things like the January effect, the end of the month effect, various
91.44s:  seasonalities around elections, momentum, mean reversion, all of these things. They're
97.20s:  all out there, but they're not as big as a lot of people would like them to be. You can't
103.08s:  just trade one of these things. But if you find 20 of these things, you can put them
109.32s:  all together using the best possible portfolio construction management techniques you can
114.52s:  think of, then you can beat the spools. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying
118.88s:  to do essentially a portfolio of market timing strategies, which we're overlaying with a
125.88s:  couple of volatility strategies as well. So it's meant to be literally a replacement for
132.04s:  SPY. I don't own any SPY in my managed accounts. I do own HTUS because this is literally
138.72s:  all the stuff that I used to do in SPY. So I designed the volatility bits of it. So given
149.60s:  that this is literally the best that I could do for this kind of product, and we do it all
154.32s:  systematically, could you do it yourself? Probably, but could you do it as well as us? Probably
161.52s:  not. I'm going to say, and if you underperform us by 2%, then you're back, you may as well
166.88s:  just support the SPY. Can you talk a little bit more about the volatility inclusion and how
174.08s:  you've added that into the ETF? And one quick ad been note for everybody, this isn't sponsored
178.80s:  in any way. Like we were literally just talking about this. And I had a podcast yesterday with
184.80s:  Michael Guyad, you're probably not familiar with them, but he runs a couple ETFs. And I'm always
190.08s:  just interested in learning about them. I just want it to be clear for the listeners that it's
193.92s:  not sponsored in any way. So anyways, can you talk a little bit about the volatility inclusion
198.56s:  component, though, to the... Yeah, I like the way that light is coming over my shoulder. It
203.20s:  sort of makes me look angelic. You do? Yeah. You won't mean that. I'm not sure I can do anything
211.52s:  about it. I can't see where it's coming from. Anyway, let's, if it gets worse, we'll do so.
214.48s:  It's going to only last for a few minutes. Anyway, so as you probably know, I've always been
219.12s:  interested in sort of retail-ish trading. So I'm not coming up with things that are
228.16s:  low touch, easier to use, that kind of thing. And an ETF, it kind of has to be like that as well.
234.24s:  Like we do charge a management fee, but it's not a hedge fund-like management fee. So everything's
238.80s:  got to be systematic and cheap to run. So the two things we've got in there right now is volatility,
247.36s:  which we call volatility overlays. There's a risk reversal strategy that we use risk reversals to
255.36s:  replace some of the dumpsters. And we've written a paper about that. You can find it on SSRM.
262.64s:  Peer of... All the papers we've done, they're not white papers, they're peer-reviewed papers.
267.76s:  So they all make sense. They've all been hacked to pieces by other finance professionals.
272.88s:  And then we do short-dated volatility selling as well to collect the variance premium.
280.96s:  That's an adjunct to the main thing. The main thing is this market timing model. The
288.72s:  risk reversal replaces about 10 to 15 percent of that. And we put a very small short volatility
296.72s:  allocation on top of that. But it's active. We're not just going to come and
301.12s:  implynally do that all the time. We have rules. There are sometimes theoretically we could go long.
308.24s:  We haven't yet, but it's possible. So that's what we're trying to do. Yeah, so given the constraints
316.88s:  of the fund, this is literally what I would invest in as a long-term equity thing. I mean, it literally
324.64s:  is. Like I don't like I say it. I don't own spy. I do own this. So...
333.04s:  Yeah. And one of the things you mentioned when I first pulled this up on TD Ameritrade's website,
340.64s:  I was looking at the dividend yield and it looked low. And you were explaining why that's the case.
345.92s:  I think it's just kind of an important note when you look at this. Do you want to run through that
349.76s:  again real quick? Yeah, I think this is one of the problems we've had is when you just look at YAHU
354.64s:  finance or something, it shows you the price appreciation, not the total return. And last year was a
363.36s:  weird year because there was a fund reorganization on the legal side and we changed management firms
369.84s:  who were doing the admin for the fund. So the dividend was paid out last year was very small.
376.00s:  Most years our dividend is absolutely enormous because active funds, active ETFs have to pay out
382.64s:  all of their short-term trading profits as a dividend. So if you just look at YAHU finance and overlay
389.84s:  us with SPY, we're going to look like we massively underperform. But we've actually beaten SPY
396.72s:  over the last year, one year, one year, two year and three year, both return and sharp. So it's
404.64s:  going well. And like I said, I know that your listeners understand this stuff and I'm not saying
411.52s:  you can't do it yourself. I hope given that I've taught people they can do it themselves. But I
417.36s:  also think sometimes it's better to just say I know this works, I'll pay someone else one percent
421.44s:  to do it. That's what I'm doing. I wouldn't run this myself in my own accounts.
426.24s:  And how does it fare specifically like based on the SPY, but you guys have some volatility
434.00s:  inclusion in it. So it obviously begs the question, how does it fare during market downturn?
439.52s:  And how does that typically look? Obviously if you're up over the past, I think you said three years
444.24s:  that would include 2022 when we had that down year. But what about something like a 2020? How do
449.28s:  you guys do? Honestly, I couldn't really give you any guarantees on that because we haven't had it.
455.68s:  There are mean reversion elements in our model. So people often think risk reversal,
460.64s:  right? Your short puts, that's going to be risky because if your short puts in the market goes to
464.72s:  zero, you lose a lot of money. You know what? If your short stocks in the market goes to zero, you lose
469.36s:  a lot of money too. And people don't seem to think being long stocks is crazy at all. So we're
474.48s:  literally using that as a stock overlay, a replacement. And yeah, there's convexity, but we actually want
481.52s:  that convexity because there's mean reversion in the models. So if the market goes down, we actually
487.36s:  want generally, because all these things are correlated, generally we want to get longer. And being
493.92s:  short, the risk reversal makes you longer. So I think, and we're also generally long vega because
502.24s:  of the strikes we choose in the risk reversal. So I can make no guarantees on that, but I think we
510.32s:  should be finding a crash. I wouldn't wouldn't be surprised if we outperformed the spiders. I don't
516.88s:  think we're drastically underperform them. But like I said, you never know. And the thing about
523.44s:  crashes, they're all different. You know, it's like everyone always plans for the last war, right? So
533.20s:  it's very difficult to know how you'll perform in any completely singular event like that.
540.56s:  And specifically for the short risk reversal is out of curiosity. When you guys are setting that
546.08s:  up to be slightly long vega, why is that? Is that it because it fits better with the broader portfolio
551.60s:  that way or is there another reason? It just happens if you look at the risk reversal
556.48s:  in a portfolio sense, once you've combined it with all the other stuff we've got, that just gave
560.96s:  us the best risk reward. If you go to the risk reversal paper, we did. There's some explanation
567.12s:  about that, but that paper is only including the risk reversal with a passive allocation in the
573.76s:  index. And we have an active allocation in the index. So it's a bit different.
580.72s:  But typically, we have an unbalanced risk reversal on. We'll be short like 15 delta puts and
588.00s:  long like 25 delta calls. So this is the way it's the best for what we were trying to do.
595.92s:  I see. That's a pre-print version of it. It was published in
600.40s:  the Journal of Trading Strategies, Investment Strategies. I think. Yeah.
609.84s:  I'll see you. And we did the typical thing where the famous person gets the first authorship
618.64s:  even though, and I love the guy, I think he changed two words in the entire paper.
624.72s:  Is that how it works? And then is that also how many stars do you get? How do we go about get
630.00s:  more stars? That just down the bottom here somewhere, there's like going to be, it just links to a
637.60s:  little mini bio for each of us. I see. He might be first, but you have more asterisks, which actually,
648.32s:  I would take them more at. I think you're doing okay. But actually also means I'm the
652.72s:  corresponding author, which means I have to answer any questions that come up. I bet you love that.
659.60s:  Anyway, well, for anybody interested in checking this out, I'll throw a link to the notes in
666.96s:  it below, which funny enough, I'm actually rereading. I'm sure you familiar with the book,
672.00s:  Expected Returns, and it talks about the risk of reversal in there as well. So if you were to give
678.08s:  like a cliff notes version of this study, what would that look like? Of this study? Of this one.
686.72s:  A Delta Hedge risk reversal has significant alpha. So if you don't Delta Hedge it, you can replace
695.52s:  a long stock position with a risk reversal and essentially get an extra boost from that premium.
702.00s:  It's not the same as the variance premium. It's a skewness premium. And be careful, there's got
707.12s:  nothing to do with the skew of the underlying. It's an implied skewness premium.
713.60s:  So yeah, on its own, it has edge. And it has edge that nicely combines in a directional
720.96s:  equity strategy. Yeah. I think one of the interesting parts specifically for the risk reversal,
728.24s:  especially as you're outlining it is, it's kind of like an overlay to the rest of the portfolio.
733.12s:  So when you guys are structuring the rest of the ETF, what's the long term roadmap for it?
743.68s:  Is it to stay spy and that's what's built in and that's the expectation going forward?
749.36s:  One of the reasons why I ask is if you look at any sort of discretionary inclusions where
754.32s:  if it had a higher tech concentration, obviously overfitting, but tech's been crushing it for a while.
760.32s:  Is there anything like that? No, and we don't want to do that. We want to be very honest with people
766.00s:  like this is what we do. If this fits in your portfolio, this is what you should use.
772.00s:  Because style drift is a real problem. Like if the cues, right, let's say tech's not outperforming.
779.76s:  Let's say eggs are outperforming. Well, you know, cocoa. And the cues are like the manager of
785.12s:  that's like, oh man, we've got to get into eggs. And so suddenly here replaces all of the text
789.28s:  stocks with wheat futures. You can't, as an investor, you can't plan that.
795.52s:  Even if tech's underperforming, I want you to stick with it so that I can use that as a building
800.96s:  block in my portfolio. And that was why I was annoyed with SVIX, the inverse VIX ETF, because they
811.28s:  started hedging. And there's nothing wrong with hedging. In fact, I encourage people to hedge. They
818.56s:  do it properly. But I don't want them to do the hedging, because I want them to give me the cleanest
824.88s:  product possible. I'll put it in my portfolio. And then I'll decide what I need to hedge.
830.80s:  But basically giving me a hedge that I'm paying for that I might not need.
836.08s:  Which is, and it's sort of a bit of a black boxy hedge. So I don't really know what's going on.
842.88s:  I rather they just kept it clean, very simple. And I could either buy it or not up to me.
849.36s:  That's actually another interesting question though, from a fund management perspective,
854.72s:  why did they choose to do that? And to add on to that question and be an obnoxious question,
861.04s:  that's too long. I'm also curious how different funds choose whether or not they're going to be a
868.88s:  pure fund, like you're talking about, or more of an adaptive fund that then the investor may or
875.68s:  may not know how this could look five years from now to integrated to their portfolio. But I've
879.84s:  seen both versions of that. Yeah, I'm not really sure. I think a lot of people kind of do whatever
884.64s:  they think sells. Okay. And to be honest, there are so many VIX ETFs and ETFs. I think
892.16s:  isvix probably should have done this from the get go and differentiated themselves from other people.
896.88s:  And then it makes sense. But I wouldn't have gone involved then. So it wouldn't make sense to me,
903.84s:  but as a product, you want to be differentiated from other people. So I think it's just like anything
910.08s:  else. If you're making shoes, you want to make the best shoes you can. But if that means they're
916.08s:  exactly the same as Nike's, that's no good. Because then you've got to differentiate yourself as well.
922.88s:  In terms of the active stuff, it's a bit of a trade off, isn't it? Because
929.68s:  I would never say that what we're doing here is like a museum exhibit. Like if the world changes
936.64s:  enough, I think we should change. Because if the world changes enough, no one's going to want to
941.36s:  have any interest in this. But I think it should be a very slow process. If you're changing every six
948.80s:  months, because the market's doing something that's people can't rely on you at that point,
953.68s:  you're just not a trustworthy piece of a portfolio. I see. So when you guys look at
963.76s:  the performance of the fund, it sounds like you're talking before about pursuing about a beta of one.
971.60s:  Is there a world where that changes or is that the ultimate target that you guys are looking to
977.44s:  run moving forward? We don't have a beta target, but we do, because we have a timing model.
987.84s:  We've calibrated that to be on average a beta of one. But it could go lower, it could go higher
994.32s:  depending on what the model is saying. Like we can be technically 50% short, 200% long. I mean,
1001.76s:  we never have been, but we're trying to make returns risk adjusted returns, rather than target
1009.60s:  the specific beta. I see. That makes total sense. Speaking of funds, I actually had a question I wanted
1016.64s:  to ask you not knowing that we were going to start like this anyways, but it ties in well,
1021.28s:  which is what are your thoughts on the rise of these different zero DTE funds? Like iSPI,
1029.68s:  QQQY. What do you think about them? Zero DTE is a tricky, right? Because there's a huge amount
1038.40s:  of age in them. There really is. For lots of reasons, but that edges and volatility terms
1047.36s:  always with options that's volatility. But the costs are in dollars. So given how cheap zero DTE
1055.92s:  options are in dollar terms, those trading costs are really big relative to your age. So
1064.96s:  people think that the easiest things to trade, they're astonishingly hard to trade. And there
1071.36s:  are enough people who've made, I've made tons of money in the last six months. Blah blah blah. I'm
1074.80s:  sure. I'm sure you have. But really that's a matter of luck, right? If you bought calls,
1081.76s:  if you've done anything involving being long over the last six months, you would have made money.
1086.96s:  So that's not the zero DTE and your brilliance. That's the fact you were long deltas. So
1094.48s:  I'm a bit dubious that these funds can beat the transaction costs. Maybe they can, but
1104.16s:  that is a very difficult thing to do. We spend a lot of time working on transaction optimizations.
1114.56s:  A lot of funds, as you know, don't spend any time on it. And they'll just enter
1120.16s:  either during the closing auction or they'll just blast stuff every day at the same time. And
1126.32s:  I can't see that working long term. And who is the customer base that's demanding?
1135.04s:  I want to pay someone to blast zero DTE, zero DTE, strangles for me. It just seems very odd.
1144.96s:  I mean, I wouldn't go near them at all, personally. It just seems crazy to me.
1149.36s:  Yeah, one of, I was doing a YouTube live session. One of the viewers is the one that introduced me to
1157.12s:  QQQ likes I stumbled across him yet. And we just did like a cursory review of the product itself.
1167.44s:  And funny enough, that's one of the very first things I noticed is that the transaction cost on it
1174.40s:  is pretty awful. And we don't even see the half of it, which I know it's in the process of
1179.76s:  as they're getting their, their fills and whatnot. And I believe the management fees are high as
1184.48s:  two for what they do. They're not great. And what I noticed more than that, especially specifically
1191.60s:  with something like QQQY, is it begs the question, will this outperform by and hold QQQ in any
1198.48s:  capacity over meaningful timeframes? And yeah, I do not want to speak ill of anyone else's
1207.68s:  fund. That's not why I'm here. It just strikes me as something that zero DTE is a very fashionable.
1216.00s:  And once you've got a bunch of ETFs up, it isn't a huge hurdle to list another one.
1222.64s:  So in the same way that the CBOE will list a Vex on, I don't know, apples or whatever,
1228.00s:  at the drop of a hat, because they've done it before, I think a lot of ETF issuers say zero DTEs,
1234.32s:  man, that's crazy. Let's issue of make a ETF on zero DTEs. So I don't know, it just doesn't
1242.88s:  appeal to me, I guess it's the way I would say it. And the other thing I would be careful with is
1247.52s:  the way they obviously they're not doing anything illegal. But be careful because they'll say things
1254.32s:  like the fund has this percentage of income, whereas what that means is they're selling that
1260.96s:  percentage of option premium, which is not the same as income. It might be, but it's also might
1269.12s:  be a stonking huge loss. So just be careful, that's not a dividend to that paying. That's
1277.28s:  part of the risk in the trading strategy. Right. When you look at funds like this, one of the
1286.08s:  questions it rises to me, and I don't know what their AUM is, I don't think that they're very large.
1296.40s:  Okay, larger than I thought, but still not that big, there are three three hundred ten million
1301.28s:  for QQQY, and they were launched back in September 14th last year, looks like. So relatively new,
1312.88s:  this, yeah, September 13th. And I'm curious with funds like this, trading things like zero DTE,
1321.68s:  from a market structure perspective, I'm not going to go down the world of, you know,
1329.28s:  volmageddon and fun and all that. I'm not looking to do that, but I am curious with that kind of
1335.20s:  churn, what does that do to market structure when there are funds that have, you know,
1342.08s:  X hundreds of millions of dollars in our management that they're selling zero DTE options against
1346.56s:  to the open market, specifically to like the market makers and their perspective if they're the
1350.64s:  counter side of those trades. Well, it's probably not the market makers. Market makers will obviously be
1356.56s:  on the counter the opposite side of that trade, but that's because most of the retail flow,
1362.88s:  market makers do that because they're facilitating that particular trade, right? But most of the retail
1367.68s:  flows on the buying side, so market makers have plenty of opportunities to get short. So market
1373.84s:  makers love this stuff because it's their one opportunity to cover a big chunk. And also,
1379.60s:  if these guys are doing it the way I think they would, it's pretty easy for the market makers to
1384.40s:  tailor their responses around it because it's a timed thing if it is. So I don't know, the volmageddon
1393.76s:  thing, you got to remember with derivatives for every buyer there's a seller. So it's not just
1399.84s:  that there's a huge short interest. It's more who blinks first, the shorts or the logs, are the
1407.04s:  shorts, I mean, you got to remember, we know that shorts are DTEs, but what are they long behind it?
1413.28s:  You know, they might be long a ton of two month options, they might kill it in the crash,
1417.44s:  in which case they're not going to worry about the front bit of the curve at all. And the other
1421.60s:  great thing about zero DTEs is even if you lose money, they're gone that night. So they're actually
1427.36s:  from a risk management perspective, pretty easy to deal with. So they, I don't know, at a certain
1435.76s:  point, everything worries you, but they don't worry me necessarily more than a lot of other things.
1441.68s:  I mean, that zero DTE in the market, I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
1449.68s:  What is just cool?
1451.84s:  Got to ask then, what's the thing that you would lose sleep over for a reference benchmark?
1458.88s:  I mean, the only thing that really, it would be really difficult to deal with is a flash crash.
1467.52s:  And that's because that is a feedback loop that happens very quickly for absolutely no reason.
1476.56s:  And there's this idea that market crashes come out of nowhere, but they usually don't.
1482.16s:  Market crashes usually come out after the market's gone up, but then it's stabilized and started
1487.92s:  to come off and then that drop accelerates. So it's very rare that a bubble immediately bursts
1494.56s:  and crashes all the way down. A flash crash could come out of nowhere, though, because it's
1499.76s:  literally driven by someone who's made a mistake. Like, I think the one, the original one was
1505.60s:  some firm in Kansas City had a fat finger or something, and all their program went wrong.
1514.88s:  The amount of lack of execution controls at some trading firms is a bit worrying.
1524.64s:  So yeah, that would be the thing that would make me most nervous, because things can go so wrong,
1530.32s:  so quickly you might not have a chance to adapt, which is one of the reasons people,
1535.68s:  people should be very careful about managing their risk on the basis of if that happens, I'll do this,
1543.04s:  because you might not have a chance, because it might all happen so quickly, or the market might
1549.44s:  just get locked up and you might not be able to trade, or maybe it's your brokerage firm that's
1554.40s:  having that disaster and no one can trade through that firm. So that's the sort of thing that would
1559.60s:  make me nervous. Got it. And for anybody wondering the flash crash that you're referencing, it's
1566.24s:  from 2010, and it was really, really interesting. What was it? It was like 36 minutes long.
1573.68s:  I don't remember all the details. I'll see if I can find a link to throw on the notes, but it is
1577.04s:  an interesting case study on something like that. I actually missed about half of it, because I went
1583.60s:  to the kitchen to make some coffee, and I was talking to someone for a few minutes, and then I
1589.28s:  went back to my desk, and I was like, what the hell has just happened? Then I looked at the charts,
1593.12s:  and I was like, I missed half of the action. I wasn't trading actively at the time, so it wasn't
1601.04s:  a disaster for me, but that's how quickly it happened. Like if I go to get lunch, I might have missed
1606.24s:  the whole thing. Yeah, I think what was it? I think, um, I got what was the magnitude? It wasn't
1613.60s:  like too crazy though. Wasn't it like less than 10% or around 10%. I can't remember. I do remember
1619.68s:  obviously the velocity is, seven, eight percent, something like that. But it was just in the middle
1627.36s:  of a day when nothing else was happening. And of course, when it was happening, you don't know,
1632.32s:  you don't know why it's happening. So you're like, yeah, at that point, you're like, okay,
1637.28s:  it's a nuclear bomb going off somewhere, because this doesn't happen for no reason, but apparently,
1644.08s:  it did happen for no reason. Yeah. Going back to the Zura DTE stuff, from a retail trading
1655.52s:  perspective, how do you think that that fits into their portfolio? They shouldn't do it.
1663.12s:  Why not? The costs are too big. I'll throw it back to you. Why should they do it? They've got
1669.68s:  a lot of options to choose from, right? Just because zero DTs are there doesn't mean you have to
1676.48s:  get involved. Um, if you can trade zero DTs profitably, you can trade one week options profitably as
1683.44s:  well. And the costs couldn't doing that are way lower. So I really can't see any great reason
1692.64s:  that a retail person should trade them. And I also think most brokerages with most retail accounts
1700.56s:  don't let you do a bunch of stuff with them. Like, can you go naked short with any account?
1708.72s:  Can anyone do that? No, I think you have to have certain options permissions, but most people,
1714.96s:  you can just lie literally and get tier three. Um, and that allows naked short positions. No
1721.68s:  problem. The margin requirements are tough, but if you get something like portfolio margin,
1727.44s:  which you don't have to have a lot of money, I think it's like 125 or 150,000 dollars. And once
1731.60s:  you're there and above, you can have portfolio margin. Well, that's the other thing. The margin
1736.88s:  return on margin. If you're paying margin, you got to remember a few years ago, no one paid
1741.44s:  margin for intraday stuff. That was amazing. Just just to clarify, it's not paying as just a margin
1746.72s:  requirement. Oh, yeah, you're trading with margin, not on margin in that scenario. Um, I think now
1753.20s:  there are a lot of brokers actually charge you a margin specifically for that trade. That's
1761.28s:  whereas I think certainly when I was trading weaklies maybe six years ago, they didn't, and you
1768.00s:  could blast any size you liked. It was great. Um, that's interesting. Yeah. Haven't said all that.
1777.36s:  If you have a profitable strategy for trading options, it will do just fine in weaklies.
1784.16s:  Hell, it will do just fine in monthlies. They're all the same. Um, I just can't see any reason why
1790.96s:  you would willingly choose to pay all of those transaction costs, put the same trade on essentially
1797.60s:  five times a week. Why don't you just do one weekly? It's a lot cheaper. And transaction costs says
1803.52s:  you know I harp on about them. It's like termites eating at your house. You don't see them at all.
1811.52s:  And then you'll look at your trends and look at your account at the end of the year. See how much
1815.20s:  money you've paid away in costs? Um, costs, if you can improve costs, it's the best way to improve
1823.84s:  your results. Absolutely without a doubt. No one wants to do that though, right? Because developing a
1829.12s:  strategy is fun. Research is fun. Reducing transaction costs is kind of a grind and a battle.
1838.08s:  Um, and it's more important for retail than anyone else because their transaction costs are higher.
1844.96s:  So they should be working at it more and I tend to find they work at least.
1850.00s:  Yeah, well, I think from the retail trader perspective, at least most of them, they probably just
1855.28s:  don't feel like they have much of a like to stand on. Because I noticed realistically,
1859.60s:  until my account size just grew enough, like the broker didn't give up fine fuck about it.
1865.20s:  They still probably don't for being honest, but the brokers will never care.
1870.24s:  Yeah, it's up to you. And the only way you can reliably reduce your costs is by trading less.
1877.44s:  Like I don't know if you play poker. I don't, I don't really, but I know a few people who do
1881.68s:  seriously. A lot of the art of playing poker is not playing poker. It's just waiting.
1889.68s:  The single best thing most traders could do to improve is by trading less.
1896.24s:  Um, and it's, I mean, is that counterintuitive? I don't know. It's just the way it is.
1901.60s:  Because there aren't edges every second. So you don't have to trade every second. You can wait.
1908.24s:  You know, if you don't see a good, I don't know what kind of set up or whatever you're looking for.
1912.00s:  If you don't see a good opportunity, don't, don't dabble. Because all that dabbling, it adds up.
1919.76s:  Yeah. And that makes sense, especially for a lot of like short term strategies.
1924.80s:  Two notes, though, and I'm curious your thoughts on these. One of the benefits to your DTE,
1930.88s:  as I've seen at least, is you have the ability to leverage the account.
1940.56s:  Because the margin requirement can be derived from existing positions. So if you're long shares,
1946.72s:  whatever the case, you can then still trade your zero DTE options. That it's slightly efficient.
1953.76s:  I'm, it's nothing that I would really lean on as, you know, a base of the argument. But I think
1958.56s:  the broader draw for most people at least, because to be clear, I do trade zero DTE options,
1963.28s:  but it's a small part of my book. And that's for a bunch of different reasons. But I think one of
1968.24s:  the most commonly used arguments in their favor, which I can absolutely see is the risk is off.
1975.12s:  You come the end of the day, the risk is off. And I think we know, at least from analyzing
1979.84s:  most market movements, a lot of the bigger moves occur during off-market hours via gap.
1986.24s:  I would, I would disagree with that second part.
1995.28s:  I mean, there was a study a few years ago, which I don't entirely agree with, but I agree
1999.60s:  broadly with it that short options made money overnight. And long options actually did
2007.20s:  slightly better during the day. Now, that's one of those studies you can't really trade on,
2012.00s:  because no one's going to flip their entire portfolio twice a day. Please don't do that. But
2019.68s:  I do believe that you get paid for the overnight risk premium. Being short options overnight
2025.44s:  is scary. So people will pay to take that fear away. That's where risk premiums from.
2032.24s:  So I don't, I agree with you. It's gone away thing. I would just say, maybe you should be doing
2041.84s:  strategies where you don't want it to go away. You know, I, like you don't take off your entire,
2048.16s:  you know, retirement account every night, which you could, I don't know, the mechanics, but,
2054.48s:  you know, long term stock position, you don't liquidate that every night, because you're going to
2058.64s:  be like, I know I'm going to do better staying in the market longer. And so I would say anything
2064.24s:  you can do with a zero DTE, look for really, if it's entirely the only thing you're trading is a
2073.04s:  move that only happens during that day. And you've looked and you've really looked and it doesn't work
2080.08s:  if you use two day options or three day or weekly or whatever. Go for it. I'm not saying don't.
2085.60s:  What I am saying is be very clear that you're trading something that only happens at that
2091.60s:  time scale. And don't just do it because you want to get a quick fix every day. That's the danger.
2099.68s:  People, I don't know, people like to gamble, right? And yeah, that's great. And I'm a big
2106.00s:  proponent of working with that tendency rather than just sort of like there's no way if you have
2113.68s:  an addiction, you can cure the addiction by saying I'm just not going to do that, right? That it
2119.60s:  doesn't work like that. You've got to replace it with something else. So if you know you're going
2124.72s:  to gamble in short term options, okay, treat it like a learning experience, document the hell out
2131.36s:  of everything you're doing. So you're actually, I think you'll lose money, but at least it
2136.56s:  genuinely is tuition. If you, if you learn something from all of your losing trades, at least it's
2144.40s:  not a total loss. And there's this bullshit, right? That people are always, well, I lost money
2149.68s:  my first four years paying tuition. Well, you weren't. I mean, you were losing money because you were
2155.76s:  doing something dumb. That's not the same as actual tuition, where if you've got the records,
2161.20s:  you can look at them and say, ah, that was a mistake. Shouldn't have done that. You're only
2167.92s:  learning has to be active. Losing money isn't learning, you know, but doing small trades and
2174.40s:  tracking the results, that could be learning. So if you're sitting in front of the screens all day
2180.32s:  and you're really trying to get better, then maybe trade a one lot of zero dTs.
2185.36s:  But seriously, if it's just for learning, a one lot's going to teach you as much as a hundred
2190.64s:  lot. And given I'm pretty sure you'll lose money, why not lose less money?
2196.32s:  Right. Well, in two points there, the first one I couldn't agree more on the the tuition
2202.00s:  comma, I find people they try to just justify shitty behavior with what they think is a smart
2207.60s:  explanation. And it's just laziness. But going back to the zero dTE thing real quick, I think one of
2213.84s:  the return points I would offer to you specifically with respect to the risk with zero dTE,
2224.16s:  at least from a retail trader perspective, a lot of retail accounts are smaller. So to your point,
2230.32s:  I agree with you that in the aggregate in the long run, you would probably do better
2236.64s:  inclusion of costs using slightly longer term timeframes. But I think for smaller accounts,
2242.32s:  a reality that they face this severity. So if there's a big enough overnight move, even on a one
2248.32s:  lot in SPX, that can start to hamper their account. So then would your position on something like
2254.96s:  that be if you're in that camp, then probably not a strategy that fits in your account because of
2260.00s:  sizing? Yeah, I am generally of the opinion that if your account is too small to do something
2269.36s:  safely, you probably are just too small to do that thing. So you should never be in a situation where
2274.72s:  you're forced to do something because of your capital limitations. You should work within those
2281.60s:  capital limitations, not say I want to trade options, but the only way I can do that is with zero
2286.48s:  dTEs. That's a bad justification. You're justifying bad behavior to get around something else.
2292.32s:  Keep at it, work more, get your account bigger, and then trade the thing you really want to trade.
2300.32s:  So don't half-ass it by trading something that you know isn't ideal because it's the only thing
2305.36s:  you can trade. Like that's like that old story about again, the poker player who's playing it a
2311.12s:  game and his friend comes over and goes, you know, that's a crooked game. And he's like, yeah,
2315.60s:  sure I know, but it's the only game in town. You know, that's not the way a professional plays,
2320.56s:  that's the way an addict plays. So don't do that. Although I'm going to be very clear here,
2326.72s:  I trade zero dTEs all the downtime, but I trade them only for specific effects that only happen
2335.52s:  in today. And I mean, I've probably done more work on it than most people. So and even then, I don't
2343.76s:  make that much money from them. So the longer-dated options, way more profitable. It's just that if
2353.92s:  you can automate all these things, then sure, I trade zero dTEs, but they'll weigh down the end of my
2359.36s:  list. And if I had to chop something, that'd be fairly high up the list of things I'd chop. They
2364.48s:  make money, but it's not, it's not astonishing. Right. Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
2371.44s:  I know we're coming up on time to get you out of here. And I definitely need to get to the other
2374.96s:  question I have for you, which is one of the super sleuths in my community showed a tweet that you
2380.56s:  put out that I actually also came across that talked about sports betting and how you have learned
2386.16s:  a bit from sports betting with respect to trading. I would love to tap into that a little bit,
2393.04s:  because you've mentioned sports betting a few times in our conversations. And I have to be honest
2397.52s:  from my perspective, I've always thought sports betting is the same thing as options, slightly
2404.16s:  different market, but slightly different rules to the tools. But I live in California, and there are a
2410.88s:  lot of rules on what you can wage your own. So I'm just curious from your perspective, a little more
2418.56s:  the background behind that, your relationship with sports betting, and specifically how that
2423.76s:  parallels to trading. It's always dangerous to be like trading is like this, because those
2434.24s:  are like trading is just like poker trading is just like chess, because the only people who ever say
2438.08s:  that are people who happen to be experts in one of those in chess. So right, and you're an expert in
2444.40s:  anything. There are probably lessons you can apply to anything else, right, because you've gone
2450.96s:  through a process you've learned something. So you know, like let's say you're a great tennis player.
2456.80s:  You can probably apply the process you weren't through to become a great tennis player to
2462.64s:  being a chef. So I think at a very high level a lot of things are transferable. I used to gamble on
2469.60s:  baseball in the early 2000s. Pretty moneyable. So I kind of got into it by accident, and I just
2480.96s:  had the idea baseball is a very sequential game. So picture pitches, hitter does something, he
2488.40s:  either runs the first base or he goes, sits down, everything then happens again. There's another hit,
2494.64s:  this guy goes over to the next base, so forth, so forth. So it's actually very easy to simulate a
2498.80s:  game in advance. So I had nothing else to do at this point, like literally I was sitting around
2504.80s:  work, nothing to do. So I simulated baseball games and started gambling on that. Just out of
2510.48s:  interest. And then I stopped. Basically that market got much, much harder after money ball came out.
2519.60s:  And after it became easier to get data in an automated form of by web scraping and stuff.
2526.32s:  So I stopped doing it. But I kind of liked, I still dabbled in sports betting.
2534.08s:  I've learned some specific stuff that's helpful in terms of Bayesian analysis,
2539.44s:  empirical Bayes. For example, I found useful. But it's more that I've talked with sports gamblers,
2547.76s:  really good ones. And you just kind of pick stuff up. I mean, someone, I thought it was a pretty dumb
2555.60s:  reply. You know, I don't know the guy. So maybe it wasn't, maybe it was just a
2560.96s:  anyway. He said, I said something like, I've learned a lot over the last five years and he said,
2565.52s:  what have you learned? And I'm like, dude, it was five years. I learned a lot in five years. I
2570.56s:  can't rip that out in a hundred words. So I just was thinking about it, especially talking to a
2576.24s:  couple of the people on Twitter. I have just learned a lot of little things here and there.
2582.72s:  And the longer you do one thing, the harder it is to learn new things entirely from within that
2588.96s:  ecosystem. Like it's very difficult for me to learn a completely new thing about options trading.
2597.04s:  I can learn, I learn all the time, but it's always incremental now. Whereas with sports gambling,
2603.28s:  someone can say something and I'll be like, whoa, that's amazing. Never thought of that. One of the
2608.16s:  other things about sports gambling is it's the way to do it is very orthogonal from the way people
2614.08s:  think you should do it. Like very few professional gamblers bet by predicting the outcome of games.
2622.32s:  Like you're not going to predict that the 49ers will beat the packets. What you're going to
2627.44s:  predict is given that the first quarter spread is seven and the total is 41, what should the total
2636.48s:  game spread be? So you're looking for all these relative value trades and it doesn't really matter
2641.76s:  what the game is. That trying to think there's always there. And I think that applies a bit in
2647.28s:  trading as well. Very few, very few traders make money over the long run by predicting
2658.16s:  if a price is available to you at any time of the day on your smartphone, it's very unlikely
2666.00s:  you're going to make a living by out predicting that market. So in the same way, you're not going
2671.76s:  to make a living betting on NBA games, but you might make a living betting on the little props that
2677.36s:  you put 50 bucks into, bet on 200 of them every day, that's where you make the money.
2684.72s:  So when I bet on games now, I do it completely the wrong way. Like I try and bet on games because I
2689.76s:  want to see if I can predict the winner. But okay, here's another reason.
2694.08s:  What do you want to know? I bet on rugby games because I like watching rugby and I watch
2698.64s:  tons of games every weekend. So why not bet on second division for entropy or whatever.
2704.16s:  And I've got a mole. Now my model has edge. If I just bet what Kelly tells me to every week
2712.96s:  at the same bookie, so I'm betting $284 here, $27 there, massively changing my bets and betting
2721.12s:  on every game, I'm going to get kicked out because it's very clear to the bookie that I'm not
2726.56s:  just a recreational player. I'm not just getting lucky. I'm doing something involving what I think
2734.24s:  is edge. So a bookie at that point will kick you out even if you're not making money. Because I'll
2739.60s:  be like, look, this guy is clearly trying to do something smart. We don't need to deal with that hassle.
2746.72s:  So they won't even wait for you to make money. I'll just kick you out. So what I got, I've got
2751.76s:  this from a book by Ed Miller who's written a couple of books on sports gambling.
2759.04s:  You want to take any opportunity you can that doesn't cost you money to look like an idiot.
2765.84s:  So instead of putting in one bet, people often say parlays are a bad bet because they can pound
2775.12s:  negative edge. But if you have positive edge, they can pound that as well. So if you have edge,
2781.52s:  a parlay is a good bet. So instead of me betting on five individual games, I will
2788.00s:  parlay every single combination of those games and bet 10 bucks on each one. And that makes me look
2793.92s:  like a complete clown, right? Because that's the sort of thing an absolute idiot does. But because
2798.72s:  I have edge, it actually is a good thing for me. And a while back, I hit an eight-way
2805.36s:  parlay by doing all this. And it was a huge win. If I won that amount of money by betting
2811.92s:  like just separately on every game, I would have got kicked out. But in this case, the book he called
2817.76s:  me and gave me a full-time, concierge service because they were like so convinced I was an idiot
2824.96s:  that they're like, we've got to keep this guy around. That's amazing. So that kind of thing,
2829.04s:  and that actually works with trading as well. Like there are sometimes things you, it doesn't cost
2838.64s:  you any edge, but it might act as like a diversifier or it could act as a hedging trade. And if you can
2848.96s:  get things down to the point where there's no edge that you're giving away, it gives you a lot more
2854.16s:  options of things to do. So that was sort of a little aha moment for me. And if you pushed me,
2860.00s:  I probably wouldn't have known that anyway. But sometimes getting things from a different angle
2864.24s:  is really helpful. And I've just talked to smart people, like I said, and I've talked to some
2870.48s:  baseball guys on the Sabermetric side. And it's always fun to talk to smart people.
2876.96s:  Definitely. And it's also cool to just learn. I think it's also really cool to learn another craft,
2882.32s:  right? Because it's again, like you're highlighting, there are some similarities, a lot of
2886.72s:  differences, but overall, that's, that's really really cool. I'm glad to hear you talk about that.
2891.28s:  That would be something I'd love to chat with you more about, but we are at time. We've got to
2895.28s:  get you out of here. You have a hard stop. So I'm not going to let you run over. Before you run off,
2900.40s:  though, is there anywhere that you want to direct people? Do you want me to go check out the whole
2905.28s:  website? Anything like that? We've got two websites because of the way the
2910.88s:  cut-cheap structure. I think if you just Google whole tactical, you'll come to us eventually.
2920.08s:  If anyone, this is, now, see, I'm always terrified of compliance, right? So I don't want to come on
2927.28s:  here and say something that I'm going to get in trouble with compliance. But obviously, we have
2932.64s:  FAQs and stuff on there. So if anyone wants to, they can find all the information they need.
2937.52s:  Just remember, it's total return, which may not show up in price appreciation, or on Yahoo Finance.
2944.64s:  If anyone wants to put a hundred million bucks in, you don't have to do it through the open market.
2949.92s:  We can get your block trade. I'll tell you that. Perfect.
2952.80s:  Yeah, great. For a lot of this.
2956.24s:  And I'll throw a link to the website, though, so that people can find it. But you and
