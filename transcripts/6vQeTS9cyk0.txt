0.00s: What's up everybody? Welcome back to the outlier podcast where we talk all things abnormal.
8.64s: I got you and Sinclair back again. We're actually just talking a little bit about the whole
13.92s: tactical ETF, which is ticker HTUS. And you are kind of running down some interesting stuff
21.08s: that I want to jump back into. But first I just want to welcome you back. Thanks for hanging
24.80s: out for a little bit.
25.80s: Yeah, thanks for inviting me. I don't know if I have anything you to say, but it's always
31.40s: always nice to chat. I'm always able to find and actually I have a interesting at least
36.48s: for me, probably not for you, but the, you know, from a selfish perspective, I have a couple
39.64s: interesting things that I want to dive into you. So and it will be relatively new. I think
44.24s: at least for us. But I'll save that for a couple of minutes later. I do want to get back
48.72s: over to the ETF. So talk to me a little bit about HTUS kind of, you know, what you guys
54.04s: are looking to do with it and how it's generally ran right now.
58.60s: Okay. So the HTUS is designed to be a replacement for a passive stock investment like, like SPY.
69.36s: It's based on the S&P index. But as most of your listeners will know, there are certain
76.72s: things that help you outperform the stock market. And these things are not in any way
81.00s: secrets. There are papers written on them. If you go and look up things like equity anomalies,
86.36s: you'll find all these things like the January effect, the end of the month effect, various
91.44s: seasonalities around elections, momentum, mean reversion, all of these things. They're
97.20s: all out there, but they're not as big as a lot of people would like them to be. You can't
103.04s: just trade one of these things. But if you find 20 of these things, you can put them all
109.44s: together using the best possible portfolio construction management techniques you can think
114.76s: of, then you can beat the spools. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to do essentially
120.80s: a portfolio of market timing strategies, which we're overlaying with a couple of volatility
126.84s: strategies as well. So it's meant to be literally a replacement for SPY. I don't own any SPY
134.12s: in my managed accounts. I do own HTUS because this is literally all the stuff that I used to do
140.84s: in SPY. So I designed the volatility bits of it. So given that this is literally the best that I
151.56s: could do for this kind of product. And we do it all systematically. Could you do it yourself?
156.52s: Probably. But could you do it as well as us? Probably not. I'm going to say, and if you
163.28s: underperform SPY 2%, then you're back. You might as well just support the SPY. Can you talk a little bit
170.64s: more about the volatility inclusion and how you've added that into the ETF? And one quick admin
177.20s: note for everybody, this isn't sponsored in any way. We were literally just talking about this.
181.04s: And I had a podcast yesterday with Michael Guyad, you're probably not familiar with them, but he runs
187.84s: a couple ETFs. And I'm always just interested in learning about them. I just wanted to be clear for
192.16s: the listeners that it's not sponsored in any way. So anyways, can you talk a little bit about the
197.12s: volatility inclusion component, though, to the... Yeah, I like the way that light is coming over my
202.72s: shoulder. It sort of makes me look angelic. You do? Yeah. You won't mean that. I'm not sure I can do
211.20s: anything about it. I can't see where it's coming from. Anyway, let's if it gets worse, we'll do so.
214.48s: It's going to only last for a few minutes. Anyway, so as you probably know, I've always been interested in
220.00s: sort of retail-ish trading. So I'm not coming up with things that are low touch,
229.68s: easier to use, that kind of thing. And an ETF, it kind of has to be like that as well. Like we do
234.72s: charge a management fee, but it's not a hedge fund-like management fee. So everything's got to be
240.08s: systematic and cheap to run. So the two things we've got in there right now is volatility,
247.36s: which we call volatility overlays. There's a risk reversal strategy that we use risk reversals to
255.36s: replace some of the dumpsters. And we've written a paper about that. You can find it on SSRM.
262.64s: Peer of... All of the papers we've done, they're not white papers, they're peer-reviewed papers.
267.76s: So they all make sense. They've all been hacked to pieces by other finance professionals.
272.88s: And then we do short-dated volatility selling as well to collect the variance premium.
280.96s: That's an adjunct to the main thing. The main thing is this market timing model.
287.44s: The risk reversal replaces about 10 to 15 percent of that. And we put a very small short volatility
296.72s: allocation on top of that. But it's active. We're not just going to come and
301.12s: imblindly do that all the time. We have rules. There are sometimes theoretically we could go long.
308.24s: We haven't yet, but it's possible. So that's what we're trying to do. Yeah, so given the constraints
316.88s: of the fund, this is literally what I would invest in as a long-term equity thing. I mean, it literally
324.64s: is. Like I don't like I say it. I don't own spy. I do own this. So...
333.04s: Yeah. And one of the things you mentioned when I first pulled this up on TD Ameritrade's website,
340.64s: I was looking at the dividend yield and it looked low. And you were explaining why that's the case.
345.92s: I think it's just kind of an important note when you look at this. Do you want to run through that
349.76s: again real quick? Yeah, I think this is one of the problems we've had is when you just look at YAHU
354.64s: finance or something, it shows you the price appreciation, not the total return. And last year was a
363.36s: weird year because there was a fund reorganization on the legal side and we changed management firms
369.84s: who were doing the admin for the fund. So the dividend was paid out last year was very small.
376.00s: Most years our dividend is absolutely enormous because active funds, active ETFs have to pay out
382.64s: all of their short-term trading profits as a dividend. So if you just look at YAHU finance and overlay
389.84s: us with SPY, we're going to look like we massively underperform. But we've actually beaten SPY
396.72s: over the last year, one year, one year, two year and three year, both return and sharp. So it's
404.64s: going well. And like I said, I know that your listeners understand this stuff and I'm not saying
411.52s: you can't do it yourself. I hope given that I've taught people they can do it themselves. But I
417.36s: also think sometimes it's better to just say I know this works, I'll pay someone else one percent
421.44s: to do it. That's what I'm doing. I wouldn't run this myself in my own accounts.
426.24s: And how does it fare specifically like based on the SPY, but you guys have some volatility
434.00s: inclusion in it. So it obviously begs the question, how does it fare during market downturn?
439.52s: And how does that typically look? Obviously if you're up over the past, I think you said three years
444.24s: that would include 2022 when we had that down year. But what about something like a 2020? How do
449.28s: you guys do? Honestly, I couldn't really give you any guarantees on that because we haven't had it.
455.68s: There are mean reversion elements in our model. So people often think risk reversal,
460.64s: right? Your short puts, that's going to be risky because if your short puts in the market goes to
464.72s: zero, you lose a lot of money. You know what? If your short stocks in the market goes to zero, you lose
469.36s: a lot of money too. And people don't seem to think being long stocks is crazy at all. So we're
474.48s: literally using that as a stock overlay, a replacement. And yeah, there's convexity, but we actually want
481.52s: that convexity because there's mean reversion in the models. So if the market goes down, we actually
487.36s: want generally, because all these things are correlated, generally we want to get longer. And being
493.92s: short, the risk reversal makes you longer. So I think, and we're also generally long vega because
502.24s: of the strikes we choose in the risk reversal. So I can make no guarantees on that, but I think we
510.32s: should be finding a crash. I wouldn't wouldn't be surprised if we outperformed the spiders. I don't
516.88s: think we're drastically underperform them. But like I said, you never know. And the thing about
523.44s: crashes, they're all different. You know, it's like everyone always plans for the last war, right? So
533.20s: it's very difficult to know how you'll perform in any completely singular event like that.
540.56s: And specifically for the short risk reversal is out of curiosity. When you guys are setting that
546.08s: up to be slightly long vega, why is that? Is that it because it fits better with the broader portfolio
551.60s: that way or is there another reason? It just happens if you look at the risk reversal
556.48s: in a portfolio sense, once you've combined it with all the other stuff we've got, that just gave
560.96s: us the best risk reward. If you go to the risk reversal paper, we did. There's some explanation
567.12s: about that, but that paper is only including the risk reversal with a passive allocation in the
573.76s: index. And we have an active allocation in the index. So it's a bit different.
580.72s: But typically, we have an unbalanced risk reversal on. We'll be short like 15 delta puts and
588.00s: long like 25 delta calls. So this is the way it's the best for what we were trying to do.
595.92s: I see. That's a pre-print version of it. It was published in
600.40s: the Journal of Trading Strategies, Investment Strategies. I think. Yeah.
609.84s: I'll see you. And we did the typical thing where the famous person gets the first authorship
618.64s: even though, and I love the guy, I think he changed two words in the entire paper.
624.72s: Is that how it works? And then is that also how many stars do you get? How do we go about get
630.00s: more stars? That just down the bottom here somewhere, there's like going to be, it just links to a
637.60s: little mini bio for each of us. I see. He might be first, but you have more asterisks, which actually,
648.32s: I would take them more at. I think you're doing okay. But actually also means I'm the
652.72s: corresponding author, which means I have to answer any questions that come up. I bet you love that.
659.60s: Anyway, well, for anybody interested in checking this out, I'll throw a link to the notes in
666.96s: it below, which funny enough, I'm actually rereading. I'm sure you familiar with the book,
672.00s: Expected Returns, and it talks about the risk of reversal in there as well. So if you were to give
678.08s: like a cliff notes version of this study, what would that look like? Of this study? Of this one.
686.72s: A Delta Hedge risk reversal has significant alpha. So if you don't Delta Hedge it, you can replace
695.52s: a long stock position with a risk reversal and essentially get an extra boost from that premium.
702.00s: It's not the same as the variance premium. It's a skewness premium. And be careful, there's got
707.12s: nothing to do with the skew of the underlying. It's an implied skewness premium.
713.60s: So yeah, on its own, it has edge. And it has edge that nicely combines in a directional
720.96s: equity strategy. Yeah. I think one of the interesting parts specifically for the risk reversal,
728.24s: especially as you're outlining it is, it's kind of like an overlay to the rest of the portfolio.
733.12s: So when you guys are structuring the rest of the ETF, what's the long-term roadmap for it?
743.68s: Is it to stay spy and that's what's built in and that's the expectation going forward?
749.36s: One of the reasons why I ask is if you look at any sort of discretionary inclusions where
754.32s: if it had a higher tech concentration, obviously overfitting, but tech's been crushing it for a while.
760.32s: Is there anything like that? No, and we don't want to do that. We want it to be very honest with
765.60s: people like this is what we do. If this fits in your portfolio, this is what you should use.
772.00s: Because style drift is a real problem. Like if the cues, right, let's say tech's not outperforming.
779.76s: Let's say eggs are outperforming. Well, you know, cocoa. And the cues are like the manager of
785.12s: that's like, oh man, we've got to get into eggs. And so suddenly here replaces all of the text
789.28s: stocks with wheat futures. You can't, as an investor, you can't plan that. Even if tech's underperforming,
797.28s: I want you to stick with it so that I can use that as a building block in my portfolio.
803.36s: And that was why I was annoyed with SVIX, the inverse VIX ETF, because they started hedging.
813.20s: And there's nothing wrong with hedging. In fact, I encourage people to hedge. They do it properly.
819.68s: But I don't want them to do the hedging because I want them to give me the cleanest product possible.
826.48s: I'll put it in my portfolio and then I'll decide what I need to hedge.
830.80s: But basically giving me a hedge that I'm paying for that I might not need.
835.12s: Which is, and it's sort of a bit of a black boxy hedge.
839.92s: So I don't really know what's going on. I rather they just kept it clean,
844.96s: very simple and I could either buy it or not up to me.
849.36s: That's actually another interesting question though, from a fun management perspective,
854.64s: why did they choose to do that? And to add on to that question and be an obnoxious question
861.04s: that's too long, I'm also curious how different funds choose whether or not they're going to be a
868.88s: pure fund like you're talking about or more of an adaptive fund that then the investor may or
875.68s: may not know how this could look five years from now to integrated into their portfolio. But I've
879.84s: seen both versions of that. Yeah, I'm not really sure. I think a lot of people kind of do whatever
884.64s: they think sells. And to be honest, there are so many VIX ETFs and ETFs. I think SVIX probably
892.88s: should have done this from the get go and differentiated themselves from other people. And then it makes
897.60s: sense. But I wouldn't have gone involved at then. So it wouldn't make sense to me, but as a product,
904.72s: you want to be differentiated from other people. So I think it's just like anything else.
911.04s: If you're making shoes, you want to make the best shoes you can. But if that means they're exactly
916.72s: the same as Nike's, that's no good. Because then you've got to differentiate yourself as well.
923.20s: In terms of the active stuff, it's a bit of a trade off, isn't it? Because
929.68s: I would never say that what we're doing here is like a museum exhibit. Like if the world changes
936.64s: enough, I think we should change. Because if the world changes enough, no one's going to want to
941.36s: have any interest in this. But I think it should be a very slow process. If you're changing every six
948.80s: months, because the market's doing something that's people can't rely on you at that point. You're
953.84s: just not a trustworthy piece of a portfolio. I see. So when you guys look at the performance of the
964.88s: funds, it sounds like you're talking before about pursuing about a beta of one.
971.60s: Is there a world where that changes or is that the ultimate target that you guys are looking to
977.44s: run moving forward? We don't have a base at target, but we do. Because we have a timing model.
987.84s: We've calibrated that to be on average a beta of one. But it could go lower, it could go higher,
994.32s: depending on what the model is saying. Like we can be technically 50% short, 200% long.
1001.60s: I mean, we never have been. But we're trying to make returns risk adjusted returns
1008.56s: rather than target the specific beta. I see. That makes total sense. Speaking of funds,
1015.20s: I actually had a question I wanted to ask you not knowing that we were going to start like this
1019.28s: anyways, but it ties in well, which is what are your thoughts on the rise of these different zero
1026.40s: DTE funds like I spy QQQY? What do you think about it? Zero DTE is a tricky, right? Because there's
1037.84s: a huge amount of age in them. There really is. For lots of reasons. But that ages in volatility
1046.40s: terms, always with options, it's volatility. But the costs are in dollars. So given how cheap
1055.12s: zero DTE options are in dollar terms, those trading costs are really big relative to your age.
1062.96s: So people think that the easiest things to trade, they're astonishingly hard to trade.
1070.96s: And there are enough people who've made I made tons of money in the last six months. Blah blah blah.
1074.64s: I'm sure you have. But really that's a matter of luck, right? If you've bought calls,
1081.76s: if you've done anything involving being long over the last six months, you would have made money.
1086.96s: So that's not the zero DTE and your brilliance. That's the fact you were long dealt with.
1092.56s: So I'm a bit dubious that these funds can beat the transaction costs.
1100.48s: Maybe they can. But that is a very difficult thing to do. We spend a lot of time working on transaction
1111.52s: optimizations. A lot of funds, as you know, don't spend any time on it. And they'll just enter
1120.16s: either during the closing auction or they'll just blast stuff every day at the same time. And
1126.32s: I can't see that working long term. And who is the customer base that's demanding?
1135.04s: I want to pay someone to blast zero day zero DTE strangles for me. It just seems very odd.
1144.00s: I mean, I wouldn't go near them at all personally. It just seems crazy to me.
1149.36s: Right.
1150.16s: Yeah, one of I was doing a YouTube live session. One of the viewers is the one that introduced me to
1157.04s: QQQ likes I stumbled across him yet. And we just did like a cursory review of the product itself.
1167.44s: And funny enough, that's one of the very first things I noticed is that the transaction cost on it is
1175.44s: pretty awful. And we don't even see the half of it, which I know it's in the process of as
1179.84s: they're getting their their fills and whatnot. And I believe the management fees are highest too
1184.88s: for what they do. They're not great. And what I noticed more than that, especially specifically
1191.60s: with something like QQQY, is it begs the question, will this outperform by and hold QQQ in any
1198.48s: capacity over meaningful timeframes? And yeah, I do not want to speak ill of anyone else's
1207.68s: fund. That's not why I'm here. It just strikes me as something that zero DTEs are very fashionable.
1216.00s: And once you've got a bunch of ETFs up, it isn't a huge hurdle to list another one.
1222.64s: So in the same way that the CBOE will list a Vex on, like, I don't know, apples or whatever,
1228.00s: at the drop of a hat, because they've done it before, I think a lot of ETF issuers say zero DTEs,
1234.24s: man, that's crazy. Let's issue of make a ETF on zero DTEs. So I don't know, it just doesn't
1242.88s: appeal to me, I guess it's the way I would say it. And the other thing I would be careful with is
1247.44s: the way they obviously they're not doing anything illegal. But be careful because they'll say things
1254.32s: like the fund has this percentage of income, whereas what that means is they're selling that
1260.96s: percentage of option premium, which is not the same as income. It might be, but it's also might be
1269.36s: a stonking huge loss. So just be careful, that's not a dividend to that paying. That's part of the
1278.00s: risk in the trading strategy. Right. When you look at funds like this, one of the questions it
1286.80s: rises to me, and I don't know what their AUM is, I don't think that they're very large.
1296.40s: Okay, larger than I thought, but still not that big, there are three three hundred ten million
1301.28s: for QQQY, and they were launched back in September 14th last year, looks like. So relatively new,
1312.88s: this, yeah, September 13th. And I'm curious with funds like this, trading things like zero DTE,
1321.68s: from a market structure perspective, I'm not going to go down the world of, you know,
1329.28s: volmageddon and fun and all that. I'm not looking to do that, but I am curious with that kind of
1335.20s: churn, what does that do to market structure when there are funds that have, you know,
1342.08s: X hundreds of millions of dollars in our management that they're selling zero DTE options against
1346.56s: to the open market, specifically to like the market makers and their perspective if they're the
1350.64s: counter side of those trades. Well, it's probably not the market makers. Market makers will obviously be
1356.56s: on the counter the opposite side of that trade, but that's because most of the retail flow,
1362.88s: market makers do that because they're facilitating that particular trade, right? But most of the retail
1367.68s: flows on the buying side, so market makers have plenty of opportunities to get short. So market
1373.84s: makers love this stuff because it's their one opportunity to cover a big chunk. And also,
1379.60s: if these guys are doing it the way I think they would, it's pretty easy for the market makers to
1384.40s: tailor their responses around it because it's a timed thing if it is. So I don't know, the volmageddon
1393.76s: thing, you got to remember with derivatives for every buyer there's a seller. So it's not just
1399.84s: that there's a huge short interest. It's more who blinks first, the shorts or the logs, are the
1407.04s: shorts, I mean, you got to remember, we know that shorts are DTEs, but what are they long behind it?
1413.28s: You know, they might be long a ton of two month options, they might kill it in the crash,
1417.44s: in which case they're not going to worry about the front bit of the curve at all. And the other
1421.60s: great thing about zero DTEs is even if you lose money, they're gone that night. So they're actually
1427.36s: from a risk management perspective, pretty easy to deal with. So they, I don't know, at a certain
1435.76s: point, everything worries you, but they don't worry me necessarily more than a lot of other things.
1441.68s: I mean, that zero DTE in the market, I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
1449.68s: What is just cool?
1451.84s: Got to ask then, what's the thing that you would lose sleep over for a reference benchmark?
1458.88s: I mean, the only thing that really, it would be really difficult to deal with is a flash crash.
1467.52s: And that's because that is a feedback loop that happens very quickly for absolutely no reason.
1476.24s: And there's this idea that market crashes come out of nowhere, but they usually don't.
1482.16s: Market crashes usually come out after the market's gone up, but then it's stabilized and started
1487.92s: to come off and then that drop accelerates. So it's very rare that a bubble immediately
1494.16s: burst and crashes all the way down. A flash crash could come out of nowhere, though, because it's
1499.76s: literally driven by someone who's made a mistake. Like, I think the one, the original one was
1505.60s: some firm in Kansas City had a fat finger or something, and all their program went wrong.
1511.68s: That could happen. The amount of lack of execution controls at some trading firms is
1520.16s: a bit worrying. So, yeah, that would be the thing that would make me most nervous,
1528.48s: because things can go so wrong so quickly, you might not have a chance to adapt,
1533.12s: which is one of the reasons people should be very careful about managing their risk on the
1538.56s: basis of if that happens, I'll do this, because you might not have a chance, because it might
1546.00s: all happen so quickly, or the market might just get locked up and you might not be able to trade,
1552.64s: or maybe it's your brokerage firm that's having that disaster and no one can trade through that firm.
1558.24s: So that's the sort of thing that would make me nervous.
1561.76s: Got it. And for anybody wondering the flash crash that you're referencing, it's from 2010,
1568.16s: and it was really, really interesting. What was it? It was like 36 minutes long. I don't
1573.92s: remember all the details. I'll see if I can find a link to throw on the notes, but it is an
1577.20s: interesting case study on something like that. I actually missed about half of it, because I went
1583.60s: to the kitchen to make some coffee, and I was talking to someone for a few minutes, and then we're
1589.36s: back to my desk, and I was like, what the hell has just happened? And I looked at the charts, and I was
1593.36s: like, I'd missed half of the action. I wasn't trading actively at the time, so it wasn't a disaster
1601.76s: for me, but that's how quickly it happened. Like, if I'd gone to get lunch, I might have missed the whole
1606.56s: thing. Yeah, I think what was it? I think, um, I got what was the magnitude? It wasn't like too
1614.00s: crazy, though. Wasn't it like less than 10% or around 10%. I can't remember. I do remember,
1619.68s: obviously, the velocity is seven, eight percent, something like that. But it was just in the middle
1627.44s: of a day when nothing else was happening. And of course, when it was happening, you don't know,
1632.40s: you don't know why it's happening. Or who's it like? Yeah, at that point, you're like, okay,
1637.28s: it's a nuclear bomb going off somewhere, because this doesn't happen for no reason, but apparently,
1644.16s: it did happen for no reason. Yeah. Going back to the Zura DT East stuff, from a retail
1655.20s: trading perspective, how do you think that that fits into their portfolio? They shouldn't do it.
1663.12s: Why not? The costs are too big. I'll throw it back to you. Why should they do it? They've got a lot
1670.16s: of options to choose from, right? Just because zero DTs are there doesn't mean you have to get involved.
1678.72s: If you can trade zero DTs profitably, you can trade one week options profitably as well. And the
1684.72s: costs from doing that are way lower. So I really can't see any great reason that a retail person
1693.84s: should trade them. And I also think most brokerages with most retail accounts don't let you do
1702.72s: a bunch of stuff with them. Like, can you go naked short? Sure. With any account, can anyone do that?
1710.72s: No, I think you have to have certain options permissions, but most people, you can just lie
1716.16s: literally and get tier three. And that allows naked short positions to problem. The margin requirements
1724.08s: are tough, but if you get something like portfolio margin, which you don't have to have a lot of money,
1728.72s: I think it's like 125 or 150,000 dollars. And once you're there and above, you can have portfolio
1733.20s: margin. Well, that's the other thing. The margin return on margin. If you're paying margin,
1739.60s: you've got to remember a few years ago, no one paid margin for intraday stuff. That was maybe
1744.16s: just just to clarify, it's not paying as just a margin requirement. Oh, yeah, you're trading with
1749.28s: margin, not on margin in that scenario. I think now there are a lot of brokers actually charge you a
1757.04s: margin specifically for that trade. That's wild. Whereas I think certainly when I was trading
1764.16s: weaklies maybe six years ago, they didn't. And you could blast any size you liked. It was great.
1772.96s: That's interesting. Yeah. Having said all that, if you have a profitable strategy for trading options,
1781.12s: it will do just fine in weaklies. Hell, it will do just fine in monthlies. They're all the same.
1787.12s: I just can't see any reason why you would willingly choose to pay all of those transaction costs,
1795.76s: put the same trade on essentially five times a week. Why don't you just do one weekly?
1801.20s: It's a lot cheaper. And transaction costs, as you know, I harp on about them. It's like termites
1807.36s: eating at your house. You don't see them at all. And then you'll look at your trends, look at your
1813.44s: account at the end of the year. See how much money you've paid away in costs. Costs,
1820.96s: if you can improve costs, it's the best way to improve your results. Absolutely without a doubt.
1826.72s: No one wants to do that though, right? Because developing a strategy is fun. Research is fun.
1833.36s: Reducing transaction costs is kind of a grind and a battle. And it's more important for retail
1841.76s: than anyone else because their transaction costs are higher. So they should be working at it more
1846.88s: and I tend to find they work at least. Yeah, well, I think from the retail trader perspective,
1852.80s: at least most of them, they probably just don't feel like they have much of a like to stand on.
1857.68s: Because I noticed realistically, until my account size just grew enough, like the broker didn't
1863.76s: give up fine fuck about it. He still probably don't, if we're being honest. But the brokers will never care.
1870.16s: Yeah, it's up to you. And the only way you can reliably reduce your costs is by trading less.
1877.44s: Like I don't know if you play poker. I don't, I don't really, but I know a few people who do
1881.76s: seriously. A lot of the art of playing poker is not playing poker. It's just waiting.
1890.64s: The single best thing most traders could do to improve is by trading less.
1894.96s: And it's, I mean, is that counterintuitive? I don't know. It's just the way it is.
1901.60s: Because there aren't edges every second. So you don't have to trade every second. You can wait.
1908.40s: You know, if you don't see a good, I don't know what kind of set up or what if you're looking for.
1912.00s: If you don't see a good opportunity, don't, don't dabble. Because all that dabbling, it adds up.
1918.80s: Yeah. And that makes sense, especially for a lot of like short term strategies. Two notes,
1925.28s: though, and I'm curious your thoughts on these. One of the benefits to Azure DTE, as I've seen at least,
1932.96s: is you have the ability to leverage the account because the margin requirement can be derived
1944.00s: from existing positions. So if you're long shares, whatever the case, you can then still trade your
1950.00s: zero DTE options. That it's slightly efficient. It's nothing that I would really lean on as,
1956.40s: you know, a base of the argument. But I think the broader draw for most people at least,
1960.96s: because to be clear, I do trade zero DTE options, but it's a small part of my book.
1965.28s: And that's for a bunch of different reasons. But I think one of the most commonly used arguments
1971.04s: in their favor, which I can absolutely see, is the risk is off. You come the end of the day,
1976.72s: the risk is off. And I think we know, at least from analyzing most market movements, a lot of the
1982.16s: bigger moves occur during off market hours via gap. I would, I would disagree with that second part.
1995.28s: I mean, there was a study a few years ago, which I don't entirely agree with, but I agree
1999.60s: broadly with it that short options made money overnight. And long options actually did
2007.20s: slightly better during the day. Now that's one of those studies you can't really trade on,
2012.00s: because no one's going to flip their entire portfolio twice a day. Please don't do that. But
2019.60s: I do believe that you get paid for the overnight risk premium. Being short options overnight
2025.44s: is scary. So people will pay to take that fear away. That's where risk premiums from. So
2033.52s: I don't, I agree with you. It's gone away thing. I would just say, maybe you should be doing
2041.84s: strategies where you don't want it to go away. You know, I, like you don't take off your entire,
2048.16s: you know, retirement account every night, which you could, I don't know, the mechanics, but,
2054.48s: you know, long term stock position, you don't liquidate that every night, because you're going to
2058.64s: be like, I know I'm going to do better staying in the market longer. And so I would say anything
2064.24s: you can do with a zero DTE, look for really, if it's entirely the only thing you're trading is a
2073.04s: move that only happens during that day. And you've looked and you've really looked and it doesn't work
2080.08s: if you use two day options or three day or weekly or whatever. Go for it. I'm not saying don't.
2085.60s: What I am saying is be very clear that you're trading something that only happens at that
2091.60s: time scale. And don't just do it because you want to get a quick fix every day. That's the danger.
2099.68s: People, I don't know, people like to gamble, right? And yeah, that's great. And I'm a big
2106.00s: proponent of working with that tendency rather than just sort of like there's no way if you have
2113.68s: an addiction, you can cure the addiction by saying I'm just not going to do that, right? That it
2119.60s: doesn't work like that. You've got to replace it with something else. So if you know you're going
2124.72s: to gamble in short term options, okay, treat it like a learning experience, document the hell out
2131.36s: of everything you're doing. So you're actually, I think you'll lose money, but at least it
2136.56s: genuinely is tuition. If you, if you learn something from all of your losing trades, at least it's
2144.40s: not a total loss. And there's this bullshit, right? That people are always, well, I lost money
2149.68s: my first four years paying tuition. Well, you weren't. I mean, you were losing money because you were
2155.76s: doing something dumb. That's not the same as actual tuition, where if you've got the records,
2161.20s: you can look at them and say, ah, that was a mistake. Shouldn't have done that. You're only
2167.92s: learning has to be active. Losing money isn't learning, you know, but doing small trades and
2174.40s: tracking the results, that could be learning. So if you're sitting in front of the screens all day
2180.32s: and you're really trying to get better, then maybe trade a one lot of zero dTs.
2185.36s: But seriously, if it's just for learning, a one lot's going to teach you as much as a hundred
2190.64s: lot. And given I'm pretty sure you'll lose money, why not lose less money?
2196.32s: Right. Well, in two points there, the first one I couldn't agree more on the the tuition
2202.00s: comma, I find people they try to just justify shitty behavior with what they think is a smart
2207.60s: explanation. And it's just laziness. But going back to the zero dTE thing real quick, I think
2213.20s: one of the return points I would offer to you specifically with respect to
2221.60s: the risk with zero dTE, at least from a retail trader perspective, a lot of retail accounts are
2228.80s: smaller. So to your point, I agree with you that in the aggregate in the long run, you would
2234.80s: probably do better inclusion of costs using slightly longer term timeframes. But I think for
2241.60s: smaller accounts, a reality that they faced is severity. So if there's a big enough overnight
2247.20s: move, even on a one lot in SPX, that can start to hamper their accounts. So then would your
2253.92s: position on something like that be if you're in that camp, then probably not a strategy that
2258.80s: fits in your account because of sizing? Yeah, I am generally of the opinion that if your account
2267.68s: is too small to do something safely, you probably are just too small to do that thing. So you should
2273.20s: never be in a situation where you're forced to do something because of your capital limitations.
2280.24s: You should work within those capital limitations, not say, I want to trade options, but the only
2285.20s: way I can do that is with zero dTEs. That's a bad justification. You're justifying bad behavior
2290.40s: to get around something else. Keep at it, work more, get your account bigger, and then trade
2298.24s: the thing you really want to trade. So don't half-ass it by trading something that you know isn't ideal
2304.08s: because it's the only thing you can trade. Like that's like that old story about, again, the
2309.04s: poker player who's playing it a game and his friend comes over and goes, you know, that's a crooked
2314.08s: game. And he's like, yeah, sure I know, but it's the only game in town. You know, that's not the way
2319.60s: a professional plays. That's the way an addict plays. So don't do that. Although I'm going to be
2325.92s: very clear here, I trade zero dTEs all the downtime, but I trade them only for specific effects that
2334.64s: only happen in today. And I mean, I've probably done more work on it than most people. So, and even
2343.20s: then I don't make that much money from them. So the longer-dated options, way more profitable.
2353.12s: It's just that if you can automate all these things, then sure, I trade zero dTEs, but they'll weigh
2358.56s: down the end of my list. And if I had to chop something, that'd be fairly high up the list of
2363.52s: things I'd chop. They make money, but it's not. It's not astonishing. Right. Yeah, I definitely agree
2371.36s: with that. I know we're coming up on time to get you out of here. And I definitely need to get to
2374.72s: the other question I have for you, which is one of the super sleuths in my community showed a
2380.08s: tweet that you put out that I actually also came across that talked about sports betting and how you
2385.28s: have learned a bit from sports betting with respect to trading. I would love to tap into that
2392.64s: a little bit because you've mentioned sports betting a few times in our conversations. I have to be
2397.12s: honest from my perspective, I've always thought sports betting is the same thing as options, slightly
2404.24s: different market, but slightly different rules to the tools. But I live in California and there are a lot
2411.12s: of rules on what you can wage your own. So I'm just curious from your perspective, a little more
2418.56s: the background behind that, your relationship with sports betting and specifically how that
2423.76s: parallels to trading. It's always dangerous to be like trading is like this because those
2434.24s: are like trading is just like poker trading is just like chess because the only people who ever say
2438.08s: that are people who happen to be experts in one of those in chess. So right. And if you're an expert
2444.24s: in anything, there are probably lessons you can apply to anything else, right? Because you've gone
2450.96s: through a process you've learned something. So you know, like let's say you're a great tennis player.
2456.80s: You can probably apply the process you weren't through to become a great tennis player to
2462.64s: being a chef. So I think at a very high level a lot of things are transferable. I used to gamble on
2469.60s: baseball in the early 2000s. Pretty moneyable. So I kind of got into it by accident and I just
2480.96s: had the idea baseball is a very sequential game. So picture pitches, hitter does something, he
2488.40s: either runs the first base or he goes sits down, everything then happens again. There's another hit,
2494.64s: this guy goes over the next base, so forth, so forth. So it's actually very easy to simulate a game
2499.04s: in advance. So I had nothing else to do at this point, like literally I was sitting around work,
2505.44s: nothing to do. So I simulated baseball games and started gambling on that just out of interest
2510.88s: and then I stopped. Basically that market got much, much harder after moneyball came out and after
2520.32s: it became easier to get data in an automated form of by web scraping and stuff. So I stopped doing
2527.36s: it. But I kind of liked, I still dabbled in sports betting. I've learned some specific stuff that's
2536.00s: helpful in terms of Bayesian analysis, empirical Bayes. For example, I found useful.
2544.16s: But it's more that I've talked with sports gamblers, really good ones. And you just kind of
2551.52s: pick stuff up. I mean, someone, I thought it was a pretty dumb reply. You know, I don't know the
2558.24s: guy. So maybe it wasn't, maybe it was just a, anyway, he said, I said something like I've learned a
2563.60s: lot over the last five years and he said, what have you learned? And I'm like, dude, it was five
2568.40s: years. I learned a lot in five years. I can't rip that out in a hundred words. So I just was thinking
2574.80s: about it, especially talking to a couple of the people on Twitter. I have just learned a lot of
2580.00s: little things here and there. And the longer you do one thing, the harder it is to learn new things
2587.28s: entirely from within that ecosystem. Like it's very difficult for me to learn a completely new
2594.72s: thing about options trading. I can learn, I learn all the time, but it's always incremental now,
2601.84s: whereas with sports gambling, someone can say something and I'll be like, whoa, that's amazing.
2606.32s: Never thought of that. One of the other things about sports gambling is it's the way to do it
2612.00s: is very orthogonal from the way people think you should do it. Like very few professional gamblers
2618.40s: bet by predicting the outcome of games. Like you're not going to predict that the 49ers will beat the
2625.84s: packets. What you're going to predict is given that the first quarter spread is seven and the total
2632.32s: is 41, what should the total game spread be? So you're looking for all these relative value
2640.24s: trades and it doesn't really matter what the game is. That kind of thing is always there.
2645.44s: And I think that applies a bit in trading as well. Very few, very few traders make money
2653.44s: over the long run by predicting if a price is available to you at any time of the day on your
2663.04s: smartphone, it's very unlikely you're going to make a living without predicting that market.
2669.04s: So in the same way, you're not going to make a living betting on NBA games, but you might make a living
2675.84s: betting on the little props that you put 50 bucks into, bet on 200 of them every day, that's
2682.56s: what you make the money. So when I bet on games now, I do it completely the wrong way. Like I try
2688.72s: and bet on games because I want to see if I can predict the winner. But okay, here's another reason.
2694.08s: We have more time now. I bet on rugby games because I like watching rugby and I watch
2698.64s: tons of games every weekend. So why not bet on second division for entry or whatever.
2704.16s: And I've got a mole. Now my model has edge. If I just bet what Kelly tells me to every week
2712.96s: at the same bookie, so I'm betting $284 here, $27 there, massively changing my bets and betting
2721.12s: on every game, I'm going to get kicked out because it's very clear to the bookie that I'm not
2726.56s: just a recreational player. I'm not just getting lucky. I'm doing something involving what I think
2734.24s: is edge. So a bookie at that point will kick you out even if you're not making money. Because I'll
2739.60s: be like, look, this guy is clearly trying to do something smart. We don't need to deal with that hassle.
2746.72s: So they won't even wait for you to make money. I'll just kick you out. So what I got, I've got
2751.76s: this from a book by Ed Miller who's written a couple of books on sports gambling.
2759.04s: You want to take any opportunity you can that doesn't cost you money to look like an idiot.
2765.84s: So instead of putting in one bet, people often say parlays are a bad bet because they can pound
2775.12s: negative edge. But if you have positive edge, they can pound that as well. So if you have edge,
2781.52s: a parlay is a good bet. So instead of me betting on five individual games, I will
2788.00s: parlay every single combination of those games and bet 10 bucks on each one. And that makes me look
2793.92s: like a complete clown, right? Because that's the sort of thing an absolute idiot does. But because
2798.72s: I have edge, it actually is a good thing for me. And a while back, I hit an eight-way
2805.36s: parlay by doing all this. And it was a huge win. If I won that amount of money by betting
2811.92s: like just separately on every game, I would have got kicked out. But in this case, the book he called
2817.76s: me and gave me a full-time, concierge service because they were like so convinced I was an idiot
2824.96s: that they're like, we've got to keep this guy around. That's amazing. So that kind of thing,
2829.04s: and that actually works with trading as well. Like there are sometimes things you, it doesn't cost
2838.64s: you any edge, but it might act as like a diversifier or it could act as a hedgeon trade. And if you can
2848.96s: get things down to the point where there's no edge that you're giving away, it gives you a lot more
2854.16s: options of things to do. So that was sort of a little aha moment for me. And if you pushed me,
2860.00s: I probably wouldn't have known that anyway. But sometimes getting things from a different angle
2864.24s: is really helpful. And I've just talked to smart people, like I said, and I've talked to some
2870.48s: baseball guys on the Sabermetric side. And it's always fun to talk to smart people.
2876.96s: Definitely. And it's also cool to just learn. I think it's also really cool to learn another craft,
2882.32s: right? Because it's again, like you're highlighting, there are some similarities, a lot of
2886.72s: differences, but overall, that's, that's really really cool. I'm glad to hear you talk about that.
2891.28s: That would be something I'd love to chat with you more about, but we are at time. We've got to
2895.28s: get you out of here. You have a hard stop. So I'm not going to let you run over. Before you run off,
2900.40s: though, is there anywhere that you want to direct people? Do you want me to go check out the whole
2905.28s: website? Anything like that? We've got two websites because of the way the
2910.88s: cut-cheap structure. I think if you just Google whole tactical, you'll come to us eventually.
2920.08s: If anyone, this is, now, see, I'm always terrified of compliance, right? So I don't want to come on
2927.28s: here and say something that I'm going to get in trouble with compliance. But obviously, we have
2932.64s: FAQs and stuff on there. So if anyone wants to, they can find all the information they need.
2937.52s: Just remember, it's total return, which may not show up in price appreciation, or on Yahoo Finance.
2944.64s: If anyone wants to put a hundred million bucks in, you don't have to do it through the open market.
2949.92s: We can get your block trade. I'll tell you that. Perfect.
2952.80s: Yeah, great. For a lot of this.
2956.24s: And I'll throw a link to the website, though, so that people can find it. But you and
2960.08s: as always, absolutely pleasure, man. Thanks for hanging out for a little bit. And then I'm sure I'll
2963.60s: check you down, ask you some more silly questions. But I'll enjoy hearing your perspective and learning
2969.12s: from you. So thank you for hanging out. Yeah, thanks. It was fun. Awesome.
