0.00s: three reasons options Traders lose money
2.40s: I'm going to walk you through one by one
3.90s: and then I'm also going to attach it to
6.12s: what you can do to overcome the problem
9.36s: now I'm not going to go into my usual
11.16s: Spiel of planning or having a trading
13.68s: plan or a trading log although I will
15.90s: throw videos to those in the notes below
18.06s: I think that is an absolute necessity
20.52s: I'm even talking about the first order
23.04s: hurdles that these people run through
25.02s: that they're unable to overcome to even
27.24s: start making money let alone optimize it
29.52s: and become super successful I want to be
31.80s: super clear trading options is difficult
33.84s: but it's not insurmountable it really is
36.60s: a doable Prospect but the problem is a
39.06s: lot of people approach it with the wrong
40.44s: mindset so we're going to talk about
41.88s: that right now and before we get into
43.50s: that a shout out to the patreon members
45.30s: thank you guys so much for the support
46.74s: and let's get straight into the video
48.84s: the very first one is going to be no
50.34s: surprise to anybody it's the YOLO
51.96s: Traders these are the folks that are
53.70s: looking for a lottery these are the
55.20s: people that you see on Wall Street bets
57.42s: and they're looking for those really
58.62s: crazy asymmetric payouts they're gonna
60.66s: have very low win rates
62.22s: [Music]
64.46s: with a high expected payout this is a
67.38s: typically a negatively expecting
68.88s: strategy it's just as if you were to go
70.68s: to the lottery store or to the gas
72.72s: station and buy lotto tickets it's the
74.88s: same exact thing so the problem with
76.74s: this is people want an out they want the
80.34s: idea or the potential to win regardless
83.28s: of how small it actually is but they
85.38s: don't want to put in the effort to build
86.76s: strategies to actually create success it
89.28s: gives them an out they have the ability
91.14s: to try to make some money but they're
92.76s: not putting in any effort and then if
94.20s: they lose well it's no skin off their
96.00s: back they don't really care because it
97.20s: was just a lotto they didn't really care
98.64s: and that creates this really insane
101.04s: cycle where we're literally just
102.72s: throwing money away want to be clear you
104.58s: can actually have asymmetric risk
106.62s: strategies you can have strategies that
108.78s: have really big payouts low win rates
110.76s: but are still positively expecting it
112.92s: still just requires a little bit of
114.12s: effort to get there and most people
115.26s: don't want to do that so this is exactly
117.06s: what we see now when we're thinking
118.92s: about the way we can overcome these
121.26s: lateral traits like I said scaling into
123.60s: strategies again you can be aggressive
126.36s: but they have positive expectancy you're
128.52s: scaling into successful strategies as
131.04s: compared to not even bothering to create
132.84s: a strategy and then you're wondering why
134.58s: you're just bleeding money the next one
136.20s: is the Greeks the evil Greeks the
138.72s: reasons why everything happens in the
140.88s: markets right no not right when we're
142.68s: talking about the Greeks we're talking
143.76s: about Delta gamma Theta Vega Rogue and
145.98s: then even the second order Greeks well
147.66s: technically third order Greeks um charm
149.70s: things like that Vanna but when we're
151.62s: talking about the Greeks it's important
153.54s: to kind of clarify things the Greeks
156.06s: measure stuff they don't do anything so
158.34s: when people say oh fade is killing me oh
160.68s: whatever's killing me Theta is just a
163.08s: measure of indicate time Decay is
165.30s: killing you now when we're talking about
167.28s: though kind of this idea of the Greeks
169.44s: the Greeks in and of themselves there's
171.42s: nothing wrong with them Theta isn't a
173.64s: problem beta is the Boogeyman for long
176.04s: options Traders but there's nothing
177.84s: wrong with Theta because Theta gives you
180.00s: exposure to Long gamma which is actually
181.98s: good the issue is people don't
184.38s: understand how options work to figure
187.38s: out the correct balance for their
189.30s: dispositions this is not the Greeks
191.82s: problem it's your problem it's your lack
194.46s: of understanding of how options work so
196.86s: how do we overcome this well there's a
198.48s: couple things the first thing is I'm
200.28s: actually going to throw a video in the
202.02s: notes Below on an introduction to
204.36s: options that goes through all of the
206.70s: Greeks and how they impact your options
208.56s: which is really important Concepts but
210.60s: let's talk at a few other things the
212.10s: first one is I want you to take a look
214.20s: at your strategies and identify how each
217.74s: Greek impacts your strategy so if you
220.98s: are long an option and you're long gamma
223.44s: that's part of your strategies risk
226.74s: profile if you're long an option what's
229.20s: happening with Ada what happens with
231.00s: Vega and it's not just going to be
232.32s: whether you're long or short it's going
233.76s: to depend on other things like what is
235.86s: the Delta of your option how far out in
238.44s: time is your option those sorts of
240.30s: things do that for all of the Greeks
241.98s: once you understand how the changes in
244.44s: the Greeks impact your position or your
246.30s: strategy the next thing we need to take
247.86s: a look at is what impacts those Greeks
250.02s: so if we know that we're long gamma what
252.48s: does that even mean what happens what
254.34s: what makes gamma move you've got to be
256.32s: able to answer those questions so that
257.88s: you can actually create strategies that
260.04s: work because going back to this most of
262.02s: the lottos that we see out there are
263.94s: super short days to expiration far out
266.34s: of the money options it is no wonder why
269.28s: they don't work that is an awful
271.56s: structure those kinds of Trades have
274.14s: really awful risk profiles they're
276.12s: expensive all sorts of things make them
278.22s: unattractive and if you go through this
280.26s: exercise you'll start to see some of
281.94s: that and then the second thing for kind
283.62s: of over overcoming this focusing on
285.36s: holes I think too many times Traders
287.46s: they're looking at what makes a strategy
289.38s: great why does this strategy seem so
291.36s: awesome for them and they're not looking
292.80s: what's the problem with this strategy
294.72s: where's the risk in this strategy that's
297.00s: what we need to be focusing on when
298.74s: we're looking at the Greeks in relation
300.72s: to an option strategy and how we're
302.70s: trading in general we're not trying to
305.10s: essentially trick ourselves into
306.48s: thinking that this is perfect and
308.04s: everything's gonna be okay we need to
310.02s: identify where the risk is so that we
312.06s: can work around it identify what we need
314.22s: to do to manage the risk to create a
316.32s: successful strategy next the good old
318.38s: 99.9 repeating win rate I hate these and
322.50s: it's because what happens if we have an
324.72s: astronomically High win rate can anybody
326.94s: answer that question and if you can't
328.56s: your average win size is going to be
331.50s: pretty small so the problem with
333.54s: this is this is an ego trade Traders
336.00s: don't like to lose look up the
338.52s: disposition effect this is a super
340.80s: commonly studied Trader Behavior where
343.44s: Trader will allow loser trades to grow
346.74s: and get bigger because they don't want
348.66s: to realize the loss but they cut winners
351.00s: super short instead of letting them move
352.98s: because we like the experience of a
355.08s: winning trade that's the disposition of
356.70s: fact that's what this is so whenever you
358.62s: see these insane win rates you can
361.02s: immediately throw this out as a grossly
363.54s: inexperienced Trader or strategy because
366.36s: a sophisticated options Trader is
369.36s: focused on positive expectancy not win
373.02s: rate so what's the fix here focus on
375.84s: positive expectancy not win rate and if
379.14s: you're not sure what positive expectancy
381.06s: is don't worry I got you I will throw a
383.52s: link in the notes below so you can check
384.90s: that out as well the last thing that I
386.82s: want to talk about is kind of a trickier
388.50s: one so I think it Bears mentioning and
391.14s: this is where retail Traders want to try
393.42s: to do what institutions do this is where
395.70s: you're going to see the retail traders
396.96s: that want to scalp or they're trying
400.02s: different strategies that they think are
402.24s: successful from the institutions side a
404.52s: couple things it's a good mindset your
406.38s: mind is in the right place because
407.52s: typically we want to try and emulate
410.10s: people or entities that are successful
412.08s: at what we're trying to do that's good
413.58s: the problem in this instance is that the
416.28s: worlds between retail Trader and
418.44s: institutions are vastly different that's
421.26s: the tricky part so I think it's good to
424.14s: absorb some of the approach of
426.00s: Institutions having very clear risk
428.28s: profiles having well thought out
430.02s: strategies testing things all of those
432.24s: sorts of things are great to integrate
434.10s: into a retail Trader strategy the reason
435.96s: why I bring this one up is an addition
437.40s: at the end is because it's really
439.08s: nefarious because there is a structural
442.32s: gap between the two you will never have
444.72s: the resources that institutions have you
447.72s: will never have the commission or cost
450.12s: structure that institutions have so
452.52s: whenever retail Traders are trading
454.68s: there's a lot of friction meaning that
456.36s: there's a lot of cost Associated and
458.34s: it's not relegated to just the
460.02s: commissions you see it's things like bid
461.88s: ask spread slippage so on and so forth
463.68s: the institution side doesn't deal with a
465.84s: lot of that or they have ways to
466.98s: circumnavigate it AKA block trades for
469.74s: giant orders they have specific ways to
471.90s: circumnavigate a lot of that stuff
473.34s: that's not to say that retail Traders
474.96s: don't have any advantages we actually do
476.76s: have some but the point being is if you
478.86s: try to emulate exactly what institutions
480.96s: are doing it's not going to work for you
482.46s: as a retail Trader so that's not the
483.96s: right way to focus your energy and if
485.46s: you're curious about the differences
486.54s: between the two you guessed it I have a
488.10s: video that I will throw in the notes
489.24s: below that talks about the difference
490.86s: between Wall Street and Retail Traders
492.90s: because it's important to understand
493.68s: that difference so let me know what I
495.66s: missed if you liked please like the
497.28s: video subscribe share with some friends
498.66s: being outlier I'll see you guys later
