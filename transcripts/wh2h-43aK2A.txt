 Hey everyone, Eric here with a fresh haircut. Finally, I hate having long hair, so it was time to get it chopped off. We have a update for small stacks. Let's jump over the screen and take a look at what we have going on. So essentially, I structured my initial outlay. So what I have is, I have a short put in Excel left, expiring two October. I collected 50 bucks for that, and it's $2,400 to cash secure the position, which is, you know, I'm cash securing these positions. And then I also have a short put in Zinga at $8.50, so that's collecting $27, $850 to cash secure. And then what you see at the bottom is a trade that I have not put on yet, but I'm expecting to, and this is a leap diagonal and forward. Now, in general, I'm not a huge fan of Ford, but the diagonal itself is very appealing to me, and I do like the exposure at this level. This is what I talk about all the time in terms of just short falls of smaller accounts, you're forced into certain, you know, positions and products that I typically wouldn't trade. Like I wouldn't bother with Ford, I would trade something like GM, or I don't know, something that I feel a little more comfortable with in terms of it's standing in the market, but I do think that Ford is still a strong company. I think that they have plenty of support, especially for their trucks and their sports cars, you know, and they've been really reducing their additional offerings to focus on those because that's what's selling. So that is a perspective leap diagonal I'm going to put on, and in that scenario, I will sell at a one to one ratio as compared to at ratio, which I typically do. And the reason being is I just don't see Ford making some sort of huge rebounder skyrocketing from here, especially in the current environment. So with that in mind is why I am going to sell at a one to one ratio, so that this way, you know, I'll collect a little bit more money upfront, I'll cap my upside, but again, being very mindful of my delta selection, I will not have upside risk. So what I'm thinking for the portfolio for the time being is it will look very much like this, where I'll be having, you know, these sorts of trades without the leap diagonal included. I have $77 of credit out. I have $32.50 to cash secure everything, which is a percent and a half return on capital, both of these positions are, you know, 31 and 38 days. So not that far out in time. So overall, I'm very comfortable with the positions I have on and the overall risk I have out. Now two things to note, the first one is, as always, if my short put starts getting challenged, there is a good chance I will roll. And the reason being is, since it is a margin account, I will have more flexibility if I need it to manage the positions, especially in something like Zingha, I will absolutely manage that position. Now, I will make sure I take a look at what the covered call is offering, but in a smaller account, one of my objectives is going to be to get assigned at the lowest possible cost. So as long as I can roll for a credit and continue to reduce my basis, that will be my priority. Then if I find myself in a scenario where I can no longer reduce my basis by rolling, what I will do is see how much credit I can get if I can need to roll just out. And I will compare that to what I could produce in a covered call. And that will be my essentially comparison to see which way I want to go at that point. Well, right now, especially in a small account, basis reduction is a very significant priority of mine because we're dealing with very little capital and with something like XLF, it's already essentially taking up half the portfolio. I'm comfortable putting that there simply because it's a sector ETF, so it has inherent diversification in it. And I do think that financials are at a decent level now. I will look to add a position in XLE in the coming weeks is time goes on. Now, unlike my typical approach, more likely than not, again, not a hard and fast rule for me, but more likely than not, I will leave these positions on until I can take them down for very, very cheap, maybe a penny or two. And the reason for that is I need to squeeze as much as I can out of these trades in order to put some money in the account. As you can tell, again, when we're looking at percentages and gross numbers, it's important to look at both in context because one and a half percent return on capital in about a month is that that's a great return. There's nothing wrong with that. But in such a small account, that's $77, which as a gross number amount, pretty damn low. But the fact of the matter is, again, this is where compounding returns becomes our friend because if these trades work out well, then my new principle isn't gonna be, you know, $5,000, it's gonna be $5,077. And we'll just get the ball rolling nice and slow like that, which is what I've been talking about pretty much this whole time. My goal is to not take this trade or not take this account and just not get out of the park, try to triple it. I do not care to do that. I'm trading this account as if I were starting again, knowing what I know now and what that includes is a very calculated and slow approach that is focused on a good foundation that if things go against me, I don't have to close things for a loss. I can simply hold positions and wait. I think that that's one of the biggest issues a lot of small accounts do is they trade very actively and they put themselves in these scenarios where they have to take all sorts of losses and small accounts simply cannot handle a lot of those losses. So my goal in this account is to reduce those. Now last note is as I was talking about before, my typical goal for stuff like this is to stay as much within the S&P 500 as I can because I think that helps reduce some inherent risk as S&P 500 are typically good performing products. However, I did see an opportunity in Zingha and that's why I took it. I think Zingha in general is a good company. I think that they have a good market that they're still performing well in. So that's why I was willing to venture outside of the S&P 500. Again, it's one of the constraints of a small account. I wouldn't have done this in my regular account because I don't need to, but in a small account finding something that was giving me 3.2% return on invest capital for 38 days on something like Zingha that I think has potential is a good trade for me. So that's why I made it. So I will keep you all up to speed on the leap diagonal. There's a good chance it will either be in Ford or XLE. I will look at both and compare them against one another. But the big thing is I want to, as you can tell, I'm being very purposeful about my correlation. I have financials. Now I have Zingha, which is tech. Then I'm looking at either consumer discretionary, aka automotive or energy. I am purposely starting to touch different places in the market so that I'm not too concentrated in one area and taking that long-term view of developing this portfolio. So we'll see what leap diagonal goes on. I do have the capital left over for it. I still have $1,700 or so, so I intend to use it. And I will maintain close to 100% allocation in the account because it's the only way I see to put some money into the account is to take outsized risk. And I'm comfortable with it because most of the positions are set up whereas they go against me, I can just wait. Hold out for essentially as long as I need to in order for the products to recover, reassessing consistently to make sure I don't need to close because there's been a significant change in circumstance. But before going that potential, I do think that the account can weather most storms if I'm patient. So if anybody has any questions or anything else that they want to see me dig into, as always, let me know. And I will catch everybody later.
