0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here with a fresh haircut.
2.72s: Finally, I hate having long hair,
4.96s: so it was time to get it chopped off.
7.08s: We have a update for small stacks.
10.84s: Let's jump over the screen and take a look
12.44s: at what we have going on.
13.76s: So essentially, I structured my initial outlay.
18.16s: So what I have is, I have a short put in Excel left,
23.60s: expiring two October.
25.72s: I collected 50 bucks for that,
27.56s: and it's $2,400 to cash secure the position,
31.16s: which is, you know, I'm cash securing these positions.
34.56s: And then I also have a short put in Zinga at $8.50,
41.28s: so that's collecting $27, $850 to cash secure.
45.88s: And then what you see at the bottom is a trade
48.72s: that I have not put on yet, but I'm expecting to,
51.76s: and this is a leap diagonal and forward.
55.24s: Now, in general, I'm not a huge fan of Ford,
58.92s: but the diagonal itself is very appealing to me,
63.00s: and I do like the exposure at this level.
67.12s: This is what I talk about all the time
69.44s: in terms of just short falls of smaller accounts,
72.20s: you're forced into certain, you know, positions and products
76.40s: that I typically wouldn't trade.
78.40s: Like I wouldn't bother with Ford,
79.88s: I would trade something like GM,
81.76s: or I don't know, something that I feel
84.00s: a little more comfortable with in terms of it's standing
88.44s: in the market, but I do think that Ford is still a strong company.
93.20s: I think that they have plenty of support,
96.88s: especially for their trucks and their sports cars,
100.40s: you know, and they've been really reducing
102.56s: their additional offerings to focus on those
105.28s: because that's what's selling.
107.00s: So that is a perspective leap diagonal I'm going to put on,
111.00s: and in that scenario, I will sell at a one to one ratio
116.88s: as compared to at ratio, which I typically do.
121.56s: And the reason being is I just don't see Ford
123.88s: making some sort of huge rebounder skyrocketing
128.00s: from here, especially in the current environment.
130.44s: So with that in mind is why I am going to sell
135.48s: at a one to one ratio, so that this way,
138.00s: you know, I'll collect a little bit more money upfront,
139.92s: I'll cap my upside, but again, being very mindful
143.00s: of my delta selection, I will not have upside risk.
147.20s: So what I'm thinking for the portfolio for the time being
152.28s: is it will look very much like this,
154.76s: where I'll be having, you know, these sorts of trades
158.16s: without the leap diagonal included.
160.60s: I have $77 of credit out.
163.24s: I have $32.50 to cash secure everything,
166.76s: which is a percent and a half return on capital,
169.00s: both of these positions are, you know, 31 and 38 days.
172.72s: So not that far out in time.
174.84s: So overall, I'm very comfortable with the positions
179.40s: I have on and the overall risk I have out.
182.36s: Now two things to note, the first one is,
186.24s: as always, if my short put starts getting challenged,
191.28s: there is a good chance I will roll.
194.00s: And the reason being is, since it is a margin account,
198.96s: I will have more flexibility if I need it
202.16s: to manage the positions, especially in something like Zingha,
208.00s: I will absolutely manage that position.
211.04s: Now, I will make sure I take a look
215.20s: at what the covered call is offering,
217.80s: but in a smaller account, one of my objectives
220.72s: is going to be to get assigned
222.72s: at the lowest possible cost.
226.52s: So as long as I can roll for a credit
228.48s: and continue to reduce my basis, that will be my priority.
232.88s: Then if I find myself in a scenario
234.92s: where I can no longer reduce my basis by rolling,
238.88s: what I will do is see how much credit I can get
242.48s: if I can need to roll just out.
245.40s: And I will compare that to what I could produce
247.72s: in a covered call.
249.24s: And that will be my essentially comparison
252.64s: to see which way I want to go at that point.
254.92s: Well, right now, especially in a small account,
257.24s: basis reduction is a very significant priority of mine
262.12s: because we're dealing with very little capital
264.72s: and with something like XLF,
266.40s: it's already essentially taking up half the portfolio.
269.28s: I'm comfortable putting that there simply
271.24s: because it's a sector ETF,
274.44s: so it has inherent diversification in it.
278.20s: And I do think that financials are at a decent level now.
281.44s: I will look to add a position in XLE
284.24s: in the coming weeks is time goes on.
288.76s: Now, unlike my typical approach,
291.64s: more likely than not, again, not a hard and fast rule for me,
295.36s: but more likely than not, I will leave these positions on
298.44s: until I can take them down for very, very cheap,
300.52s: maybe a penny or two.
302.44s: And the reason for that is I need to squeeze
305.48s: as much as I can out of these trades
307.72s: in order to put some money in the account.
310.24s: As you can tell, again, when we're looking at percentages
315.04s: and gross numbers, it's important to look at both in context
319.20s: because one and a half percent return on capital
321.40s: in about a month is that that's a great return.
323.88s: There's nothing wrong with that.
325.44s: But in such a small account, that's $77,
328.44s: which as a gross number amount, pretty damn low.
331.76s: But the fact of the matter is, again,
333.92s: this is where compounding returns becomes our friend
337.52s: because if these trades work out well,
341.08s: then my new principle isn't gonna be, you know,
343.64s: $5,000, it's gonna be $5,077.
346.00s: And we'll just get the ball rolling nice and slow like that,
350.48s: which is what I've been talking about
352.36s: pretty much this whole time.
353.52s: My goal is to not take this trade
356.16s: or not take this account and just not get out of the park,
358.36s: try to triple it.
359.32s: I do not care to do that.
361.32s: I'm trading this account as if I were starting again,
363.88s: knowing what I know now and what that includes
366.36s: is a very calculated and slow approach
369.72s: that is focused on a good foundation
372.92s: that if things go against me,
375.12s: I don't have to close things for a loss.
376.76s: I can simply hold positions and wait.
379.68s: I think that that's one of the biggest issues
381.44s: a lot of small accounts do is they trade very actively
384.72s: and they put themselves in these scenarios
386.88s: where they have to take all sorts of losses
389.56s: and small accounts simply cannot handle
392.00s: a lot of those losses.
394.48s: So my goal in this account is to reduce those.
397.96s: Now last note is as I was talking about before,
401.40s: my typical goal for stuff like this is to stay
404.76s: as much within the S&P 500 as I can
406.84s: because I think that helps reduce some inherent risk
409.20s: as S&P 500 are typically good performing products.
412.80s: However, I did see an opportunity in Zingha
415.48s: and that's why I took it.
416.56s: I think Zingha in general is a good company.
419.48s: I think that they have a good market
421.32s: that they're still performing well in.
423.12s: So that's why I was willing to venture outside
425.40s: of the S&P 500.
427.32s: Again, it's one of the constraints of a small account.
429.64s: I wouldn't have done this in my regular account
431.80s: because I don't need to,
433.16s: but in a small account finding something
434.96s: that was giving me 3.2% return on invest capital
438.20s: for 38 days on something like Zingha
441.00s: that I think has potential is a good trade for me.
444.28s: So that's why I made it.
445.80s: So I will keep you all up to speed on the leap diagonal.
451.12s: There's a good chance it will either be in Ford or XLE.
455.20s: I will look at both and compare them against one another.
459.16s: But the big thing is I want to,
461.20s: as you can tell, I'm being very purposeful
463.72s: about my correlation.
464.88s: I have financials.
466.12s: Now I have Zingha, which is tech.
468.24s: Then I'm looking at either consumer discretionary,
471.00s: aka automotive or energy.
473.56s: I am purposely starting to touch different places
476.92s: in the market so that I'm not too concentrated
479.76s: in one area and taking that long-term view
483.48s: of developing this portfolio.
485.80s: So we'll see what leap diagonal goes on.
488.76s: I do have the capital left over for it.
491.28s: I still have $1,700 or so, so I intend to use it.
495.92s: And I will maintain close to 100% allocation in the account
500.20s: because it's the only way I see to put some money
504.04s: into the account is to take outsized risk.
506.52s: And I'm comfortable with it
507.60s: because most of the positions are set up
509.56s: whereas they go against me, I can just wait.
512.64s: Hold out for essentially as long as I need to
516.80s: in order for the products to recover,
518.76s: reassessing consistently to make sure I don't need to close
521.40s: because there's been a significant change
523.16s: in circumstance.
524.68s: But before going that potential,
528.28s: I do think that the account can
532.60s: weather most storms if I'm patient.
535.80s: So if anybody has any questions or anything else
537.88s: that they want to see me dig into,
538.96s: as always, let me know.
540.32s: And I will catch everybody later.
