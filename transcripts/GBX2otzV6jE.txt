0.00s: What's up, Alias?
2.00s: I got this comment on a GameStop video talking about a position that I've shared with
7.84s: you all and completely transparent about.
11.12s: So as soon as they said, hey, GameStop is down a bit, can you talk about what the current
17.08s: position is and how I manage again?
19.44s: Answers absolutely.
20.44s: Now, for the context here, the video that they're referring to is about a coverage
26.88s: triangle in GameStop, you can check out the last version here.
32.04s: I think there's a third version, as a first version as well.
36.24s: And I can throw the links in the notes below, just like you could see what it was,
39.84s: what it's starting at.
40.68s: But you can see that the allocation that the trade was given was 25 grand originally.
46.32s: This was based on what the community effectively wanted to see.
52.32s: I have a GameStop position in the my personal portfolio that this is just a scaled down
59.24s: ratio version of to fit the $25,000 allocation.
63.60s: So I just apply multipliers to all of it to make it look relevant.
68.96s: Now, the only big change is on that 25 grand.
73.76s: I've changed the allocation specifically.
77.36s: It's now at 50 grand.
79.44s: And the reason why I'm doing that is because I already showed a little bit about a 25
83.68s: grand position, so I doubled it now to 50.
86.88s: And we'll talk about what this all is in a minute.
90.04s: Now, let's talk about what GameStop has been doing.
94.12s: And if we go back to where we started the year, which is right here, we started the year
102.04s: around 31, which is pretty high.
107.44s: And this is as it was really back a little bit and going through this repricing that
115.44s: you saw it.
116.44s: Actually ended up hitting a low of like 273 after which it started rallying back up.
122.36s: We had a little bit of a blow off peak in the mid 30s, cratered after a decent earnings.
129.88s: It traded effectively completely sideways for a couple months.
134.08s: But another soft rally into the high 20s and has now been punished way back down below.
141.12s: And the main thing from a technical perspective here that's interesting is I actually really
145.64s: thought the floor at like 22 hand was going to be a bit stronger.
151.20s: Now the line that you see here at 255, that's nothing new.
155.96s: I've had that drawn for a while.
158.40s: And all I'm doing is using this longer time frame.
161.56s: So where it was balancing out here and balancing out here, realistically there's another
166.80s: kind of smaller one down here at the 18 handlers.
171.16s: So when I'm thinking about what I expect game stop to do, it does seem like it's in a zone
179.16s: where it's very likely to consolidate unless there's some sort of bad piece of news to
185.28s: send it down lower.
186.28s: And we can see it's most recent earnings was actually pretty well received.
190.12s: There's also been a lot of corporate activity going on over these time frames, which
194.32s: does absolutely add movement pressure to the underlying.
198.84s: The main thing is that if a trader had bought game stop at the beginning of the year and
206.88s: just held that position, you're down pretty bad right now.
210.76s: You would have gotten at 31 and now it's at 21.
213.84s: That's a pretty profound move.
217.44s: So really cool thing about the strategy that I use in game stop is it effectively allows
224.44s: me to capture all of the really unique qualities of game stop that make it what it is.
232.16s: So if I think about the qualities, there's really high IV implied volatility for options
240.04s: traders.
241.04s: This is super important even for stock traders because things that have higher implied
244.84s: volatility per centile, it just means that they move a lot, not necessarily one direction
249.48s: or another, but any direction.
251.72s: Now even though for those that trade options, you might see game stop right now with an implied
256.80s: volatility per centile of 17% which is relatively low as a gross number 70% vol is still
266.04s: quite high.
267.64s: So what that tells you is that game stop itself is a very volatile name.
271.80s: Why is this so important because or short premium strategies that can be lucrative?
280.84s: It's not just vol being high in general, but it's more importantly the relationship
288.00s: of IV to RV, which is realized of all.
292.36s: This is what's known as variance risk premium.
294.72s: In general, there's pretty strong variance risk premiums and game stop.
298.68s: So I can show you a display of that here.
301.48s: Don't worry about all the other stuff on this chart.
303.84s: The main thing I want you to focus on is the purple line.
306.40s: If the purple line is purple, it means that there's variance risk premium at the 30 days
310.96s: to expiration window.
313.32s: When it's red, it means that there's not.
316.56s: It means it inverted that the realized move is bigger than implied.
320.20s: The main takeaway that you should pay attention to on this graph is that for the last
324.80s: year, most of the time, the line's purple and not red.
328.56s: That means that they're typically speaking is variance risk premiums.
332.52s: That can be very lucrative and I'll show you some details on that.
336.16s: The other thing is if we think about other profit mechanisms within game stop, the other
343.16s: is the squeeze potential.
345.36s: This is always lurking.
347.68s: Now I do think that the squeeze potential has come down just because there's a lot of inventory
352.16s: available.
353.16s: It's not as hard to borrow.
354.80s: You actually don't even see labeled as hard to borrow anymore, which typically it is.
360.28s: That decreases the overall conditions for a squeeze.
363.08s: It doesn't mean that it's impossible for it to squeeze.
365.00s: It's just decrease conditions.
367.52s: The way that I look to capture this kind of profit mechanism is through long equity.
374.48s: Then potentially long calls.
378.00s: The reason why I favor long equity though is for liquidity, because as something is having
383.56s: a true squeeze, not like this kind of move where it's just doubling and change, which
387.56s: is still a big move, but that doesn't really fit the bucket here.
393.12s: When something is going parabolic, let's say it's up at 80, liquidity in the options chain
398.72s: goes right out the window.
400.28s: It's because volatility skyrockets, which means that the bid aspect spread, if you think
404.92s: about the bid aspect spread, maybe typically it's this far wide, it becomes this far wide.
411.20s: And much more difficult to get a reasonable fill on your trade.
416.84s: Because all of that, this itself is doable, but very difficult to execute, which is why
425.00s: typically favor the equity side of the position.
428.48s: Why do I trade what's called a covered strangle?
434.16s: Because it broadly is optimal.
437.80s: If we look at the individual components or the legs of a covered strangle, we have long
442.52s: equity, right at it, so it's not confusing.
445.20s: We have long equity, which is base position.
449.84s: Then there's short cash secured puts and then short ratio covered calls.
461.28s: The reason why this is such a powerful combination specifically in something like GameStop
465.76s: is because normally speaking with normal names, the puts trade at a premium to the calls.
471.64s: This is known as putsq.
472.96s: This is in a deep options lesson, just stuff free to be aware of.
477.88s: In stuff like GameStop that can have these parabolic upmoves, these calls actually
484.30s: trade very rich.
486.60s: That matters a lot because it means rather than getting paid a decent return on your
490.88s: money on the cash secured puts side of the equation, you actually get a decent return on
494.88s: your money on both sides of the equation.
497.76s: Makes it very profitable.
499.48s: Now there's some more nuance on how I traded around squeeze specifically, but for those
505.92s: that don't know, the reason why I started a covered strangle in GameStop is really more
509.68s: at a solidarity with the ape community.
512.56s: I still consider myself a guest and you guys have been very gracious with me.
517.76s: And I established this position a while ago for two reasons.
520.68s: One literally just to show solidarity and maintain a position in GameStop with you all.
525.20s: Obviously doing what I have to do is a trader because that's what I do is I trade or
529.76s: my income.
530.76s: So I need to make money on stuff.
532.88s: Why does that matter?
534.04s: Well, because if I just bought here and held, I've not made any money really this year at
540.28s: all.
541.28s: So this allows me to monetize the underlying more effectively in a way that makes sense
546.20s: to me.
547.20s: But the second reason and the more important reason is to show you all different ways
552.52s: of doing things, just to give you ideas, not saying that this is the way to do it, not
556.16s: saying you should do this, you should do whatever is right for you.
559.04s: But this is just information so that you know other ways of doing things.
563.32s: Okay.
564.32s: So let's talk about the position now as it sits.
566.48s: I'll give you some summary level details and then we'll go a little bit more in detail.
570.68s: Don't worry about all the noise on the spreadsheet.
572.48s: I'll explain all of it in a few minutes.
575.48s: But the super high level summary really comes from this section.
580.40s: Now again, the overall percent returns on the portfolio are not going to be as good because
586.08s: originally this was based on $25,000 from when I started this exercise, which the exercise
591.40s: was started what in December of 24 it looks like when I started like this specific piece
597.48s: of it.
598.48s: So because of that, this is going to skew down because the majority of it wasn't 50
606.08s: grand allocation, it had less.
608.56s: But that's okay.
609.56s: You should just keep that in a context like the actual return numbers would be a little
612.40s: bit higher.
613.60s: So the realized PNL on the position from when I started is up $3,700.
619.76s: The return on capital is 7.41% that means this realized gain against the total allocation.
631.36s: And then there's a total PNL which includes realized and unreliased, right now relative
639.44s: to the entire allocation, that's 9.8%.
643.20s: Again, this isn't anything that's smashing, but this is where stuff is kind of important.
649.96s: Because if you look at what the underlying was trading at when I started, it was trading
654.84s: at 29.
656.32s: So the underlying from when I started is down 26%.
662.12s: Yet I am up.
664.44s: I'm outperforming the underlying from when I started by almost 40%.
673.28s: That's what matters.
674.72s: And that's what makes this such a powerful tool.
677.48s: And I'll show you what the position sits at today.
680.08s: I'm currently long 600 shares at a basis of 2290.
685.40s: The options position right now, I have two tranches.
690.16s: One that was entered 27 October, one on the 4th of November, both are in the 19th
695.48s: desexperation, both are at the 22 strike.
698.24s: Why?
699.24s: Well, one of these was actually rolled, meaning I had the 25s.
704.48s: I took them down and I rolled those 25s down to the 22.
708.84s: That's why this is at the same strike as this.
710.92s: That's why they were put on at different time.
713.72s: The purpose for this is, again, I'm slowly moving myself away from being buried in the
720.16s: money.
721.16s: I added a little bit of size to do this, going from a five-lot to a six-lot, which represents
726.88s: 600 shares now.
728.48s: The total share equivalent of this is 1100 shares at a strike price of 22.
737.00s: Now these, I do not intend to take a Simon on at this point, so I will continue to adjust
742.64s: these as needed.
743.64s: But right now they're doing fine making money.
746.28s: Now the main point I was explaining earlier is how the returns on these can be pretty
751.44s: good.
752.44s: If you look at the returns for both of these positions, it's about 6% and then 8.5%.
758.08s: Again you will lie, that's 42 and 69% returns.
762.72s: On the call side, which is typically very cheap, that's still giving me a 4.4% return
768.68s: for something over 45 days, and the return annualized is 35%.
774.72s: So what I'm showing you is because of all of the fall in GameStop, not only am I able
780.32s: to take advantage of it from trading the underlying directionally as stuff moves around,
786.00s: but also through these options positions.
788.72s: A thing that's super important to note is that the short call lag you'll notice is at
794.04s: a ratio.
795.04s: So what that means is I have 600 shares.
797.60s: I have at least 200 shares right now that are uncovered, if there was some sort of massive
803.68s: overnight gap that I wasn't able to buy spot price as things were moving, which is obviously
809.36s: exceedingly unlikely.
811.08s: But this is just conservative in case there is some sort of massive parabolic up move, because
817.28s: the other thing that I do is I trade in and out of my shares.
822.52s: And it's for the reason that I explained earlier, if a trader instead just bought on the
827.44s: first and did nothing, or I guess the second of January, and did nothing, you're down,
833.84s: like pretty good.
835.08s: Where is if you bought here and you dollar cost averaged in as it was going down, then
840.44s: as it rallied up and had this really awesome peak above 34, and then you exited as it
846.72s: was coming down, you realize again on your shares there.
851.00s: And then when it starts to stabilize, maybe you nibble get a little bit more than it drops
855.00s: and then you dollar cost averaged more, and then so on and so forth.
859.16s: The point that I'm making is that if you're not static, you can obviously amplify your
863.36s: returns.
864.36s: What's the downside?
865.36s: Well, you're going to generate taxes and stuff like that that you have to pay attention
868.16s: to because capital gains tax can be annoying, but you only pay it on money that you make.
873.40s: So the way that I'm trading game stop right now is the same as I've been the entire
877.84s: year.
878.84s: I literally run the coverage triangle, and that's my base position.
882.24s: Now with respect to the more cool stuff, which is looking for unusual options activity
887.56s: and things like that, I could do a separate video on that if you're interested, but the main
892.28s: version of that is that there just hasn't been that much going on.
895.84s: I actually was doing pretty regular updates on game stop and I slowed down on those just
900.72s: because things got quiet, but also if that's something that you guys are interested in,
904.28s: I'm more than happy to find some sort of cadence and produce those again.
909.88s: But otherwise every single Saturday, I do a mean stock stream, which again, I don't
915.32s: use that term drug totally.
916.88s: It literally just means popular stocks and social media and game stop always is one of the
922.56s: things that we take a look at.
924.16s: So that's the current spot that I typically talk about this stuff.
927.12s: As always though, if you have any questions whatsoever on what I'm doing on the position,
931.00s: how I'm managing it, anything like that, please ask because that's the whole point of sharing
935.20s: this to try and provide information.
937.96s: Be an outlier.
938.96s: I'll see you later.
