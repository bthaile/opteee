0.00s: You ask, I answer back with another question from the homie Zach.
4.32s: And he says, when choosing a far out of the money strike makes sense, it's a great question.
9.08s: The way to think about far out of the money strikes is that they typically are cheap.
14.08s: So if we think of an option's chain, let's call this at the money.
17.68s: This is in the money.
19.48s: This is specifically for the call side by the way.
21.64s: And then this is out of the money.
23.92s: Well, these out of the money calls have a couple really interesting traits, depending on
28.00s: the expiration.
29.36s: But one of the things we know is relative.
31.28s: They're going to be cheap.
32.80s: We also know that if they're nearer term in time, these will still gain gamma quickly.
40.20s: They might not have gamma in the beginning fast, but they'll gain gamma quickly.
45.28s: So the cliff notes version of this is typically when trying to choose some sort of
49.80s: far out of the money strike is if you're expecting a really big move.
52.88s: And you want to buy a bunch of units because these are cheap.
56.36s: So let's say that this option is typically a dollar for the at the money.
59.36s: And these are typically 10 cents.
60.80s: Well, you can get 10 of these for every one of these.
62.72s: You could buy more units here.
64.92s: The last thing to pay attention to is that these also have less extrinsic value.
70.76s: So for extrinsic value, these are lower.
73.12s: These are higher.
74.20s: And then these are lower.
75.48s: So that also means that your theta decay is lower.
78.80s: What's the downside here?
79.88s: You need a bigger move in order to turn on the gamma to start making money.
83.96s: Because for each dollar move, your delta isn't giving you that much because they're super far out of the money.
89.16s: So you need a big move.
91.32s: Great question back.
94.44s: Any other's let me know.
95.44s: Be an outlier.
96.44s: See you later.
