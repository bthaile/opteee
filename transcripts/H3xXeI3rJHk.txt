0.00s: What's up everyone?
2.00s: Looking out at the week ahead, providing a quick update on what's
6.32s: I expect this week from the markets and then also setting the table for what is an
12.36s: expiration cycle for GameStop.
15.04s: So I want to take a little bit of a look at the options there so that we can see what
19.32s: looks like might be happening.
21.48s: And then I've had a lot of people ask me to take a look at other tickers.
24.56s: So I have no problem looking at pretty much anything that you guys want me to send them
29.44s: in.
30.44s: But if the kind of ask is this looks weird, this looks weird, this looks weird.
36.88s: Like I need some sort of filtering mechanism, right?
39.16s: So all I'm saying is it, I'm not going to look at every single stock that people send
43.40s: in saying that they're looking weird.
44.76s: I don't want people to think that I'm ignoring you.
47.00s: I typically will try to at least respond, but not everything is weird.
52.00s: Is what it boils down to.
53.40s: So send them in whatever you want me to look at.
56.72s: And I'm happy to screen it.
59.08s: But it doesn't mean that I'm going to do like a dedicated video on it, but maybe on
62.76s: some of these more broad style videos, I can integrate looking at some other tickers
67.16s: as well.
68.16s: I'm happy to do that.
69.20s: So first thing I want to talk about though is this right here.
73.60s: And a lot of people were asking my opinion of this tweet, not so much his support of
79.88s: Trump or his support of anybody, but more so the impact that this could have on GameStop.
87.04s: And I actually think it's a really interesting lens to look at this through.
89.52s: That's one of my favorite things about finance is it tends to shed this just polarizing
96.68s: landscape that we're in where it's super far left, super far right.
101.16s: And like most of us are human beings.
105.20s: Most of us enjoy loving family and friends.
109.40s: We enjoy things that make us happy, but we somehow find a way to really villainize one
115.68s: another in this landscape, which is pretty intense.
118.32s: So the cool part about finances, we look at it as is the questions that I got related
123.92s: to this.
124.92s: How does this impact a stock, which is an interesting perspective?
127.76s: And the answer that I gave to that is pretty succinct.
132.32s: It's whether or not there's a knee jerk reaction to something like this.
138.12s: I do not expect that kind of post from him to do anything long term to the stock because
145.96s: the performance of the stock is going to be predicated on the performance of the company.
152.08s: That's pretty much it.
153.44s: So there might be some people who are like really, really upset about it or really, really
158.08s: stoked about it.
159.08s: It's less so about either of those things.
161.64s: The way I look at it as far as I know, a lot of the apes have been through hell over
166.36s: the past three years.
168.00s: So this is the thing that shakes them out after going through the rest of the price action
173.16s: for the last three years.
174.48s: I will be shocked.
176.24s: And the other thing it looks like in general, most people are being pretty respectful of
180.08s: one another.
181.08s: I noticed that in the comments here, right?
183.40s: Exactly ape, no fight, ape, ape.
185.08s: Together like I love that, right?
186.44s: We're focusing on the unification component.
188.56s: This is this dude's opinion.
189.84s: Everybody can have an opinion and that's okay.
191.72s: You don't have to like it or you can like it either or is okay in my worldview, at least.
197.60s: The important part here is deciphering the potential impact to the underlying itself.
203.84s: And in that case, like I said, could there be some sort of short term move?
208.16s: Could be.
209.16s: There's a lot of things that watch the stock and there could be some sort of knee jerk
213.12s: reaction.
214.12s: But I don't think in any way that kind of statement or that kind of post would lead any sort
220.92s: of meaningful change in the perspective of the company, which is they're sitting on piles
227.00s: of cash.
228.40s: They are coming up on being profitable real, real soon.
232.60s: So yeah, you can make with it whatever you want.
236.52s: The main thing I would say is don't let stuff like this divide anybody, right?
241.32s: I think it's good to share ideas, share perspectives.
243.64s: That's okay.
244.64s: Being respectful is super important.
246.56s: It's healthy, dissent is normal.
249.00s: But this is I think just kind of nothing to be inflamed about either way.
254.32s: I would say, especially from the game stop perspective, focus on the performance of the
258.20s: company, which so far is moving leaps and bounds in the correct direction from a company
263.52s: that was essentially being seller boxed down into the dirt.
268.44s: This guy came in, started turning things around and through a series of pretty smart, I
274.00s: would say strategic moves, he's repositioning the company.
277.88s: So that to me is a much more telling story than people's perception of this tweet.
283.60s: Okay, moving over to broad market news.
289.24s: I want to show you guys what's coming up this week just so that you're aware of what's
293.32s: coming down the pike like I said, I think it's really good to look at game stop and I'm
297.48s: going to.
299.24s: But I also want you guys to see other things and to just understand a little bit of the
307.08s: broader perspective, even if you have no interest in it, that's completely okay.
310.60s: I think just being aware of it is useful.
312.64s: So we'll run through this really fast.
314.92s: This is a much more quiet week as compared to last week.
318.16s: Last week we had a lot of really big inflation indicators come out, CPI, PPI or PCE.
323.96s: We also had Powell speaking.
327.80s: Those kinds of things are generally big deal.
330.44s: Now this coming week, we do have some more economic data coming out.
335.56s: So Powell is speaking on the 15th tomorrow.
338.96s: We have retail sales on the 16th, which is kind of a big deal.
342.88s: There's a handful of other Fed speakers, you know, whatever they can talk to their
347.48s: hearts can send, but it's really Powell that we care quite a lot about.
351.44s: The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey is coming out.
354.60s: This is just all of these are being interpreted in the perspective of how healthy is the economy,
360.20s: how is inflation impacting things?
363.96s: When does this potentially lead to a Fed pivot, which as of the latest data, it looks like
370.16s: the Fed pivot is early as September now, which was kicked out a long time ago.
375.92s: It used to be as early as March of this year.
378.56s: Then I got moved out towards the end of the year.
380.16s: Now it's sliding back in.
382.08s: So just something to be aware of because if we take a look at kind of the broader market here,
388.48s: you'll see the way that the market thinks about some of these different events.
393.52s: It's kind of not the market doesn't care that much.
396.40s: We don't see any sort of significant expansion involved.
399.44s: So do we see ever so slightly elevated?
401.92s: 11.5, 12 percent.
404.16s: And the next expiration is like 10 to 11.
406.96s: It's just not being ingested as any sort of high impact week.
412.96s: Okay, game stop.
414.72s: First things first, we already talked about this.
416.96s: That's a lot of charts.
417.92s: Let's go to this one.
419.36s: And here, what I'm seeing is this floor continuing to kind of be baked in and it's slowly trending up.
428.32s: That's interesting to keep an eye on.
430.08s: And this also does correspond with some of the cycle thesis that I've seen thrown around.
436.56s: And I also think that this aligns fairly neatly with Newton's expectations coming into August.
442.56s: So there's some interesting activity there.
445.52s: When I look at the overall picture of volume, volume is contracted a lot.
451.12s: We saw a little bit of a spike here on the 10th came back down.
454.88s: And it's been very, very quiet.
456.56s: But notice the trend.
458.56s: It was trending down in terms of average volume then expanded.
462.72s: And then it's been slowly expanding out from the 11th.
465.92s: So that's also fairly interesting to see.
470.48s: Looking over at the options, change themselves.
472.32s: What do we notice?
472.88s: The first thing.
474.16s: The front expiration is a standard op-X, which is really important.
479.76s: This is going to be way more impactful and busy than the weeklies,
483.44s: typically speaking because you'll find liquidity in here.
486.40s: We notice that the vol is elevated 164 versus 136, 126, 118, 114.
494.40s: So there definitely is a little bit of an expectation of movement coming up.
499.12s: This has been slowly expanding, which we've been following for a little while now.
503.28s: And the important part here is if we take a look at
508.56s: where we have most of the OI as it sits now,
512.88s: you'll see there's 762,000 contracts against 456,000 puts when I said contracts before.
518.72s: Obviously, it was referring to calls.
520.72s: And if we look at the 19 July, 332,000, essentially 333,
527.60s: of that is in this upcoming expiration.
530.80s: 16og only has 142k calls.
534.72s: So most of the activity, again, continues to be in these very near-term
539.60s: explorations. This is really playing these front moves.
544.56s: So as I look at the 19 July expiration specifically,
547.36s: because this is the one that's coming up, this position is interesting to me.
551.04s: What we're seeing in the 30s.
552.96s: And it's because there's 60,000 OI, and there was 30,500 volume contracts traded.
560.56s: On Friday.
562.08s: You have to assume a good number of those are going to be net opening contracts.
566.24s: So there's a bit of a position being built there.
569.76s: And what I wanted to do is take a look at what kind of position building is going on
574.80s: in this upcoming expiration cycle.
577.92s: And the 30s, they got hit pretty hard with this almost looks like
584.08s: probably, let me see, I'm guessing about 5,000.
586.96s: Yeah, 4810 contracts.
589.52s: And my guess is probably 5,000.
591.36s: I don't, my guess is somebody didn't stop right at 4810 or 240k.
596.96s: My guess is there's probably even a couple more contracts that go into this.
600.24s: You could just see that these all rolled through essentially at the same time.
604.80s: So they're able to get a pretty big fill.
607.52s: But anyways, that's what I'm expecting.
611.28s: That's a quarter million dollar position that went on the ninth
616.32s: for the 30 calls expiring this coming Friday.
622.16s: That's an interesting trade to me.
624.08s: This is not anywhere near roaring kitty size.
627.28s: I want to be very, very clear.
628.48s: Everybody kind of starts jumping down that path.
630.88s: And I get why it's fun to speculate that.
634.56s: This doesn't look like his size.
636.40s: But this also is not a small trade.
639.20s: That is again, it's you can kind of get kind of numb in this space
644.24s: after you watch roaring kitty slinging hundreds of millions of dollars at stuff.
649.60s: But a quarter million dollar position in options that expire in 10 days from when you place them
656.16s: is not insignificant.
658.80s: So one of the things I am watching like a hawk this upcoming week is the options activity.
667.76s: I want to know if this is just a tester position that's being built out
673.28s: and using the rest of this week to start scaling into it.
678.16s: That would be interesting.
679.92s: The other thing that I'm very interested in is based on Newton's kind of I guess timeline.
687.12s: I should say his timeline analysis of GameStop.
690.08s: He's very interested in August.
692.24s: So when I see somebody like roaring kitty's previous transactions,
697.60s: there were about a month out ish.
699.92s: And when he entered versus when there was a move.
703.36s: So if Newton is expecting a move in August, my guess is we would start to see if
710.08s: what roaring kitty is looking at is anything similar to what he and I have been discussing for a
715.04s: while now on the live streams, which there's another one coming up this coming Saturday at 5 pm
720.48s: Pacific time. We're going to kind of keep a cadence on these at least for the near term because
725.36s: we're both really enjoying looking at this. We spend over two hours on this last Saturday
731.04s: on the live stream and then literally he and I hung out for another hour talking about this
734.32s: stuff because we're both so interested in it. Going back to this though, if there's a chance
741.60s: that RK is looking at some or even peripheral things tied to what we're looking at,
747.76s: we should start seeing some activity. So I'm looking for it and we will see if it comes out.
754.64s: There's also a chance that it's not at the same scale before. It's not like he has to put on a
758.16s: $68 million options position every time he touches options, right? So it's not being overly rigid
764.88s: in the analysis in that sense. This starts to look interesting. $234,000. But this seems a little
772.64s: short term. We will see. I am looking specifically for the building out of positions. Right now,
778.56s: it looks like there's a little bit of a start, but not fully rounded out. So we have to keep an
784.56s: eyeball on it. The last thing I want to highlight for you guys is down here at the bottom.
789.44s: And I want to show you the wall smile and how this looks kind of for the near term.
796.40s: And here's what I am seeing. I want to use specifically kind of these near term
801.60s: operations. What I'm seeing is the standard standard behavior where in these op-x cycles, the 125
809.60s: super far out of the money are creeping up in vol. The near term, I'm still seeing call vol lower
817.84s: than put vol, which when we were seeing that really aggressive upward price movement, it was
822.64s: inverted, which is very telling. Typically, you'll see it like this. If I look out here into the 16
830.96s: aug, notice this. If I hover at the top of where this put vol is, if you go all the way to the right,
837.12s: just over my shoulder on this side, notice how that line is actually above my cursor. If I move this,
842.96s: you'll see it's just above my cursor. So right now, the call side out in 16 aug is slightly elevated
851.12s: compared to the out of the money puts. So again, from a vol trader's perspective, this has been
856.56s: habitual where these far out of the money puts have been gaining and vol pretty heavily.
862.16s: The tradable event. But in terms of a price projection standpoint, using options to have an
867.92s: assessment of where we think where we think things might be going based on how market is pricing
872.16s: stuff. Right now, it is still favoring the downside in terms of vol for this coming cycle. So we
880.16s: will also keep an eye on this. As always, any questions, anything you want me to take a look at
884.00s: or anything to add, please throw it out there. I'm learning as much as you guys are. And I love gaining
889.92s: more situational awareness about this whole thing. So have an awesome week, be an outlier. I'll see
895.36s: you guys later.
