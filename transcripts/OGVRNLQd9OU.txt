294.00s: what's up, outliers, happy Wednesday. I am in the process of reconfiguring
299.04s: the live streams yet again you know it goes kind of just move stuff around
303.04s: tinker with different ideas and the game plan for the Wednesday stream is to
308.48s: revert back to something that we were slightly doing earlier but kind of ran out of time
315.60s: in the prior stream cadence where what I want to do is use the Wednesday stream as an
323.84s: opportunity to recap the markets super fast instead of spending a lot of time
329.04s: deeping digging into just analyzing markets we do enough of that in the other
334.32s: streams that I don't think it's huge value add in this context and what I would
339.84s: like to do is get back to the prior structure I had developed that
346.24s: keeps the ball rolling with respect to building skills so if you will recall some time ago hot
355.12s: minute ago at this point I used to do on Wednesday like a skill development and then on Thursday
363.76s: for the pro members is when we would kind of double click into that skill development stream
369.12s: and I want to get back to that and the main reason is because there's an opportunity there
375.04s: for us to work on practical skills during the live streams together which I always
382.08s: imagine is valuable the way that I typically think about this stuff is in the context of like
388.80s: do I wish I had this I have to adjust the screen that's why I'm lean forward like this
395.36s: but that's that's typically how I think about it it's like is this something that I wish I had
400.40s: around when I was learning to trade and that's more or less what I try to offer you
408.48s: so that is my vision and as always if you have input or if you have any thoughts on that I'd love
416.24s: to hear it but looks like we got dark mark and Lauren great to see both of you and let's talk
422.72s: really quick then about the markets and then what I want to do is actually grab the skill development
430.08s: book that I have this is something that we've built for some time and I've been kind of building it
435.84s: out as a broader library and I want to show you what what I'm thinking and I want to spend some time
442.08s: during the stream today doing two things I want to walk through a recent video that I did the
447.92s: skill development isn't necessarily going to be super structured because I want to be able to
453.04s: hit a couple things more quickly a big thing that we do on the Thursday stream is like we pick
458.56s: something and we go deep where is I think in this kind of context for a more casual
466.16s: audience in general it probably makes more sense to touch on a handful of skills to introduce
472.08s: people to things let me show you what the origin of all this was this isn't something that I was
477.36s: like just randomly going and thinking how I was going to piece this all together let me show you
484.96s: exactly exactly what went down so first things for this isn't went down I just need this window
491.28s: this is what went down so this is a post that I made hey what's up James and Robert good to see
498.00s: you as well this is a post I made yesterday on Reddit every once in a while as you guys know I
505.04s: like to go on Reddit because I believe it's valuable like I really believe it's valuable to go back
512.24s: and give back to the community and there was looking back at my own trade and career there was a
518.32s: ton that I learned from different free discussion forms however I do typically think that there's a
527.84s: I don't want to like discounted too much but I do think that there's a general lack of good
533.04s: information and I think it's hard to also just come across people that genuinely give a certain
541.76s: amount of care in terms of you know like what what we're doing I'm just setting up windows that's
547.44s: why you see all these grid lines in terms of like what we're talking about how we're talking about it
552.56s: okay this goes back to the skill dev promise I was in the process of talking about this there's
559.04s: really nothing here this the concept behind this is stuff that you all are full well aware of already
565.28s: this simply is talking about the idea that the important stuff that you do as a trader really
571.04s: doesn't change with the count size this might not even make sense to you you might be saying why
575.60s: would that even be a thing well it's because there's a lot of traders I see it all the time
580.32s: where they genuinely believe that trading is going to become easy once they have more money
588.96s: like that is a genuine belief and as you could tell there's a lot of issues with that belief
595.68s: it's more or less just going to set them up for what I typically would consider a pretty
602.48s: significant amount of failure realistically it's just not how markets work so that all aside
610.08s: I made this post and the interesting thing to me was actually in the conversation I was having
617.44s: somebody and somebody had responded here
626.88s: yeah perfect this has been a really good dialogue now I spend way too much time doing this stuff
633.04s: going through these and the main reason why I do that is literally just because like I actually care
640.24s: and if somebody doesn't care and take the time to do these back and forths
646.48s: that's real difficult to learn right you kind of just get off on your way of thinking and
654.56s: there's no intervention and there's a specific thing that I was thinking about when I was speaking
660.08s: with this person was I remember when I was a few years into my trading career and I was genuinely
670.32s: convinced of certain things one of them was I could not wrap my mind around the concept that rolling
681.36s: is simply closing a trade and opening a new one I just struggled with that it didn't make sense to me
689.36s: I thought rolling was this really cool thing that was you know big game changer and all this kind
695.60s: of stuff and as everybody knows it's simply not the case it's just objectively not the case
704.16s: yet that's what I thought and it took me a long time a long time of like noodling on the thoughts
712.40s: hearing the thoughts in different ways discussing it with different people because the tricky part
717.92s: with rolling is most people agree with that so it's actually really difficult to find counter
723.36s: arguments and I forgot how I think it was in a book that I came across somebody referred to it
730.56s: literally is just like closing a trade and opening a trade and I was just like what that's not
734.16s: what this is so anyways this person reminded me of that because we're going back and forth on
740.88s: on this year right so the concept of the post the amount of money you have doesn't matter that much
746.88s: in the context of being able to do the important things right so the idea here and you can see in
753.84s: the TLDR having a large account isn't like some sort of binary switch no edge to edge it's just
759.60s: not how it works but there's again a lot of people that relegate it to oh once I have more money
765.20s: this will be easier there are elements that become easier with a large account no debate completely
770.80s: agree things like portfolio margin pdt yada yada yada there's tons of things and you guys saw when
776.64s: I did the small stack segment how annoying that was for me because trading a $5,000 account
784.40s: really is annoying like it is so there's no debate and I would never sit here and pretend like oh
791.28s: you know that that's that's not the case that would be absolutely ridiculous but that aside
798.00s: there is absolutely nothing magic once you have a large account that somehow will just make you
805.52s: profitable that's the problem so anyways this person says to be fair if you cannot get a level
812.08s: high enough to at least use cash secured puts then it can actually be difficult and you can see
818.88s: my response is this it's always difficult there is no like it's not once you get to CSPs now it's easy
829.04s: it's it's it's not it's never going to be I made a post on here let me find it real quick I made a
836.96s: post on x that looks at this topic let me find it here because I was just doing some general research
853.44s: and I came across this topic which also by the way before I show you that one I want to show you
858.56s: this other one here
866.88s: this I thought was fantastic and it was like so perfect based on you know what I was just kind of
872.56s: noodling on before coming on the stream this so the more we learn the more we realize how little
879.36s: we know it was so funny like I didn't go looking for this this literally just popped up in my feet
885.44s: and it was as I was having this conversation thinking about all this other stuff that I was
889.68s: telling you about so then the conversation goes on to this it says part of the edge is being
895.44s: able to sell options and the strategies associated with them aha the first inaccuracy there is not
903.28s: an inherent odd edge to selling options it's one of the most commonly mistaken things I see
911.68s: when we talk about trading there are so many traders that are genuinely convinced that selling
918.24s: options isn't edge and it is not in edge and you'll see a little bit more but again
925.68s: back to why I want to do skills dev because taking time to talk about these concepts on a stream
932.64s: in passing more quickly I think yields really high returns at the end of a stream because at the
939.84s: end of this you can literally walk away and like definitively point to hopefully a handful of things
946.72s: concepts that either become more clear new concepts that can send you to go do research a little
953.20s: bit more deeply you can walk away with like practical things so that's what I want to that's why I
960.64s: want to do the skills dev but anyways let's just continue with this one because this is again an
964.88s: interesting conversation it's already been statistically proven that selling is more lucrative
971.28s: than buying as soon as I see this the first thing I think in the back of my mind is I'm assuming
976.96s: they've watched tasty trade because tasty trade actually doesn't say this because they know better
984.00s: but it's how people typically think about what tasty trade says and internalizes it
991.44s: because again you guys know I do podcasts I talk to Tom pretty regularly and the the hilarity here
998.16s: is that they they also would say the same thing but most people they kind of they see information
1005.92s: and then they take it the way that they want to take it not the way that it objectively is okay so
1012.00s: we talk about this in my retort but like this isn't this isn't true so the first premise that
1018.80s: they're saying to me that being able to sell or having access to selling cash liquor puts
1025.04s: leads to edge again I couldn't care less if I change their mind that's not why I do this I do this
1034.32s: because I think that it is really really important that once you actually learn and understand
1042.88s: something to share it I really believe that and it's the only reason why I've landed where I am
1049.44s: with respect to my trading acumen it's not like I'm some savant that just magically knew
1055.52s: at a trade options is not how it went for me I've had so many people help me in so many ways
1062.48s: that if they had not at various points I assuredly would have had a completely different path in life
1069.36s: assuredly so I view this as a general service to the community as corny and as wild as that sounds
1079.44s: that's why I spend the time doing this because this person represents not just this person this
1085.44s: person represents a train of thought that other people have because I've seen this a ton of times
1090.40s: and my hope is that not for this person but there could be another person or this person
1096.80s: that follows this logical conversation because there also a great conversationalist there
1101.84s: there's no nothing mean in this conversation as soon as people get annoying I won't talk to them
1106.56s: anymore but like this was a completely solid discourse right the process of they think this is
1115.12s: the reality and again it's not until somebody shows another way that they will realize that this
1121.84s: isn't the reality but somebody needs to show or at least plant the seeds of something to research
1126.80s: further so anyways incorrect this says you're basically foring forcing them in predicting price
1134.40s: direction with calls and puts if they have a low enough level you force them into covered calls
1138.64s: which is that stuff's all wrong it doesn't even matter but the the predicting price direction this
1143.44s: is another really common premise of people who think selling is an edge they will say things like
1149.04s: oh well I don't have to predict direction guess what gang if you sell you still are predicting
1159.28s: direction you just have a pad that's all right so if we think about a cash secured put
1166.56s: fantastic example and if we look at the payoff diagram for a cash secured put what does the
1174.32s: payoff diagram look like if there if it looked like this then this would be correct
1185.52s: but this isn't what it looks like you all know this the payoff diagram for cash your put is this
1191.60s: what does this mean it means you still have to be directionally correct the only difference is that
1200.88s: you have a small buffer emphasis on small several percent typically somewhere between five if it's
1208.24s: something with super high IV and 1 percent something like that I guess I should have reversed those
1212.88s: numbers but you know so so you have a small buffer this doesn't mean that you don't get to be you
1219.12s: still have to be directionally correct you just have a buffer but again I don't bother addressing
1224.56s: that part in this post because it's too much way too much I hate you guys all know this I literally
1229.92s: hate the written format because it's super time consuming takes forever right like even in the
1236.16s: few minutes that we've had this stream going so far talking on this specific topic we've been
1240.56s: able to talk about a ton of different things that would have taken me literally a very long time
1244.96s: to write out okay so then I essentially say selling absolutely is not more lucrative than buying
1253.68s: to patently false and then I think this just goes back into tying it to the original post some people
1261.44s: like right now you could tell their argument is now about is selling lucrative or is cash to
1266.88s: keep what's lucrative but like that's not what the original post is about the original post is that
1271.28s: the major muscle movements that you need to do as a trader literally can start when you have zero
1276.72s: fucking dollars you could do it with zero dollars so just making sure that we're bringing it back
1282.56s: to that point again this isn't for them this is for somebody else that's fallen the dialogue
1287.60s: okay so then they respond with strategies that involve selling are absolutely more lucrative than
1292.88s: strategies that involve only buying so here's the problem when people argue things is they
1298.96s: add these different qualifiers that niche this argument down right it's already moving and now the
1305.52s: target is that involve only buying big difference right at no point what I make a counter argument
1312.96s: to this I wouldn't make either side of this because this again is a completely moot point and you'll
1318.24s: see why again I'm using statistics and large sample sizes here this is the problem they're not
1327.68s: what they're doing is repeating something that they've heard from somewhere without doing any
1336.56s: other research and they're just trying to regurgitate it while bastardizing it I'm pointing
1344.64s: this out because this person truly believes this they think that the statistics are on their side
1351.68s: and again fun fact for those that don't know my undergrad and grad were both wrapped around stats
1358.96s: so it's like it's literally what I do at least from an education perspective now what I do is just
1364.96s: look at colors on a chart and lose my money all day it's pretty fun so then they talk about
1371.36s: like different strategies and stuff and here this I didn't accuse or I didn't say like oh you're
1376.56s: just regurting tady tasty trade I was giving them benefit of the doubt but here it is
1381.92s: I agree that it's usually best combined edge technical fundamental analysis which is funny because
1386.40s: tasty trade doesn't care about technical analysis but as tasty trade have proven right so that's
1392.88s: what they're citing and the problem is I give them a lot of context here on the way tasty trade
1400.80s: does studies I like tasty trade stuff but their studies have a litany of shortfalls like everybody's
1407.68s: studies there are no perfect studies out there and more over than all of this shout out to them
1413.44s: for putting the studies out there right the fact that we can have a conversation about this is huge
1419.76s: so I have nothing but respect for what they do but it still requires the same scientific rigor
1426.88s: of analysis as anything else and what you'll notice most frequently in their studies is they
1432.08s: typically compare what we would refer to as a dumb strategy and it doesn't mean that the person
1436.80s: using it is dumb it just means that we're essentially saying this is what we're going to do over
1442.00s: and over again into perpetuity or until the end of the study right and I give an example
1447.76s: so a lot of times they'll do stuff like oh if we buy versus sell a 16 delta strangle in spy every
1457.44s: 30 days and go to conclusion that kind of stuff so it gives you a premise to begin but
1464.48s: their takeaway is still wrong so here the last thing I say was that I talk with Tom and that he
1475.84s: will admit himself that selling has no structural edge meaning it's not better than buying and
1483.04s: simply saying that Tom would also say that he says well that's contrary to everything I've ever
1487.76s: heard him say so again they're convinced of this and you'll see in a minute this is again just
1493.76s: but that's okay so I don't know where you're getting your information from this is them going
1499.04s: through the doubting process because they're having somebody directly discuss these points
1505.20s: and it's disrupting their view their understanding of the world and they're being confronted with new
1513.20s: information that makes them question the background of what they're doing and that's not easy
1519.28s: that's very difficult and the cool part is once you trade for a while it actually becomes super
1524.64s: easy because you learn to not really care about right or wrong and you really do just become
1532.08s: interested in what's accurate and what's objectively true and for those that have been in the
1537.92s: community for a while you will have heard me say things like strong convictions loosely held
1543.92s: and it's a really important premise and it's simple strong convictions meaning it's something
1549.28s: that's well researched loosely held meaning as soon as there's new information you can
1556.56s: immediately abandon that strong conviction that's it strong conviction loosely held so
1566.16s: then they say I don't understand there are very few options strategies you could do with
1572.80s: calls and puts a lot I don't know what that means you're limited the fact you cannot dispute you
1576.48s: have to rely on creating edge through technical fundamentals some other analysis in order to
1579.92s: profit from calls and puts just as you would trading equities so again this is just confusion it's
1586.00s: not really worth diving into but that this goes into a common misconception that there is some sort
1595.76s: of option structure that equals edge and there isn't so it doesn't matter if it's a CSP it doesn't
1604.16s: matter if it short puts doesn't matter if it's long calls none of them inherently will yield edge
1610.32s: it's the strategy you build around them that ultimately does and then here
1618.24s: saw this one coming from a mile away because it's super common the idea that if you sell
1625.04s: the advantage is being able to benefit from time instead of it working against you and again
1631.76s: this is a just general misunderstanding of some of the most important trade-offs that exist with
1640.24s: options the thing you have to remember is everything literally everything everything has a trade-off
1650.96s: there is there is no relaunch out here so this concept of oh
1663.76s: selling being able to benefit from time and instead of working it against you that's absolutely
1669.28s: correct that's 100% true if you sell time helps you does not hurt you but what does that mean
1677.28s: you guys tell me what does that mean if selling allows you to benefit from the passage of time
1687.36s: what does that mean any brave guesses hey yo what up why not
1696.32s: Joe says they did a K yeah that's correct that's what it is but tie it back to what we're talking
1703.12s: about if if selling allows you to benefit from theta decay Reese is getting closer you need it to
1712.64s: not move too much that's partially correct not what I'm going for yet
1721.04s: but zooming up a level any other guesses
1726.00s: bam H has it H has it there's a trade-off so one of those trade-offs is defined profit so you get
1742.56s: theta here's your get you get theta here's your give
1751.84s: profit potential
1757.84s: your get is a little wiggle room meaning it can go against you a little bit and you can still win
1765.44s: your give is gamma and convexity this is your cost now I'm not saying that these are directly
1778.08s: linear it's not so much the case but for every single component that you get you are giving
1787.28s: and it's for both sides of the equation whether you buy or whether you sell there are things
1795.12s: that you get that are inherent strengths it's just like if you play a video game if you play
1800.56s: a video game and you're playing one of these like fighter video games and they all have like their stats
1809.36s: or maybe a sports video game right like different things have their stats different offense defense
1817.04s: and sometimes somebody will have really good offense but not a great defense and so on and so
1821.28s: forth maybe somebody's really good at like close quarters battle but they're really bad at
1825.84s: distance or they can't even touch you at a distance so all that kind of it's it's the same thing
1829.68s: here the same exact thing here he says is there such thing as too much theta that's a great question
1838.96s: now I would say not not as like a standard rule meaning if you go over so like if theta
1855.44s: exceeds like 500 units if you exceed 500 units of theta that's now too much that's not how it
1863.36s: works at all I would say that you can have too much theta relative to a portfolio size
1874.64s: more as a representation of position in position size because if we need theta
1884.56s: let's say if theta goes up meaning you're collecting more theta it means something has gone up
1893.76s: whether it's the number of trades size of trades this amounts to risk risk has gone up
1907.68s: so this is relative to a portfolio size however so I would say that there is too high of a theta
1916.72s: and it's more not because it's too high of a theta but it's because as your theta increases it means
1923.84s: you're adding risk in some way again you're either adding total number of trades size of trade
1929.60s: so on and so forth one of those will be moving that's a great question so that's how I would answer
1938.00s: it though inherently there's not like some sort of threshold that's defined but there definitely is
1946.08s: an implication relative to sizing okay so let's continue um so this just explains a little bit
1956.72s: of the history of Tom and why they prefer selling and a big part of it is he started on the floor
1963.44s: making markets and as you do that you're just primed to take the other side of the trade and more
1968.56s: often than not at the time it was selling because most people would be buying so that's that's the
1973.92s: inherent tilt that begins and that's part of the the contrarian mindset that he generally exhibits
1982.24s: which is cool
1986.48s: ain't not wrong with it um this talks about the different strategy compositions we already talked
1992.64s: about this now this addresses what we were talking about with respect to time we already know this
1999.76s: a lot of the times by the way when you have these conversations with people again not just with
2004.96s: this person I view it as having a conversation with this perspective that likely other people have
2011.44s: is give them resources because a lot of times people are just so used to people arguing I want to be
2017.28s: right I want to be right and they're not used to people arguing from the pursuit of objective truth
2024.32s: and I would say this person's actually doing a great job so far because it's a very just generally
2028.96s: logical conversation as respectful so this is rare but one of the important things is give them
2035.20s: other things they can look at because right now for most people they're thinking like oh I'm in a
2040.96s: fight I'm in an argument with this guy I don't want to lose so then it gives an out it's essentially
2045.84s: saying well don't just take my word for it go look at other resources that talk about this concept
2051.84s: and a great one in this exact thing is you and some clear so anyways I give them the cliff notes
2058.32s: version of why selling and buying are you know the relationship that they have and then they
2067.20s: they asked like where I got my like information from I literally just googled like a keyword search
2076.32s: about this and then I didn't I've never used mgur before but I figured out because you can't
2083.20s: add like a screenshot this is literally from from Tom since the market is efficient we cannot
2089.52s: claim that one side is better than the other longer short premium literally the dude is saying it
2095.52s: himself and it's not like some sort of like big gotcha it's just a fucking fact so anyways I gave them
2103.20s: a direct source to help them wrap their mind around it and then now we're talking about
2110.32s: simply stating that absent any other edge or strategy right like this is different now but
2116.00s: that's okay strategies that contain cell orders collectively have higher pop than those with
2122.48s: bio orders so you can see how the argument has evolved right and this is super common because when
2127.44s: people are getting pressed and as they're turning left there's something there they try to turn
2133.12s: right right they're trying to navigate the argument because as you could tell like this
2138.80s: this hasn't been mentioned at all yet and word eight back and forth into this which is again okay
2145.28s: but they're saying that cell orders have collectively higher probability profit it's completely true
2151.20s: now I get an opportunity to teach them about another really annoying fact of trading
2156.48s: high probability of profit doesn't equal edge we now have to talk about a super super important
2163.84s: discussion about expected return right so here this is saying high probability of profit does not
2173.60s: equal edge and then I give them an example so they say okay so what does pop mean then by your logic
2182.08s: it's a completely meaningless statistic and they're not far off like realistically pop by itself
2189.28s: doesn't matter it doesn't tell you really much anything of use and I give them an example
2195.36s: so I say if I tell a trader they have a 90% chance of winning they might think and most of us would
2201.20s: think wow that's awesome this super high chance of winning I like that but this doesn't reflect
2207.04s: trading this doesn't reflect the markets because we know that there are other pieces to this puzzle
2215.60s: not only do we have the probability of our trade our probability of a win but we know
2227.52s: that we also need to know the win size that's another key part of this equation and we also know
2235.44s: that for every strategy that exists there's a probability of losing with a corresponding
2245.28s: loss size so what did we just do we just wrote the expected return formula
2255.28s: and again a lot of people really like focusing on win rate and probability of profit this one input one
2265.04s: quarter of this more important equation because who doesn't like winning a lot
2275.04s: everybody would like winning a lot everything else being the same we all would rather win a lot of course
2284.88s: remember trading is a game of trade-offs this is a big trade-off if you have a really high
2296.08s: probability of profit it means in general your win size is going to be lower your probability of
2302.88s: losing is lower because these two are connected here and here however your loss size is typically higher
2312.00s: these two also have a relationship these two I think I'm at the bottom these two have a relationship
2322.56s: so what I give them is a scenario and I complete the scenario I say now if we actually put this
2328.24s: in a trading context their 90% probability of winning comes with you win 10 bucks and that 10%
2336.96s: probability of losing has you losing a hundred dollars here's the problem once you add those other
2344.48s: components you now have a negatively expected strategy even though it has an astronomically high
2353.84s: probability of profit and then we offer another example to help elucidate the point which is if
2361.44s: we have a strategy that wins 35% of the time really small win rate but you win a hundred bucks
2370.64s: and if you lose 65% of the time but you lose that 10 bucks you now have a positively expected strategy
2378.64s: so in this one conversation we had an opportunity to discuss a ton of topics we got to discuss some
2393.60s: of the key components of being a trader not being related or that directly tied to the size of
2401.92s: there are tons of things you could do with zero dollars let alone a big or small account
2409.04s: you can start with no money that's the first thing we learned the second thing we learned is a
2415.12s: relationship between buying and selling and there are things that you get and give whether you're
2423.12s: on one side or the other but we learn that one side is not inherently better than the other
2428.16s: we learn that the concept of theta being an edges false we also learn about the concepts of
2435.76s: convexity and gamma so we're on to seven things so far over the course of this one post
2442.16s: we got a chance to learn about high win rate and over emphasis on win rate and how that can be
2449.92s: confusing and we had a chance to learn about expected return and the integration of probability
2456.96s: of profit or win rate into the broader expected return calculation there's like 10 things over the
2463.68s: course of you know hour long wasn't even an hour it's like posting right so you go back and forth
2469.20s: but 10 things we got to talk about over the course of this this one dialogue which to me is
2476.32s: absolutely beautiful I love that I love the ability to have these kind of conversations because
2482.48s: I think they're so important now I do have a genuine question so for anybody in the chat
2490.24s: I think you can yeah perfect it should just say yes or no yeah perfect
2496.08s: was anything in here new to you yes or no and you could throw it in the poll my guess is the
2503.20s: majority for you this hopefully this stuff is not that new but I am actually curious like
2510.00s: if there was stuff that we talked about in here that was new to you
2517.84s: interesting even a slightly higher yes population than I thought for those that said yes
2526.24s: what element was new to you I'm again like I'm genuinely curious because part of what I want to do
2532.40s: here is talk a little bit about this and this is what I have built out for our skills development
2546.80s: sessions I just kind of like passively add to this over time but I would like to add more stuff to
2553.52s: it so depending on what the generally new stuff was to people I would love to include that here
2562.80s: as expected most folks are generally familiar and I'm assuming these are just people that have been
2570.16s: around the community for a while but yeah if there's something that you would like to add to our
2578.88s: skills development segment let me know because I would love to I'd love to include it
2586.16s: okay I'm gonna kill this poll and I have two other things that I want to talk about the very first
2595.52s: one is taking a look at this video which I think is I got a handful I actually got more emails on
2607.68s: this one than anything which is kind of funny and so this was a video that I released for like the
2614.88s: weekly video that goes out on Sundays talking about a recent trade in CCJ and one of the questions was
2627.12s: this one or one of the it's not a question it's a comment and I actually think it's a really
2631.68s: great comment by the way because it highlights a really important point and they're saying it
2638.16s: feel like for every one of these unusual options ideas that hits there are a hundred that don't
2646.16s: do anything what do you guys think what do you make of that as a statement thoughts
2651.52s: what do you guys think because there's a really really important
2668.40s: a really important element to this that's what kind of fun seeing like where different people
2676.56s: think about stuff Lauren says how big is the one that hit versus the hundred that do nothing
2684.08s: that's part of it so you're getting into the expected return calculation and you're getting
2690.16s: closer to the broader idea that I'm thinking of
2698.24s: age says makes me think of survivorship bias there's definitely an element of that without a doubt
2704.16s: but that's not what I'm thinking of think of it this way there's what over 5,000 securities that you
2712.56s: can trade Jordan says I'm not so sure I think scanning for stuff is a skill and you can get very
2720.48s: good at it there you go Jordan's on the right path here a big part of being a trader is learning to
2729.28s: be supremely efficient with your ability to look at the markets and it's because you are working
2736.08s: with constrained attention there's only so many things you can look at he's digging into his bed
2747.60s: so there's no there's that element now the follow on element
2759.44s: is you can learn what filters make sense for what ideas and it's always in my opinion about the breath
2774.08s: of evidence not any one point and we go through this a lot during the the pro streams you can we
2782.64s: scan together all the time and you see exactly what I do a big part of it is starting with a
2789.76s: series of filters that I know narrow the world down to different ideas that I'm interested in
2795.60s: for different reasons it's not the scenario that I go through that result list and then just start
2802.16s: firing off trades right just doesn't make sense I then apply another layer of analysis
2812.08s: and top of that to then arrive at a trade idea eventually so what they're highlighting here is
2820.80s: actually a massively important point and it's that you can't just blindly trade a certain set of
2828.72s: criteria it still requires your eyeballs now again this is me speaking from the context of a
2835.52s: discretionary trader I am a discretionary trader I cannot automate what I do as a trader I know
2844.40s: this I can automate different components of what I do as a trader but I cannot automate what I do
2850.96s: as a trader and it's because of the discretion component it's very difficult to quantify all
2858.64s: elements of a trading decision cycle and that's to me that's not a problem to me that's part of my
2866.08s: edge is that baked in experience that's built on over decades in the market that intuition and that
2875.20s: subconscious processing that cannot exist in an automated system automated systems are black or white
2882.88s: does it fit the things that this is supposed to fit even if it's ranges and then
2888.56s: enter or don't enter that's it whereas from a retail trading lens and discretionary trading lens
2897.12s: there's way more shades of gray and to me that's part of the beauty there's more to it so this trade
2904.88s: was actually a really really simple idea right it was based partially on the concept of a breakout
2913.60s: so you can see the positions that went on and how they went on and I had scaled this one if I'm
2920.96s: not mistaken to the $600,000 model portfolio that we've been using I just think it's good to kind
2927.60s: of keep it in a common language so all I did was take the position and made it relative to the
2936.80s: portfolio that I've been sharing with you guys and you can see I just give some of the the background
2944.96s: on the idea I talk about formulation of a trade blah blah blah blah and then I give you the actual
2951.84s: the actual decision cycles here now when going into this trade there's no part of me that's like
2963.20s: I know what's going to happen I have absolutely no idea you guys have seen me talk about
2970.56s: plenty of losing trades I'm not ashamed like they're part of the game I'm not ashamed
2976.00s: at all she's another data point the thing is the goal of a trader is to just steadily put yourself
2986.32s: in increasingly better positions to capture good opportunities that's ultimately what we're
2995.76s: trying to do here so I thought that that comment was like I felt it I like I felt their energy
3006.00s: in the concept of what they're saying because that is the case and it's a really frustrating
3012.24s: thing to navigate through as a trader the fact that you have to find a way to navigate this stuff
3019.28s: and there's not like a simple wrote thing that you can always do there's nothing like that
3025.76s: that's annoying and that's kind of difficult actually to get to fully get your arms around
3032.40s: but it is the reality that we have as traders which again I think that that's where
3039.12s: a big part of the benefit comes from what we do so if you have any questions on this video or
3048.24s: this trade let me know in the meantime if you have any questions that you want to talk about now
3053.84s: is the perfect time to throw them in I want to hit one of these from the pro members
3061.76s: and the question here is credit spreads I'm bearish on five reporting earnings max move after
3071.52s: earnings is based on historical move was about 15% to the upside let me wrap nope didn't mean to
3083.60s: that let me wrap this so I can see this this would end up with them shorting a 20 delta strike at 130
3097.36s: I'm trying to figure out my long strike for the wings I'm using theoretical numbers but what is
3103.04s: the difference between shorting two credit spreads that are 10 wide one credit spread versus
3113.20s: 20 points wide seems like both are risking a max loss of 1700 which is correct how are these two
3120.08s: positions the same are different I know you're in a fan of credit spreads but what would you
3124.08s: till higher wider wings of the spreads what are the cases for one of the other it's a great question
3128.16s: it's actually a really really perceptive question too so let's talk about credit spreads really fast
3137.04s: and instead of drawing I'll actually pull it up in the platform because I think that might be
3143.52s: better learning tool here so let me close that out and let me move this over
3154.24s: and let's take a look let's take a look at the idea take a look at five
3164.64s: and we want to be short in this scenario coming into earnings
3169.76s: and they're at 125 by 128 so they're getting ran over but not too bad because if the shorts at 130 the
3180.08s: trade would still be safe let's take a look at the different scenarios so let's look at 130 and 140
3193.76s: uh dot call side
3201.44s: 130 and 140 so this would be two
3211.52s: and then let's take a look at 130 to 150 and that would be one
3218.16s: okay so now let's take a look first at this version and let's just talk about it let's just
3229.76s: talk about what we see so the first thing that we would want to analyze here is what is our let me
3241.84s: move this up so that you guys could see the trade details you go so let's do first the 10 dollar
3251.84s: widespread and we already arrived at the max profit effectively being about the same I'm just
3262.80s: going to call it the same it's not this is slightly different max profit on these
3272.00s: this is slightly different so this is 5 30 versus 5 20 so we have the 10 wide
3280.40s: and the 20 wide 2 by 10 so max profit is 5 30 versus 5 20
3290.16s: if we take a look at the max loss 1470 and 1480 right so just the inverse of this
3309.04s: and we both know that the short strike starts at the 5 30
3315.04s: so if we were to reason through the differences here there's a few key elements to keep in mind what are
3326.16s: they brainstorm with me what can you think of here that's different and there's a handful of things
3337.44s: that I think will be most relevant but let me know what you guys think
3345.20s: and he guesses
3354.72s: and in the meantime I got to add the timestamp in this word forget this is 55
3366.88s: oops
3367.68s: no guesses no way you guys have to have guesses
3379.60s: you absolutely know some of the differences here
3381.84s: okay let's start with the simple stuff the first one is super easy this one of them has two
3403.92s: legs or two contracts two lots I should say so four legs one of them has two legs
3418.00s: so we know the first thing is that there's going to be a difference in terms of cost and liquidity
3427.28s: now this doesn't inherently mean that the two lots with four legs two lots it doesn't inherently
3441.44s: mean that this is more or less liquid than this it depends on the options but let's say you're
3448.24s: dealing with illiquid options then this is worse if you're dealing with liquid options this might
3454.72s: not be any worse than this really depends on the options chain but there's a cost component
3461.92s: there's definitely a costowment right two legs versus four legs and you have to do that round trip
3468.24s: entry and exit so that's one thing the next thing we know that the initial probability
3479.68s: will be super similar because it's based on the 530 so if we take a look at what the break even is
3489.04s: for the first strategy that like 135 135 20 and I don't know why I said 530
3500.96s: you must be thinking of like spy or something we won not bad so we easily can calculate the break even
3514.08s: and the initial break even as you know is just your short strike so in this case 130 and we get our
3523.52s: credit added on top because it's a short call and again our credits respectively are about
3531.28s: the same 530 oh this was profit that's why
3539.28s: so in one scenario for this one your break even let me read it
3543.52s: of your break even is just your 135 30 and then in the second scenario it's 135 20 so about the same
3563.76s: so now if we think about where max loss occurs this is where one of the first main differences will
3576.48s: come if you take a look your max loss of 1480 in this trade comes in at 150 if we take a look at
3588.32s: your max loss on this trade of two of the 10 points wide where does your max loss come in
3600.24s: at your short strike so your max loss here comes in at 140 so that is one of the primary differences
3610.00s: between these your max loss is at your short is at your long strike sorry so your max loss in the 10
3620.32s: wide is at 140 your max loss in the 20 wide is at 150 you have a 10 point
3627.12s: point
3629.12s: window greater on the wider spread with fewer contracts
3637.04s: big difference so this is one of the dominant factors that I would point you towards the rest of it
3645.20s: is very very similar now there is another element here which is the probability of being in between
3651.84s: so if you're trading this for earnings and there is big gap potential you don't necessarily want to be
3658.64s: in the middle the middle right especially if you're not paying attention if there's risk of early
3664.32s: assignment if you're planning on managing and stuff like that it's negligible but if you're
3669.20s: planning on you know like maybe checking and there is there is a risk of early assignment
3675.04s: not the end of the world as long as you have the long wing it's not going to break anything however
3679.60s: this there is just a different logistical thought process that goes into 10 wide versus 20 wide
3688.24s: because the probability of being in the middle between the strikes is a little bit different
3695.28s: so not a huge deal but something certainly to be aware of so yeah I mean this this really summarizes
3704.00s: most of it there's a couple other nuances that I think you could point to but most of them
3709.84s: don't really matter that much these are the main ones I would say so that's what I got for
3715.20s: senior sky omen any follow-ups on anything we just talked about as we were going through that
3734.32s: land says can you walk the dog on mnmd I know the stock well I've been following them for a while
3745.76s: funny enough
3756.32s: explaining specifically what filters you're working your analysis through
3763.60s: and why for fellow marinists any profit mechanisms opportunity okay so one of the first things
3778.56s: that I would see here is the way that we arrive at this is different than the way that I often
3793.04s: arrive at trades more often than not the way that I arrive at trades is by scanning and then if
3801.68s: something passes the filters of the scam this is an inverse scenario where we have a ticker that
3809.84s: we're interested in and then the question becomes is there something here that can be done
3817.44s: and there's nothing wrong with this version but that's a very important distinction
3821.92s: in the way that I arrive at trades and this one is that latter scenario where we're just saying
3829.52s: I'm interested in this one for some reason let's see if there's something there that being said
3833.92s: it almost always in that way would start with a fundamental analysis review this for me
3842.40s: is super important especially in stuff like this that I don't follow that closely things that I
3849.04s: have a much closer relationship with I can skip a lot of that because I might already know a ton
3858.24s: about the stock like Nvidia I know about its earnings I know about its sales pipeline and all that
3862.24s: kind of shit this one I don't so this is actually a great example because it's one that I'm
3867.04s: familiar with I followed it for a while but I'm not that close to it so we literally can start with
3873.20s: just like we do in the military and it's kind of a little bit of a leader's recon this is me where
3878.96s: I'm building in contextual understanding and an orientation of the underlying itself which is
3885.44s: important so as always for me I start with just what is this thing done over its lifespan so we can
3894.32s: see that it IPO'd in like the ones rallied super hard up into the 50s this is important for me to
3902.80s: know because these people here are praying for an opportunity to get out they've been in this thing
3912.00s: a number of them from 2021 and it's been underwater the entire time 10 times lower than where they
3920.64s: got in so this group of people will serve as pretty strong overhead resistance again they are just
3929.04s: hoping for an opportunity to get out okay so now if I zoom in a little bit and get a little
3937.92s: closer to the near term price performance I'm actually going to change this one in this context
3942.16s: to 150 day instead of a 200 day just because it hasn't been around as long and it has a much near
3949.44s: term specific price price pattern the first thing I notice is generally downward sloping price
3958.72s: behavior again it's cutting off these so it's not technically correct but this is just the general
3966.48s: trend we can see and this is obviously also represented in the standard deviation channels which
3971.68s: are negative sloping on a one year time frame that's not good the other thing I notice is a lower
3979.68s: low posted here as compared to prior so we can see a low higher low higher low slightly lower low
3994.16s: a higher low with a higher high that then reverted down super hard into a lower low relative to
4001.04s: here a lower high relative to here a new lower low relative to here so this shows a change in trend
4010.56s: and then we see consolidation and then it starts to rally this direction so now we're presented
4018.00s: with a higher low about a same same high relative to these then a small breakout
4026.08s: consolidation still with a lower high relative to this but a higher low relative to this so this
4035.12s: is something that's just oscillating heavily in between accumulation and distribution phases and
4042.08s: you can see that represented in the moving averages they're just essentially wrapping around one
4046.56s: another trending almost sideways so that's really common for things that aren't able to develop
4052.16s: some sort of like actual trend for themselves yet okay next six month time frame to zoom us in a
4059.52s: little bit more I see same negative slope and standard deviation channels I see still overall
4068.72s: bearish price I see pretty significant overhead here and again you can see that represented where
4077.52s: price came up literally touched the point the secondary volume node I should say here not the point
4083.36s: of control secondary volume node and got rejected down again these are typically people that are just
4089.12s: happy to get the fuck out that for a while we're like oh shit I got in way too high and you can see
4096.40s: that there was a pretty meaningful volume node here on a six month time frame and you can see it
4100.64s: literally touched it and got rejected down doesn't always happen but it does tell us that there's an
4105.52s: appetite for offloading at this level then you can see that it consolidated well at this volume
4113.28s: node the consolidation is a little wide for my preference but it's fine and then we see it's
4119.92s: slowly trending using a short term moving average this is a 10 day moving average which is good
4126.96s: the 10 day is now above the longer term moving averages we can see the 20 period is here 10 above
4135.04s: 20 we can see both of those are above the 100 is curious where the 50 was the 50 is lagging a little
4147.76s: bit so let me get rid of let me get rid of this one we don't need the 100
4161.28s: and we'll get this one the correct color just trying to clear up some of the space there so
4175.60s: there's a couple near term price levels that become interesting to me right out of the gate
4180.56s: the very first one is how does it behave again like is it able to like meaningfully break above
4188.16s: these handles like this here first a big thing that I would track as it does that is how does volume move
4196.00s: right so it did get some pretty good expanding volume against longer term averages the 20
4203.20s: and the five but you can see that the five period volume average is contracted meaningfully
4209.12s: so that tells us that overall volume is slowing down and we know that it's going to need more volume
4215.20s: to break above especially where the sellers are happy to offload we can see a bullish
4226.72s: drift here and this is actually pretty aggressive so I envision it looking to make a decision pretty soon
4237.28s: now based on just a loose technical analysis like we talked about here my intuition leads me to think
4246.56s: that it looks like it generally wants to continue trending up however it really seems to depend on
4254.32s: an upcoming catalyst a big part of that will come from this earnings which we need to look at
4260.32s: it's unfortunate that it looks like it came in right on target we'll have to actually look at the
4264.32s: earnings though and see what kind of guidance is there now next thing I want to take a look at is
4271.68s: the fundamentals and I just want to get a sense of how it's been trending so this looks pretty good
4285.12s: a pretty meaningful year-over-year change and then quarter-over-quarter general trend is good
4292.48s: for EPS we need to get a look at like sales data and stuff like that so we'll have to grab another view
4304.48s: because that's really the next main thing I'm interested in here
4316.48s: so let's take a look here
4322.64s: now again for context this is still me literally just getting context that's all none of this means a
4332.72s: whole lot to me yet so EPS
4344.88s: yeah
4353.84s: yeah let's take a look at important stuff
4360.80s: so liabilities coming down is good I really care about um sales
4367.92s: we need we need sales
4377.12s: let's take a look
4396.88s: no sales is that correct
4406.96s: m and md sales
4418.56s: no it looks like it has oh no that's insider stuff let me take a look at its recent earnings release
4436.88s: I want the actual earnings release
4452.80s: here we go so I prefer to go to like the actual company website
4460.48s: so let's take a look at their earnings release
4475.28s: so it's in a phase three for this treatment
4482.24s: so this starts to become an important like they're they're in a tenuous point here
4503.44s: this is just talking about the
4507.28s: conduct of the study and where they're at
4512.48s: and then this one is for like autism which is a little bit different I don't think that's like
4516.16s: their main I don't think that's their main bag
4521.92s: so the 245
4525.76s: sufficient to fund the company's operations into 2027 so this tells me that there's not necessarily
4531.44s: a significant revenue source and they're using these investments to position themselves
4538.40s: rnd 23 mil general admin 8.8
4545.28s: Jesus
4547.92s: these are the kind of things where yeah like this
4553.36s: these are the kind of things that I like to keep an eye on
4558.32s: because if the company itself isn't profitable I actually care a lot about what the
4563.92s: comp package looks like for the leadership so I'm going to ask Gemini what is the compensation
4573.84s: package for mnmd leadership let's see if that can find an answer and I'm also as you guys know
4585.84s: I like to look at different ones so I'm also going to ask chat you PT
4592.56s: and then I will also ask rock and then I will also ask perplexity
4606.88s: and let's see what answer we like the best
4609.28s: as a report around 29 May the CEO Robert Barrow their annual compensation was 2.67 million
4625.44s: 23.4% of salary 76.6% as bonuses that's fucking crazy
4634.56s: chat you PT corroborates it says 2024 total comp 2.669 base was 623 incentive plan 359 other comp 14
4655.36s: stock awards not disclosed super groc generally confirms it goes back to 2021 which is a little bit
4666.80s: longer than the others and then perplexity comes back 2.67 which is correct so then other key
4676.48s: leadership the chief medical officer is 1.3 chief legal officer 1.16 executive president 2.66
4687.60s: like we talked about co-founders 501 that's fucking crazy for something that's not profitable yet
4697.92s: that's crazy that they're paying that much to those people I hate that so that's that now let's
4707.60s: take a quick look at the options markets and see if there's anything interesting in here I'm
4714.72s: actually going to start in the platform a little faster so it looks like general general expectation
4722.48s: to upside and it looks like land rush says FDA legislation and it looks like people are
4728.64s: positioning for a bullish play on that because there's a little bit more call side build out it's
4734.24s: still not a ton I do want to look at term structure and then I want to look at
4738.88s: low so this is interesting there's definitely something expected in the 20 June expiration
4755.52s: like without a doubt yeah without a doubt
4766.72s: and that's printing at 82% vol and then let's take a quick look at the actual options chain
4776.32s: I want to take a look at the actual premium premiums that are sitting
4785.28s: big call side big call side september about the same these are all like small though it's like 3000
4797.28s: 20,000 like these are all pretty small plays 34 up front this is the most noteworthy by far
4805.60s: 34k here against $735 that's nuts so that's I mean like the biggest that
4815.04s: there's just no big players in this as we're looking at it that I think generally is coming through
4834.16s: and this is just somebody that's buying units
4840.08s: and this was on the 28th
4845.04s: it's still not massive so the options market looks like it's indicating a slight bullish
4853.36s: skew but it's not massive overall it is generally large relative to it though
4862.64s: there's just not like a ton of players in it so that kind of affirms my broader idea that it
4870.40s: seems like it wants to drift up and it seems like the market is pricing in some sort of event
4875.60s: or piece of news a catalyst that's expecting to the upside but this mostly looks like speculative
4882.48s: positioning based on what we can see from the premium positioning right so like if we take a look at
4890.08s: OI you can see that the OI here is at 8 10 12 15 20 and 22 so most of it is like pretty high
4908.96s: even the 7 that's at the money so most of the OI is sitting out of the money which is directional
4915.12s: and you can see a really big percent change in the 18 July build out that's actually a really
4922.32s: significant change right so like 51% added to the 18 July on the call side but it's low overall numbers
4931.52s: so it's not necessarily huge
4935.04s: because it's a small stock and the current OI is not that big so summary not profitable
4946.40s: I vehemonately dislike the fact that the leadership team is compensated as heavily as they are
4953.28s: I think that's psychotic I think the options market and really the price behavior seems to be
4961.68s: indicating towards some sort of near term upside expectation the way that I would trade something
4969.28s: like that is I might trade the positioning for that catalyst however I would not want to hold it
4979.28s: longer term post that catalyst I would just try to trade the move like whatever that move is
4985.44s: two things I would keep an eye on and my expectation would be probably continued options build out
4991.44s: preceding the move and then I would expect to see the underlying itself start to show increase in
4998.16s: volume either very quickly if it's you know priced out on the day or if it's people positioning
5005.44s: into the move because this still isn't necessarily like institutional level size this is still like
5011.52s: pretty small right volume today was 915,000 at a stock that's $7.65 so 915
5020.80s: time 765 it's 6.9 mil so that can easily be just a bunch of different players that's not like big
5030.72s: institutional sizing that's generally yes generally what I see Landrush says everything related to
5038.56s: speculation regarding agent orange white house capital hill position on psych therapeutics yeah I
5044.48s: wonder if there's something in progress there as far as a catalyst maybe like expecting some
5050.72s: sort of output from them or something like that but yeah I mean that's generally generally what I
5057.84s: see interesting interesting find I would essentially be looking to play the near term catalyst or
5068.24s: trading vol in it because the vol edge is huge which is super common for stuff like this I would
5075.76s: probably personally trade it more from the vol lens and then I would layer on the directional
5081.92s: stuff but I would layer that on as you start to see the move or is you start to see more positioning
5090.48s: that's hard look at it cool all right gang that wraps me up as always if you need anything let me
5100.80s: know don't forget there's a new outlier pro tier that's launching you can check it out on in the
5107.52s: discord and then also on the patreon that one has like a 90 minute workshop once a month is the
5114.96s: so a chance to like actually meet via zoom and talk through stuff is what I'm planning for that
5121.52s: otherwise I'll see you all around the discord be an outlier see you guys later
