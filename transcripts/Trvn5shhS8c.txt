0.00s: What's up, outliers time for your weekly GameStop update and things look rough around the
7.24s: edges.
8.24s: It is what it is, but let's talk about it.
10.16s: So first things first, we can see that price is continuing to drift down.
14.84s: We saw this pretty big down move on the 10th.
17.68s: We saw yesterday on the 11th a slight recovery.
22.92s: And then today it actually gapped up.
25.32s: It had a decent start to the day, but then it rallied back down.
28.84s: So GameStop is hovering in this next general value area.
34.88s: And this move down here does surprise me a little bit, but it's not anything too crazy.
40.12s: I think that it's a little bit early to tell where this next trading range is going to
46.12s: be established.
47.52s: But I do think it's super important to remember about GameStop is that right now part of what
53.72s: you're seeing is really also due to the broader market.
56.76s: The broader market is going through massive undertones of change.
61.96s: And what I mean by that is if we take a look at small caps just for a more like comparison.
67.80s: And let's just take a look at the size of the move from this most recent decline.
72.56s: This represents a 13% drop.
75.56s: That's not even using the highs from over here, which represents more like a 20% drop.
83.84s: So the market is struggling.
86.44s: Now I do think small caps aren't the exact right comparison for GameStop.
90.36s: It's a little bit more like a mid cap with all the cash that it has.
94.00s: But the broader point is it's going to be a little more volatile than something like the
97.60s: S&P 500.
98.92s: And that's very much what we've seen.
101.20s: It's had a pretty big down move.
103.44s: But if we take a look at this most recent down move, down 24%.
107.72s: So it's almost double that of what we saw from IWM.
112.52s: And then if we take it from the highs to where it sits now, this represents a 36% decline.
120.00s: So the majority of this move that we're seeing is really accelerating from this point in time.
126.84s: So what does this mean for GameStop?
128.76s: Well, it means first we really have a pretty big earnings coming up that's slated for
133.72s: the 25th of March after the close.
136.20s: And if we take a look at the options chain really fast, it just kind of vet if that makes
141.56s: sense for the 25th of March, we can see that the volatility reflects it because the 28
146.64s: March expiration is at 105%.
149.88s: Volatility, where is the primary expiration before it is at 83.6.
154.68s: So definitely pricing and earnings for this 28 March expiration.
159.36s: We're still maintaining really, really heavy.
161.92s: Paul skew as per usual.
163.36s: Now what I want to do is see how we're positioned though for this earnings event.
167.76s: It's very bullish 3636,714 calls against 97 42 on the put side, which is pretty significant,
176.88s: especially for a non standard expiration to have that kind of skew.
181.32s: The next primary expiration, 21 March is at 99,000 against 26.
186.28s: And then this front is at 90 against 20.
190.04s: So 21 March and 14 March are about the same 28 March will be the next big thing to take
195.48s: a look at with earnings coming up.
197.88s: The volatility picture looks very similar across the board.
201.20s: There is a little bit of contango and backwardation mixed in across the terms.
205.44s: Now a quick update, however, on the coverage strangle position, this was asked and I definitely
212.32s: owe you all an update one because this is the exact kind of market that's worth discussing
217.12s: the strategy.
218.52s: So before I show you that I want to show you what it all looks like.
223.12s: So this is the position as it sits.
224.88s: I've loaded it in.
226.04s: Again, this is a pass through IRA count.
228.16s: This isn't my actual account, but I use it to show everything to keep the account details
232.56s: off.
233.56s: But this is the position that I have on right now.
236.24s: You can see we're long 250 shares at 28, 21.
239.52s: We're short five of the 17 April 23 puts, which are going to be topical here.
244.68s: We're short two of the 21 strike puts for a dollar 53 same expiration 17 April and then
251.36s: also 17 April.
252.68s: This is a recent change from I think yesterday or the day before where we took down some
258.20s: of the prior calls and now we offered two of the 28s.
264.00s: Now the 28s effectively are like in the money, meaning they are below my basis.
270.24s: And that's something I have to monitor pretty carefully because I have no intention of
273.96s: allowing these to be assigned there.
276.76s: But I sold them there because I'm trying to collect a little bit more money with this
281.40s: suppression.
282.40s: And you can see that the basis of my long shares is still 28, 21.
286.92s: So if we take a look at the overall utilization that we're sitting at, it's actually moved
291.92s: up to 91% because I've added these.
295.16s: The reason why I've added these is because my expectation is when I go to roll these
303.72s: that I'm probably going to try and decrease the size using some of the accounting for
308.80s: these new puts that I offer here so that I can start freeing up a little bit of money
313.40s: to buy shares outright because with us being 30% off of peaks there, I would love to
319.24s: grab at least another 50 if not another 100 shares with us down here in the low 20s.
325.76s: But I still need the underlying to stabilize before I would start buying in any significant
331.20s: volume.
332.20s: And again, this is all relative to the small position I have earmarked here, which is
335.48s: a $25,000 allocation.
337.68s: Now one super important note, if we take a look at the performance of GameStop from the
342.84s: start of this exercise is at 2431 now it's a 2199 that represents a 9.5% decline from
349.28s: the entry.
350.52s: If we take a look at the return on invested capital, this includes the total PNL, the
356.78s: total PNL of the position that I have as it sits today is still profitable.
363.00s: How is it profitable that from when I first started trading this position, the stock has
367.04s: gone down 9.5%.
369.12s: And this is a long delta strategy, well it's for two reasons, one because of the short
372.82s: puts and how much volatility I'm able to collect from these.
377.08s: There's super high volatility trades.
379.96s: The second thing is if we take a look at the call side, again, they're not making a bunch
385.88s: of money, but they're also not making nothing.
388.24s: So the short call side of the equation is still producing a source of returns for GameStop.
394.12s: So even though the underlying itself is definitely struggling at the time of the position,
399.00s: my position is literally up money.
403.00s: Now I did choose to roll these so you can see I took it from the 25s to the 23s.
409.92s: These came down for a small debit, 205 bucks.
413.48s: I could just write that off as just taking the trade down, putting up a new one here,
417.56s: it doesn't really matter.
419.08s: But just so that you understand that the accounting here is otherwise differentiated
424.32s: in my mind, it is technically a role from this position.
429.00s: So now let's take a look at what's been going on in GameStop under the hood.
434.00s: I haven't seen any sort of significant news breaking anything like that.
439.00s: If we take a look at the options chain looking back over the last seven days, I mean it's
443.08s: literally anemic.
444.76s: We're seeing the lightest premiums that have effectively I've ever seen.
448.92s: So GameStop is about as quiet as it can get from an options perspective.
455.84s: And then if we take a look at what, that's the wrong one.
458.88s: If we take a look at what the net flows represent in GameStop, you'll notice a couple key
467.64s: trends.
468.64s: Specifically, we did see a small spike in call flows yesterday, but the majority of it
475.64s: is been net negative on the call side, meaning people selling calls.
479.88s: And this isn't inherently a bad thing.
481.96s: This is also a lot of people that have positions that are just selling calls against their
489.00s: long shares.
490.36s: And it's a pretty smart thing to do when the underlying is churning down like this.
496.08s: So if we take a look at the last couple things related to GameStop, there's still this
502.52s: conjecture about GameStop's involvement in Bitcoin, but there's really nothing that's
509.96s: been very confirmed as of yet.
514.60s: We can also see across this that I thought was that like pretty interesting from last month,
520.52s: where there was an expansion of positioning in GameStop by a lot of these large funds
525.96s: like BlackRock Morgan, Stan Lakeleman, Sachs.
529.00s: These all came through the 17th Feb as when they were reported, but I find that to be
535.44s: pretty interesting given the price behavior of GameStop sense.
540.56s: So the last thing I'll note is I think earnings is the next big thing that's on the table.
549.80s: And I don't really have these grand or expectations of earnings because it's really going through
554.04s: a broader cost-cutting cycle right now.
556.48s: So the probability of these being some great incredible earnings is very low.
560.44s: But that doesn't mean that we might not at least get some sort of hint of what's going
565.44s: on.
566.44s: I hope with the cash that they have, although I'm not expecting it as of this point, but
570.96s: it would be a great surprise.
572.88s: So it's a bit of sit and wait, manage the positions, no issues with any of them.
578.04s: I'm in a great spot with the coverage strangle.
580.28s: I think that right now is a great time to continue trading, especially short premium strategies.
586.24s: And we will see where the next trading range is between that and earnings.
590.40s: That's what I'm keeping an eyeball on.
592.24s: As always, if there's anything you would like me to take a look at, let me know, be an
595.44s: outlier.
