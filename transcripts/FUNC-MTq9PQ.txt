0.00s: What's up everybody, Eric here, and I am back with David Hunter. I was just chat with him
8.16s: real quick before we started. This is the fourth time he and I are meeting and it's actually
13.32s: really useful at least for my perspective because I get to understand his thought process
18.72s: then as we get new data, how that impacts his thought process because really you're teaching
24.00s: us different ways to think about markets and the economy. And I think that that's just
28.36s: tremendously valuable. So first off, welcome back, great to have you.
31.60s: Yeah, thanks Eric. Glad to be back.
34.04s: Yeah, and since the last time we spoke, there has been no shortage of drama in the economy
41.60s: and the market. So I'm really eager to get into, you know, how you think things are rolling
47.24s: out and what you're looking at. So I figure we could start a little bit about the broader
53.92s: markets. Last time we spoke again, it was about three months ago. We were talking about
57.72s: this idea of recession and I had asked you if you thought we were in a recession at that
62.28s: point, you said you thought so if not right on the precipice of entering one. And I'm
68.16s: curious how have your thoughts evolved around that concept? What are your thoughts on our
73.00s: position in relation to a recession?
75.00s: Yeah, for sure. Since I think we spoke in June. So, so after after that last conversation,
84.80s: we obviously got second quarter G P in, you know, later in July. And it confirmed that
91.80s: we had two quarters of negative GDP, which by, you know, traditional definition, that's
97.40s: a recession. You know, there's lots of ways to kind of look at what is, you know, whether
102.64s: it's a recession or not. But I think for sure, the economy's weak. I think technically
107.88s: we're in a recession. I think more than technically, you know, the economy was showing negative
112.92s: GDP. Third quarter, we bounced a bit, not a lot, but you know, a little bit. So, you
120.12s: know, you can argue that we may have stopped the negative. But I think we're heading for
125.44s: much deeper weakness. And so, you know, you're going to in recession, you're going to go in
132.16s: and out of GDP, positive GDP, negative GDP, until you really get into the depth of the
138.40s: recession. So, you know, my view, which has not changed is that we're on our way to a global
144.60s: bust. I define a global bust and actually a global deflationary bust. I define that as
150.48s: something bigger than a recession, but not as long as a depression. It might have some
155.92s: of the characteristics of a depression, but happened in kind of a concentrate period
160.96s: time, like a year. So, I think, you know, 2008-09 was almost a bust, but they saved it before
168.88s: really got into that. So, I think this time we see something worse than 2008-09, which
174.44s: would make it the worse since the Great Depression. And I think it'll be accompanied by a financial
181.40s: crisis, the likes of which we have not seen. So, bigger than 2008-09. And that means, you
189.32s: know, bank failure is a lot of involuntary debt liquidation. You know, lots of unpleasant
197.40s: things. I think that's likely second half of 2023. You know, you never know exactly when,
208.56s: because we're recession into a global bust. Isn't two different things. It's just it takes a while
214.44s: for you to move into the real depths of it and where you get to the point where the financial
220.44s: crisis gets big enough where it causes a bust. So, like I said, we haven't seen one in post-war
226.84s: or two-era. We came close in 2008-09. I think this is going to surprise people in terms of the
232.44s: magnitude. But before we get there, you know, you're going to be kind of going through this period
239.40s: of up and down. Are we in a recession? Are we getting up a soft landing? Are we going to have a hard
243.32s: landing? Ultimately, I think we're going to have a hard landing.
248.04s: Well, that actually leads beautifully into my next question, which is last time we talked about
253.16s: exactly that, the concepts of soft landing, hard landing, and the way that markets have been moving
259.72s: in relation to which one of those is more likely. Last time, you also felt that we were more likely
266.04s: leaning towards a hard landing. It sounds like that's about the same. Has there been any additional
271.48s: data input that has reinforced that hypothesis or is it essentially just ceterus parabus?
277.16s: Nothing has really changed. Same thing. Probably the thing that has just increased the
283.96s: probabilities of a hard landing and increased probabilities of a global bust is the feds in
289.64s: transit and transigence in terms of rate hikes and feeling like they have to go a lot farther.
298.68s: As I keep saying on Twitter, I believe the current fed is making perhaps the largest policy error
310.12s: in history, certainly in the history of the fed. What that means is I think they are overtightening.
318.12s: We've seen rate increases at a speed that is beyond, there's no precedent for the speed with which
327.00s: rates have gone up. The fed doesn't think their work is done. They keep talking about another 75,
334.28s: but maybe another 75 in November, December, and then maybe pause there or maybe do some more hikes
343.56s: in 2023. That's got the market very spooked and for good reason. Again, they haven't really even,
352.36s: they've just begun quantitative tightening, meaning pulling money out of the system,
358.28s: but these rate hikes are unprecedented and I think are having a dramatic impact. Just look at
365.08s: mortgage rates. Mortgage rates went from 2.5% to 7.5%, almost 7.5% here in a matter of,
371.88s: you know, within this year. And, you know, in past times, this is what really surprised me.
377.88s: In past times, you know, I've been through many cycles and I've watched the fed through many cycles.
384.28s: Oftentimes, they overshoot, but what typically happens is they start hearing from, you know,
393.80s: the Realtors and, you know, the banks, industrial companies, and again, you know, they all have their
405.48s: spokesmen that speak for the whole industry. And they get to the Fed and say, you know,
414.28s: we're worth maximum pain now. You've got to back off. The Fed seems, I'm sure they're hearing from
420.76s: some of those folks, but the Fed has shown an inability. It's almost like they've got
428.92s: their ears closed and blinders on and they're saying, we don't care what pain is going to
435.32s: happen short term because we think that's so necessary to get inflation down. And they are,
442.04s: I think this is a Fed that's way over their head. I don't think it's the most qualified Federal Reserve
447.40s: or FOMC we have ever had. In fact, I think it's, it's being led by a lawyer who has brought into a,
453.64s: I think, a very false narrative or a bad narrative in terms of thinking that he's got to drive
460.28s: the stock market much lower to impact financial conditions to the degree necessary to get inflation
467.72s: down. I think that's a very false narrative. It was started by Bill Dudley who was the former president
474.20s: of New York Fed, former senior councilman, Goldman Sachs. It's probably the dumbest thing or,
481.64s: or most dangerous thing that's come out in a long time. And yet he convinced Powell that that's,
488.28s: that's important that that should be their primary focus. And, and Powell has very clearly indicated
497.08s: that that's his intention. And that's what we've seen for several weeks to a little the last few
504.36s: months, you know, particularly the last few weeks. He's trotted out all his FOMC members
512.44s: speaking from the same him, no constantly saying the same thing. And one trying to up the other
518.04s: one in terms of sounding more hawkish, trying to scare the market down. That's his whole intent.
524.36s: And, you know, we, we saw last Thursday, a week ago, Thursday, the market opened and went
532.12s: straight to 3,500. And it broke some important, some levels of people thought were important technically.
539.00s: And just, you know, cascaded down to 3,500 in the first hour of the opens. And, and then reversed.
547.56s: That, that was driven by comments, you know, more hawkish comments. And ever since he's continued that,
554.76s: they, I think they believe minimum we've got to get the market down near 3,000. And I think Dudley
561.96s: really believes it has to go a lot lower than that. So maybe Powell does who knows. I think they're
566.20s: going to be have their head handed to them. I think they're going to be surprised that they don't
571.88s: control the market. But for a while, the rhetoric did scare the market. And that was what really
577.24s: pushed the market down and kept it down. And every time it lifted a tad, it'd go back because they'd
582.68s: send out some more speakers. It's just a very amateurish way to run policy in my opinion. And it's
590.04s: also very wrong headed narrative that he's wanted to. But the good news is, you know, the market's
597.80s: going to overpower the Fed. The Fed thinks they're in charge. They're going to be surprised that
601.96s: the markets will move against their efforts. And today, you see the market up, you know, the SPS
609.64s: up almost 80 points, over 2%. And, and that was the result of one or two Fed officials coming out
620.60s: and softening their commentary. So they weren't quite as aggressive in stating that, you know,
630.84s: we have to do another 75 and we have to do another 75 Mary Daly, who's head of the San Francisco Fed
637.80s: and has been talking like all of them very hawkishly. Just indicated that maybe we need, you know,
645.08s: we need to consider that we're doing, you know, we're causing harm overseas. There's the risk
650.36s: rising all around the world. Maybe we need to think about softening our approach here a bit. Maybe
657.56s: we need to, if not pause, at least hike less aggressively for a little while here and see what,
664.04s: you know, what comes because that's that's the other thing that I think is amateur hour about Fed
669.80s: is that they don't understand reads and lags. They give lip service to it, but the reads and lags
675.96s: are quite, you know, quite lengthy. So they're, they're looking at current when the CPI comes out,
683.00s: it's the last month's CPI. So they're looking backwards and determining forward policy based on
689.80s: numbers. It's already a month old and and with with a numbered that is with a inflation that is
699.96s: typically, you know, a year lagged at least. So, you know, in other words, they can, if they're going
707.72s: to conduct policy based on old news, they're guaranteed to go way too far and they're tightening.
713.96s: And my belief is they've already done that. As I say, the seeds for a global bust are already
719.56s: sown. In other words, the tightening they've done already is way past where you've already
725.72s: created a hard landing and that hard landing is going to become something even worse than
730.92s: hard landing in a global bust. And again, it's global. What also surprised me is that the Fed is not
738.28s: hearing from central banks around the world saying, he's up guys, you know, you're causing us a lot
743.40s: of pain. You know, we can't handle it. We don't have some resiliency you have. You saw it in the UK
749.80s: when the guilt market went crazy and there was, you know, the pension funds over there were at risk.
760.84s: You've seen it, you know, in other countries, in other areas around the world, you know, Japan's
766.36s: going through some of its self-inflicted, but they're going through some real problems that I think
772.68s: are down the road cause real problems for them. But, but, you know, it's surprising because in the past,
780.28s: you'd see by now you would see the central banks get together and do a coordinated, you know, easing
788.04s: or in this case, the dollar is very, very strong against all those currencies. And normally,
795.16s: you'd see a coordinated, you know, effort to get the dollar down because it's putting a lot of
802.20s: strain on countries around the world and on other currencies. So the fact that we're not seeing that
808.84s: is troublesome because it indicates either the Fed is, you know, basically deaf to all the
816.44s: conversations they're hearing or that we have central banks around the world that are all over
823.48s: their head and not really doing what we've would have seen in the past cycles. And that is my concern.
828.68s: I think we clearly have a situation where inflation hasn't been around for 40 years. So you've got
834.68s: a lot of people in these positions that never lived through the early 80s I did. And, you know, they
840.28s: all think we got to do what Volker did. Well, there's, you know, number one, that's a very different
844.92s: situation. Number two, the pandemic happened. And so a lot of what's happened here is related to
851.80s: the pandemic in terms of inflation. Ukraine happened. The invasion of Russia's invasion of Ukraine happened.
859.40s: That also is something that's different than the early 80s. So you've got a lot of things here
866.20s: that you got to sort through and realize this isn't just simple, you know, well, this first time we've
873.00s: had double digit inflation or close to double digit inflation since the early 80s. We got a
879.32s: follow of Volker's playbook. He was a hero. I'm going to be a hero. I mean, I don't know what's
884.36s: going through Paul's mind, but he has invoked the Volker. He had many times and said, you know, he's
892.60s: trying to basically emulate that. So it's very concerning right now that we have a Federal Reserve
899.88s: that may think they have a handle on things, but really don't.
906.68s: So in the end, I think they're closer to the end that they're tightening whether they realize
914.68s: they're not because I think the markets will ultimately force their hand and the economy moving
921.72s: towards a place where they're going to finally wake up. But, you know, who knows when exactly they're,
927.96s: you know, and the street in typical street fashion, they get caught in narratives. So they think
934.12s: you've got to have a Fed pivot, meaning Fed lowering rates again before the market can move.
941.32s: And I've been pretty clear that I don't think that's what's coming is that the market will move
945.88s: before the Fed, both the bond and stock markets, I believe, will start rallying before the Fed
952.12s: Pivots. Today's a good example. All you need is a little change in the rhetoric and the market will,
959.32s: you know, have a more hopeful movement. And then, you know, it couldn't. It's not going to be a straight
965.80s: line. All you need is them to come out next week and reiterate their hawkishness. You know,
971.24s: have a couple of speakers come out and reiterate hawkishness. And it can take a step back again. But
977.56s: ultimately, I think we've seen the lows in the stock market last week. And I think we're beginning
983.80s: what I call the final leg of before the year, a secular bull market.
991.88s: One of the things you mentioned that I'm really curious about from a personal perspective is
996.68s: the Fed's receptiveness to kind of foreign partners expressing concern over the way we're
1004.28s: approaching rates and inflation. One of which comes to mind is the UN, they, I saw an article,
1009.80s: I don't know all the details behind it, but essentially, they were asking the US to chill out
1015.00s: with the interest rate raises. That made me really curious because I anticipated that the Fed
1022.60s: is wise enough to understand the impacts of what they're doing on the global market and other
1029.48s: economies. And I thought it was interesting that the UN chose to essentially ask them to stop.
1036.20s: I don't understand why they went about it that way. Is it literally like a last ditch,
1041.48s: Hail Mary? I assume they must have already talked before, you know, they come out with an
1045.72s: official statement asking the US Fed to stop raising rates. Do you think that the UN is just
1052.36s: back into such a corner now that that's where they thought was the last chance for them to get
1056.52s: any reprieve from the rate movements? Frankly, the last person I want to take advice from
1063.08s: on how to conduct monetary policy is the United Nations. So, you know, they're, I'm sure some of
1071.48s: their constituents are concerned about what's happening in the world economy. So I think it comes
1078.44s: from there and they're seeing some of the strains, I'm sure. But it's really the other central banks
1085.40s: and other central bankers that, and I have no doubt the central banks are talking. I'm not saying
1091.64s: that Paul is shutting shutting down communication at all. I'm sure he's hearing from others.
1097.88s: Like I said, I'm not sure what others are saying. You know, they don't speak in one voice either.
1103.80s: So he may have heard from some that are concerned. But the ECB, I think, is probably a bit wrong-headed
1113.24s: just like he is. The Bank of England, I think, is they all are focused on inflation. And I think
1122.36s: at the, you know, without understanding that with the leads of my eyes, the real risk now is deflation.
1131.96s: You know, I think, as I said, next year is a global deflationary bust in my opinion.
1137.96s: And they're all worried that inflation is running away. So they're kind of caught in
1143.32s: what I think is yesterday's problem. And because of leads and lags, they're staying the party way
1150.36s: too long on the tight side. So it's not that he's not hearing that he's refusing to hear.
1160.04s: I just think they are in a mantra right now. They're locked in a narrative or
1165.00s: believe that the most important thing right now is to defeat inflation. And their idea of
1171.96s: defeating inflation is we need to see the signs in the CPI. In the past CPI wasn't even something
1177.80s: the Fed paid a lot of attention to because, you know, it's a flawed index. But for whatever reason,
1185.00s: it's the headline index. And certainly since June, Powell has made that front and center. So
1192.44s: the market makes that front and center. Every time there's a CPI release, a monthly CPI release,
1197.80s: that's watched as closely as the jobs number, the monthly jobs number. And like I said, in the past,
1205.00s: the Fed looked at the consumption deflator. And that was their primary one. That tends to, you know,
1213.48s: not be as the big swing. So there's just a lot of reasons why I argue that this FOMC
1222.36s: led by this guy. And I've been, you know, critical of him in the past, but also complimentary
1227.88s: of times. But I personally think J. Powell's way over his head.
1233.96s: So thinking about the Fed handling all of this, one of the things you were talking about is
1240.36s: the market potentially forcing their hand to kind of pause their campaign on raises.
1246.68s: I'm curious, what do those market circumstances look like that would cause the Fed or Powell to
1253.32s: then take a step back and say, okay, we need to stop raising rates here or, you know, whatever other
1258.76s: pivot they think makes sense. It's going to be the economy and inflation. Probably could either
1269.72s: be either one that, you know, what we're setting up for. And I don't have a prediction of one that's
1275.88s: going to happen. Like I said, it starts with something like today where some FOMC members,
1282.44s: maybe they've heard from people or maybe they're just using their own their own heads, but
1287.88s: they're beginning to question, how far do we go before we pause? Because that's the other thing.
1292.52s: And this is another sign, not to jump around, but this is another sign of, I think, calls
1299.40s: I don't want to say an experience because you've been on the Fed for a number of years, you know,
1302.52s: in this role and prior to that, but he's an attorney and he's, you know, he's a financial guy. He's
1308.76s: not an economist and the problem is that I think he's seeing this as linear. So in other words,
1318.60s: we've got to do all our tightening now, you know, again, in previous times, not that other Fed
1324.20s: chairman haven't made plenty of mistakes, but oftentimes you tighten and then, you know,
1330.52s: going back, let's go back to the to the early 80s. You know, we had a double dip recession.
1336.84s: You know, in 1980, you went in, you came out of it, then 81, you went back into it in 82.
1343.00s: And it was because they didn't do everything in a straight line. They they paused to see what,
1348.52s: because it leads in legs. You don't know what damage you've done for many, many months.
1354.76s: And if you just kind of decide, we're going to go here because that's, you know, we're going to go
1360.52s: until we see the, the inflation come down, you know, you've gone too far. So, you know, what you're
1368.44s: going to see, I think, at some point in the next, I'd say next few months is a pause where they're
1376.84s: going to at least finally wake up to the fact that, hey, we don't know how much damage we've done.
1383.08s: There's plenty of signs that we've done a lot of damage in housing. There's plenty of signs that
1387.96s: the consumers start to have problems. And industrial is obviously having problems.
1395.24s: commodity prices have come down. Maybe we need to pause and see what the effect of all these
1401.64s: hikes that we've done since April, you know, April and June and July and and September.
1410.36s: And soon to be November, you know, all those hikes, maybe we need to pause because we've,
1415.96s: you know, we've taken rates from almost zero up to over 4%.
1421.72s: And, you know, maybe we need to, maybe we need to step back. And I think today was kind of the
1429.24s: beginning of that unfreeze. And I think as we move forward in the next couple of months,
1434.36s: you'll see more of that because I think the economy is going to be so often in certainly housing.
1439.40s: It's going to be showing some a lot of pain. Autos probably. Anything interest sensitive is getting
1447.16s: hit now. And so, and the other thing that kind of along with inflation, he's, he's saying, okay,
1456.44s: we also have, we have a double mandate. It's employment, basically, and inflation.
1461.24s: Inflation is too high. We're going to work to get that down. And we're going to stay tight because
1464.92s: of that. And we're not worried about being too tight because employment is pretty strong. Well,
1471.72s: employment's another laggard. You know, you're, you're not going to know, you're not going to see the
1476.12s: employment tip until way too late. So he's using, you know, again, he's not showing that he really
1482.60s: understands leads and lags. And I keep repeating that not here, not just here, but, you know, in all my
1489.40s: commentaries. And that's really the issue is there's big, there's long leads and lags to policy.
1496.20s: And, and if you don't understand that, you almost guarantee that you're going to overstate on the
1502.60s: tight side and create a crack. What's the risk if they do take that pause? Like, what would stop
1512.28s: them from taking that pause and seeing how things go? Is it simply the appearance that they don't
1518.36s: have it under control? Still, I don't understand the, the downside if they go through cycles of raising
1525.16s: and they apply that methodology where they say, okay, we've raised, you know, 75 basis points,
1530.36s: three quarters in a row or whatever, or, you know, three meetings in a row. Let's take a pause for
1535.24s: the cycle and see what happens. Why don't you do that? Yeah, it's, I think there are a couple
1540.68s: of reasons. One, they, they got criticized roundly for being late to fight inflation. You know,
1549.40s: they, they viewed it and I don't even hold him, you know, people take him to task for that last year
1556.04s: that he called it transitory because he was right. So I'm a bit, some inflation was certainly
1561.08s: transitory and I think he was right about that. But this year's inflation took everybody by surprise,
1566.28s: certainly him. And so I think he's taken very personally, and I think the whole FLMC that they've
1575.48s: been roundly criticized for being late to understand what they needed to do. And I think they're trying
1581.16s: to make up for that by being overly tight now. And they keep, they've even said it themselves,
1587.88s: they're worried about their credibility. They're trying to protect their credibility by staying
1592.60s: tight. So say, see, we, we really, you know, yes, we were late, we admit, we were late, and we
1598.44s: should have tightened sooner. But now you're seeing, we're real inflation fighters. And I think they're
1603.08s: overdoing their concern about their credibility. I mean, the focus is to the right thing for the,
1609.80s: you know, for the economy and, you know, set the right policy. And I think they think they are,
1617.00s: but you know, anytime you allow your personal credibility to be part of the argument,
1623.64s: I think he ran a risk of an error. That's number one, and I'll go back to Dudley. Dudley's,
1630.20s: Dudley's thesis about the market having to go a lot lower to, to, to feed inflation is front and
1638.68s: center with the Fed and certainly with Powell. And I think that's more than anything else right now,
1646.20s: the reason why he's afraid to pause. If he pauses, he knows the market, just like today,
1653.24s: I'm sure he doesn't like today. But he wants to market down in today, the market's up to percent
1658.44s: and looks like it's running. He doesn't want that at all because he's bought into Dudley's thesis.
1664.92s: And so I think every time we rally, it's pushing off his willingness to pause,
1672.84s: not that he was thinking about it anyway. I think he's, the positive thing about Powell is I think
1680.36s: he's been very transparent and very sincere about what he's trying to do. I don't think at all that
1687.72s: he's playing a game where you get that a lot. There's people who are distrustful of the Fed,
1694.04s: so they always think they're kind of doing this on purpose or trying to hurt the economy for
1701.00s: new world order reasons or that he's lying to us. He's doing one, he's saying it, but he's not really
1710.28s: meaning it or whatever. No, I think he's very transparent, very sincere. I think he's a,
1715.96s: he's a decent man trying to do his job. I just think he's very wrong headed and over his head
1722.52s: and making a big error. One of the things we talked about last time and you touched on it earlier
1728.28s: was the housing market and the hypothesis was that we would see some contraction in the housing
1734.20s: market, which we certainly have started to see that I'm a little surprised at the relationship,
1741.40s: though, between what we're seeing happening with rates and subsequent housing prices. It doesn't
1746.28s: seem like housing prices have contracted quite as much, at least as I would have anticipated with
1751.48s: rates going where they are as fast as they are, but obviously I haven't been around as long as
1755.40s: you have. So I'm curious what you think about that relationship and where you see the housing
1760.68s: market moving over the next six to 12 months. Yeah, I think the next six to 12 months is going to be
1767.16s: pretty awful in housing. I think what you get is and certainly saw it in July, you had us
1774.92s: spike in rates in early June when we got the CPI out the Fed did their first 75 base point hike.
1784.12s: And then and then through the balance of June and through July rates came down
1789.08s: and what you get is all those people that felt they missed their chance to buy a house because rates
1798.52s: went up when they came down they they're kind of that pent up demand that jumps back in say oh we
1805.24s: got our last shot let's get in. So that postpones the real hit housing and they've had some of that
1812.92s: over the last you know certainly the summer months. I think now with more of these rates at 7 7% plus
1821.72s: it shut down housing quickly and I think the next six months and certainly the next 12 months
1827.88s: you can easily see a 20% 25 maybe even the 30% backup in housing you know housing prices you know
1836.92s: break down housing prices and you're definitely seeing them in the activity a lot the real
1842.28s: result you know the activity is really slowed down the interest has really slowed down it's a
1849.72s: that's part of why the bus is you know probably second half of next year is because it just takes
1855.80s: time for all this stuff to work through the system for those reasons and you got the people who
1861.40s: will if they get you know if let's say the mortgage rate went from 3% to 4.5 or 5 when it came back
1870.28s: down to 4 I don't remember what the numbers were people aren't saying well I want I got to get
1875.48s: back down to 3 now they say okay at least we got a break and rates let's jump on now so they think
1881.24s: they're they're you know they're getting their last chance and and that works through you know
1887.16s: at various levels but I think once you get up to here you know if you've seen any of the numbers on
1894.84s: what a 7% mortgage does versus 2.5 or 3% mortgage to the what you can afford it's it's
1904.60s: tremendously much you know you can't pay nearly you can't buy nearly the same house because your
1911.48s: mortgage payment is doubled so I mean that obviously there are people that it doesn't you know money
1919.16s: is no object but for the majority people buying that's how they're buying is what can we afford
1925.40s: and you know they move from 2.5 to 7 changes affordability in a huge way so there's zero question
1933.08s: in my mind the house ain't going to get hit as hard as you know the hardest it's been hit in you
1939.88s: know since 2008 and could be harder than that even you know 2008 you had the subprime situation
1948.04s: this time it's a different dynamic but I think it's a you know this rapid rise and rates is a big one
1955.32s: yeah I think that makes sense and it's a really good explanation thank you for sharing that
1959.16s: because I was genuinely just curious from my side because I was a little surprised at how they
1962.76s: seemed to decouple a little bit um moving forward now we've talked a little bit about
1969.24s: your general hypothesis that we see a pretty robust market run up or a melt up it as you refer to it
1976.04s: before we start you know this later capitulation um I'm curious you've shared a little bit of
1982.12s: background on what that looks like and what the catalyst could be but could you dive a little further
1987.24s: into detail in terms of you know you've shared that you felt maybe last week is where we might have
1993.40s: posted lows so what really drives the next stage of this melt up in your eyes. Sure um yeah let's talk
2002.52s: about last week last week I thought going into uh you know the end of last week last Thursday it
2010.52s: looked like we were going to retest June low basically June lows were I think 3640 or thereabouts
2017.96s: we went down through with 3600 in the month of October and you know last week and and it looked
2026.52s: like it was gonna probably stop you know 3580ish I think was about where it was and it looked so that
2035.88s: and people said oh it's broken that that June low so you were talking about a retest that can't
2041.00s: be a retest or a successful retest I said no that's the way a lot of retests go is they'll they'll
2047.72s: break by a little bit and then uh reverse you know the the market loves to get you guessing and so
2055.32s: when it when it went through 3600 I was hearing that and then Thursday morning when it went down
2061.88s: the 3490 to you know went down 3500 that was a you know a bigger break and I had people say well now
2069.08s: you're you're a retest of the June lows that thesis out the window and it really is it or was
2077.08s: you know it was just a slightly bigger break to scare a lot of the weekends out to convince people
2083.96s: we're going a lot lower and then within an hour of the opening it began building up the other way
2090.20s: and you know we're we're a couple hundred points or more above that now um and so um I think that
2099.00s: was a successful retest of the June low is basically a double bottom um as as crazy as that might
2105.48s: sound since it you know it's 140 150 points lower than the June bottom but that's that's within
2113.32s: the way you know past bottoms how they retest um and so I think we're probably you know I could be
2120.28s: wrong it could go back through there and go to 3400 or somewhere around there uh I I think there's a
2127.16s: very good chance that that was our retest that we had at the middle bottom and that we're beginning
2133.08s: the next leg up um and I I do want to explain because people always say well is the meltup started and I go
2139.88s: um yeah I just wanted people to understand the term meltup the real meltup part of the next
2147.00s: leg up is probably going to kick in after the new high so 4800 S&P you get above that decisively let's say
2155.56s: to 495 5000 that's what will convince people that hey this is real this isn't just uh
2163.48s: fair market rally you know and you're gonna have people coming in that's when you can get the
2168.20s: vertical run a meltup means basically the parabolic part of a rally so so the meltup doesn't start
2176.84s: at 3500 or you know it's not a meltup now it's a it's a new in my opinion it's a new leg of a new
2185.00s: bull leg of a secular bear uh bull market so so this you know just like March 2020 to December 2021
2193.64s: was a full leg this one will be you know from 3500 up to 6000 plus in my opinion and I think this
2202.12s: one that one took 21 months you know the 2020 rally this one probably takes half that or less so
2210.60s: you know I'm guessing it could take six months or less but um it's basically the meltup is the
2218.36s: latter stage of it it's when you finally run what I call the blowoff or meltup stage going into a top
2225.48s: but it is the rally at least to the meltup it is the final leg in my opinion and I think it's begun
2233.32s: that doesn't mean it goes straight up you could rally you know for a little while and then have a
2240.04s: you know a week or two of pullback um well you could you could go straight up so it's hard to know
2247.64s: exactly how you know how the path will proceed but what I think is pretty clear is that we've
2253.72s: seen the lows or at least I believe we've seen the lows and that we could we could run here pretty
2260.60s: fast of 4,64650 and maybe maybe pause there pullback correct you know give it a chance to breathe
2270.92s: before it runs because this thing's going to be a steep rally it's hard to know it's you know it's not
2277.08s: going to do you're not going to be able to count on charts and say it's going to do exactly this but
2283.40s: I think I think you're it's dependent on how um you know first you're going to have short covering
2291.16s: you're going to have a lot of you know we're in we're in pretty high short shorting territory
2298.20s: those shorts as this thing moves up because they thought yeah we can rally to 3700 or a little above
2304.92s: as it's in moves up above say 38 3900 you're going to have more of them saying hey maybe I get a
2311.24s: cover you know maybe this has more legs than that then as it moves further than that you're going to
2317.24s: have more people saying more investors saying well the momentum is to the upside now I got all this
2323.48s: money on the sidelines maybe I better put some money to work uh you know both institutional and retail
2329.80s: saying I've been positioned defensively now I've got to get back in because this thing has legs
2334.92s: and then the final piece is when you get to those new highs and I think
2341.64s: FOMO kicks in you know fear of missing out kicks in and everybody jumps in and so while this is
2347.00s: this is real and this is going a lot farther how the big question I get a lot is how can you be so
2355.32s: bullish when you're talking about a global bus next year the economy looks like it's heading for
2362.12s: a global bus right now the feds talking about tightening for many many more months the bomb
2369.00s: market's been going against you how how can you be so sure you're going to have a meltup and two
2376.20s: pieces of that one is the fact that we have sentiment at levels where you don't get too very
2384.44s: often in by some measures it's a worst ever but certainly it's back to 2008 nine levels or
2391.80s: you know previous bear market levels like 1982 or 1987 or 2003 so so you're at levels that
2402.52s: historically have indicated you're pretty close to a bottom it's not a timing element so it's not
2409.16s: like you can look at bear sentiment and say okay I got a buy but it does say an awful lot has been
2415.96s: built into the market already discounted in terms of the bad news when you have sentiment at that
2421.64s: level when you have you know you don't have to look very far to hear people talk bearishly
2427.72s: everybody's as I say everybody's on one side of the boat you know they're all sitting on one side
2433.16s: of the boat negative and if you get this thing moving against that view you got an awful lot of
2440.92s: firepower there and and I just described different kinds of investors you know short covering and
2447.48s: and institutions and retail and some that are momentum and some that are just long term
2453.08s: investors that got scared but you have a lot of people who for different reasons are going to say
2460.52s: my gosh I'm missing this and my gosh I can't afford to be this defensive you know with so much cash
2466.76s: it's gonna you know it's gonna start punishing institutional investors that have bogies to me
2472.12s: etc so as it moves up and then psychology is the other big piece as it moves up
2479.24s: people chase momentum you know the psychology people are most bearish at the bottom and most
2484.12s: bullish at the top and the tape draws them in each direction so as the tape got more and more
2489.32s: negative investors got more and more negative as the tape meaning the day-to-day movement in the
2494.28s: market got more and more positive investors will become more and more positive and put money to
2500.12s: work so that's you know psychology is a big part of how markets work so that's you know because we're
2507.00s: so so positioned against the market right now so bearish it's pretty easy for me to say
2513.88s: once this thing gets started it has a lot farther to go than people realize because everybody's been
2520.52s: you know in in agreement that it's going a lot lower and they'll have to reverse that so that's
2526.04s: one and then how how do they fundamentally get there and what I say is that once investors and
2535.24s: particularly institutions but retail follow them once investors the institutional investors
2541.80s: get the sense that the feds tightening cycle is coming to an end you know that they went too far
2548.68s: and they kind of was really getting weak they're not they're not looking at today's earnings or
2554.44s: today's fundamentals and buying or selling stocks based on that they're looking out six to nine
2560.68s: months they're looking at what will what will the landscape look like a year from now nine months
2565.88s: from now once they get convinced that the fed is done or almost done they will start looking over
2573.40s: the trough the trough in the economy the trough in earnings and they will start factoring in let's say
2579.24s: 20 20 24 earnings and so they'll be able to say yes the earnings are getting you know the quarterly
2588.60s: earnings are getting worse but we don't care about that because that's where it discounted we're
2593.08s: looking over the trough to the next cycle that's what I think particularly that move from say
2599.32s: 4800 to six or seven thousand that's what that move will be mostly is the belief that hey the
2607.48s: tightening cycle is behind us and this is you know this is 2009 again or this is 1982 3 again
2616.60s: or this is 2003 again where you have a full cycle ahead of you so you you need to get back in
2623.56s: because there's a big cycle and earnings coming so that's what you know again I'm not saying
2629.16s: that's what ultimately happens because I do think this is a last hurrah not the beginning of a new
2635.32s: cycle but that's how I think it will draw investors in you know that will be the narrative that drives
2641.32s: the market it's interesting you actually did a really good job I think as well explaining the
2647.88s: initial catalyst because that was going to be a follow-up question but you hit it right at the end
2651.96s: like what actually gets the wheels started moving you know from here to that you know 45 4800
2659.00s: handle but I think you you shared that pretty pretty well thank you for that one of the things I
2664.60s: want to make sure we touch on is let's say we get this melt up and we're now hanging out around
2671.80s: 6,000 between six and seven thousand S&Ps what starts the conversion then from that last blow-off
2680.92s: top into this global bust yeah so so as I said before it's not you know some people think when I
2689.88s: talk about the recession now and a global bust next year they think somehow they're two different
2695.80s: things I go no the recession ultimately morphs into a bust because things progress to that point where
2703.96s: you know banks start failing and things start happening it's you know I think traders have a hard
2709.08s: time with it because they're thinking in the moment you know they they don't realize that this
2714.84s: stuff takes a long time to play out I'm forever saying you got to let cycle play out and that just
2720.60s: means it takes months and months and months for all this stuff to be just like your question about
2725.56s: housing you know it doesn't all happen the men are rates go to 7% it happens over time because
2731.96s: you know there are different people out there in different places in terms of their
2735.88s: position to buy a house or with hand so and and plan to do it so so inventory is build up and you've
2745.56s: got to correct inventory that's a process all those things so so it it just takes time but once we
2754.44s: get up to the top psychologically most people are going to be all in so the investor looking at the
2761.72s: market the investor is going to be most bullish at the top he's he's extremely bearish now and
2768.92s: you know when markets up you know up with two or three thousand points from here he's going to be
2776.04s: fully bear bullish and he's going to be arguing with me who has now turned bearish as to why I'm
2782.04s: wrong because don't I understand there's you know there's a long cycle ahead if it's not tightening
2788.60s: anymore because the economy is so weak but the other piece to this is that the economy can get a
2797.72s: lot weaker because of the damage done now that whole thing of staying too long now and and I think
2805.88s: what's going to happen around the world is you're going to have a crisis financially like we haven't
2813.96s: seen so it's it's going to require a lot of effort on the part of the Fed and other central banks
2823.24s: in terms of pumping money and on the part of governments to try to prop everything up I think it's
2829.16s: just going to be a huge mess so and there's pieces of this I can't know yet but I suspect given the
2837.72s: Dudley thesis imagine what Paul and Dudley are going to be thinking if the market at six or seven
2845.64s: thousand when they thought it needed to get to say 2500 to tighten financial conditions so they're
2853.24s: they're not going to walk away from tightening that street isn't going to be worried about that
2857.24s: they're going to feel like because the economy is weak and inflation has come down a bit in the next
2863.64s: say four or five months they're you know they're going to say tightening is behind us or at least
2871.00s: for a period of time is behind us but I think the Fed's mindset is going to be we have unfinished
2876.76s: business yes inflation is down I don't know where it will be six months from now but let's say it's
2884.12s: five or six percent on the CPI you know they're going to say we're not it you know we're not we
2892.44s: haven't beaten inflation yet it's starting to come down but there's still risk and guess what
2897.88s: we got a very speculative market here with investors at you know hyper risk levels again
2907.00s: you know very bullish and and speculating we need we need to tighten again you know and we need
2915.48s: to get this thing down so again I think Dudley's thesis is going to rear it to ugly head and we'll
2922.44s: play a role in that top I think they'll be back to tightening the market will probably ignore it
2929.88s: initially but I don't know for how long because I think I think if if I think they've sown the
2936.20s: seeds to a bus now and then they come back and tighten again they're exacerbating something you know
2943.24s: um so it's and again it's there's leads and lags to all of this so it's it's not going to be evident
2951.96s: in in the results uh immediately in other words there if they raise right rates and yet the markets
2959.48s: moving up um people aren't going to necessarily say oh wow this hiking rates is dangerous you know
2965.48s: there so so they they may not it's not like but a bell's going to go off and people say okay I made
2971.88s: my money now I'm getting out again they're going to be getting in you know they're going to
2975.64s: think there's a long runway ahead and they're going to disagree with the Fed
2981.56s: got it and I know we're coming up on time there's just two questions I've left for you the first
2986.52s: one is what's your take on the relationship and the behavior that we're seeing really in the bond
2991.56s: market right now um I've obviously I've been trading for a while and a lot of times I'll trade
2997.64s: risk on risk off relationships and this year is very interesting in that that relationship is
3003.40s: obviously different than it's been historically I'm curious your thoughts on how bonds are behaving
3009.32s: and what that looks like going forward yeah it's it's certainly been a surprise to me I you know I was
3016.68s: this summer saying it looked there was a you know a uh set up where it looked like you were going to
3022.52s: run back from 250 to three three and a quarter and then head lower and it pushed right through
3028.76s: that three and a quarter and it has run up to you know four and a quarter here a little higher um
3034.60s: and so that was you know not in in my you know I didn't have any foresight now that I missed that um
3041.00s: but I think it is part of um traders have gotten caught in what the Fed is doing which is
3049.96s: watching CPI every month so if you you know if you go back and look September CPI came in and
3055.24s: everybody thought okay um you know they they may if not pause at least start lightning up on the
3063.00s: rate hikes because September CPI may start showing that you know we've peaked in inflation and
3069.56s: starting to come down well instead we got a higher CPI print part of its technical part of it is
3075.72s: the what makeup of the CPI and the fact that it's you know imputing rent uh rent probably peaked
3083.48s: the year ago but it's it's making it look like rent has a lot further the bill etc um so so CPI
3091.16s: was prize in the market it's just hyper tuned into CPI now and tuned into anything that goes with
3100.84s: the the narrative that the Fed has long ways to hike here and so that kind of hit the markets in
3106.76s: September and again here this month um but um I kind of lost my train of thought what was it oh so
3115.08s: that that pushed the rates up you know once you got above three and a quarter then you got you
3120.60s: went back to the highs around 348 I think now once ten you're got above that it became just a
3127.08s: technical run and then this most recent jump and I thought okay um you know we'd go on up above four
3134.52s: and then came back down and look like we're gonna go back and retest you know for a wait or wherever
3140.04s: it's gotten to um and it just pushed right through that today and it went all the way to 431 I think
3148.52s: um I think it's really just kind of um a little bit in in the same way that the stock market had to
3157.56s: go to 3490 to get investors spooked enough um and get investors to start extrapolating that into
3168.12s: oh we're going to 3000 or what have you I think the 10 year going to 430 all of a sudden everybody's
3175.64s: you know on the uh you know out on the the ledge saying okay we're going to 450 or 5%
3183.32s: in other words I think it was the capitulation sell off potentially it's still early to know
3187.96s: that too early to know that but I think that may have been just kind of the last uh gas
3194.04s: to get all the weak hands out of the bond market and and then you can start the reversal so
3200.68s: if I'm right right should start coming down uh between now and the end of the year um maybe fairly fast
3208.60s: but certainly roll over and start coming down well if I'm wrong in the head's higher uh you
3213.96s: I'm just missing it but but um I don't think right now when and I look at a lot of things I don't
3221.56s: just look at you know what's the bond what's 10 year going to versus what's stock market gonna do
3227.80s: there's a lot of factors out there right now a lot of my cross market stuff and things
3232.76s: are more confirming my belief that we are at a very important reversal point here
3238.60s: both in bonds and stocks you know bonds are are lagging here a little bit so you got to wait and see
3245.56s: stocks I think we bottom less Thursday if if bonds falls through next week and you get more rally
3252.76s: uh I think it will it'll just add more evidence that maybe today's action early you know
3259.24s: this morning's action in bonds is a lot like early morning third less Thursday in stocks
3266.04s: meaning that then they reverse right got it and I'm we're pretty much button right up the time but
3274.04s: I got to make sure I squeeze this one in because um I think it's still really pertinent to the
3279.00s: broader picture here how do precious metals fit into this picture for you I've actually been
3285.32s: really surprised that some of the behavior of gold specifically I trade gold futures pretty regularly
3290.52s: and gold has been interesting to me so I'm curious how does how do you precious metals fit into
3296.76s: this broader hypothesis of us into the melt up and then subsequent bust yeah I'm glad we didn't
3303.00s: leave this this uh interview without talking about gold and silver because I think we are we were
3308.44s: at a huge pivot point in gold and silver in my opinion yeah I've been I've been uh bullish for a
3315.40s: long time and I keep thinking we bottom and then we go back and make lower lows I think we were at a
3322.92s: some I'm the boy that quiet wolf but but I think we were at a major pivot point and I'm expecting
3331.72s: both the miners and the metals to begin to move up from here pretty aggressively so
3338.28s: you know you could see uh you know 15 or 20% move in the miners um let's say in the next couple weeks
3346.60s: um you know I think so working in the very short term silver looks like it's got rooms around
3351.40s: 22 23 um you know gold I think back over 1900 and in in the course of the next you know six
3360.76s: nine months uh you know I continue to call for gold at 3000 and silver at 50 or higher so I'm
3368.44s: I'm a huge goal on the metals and what when I did my work for my last letter when I went back and
3375.32s: look what is very clear is that gold and silver rolled over in particularly gold but skull and
3381.96s: silver rolled over almost coincident with the dollar moving up back in April uh march April and
3390.52s: it it's almost entirely that rate rates played a role too for sure and most recently I think
3398.28s: played a role in this weakness but if I'm right um the dollar is about to roll over and if the dollar
3406.04s: rolls over that's going to be music to the ears of uh golden silver you know investors so um I
3414.60s: don't think it's a lot more complicated than that um you know golden silver are in my opinion
3421.64s: as undervalued at this point as they've been in decades relative to other markets and I think once
3429.56s: they start going they're going to get sponsorship you know this this idea that crypto is taken away
3435.00s: they're um particularly gold you know taken away from gold uh may have in the short run
3441.32s: attracted people that would have otherwise been gold buyers but I think the story really was the dollar
3448.84s: and and again we talk about rates when we talk about the Fed but the truth is that the dollar being
3457.40s: where it is is because of Fed policy it's it's another reason why I am so adamant about saying
3463.24s: the Fed's making a huge policy error because they seem to ignore you know the the dollar in just
3471.00s: 2022 just this year just 10 months the dollar has moved from I think 95 you know d x y from 95 up to
3482.12s: you know uh 115 or where about that's a huge move with the Fed with the Fed and the Treasury not even
3490.84s: paying attention to it as if it didn't matter that that's why I'm surprised we haven't heard more
3496.44s: from you know foreign entities and why the central month's price central banks haven't been on
3502.12s: on the phone with the Fed over and over saying you got to do something I mean look at look at what's
3506.52s: happened to the yen again that's a lot of itself inflicted inflicted there and it's going to lead
3512.68s: to a disaster there because they're about to um deepag interest rates they've been keeping their
3520.20s: rate of a quarter and if they let that run they they don't have to you know they're gonna they're
3526.84s: gonna run is a real problem to give it what they've done over the last several decades with with um
3532.68s: you know how they've held things together there so so uh you know there's there's plenty and that
3538.52s: will be part of the bus as well there's plenty of things out there that will you know a year from now
3543.96s: be front and center in the global bus because of policies that have taken place here in the last
3549.48s: few years but but um I think if the dollar is rolling over as I expect the gold and silver are
3556.92s: about to have big runs David I know we're at time and thank you honestly for taking some extra time
3564.20s: on that last question it was kind of an unfair one to throw one at the last second but um I wanted to
3569.24s: make sure we had a chance to talk about it because it is I think part of you know my general curiosity
3574.68s: as well and one thing I want to make really clear to people who listen to this video is I definitely
3580.36s: see a lot of folks comment about oh well this didn't happen or this didn't happen at that exact
3585.48s: point and what I think is so powerful about the information you share is the thought process you
3592.52s: shared the things that you look at the relationships between different factors and I learn so much
3599.32s: every time I talk to you so thank you so much for taking some time to chat with me and to share
3603.88s: your experience with the broader community I think it really is super useful yeah if you if you
3608.76s: don't mind I just want to comment on that a little bit because it is please sorry what I see on
3612.84s: what I see on Twitter too um I really believe and this this dates me a lot because I was in this
3621.32s: business before computers were were on our desktop so I really believe that you know what we've
3628.76s: evolved to now on the retail side it's true on both institutional retail but on the retail
3634.12s: side in particular they are now bombarded with all kind of information you know they have their
3640.76s: fingertips um you know charts and things that they can see second to second minute to minute
3648.12s: and unfortunately I think what has happened again this is my my view but I think what has happened
3654.36s: is it's turned a lot of people who would have otherwise been investors into traders and somehow
3661.16s: I think a very large chunk of retail investors somehow believe by watching the market every day
3669.64s: and watching it minute to minute they're more on top of their portfolios and more on top of what's
3675.56s: going on and what it's leading to is expectations that things are going to happen quickly you know
3683.08s: again the institutional traders I you know I oversaw trading desk when I was chief investment officer
3689.24s: or head of a equity department so and and I had good friends that were traders that worked for me
3696.76s: but and traders have a different personality a different mentality and they're watching
3701.64s: markets from a different perspective than a portfolio manager so I'm not putting them down
3706.20s: but traders retail traders unfortunately I think a lot of them don't understand how long it takes
3714.60s: for things to play out so my biggest critics on Twitter and the reason I have so many people
3721.00s: obsessed to them the most extreme bull in a bear market but but a lot of them what I see in the
3727.88s: criticisms is a lack of understanding of what a big picture macro call is versus a trading call
3735.88s: and you know or how long it takes for the big picture to play out and I'm not just using that as a
3743.64s: you know to kick the can down road so you gotta let it play out it's a cycle call means it takes time
3749.32s: to work through that and so I'm you know I'm focused on you know where's the market going to be
3755.56s: at the top I'm not necessarily focused on what's the you know what's the bottom in the market on the
3761.88s: way to that top or what have you so yeah I'm not or or if I think you're going to make a double
3767.48s: volume and it goes a little lower that's not my focus so but the most important piece of what I
3773.48s: wanted to say we're just that I think if people could understand that watching the market so closely
3782.12s: is typically counterproductive for most of them you know there's exceptions some may be really good
3787.88s: picking things off and and doing the short-term trading stuff but most of them are investors but they
3793.16s: think somehow watching it every day means they're getting more information and they're going to be
3797.72s: better at it and or you know better at understanding what's coming and what I see is complete
3803.40s: opposite I think it it leads to almost a blindness from from watching things too closely
3811.16s: I and not to draw it out too long but I just I couldn't agree with you more I'm a trader myself
3817.40s: and I've noticed my evolution where that exacting happened where I wanted to trade short-time frames
3824.76s: and then as I started integrating longer time frames I actually started becoming far more successful
3830.76s: in trading so I'm really glad you bring that up especially from a trader's perspective and I think
3835.48s: that's actually one of the reasons why I love talking with you is because folks with your perspectives
3841.08s: you force me to zoom out you force me to consider an alternative way of looking at the bigger picture
3848.12s: that you're absolutely right a lot of traders get sucked into you know the X move that S&P 500 made
3854.20s: today so I really appreciate that perspective and sincerely again thank you so much for
3859.96s: taking some time to chat with me and share your your information and obviously would love to have
3864.84s: you on again in the future and until next time no thank you okay Eric thanks David
