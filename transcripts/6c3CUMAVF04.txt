332.00s: which
333.00s: had
336.00s: future
338.00s: trade in
339.00s: close
342.00s: for
344.00s: hanging out
346.00s: and

360.00s: Kirk
361.00s: awesome
362.00s: to have
364.00s: the
366.00s: gang
368.00s: and
370.00s: today
372.00s: and
374.00s: a
376.00s: many series kickoff
378.00s: which will be in
380.00s: twenty-six
382.00s: and this many series
384.00s: was
386.00s: not holistic but designed to tackle a lot of very basic concepts
390.00s: with respect to trading
392.00s: into
394.00s: shino lens on them
396.00s: so things like
398.00s: how to take an idea that you might have
400.00s: and turn it into a trade
402.00s: things like how to actually create
404.00s: things like that
406.00s: and i think
408.00s: a little more broadly
410.00s: when we think about trading
414.00s: most of what we do
416.00s: falls into a couple
418.00s: broad process categories
422.00s: and what i want to talk about
424.00s: is what some of those broad processes are
428.00s: and how we actually
432.00s: get better at them
434.00s: you will have heard me talk about a lot
436.00s: this idea of like focusing more so
438.00s: on the process versus the outcome of individual trades
440.00s: and obviously like i am such a firm believer of that
444.00s: this session today
446.00s: we have three things on the
448.00s: docket we're going to go over this little quiz
450.00s: that i have up on the screen for you
454.00s: this is just
456.00s: pulling together some broader concepts
458.00s: that we've talked about
460.00s: at again like a really simple level
462.00s: like nothing in here is too crazy
464.00s: but design just to get the brain working a little bit
468.00s: then after that i want to talk about like where i think it makes sense
472.00s: for people to go next in terms of like what to focus on
476.00s: and then at the end we have time for just a generalized open Q&A
482.00s: so the purpose for that is i try to set time aside for us to have like up-router
488.00s: conversation whether it's pertaining to some of the stuff that we covered in the course,
492.00s: whether it's stuff not in the course, whether your curious will kind of
496.00s: books might be good to read, whether you want to explore different
500.00s: methodologies to creating wealth that isn't relegated to trading
504.00s: it's kind of open ended in that way
506.00s: so here we go
510.00s: the first thing here it says if you want to buy a call
516.00s: that's most important we have implied volatility is option A
520.00s: price movement is option B and time is option C
526.00s: so throw in the chat which letter you think is the correct answer
532.00s: is it A, B or C
534.00s: ICB, ICB again ICB
538.00s: Lawrence has all but B
542.00s: okay so i don't think i trick anybody here this is good
548.00s: the reason why i threw this question in
552.00s: is because a lot of times you will hear things like don't buy options if
558.00s: volatility is high or don't buy options if implied volatility per
564.00s: is high. And in a nutshell, that is entirely wrong. And it's because we can find instances
572.80s: where something might actually have a high IV, you buy a high IV, and then you end up getting
580.64s: a subsequent move that you want. So let's explore that concept really, really quick. Let's just
587.60s: find some stuff that has a pretty high IV. We'll go into the platform really quick. Just be a
596.96s: little easier to find stuff with high IV in here. All I'm going to do is, again, look for stuff.
604.88s: That one's VRP, which is okay. Let's take a look at implied volatility for Senn'sile.
612.00s: All I'm doing here is I'm looking for stuff that has high implied volatility percentile.
618.72s: And we're looking at stuff that has weekly options. Most of these have earnings of some sort.
624.80s: IAU. This is great. This has an 87% implied volatility percentile. IAU here, which is a gold ETF.
635.60s: And if we take a look at what the volatility in here looks like in IAU.
647.04s: And we just chart out super quick what the percentile's look like for these longer duration,
656.56s: midterm duration options. And I see stuff in here that's like from the 20th,
662.16s: 30 day options were at the 80% implied volatility percentile. 80%. So it means implied volatility was high.
671.36s: Let's take a look at what the rawval was on the 20th. On the 20th, rawval was 21. And it dipped
680.56s: down to a low of 1988. So it dipped down two points. Here's what you've been told that if you see
692.32s: something like this that has high implied volatility percentile, you shouldn't buy options in here.
701.60s: The other thing that you're told in systematically over-emphasize is trying to get cheap
709.52s: ball and not paying enough attention to the direction. So let's take a look at what happened here.
714.72s: In this scenario, volatility declined by like two points. Let me get eight so that we can track this.
723.76s: To actually know, we'll just use let's instead use this. What I want to do is literally
734.32s: track some of this with you so that we can take a look at the scenario. So here implied
743.20s: ball in the beginning was like 21.6% or something and then it dropped to 19.8% or so. So in terms of
751.68s: what volatility is done, volatility is declined by like 1.8%. However, this corresponds to like an 80%
764.72s: implied volatility percentile. Now let's take a look at what price has done over this corresponding
774.00s: time frame. And all I'm doing is again, I'm using the price movement from that corresponds
781.20s: with this move involved and I'll get rid of the extra stuff so you can see what I'm doing.
785.04s: I'm starting when fall was kind of high like a few days ago. Let's go here when it was 23% on the
794.32s: 19th. So on the 19th, it was 23%. And then if we take a look on the low, here is like 196 on the 25th.
809.68s: So then if we go 25, no. It was like 196. So this is what fall did over that time frame.
821.20s: And let's take a look at what price did. What I want you to pay attention to is the difference
828.00s: in what you've been told. Again, what you've been told is you shouldn't buy this ball because
834.16s: implied volatility percentile is high. And I want to be clear that in and of itself isn't a bad
841.52s: general way to think about it. You don't want to overpay for stuff especially systemically.
846.56s: It just stacks the cards against you. But let's say that for whatever reason in here, you had some
853.44s: sort of stronger directional pieces. So let's take a look. So on the 19th price was, I'll take the midpoint.
865.68s: So it was like 77. So spot price was 77. And then let's take a look on the 25th.
878.64s: The midpoint was 77.90. Ish something like that? 77.90.
888.16s: So here you got a point nine point move against a 3.4% move in terms of fall. Now depending on what kind of
906.16s: options you had, this could either be a profitable move or it could be a completely not profitable move.
916.00s: It's really because this thing hasn't moved a whole lot.
921.20s: Yet if we take a look at what damage this did, it really depends on what options you chose.
932.00s: Now again, we're using 30 day options for this example. So let's take a look at what 30 day
939.36s: options look like right now. And we just want to get a sense of what the general fall might be that
945.52s: we're dealing with. So we'll go here to 28 days. We'll go to something that's at the money.
951.36s: Your Vega here is 0.087. So let's go back to our document. Your Vega is 0.087.
963.28s: And your delta there was 0.53. Let's see what happened here. We moved 90 cents.
974.56s: So what that means is you don't get this whole delta move, but you get some of it.
981.28s: In terms of delta, you got 48 cents in terms of your P&O. Here we moved 3.4 points.
996.96s: In terms of your Vega, you got effectively 30 cents of Vega moving against you.
1009.28s: So with that 30 day at the money option, modeling off of current price,
1015.92s: even though volatility declined and even though it certainly did not go in your favor,
1023.84s: you still are in the scenario where the trade itself is improposable.
1032.16s: That is probably one of the most overlooked aspects when we're looking at pricing.
1044.32s: And when we're looking at what kind of options we may or may not want to select.
1051.20s: So the main thing to pay attention to here is that just because
1056.56s: you see volatility is elevated that does not mean that you can't buy options and that you
1066.40s: can't make some sort of profit on your options. Okay, any questions on this first question,
1076.16s: which is if you want to buy a call, what's most important? What ends up being most important
1082.48s: for the long call scenario is if the underlying moves in the direction you want, that's
1090.48s: ultimately what matters and what matters most. Let me see what you guys get. So looks like
1097.36s: everybody is on the same page with me. I see shouldn't it be delta? No, it doesn't have to be delta.
1105.44s: So price movement is what matters. Delta is just a measurement. I wouldn't get those two
1112.00s: confused. Delta tells us the rate of change of premium for a point move in the underlying.
1121.36s: That isn't the same as what the underlying is actually doing itself. So you can have something that's
1130.40s: a 50 delta or you can have something that has some sort of delta, but that doesn't mean that
1134.80s: the underlying moves. Now I understand the the inference that making, but it's a little bit different.
1142.00s: And then black mom says why not gildy? I literally just ran a scan to see what had high ball
1147.28s: and picked something that had high implied volatility per cent. I'm going to give you guys a couple
1154.64s: seconds. I'm going to grab a drink really quick, but I want you to answer number two in the chat.
1161.20s: So number two says if you sell a straddle, price remains relatively flat. I V contracts slightly,
1169.04s: but you still lose money. What might be the reason? So take your best guess and then I will
1176.32s: join back into the second.
1229.44s: All right, let's see what we got. I see black mom says if the loss from the price is larger
1254.88s: than the profit you made from time passing theta and a drop-in-vol Vega, the position will show
1264.08s: a net loss. Good. Kirk says R.D. greater than IV. Good.
1272.88s: Recess realized over implied good. Black mom says a short straddle
1279.04s: creates a tent shaped profit zone. Yep, so you're talking about a risk profile.
1287.52s: It makes money from time decay in dropping ball. Good. That's all really, really good. You
1295.76s: guys did a good job. Brains says gamma not quite. Genesis says realizable plus friction. So free
1306.64s: fees, which is also fair. The thing that I wanted to explain here is the way that price moves
1315.44s: has a really, really important impact on the way that your position behaves even if you think
1324.32s: things haven't done a lot. It still can be enough to move,
1329.92s: evolve and I'm going to grab paint and I'm going to draw you guys in air exposure.
1338.72s: So let's take a look. Here's what I'm talking about. If we have a stock chart
1348.48s: and if price is relatively flat, right, let's just say that it's kind of oscillating sideways
1355.92s: in this consolidation. Just because price is oscillating sideways, it doesn't mean that the
1365.20s: pricing between IV and realized ball is profitable. You certainly can all be it unlikely.
1377.20s: Have this scenario where price oscillates sideways and your move here is enough for realizable
1387.84s: to exceed what was originally implied. Now there's a massive caveat to this question.
1393.76s: And I'm curious who will be able to understand this caveat. Let's say that
1399.92s: the option at this point here, let's say halfway through the life cycle. Let's say that's
1410.48s: where the scenario we just looked at came to fruition. So this is about like 50% throughout the
1418.08s: life cycle of the option. And let's say that your upper strike is here and your lower strike is
1423.20s: here just to pick something random. Now here you can see an unrealized loss. If this
1431.12s: unjulation motion is enough to cause an imbalance between the implied expectation and realized.
1444.80s: Where things get interesting is who can answer this follow on a question.
1451.52s: If we get to expiration at this point, would your option be profitable?
1460.88s: Be for profitable or L for loss. Would you make or lose money? Just throw in the chat a P if you
1467.76s: think it would be profitable and throw in an L if you think it would be a loss.
1474.16s: This is I think easy, but some people can kind of psych themselves out with what we're looking at.
1483.44s: Okay, so everybody says profitable good. That highlights a really really important relationship,
1491.12s: a really important relationship because at the end of the day, if spot price falls between
1499.60s: your short call and your short put regardless of how it looked along the way, it's still profitable.
1508.64s: Period. Even if it had a net loss, this concept again pretty clear, but is really really
1515.68s: important to understand because let's say for example, we get rid of this scenario and instead
1522.80s: let's say that you're trading a short call. So you want to sell a call. Well again,
1530.08s: somebody might tell you, well hey, you only should do this if fall is high.
1541.68s: And why would they say that? Well because you collect more premium.
1546.16s: And a lot of times they're also playing the intent for IV to contract.
1559.76s: Yet let's say that this short call is a covered call, meaning you have long shares that this
1566.40s: thing is being sold against. Why does that makes it too big difference? Because in terms of the
1574.64s: premium you collect short, you would prefer to have more premium than less premium. But you already
1581.04s: have the long stock position. So if you already have the long stock position and if the premium is low,
1588.08s: that might not mean that you just don't sell the premium because the premiums low.
1592.16s: It might mean that you might not make as much on your premium, but you still have the long shares.
1598.24s: So you have a choice between collecting a lower premium or collecting no premium.
1604.72s: Except if you choose not to sell, you get nothing. That's the first thing.
1610.72s: The second thing is even if let's say implied volatility expands. So if fall is low,
1619.28s: the fear is that implied volatility might expand. Well that just goes back to the example we were
1625.68s: just looking at. If we're in here and let's say our short call is here and let's say you sell
1634.08s: at this point right here. And then let's say after this point price starts to move up a lot.
1642.72s: Well, this will cause an unrealized loss, but if price stays below here and we get to expiration,
1652.08s: you still need money, even though this scenario occurred. The other scenario is let's say that
1659.52s: for whatever reason, the pretend that this chart now is no longer price. Pretend that this chart
1667.12s: is actually volatility. So I'm going to plot volatility. The difference is even if volatility
1678.48s: skyrockets and you're experiencing an unrealized loss is long as price stays below this level,
1688.80s: you still at expiration have a profit. This is really important because what you will find
1701.20s: is very regularly, traders will over-optimize for the wrong stuff. They won't sell the call.
1710.48s: If they think fall is too low, meanwhile, if you don't sell the call, you get no premium.
1718.32s: The other thing is that a lot of times they're not paying enough attention to the total life
1723.20s: cycle of the position as it pertains to their broader position. So that is going off of this idea
1733.20s: and this relationship between intermittent changes involved impact to your P&L and understanding
1741.68s: how to use that information to make better decisions about your own trades.
1747.04s: Black Mama says the probability for profit more important than high-iv to determine
1752.64s: a premium worth it. I would fully disagree. I don't think the probability of profit actually matters
1761.36s: effectively much at all and it's because the probability of profit is looking at a bit of a
1769.12s: different scenario. For example, you can have some sort of probability of profit metric that would be
1779.44s: what you're looking for. Let's say that you want a 70% profit and you sell that option at a 70%
1786.40s: probability of profit. I would argue in the context of a covered call that's actually also
1792.88s: optimizing for the wrong thing. I would argue that the dominant force in a covered call
1801.60s: first comes down to your inventory preference. That I think is super, super important
1809.52s: because like you said in your second comment there, scale the highest probability. Well, if we wanted
1815.04s: to sell a call with the highest probability of profits since we're here in IAU, we're going to be out
1822.48s: here. We're going to be out as far out of the money as you can go. That's where your probability
1827.28s: of profit is the highest. The issue with that is you don't collect really any money for it.
1838.72s: So then, sure, you'll win the majority of instances, but you're not really getting anything to do it,
1845.76s: which is exactly why more often than not when we're trying to collect some sort of credit
1852.48s: for our long shares. We would look for something that's at a balance between our inventory
1861.20s: preference, which means the probability that we get challenged where the option falls in the money
1866.56s: against how much money we're making. And there's a bit of a delicate balance in that.
1873.68s: This I'm also realizing for some reason is missing a ton of names. Why is that?
1887.28s: Open interest.
1892.40s: That is super weird.
1895.84s: Does this is missing a ton of names in this scan? I just realized, hey, what's up, goofy? Good to see you.
1910.24s: Let me take a look at one other version.
1916.08s: Does this kind of problematic?
1925.20s: It shouldn't be that limited. I can't tell if it's this IV percentile.
1933.28s: Let's take a look at option.
1935.84s: See, so I see a five ball.
1941.36s: I don't see an IV rank. Let's drop this really quick.
1951.92s: Let's get rid of this range filter.
1954.88s: I'll probably this gives us a bigger list. There we go.
1968.40s: Wait, better. Okay, cool. So it's just that other tool that trading range filter does
1975.36s: a bit of a different function. So yeah, okay, good. This is, this is better. This is what I would
1982.16s: expect to see. And I see a bunch of individual names.
1993.36s: All right. The other thing is the implied volatility percentile here differs from the look back
2000.72s: period here a little bit, which is a little bit annoying. But again, that's the the nature of using
2010.40s: this platform for stuff like this kind of annoying to be honest. But the other way to look for
2017.28s: stuff in here in case you're wondering is just to use their standard implied volatility.
2022.96s: The problem with their implied volatility rank is their IV rank has a series of issues.
2034.64s: And it's because their implied volatility percentile is actually IV rank. So if you use that
2041.60s: just make sure you're aware of that. So for example, if we grab IV percentile and we want stuff
2048.40s: that's at least 30% IVP up to 100. And we run this scan for it.
2057.36s: You're going to get a bit of a mixed bag. And the reason why you're going to get a mixed bag is
2063.28s: because a lot of these things will have a different implied volatility percentile versus IV rank.
2069.76s: And let's just take a quick look at an example so that you understand what I'm saying.
2073.76s: So we have WU LF. So let's go to WU LF.
2080.80s: If we look in here, you can see that the implied volatility percentile is actually 32%
2086.56s: whereas the implied volatility rank is all the way up at 60.
2090.56s: This is a really commonly messed up metric between these two tools. And think or swam
2099.36s: unfortunately gets this like pretty wrong, which is again, it's unfortunate because in general,
2108.64s: we would much prefer to use some sort of like actual implied volatility percentile metric versus
2118.96s: using standard implied volatility rank.
2126.56s: Imply volatility percentile is way more accurate. Now quick clip notes. If I were to actually trade
2133.84s: some sort of vault, I wouldn't be looking up to 100%. I would be somewhere in kind of like this
2139.60s: middle zone. And that's because that's where the vault edge tends to be the best for the selling
2148.48s: side of the equation. In case you didn't know, that is again, a really commonly
2158.24s: mistaken piece. And I'm actually really curious, I'm going to have chatchipykey build a column for
2164.64s: us really quick. So create in, oh, I think is this custom already? I wanted to show you the difference
2173.60s: between implied volatility. Yeah, so this is implied volatility rank, which is incorrect. So create
2181.12s: a column for think or swim watch list that calculates the implied volatility percentile.
2196.48s: So I'll show you really really quick. We got to find a blank custom.
2202.80s: We have any left. We're like on our last one. Not. All I'm doing right now is having
2214.72s: think or swim make a quick script. This is good. This looks, this looks a little
2230.56s: excessive. But I'll show you guys what it came up with.
2244.80s: So it really doesn't need this stuff. We don't need an actual plot.
2251.68s: And let's just drop this in really quick. I just want to compare these
2255.76s: so that you can see the difference between calculated implied volatility percentile.
2265.84s: So these look the same. So this is using the built-in implied volatility percentile versus actually
2275.92s: calculating it. So the way that we would fix that is simple. What we would do is grab the calculation
2285.36s: for implied volatility percentile for here and essentially say use this. But I won't waste
2290.72s: your guys' time going through all that. I just wanted you to at least understand a little bit of the
2295.04s: difference between implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank. And unfortunately,
2300.32s: the fact that a lot of platforms mess them up. All right, let's get back to the quiz.
2306.48s: The next question is, if you want to go along an underlying, how do you choose between buying a call,
2314.40s: buying stock versus going synthetic law? So in the chat, I want you to just overview
2326.00s: how you would make the decision between putting on these different positions.
2331.60s: What would make you lean between these? Kirk says time horizon leverage cost, that's solid. I think
2339.28s: that's a really really good way to think of it. Lawrence's depends on portfolio and risk tolerance.
2346.24s: I agree. I think that one's a little too open to get credit. But I think that's a fair
2355.28s: overall concept for sure. Resets depends duration severity. Sort of. Again, I actually think Kirk
2363.20s: has a really good answer. Brain says IV. That's a good guess. I absolutely would consider that to be
2370.40s: part of the equation. Mom says capital efficiency, risk tolerance, implied fall.
2378.72s: I think of those risk tolerance, again, would inherently apply to kind of all of them in terms of
2386.80s: like you can make them the same amount of risk if you were so inclined. So I think your
2392.40s: answer of leverage in IV is correct. Goofy says I like going for some leverage if I'm optimistic
2400.64s: for the next 18 months. Leaps are better than equity for my risk. Well, I wouldn't think of it necessarily
2406.40s: that way either, just because you start to silo yourself in a little bit more than necessary. I wouldn't
2412.16s: just kind of say like cart blanche leaps are better for my risk. I would think of it more so in
2417.92s: terms of like what fits your the the opportunity that you're looking at the best. So let's think about it.
2425.76s: Okay, so I don't know to say that. Okinawa. Okinawa says liquidity of options versus underlying.
2436.72s: That's a massively important input. If we think about the differences between these positions.
2442.32s: Right. Buying stock is expensive. But if you buy stock, you do not have to worry about some sort of
2453.20s: exploration. That doesn't matter too much because if you have like a solid P&L management plan,
2464.96s: the exploration factor is generally secondary. But that's really the main benefit to holding the equity.
2470.24s: And exactly as wheel stretch, yo points out, if there is a dividend, you collect the dividend,
2476.00s: which is also a completely viable point. If we buy a call, there's a lot of things we can do
2483.92s: to decrease the impact from things like fall. We can decrease the impact from things like
2492.40s: theta decay. But there's still an element of those. The other thing is you can set these up to have
2501.84s: very very different risk reward profiles based on what you expect to see. The purpose of a synthetic
2509.12s: loan is effectively to take a levered stock position. Like that's kind of it because
2518.32s: what you're attempting to accomplish with a synthetic loan is to neutralize the Greeks.
2526.48s: And you wouldn't want the Greeks themselves to devrail a position if you don't have some sort of
2536.80s: opinion on things like implied volatility because like I was saying before in the cover call example
2543.60s: in the straddle. Volatility absolutely has an impact and it doesn't necessarily mean that it's
2555.12s: the primary part of the decision cycle. But it does mean that you have to still incorporate
2564.56s: some sort of opinion with respect to the wall. So let's hold on let me get caught up on them
2574.08s: on the chat. Brain says intention of the strategy I think that's completely fair.
2579.76s: Mamba says synthetic loan best one implied volatility is high by selling the put you finance the call.
2588.00s: I actually disagree. I wouldn't again I wouldn't look at it that way because just like we talked
2595.20s: about in this scenario it really comes down to price movement. So with the levered long position
2603.76s: you decrease how much money you actually can make. Let's take a look at an example here at Wolf.
2609.84s: And let's take a look at going a synthetic loan at 50 days out. It does have high vol. So we should
2621.44s: expect to collect a small credit because of putski we do we get a 41 cent credit which is actually nice.
2629.28s: This is your risk profile. Let's take a look comparatively at a couple options positions. Let's take a
2637.04s: look at just getting the call and then let's take a look at getting an out of the money call
2645.20s: like a 20 delta and then let's take a look at one more and look at a 30 delta.
2656.48s: Okay so let's take look at these different scenarios and I'm going to grab
2662.56s: this so that we can track them together. So we're looking at a
2670.72s: plus 5% a 10% 15% and we'll do like a 25% move. So this is what we're going to track.
2683.12s: And we're going to do this for a few underlines. Also in this infreagues so that you can see better.
2689.04s: We're going to do this for long stock a synthetic loan. We'll do this for a 50 delta
2700.32s: call and we'll do this for a 20 delta. And I'm going to move this off to the side so that I can
2711.68s: fill it in a little bit quicker. What I want to do is again give you context and I'm just
2720.48s: focusing on the upside in this scenario because it's a little bit quicker. So the long stock
2730.96s: if you get your favorable move you get 77 bucks if you get your 10% move you make 154 bucks
2740.16s: if you get your 15% move you get 232. I'm just going to stop at 15% because I think the point
2746.88s: will be clear within these ranges. Now let's take a look at our synthetic loan.
2752.80s: A synthetic loan is 77. 10% is 155 and then 233. The 50 delta call
2769.52s: I have too many I got tripped up. So it's 50 delta okay because we did a 30 delta as well.
2779.36s: So I'll add the 30 delta to a
2782.96s: 30.
2790.80s: Okay. So our 50 delta call you're going to make 39 86 138. Your 30 delta call and again we're going to have to
2807.20s: add a margin requirement part to this as well. Is that's really where you're going to see the
2816.72s: leverage expressed. So let me add a call or margin wreck.
2828.80s: Okay.
2829.12s: So for the stock position you're buying a hundred shares at 1552 so you're going to put up 50.
2845.04s: This synthetic loan you're going to put up 1600. This is in a
2859.12s: contributory IRA account. So it means that that put these cash secured.
2867.60s: If the put wasn't cash secured if you guys can let me know what the short put requirement would be
2874.40s: then I can figure out what the margin would be for like a regular for a wreck T account. So if one of
2879.76s: you guys could take a look at what the 16 Jan 16 put is 16 strike put is in terms of margin
2891.28s: requirement I can update that but right now it's cash secured. Next we have the 50 delta.
2897.60s: The 50 delta is 260 bucks. Next we have the 30 delta call our 30 delta call is here.
2910.96s: So this is going to be 94 bucks in a 5% move you're going to make 23 52 and 85.
2919.28s: And then the last one the 20 delta call should be at the 22 strike. Those are going to be 64 bucks
2930.00s: and you're going to make 15 37 63. Okay. So we have
2939.12s: a Kirk says 1356. Thank you very much. That's for margin account. So 1356. Thank you very much.
2948.96s: I appreciate that. So let's take a look at what these do. So you can see a difference in the gross amount
2959.36s: obviously and it's because in order to put up this account or this amount of money
2966.88s: you're having to tie up quite a bit more. So all I'm going to do now is take these and turn these
2973.52s: into percent returns so that you can analyze and normalize what the return on invested capital is.
2982.96s: Why is that putting the dollar sign after?
2986.08s: What is that? We're to shit.
2995.52s: ZAR. Anyways, let's continue our little plot.
3001.36s: Now you can make a logical comparison. The way you make a logical comparison between these
3016.16s: is we get a sense of where the greatest return on invested capital is and to no big surprise
3027.60s: you can kind of clearly see where that lives. So going back to the point that started this whole
3034.88s: thing talking about a synthetic long, the issue with the synthetic long when vall is high
3040.72s: is you're optimizing for the wrong thing. It's because more of the decision should come down to
3048.00s: what is your expectation versus what you think is going to happen.
3058.48s: Black Honda says so it's riskier. Minutes holding the stop when it's going down
3063.92s: there's a huge but we were credit or zero if so that's your only bet.
3069.36s: Yeah, again the issue with it is that it's just the broader point that I'm making is that it's
3074.16s: optimizing for the wrong thing. Because the original statement that you mean was like if fall is high
3079.92s: default or choose lean towards whatever a synthetic long. My argument is that while that's a
3089.52s: a completely viable consideration to make, if you get the move that you think or depending on
3097.28s: what the move is that you think you're going to get, it really should be based more on what is the
3103.44s: risk profile that you want to extract. So even if the marginal requirement for this wasn't 1356,
3111.20s: I'll take a look really quick in an example of portfolio margin account. I'll tell you what it is
3117.20s: in a portfolio margin account. I'm just using my phone to grab that super fast.
3123.44s: And by super fast, I mean this slow is really possible. All right, let's go to both.
3133.60s: In both, if I go out to 16 Jan and I look at the what we're talking about the 16 put
3141.36s: and I sell that in a portfolio margin account, it's 244 bucks.
3146.16s: So let's say your margin requirement is there. That can massively, massively change things.
3156.80s: But again, one of the important factors is that for the same price for these, you can put on
3164.72s: multiple of these other ones. So the reason why that matters is depending on what the pricing is
3172.64s: that you can get if you're in a regulation T account, it's really nothing that
3181.04s: nothing that magical. Mom says at the end of the day, it depends on the move and how it looks.
3187.20s: Yeah, that's exactly correct. So in I think that that's the most important point, right,
3192.40s: is that it actually doesn't really come down to volatility. And because if volatility is high,
3200.80s: but you still get a big enough move, you can still make way more money with the long calls.
3206.56s: If you get the move, which is, that's the big end, right, do you get the move. The other thing
3212.56s: to keep in mind is that you're actually going to have less risk on the long calls. The reason why
3218.80s: you're going to have less risk is because you're taking on more types of risk. You're taking on
3222.96s: theta now, but the total risk that you're putting up is definitely going to be decrease.
3230.32s: And that's because if the things starts moving against you, your delta's are going to contract.
3236.40s: So then you're losing less per dollar of move and obviously it will continue to slow.
3242.96s: So really, really good scenario to work through together and leads into a beautiful
3250.88s: follow-up, which you guys should definitely know the answer after what we just went through,
3255.76s: which is which option provides you more leverage of 15 delta call A or an 80 delta call B. So
3264.64s: you just throw on the chat. If you think 15 delta for 80 delta A or B respectively.
3270.80s: So I see three A's so far. Okay, does anybody think B?
3280.88s: I see no. So my guess is you guys inherently know Lauren, you think B is that correct?
3297.12s: Brain says maybe B.
3302.80s: Okay, so Lauren, can you explain to me why you think it's B?
3311.20s: Let's explore what that scenario might look like. Let's use wolf as an example. And let's grab
3322.32s: an 80 delta call. So the 80 delta call we're going to get that for 430.
3340.80s: And you're going to get that for 430. And I'm going to move these
3352.08s: so that we can make a quick work at how that 80 delta call B. So 5%
3360.80s: may be get 60. 126.
3369.52s: 6.
3381.52s: And I'll bring this back over. So let me just can see.
3398.72s: Let's take one.
3411.76s: All right. So Lauren, I don't see.
3420.48s: Lauren, I don't see.
3422.00s: You're logic in case you threw it in just in case I wanted to give you a chance to share
3431.44s: what you were thinking so that we can explore the idea. But the answer is A. The out of the
3439.04s: money option provides you more leverage. This has everything to do with convexity.
3448.00s: So if we're comparing an 80 delta, I'm just going to use 20 delta here because it's close enough.
3456.56s: You can see that the return on an invested capital is more for the 20 delta effectively across the
3464.72s: entire board. And it's also much cheaper. So what's going on here with these options that are out of the
3476.24s: money is you're really playing the expansion of delta which is tracked via gamma.
3486.08s: Here's the way to think about it. If we take a look at the options chain and let's just take a look
3495.28s: at what your delta might become as the underlying moves. Because remember, once you have a delta
3503.68s: of one, you move $ for dollar with the underlying. So if you have an 80 delta option
3516.40s: and let's draw a plot of its delta. And let's say that this is where 80 is.
3523.60s: And let's say that this is underlying going up. Your 80 delta option can effectively go up
3536.08s: to a one delta or 100 delta. This is the compounding distance that effectively you get before
3544.72s: your option is simply behaving like a levered law and position moving one for one. Whereas if you
3551.68s: have that 15 delta option and let's say 15 delta is down here and again let's say that your
3563.28s: one delta is up here. In this scenario, again if price goes up, you have a completely different compounding
3571.20s: profile. So your compounding window increases to this. So you can see this total distance
3581.84s: compared to this total distance. This is exactly why your 15 delta option
3591.44s: provides you way more leverage. It's because this 15 delta option has a significantly further
3600.32s: runway for its delta to grow in compound. There is exactly why there's more leverage here
3612.00s: than here. Now there's a trade off. Just as Laque Mamba says that 15 delta has a lower
3621.76s: has higher leverage but a lower probability profit which is actually fundamentally inaccurate.
3630.00s: What he's referring to is at expiration, which again is one of the things that's super important
3635.60s: to understand the difference especially as more nuanced traders to be able to decipher the
3641.44s: difference between something that's before expiration versus at expiration. Because in Black
3651.28s: Mamba's defense, it's exactly correct at expiration. However, it's not necessarily the case
3662.32s: prioritize expiration. Perhaps as the 80 delta is better leverage in slower drift moves because
3669.52s: as its leverage relative to cost but doesn't have the extrinsic value to K.
3674.72s: I wouldn't confuse those curve. That doesn't mean it has better leverage. It doesn't have
3679.84s: better leverage. Again, in your defense and in the example that you're using, it does most certainly mean
3688.32s: that it might behave better and I think that that's okay. It might be a better position in
3694.64s: that scenario. I think that's okay to say. But very, very different. Black Mamba says yeah,
3703.04s: we're referred to at expiration. Yeah, and that's kind of the trick, right? Because when we're talking
3708.40s: about probability of profit, basing the decision or basing the analysis of the
3713.76s: expiration is a really common mistake. And it's because the option obviously looks different before
3721.60s: expiration. So if we made our positioning decisions off of at expiration, especially if we have
3728.40s: some sort of management plan that would lead us to manage before expiration, then we're kind of
3732.96s: making a completely lopsided analysis that in general we would want to avoid.
3738.88s: Kirk says better as in more profitable relative to 15 delta in slower drift moves. Yeah, yep. So we're
3746.08s: definitely on the same page in terms of the potential profitability. I think the new one series that
3750.56s: I'm just correcting the use of leverage, just because it's more profitable doesn't mean it has more
3756.48s: leverage. Another great example of this is we could just replace the 80 delta option with long stock.
3764.88s: If the underlying moves up one dollar but 20 days pass, the long stock on a
3772.56s: quivocally would make more money than the 20 delta call. However, that does not mean that the long
3779.28s: stock has more leverage. Most certainly doesn't. And again, the reason why that point is really
3785.12s: important to consider is because when you're building a portfolio, understanding the relationship
3793.76s: of your positions and how they behave is really, really important so that you can build something
3799.60s: that ultimately reflects what you're thinking of. So, rain says delta times spot divided by
3810.96s: option gives you your leverage factor more or less. I think I wouldn't do it that way but
3827.28s: there's like that's close enough. I don't think that that's inherently wrong but
3835.52s: I think it misses and probably is confusing the point again in terms of like what leverage is.
3842.48s: Black Mama says this delta that we see on chain reflects the real-time probability of
3846.80s: expiring in the money. It's a great question. And the reality is the short answer is
3855.84s: it genuinely does depend. It's a really, really common commonly confused topic. So, I'm going to
3864.16s: link to a video for you to check out of Black Mama, this video is for you and that explores the
3870.96s: relationship of delta as a probability measure versus the actual calculation for a probability measure.
3879.60s: The short answer is it's not. The long answer is there are circumstances where delta
3892.72s: performs absolutely fine as a probabilistic calculation. That said, there's a lot of nuance
3902.72s: in terms of you need to use if you use it in that way. It has to be done with options that have
3910.56s: lower volatility meaning the underlying is lower volatility and it needs to be done closer in time.
3917.60s: So, let's take a look at an example. This right here, this is a 48 delta. If we use this 48
3924.16s: delta, that would lead us believe that this 48 delta option has a 48% probability of expiring in the
3932.56s: money. If we look at the actual probability calculation, it's only 34%. So, you literally have a 14%
3942.16s: variance between using delta and the actual probability calculation. That is everything to do with
3950.16s: volatility and it has everything to do with duration. So, because this popped up in a high volatility
3958.08s: scan, that's why you see that so far off for this distance. Let's take a look at spy really quick.
3964.96s: If we look at spy, same expiration will get close to if we have a fit, well, let's use this 46
3971.36s: delta that's closer. So, this is a 46 delta, we would infer 46% probability of expiring in the money
3977.92s: and it's 44 and a half. So, call it 45. That's pretty damn close. That's because we're not too far
3984.80s: out in time and we're looking in spy, which is much lower of all. So, the way to think about it is
3994.56s: in general, you're just way better off using the actual probability calculation. There's no real
4000.16s: reason to use delta. If you're in some sort of scenario where you have to use like a back of an
4005.60s: app can and you have to use delta or you have access to delta for your calculation like you can get
4011.84s: a buy because all you need to do is add like a mental deflator to it. But other than it being a really
4018.16s: lame party trick, there's really no use to like using delta versus the actual probability
4026.40s: calculation. So, to summarize all of that, I would absolutely just use the probability calculations.
4032.88s: Because the other stuff that gets messed up is the probability of a touch where people would infer
4038.32s: that it's two times delta, which that also breaks down quite a bit. So, it's a great question.
4044.80s: I hope that that helps if you have any follow-ups. Let me know.
4049.36s: Okay, last quiz question. What is the most important aspect of a strategy to get right?
4056.48s: Your day-to-day expiration, which is A, the option structure that you use in order to monetize
4063.68s: the idea, which is B, or your profit mechanism, which is C. What do you guys think the answer is A,
4069.44s: B, or C? I see one vote for C, two votes for C. Any other votes? I see another one for C. Good.
4087.36s: Does anybody think something other than C?
4090.64s: C? Kirk says B. Kirk, can you explain B? Why do you think it's B?
4106.16s: Mom doesn't say C. Good. So, the answer here by far is C. The most important aspect of a strategy
4117.44s: is the profit mechanism. But I want to explore with Kirk what he was thinking behind B.
4127.60s: Kirk says, Devil's Advocate, you can get the profit mechanism right, but use the wrong options
4133.76s: to profit from it. Yep, definitely. The more important factor, though, is that you can use the correct
4145.92s: option structure for the wrong profit mechanism and lose money. So, the same logic that's being
4155.44s: applied to C in that scenario would apply to B. It's not wrong, but like your original answer of B,
4167.92s: the reason why option structure is incorrect in this scenario and profit mechanism is correct.
4177.76s: Is actually for the same reason, but inverted. Let's take a look at a scenario where we think this stock
4187.84s: is going to go up. Let's say that it just had a breakout here and let's say that it was on strong
4194.32s: volume compared to the other days. We think it's going to go up. So, we have a upward bias.
4207.12s: For the subward bias, it doesn't really matter if we go synthetic long, if we go long equity,
4215.68s: if we go some sort of long call with some duration, you can buy a long call that loses money.
4225.52s: So, the strategy or the option structure still matters. It's not like which one of these doesn't matter.
4234.24s: They all matter, but it's what matters the most because if you understand the profit mechanism here of a breakout,
4242.24s: and you understand the profile of a breakout, which is over the next six days, you expect it to move
4248.96s: at least two times the prior reference period. So, let's say that the consolidation period itself
4257.28s: was a total range of 6%. So, over the next six days, you expect it to move at least 12%.
4264.40s: These details help you pick the structure that best fits this idea inherently.
4272.16s: And most importantly, is that if your profit mechanism is cracked, you still would make money
4280.40s: in effectively all of these scenarios, it just becomes a game of like how much money.
4286.96s: So, this is why profit mechanism is such a critical component of the strategy. It's literally the
4295.12s: base of any strategy. And that is because if you get your profit mechanism correct,
4304.32s: you can literally get everything else correct. So, if we look at the outlier strategy process,
4312.00s: your very first step is to create a profile for your profit mechanism. This is when we're talking
4318.24s: about in option strategy. Notice how the concept of structures doesn't even come
4328.72s: into plancil step three. It doesn't even get into the equation until here.
4340.40s: And it's because you have to understand the profit mechanism quite deeply, which is actually a
4347.52s: beautiful preamble to the second thing that I said that we were going to cover on the stream tonight,
4352.96s: which is where to go from here. I'm working on a new video that's going to come out hopefully in
4359.68s: the next, well, it's not going to come out for a little while because I have the backlog of videos,
4363.44s: but I'm hopefully going to make it in the next couple of weeks. And the the concept of the video is
4369.28s: to take pretty much all of the primary trading processes and to list them out so that we have
4378.40s: a comprehensive understanding of what all of the major processes are that go into trading.
4386.08s: The way that I would think about devising your next steps depending on where you're at in your path
4392.72s: is the first thing I would do is focus on outlining what you believe the major processes are
4404.24s: that you need to nail down as a trader. So let's just spit all some of them. One of those processes,
4412.80s: for sure, is fundamental knowledge, funds knowledge. And the purpose of this is to build your baseline
4427.20s: understanding of the tools that you're using. So a great part of this process is literally attending
4432.56s: the Friday dinner series, right? Like that is a way to hone your fundamental knowledge.
4439.76s: The other stuff that applies here are things like creating a feedback loop for your learning.
4450.40s: So let's say that you dedicate five hours a week to fundamental knowledge education of markets via
4457.84s: a split between books, podcasts, YouTube videos, whatever. And then once a week you have AI quiz you
4468.88s: that's a great way to build a quick and easy but very usable fundamental knowledge process.
4479.20s: Another process that you know that you need to come up with is a strategy process. And I already
4485.76s: have a video that talks about this. We just looked at the outline for the video. But this is how you
4492.48s: actually build stuff. Now there's a really big, granted step in the strategy process, which is
4502.48s: the profit mechanism profiling. You have to develop a process to profile profit mechanisms. You
4514.40s: have to have a process for this. The reason is it's very easy to get completely misled
4522.00s: when you're looking at stuff. So for example, if you're looking for a new strategy and your
4526.16s: approach to finding a new strategy, resolve revolves around like going on YouTube and typing in like
4532.88s: option strategy. That's not going to work well. That's just the reality of it. You're not going
4538.16s: to find a ton of gold there. The stuff that I share are things that are robust, but I'm not
4548.08s: sharing like any of my like really detailed nuanced stuff on fucking YouTube. And why would I?
4556.72s: The stuff that I'm sharing on YouTube are like the base concepts that work well that are in things
4563.36s: that are, again, well known. So I'm not sacrificing any of my edge by explaining different ways
4569.68s: to trade a coverage triangle in index ETFs. That doesn't eat any of my lunch at all. But some
4576.88s: of the more advanced stuff that I do, a great example of this is a trade that I made a couple of years
4582.72s: ago, which was the absolute most profitable trade on the account as a percentage basis in my
4590.72s: tire trading career. And it took place over two days. There's no content out there about that trade.
4597.92s: And there won't be any content out there about that trade because I'm not going to share it
4602.48s: because I'm still looking for it. What I'm trying to impress upon you is that you have to develop
4608.64s: a methodology to research profit mechanisms. And if your methodology revolves around just like going
4617.04s: on YouTube and seeing what you can find there, there's a huge, huge gap in that process.
4623.68s: And you need to take the time to iron it in. Or you guys iron it out.
4630.08s: This is the first step of your next steps after this series is to outline the different processes
4638.32s: that you think you need to develop in order to support your broader trading.
4644.72s: After that, the next hands down most important thing is to find a way to get external audits.
4656.40s: The reason for the external audits is when you're learning something, you absolutely do not know
4664.00s: what you do not know. So if your approach is going to be based on you thinking,
4669.76s: you know, you'll be able to do what you want and then magically make money doing it.
4678.08s: And you're not going to slip up or have different mistakes along the way. You really are in a
4685.52s: heavily disadvantaged position. Because again, the probability of you being able to identify
4693.92s: all of the different gaps in what you're doing is very low. It's super, super low.
4701.76s: So the last thing to think about is how do you develop a methodology to have an audit?
4710.80s: This can be meeting a friend from one of these streams that you sync up with once a week.
4720.64s: And you explain what you've been working on and you try to poke holes in what you're doing
4727.84s: and so on and so forth. These I think are the definite like near-term focus steps for everybody
4736.16s: in this series. This one is most important, which is outlining the different processes that you need to
4744.48s: and then beyond that, it's creating some sort of methodology for auditing.
4753.60s: And you have to have an audit process. That can again, that can be done via
4760.72s: chatchipyte, right? Like you can absolutely use whatever is at your disposal and you should.
4767.44s: So the trick there is it needs to be something that can catch up on spots.
4776.40s: Okay, so we're now going to pivot the last 15 minutes or so into just an open dialogue.
4785.28s: But before we pivot into an open dialogue, I just want to check to see if there's any questions
4792.48s: on anything that we went over, at least in the session today. So anything from the quiz
4799.84s: or anything from what you should be focusing on for your next steps.
4806.32s: Anything in there. And if so, knows the perfect time to throw that in. If not,
4812.48s: now is the perfect time to share any broader topics that you want to talk about.
4821.04s: We can cover anything that you think is relevant. So it can be stuff related to trading. It can
4826.88s: be stuff not trading related. Whatever you want to explore, there's a couple of things that are
4832.64s: on the top of my mind, depending on what you guys bring up. I actually want to give you an opportunity
4839.36s: to bring up stuff first. But I have a few things that I want to discuss broadly anyways.
4850.64s: Fire away if you have anything. The things that I think at least at this point that would make
4857.60s: a lot of sense for you guys to be thinking through is like, when you make this approach
4868.24s: and you move into attempting to trade for a living, there's a lot that goes into that. And I think
4876.88s: most people don't really go through the planning process well enough. So I want to talk about that.
4882.64s: Let me see. For instance, I placed a double diagonal on Boba for earnings for a $2.45
4888.64s: credit upfront. I closed at the next day for a 23 debit 93% gain of no idea how it worked.
4897.04s: What were the explorations for the diagonal?
4902.80s: Where did you have the long and short legs relative to one another?
4917.36s: Because realistically speaking, there's probably two big things that went down in that scenario
4925.84s: for you. The first thing, obviously, is the earnings move. The second thing is any sort of
4936.32s: follow-up price behavior. So if you take a look at Boba, Boba kind of just sat.
4943.36s: So the biggest thing that you had there working in your favor is the fact that volatility
4948.96s: contracted is much as it did. If you didn't get that kind of fall contraction, then you really
4957.68s: wouldn't have much to show for it. That's the biggest reason. Why you saw something
4970.08s: go down there.
4979.28s: Let's talk anything else on that frame before we look at anything else.
4991.84s: Brain says, front-exprie, expire that week, long strikes December, monthly expected move like.
5000.08s: So the reason why is because of fall. The long strikes out in December didn't really
5007.20s: realize much of a change involved because they're so far out. The majority of that profit
5012.96s: came from the short options in the front, effectively, expiring and by being within range.
5022.96s: So yeah, that's exactly what you had going on there.
5028.16s: Those kinds of trades are also interesting. I think in general, those kinds of trades can work
5043.44s: really, really well. But I also think in general, those are not necessarily getting you the direct
5053.68s: exposure that you want to the effect. Yeah, but that's exactly why you saw that move that you did there.
5065.68s: Anything else that you guys want to work through?
5086.48s: I want to talk a little bit about planning. And again, like feel free to throw in anything as we
5093.52s: go through this. But before you start going super far down the rabbit hole of like trading,
5101.20s: I think it makes a lot of sense to conduct a general planning process. And the purpose of the
5108.80s: planning process is to give you some sort of frameworks to work off of as you're learning.
5115.36s: So we just explained a bunch of different things that you have to outline through your homework next.
5121.04s: And as you're doing that, I highly recommend sharing it in the discord. It's free for everybody to
5126.24s: join. And most importantly, it's a good place to get feedback from people and to share ideas.
5135.04s: The main idea here is you have to balance a few things. You have to learn.
5143.84s: So this is a one-sided item that you have to do. The next thing along learning, you have to figure out
5158.24s: your execution approach. The way that you're going to execute will evolve as your learning.
5168.08s: And then your execution needs to be based on your goals.
5178.16s: So before you get too far into learning and before you get too far into the execution phase,
5186.96s: you have to develop solid goals. And I'll explain that in a second.
5190.88s: Blackelam says, Eric, when do you prefer leaps? I got leaps this dip in meta in Tesla.
5201.04s: I'm diversifying stocks. It's easier to sell the leaps than good stocks.
5209.12s: So leaps for me typically are when I want to have some sort of levered position in an underlying.
5218.80s: I actually am trading leaps way less than I used to.
5223.28s: And it's because a lot of my trading methodology has come in in time quite a lot.
5231.92s: And the duration that I'm holding these trades is quite a bit lower.
5248.48s: So my need to go out and to get leaps is decreased. And it's also a liquidity factor.
5256.00s: So if we take a look for example in Baba and we just eyeball what the liquidity looks like
5264.48s: across these different timeframes. If we go out let's say like 80, 90 days, summer and here,
5270.88s: you're about 50 cents wide for at the money. And then if we go out let's say to
5281.44s: 15 Jan 27, you can see that you're like $2.15 wide at the money.
5290.48s: That liquidity factor becomes a bit of an issue, especially when you're trading at size.
5297.28s: So I find in general I don't actually like to go into leaps quite as much because most of the stuff that I'm trading.
5306.80s: I'm not holding into perpetuity and you sacrifice a lot of the liquidity for options that you can scrub away.
5317.68s: Things like theta impact more easily. So that's the base.
5325.60s: Base thought process at least towards leaps.
5329.60s: I would prefer like most of my lungs based on my trading approach. Like if I'm trading ratio
5336.88s: called Agnals or stuff to the upside that way, bore up in the knot, I'm like 60 to 120 days out,
5344.64s: something like that.
5347.20s: Reses Pareto principle. My gains have come from core holdings. Basically when trading just
5353.28s: the chart, my results are meant. So I've been leading more into investor like who likes options.
5360.24s: That's okay. And I think in your scenario, one of the things to consider there is like probably
5367.04s: a gap in your profit mechanism research. Because if you're trading based on the chart that isn't
5374.88s: inherently bad, but it does require research to figure out how you want to trade the chart
5382.64s: in what makes sense. And from that lens, if you do a good amount of research, you can trade
5392.48s: absolutely successfully that general way. But if you don't do the corresponding research, it's really,
5400.72s: really difficult to trade that kind of methodology with any conviction. So if you find that it's more
5407.84s: effective for you to invest and use options for leverage or whatever, like I think that's completely
5413.44s: fine. The main note there is I would write off options or you know that trading methodology that
5420.72s: you're doing until you've done enough research to then objectively say like whether or not it should
5427.60s: be exonerated. Like one says, I want the shares. So I did a huge hit. I will exercise the shares
5436.32s: kind of the opposite of Casacir put, like, what? I want the shares. So I'd get a huge hit.
5446.00s: If wait, I will exercise the shares. Well, the thing is, like, if you have leaps, you don't want
5451.20s: to exercise them. Like that, I hope you already know because you're going to give up and insane
5457.68s: amount of extrinsic value. You will be light years better off just if I get a huge hit.
5465.92s: Oh, I see. I want the shares. So if I get a huge hit, I will exercise the shares. That's a massive mistake.
5475.44s: The reason is regardless of how big of a hit is that you get, you still are giving up a ton of
5484.96s: extrinsic value that you otherwise can capture by literally just selling the options and then buying
5490.48s: the shares. There's absolutely no benefit to exercising your call early. Other than,
5499.52s: like the vanity metric of liking the basis that you see better, but you're not giving up any profit
5507.28s: because you're realizing that profit that you would have on the basis otherwise. So here's effectively
5515.04s: how that would work. If we look at another scenario here,
5527.12s: and let's take a look at a deep in the money option. We're just in Boba, so I'll stay here.
5533.68s: And let's go to 15 Jan 27 and let's say that you have the 100's
5539.60s: and let's say that you got them for 65 10. It doesn't matter what the price is. So 65 10
5549.76s: is your 100 strike calls. The underlying right now is at 15730.
5558.56s: If we look at this scenario, we can easily see how far in the money,
5568.72s: your option is so we can break down your value. So you'll have intrinsic and then you'll have
5574.96s: extrinsic value in this option. Your intrinsic value is simply how far in the money, your
5585.92s: option is. So in this case, your option is 57 points in the money.
5593.92s: We don't want a percentage here. We want a dollar. So that's your intrinsic value.
5603.60s: I think I flipped them. Sorry. Oh no, it's just that the multiplied out. Your extrinsic value is
5611.92s: the remainder. So this minus this, that's how far in the money you are, which is 50
5622.96s: 730 and then your difference here is your extrinsic, which is 70 to 5 inches ahead of the split.
5631.28s: The issue is if I exercise my option, let's say the 100, what happens? It means I'm going to buy
5638.88s: to open 100 shares at 100 dollars. So the total amount of money that I'm going to have to put out
5650.40s: is 10 grand and the current unrealized P&L here is literally just your intrinsic value.
5663.68s: So it's how far in the money you are times your size.
5671.52s: That's your unrealized P&L. Let's take a look at what happens if instead you sell your option.
5685.52s: Again, depending on whatever you bought your option for P&L, we don't know yet. But if you
5692.48s: sell to clothes, your option, what you're doing is you're getting 6515.
5704.56s: Notice the difference in the P&L here. If I literally sell to clothes my option, I'm getting 6515.
5713.12s: If I exercise my option, I'm switching to an unrealized gain of 5730 and I'm getting rid of
5719.76s: all of my intrinsic value. So if I really wanted the shares for some reason, I would be light
5726.32s: years better off, literally selling to clothes the option and then buying to open the shares at
5734.08s: spot price, whatever that is. And it's because of the intrinsic value. When you exercise early,
5741.92s: you get rid of this, which you do not want to do. There's just no good reason to get rid of
5749.84s: the extrinsic, it's literally just throwing it away. There's no benefit to doing it whatsoever,
5756.48s: which is exactly why early exercise is so rare. You just don't see it that much. So
5764.48s: that is why that's typically not a good reason.
5769.28s: All right, gang. Absolutely awesome. Hang in out. I hope you guys enjoyed the mini series. If you
5775.68s: did, please feel free to share it with folks that are going through their learning process.
5780.08s: I try to do these to help folks. So you guys can help me do that by doing that. And I will be
5788.48s: traveling tomorrow, so not doing any streams and then we'll be back on schedule program comes
5795.04s: on day. So enjoy the rest of your weekend. Be an outlier. Take a closer look.
