0.48s: Paul tutor Jones is betting big on djt
3.92s: winning the election I actually got an
5.24s: email from somebody asking if I could
6.64s: take a look at djt and I'm always happy
9.44s: to take a peek at whatever you want me
10.96s: to that's kind of a a fun game of
13.60s: analyzing what you're interested in so I
16.92s: started looking through at a broad sense
18.92s: and there's a few things that I think we
20.16s: should talk about but this piece of news
22.16s: I actually think is kind of a a big
24.36s: component here now to be abundantly
26.00s: clear I really couldn't possibly care
28.36s: less about anybody's itical leanings my
31.08s: entire premise of that is you should do
33.32s: whatever is right for you now there is a
36.04s: reality though behind election impacts
38.56s: on the stock market and that is the lens
41.28s: I aim to talk about this through right
43.52s: now Camala Harris doesn't really have an
46.24s: ETF or a ticker that's largely
49.48s: associated with her and her brand like
51.92s: djt and Donald Trump has so that's why
54.64s: this is part of the conversation here if
56.80s: Cala did I would talk about that one as
59.00s: well but she does
60.80s: as it sits there are different ideas for
63.32s: whether or not a republican wins or a
65.00s: Democrat wins in terms of what's likely
67.96s: to move in terms of sectors but those
70.80s: are more just generalized less precise
73.72s: tools this is a really interesting
76.08s: scenario that quite literally there is a
78.20s: stock that is directly tied to one of
80.32s: the presidential candidates and it gives
82.64s: us an opportunity to essentially price
85.44s: probabilities along with prediction
87.48s: markets which we're going to take a look
88.68s: at as well
90.76s: so as looking through the news to get
93.16s: myself started I thought this was really
95.76s: fascinating so from here this is from
98.56s: 1108 today Pacific time and this is a
102.60s: conversation this is from market watch
105.08s: and it says another billionaire investor
107.84s: positions for Trump when he's placing
110.36s: inflation trades so let's read through
113.04s: this together legendary investor Paul
115.36s: tutor Jones said Tuesday he's moved his
117.72s: portfolio in the direction of a Vic by
120.36s: Donald Trump in the five no presidential
122.88s: election but warned of a potential
125.40s: Reckoning over auring US debt pile
128.68s: regardless of the Victor this has been
130.36s: in more and more conversations debt
132.60s: right now is exceedingly high it's liter
134.72s: like we the US has debt through our ears
137.16s: and spending is still very high again
139.40s: not looking to get political simply just
141.52s: looking at numbers and th those are the
143.32s: facts we have a pile of debt so Jones
146.88s: goes on to say I have moved in that
149.40s: direction for sure and he has a massive
153.48s: following in the markets he's one of the
154.88s: brightest Minds um in the eyes of most
157.44s: people and he says um if he had
161.52s: repositioned for a potential Victory by
163.48s: Trump the Republican nominee over vice
165.96s: president Kamala Harris the Democratic
167.72s: candidate candidate it just means more
170.32s: inflation trades so that I actually find
174.64s: really interesting you could see that
176.16s: their long gold long Bitcoin and still
179.84s: believes that they're very very much
181.56s: undervalued here which if we take a look
184.08s: gold is actually still hovering highs so
186.84s: it's interesting to see uh this
189.40s: perspective here so let's continue on
192.36s: reading it says uh the bigger question
194.12s: Joe said is whether there will be some
196.72s: point of recognition particularly with
198.56s: all the tax cuts that are being promised
200.40s: by both sides and the spending plans he
202.80s: noted that the US government debt has
204.72s: grown from 40% of GDP to nearly 100% in
209.12s: 25 years
210.28s: and appears to be on an unsustainable
213.60s: trajectory so yeah this positioning um
218.12s: conversation by Paul tutor Jones is
221.88s: really really interesting and here's
223.40s: another big thing again for anybody
225.04s: that's interested in um the the latest
227.52s: on this I saw this going through but it
228.80s: looks like Trump is going to go on Joe
230.28s: Rogan on
232.52s: Friday and let's take a look now at
236.20s: what's been going on with the ticker
237.64s: itself we can see that implied
239.76s: volatility percentile is very high so
242.24s: there's essentially 86% so most days are
245.68s: lower than where it is today implied
247.80s: volatility I am a complete buffoon in
250.68s: case you were wondering this is really
252.36s: great metrics for um for gold but we
256.40s: actually don't care about gold I don't
257.84s: think I was wondering as soon as I got
259.60s: to the implied volatility and I saw it
261.04s: at 17% I was like uh-uh something's
263.56s: wrong here this is better
266.32s: 300% Ah that's yeah this is this is the
269.40s: stuff we're talking about so implied
271.28s: volatility percentile not in Gold but in
273.56s: djt is actually 98% where 247 days or
277.88s: lower so this is pretty elevated we can
280.84s: see IV right now is over
282.48s: 300% and 5day average daily range is 9.3
286.64s: 5day average true range 8.47 so overall
291.28s: pretty pretty profound movements and
294.04s: it's been on an absolute tear it's gone
296.24s: from 17 and 3/4 on the 24th of September
301.12s: and it's essentially cracking highs here
303.72s: uh term highs almost on this three-month
305.56s: chart coming right up to 34 in change so
309.32s: volume is being bit up heavily although
311.68s: volume is starting to slow down the 5day
314.72s: average volume as it sits today is 42.3
318.04s: MIL 20-day is 34.8 mil and today's
321.80s: volume is 55 mil so still definitely
324.00s: exceeding all those averages you can see
326.28s: volatility has just been climbing this
328.60s: is always interesting when volatility is
330.52s: climbing as the stock is going up that's
332.76s: not normal normally when the stock is
335.28s: going up appreciating and value
336.64s: volatility will contract but this just
338.56s: means that the market has no idea which
341.64s: way this thing can snap upside or
344.00s: downside that's why we're seeing
345.32s: volatility move as it is uh in relation
348.24s: to it which is also very interesting now
351.24s: to take a quick peek at Poly market and
355.00s: to take a look at the presidential
356.40s: election if we pop into here we can see
358.88s: what the probability sit as it sits
360.80s: today and it's showing probability of
363.28s: trump winning is
364.52s: 64% against Kamala at
367.56s: 35.8 so call it
369.72s: 36% Ki another Market is showing 61% by
375.20s: 39% so uh again these kind of
377.84s: discrepancies actually are tradable for
379.60s: cross exchange Arbitrage but the bigger
382.92s: note here is that it's clear um at least
385.56s: as it sits today that Trump is generally
387.88s: favored this is looking at Nevada but
390.52s: funny enough it actually is the same
392.60s: here this rotates by the way that's why
396.40s: um that's why I started reading notics
399.12s: it moved on me but it's the same anyways
402.08s: which is kind of
403.16s: interesting so he definitely is favorite
405.68s: and then for anybody that's interested
407.76s: this is a really cool um Norse music
411.08s: band This is called wardruna they're I
413.28s: like them a lot I just realized that
414.56s: that song is on that tab I listen to
415.96s: music a lot while I work um but great
418.16s: song so anyways let's take a look at the
420.92s: options Market here because djt has been
424.96s: I mean literally flying off the shelf
427.12s: and there's a lot of people that have
428.60s: been speculating and here now you can
430.28s: see a lot of people are actually trading
431.88s: the downside now djt is interesting this
434.96s: actually offers an opportunity to trade
436.88s: a couple different ideas because if you
439.08s: think Trump is going to win you might go
441.24s: long the stock market and short djt is a
444.88s: hedge one of the ways that you can play
447.32s: uh a pretty large position but Hedge
449.52s: your risk so that you don't get blown
450.92s: out now I also think that there's got to
453.36s: be an expectation of a pullback at some
455.40s: point because again if we take a look at
457.76s: this this is a absolutely massive
459.72s: massive run and sooner or later the you
462.28s: know music stops so it doesn't wouldn't
464.80s: surprise me at all to see if that's part
467.28s: of what's being priced in here so we're
469.72s: seeing 388,000 calls against 468,000
474.12s: puts and a good bit of them are 15 nove
477.88s: I don't think that's a big surprise the
479.60s: are literally to play the election so
481.84s: 156,000 calls against 160 on the put
484.84s: side and again so you can tell most of
487.32s: the oi is centered around the election
491.04s: period itself so a couple other things
494.24s: of note is if we take a look at the
496.08s: implied VA for the out of the monies you
499.04s: can see that this thing is all over the
501.64s: place let's clean it up look at 15 nove
503.68s: and8 no specifically and spot price as
507.72s: it sits right now it was up what 99.87%
510.56s: today it's sitting at
512.68s: 3440 and I mean right now VA is a little
516.52s: bit rich on the put side compared to the
518.48s: call side so the put side's being priced
521.32s: a little more heavily than the call side
523.48s: so yeah really really interesting spot
525.84s: here now in terms of expectations as
527.64s: always really really hard to say this is
529.84s: going to be a very news driven thing so
532.76s: it's not like you can value djt as a
536.92s: company as a stock and try to think
539.04s: about what but its earnings are going to
540.44s: be or stuff like that is literally being
542.20s: served as a proxy for Trump winning the
544.20s: election as it sits now which is kind of
546.08s: crazy so if you're thinking about trying
548.12s: to Value this or play this just know
549.84s: that you're really just playing those
552.08s: expectations and as those expectations
554.24s: oscillate leading into the election this
556.40s: is going to continue moving so but right
559.60s: now it looks like uh people are
561.96s: positioning definitely for an election
564.16s: play here we'll see how it goes let me
565.96s: know which way you think that this is
567.24s: going to go because I don't know it's a
569.44s: a coin flip to me always interesting
571.88s: though lots lots of IV let me know if
574.44s: you need want me to look at anything or
575.80s: if you need anything hit me up in the
577.00s: Discord be an outlier I'll see youall
578.32s: later
