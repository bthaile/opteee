0.76s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.44s: two things on the agenda first we have
5.00s: Visa with its new antitrust lawsuit
8.36s: coming out which we'll talk about
9.52s: quickly and then we're going to take a
11.64s: look at you meaning Unity because
16.56s: there's a lot of talk about some trades
19.24s: flowing in that are of interesting size
22.16s: meaning 5,000 lot options trades this
25.64s: actually popped up earlier for me today
28.76s: and I think it's kind of interesting to
31.12s: keep an eyeball on so let's start with
35.08s: Visa what's going on here well it's
38.84s: pretty straightforward so you can see
40.96s: that the justice department accuses Visa
43.40s: of stifling competition in the debit
46.36s: card business so why does this matter
50.32s: well it
52.04s: essentially shows that the justice
55.56s: department is starting to attack some of
58.64s: these perceived monopolies I don't
61.48s: exactly want to go as far as to call it
63.48s: as a monopoly but you can see that Visa
65.84s: controls more than 60% of debit card
69.00s: processing and this is one of the really
72.08s: interesting factors that go into a
75.52s: economy and overall capitalistic
77.88s: structure like we have here is where is
80.56s: that line drawn between letting good
83.08s: businesses grow and Thrive versus good
86.80s: businesses being given excess advantages
89.52s: that then allow them to dominate a
92.24s: landscape and it's a really interesting
94.40s: discussion to be had but we can see here
98.24s: it says Visa handles more than 60% of
100.12s: debit card transactions and collects
101.64s: more than 7 billion in annual processing
105.44s: fees and it uses its Market power to
108.88s: stifle competition which again in a
111.04s: capitalistic society that doesn't
113.08s: necessarily surprise me and it says we
115.88s: alleg that Visa has unlawfully amassed
118.64s: the power to extract fees that far
120.24s: exceed what it could charge in a
121.72s: competitive market and this is kind of
123.88s: the interesting balance between
125.92s: regulation and free capitalistic Society
128.92s: it's not an easy answer and I'm not here
131.20s: to weigh in on it I'm here just to show
132.84s: you what it says it says uh merchants
135.40s: and Banks pass along those costs to
138.08s: Consumers right pass through costs
140.68s: either by raising prices or reducing
142.72s: quality of service to decrease the cost
144.52s: it makes to make it so this essentially
146.84s: is alleging that Visa's conduct
150.64s: um ultimately impacts the consumer and
153.60s: that this is spread into just about
155.36s: everything now what I find slightly
157.40s: interesting here is if we take a look at
160.52s: this and I'm not super positive on this
163.80s: Source I'm just looking for some numbers
166.84s: um and it says essentially in
169.20s: 2021 we can see credit card purchase
172.64s: volume is like 52 and a
174.36s: half% so that's actually meaning that
177.32s: there's a pretty significant amount of
181.52s: debit card transactions that happen and
184.64s: I just find that generally interesting
186.08s: because that really bolsters this
187.80s: argument that there's a pretty
189.92s: significant Market here that Visa is
191.84s: looking to dominate so we can see that
194.08s: Merchants are on board because obviously
196.12s: they just pass through the cost anyway
197.84s: they generally don't care and it says
200.64s: Tuesday's lawsuit is not the first time
202.40s: Visa's run a foul of the justice
204.28s: department four years ago the government
206.48s: suit to block visa from acquiring a
208.40s: fintech company plaid which most of us
210.24s: are familiar with and it says it viewed
212.68s: the 5.3 billion takeover as an insurance
214.76s: policy to prevent plaid from infringing
216.64s: on its lucrative debt debit
218.56s: card and again that's the this is
221.76s: something that we saw through Facebook
223.52s: previously now meta that they used to
226.08s: literally buy companies and just nuke
228.68s: the company to get rid of the
230.28s: competition and again it's really hard
232.36s: to say in a theoretical standpoint if
235.08s: that's good if that's bad if that is
237.20s: capitalistic if it's not if there should
239.16s: be regulation
240.32s: and these are the arguments that are
241.88s: going to be had by people have different
243.52s: opinions but what I can tell you is that
248.08s: there is a tradable event here so we now
250.96s: have Visa that is down 5.5% today big
256.04s: big big sale volume and we can see that
259.04s: it was doing great right before this
260.72s: news and the way that this is going to
263.36s: work now is volatility is already
265.80s: started to creep up we can see impli
267.68s: volatility percentile is now at 81% % so
270.72s: for me I look at it very simply is how
273.20s: can I trade this right again theoretical
275.72s: existential conversations decide about
277.40s: what we think is right or wrong
278.92s: completely different that's a different
280.56s: part of my brain this part of my brain
282.16s: is like how do we trade this and there's
283.92s: lots of ways to trade it now we can
285.68s: trade a directional move here assuming
288.00s: that this move might continue or
290.88s: depending on how it behaves over the
292.32s: next day or so we can see if it starts
293.88s: to rebound and rally right back up so
297.20s: this could be a buy the rumor sell the
300.52s: news kind of scenario we don't know just
303.44s: yet but what I can tell you is that
306.04s: catalysts like this offer interesting
308.60s: opportunities so I'm keeping a really
310.68s: close eye on this to see how it
312.56s: materializes I wouldn't trade it on a
314.16s: day like today other than intraday
315.80s: following it but we have to see how all
317.80s: this is digested and then the Market's
319.44s: perception of essentially what will
321.00s: happen here which is TBD obviously so
324.20s: now if we take a quick look at the
325.72s: options change just out of
327.40s: curiosity we can see a few things
330.44s: we can see volume on the put side
332.48s: definitely expanded today and you can
334.92s: see that a lot of it were people buying
336.88s: puts 22% came in and rightfully so
340.16s: scooping up the downside opportunity
341.76s: they're playing the 20 expiration that's
343.92s: where all this volume was today it's
345.20s: people hedging existing positions it's
346.88s: people gaining exposure to play it to
348.68s: the downside but here's what I want to
351.08s: see is how much this call put oi starts
354.72s: to change because it's been maintaining
356.72s: call skew I track Visa pretty regularly
359.36s: and this is its normal configuration
361.48s: where it's pretty bullish in terms of
363.24s: the options chain but we can see that
365.12s: it's starting to get a little bit more
366.96s: interesting and what I found even more
369.72s: interesting is that if we take a look at
371.96s: some of these net change day over day on
375.44s: this three well previously it would have
377.80s: been four DTE yesterday when these were
379.68s: added can't help but notice there's some
382.32s: pretty good ads here I see 1,700
386.88s: contracts that were added at the 285
388.92s: puts 8 00 this is from yesterday to
391.76s: today this isn't accounting for today
393.40s: into tomorrow so there's some people
396.76s: that had an idea of what's going on
399.64s: which is always entertaining to see got
402.16s: to be honest with you love that about
403.92s: options markets though is that people
405.80s: that have leverage want to express an
408.00s: idea and people who typically are
410.44s: informed seek leverage because then they
412.72s: can express an idea and make more money
414.88s: good old greed you know it never goes
417.56s: out of style so that's that
420.68s: next up we have
422.64s: youu and youu is something I'm not super
426.60s: tied into this is maybe something that
428.56s: we need to spend a little bit more time
430.00s: on during the mem stock trading live
433.12s: stream tomorrow later today is the
435.16s: outlier Pro live stream but this one is
438.56s: interesting just because it popped up on
441.04s: a few scans that I tend to run and it's
444.00s: had really interesting Behavior so if we
445.92s: look at volume today it's had insane in
449.64s: insane call volume
452.20s: 262,000 calls traded against 37
456.52s: 36,400 puts not even able to round that
459.36s: up in good faith so massive massive call
462.40s: volume today and if we look at the open
464.36s: interest it has massive call oi versus
467.28s: put oi so these are people that are just
469.96s: loading up full port upside 36% of the
474.08s: calls transacted today
475.84s: 36% were at the offer or above this is
479.52s: people that are expressing a directional
481.28s: opinion using calls leverage that's
483.64s: exactly what's going on here
486.04s: then if we take a look here we see this
489.72s: if I look over the last couple days I
492.84s: look at yesterday and today in you and
495.36s: I'm looking at calls that were purchased
497.56s: at the offer or above and I'm looking
500.36s: for single leg trades only not looking
502.48s: for spreads what do we see well we see a
505.56s: few blocks of 5,000 rolling in and again
508.68s: the reason why this is is always topical
510.24s: is because folks immediately want to tie
513.04s: 5,000 blocks to Roaring Kitty and it's
515.68s: because of you know what happened in gme
518.60s: come the summer of this year and so I
521.84s: understand why that speculation tends to
523.72s: arrive and it's really interesting
526.04s: though because we see those 5,000 blocks
529.48s: at a couple different strikes over a few
531.88s: different days that part I genuinely do
535.52s: find interesting so if I sort these
537.20s: instead by premium if I sort them by
538.92s: time really quick we can see that
542.00s: throughout the day there's a bunch of
543.76s: small trades right 10,000 20,000 2,000
548.28s: tons of these smaller trades that don't
551.12s: really mean that much to us but then if
553.76s: we sort it by premium all of a sudden we
555.72s: see that we get these blocks of 5,000
559.36s: that drift up to the top we can see them
561.20s: starting on the 23rd for sure and there
563.64s: were a few tranches so I see 1257 1259
567.92s: from yesterday the 23rd 12 54 1252 and
572.04s: this is at the 15 the 20 and then I see
575.60s: the 20 and the 20 so it looks like
577.96s: somebody getting exposure to a few
580.32s: different spots here but if we look at
582.28s: the dollar value on these all of a
583.92s: sudden we are massively sized we've gone
586.84s: from looking at stuff that's a few 10
589.24s: thousands of dollars to a couple that
592.16s: are hundreds of thousands a couple half
594.80s: a million dollar trades and then all of
596.40s: a sudden we have trades that are several
598.88s: million
600.00s: do this is not a small position that's
602.68s: all there is to it and this looks like
606.16s: at least two different positions being
608.20s: built so we can see some of the 15s that
610.88s: are being built out in 2025 and then we
613.84s: can see some that are being built out in
616.36s: 15 no 24 that's what these are so
619.64s: whether or not that's the same person
620.92s: different person again it's a crapshoot
622.56s: really really difficult to tell but what
624.60s: I can tell you is that these 15s are
628.52s: being hit in a few different spots
630.84s: because I see the 15s here on 17 Jan 25
634.44s: I see the 15s here on 15 no 24 and then
638.00s: I see the 15s here on again 17 Jan 25
641.88s: and then I see the 15s with a slightly
643.68s: smaller trade out in 25 again and then
646.28s: if I look at the 20s we see them in 25
651.32s: here we see them 15 nove 24 25 again so
656.28s: this is kind of a a split of different
657.92s: things now for people people that think
660.12s: that this is roaring Kitty again I don't
662.76s: blame you for thinking and who knows who
664.24s: it could be but I do highly recommend
667.60s: check out the series that we've been
669.00s: doing on Saturday the GameStop series
671.08s: because I literally started going what
673.52s: three weeks ago we went all the way back
676.20s: and we're right now still in the process
677.76s: of it the next one is this coming
678.92s: Saturday where we are literally going
681.12s: trade by trade to see what he did when
684.80s: what the market looked like what he did
686.64s: all the way back to the very beginning
687.88s: of his Reddit profile the reason is I
689.84s: call it fingerprinting it lets me get an
692.88s: understanding of how something looks
694.48s: behaves that's unique to that thing in
696.76s: this case that thing being our boy
699.44s: roaring Kitty so while this could be the
702.36s: cat I don't instinctually see him here
704.88s: based on what I've seen him do
706.16s: previously meaning when I've seen him
708.52s: establish and change previous positions
710.56s: it's not across a bunch of different
711.88s: expirations across a bunch of different
713.28s: strikes from what I've seen he tends to
715.88s: layer into something and then when he
718.32s: wants to add more exposure he'll layer
720.04s: into something else but this is all with
721.84s: the giant caveat we're not done yet
723.76s: right now like I said in that series I
725.28s: think we're still in we're at the end or
728.32s: the be the end of 21 or the beginning of
730.48s: 2022 so we're getting there but we still
733.20s: have a ways to go but all I'm saying is
734.92s: this looks a little bit different than
736.76s: what I've seen so far does that mean it
738.44s: can't be him of course not it could be
740.20s: does that mean that every time we see
741.92s: 5,000 lot trades that it is him also
745.24s: absolutely not there are there's a human
747.92s: tendency to use round numbers you'll see
751.40s: things like this this is a bigger trade
752.92s: for sure but you'll see 5,000 blocks
756.00s: 2500 blocks 10,000 blocks those are just
759.36s: instinctual numbers that people use when
761.64s: you're trading at larger sizes so if you
765.24s: decide that you're going to put on a
766.20s: bigger position that's worth a few
767.48s: million million dollars you're kind of
768.84s: backed into a a trade right like a
771.88s: standard sizing most people are not
774.08s: coming in to put in a trade that's you
775.96s: know
777.84s: 1,526 it's going to be a round number
780.08s: more often than not that's why if we
782.28s: take a look at these strikes in unity
784.72s: you'll notice the same thing I try to
786.20s: draw your I to pretty frequently where
788.20s: if we go to these round number strikes
790.96s: they're almost always more active than
794.28s: other strikes in terms of open interest
796.76s: and that's because of this very natural
798.44s: tendency so for example if I look at
800.48s: these 25 calls in 18 o there's 11,900 of
805.40s: them then if I go to the 30s round
808.04s: number there's 4 47,000 of them then if
811.24s: I go into the 20s round number again
813.84s: kind of moving in $5 Lots here there's
816.32s: 11,000 of them so even though there's
818.92s: options that are much better closer to
820.64s: the money like these they're still
822.60s: smaller size than something like the 20s
824.88s: or the 25s or the 30s human tendency
827.52s: you'll see this all the time in options
829.12s: markets so I would always say approach
832.08s: things with an open mind who knows
833.36s: what's happening but also understand the
835.56s: landscape and this kind of thing is very
837.80s: very normal so we got to see what going
839.32s: on with you though because it is
841.52s: definitely starting to get a bit of legs
844.80s: underneath it we'll take a closer look
846.28s: at it tomorrow during the live stream as
848.08s: always anything you want me to take a
849.28s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
850.76s: see youall later
