0.74s: zero DTE SPX spreads these are a
4.20s: strategy I've tested for a really long
6.06s: time and here are three super common
9.48s: mistakes when it comes to them and some
12.66s: ways we can overcome them what's up
14.40s: everybody Eric here welcome back to all
16.44s: the outliers and we were talking about a
18.66s: super common strategy today a lot of
20.34s: people I know like to trade the strategy
21.90s: myself included but there are some
24.18s: really really common errors people make
25.92s: so first let's get a quick Baseline on
29.04s: what this strategy is the zero DTE SPX
32.94s: strategies there's a ton of different
35.34s: forms and Fashions of them sometimes
38.10s: people will trade short strangles
40.14s: sometimes they will trade short
41.70s: straddles sometimes short iron Condors
44.40s: that are far out of the money so on and
47.04s: so forth there's a lot of variations and
49.20s: I'm not going into all of them today
50.88s: what I do want to talk about today
53.70s: are some of the more common variations
55.86s: and the issues with them so one of the
58.74s: most common variations I've seen is
60.96s: essentially a short wide far out of the
64.92s: money iron Condor so what that looks
67.20s: like is if I come over to the trade tab
69.00s: I typically would see a zero DTE
72.42s: obviously it's the weekend right well
74.16s: now obviously you would know that I know
75.90s: that today is the 23rd of October it's
77.76s: Sunday so there's no zero DTE right now
80.70s: but normally there would be so let's
83.04s: just pretend that this one DTE is
85.80s: actually zero DTE we would pop this open
87.96s: and then a lot of people go super far
90.84s: out of the money for the short option so
92.82s: let's start with the put side and let's
94.98s: say we go to this 10 Delta far out of
97.98s: the money short put and then you would
99.66s: buy and even further out of the money
103.68s: um long put essentially to create a
105.78s: hedge now
107.40s: there's a couple big issues with this
110.46s: the first one is the use of spreads in
113.52s: my opinion is an inefficient way to
117.06s: trade this strategy what is this
118.86s: strategy anyways why do we trade it in
121.62s: short what we're attempting to do is
123.84s: harvest the volatility risk premium and
127.68s: what that means is if I zoom in on a
130.86s: slightly shorter time period and we look
132.84s: down at this weird looking series of
134.82s: lines I am charting out implied
138.48s: volatility versus historic volatility
140.72s: that is the entire purpose of the zero
145.20s: DTE strategies is we are attempting to
148.74s: trade the typical overstatement of
151.86s: implied volatility to Historic
153.72s: volatility the problem is we are making
157.92s: the assumption that implied volatility
159.96s: is high relative to Historic volatility
163.44s: that is why we sell premium in these
165.66s: strategies the big problem problem is if
168.42s: you're trading a spread okay we're
170.88s: selling the volatility in this 10 Delta
174.30s: short put but then we're buying the very
178.32s: same volatility that we think is
180.84s: overpriced
182.46s: that's the first problem people are
185.28s: uncomfortable taking risk so they seek
187.86s: to hedge out this risk using spreads
190.50s: like this and that is an issue because
192.90s: you are literally contradicting the
195.00s: entire trade hypothesis that you're
196.56s: starting with now to be abundantly clear
198.90s: that is not to suggest that all spreads
202.32s: like this vertical spreads or Condors
204.66s: are immediately contradictory in nature
207.00s: for some people they will use that far
210.36s: out of the money Wing just as a way to
212.88s: hedge Black Swan risk no problem if we
216.90s: want to do that let's use some data to
219.66s: inform our decision cycle and what I
221.52s: mean by that is maybe we only do it on
224.76s: the put side because markets tend to
227.46s: move down much lower far more
230.16s: aggressively than they do to the upside
232.38s: so if that's our concern instead of just
235.68s: automatically doing some sort of condor
237.66s: maybe we only do it on the put side
240.18s: where the risk typically lays but for me
244.32s: more frequently than not I would prefer
246.60s: just to use short straddles or short
248.94s: strangles typically a short straddle is
250.86s: better off in my opinion next one
253.46s: non-discerning entry this is the most
255.54s: important one out of this list I put it
257.34s: number two in case you want to jump ship
259.56s: early which you shouldn't you should
260.94s: stay to the end because the last one's
262.56s: actually really interesting in
264.42s: conjunction with the first one but let's
266.82s: talk about the second one
268.70s: non-discerning entry if I look at these
271.32s: different lines you'll notice I have a
272.82s: bright yellow a dark yellow and then a
274.86s: white the white line is implied
276.60s: volatility and then the historic
278.76s: volatility that's more pertinent to this
280.56s: conversation is this brighter yellow
282.30s: which is the 30 day now you you'll
285.12s: notice there are periods of time where
288.54s: the actual historic volatility is
292.32s: greater than the implied volatility so
296.16s: if we simply just every single day trade
299.64s: this strategy you are indiscerningly of
303.24s: throwing out something that's supposed
304.92s: to capitalize on a specific environment
308.04s: and some of those environments it
310.44s: doesn't
311.34s: so we need to pay close attention to the
314.28s: relationship between implied volatility
316.50s: and historic volatility again based on
318.42s: the time frames that you're trading but
320.34s: this entire strategy is predicated on
322.80s: implied volatility typically being
324.42s: slightly overstated compared to Historic
326.22s: volatility so if you just randomly wheel
328.50s: this strategy all the time because it's
330.06s: the only thing you know you are using
332.40s: the strategy in periods of time where it
334.68s: actually doesn't make sense so you've
338.04s: got to pay attention to that okay the
340.02s: last one is some people do this really
342.42s: interesting thing where we kind of
344.28s: combine both of these entities meaning
346.38s: we use spreads to spread off our risk
349.50s: but then we also put stops on those
352.02s: spreads
353.28s: the problem with this is as soon as you
357.12s: start integrating stops into this kind
359.64s: of strategy the numbers change
361.86s: significantly and I know what you're
364.08s: saying Eric I've seen it back tested it
366.90s: looks great the problem with back tests
369.60s: on strategies like this is they miss
371.70s: things like slippage they're not super
375.06s: specific to the strategy as it is and
377.76s: again unless we get very very pointed
380.70s: with our back testing to include periods
384.00s: where implied volatility actually is
386.52s: overstated compared to when it's not
388.74s: using stops on these spreads essentially
392.04s: kneecaps the strategy you are trying to
394.80s: capture a variance in volatility but
397.92s: then you're not giving the trade the
400.08s: space it needs to move and I've actually
401.76s: done videos dissecting this more in
403.98s: detail but the fact of the matter is
406.82s: stops on spreads again not saying it's
410.04s: always the wrong answer but you got to
412.08s: look really carefully at what's
413.28s: happening to the expectancy of the
415.86s: strategy what ends up happening with
418.32s: this kind of setup more often than not
421.02s: especially if it's coupled with all
423.90s: three of these in conjunction with one
426.18s: another is we run into a scenario where
428.70s: we are taking a lot of very small
431.40s: profits and we're taking fewer big
435.00s: losses but those losses tend to
438.00s: overwhelm the majority of those frequent
440.94s: small profits so it's not as simple as
443.64s: set this strategy up because you saw it
445.44s: somewhere Run and Gun and you'll make a
447.48s: bunch of money
448.56s: there's more to it than that and if
451.02s: you've been trading for any period of
452.58s: time you probably guessed that because
454.86s: far more frequently than not things tend
458.04s: to be a little deeper as you peel back
460.88s: especially this second one if you were
463.68s: trading this kind of strategy and you
465.48s: don't actually have a volatility Edge
467.46s: you are literally hoping and that is a
471.12s: awful strategy to make money in the
472.80s: markets so a couple things to keep in
474.78s: mind there is obviously some ways you
477.18s: can circumnavigate these different
478.80s: issues that I've listed out but the name
482.10s: of the game is optimize the strategy and
484.80s: become Discerning this is not just to
487.38s: throw it out all the time because it's
489.00s: mechanical the issue is if you've
491.58s: blindly followed something mechanically
493.38s: you you step into periods exactly like
496.14s: this that don't make any sense for the
498.60s: strategy to be deployed so if you made
501.18s: it to the end make sure you like And
502.92s: subscribe to the channel share your
504.42s: thoughts with me especially if you use
506.16s: the strategy I'm curious how it's worked
508.20s: out for you and until next time be an
510.18s: outlier see y'all later
