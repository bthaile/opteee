0.56s: made a little over 30 Grand in Tesla
3.04s: over the last couple days but I also
5.36s: made a couple mistakes so I want to talk
7.64s: about how I played this position so far
11.40s: and more importantly talk about the
14.08s: benefits and drawbacks about some of my
16.76s: trading strategies I'm way more
19.04s: interested in identifying the issues
21.96s: with what I'm doing as compared to
23.64s: padding myself on the back and saying oh
25.44s: yeah you made some money it's a longterm
28.12s: game so the goal is is to walk you
31.00s: through the ratio called diagonal that I
33.04s: set up in the trade how I found it all
35.04s: those kinds of details because we had a
37.68s: question from the Discord our good
39.48s: friend gooc said uh when exactly and why
43.72s: did you put the ratio call diagonal on
46.80s: in Tesla this is from our Discord and I
49.56s: post about some of my stuff that I do
51.24s: once in a while in there and that's what
53.52s: they're asking about and then the
55.24s: following questions is you know what
56.92s: indicators chart patterns make you take
58.72s: a shot those kinds of things and we'll
60.48s: talk about that now the context for
63.04s: their question specifically is
65.00s: completely different I actually think
66.72s: and as I mentioned in the Discord with
68.44s: them I I could write them an entire
69.96s: blueprint of what I did and it doesn't
71.56s: matter they have to go through their own
72.96s: process which I think they're aware of
74.40s: now but I still think that there's
77.04s: benefit to sharing ideas how we look at
79.48s: things so that you can fully integrate
81.04s: because this is all going back to this
82.32s: part here where it says I'm not very
84.04s: good at identifying opportunities you
85.80s: can't look at just the good ones and say
87.44s: how did you find that good one because
89.36s: there's thousand thousands of bad ones I
90.84s: come across and I lose trades all the
92.52s: time so there's a bit of an art and
95.88s: science that goes into this game of
98.20s: trading and there's a lot of different
100.04s: things that have to come together and
101.80s: like I said even in this trade I made a
104.36s: few mistakes and I want to talk about
106.52s: those aspects of the position so to
109.52s: start working through this question
111.08s: though let's dive into it the first
114.00s: thing is how did we find the opportunity
117.88s: it's pretty simple and it's simple and
120.68s: complex at the same time I'm going to
122.32s: actually move myself out of the way so
124.12s: it's easier for you to see and let's
125.16s: talk about it there are a lot of things
128.52s: that draw my interest in markets and
132.72s: it's very rarely one single thing that
135.92s: leads me to a yay or nay it's more often
139.16s: than not what I consider a Confluence of
142.16s: evidence a total picture of what I see
145.88s: going on and then my probabilistic
148.28s: assessment of this scenario
151.16s: so when I'm playing something like this
154.00s: there's no part of me that's like oh
155.80s: yeah this is made money this is good I'm
158.20s: great I don't necessarily think that but
161.12s: here's how I found it I had saw Tesla
165.44s: had broken up out of this little
168.60s: rangeb action here on this day the 26th
173.20s: so that immediately Drew my eye and part
176.56s: of that was catching that it had
179.00s: slightly elevated than average volume
181.84s: mostly buying volume that's what I saw
184.92s: so that gets added to a watch list it
187.32s: just means I'm going to keep an eyeball
188.96s: on it see how it does I'm curious now
191.52s: the next day I see it Trend a little bit
193.08s: sideways nothing too noteworthy it looks
195.44s: like it wants to start breaking out okay
197.44s: we still just watch it volume pulls back
199.48s: a little bit then the next day I see
201.68s: volume come up pretty heavy but a lot of
203.88s: sale volume it's hanging around these
206.16s: levels it just broke above the 200 day
208.80s: ma now I'm even more interested I see
213.00s: the moving averages starting to take
215.56s: these really aggressive slopes that
218.64s: happens when things are making big moves
221.36s: and you need things to have strong
224.32s: powerful volume to make these kinds of
227.28s: moves so then next on the first
232.28s: yesterday I looked down and I see that
234.88s: it's breaking above these levels now I
237.20s: know that there's a trade here it's a
240.56s: what I would call a very speculative
242.04s: trade I don't know where it's going to
243.20s: go but in my weighing of probabilistic
246.44s: outcomes I see something that's gaining
249.28s: a lot of very shortterm heavy heavy
253.04s: support it's starting to show a lot of
256.40s: volume and early in the day it had much
259.24s: higher than average volume so then I end
262.52s: up entering a position on the first and
265.64s: then I exit the position today typically
268.72s: I would leave a little little bit of a
270.36s: runner on and I'll talk about the
271.88s: thought process behind it cuz I actually
273.56s: think that's one of the mistakes I might
274.96s: have made here but it's also Tesla and I
277.96s: know it's very gappy so I had already
280.68s: made essentially more than I was
282.12s: expecting to so it was time to then move
284.92s: on we'll talk about all of that but that
286.72s: in a nutshell that's how I found this
288.36s: trade there was nothing Ultra anomalous
292.68s: about the options chains when I looked
295.20s: at it it was moderately
298.16s: interesting so we take a look real quick
301.20s: and see what we see today there was
304.36s: really heavy call volume that I
307.32s: generally expect it at this point
309.16s: because now it's on fire it's it's
311.72s: gaining a lot of support but I looked at
314.52s: this yesterday right so the details that
316.48s: I saw were slightly different the other
318.88s: thing that's worth calling out here is
321.56s: the open interest definitely was
324.04s: slightly call heavy not massively but
326.84s: what I did see is in these kind of
329.12s: shorter term expirations there was a
332.84s: fairly persistent Edge on the primary
336.44s: expirations kind of like this 5 July the
338.24s: 19 July but again it's not that
341.12s: different right 392 calls versus 384
343.36s: puts so there's nothing super
344.92s: informative from here that keyed me off
348.96s: now this was very very much a different
352.56s: style trade for me and the entire basis
357.24s: of it was from a technical breakout
359.00s: perspective so I didn't emphasize
361.72s: options flow in this case I always look
363.56s: at things like that but that's not the
366.08s: the dominant feature this is something
367.76s: that's starting to break out out of a
369.68s: range even though it's downtrending it
372.12s: has massive massive volume support as
375.28s: earnings coming up so I don't want to
376.52s: hold for that long trade on that's
378.40s: really what it comes down to trading a
380.56s: breakout so when I look at the portfolio
384.64s: fit for this position I knew it was
386.52s: going to be a ratio called diagonal and
388.76s: that's one of the mistakes I actually
390.04s: think I probably should have just done
392.12s: some calls long calls to start but I
395.84s: didn't expect necessarily the velocity
398.76s: that we saw so I thought I would be able
401.20s: to make a little bit of money on the
402.48s: short calls that ended up honestly just
404.44s: being headwind for me I would have made
406.00s: a little bit more money had I not done
407.76s: those and we'll take a look at the
408.92s: opening position next right here so this
414.24s: is kind of the the series of positions
416.24s: that I went in I started with the 20
418.20s: September 200 calls the reason why this
420.04s: is two different lines is because it
422.04s: wasn't a tiny trade it wasn't a big
424.20s: trade I think this was a 25 lot so what
426.84s: I need to do is test the market I need
429.00s: to see where I'm going to get fills at
431.92s: and make sure that the liquidity is
433.48s: there so I open a smaller tester
436.12s: position then I scale into the position
438.76s: and then I offer the short calls against
441.96s: it the short calls were in the 19 July
444.12s: 25 and I'll give you all the numbers on
446.08s: these in a second these are just the
447.48s: establishing positions so this was a
449.88s: speculative trade the way that I
452.16s: expected to make money in this trade the
453.92s: profit mechanism is bullish breakout it
456.60s: needed to move in my direction that's
458.08s: what I wanted to see the initial Target
461.08s: was literally just outside of the plus
464.88s: two standard deviation Channel these are
466.84s: now standard deviation channels on the
468.36s: chart these aren't linear regression
469.60s: channels right now I'm testing something
471.40s: different so that's a slight difference
473.60s: than what you guys typically would see
475.72s: but that was the initial Target here
478.24s: essentially just a big move I I didn't
480.28s: care so much where it hit I did expect
483.48s: us to start getting gummed up once we
485.68s: start getting close to the 240 cuz I can
487.60s: see that's where the next even semblance
490.08s: of a volume node serves on this trade we
492.36s: got to zoom in just a little bit to like
493.80s: a 3 month and you can see it's not even
496.40s: like an impressive volume note at all
498.24s: it's just the the next thing that's here
500.40s: there's not a lot of overhead resistance
502.40s: the other thing is I do have a bit of a
504.76s: longer
506.04s: term Channel and I expected this to also
510.12s: slow us down just a bit and it didn't we
512.76s: kind of popped right above it so the
514.48s: initial Target was above the on a six
519.68s: Monon was above the plus two standard
522.16s: deviation Channel and I expected to hit
524.96s: this if we did get a strong breakout I
526.92s: actually didn't expect to fly up and
529.08s: through it necessarily like this but
530.92s: that was the original idea and then the
534.60s: downside Target you can see that that
536.32s: stop is essentially still there I had
537.92s: two of them I had the low of the day on
540.68s: for the first and then I had just the
542.60s: end of the Gap here kind of at the top
544.48s: of these two candles so especially after
547.48s: that really big powerful move on the
551.04s: first it turns into a much lower risk
554.00s: trade because I scoot up that stop just
556.20s: a little bit so even if I had gotten
558.20s: stopped out here it would be a very
560.28s: small loss relative these are ones that
563.24s: I'm expecting with a pretty high
564.80s: probability of getting stopped out if I
566.40s: get my move I get my move if I don't I
568.44s: don't it's okay but I'm looking for an
571.52s: asymmetric return profile here so I'm
573.84s: accepting a higher probability of a loss
576.16s: but I'm expecting to make more money if
578.80s: I get my move so the original management
583.12s: plan was to flatten I didn't expect to
586.76s: play scaling in or out and again that is
589.12s: because this is Tesla it's very gapy it
591.08s: moves all over the place you can have
593.00s: something that shows this kind of profit
594.68s: here but then it can literally drop off
597.32s: a cliff on not a whole lot of news and
599.72s: you can eviscerate a lot of your money
602.24s: this is a delicate dance because you
603.92s: don't want to take profits too fast my
605.80s: typical preference is to leave a runner
608.60s: and my guess is that's what I should
610.16s: have done here but I had made more money
612.68s: than I expected on the jump so just let
614.96s: it go and keep an eye on it see how it
617.36s: behaves so I can kind of update the
619.72s: model the loss is easy that's just a
621.92s: stop out in that case exit the short
625.20s: calls for profit then exit the long
627.44s: calls at a loss typically do a few of
629.52s: the long calls first test liquidity get
632.36s: those out the door take the shorts off
634.36s: take the rest of the Longs off move
636.40s: on that's all now let's take a look at
640.96s: the trades this was the resulting trades
644.56s: for today so we can see that I ended up
648.64s: closing these 200s those came down for a
652.88s: decent profit and this is what it all
655.32s: flowed like so on the first I had the 25
659.92s: of the 20ep 200s these were in the money
663.36s: I got them for 26645 average so it's
666.20s: about a $66,000 trade then I sold the
669.96s: 215s for 823 that gave me about five
672.96s: grand in a credit up front that
674.72s: literally just ended up being a problem
677.12s: so today as soon as I saw the market Gap
680.80s: up and start with strength I took these
682.64s: down as fast as I could I wanted them
684.28s: out of the way because I wanted to let
686.16s: these run a little bit more if possible
688.64s: and that's a essentially what I did so I
690.92s: took the short calls down for1 183
693.24s: that's a $6,000 loss just a giant slap
695.44s: in the face this is the one of the
697.28s: problems of running the strategy now
698.64s: you'll notice I had 25 to6 so the reason
701.92s: for that is I was still very much
704.12s: weighing this upside potential of the
707.08s: ratio called diagonal but this still
708.72s: served his headwind but you can't assess
712.04s: trades like that you have to assess the
714.36s: performance of the process in the system
716.88s: over the long run you can't
718.32s: overemphasize any one single trade and I
720.40s: bring that up because while I do think
722.64s: that this was a little bit of a mistake
724.00s: in this trade I could have entered and
725.84s: then waited to add the short calls one
728.28s: of the reasons why I didn't do that is
729.96s: for the same exact reason why I got out
731.56s: today because it's Tesla this thing can
734.16s: drop pretty quick so if you don't add
737.48s: the short calls and you do get that
739.36s: early drop potentially before you have a
741.88s: chance to see your profit run it helps
745.00s: dampen that blow just a little bit and
746.80s: it extends the duration you can stay in
748.52s: the trade because of where the loss
751.12s: would be realized as a percentage of the
753.04s: portfolio so that's what happened there
754.88s: pure headwind then on the 200s those
759.12s: came down for 40 that wasn't difficult
760.96s: actually getting out of them I was a
762.32s: little bit surprised I just unwind the
763.84s: whole position at once and that netted
767.08s: me positive 33 Grand so then the
770.08s: realized panl on the trade was about 27
772.52s: Grand and it was a 41% return on
776.24s: invested Capital so the trade in Tesla
778.88s: pretty did really really well we
781.36s: essentially took a 26 debit took it to a
785.12s: 40 credit and this was all about a
788.84s: breakout Trend following trade that's
791.20s: all so looking forward at this now this
794.64s: would be out of play for me even if this
797.04s: starts moving up even more I took my
799.44s: part of the move it is what it is I
801.52s: would get out and move on because this
803.96s: starts to look really overextended here
806.48s: so it can run up more but I I'm not
809.36s: going to put my money there I'm going to
810.72s: try to find better opportunities because
812.72s: then to place a stop on this is even
815.24s: even higher probability of getting
816.56s: stopped out super quick because when
818.84s: things get generally extended like this
821.08s: that's a a normal trait price will
823.20s: normalize to a degree so that's the
825.20s: Tesla trade if you have any questions
827.32s: let me know be an outlier see you guys
828.96s: later
