0.08s: how many times have you put on a trade
2.08s: and over the life of that trade you said
4.08s: whoo did not expect that to happen
6.68s: unfortunately that happens way too
9.08s: frequently far more than it should and
10.96s: it's because most people do not have a
13.80s: defined trade management Plan before
16.64s: they Place their trades so that is the
18.84s: goal of this video I want to walk you
20.56s: through this concept and then at the end
22.52s: of the video I'm going to give you nine
24.48s: simple questions to ask yourself before
27.16s: placing every trade going forward takes
29.52s: just a few minutes and then you should
31.20s: have far fewer of those occurrences
33.80s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
35.32s: back to all the outliers and a shout out
36.68s: to the patreon family if you guys enjoy
39.52s: what I do consider signing up it helps
41.68s: me pay my editor so that we can make
43.68s: cooler stuff for you okay so let's talk
45.84s: about this idea of why trade management
47.76s: flow and really this is pretty simple
49.76s: you just get to turn to Boom Reddit my
52.04s: favorite book and here's what I got this
55.12s: homie says holding options into xpre I
58.52s: have puts expiring 15 December for those
61.40s: curious today is 6th December and they
63.64s: say currently down
65.68s: 85% and then it says if I think these
69.72s: will be in the money December 15th if I
72.16s: hold them will it turn into a short
74.12s: position could I then close the position
76.44s: and receive total investment trying to
78.60s: figure out what to do here also do I
80.88s: need funds in my account to exercise
83.32s: options it's a lot of questions about a
86.28s: position that's on already this isn't a
89.00s: great time to try to figure these
91.04s: details out so let's check out another
93.00s: person this person has Garmin calls that
94.92s: are up 300% that expire on 19 January is
98.52s: it a good time to get out that's not a
101.12s: great question to ask either you're
102.60s: already in the trade people do this all
105.28s: the time so why does this matter why am
107.36s: I talking about this concept with you
109.12s: guys it's for these reasons right here
111.80s: this is from my website you can check
113.32s: out a whole list of different studies
115.92s: but what I'm trying to highlight between
118.28s: this and this is that if you want to
121.44s: succeed in this business you have to
124.04s: think differently than most people
126.52s: because this right here is what most
129.92s: people do they Place trades and then
132.56s: they figure it out as they go which is
135.20s: an awful awful way to approach making
139.12s: money so now I want to talk about the
141.96s: concepts behind this trade management
144.00s: flow so here's the deal the idea of a
146.72s: trade management flow for me it has two
149.44s: different versions there is a
151.84s: generalized version which is what we're
153.80s: going to talk about today and then
155.08s: there's a strategy specific version
158.40s: that's outlined in your trading plan
161.44s: that you have right what plan it's
165.04s: outlined there that's specified then to
167.32s: the specific strategy so the goal here
169.64s: is if we create a generalized approach
173.16s: then when we go to make and update the
175.72s: versions we have in our trading plans we
177.88s: don't have to reinvent the wheel each
179.76s: each time because yes some of the
182.16s: specific details pertaining to a trade
184.84s: will vary by strategy but you can get
187.92s: the architecture in place so that you
190.08s: can create a repeatable and efficient
193.40s: system so you don't have to recreate
195.40s: this thing every single time you do it
197.48s: and then this is probably the most
199.76s: important part of this whole thing right
201.68s: here it's a thought exercise for those
204.04s: that don't understand what I'm talking
205.64s: about here let me break it down I'm
207.32s: going to put myself front and center for
208.92s: you guys so we can have a conversation
210.80s: here when you think about a lot of your
213.04s: behaviors as a traiter there are a lot
216.08s: of things that carry over from your
217.60s: day-to-day life that do not carry over
220.68s: well into trading so the entire idea
223.84s: behind this thought exercise is to
226.24s: accept that fact and then to put you
228.76s: through the paces ahead of time so that
231.68s: you can preemptively think what might
235.12s: happen what you might do and then to
238.64s: weigh the pros and cons of these
240.20s: decisions so that you don't make a bad
243.20s: game time decision in the Marine Corps
245.56s: we do this all the time with the
247.04s: planning process we have a thing called
248.76s: a five paragraph order and before we do
251.64s: anything from exercises to missions you
254.04s: will outline a plan now very frequently
257.84s: what happens out in the real world will
260.60s: differ from your plan things happen all
263.28s: the time but the plan gets you to a
266.28s: point where making those audibles you
268.72s: end up making much better decisions
271.12s: because you've thought through most of
273.32s: these things ahead of time okay so I
275.80s: hope that point is loud and clear for
277.68s: you guys and the last thing I want to
279.24s: highlight here is that it's informative
280.88s: when we're thinking about trade
282.12s: management a lot of times you're
283.36s: probably thinking about the individual
285.16s: occurrence of a trade but the world of
287.76s: trading if you're good at this it's
289.44s: going to span a long time there should
291.08s: be literally tens of thousands of Trades
293.28s: over a 40 50e trading career so if you
296.56s: think about that you need to be able to
298.72s: create a feedback loop so that you're
301.76s: receiving good information so that you
303.44s: can optimize what you're doing and thus
305.64s: make more money okay so now let's talk
308.04s: about the flow because everybody loves
310.40s: my handwriting okay I figured I would
313.20s: put some of it in here for you and
315.24s: provide a voiceover I'm actually not
316.84s: kidding somebody reached out to me and
318.16s: asked me to not type everything because
320.44s: part of the reasons why they like the
321.72s: channel is cuz I write like a child I've
323.96s: that's like such an anomaly cuz
325.40s: everybody is just like bro I can't read
326.80s: your and I don't blame you guys so
328.36s: I'll read it to you as well this is
330.08s: going to pick up at a specific point in
332.20s: a trade flow being that we already have
334.60s: a hypothesis and we've already
336.32s: identified a strategy so I have another
338.68s: video on scanning for trades that kind
341.40s: of goes over this section of this
343.80s: process I'll throw a link to that in the
345.32s: notes below so picking up from there we
347.72s: first need to figure out our size for
350.40s: the trade this is the first part of your
351.80s: trade management is to determine the
353.88s: what I like to call the total allocation
356.24s: this is the total sum of money you are
358.08s: willing to apply to this trade trade in
360.00s: its lifespan yes this should be defined
362.76s: ahead of time because a lot of times
364.60s: Traders like to do a lot of bad things
367.52s: that lose them money like adding money
369.60s: to a losing trade so to protect against
371.96s: that we're also going to determine what
374.44s: initial outlay we want to give and then
376.96s: what our rules are for scaling so we're
379.52s: going to get to nine questions that
381.12s: pertain to this flow in general in a
383.00s: second I'm just going to walk you
384.08s: through the rest of these details
385.32s: quickly we're going to have a section
387.32s: that confirms or denies our hypo
389.44s: hypthesis we're going to have a very
391.08s: clear understanding of our profit and
393.36s: loss management approach and then we're
395.28s: going to identify how we're going to
397.56s: track the results so that we can
399.92s: identify what works for this strategy
402.72s: what doesn't work and you can optimize
404.80s: the strategy itself so now let's get to
408.04s: these nine questions the very first one
409.80s: is how much Capital does this position
411.84s: get so as you'll notice for each of
413.36s: these broad buckets there are a couple
415.56s: questions that pertain to all of them
417.44s: these nine questions once you get to the
419.44s: the end of them they will get you to a
421.08s: point that you've thought through most
423.40s: of the big things in a trade that can
425.56s: hurt you so there are going to be far
427.56s: less occurrences that you're in the
429.28s: middle of a trade and you don't know
430.80s: what to do so in this case how much
432.76s: Capital does the trade get what's the
434.52s: initial outlay meaning what is the of
437.20s: that total allocation that you're going
438.84s: to give this position over its lifespan
440.76s: how much do you want to enter in first
442.44s: the way I think about that is the more
444.12s: convicted I am upfront the more I'm
446.88s: going to scale in upfront some iies
450.12s: really don't need a bunch of scaling so
452.04s: I might have an initial outlay that's 85
454.28s: or 90% some strategies rely pretty
456.84s: heavily on scaling like the coverage
458.36s: triangle so I might keep it below 75% on
461.24s: average something like that then we need
463.16s: to Define how do you scale in and out so
466.68s: going back to this example from that
468.40s: dude that says they have Garmin calls
470.04s: that went up a bunch that expire in
472.32s: January maybe I don't know when they
474.36s: entered the trade but maybe before you
476.72s: place that trade you say okay I think
479.04s: that this this thing's going to pop for
480.28s: whatever reason or continue following
481.96s: this trend I have no idea what the
483.20s: hypothesis was but based on that
484.92s: hypothesis of a long call I'm just going
486.88s: to pretend as if I had placed a long
488.96s: call somewhere in here my hypothesis
491.12s: here is that it's not a really long DTE
493.56s: option so it's going to Decay pretty
495.36s: quickly and in this case I'm probably
497.44s: just going to apply a trend following
499.20s: approach where I might use this nday or
502.32s: the 21-day or the variance between the
504.80s: two in conjunction with a cross below
506.84s: the nine as a way for me to start
509.24s: scaling out of the position and I have a
511.40s: stop that I slowly move up to the
514.00s: previous perceived support provided it
516.64s: makes good pnl sense so in this case
518.68s: let's say we entered here that is my
520.96s: general profit and loss SL management
523.64s: plan for my loss if I drop below
526.60s: wherever I think near-term support is so
529.84s: in this case let's say somewhere down
531.56s: here if it drops below 109 I'm wrong
534.04s: that's when I need to start getting out
535.48s: I need to be completely out by the time
537.16s: it gets to 108 sub 108 something like
539.68s: that and then to the upside as I look at
541.76s: this I'll say okay I think it's going to
543.60s: go up and I'm pretending we're starting
545.36s: here and as it starts to go up I'm going
548.04s: to just slowly move up that stop so then
551.76s: let's say we're up to this point and
553.52s: it's trading at 120 I'm going to move my
555.76s: stop from down here at 109 all the way
558.52s: up here to somewhere around 115 nearer
561.44s: term support and then I might use this
564.04s: nday moving average to follow more
566.44s: tightly cuz this is kind of a parabolic
568.16s: move for sure where if price starts to
570.44s: close below the 9ine I'm going to begin
573.04s: scaling out while I maintain moving up
576.12s: this stop but you can think through all
578.52s: of this before you place your trade the
581.20s: next thing we have to ask ourselves is
583.40s: how can I get Hur holding this this idea
586.84s: is to get us to think about what things
589.48s: can damage our position and not just
592.24s: focusing on the things that are going or
594.44s: we hope go well you should spend more
597.28s: time thinking about this so going going
599.32s: back to that Garmin example if they
601.20s: bought a call again let's just pretend
602.88s: it was here and what can hurt them well
605.60s: in this case what would hurt them is if
607.44s: Garmin goes down that's what's going to
610.16s: hurt them so they need to think about
612.32s: what circumstances could lead Garmin to
614.64s: go down and have some ideas on this next
617.60s: part their Max risk and how are they
620.48s: going to manage the risk so again back
623.76s: to this example in a garment maybe their
626.08s: Max risk is the long call that they
628.60s: bought and they're comfortable risking
631.28s: that entire premium their Max risk is
633.76s: now defined now let's say that they're
636.12s: actually trading a 10 lot and they don't
638.48s: want to accept a Max risk anymore so you
641.52s: have to Define where you're going to get
643.96s: out before you get to your maximum risk
646.92s: exposure that you're trying to avoid you
649.40s: just determine it ahead of time how do
651.56s: we know if our if we're right how do we
653.60s: know if we're wrong again very simple if
656.24s: we entered here and I see Garmin trading
660.36s: down below my mental stop and then my
662.92s: hard stop I'm wrong I thought it was
664.84s: going to go up it went down I'm wrong
667.32s: how do I know if I'm right if I'm moving
669.32s: my stop up following price as it moves
672.36s: up I know I'm correct because now
674.40s: instead of booking in a loss I now book
676.60s: in a at least neutral trade and then you
679.84s: slowly start to lock in profits from
682.08s: there when I'm thinking about different
684.16s: kinds of strategies the specific details
687.76s: on scaling in SC scaling out how I
690.00s: manage risk becomes strategy specific
693.00s: but the concept of defining it is
695.28s: universal so as I'm talking about this
697.72s: specific long call Garmin situation
700.48s: that's me thinking of this as a
702.16s: speculative directional trade so I'm
704.28s: applying that methodology here now we
707.04s: already talked about managing profits
708.72s: and losses by Trend following because
711.12s: that's what this specific strategy calls
713.08s: for and then the last thing is what
714.72s: metrics are important for me to track in
716.68s: general you're going to need to look at
717.88s: things like expectancy for again this
720.28s: specific strategy what makes us correct
722.76s: being directionally correct so we need
724.56s: to track our capacity to be
726.76s: directionally correct so this is your
729.28s: homework before every trade you put on
732.48s: ask yourself these nine questions this
734.80s: is not an exhaustive list of pre-trade
737.80s: research you can do but the point being
739.80s: is to make it portable and light enough
742.16s: that people will be compliant in
744.52s: following something like this the
746.20s: problem is sometimes the good idea fairy
748.04s: strikes us and and then we have a list
749.56s: of 62 things that whenever you go to put
752.52s: the trade on next time you're like well
754.16s:  this is going to take me 3 hours
755.88s: before I could place a trade that's not
757.52s: going to work mhm I heard that I wish I
760.64s: didn't hear that but I just heard that
762.40s: so you got to find a balance between
764.24s: getting you to a point where you're
765.48s: finding the important details but it's
767.44s: portable and simple enough that you can
769.52s: execute it and you will consistently
771.68s: execute it this is a non-negotiable step
774.60s: of trading if you want to be an outlier
777.32s: see you guys later
