0.00s: What's up, ape outliers. Today's a video specifically for you. It's all about GameStop
6.96s: because I mean, we got a breath of fresh air. We got a little bit of movement going
11.88s: on. So obviously we have to dedicate all of our effort into analyzing what's going
16.68s: on because man, am I stoked to see these two consecutive back-to-back days today up
21.92s: over 8% in an individual day, which again for GameStop got to keep it a buck. That's
27.72s: on the smaller side, but I'll take it. I will 100% take it right now because if we took
33.44s: a look at the five day average daily range at 6% the 20 days, 4%. So I mean, this is even
39.24s: outperforming the average true ranges in today. So something is going on here. So let's
44.64s: figure out kind of what's happened here. The first thing that I have to point out is take
50.34s: a look at that volume, 15.5 million shares. That is against the 20 day average of 5.7 in
60.38s: the five day average of eight, which includes this other outsized day yesterday. So it looks
69.90s: like there's a bit of heat coming into this. And again, if I squish this all the way down,
75.58s: I can see the volume bar right there. So it's really nice to be able to see it poking
80.02s: up because it's competing with all these giant volume bars from the previous squeeze. And
84.46s: we can see it though. So I am very happy about that. The next thing we have to take a look
91.32s: at is the kind of price movement that we're seeing because if I zoom this in so that we
98.06s: can take a little bit of a closer look, take a look at what percentage of that volume today
102.54s: is by volume 97%. So we get this massive increase in volume. Take a look, the one day relative
110.90s: volume is up 50% over five days, 280, 283% growth, 10 days, 327, like big volume expansion
121.14s: over these trailing time frames. And the bulk of it today was by volume, which is cool.
126.66s: The other thing I'm really, really happy about is I normally see, you know, the disenfranchised
131.78s: apes, right? Fully so it's been a long, long path for y'all. But I know most of them
136.86s: think that the market makers are just going to not let price go anywhere, but it very clearly
141.14s: did break above 23 today and held it. Right. So there was no suppression below Max Payne.
147.34s: I think people were quoting Max Payne at 21, which again, I remind you, Max Payne moves
151.50s: as the day moves. It's not a static figure. But nonetheless, it didn't matter. Right.
156.06s: The market was still bit up enough that it just did not care. So what what's going on
162.22s: in here? Well, it's tough to say. Now, if we take a look at the open interest, though,
167.78s: this is also getting interesting because the put allies 294,000 and we now have 621,000
175.54s: calls. That's getting spicy. This is now getting to a point where it starts looking more
182.94s: and more like there's that really bullish positioning that we've seen historically.
187.98s: Now I want to be very clear. This is a near term change. I don't know what this means.
194.50s: And the last thing I would want to do is get a bunch of people's hopes up that there's
198.34s: some sort of impending move because I don't know. But what I do know is over the last couple
204.06s: days, just last two days, we went from 20 and a half and we just closed at 23. So we've
211.10s: made a decent move just over these past two days. And I can see the volume in these
217.42s: options starting to build and the OI is building out. If we take a look at the volume today,
222.42s: it was 316,000 calls against 54,000 puts massive skew. And we can see that this is a little
228.94s: bit of a shotgun blast because we see a bunch of these 30 logs trading, which is probably
233.46s: people taking their trades down today on expiration and moving them out a week to either
238.34s: 6. The other thing that you'll see here is there's this 20-sep expiration, which is starting
245.86s: to build out the next primary expiration cycle. So we're still very front centered, but
251.62s: it's not supremely just 6. Because we see 13-sep in here, we see 20-sep here. So people
258.74s: are building out into multiple explorations of the volume we saw today. 39% was at the
265.98s: offer or above on the call side. So people buying. And then 35% was at the bitter below on the
271.42s: put side, people selling. So that's a bullish configuration between these transactions. Now,
277.66s: a couple of things really popped out to me today specifically. The first thing is we had almost
285.74s: 2800 of these 18 ox go through smaller size, nothing, you know, that I thought too much about.
293.34s: These, however, I think differently about. So you can tell that we have this one contract here,
301.82s: there's one lot, not a one lot, sorry, there's one line where we have almost 2000 of these 21 calls
310.86s: in 20-sep at $3.30. That's not a small trade. And if we take a look on unusual whales for those
318.78s: that prefer the visualization here, that's $660,000 in an individual trade. That's not small.
327.02s: That is unequivocally exciting to me because again, you can't, there's not a lot of retail
333.74s: traders that can move at that size. So I don't know who it is. I genuinely have no idea. But when I
341.74s: look at the strike, this doesn't look like what I've seen Roaring Kitty do previously.
348.14s: Typically, it seems like he likes to be a little bit out of the money. And I'm just using references
352.54s: from Superstunk on his or not Superstunk, sorry, from his individual account on Reddit to see what
359.26s: his previous options trades have looked like to kind of create a bit of a fingerprint for him. So
363.82s: this doesn't fall in line with his M.O. But that's not to say it couldn't be him. But the other
368.78s: thing that's worth mentioning is although he's a super rich, not a cat, as per his recent filing
376.06s: with Chui that he made clear that he's not a cat. He's not the only dude with a ton of money.
381.34s: He's one of them, but he's not the only one. So there are other conceivable people or entities
386.54s: that can put on trades in this size. Now, it always gets interesting because you're like, well,
390.78s: how many of those entities are also interested in about one month's expiration options, which is
397.82s: his fingerprint. Most of the options I've seen him trade are about a month. They're not typically in
403.82s: the money. So I'm not so sure. Hard to make heads or tails of it. But let's take a look at
409.98s: these 21 calls and 20 set. And why would we go in the money? Well, it's pretty simple. Because
416.06s: if you take a look at these options, there are 73 delta. That's what this indicates over here.
421.50s: So what that tells me is that for every $1 moving game stop, these will move 73 cents.
429.02s: As compared to the standard, if you go further out of the money, and let's say you're looking at
433.98s: like these 29s and these 29s are a 29 delta. So that means that if games.moves $1, you see 29 cents
441.42s: in these. So why would we go in the money versus out of the money? Well, I have a video that goes
446.06s: super deep into detail. I'll link to that below. But the cliff notes version is if you're not
451.10s: expecting as big of a move or if you don't care about your ability to compound as much as the
458.38s: gross dollar return, you'll make good money here on a smaller move. Now you'll notice that these
464.86s: are more expensive. So if we have the scenario that you put on the same size position, meaning
471.66s: one of these costs, let's just call it 350 bucks. If you go out to here to the 29s, let's just
476.62s: call it $100. It's not. I'm just making them at easy for me. You could put on three here to
481.98s: every one you can put on here. So if you put on three of these, now you have the equivalent of
488.22s: like 90 delta's for that $1 move. But you're going to be decaying away super, super fast. And if you
495.90s: don't get a big move, the essentially the goal post, the starting point moves further and further
501.10s: behind you. So it's harder to make money. So the long story short is why would we go in the money?
506.46s: Lower theta decay and you make more money if it's a smaller move. If it's not a smaller move,
512.46s: you still can make a bunch of money on these. You're just not going to compound as much as you
517.58s: would being a little further out of the money. So we have to wait and see again, I have no idea.
522.62s: But I'm just really excited to see this activity picking up because we can see 7,000 traded at these
529.50s: 25s. And I see 9,000 out here at the 30s. And in here at the 21s, we can see essentially this almost
539.02s: this entire volume today was from that one trade, right? Because this one trade is 1999.
545.50s: So this is one person or one entity. I don't know if it's a person that's building a position out.
550.94s: So if we take a look at the O.I., it's only 1224 and they add over yesterday was only 125.
557.58s: So these are really interesting to me. For the GME live stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time,
563.42s: come hang out, share it with your friends because hopefully it's a two-way session where I can learn
567.18s: from you and I can walk through options and maybe share some of my experience with you. But
572.62s: I want to go way deeper into detail on these and see what we can dig up as likely contributors.
579.50s: Because the other thing we have to acknowledge is that earnings is right before this on 13 September.
584.86s: So part of this is an earnings play. Although it's not a standard options earnings play which would happen in
590.14s: 13 set you typically try to be in the expiration of earnings because they bought options by going a
595.66s: little further out. The IV contraction that tends to happen after earnings will affect them less.
601.74s: And if there's a big move, if they're expecting a big move, which again, I don't know why you would put
608.06s: on a $660,000 position right after earnings unless you're expecting a move or maybe a guide up
614.46s: into earnings. Regardless of that scenario, this is a great choice to decrease some of your sensitivity
621.82s: to the earnings release itself but stay sensitive to the price movements while keeping it relatively
626.70s: on the cheap. So fascinating trade that got put on in here. I'm really, really eager to see how this
633.34s: pans out and how this works out over the next week as we get closer and closer into earnings.
637.58s: So that wraps me up for today. Later today, we obviously have the outlier options trading for
643.66s: beginners. It's a live stream at 5 p.m. You come hang out, talk about options, learn a little bit.
648.38s: And tomorrow we'll get way deeper into detail here. But I am elated to see some activity of breath
654.14s: of fresh air coming on in here in GameStop. We're seeing more contracts trading above 100,000.
659.34s: So a couple days ago it was like two or three. Now this is starting to expand further out with one.
665.66s: Obviously coming in really close to three quarters of a million dollars. So
672.38s: fantastic. It's what we like to see out here. Some life. So as always, let me know if there's
678.30s: anything you want me to take a look at being outlier. I'll see you guys later.
