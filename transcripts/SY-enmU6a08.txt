0.00s: This trader here is a perfect representation of a lot of issues coalescing together that are
8.00s: very common to most traders. They're talking about the loss of their portfolio, how it drew
13.12s: down pretty massively. And the fact that as they do things, the market tends to do something else
17.92s: and they're not prepared for it. And there's two things to focus here. On the first thing is
23.44s: this just reinforces how important it is not to just mirror the common saying of, you know,
31.28s: trade your plan and plan your trade, but actually doing the work to build a plan that you trust
38.24s: is invaluable because that's how you stick through it when things look rough. The second thing is
43.44s: this person is way too focused on the outcome of individual positions and less on the process.
49.36s: Important remember, over your trading career, hopefully there will be tens of thousands if
53.76s: not millions of trades. If you focus too much on that outcome on any one individual position and
58.72s: less on the process, you are missing the forest or the trees. You know, I'll see you later.
