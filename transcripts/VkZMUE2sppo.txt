0.00s: Here's a sneaky way to blow up your options trading accounts by doing something that seems
5.44s: really safe by selling really, really high probability trades.
11.36s: If we take a look here in spy and we go super far out of the money, we're talking
16.56s: delta's in the three decimal points where it's like 0.00 something and you collect a
23.60s: tiny, 80-bitty little tiny amount of money.
26.68s: You can see you get 15, 16 cents for example, this 400-put.
30.68s: Well, the problem with this trade is you are collecting such a tiny little bit amount of
38.12s: money that you are likely going to win the overwhelming majority of times.
43.84s: But sometimes it will lose and when this loses, those losses can undo multiples of the
52.52s: winning trades.
54.12s: And since you're not making a whole lot of money per trade, sometimes traders what they'll
58.60s: do is they'll put on a bunch of these because you're trying to collect a hundred bucks,
63.40s: but you're not going to get there on $15.
66.08s: So you have to put on 10 of them.
67.28s: I don't know if it's sudden if you get a big move while you have 10 of those on in a
70.36s: small account, you can be looking at a really rough trade.
74.00s: You might even get a margin call.
75.36s: So you have to pay attention when you're doing this activity, we refer to as selling the
80.28s: tales.
81.24s: It can be done.
82.24s: It'd be super, super thoughtful.
84.24s: The dollar, see you later.
