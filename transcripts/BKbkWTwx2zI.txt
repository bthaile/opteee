0.00s: of making money, sounds really dumb, but you'll see.
5.88s: We're going to do a little bit of a back and forth style quiz.
9.78s: And my guess is the making money thing is probably one of the least understood elements
16.74s: of what we're going to be talking about.
18.80s: And that's not a dig at anybody, because most people get into this world of trading,
24.28s: again, with this expectation skew and not enough time spent focusing on the things that
32.82s: deserve your attention.
35.00s: So that's one of the things we're going to cover.
37.08s: Now, we're going to talk about risk management.
39.34s: This one is been beaten to death.
42.34s: And thankfully so risk management when people talk about trading or investing risk management
47.04s: always pops up like pretty damn fast.
50.12s: So that part overall, I actually think is good, but I think the concepts of risk management
58.82s: are generally misunderstood.
60.50s: So we will talk about that.
61.88s: And then we're going to get into portfolio management.
65.76s: Essentially, the way to think about portfolio management is it's literally starting with
71.74s: these two ideas, how we think we're going to make money and how are we going to manage
75.64s: risk and it puts them together.
78.56s: That's what portfolio management is.
80.04s: It's literally just these two things combined.
82.48s: So we will talk about that.
85.72s: Now to get started in a conversational side of things, I would love to talk to you about
95.48s: different ways you think you can make money trading.
101.24s: So a little bit of a brainstorm session, I'm going to take notes based on what I see
105.68s: you throw into the chat.
107.68s: So the question is, what are ways you think you can make money as a trader?
114.96s: Don't worry if it's classified in the way I typically talk about things, profit mechanisms
120.08s: and that whole thing.
122.16s: Don't worry about that.
123.88s: Just want to know how you think you can make money as a trader.
128.44s: Because when we think about this, a lot of people have a very rudimentary understanding
137.44s: of this.
138.44s: Lauren says, if I knew I wouldn't be here, that's a fair cop.
145.04s: Your trading option says credit spreads on a weekly to monthly basis.
150.56s: I would argue that is not a way actually to make money.
154.00s: That's not to poke fun.
156.60s: I wouldn't even consider that for the sake of this conversation.
160.36s: But you just outlined there is a structure credit spreads in a time frame weekly to monthly.
169.64s: We can trade credit spreads and lose money.
174.76s: So that's not so much what I'm thinking about in terms of methods to make money.
179.96s: Guy says, stonk go up, believe it or not, that is actually a perfect profit mechanism.
185.16s: One of the primary ones.
186.16s: So profit mechanism from guy is stonk up.
193.04s: There's one.
194.44s: We have one on the board so far.
197.68s: Go us.
199.48s: I hope we can conjure up a few more, hopefully.
204.76s: And don't be afraid to use subsets of stonk go up because there are different ways stonks
214.40s: may go up.
215.96s: The reason why this matters and the reason why this is such an important concept is because
223.16s: we spend so much time as traders working on all these random problems without actually
231.00s: starting at a foundational level of what we really need to focus on.
236.72s: This is one of the first things.
238.88s: So laptop CEO says directional.
242.20s: I would give that partial credit.
249.12s: So when we say directional, we would want to zoom in a little bit further.
254.52s: So then we would also have stonk go down.
259.92s: Laptops uses volatility.
261.68s: There we go.
262.68s: So again, that's a little too vague.
268.16s: So for something like volatility, we would need to click in a little bit.
272.36s: So this is things like maybe volatility risk premiums.
281.12s: Lauren says sometimes knowing when to cut losses can be a profit mechanism.
285.00s: If so fact, though, it cannot.
288.00s: It's a really important element of a trading strategy.
294.96s: But knowing when to cut losses in no way produces profit.
299.44s: Now it produces it can protect your profit in the aggregate when we're looking at a system.
306.92s: But if I'm starting the equation from what are different market effects or methods that
313.68s: I can make money cutting my losses is not that.
318.12s: So that's why I wouldn't consider that here.
321.64s: Shazad says buy low sell high.
323.44s: That's literally exactly what this is and that's 100% correct by the way.
328.08s: I like that.
329.32s: Buy low sell high.
332.36s: That's correct.
333.36s: This is an actual effect that you're trying to capture.
337.24s: Sell high by low.
338.24s: That's correct.
339.40s: That's something like this.
341.00s: The inverse sell high.
343.32s: Buy low.
345.92s: So we've been batten back and forth for what maybe two minutes now something like that.
350.84s: And we have a few rough ideas.
354.04s: And really I gave you this one.
357.56s: You gave me this one.
359.52s: This is probably the best and this which I also gave you.
366.16s: This is probably the best one that was given and then these two here.
374.16s: ZXBORX says rolling in the money covered calls.
379.24s: No, that wouldn't be a profit mechanism.
382.48s: Sell extrinsic.
384.28s: That's not inherently a profit mechanism.
387.40s: Barrow slash lend intrinsic to slash from your stock position.
394.20s: Well, if you're borrowing, I wouldn't consider that a profit mechanism.
399.52s: And again, your participation here is huge, right?
404.40s: That's the whole point here is to have a conversation about this.
409.00s: And it's literally for this reason.
411.68s: It's because as we sit here and we try to break down the actual ways that we make money,
419.20s: it becomes this much more difficult answer to solve, right?
423.68s: That's the funny part is we take this step literally for granted, which is very interesting
431.44s: to me.
434.72s: Laptop CEO says minimizing drawdown, I would not consider that one.
439.52s: Again, that's on the risk management side of the equation.
442.64s: Again, the way that we're thinking about this first question is what are different market
447.24s: effects or different ways that we can make money in the market.
451.96s: So if I were to set out as a method to make money, minimizing my drawdown is not that.
458.12s: So good guess, but I would say no.
463.12s: Wondering I have a small account doing credit spreads seems like the best way to trade based
467.32s: on directional movement is my strategy to fail then.
470.56s: Not inherently doomed to fail, it depends on how you go about it.
475.20s: But for the concept of like selling credit spreads, credit spreads itself doesn't mean
481.36s: profitable.
482.36s: Like, credit spreads itself doesn't mean shit.
485.48s: What I mean by this is let's say for example, I'm going to sell put credit spreads.
491.00s: If I'm going to sell a put spread and the stock does this, what happens?
498.56s: I lose.
500.16s: If I sell a call spread and the stock does this, what does that mean?
506.76s: I lose.
508.36s: So looking at the equation from this is the approach I'm going to take will it work?
516.76s: You're literally just saying this is the option structure I'm going to try to use.
521.96s: And there's nothing inherently wrong with that right talking about credit spreads is fine.
526.24s: But there's nothing inherent to a credit spread that equals makes money.
530.56s: It is everything that you do around that option structure that ultimately yields making money,
539.96s: which is really the goal that we want to tie into here.
544.08s: She says theta and I would consider that one.
548.80s: I think that that's fair.
552.76s: I wouldn't consider theta in edge inherently, but it is a profit mechanism.
559.16s: And I think that that's a fair point.
560.36s: I'm going to open the door for Thorough real quick.
569.36s: I like that one.
571.52s: So let's take a look really quick at the list that I built for you.
579.00s: And the list that I'm going to show you is not comprehensive, but I just want to use
584.36s: it as a comparison to what we came up with here as a group versus some basic ideas.
591.96s: Ah, there we go.
592.96s: She says, vol contraction during earnings.
595.56s: Absolutely.
596.56s: That is a profit mechanism.
598.48s: So vol contraction.
602.76s: That's a great one.
603.76s: That's one of my favorites so far.
606.80s: So let's take a look here.
613.16s: The concept of making money as a trader is actually really simple.
625.12s: There's not that many choices.
627.56s: The funny thing again is that we almost always take this making money element as granted.
633.52s: As if I trade options, I'm doing it to make money.
636.80s: So I'm just going to make money, which just is not how things work.
640.28s: You are trading in asset class, if you'll remember from episode one, but just because
646.44s: you're trading options as an asset class does not yield inherent profit.
654.52s: So things like this, when we're looking at price direction within price direction, there
665.64s: are two primary directions, right?
668.44s: So price can go up or down.
671.68s: Price can go sideways, but again, technically, even when it's going sideways, it is going
677.52s: up and down.
678.84s: So price really goes up or down.
681.00s: Those are the two choices for price.
683.24s: Now when we take a look at how price goes up and down, we might argue it doesn't go
691.16s: up and down the same for everything.
694.88s: So here's an example here.
697.40s: If we take a look at spy, it literally just happens to be up and we take a look at the
702.72s: move that we've got in spy from here to here.
706.60s: So this is over the last 19 trading days, 26 calendar days, 16.47%.
715.84s: This is the recent up move that you saw in spy.
719.04s: Here's another one in the very same ticker.
722.80s: This is 10 trading days compared to 19, so about half the time frame.
728.72s: And this move here went up 4.76%.
732.68s: Okay.
733.68s: So we can understand this like difference in terms of duration and in terms of severity,
739.04s: how far it moved.
741.64s: But now let's take a look at a couple other names.
745.16s: I have a position on now in Palincer.
748.16s: I've been trading it for a little while.
750.64s: Let's take a look at Palincer over the last 19 trading days.
755.36s: What do you notice about the percent return in Palincer over the last 19 trading days?
762.40s: Up 87.8%.
764.72s: Am I showing you this just to show you that Palincer went up higher?
772.16s: Is that the point of this exercise?
774.48s: No.
775.48s: So why am I showing you this?
777.80s: Why am I giving you these two to look at in comparison to one another?
784.96s: Any ideas what I'm trying to show you?
793.08s: This is the entire game of understanding profit mechanisms.
801.88s: The whole point of this is even when we talk about something like price direction up or
809.88s: price direction down, it's not all created the same.
815.08s: It behaves very differently depending on what it is you're looking at.
822.88s: There are different markets of facts that are at play.
829.12s: That change depending on what you're looking at.
833.16s: So another great example using Palincer again just because again it's up.
840.20s: What's one thing we notice in Palincer when we look at this move here versus this move
848.08s: here?
851.60s: This is a catalyst driven move.
855.92s: There was earnings that was good that led to the stock gapping this much.
865.12s: Notice how this move does have small little baby gaps but nothing to the same degree that
871.80s: you saw here from the catalyst driven move.
877.68s: So this forces you as a trader with this very one profit mechanism of price direction
884.60s: up to then double click.
887.32s: We know not all direction up and then you can assume same for the downside.
892.08s: It's not all created the same.
893.76s: So then therefore the way that you trade them will not be the same.
901.12s: This is again where the decoupling from the casual trader versus a professional trader.
910.20s: It's not just taking something at face value and saying, Oh, Palincer went up.
915.32s: Okay, sick.
916.48s: Bro, what it comes down to is your ability to identify these different conditions and then
923.56s: to be able to trade these different conditions effectively because for example, if we go back
933.64s: in this chart, let's go back a little bit further.
936.68s: Let's go back three year daily.
940.92s: What's something you notice when we look at this chart on a three year daily timeframe
948.28s: and we look at these earnings times.
952.08s: This is an earnings release.
955.00s: This is an earnings release.
957.88s: This is an earnings release.
960.24s: This is an earnings release.
961.88s: This is an earnings release.
964.16s: This is an earnings release.
965.76s: So is this and so on.
967.96s: What do you notice?
969.76s: Well, one of the things your eyes should be picking up on as you analyze these different
974.60s: earnings releases is that things go slightly haywire.
979.28s: You kind of have the stock coming into earnings, right?
982.52s: So here it's just kind of going.
984.32s: It's still upward sloping for sure.
986.08s: But then earnings comes out and you can literally see the size of the candle compared to the
990.16s: others and you literally can see visible gaps.
993.12s: You can see a gap here, right?
997.00s: With this candle that's poking up above everything else, you can literally see a visible gap
1001.16s: here.
1002.16s: Now, it's not always going to be this, by the way.
1004.40s: But what I'm showing you is very frequently the stock behavior price around earnings is
1012.76s: different.
1014.60s: So again, when we're thinking about these different ways that we can make money, this is exactly
1021.80s: what you need to do as a trader.
1023.92s: It's not just saying like, oh, I think stock XYZ might go up.
1028.96s: Let me buy a call.
1030.48s: That's not going to work long term.
1032.32s: I'm telling you, it's not going to work long term.
1035.48s: You have to have something way more robust than that.
1038.56s: It's simply not going to cut it.
1041.08s: So if your goal is to trade at a professional level so that then you can make as much money
1048.48s: as you want to try to make so that you can do all of those cool things that people we
1053.44s: all get into trading to do, this is the back end that goes into powering all of that stuff.
1062.84s: So when I look at something like price direction, we can trade price direction up and down.
1071.12s: We can trade price direction up in a bunch of different ways.
1075.76s: There are things like drift.
1077.84s: There are things like post earnings announcement drift, which is what I was just showing you.
1081.76s: There's post earnings gaps.
1083.96s: There's momentum.
1085.64s: There are tons of different profit mechanisms that live within the broader category of just
1094.08s: price direction up your first goal as a trader.
1098.56s: Before you even ever click the button, before you ever send a trade off is to spend time
1104.60s: thinking about this exact thing.
1108.36s: Because again, what do you think the outcome is going to be?
1114.28s: If you just come at this with a lazy approach, you put on trades that are half baked and you're
1121.56s: wondering why you were trading something you bought calls, but the theta decay accelerated
1127.88s: too much because you didn't go far enough out in time because you were trading something
1132.04s: that was really exhibiting more of a drift style move than a powerful enough momentum
1138.64s: or breakout style move.
1141.08s: So you lose money on an idea that actually might have been correct in terms of direction.
1145.72s: It's because we misunderstood this concept.
1150.60s: So what I give you here is literally a starting point.
1155.08s: Like I said, this is in no way, in absolutely no way, comprehensive.
1161.72s: This is literally an overview of different profit mechanisms that you can at least use
1168.08s: as a starting point.
1170.20s: Fun fact, when you think about profit mechanisms, they're interesting because there's no list
1182.80s: of them.
1183.80s: You're never going to find a list of profit mechanisms.
1190.08s: So find different things that talk about some ways to make money.
1194.08s: But one of the cool things about an options trader is you can access a lot of different
1201.84s: profit mechanisms.
1202.84s: That's exactly how I just shared my year to date where we are.
1211.72s: My year to date performance here.
1219.20s: This is in the discord on Sunday during the pro livestream.
1224.08s: We're going to go through this a little bit more in detail.
1226.96s: This is nothing sexy.
1228.52s: This is just a standard trading cycle.
1232.28s: Right?
1233.28s: There's nothing I'm showing this and being like, oh, I'm super proud of what this is.
1237.24s: That's not it at all.
1238.24s: I'm literally just showing you.
1239.24s: I share this on a monthly basis part of my end of month AAR after action review.
1245.32s: When I share this just so that you guys have an idea of what I'm doing and what this can
1252.60s: look like.
1254.16s: So what I want you to notice is my core allocation, which is typically the coverage
1260.04s: strangle in index ETFs, sometimes leveraged, sometimes not, long beta weighted delta.
1268.24s: It means that it makes money when the stock market goes up.
1271.64s: Typically suffers when it goes down.
1273.92s: This my year to date performance.
1277.44s: My core allocation gets most of my capital.
1281.92s: It's contributing 1% of my total year to date returns and that 1% funny enough comes
1289.92s: from a couple really small allocated names.
1293.48s: One of them being game stop.
1294.88s: I posted that in the discord because I find it hilarious.
1299.80s: In the coverage strangle, I allocate each position of certain amount of money.
1304.76s: Game stop has the smallest amount of money by far.
1308.64s: Yet on a gross portfolio adjusted basis is performing the second best.
1316.08s: Hilarious.
1317.64s: So anyways, that on a side, the only reason why the return is what it is has a lot to do
1328.52s: with pivoting to other things that are working.
1333.08s: This is the game of being an options trader in my style of trading.
1339.44s: And I emphasize the my style of trading.
1342.52s: The reason why I emphasize that is because there are some options traders that might choose
1346.84s: to focus purely on trading vol.
1349.36s: The cool part about trading vol is that it behaves a lot different than beta.
1354.00s: And you kind of always have a non correlated return source to market beta.
1358.16s: If you're doing that sort of thing, so you can specialize if you so choose for me,
1362.48s: I continue to be a generalist.
1364.76s: I know a little bit about all of these different profit mechanisms and it's how I trade.
1370.24s: So back to the point on making money.
1373.56s: My approach to making money as an options trader is to have different things I can do
1379.24s: at different periods in time to try and take advantage of whatever the market condition
1384.80s: happens to be.
1386.72s: So again, prime time example, the coverage triangle is not performing well right now.
1391.80s: Okay, it means I have to do something else.
1395.04s: Otherwise the portfolio would be performing very, very sad year to date rather than being
1400.28s: up generally okay, 33%.
1403.84s: That's a solid performance, especially being four months into the year.
1409.68s: But if I was only trading long beta weighted deltas, I would be getting smashed.
1416.52s: But the reason why the portfolio is not doing that is because there are other things that
1421.40s: I can do.
1422.40s: So this is literally your very first job as an options trader is to brainstorm actual market
1431.32s: effects, actual profit mechanisms and how they behave.
1437.68s: It is not sufficient is not good enough to simply say, oh, I'm going to trade directionally
1444.88s: to the upside.
1446.48s: That is not good enough.
1448.56s: You have to do better.
1450.72s: Otherwise it's not going to work long term.
1453.76s: I will always emphasize that point long term because you can always have you can throw
1458.92s: on a trade that might make money.
1462.52s: That's okay.
1463.52s: But the thing that I try to remind traders about and we talked about this in episode
1468.12s: one is your performance is going to be the reflection not of anyone individual trade.
1474.24s: It's going to be a reflection of the application of your trading skill set literally over tens
1481.28s: of thousands of trades.
1485.16s: So I'm going to take a pause on this idea of making money.
1490.56s: And I want to see if you have any questions.
1492.92s: If anything I talked about didn't make sense.
1496.04s: But I want to make sure that you have a clear stepping stone on how to approach this
1500.96s: very first concept of brainstorming different ways to actually make money as a trader.
1510.28s: And I have a video literally called I'm almost positive.
1513.28s: It's literally called how to actually make money.
1516.04s: Let me see.
1517.88s: Literally, it's actually hilarious.
1520.32s: The name of the video is actually make money.
1524.88s: So here that's the name of that video.
1530.12s: That's that video I was telling about.
1543.36s: That video goes into three profit mechanism that gives you a little bit of a deeper view on how to think about this.
1554.36s: When we're going through these profit mechanisms, your job is to understand them.
1558.96s: It's not on a superficial level.
1561.88s: Here's why.
1564.28s: If we go back, literally let's look at an example.
1568.28s: Let's look at balance here.
1570.76s: And let's say you're coming into earnings.
1576.80s: And one of the things that you will hear is through earnings, you shouldn't buy options.
1584.84s: You should sell options.
1586.84s: And this is one of the problems with broad platitudes is they're typically wrong because they miss the gray area.
1594.44s: In general, I would actually consider that fully correct.
1597.68s: Buying premium through earnings tends to be a suboptimal strategy.
1602.72s: But as always, there are exceptions.
1605.96s: There are exclusions to the rule, just like they are here.
1609.48s: So if we look at this upcoming earnings release, which I actually traded.
1617.24s: And coming into this earnings release, normally I prefer to sell premium as a basis,
1624.56s: but there are times where I will deviate and I will trade the earnings release directionally if there's certain conditions met.
1631.56s: And I traded this one to the upside.
1634.52s: If I'm trading this to the upside, would I be better off selling a put or buying a call knowing how it moved?
1644.76s: What's your guess?
1646.12s: Let's turn on the fan.
1656.16s: What's your those scenarios is better for me buying a call exactly.
1661.16s: Super easy, right?
1663.00s: Because in hindsight, being so clear, buying premium here benefits way more.
1673.04s: From this move than something like selling a put.
1676.92s: However, we also know that buying premium through an earnings release can be really dangerous because of the volatility contraction.
1686.84s: If we take a look at the volatility move following the earnings release itself, implied wall really didn't do that much.
1697.36s: Inplied wall expanded day over day 0.32.
1702.08s: So a very small move from there.
1704.12s: And then the next day implied wall craters.
1707.40s: It has a 3.6 standard deviation down move while realize all is a 3.4 standard deviation up move.
1716.16s: All this means is if I had bought a short dated call, I would have made a lot of money if I bought it at scale.
1725.20s: The danger of doing that is if the move isn't that big, even if I got a directional move in my favor, buying the short dated call,
1736.36s: unless it moved enough would have lost money due to how much wall came out.
1742.68s: So what's a way for me as an options trader to build a trade based on this idea using earnings as a price direction catalyst, expecting targeting larger price movements while trying to avoid being right but wrong.
1769.00s: What I mean by that is being right in terms of direction, but then losing money because overall we had massive volatility contraction.
1777.88s: What could I do in that instance?
1780.68s: Think about the qualities that we select when we're buying a call because that answers this riddle for you.
1791.16s: Literally that is exactly where the answer is here.
1795.12s: Trading options says buy a call, sell a put.
1797.08s: Nope, that's not right in this context.
1800.08s: There's nothing wrong with it, but creating a synthetic long doesn't fix it.
1806.24s: Lauren's on it like white on rice.
1809.64s: That's correct Lauren.
1810.80s: Seriously, awesome job.
1811.76s: That's exactly correct.
1814.36s: The way that we fix this is literally by going further out in time.
1822.64s: Why does going further out in time matter here?
1825.32s: What we know going further out in time through Vega that it's actually more sensitive to changes in volatility.
1836.60s: So a volatility contracts massively and I know by going further out in time, Vega is more sensitive.
1845.24s: How does this work out?
1847.16s: It has an understanding of where the volatility is likely to come out of.
1856.80s: That is the game.
1859.28s: So here's what I mean by this.
1861.76s: If we look at Palantir, we know Palantir has earnings.
1865.20s: They have earnings on the fifth after the close.
1870.00s: What is the fifth?
1871.68s: Monday. Monday after the close.
1874.28s: So if we take a look at next week's term, 137.4% vol.
1884.00s: Big, big, vol.
1886.80s: What do we think is going to happen to this vol after earnings is released?
1891.56s: We would expect this to contract.
1895.40s: What do you notice about vol as you go further out in time?
1899.64s: Maybe this 77 period, vol.
1904.56s: What do you notice about it?
1907.52s: Pretty low.
1909.48s: So do we expect this term vol to change that much based on what happens in this term or in this exploration?
1922.00s: Those terms are interchangeable, term and expiration.
1926.12s: Within this term, not going to move that much.
1930.72s: So because of that, if I go further out in time, I can reduce my sensitivity to that volatility
1938.12s: contraction while still trying to gain exposure to the directional move.
1942.72s: Yet, there's another problem.
1948.24s: Anybody have a guess what the next problem is that we have to solve for?
1956.60s: The way that I'm showing you on how to think about this is by taking a profit mechanism
1962.08s: and it's by thinking through each step on using literally the Greeks to build smarter
1970.36s: trades.
1971.36s: And I have a video on literally with that exact title.
1978.20s: Teruel and Shazette says theta, part of it, but not actually that concerned with theta in
1986.76s: this context because we're expecting a really big price move post earnings.
1992.64s: So the expected holding duration isn't that long.
1996.40s: So that's another thing that a lot of times options traders get a little twisted.
2000.28s: They think that like theta is going to just burn your options away super, super fast.
2006.56s: And it can, depending on what you pick, but because in the example we're using right
2010.64s: now with earnings on Monday, where you're looking at 70 70 T options, we can see what
2014.76s: our theta is.
2016.28s: And at the money, which is where theta is going to be the greatest, that's where the highest
2020.16s: extrinsic value is, it's about 11 cents.
2022.48s: So 10 bucks a day on something that's trading for 16, 47 ish.
2029.60s: So not insignificant, but not a massive problem if we're not expecting to hold the options
2036.04s: for that long.
2037.04s: So that's not it.
2038.32s: What else is the problem here?
2040.32s: You're on the right track looking at the Greeks.
2043.16s: There's not that.
2044.16s: Aha, Shazette has it.
2045.68s: Gamma, delta will move a lot if underlying is expected to move a lot.
2050.56s: Delta will move a lot depending on what delta you pick, right?
2054.76s: So an example of that is if I pick something that as a delta, 16 delta's, that means if
2060.20s: the underlying goes up a dollar, my delta's are going to move up by 16 cents or my premium
2065.68s: is going to move by 16 cents.
2067.44s: So it's not inherent to case that delta will move a lot if the underlying moves a lot,
2072.92s: it might not.
2074.24s: And that is actually why gamma is the next problem we have to solve.
2079.00s: Take a look at my gamma.
2081.00s: And again, this is all from a frame of simply understanding options, understanding the products,
2089.76s: the asset class that we're trading.
2092.32s: We can see gamma is very low.
2095.24s: Gamma is a penny.
2096.68s: Why is gamma so low?
2098.36s: Because we know that as you go further out of the money, gamma decreases.
2108.76s: We also know that as you go further out in time, gamma decreases.
2115.00s: So we've just stacked two slow gamma traits together.
2123.56s: By stacking these two slow gamma traits together, we've made a trade off.
2128.36s: We have low gamma.
2131.84s: We have low theta decay.
2136.80s: We have low likelihood of vol collapse.
2146.40s: So if we kind of rate these so far, we like this theta picture.
2150.16s: We like this vol picture.
2151.84s: This gamma picture is sub par.
2154.44s: However, there is a fix.
2157.52s: The way we fix this, gamma measures the rate of change of delta.
2162.64s: So if I have a high enough delta, I don't really care about gamma because it's already
2168.68s: high.
2169.68s: Delta can only go to one.
2173.40s: So when delta is one, gamma at that point doesn't matter that much.
2179.92s: What's the trade off here?
2181.40s: So now we know I'm going to pick a higher delta.
2187.56s: This overwhelms this.
2191.84s: What did I just add to this equation?
2195.08s: Cost.
2196.08s: The cost just went up.
2200.72s: Higher delta has more intrinsic value.
2204.64s: It's more expensive.
2208.56s: This is the process of understanding a profit mechanism and then building a strategy to
2217.72s: capture the profit mechanism that you really isolate the effect that you want.
2226.56s: That's the whole point here.
2228.76s: So that little bit of a long story tale, but that is the concept of making money through
2240.44s: profit mechanisms.
2242.56s: That's the entire idea is doing that exercise and it comes with a lot of brainstorming.
2248.84s: Okay.
2251.80s: Next up.
2254.48s: That's what Topsy says, but we're saying buying a call after the fact, how do you choose
2259.20s: which strategy before the earnings?
2261.36s: That's not so much the case actually.
2262.72s: I bought the call before earnings in that instance.
2266.32s: That was actually the point of that exercise is to show you that typically I would sell premium
2271.88s: through an earnings release, but there are instances where I will instead buy it.
2275.96s: That was one of them.
2277.84s: Now when you're talking about trading earnings, what we do is we analyze things in the
2284.84s: profit mechanism, right?
2286.36s: So we analyze the profit mechanism in this context of earnings.
2291.24s: And if we're analyzing the profit mechanism of earnings, you're going to find a few things.
2296.36s: First, there's going to be an IV expansion, a certain amount of time leading into earnings
2306.32s: about two weeks.
2308.44s: IV will start expanding.
2310.24s: The second thing you will notice is that IV contracts generally after earnings.
2322.80s: The third thing you'll notice is that it can be a big price catalyst.
2330.60s: This is near term, by the way.
2333.36s: The fourth thing is it can kick off drift.
2339.88s: So in this one profit mechanism, there are four different and separate conditions and
2348.04s: traits that can be traded around.
2351.32s: The way that you know what to use when is by researching these exact things.
2356.76s: The fact that I'm giving you this as a starting point is already a gift to be completely honest.
2363.60s: Because if you don't even notice, start looking at this, you have to analyze thousands of
2369.12s: earnings to understand what it tends to be like around what are the traits.
2375.68s: So this is essentially short cutting that part for you.
2378.44s: And it's giving you four conditions around earnings that are tradable.
2382.72s: So then from there, you have to analyze each of these conditions, get a sense of how
2386.08s: they behave.
2387.08s: You have to quantify and qualify them.
2389.60s: And then you go through that exercise that I just showed you.
2392.40s: That exercise that I just showed you was tackling this one right here.
2398.48s: Earnings release as a short term price catalyst.
2403.64s: That's exactly what that trade was built around.
2406.04s: That third type right there.
2407.44s: So it's a good question.
2410.20s: But that's the cool part about the research side of what we do.
2416.88s: Now, good old risk.
2421.68s: Risk matters a lot.
2424.64s: And the reason why risk matters so much is because as I very frequently like to say, you
2432.52s: can't trade no money.
2439.12s: So as an options trader, I think about risk in three different buckets, typically.
2446.72s: The first bucket is at the portfolio level.
2450.36s: So the portfolio level says, I have this total amount of money.
2455.52s: This is all your money in one spot.
2458.36s: Hopefully it's more than $3.
2460.12s: Hopefully got a few more bucks.
2463.16s: And I essentially say of this total amount of money, what am I comfortable losing?
2472.32s: So that might be if my portfolio draws down 50%.
2477.00s: I am now sad.
2479.16s: Okay.
2481.44s: That's good to know.
2482.84s: So what if the portfolio draws down 25%.
2487.16s: If the portfolio draws down 25%, I am filling cally.
2492.44s: Not happy, not sad.
2493.92s: I'm in the middle.
2495.12s: Okay.
2496.12s: This is how we get closer and closer to understanding at the portfolio level, what is our maximum
2501.08s: drawdown?
2502.08s: Our institute portfolio level circuit breakers based on this exercise.
2507.44s: Now, as always, in trading, everything, everything is a trade off.
2516.20s: So if we have this school scale and on this side, we have risk, this side is return.
2528.84s: So if I'm not comfortable with much risk, it means that I'm waiting this and this side
2539.24s: is going to raise up and I'm going to have to accept a lower return.
2545.56s: This is not perfect.
2549.16s: There are ways to expose yourself to really low returns and tons of risk.
2557.08s: So it's not this fixed relationship.
2560.44s: You can fuck it up.
2562.12s: So you have to be aware of that.
2564.56s: But at the portfolio level is when we start by defining what are we comfortable with seeing
2570.84s: happen in the portfolio.
2572.76s: And you have to balance that against what the potential return is.
2576.80s: Now most people will say, well, how do I even start this process?
2580.80s: It's a great question.
2582.32s: Now for those that are in the coaching program, normally what we do is we start by analyzing
2589.00s: goals.
2591.12s: And one of the simple ones is what is your annual return objective?
2597.56s: This can be a fixed dollar amount.
2599.56s: This can be a percent return on the accounts.
2602.04s: A very common annual return objective is to outperform S&P 500.
2611.32s: OK, fine.
2612.76s: So we know that the S&P 500 returns, depending on the window that you use, something around
2617.84s: 10%, waiting that a little more heavily to like the recent 20 years.
2624.48s: So this means that if we're going to outperform the S&P 500, it means that we're going to have
2628.00s: to return at least 10%.
2630.88s: OK?
2631.88s: So if we have a $100,000 account, we know that we want to return this 10%, it means that
2637.52s: we need to make 10K over the course of a year.
2640.52s: OK, we're getting somewhere.
2642.60s: So I need to figure out a way to get 10,000 doll hairs in order to meet my goal.
2648.68s: Well, the next thing I do is continue segmenting the goal.
2653.44s: And I say, OK, if we have $10,000 and we want to make that over the course of a year,
2660.24s: that means on a monthly basis, I'm going to need something like $833 and $33 repeating.
2667.40s: So this is exactly then how we figure out how much risk should go on at a given point
2676.64s: in time.
2677.64s: The way that I look at this is if I think the market is really delicate, tenuous, I'm
2685.88s: not super stoked on what I see.
2687.68s: I don't want to have a ton of risk out.
2689.88s: It means I'm going to put out the minimum amount of risk that I need to in order to
2697.32s: have this on the docket in order for me to earn this amount of money over the course
2704.04s: of the month.
2706.24s: If I look at this and I say, well, the market looks really good, then I'm actually not
2713.76s: going to focus on putting on minimum viable amount of money in order to get to this.
2720.84s: And I'm going to just take advantage of the opportunities that I can provide it that
2724.96s: it's going to make more than this.
2730.64s: Then we enter the risk side of the equation.
2734.56s: So if in order to make this $833, I have three stocks that I'm trading.
2742.40s: I'm trading Nvidia, I'm trading Meta and Amazon.
2750.40s: And I'm using short puts, naked short puts in them all.
2756.72s: And I'm doing that to make this $900 because we want to outperform the 10%.
2762.64s: This is an example.
2763.64s: Well, the first thing I can tell you is that the portfolio management level, there's
2769.48s: some key questions we're going to have to solve for this.
2772.28s: But focusing on the risk management side, one of the things I can tell you is that by
2777.40s: having this kind of risk profile, which is going to be defined risk, or I'm sorry,
2782.84s: defined profit, unlimited risk, technically it's not unlimited.
2789.60s: Risk can only stock and go to zero, but we use the term unlimited risk just because
2795.20s: it's simpler to say shorter.
2798.64s: So by having this risk profile, if the stock market has a month like it did in the beginning
2807.88s: of April or pick your time frame, end of March, really, end of March, what's going to happen?
2816.68s: Well, this is going to experience a massive, unrealized loss and a massive drawdown.
2823.96s: So then based on my risk tolerance, let's say my risk tolerance is no more than 25%
2828.60s: drawdown.
2829.60s: I need to see based on how I built my portfolio to hit this target.
2835.72s: If that scenario does happen, meaning we know that the market can go down, we use historic
2841.60s: references to ballpark what our risk might be.
2845.68s: If the portfolio would draw down greater than 25% in the sense, then it means that this
2850.60s: ain't it.
2852.80s: We gotta do something else.
2854.44s: We gotta put some other shit out there because all of these are going to be hyper correlated.
2858.84s: They're also going to be slightly higher beta than the market.
2861.92s: So if the market does happen to have a down move, these are all going to move together,
2866.48s: typically in a more exacerbated way than the market, you can absolutely hit your portfolio
2870.88s: level circuit breaker.
2872.80s: Then you have to start cutting positions to follow your rules and you've just set yourself
2877.16s: way further back on this because you literally set up a stupid portfolio.
2881.80s: Don't do that.
2884.48s: So risk management occurs in multiple levels for me and you have to think through all of
2891.12s: them for yourself.
2892.12s: You have to think through them at the portfolio level.
2894.92s: You have to think through them at the strategy level and then set trade level P and L targets.
2903.04s: So what this means at the strategy level is if my strategy is naked short puts.
2912.76s: One of the big benefits of naked short puts is that they give you a little bit of room
2916.48s: if the underlying goes against you.
2918.84s: And if you set stops that are too tight, you are going to be closing trades that otherwise
2926.72s: would have been profitable.
2928.84s: That's an artifact of this specific strategy.
2932.40s: So you don't want to do that.
2934.00s: So you probably need to set your stop somewhere because if something goes down too far, you
2940.04s: now know you're just wrong.
2941.56s: Your idea is wrong.
2943.16s: A naked short put is still a bullish trade.
2945.96s: So if something starts plummeting, it means you are fucking wrong.
2949.68s: You have to do something.
2951.72s: So what this means is at the strategy level, you need to define based on how your strategy
2959.32s: behaves.
2960.32s: And if you say Eric, how do I know how the strategy would behave?
2964.04s: It's a great question.
2965.28s: The answer is you pay per trade it.
2968.20s: You look at it before you trade it with real money.
2971.84s: So by paper trading your naked short put strategy, you might see that over the course of 200
2977.52s: paper trades that your average, because you keep your size generally consistent, your
2983.08s: average MDD max draw down per contract is $5,000.
2993.60s: Just picking something.
2995.84s: This is now your planning factor.
2998.36s: So then you can look at your trade idea.
3001.68s: So let's go into balance here.
3007.36s: And let's say that we think it's going to go up or 10 that there's not earnings all
3010.52s: that other stuff.
3012.52s: Let's take a look at selling puts.
3014.48s: Let's say that we want to sell these 49 DTE puts.
3019.32s: And we're going to start with the one lot, 5K is honestly a little too much to use for
3022.80s: the max draw down, by the way.
3024.76s: But if we look at balance here, and before we even worry about modeling any of that stuff,
3030.72s: we say all right.
3032.96s: If balance here drops below the 98 handle, this near term support by here, that's kind
3041.04s: of like an early warning system that this thing isn't doing what I want.
3045.00s: And if it decisively falls through the point of control, then I just know I'm wrong.
3052.04s: Because from the onset of the trade for this negative or put, that's I'm not expecting
3055.56s: it to go down there.
3056.56s: I'm expecting it to go up, not down.
3058.48s: So this puts us at $73 call it.
3061.36s: So we going to here, we look at what would our trade be losing at $73.
3067.60s: And you don't need thinkorswim to do this.
3069.12s: You could literally do this in Excel.
3070.88s: Well, at $73, you would lose three grand.
3075.04s: Okay.
3076.24s: So if we look at what we just did in terms of our broad exercise, and our average max draw
3083.32s: down per lot is about 5K, this is 3K based on the spot you would consider yourself wrong.
3089.20s: This would fit into that strategy wrist side.
3091.24s: That's okay.
3092.60s: So then all you do is you set the actual PNL targets based on your analysis again, based
3100.40s: on your strategy.
3101.40s: In this case, it's a directional naked short put.
3104.00s: I'm going to set some sort of price target to the upside where I think I'm correct.
3109.36s: And then if it goes down, I'm going to set it downside like we just saw it 73.
3113.20s: That's where I would be wrong.
3115.28s: Say la Vee trade goes out the door.
3118.24s: That has aligned portfolio risk across all three levels at the portfolio level, the strategy
3124.44s: level, at the trade level.
3126.20s: Okay.
3127.20s: Last thing, which funny enough, the last thing is what we've been talking about this whole
3133.16s: time, believe it or not.
3135.36s: It's all of this stuff literally put together.
3140.24s: So all we're doing is taking these two concepts and we're combining it into something that
3147.16s: we can consistently produce.
3150.80s: So for me, the way I do this is I have a core and speculative allocation as I showed you
3157.96s: in the year to date return breakdown.
3160.80s: Then I decide based on market conditions, how much money I might want to use in different
3167.36s: spots, my scaling in, scaling out protocols based on the portfolio level management.
3174.92s: And we already went through the goal based deployment.
3178.24s: That's how we figure out how much risk should we have out at a given point in time.
3183.44s: It should not be a random ass guess of just putting shit out there.
3188.84s: It should be a very calculated amount of risk that gets put out based on what your goals
3194.28s: are.
3195.28s: So this is literally how you build a trading approach.
3204.12s: I will take a pause here and see if there's any questions.
3209.96s: If there's anything that you want to double click into that we've talked about with respect
3214.72s: to these three items.
3216.72s: And then if not, I have one more slide that I built for you that hopefully will firm
3225.64s: a lot of this up for you.
3231.20s: So talk to me, are we good?
3234.00s: Do we feel comfortable?
3238.60s: Because I think if you can dial these in, it literally positions you to then have a solid
3250.32s: foundation moving forward.
3253.12s: This is the core of what it is to be a trader at a very high level.
3259.84s: I just heard a small scratch at the door.
3263.04s: I think you guys all know what that is.
3265.92s: So give me one sec.
3281.88s: All right.
3282.88s: The portfolio manager is here.
3286.16s: If I'm not mistaken, I think he's post dinner.
3290.32s: Did you have dinner?
3291.72s: Yeah, he had dinner.
3292.80s: You could always tell he had dinner because his chin gets a little bit wet and he's a little
3299.24s: bit burpy, kind of like a baby.
3302.08s: So we're going to let him hang out.
3307.16s: To provide, make sure that we're on the right track.
3311.28s: He's playing with his joy now, which is good.
3314.64s: And let's move on now to our last slide.
3322.00s: This here defines at least a general starting point that you might consider on how to build
3332.44s: your approach.
3334.04s: So we're not going to go through all this.
3335.44s: I just wanted to give you something as a takeaway, something that you can effectively
3340.48s: look at what we just talked about.
3343.16s: And then think about how to actually implement it.
3346.76s: This is a starting point.
3349.12s: So I'll leave this up and we can just have an open conversation.
3354.08s: Talk about anything that you want with respect to this topic.
3357.88s: If there's anything that would be useful for us to explore with the example, stuff like
3362.56s: that, let me know.
3366.16s: ZXBorg says, I keep hearing about a 2X risk reward.
3372.58s: So does that mean you should target 6K as your likely profit before taking that 3 risk
3377.58s: trade?
3378.82s: That is terrible advice.
3381.78s: 2X risk reward is terrible advice.
3385.46s: Where that comes from is a standard typically shorter term day trading approach.
3392.70s: So in a shorter term day trading approach using equities, it could be fine.
3398.34s: Two times risk to reward.
3399.94s: It might be completely fine.
3402.58s: The broader point is your risk to reward has to be set to your strategy.
3410.62s: So I'll give you an example.
3412.86s: One of my strategies is based on breakouts.
3418.14s: So if we have the concept of a breakout is this, pretend this is a stock chart.
3427.02s: And let's say price is consolidating.
3430.38s: And I think for based on my approach that if price convincingly crosses up above this,
3437.70s: I'm looking to trade the continuation here.
3441.58s: So what that means is my potential profit could be big.
3446.82s: That's the idea.
3448.58s: But I also need to define a spot where I'm wrong.
3451.62s: Whether if instead of doing that, it rolls over.
3455.26s: And then I essentially say I am incorrect.
3459.22s: So what this kind of thing can be is very small loss size because it's going to be set
3470.18s: super tight.
3471.50s: Either on that breakout, it's going to do what I want or it's not.
3476.18s: So I'm going to have a pretty high loss rate.
3478.90s: And I can tell you what the loss rate is for the strategy as it sits right now.
3483.14s: Give me a sec.
3486.90s: The loss rate for the strategy is, that's actually hilarious, 50%.
3493.90s: So it's literally a 50, 50, 50 trade.
3498.54s: Yeah.
3501.38s: However, the strategy itself is highly successful.
3507.18s: The reason why it's highly successful is because the average win is much larger than the
3522.34s: average loss.
3523.54s: So when we compare these, the average loss comes in here.
3533.54s: This is the average win.
3537.54s: So even though the loss rate is not good, it still makes sense.
3543.46s: And this is based on this specific approach going back to what we were just talking about.
3548.06s: It's a great parallel.
3550.18s: If we look at the short put equation and the stock is doing this and I choose to trade
3556.86s: a short put for the sake of a breakout, not the right choice, but let's just say I did.
3562.02s: Except if I set the stop right here and I do that with a short put, guess what?
3568.14s: This might still literally be max profit.
3574.78s: She could be max profit still, yet I just took a loss because I'm misapplying the risk
3583.14s: management to the incorrect strategy for a short put that little bit of a down move.
3589.86s: That's just gamma.
3590.86s: That's just what we pay to play this game.
3594.50s: So in that context, that's what happens if you apply dumb risk management rules blindly
3603.62s: across the board.
3605.30s: It has to be specific to the strategy.
3607.62s: Otherwise, it literally doesn't make sense.
3611.06s: So it's a great question.
3613.18s: And that two times risk to reward, you're going to find that typically in shorter term
3619.56s: day trading groups.
3621.30s: And again, I'm not saying that it's bad.
3623.06s: I'm just saying you can't apply that to everything.
3625.70s: So the idea of that being the risk management approach, that's bad advice with respect
3630.86s: to that specific strategy.
3632.26s: I think it could be fine.
3633.66s: I don't trade it, but it could be fine.
3640.10s: Neon says how much money does this foundation need minimum to be successful?
3645.10s: Zero dollars.
3647.10s: Zero dollars.
3649.66s: Everything that we're talking about here can be done via paper trading.
3654.16s: If you notice on this entire approach, this is the first spot real money gets introduced
3663.16s: to the system.
3665.20s: So all of this, all of this can be done with precisely zero dollars.
3674.20s: Don't need any money whatsoever.
3677.60s: After that, notice how it's MVP, minimal, viable product.
3685.00s: So that means if I'm trading this breakout style thing, one lot.
3692.36s: And I still have to make sure that the one lot makes sense for where I would be exiting
3696.48s: based on the strategy specific rules.
3700.60s: So realistically, to start this process to your point and to be successful in this process,
3708.96s: you literally need zero dollars.
3711.68s: Because up until step eight, everything else, zero dollars needed, it's only here where
3718.84s: you start actually using real money.
3721.68s: So you have tons to do with no money.
3724.96s: That's the beautiful part.
3728.76s: The laptops says do you support resistance levels to determine your stop and take profits?
3733.84s: Is there a minimum risk for reward ratio that you use?
3735.88s: It's a good question.
3737.44s: And this is similar actually to what I was talking about with ZX Borg.
3743.08s: It is very specific to the strategy.
3746.12s: So for example, if I'm trading something like earnings, if you're all this off, if I'm
3755.96s: trading something like earnings, support and resistance literally doesn't matter.
3762.72s: And it's because during earnings, the stock tends to go haywire, massive moves all over.
3771.60s: Support and resistance is completely irrelevant in this strategy for me.
3776.08s: Now coverage triangle, another great example, coverage triangle right now is in T triple
3780.00s: cues.
3782.28s: Coverage triangle support and resistance really doesn't matter for me.
3787.40s: Support and resistance helps me contextualize trend in direction that then informs allocation,
3798.32s: utilization and scaling.
3802.12s: So in this instance, support and resistance also is more just for context.
3807.08s: However, if we go back to a good old trade, some of the OGs will know all about APP, support
3816.16s: and resistance is literally the basis for the trade.
3821.28s: So this was a breakout style trade.
3826.04s: That was the entire purpose of it.
3828.40s: So if we go back, we got to get rid of all these massive gaps so that it normalizes the
3833.08s: chart like this.
3837.48s: So here's what happened.
3838.96s: This was the onset of the trade.
3842.96s: As it was chopping sideways, this popped up on a consolidation scan that I run.
3849.20s: And on this really strong breakout on volume, there was an entry taken.
3855.12s: The stop in this instance for this specific strategy gets placed below, not the moving
3860.92s: average.
3861.92s: I'll use it as kind of a secondary thing.
3864.00s: But the original stop gets placed below the low of the consolidation period.
3869.56s: So the last leg up was here, this entire zone that you see from this range effectively
3876.52s: is the consolidation.
3878.40s: So the low for the consolidation was right here at like 82 and a half.
3882.92s: So then give that a little bit of room 82 becomes the stop in that context for that specific
3890.16s: example.
3891.16s: So that's based entirely on support and resistance because the breakout of itself needs to
3899.84s: break out through near term resistance from these prior attempts at the highs that didn't
3907.32s: make it.
3908.64s: So again, using this trade as a specific example, you can see that there was an attempt at the
3913.92s: high here, an attempt at the high here, a sad attempt at the high here.
3919.08s: So a breakthrough between this 92 90 handle becomes interesting.
3923.80s: Well, what happened here?
3925.60s: It flew through the 92 90 handle all the way up.
3930.24s: So in this context, I'm using support and resistance heavily.
3934.12s: So to synopsize all of that, as always, it's entirely based on the individual strategy.
3946.48s: Same thing with the risk to reward.
3949.24s: The risk to reward is specific to the strategy and it has to be it literally has to be it
3956.24s: is such a common bullshit mistake to set risk to rewards that are fixed across everything.
3963.24s: It doesn't make sense.
3965.96s: And it's because especially as an options trader, everything you do is going to move different
3971.76s: massively.
3974.00s: So you have to treat the individual things that you're trading, the individual strategies,
3980.16s: the individual trades, meaning in the individual names, they have to be specialized to whatever
3985.36s: it is.
3986.36s: That's why I start at the portfolio strategy, then trade level with respect to risk setting.
3993.32s: So yeah, it's specific to the strategy without a doubt.
3998.28s: Shazad says, what would a realistic return percentage go for an amateur trader?
4002.56s: I know it's subjective, but what would something to aim for at least?
4005.52s: It's a really, really great question.
4008.36s: The answer is one that you're not going to like, but it is literally exactly the correct
4017.60s: answer is greater than zero.
4020.32s: Your first two years of trading greater than zero.
4023.72s: If you don't like that, don't trade.
4025.72s: Literally don't trade.
4026.72s: You're in the wrong business.
4028.72s: The reason why I say that is because in order to do well as a trader, there's a lot
4034.48s: of things that you have to do.
4037.52s: And in the beginning, you have to focus on learning those things.
4041.24s: You're in no position to sit there and say, I want to do blank.
4046.20s: And I always use Jujitsu as an example here because it's such a great example.
4051.64s: If you're brand new Jujitsu and you go to your gym and you're training there, it's your
4057.56s: first day.
4059.60s: Your goal going in on that first day is not to start subbing people.
4066.60s: It's to understand maybe how to even move as a Jujitsu practitioner.
4073.28s: That's the first thing.
4074.28s: It's not worrying about submitting people, let alone doing the Gordon Ryan thing and calling
4079.76s: your submissions before the match and then executing that submission.
4084.84s: You don't get to do that.
4086.60s: Because you have absolutely no track record and you have no skill yet.
4091.76s: And that's okay.
4093.28s: You have to treat it for what it is.
4095.08s: You can't pretend that things aren't what they are if they're uncomfortable.
4099.52s: So first two years, greater than zero.
4102.28s: After that, you should start progressing towards whatever your goal is as a trader.
4109.28s: So if your goal is to outperform the market average, then you should start trending towards
4112.88s: that.
4113.88s: Your goal is to have a consistent amount of monthly return, meaning maybe limiting portfolio,
4119.84s: volatility and reducing draw downs, then you should start working towards that goal.
4125.88s: But first two years, your goal literally is greater than zero.
4129.76s: And if that happens, you literally are knocking it out of the park.
4134.04s: That's absolutely crushing it as a new trader.
4137.56s: New traders, myself included, we all do this.
4141.44s: And it's because most of us approach trading from all the same context.
4146.68s: And that context is a lot of us don't have money and we're trying to figure out how to
4152.80s: make money.
4154.28s: So because of that, we approach trading thinking that we're going to make a bunch of money
4159.48s: really fast.
4160.48s: And again, from episode one, you will know definitively the fantastic way to lose a bunch of money.
4166.68s: That's the reality, unfortunately.
4168.68s: So first two years, greater than zero.
4171.36s: That's what to aim for for sure.
4173.68s: Your main focus for the first two years is developing a process.
4181.44s: So this is from episode one.
4184.32s: This is your light and shining armor as a new trader is developing a solid foundation
4195.12s: that you can leverage.
4196.12s: It's a not sexy answer.
4197.12s: I know people don't like hearing it.
4198.68s: I absolutely would not like to hear it myself, but it is absolutely the correct answer.
4203.88s: I'm super confident in that.
4207.08s: And then the following one from Shazad was you have a video where you go over analysis
4211.36s: of earnings trades.
4212.36s: I do.
4214.24s: That gives you that video I just dropped is like an overview of how you can think about
4219.32s: trading earnings.
4220.68s: And then I don't know if we did it on one of the Monday sessions we might have.
4226.20s: Maybe this past Monday, but we were reviewing some earnings.
4229.68s: We did it in the pro community definitely the last couple of Sundays because that's
4233.24s: a big part of what I trade is earnings.
4236.20s: So yeah, GCA says takes time and practice and no emotions.
4241.32s: That's actually incorrect to be completely honest.
4244.44s: The time and practice is absolutely true, but no emotions is just not realistic.
4249.92s: You're going to have emotions.
4251.00s: I find that to be one of the like a common bad piece of advice that new traders are given
4257.16s: because it's literally unobtainable.
4259.96s: So it's kind of like giving somebody a mission from the onset that you know cannot be accomplished.
4267.68s: I consider myself quite stoic and I will have emotions.
4273.44s: Everybody has emotions.
4274.44s: You cannot escape them.
4276.32s: But instead of trying to you know picture it as like not having emotions, I recommend
4283.64s: to people instead focusing on managing emotions.
4287.80s: That's completely doable.
4289.40s: Every single one of us can manage our emotions, but you cannot have none.
4295.64s: They're going to be there whether you want them or not.
4297.92s: And sometimes we don't, but they're still there.
4301.64s: And Ian says, question I've been asking myself, why is trading so concerned with minimal
4306.84s: effort?
4307.84s: Is it due to human element, an emotional toll or lack of control?
4313.72s: Why is trading so concerned with minimal effort?
4318.28s: Well, I think I think a lot of new traders just come in with skewed expectations.
4324.84s: I think new traders come into this from the lens of they think it's going to be fast
4329.12s: easy money.
4330.52s: So they're trying to do this, the smallest amount of work to get to the fast easy money.
4336.72s: So I think that's part of it.
4338.96s: And then I think the other part of it is a lot of people are sold of false bill of goods.
4347.80s: So what I mean by that is a lot of people are sold this super lavish lifestyle that's
4356.24s: you know, just super over the top.
4359.44s: And the reality is it really isn't reflective of what trading is, but it can be reflective
4369.36s: of the byproduct of trading.
4371.80s: That's what I remind people like all of these really cool things that I get to do.
4376.88s: It is absolutely powered by trading, but it's also powered by a not insignificant investment
4386.56s: of time and effort into trading to be able to do the cool things.
4391.76s: So I think from that lens, it's just skewed expectations and misplaced, misplaced hope
4403.68s: kind of I think is a fair way to frame it.
4408.40s: But there's a balance, right?
4412.68s: Like the fact that I'm able to kind of control the day that comes through building an approach,
4421.80s: but there are tradeoffs with that approach.
4424.08s: There are some people that will stay strapped to the screen all day.
4428.40s: Some of those people might be able to make more money, but the difference is I don't inherently
4434.04s: want to do that.
4436.16s: One of the reasons why I got into trading was literally to buy back my own time.
4440.68s: So personal freedom, the ability to have choice.
4444.28s: So you kind of lose some of that choice if you become really strapped to the screen,
4450.92s: but there are people that I have on my podcast, the outlier podcast that, you know, like Tom
4456.32s: Soznov, I like Tom.
4458.36s: And there's a lot of things that Tasty does that I fundamentally disagree with, but the
4463.96s: overall message in general tone and tenor what they do I fully agree with.
4468.24s: But somebody like Tom is like just he's all markets.
4472.80s: He's obsessed with markets, which is super cool.
4475.20s: It's his passion.
4476.48s: So for somebody like him, like being away from the screen is more of a punishment.
4483.32s: So I think a lot of people that get into trading, they get into it with really false expectations.
4491.68s: And those tend to be the casuals.
4495.28s: And those are the people that are not going to be in the business long.
4498.24s: That's just the reality.
4499.24s: They're going to be gone.
4500.24s: They're going to be part of that massive wash out rate that you tend to see with certainty.
4508.08s: Laptop says, did you place a limit order or you entered after the candle closed for the
4516.68s: breakout trade?
4518.20s: No, I don't do limit orders.
4520.76s: Whenever you try to trade resting orders like that on options, it's typically a terrible
4526.20s: choice.
4527.20s: And it's because you're going to get eviscerated on a fill.
4532.60s: So there's no way.
4533.76s: All I do is I set alerts like you see, meaning like like this.
4538.00s: So let's go back to a balance here.
4542.32s: So coming into earnings, when we get into after the close, like these alerts here, that's
4548.08s: what I do.
4549.08s: And I see that alert all into the trade.
4551.92s: Again, that's the cool part about being like a professional trader is you don't necessarily
4559.96s: have a bunch of periods where you're really strapped from being able to do that.
4564.56s: Now when I was on active duty in the Marine Corps, much more difficult.
4568.56s: And the performance that I had that's one of the things I'm actually starting to notice
4573.84s: is part of me thought during my time in the Marine Corps that my performance was what
4580.40s: it was.
4582.56s: And a big part of that I think was me not actually understanding how much the circumstances
4591.48s: I was in impacted my trading performance because my average PNL ever since I exited the
4599.64s: Marine Corps has been literally massively better.
4606.16s: My average PNL post Marine Corps is 53.3% and that includes two outlier years.
4614.16s: Without those two outlier years, average performance is 27.34%.
4622.08s: If I look at average performance while in high school, college and then Marine Corps, average
4628.32s: performance was 19%.
4632.28s: So my compound annual growth rate is better than those, but the average performance is what
4638.16s: it is.
4639.16s: So I think that's just something that I didn't fully appreciate until my time post Marine
4646.80s: Corps because while on active duty, there really are a lot of issues that you have to deal
4655.76s: with and like being on base when I was an operations officer, you have to use your security
4662.20s: clearance and you have to go into these different rooms.
4665.44s: We call them vaults and like you can't bring a phone in there.
4668.80s: It's stuff like that.
4671.20s: So.
4673.20s: Shazette said videos about toss scan setups.
4676.84s: Well, there's a video about scanning.
4680.04s: It's not necessarily specific to toss.
4683.24s: Toss is cool, but you can scan on anything.
4686.64s: So yeah, that's more about like the general principles and concepts of scanning, which
4690.52s: I think is more applicable.
4692.48s: Cool.
4693.48s: All right.
4694.96s: So the last thing that I want to talk to you about is a pre-read for what we're going
4701.56s: to be talking about next week.
4704.52s: So when we look at what we've covered so far, we've had an orientation into the world
4709.96s: of trading.
4711.64s: We've discussed this idea of building an approach as a trader.
4717.32s: So the next thing we're going to talk about is actually the process of executing, doing
4725.80s: the thing.
4727.64s: So it takes this general concept and it moves it into the application of the concept.
4736.68s: So for this video, I'm actually going to be spending time talking to you about different
4742.20s: things that I've done recently or plan to do.
4746.24s: And I'm going to walk you through essentially the application of a trading skill set.
4752.32s: Now in order to make that session more useful for you, you will be far better off if you
4757.48s: spend some time doing literally what we talked about today between this week and next
4762.60s: week.
4763.60s: And if you choose not to, that's okay.
4765.12s: You choose not to, but I guarantee you, you will get far less out of next Friday's
4770.28s: session if you don't do that.
4772.80s: So recommend highly taking the time and actioning on some of what we talked about.
4779.44s: It's easy to spend a lot of time talking about and brainstorming what might work, some
4784.60s: good ideas.
4786.40s: But there is a point where literally the rubber meets the road and you have to do the work.
4792.32s: So that's where you are now.
4794.84s: You have to start doing the work that we talked about.
4797.48s: So as always, if you have questions, you can always hit me up in the discord.
4802.36s: Be an outlier.
4803.36s: You guys are?
