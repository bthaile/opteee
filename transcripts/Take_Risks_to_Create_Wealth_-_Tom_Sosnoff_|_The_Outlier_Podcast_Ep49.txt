0.18s: what's up everyone Eric here welcome
2.22s: back to the outlier podcast I have Tom
4.50s: sosnoff back in the house again I think
7.56s: we talked last year but welcome back
9.78s: it's great to see you again hey thanks I
12.30s: don't even remember when the last time
13.38s: it was so I'm good well I can only
15.72s: imagine how much media you do it's just
17.76s: kind of got to like be a blur in front
19.38s: of your face after a while
21.60s: yeah you know it's funny you you look
24.48s: back at your life and you think that was
26.94s: never part of the game plan never
29.82s: I bet actually speaking of the game plan
32.34s: I was listening to a recent interview
34.86s: of years we were talking about that
37.20s: Finance wasn't even necessarily the
39.90s: initial Target for you it kind of was an
42.00s: opportunity that emerged that you then
43.92s: took advantage of what what was the
46.44s: target like what did you think you were
48.18s: going to do
49.38s: oh I was for sure gonna be in I in my
52.56s: mind I was for sure going to be in some
55.32s: form of
57.18s: um uh some form of government like
62.00s: I was studying political science but I
65.76s: was interning for you know in in House
69.96s: of Commons in in the UK I was interning
72.42s: in Upstate New York at the
74.88s: um you know in in New York New York they
77.40s: in their own um you know state
79.50s: government and working for a lobbyist
81.72s: and for state senators and I was for
84.60s: sure like some form of either
86.46s: international relations or
88.80s: um some form of politics I loved you
91.92s: know studying you know parliamentary
93.84s: studies and and different kinds of
95.76s: government studies and I figured you
97.68s: know I could do this lobbyist thing I
99.72s: could do this you know and and if and if
102.18s: all failed I could go back to law school
103.50s: but that wasn't what I wanted to do
107.28s: um so I was I was a hundred percent
110.58s: um pretty sure that I was going into
112.02s: some form of
113.40s: um you know I don't know some form of
114.90s: government
115.74s: interesting so do you have any like pet
119.10s: projects where you're involved in
120.42s: government on the side or like did that
122.46s: just completely detach it's attached you
125.94s: know I got bit by bug in um uh I got bit
130.86s: by a bug in when I got out of school and
134.16s: the in the world of Finance it was kind
136.56s: of like you know it I just got bit
139.70s: mostly because of the trading floor I
141.84s: would say but I think once I step foot
144.54s: on once I step foot kind of in the world
147.66s: of trading eight I I just couldn't look
150.18s: any I nowhere else was interesting to me
152.58s: and
154.20s: um and then when I stepped foot on the
155.40s: trading floor the whole thing just came
157.44s: you know it was it was apparent it was
159.30s: clear I I that's where I needed to be I
161.88s: didn't know how I was going to get there
162.90s: but that's where I needed to be
164.76s: interesting so when you realize that
167.52s: you're going down Finance did you have
169.44s: kind of some sort of big road map and
172.08s: just so you understand the Preamble that
174.00s: I'm kind of starting to get into is you
175.68s: talk a lot about decision Cycles so I'm
178.02s: kind of like peaking into the way you
180.00s: think about decisions balancing two
181.86s: different things having some sort of
183.18s: plan and a road map but also taking
184.80s: advantage of opportunities going back
187.22s: when you're a little younger you know I
189.84s: was a little younger I was a little I've
191.70s: always been kind of impulsive but but I
194.64s: don't think I had this I don't think I
196.62s: had a grand
198.18s: um I don't I don't think I had this uh
200.16s: this blueprint or this road map all laid
202.32s: out in my early 20s
205.08s: um but I think that you know like I said
209.16s: as soon as I got to the trading floor I
211.62s: knew that there was something special
213.36s: about that environment you know between
215.70s: open outcry and
218.04s: and just you know just pure speculation
221.36s: uh six seven eight hours a day non-stop
224.58s: action I I mean you can't do anything
226.56s: else it was like a giant locker room I
228.78s: love the giant locker room you know
230.22s: situation and it was kind of an
233.70s: extension of like you know childhood
235.68s: Sports and all that kind of stuff and I
238.08s: I couldn't imagine at that point doing
241.02s: anything else I had to survive like it
243.06s: was I was I was freaking uh I'm gonna
246.50s:  survive this thing if it kills
249.36s: me but I'm gonna survive this business
251.28s: and you know and I did luckily it was
254.64s: like when you were first starting out on
255.90s: the floor a lot of times people think
257.10s: that it's automatic money if you get to
258.90s: see you know then you just go in there
260.34s: and you make buckets of money and it's
262.44s: all gravy but you know the people I've
264.54s: spent while you know reading because
265.98s: I've never had that direct experience
267.42s: but I'd love to hear from you what it
268.86s: was like when you first started
271.32s: um
272.04s: it was incredibly intimidating at first
275.40s: because
277.50s: everybody
279.30s: like nobody wants you there like you can
281.82s: imagine you know imagine there's a big
284.52s: pot of money and if there's if there's a
287.88s: thousand people right then they split it
290.16s: a thousand ways but if there's a
292.08s: Thousand and One People persons they
295.14s: have to split it a thousand one ways so
298.20s: every time you add people to the
299.88s: equation you know everybody hates you
302.82s: um so uh I I always like love to tell
307.02s: the story of my my first day ever on the
309.24s: floor and I I didn't really know what to
311.88s: expect I was just really excited about
313.56s: you know about being in Chicago and
315.84s: being on the trading floor and you know
318.42s: all these little pits all over the place
319.74s: and people were screaming yelling and I
321.54s: had to pick a spot to trade so I walked
323.76s: up this pit it was a national
325.74s: semiconductor which no longer exist and
328.56s: the symbol was MSN at the time this is
330.84s: like the early 80s and there was only
332.28s: like five or six guys in the pit maybe
333.90s: seven guys and and I I stood there for a
338.04s: while nobody will talk to you or look at
339.90s: you or anything you know they just they
341.34s: just scowl at you and um uh this one guy
344.52s: this one kid he was a clerk and he was
347.16s: kind of nice kid and and you know you
348.78s: said hey what's your name I shook his
350.28s: hand he was a clerk I wasn't a traitor
352.14s: and I said where I was from so it's from
354.36s: White Plains New York and and he goes uh
357.24s: me and my brother and his brother was a
359.10s: Trader he was clerker for his brother
360.24s: because he was too young to trade and
362.10s: because my brother we were we used to
363.90s: live in White Plains and so because this
366.42s: is my brother this is my brother David
367.80s: and so he so I go hey David and I put my
370.44s: hand out to shake it shake his hand he
372.12s: goes you
376.08s: it was it right at that moment I
378.66s: realized okay this is my first
381.48s: interaction with anybody on that floor
383.04s: and it was at that moment when I
384.78s: realized okay this is how the game is
387.24s: played now for me personally you know
389.76s: I'm a pretty I was pretty thick skin
391.26s: pretty thick and I was like okay this
393.54s: does not bother me this actually
395.42s: intrigues me
397.50s: um
398.16s: because I just I just didn't really
399.72s: understand how how vicious and violent
402.60s: everything was and and then at that
405.54s: point I realized okay
407.52s: uh this is how we're gonna play the game
409.14s: that I really have to you know there's a
411.24s: lot I have a lot to learn and it was a
413.76s: learning process the first year was a
416.16s: learning process and and after that you
419.16s: know I realized about 95 or 97 of people
422.76s: don't make it
424.50s: um but I never wanted that to be an
427.44s: option with me so I I don't know some
429.78s: reason I made it
431.22s: um I think my personality
432.90s: I had the right personality and the
436.20s: right mentality for for the trading
438.00s: floor all it is is you know a couple of
441.00s: in Chicago there was about three or four
442.74s: different trading floors and it was
444.18s: about you know seven or eight thousand
446.58s: alpha males and they're all the same
448.20s: exact people just different different
450.48s: heights different different colors you
453.60s: know different backgrounds but they were
455.88s: essentially all separated at Birth
457.38s: everybody and so
460.26s: um you know I fit right into that crowd
462.20s: and you know that's where you know that
465.84s: the I have the same friends as crazy as
468.96s: gonna sound
470.34s: Tony who I do the show with every day
472.62s: today and JJ who you know who who I work
476.40s: with into the show and Scott and
477.90s: everything we've all been friends from
481.08s: when we traded in the in the s p 100 pit
483.36s: together from the early 80s we've been
485.40s: friends for 40 years and we all met
487.98s: randomly just you know down there you
490.50s: know we built multiple businesses
492.00s: together and done everything but it's
493.68s: funny how we've all just stayed friends
495.36s: because we're so we're so alike on every
497.28s: level we're the same people basically
499.38s: it's you know Traders are all the same
501.60s: people Traders all marry the same kind
504.00s: of women the women are all nuts the
507.18s: trainers are all nuts their whole lives
509.58s: are just insane and you know and if you
512.82s: survive okay it's fine
515.10s: yeah there's a lot it's it's funny you
517.38s: say that because anytime my wife meets
519.30s: any of my military friends she always
521.34s: says the same exact thing that we're all
523.38s: this it's this it literally is the same
524.82s: thing like we're all the same people
525.84s: you're just the average you know all of
528.72s: us are some average of the people that
531.18s: we hang out with so if you hang out with
533.46s: 10 or 12 people you are just gonna be
535.98s: part of that group there are no outliers
537.66s: you know they're like you're just you're
539.64s: some version either higher or lower off
541.56s: the mean of that of your small group of
543.90s: friends and and in the trading world you
546.24s: know it was always like that we you know
548.58s: I just was lucky in it just it fit my
552.18s: personality I didn't when I was growing
554.34s: up I didn't know that world existed you
556.14s: know when I got to Chicago in my early
558.60s: 20s um I realized that there was a world
561.24s: I never knew of and I happened to be
563.64s: good at it and and so you know that was
566.46s: the next I'm still in the business it's
568.32s: been 40 you know 42 43 years yeah um
573.42s: um random question but obviously you can
576.00s: look up different numbers online and
577.38s: whatnot but like for like a first two or
580.50s: three years Trading
582.00s: is there like huge upside profit
584.58s: potential for Traders that they're like
585.96s: oh man I'm so close to this or is it
587.76s: more like Investment Banking or
589.20s: something where you kind of know you
590.22s: have a bit of a road map but once you
591.72s: get to a certain point you can start
592.98s: making a bunch of money like how do you
594.66s: how do Traders view their pricing early
597.06s: on and then the trajectory
598.80s: well that world doesn't the world I grew
601.50s: up in on the trade reports doesn't exist
602.94s: anymore so there is no such thing as
605.40s: that as that world I mean you know that
607.86s: world was that was a unique time in
610.80s: history that will never exist ever again
613.14s: you know where there's the the the the
615.12s: open outcry era of pitch rating in
619.26s: Chicago was something that will never be
623.10s: replicated it's never going to happen
624.78s: because that was the Last Frontier of
627.42s: true individualistic capitalism I mean
630.18s: that was the Last Frontier of you know
633.18s: brutally violent capitalism and it's and
636.00s: it's at its fiercest you know most
639.48s: introductory level and anybody could
642.36s: participate I mean you know when I first
644.52s: started out I you know I come from a
647.10s: very middle class background and and I
649.68s: didn't know you know I mean I came to
651.60s: Chicago with 1500 hours in my pocket
653.28s: like it wasn't like I came a lot of
654.60s: money and so I had no idea you know what
657.90s: to you know really what to expect or
660.12s: what to think about you know the the
661.92s: business and um you know so I figured
664.68s: well if you make you know if I can make
667.20s: a hundred grand you know that would be
669.30s: great and then after one year I'm like
670.86s: you know I need to make in the trading
673.80s: business it's a little different and he
675.18s: can't explain to somebody else but we
677.04s: used to say like you know if we make a
679.08s: million dollars and we lose a million
680.46s: dollars we're actually down a million
682.32s: dollars because your lifestyle changes
684.60s: so
686.22s: you know after a couple of years you
688.92s: know I was starting to make you know I I
691.44s: mean insane amount of money because
693.92s: first of all there was a lot of
695.70s: opportunity and SEC if you were good
697.20s: there was a lot of opportunity and
698.70s: second you know I had no idea that you
700.74s: could make you know this kind of money
703.02s: you know like you know hundreds of
705.54s: thousands or millions of dollars a year
707.52s: you know by the time you're 25 years old
709.50s: it's insane back then in the early 80s
711.78s: so we did it was a different world I
715.20s: could never I didn't even tell my
716.40s: parents what I did for a living they
717.90s: thought I was a drug dealer probably I
719.28s: have no idea
720.24s: you know I mean it's not a far cry right
723.18s: like you guys should I have no idea
726.38s: I go mom think of me as a stock broker
729.00s: maybe something like that you know like
730.44s: like just except I except I work for
732.96s: myself you know and um
735.24s: um so you just take at that point you
738.18s: take a ridiculous I mean we would take
740.16s: so much risk like I probably took a
743.28s: hundred times the risk back then with no
745.08s: money that I take today 100 times
748.62s: and is that some of it because you
750.42s: hadn't seen enough to like really
751.74s: appreciate the risk there or was it
753.18s: because you were just sure yeah I had
755.16s: you know you're young you're you're
757.14s: young you're Brash you're kind of stupid
758.76s: you're you know you're definitely
760.44s: immature you um you you've never lost so
763.92s: you don't know what losing's like
766.32s: um and you think you're absolutely
768.90s: Invincible like there's no question you
770.94s: think you're invincible and and you
772.98s: think you're bigger than the market like
774.30s: there was you couldn't intimidate you
777.00s: know I would say of thousands of Traders
779.40s: on the floor that anybody that was a
782.16s: Survivor you couldn't intimidate them
783.42s: there was no number that could
784.38s: intimidate they were all crazy so that
788.46s: was just a different world it's totally
790.26s: changed I don't think that world will
791.82s: you know ever exist again but I guess
794.58s: you know for me I was in the right place
795.90s: at the right time
797.10s: which leads me to my follow-on and
798.72s: that's why I wanted to understand what
799.92s: that landscape was like for you because
801.24s: then obviously a Time came up where you
803.10s: moved on why did you move on from there
805.74s: is it just because you saw it changing
807.24s: or was there other opportunity yeah
809.04s: yeah so in in the late 90s so I started
812.22s: trading in the early 80s like 81-ish
816.06s: um and you know it was still pretty the
819.72s: the option Marketplace was only a couple
821.64s: years old it was still pretty crude
823.08s: there was lots of you know it was it was
825.12s: very different world but by the late 90s
827.10s: you know it had become a more
829.08s: established you know Financial
830.42s: derivative and
833.34s: um and you could tell that the
835.98s: technology was getting
837.48s: better and better and there were new
840.00s: exchanges popping up and we were about
841.50s: to go you know you know they're pure
843.18s: electronic exchanges and and and I had
846.00s: also been standing there almost you know
847.50s: 19 years in the same spot and and at
850.20s: that point I'm thinking the
852.60s: you know this has been a great run but
854.46s: there's got to be more life than you
856.44s: know standing here trying to make 100
857.64s: eighths or 100 quarters you know
859.74s: whatever you know 1250 or 2500 or 5 000
863.46s: whatever it was you know and so I
866.52s: started to just I was I didn't really I
869.10s: wasn't really taking this deep
870.90s: introspective look at my life I was just
872.88s: saying you know you know there's there's
875.22s: more to it and
877.32s: um you know we had started managing some
878.76s: money we had started some other
879.90s: businesses and I just one day stepped
884.64s: outside the pit in terms of my buddy
886.68s: Scott we were partners and said you know
889.02s: I got an idea let's do something
891.00s: different and the idea was think or Swim
892.94s: and that started us in a you know and
896.28s: Scott and I had done a lot of different
897.48s: Investments together but this time you
899.46s: know it was like okay they were gonna do
901.50s: something that we actually you know
902.82s: understand and
904.62s: um and we're gonna we're gonna roll the
906.78s: dice and take all the money that we've
908.04s: made over the last you know 10 15 years
910.38s: and you know and see we can build
913.56s: because it's time to do something
914.82s: different that was in like the late 90s
917.22s: for you right or early 2000s 1999. yeah
919.92s: okay and then word on the street was
922.14s: when you guys first designed thicker
923.82s: swim it came out and it didn't have
925.62s: charts is that accurate that's accurate
928.68s: so when you guys were building that
931.22s: obviously you had a different picture of
933.60s: what the retail Trader was going to be
935.40s: focused on and then obviously they
937.62s: informed you otherwise what was that
939.78s: process like developing this product and
941.76s: then getting that kind of feedback so so
944.36s: we're not
947.16s: we're not good listeners it would be the
949.14s: easiest way to explain this we were
951.30s: never good listeners we were very we
953.58s: were very aggressive decision makers but
955.86s: we were never good listeners and when we
957.90s: built Dickerson
959.16s: we had all these ideas about you know
961.56s: like what a what a trading platform
963.54s: should look like
964.68s: but it was nothing like any other
966.12s: trading platform that had ever been
967.38s: built before and we had these brilliant
970.98s: um coders and these brilliant designers
973.38s: designers in Chicago coders all over and
976.74s: we we felt like oh my God we're building
980.04s: something like we knew we were building
982.68s: something special because we didn't
984.84s: listen to what anybody else said like we
986.88s: totally went our own Direction and we
988.92s: knew that was the right thing to do and
990.96s: we got the platform basically built you
993.48s: know we're like
995.46s: somebody came to us they said where's
996.96s: the charting package and we go who uses
999.90s: charts like we've been trading for 20
1002.06s: years and never looked at a chart nobody
1004.22s: on the trading floor has ever looks at a
1005.78s: chart
1006.56s: so to us this whole concept of charts
1008.90s: was like Voodoo you know we're like who
1011.54s: the hell looks at charts and and
1012.98s: somebody said to you like every retail
1015.26s: customer that took an education course
1017.48s: in trading looks at charts that's all
1019.52s: they do is sell charting courses and I'm
1021.74s: like you've got to be freaking kidding
1023.18s: me like oh yeah all these experts
1024.86s: they're all charters I go I have never
1027.08s: met a technician in my entire life or I
1030.20s: mean of course I met some but I was like
1031.76s: but I'm like nobody uses charts the
1034.22s: trading floor there's we're we're butt
1037.10s: up against each other there's no room
1038.36s: for there's no charting there's no
1040.16s: there's nothing there's nothing charting
1042.08s: was to be the dumbest thing ever to me
1043.64s: because because because
1045.28s: markets were all driven by order flow
1047.72s: and charting had nothing to do with
1049.16s: anything and so
1051.20s: so none of us building this platform had
1053.90s: ever thought about putting charts in so
1055.28s: we're like oh now what do we do you
1057.98s: know like like people are gonna say they
1059.78s: want charts and they're gonna bug us
1061.46s: about charts so we went out and we made
1064.34s: a deal with Tim Knight at profit charts
1066.56s: and
1068.06s: um and we made a deal we licensed his
1070.76s: chart so we put profit charts on the
1072.74s: platform to start off with and just to
1075.50s: you know appease the customers and it
1077.72s: worked fine and then we built our own
1079.52s: charting platform which a lot of people
1081.08s: consider to be the best in any you know
1083.12s: in any online brokerage platform
1085.64s: um we built our own just to you know
1087.68s: just so we had two charting Platforms in
1089.30s: the end but we never spent like we built
1093.08s: it for the customers but and we've been
1095.54s: teaching options and teaching classes
1097.40s: for 20 years and doing everything
1098.86s: imaginable content-wise we've never done
1101.12s: one thing on technical analysis so it
1103.58s: definitely and if you know tasty it has
1105.74s: nothing to do with tasting it's not even
1107.18s: part of what we do so right
1110.00s: um you know and we've definitely weaned
1111.68s: customers off of the whole concept of
1113.72s: charts and everything else and we've
1115.16s: done you know more to kill technical
1117.62s: analysis than anybody else in the world
1118.94s: so I feel conf I feel good about that
1120.98s: but um
1122.96s: you know even to this day you know I
1124.94s: mean I mean I'll look at a chart
1126.68s: occasionally just to see where a stock
1128.00s: was or has been but not for any
1130.34s: indicators or anything you know I mean
1132.68s: it doesn't mean anything to us we are
1135.02s: everything we do is focused on looking
1138.50s: forward and and using derivative pricing
1141.62s: to give us you know basically
1145.16s: a probabilistic outcomes based on
1148.16s: current derivatives pricing we couldn't
1149.72s: care less about you know what's happened
1151.94s: in the past if we believe markets are
1154.16s: random and they're efficient and it
1156.20s: doesn't mean anything to us but anyway
1157.88s: that's a funny story because you know we
1159.86s: had to we had to learn we had to learn
1161.84s: on the Fly
1163.16s: well I thought it was hilarious that you
1164.96s: guys spend time you know building this
1166.40s: really robust platform and then somebody
1167.96s: was just like we're the charts
1169.82s: yeah yeah no that's exactly what
1171.92s: happened and and it wasn't even and the
1175.04s: crazy thing was we got it wasn't like
1177.86s: early on in the process like we launched
1180.50s: without charts like we launched the damn
1183.20s: platform and and and and and because
1185.66s: nobody in our office every single person
1188.06s: we hired came from the training floor
1190.46s: and nobody thought it was weird not to
1193.04s: have charts it's like we all looked at
1195.32s: each other like how come nobody say
1196.94s: anything about this and we're like
1198.02s: because nobody's ever used it we didn't
1200.12s: have one person that ever used the chart
1201.98s: before
1202.94s: so like oh God we gotta go stream
1204.62s: Scramble for charts
1206.90s: um we did we did and we did it all and
1209.00s: it was like you know
1210.80s: um but yeah that was that was funny part
1214.34s: of of building a thing or something yeah
1217.22s: yeah I think it's it's really
1218.66s: interesting and I you know I think the
1220.82s: the whole technical analysis
1222.62s: conversation is only interesting I know
1224.42s: you've had that discussion a gajillion
1226.34s: times so I won't bore you with that but
1228.32s: I do think you bring up a more
1229.52s: interesting point that I'd like to
1230.66s: linger on for a moment is just
1232.10s: essentially using derivatives pricing as
1234.92s: a better projection of future potential
1236.90s: and I've always viewed that as kind of
1238.94s: like crowdsourcing future probabilistic
1242.06s: outcomes using the entire Market
1243.86s: consensus that's essentially what it is
1247.10s: I mean you're using you're using the
1249.80s: totality of all the money that's out
1252.14s: there you know pricing different things
1254.30s: and you have to assume that it's the
1256.94s: whole you know essentially law of large
1259.04s: numbers or or just you know
1261.62s: um just if you take enough guesses at
1263.96s: how many jelly beans are in the jar
1265.10s: eventually somebody's gonna get it
1267.26s: um right yeah yeah I think it's it's
1271.34s: that I I've gone about using technical
1273.14s: analysis I think obviously for retail
1274.70s: Traders it's you know some of them I
1277.40s: think are like very heavily reliant on
1279.62s: it but I do think for a lot of us it is
1282.38s: good for context and I think you've done
1283.88s: a pretty good job actually finding that
1285.32s: midline in terms of calling it an
1286.82s: engagement tool right yeah it's an
1288.44s: engagement tools context we don't have
1290.60s: any issue with with it it's just you
1292.94s: know we're not gonna waste a lot of our
1294.98s: you know we're not going to waste a lot
1296.42s: of resources on stuff that you know
1298.90s: we're about
1301.40s: figuring out
1303.74s: optimal Mechanics for helping people to
1306.62s: you know to create wealth I'm not you
1309.32s: know I'm I'm not in the business of you
1312.02s: know of anything else other than you
1314.36s: know facilitating opportunity and
1315.92s: facilitating wealth creation and I just
1318.02s: think there's better ways to do it yeah
1319.88s: yeah so one of the things I wanted to
1322.16s: ask you specifically on that vein
1324.68s: um is I know that you've talked a lot
1327.86s: about this idea of pot odds and your
1330.38s: background when you were a caddy and you
1332.84s: had that I think it was a caddy master I
1334.88s: forgot what their term is the dude that
1336.26s: runs you guys and he used to take you
1338.00s: guys for all your money and one of the
1339.26s: things he used to do is essentially wait
1341.42s: to play the game where you guys are
1342.68s: throwing stuff into the bucket until it
1344.72s: was full enough right so he has this
1346.34s: asymmetric risk profile yeah how do you
1349.52s: think Traders have an opportunity to
1351.50s: seek that that similar kind of
1353.60s: asymmetric risk profile specifically
1355.52s: using credit style strategies that are
1358.16s: kind of risk defined right out well not
1360.62s: on risk undefined Capital Income defined
1363.32s: right out of the eight I'm curious if
1365.96s: there's any parallel between the way you
1368.36s: think about that or is it just a number
1369.62s: of occurrences thing no no there is a
1372.44s: parallel it's not in just number of
1373.76s: occurrences we look at it as as you know
1377.42s: probabilistically regardless of uh
1380.66s: regardless of whatever environment we're
1383.06s: in volatility wise probabilistically
1385.76s: everything you know strategy wise tends
1388.76s: to be the same regardless of the IV
1390.62s: environment but when you have an
1394.22s: opportunity to do something in higher IV
1396.26s: you can make more money and that
1398.48s: effectively means you know that's our
1400.46s: argument for pot odds you know from a
1402.50s: premium seller's perspective we also
1405.20s: like the concept of you know a very
1407.96s: subjective part of padas is is just
1410.24s: price extreme so you know our preference
1413.18s: is when something is up big to sell it
1415.04s: when something's down you know big to
1417.26s: buy it only because there is the
1420.02s: perception that you know maybe you know
1423.32s: there's there's something's down big
1424.76s: maybe it's got more upside the downside
1426.32s: and if something's up big maybe it's got
1428.54s: more downside than upside the reality of
1431.00s: that is that's a very tough argument to
1433.46s: prove because when something's up big it
1436.64s: still has the same chance of going up
1437.90s: higher than it does coming down we don't
1439.82s: necessarily believe in mean reversion on
1441.86s: price and it's the same thing on down
1444.14s: moves but at least it gives you again
1445.58s: it's another form of an engagement tool
1448.22s: the only thing that truly gives you a
1451.76s: real pot odds Advantage is is doing
1455.00s: certain things in incredibly High
1456.38s: implied volatility you take more risk
1457.94s: you make more money period right now
1462.08s: yeah I I think I saw a recent segment
1464.36s: where you guys were talking about price
1465.92s: mean reversion
1467.66s: um and I I definitely am the counter
1470.06s: side to that I definitely think that
1471.62s: their short-term price mean reversion
1473.18s: but I'm more curious about your
1476.00s: perspective so if you're a contrarian
1478.46s: but you don't believe in short-term
1480.80s: price mean reversion isn't that a
1482.78s: contradiction yeah it is okay fair
1485.84s: enough
1486.94s: it is but there's a big difference
1489.02s: between a short-term trade and you know
1492.56s: it is a contradiction it is a
1494.90s: contradiction but it's it's it's the
1498.32s: whole the whole idea of being a
1500.00s: contrarian
1501.20s: it this stems back to this stems back to
1504.56s: our days on the floor when you're
1506.72s: essentially the counterparty to
1507.98s: everything somebody else wants to do so
1510.32s: the the misconception about Floor
1512.30s: Traders is that is that you're just
1514.76s: you're trading based on what you think
1516.08s: the Market's going to do and that's not
1518.00s: how it works Floor Traders it
1521.42s: all they did was take the other side of
1523.46s: orders so it you don't come in in the
1526.76s: morning with an opinion of the marks
1528.08s: going up or down you you go in the pit
1530.48s: in the morning and the first person if
1531.86s: the first order is to sell calls you buy
1533.42s: them and the first orders to buy calls
1535.82s: you sell them and then you work around
1537.68s: those trades over the course of the day
1539.36s: and that's how you basically make her
1541.28s: lose you know money so you do not
1543.74s: control what you want to do you
1546.08s: basically participate in what the other
1547.88s: side of everything so the whole idea of
1551.42s: being a counterparty
1552.98s: stuck with me my entire career and to
1555.14s: this day you know I effectively look at
1557.54s: myself as the counterparty whatever you
1559.76s: want to do I'll take the other side as
1561.92s: long as you give me a little bit of edge
1564.44s: um I dig it so that's not really kind of
1568.40s: the classic
1569.66s: that's not necessarily meaner version
1571.76s: it's more about just playing the role of
1574.52s: the counterparty right you mentioned
1577.82s: something that I'm actually really
1578.78s: curious about just from like a case
1581.12s: study perspective but how would you
1582.56s: manage your book throughout the day so
1584.12s: as you're taking obviously order flow
1585.86s: you're taking an inventory you have like
1587.90s: because there's no room on the floor
1589.76s: right so are you just like legit
1591.62s: memorizing this stuff or do you have
1592.88s: like a piece of paper that you were like
1594.14s: what's the method both piece of paper
1596.42s: and piece of paper and memorizing you
1598.58s: you'd be surprised that your capacity to
1603.14s: um to know like you know what you're
1605.42s: doing
1606.92s: um Traders had Floor Traders we have
1610.04s: very one-dimensional brains like you
1613.28s: know these were not you know most of us
1615.98s: I'm including myself in this group we're
1618.20s: not very deep thinkers but when it came
1621.56s: to frac adding and subtracting fractions
1625.58s: and memorizing thousands of Trades and
1628.52s: positions you're like a savant and so
1631.82s: you can you can literally make I don't
1635.00s: know there are days probably made I made
1636.32s: 500 or a thousand trades easy and I can
1639.20s: remember everything I did with every
1640.94s: person I did it with and how it affected
1642.80s: every single position I had on and you
1645.08s: you almost you know surprisingly almost
1647.54s: never make a mistake
1649.22s: and that sounds like probably a source
1651.08s: of your Edge right because then it
1652.40s: speeds up your ability to make decisions
1654.20s: more quickly everything on what comes
1656.06s: out everything is speed so you know
1659.42s: there there was there's no way in that
1662.30s: business to be successful if you weren't
1664.52s: fast the the fastest person the the
1668.00s: fastest person got everything and you
1670.52s: had to be fast and you couldn't you know
1673.22s: the whole thing was fast and don't don't
1676.34s: think about it there's nothing to think
1677.72s: about
1678.56s: you know you had to just be fast it's
1681.02s: one of the the great parallels I
1682.94s: honestly see between like military
1684.56s: members and investing in trading it's
1686.84s: that like we always talk about you know
1689.12s: making an 80 decision now executed
1692.06s: violently is better than 100 decision
1694.10s: later down the line it's like a lot of
1696.08s: these same you know parallels yeah of
1698.60s: course if you wait for the 100 decision
1700.88s: you're basically out of business
1702.86s: right you know there's no there there is
1705.32s: no there's no way to there's nobody who
1708.98s: creates wealth with 100 decisions I mean
1712.46s: you know I I do a whole I do a speech on
1716.78s: on this topic and the difference between
1720.38s: and it's one of my favorite talks to
1722.96s: give because the difference between
1725.44s: success one you know the difference
1728.12s: between two people that are virtually
1730.22s: the same person
1731.54s: and the difference between one person
1733.58s: being successful and the next person not
1736.16s: being and they basically do everything
1737.66s: the same it's it essentially comes down
1740.96s: to this very marginal difference between
1744.56s: person a and person B incredibly
1746.86s: marginal difference and and the marginal
1750.14s: difference is based on longevity and
1752.60s: Longevity is just the ability to stay in
1755.60s: the game longer than everybody else
1757.34s: because it's not when it really boils
1760.46s: down to it we're not we're talking about
1762.14s: milliseconds and we're talking about
1764.42s: everybody being smart everybody being
1767.18s: having the same personality the same
1768.80s: kind of skill set and the real
1771.26s: difference is just like you know it's a
1773.48s: bloop single it's a couple of bloop
1775.94s: singles you know one one batter has six
1778.82s: bloop singles and that's 302 and the
1781.28s: other batter is has gets robbed you know
1784.22s: six times over the course of the year
1785.78s: and they bet you know 256 and it's just
1789.38s: it's basically 12 or 15 at bats that
1791.66s: make the whole difference and it's it's
1793.58s: crazy but trading is very similar and
1796.76s: it's it's a longevity game and it's fast
1800.00s: decision making and it's and it's
1802.46s: whoever makes the decision that's
1805.28s: willing to accept essentially the lowest
1808.46s: odds so like if you think it's if it's
1810.44s: 50 50 you don't make it if it's 70 30
1814.10s: you make it and if somebody jumps in
1816.56s: front of you and does the 6832 and
1818.90s: they're right they make it more you know
1821.60s: and if somebody waits for 80 20 in their
1823.94s: favor which is great but they might not
1825.98s: make enough they might get enough trades
1827.72s: they might not be successful enough it
1829.70s: might not be worth it for waiting for
1831.20s: that person that waits for 100 forget it
1833.06s: they're out of business
1834.20s: right
1835.40s: so when you're making this distinction
1839.12s: between speed to decision how do you
1841.46s: balance the idea of making a quick
1843.38s: decision but also not making a bad
1846.02s: decision right yeah
1847.48s: so so the answer to that is there are
1849.92s: there's no such thing you know there's
1851.96s: no such thing as you you cannot you
1854.84s: cannot think about making a bad decision
1856.40s: because bad decisions are just it's a
1860.60s: fact in an efficient world you are going
1863.60s: to make X number of bad decisions you
1866.18s: just have to make way more good
1868.22s: decisions than bad decisions you know
1870.14s: people talk to us all the time when we
1872.60s: give talks about you know
1874.28s: entrepreneurship and success and things
1876.08s: like that and they say you know like
1878.24s: what what's your what's your real
1880.16s: differentiator like like why why you
1882.56s: guys or why you
1884.24s: and the answer is always because we
1888.50s: take risk at every opportunity we get no
1890.90s: matter what like even if we don't really
1894.20s: want to do it we do it like every single
1896.36s: chance you have to take risk you should
1898.28s: as long as it's not like stupid stuff
1900.44s: you know like as long as you're not
1901.40s: risking your life type thing but if it's
1903.92s: a reasonable play where you could just
1905.48s: assess some kind of probabilistic
1907.64s: outcome that's in your favor to it you
1909.20s: do it
1910.76s: and then some stuff's not going to work
1912.68s: it's okay it doesn't work
1915.20s: well and it seems like it's actually
1917.36s: funny a lot of what you talk about it
1919.16s: reminds me of stoicism I don't know if
1920.48s: you practice any of that but you you
1922.28s: have a lot of those tenants at least
1923.84s: baked into what you're talking about
1925.04s: because one of the things is
1927.26s: um you know reviewing past decisions for
1929.84s: observing an outcome seeing you know
1931.88s: kind of postmortem but not dwelling on
1934.04s: it and I think that that's one of the
1935.42s: things I see happen with a lot of
1937.16s: Traders is there's this tremendous
1939.62s: dwelling cycle where if something goes
1941.54s: poorly now they're you know kind of in
1943.88s: this vicious cycle of thinking of
1946.22s: everything they did wrong and then it
1947.48s: kind of makes it very difficult to make
1949.64s: a good decision going forward do you
1951.68s: think Traders overcome that by just kind
1954.80s: of embracing this decision cycle is it
1956.66s: successful Detachment from their
1957.86s: investing Capital like what kind of
1959.54s: things go into being able to accept a
1962.48s: bad decision that was made apply the
1964.46s: Learning lesson and move on
1966.38s: well I think yeah it's all of the above
1969.02s: I don't think it's you know it's not
1971.12s: necessarily just Traders there's great
1972.62s: entrepreneurs that are able to you know
1974.66s: accomplish the same thing
1976.76s: um you know the where they they don't
1979.04s: dwell on you know they can't they don't
1981.50s: dwell and they can't dwell the losers
1982.94s: and they have to you know
1985.34s: um they have to build off their their
1987.26s: good decisions their winning decisions I
1989.00s: I do think that life is
1992.60s: um that success is really success in
1994.70s: life is a byproduct of the number of
1997.82s: decisions that you make because
1999.74s: eventually if you get comfortable you
2002.56s: can scale your decision making and so
2004.30s: you know you end up which is kind of
2006.64s: what happened to us is that
2008.98s: we start off making you know tens of
2011.68s: thousands of trading decisions but then
2013.78s: you get to a point where you start to
2015.28s: say okay you know this some of this
2017.56s: decisions now are going to go beyond
2018.82s: trading and they're going to go into
2020.20s: building a business and they're going to
2021.40s: go into doing other things and what we
2023.62s: found is that most of the time when we
2027.16s: made decisions to do other things they
2029.14s: worked out as well
2030.70s: which is crazy but we we had no idea
2033.04s: that that's the way everything worked
2034.78s: but we figured it out that the more
2036.70s: decisions you make the more good
2038.68s: decisions you make
2041.20s: I think that that follows up with every
2043.78s: bit of literature I've read on that from
2045.40s: a psychological perspective because we
2046.84s: read a lot of decision cycle stuff
2048.52s: especially like Marine officers right we
2049.84s: spend a lot of time learning things like
2051.34s: boys decision cycle we read things like
2053.92s: blank all that kind of stuff anyways
2055.36s: just a lot of background really
2057.60s: amplifies that point and I think what
2060.22s: you highlight there succinctly has been
2062.26s: proven time and time again which is
2063.88s: really interesting it's like the law of
2065.26s: momentum it applies
2067.14s: it's easy to read about it's hard to
2069.64s: execute the challenge you know the
2071.56s: challenge that that you have is you have
2073.12s: to put yourself in a position where you
2075.40s: can execute it and that's that's the
2077.44s: challenge because if you're too young
2079.48s: you don't have enough experience you
2081.28s: don't have enough Capital to withstand
2083.44s: you know the volatility of those
2085.06s: decisions early on and and if you wait
2087.52s: too long you know you kind of miss that
2090.40s: that that opportunistic you know
2093.16s: um uh your your chance you missed that
2097.24s: window and so you know there there's
2099.82s: there's there's a pretty big window
2101.14s: maybe it's 10 20 30 40 years but it's
2105.28s: you know
2106.96s: there's a lot of things that have to
2108.34s: play out but you you have to make those
2110.26s: decisions like the other thing I impress
2112.42s: upon everybody is just you know make as
2114.16s: many damn decisions as you can you know
2115.90s: speculate take risks make as many
2117.94s: decisions as you can it never comes back
2119.68s: to haunt you and I'm not talking about
2121.12s: dumb ass stuff like I'm not talking
2122.92s: about going to a casino and betting you
2124.90s: know on the roulette you know on the
2126.46s: roulette wheel it's that's not it we're
2128.02s: talking about other things where you
2130.06s: know where you're not giving up odds to
2132.10s: the house
2133.30s: right so you guys recently sold
2137.32s: um tastytrade to ig I saw you know
2139.72s: obviously well not super recently but
2141.46s: you know two years ago we sold it two
2143.20s: years ago yes semi recently it was a
2145.24s: huge deal it was like a 1.1 billion
2147.52s: dollar deal
2149.14s: um and I'm just fascinated on how that
2153.22s: deal even works so obviously I've read
2155.38s: all about it but like from a behind the
2159.10s: curtains perspective does somebody give
2161.02s: you a call do you give somebody a call
2162.70s: to even start this conversation like how
2164.68s: does it because I'll never see that kind
2166.42s: of deal so I'm so curious how it goes
2168.58s: down
2170.02s: well surprisingly in my life it's
2172.12s: happened multiple times so like so I've
2175.06s: I've gotten you know so it doesn't
2176.80s: surprise me anymore but the funny thing
2179.50s: about so so I should tell you first
2181.90s: about us I have we have this rule it's
2185.38s: called a no high five rule which is
2187.72s: which is we we don't ever
2191.80s: we're never impressed with what we do
2193.72s: like it's just you're supposed I always
2196.36s: say you're supposed to graduate
2197.38s: kindergarten well you're supposed to
2199.00s: build successful businesses but we we
2202.66s: never have an exit strategy I I when
2205.54s: somebody builds something and they tell
2206.68s: me they have an exit strategy I get
2208.54s: really nervous about what they're
2209.74s: building because then they're focusing
2211.54s: strategy we never have an exit strategy
2214.66s: we're just Traders so if somebody's
2217.96s: willing to pay us maybe more than we
2221.44s: think we're worth we'll listen and
2223.30s: that's an exit strategy but until that
2225.28s: happens you know there is nothing when
2228.58s: we sold think or swim there were three
2231.76s: companies bidding for us in cash but for
2233.86s: the prior 10 years like we basically
2236.56s: didn't have a single person talk to us
2237.94s: when we sold tasty
2240.46s: for we built in 2011 we sold it in 2021.
2243.58s: for 10 years not one person talked to us
2247.30s: about tasty not one person not one firm
2250.30s: not one anybody talk to us about tasty
2252.58s: like not nobody nobody had any interest
2254.74s: in The Firm whatsoever they're like what
2256.42s: are you doing this is a crazy idea this
2258.16s: is this and this blah blah you know all
2260.38s: the same crap
2261.64s: the only person that invested in US was
2264.22s: a firm that had invested in thinkerson
2266.68s: they made so much money that they were
2268.54s: like we'll invest in anything you want
2269.74s: to do so it wasn't like and they were
2271.90s: like they were like we hate this idea
2273.88s: like you're building a financial Network
2276.34s: none of this makes any sense we would
2279.04s: never invest in this in a million years
2280.56s: except we're just investing in you
2282.64s: that's all
2284.20s: so
2286.06s: so it even worked out better for them
2287.68s: than the first trade but but the
2289.78s: interesting thing is that we
2294.10s: 10 years in just like the first time 10
2296.44s: years in
2297.94s: um which is just weird that they both
2299.32s: happen 10 years in there was like all of
2302.32s: a sudden out of the woodwork like we
2304.36s: started some company reached out to us
2305.98s: then another company reached out to us
2307.30s: it's almost like all these investment
2308.56s: bankers talk to each other and then
2310.36s: another company and next thing you know
2312.28s: we had five people bidding for tasting
2314.38s: and when that happened
2316.24s: we knew we were like
2319.00s: and it was also the height of the SPAC
2320.92s: movement and everything else and at that
2322.72s: point we knew that there was a
2326.20s: likelihood that something might happen
2328.00s: because we had multiple bids for the
2330.16s: company and and we know we also knew
2333.16s: we're a great company so it wasn't like
2334.66s: you know it didn't shock us we're like
2336.34s: oh my God you know we wasn't we're like
2338.62s: we we built the best technology we have
2340.66s: one of the best companies in the world
2341.74s: for boutique brokerage you know Boutique
2343.66s: Financial Service firm so this shouldn't
2345.64s: be a shocker but
2347.32s: um but there were five companies bidding
2348.94s: for us and we kind of you know went
2351.40s: through a process of
2354.28s: um we took the second lowest bid
2356.80s: believe it or not because we didn't
2358.48s: trust the SPAC markets we thought they
2360.70s: were all and so I and I turned
2363.70s: out to be right
2365.20s: um and we went with a company that we
2368.44s: didn't really know much about but that
2371.86s: we felt that we could expand globally
2374.62s: with and they seem like nice people and
2376.96s: that's why you know I mean like you
2379.30s: don't actually know
2380.62s: but it seemed like the right time to do
2382.54s: a deal and you know 10 years into a
2385.72s: project you know you kind of you kind of
2388.06s: wanted
2388.78s: mix things up a little bit do something
2390.34s: a little different
2391.72s: sure especially if you think there's a
2393.46s: catalyst that can help you guys evolve
2395.08s: even faster so what were like some of
2397.72s: the primary questions you were asking
2399.82s: yourselves along the process like it
2401.80s: obviously the right partner is part of
2403.96s: the decision but it sounds like what's
2405.52s: the best Catalyst for you guys or is
2406.96s: there something else that you're
2407.68s: weighing heavily on
2410.02s: you know it's it's funny because you
2412.90s: don't really you you never know like
2415.84s: when you're making a deal with somebody
2416.86s: you really don't know a lot about the
2418.96s: other company I mean you know you can
2420.94s: read about them and you can you know you
2422.98s: can Google them and you can talk to
2424.24s: people that know them
2425.68s: but in on the one hand you're usually
2427.48s: betting on the CEO you know because
2430.06s: there's somebody that's ultimately
2431.14s: making a decision it's just CEO chairman
2432.94s: of the board and you know you're
2435.40s: listening to their story and on the one
2437.08s: hand you're like you know you're like oh
2438.94s: this sounds great because they're gonna
2440.14s: make it sound great the other hand
2441.22s: you're like hey if they live up to half
2443.26s: of what they said it's gonna be good
2445.84s: but the other part of it is you know
2448.48s: you're just kind of ready for a new
2450.22s: challenge
2451.06s: and in the world that we come from
2454.78s: every time we've done a deal We've Ended
2456.58s: up kind of taking over the new company
2458.32s: in the sense that you know our
2460.42s: personalities our egos our technology
2463.36s: has been very dominating
2465.58s: so we figured you know you know the
2467.74s: first thing we said to each other is
2468.88s: well we do this deal with IG next thing
2470.38s: you know you know they're going to
2472.00s: become they're going to become tasty
2473.68s: trade you know like that's how it works
2475.30s: in our mind
2476.68s: it hasn't happened but when we sold
2478.72s: bigger swim I always used to tell the
2480.28s: CEO of TD Ameritrade you know one day TD
2483.40s: merch is not going to be around and
2484.48s: you'll be called thinkerson and it
2485.92s: actually happened now thinkerson's still
2487.42s: there and Schwab on some but TD
2489.16s: ameritrade's gone so you know and I used
2492.10s: to joke with him and tell him that's
2493.24s: going to be what happens if you thought
2494.38s: I was out of my mind
2496.06s: um it's probably I'm probably not that
2499.30s: you know I mean maybe it's cocky maybe
2501.70s: it's whatever but
2503.56s: um listen I love what I do and I make
2506.92s: sure that you know they they bought an
2509.68s: amazing company I mean they paid you
2511.66s: know over a billion dollars for it but
2513.16s: they bought an amazing company and they
2515.38s: bought some amazing people and you know
2518.14s: um I you know we delivered that's for
2520.96s: sure
2522.10s: so if you could go back to when you were
2524.50s: first stepping on the trading floor time
2526.24s: machine and then you just get to tell
2527.92s: yourself you're gonna sell a company for
2529.66s: a billion dollars and you know 20 30
2531.64s: years what would your initial response
2533.62s: to that have been
2535.00s: my whole goal when I got to the trading
2536.98s: floor I I remember to this day I said
2539.56s: because I didn't you know I mean when I
2543.64s: came to the trading floor we I scrounged
2545.86s: to borrow fifty thousand dollars you
2547.84s: know totally scrounged so it was like so
2550.48s: I thought fifty thousand dollars like a
2551.98s: million dollars but when I got to
2553.78s: trading floor my goal was to
2556.96s: put a million dollars in the bank
2559.24s: to own my house and to own my seat I
2562.12s: thought if I did that I would be forever
2565.18s: done like I I could do anything I want
2567.04s: in the whole world a million dollars in
2568.72s: the bank owned my house own my C and
2570.88s: they and nobody could ever touch me and
2573.40s: that was my objective when I first got
2575.80s: there you know for for a while
2579.10s: um and then I realized you know that at
2582.88s: Young stupid with lots of money you know
2585.16s: a million dollars didn't go very far
2587.80s: um even in the 80s so
2590.14s: um you know but whatever uh I never
2593.08s: thought
2595.06s: you know you never know how your life's
2596.92s: gonna play out we didn't build
2598.42s: thinkorswim until I was in my 40s I
2600.58s: didn't build tasty till we're in our 50s
2602.62s: so
2604.60s: um you never know you know like like I
2607.36s: have I would never do it any other way
2608.80s: like I have no regrets I love it the
2611.02s: whole deal
2612.52s: um
2613.12s: you know so no I I you know no I never
2616.42s: thought about it once
2618.16s: and when we built fingersome originally
2620.14s: I mean you know when we our we did our
2623.02s: first capital raise at 100 million
2624.34s: dollar evaluation and at that point I
2626.92s: was like this is crazy like why is
2628.90s: somebody buying what we built why is
2630.64s: somebody investing at a 100 million
2631.90s: dollar valuation like it just I couldn't
2633.40s: process it
2635.56s: I bet and then so you guys are in the
2639.58s: process of you know obviously still
2641.26s: growing tasty you guys are still working
2642.94s: on a lot of stuff so what's the what's
2645.94s: the roadmap for you guys going forward
2647.08s: are you just trying to promulgate this
2648.76s: to even a wider degree have more people
2651.10s: you know tuning in to what you guys are
2652.66s: working on and adopting your approach or
2654.34s: just kind of playing it day by day you
2656.56s: know
2657.76s: I really love what I do
2659.68s: so I hope I can do it you know I mean
2663.16s: obviously you know I'm probably the
2665.74s: largest share one of the largest
2666.94s: shareholders at IG we're a public
2668.44s: company in London so I fully I'm all in
2671.32s: and betting on ourselves for the next
2673.18s: you know however long it is
2675.58s: um so I clearly made my bed as a bet
2678.82s: um on what we're going to build and
2680.20s: accomplish over the next couple of years
2681.46s: but I really you know I could just pack
2686.14s: it in and go you know live on a mountain
2688.36s: or an island or whatever who cares
2690.52s: um but I don't have any interest in it
2692.08s: it's not like it's not me so I still
2695.68s: work like 12 hours a day and and I and I
2698.62s: love it and I hope to you know keep
2700.42s: doing it for until they literally until
2703.42s: they dragged me off the stage or you
2705.28s: know roll me into the dumpster or fire
2707.86s: my ass you know for being you know being
2711.04s: crazy or insubordinate or whatever old
2713.02s: and ornery yeah old and ornery and
2715.30s: everything else and um as long as we can
2718.36s: keep doing
2719.44s: what we do
2721.34s: [Music]
2722.02s: um
2723.04s: it's fascinating to me I'm I don't want
2725.02s: to you know I I don't want to do
2727.00s: anything else I love creating content I
2729.28s: love Building Technology
2731.38s: um I love building businesses it's fun
2733.20s: and I I can't see myself doing anything
2736.96s: else like I don't know what else I could
2739.12s: do
2740.68s: um
2741.52s: it's
2742.60s: every time I hear you speak and I have a
2744.70s: chance to talk to you like genuinely
2746.50s: it's very motivating to me because
2749.34s: it's for I grew up poor and
2752.50s: obviously I'm nowhere near you know the
2755.02s: degree of success you have but I'm
2757.12s: marginally from where I thought I was
2758.56s: going to end up I'm far more successful
2760.06s: than I had anticipated and for the
2763.12s: longest time it always felt good I
2765.04s: thought when I had a bunch of money that
2766.78s: I would just do nothing all day that I
2768.70s: would just because that sounds so good
2770.38s: you can't do it yeah and it's
2772.78s: fascinating to me to see somebody with
2775.18s: you you know obviously like a gajillion
2778.36s: times my level of success and you're
2780.52s: still like what's the next thing because
2783.16s: money is
2785.20s: stupid I I money has no purpose for me
2790.30s: um you know I own my house what what
2793.48s: else you know
2795.22s: we own our businesses you know I own I
2799.06s: have everything I need and
2801.94s: and I can't even spend the money I have
2803.98s: so I mean you know do I give it away you
2807.04s: know you know whatever who knows at the
2808.96s: end but
2810.58s: but money has no utility for me at all
2814.06s: um it doesn't mean the thing I mean it
2815.80s: allows me to have you know nice dinners
2818.86s: and stay in nice hotels somewhere maybe
2820.78s: go on a nice trip and you know it allows
2823.18s: me to have whatever I want which isn't
2825.40s: that much anyway but um but it doesn't
2828.88s: turn me on
2830.26s: so like you know the the most
2834.22s: fascinating the most interesting part of
2836.80s: my life at this point is I would love to
2841.48s: help a community of people that are
2844.66s: like-minded
2846.46s: um
2847.06s: you know build wealth how whatever that
2849.52s: means and I feel like if that's your
2852.10s: legacy then you really left something
2855.04s: special behind you know money can only
2857.26s: do so much and then beyond that you know
2859.96s: like there needs to be something maybe
2861.76s: it's for some people it's inspiration
2863.26s: maybe for somebody else there's real
2865.24s: skill you know I like to say in in one
2869.98s: of the
2870.88s: um speeches that I give I like to say
2874.60s: um over the years with everything that
2876.64s: we've done technology wise and Marcus
2879.04s: wise you know we've we've taken a lot of
2882.10s: people down in the sense that you know
2884.74s: there's no doubt in my mind that a lot
2887.20s: of people that have listened to us you
2889.30s: know because they've got involved in
2890.62s: stocks options Futures you know Futures
2893.32s: options crypto whatever else they've
2895.66s: lost a lot of money
2897.40s: over the years and I also think the
2900.58s: other side which is we've probably
2903.58s: created more wealth and more
2906.28s: millionaires and more we've more you
2909.58s: know success stories than anybody else
2911.56s: in the history of Finance so like is
2914.26s: that you know what does that mean you
2916.24s: know like like I will take you know this
2918.64s: crazy amount of outliers to the upside
2921.04s: you know I'm okay with that like with
2924.94s: some people losing and some people
2928.06s: winning huge like I've I've tried to
2931.84s: reduce the pool of mediocrity
2934.42s: and push people to either side because
2937.42s: that's what people want is an
2939.64s: opportunity to be an outlier and if it
2943.30s: doesn't work out it just doesn't work
2945.04s: out and if it does work out you know
2947.08s: we've done something incredible and I
2949.12s: don't think anybody else has ever done
2950.74s: that like as ever that's been their
2952.78s: focus and I think it's it's so damn
2955.12s: important that you know everybody's
2957.58s: always telling everybody you know think
2959.26s: about that decision be be conservative
2961.96s: be safe you know don't take the don't
2963.82s: risk The Nest Egg all this kind of crap
2966.10s: Iris the nest egg all the time I don't
2969.16s: give a crap and I think that even today
2971.44s: and I think it's super important for
2974.38s: people to hear another side to the story
2976.06s: that I think really does create wealth
2979.24s: and outlier wealth and and you know and
2981.76s: these crazy you know stories which you
2984.34s: know can everybody achieve it of course
2985.66s: not
2986.50s: but everybody couldn't achieve success
2988.18s: on the trading floor either you know
2989.44s: that was like you know three or five out
2991.48s: of a hundred you know is it's better
2993.34s: than that in the trading world the
2995.08s: online world but
2997.06s: um you know that's where I think our
2999.52s: Legacy is is different you know we we
3002.04s: encourage those you know that kind of
3004.20s: risk for for that kind of opportunity
3006.90s: well I feel like I I think last time I
3009.54s: told you this but I do feel like it's
3010.92s: important to reiterate it anyways and
3012.78s: give credit where credit is due because
3014.34s: I I started talking with you guys back I
3017.10s: want to say in like 2011 which is like I
3019.44s: think pretty early from when you guys
3020.64s: started yeah we started tasting about
3023.04s: 2011. yeah so I started talking to you
3025.68s: right after that that's back when I was
3027.60s: in college
3029.28s: um and I was already trading options for
3031.50s: a while before that but
3033.18s: the way that you talked about two things
3035.70s: still resonates with me and I'm 32 now
3038.46s: so the first one is taking risk right
3042.66s: the you're one of the the very few
3044.82s: voices I heard talking about accepting
3047.52s: risk as compared to risk avoidance that
3049.98s: always resonated with me and then the
3051.48s: second thing that you talked about is
3053.04s: nobody knows anything
3054.48s: and that is another one that I also had
3057.60s: like a a mentor that helped me a lot
3059.76s: with my trading that was an Army veteran
3062.46s: um but he used to say literally the same
3064.44s: exact line nobody knows anything and
3067.08s: between both of those things I I think
3069.24s: and hopefully you guys know this already
3071.04s: but at least from a personal perspective
3072.66s: that is a huge impact on at least the
3075.60s: way that I approached life I mean now
3077.34s: I'm at a point where I I pay for my
3079.86s: mom's house I pay for all of her
3081.48s: expenses and it's like some of the
3083.04s: things that you guys have taught me from
3084.48s: you know decade plus ago so I think the
3087.48s: message that's another thing though that
3089.22s: that's like that's the kind of story
3091.44s: that I love to hear this is the kind of
3093.48s: this is this is what we're trying to do
3096.42s: and this is what we want you know I want
3098.70s: my legacy to be is that there's a lot of
3101.52s: people out there like you and and like
3104.58s: thousands that have
3108.20s: your path has changed because of the
3111.66s: content and the technology that we've
3113.70s: created and to me that's really cool why
3116.10s: do I want to ever do anything else
3118.74s: yeah is well it is really cool and I
3121.50s: think that especially the scalability of
3123.48s: it there was another comment that you
3124.68s: made on another podcast that I thought
3126.60s: was fascinating because when I started
3128.46s: YouTube I
3129.96s: I had no aspirations for any of this I
3132.00s: don't have a face that belongs on a
3133.62s:  camera I'm not good at any of
3135.36s: this I love talking with people like
3136.74s: you're good you're good don't don't tell
3138.42s: yourself sure you're good at this good I
3140.76s: I would I think about the things that
3144.18s: I've learned and I hope other people can
3146.52s: kind of you know siphon out but I look
3149.64s: at what you guys have been able to do at
3151.32s: the scale and you were talking about the
3153.12s: content business versus the investing
3155.34s: education business so
3157.98s: what like how do you differentiate
3160.44s: between those two and obviously you saw
3162.72s: the scalability of the content business
3164.90s: which is fascinating to me
3167.52s: what I led you down
3170.24s: I felt investor education was
3173.94s: so a big part of creating tasty was
3177.78s: because I was so disenchanted with
3179.88s: investor education I saw investor
3182.40s: education
3184.44s: um as being a very static business and
3188.40s: also I don't like businesses that that
3191.60s: rely on basically static content or
3194.46s: static information it's almost it
3196.86s: reminds me of too much of like Academia
3200.04s: you can't change a curriculum because
3201.84s: it's too expensive well the same thing
3203.64s: investor education so the concept of
3205.86s: investor education I was never able to
3208.56s: buy into it I never wanted to own any
3211.32s: part of an of an investor education
3213.12s: company because I I felt like they're
3215.64s: all doomed to fail
3217.14s: but I felt like content was scalable and
3221.16s: content was was Dynamic it was always
3223.44s: changing and if we didn't worry about
3226.38s: like people always say well on tasty you
3229.02s: make it too hard to find this piece you
3230.70s: did seven years ago type of thing you
3232.38s: know you don't teach a course and I'm
3234.42s: like yeah that's intentional I didn't
3236.52s: want to build an investor education
3238.74s: platform I don't give a crap I wanted to
3241.62s: build you know I wanted to create as
3244.20s: much content as we could create and
3246.48s: throw it at you like push it through a
3248.10s: fire hose so you're overwhelmed with
3250.50s: content and we're always changing it and
3252.66s: if you don't like it just watch the next
3254.04s: day because it'll change and I don't
3255.90s: care what we said about two or three
3257.34s: days before because we're going to learn
3259.14s: more stuff and we're going to change
3260.28s: stuff and products are going to change
3261.54s: and so so I'm gonna build an investor
3265.38s: I'm gonna build a financial content
3267.50s: company that doesn't care about two
3271.26s: things that are traditional forget about
3273.24s: education for a second one is we're not
3275.22s: going to focus on
3276.78s: stupid ass news because news to me
3279.12s: anybody can buy news who cares there's
3281.34s: nothing too news and the second thing is
3283.26s: we're not going to focus on guests
3285.06s: because I don't care what other people
3286.44s: have to say because you're just gonna
3288.06s: mess up
3289.32s: all the all the money I spend on
3291.12s: research and everything else I don't
3292.74s: care what you think because what you
3294.90s: think is not what our research says so
3297.24s: your opinion doesn't mean anything to me
3298.68s: so and so no news no guess that was the
3302.64s: whole thing it's all going to be our own
3304.34s: homegrown Think Tank based quantitative
3307.38s: content and you know and and people are
3310.32s: like
3310.98s: Tom that is so dumb so insane nobody's
3317.10s: gonna watch you guys talk about the
3319.02s: stuff and I'm like okay then they won't
3321.18s: watch we'll we'll fall flat in our face
3323.46s: if that's the case but I never believed
3325.50s: that was the case I thought I thought
3327.72s: people would eat up the idea of you know
3331.62s: of aggressive
3334.02s: um uh quantitative content we don't dumb
3337.08s: anything down I wanted to make build a
3339.78s: network around challenging people with
3341.52s: tough things and it freaking worked
3344.52s: it does and I think another thing that
3347.16s: you guys do really well still though is
3349.44s: you make very seemingly challenging
3352.98s: problem sets more consumable and
3355.14s: especially the way you talk about them
3356.46s: which I think is uh no question about
3358.50s: that no question it's yeah it's a
3360.84s: tremendous skill you have so one of the
3362.88s: things I wanted to kind of get your take
3365.22s: on is you've found what I consider to be
3368.16s: one of the best balance acts between
3370.52s: theoretical understanding of things but
3372.54s: then the practical application of it
3374.52s: yeah how did you develop that and then I
3377.34s: can see it through all of the pieces you
3379.50s: put out that you still integrated but
3381.18s: how did you develop that
3383.16s: well we
3385.44s: we kind of backed into it so first of
3388.74s: all
3389.60s: one of my skills one of my skills is
3394.92s: making very complex I just did a a talk
3398.58s: in front of a group of um it was a it
3401.34s: was um
3402.48s: kind of like a not a seminar it was um
3405.66s: it was this educational event for pH PhD
3409.38s: students in business from all over the
3411.24s: world to fly to this one event so they
3412.68s: could have this kind of Symposium and I
3415.62s: was the keynote speaker and I was my
3417.78s: topic was essentially making complex
3421.02s: topics simple because they're like you
3423.90s: know that's the problem with most phds
3426.72s: and most talks is that nobody really has
3429.60s: no it's very rare skill set to make
3431.70s: really complex Financial topics simple
3434.40s: there's no way to make a Black Shoals
3436.62s: discussion crazy simple so
3439.44s: so we're good at it but and we realize
3442.44s: that you know over over time we started
3445.26s: to build tasty we recognized I kind of
3447.36s: knew it going in but but we've really
3449.22s: worked on that on that skill but I think
3452.88s: that you know it wasn't just about
3455.70s: making complex topics simple and
3457.62s: integrating that in we also decided very
3460.68s: early on that that Finance people could
3464.64s: take Finance in small doses but other
3466.56s: than that it's it's it's kind of boring
3468.42s: and you know it's very hard to get
3470.52s: people to really that interested in in
3473.88s: finance that they can watch it all day
3475.44s: long all the time and all that kind of
3476.70s: stuff so we decided that we're going to
3479.46s: integrate personalities we're going to
3481.14s: make this about us and we're going to
3483.30s: make this about our personalities we're
3484.68s: going to make this around you know
3486.36s: everything from what did you have for
3488.40s: lunch to you know to you know
3491.40s: um did you you know what'd you do last
3493.68s: night you know to to are you talking to
3495.96s: your wife type thing you're like we we
3498.00s: were going to be
3499.50s: the rule we had at Tasty was if you come
3502.44s: to work for the network nothing is off
3504.90s: limits like your life is out there like
3508.98s: my wife used to be when we first started
3510.48s: she'd be like listen I don't like this
3512.40s: I'm private I don't want anybody to know
3514.08s: about and I'm like listen this is what
3515.88s: we're doing this this is it you know
3517.38s: like I'll try to leave you as out of it
3519.12s: as much as I can but this is our Network
3521.28s: everything is on the table you know this
3523.68s: is this is what we do and by doing that
3527.76s: um you know I felt there there was a it
3530.70s: would change a little bit about the
3532.98s: world of finance and we would make
3534.30s: finance a combination of complex topics
3537.54s: but also people would want to you know
3540.18s: they get to like you they want to they
3542.22s: want to know who you are they want to
3543.60s: they want to be with you you know they
3545.28s: they want to listen to you you know I
3547.14s: listen to like Stern for like 30 years
3550.74s: and you know and I used to be like you
3552.84s: know my favorite thing about Stern is
3554.34s: not even listening to stern it was
3556.26s: always like listening to all the crazies
3559.14s: that work for him it's the same as
3561.00s: everybody I'm no different than anybody
3562.62s: else you know like I could listen to him
3564.96s: you know to to guys like Sal governale
3568.02s: you know talk for five hours straight
3570.06s: even though it's the most it's the
3572.70s: dumbest most ridiculous stuff I've ever
3574.56s: heard like I'd sit there in my car and
3576.78s: just start laughing I'm
3578.16s: and be fascinated by it and and there
3580.80s: was nothing to take away from other than
3582.42s: a smile
3583.56s: but I figured you know to a certain
3585.24s: extent you know we can we can create not
3588.84s: the same thing but in the world of
3590.76s: Finance we can be personalities and we
3593.94s: can have a relationship with our with
3596.64s: our viewers and that we don't care about
3599.10s: how much money you have or how much you
3601.14s: trade or you know how much you love us
3603.90s: or hate us you know every day I have
3605.94s: people write to me and say you know like
3607.98s: you know we're we're a we're we're not a
3611.64s: political firm at all but we definitely
3613.56s: you know wear our
3615.96s: um where we kind of wear our colors on
3618.42s: our sleeve and and we're not the same as
3621.60s: everybody else in the world of finance
3623.22s: and yet people still watch us no matter
3625.92s: what side of the fence you're on
3627.54s: everything else you know people like
3629.16s: they'll argue with us and they'll be
3630.60s: like hey you guys are insane I think
3632.76s: you're crazy I can't believe you think
3634.38s: like that but this the other side to it
3636.48s: is they still listen every day and we
3638.58s: still have this relationship and we're
3639.78s: still friends and you know we've built
3642.42s: this crazy relationship with hundreds of
3645.24s: thousands of people over the last two
3647.52s: decades which is
3649.88s: incredibly unique in finance it doesn't
3652.80s: exist anywhere like there's no place in
3655.74s: the world of Finance where anybody knows
3657.60s: who a CEO is in the financial world or
3659.70s: has a relationship emails or live shows
3662.10s: or whatever else it is you know it just
3663.96s: doesn't exist it does not exist in
3665.94s: finance and a tasty it exists
3668.76s: I was telling my wife
3670.68s: um we were on a walk last night and I
3673.14s: told her you know that I was
3674.22s: interviewing today I was stoked to chat
3676.08s: with you again and I was telling her
3677.28s: about how you know I would email you
3679.08s: right and obviously you're you're insane
3681.60s: with your emails that you still have you
3685.32s: still send a lot of emails oh yeah to
3688.02s: people and she asked she was just like
3690.24s: how does he do that like how many emails
3692.34s: does he do a day so from my wife Mel to
3695.22s: you how do you do that and how many
3697.26s: emails do you send a day
3699.90s: no I can't tell you because you would
3702.36s: you would Ser you'd have me
3704.70s: you'd probably have me committed like
3708.30s: you would have
3710.12s: you would have some institution here
3713.52s: with a truck in a few minutes like
3715.98s: basically you know putting me in a
3718.08s: straight jacket and taking me away
3720.48s: um it's a sickness
3723.00s: um I've been doing it now for 24 years
3727.38s: um you know people are are cool about it
3730.32s: but hundreds easily hundreds but I'm
3733.86s: good about
3735.18s: like I only email back and forth with
3737.64s: customers like in other words like
3739.98s: Professionals in the industry like I
3741.84s: don't do professional events or I don't
3743.46s: I'm very careful about avoiding the
3746.22s: professional stuff I only want to deal
3748.20s: with customers because my relationship
3749.82s: is with with our customers I don't care
3752.04s: about you know anything else like
3754.26s: everybody else cares about you know
3755.34s: their professional relationships they
3756.60s: care about you know all this other stuff
3758.94s: you know employee relationships
3760.98s: everything else I don't care about our
3762.06s: customers
3763.56s: I do it's insane but it's a stupid it's
3766.26s: part of me that just it I broke I broke
3769.38s: something and I can't fix it it's one of
3772.08s: the things that I I still Revere that
3774.96s: about you though especially because
3777.84s: um one of the reasons why I started my
3779.46s: YouTube channel was inspired by you guys
3781.98s: and the fact that I really feel like at
3784.38s: least from like a YouTube and social
3785.82s: media side of stuff that there's just
3787.74s: such an obscene amount of out
3789.90s: there that there's not people just
3791.76s: talking about like no like not everybody
3794.76s: gets a Lamborghini overnight as soon as
3796.98s: you start trading zero DTE SPX credit
3799.38s: spreads like it's just good luck
3801.60s: man yeah um totally agree we we we're
3806.04s: very careful not to even you know I mean
3808.44s: we trade all the time on air and do
3810.06s: stuff like that but we don't you know we
3812.10s: we never talk about money you know like
3814.62s: we'll talk about winners and losers
3815.88s: sometimes we we try to talk way more
3817.50s: about losers but we it's part of our
3820.26s: culture you know real Traders only talk
3822.24s: about losers never winners but um yeah
3824.88s: we we never talk about money because
3826.44s: it's you know because everybody knows
3828.78s: you're a joke immediately because it's
3830.40s: it's such a hard business you know
3832.80s: um that uh it's just not we didn't want
3837.00s: to be about it's not about that
3838.62s: right another thing I wanted to ask you
3841.20s: and then I'll I'll get you out of here I
3842.76s: know it's getting a little bit later
3843.60s: your time but I really am curious about
3845.94s: this you have one of the most like
3849.24s: information and data open dispositions
3851.88s: that I've seen a lot of people I find as
3854.82s: they find their way over time they kind
3858.48s: of are completely reluctant to not
3860.70s: necessarily adopt but even hear other
3862.74s: perspectives yet you have a team that I
3865.92s: see you debate with them sometimes you
3867.48s: agree sometimes you don't but like on a
3870.00s: daily basis you receive new information
3872.22s: from people openly
3874.44s: how do you get to that point where you
3877.32s: know what you do Works you're confident
3879.30s: in what you do but you're still willing
3880.98s: to hear the conversation
3883.44s: we have
3884.82s: like an in-house think tank with some
3888.12s: incredibly brilliant kids I say they're
3890.76s: kids but they're probably you know late
3893.10s: 20s early 30s you know they're all you
3896.46s: know from phds down to mathematicians
3898.74s: down to like
3900.06s: brilliant you know and you know I
3903.96s: encourage them to
3906.42s: um they're encouraged to create their
3908.46s: own content that we use on air
3910.98s: um and I don't I don't want to
3913.74s: discourage them from trying to uh you
3919.08s: know trying to dispute something trying
3920.88s: to find holes in what we do you know I
3923.58s: think it's really important that that
3925.62s: they they have to believe they have to
3927.72s: buy in on their own
3929.34s: um they have to they have to do the
3930.66s: research themselves tomorrow I know this
3933.06s: podcast will be it'll be this podcast
3934.86s: will be later than than I'm not sure
3937.14s: when you're gonna play the podcast but
3939.72s: um tomorrow we're actually debating at
3941.94s: nine o'clock tomorrow morning we're
3943.74s: doing a debate with you know two
3945.36s: different phds and and and some others
3947.94s: on um on mean reversion and price and I
3950.70s: can't wait to do it tomorrow uh because
3952.74s: you know I'm I'm saying there is there
3955.50s: is no such thing and you know one of the
3957.60s: other phds is saying there is one of the
3959.52s: other phds is saying there isn't one of
3961.44s: the other crazy smart mathematicians we
3963.30s: have saying there is and so we're
3965.22s: getting into a debate on on uh you know
3968.22s: meaner version on price only on tasty
3970.14s: would you ever get a debate about mean
3971.88s: version on price from a bunch of you
3974.70s: know PhD Geeks
3976.98s: that's actually awesome I 100 will watch
3979.32s: that and then I mean you could always
3980.82s: bring some boxing gloves right and if it
3982.86s: doesn't get settled there you could just
3984.36s: have people box it out a little bit and
3986.52s: then then we move on
3988.02s: yeah we could do that
3989.70s: um I usually with math phds the boxing
3992.34s: thing isn't that exciting yeah
3995.52s: um but uh
3997.80s: um yeah you know like yeah I mean I've
4001.04s: reached a point where
4002.60s: you know I'm still learning
4005.12s: um it's it's little things little tweaks
4007.52s: things like that but
4009.44s: um we're still learning and and I think
4011.66s: it's cool that we get to keep presenting
4013.58s: you know that's the beautiful thing
4015.44s: about
4016.58s: um Dynamic content it every single day
4018.92s: it just keeps getting better and I see
4021.02s: no reason that it will ever you know
4023.18s: they will ever go the other direction I
4024.86s: mean we just keep finding more content
4027.14s: to to talk about every single day in the
4029.72s: trading world and it's you know as long
4031.46s: as there's new products there'll be new
4032.66s: content
4034.10s: well and I also think it's really cool
4035.96s: that you guys iterate on things because
4038.06s: what I find at least again on typical
4040.64s: like Financial social media space if
4043.10s: somebody says I think stock XYZ is going
4045.26s: to go up and then somehow later they
4047.48s: change their opinion for whatever reason
4048.86s: and they're like well I think XYZ is
4050.72s: going to go down everybody would jump
4051.80s: down their throat and they would say
4053.48s: well how could you switch your opinion
4054.82s: you know I always look at that and I
4056.84s: always think well
4057.92s: wouldn't you change your opinion of new
4059.72s:  information comes out like
4061.46s: what's the point of being so entrenched
4063.50s: that you refuse new data and I genuinely
4067.22s: have been super impressed watching you
4068.60s: over the last decade and the way that
4070.58s: you still stay sensitive to new
4072.38s: information because it's that's a skill
4074.36s: in and of itself to stay open to stuff
4076.46s: like that I think
4077.78s: yeah I mean we're open to certain things
4080.18s: like new information on the markets I'm
4081.86s: open to yeah like I'm not going to
4084.02s: change my opinion of you know of social
4086.48s: issues I'm not going to change my
4088.04s: opinion of of different things in in the
4090.20s: world or at least I I doubt I will but
4092.84s: um with respect to you know
4095.90s: um mechanical optimization of the world
4098.06s: of Finance I mean why wouldn't I be
4101.08s: completely open all the time you know
4104.12s: we've learned some things in the last uh
4106.46s: 12 years that are just they're they'll
4109.16s: blow you away like you know numbers wise
4111.38s: they would blow me away I wish I'd known
4112.70s: these you know 40 years ago but I didn't
4114.26s: have any idea so
4116.90s: um I I feel like yeah that that game's
4119.72s: you know the learning game never stops
4121.52s: and I also think it makes us it makes us
4124.40s: more interesting more more real more
4126.74s: approachable
4128.06s: um the fact that we're not you know like
4130.34s: we're open to being we're open to debate
4133.10s: we're open to being told that you know
4135.50s: hey you should look at it this way you
4138.20s: should do this this way you know one of
4140.36s: the things I've learned from doing tasty
4141.86s: is that is that everybody is smart
4145.18s: everybody's smart like the idea that you
4148.22s: know like you know sometimes you get you
4149.90s: watch the news and you get to lose
4151.04s: discouraged you're like man we are the
4152.66s: dumbest freaking country in the world
4154.10s: you know and it's and you start to think
4155.84s: you know and you start to get down on it
4157.52s: because you're like
4158.84s: how can we be this dumb as a as a
4161.00s: country and then and then yet you know
4162.92s: then you go back and you watch tasty and
4164.54s: you're like you know what all these
4166.58s: people are so damn smart and everybody
4168.86s: that you know that you know damn I I
4171.62s: just can't believe you know how
4174.98s: the kind of stuff that people understand
4177.14s: are able to grasp and and they're able
4179.78s: to you know the logic makes so much
4181.58s: sense that you know then I'm I I have
4184.22s: this this kind of renewed you know Vigor
4187.46s: and belief in what we you know in in
4189.26s: society and and all the good that can
4192.20s: happen so yeah I I have to you know we
4195.86s: have to think that way
4197.30s: yeah well I think it's a Hallmark of
4199.52s: what you guys do as compared to a lot of
4201.14s: other things so I think it's cool that
4202.94s: you guys keep sharing it but
4205.04s: um honestly another awesome conversation
