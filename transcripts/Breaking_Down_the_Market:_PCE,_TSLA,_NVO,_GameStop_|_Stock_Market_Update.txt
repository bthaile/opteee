2.08s: quick market update I got three things
3.56s: on the agenda as you can tell it's a
4.88s: little bit dark I'm on the mobile setup
6.92s: we're actually hanging out right by uh
8.92s: Central Park getting ready to fly back
11.04s: to San Diego but wanted to wrap the week
12.80s: up with you all because there was a
13.76s: little bit going on and I did a video
16.28s: after the Fed rate release on Wednesday
18.44s: which is pretty interesting and today we
19.76s: got some new data so I want to talk
22.36s: about the market as a whole and then I
24.48s: want to talk about Tesla GameStop and
26.92s: Nova those would be the main tickers
28.56s: we're going to dive into so first things
30.92s: first from a broad Market perspective it
33.92s: looks like we're still in this rotation
36.92s: phase I've talked about we can see
39.12s: broader breath indicators like net highs
41.44s: lows for Q's for New York Stock Exchange
45.04s: still rolling over even expanding still
46.96s: to the downside Advanced decline
49.16s: cumulative average negative sloping on a
51.56s: 50 period moving average and just
54.16s: starting to tick up a little bit vix is
56.36s: down some the main note here is it's
59.12s: just rotation like we're seeing names
61.80s: rebounding a little bit this is actually
64.04s: one of the best possible times to go
66.48s: through and see which names are not
69.48s: participating within the sector level
71.48s: rebounds because it can help you find
74.00s: short ideas things that are showing
75.72s: weakness the other thing you can look
77.12s: for are things that didn't rebound quite
79.88s: as much as others so you can see that in
83.12s: effect across the board whereas stuff
85.00s: like xlk had a really strong rally today
88.36s: um there's other names that didn't quite
90.32s: rally as much like XLE energy still
92.56s: showing weakness so lots of interesting
94.52s: ideas out there as per usual but um yeah
98.48s: I I think I want to spend a little more
100.48s: time just talking about what the market
102.92s: is seeing RIT large so we can see today
106.92s: that the market had a bit of an
108.96s: emotional roller coaster and pce which
111.76s: is a really big inflation gauge for the
114.56s: FED it's actually a little bit light and
118.00s: we can see that it's 2.4% on uh annual
121.08s: basis compared to 2.5 that was massive
125.24s: and this is essentially what fueled most
127.12s: of the rally today because we saw the
129.40s: FED not all that long ago ones they
131.44s: saying that they're probably going to
132.72s: roll out rate cuts a little
135.56s: slower and the market doesn't like that
138.44s: because the market is looking for
139.72s: instant gratification kind of like a kid
141.84s: looking for a sugar high and they want
144.20s: all of the good stuff right now the
145.76s: problem obviously with doing something
147.52s: like that is it bodess a lot of issues
150.20s: further down the line so we can see
154.24s: pce really came in a little bit late I
157.68s: mean is still unabashedly elevated but
160.64s: it's getting closer and closer to some
162.72s: of the fed target rates which I think is
166.04s: quite telling but I think it reinforces
170.32s: some of the fed's point that they are
172.48s: probably going to approach future cuts a
174.72s: little more cautiously and we looked at
176.08s: the probability for a cut actually let's
177.72s: do that really quick cuz we didn't do
179.96s: this on the live stream tonight after
182.68s: pce came out and I'm actually curious
184.60s: what this is so let's get rid of this
188.04s: yeah so still overwhelming probability
189.88s: of no change on 29 Jan and very little
193.40s: change over yesterday but then out to a
199.76s: week ago it's up massively from a 78%
203.24s: chance so we have to keep an eye on this
205.64s: so yeah the the market itself is still
209.24s: hyper hper sensitive to inflation as we
212.00s: expect so I think the name of the game
215.68s: here is position smartly I'm finding a
219.48s: lot of opportunity with individual names
222.72s: that have been bucking this overall
224.48s: trend for upside trades and then I've
226.68s: already talked about the main thesis to
229.12s: the downside and stuff like energy just
230.84s: because it's been uh there's nothing
232.96s: shocking about that move it's it's an
234.72s: easy easy find so let's now pivot to a
238.60s: few of the tickers
240.52s: that we want to talk about actually I'm
241.88s: sorry one thing before that I want to
243.80s: show you this so the advanced decline is
247.60s: actually showing a little bit of
248.64s: strength today New York Stock Exchange
250.08s: had 74% advancing NASDAQ had 63% but
254.16s: take a look at the highs and lows we had
257.36s: 19 52e highs on NY 37 on NASDAQ and then
263.76s: 139 52e lows against 196 52e lows so
268.60s: even though stuff re bounded today it
270.40s: had an advancing day the overall tenor
274.00s: is still weakness so the market is going
277.60s: to have to gain a footing before I would
279.64s: start adding a bunch of risk as
281.96s: mentioned to you all before on Wednesday
283.76s: actually paired down a lot of risk in
286.64s: things like the coverage strangle and
287.96s: The Leverage ETFs and whatnot it's it's
290.12s: really not necessarily knowing that this
292.52s: is going to happen you never know when
294.24s: it's going to happen but it's an
295.52s: evaluative risk reward relationship
297.72s: between the probabilities of things
299.72s: happening and then what the impact would
302.00s: be so let's pivot over now and let's
305.96s: take a look at a few names because one
309.12s: of them that stuck out to me was Tesla
312.56s: because Tesla has been on an absolute
315.68s: tear yet we can clearly see Tesla is
319.44s: slowing down a little bit and this looks
322.92s: more in terms of participation with the
324.72s: broader Market but notice how Tesla did
326.68s: not Rally today and the rest of the
328.48s: market did that to me indicates that
331.68s: this is starting to get to an extreme
333.84s: level that people are starting to say
336.00s: like okay I think this has ran up quite
337.52s: a lot take some profit here get some
339.52s: money off the table so I think Tesla
342.00s: really needs to consolidate some before
345.00s: unless it has new news if it is new news
346.96s: it's a different story but either new
348.44s: news or probably consolidation will look
351.40s: to be on the docket here and let's take
353.96s: a look at the options chain here we can
356.92s: see it's
357.84s: 4.5 million calls against 4.7 on the put
361.76s: side there was 2 million calls traded
363.88s: today 1.7 million puts so it's still
368.96s: like put selling looks to be what I'm
371.32s: seeing here this might be people cashing
373.32s: in on puts that they've bought near
375.76s: highs or this could be people that are
377.96s: starting to think that we could be
379.12s: getting near a value area selling puts
381.32s: to try to take on assignment if they're
383.84s: assigned or just collecting the credit
385.24s: on the down move cuz volatility will
386.88s: kick up a little bit lots of potentials
388.64s: there and then the call side looks
390.08s: mostly like closures at least
391.60s: definitively the most of them typically
393.56s: will transact between the market which
395.76s: we can't definitively tell if it was
397.68s: bought or sold so let's take a quick
400.88s: look just at the overall volume today
402.88s: the expirations yeah super short term so
405.76s: most of the volume today was for 20 DS
408.68s: and that's likely people collecting
410.76s: whatever value they can out of those
412.68s: options before rolling them out so no
414.92s: big surprise there um let's take a quick
417.60s: look at Novo
419.84s: and this is interesting because this has
422.56s: to do with their weight loss drug so
425.36s: they have a weight loss drug that was
428.52s: perspectively going to help people lose
431.52s: like 30% of their body weight and it
435.60s: didn't necessarily come in in line with
438.20s: expectations let me pause this real
439.80s: quick and see if I can get this thing to
441.76s: load I was just dumb and had an extra o
444.52s: in there by accident so you can see Novo
446.76s: here it dropped down from one and O 4 to
451.68s: 81 and this has everything to do with
454.48s: this trial information so you can see
456.72s: here I haven't read through this yet let
458.20s: me
459.04s: see um here it goes for more than a year
462.56s: is told the world that expects patients
464.24s: to lose at least 25% of their body
465.92s: weight okay 25 sorry not 30 on
468.44s: experimental drug kaga it turns out the
471.92s: company was wrong on Friday they
473.28s: released results of a phase three trial
476.00s: patients only lost 22.7% which seems
478.84s: actually pretty close of their body
480.96s: weight on average after about a year and
482.96s: a half there's some wrinkles in the data
484.96s: that suggest the drug could be better
486.32s: than it looks they still plan to ask
488.88s: Regulators to approve the medicine but
490.84s: that 22.7% rate is about the same
492.92s: efficacy as Z bound the Eli Lily which
497.00s: is the main thing here because if we
498.96s: take a look there's a a battle going on
501.12s: between these guys and Eli Lily and Eli
504.08s: Lily also had a pretty big down dat
505.56s: today I don't I I would have expected
507.52s: them maybe to Rally a little bit more
509.16s: but they had other stuff going on
510.96s: themselves so interesting movements
514.16s: between these the drift potential
518.20s: specifically for nvo for Novo is not
521.88s: insignificant so I try to keep a pretty
525.04s: close eye on the options chain for stuff
528.32s: like this because a lot of people will
530.68s: know these results before they come out
533.08s: and the other thing is the again the
535.68s: ability for these results to drift
538.44s: forward now for at least some time are
540.76s: not insignificant so you can see in the
542.36s: 17 Jan there's
544.48s: 76,000 calls against 85,000 puts so
547.68s: there's probably some people playing a
549.24s: little bit of drift which is I I think
552.24s: pretty smart um the little early CU it
555.04s: also was earnings coming up but the
556.84s: trade to the downside on that news is is
559.32s: decent I I see what's going on there and
561.20s: then the last thing we got to take a
562.04s: look at is GameStop and it's cuz we have
564.00s: an expiration today the stock closed at
566.96s: 29.82 which is pretty solid max pain did
569.96s: move um and as always it's I serve that
573.60s: as a reminder because a lot of people
575.88s: they I the emphasis on max pain
579.96s: sometimes can be a little bit excessive
581.68s: I think and sometimes we can forget that
583.76s: like the stock can also move on its own
586.56s: for for people wanting to get in and out
589.40s: now again last Friday I think it's a
591.84s: slightly different case because the
593.36s: probability of that being attributed to
596.60s: a couple other things is pretty high but
599.64s: this looks like normal stock movement
601.44s: and the fact that this stock is hovering
603.20s: up like this is huge if you take a look
605.56s: at the rally 2.83% on the day which is
608.24s: really really solid this it just looks
610.84s: good right like we're seeing higher lows
613.28s: slow Ascent which I like to see implied
616.52s: volatility is pretty high so implied
618.48s: volatility is
619.72s: 117 and uh volatility percentile 61% so
624.28s: pretty high on a relative basis now if
626.88s: we poke through the options change
630.04s: $872,000 calls against 299 on the put
633.56s: side so call skew is expanding pretty
637.08s: massively so this is almost at three
640.48s: times calls to puts that starts to get
643.80s: interesting to me this very frequently
645.60s: will hover 1 and a half to two and a qu
648.32s: times calls to puts but three starts to
652.20s: be in anomaly specifically for GameStop
655.24s: and we can see there was a ton of calls
657.92s: that were bought today and a lot of puts
660.20s: that were sold today so if we break down
663.52s: the volume for today we can see that the
666.48s: overall bulk probably what the 30s here
668.76s: and that's
670.80s: see 30s and that's because they were
673.44s: going to be out of the money so that's
674.60s: probably a ton of people that were
676.88s: grabbing what they could out of them and
679.16s: then rolling them out in time but let's
682.04s: take a look at the next expiration cycle
685.48s: 67 to 12 so really big skew but small
689.32s: numbers overall three Jan is super quiet
692.32s: 10 Jan very quiet with 17 Jan 17 Jan is
694.88s: 37 against six that's massive as well so
698.92s: the volume is definitely centering again
701.72s: in these front expirations with 27 D
704.20s: taking up a little bit more than
705.60s: expected and if we take a look at
708.92s: the volatility
712.68s: surface let's take a look at 17 genan
715.52s: and like
718.24s: Feb so we see a little bit of inversion
721.40s: and then it looks like we're back to put
723.44s: skew for 17 Jan but call skew on 21 fed
727.68s: which is interesting so I'm we got to
730.88s: keep an eye if the far of the monies on
733.64s: gme call side for the 17 genn start to
736.28s: tick up a little bit because that seems
737.48s: a little bit low that just means that
739.32s: the market isn't necessarily pricing
740.88s: these as Rich which which it tends to do
742.84s: and it starting to price the downside a
744.96s: little bit more richly which can kind of
746.48s: inform positioning a little bit and then
748.76s: the last thing I want to mention with
750.32s: GameStop is I'm actually modeling now a
753.68s: covered strangle position in GameStop so
757.84s: that's going to be uh I think it's going
759.68s: to be I'm going to model a $10,000 trade
762.16s: on trading the coverage strangle and
764.28s: GameStop and the the purpose behind this
766.68s: is we did a poll on one of the live
768.40s: streams asking like what the average
770.12s: size was for GameStop and people said
772.48s: like anything between like 5 and 10K so
774.84s: I picked 10K and the plan now is to do
778.40s: updates on a coverage triangle to show
781.12s: you how we can trade the equity amplify
783.84s: it with options so starting next week
787.00s: I'll start sharing some updates on that
789.20s: the position was established and all
790.68s: that it's up so now it's time to to run
793.52s: it manage it and hopefully use it as a
795.28s: vector to help people learn not just
797.28s: about GameStop but also how to use
800.08s: options to amplify positions not just uh
803.84s: Equity themselves cuz especially
805.72s: something like GameStop it's really
806.96s: useful I think and I I've tested it
809.24s: quite a lot at this point so as always
811.68s: anything you want me to take a look at
813.00s: hit me up throw it in the comments shoot
814.52s: me an email hit me up on X anything um I
818.12s: love taking a look at what you guys want
819.72s: me to talk about and what you guys are
821.16s: interested in it gives me a lot of focus
823.12s: so thank you for sending that stuff in
825.24s: as you guys want me to look at stuff be
826.80s: an outlier I'll see you later
