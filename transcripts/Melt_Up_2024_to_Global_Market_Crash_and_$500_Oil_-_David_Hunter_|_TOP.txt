2.24s: what's up everybody welcome back to the
3.92s: outlier podcast I have David Hunter back
6.44s: yet again we're going to talk about the
8.32s: market the economy all things stock
10.92s: market and as per usual it feels like
13.04s: there's no shortage of things for us to
14.72s: dive into so welcome back David great to
16.84s: see you yeah thanks Eric good to see you
19.56s: it's an absolute pleasure so first
21.76s: things first what do you make of the
23.56s: market as it sits today we are hovering
26.32s: near highs we see slight divergences
29.28s: between some of the different indices
30.92s: whatnot anything catching your eye in
32.84s: particular no I think it's the you know
35.16s: we're in the Melt up I had somebody ask
36.92s: me today you know uh is the election
40.04s: going to cause us not to have the Melt
41.88s: up I said we've been melting up you know
43.72s: it's it's we're up um the S&P is up 68%
47.80s: and the the NASDAQ 84% I think to the
51.76s: highs um from the October 22 lows so you
58.04s: that's a melt up in my book we've been
59.64s: melt up I think the next stage will be a
63.32s: what I call parabolic final stage to
66.24s: this market so I think we're coming to
67.84s: the end of a 42-year secular bull market
70.88s: thing I've talked about with you many
73.04s: times um and of course we're two weeks
76.04s: out from an election that in my opinion
79.28s: is probably the most important election
80.88s: in this country's history uh it's easy
83.20s: to overlook uh you know Civil War
86.16s: Lincoln and certainly George Washington
88.92s: but but I think at least in modern
91.44s: history you know the choices here are
93.88s: Stark and we either go in a Direction
96.56s: Where We kind of begin to take back and
100.08s: get back to a capitalistic free market
103.16s: economy and back to you know solutions
106.32s: that are not all Government Solutions
108.68s: and get away from what I call the new
110.48s: world agenda New World Order agenda of
113.36s: the the left um or we go in the
116.84s: direction of we could we could see the
119.92s: Court pack and all of a sudden you don't
121.44s: have a constitution anymore because
123.00s: you've and you may not have two-party
125.60s: elections anymore so I think it's that
128.36s: Stark that uh I know there are people
131.04s: that are you know sell never vote for
133.12s: Trump but boy the alternative is
135.24s: basically we won't see America back to
137.32s: the way it ever was before so so I think
140.28s: we're two weeks out from that um people
143.44s: keep saying well does that mean the Melt
145.32s: Up's going to end here and I said not
147.20s: necessarily in fact I don't think so my
149.92s: conviction is still high that we're
151.12s: going to I I just raised my S&P Target
154.12s: to
155.12s: 7500 uh from 7,000 I think we could be
158.92s: there this year so you know within the
161.40s: next uh basically two and a half months
164.40s: uh and it doesn't have to if it rolls
166.20s: over I if it uh takes into the first
169.52s: quarter that's fine but I think a
172.20s: parabolic means you can cover a lot of
173.88s: ground in a hurry and we'll see a rally
175.96s: like we've never seen uh don't know
178.48s: whether it'll be completed by the end of
180.32s: the year or not but it's going to be I
181.76s: think a big rally so um that's kind of
184.60s: where I stand um obviously there's wild
188.16s: cards that can come in between what's
190.28s: going on in the Middle East um you know
193.96s: certainly Ukraine although there doesn't
195.68s: seem to be likely imminent thing there
198.64s: that's going to change um and and what
202.16s: can happen between now and election time
204.64s: or even at the election there's as I
207.56s: said today on Twitter
209.92s: I think the things we have to worry most
211.68s: about is the left really has made it
214.84s: very clear that it's almost under no
218.96s: circumstance do they want Trump to be
221.48s: president again so that means they they
223.96s: feel they are justified in doing almost
226.32s: anything to stop him we've seen two
228.76s: assassination attempts we've seen um you
232.64s: know they they've they've got you know
235.24s: sitting Senators saying um on their side
238.44s: saying we're not going to certify his
240.92s: election if he wins um and you've got
243.64s: certainly the cheat that's been going on
245.60s: so um and they're setting up you know
248.64s: when the justice
250.28s: department um file suit against the
253.08s: state of Virginia for trying to clean
254.84s: their rolls up their voting rolls up
257.36s: because there are you know an awful lot
259.88s: of illegal um
262.24s: immigrants um that are uh not by law
267.24s: supposed to be able to vote and Jus
270.24s: Department sues to leave those those
272.32s: names in there uh that tells you exactly
275.48s: what the left is trying to do I hate to
277.48s: be so blatantly political here but we're
279.84s: two weeks out from something that's I
281.40s: think G to be very very
283.72s: important yeah well and I mean it's it's
286.20s: in my opinion I think it's completely
288.76s: reasonable for people to share their
290.36s: thoughts and opinions on this stuff it's
291.72s: the only way that information moves
293.00s: around so yeah I I think you sharing
295.36s: that is kind of part and parcel to the
297.44s: point of doing stuff like this now
300.16s: obviously we have to beg the question
302.00s: here though the S&P made what a high
305.20s: today of
307.00s: 5927
308.52s: 75 long way away from that what's the
312.20s: what's the Catalyst to move from let's
315.04s: just call it you know 59 and a quarter
317.36s: to 7500 in your eyes yeah I think uh I
321.76s: certainly think there's a setup here
323.88s: where I could make the case that we
325.32s: might see a 3% pullback so you know back
328.40s: down to uh certainly 5700 wouldn't
332.24s: surprise me but I don't think we're
334.24s: setting up for a big reversal here you
336.72s: know it's a bit of a selloff and you
339.20s: know certainly NASDAQ could be a little
340.80s: more than that Russell could be a little
342.76s: more than that um but ultimately I think
345.44s: it's any pullback here I think a short
347.76s: live might last several days um and then
351.20s: I think the real move here is what has
353.28s: moved this market for a long time here
355.92s: which is we still have an awful lot of
358.20s: people who have one foot out the the
359.92s: door uh they they they see the momentum
363.44s: and they feel like they have to be part
365.08s: of it but they're nervous as hell and
367.72s: they're saying you know this thing could
369.56s: end any time I think that wall of worry
372.60s: is a source of fuel to keep this thing
375.92s: going um what can move it well I'm
378.48s: seeing clearly the earnings are still in
381.20s: pretty good shape the economies uh
384.48s: defied logic in terms of all the
386.76s: tightening that was done and yet it's
388.36s: still reasonably strong you're probably
390.12s: still going to get a 3% GDP number um
394.20s: and uh consumer seems to have enough
396.92s: left to keep going uh through the year
400.16s: so I think at least for the next quarter
402.16s: there's you know basically all systems
404.64s: go interest rates although they are
407.92s: scaring people because they've backed up
410.64s: um my look at the charts and my look at
413.40s: the overall inflation picture and the
416.48s: economy
417.48s: Etc I think we're bottoming in the bond
420.12s: market and and Topping in rates here we
422.32s: had a backup from 360 back to you know
426.56s: almost 410 you know 409 I think um and I
430.96s: think we're the next move I think is
432.68s: going to take interest rates down to
434.20s: three and a quarter maybe even three%
436.60s: and ultimately as I've said uh before we
440.20s: before we get through the Melt up we
443.20s: could see two and a half on the 10 year
445.56s: so from you know from over 4% down to
448.52s: two and a half is a hell of a move in
451.12s: rates uh it will keep the economy from
454.12s: tanking anytime in the next few months
457.72s: and I think it'll be wind at the back of
460.04s: the market at the same time I think the
462.24s: dollar as rates start rolling over again
465.04s: the dollars poised for a big drop I
467.92s: think that's bullish so there's a lot of
470.20s: things there I think to complete this
473.36s: now people have to remember the
474.40s: valuations are very high we're 42 years
477.28s: into a secular bull market certainly
480.08s: uh two years into a very strong uh
482.60s: cyclical move so you I'm not pretending
486.24s: that this is the beginning of you know a
488.04s: long run but I think you're going to
490.44s: cover a lot of ground in a short period
492.12s: of time on the
493.96s: upside what do you make of the move in
496.92s: the 10-year yield from 3595 that was on
501.88s: 17 SE to where it is today I think that
504.76s: surprised quite a few people the the
506.72s: strength that it showed from there over
508.72s: the last month
510.28s: yeah I I'd just say step back look at
512.40s: the the bigger picture you know we came
515.04s: down from 475 to
518.32s: 360 it's just as I use the term it's
521.92s: just part of the normal stair step you
524.24s: know obviously in the short run the
526.36s: catalysts were those that wanted to
529.56s: believe that you know you you buy the
532.32s: rumor sell the news so you you've got
535.08s: you had the FED cut rates and and then
538.28s: all of a sudden you had a strong labor
540.20s: number you know strong jobs report last
542.64s: Friday um those kind of things just fed
545.40s: into the idea that hey you know this is
547.92s: the end of the bond move not the
549.84s: beginning and so they used it to sell
552.36s: off um I I don't you I'm not going for
556.20s: that hook I really think that's a a
559.04s: correction in a bull market in bonds um
562.68s: and as I said I continue to be I'm I
564.84s: know there's narrative out there that's
567.08s: opposite to this but I continue to
568.64s: believe inflation's in very good order
571.72s: right now moving towards the fed's
574.08s: Target and that's not going to change in
576.52s: fact I think next year we're going to
577.76s: see deflation
579.12s: ultimately um so I'm not worried about
581.48s: this you know the fed's the Fed was
585.00s: wrong to go 50 base points and it's
586.80s: going to reignite inflation I think
588.44s: that's that shows the nervousness that's
590.84s: out there I think it's wrongheaded but I
593.08s: think it's what you know that's people
595.04s: are kind of adding two and two and
596.44s: getting
597.80s: six yeah can you talk to me a little bit
600.20s: more about that specifically the the FED
602.56s: opening with the 50 basis point cut
604.92s: because I think that bounced around a
607.32s: lot for a while and that that I think is
609.08s: a little unnatural for them yeah well if
612.36s: you look the the FED fund rate was close
615.64s: to five and a half you know five and
617.16s: three it's five and a half um the the
620.88s: long Bond was down at 4% or below and
624.72s: the 10 year was down at you know I just
627.16s: said 360 so so so when they looked at
631.64s: their policy they said we're clearly too
634.52s: restrictive you know no matter what
636.40s: anybody thinks about the the strong jobs
639.12s: number or not the policy was restrictive
642.44s: and the economy is not all that strong
644.76s: in fact i' take apart that labor report
648.08s: you know there you really have to be a
650.28s: little bit you know even if it's not
653.12s: conspiratorial or that they're you know
656.48s: um playing with the numbers because it's
658.20s: an you know month out from an
660.92s: election they have shown over and over
663.20s: that revisions have been revisions
664.92s: downward you know they you get a number
667.20s: and you think oh my God and then the
669.20s: revisions are bigger than the number so
672.24s: so I don't I'm not in the camp that says
674.80s: you know labor in great shape or jobs
677.36s: picture is in great shape the FED when
679.68s: they first started talking about a 50
681.68s: base point cut you know a few weeks ago
685.68s: you know they were worried that the
687.40s: previous jobs number had been weak in
689.56s: fact the Fed was getting criticized for
691.08s: not cutting in in um August or July um
696.84s: so the 50 I don't think they were trying
699.04s: to make up for that but I I do think
701.60s: that really was driven and I had said
703.72s: this way you know well before the
705.80s: meeting that I felt just based on I
709.76s: think Austin gby is probably the guy I
711.72s: list think has a handle on it's better
713.80s: than anybody and he had made it very
715.88s: clear he he said you know
719.36s: a quarter Point's not going to get us
720.80s: anywhere near where we should be in line
723.16s: with you know what the Market's telling
724.64s: us we should be or what the numbers are
726.72s: telling so I don't think the 50 was in
729.20s: any way a panic to a weak economy nor
732.28s: was it I think a um a mistake in terms
735.64s: of doing too much too soon I think it
738.16s: was a a step in the right direction to
740.40s: saying we got to get policy back in line
742.56s: with certainly what the market is
744.28s: telling us it should be and also what
747.16s: inflation is telling us it should be
750.40s: I see one of the things that I've been
752.52s: trying to understand myself is when I'm
754.56s: looking at Bond pricing um like even a
757.76s: month ago it was showing a 29%
760.96s: probability of another 50 basis point
764.12s: cut and that's essentially completely
766.12s: gone now now it's looking like a 88%
768.84s: probability of a 25 bips cut the part
771.88s: that I'm trying to understand with that
773.32s: is that seems like a pretty erratic move
776.32s: like 29% probability dumping to zero
780.24s: kind of what like what are your thoughts
781.44s: on that kind of behavior in the pricing
783.84s: of the future cut coming up what is it
785.60s: seven nove yeah you you probably um
789.24s: could tell me better than I can because
791.20s: you're in that trading world it's it's
793.80s: the erratic is due to the the behavior
796.80s: of the Traders I mean they're moving
798.76s: they frankly they don't have a clue you
801.20s: know they're they're reacting to every
803.16s: data point and um and so uh you know I I
807.96s: think I'm a much more steady as she goes
809.88s: you know typical macro strategist that's
811.80s: looking at a bigger picture and it just
814.84s: it's silly to me I you've heard me say
817.84s: in previous meetings so it's been a
819.80s: while I've been saying this I think the
821.76s: fed's behind the curve they're not ahead
823.84s: of the curve they're not they're not
825.36s: printing too they're not printing any
826.72s: money you know they're shrinking the
828.44s: balance sheet still uh and rates are
831.48s: behind um what the yield curve tells
833.92s: them they should be by quite a bit by
835.80s: over 100 basic points so um you know I
839.52s: to me um I think you've got a lot of
842.96s: traders who have lots of opinions I
846.52s: don't think they're necessarily being
849.00s: proven very uh Ope in their views so so
852.92s: they keep going back and forth based on
855.40s: you know emotions and Based on data
857.52s: points or data releases you know and I I
860.64s: think it's a
861.80s: silly it's always been there but maybe
864.64s: more so lately part and I think that is
867.44s: partly a sign of how nervous people
869.12s: people are but I've been I've been
871.20s: following the FED for 50 years I'll put
873.12s: my ability to read the fed and and
876.00s: understand monetary policy against
877.88s: anybody and I just think a lot of people
880.80s: are um amateurs at Best in terms of
884.52s: analyzing the
885.88s: FED I think it's fair I think I also
888.52s: really resonate with your point just on
890.56s: the the skittishness because that's
892.52s: that's what I've been kind of sensing
894.36s: from things is kind of it feels like
896.20s: everybody's waiting for the shoe to drop
898.24s: and not really knowing if when that's
900.48s: going to happen I I probably I probably
904.84s: underestimate how how different my
908.12s: perspective can be because I'm a
910.08s: contrarian so it's like the nervousness
912.80s: that causes most people to say there's
915.40s: something out there it doesn't feel good
918.40s: is is the same thing that causes me to
920.48s: have conviction and say is as long as
922.88s: everybody's nervous I'm
924.72s: fine so I think part of it is just the
927.28s: natural contrarian in me I don't get
929.72s: Shook Up by the street going you know
931.76s: completely in that
933.48s: direction yeah so leading into the S
936.28s: November meeting what are what's your
938.96s: general thought there obviously right
941.12s: now it's looking like a 25 bips cut but
943.16s: I'm also just curious in terms of what
946.52s: you think the FED might address during
949.60s: that meeting not to preempt the move and
951.04s: not that the FED drives the market I'm
952.56s: just kind of curious your thoughts on
953.92s: like what the focus is here yeah I I
957.12s: think it's going to be um pretty
960.24s: they're they and I think Paul's been
962.08s: saying this for a while they're trying
964.56s: to Be Steady As She Goes not jump around
967.32s: with the markets and not jump around
969.72s: with the data and say you when we look
972.32s: at the trends and when we look at
974.56s: overall picture we think the move is in
978.16s: the direction of ease or less
981.32s: restrictive um but it doesn't mean that
984.92s: it has to be big steps we're we're still
987.48s: going to be kind of
990.12s: uh diligent in how we approach this and
994.64s: I so I don't know whe it's going to be
996.52s: 25 or 50 I don't think there's gonna be
998.24s: anything outside those two um I think
1001.68s: people who are worried that there's
1002.76s: gonna be no cut are wrong I think people
1005.32s: who think there's going to be something
1007.12s: bigger are wrong but I think could be 25
1010.20s: or 50 and frankly I don't think it
1013.12s: matters which it is in terms of my
1015.04s: Market Outlook you know I'm I'm bullish
1017.48s: either way Le me to a follow- on
1019.76s: question though your perception if it is
1022.72s: 25 versus 50 just for like a a learning
1026.28s: case
1027.08s: study how would you differentiate
1029.32s: perceiving those two different outcomes
1031.48s: if they do 25 or if they did 50 like
1034.08s: what would you take away from that um be
1037.20s: and you've heard this from me before I
1038.68s: think I I really pay much more attention
1042.04s: to the bond market yeah than what the
1044.12s: FED does in any given meeting because
1046.36s: the FED follows the bond market not not
1049.48s: precisely and they're not you know
1051.12s: sometimes they'll go in opposite
1052.20s: direction of bottom but I mean the the
1054.36s: general move in rates is first dictated
1058.40s: by the bond market and and the FED being
1061.32s: kind of looking at backward-looking data
1063.88s: and and driven by um you know they just
1068.40s: tend to be later or slower um so I'm I'm
1072.44s: getting my you know my lead I'm taking
1075.52s: my lead from the bond market and as I
1078.16s: said I think you bottomed in the bond
1080.88s: market you know whatever it was a few
1083.24s: days ago and then you kind of had a gap
1086.24s: up one of those one or two of those days
1089.48s: and today you're filling back into
1091.40s: towards that bottom so I think you're
1092.76s: getting kind of a very short retest um
1096.28s: and so I think you're basically at the
1098.28s: lows at the highs in rates and the lows
1100.72s: in the bond market here and I you know
1104.20s: as I said I expect to go from you know
1106.48s: 409 410 uh down to towards
1110.64s: 3% um and if you're getting that well
1113.88s: I'm not too worried about whether you
1115.60s: get it before November 7th or after um
1120.12s: whether whether they do a quarter now
1122.68s: and a half in December or do two halves
1125.44s: or um two quarters you know the bond
1128.00s: Market's going to be there the FED isn't
1131.28s: the FED doesn't drive the bond market
1133.12s: the bond market drives the fed or sort
1135.44s: of drives the Fed so I'm I'm I I have
1139.16s: more faith in the collective wisdom of
1141.68s: the bond market not any individual Bond
1144.36s: investor but the collective wisdom of
1146.36s: all those entries into bonds I have more
1149.96s: more faith in that as a dictator of
1152.28s: where rates are going and I think I can
1154.36s: consistently or see more
1156.84s: consistency in the fact that rates are
1159.92s: you know head lower you know I have more
1161.64s: faith I guess in in being able to read
1164.32s: the bond market than than read members
1167.16s: of the flmc
1169.88s: it makes sense now that's always been uh
1172.84s: a phrasing that I'm really interested by
1175.40s: that the idea of dictated by the bond
1178.24s: market versus predictive do you think
1181.52s: the Bond Market actually dictates
1183.92s: meaning forces the hand of the fed or do
1186.84s: you think that the bond market is really
1188.76s: good at preempting what the FED is most
1190.52s: likely to do just from a causal
1191.96s: relationship analysis yeah because the
1194.68s: bond market is not rates is a misnomer
1198.36s: out there Rate rates are not driven only
1200.80s: by what the fed's gonna do up or down
1203.76s: you know there's there's the economy
1206.92s: there's um
1209.08s: inflation there's obviously the jobs
1211.72s: picture that the fed's looking at but
1214.32s: there's a lot of things out there supply
1216.56s: of of bonds coming from the treasury you
1219.60s: know if we're just speaking of the
1220.72s: treasury market so it's Supply demand
1223.08s: driven it's data driven but it's bigger
1226.64s: picture driven it's it's the over all
1229.00s: sense that a you know a bond crowd
1232.56s: meaning all Bond investors all together
1234.88s: as one one market put inputting all of
1239.60s: the factors and variables that are there
1243.12s: that you know you'd have to have some
1244.76s: supercomputer to do but in the aggregate
1247.32s: law of large numbers the bond market is
1249.80s: pretty efficient at capturing all of
1251.96s: that and and determining what I think um
1255.44s: the future direction of rates is so it's
1257.60s: not just the Fed it's really um you know
1260.52s: just like when we're making calls on the
1262.40s: stock market it's the stock market is
1264.92s: pretty good at you know when you look
1267.08s: back you go who would have thought the
1268.64s: market would have would have gone up
1270.84s: from 3500 to 5900 in two years based on
1276.28s: what everybody thought in the last two
1278.12s: years but the market in its aggregate
1281.20s: predicted correctly that we didn't have
1283.20s: a recession the economy held together
1286.08s: Better Than People expected earnings
1288.64s: turned around and have been better and
1291.28s: so you know again not really efficient
1294.56s: market but law of large numbers it it
1297.56s: tends to get things over time pretty
1300.00s: right now that's not to say it doesn't
1302.20s: have cycles and it goes One Direction
1304.36s: and The corrects back the other but um
1307.72s: yeah I'm just I'm not fed driven in
1310.44s: terms of looking at rates I'm really
1313.36s: more you know Market's telling me I you
1316.04s: know and I look at it both fundamentally
1318.08s: and technically
1319.60s: technically I think the Bond Market
1321.00s: looks like it had a a pretty normal
1323.24s: correction given how far it had come um
1326.20s: and is now poised for another leg
1328.96s: up got it do you think that there's any
1332.36s: impact or relationship with the Chinese
1335.76s: market as it sits now obviously the last
1337.84s: couple weeks they started talking about
1339.84s: different stimulus huge huge run in all
1343.28s: sorts of chinese-based
1345.68s: adrs um does that fit into your broader
1348.56s: thesis at
1349.88s: all I I think what we saw in China was a
1354.56s: big part of it was short covering I mean
1357.80s: you know people were so it it was in a
1361.20s: bigger way akin to um the Japanese carry
1365.84s: trade and that everybody was betting on
1369.52s: you know the the the Yen had been
1371.60s: falling for
1373.16s: years and so even though people knew at
1375.64s: some point reverse nobody was expecting
1377.64s: it when it happen
1379.00s: and and when it happened it happened in
1380.60s: the vacuum and went up fast and it
1383.16s: forced the carry trade
1385.08s: reversal um so this one wasn't carry
1388.28s: trade but it was again people had pretty
1391.32s: much written off China saying you know
1393.64s: they just got too many problems we're
1395.24s: looking elsewhere you know our focus is
1396.96s: not China and you know even if the
1399.68s: valuations there are looking cheap we
1402.32s: don't care because China's got a problem
1404.64s: you know huge problem on their hands and
1406.96s: then all of a sudden kind of surprises
1409.36s: and nobody anticipated they they all
1412.00s: knew kind of like Japan you all knew at
1413.92s: some point it would happen people the
1416.20s: investor didn't anticipate it would be
1418.56s: immediate that China would all of a
1420.76s: sudden come up with a a big policy
1423.48s: reversal and they did and because that
1426.72s: vacuum was there and and a lot of shorts
1430.44s: you had this big rally some a big part
1433.28s: of it I think was short covering and and
1435.92s: just people you know the David tiers
1438.52s: world looking and saying wow look at the
1440.76s: kind of uh reversal and liquidity we're
1443.56s: going to see there that's bullish for
1445.44s: not just the next two weeks so you had
1448.04s: and and people followed him in so you
1450.44s: had that my guess is it'll it you know
1453.76s: obviously has corrected pretty sharply
1455.88s: from that initial run um and then you'll
1458.96s: have another run I think a more orderly
1461.20s: run so um you know CH China in its own
1466.08s: you know kind of it's own picture
1469.24s: I don't I don't see it as a long bull
1471.12s: market but I do see it as probably
1473.84s: rallying along with the rest of the
1476.24s: world as we finish out this this cycle
1480.20s: um and I don't you know their liquidity
1483.64s: obviously helps Global liquidity the
1485.56s: fact that they've turned on the the Taps
1487.92s: a bit now helps Global
1490.24s: liquidity um but I think this thing
1493.64s: basically the seeds were swn for this
1495.40s: melt up and China's you know a minor
1499.48s: minor help to that got it and out of a
1503.88s: general personal curiosity perspective
1506.84s: do you have any thoughts on the real
1509.24s: estate market there and any potential
1510.88s: impacts to the Melt up if there is some
1513.44s: sort of big issue with the Chinese real
1516.12s: estate market because that's always in
1517.80s: conversation to a degree but I don't
1520.00s: know exactly how important that is it
1522.64s: sounds like the market less so anything
1524.36s: from the real estate side I I will say
1527.76s: because you know I am looking for a
1530.20s: global bus next year there's no doubt in
1532.80s: my mind China's going to play a role in
1535.44s: that there's no doubt in my mind that
1537.80s: China real estate's going to play a role
1539.64s: that so I don't think it's over I don't
1541.36s: think they're out of the woods I don't
1542.64s: think it's marked a major bottom I think
1545.40s: this was a bottom on the way to a much
1547.24s: deeper bottom in the bust so and I'm
1550.40s: talking the markets but also the real
1552.16s: estate same thing you might get a little
1554.60s: relief there as you know they provide
1557.24s: liquidity and they some of the things I
1559.24s: could they're going to try to do to you
1561.88s: know stop the the Meltdown but but
1565.48s: ultimately I think there's a you know
1567.56s: much deeper bottom coming for the whole
1570.08s: world but certainly for China and China
1572.40s: real estate next
1574.28s: year got it and for the Yen carry trade
1578.52s: specifically that's
1580.40s: been prolific almost at this point it's
1583.20s: been ongoing for so long so much
1585.44s: conversation around it why do you think
1588.40s: think that it went down the way it did
1591.32s: specifically in terms of the at least
1593.20s: your perception of the unwind and people
1595.32s: being caught off guard because to me it
1596.72s: seems like there's so many eyes on it
1598.88s: how do you miss
1600.00s: it you miss it because you didn't
1603.48s: anticipate when it actually happened
1605.64s: when the end reversed It reversed in
1608.08s: such a violent way because it was in a
1610.56s: vacuum that immediately made those carry
1613.80s: trades very expensive I mean that you
1615.88s: know people were it's not just interest
1618.44s: it's the it's the foreign currency on
1620.56s: that rate that you and so all of a
1622.96s: sudden it drove your cost of carry up so
1626.24s: fast out you know
1628.56s: overnight that and and people were
1631.48s: leveraged with that that people had no
1634.60s: choice but to say I gota liquidate you
1637.48s: know I can't I can't carry this um so so
1641.20s: you had the whatever percentage of those
1643.72s: that were using um the
1646.44s: Yen uh for the and and borrowing in in
1650.44s: Japan um whatever percentage were in a
1654.96s: very tight spot and very leveraged that
1657.56s: had to happen almost immediately then
1659.92s: the balance of people who had more uh
1662.96s: less leverage and had more ability to
1665.00s: kind of work out of the situation we're
1667.40s: given plenty of time in the in the
1669.28s: following weeks because the end the end
1673.16s: backed off you know we've had the end
1674.80s: back off for the last basically two
1676.92s: months um
1678.72s: so you know those that had the luxury of
1682.40s: time have been able to work out of their
1684.68s: trade you know and so you had the
1687.28s: immediate you know what you always do
1689.64s: kind of the immediate Margin Call and
1692.20s: then and then others who said yeah I
1694.56s: don't want to be there long term but I
1695.92s: don't have to I don't have to liquidate
1697.52s: right now and I think the odds are that
1701.48s: if you didn't do it in the last two
1702.96s: months when you've given been given a
1704.52s: second
1705.36s: chance um I don't know what you were
1707.48s: waiting for so the odds are that the
1710.00s: majority of that carry trade's been
1711.92s: reversed got it Switching gears a little
1715.48s: bit over to
1717.04s: Commodities um crude oil had a pretty
1720.88s: wild move relatively not crazy but it
1724.16s: hit a low of 65 in September and then it
1728.68s: hit a high of what was the high here
1732.72s: 7848 on the 8th of October and now it's
1735.28s: been trailing down thoughts on the move
1737.92s: there
1739.48s: yeah I mean as you know I've been the
1741.16s: bear on the street for oil and you know
1743.88s: I'm still looking for 60 and I actually
1746.44s: think there's a decent chance we see
1748.24s: something in the 50s uh before the end
1750.64s: of this year so obviously the wild card
1753.44s: is the Middle East and you know if Iran
1756.28s: hit the oil fields or or Israel hit
1759.36s: their oil fields you know we could have
1761.16s: some disruption there um but my sense is
1765.60s: the higher probability is that oil is
1768.84s: going to Trend continue to Trend down
1770.64s: that we had that scare you know that
1772.72s: move from 65 to 78 was entirely based on
1776.76s: the Middle East and entirely a scare it
1778.84s: wasn't based on sply and demand um and
1782.20s: now we've rolled over and it looks to me
1784.24s: like you probably head it for 60 barring
1787.72s: something you know happening immediately
1789.92s: here um and I would I would say it can
1793.40s: get into the 50s then bounce maybe it
1796.52s: bounces back uh to the high 60s or the
1800.40s: 70 uh and then ultimately in the bus
1803.08s: next year I think we'll see 30 bucks and
1806.40s: that will be I mean I don't even know
1808.88s: whether 30 is the you know the bottom
1811.08s: but somewhere down there um and then
1814.04s: that will be lows in oil and coming out
1816.76s: the other side of the bus when there's
1818.36s: so much money printed to deal with the
1820.16s: bus um you'll begin a long bull market
1823.64s: in oil so if you if you get let's say 30
1826.28s: is the bottom I I think you'll see 500
1829.68s: by early in the next decade so you know
1832.44s: 30 2030 2031 somewhere in there $500
1837.32s: from 30 on oil and then you can imagine
1840.92s: what that does for any uh oil equities
1844.76s: so um so I think you just you know we're
1847.52s: in we're in the bare Market in oil it's
1849.52s: been down since 130 and you know in the
1852.64s: spring of 2022 when uh Russia went into
1856.24s: Ukraine it spiked to one 30 from 85 it's
1860.28s: been working its way down ever since so
1862.88s: and people don't seem to understand
1865.60s: these things all move in in a jagged
1868.44s: form you know it's a stairstep process
1871.52s: you're G to have moves down and then you
1874.04s: get to move back up and people always
1876.12s: want you are always asking me are you
1878.32s: done with your bear call you know do you
1879.88s: think now you finally you got you got
1881.60s: this wrong I said I don't get this wrong
1883.40s: it's it's what to expected you're GNA go
1886.12s: you know you had a big selloff you're
1888.12s: going to have another bounce did it go
1890.56s: farther sure because of what's going on
1892.60s: in in the Middle East um you I would
1895.68s: have not been surprised by 75 78 is a
1898.24s: little higher than I would have expected
1899.72s: but I'm not surprised by it at all
1901.60s: because of you know the big the big
1904.24s: things going on in the Middle East but I
1906.60s: I think barring a big event over there
1910.56s: um I think you're you're on your way
1912.76s: back
1913.76s: down what do you think the thought
1915.88s: process is between op te production
1918.64s: right now why are they maintaining the
1920.68s: current path that they
1923.76s: are yeah I mean they they I mean they
1926.88s: can't keep cutting because they need
1929.12s: Revenue they've cut a lot yeah and they
1932.28s: certainly don't want to increase at this
1934.80s: point so I think it's kind of they'll
1937.80s: they'll do little cuts at at at the
1941.12s: margin maybe um or at least talk cuts um
1945.40s: you know give some rhetoric and and
1948.16s: things like that but basically and this
1951.04s: is this is a surprise
1953.00s: but we're producing a lot of oil in this
1955.80s: country in spite of it being in the
1957.52s: Biden Administration you know yes Trump
1960.32s: would be producing more but we're
1962.40s: producing quite a bit you know the oil
1964.56s: companies have really been doing a lot
1968.32s: and and of course China was down and
1970.92s: wasn't demanding oil and you know I had
1973.60s: a conversation this week or it was a a
1976.20s: stream of conversation on my feed about
1979.48s: the EVS in China you know I focus us so
1982.92s: I don't pay much attention but I guess
1985.00s: they've made huge inroads over there in
1987.24s: terms of um switching over to EV and so
1991.72s: you know their demand for oil has been
1993.52s: going down for that reason but it's also
1995.20s: going down because their economy has
1996.68s: been tanking um so you know they're
1999.68s: doing far less in heavy industry Etc
2002.36s: they you know they've been kind of
2005.12s: pulling back from all that stuff trying
2006.68s: to wind wind inflation out and all that
2009.72s: and now they' started going the other
2011.20s: way because it was hitting their real
2013.48s: estate so hard so but all of that I
2016.88s: think is you know China is a dominant
2019.52s: player in the oil markets and just
2021.88s: didn't have the demand and that's you
2024.60s: know I to my credit I I wasn't focused
2027.64s: on China so much but globally I
2030.24s: said there's there's a lot more oil in
2033.12s: the world versus Supply than people are
2036.40s: versus um demand than people are giving
2040.44s: uh accountant to so you know I think I
2043.44s: think we are seeing uh that that's going
2046.12s: to continue right into the global bust
2048.20s: you know that ultimately we have excess
2050.92s: Supply over demand and that's not going
2053.24s: to change in the next
2055.28s: year got it another thing that's been
2058.52s: really interesting is even the latest
2060.48s: news with Google talking about their
2062.84s: entrance into nuclear power to to help
2066.20s: essentially power um
2068.36s: you know their Ai and gpus required to
2070.56s: run the AI what are your thoughts on
2072.36s: nuclear
2073.36s: power yeah I think nuclear has to be
2076.20s: part of the answer you know
2078.36s: it's I've been pretty vocal in saying
2081.84s: which is part of my $500 oil call is
2085.44s: it's nice to talk about Alternative
2087.28s: Energy but we're nowhere near being able
2089.92s: to replace fossil fuels in terms of what
2094.48s: we're going to need and if you have what
2096.36s: I fully ECT which is a a goosing up of
2100.12s: the next cycle as we print money like
2102.88s: we've never printed before because of a
2105.76s: you know Free Falling Financial system
2107.60s: next year you know Global bust if we see
2110.84s: 20 trillion in in new money in this
2113.12s: country and proportionally around the
2115.12s: world you're you're gonna Goose demand
2118.28s: like you've never seen because it's also
2120.72s: coinciding with us reshoring and
2123.68s: starting to go more industrial again Etc
2126.84s: the demand for oil is going to go
2128.48s: through the roof the demand for energy
2131.04s: is going to go through the roof and
2132.16s: there's nothing that can can you know
2134.52s: you're not going to be able to produce
2136.08s: enough wind power or solar power um to
2140.20s: offset the need for energy so um so it
2144.52s: goes right back to oil and of course oil
2148.12s: it takes many years to develop a new oil
2150.76s: field and we've spent all this time
2153.88s: forcing our oil companies to do less
2156.20s: Drilling and less searching and you know
2159.12s: we're we're trying to move them away
2160.48s: from it uh you're you're can to have a
2163.52s: goosing of demand in a very short
2166.20s: fiveyear time span and and not new not
2170.36s: not the ability to produce uh Supply to
2172.96s: meet it and what gives is price so so
2176.84s: that's a long way of saying we're gonna
2178.32s: have to have other Alternatives and
2180.56s: nuclear is one of them and the fortunate
2183.28s: thing is the technology has progressed
2186.08s: to the point where it'll be not the big
2189.52s: you know 20year projects but rather the
2192.88s: you know the the smaller nuclear plants
2195.76s: that they can you know they've got the
2197.60s: technology they've got I think the
2199.48s: regulation's gonna particularly under
2201.44s: Trump is goingon to
2203.00s: improve uh TimeWise so that you can
2206.00s: actually put those thing in on a timely
2207.96s: basis so I there no question we're gonna
2211.16s: see more
2213.80s: nuke what are your thoughts on gold
2217.76s: Gold's been hovering near highs
2219.56s: essentially from the 26 of November
2222.56s: trended sideways for a little bit dipped
2224.72s: down into like the 26 27 handle and now
2228.44s: it's hitting highs yeah back uh I guess
2231.80s: it's probably several weeks now I don't
2234.80s: know whether it's a month but certainly
2236.40s: in the last months several weeks um I
2240.24s: raised my target on gold I had a $3,000
2243.60s: Target what I call pre-bus Target
2245.52s: meaning before next year's Global bust
2248.40s: um and probably a first quarter you know
2251.08s: probably happened in the first quarter I
2252.88s: had a 3,000 Target and when when gold
2256.40s: was starting to push up against um that
2258.76s: you know it been kind of consolidating
2261.04s: in 24500 area um around there I I said
2265.60s: I'm raising my target so my new Target
2267.56s: is 3,400 I think we could be there in
2270.52s: the first quarter very very much think
2272.64s: that's likely um so I'm very bullish
2276.24s: gold here um you'll have pullbacks along
2279.08s: the way as with every market so you know
2282.32s: maybe it goes 2900 and pulls back 100
2285.00s: points or something but I I think we're
2287.44s: on our way to you know
2289.56s: 3,400 um and then in the bust with as
2294.16s: with most assets it's going to go down
2296.16s: so you might go 3,400 back to the
2299.12s: mid-20s you know 2500 2400 it might even
2303.20s: go all the way back to 2100 where it
2305.76s: broke out from you know
2307.96s: last year um and that would be you know
2311.92s: that would be
2313.72s: um more than a 30 probably a 35%
2317.44s: pullback I would guess so 35 to 40%
2320.64s: pullback I think that's possible in the
2323.72s: bust um but you know big run up here
2328.44s: correct and then you know my target for
2331.20s: end of this decade early next is
2334.76s: 20,000 so there's there's a lot of gold
2338.20s: still they come and got to talk about
2341.32s: the Catalyst there um it's it's h around
2345.00s: 2712 so I assume it has everything to do
2349.76s: with the your broader thesis so but
2354.16s: what's the order of operations here we
2356.80s: have Market melt up then we're talking
2359.08s: about gold starting to run how does the
2361.48s: relationship between these different
2362.68s: things work in terms of specifically the
2365.00s: gold estimate yeah I've been pretty
2367.44s: consistently saying for the last year or
2369.36s: two that I felt the medals and the
2372.12s: equity Market would move up together and
2374.40s: I and people would take me a task on my
2376.32s: bearish oil call because I go oil and
2378.40s: gold always go up together I go no they
2380.08s: don't always go up together and they're
2381.52s: not going to go up together and they
2382.80s: obviously hav so um I think yeah I think
2386.60s: they're Co coincidental I think you will
2388.68s: see the equity Market you know melt up
2391.36s: to 7500 I think you know the S&P and I
2394.52s: think gold you'll see you know it's not
2396.52s: a melt up but run to
2398.56s: 3,400 um and I have 75 on Silver um so
2404.16s: you know there's there's big runs I
2406.00s: think in metals and in the equity
2408.20s: markets and in bonds and what drives the
2411.16s: gold market I think it's a weak dollar
2414.00s: you know Dollar's been you a counter
2415.80s: Trend rally here for a while I think
2418.32s: that's pretty much run its course I
2420.96s: would expect from this 103 and change to
2423.88s: see the dollar down to certainly down to
2427.04s: the mid 90s and maybe 90 um within the
2430.40s: next three four months five months and
2433.16s: ultimately down to I I had been saying
2435.68s: 80 I've raised a little bit to 82 is my
2438.72s: ultimate dollar Target um and that
2442.48s: happens could happened early in the bus
2444.24s: or before the bus but given how far it
2446.84s: has to come I wouldn't be surprised if
2448.80s: the early part of the bus you're still
2450.20s: going down in the dollar in the in the
2452.84s: bust in the guts of the bust the dollar
2455.24s: can rally back to 120 you know people
2457.48s: are going to flee to safety you know
2459.56s: around the world the dollar will still
2461.12s: get that flight safety trade but for the
2463.96s: next six to nine months I see the dollar
2466.48s: Hing straight down that's probably the
2469.20s: biggest um driver of gold uh is that
2472.68s: weak dollar and then you know lower
2475.36s: interest rate certainly helps gold um
2479.08s: and you know fears fears of fed easing
2482.24s: leading to inflation could be a part of
2484.44s: the narrative like I said I'm not I'm
2486.64s: worried about deflation not inflation
2488.56s: but that doesn't mean the market won't
2490.20s: worry about
2491.48s: inflation and how does silver play along
2494.20s: here because silver was interesting it
2495.88s: it hit a high of 33 and about a quarter
2499.56s: um like the beginning of this month end
2500.80s: of last I think and it's been kind of
2503.16s: running a bit sideways here it had a
2504.72s: little bit of a pullback and then has
2505.88s: been running sideways so yeah curious
2508.88s: how silver fits in I expect you know and
2512.28s: it could be momentarily you know
2514.16s: tomorrow next week um I expect silver to
2518.00s: have to outpace Gold you know I think
2520.96s: it's it's starting up here it uh it kind
2524.88s: of had to pull back I think it got aead
2527.48s: of itself a little bit this week um but
2530.44s: ultimately it looks I said yesterday I
2533.00s: think on Twitter you know we're there
2535.12s: basically we're at that point where it's
2536.68s: about to break above that 33 level um
2539.76s: that it had gotten to and I think you
2541.96s: can probably see it up to
2544.40s: mid-40s um in the next you know
2547.84s: certainly this year maybe in the next
2549.56s: couple months um and then from there um
2554.08s: you know make keep going or may pull
2556.20s: back for a little while before and but
2558.68s: ultimately 75 and I think so gold and
2561.44s: silver I think trade together with as is
2564.16s: normal in Bull markets silver outpaces
2566.24s: gold and metal Mark bull markets um so
2569.72s: and I think that's going to be the case
2571.76s: the miners I think will will finally um
2576.16s: reward invest ERS who have been very
2578.36s: frustrated by the fact that you know
2580.72s: certainly Gold's done very well and and
2582.68s: Silver's up 90% from its lows of a
2585.20s: couple years ago um and yet you know the
2588.60s: miners have been languishing so they're
2590.92s: starting to get a little more bid uh and
2593.68s: I think that's just going to accelerate
2595.20s: from
2596.76s: here what's the thought process in your
2599.88s: perspective of people to choose silver
2602.64s: over gold or gold over silver do you
2604.60s: think most people that are moving into
2605.96s: the medals like this are splitting
2607.88s: between the medals I want to understand
2610.00s: from a broader perspective how you break
2612.00s: those down in the perceptions of people
2613.56s: and how they use both of them yeah simp
2616.44s: simply put well certainly first of all
2618.60s: gold is obviously more of a monetary
2621.80s: medal you know it certainly is a lot of
2624.28s: it is you know world events a lot of it
2626.64s: is the dollar a lot of it is um you know
2630.68s: some place where you can get away from
2633.96s: concerns about inflation Etc silver on
2636.60s: the other hand has real uh much more
2639.80s: real cyclical um exposure to you know uh
2644.72s: solar panel markets and EV and you know
2648.32s: lots of other things so so there's more
2650.44s: of a cyclical component to Silver but
2653.68s: right now I think uh there's plenty of
2656.16s: demand for silver
2657.76s: cyclically and and silver has that other
2660.92s: component which is it is Poor Man's gold
2664.00s: so it's not it's not a pure monetary
2666.60s: metal it there are a lot of people that
2668.72s: will run the silver when Gold's getting
2670.56s: a little bit expensive and you know you
2673.16s: get more bang for your buck it seems or
2675.52s: you know it's like it's like stock
2676.88s: splits you know you're able to buy more
2679.28s: of it if you can buy a 30 something and
2682.64s: you know Golds at 2700 so so but uh uh
2688.32s: the simplest way to put it in terms of
2691.28s: as I see it anyway in terms of gold
2694.12s: versus silver is that in Bull markets
2697.44s: silver will outpace gold typically so
2700.60s: that that gold silver ratio which was up
2704.00s: around 90 you know year ago or whenever
2708.12s: um should get down towards 40 if if gold
2712.40s: divided by silver gets down by gets down
2715.52s: from 90 to 40 that tells you Silver's
2717.88s: way outpacing gold right so in a bull
2720.76s: market you want to be probably more
2723.24s: heavily weighted in silver uh and then
2726.08s: in correction or when when we go through
2728.52s: the pullbacks and in these medals
2730.80s: particularly during the bus if you're
2732.92s: going to own either one I'd probably own
2734.80s: gold you know um and then on the other
2738.16s: side of the bust they're both going to
2741.24s: be skyrockets and you know it's personal
2745.44s: preference as to where you want to be
2746.96s: there but silver will probably
2749.84s: outpace now when we're thinking about
2752.72s: this the broader bust here though do you
2756.04s: like where do you think the the transfer
2759.12s: or I'm maybe projecting here maybe there
2760.92s: isn't but um do you think maybe is the
2763.64s: best way to phrase it do you think that
2764.72s: there's a transfer of capital from
2767.04s: equities into metals and if so where's
2771.52s: that relationship when does that start
2773.04s: to happen in
2774.36s: droves yeah the biggest time I mean gold
2777.32s: Will silver probably get hit much harder
2779.72s: than gold in the bus so gold gold will
2782.24s: outpace equities during the bust if if
2784.88s: if I'm calling for an 80% bare Market in
2787.20s: the stock market in the US Stock Market
2790.60s: and I say gold could drop back 35 to 40%
2794.48s: obviously that's a a much better place
2797.68s: to be than equities if you had to be
2799.80s: somewhere um silver on the other hand if
2802.20s: it goes to 75 it could easily come back
2805.96s: to 30 or maybe even back into the low to
2809.64s: mid 20s because it is so cyclical and if
2812.32s: we go through a you know worse economy
2815.16s: worse Financial s um situation we've had
2817.88s: in post World War II era you're gonna
2820.64s: see big hits to things like silver so so
2823.92s: silver is not something that's going to
2825.84s: protect you on the downside in a in a
2828.00s: bust the bigger story which is I think
2830.40s: what you really want to know is the
2832.88s: postbus era when you know when we're
2837.48s: coming out of that bottom and the FEDS
2839.12s: printed so much money it is going to be
2842.20s: a a cycle where Commodities will
2844.84s: Commodities of all kinds will outpace
2847.52s: the equity markets um and it'll be a
2850.64s: high inflation environment ultimately
2852.36s: it'll start out slow but but in the
2854.48s: decade we could see 25% inflation I
2857.56s: expect gold and silver to be leaders of
2860.40s: the pack in terms of performance leaders
2863.48s: um outpacing almost everything else at
2866.44s: the end but during that commodity cycle
2870.32s: um you know you can have as I say if the
2873.28s: market drops if stock market drops 80%
2875.60s: so let's say you know um I used to it
2879.04s: was easier math when the S&P my target
2881.24s: was 7,000 I'd say you can go down 80%
2883.80s: that's 1400 but from 7500 let's say it's
2887.20s: 1500 I don't know what it is um you can
2890.16s: you can triple that number and be it
2893.72s: 4,500 or
2895.88s: 5,000 um and still be way short of that
2900.08s: 7500 cycle Peak this year um obviously
2903.44s: my numbers are just my guesses but um so
2907.16s: so you can have a cyclical bull market
2909.52s: that will never come close to the the
2913.48s: peaks of this cycle on the other hand
2916.24s: gold and silver and copper and oil and
2919.64s: egg Commodities are going to see highs
2922.56s: manyfold beyond anything they've ever
2924.56s: seen before because it's going to be
2927.00s: driven by all that money it's going to
2928.52s: be an inflation cycle and so natural gas
2932.84s: natural gas might get down to a dollar
2934.60s: in the bust who knows where gas goes
2937.76s: next cycle natural gas might be40 or $50
2940.40s: next cycle you know go from a dollar to
2942.88s: 40 or 50 that's you know 40 50 times um
2947.24s: you know gold going from let's say
2950.44s: 2500 to 20,000 you know that's a huge
2954.52s: run silver going from let's say 20 to
2958.56s: 500 is my target uh in the next cycle so
2962.20s: those things will Pace oil will go from
2964.72s: let's say 30 to 500
2967.20s: meanwhile you've got maybe you you can
2969.48s: have a couple years where the equity
2971.16s: Market is still you know it's not
2973.64s: keeping Pace with other things but I
2975.40s: mean it's not it's not going to be what
2976.76s: the commodes are through that whole
2978.08s: cycle but for a couple years it might be
2980.20s: a pretty good place to be um but then
2983.20s: what you're GNA run into is the
2985.04s: headwinds of higher rates if if interest
2987.96s: rates can um interat will track
2991.72s: inflation if inflation can go from
2994.12s: deflation next year to 25% inflation by
2997.56s: let's say 2030 or
2999.56s: 31 um then interest rates are going to
3002.72s: go from I have said I expect the 10e to
3005.72s: be down to zero next year in the depths
3009.16s: of the bus you could go from a zero 10
3011.80s: year to a 15 or 20% 10 year by the you
3016.12s: know early next
3017.76s: decade um so so if you have interest
3021.52s: rates doing that that's a huge headwind
3025.04s: for the stock market because PE
3028.28s: multiples are the inverse of rates you
3031.04s: know they move inversely to interest
3032.72s: rates so that's really what drilled the
3036.04s: last 40 years is we had interest rates
3038.20s: go from high double digit in the early
3040.72s: 80s down to you know almost you know
3043.84s: below 1% in 2020 so you had P multiples
3048.28s: go from single digits to 25 or 30 um and
3052.52s: that's you know we're gonna have the
3053.72s: reverse of that post bust because it's
3056.24s: going to be huge inflation
3058.36s: cycle a curiosity I have with respect to
3061.00s: the bust is normally when we see markets
3062.92s: go through these larger Corrections even
3065.80s: to Bare markets extended bare markets
3068.56s: normally there are still elements of
3071.60s: strength either in markets Commodities
3074.24s: somewhere do you see anything showing
3077.76s: strength at all during the bust or is
3080.16s: this literally everything is coming down
3083.96s: together just in different degrees two
3086.40s: things one
3088.00s: treasuries if if I'm looking for a 0 10%
3091.08s: in the bust and let's say it gets to 250
3094.84s: before the bust that's still a big run
3097.24s: up in the treasuries between 250 to zero
3100.60s: um and short rates will go below zero
3102.72s: probably the long Bond will probably get
3104.40s: down to a quarter or a half so you got
3106.84s: that will be one asset that will not
3108.60s: only not be going down but will be going
3111.40s: up while everything's falling apart so
3114.32s: that's the hu that's the number one
3116.16s: asset in the bust in my opinion and why
3118.88s: because of the government guarantee
3120.88s: because of the printing press as I say
3123.52s: in 2030s when all
3125.84s: collapses it won't be the same story
3128.00s: because you won't have government the
3129.32s: government guarantee won't mean much
3130.72s: because the government will be bankrupt
3132.32s: but in this because of the printing
3134.00s: press um I think you can pretty much be
3137.08s: assured that they'll honor all those
3139.44s: treasuries um so the treasury is first
3143.04s: and foremost and the only other asset I
3145.52s: come up with is the dollar and not from
3147.92s: here but from that 82 at the lows or
3151.24s: wherever it goes to if it can go back up
3153.96s: towards 120 you know you got you got two
3156.76s: appreciating assets and the rest of the
3159.40s: asset structure whether it be private
3161.80s: Equity whether it be um you know
3164.44s: leverage loans whether it be um
3167.16s: corporate bonds and particularly junk
3168.88s: bonds whether it be stock market whether
3171.56s: it be Commodities they're all going
3173.40s: straight down so having having your
3176.04s: money in either an FDIC insured savings
3180.28s: account or a treasury bond or any
3184.32s: treasury security any maturity um or the
3188.24s: dollar those those are about the only
3190.52s: things that will I think protect you I
3193.32s: see last question before we wrap up is
3197.00s: obviously your thoughts are that we're
3198.92s: in the mup now it's likely to hit a
3201.40s: crescendo you know either towards the
3203.56s: end of this year or q1 next what are
3206.64s: some of the the warning signs as far as
3208.72s: you can see now of when we're in the
3212.04s: Melt up what does it look like when the
3213.80s: Melt up is slowing and starting to show
3217.12s: cracks yeah I think what you're going to
3219.36s: have is an all-in market so right now as
3222.68s: I say um people are starting to ra you
3225.76s: know just looking at Wall Street
3227.76s: strategies for example they're starting
3229.96s: to raise targets you know you've you've
3232.16s: seen a couple 6,000 numbers out there
3235.76s: lately I was the only one for two years
3238.04s: I mean people thought I was crazy but
3240.56s: now you're start as you getting closer
3242.48s: to it you're starting to see the numbers
3244.16s: raise and so you know people are people
3247.64s: who had targets of 51 or 5200 six months
3251.12s: ago now are talking about 57 or 800 or
3254.80s: maybe 6,000 for a couple um as we move
3258.36s: along here you can see those targets
3260.48s: raised you're going to start hearing
3262.80s: more talk about this has legs that it's
3265.76s: you know it's not just into the end of
3267.84s: the year that because of the fact
3269.84s: because we're starting a new easing
3271.80s: cycle um that this might run for a
3274.16s: couple years or longer that's what will
3278.12s: capture the the institutional investors
3281.20s: attention is if they think this isn't
3283.36s: the end of something it's the beginning
3284.72s: of something where they can they can uh
3288.16s: discount the earnings out a couple years
3290.04s: that are higher earnings out a couple of
3292.08s: years um and maybe even longer um their
3295.88s: models will now be able to make sense of
3298.72s: this where we are because they've been
3300.84s: struggling with the valuation and saying
3303.60s: you know there's not much room left you
3305.32s: know this thing is going to come to an
3306.64s: end here shortly and we don't want to be
3309.04s: buying the top if they really believe
3310.88s: this is a start of something you'll see
3312.52s: them ramp up and that's why I think
3314.16s: you're gonna see the whole final move
3316.64s: happen in two or three months or less
3319.16s: you it sounds crazy to say you can go
3321.16s: from 5900 58 5900 to 7500 in in you know
3326.68s: between now and the end of the year
3328.40s: except if if everybody comes to the same
3331.20s: conclusion
3332.72s: that oh the fed you know the FED is
3335.32s: actually really easing that the economy
3337.96s: isn't strong that there's a cycle ahead
3342.40s: they'll act on that in the short period
3344.12s: they're not going to wait months to act
3346.12s: on that so you can get you know you can
3348.56s: get that parabolic final run um that now
3352.32s: of course they're not going to be
3353.72s: looking for a bust I'm looking for a bus
3355.76s: they're going to be thinking the Cycle's
3357.32s: just getting going um what so what
3361.00s: you'll be looking for from a stock
3362.48s: market
3363.40s: standpoint is everybody being bullish
3365.92s: everybody being all in everybody having
3367.88s: that bullish narrative that says this
3369.68s: has legs and it can go for two years or
3372.20s: three years um when when you hear people
3375.64s: saying it's Goldilocks and you've got
3377.92s: you know earnings are moving up interest
3380.92s: rates are moving down inflation's under
3383.40s: control the FED did the right the manage
3386.76s: this perfectly those are the pieces of
3389.60s: the narrative that I think will tell you
3391.12s: you're getting close to the end um from
3393.80s: a stock market standpoint from a looking
3396.72s: for signals of the other side um it's
3401.00s: gonna be tricky
3402.80s: because you know if we're up if we're up
3405.52s: on
3406.32s: stilts it's you know people aren't
3409.20s: stupid out there if they see the signs
3410.88s: of things are getting bad it won't be up
3413.20s: on stilts but I think initially
3417.36s: weaker economy slow because I'm I'm
3419.48s: still in the camp that says the recent
3422.64s: strength is kind of a facade that
3425.96s: basically yes we're getting El lasan and
3428.32s: consumer and things but there are cracks
3430.76s: showing underneath and the labor isn't
3432.76s: as strong as those numbers indicate Etc
3436.12s: so I wouldn't be surprised in the next
3438.16s: you know between now and the end of the
3439.44s: year if we start getting some signs that
3442.48s: things are moving closer to recession or
3444.88s: you know aren't as strong as we thought
3446.48s: and recessions looking more likely but
3449.80s: that's not necessarily going to be
3451.36s: received bearishly because it means the
3453.64s: fed's going to have to get more
3454.72s: aggressive so they'll when when it turns
3458.92s: into more bearish is when it turns out
3461.44s: it's not a soft Landing it's not a mild
3463.68s: recession it's oh wow things are really
3465.96s: deteriorating fast we almost had that in
3468.08s: July right we we had some numbers there
3470.64s: that surprised us to the downside and it
3473.44s: looked like it was speeding up and then
3475.28s: we got our breath again and we got you
3477.56s: know a little more strength I suspect
3479.92s: before the end of the year it's going to
3481.12s: go back the other way it'll be received
3483.52s: initially bullishly it's only I think as
3486.16s: we get into early next year where the
3488.80s: number what you'll be looking for is the
3490.60s: numbers to start really accelerating to
3492.32s: the downside whether it be you know ISM
3494.80s: numbers retail sales um housing because
3499.32s: I think homes are kind of getting a last
3501.48s: to Rob because those that felt they
3503.80s: missed it are getting a reprieve because
3506.28s: rates are coming down mortgage rates are
3508.00s: coming down but they they're buying
3511.36s: almost too quickly because rates are
3513.16s: going to come further down but there
3515.00s: won't be more buying power behind that
3517.00s: because those that want to buy now are
3520.28s: kind of jumping the gun now and soon
3523.44s: after this it's going to be you know
3525.64s: there's more inventory there's not
3527.96s: another wave of buyers and all of a
3530.68s: sudden the house prices start slipping I
3532.80s: think that will be one of the early
3534.48s: signs that you know next year is not
3536.68s: going to be what this year was I see
3540.64s: fascinating yeah it's really interesting
3542.76s: to see the the Melt up thesis and seeing
3546.16s: how it unfolds so as always thank you
3548.16s: for kind of sharing and walking through
3550.52s: that with us before we wrap is there
3552.56s: anything else though that we didn't talk
3554.40s: about that you want to hit on yeah the
3557.08s: only thing I would say just kind of
3558.40s: furthering out the talk about the bust
3561.00s: is um people just have to remember the
3563.96s: the Melt up
3566.44s: seemed crazy at the time too and people
3569.68s: you know fought it and fought it and
3570.88s: fought it until now now people were
3572.72s: throwing around the term melt up but you
3575.08s: know for two years they really thought I
3577.28s: was crazy for thinking the market could
3579.84s: do anything like it's done um the bust
3583.88s: you know people want to be able to see
3585.92s: it they you know they they think now
3588.28s: they're starting to question you know
3590.92s: isn't it possible you're dead wrong on
3592.24s: the bus I yeah certainly possible but
3594.80s: I'm my my conviction so high that that's
3596.88s: where we're headed but don't expect that
3599.68s: it's going to be obvious that you know
3601.92s: you as a retail investor or even you as
3604.16s: an Institutional Investor um not you but
3608.00s: anybody um you know that it's if it were
3612.76s: obvious we'd be we'd be acting on that
3615.00s: now so it it's not going to be obvious
3617.28s: for a while yet don't don't use that as
3619.56s: the sign that it's we're we're not going
3621.68s: to have one because it'll all of a
3623.36s: sudden show up um but I think we've
3625.60s: still uh between now and the balance of
3627.92s: this year for sure um plenty of room for
3631.00s: this thing to run and bus type signals
3634.56s: are just not going to be there
3637.44s: fascinating David always absolute
3639.80s: pleasure chat and thank you so much for
3641.56s: taking the time sharing a little bit

3646.80s: you're willing to go through the
3648.64s: different questions that I have because
