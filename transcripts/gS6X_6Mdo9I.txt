583.78s:  today both civilian and government
585.82s:  Thank you
586.82s:  You
587.84s:  prepare to
589.84s:  Wha
590.56s: ิ
591.06s:  poll
593.72s:  You
593.84s:  agreeing to
595.82s:  follow the prowess of
597.36s:  your
599.36s:  prevhes
601.00s:  are elevated instances or not.
605.68s:  Let's see what it says.
607.80s:  And the FAA in places like that will have a ton of data,
611.16s:  how on this.
612.00s:  So we will absolutely be able to get a decent answer on it.
618.64s:  But the fact, I don't even know the full details on this one.
622.48s:  Obviously, I saw that, I saw a TikTok video of somebody
627.64s:  that was videoing them getting out of the plane.
630.44s:  But I mean, that's like a whole upside down plane, like very upside down.
636.84s:  I'm not a pilot, but I feel like that's wrong.
639.24s:  When I look at that, I get the sensation that this did not go the correct way.
643.20s:  I do see they have the wheels out.
645.04s:  So the wheels being out is good, but the wheels should be on the ground.
650.96s:  And right now they're pointing towards the sky, which we don't necessarily love.
656.52s:  Let's see what this says.
660.92s:  So all people made it out not immediately clear.
666.84s:  Okay.
671.20s:  Had one wings severely crumpled to the tail section partially sheared off.
679.40s:  It's talking about the condition of the people.
683.76s:  Yeah, okay, so it doesn't actually.
686.40s:  Doesn't actually tell me.
688.32s:  Oh, okay, cool.
689.12s:  Shamgar says they just had a press conference strong win in icy.
692.24s:  Yeah, okay.
693.20s:  So then did it, did it as it was landing?
696.80s:  Did it turn and then like dip a wing or something?
700.40s:  Is that it?
702.16s:  Likely wing hit a ground on landing?
703.84s:  Oh, you mean like as they were coming down,
707.60s:  their angle was completely off like that?
710.80s:  That would be fucking crazy.
714.88s:  Damn.
715.76s:  If that's the case, that's crazy work.
718.88s:  That would be very not good.
721.36s:  Okay, so let's see.
723.36s:  As of February 1725, an analysis of aircraft accidents and
727.28s:  coming encompassing both civilian and government reveals a nuanced picture
731.60s:  of aviation safety compared to previous years.
735.44s:  In 2024, there was 11 civilian airplane accidents resulting in 318 fatalities
742.40s:  the highest since 2018.
744.72s:  Like that statistic is really upsetting
749.68s:  because there's zero fucking reason why this should be going backwards.
757.36s:  That just doesn't make sense.
760.40s:  Like why why in 2024?
764.56s:  Now I do have to I do have to wonder is this like per capita meaning per flight
771.68s:  capita because if they're just looking at this in terms of a gross number,
775.60s:  then that that's way less meaningful to me.
778.40s:  If this is something in the context of the, you know,
783.20s:  number of flights in total as a ratio, then this is a massive problem.
791.60s:  Because there's no reason why this should be going backwards.
794.80s:  But let's go back.
795.84s:  I'm going to close the door real quick.
801.76s:  And let's take a quick look.
809.36s:  Okay, so 24 had 11 civilian airplane accidents.
814.32s:  2023 had 30.
822.88s:  2023 had no fatal accidents despite a 20% increase in air traffic
830.64s:  compared to 22.
832.08s:  Interesting.
836.32s:  Really interesting.
840.64s:  So it's hard to say like let me see if are there are there any resources that show the
852.64s:  year over year trend?
855.20s:  And wonder if there's something that shows us.
860.00s:  I don't really care about all these other countries to be honest with you because
863.20s:  they'll have different levels of scrutiny on their flights and whatnot and their flight planning.
870.64s:  So I actually prefer to use US government stuff for this one.
878.32s:  Here we go.
885.60s:  What do we got?
892.64s:  So they do it by light hours which I like.
903.20s:  Okay, let's take a look.
908.16s:  Let's go to 22.
909.36s:  21.
919.36s:  You can see that there's actually a lot of accidents but the number of fatal remains pretty low.
933.12s:  The majority of fatal occur during maneuvering or on route.
937.44s:  Now landing is where we see the most accidents but they're non fatal.
944.40s:  Loss of control.
950.24s:  Very interesting.
954.32s:  So I mean it looks in general like the number of accidents that we see are down trending.
963.36s:  Like when we look at it in the.
967.28s:  Broad scheme of things.
972.48s:  Which to me is exactly what it should be.
974.32s:  I wouldn't expect it to be going up at this point.
976.16s:  There's no reason for it to be going up.
980.88s:  Don't need the.
983.84s:  I don't want to actually download this.
985.52s:  This is just one of them.
987.44s:  So it looks like it's generally going down.
988.80s:  So let's take a look at Delta airlines really quick.
1002.88s:  They're trading down.
1003.84s:  So that's one thing I was thinking about is that it really wouldn't surprise me much at all
1011.44s:  to see a bit of a.
1014.72s:  A bit of a down tick here like pretty much at all.
1018.24s:  And the main reason for that is just because.
1022.80s:  The news cycle right it's not down a whole lot 64 and a quarter and you know 65 so it's
1028.72s:  down just a little bit so far but it really wouldn't surprise me at all to see this.
1034.40s:  Tick down a bit especially just given the news and the press.
1038.24s:  So this typically becomes an easy really short term trade nothing with like really high
1042.72s:  conviction or anything like that but something that I at least I typically try to monitor just
1048.64s:  because it can be an okay short term opportunity.
1052.48s:  So we'll we'll see how it actually materializes yet.
1056.64s:  All right so let's take a look at the questions and see.
1061.04s:  Coffee Donuts says why do you think Ryan Cohen transfers his GME shares from his LC into his
1066.16s:  own name we looked at that two weeks ago on I actually think I might have done a natural video
1071.52s:  on it as well talking about it. I'll give you the link to that video but I can also save you the time
1079.36s:  which is I don't know and I don't think anybody is given a actual answer as to why.
1088.80s:  So coffee donuts and Homer this video is for you that one I talk about the move that we saw
1095.68s:  with Cohen and we looked at the filings and stuff and we even walk through chatchupiti a little
1101.52s:  bit to see if chatchupiti had any ideas as to why the the move might have occurred.
1108.16s:  And there's nothing conclusive that I can find. Now there's a lot of reasons to move out of
1117.76s:  in LLC but none of those reasons that I like I don't see any of those reasons actually applying
1125.68s:  to RC so genuinely not sure but I also haven't seen something that actually explains it yet.
1132.96s:  So I wish I had a better answer but I'm also not going to bullshit you.
1137.68s:  Do keep high would like to look at Nvidia and SMCI let's do that Nvidia. Yeah I mean I still
1146.40s:  really like Nvidia. I think Nvidia is a company is just so unbelievably well positioned right now
1153.68s:  that I from an investing standpoint it's just so attractive. And one of the things I was talking
1162.80s:  about after this drop was wait and see how it behaves see if it grabs a bite and it grabbed a firm bite
1169.12s:  and I mean it's had a nonstop rally back up to prior levels. These kinds of trades and I talked
1175.60s:  about it as it was unfolding to me are some of the easiest possible trades you can place.
1181.92s:  The reason why they're so easy is not because we know with certainty that it's going to go back up
1189.20s:  but as we talked about as a betting man which we all are as traders the probabilities of this
1197.44s:  thing going back up were just so much better than the probabilities of this thing cratering.
1203.76s:  And I also think Nvidia is such a great example of a news cycle. It's such a great example because
1211.60s:  there was nothing really material that changed about Nvidia other than deep seek news coming out.
1217.92s:  And the funniest thing about that is the news by deep seek didn't really usurp in video the
1227.04s:  trail of thought was deep seek saying this is way cheaper so then Nvidia's ability to monetize
1234.48s:  it is going to go down that's why they started punishing the stock but it still doesn't position
1241.12s:  Nvidia away from the epicenter of the adoption of AI. So this was one of the easiest no-brainer ideas
1249.60s:  that existed I think. So I think from a near term perspective now it's probably going to find its
1256.48s:  way back into congestion right so this point of control everything's been transacting here for a
1262.08s:  while I think that the average holding iteration in Nvidia is probably quite quite a while.
1266.96s:  So because of that I don't think that it's necessarily going to get punished right back down
1273.92s:  to a prior levels but the way I look at it is now it's coming into earnings release. So
1279.52s:  the way I would play Nvidia going forwards at this point is from an investor perspective probably
1285.12s:  favorite to the upside continually but from a trading perspective it's already made most of the
1290.80s:  recovery it still has maybe another 10 to 12 points to go before it starts closing in on all
1296.00s:  time highs again and that's really going to be driven by its earnings release. If it reports
1303.12s:  as well as most people typically expect Nvidia to report then it wouldn't surprise me at all to see
1308.96s:  it have another smash quarter just absolutely crushing things but if it reports light my guess is
1315.12s:  it probably will get punished for it because Nvidia at this point down here it had like a anywhere
1324.48s:  depending on what time frame you looked at it it had anywhere of a less than one peg to less than
1329.44s:  two peg which is crazy for something like this. So lift notes of all of that I think it looks
1337.84s:  extremely solid I think that Nvidia will continue to be one of the absolute most dominant elements
1346.48s:  of AI adoption they've positioned themselves to be so so at this point it really becomes
1351.84s:  all eyes on earnings if it has a really great earnings I think it flies if it doesn't have a great
1357.84s:  earnings it would not surprise me to see it consolidate for a while I don't think it's going to
1363.60s:  pukets guts out and rotate down in any significant way I don't see why it would unless its earnings
1369.84s:  come in like crazy off but I don't see really the world or the scenario why that would be the case.
1377.76s:  So if we take a look at one is it the 26th this says after the close so let's take a look at Nvidia
1389.52s:  and let's take a look at the volatility cycle on 28th Feb we'll take a look at the
1397.76s:  surface. Yeah exactly what I would expect pricing in larger potential move
1410.56s:  downside larger severity but favors higher probability of an upside move which is literally
1416.64s:  exactly what I would expect to see here so yeah I think Nvidia is solid and then the other
1425.52s:  you wanted to look at was SMCI SMCI is an interesting case to be honest yeah SMCI SMCI to me looks like a
1435.20s:  fucking sick dog and I don't like it and I want to like it because I don't think there's any reason
1444.64s:  for SMCI to be doing this fucking terribly but they're doing terribly they had an okay earnings
1451.68s:  let's take a look at their earnings release SMCI earnings where the actual materials
1482.40s:  let's do the press release wait why is there no presentation
1490.96s:  yo also why is my fucking computer frozen another
1511.12s:  it's completely locked up I can look at nothing I can look and hear at least
1520.88s:  I might have to kill chrome there it goes so long chrome
1534.08s:  what the fuck give me a second I have to close chrome I think because it's just not responding at all
1541.84s:  one second I don't know if this is going to what the fuck was that
1555.52s:  right just getting everything set back up that was fucking weird man
1564.64s:  my computer has been going through a bunch of software updates so I have to assume this is at
1574.32s:  least marginally tied to that but let's I mean I guess I'll go back into SMCI and we'll see
1587.84s:  I want to look at the fucking earnings release I think it would be an interesting read to be honest
1594.96s:  so let's do that
1598.56s:  miss some CI earnings release I'll try a different link maybe
1611.04s:  okay you look at the press release so we can get this no problem
1618.40s:  let's try this
1625.52s:  so this also works
1632.64s:  okay and then let's check out the q4
1639.76s:  yeah so that one works I don't know why their presentation isn't available it's kind of annoying
1644.64s:  but at least we're able to look at this now so let me get my stuff organized let's take a look
1654.40s:  all right let's zoom in
1661.04s:  polo says their cfo said they will get over everything without significant restatements it's
1666.08s:  that if that's true they have huge upside yeah the problem is polo the the accounting issue doesn't
1673.68s:  it doesn't account for this like the I remember the accounting issue but if you look at the stock
1683.28s:  itself it's been going down for literally a full year so that this isn't accounting like the
1691.84s:  accounting issue if I'm not mistaken happened back here didn't it it definitely happened
1699.04s:  a little while ago but this this is not accounting this is companies not performing inline
1706.80s:  with expectations for whatever reason and it's been on a decline for nearly an entire well it's
1713.60s:  definitely over a year it's yeah literally even if we look at the start of the last 52 weeks it's
1719.84s:  still down firmly from where it would have opened up around 78 down at 47 so I think that
1728.96s:  while the accounting issue definitely is a thing and didn't help it at all the company has been
1736.96s:  massively underperforming even before that which is a problem so let's take a look at this and see
1746.00s:  what they say they have a terrible logo by the way that logo looks like it's from like the 70s or 80s
1753.20s:  and not in like a good retro way and like a bad dated way see like this is nuts sales 54%
1769.44s:  your over your growth why is it just being punished so heavily let's take a look
1780.08s:  as you know we need to get into chat GPT we need to ask it um why has this some CI and all inconsistently
1792.48s:  or roughly the past year you would chat GPT sums up it's got to be a handful of things obviously it
1802.00s:  flew too close to the sun we could see that with the parabolic up move when that happens expectations
1808.24s:  become so so very high so there's an element of that without a doubt but then after that
1816.88s:  it still shouldn't be down as far as it is even in that scenario so what I mean by that is typically
1822.72s:  when a company is growing really fast like here it essentially went from 35 dollars up to
1829.60s:  $121 in the course of what is this 19 Jan to 7 March right so this is everybody buying into the
1841.12s:  to the fervor of something they think that they're going to miss the boat there's a lot of
1845.20s:  FOMO going on we think that this thing is you know the the next big thing and this movement is
1852.56s:  very normal and then even this movement is not abnormal because for things to be able to keep
1858.56s:  pace with this kind of growth you need to be like the top not even death style like the top
1866.56s:  half a percent of percent of company will be able to sustain eating anything even relative
1872.96s:  to this kind of growth for significant durations and significant durations I'm meaning for like
1877.52s:  few years now this pullback is way too steep this is not a normal price digestion pullback from
1890.08s:  here to here that's that's bad so this represents a 40 percent decline that's way too much and
1898.40s:  on companies that are growing really aggressively that have natural pullbacks they will not pull back
1905.68s:  this far that's way way way too far they pull back maybe 15 20 percent something like that this
1912.24s:  is fueled by a bunch of different things but this is abnormal so then it starts to consolidate
1920.24s:  and then from here even before its earnings release it's had a terrible terrible drop so my
1928.88s:  expectation would be that it would not be surprising at all to see smc i rally from down here
1936.48s:  and it's because the same thing I was talking to you about Nvidia it becomes a game of pot odds
1942.56s:  right so if we go back to 2024 do we think that smc i is better positioned now than it was in 2024
1954.72s:  I think most of us would argue yes and if we look through this it also looks like yes from even
1962.64s:  a quantitative perspective so the fact that it's trading so close to its range from 2024 which was
1971.36s:  around 30 is great opportunity for some upside but the question is is how much upside because
1981.36s:  this movement is not normal so for smc i from an investing perspective I think it could be okay
1989.36s:  it really depends on one second I got a yellow Thor
1998.40s:  it really depends on the duration and what you think the company might do in the future but from
2004.08s:  a trading perspective it does look like there's a short-term bullish opportunity I just don't like
2010.96s:  how much it's lagging so it can absolutely provide a decent bullish opportunity and a big reason
2018.88s:  for that is because you start to think well how far are we from the floor right and you can see
2024.56s:  that it ticked a low of 17 and a half so this chart is really misleading because of how huge
2032.64s:  all these different moves have been if I change it to a log scale it'll give you a little bit more
2038.08s:  context the reason why the log scale is so important is because going from 17 to 47 is a massive move
2045.68s:  but it doesn't look like that because of the raw prices on a standard chart like this so if you don't
2053.52s:  have like that mental picture in your brain of understanding the magnitude of this move it can be
2057.52s:  very misleading so really really interesting company I feel like it should be so so much better
2064.32s:  positioned to be capitalizing on things right now but just for whatever reason
2070.40s:  it is struggling so let's see so accounting and financial reporting in August of 2024
2078.32s:  Hindenburg Research released the report accusing them of accounting irregularities so
2084.56s:  in August of
2086.32s:  24 what is that in here this is probably the Hindenburg drop right here so that in and of itself
2097.20s:  is just it's not a nothman the company even before the Hindenburg piece came out the company
2103.68s:  was trading around 60 and it had already fallen 50% from 120 so that's a big problem delayed
2114.72s:  financial filing filing following the allegations they postpone its annual report to assess internal
2120.24s:  financial controls leading to concerns about transparency and governance auditor resignation in
2126.80s:  October of 24 EY resigned as the auditor which is not good and then in September of 24 the DOJ
2138.40s:  launched a prelimprobe and then it came up on potential delisting from NASDAQ due to delayed
2150.08s:  financial reports so yeah under the hood of the company it looks really mixed the company is
2164.72s:  doing well and the reason that's why I say mix the company is doing well the fact that they're
2168.80s:  growing sales 54% year over year that's crushing it objectively crushing it but you lose any
2177.84s:  shred of confidence when all of these different things start piling out and you start fucking it all up
2183.60s:  so don't love it that's the that's the summation whether it's something I would trade or not I would
2191.28s:  but I would trade it more from a bullish leaning vol perspective from anything else I don't
2200.56s:  I don't like it I think it's probably going to be fine to be clear but just because it might be fine
2208.32s:  as always the question to ask myself before placing a trade as not could I possibly place a trade
2215.52s:  in this is this the right place for the money and it's not for me I don't think it makes a lot
2221.60s:  of sense interesting interesting bring up though I'm glad you brought that one out because it's very
2226.00s:  very it's one of those bizarre really really bizarre names I'm trying to scroll up in the chat but
2233.92s:  now all of a sudden Google Chrome is completely locked up again this is getting a little bit frustrating
2242.72s:  to be honest don't understand so I can at least see the chat so I think there was a couple questions
2249.92s:  that I can't see so if you can repeat them if I skip you I'm not doing it on purpose I literally
2257.60s:  can't I can't scroll for some reason I have no idea what the what the issue is oh there it goes
2265.20s:  now it just started scrolling it's after I close that SMCI window that SMCI window is fucked
2273.04s:  all right
2279.12s:  Joe says is the market of the apes done or still another series of stock pump short squeeze
2288.16s:  the BD man I think the potential for squeezes are always there I think the problem is there's
2300.32s:  so the stock itself is so abundant now or something like GameStop so there's always squeezes
2308.32s:  available and it's not limited to GameStop right we can look at companies that have really high
2314.32s:  short interest um I actually think there might be a way to create a scan for that give me one second
2320.48s:  with bar chart those bar charts have the ability to scan for high short interest stocks I'm assuming yes
2344.00s:  while the screener offers filters it doesn't explicitly listen short interest
2349.44s:  okay so let there's got to be another place that does find a website that allows
2356.88s:  searching by short interest I don't know if Benzingo allows it
2363.76s:  let's see
2377.60s:  okay so market watch has one
2380.08s:  Intel quantus snow so there's a bunch of them okay what do I got
2396.16s:  look at this 287 percent shorted
2401.84s:  169.5 percent shorted let's see what Chattu Pt says about that
2407.12s:  there are two companies that are over 100 percent shorted how is this possible
2415.84s:  I'm so curious what Chattu Pt is going to say about it
2428.24s:  a stock having short interest exceeding 100 percent means that more shares have been sold
2432.16s:  short than available on the public float this happens due to a combination of
2436.64s:  re-hypothication stock lending mechanics and naked short selling yep fucking straight trash bro
2449.36s:  so cyn spgc like those two
2454.00s:  you
2458.88s:  look fairly interesting so let's take a peek at them cyn
2464.80s:  oh man they're almost dead
2468.40s:  spgc they're essentially dead oh sober I've been fallen sober yeah they're getting crushed
2478.88s:  too
2480.80s:  aren't as
2483.68s:  there's still somehow alive
2487.52s:  Riley brushed
2493.52s:  yeah I mean most of these companies now the again the good part about it is that these
2501.12s:  can be really good places to sell premium but you just have to be so cautious you for me I
2507.44s:  actually prefer to sell downside premium on stuff like this and just take the risk as compared
2513.12s:  to selling stuff like short strangles having naked short calls in something like this is always
2521.84s:  bad news bears because you can get wrecked if it does start to squeeze and somebody exercises
2530.00s:  the short that's just never a good spot to be
2534.64s:  so
2540.16s:  let's see what the open interest is yeah I mean look at this everybody's playing it to the
2544.00s:  downside and this is the kind of thing like I would happily play downside ball
2549.12s:  even this I mean it's honestly completely useless for my account but if you could get anything
2556.00s:  of a decent size at like the two and a half you're pulling in 163.5 percent ball like that's
2562.72s:  insane return on the money if you can get a fill
2569.04s:  so yeah this one looks interesting the in terms of shorts there's always always squeeze potential
2576.80s:  whether it's in game stop or something else who knows all right we have time for a couple more
2586.24s:  so I'm gonna go a little bit faster uh capital ape says I'm looking to go into intel and SMC I
2593.36s:  oh that's funny we just spent a while looking at SMCI but I just decided to go shares on
2598.00s:  iantw and smcx versus 31 and average interesting choice all right uh I'm just
2611.12s:  combing through the questions to see if I hit them all
2623.44s:  okay I think I'm caught up
2630.80s:  okay uh james says can we look at bsx for along on the next pullback let's see
2639.60s:  yes i
2644.96s:  um
2647.84s:  what
2653.28s:  james what trading duration are you looking at the reason why i'm asking is because
2660.72s:  that changes the context of the answer a little bit also let me add a couple more times
2666.40s:  stamps in here because i realized i essentially haven't done like any of them
2671.60s:  but is this like 40
2675.60s:  42 40 42 40 this is q and a
2682.56s:  short squeezes and then now we're gonna take a look at bsx
2689.36s:  um
2689.76s:  um
2694.00s:  but james what what time frame are you thinking about the reason why i'm asking is because like why
2698.08s:  why wait for a pullback i never understand that
2705.20s:  now that's i'm saying that in hyperbole there are periods that it actually makes perfect sense
2712.80s:  but in general i think it's theological
2717.44s:  so the the reasons for that are really simple when i look at something that's doing really really
2727.04s:  well the like if you wait for a pullback let's say that you were waiting for a pullback from
2733.84s:  here at 97 one to three months yeah then why the fuck would you wait for a pullback
2741.60s:  if you waited for a pullback here you never got it if you waited for a pullback here you never
2745.84s:  got it if you waited for a pullback from here you didn't really get it because you got it back
2753.20s:  to the same exact spot right like it just doesn't really make sense the wait for a pullback is good
2761.28s:  for value investors if you're a value investor that's trying to get something at very specific
2767.84s:  multiples makes perfect sense and the world of a value investor is to limit their downside risk so
2774.88s:  that they can take larger positions by getting in closer to what they would consider to be
2780.64s:  intrinsic value or just wherever they think the floor might be so i think from that context if you
2790.08s:  like it what i do in these instances is even if you don't want to get full exposure right because it
2796.80s:  does look like it's starting to run into some overhead resistance it punched above here and then
2803.12s:  it touched it here here here here and here right so it's been flirting with these levels for a
2810.72s:  little while now so it does look like it's starting to consolidate so what i like to do with stuff
2816.56s:  like this is set some alerts and then gain entry as it's consolidating or right on a breakout from
2824.72s:  the consolidation since in this case it is now consolidating those are the two major periods that
2830.56s:  i like something like this and the way i typically play it is if i get in while it's consolidating
2836.96s:  because i'm trying to get in at a better level then i don't enter quite as heavy i'll start with
2842.48s:  a slightly smaller position maybe like a third to a half of what i ultimately want to put on
2847.92s:  and then as soon as it breaks out then the whole thing's on trades on and then the stop starts to
2854.32s:  come into play or starting to scale out if it starts to fall below the first level of resistance
2862.24s:  and then obviously down below wherever the hard stop would be based on whatever the strategy is
2867.20s:  that you're running so if you're trading something on a bullish one a three month time frame
2871.12s:  that's way more of swing momentum style trade gotta let thoreen
2884.72s:  we got the man with the plan order order here here here you did you did eat your faces all wet
2906.64s:  you could always tell when he eats because his face is wet
2910.64s:  let's stop bippie he is now ready he's been interested in a few different names that we've seen lately
2920.00s:  so for those that don't know i'm actually looking to start a new segment using the dude over here
2928.56s:  as the portfolio manager and what i want to do i've been tinkering with different ways to go about it
2935.68s:  but i essentially want to take the various sectors so all of the s and p 500 sectors
2943.20s:  and i want to put them on my rumba with a treat on top of it and then my game plan is to let him go
2954.08s:  eat three pieces of food whichever three pieces of food he eats we go long and we buy those sectors
2963.12s:  and i don't know if we'll do it on like a monthly time frame or something
2967.76s:  but i think that could be really entertaining so that's the game plan for the little man i'm actually
2975.36s:  glad that you can at least see his fucking eyeball is normally if his eyeball wasn't like this you
2981.04s:  wouldn't even be able to see the white of his eye which he does have but i want to see the segment
2986.96s:  essentially is going to be like can you beat Thor that's what i want to know is
2993.68s:  and the traders out there beat Thor oh boy all right
3003.20s:  we are back at it yes so for for bsx honestly i i like it i think bsx is is solid
3012.96s:  we could take a quick look i'm actually genuinely a little bit curious to see what the
3018.24s:  what the context is behind it because i actually don't know
3023.36s:  and how it's doing compared to other stuff so give me one sec i'm just sending
3031.04s:  dinner order over to mill and let's see so last earning 63 cents
3039.76s:  70 cents what was it expected yeah good earnings let's see what did on its latest earnings
3047.44s:  bsx earnings release all right let's see
3060.08s:  oh this is actually kind of cool
3070.80s:  yeah i want to look at that for sure and then
3081.84s:  this one and this one
3085.76s:  okay so this just looks cool um this really isn't for anything other than the fact that i
3095.92s:  think this is a fun thing to look at
3103.92s:  so this is from jp morgan's healthcare conference have to be honest unfamiliar with the forum
3110.40s:  but obviously familiar with jp morgan and whatnot so let's see what they came out with i'm
3117.44s:  gonna zoom this in
3125.92s:  empowered leadless pacemaker fair point pfa catheter fair flex pfa catheter
3133.60s:  nound cath ice catheter in g watchman new technology like that is always so interesting to me
3145.92s:  organic sales growth of 15 percent
3151.36s:  uh i actually don't know how much i like that that seems a little bit light
3158.16s:  it does look better from adjusted eps and obviously their operating margin expansion is good
3165.92s:  that helps them a lot so they're looking to target 30 percent and then double digit
3172.88s:  adjusted eps growth yeah okay so let's see
3187.04s:  strengthening despite covid impact fly imagine and this kind of company would do well
3191.92s:  uh that's great you can see uh free cash flow on the right hand side of your screen here
3204.40s:  let me move this over and then i'll squish this down just a little bit
3211.44s:  i essentially use the thinkorswim platform as the sizing tool so like i know where to put
3218.32s:  things so that you can see the the whole thing
3223.92s:  but free cash flow is super super solid
3231.04s:  gc says hit the like button or Thor hates you i mean that that is facts he's already
3237.76s:  he's already laying down and he's heated blanket completely over everybody and everything
3243.20s:  until he goes for his walk later he's like his little paws hooked on to himself and everything
3254.16s:  low growth or pacers d-fibs
3261.12s:  business unit cardiology oh this is kind of interesting let's see
3268.64s:  px
3272.40s:  Yeah, looks mostly accumulation is Pelosi in it.
3300.56s:  Honestly, the only thing that matters to us is if Pelosi's in it.
3305.28s:  Damn.
3308.56s:  Bullshit.
3310.08s:  Pelosi's not in it.
3313.84s:  Well, that's just the worst, isn't it?
3317.84s:  Damn.
3320.48s:  Damn.
3320.96s:  I don't know.
3323.12s:  I wonder if we can not click anything.
3328.16s:  That's also fun.
3332.16s:  Damn, it's completely locked up again.
3334.64s:  I wanted to know if we can add like a government tracking tool for us to pay attention to together.
3344.40s:  But this thing is completely locked up again.
3349.52s:  I need to finish this update cycle because it's fucking killing me.
3353.76s:  There it goes.
3355.04s:  Damn boy.
3360.16s:  Let's get through its financials then.
3362.96s:  So this is what I was looking for.
3365.68s:  So cardiology, absolute biggest business unit, man, 2.3 billion.
3376.56s:  Fuck.
3378.80s:  These fucking medical companies are just massive.
3387.76s:  See, like this, I actually don't love some of this slightly slower growth.
3397.76s:  But I mean, overall, it's looking really, really good.
3401.68s:  Yeah, see, like take a look at this medical med surge.
3406.32s:  I'm assuming that's medical surgery is like 7% growth.
3411.52s:  But if you take a look at cardiovascular, it's fucking 27 and 22%.
3416.40s:  So cardiovascular is the place to be for them.
3425.76s:  Yeah, so they're,
3429.44s:  they're looking really, really good.
3432.00s:  And then this I wanted to see.
3435.52s:  Looks like we can.
3438.48s:  So what is this tool?
3442.64s:  What is this tool called?
3445.28s:  Cement trades?
3450.48s:  Insiders FDA.
3453.44s:  I want to see if we can add that.
3457.36s:  God damn it.
3458.48s:  It's locked up again.
3461.04s:  We're never going to get through there.
3462.80s:  So I'm going to leave that alone for now.
3465.52s:  And let me see if there's anything else that you guys want to take a look at.
3478.48s:  Cali Luca says I saw someone doing the same with a gold fish on Wall Street bets versus Wall Street
3483.92s:  bets. That's so funny. How did they do it?
3487.44s:  Cali Luca, how did they do it? Because that's the main thing I'm trying to figure out.
3490.72s:  In my brain, I'm a little too like scientific and not like good scientific, just hack scientific.
3499.68s:  But I try to do things in an actual at least reasonably scientific pure method.
3506.48s:  So like I'm struggling to find a way to get Thor to pick the names
3510.88s:  without him being skewed in some way.
3515.12s:  Like he can be skewed by proximity, whichever treat as close as he might go for,
3519.68s:  which might not actually represent the thing that we're looking for.
3523.68s:  Like I'm trying to figure that part out.
3528.00s:  But yeah, you'll have to let me know how they did it.
3533.28s:  Because I genuinely am really, really curious.
3536.48s:  Because we got to get that we got to get that dialed in because I think that would be so fun
3542.32s:  for a Thor like to watch him do that. I just imagine I can get such a kick out of it.
3551.52s:  There is a chicken trading and account. See like a chicken makes sense too because I feel like
3555.76s:  a chicken is more random. I love this idea. I think it's going to be super fun.
3560.96s:  I just need to figure out how to get the treats or like we don't give them treats.
3566.80s:  We just give them his kibble. But I need to figure out how to get the food to him so that it's
3572.16s:  in an unbiased way. And it's like the true randomness of what he chooses to eat.
3577.68s:  And before we wrap up, I actually had one thing I wanted to run by you,
3585.52s:  which is this, where is it?
3600.64s:  This. But it's completely locked up again. What I'm trying to do is build out the outlier trading
3608.40s:  skills development sessions. So those are the ones that we do Wednesday together.
3612.48s:  So this segment is really designed to be whatever we want it to be. And I try to keep it really
3621.28s:  focused on ways to help build your trading skillset. So I'm not going to wait for this to
3627.60s:  unfreeze because it pissed me off. And I'm going to restart the computer. But if there's
3631.36s:  anything that you would like me to add to the trading skills development, please throw it in
3636.32s:  the chat or hit me up in the discord with it so that I can add it to our list. Right now the
3641.52s:  list is pretty good, but I continually want to keep growing it. So that wraps me up for today.
3650.32s:  As always, if you need anything, let me know being outlier. Feel it.
