0.00s: What's up, outliers, quick market update. And today it's a little bit of a somber one.
4.84s: We have some bad news. Unfortunately, our fan favorite Kenneth C Griffin CEO of Citadel,
14.24s: LLC. It's a real bummer to see these kinds of things come down. It's, man, Citadel
20.76s: securities are going to have to pay a $1 million fine for a loud jid finra rule violations.
27.72s: And you think like how could this happen? Right? Ken obviously cares a lot. He's a man
33.28s: of the people. And for me, I personally hate to see finra SEC bully people that take
43.08s: such good care of us. So let's just get into the details here and see what happened to,
48.28s: to go after our guy here. Because I mean, I might have to start a petition in his favor
53.84s: because this is unbelievable. It's, you got to take care of those who take care of you.
58.72s: So let's read through this. And I have a bunch of things we'll review with respect to
62.52s: this. But from the start of its consolidated audit trail, cat system, I'm just going to
70.12s: refer to it as that instead of that whole thing each time on 22 June 20 through 28 August
75.28s: 24. Citadel securities failed to timely and or accurately report data for tens of billions
83.52s: of equity and option order events. Let's talk about that, right? Tens of billions.
87.72s: I think it's like 42 billion or something like that. I mean, who doesn't make a mistake
92.32s: once in a while, right? I've made mistakes. So it's, it's hard for me to conceive that
96.88s: finra would come down so hard on somebody for making a, just a few mistakes. And you
102.44s: think about it. It's not, it's not like this went on for like decades, right? It's all
105.72s: four years. So it's like, how could we expect something like Citadel and Ken in order
113.80s: to get a system in place to actually fall in line with these crazy compliance metrics
120.16s: and, you know, market transparency. It's like, it's so unreasonable. So to hit him over
125.92s: a four year series of errors and something that amounts right here, right? Three types
132.48s: of errors accounted for 41.8 billion who hasn't made a couple errors in their time. So
139.12s: it feels like feels like a really harsh punishment to me. So let's continue to see the kind
145.08s: of errors we've made did not report zero in the leaves quantity field for certain fully
152.52s: canceled orders impacting 31.2 billion canceled order events applied. The representative
160.32s: eligible indicator looks like we had a little bit of a typo here. See how I, I'm telling
165.04s: you, happens to everybody instead of the representative indicator in to 6.3 billion new order
174.44s: events did not populate the IOC time and force code for 4.3 billion order events. That's
183.28s: like, you know, shit, you just hate to see it. So then if we pop over here, we can find
190.96s: the finra letter right there. You click that. It'll take you to this page. Well, really,
196.24s: it'll take you to one page before this page. Then you can get, I'll just show you so
200.72s: that you can follow along. You go here, you go down to the bottom, you just pop into this
205.08s: bad Larry right here. And then when you click this bad Larry, this one will pop up. And
210.64s: then now we can read through the actual finra filing. And let's, let's just see what, what happened
216.56s: here. So it talks about the background, essentially what's supposed to happen. So from the start
223.76s: of the cat reporting obligation through 28 August 24, there were some errors, a couple errors.
231.84s: And we can see they have a fact list of all the different things, the violations that they have.
238.00s: It's only a few of them, right? So there's just like a couple of small rules here that we're
243.12s: not filing following. You can see the issues laid out. See, look at this, by 22 September,
250.80s: Citadel Securities had remediated the 33 erotypes, the firm experienced up to 31 July. So,
258.16s: you know, they're trying to write their wrongs out here. So, you know, good for them, right?
263.36s: After remediating the 33 erotypes, they identified four additional issues. Who hasn't found
269.68s: another problem after you find one problem? Now, here's the deal that we all, I think, have to take
274.64s: a giant step back and understand. This is, this is an institution with only 64 billion in assets.
282.88s: It's not reasonable for them to have a functioning compliance arm that are staffed with like
289.44s: real people that can follow the rules, right? It's not how, how could they, you can't get that
295.52s: past the budget. I'm sitting here trying to pay a YouTube video editor once in a while and I
299.84s: can only afford to pay him once a week. So, you know, I, I feel them here as a small business owner.
305.84s: It's just, you know, it really resonates. You only have 64 billion to play with. You're only,
310.96s: like, take a look at this. This is, it's a crisis mode. They're essentially making 2.3 billion
317.36s: in a quarter from trading activities. They posted only 6.3 billion in net trading revenue last year,
323.36s: which is down from 7.5 billion a year before. Money's got to come from somewhere. So, I mean,
329.36s: it's not like they're working with a bunch of assets to hire the right people. And if you look
333.36s: at Ken, it's like, well, what's he going to do? Right? Like, he's only 43 billion. So, if you think
339.12s: about what that adds up to, it's just, it's unreasonable. And I think that we actually should take
345.84s: a moment to get to the bottom of this and see what this would look like for them. So, we have
351.36s: Ken and G 43 billion. We have Citadel 64 billion. We have a regular US person might be about $100,000.
358.32s: Right? Maybe total net worth something like that. And we have our really big, bad fine right here.
363.84s: That's this one, which is a million dollars. So, this might look like the math hasn't started yet.
369.68s: It is. It has. We just actually need to add a couple more decimal places. So, in putting this $1
377.28s: million in the context of Ken, G, oil and ore, Citadel's assets, this is what we have. So, you
385.60s: click increased decimal places and you might think Eric, there's an error with your formula.
390.56s: Obviously, it's not mathing. You need to do the formulas. No, it's the formulas there.
395.92s: But we just actually just have to add more decimals to understand what percentage of their net worth
402.40s: this $1 million fine represents. So, let's just click it again. And it's like, oh no, Google
408.08s: Sheets isn't loading at this point because we're at 0.00. We're not even at a rounding factor yet,
414.88s: which is, it can't be that low. Could it? Then we'll click it again and there we go. So, I told you,
422.16s: I told you it was working just fine. So, if we click that out one more time to see what these
426.08s: numbers are, we can see for, you know, Port Ken, this $1 million fine would represent 0.0023%
435.20s: of his total assets. And for the Citadel LLC organization as a whole, this represents 0.0016.
444.48s: So, you can see that it's really taken, this would take a massive toll on Ken, unfortunately.
449.92s: Now, you might be curious, like, I'm a curious kind of person. Let's move these over here.
455.76s: And let's just kind of take a look at an equivalence here. Let's say that you're a normal US person,
461.36s: maybe you have $100,000. And let's take a look at what this equivalent is for you because I would
467.84s: want to know, right? Like, so I can empathize appropriately with Ken and Citadel. I need to
473.76s: understand their plate. So, that's what I aim to do. I want to know out of my money,
479.52s: what's the equivalent percentage? How much am I paying? And we need to see what this looks like
486.96s: because the equivalent of $1 million going to Ken or Citadel, which comes in at this percentage
494.32s: of their total net worth, on $100,000, about $1.56.
503.76s: I'm sure they won't do it again.
