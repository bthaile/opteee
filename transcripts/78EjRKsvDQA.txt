0.00s: What's up, outliers, two pieces for the market update today.
3.84s: I want to talk a little bit about the broad markets because there was a bit of a shakeup
8.00s: today.
9.00s: A lot of that has to do with Jackson Hole and some of the Fed comments we're seeing.
13.24s: Then the second thing is, you know, we're going to take a look at GameStop and see what's
16.74s: going on in there.
18.74s: Starting off with the broad market, bit of a down day, bit of a heavy down day.
23.92s: When I look across the various indices, you can see in the top left here, the S&P 500,
29.96s: had a pretty moderate down day.
33.34s: It's essentially still just shy of where we were hitting previous highs.
38.96s: This has made the best relative recovery and starting to reject back down, but cues
45.16s: is still worse off.
46.64s: We can see cues about made it maybe 80% of the way, ish, back up to near term highs
54.80s: before it started rejecting down today.
57.92s: Then same thing for IWM, about maybe 60% of recovery back up to near term highs and
64.88s: another down day.
65.88s: So what I'm highlighting here first and foremost is that it was down across the board.
69.84s: Everybody was down today.
71.20s: If I were to peg where I saw relative weakness, it was in tech.
74.80s: You can see that by the sides of this candle compared to the others.
79.92s: You can also see that there's very little WIC.
82.16s: This was kind of a one-sided move.
83.92s: You can see that represented also in the volume that you see here today.
87.44s: IWM, a little bit more of a two-sided action with these little baby wicks on both sides.
93.00s: Then spy actually has a bigger tailwick to the downside and then a little baby one to
97.20s: the upside.
98.20s: So all I'm highlighting with talking about the WICs is simply that from a movement perspective,
105.28s: what we saw today in the cues was more decisive and one directional.
110.56s: Interestingly, net highs lows doesn't look bad.
113.28s: So net highs lows definitely contracted pretty meaningfully today in the cues.
120.08s: Yesterday, it was hovering around 112 net highs lows and today's about cut half to 62.
128.64s: So big drop there and for the New York stock exchange, it's kind of still cruising right
134.32s: along.
135.32s: It actually expanded net highs today.
137.28s: Sorry, misspoke.
138.48s: It didn't move much.
139.52s: Yesterday was 142 net highs and today was 136.
143.12s: So not really caring that much and it was gross lows.
146.88s: That stayed peg that 17.
148.64s: So the New York stock exchange right now is still pretty resilient, which is interesting
152.00s: to see small caps continue to be so troubled here.
155.52s: We also saw a down-tick in bonds, which was really interesting.
158.64s: That came down to 1204 and VIX is up ever so slightly.
164.96s: So we're now starting to crack above 17 and a half.
167.68s: Again, I've talked to you guys about some of the way that I like to fade the VIX.
170.56s: Too early for me, I actually have a slightly long VIX position on right now in VIX futures.
176.80s: And it's literally just to offset some of the other index stuff I have on.
182.16s: And it'll probably come down pretty quick.
183.84s: I'm not really expecting volatility to start accelerating overly meaningfully here.
187.92s: Now, the other thing today is there's a bunch, a bunch of economic data and news that came out
194.00s: that I think we should take a quick look at together.
197.04s: So we can see jobless claims came in right on top of consensus.
201.92s: We can see that global manufacturing PMI came in a little bit light and services came in a
209.12s: little bit over expectations. So as I'm looking through this, it's a bit of a mix back today.
217.28s: And tomorrow we have Powell speaking, which will be really, really informative.
223.60s: I think the market is a little bit pensive here with respect to how the economy is doing.
228.72s: We're continuing to see some mixed signals flowing in.
232.32s: And I think everybody is kind of waiting to see what this cut picture ultimately ends up looking
239.12s: like. So if I take a look at the Fed watch tool, surprisingly, the probability of a 25 basis point
245.76s: cut actually increased pretty massively, which I have to be honest with you, I didn't expect this.
252.40s: So for a while, we were trending a little heavier on the probability of a 50
257.92s: basis point cut. And it's slowing down and it's moving further in favor of a 25 base point
264.64s: cut, which I imagine is kind of a little bit better news. I guess technically speaking,
269.12s: because it means that things aren't coming crashing down and we need to start, you know,
272.64s: reversing policy super fast, but it still surprises me just a little bit.
276.80s: So the next thing we got to take a look at, you already know it is the crowd favorite.
281.84s: GME volume, man, it's just not here. We are just not seeing volume yet. Volume today was 3.3
289.84s: million. By volume was 150,000. Just sale volume is 3.2 million. So the overwhelming majority
300.48s: of volume today was to the sales side. And that's not overly surprising, right? It is a fairly
308.40s: non-trivial down day for the market. One of the bigger down days we've seen year to date. So
313.84s: again, for context, if I grab IWM and I show you this candle today, it's to be clear, it's had
318.64s: plenty of big down days. But on a near term basis, this has been one of the larger down days that we've
326.08s: seen. And as I look across, it's especially IWM has had quite a few actually of these bigger
332.00s: down days. So maybe I'm thinking more so. Let me check Spy really quick. That's more so what I'm
337.68s: thinking because you can see Spy has definitely had a few of them here, here, here, here, that this
343.20s: day aligns with more, but it's probably like the top wind tile, like top 10% or so. Whereas IWM has
350.88s: been getting beat up a little bit more here, unfortunately, but it is consolidating. So that
355.76s: part's good. There wasn't some massive rejection today. Markets go two directions. And we've had
360.96s: this really aggressive move up and out a little less aggressive in something like IWM. But
366.48s: all I'm saying in this context is we see some downward pressure, right? Take a look at the
372.00s: at the money, put call ratio 3.4 to one. So people really are kind of positioning very specifically
380.32s: in the product, at least for the front expiration or for the next primary expiration. Sorry.
386.64s: But when I look at something like GME, it's down today unsurprising 1.9%, but that's not the end
393.20s: of the world considering the broader landscape of what's moving. So GME continues to consolidate.
398.88s: As long as I see it maintaining this consolidation movement, I really don't dislike that for it,
404.08s: because it's at least not getting rejected down to new lows. We're starting to arrive at a new
409.76s: consensus value for where people think this thing is a good buy at, which you can see coming through,
414.56s: like tons of people have been transacting in this 22 handle. So a quick stroll over to the options.
422.08s: And volume today was super light yet again. 65,000 calls against 15,000 puts still calls you,
430.88s: but just very light. This is again, very, very light for what we typically see in GameStop. And
435.84s: I'll continue to reiterate a few important points because when I see them change, that will be
440.72s: important. So you'll hear me say some of the same stuff, such as right now, I see the expiration
447.84s: all over the place, meaning current call input ally is scattered. For the put ally, there's a little
453.92s: bit of a drift to further and future explorations. Whereas so here you can see on the put side,
460.56s: the largest tranches are in 17, June 25. We see 18 oct 24. That's kind of the next biggest one
468.00s: here. We see 20 set. That's kind of the only 20 set you see out here. So for the put side,
474.08s: it's mostly kicked out into the future on the call side. It's a mixed bag, a little bit of all
478.56s: over the place. The other thing I told you, I'm continuing to keep an eyeball on, is this right here
484.56s: and this trade has actually been coming in nicely for me now on a really small scale,
489.68s: because it's not doing a whole lot. But I've been talking to you about this six step expectation
494.00s: that that wall will continue to increase the first time I was looking at it was like mid 70s,
498.80s: trade out up to 78 79 now to 83, which is what I expect to see. I still expect to see the
503.84s: six step expiration cycle volatility continue to expand because that's right now when earnings is
509.20s: and I would expect to see the earnings cycle not necessarily to be like massively volatile,
514.00s: but much more than the others. And then this also popped up on my radar as a pure anomaly.
518.80s: You can see, Vol in what is this, the 27 set. Yeah, 27 set goes from 80.91 percent to four
527.36s: October 41.28 percent. So cut in half. And then 18 oct back up to 88 and a half. So that's
535.04s: another mispricing. I think that I'm waiting to see if it's literally just a print error or something
541.28s: that's a little more persistent tomorrow than I can trade. But just another volatility anomaly.
546.48s: So in this case, you could tell a lot of what I'm doing is trading vol in the product. And it's just
551.20s: because the delta, meaning directional movement of it, it's just not showing up in any significant
558.00s: force for the time being. So that's what I got for today. As always, anything you want me to take a
563.12s: look at, let me know. There was a couple, um, people, couple things, people email to me. So I'm
567.76s: going to try to hit those in the live session later today at five PM Pacific time. So come hang
572.80s: out then if you're so inclined to talk a little bit more about the market specifically. But in the
576.88s: meantime, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
