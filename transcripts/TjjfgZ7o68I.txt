0.00s: What's up, outliers? Happy Sunday. Today's video is just a quick market outlook for what's
6.32s: coming up for the week ahead and we'll get right off to the races. So last week we saw
12.84s: a pretty significant rotation. You can see across the primary futures, the E-minis here
18.88s: had a really strong rally as the NASDAQ as did Russell. Now, when I look across the
23.68s: different indices, I still see the S&P 500 kind of being the top performer here as it's
28.76s: very, very reasonably closing in on near term highs. These are all three month daily charts.
34.92s: We can see that NASDAQ still has a way to go. Right now it's at 19, 872 and it needs
41.44s: to get essentially to 2100 ish and the Russell is still behind by a moderate amount as well
48.80s: with the term high here at 2320 and right now it's running at 2209. So what does that tell
54.64s: me? It tells me that the S&P 500 obviously is leading in terms of overall strength but
59.68s: then it also gives me some glimpses is to where the strength is coming from. So if we take
64.92s: a look within the individual exchanges and sectors, we'll see two things that are really
71.76s: important. The first thing is you'll see that for the NASDAQ, it's still starting to
78.04s: show highs but just very recently. And then if we took at the New York Stock Exchange,
83.52s: it is really, really running green. Now here's the interesting thing is even as IWM was
92.50s: collapsing and again NASDAQ and IWM they're not like a one to one in terms of what's on
98.64s: the New York Stock Exchange just an important admin note but they're decent proxies for
105.20s: kind of broad market behavior. So when we look across the New York Stock Exchange, we
109.52s: can see that there was pretty significant strength even as IWM is rolling over, even as
115.90s: the Qs were running over and even as the S&P 500 were rolling over. We can see that gross
121.16s: lows were definitely opening up but that tells me that this down move was being precipitated
126.92s: by a handful of larger names, not the breadth of names. Breath mean how many are there,
133.34s: definitely not the most of them, right? Because it maintained net highs even during this
138.94s: across the board, across all the individual indices. So what this means to me at a high
145.30s: level is pocketed strength. It means that when we're looking to stack strength like I
151.82s: talk about frequently when coming up with directional dispositions, I want to have as
157.18s: many factors in my favor as possible. Well, I can tell you one of those factors that's
162.78s: not here right now is all of the indices moving up uniformly. We can see that even now
169.90s: the Qs, it's still for a three month standard deviation channel is negative sloping. Now,
177.22s: as I've mentioned before, it's getting near what I would consider to be a couple really
181.34s: important levels. We can see that the point of control on a volume profile for the Qs
186.10s: is at 480, 481 and we can see that there's a lot of congestion just below that as well.
191.94s: So what that tells me is for tech, I want to know how it behaves in this region here massively.
200.02s: Because if it starts breaking above, then I start thinking, okay, looks like bullish
205.30s: resumption. If it gets stuck here and starts to reject down, notice what that would build.
213.26s: We have a high, we have a lower high. Right now, this is a lower high. So if this stays
218.78s: down here is a lower high, then we are literally assuming a downtrend where the next expectation
224.90s: would be a lower low below this. But right now, when you see these kinds of configurations,
230.38s: the chart it literally can go either way for any reason. Now, there's some economic events
235.34s: coming up this coming week that I think will actually help this a little bit in terms
239.46s: to the upside. But we never know. And we have to wait and see. Our job as traders is
245.66s: to come up with ideas, probabilistic assessments about what we think may or may not happen.
250.50s: But I'm going to wait until I can see some level of confirmation before I start committing
257.42s: large sums of capital. Again, I've said this a few times. I have exposure to all three
261.38s: indices right now through futures, but I'm still not heavily committed. So I'm in a holding
268.74s: pattern here. So that's what I'm really eager to see in the cues specifically. Now, let's
276.42s: take a quick look at what we have coming up the week ahead. And there's some meaningful releases,
284.26s: not is quite of a busy week, but obviously there's a really important release coming up that
291.06s: will go over in a second being the fed rate statement. But I mean, in terms of other inflation
295.46s: indicators that's a little quiet. So we have retail sales coming out on the 17th, the 16th
301.70s: is super quiet. It's just the manufacturing index. I read this for context, but I don't really
308.42s: read too far into it. So we have retail sales, industrial production, the housing market index,
314.26s: I always like reading because I'm also a real estate investor. So I kind of like understanding
318.90s: how overall housing market is performing really just for that context. So that's the same reason
323.70s: why care about things like housing starts and building permits. But here's where it starts to
329.54s: become really important. You can see on the 18th, we have the FOMC rate statement and economic
338.82s: projections along with the rate decision. So this is going to be massively important because if we
346.18s: take a look at the current market expectations, they're very, very specific. So if we pop over here
352.18s: to the Fed watch tool, get rid of their pop up. But maybe not. Well, look at that. Not even lined up.
358.98s: If I hit my crosshair right on there, it's no good. It's lined up down here. Tricky, tricky.
363.70s: So if you look at the comparison probabilities, this is actually new. So we now see a higher
370.42s: probability of a 50 basis point cut. That's new. That's brand new because just yesterday in the day
378.66s: before, it was 50, 50 and then even tilted a little heavier for a 25 basis point cut. So
384.66s: fascinating. The only thing that I find interesting about this is in my opinion, it seems like
389.70s: largely the market has a 25 basis point cut already priced in. I think that if we see the cut,
395.62s: it's insanely likely that we see some sort of follow through from the broad market, kind of
400.42s: just seeing that we're moving down that path of rate cuts. If it's a 50 basis point cut,
405.62s: I would imagine a little bit more of a movement or the market could start getting a little
410.98s: concerned actually. It wouldn't surprise me because I still think the market would be bid up,
417.22s: but I think overall cautiousness and nervousness would start to come out more because if you think
422.10s: about the campaign that Powell has maintained, it's been very communicative, very steady,
427.30s: and it's been very slow and methodical, like very slow. We even been waiting so long to cut rates
433.46s: where a lot of people have been arguing this should have started like six months ago at the late
438.02s: end. So it would be actually kind of surprising to me to see Powell go through his real, real focus
445.70s: on controlling inflation, his sphere of inflation, spiking back up once we start cutting rates because
450.02s: that's a whole other problem set. And to start with the 50 basis point cut, actually to me would
455.38s: start to indicate that they don't feel like they have the same runway that they've been communicating
460.82s: because that's one of the luxuries they've had about the rate they've been able to move so
465.22s: slowly and methodically because things aren't breaking all over the place yet. We've been very
471.46s: economically resilient. We've seen some spikes and drops in things like employment,
476.58s: productivity metrics, stuff like that, but we're not seeing like depression level signals or
481.22s: anything like that. So I am now really, really eager actually to see if this materializes because
490.18s: I could see this going either way. Again, I would imagine in terms of price, we would see near-term
495.06s: positive price movement, but I imagine we would see sentiment change a little bit and people
500.74s: starting to get a little bit kind of curious about we've had this really, really cautious cycle so far.
507.22s: We've waited so long to start cutting to start with the 50 basis point cut. To me would
514.10s: indicate something else in their messaging that we would have to pay really close attention to
517.94s: because by all accounts, I think most across the market would presume a 25 basis point cut and
524.10s: kind of see what happens. It wouldn't even surprise me to see a cut a pause than a cut because
530.26s: again, they face a really, really delicate challenge here. And if the scenario comes where inflation
537.14s: starts to spike back up after they start cutting, that's really difficult to get back under control
542.74s: meaningfully. So very interesting. So that's going to be on the 18th though. That's going to be a
549.14s: really, really volatile day on a relative basis. Again, not looking to be hyperbolic or anything,
554.26s: but if we take a look at, we'll grab SPX for this example and we take a look at the volatility,
560.74s: you can see 15, 16, 19, 19, 19. So we're really, really interested about this time period where we're
568.26s: going to see the rate statement come out again, totally as expected. So the other thing that we
575.06s: have coming up, jobless claims, sorry, that's just a little alert. Jobless claims on the 19th,
582.26s: which again, that's going to be another really important metric, believe it or not. And the reason
586.18s: why that's becoming important is because there is a couple of revisions that we had and now everybody's
591.14s: kind of looking at this metric a little more closely, I think. So we have again, not a ton
597.70s: of data coming out this week, but we have a few things that are much higher impact, specifically
603.22s: rate statements and things like that. So I'm interested to see essentially how that goes.
609.54s: Now, from a broader market perspective, I've already talked about a few of these trades.
614.58s: I've really been rotating through a bunch of different stuff. Right now, my portfolio is still
620.18s: heavily positioned to be in my core allocation with speculative allocations running. So things like HAL
627.86s: was a ratio put diagonal that I had on that I took off because it essentially did what I wanted
634.02s: and it started bottoming out. So I actually still think this looks good to the downside to be clear,
639.86s: but you can see where my alert sits and essentially where we hit as a high on the 13th was 2844.
649.94s: So I was six cents shy of that. So at that point, the trade had generally run its course.
655.14s: It wasn't a really long-term trade. It was just general short in energy. And for those that are
660.66s: curious what the ratio put the agnol look like, it's really, really simple. All I'm doing is something
666.66s: like going out into 15 know I'll buy a in the money put. So something like this.
673.14s: Get rid of that. And I realized I accidentally did the opposite trades. We'll do buy.
678.42s: And then what I do is I sell typically closer to today. Really, it was the 20 steps that I had on,
686.98s: but it would be something around here. And I would sell out of the money puts against it.
692.26s: And the way that this would work is typically I maintain a very specific ratio that I like to run.
699.06s: So for example, I might have in this example, like maybe 10
704.10s: longs against three shorts. This is smaller than I would put on, but that's kind of like where it
708.90s: starts to become representative of the disposition I have. And it's really just designed to
714.02s: play to the downside. The short puts can be rolled if I want to try to salvage profit out of them,
719.78s: but it gives me two different profit mechanisms. That's the point of the trade. This was a just really
724.90s: simple, really simple trade. Now in terms of finding good shorts, now it becomes a little more
731.46s: interesting to me because if we look at energy, it's starting to bid up. This is what I was shorting
735.86s: before. So as I look for things that look kind of ugly that are rotating over, the best still is
742.66s: energy, but not right now because it's being bid up. I need to see how that rolls. I see XLV,
748.18s: which is kind of trending sideways. What I'm highlighting is from a high level. I'm actually not
753.62s: seeing a whole lot jumping out at me that I want to go short. XLV would still be towards the top
758.10s: of the list. XLF is getting there. I actually had some short puts in Bank of America that I took
763.22s: down at a loss because it was essentially a bullish trade. They weren't in the money yet, but it
769.46s: started not doing what I wanted it to do. So I managed those pretty quickly. And yeah, so to find
776.98s: short deltas becomes a little more interesting when I look across all of the indices and I'm not
782.90s: seeing significant weakness except for XLE, which again is now starting to get bid up before it was
788.66s: easy, right? You just go to XLE. It was falling off a cliff. You ride that to the downside. I don't
793.46s: like going short tech. So now it's just a matter of finding other opportunities to capture some short
799.46s: deltas. The last thing I want to take a look at is the calendar. And it's because for those that
806.50s: don't know, we still have some earnings on the docket that I like to see. So things like Riley,
814.10s: GIS, FDX, those are all well within play and you AC and CCL. So for this month, it's kind of like
821.46s: the stragglers. But then as soon as you click to the next month, guess what? We start with the banks.
828.18s: So we're coming into the next earning season. That's kind of the cool part about being an
831.86s: option trader is that as soon as you wrap up one options trading season, the next ones kicking
836.82s: off right away. And we're going to start with the banks. So I'm already prepping the portfolio
841.86s: to essentially take positions in earnings plays, making sure I have capital ready to move there.
847.54s: But just putting that on everybody else's radar because it is on mine. Now for the outlier pro
854.66s: live stream later today, I'm going to go through a bunch of my positions, talk about some of the
859.14s: updates I've made recently. And then we got a bunch of scanning to do to look for opportunities.
864.10s: But for everybody else, you know, happy to connect more on that stuff tomorrow during the YouTube
868.10s: live stream. As always, if there's anything that you want to cover any questions you have,
872.34s: let me know be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
