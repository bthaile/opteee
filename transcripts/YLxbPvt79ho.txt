 How many times have you put on a trade and over the life of that trade you said, whoa, did not expect that to happen? Unfortunately, that happens way too frequently far more than it should and it's because most people do not have a defined trade management plan before they place their trades. So that is the goal of this video. I want to walk you through this concept and then at the end of the video, I'm going to give you nine simple questions to ask yourself before placing every trade going forward takes just a few minutes and then you should have far fewer of those occurrences. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and shout out to the Patreon family. If you guys enjoy what I do consider signing up, it helps me, pay my editor so that we can make cooler stuff for you. Okay, so let's talk about this idea of why trade management flow and really this is pretty simple. You just get to turn to boom, I've written book and here's what I got. This homie says holding options into X-Berry, I have puts expiring 15 December for those curious today is 6 December and they say currently down 85% and then it says if I think these will be in the money December 15th, if I hold them will it turn into a short position could I then close the position and receive total investment trying to figure out what to do here also do I need funds in my account to exercise options. It's a lot of questions about a position that's on already. This isn't a great time to try to figure these details out so let's check out another person. This person has garmic calls that are up 300% that expire on 19 January. Is it a good time to get out? That's not a great question to ask either. You're already in the trade. People do this all the time. So why does this matter? Why am I talking about this concept with you guys? It's for these reasons right here. This is from my website. You can check out a whole list of different studies but what I'm trying to highlight between this and this is that if you want to succeed in this business you have to think differently than most people because this right here is what most people do. They place trades and then they figure it out as they go which is an awful, awful way to approach making money. So now I want to talk about the concepts behind this trade management flow. So here's the deal. The idea of a trade management flow for me it has two different versions. There is a generalized version which is what we're going to talk about today and then there's a strategy specific version that's outlined in your trading plan that you have right? What plan? It's outlined there that's specified then to the specific strategy. So the goal here is if we create a generalized approach then when we go to make and update the versions we have in our trading plans we don't have to reinvent the wheel each time because yes some of the specific details pertaining to a trade will vary by strategy but you can get the architecture in place so that you can create a repeatable and efficient system so they don't have to recreate this thing every single time you do it. And then this is probably the most important part of this whole thing right here. It's a thought exercise. For those that don't understand what I'm talking about here let me break it down. I'm going to put myself front and center for you guys so we can have a conversation here. When you think about a lot of your behaviors as a trader there are a lot of things that carry over from your day to day life that do not carry over well into trading. So the entire idea behind this thought exercise is to accept that fact and then to put you through the paces ahead of time so that you can pre-emptively think what might happen what you might do and then to weigh the pros and cons of these decisions so that you don't make a bad game time decision. In the Marine Corps we do this all the time with the planning process. We have a thing called a five-paragraph order and before we do anything from exercises to missions you will outline a plan. Now very frequently what happens out in the real world will differ from your plan. Things happen all the time but the plan gets you to a point where making those audibles you end up making much better decisions because you've thought through most of these things ahead of time. Okay so I hope that point is loud and clear for you guys and the last thing I want to highlight here is that it's informative. When we're thinking about trade management a lot of times you're probably thinking about the individual occurrence of a trade but the world of trading if you're good at this it's going to spend a long time. There should be literally tens of thousands of trades over a 40-50 year trading career so if you think about that you need to be able to create a feedback loop so that you're receiving good information so that you can optimize what you're doing and thus make more money. Okay so now let's talk about the flow because everybody loves my handwriting. Okay I figured I would put some of it in here for you and provide a voice over. I'm actually not kidding somebody reached out to me and asked me to not type everything because part of the reason is why they like the channels because I write like a child. I've that's like such an anomaly because everybody is just like bro I can't read your shit and I don't blame you guys so I'll read it to you as well. This is going to pick up at a specific point in a trade flow being that we already have a hypothesis and we've already identified a strategy so I have another video on scanning for trades that kind of goes over this section of this process. I'll throw a link to that in the notes below so picking up from there we first need to figure out our size for the trade. This is the first part of your trade management is to determine the what I like to call the total allocation. This is the total sum of money you are willing to apply to this trade in its lifespan. Yes this should be defined ahead of time because a lot of times traders like to do a lot of bad things that lose the money like adding money to a losing trade so to protect against that we're also going to determine what initial outlay we want to give and then what our rules are for scaling. So we're going to get to nine questions that pertain to this flow in general in a second. I'm just going to walk you through the rest of these details quickly. We're going to have a section that confirms or denies our hypothesis. We're going to have a very clear understanding of our profit and loss management of approach and then we're going to identify how we're going to track the results so that we can identify what works for the strategy what doesn't work and you can optimize the strategy itself. So now let's get to these nine questions. The very first one is how much capital does this position get. So as you'll notice for each of these broad buckets there are a couple questions that pertain to all of them. These nine questions once you get to the end of them they will get you to a point that you've thought through most of the big things in a trade that can hurt you. So there are going to be far less occurrences that you're in the middle of a trade and you don't know what to do. So in this case how much capital does the trade get? What's the initial outlay meaning what is the or of that total allocation that you're going to give this position over its lifespan. How much do you want to enter in first? The way I think about that is the more convicted I am upfront the more I'm going to scale in upfront. Some strategies really don't need a bunch of scaling so I might have an initial outlay that's 85 or 90 percent. Some strategies rely pretty heavily on scaling like the coverage strangle so I might keep it below 75 percent on average. Something like that. Then we need to define how do you scale in and out. So going back to this example from that dude that says they have Garmin calls that went up a bunch that expire in January. Maybe I don't know when they answered the trade but maybe before you place that trade you say okay I think that this thing is going to pop for whatever reason or continue following this trend. I have no idea what their hypothesis was but based on that hypothesis of a long call I'm just going to pretend as if I had placed a long call somewhere in here. My hypothesis here is that it's not a really long DTE option so it's going to decay pretty quickly and in this case I'm probably just going to apply a trend following approach where I might use this nine day or the 21 day or the variance between the two in conjunction with a cross below the nine as a way for me to start scaling out of the position and I have a stop that I slowly move up to the previous perceived support provided it makes good P&L sense. So in this case let's say we entered here that is my general profit in loss slash management plan. For my loss if I drop below wherever I think near term support is so in this case let's say somewhere down here if it drops below 109 I'm wrong that's when I need to start getting out I need to be completely out by the time it gets to 108 sub 108 something like that and then to the upside as I look at this I'll say okay I think it's going to go up and I'm pretending we're starting here and as it starts to go up I'm going to just slowly move up that stop so then let's say we're up to this point and it's trading at 120 I'm going to move my stop from down here at 109 all the way up here to somewhere around 115 near term support and then I might use this nine day moving average to follow more tightly because this is kind of a parabolic move for sure where if price starts to close below the nine I'm going to begin scaling out while I maintain moving up this stop but you can think through all of this before you place your trade. The next thing we have to ask ourselves is how can I get hurt holding this this idea is to get us to think about what things can damage our position and not just focusing on the things that are going or we hope go well you should spend more time thinking about this so going back to that Garmin example if they bought a call again let's just pretend it was here and what can hurt them well in this case what would hurt them is if Garmin goes down that's what's going to hurt them so they need to think about what circumstances could lead Garmin to go down and have some ideas on this next part their max risk and how are they going to manage the risk so again back to this example in Garmin maybe their max risk is the long call that they bought and they're comfortable risking that entire premium their max risk is now defined now let's say that they're actually trading a 10 lot and they don't want to accept a max risk anymore so you have to define where you're going to get out before you get to your maximum risk exposure that you're trying to avoid you just determine it ahead of time how do we know if our if we're right how do we know if we're wrong again very simple if we entered here and I see Garmin trading down below my mental stop and then my hard stop I'm wrong I thought it was going to go up it went down I'm wrong how do I know if I'm right if I'm moving my stop up following price as it moves up I know I'm correct because now instead of booking in a loss I now book in at least neutral trade and then you slowly start to lock in profits from there when I'm thinking about different kinds of strategies the specific details on scaling in scaling out how I manage risk becomes strategy specific but the concept of defining it is universal so as I'm talking about this specific long call Garmin situation that's me thinking of this as a speculative directional trade so I'm applying that methodology here now we already talked about managing profits and losses by trend following because that's what this specific strategy calls for and then the last thing is what metrics are important for me to track in general you're going to need to look at things like expectancy for again this specific strategy what makes us correct being directionally correct so we need to track our capacity to be directionally correct so this is your homework before every trade you put on ask yourself these nine questions this is not an exhaustive list of pre-trade research you can do but the point being is to make it portable and light enough that people will be compliant in following something like this the problem is sometimes the good idea fairy strikes us and then we have a list of 62 things that whenever you go to put the trade on next time you're like oh shit this is gonna take me three hours before I replace a trade that's not gonna work I wish I didn't hear that but I just heard that so you got to find a balance between getting you to a point where you're finding the important details but it's portable and simple enough that you can execute it and you will consistently execute it this is a non-negotiable step of trading if you want to be an outlier see you guys later
