0.00s: How many times have you put on a trade and over the life of that trade you said,
4.00s: whoa, did not expect that to happen? Unfortunately, that happens way too
8.96s: frequently far more than it should and it's because most people do not have a
13.68s: defined trade management plan before they place their trades. So that is the goal
19.04s: of this video. I want to walk you through this concept and then at the end of the video,
22.96s: I'm going to give you nine simple questions to ask yourself before placing every trade
28.40s: going forward takes just a few minutes and then you should have far fewer of those
32.80s: occurrences. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and shout out to
36.72s: the Patreon family. If you guys enjoy what I do consider signing up, it helps me,
41.92s: pay my editor so that we can make cooler stuff for you. Okay, so let's talk about this idea of
46.64s: why trade management flow and really this is pretty simple. You just get to turn to boom,
52.00s: I've written book and here's what I got. This homie says holding options into
57.60s: X-Berry, I have puts expiring 15 December for those curious today is 6 December and they say
63.92s: currently down 85% and then it says if I think these will be in the money December 15th,
71.76s: if I hold them will it turn into a short position could I then close the position and receive
77.12s: total investment trying to figure out what to do here also do I need funds in my account to exercise
83.28s: options. It's a lot of questions about a position that's on already. This isn't a great time to
89.92s: try to figure these details out so let's check out another person. This person has garmic calls that
94.96s: are up 300% that expire on 19 January. Is it a good time to get out? That's not a great question
101.68s: to ask either. You're already in the trade. People do this all the time. So why does this matter?
107.04s: Why am I talking about this concept with you guys? It's for these reasons right here. This is
112.00s: from my website. You can check out a whole list of different studies but what I'm trying to highlight
117.52s: between this and this is that if you want to succeed in this business you have to think differently
125.28s: than most people because this right here is what most people do. They place trades and then they
132.80s: figure it out as they go which is an awful, awful way to approach making money. So now I want to talk
141.44s: about the concepts behind this trade management flow. So here's the deal. The idea of a trade
146.96s: management flow for me it has two different versions. There is a generalized version which is what
153.68s: we're going to talk about today and then there's a strategy specific version that's outlined in
159.76s: your trading plan that you have right? What plan? It's outlined there that's specified then to
167.28s: the specific strategy. So the goal here is if we create a generalized approach then when we go to
174.48s: make and update the versions we have in our trading plans we don't have to reinvent the wheel each
179.84s: time because yes some of the specific details pertaining to a trade will vary by strategy but
186.80s: you can get the architecture in place so that you can create a repeatable and efficient system
193.92s: so they don't have to recreate this thing every single time you do it. And then this is probably
199.36s: the most important part of this whole thing right here. It's a thought exercise. For those that
204.16s: don't understand what I'm talking about here let me break it down. I'm going to put myself front
208.24s: and center for you guys so we can have a conversation here. When you think about a lot of your
212.88s: behaviors as a trader there are a lot of things that carry over from your day to day life that do
219.20s: not carry over well into trading. So the entire idea behind this thought exercise is to accept
226.72s: that fact and then to put you through the paces ahead of time so that you can pre-emptively think
234.08s: what might happen what you might do and then to weigh the pros and cons of these decisions so
240.80s: that you don't make a bad game time decision. In the Marine Corps we do this all the time with the
247.04s: planning process. We have a thing called a five-paragraph order and before we do anything from exercises
253.04s: to missions you will outline a plan. Now very frequently what happens out in the real world will
260.48s: differ from your plan. Things happen all the time but the plan gets you to a point where making
267.04s: those audibles you end up making much better decisions because you've thought through most of
273.20s: these things ahead of time. Okay so I hope that point is loud and clear for you guys and the last
278.88s: thing I want to highlight here is that it's informative. When we're thinking about trade management a
282.72s: lot of times you're probably thinking about the individual occurrence of a trade but the world
287.60s: of trading if you're good at this it's going to spend a long time. There should be literally tens of
292.16s: thousands of trades over a 40-50 year trading career so if you think about that you need to be able
298.40s: to create a feedback loop so that you're receiving good information so that you can optimize what
304.40s: you're doing and thus make more money. Okay so now let's talk about the flow because everybody
310.08s: loves my handwriting. Okay I figured I would put some of it in here for you and provide a voice over.
316.24s: I'm actually not kidding somebody reached out to me and asked me to not type everything because
320.40s: part of the reason is why they like the channels because I write like a child. I've that's like
324.40s: such an anomaly because everybody is just like bro I can't read your shit and I don't blame you guys
328.08s: so I'll read it to you as well. This is going to pick up at a specific point in a trade flow
333.28s: being that we already have a hypothesis and we've already identified a strategy so I have another
338.56s: video on scanning for trades that kind of goes over this section of this process. I'll throw a link to
345.04s: that in the notes below so picking up from there we first need to figure out our size for the trade.
350.80s: This is the first part of your trade management is to determine the what I like to call the total
355.36s: allocation. This is the total sum of money you are willing to apply to this trade in its lifespan.
360.96s: Yes this should be defined ahead of time because a lot of times traders like to do a lot of bad things
367.44s: that lose the money like adding money to a losing trade so to protect against that we're also going
373.04s: to determine what initial outlay we want to give and then what our rules are for scaling.
379.20s: So we're going to get to nine questions that pertain to this flow in general in a second. I'm just
383.52s: going to walk you through the rest of these details quickly. We're going to have a section that
387.52s: confirms or denies our hypothesis. We're going to have a very clear understanding of our profit and
393.28s: loss management of approach and then we're going to identify how we're going to track the results so
399.04s: that we can identify what works for the strategy what doesn't work and you can optimize the
404.88s: strategy itself. So now let's get to these nine questions. The very first one is how much capital
410.96s: does this position get. So as you'll notice for each of these broad buckets there are a couple
415.44s: questions that pertain to all of them. These nine questions once you get to the end of them they
420.24s: will get you to a point that you've thought through most of the big things in a trade that can
425.52s: hurt you. So there are going to be far less occurrences that you're in the middle of a trade and
430.24s: you don't know what to do. So in this case how much capital does the trade get? What's the initial
434.96s: outlay meaning what is the or of that total allocation that you're going to give this position over
439.92s: its lifespan. How much do you want to enter in first? The way I think about that is the more convicted
444.80s: I am upfront the more I'm going to scale in upfront. Some strategies really don't need a bunch of
451.28s: scaling so I might have an initial outlay that's 85 or 90 percent. Some strategies rely pretty
456.80s: heavily on scaling like the coverage strangle so I might keep it below 75 percent on average.
461.60s: Something like that. Then we need to define how do you scale in and out. So going back to this
467.52s: example from that dude that says they have Garmin calls that went up a bunch that expire in January.
473.12s: Maybe I don't know when they answered the trade but maybe before you place that trade you say okay
478.56s: I think that this thing is going to pop for whatever reason or continue following this trend. I
482.48s: have no idea what their hypothesis was but based on that hypothesis of a long call I'm just going to
486.96s: pretend as if I had placed a long call somewhere in here. My hypothesis here is that it's not a really
492.56s: long DTE option so it's going to decay pretty quickly and in this case I'm probably just going to
497.84s: apply a trend following approach where I might use this nine day or the 21 day or the variance
504.24s: between the two in conjunction with a cross below the nine as a way for me to start scaling out
509.60s: of the position and I have a stop that I slowly move up to the previous perceived support provided it
516.64s: makes good P&L sense. So in this case let's say we entered here that is my general profit in loss
522.80s: slash management plan. For my loss if I drop below wherever I think near term support is so in this
530.00s: case let's say somewhere down here if it drops below 109 I'm wrong that's when I need to start
534.88s: getting out I need to be completely out by the time it gets to 108 sub 108 something like that
539.84s: and then to the upside as I look at this I'll say okay I think it's going to go up and I'm pretending
544.64s: we're starting here and as it starts to go up I'm going to just slowly move up that stop so then
551.60s: let's say we're up to this point and it's trading at 120 I'm going to move my stop from down here
557.04s: at 109 all the way up here to somewhere around 115 near term support and then I might use this
564.00s: nine day moving average to follow more tightly because this is kind of a parabolic move for sure
569.04s: where if price starts to close below the nine I'm going to begin scaling out while I maintain
575.36s: moving up this stop but you can think through all of this before you place your trade. The next
581.36s: thing we have to ask ourselves is how can I get hurt holding this this idea is to get us to think
587.92s: about what things can damage our position and not just focusing on the things that are going or
594.32s: we hope go well you should spend more time thinking about this so going back to that Garmin example
600.72s: if they bought a call again let's just pretend it was here and what can hurt them well in this
605.84s: case what would hurt them is if Garmin goes down that's what's going to hurt them so they need to
611.44s: think about what circumstances could lead Garmin to go down and have some ideas on this next part
617.92s: their max risk and how are they going to manage the risk so again back to this example in Garmin
625.20s: maybe their max risk is the long call that they bought and they're comfortable risking that entire
632.08s: premium their max risk is now defined now let's say that they're actually trading a 10 lot and
638.00s: they don't want to accept a max risk anymore so you have to define where you're going to get out
644.40s: before you get to your maximum risk exposure that you're trying to avoid you just determine it
650.32s: ahead of time how do we know if our if we're right how do we know if we're wrong again very simple
656.08s: if we entered here and I see Garmin trading down below my mental stop and then my hard stop I'm wrong
664.24s: I thought it was going to go up it went down I'm wrong how do I know if I'm right if I'm moving my
669.60s: stop up following price as it moves up I know I'm correct because now instead of booking in a loss
675.84s: I now book in at least neutral trade and then you slowly start to lock in profits from there
682.32s: when I'm thinking about different kinds of strategies the specific details on scaling in scaling
689.20s: out how I manage risk becomes strategy specific but the concept of defining it is universal so as I'm
696.80s: talking about this specific long call Garmin situation that's me thinking of this as a speculative
702.64s: directional trade so I'm applying that methodology here now we already talked about managing profits
708.72s: and losses by trend following because that's what this specific strategy calls for and then the
713.76s: last thing is what metrics are important for me to track in general you're going to need to look
717.68s: at things like expectancy for again this specific strategy what makes us correct being directionally
723.60s: correct so we need to track our capacity to be directionally correct so this is your homework
729.84s: before every trade you put on ask yourself these nine questions this is not an exhaustive list of
736.80s: pre-trade research you can do but the point being is to make it portable and light enough that people
742.72s: will be compliant in following something like this the problem is sometimes the good idea
747.68s: fairy strikes us and then we have a list of 62 things that whenever you go to put the trade on
753.04s: next time you're like oh shit this is gonna take me three hours before I replace a trade that's
757.36s: not gonna work I wish I didn't hear that but I just heard that so you got to find a balance between
764.24s: getting you to a point where you're finding the important details but it's portable and simple
768.40s: enough that you can execute it and you will consistently execute it this is a non-negotiable
774.32s: step of trading if you want to be an outlier see you guys later
