1.26s: in progress what's up everybody Eric
3.54s: here I'm back yet again with you on
5.82s: Sinclair and we're going to talk a
7.92s: little bit about the markets we're going
9.60s: to talk about a course that he's
10.92s: launching up coming pretty soon here but
13.26s: before we start diving into all of that
15.78s: you and welcome back yet again I
18.54s: convinced you slash tricked you to come
20.82s: on again I suppose but uh it's awesome
22.44s: to have you on thank you for joining us
23.76s: yeah thanks it's great for me it's
25.92s: probably not as good for you you really
27.36s: should have more friends I guess
29.64s: yeah well the problem is as soon as I
31.62s: start talking to people about options
33.06s: their eyes promptly roll to the back of
34.98s: their head and then they fall asleep so
37.02s: it is a small cohort of people who find
39.42s: any interest in these products
42.00s: um so yeah I'm fortunate that you are
44.16s: one of those people but with all that
47.88s: um before we get into the stuff on the
50.04s: course I do want to talk just a little
51.78s: bit about the broader markets as per
53.82s: usual because I think there's a lot of
54.84s: really interesting things going on and I
57.30s: know that you have a different view on a
59.40s: lot of those things so one of the things
60.96s: I want to talk about specifically is uh
63.78s: SBB obviously just a really interesting
66.48s: case and at least for me this is the
69.54s: second time I've seen this kind of
71.04s: scenario the first time was back in 2008
73.92s: and that was like my second year trading
75.66s: so I had a very different eye on it I
78.54s: wasn't trading around those events in
80.22s: 2008 too much whereas what's been going
82.86s: on svb at least as far as I've been able
85.44s: to decipher I I've been trading a lot
87.30s: around it so I'm curious from a just
90.78s: structural standpoint what do you think
92.82s: of the bank failure what what jumps to
94.44s: your mind
95.46s: I think it's
97.56s: okay first of all I don't think any of
99.96s: us should be thinking about this
101.34s: because we don't know enough about it to
104.04s: make informed decisions that are better
105.66s: than the market we just don't because if
108.24s: you think about it it's going to be like
109.68s: well sooner or later we'll find
113.10s: we'll find so we're already if you're
114.60s: honest with yourself you don't know
116.04s: really what happened why you're waiting
117.90s: for someone Michael Lewis or whoever to
120.00s: write the book you know and it's really
122.82s: dangerous to look at stuff from the
124.44s: outside I mean seriously what do we know
126.84s: we've read the newspaper I haven't even
128.94s: done that right but also I think it
132.66s: it's dangerous to take major singular
136.74s: events and say this is like 2008.
142.14s: I mean it has some commonality with 2008
145.56s: but it's not the same thing
148.68s: um this is a regional retail bank as
152.58s: opposed to
154.14s: an International Investment Bank it's a
156.84s: different Beast
158.58s: um
159.30s: also Dodd-Frank is in place now I know
162.84s: they weakened it because this clown in
164.88s: charge of SBB was part of the lobbying
166.98s: group who tried to get it weakened good
169.08s: job there
170.64s: um but regulations are there for a
172.44s: reason and after 2008
176.34s: back when there was some sort of
178.14s: bipartisan consensus where we could get
180.18s: something done
181.32s: people actually looked into what the
183.48s: problems were and addressed some of them
185.04s: so I don't think we're going to see the
187.14s: same contagion and I'm only saying that
189.06s: not because I know anything sure just
191.64s: because of the regulations in place
194.88s: it doesn't seem like that is going to be
197.70s: the same sort of situation and we're
199.62s: also this isn't driven by
202.38s: sort of a collapse of a retail Market
205.20s: and exacerbated by a whole bunch of you
208.68s: know
209.70s: credit derivative swap derivatives right
212.88s: it's really a very old-fashioned issue
215.52s: as far as I can tell it's a run on a
217.80s: bank right
219.42s: um
220.62s: so yeah that's sort of what I think I
222.66s: think it's always dangerous when you
224.10s: attach too much
227.70s: significance to how this is similar to a
230.16s: previous event sure one of the real
232.50s: problems with being long Vol being all
235.26s: involved everything's different all the
237.48s: time because you're never going to fight
240.42s: the same War twice
242.28s: so are there commonalities sure but
246.72s: I think we have to
248.76s: be cautious about what we really know
251.30s: even from a statistics standpoint right
254.04s: even if this is exactly the same as 2008
257.94s: what's your sample size
259.98s: one right so good luck drawing
262.98s: inferences from there the markets are
265.20s: hard enough to draw inferences from when
266.88s: you've got hundreds of data points
269.16s: so
270.48s: having said that
272.04s: I did take money out of uh bank accounts
275.46s: if it was above the FDIC limit and stuck
278.82s: them into safer places like bookmaker.eu
281.94s: and bet online and DraftKings and I it's
286.22s: I mean I think for the short term they
288.78s: legitimately had less risk than a bank
293.22s: so that was the only thing I did as any
295.26s: result of this stuff
297.12s: oh that's interesting so you didn't
298.80s: trade any of the
300.72s: you didn't trade anything in well you
302.58s: can't really trade sivb but anything
304.08s: like XLF the financials anything like
306.06s: that
307.20s: not because of this
308.94s: got it I almost certainly did trade some
312.12s: of that stuff or certainly stuff the
313.62s: head Financial links but it was only
316.92s: based on
318.30s: what those stocks did
320.94s: I don't want to say technically but yeah
323.10s: you know how they moved around and what
324.60s: their volatility what the implied for
326.34s: was it wasn't based on like any
328.80s: particular view I had no but couldn't
332.34s: couldn't the argument be made that a lot
334.56s: of those things made those moves because
336.42s: of what happened oh sure yeah okay but I
339.60s: don't need to know the cause to know the
341.88s: things
343.56s: so
345.42s: yeah I don't know I could come up with
347.40s: some tortured analogy but I really just
349.98s: care what happened rather than why it
352.02s: happened
352.86s: got it
354.42s: and to be honest I'm almost always long
356.22s: the financials anyway
357.78s: they typically trade
359.82s: very cheap in terms of the whole premium
362.94s: I'm talking about the big financials
364.92s: like you know JP Morgan American Express
367.14s: that kind of stuff it's almost always a
369.78s: core
371.58s: at my lungs
373.62s: this leads me this leads me to a
376.20s: follow-on question because I've noticed
377.46s: this kind of
379.02s: um course in our previous dialogues part
381.30s: of
382.50s: part of the way that I think about the
384.30s: markets I have it like split into two
386.40s: pieces there's like the tradable stuff
388.32s: and then there's stuff that I just find
390.18s: interesting and it sounds like you
393.18s: really wait the tradable Practical side
395.94s: of things is there like a general
397.86s: interest that you have in like what
400.98s: happens in the market or what happens in
402.48s: the economy and if so like what does
403.98s: that look like for you
405.60s: I don't care about it yeah I figured but
408.12s: I mean it's not that I don't care about
410.10s: it so much as I find it ridiculously
412.26s: uninteresting
413.76s: like I've literally never read The Wall
415.92s: Street Journal or the financial times
418.56s: I couldn't care less I mean I'm much
420.72s: more interested in uh
424.08s: well the sort of stance-based stuff the
426.78s: gambling based stuff yeah you know I I
429.36s: come that up from that point of view I
431.10s: mean
431.88s: to me this is no different from putting
434.04s: bets on women's cricket
435.84s: you know it's although actually it is a
438.36s: little bit different because I quite
439.32s: like watching women's Cricket as opposed
441.72s: to
442.92s: business I hate it when people find out
445.38s: that I'm a Trader and then they start
447.78s: talking to me about like business stuff
451.80s: I'm like seriously I would much rather
453.60s: talk about how the Bears are going to
455.16s: screw up the draft or the Cubs or
458.18s: anything like you know we'll talk about
460.92s: Greek history anything
463.64s: it's about the most boring thing on
465.66s: earth
466.50s: yeah I agree with that especially if
468.48s: you're talking about like analyzing
470.04s: financials or like looking at a CEO
472.62s: statements I think the part that I find
474.90s: interesting is when you have like
476.46s: incredibly complex systems and the
478.80s: relationships between things I just find
480.66s: that interesting it's the same reason
481.80s: why I personally like I'm fascinated by
484.74s: space and it's because of this giant
487.98s: complex system in the relationship
489.36s: between things but I actually really
491.70s: respect the way that you view the
493.14s: markets also because I do think for a
495.06s: lot of people they start diving into you
497.70s: know causation causality and then
499.62s: they're trying to essentially make
501.06s: really simple summations of extremely
504.42s: complex systems and turning that into a
506.70s: tradable event which I think that that
508.32s: kind of sets people up for failure more
509.76s: often than not but
511.92s: um also they've got to be better at that
513.72s: than the market right I mean and there's
516.60s: plenty of evidence like
518.70s: being a domain specific expert
522.72s: isn't usually enough to make money in
525.00s: the market I see the point where I know
527.16s: people who are on the board of Biotech
530.10s: companies and they can't make money
532.74s: trading biotech companies right but you
536.16s: don't know more than these people and
538.68s: what they know is baked into the market
540.96s: it's not
543.12s: I don't know it's like people are going
545.04s: about
547.92s: people this is one of the things we is
550.44s: very much in my philosophy
552.36s: is you've got to pick an angle that's
555.36s: beatable you know you don't do the
558.00s: hardest thing just for the sake of it
560.94s: um and that's it's even with sports
562.50s: betting right I know a couple of
564.30s: professional sports gamblers
566.70s: it's not about whether they think the
568.80s: Bears are a good team right it's none of
571.92s: that it's the total is this the Bears
575.22s: point spread is this so what should the
577.62s: point spread be in the first quarter
580.14s: that's that's the sort of thing they're
581.94s: doing it's not about
584.70s: it it's got nothing to do with football
586.50s: it's all about relative prices between
589.08s: all these other things and I think a lot
591.60s: of people tend to miss that they get
593.22s: into sports gambling because they like
594.66s: sports
595.80s: which is fine but that's not going to
597.90s: make you money
600.18s: that actually leads me to a follow-on
601.74s: question is you were you know explaining
604.20s: some of your interest in sports
605.46s: obviously you like sports what
608.04s: why do you trade the markets then as
610.32s: compared to sports is it scale is it
612.60s: accessibility like what yeah what leads
614.82s: you to that versus trading or gambling
617.46s: around things that you find more
618.54s: interesting
619.92s: um
620.70s: when I first started there was no Sports
623.94s: gambling in the countries I lived in
627.54s: um there wasn't in the US outside Vegas
629.88s: either unless you know there was no
631.86s: Market you'd say uh and I got a job in
635.28s: the financial markets basically that's
637.20s: how I started there right
639.96s: um I still do sports but
642.72s: not to the extent I have done in the
644.76s: past
646.32s: um it takes a lot of work
647.88s: but it's a huge amount of work and I
649.74s: think it's harder than Trading
651.42s: that was my follow-on question why is
653.16s: that
655.14s: trading there are a lot of
658.20s: pretty clear risk Premier that you can
660.78s: jump on right like stocks go up there
664.20s: you go you've got a tide you've got
665.76s: eight percent a year to play with
668.46s: um options are too expensive so there
670.80s: you go that gives you a head start
672.72s: and also the transaction costs and
674.82s: trading are minimal compared to gambling
677.76s: like
679.38s: um I was just doing some golf gambling
681.96s: a while ago and it's uh the markets are
685.02s: like you know 115 on each side
688.14s: that's a huge spring if that was a
690.54s: financial Market it'd be like 101 on
692.58s: each side you know the the spread in the
695.94s: spiders for example is by you know
698.10s: practically speaking zero
700.20s: you know and that's
702.00s: that's a big difference
704.58s: right yeah that makes sense it's and
706.92s: part of the reason why I ask is I mean I
709.14s: don't bet on Sports at all um I I don't
711.18s: really watch sports I like to play them
712.98s: but I do find it really interesting
714.48s: because I I like martial arts and I see
716.82s: I don't know if you bet on any of that
718.50s: stuff but I mean they're coming up with
721.08s: insane bets like whether or not these
723.12s: dudes will touch gloves whether or not
724.62s: they'll sit down in between like it's
727.02s: that I find just so cool that they find
730.26s: all of these different things to bet on
733.86s: um but
735.36s: does that lead to more or less
738.06s: opportunity in sports betting because
740.28s: then to me it also means that there
742.02s: would be decreased liquidity because
743.28s: there's so many different things people
744.54s: can bet on that it's difficult to like
747.48s: make a better Market or again I don't
750.00s: know how any of it works but I find it
751.44s: interesting
752.94s: um
754.92s: a lot of those kind of bits are just
756.84s: complete soccer bits yeah like literally
759.78s: you can bet on the coin toss at the
761.58s: Super Bowl
763.56s: um which is like absolutely insane
766.74s: particularly because you know it's a 50
768.48s: 50 bit but they all start paying you are
771.54s: terrible if you just want a 50 50 bid
773.46s: you know go and play roulette you know
776.28s: the odds there are a lot better
778.68s: um
779.28s: so
782.46s: I can't remember the question there most
784.62s: of that stuff's just complete garbage
786.12s: and any a pro is not going to touch that
788.34s: prop bets on like will this player run
792.12s: for more than this many yards
794.34s: that's a lot of Pros bread and butter
796.68s: because those lines can be really soft
799.20s: because the bookies put up hundreds of
801.84s: them
802.68s: and
804.12s: it's like being a market maker in a way
806.16s: it's like as a customer if you're a
807.84s: smart customer you look at the market
809.04s: Maker's lines and you're like good price
810.60s: good price good price good price good
812.10s: price oh you that one up done and
814.86s: that's exactly the same as sports
816.48s: betting The Bookies as well they just
818.76s: they can't get everything right but the
821.94s: problem is as a gambling you've got to
824.16s: go through 300 lines
826.92s: probably you've got 20 minutes to do it
829.44s: before the market changes and it gets
832.98s: knocked into line so that's not the sort
836.16s: of thing you can just do by
837.96s: you know typing some numbers into a
840.06s: spreadsheet for every single thing it's
841.98s: a it's a lot of data processing a lot of
844.50s: work
845.34s: right that makes sense
847.92s: um so then to bring us back now towards
850.38s: the financial markets
853.38s: um we talked a little bit about svb I
858.12s: I'm wondering from again not not to
861.36s: suggest causality or anything like that
863.76s: but from your experience when there are
867.72s: these kind of events do we have any data
870.78s: sets around the performance of
873.42s: volatility post the event as in it tends
876.96s: to remain in this kind of range for this
879.12s: number of days that's part of the the
880.92s: thing I was looking to discuss a little
882.84s: bit earlier is I have a lack of
885.96s: reference points so I'm really curious
888.72s: if you create any of your own based on
891.06s: your experience of the studies that
892.32s: you've done on again understanding that
893.94s: the events are different but sometimes
895.74s: they can have a similar Catalyst
898.20s: um yeah that would be an interesting
899.82s: study again I don't think you're going
901.92s: to find enough data points to come up
904.86s: with something that's
907.58s: an interesting thing to look at
910.20s: um
911.04s: I
913.98s: yeah I haven't done it but I think
916.20s: that's that is a legitimate actual study
918.48s: as opposed to sort of saying you know
920.34s: guessing about stuff so yeah you look
922.74s: and see you know during 2008 look at all
926.76s: the financials that survived what was
929.28s: the relaxation time for their balls that
931.80s: kind of thing that would be interesting
933.06s: to look at haven't done it but okay yeah
936.18s: because I I started I actually started
937.92s: just trying to compile some of it myself
939.42s: but I I don't have good enough data to
942.00s: like get a fair output that's always
943.50s: curious if you looked at it because I
944.70s: know your stuff's uh obviously way more
946.50s: advanced than mine I'm not sure but it
949.32s: might just be the same as any other shop
951.90s: you know because like a garage model is
953.94s: basically a vole model that has
955.56s: relaxation built into it
957.48s: and for a given stop
960.48s: the relaxation times are relatively
963.72s: constant no matter what the stock what
965.94s: the shot was driven by
968.04s: um
969.18s: I don't know that
970.74s: but in this case but I do know that
973.02s: there's a general phenomenon that's why
974.64s: garch models work so well is because
976.80s: they are relatively stable like that
980.94s: interesting I had not thought about that
985.32s: it's interesting
987.72s: um so another thing I wanted to talk to
990.06s: you about
991.20s: again this is I know slightly outside of
994.32s: your your preferred topics but I am
996.06s: curious about your input nonetheless
998.58s: I do find following the the fed's
1002.72s: thought process interesting again this
1005.00s: isn't uh forecast what the fed's going
1007.16s: to do this isn't a forecast what the
1008.78s: Market's going to do in reaction to the
1010.16s: FED it's literally just the function of
1012.74s: the FED I find curious and I've I've
1016.34s: been really surprised with the way that
1019.64s: they've kind of jumped around based on
1022.34s: these data points you know that we got
1024.08s: from the bank failure then from some of
1027.02s: the numbers that came out today does
1029.54s: this again if you follow this stuff for
1032.12s: any duration of time is this like what
1034.40s: you would expect from the FED decision
1036.02s: cycle again just as like a acting
1038.24s: institution I'm curious
1040.46s: um because I mean first we were
1042.20s: essentially pricing in no chance you
1045.26s: know of uh 25 or no chance of
1048.20s: essentially stay and then That's
1050.78s: essential completely reverted over the
1052.94s: course of a day so I'm curious yeah if
1055.64s: you've had experience with those kind of
1056.96s: moves before and just yeah a little
1059.18s: detail around that
1061.52s: no
1062.96s: I mean I can't tell you how many fed
1064.88s: governments there are
1066.34s: I find the beard very interesting though
1069.32s: because people get very angry about it
1071.18s: and it becomes one of those things where
1073.52s: people
1074.80s: want the world to be a certain way
1078.68s: yes
1079.90s: I can't remember who it was who said to
1082.40s: one of the others you want it to be that
1084.86s: way but it's not that way
1087.02s: so people
1089.78s: I don't know if it's political because I
1092.78s: don't think it is because this went
1093.86s: before we got so hyperpartisan
1097.76s: people got really mad about the bed
1100.52s: and
1102.80s: I don't I don't pretend to know what
1105.50s: they do but you've got you've got a few
1108.02s: different options
1109.46s: the FED has hundreds and hundreds of
1112.28s: phds all they do is study this stuff
1116.96s: so
1118.52s: there's no way you can tell me that that
1120.80s: dumb and economics now it's not
1124.70s: it's not economics 101 they understand
1127.52s: all the limitations in the models and
1129.80s: people are working on all of that stuff
1131.66s: so I think your options are the economy
1135.14s: is a really different difficult thing
1137.96s: and it's possible to figure out a really
1141.26s: small amount of signal from that noise
1144.62s: and if you can then those hundreds of
1147.68s: full-time employees
1149.60s: might come up with that signal
1152.60s: or you can say it doesn't matter what
1154.82s: you do the economy is completely random
1156.62s: system in which case nothing really
1159.68s: matters and all we're wasting is what
1161.84s: they're getting paid
1164.36s: um or the final one is
1166.60s: you Joe Trader think you understand this
1170.90s: better than they do
1172.58s: like one of those Alternatives is far
1175.28s: less likely than the other two
1177.38s: you know that's the thing I find odd
1179.60s: it's like the FED is stupid the FED is
1182.00s: corrupt Powell's an idiots no Powell's
1184.46s: not an idiot you might disagree with
1186.32s: what he said but
1188.42s: no and he's got so much more data than
1191.48s: you and it's
1193.64s: yeah it I like watching fed days
1197.18s: but I like watching it on Twitter
1198.74s: because people just get so angry about
1201.26s: it and it's
1203.30s: I don't know
1204.56s: got to get your amusement where you can
1206.18s: right
1207.32s: it is entertaining and that's it's
1209.06s: actually interesting to hear you say
1210.38s: that because I whenever I talk about the
1212.30s: FED I literally always come to that same
1215.24s: conclusion that sometimes I I don't
1216.80s: understand what they're doing but I also
1219.20s: always acknowledge that I they have more
1221.90s: information and they're smarter than I
1223.22s: am so sometimes connecting the gap
1226.40s: between those is what I find interesting
1228.14s: to try to understand like their movement
1230.06s: patterns a little better and they are
1232.40s: trying as well I think you've gotta
1234.14s: you've got to come at this with some
1236.00s: sort of
1237.86s: um
1238.60s: generosity of spirit right Grace yeah
1240.98s: you've got a bit like look Howell knows
1243.68s: what his legacy is going to be he's not
1246.08s: trying to blow up the economy because
1248.00s: he's long a 50 a lot of SPX puts you
1251.18s: know
1252.28s: that's not what he's trying to do it's
1255.50s: like he's not a politician he's a
1259.22s: professional Economist and a civil
1261.02s: servant and he will be remembered for
1263.84s: how the economy does you know not
1266.12s: whether he's got a new beach house
1268.22s: so I think you've got to remember that
1271.10s: these people are trying
1273.04s: right yeah yeah and I and I think it's
1276.68s: an important point because and I think
1278.36s: it just goes back to everybody's thirst
1280.28s: for a super simple narrative that
1282.86s: dismisses all Nuance
1284.66s: um which is yeah I agree with you it is
1286.40s: always entertaining I also think it's
1287.72s: always funny when the the conjecture
1290.06s: before those events is so high and it's
1292.46s: to your point I always think it
1293.96s: whatever's gonna happen is going to
1295.58s: happen the the part that I really take
1297.50s: interest in is yeah like the functioning
1299.54s: of the body and why it does what it does
1301.82s: just because
1302.90s: anytime I think about markets or the
1304.52s: economy it it again like I I make the
1308.06s: parallel to space because it's just so
1310.88s: massive and so many things are
1312.62s: correlated in ways that you might not
1314.78s: know that's one of the things that got
1315.98s: me interested in markets personally that
1317.96s: it's a cool way to like learn about our
1319.94s: world around us
1321.98s: um but so speaking of learning you guys
1326.36s: have your course coming up so talk to me
1329.06s: just about the origin of the course to
1331.16s: get us started and kind of give us an
1333.14s: overview and then I want to get into
1334.58s: some details about it so that people can
1336.86s: kind of learn you know a little bit more
1338.06s: about what to expect I know a lot of my
1339.92s: audience like I was telling you before
1341.60s: we started they're super stoked about it
1343.16s: they're very curious and they want to
1344.72s: learn more so yeah what's uh what's like
1346.46s: a high level overview to kick us off
1347.90s: okay so
1350.18s: this came about because people were
1352.70s: asking me
1353.90s: can you teach me this can you teach me
1356.42s: that like can you be a full-time mentor
1358.70s: and the answer to that is always no
1360.14s: because I'm busy at doing other stuff
1362.54s: but eventually I decided look I'll put
1364.46s: this together this is literally based on
1368.42s: stuff I used to teach at real trading
1371.84s: firms right so a couple of the biggest
1374.00s: option market makers now we're not doing
1376.40s: the same we're not talking about Dynamic
1379.16s: hedging and that kind of stuff because
1381.74s: retail people can't do it like you you
1384.74s: don't have the cost structure you don't
1386.60s: have the technology structure and that's
1388.94s: an example of if you try to play that
1390.86s: game
1391.76s: you're going to lose to Susquehanna and
1394.16s: James Street that you don't want to go
1396.74s: up against those guys in that game so
1400.76s: I'm gonna try or we me and James are
1404.30s: going to try and teach
1407.06s: things that actually work statistically
1410.12s: valid based on phenomena we are very
1413.48s: confident in
1415.00s: and use that as the basis of trading
1418.46s: strategies now the problem with options
1420.44s: is there's an awful lot of details
1422.00s: you've got to learn first before you can
1423.74s: learn why a trading strategy works or
1425.84s: why it doesn't
1426.92s: and I think
1430.34s: I think there are two main ways people
1432.14s: screw up trading right there's the
1434.96s: fighting gang side of it who think that
1437.78s: there's Edge lying around everywhere and
1440.66s: it's just free money and all you've got
1442.22s: to do is go and pick it up by selling an
1443.66s: iron Condor every week
1447.20s: and
1448.88s: the um
1450.02s: the Quant
1452.00s: thing at the other end where people are
1454.40s: looking for this all-encompassing model
1456.38s: of the market or this perfect option
1460.04s: pricing thing or whatever and that's
1463.04s: sort of lacking in Street smarts because
1465.38s: you've got to remember
1466.90s: it really just comes down to all of
1469.40s: these things are just going up and down
1470.78s: because other people are treating them
1472.58s: right it's all driven by supply and
1474.56s: demand so you're looking for
1475.76s: dislocations from fair value
1478.10s: and you don't even you've got to have a
1481.04s: rough idea of what fair value is but
1483.50s: only a rough one because if you know it
1485.72s: started here and then there's a massive
1487.76s: Spike to up here
1489.74s: there's a reasonably good chance that
1492.14s: someone's overreacted and it's driven up
1494.96s: there by a liquidity issue that's what
1497.30s: Market making is Market making is all
1499.52s: these little micro squeezers
1502.04s: and I think this is one of the traps
1504.56s: people fall into they'll see a big move
1506.18s: and they're like oh someone knows what
1507.80s: they're doing
1508.88s: well what they were really doing is they
1510.98s: put a huge order into the market and it
1512.72s: moved the price
1514.10s: you know that's the the important thing
1516.62s: what they were doing it's not so much
1518.42s: they bought all these Vex calls because
1520.94s: they think this this this and this it's
1523.64s: like the important thing they did is
1525.38s: they bought all these fixed calls which
1526.94s: bumped all the prices up
1529.22s: um so it's based on kind of
1531.32s: simple sort of observations like that
1534.86s: um
1535.52s: so I think it's professional level
1538.22s: but it's not teaching you exactly the
1540.86s: same things that a professional option
1542.78s: Trader would generally do
1545.06s: and well I don't mean professional like
1546.92s: you who make your money from doing this
1549.68s: I mean professional like Susquehanna or
1552.32s: Citadel or Jane Street
1555.08s: got it so when you think about your
1557.84s: you're like your target audience your
1559.46s: Target demographic who who are we
1561.86s: targeting
1564.44s: you know that would if I was a good
1566.42s: businessman I would have kind of made
1567.92s: that decision early and tailored things
1570.26s: specifically to those people I think
1572.72s: it's more of a matter of me telling
1574.34s: people what I think they need to succeed
1576.02s: in the markets
1577.70s: um I think that applies to anyone
1580.10s: um
1580.88s: this is not in any way a cheap course
1584.48s: and I acknowledge it is not cheap I do
1588.14s: think however it's got enormous value
1590.12s: and if you compare it to the things
1593.48s: of comparable level
1597.02s: there are a few MFE classes that you
1600.14s: could do
1601.82s: um a lot of MFE classes their option
1603.98s: stuff is just mathematics and it's just
1606.56s: pointless there are a few good ones they
1609.38s: will typically charge you between six
1611.30s: and ten thousand dollars per unit
1613.94s: so compared to that I think it's pretty
1616.46s: good value
1618.38s: um
1620.54s: and I can't remember where the rest of
1622.40s: my thought train was going with that
1625.34s: um no it's really cool because I have a
1626.78s: follow-on anyways to the to the Target
1630.08s: um so at a high level overview
1633.50s: what are we expecting them to learn over
1636.02s: the course it sounds like there's going
1637.82s: to be a little bit of and I look through
1639.62s: the coursework I'm and thank you for
1641.18s: sending it ahead of time so I had a
1642.50s: chance to get some familiarity and
1644.48s: there's like good intro to option stuff
1646.58s: in there to help build that Baseline
1648.08s: things about the Greek so on and so
1649.52s: forth so kind of like building a
1651.20s: foundation then you guys start getting
1652.82s: into some other things
1654.68s: um but you know I'd be curious to hear
1657.20s: your summation of you know before you
1659.42s: take this course you're starting at X
1660.98s: point and it seems like that point can
1662.54s: be just about anything maybe a general
1664.34s: familiarity with markets and options and
1666.80s: then at the end you should know this
1670.04s: yeah in theory you could start without
1672.44s: knowing what a call or report was in
1675.44s: reality if you tried that you'd get very
1677.42s: lost very quickly because this
1679.94s: yes
1681.14s: I think you can see this with my books
1683.00s: as well I I don't try and a lot of times
1685.34s: with books people say the same thing
1686.96s: four times I don't it's very dense I say
1690.26s: it once you might have to read it four
1692.36s: times right but
1694.46s: my stuff tends to be very dense so there
1697.52s: are I think 300 slides in this
1700.70s: and there's a lot of information in
1702.92s: there so we have to start with the
1705.14s: mechanics of options
1706.94s: because we can't really talk about a lot
1708.92s: of the where the edges are coming from
1711.32s: unless you understand that so that's
1713.66s: where the the big problem with Theta is
1716.60s: is people think fate is an edge right it
1720.74s: absolutely isn't and if if I could get
1722.60s: people to understand one thing about
1724.16s: options that would be it
1726.08s: but then in order to find out where
1728.00s: there are edges you have to know about
1729.44s: implied volatility you have to know
1731.12s: about realized volatility you have to
1733.16s: know how they're connected
1735.20s: you have to know the characteristics of
1738.80s: them so I often say it's kind of like
1741.26s: being a hunter
1743.48s: um simply don't have to get up early in
1745.04s: the morning actually you do right being
1747.26s: an option Trader is very much like being
1748.76s: a hunter but the thing you have to
1750.62s: understand is you have to understand the
1752.48s: characteristics of what you're Trading
1754.70s: it's not the math that's important
1757.16s: you know a a hunter isn't a biologist
1760.46s: but they have to know the
1761.72s: characteristics of this is where ducks
1764.00s: are if this kind of food is around
1766.40s: you're more likely to find a duck if
1768.62s: this kind of water is around you're not
1770.78s: going to find Ducks because they're not
1772.04s: going to be in a rapid situation or a
1774.14s: waterfall or something and it's like
1776.06s: that with volatility you kind of have to
1777.92s: know how it all behaves
1779.96s: and then once you've got that
1782.90s: Foundation
1784.58s: then we can look at specific trades like
1788.18s: um
1789.38s: time-based trades like selling options
1791.42s: overnight selling them over the weekend
1793.18s: trading Equity earnings
1796.34s: um some longer dated stuff like covered
1798.56s: calls risk reversals
1801.32s: um zero DTE stuff we go into and a lot
1804.74s: of this stuff I've talked about in my
1808.16s: I don't know half an hour hour seminars
1811.40s: but the big difference here is I'm just
1814.70s: presenting results there here I'm taking
1817.52s: you through this is the phenomenon
1820.04s: this is the actual way you have to make
1822.80s: the decisions to trade that
1824.96s: so I tell you vol's overpriced now what
1827.24s: do you do which options do you sell when
1830.30s: do you rebalance them
1832.28s: um what do you do if this happens what
1833.84s: do you do if that happens what do you
1835.10s: stop from blowing up all these kind of
1837.32s: it takes it from a theoretical
1840.44s: high-level thing to this is exactly what
1843.26s: you do to have to do this trade
1846.26s: um so I think that's the big difference
1849.86s: um
1850.58s: because James is completely a traitor
1854.12s: I'm I don't know what you'd call me I
1857.12s: certainly trade
1859.10s: um
1859.70s: and I think that experience is the big
1862.28s: difference so if you go to an MFE course
1865.34s: you're going to be taught by a math
1867.14s: professor it's not the same thing
1872.00s: um and I do I do acknowledge this is
1873.80s: expensive
1875.42s: um and you get this you get a strange
1877.04s: pushback from people
1878.90s: in the markets where you try to teach
1881.06s: someone something and they're like well
1883.58s: if you've if you've got all this money
1885.44s: why are you charging for the course
1887.84s: which I always find odd because no one
1890.90s: says to a doctor you've got all this
1893.36s: money why are you still charging to go
1895.22s: to work
1896.24s: I mean there was a huge amount of work
1897.86s: that went into this
1899.54s: which is why we're charging for it it's
1901.28s: like I wouldn't have done this if there
1903.02s: was nothing in it for me it's not that
1905.84s: interesting yeah
1908.00s: but I think it's great value
1910.22s: so
1911.60s: expensive yes but good value I think so
1914.66s: so let's talk about that real quick
1918.10s: your turn
1920.42s: um well it just while we're on the cost
1922.34s: I I figured that's definitely an
1923.96s: interesting point for a lot of people
1925.82s: obviously and it's because at least like
1928.82s: I was telling you before a lot of my
1929.96s: demographic
1931.52s: um something around three thousand
1932.96s: dollars is probably a sizable portion of
1935.78s: some of their Bank rolls and for for a
1938.30s: lot of the people that would be
1939.32s: interested in this kind of course
1941.84s: um definitely at least for my community
1943.64s: like I was telling you a lot of my
1945.50s: community is a big fan of you because I
1947.42s: follow a lot of your work and talk about
1949.04s: your work with them because I think
1950.36s: you're a great reference point for them
1952.34s: so one of the things that I think you
1954.98s: were highlighting before when we were
1956.72s: talking about the structure of the
1957.98s: course is some of the value and I think
1960.62s: it would be good for people to to kind
1962.42s: of get in a total idea of the cost
1964.34s: perspective so what is the the total
1967.10s: cost for the course
1969.20s: total cost is
1972.46s: 2995.
1974.02s: obviously there were marketing guys
1975.92s: involved and they didn't want us to say
1977.54s: four thousand
1979.34s: um and for that you get
1981.92s: it's meant to be 12 one and a half hour
1985.04s: lessons but it's going to be more than
1986.78s: that
1988.04s: um this thing's just grown I think it's
1990.08s: probably more like 14 to 16. but we're
1993.86s: not going to rush through it just for
1995.18s: the sake of rushing through it then the
1998.30s: one of the things I think is a really
2000.10s: good selling point is we're going to
2001.48s: have a slack Channel
2002.86s: and it's going to be
2005.70s: a closed slack channel for people who've
2008.62s: been from this group and it's going to
2010.90s: be where you can ask me questions you
2013.24s: can DM me uh and hopefully we'll get a
2016.24s: community of people who are
2018.72s: evidence-based options Traders
2021.46s: and
2023.80s: I don't really know of such a place yet
2025.96s: around I mean it's certainly like we
2029.32s: were talking about before
2031.24s: if you want to talk about your opinions
2033.34s: on the fed and how you think XYZ
2036.10s: politicians are screwing up the world
2037.84s: that's great that's that's for you but
2040.72s: we're not doing it here this is going to
2042.82s: be like a real we're only here to make
2045.46s: money trading options based on actual
2047.44s: things like numbers not crazy opinions
2052.90s: um well you know they might not be crazy
2054.22s: but you know so it's going to be very
2056.92s: clean uh it's going to be basically the
2059.44s: only place you're going to be able to
2060.52s: contact James and I going forward I
2062.56s: think
2063.58s: um I mean we'll still talk to people but
2067.24s: yeah that makes sense so we have the The
2070.30s: Upfront cost we have kind of the the
2072.10s: main things that are included with it a
2073.66s: couple other questions specifically on
2075.22s: the prelim cost and then I want to get
2076.66s: into some other aspects of it so the
2078.10s: first thing is
2079.66s: um do you guys have like a course
2081.04s: syllabus or something that you're going
2082.78s: to publish so people can look through
2084.34s: that before they choose to buy the
2086.26s: course so they can have an idea of
2087.58s: what's in there
2088.98s: uh a little bit
2091.00s: um
2092.56s: I can send you our sort of sales cheat
2095.44s: sheet
2096.94s: um which has like literally a bullet
2099.58s: point course list sure what people can
2102.28s: also do though is they can sign up see
2105.16s: the first class and if they don't like
2107.08s: it they can just
2108.46s: cancel at that point
2110.20s: so
2111.54s: that would it's not so much what we
2113.68s: teach you it's more like the style of
2115.36s: how we teach it if if you think that's
2118.12s: going to work for you that's fine if not
2119.74s: that's that's cool you know you can
2121.96s: watch the first one and then just quit
2123.76s: that's that's probably the easiest way
2126.10s: to sort of get an idea of what's going
2127.78s: on
2129.04s: yeah I think that makes sense the first
2131.20s: one's going to be a Vex trade
2133.00s: so it's not going to be options at all
2135.58s: but it's a good sort of
2137.92s: sort of uh example for a lot of other
2140.26s: things we're going to get to
2142.66s: right and so that leads then to
2145.96s: um a follow-on question so
2148.48s: one of the things that I notice in a lot
2151.72s: of your books
2153.46s: um is there's obviously a good deal of
2156.22s: theory that then attempts to bridge the
2159.70s: gap to practical application in the
2162.64s: course can people expect to see like
2165.34s: practical application of these different
2168.34s: theories that you guys are going to be
2169.60s: talking about I.E not just like back
2172.42s: tests and these are the results of that
2174.10s: but like as in like this is a trade that
2176.20s: I did at X point and this is how it went
2177.94s: like that that kind of stuff
2179.56s: some of them
2181.24s: um some of them one of the problems with
2183.70s: options is that they the trades play out
2186.94s: over much longer periods than that
2190.00s: typically would be useful but yeah some
2192.64s: we certainly have some real examples in
2195.22s: there
2196.36s: um and we do talk people through
2199.00s: these are the actual decisions you will
2201.04s: need to make if you do this trade so a
2203.44s: lot of the actual strategies I mentioned
2205.30s: in my last book you know like the
2207.16s: weekend effect I think it's a paragraph
2209.56s: whereas the weekend effect in this I
2211.36s: think it's probably going to be about an
2212.38s: hour and a half so
2214.78s: that's sort of one of the big
2216.52s: differences but we definitely do that
2218.50s: we've got about
2220.06s: I don't know eight different strategies
2222.28s: in there and
2224.98s: I can't promise that I do all of them
2228.10s: at any given time because I have
2231.22s: at some times I'm not allowed to trade
2233.50s: certain kinds of options or I have a
2235.54s: mandate to do something else or my boss
2237.10s: tells me to do something else but these
2239.14s: are all things that I have traded or
2241.18s: would trade if I could and I don't know
2244.18s: about six of them the effect is
2247.72s: part is one of the inputs into my Vol
2249.88s: model anyway
2251.44s: so
2253.00s: I guess if we want to use Talib sprays
2256.42s: there is skin in the game we believe it
2258.82s: to the point that we do it ourselves
2260.62s: right cool yeah and I just wanted to
2263.44s: elucidate that point for people because
2264.76s: I do think that that's a strong
2266.76s: consideration for people that take
2268.78s: courses like this is to actually get the
2270.94s: you know this is the real stuff how
2273.10s: we're actually doing it
2274.90s: um because and I know you've talked
2276.82s: about this and I agree with that like
2277.96s: back testing and studying stuff like
2279.64s: that is good it gets you somewhere but
2281.74s: it's not the whole story so I think it's
2283.78s: cool that you guys are interested this
2285.40s: is very problematic actually right
2288.70s: it's technically difficult because
2290.50s: there's a lot of data and it's noisy
2292.48s: data and you've got to clean it up and
2295.48s: there's a lot of technical problems you
2297.10s: can run into
2298.48s: the bigger problem is though we don't
2300.70s: actually have that much data
2304.54s: um because we're not trading options
2306.04s: we're trading implied volatility and it
2308.44s: doesn't move as quickly as stocks do it
2311.38s: goes into regimes and stays there
2313.84s: so
2315.10s: it's really dangerous to you might think
2318.28s: if you test something over the last four
2320.14s: years you've got a thousand data points
2323.32s: in volatility terms you might only have
2325.66s: 10 right you know and it's really
2328.42s: difficult it's easy to fool yourself
2330.40s: into making an inference from that that
2332.32s: really isn't there
2333.76s: so we talked about that as well and the
2335.62s: dangers of back testing and
2337.78s: yeah I can't guarantee if you do this
2339.46s: you'll make money but I can guarantee if
2341.74s: you do this stuff and don't make money
2343.18s: I'm not making money either
2347.02s: right right that's actually a a cool
2350.14s: phrase
2351.76s: um is there open enrollment like if
2354.40s: somebody doesn't make the first course
2356.20s: can they still join for the second third
2358.48s: you know so on and so forth and also are
2361.12s: they recorded if somebody misses it
2363.76s: um differently recorded and obviously if
2367.54s: you watch the recordings and we've had
2370.24s: people from Europe ask about this and so
2372.28s: for Europe it's much more of a big deal
2373.84s: because people aren't going to get up at
2375.04s: two o'clock in the morning
2376.90s: um
2377.98s: it's all recorded and if you need to ask
2380.38s: questions which you can't do live you
2382.48s: can do it through dming me through the
2384.16s: slack
2385.00s: so that's true we haven't talked about
2387.52s: the idea of diving in and out of the
2389.74s: course
2391.18s: um
2392.20s: I'm not sure that would be workable
2396.22s: but like I said we do have this first
2398.86s: free
2400.24s: class thing sure yeah that makes total
2403.72s: sense
2404.80s: um and then another thing you mentioned
2406.12s: earlier was the duration of the course
2407.92s: but then before we started recording you
2409.48s: were talking about kind of the the your
2411.40s: thought process on the duration of like
2412.90s: the slack Channel and the interactions
2414.40s: can you talk about that real quick and
2416.08s: just clarify that because I think it's
2417.28s: an important point for people
2418.96s: yeah I intend the slack channel to last
2421.12s: forever
2422.80s: um unless you know slack goes away or
2426.88s: you know something genuinely unforeseen
2429.16s: happens I I still get emails
2432.16s: a couple of times a year asking if my
2434.68s: old slack channel is still around and I
2437.32s: don't
2438.58s: that company that that channel was based
2441.04s: on hasn't existed for about six years
2443.32s: so if you get a good Community going
2446.32s: like that it has a lot of value and it
2448.24s: really does add to things
2450.04s: right yeah and I think that that's
2452.26s: actually a big um sales point for people
2454.36s: in case they didn't know the the fact
2456.16s: that you know you get the course you get
2458.02s: the interactions but then there's also a
2459.82s: sustained interaction period post you
2462.10s: know when the when the sessions are over
2463.42s: which I think is useful yeah and I'm
2465.46s: going to keep that closed because you
2467.86s: know it's people have paid for the
2469.84s: course that's the access they're buying
2473.38s: if you like
2474.34s: yeah cool and then the the last question
2477.46s: I got from some of my folks is
2479.74s: um is there like a resource library or
2482.02s: what kind of is there any documentation
2483.58s: they can expect to get obviously you
2485.14s: guys have the slides
2486.58s: um and you guys will have the videos
2487.42s: recorded but are there like any handouts
2489.76s: anything like that that you're expecting
2491.20s: to to tie into the course
2493.60s: no we haven't performed that
2495.70s: um it's kind of it's a decent idea
2499.00s: um
2500.58s: let me think about that I mean certainly
2504.28s: for things like
2505.60s: extra reading we could certainly put
2508.30s: stuff together like that um I haven't
2510.28s: considered that in any other way we are
2512.56s: going to have
2514.60s: I don't want to call them homework
2516.04s: problems
2517.24s: but they're kind of the sort of thing
2518.86s: whereas if you want to do them that's
2520.30s: fine so it's like at the end of a
2522.52s: question on say put call parity
2525.70s: um we go through it and it's very easy
2527.74s: for someone to say this is complete
2529.30s: garbage I don't need to know this I'm
2530.80s: not a professional Trader and we're
2533.14s: going to show you why you do need to
2534.52s: know it and we're going to give you a
2536.20s: question in this little homework thing
2537.94s: for how you would then use it as an
2540.40s: actual Trader in real life and how it's
2542.26s: actually a useful thing and so if people
2544.42s: want to do that that's great obviously
2546.16s: we're not going to mark them we're not
2548.32s: going to I mean we'll give you the
2550.12s: answers but we're not going to sort of
2551.74s: there's no passing grade here
2554.38s: right yeah that makes sense and yeah
2557.14s: because another thing that we use um at
2559.18s: least in the like I I run a free Discord
2561.40s: for people
2562.96s: um and we have like a big resource list
2565.18s: and people love going through that so if
2567.16s: you guys have
2568.60s: um anything like that I'm sure people
2569.86s: would really enjoy that you know like a
2571.48s: reading list useful websites stuff like
2573.76s: that
2574.90s: um I should put in the in the slack I
2577.54s: should have a channel for uh you know a
2580.90s: library Channel yeah exactly
2583.24s: yeah I think people would love that cool
2585.16s: well that's awesome is there anything
2586.78s: else that you think people should uh
2588.64s: should know or you want to talk about
2589.78s: with regards to the course
2591.64s: foreign
2596.22s: I think
2598.54s: when I first started this I wasn't
2600.70s: particularly enthusiastic about the
2602.92s: whole thing because I thought there are
2605.86s: a million different courses out there
2608.08s: there are a million people who
2610.30s: claim to teach you about options
2612.82s: but it's kind of got to the point where
2616.42s: it's a bit like my books and
2619.60s: saying this sounds arrogant except if
2621.76s: you're going to write a book that's a
2622.96s: very arrogant thing to do to start with
2624.46s: right because you're putting yourself
2625.72s: out there as some sort of expert
2628.00s: so
2629.32s: I really think
2631.78s: this is the best course of its kind
2635.02s: and I think that's partly because it's
2636.88s: written by two traders who really
2639.58s: genuinely trade but also understand the
2641.68s: theory we understand the problems you'll
2643.84s: fall into but we've just put a lot of
2646.00s: work into it I think of
2649.30s: if there was something better I think we
2651.04s: would have tried to write that like I
2653.08s: think genuinely this is as good as can
2655.36s: be done for what we're trying to teach
2658.90s: and I've taught a lot of this stuff to
2661.00s: you know trading firms and things so I
2663.10s: kind of know
2664.60s: what's useful and what isn't
2668.32s: I think yeah I'm not quite I can do it
2670.96s: all the time but uh
2672.94s: I can write the slides on it
2676.18s: well I think one of the things in what I
2678.82s: what I consider with a service like this
2680.92s: anyways is people are getting to tap
2682.72s: into kind of your collective experience
2684.34s: in a very condensed focused manner which
2687.22s: that in in and of itself is like pretty
2689.38s: valuable in my opinion so
2691.60s: um I'm I'm really stoked to see the
2693.46s: course here how it's going and stuff
2694.60s: like that I think especially for the
2696.76s: Traders this kind of thing is really
2699.28s: valuable because and I've talked to you
2700.96s: about this and gave you this compliment
2702.34s: before but I'm happy to reiterate
2704.08s: because I think it's cool to give people
2705.58s: compliments that that deserve them and
2707.80s: with your books and whatnot you really
2710.62s: strike a good balance between Theory and
2713.20s: practical application and when I was
2714.58s: looking through the slides I saw that
2716.50s: same thing and I think that that's
2717.88s: really useful for people because they
2719.44s: get to get a distilled version of theory
2724.42s: from somebody who's already pre-filtered
2726.40s: this is the important Theory from this
2728.56s: is all of the theory and then this is
2730.42s: how to practically apply it so yeah
2734.04s: it's like on one hand you've got the
2736.72s: YouTube guy who's like free money free
2738.58s: money free money and he doesn't even
2739.90s: know what an option is and at the other
2741.82s: end you've got the professor who thinks
2744.28s: his option course
2746.26s: I mean it's it's just a stochastic
2748.36s: calculus course you know it's it's low
2750.88s: level grad maths and I think we're in
2753.10s: the middle we're like we're not telling
2754.30s: you this is easy
2755.50s: we're actually telling you it's hard
2757.54s: but we're also going to tell you how to
2759.10s: do it and there's no magic to it and you
2761.74s: can learn it and to do it you have to
2764.74s: learn all this other stuff so if you
2766.60s: prepare to put the work in
2768.28s: yeah I mean it works
2770.86s: okay it's like Alcoholics Anonymous
2772.78s: right it works if you work it
2777.28s: um
2781.08s: hey hey hey no no I'm just kidding
2784.12s: um the the last question I had for you
2786.04s: is specifically on the courses like is
2788.20s: there any like pre-work is there
2789.76s: anything that somebody that might be
2791.74s: less familiar with options should do
2794.20s: before they jump into your course
2796.42s: because when I was looking through the
2797.56s: slides at least in my opinion that would
2799.30s: probably help them to a pretty
2800.86s: significant degree
2802.48s: um but again I don't know if that's
2803.92s: anything that you guys have thought
2805.00s: through
2806.56s: yeah
2808.06s: um
2808.96s: at a minimum you should have read
2811.72s: nitinburg
2813.52s: um you need that level just the
2815.44s: nomenclature right if I say Delta you
2817.78s: shouldn't be like whoa what the hell is
2819.16s: that you might we're going to tell you
2820.84s: what it is but it's going to be coming
2822.28s: way too fast if you know nothing
2824.50s: so I'd say netenberg is the absolute
2826.72s: minimum
2828.40s: I would probably recommend you read my
2830.20s: option trading book
2832.30s: um
2833.26s: I think it's better than netenberg but
2835.36s: it's also
2836.50s: despite my best efforts more advanced
2839.86s: so
2841.00s: that would probably help as well but I
2842.92s: think if you'd gone through those two I
2845.14s: think you'll have no trouble following
2846.52s: it there's no math on it
2848.74s: um you can't be frightened of math
2851.38s: like you can't see it and like
2853.78s: freeze up
2855.28s: but you don't have to understand
