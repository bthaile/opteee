0.84s: the ratio put diagonal is my hands down
3.88s: favorite bearish options trading
6.00s: strategy so I'm going to walk you
7.72s: through how it makes money how to set
10.00s: them up how to scan for them how to
12.04s: manage I'm going to give you an example
13.40s: of a trade that I had earlier this year
15.40s: that shows the full life cycle and
17.16s: decision cycle along the entire path I'm
19.36s: going to show you trade that I have on
20.64s: right now so that you can see how I
21.96s: found it and then at the end of the
23.56s: video I'm going to go through a couple
24.88s: questions from our Discord members which
27.24s: you should join and as you could tell
29.60s: there's a lot of detail going to be in
31.12s: this video that's by Design so it's
32.36s: going to be long feel free to skip
33.64s: around as needed but I want you to have
35.80s: a good reference Benchmark for the ratio
38.64s: put diagonals because this is a staple
40.24s: of mine now if you're familiar with the
42.48s: channel ratio diagonals will be very
44.56s: familiar to you cuz I trade them quite
46.24s: literally all the time it gives me a bit
48.68s: of a more adjustable risk reward profile
51.40s: which we'll talk about so the ratio put
53.88s: diagonal in a nutshell it's a
56.20s: directionally leveraged trading strategy
58.88s: designed to benefit from the downward
61.16s: price direction of something whatever it
63.32s: is that you're trading and it has a few
66.04s: legs you'll see that there's two primary
68.72s: legs and then there's kind of this
70.56s: optional leg which we'll get into in a
72.12s: little bit but the primary leg to start
74.44s: with is an in the money put that's
76.72s: greater than 60 days to expiration so
79.04s: let's talk about those two components
80.80s: specifically why in the money why
83.24s: greater than 60 days to expiration great
86.24s: questions the first question of why in
90.56s: the money this allows me to do two
94.92s: things simultaneously the first thing is
98.00s: I limit my Theta Decay the further in
100.88s: the money you go the more expensive your
103.24s: option will be but the less time value
106.84s: and the more intrinsic value will be in
109.72s: that option so if you get the moves that
112.20s: you want you're paying more upfront but
114.80s: you're going to recoup the vast majority
116.40s: of that cost even if it doesn't move
118.20s: much because it's inic value that
120.60s: doesn't Decay the second most important
123.16s: thing is you get a better dollar for
125.88s: dooll move in the underlying what is
127.92s: that mean let's take a look the example
130.16s: that we're going to use for the previous
132.32s: trade is O and I originally started
136.24s: trading this to the downside a while ago
137.96s: when Real Estate was doing really poor
140.12s: the beginning of this year so what I had
143.32s: on will walk through all of that I'm
145.04s: just going to use it as an example now
147.16s: for some of the option selection
149.36s: criteria
151.04s: so if o goes down by $1 if I have
154.72s: something like these 91 Delta puts I get
158.12s: 91 cents for the dollar so that means
161.24s: that as o is moving I'm seeing as much
164.00s: of that same move as I can with the
166.36s: options what's the downside they're more
169.04s: expensive the other downside is your
171.80s: options aren't going to get those
173.36s: massive th% compounding returns without
176.80s: a huge move so you have to figure out
179.04s: what's right for you and this this is
180.16s: why we also add those kicker options
183.44s: sometimes and the way to think about
185.64s: those kicker options at least for me is
188.84s: if I have some sort of stronger
190.24s: conviction and I really want to try to
191.96s: amplify the potential move if I'm
193.76s: correct I will buy cheaper out of the
196.72s: money options either the same expiration
199.12s: or closer in time depending on what the
200.96s: chains look like and what those do is
204.72s: they don't give me a a big profit if we
207.64s: get a smaller move so if o moves two
210.40s: three bucks let's say we grab these 50s
213.56s: Delta puts as the kickers it doesn't
215.32s: really matter it's not going to benefit
216.60s: us that much but if o for whatever
218.96s: reason craters in falls out of bed these
221.80s: will compound very quickly gain a lot of
224.44s: gamma very quickly and then these can
226.36s: actually add a lot of profit potential
228.96s: so this is kind of like a lower
230.48s: probability play that can amplify the
233.20s: overall return profile so we now know
237.44s: why I select the Deltas that I do
240.76s: my general approach here is in the money
243.60s: so that means greater than 50 Delta the
245.88s: vast majority of the time it will be
247.44s: greater than a 60 Delta sometimes I will
249.88s: go as far as a one Delta my typical
252.16s: Target is around a 80 Delta now this is
255.92s: completely predicated on the options
257.76s: chain so for example if this was the
260.48s: trade I was looking at 94 DTE which will
262.64s: talk about why that DTE is compared to
265.56s: something else in a second but if we
267.68s: take a look the 59s or the 91s which
271.96s: would I pick I actually would pick the
274.04s: 59s why because of liquidity this is
277.36s: something that a lot of Traders
278.80s: especially smaller Traders don't think
280.40s: much about because fortunately if you're
281.60s: trading a one lot a two lot it doesn't
283.36s: really matter but if you're trading a 50
285.32s: lot a 100 lot this is actually super
287.88s: limiting so you'll find that these odd
291.04s: strikes like the 57 A2 the 62 and A2
294.36s: they will have much lighter liquidity
296.28s: than the standard strikes like 60 55 so
299.44s: on and so forth so part of it is finding
302.96s: the right mix balancing all these
306.08s: different things which does absolutely
308.52s: include liquidity the reason why
310.40s: liquidity is so important is because as
312.24s: you go further out in time liquidity
314.00s: will lighten as you go deeper in the
315.48s: money liquidity will lighten so you
317.96s: can't be too hands off with your
323.32s: attention to
324.64s: liquidity because you need to exit the
327.44s: trade that's how you make money in this
329.48s: thing you have to be able to sell the
331.32s: long options for a big profit so if
334.20s: you're trading something that you're
335.56s: really forcing trying to get your way in
338.12s: that can be really difficult in order to
340.64s: find a reasonable exit point so that's
344.76s: why you have to find a balance
346.32s: specifically with respect to liquidity
347.88s: in the options chain now as we look at
350.52s: the different expirations we know Theta
352.56s: Decay accelerates once you get within 60
355.44s: DTE so the vast majority of the time my
358.80s: long options will be greater than 60
362.08s: DTE I will then bracket by how long I'm
365.84s: expecting to hold the trade sometimes
367.88s: I'll go 90 DTE sometimes I'll go 180
370.92s: sometimes I'll go way out over a year if
373.32s: it's something I'm really expecting to
374.84s: hold for the long term to the downside
377.84s: so it's completely variable depending on
380.36s: how long I expect to hold a trade
383.12s: sometimes I'll even go into 30 DTE if
385.56s: it's something I'm expecting to hold for
386.96s: a week maybe maybe up to two weeks but
389.24s: about a week sure 30 DTE is fine because
392.12s: you're not holding it that long and by
394.04s: going deeper again in the money you
395.80s: still limit your Theta Decay so you can
399.04s: again figure out what expiration makes
401.16s: sense for you the further out in time
403.68s: you go the longer your trade has to work
407.32s: in your favor the lighter your Theta
409.76s: Decay is going to be the more expensive
413.00s: your options are going to be so you got
415.56s: to figure out what's right for you
417.24s: there now let's talk about the rest of
421.64s: this structure I just walk through all
423.68s: of the details essentially on thinking
426.24s: about the put that you might purchase
428.80s: for the short out of- the money puts
431.12s: these are secondary so the primary
434.80s: profit mechanism the driver of profit in
437.28s: this trade is the long puts you cannot
439.40s: forget that so when we're adding these
442.12s: short puts they're designed to amplify
444.48s: the returns they give us a little bit of
446.04s: Premium up front they help us offset the
448.76s: cost of G Gamma or leverage depending on
451.20s: what Delta you pick for your Longs these
454.08s: are designed simply to supplement the
456.56s: position I bring that up because what
458.92s: you don't want is to try and get too
461.28s: greedy and collect too much money
463.04s: upfront via the short options and then
466.24s: cap or even worse induce more risk if
470.48s: you get an accommodating move which I'll
471.88s: show you what that looks like in a
473.48s: second so the short options it's kind of
475.80s: the inverse thought process as the in
477.96s: the money options I'm going to go less
479.60s: 60 DTE for sure the vast majority is
481.48s: going to be less than 40 even closer
483.00s: around 20 days maybe they're going to be
484.84s: out of the money because I want them to
486.16s: Decay as quickly as possible now there's
488.40s: some considerations around what strike
490.44s: price you pick this strike price is
492.96s: selected via Delta this strike price is
496.28s: kind of baked off of this one so we have
499.60s: to be thoughtful and it's not as simple
501.60s: as if we buy let me grab
507.44s: this it's not as simple as if we buy
512.36s: let's say this
513.52s: 572 it's not as simple as just saying
515.52s: well we sell something lower than that
517.32s: because the Deltas matter actually quite
519.80s: a lot and we'll get a little further
521.68s: into detail on how to think about the
523.52s: Deltas in the position so if I go to a
525.76s: risk profile just to show you what this
527.52s: thing could look
528.68s: like here we have the standard ratio put
534.36s: diagonal so let me give me out of the
535.52s: way so it's a little easier for you to
536.80s: see and you don't have to worry about
539.08s: all of these other boxes and stuff this
541.28s: is actually the old positions that I had
544.08s: but here's our base trade the long puts
547.60s: as you can tell we have unlimited profit
550.16s: potential we have cap downside risk and
552.96s: we suffer Theta Decay then we can add
555.40s: short options on top of
557.48s: it in this
559.64s: example for the short options I went out
562.00s: 31 days to expiration and I picked
564.20s: something that was like a 12 Delta again
566.40s: you can go closer to at the money and if
569.52s: we want to take a look at what an
571.00s: example of that might look like if I
573.28s: grab five of these and throw them
576.24s: in I'm sorry the further out of the
578.60s: money
580.80s: ones these
583.16s: ones so this is essentially the
585.36s: difference between those two and it
587.12s: won't look like much on this you need to
589.24s: actually look at the p&l of the open if
592.00s: we get an accommodating move so let's
593.76s: say this line right here if we go down
598.28s: by one standard Devi this trade makes
600.52s: 8,500 bucks that's using the further out
603.20s: of the money puts if we use the closer
605.64s: puts and we get that one standard
607.12s: deviation move we get
609.52s: 7980 so why is that well because these
612.44s: are a higher Delta they're going to
613.80s: start chewing into your profit factor a
616.20s: little bit quicker because of the Delta
618.52s: so what's the trade-off here well if you
620.60s: go closer to the money you're going to
622.04s: make a little bit more money up front
623.52s: I'm getting 72 cents here as compared to
626.24s: 15 cents here so again that's the next
628.88s: threshold do you have to cross when
630.36s: you're choosing what options to select
632.40s: we know how to select the long option
634.40s: for the short option once you get your
636.76s: expiration depending on what fits in
638.36s: with your
639.44s: portfolio then you have to figure out
641.84s: which Delta within there and this is the
644.24s: first tradeoff the trade-off is the
646.28s: higher Delta you pick for your short put
648.92s: you're going to collect more money up
650.12s: front but you're going to give up more
651.96s: profit
652.88s: potential got to find what works for you
655.32s: for me it'll typically baked around a 30
657.88s: Delta or less I really want to give as
661.88s: much possible profit potential to the
664.32s: base of the position which is the long
665.80s: putut the other thing you'll notice is
667.92s: notice how light of a ratio this is in
671.20s: this scenario we're long 30 of these in
674.88s: the money puts and only short five why
677.96s: is that well we're not going to collect
679.52s: a bunch of money up front that's pretty
681.76s: clear however if we start adding more
685.72s: let's say we do 10 you collect way more
688.20s: money up front but then notice what
689.88s: happened to your p&l if you get that one
691.84s: standard deviation down move now it's at
694.80s: 7,016 as compared to what you just saw
698.20s: at
700.16s: 7980 so this becomes an assessment of
704.20s: your conviction of the trade and how you
706.20s: want to produce returns this is exactly
709.92s: the name of the game here now the reason
712.40s: why I do a Rao is because if you look at
715.76s: a standard diagonal which might have
718.08s: one: one or something like that you
721.12s: actually end up with risk if it goes too
724.68s: far in your favor and I don't want that
726.92s: I want to have as much profit potential
729.40s: as possible but I don't want any risk in
732.00s: my direction now a quick admin note the
734.44s: reason why in this case with the 30
736.28s: Longs and the 30 shorts it's the same
738.72s: meaning there's no risk to the downside
741.12s: which is where I would make profit is
743.00s: because of the Deltas I picked these are
744.64s: such a high Delta they will cap out
746.20s: before these but that will change as the
748.56s: long deltas move so just an important
751.24s: note the ratio is important to maintain
753.68s: it might be a little bit misleading in
755.08s: the beginning of the trade because of
756.36s: something like that if you're selecting
757.68s: your Deltas really
759.72s: carefully so then comes the question how
763.52s: many of them do you sell it depends
765.44s: entirely on how much money you want to
767.16s: collect UPF front and then how much
768.88s: profit potential do you want to give up
770.56s: to collect that money up front only you
772.44s: can answer that for me I typically would
775.08s: try to keep a few shorts on to offset
777.92s: some of the cost of time Decay but it is
782.12s: a secondary profit Factor another thing
784.96s: is a lot of times the short option won't
787.08s: even go on at the same time as the long
789.32s: and it depends on the underlying and
790.76s: what it's doing but very frequently I'll
793.24s: buy the Longs and give them a day or two
795.32s: even to see if my move is confirmed
797.68s: before I start adding the shorts and
799.64s: then I'll add the shorts and you'll see
801.00s: a little bit more about that in a hot
804.56s: minute so that's the base structure you
807.52s: now know a little bit about the kickers
809.16s: I don't want to spend too much time on
810.52s: that because it's really a kind of a
812.24s: tertiary profit Factor but you know
814.24s: enough about them now to understand why
816.20s: they exist and why they're part of this
819.84s: so what's the overall management
821.84s: approach here for me it's really simple
823.40s: it's based on the charts I'm going to
826.52s: primarily focus on technical analysis in
829.24s: selecting where I think something might
830.72s: go how I'm going to manage risk and then
832.80s: I'm going to attempt to follow the trend
834.84s: that's the main management approach here
837.36s: so my profit taret will be defined
840.28s: before I enter as will my stops they
843.04s: will be defined before I enter now a
846.20s: couple other notes that are important to
847.88s: track with this kind of strategy and
849.64s: this is where it starts to get a little
850.96s: complicated you can simplify it if you
853.08s: want and I'll explain how when we get to
854.96s: that but the way you simplify this
858.60s: entire strategy is if you're in this
861.40s: scenario where your short puts fall in
865.80s: the money meaning it's moved in your
867.64s: favor a lot and now the underlying you
870.80s: have short puts that will be losing
873.04s: money the way you simplify this entire
876.60s: this entire strategy is if that happens
879.68s: you buy to close the short puts get rid
883.36s: of them and then you sell to close the
886.92s: long puts the entire position that's the
889.20s: simplest way to trade this again if you
891.00s: want to keep it super simple once you
893.08s: get your move you close the shorts close
896.28s: the Longs move on with your day now
898.40s: quick add ad note on that more often
900.88s: than not what I will do is sell maybe
904.44s: five of the Longs first I just want to
907.92s: assess liquidity get a sense of where
909.84s: the market is so that I know what I'm
911.64s: walking into with the rest of the exit
913.20s: of the trade and then I'll unwind the
917.28s: short options and then go back and
919.28s: finish unwinding the long options again
922.20s: kind of minor detail not a huge deal but
924.28s: something to be aware of that's the
926.16s: simple scenario here now the more
928.48s: complex scenario includes if your short
931.16s: options fall in the money we don't want
933.92s: to just book a loss on the short options
937.04s: so going back to this as an example
939.32s: let's say these 52 a half puts which are
942.08s: trading for 72 cents now let's say that
945.00s: the underlying we get a big move in our
947.36s: favor and the underlying is now down at
949.04s: 50 well these 52 and a halfs are going
951.40s: to be showing a loss because they will
953.88s: be worth more at this point so if you
956.60s: close those you're just going to eat
957.96s: that loss and I don't like doing that
960.00s: because I also want to make sure that
962.16s: I'm not realizing losses and not
965.24s: realizing corresponding gains that then
968.20s: can go away and also be losses that's a
971.28s: terrible scenario so what that could
972.84s: look like to play that out is if o drops
976.72s: it goes down here to again 50 you're
979.60s: like okay this is moving big in my favor
981.56s: I I want to get rid of the drag from the
984.04s: short options and just let it be all
985.60s: long options from here let me get rid of
987.68s: these I'll buy them at a loss it's okay
989.92s: because these are making a bunch of
991.16s: money okay so then you do that but then
993.56s: what happens if o just rallies back now
997.08s: the profit that you were using mentally
999.40s: to cover this loss is now gone and now
1001.84s: this can even turn to a loss so whenever
1004.52s: I'm adjusting in the money short puts in
1008.08s: this trade I'm either going to be
1010.36s: rolling them to defer the loss or I'm
1013.84s: going to be selling long puts to cover
1016.32s: that loss which is important to track
1018.00s: and that actually leads into what this
1019.96s: concept of a Critical Strike is so this
1023.12s: is again a quick synopsis of what we
1025.44s: just looked over so I'm giving this for
1027.96s: you kind of a general reference we can
1029.60s: skip over it and I want to give you some
1033.20s: important kind of formulas and stuff
1035.24s: don't let this overwhelm you you can
1036.84s: take your time looking at it and you can
1038.92s: even modify some of these but I'm going
1041.12s: to walk through what the Critical Strike
1043.16s: is what the long option basis is and
1046.20s: what the short putut lot
1049.84s: are here we go the Critical Strike
1054.72s: tracks the overall position so that we
1058.20s: know where we can sell short puts
1063.60s: against the Longs without potentially
1066.52s: locking in a loss that's the purpose
1069.24s: here so at the beginning of the trade
1071.52s: you can sell pretty much anything at the
1073.32s: money but what happens is as the trade
1076.84s: moves around as the these Deltas move
1080.32s: around sometimes
1082.16s: unfavorably it changes where you can
1085.88s: sell short options against the Longs and
1089.32s: not lock in a loss now the other cool
1093.40s: part is depending on your platform and
1094.80s: you don't want to do that math you don't
1096.00s: have to the platform can do it so in
1097.92s: this case our short putut strike is 52
1100.92s: and A2 if we go to 52 and A2 we can
1102.92s: clearly see that we have a profit there
1104.56s: great no problem but you have to pay
1107.36s: really close attention to that because
1108.96s: there can be instances where if you're
1111.12s: getting more and more aggressive with
1112.72s: your short puts that you can lock in a
1115.08s: loss and especially with my methodology
1117.68s: of selling the longs to cover the shorts
1120.24s: that can absolutely lock in a losing
1122.04s: position so that's what this is designed
1123.96s: to do and this is how you calculate it
1126.00s: you take the strike price the stock
1128.04s: price sorry Stock Price Less the long
1131.32s: option basis minus the long option value
1134.36s: divide that by the long option Delta
1136.00s: that essentially tells you where your
1137.24s: Critical Strike where you can start
1139.08s: offering short options now to get over
1142.40s: to this one to skip to this for a second
1146.16s: this tells us how many you can sell at
1150.92s: the current Delta so essentially if I
1153.88s: input a Delta here this will populate a
1157.12s: number for me now again you don't even
1159.64s: have to do this you can just essentially
1161.60s: assess based on what your preference is
1163.88s: for p&l where you want to set your
1167.28s: shorts up do you want to have five 10 15
1169.32s: 20 if you're doing anything in this
1171.60s: trade you got to be able to buy more
1173.60s: than one long option at least two so
1177.16s: that you can at least maintain some sort
1178.88s: of ratio right you can have two Longs
1181.00s: one
1182.04s: short this just makes sure that we're
1185.04s: not selling too many shorts against the
1188.44s: Longs that if we get a big move in our
1191.56s: favor that we can eventually start
1193.76s: looking at a loss and again to show you
1195.56s: what that looks like in the platform if
1198.28s: I start clicking
1200.24s: this essentially when there's up in this
1203.76s: case downside risk to the trade I'm just
1206.28s: doing way too many just to make it more
1208.16s: apparent but when there's risk in our
1211.40s: profit favor meaning down on the long
1214.32s: puts when there's risk in that direction
1215.84s: that's too many that means that your
1218.00s: short Deltas can overwhelm your long
1221.60s: Deltas leading to again risk in that
1224.84s: direction that I don't want so that's
1228.00s: what allows me to track that and again
1230.12s: your platform can do it just like I'm
1231.76s: doing it right there by clicking that
1233.16s: button no big
1234.64s: deal next up we have the adjusted long
1238.76s: option basis this is also really simple
1242.24s: when I'm looking at this I want to make
1244.64s: sure I know what the actual basis of the
1248.00s: long option is including the total cost
1251.56s: of the trade so what I do is I modify
1254.92s: the total cost this is the total cost of
1257.08s: the open options
1259.92s: and then I will take a look at the pnl
1263.16s: include those and then I will divide
1266.40s: that by the number of long options
1268.72s: remaining times 100 because that's the
1270.56s: multiplier for options and then this
1272.52s: will help me understand what the basis I
1274.60s: can work with on the long options
1277.52s: accounting for the closed in the money
1281.08s: puts in this case it should be puts not
1283.08s: call get rid of
1285.04s: that that's that so again some of this
1289.04s: stuff might be a little confusing take
1290.48s: your time looking at it this is just all
1293.52s: internal tracking for me you don't have
1295.76s: to do this if you have a platform like
1297.36s: thinker swim like I showed you it
1298.84s: literally will show you all of this for
1300.72s: you you don't have to worry about it I
1302.64s: think it's a good exercise to build this
1304.60s: personally but you don't have to so
1308.08s: that's kind of the basis of the trade
1310.32s: now I want to work through an example
1312.84s: with you so let's take a look at this
1317.64s: this is o back on 22 Jan o was trading
1321.04s: around 5575 you can see kind of where it
1324.00s: was right here and this was the opening
1327.84s: trade these were in the money the 60
1330.12s: puts I bought them for
1332.12s: $525 and then I sold 10 of the 55 puts
1335.92s: against it at
1337.24s: 87 so this was designed to be about a
1339.64s: $20,000 trade in total and the initial
1343.08s: debit was kind of the majority of the
1346.04s: position and I tend to like to do it
1348.00s: that way I like being able to phase into
1350.28s: the trade if I get minor moves against
1352.24s: me or if I get a big price accommodating
1355.20s: factor in my favor I like having some
1357.40s: money to be able to add to the trade
1358.96s: depending on my hypothesis and this is
1361.72s: what it looked like the way that I found
1364.16s: this trade is it showed up on a
1366.56s: breakdown scanner that I run and this
1370.12s: was also within an underperforming
1372.84s: sector I like to stack strength with
1375.80s: respect to my directional trades so if I
1378.60s: want to trade something to the downside
1380.08s: I like it when other things that are
1381.88s: like it are also going down just adds a
1384.56s: lot of weight to it it helps things move
1386.48s: in my favor in
1388.36s: general so the overall outlay for the
1391.32s: position here was that 15750 and then I
1394.76s: collected a 870 credit so in this case
1397.40s: 30 Longs 10 shorts I'm weighing way more
1400.44s: heavily The Profit potential for the
1402.68s: Longs now the way I look at establishing
1406.12s: a stop in something like this is I will
1408.96s: either use the high of the day depending
1411.48s: on what that looks like in the
1413.64s: individual ticker or I'll use near-term
1416.68s: resistance wherever I can best see it
1419.12s: that's how I will make sure that I'm
1421.32s: using stuff that makes sense on the
1423.60s: chart and then I will make sure that I'm
1426.44s: okay with the resulting potential risk
1429.40s: to the position so for example if I look
1432.00s: at these 30 60 puts and I put them on
1434.52s: for 525 and then I look at where I think
1438.04s: let's just say uh let me grab this
1441.80s: O Let's just say that I think it's
1444.88s: something around the resistance let's
1447.40s: just say I think it's something like way
1448.72s: up here
1449.76s: whatever if I use this and I think okay
1452.44s: that's where my stop would be what would
1454.40s: my p&l on this position be at that stop
1457.36s: and am I okay with it if I'm not I
1460.04s: either need to have a tighter stop
1461.84s: accepting the fact I'm probably going to
1463.24s: get stopped out or I need to size down
1466.24s: the position so that the risk makes
1468.20s: sense for what I'm putting on so on the
1471.80s: 26th of Jan there was a kind of a
1475.24s: interesting scenario where there was an
1477.96s: immediate small price accommodation once
1481.20s: we started accelerating to the downside
1484.16s: so I like this example because it walks
1487.28s: through how I try to remain sensitive to
1490.72s: the position so when I entered on the
1494.24s: 22nd of Jan a few days went by it
1497.60s: started breaking down and I started
1499.88s: seeing this weight carrying it down so
1502.88s: when I saw that I could get out of those
1505.52s: shorts for the cheap right the
1508.56s: difference here is minimal the overall
1510.56s: debit paid 950 I lose 120 bucks but this
1514.36s: is a scenario where it's starting to
1516.40s: break down I want to let it break down
1518.76s: and I don't want these shorts to get in
1520.48s: the way so in this case I don't add more
1523.96s: shorts to the position I want to let it
1526.28s: break down and that's why I cleared
1528.12s: these out earlier again you don't have
1529.88s: to do that you can just let it run its
1532.04s: course until you get to the expiration
1533.60s: of the options but I'm very involved in
1535.92s: the position personally so at this point
1538.68s: the realized p&l for the position is
1540.72s: netive 120 bucks and then the long put
1543.36s: unrealized p&l
1545.16s: unrealized is 1,200 bucks this is
1547.48s: important so at this point I'm eating
1549.72s: $1,200 and I'm very carefully monitoring
1552.72s: it now if I was being by kind of the
1556.20s: standard textbook or if this was a
1557.96s: bigger loss that I just don't care about
1560.24s: I absolutely would have Unwound some of
1563.44s: these longs to cover the cost the loss
1566.68s: of this short so in that scenario I
1569.36s: would say okay out of my 30 how many do
1571.80s: I have to sell to make more than
1575.04s: $120 that's how I would net that out for
1577.92s: me this is a small enough loss that I
1580.52s: just don't care it didn't matter to me
1582.16s: into the position this didn't balloon
1584.04s: enough you'll see an example of those
1586.12s: others in a second so we fast forward
1590.40s: time here is essentially day after and
1594.96s: we see this candle what do you guys
1596.88s: think do you think I should sell more
1599.32s: short puts here should I not sell more
1601.84s: short puts any thoughts from in the
1604.32s: comments what I ended up doing here was
1606.76s: waiting why did I wait even though it
1608.84s: looked like it was starting to base is I
1611.28s: wanted to see so for example if this
1614.00s: started heavily trending sideways I
1617.12s: absolutely would have been been okay
1619.32s: with selling puts at that point but it
1621.76s: just started to break down so I wanted
1623.84s: to give it time to continue breaking
1626.08s: down so we fast forward and again those
1629.96s: uh that let me take this away you can
1633.56s: see essentially how this trailed down
1636.60s: and then what it turned into from that
1638.76s: point which was pretty big upd but then
1642.00s: it came back down so overall giving the
1645.68s: trade as much room to move in my profit
1647.64s: factor is goal so you can see now what
1650.16s: I'm doing is sliding down my stops I'm
1654.52s: following the trade down now these
1657.28s: aren't hard stops these are soft stops
1659.76s: my hard stop would still be at this
1661.64s: point at the original p&l of the trade
1663.92s: meaning I would want to be able to get
1665.52s: out flat at worst now that I've had this
1668.76s: much of a price accommodation but I want
1671.20s: to give it enough room to work but I'm
1672.84s: going to follow along with it pretty
1674.32s: closely so the way I would use these is
1676.72s: by phasing out until I get to a hard cut
1679.64s: point because as I phase out essentially
1683.36s: what happens is I now have the ability
1686.80s: to book a profit at a higher level at
1690.92s: the lower stops and then a slightly
1692.92s: lower level at the medium stops and all
1694.56s: the way up it allows the position to
1696.28s: walk out at a decent profit even if I'm
1698.20s: being stopped out on the way up now on
1701.36s: the 16th of FB what I ended up doing was
1704.32s: now selling to open 15 of the 15 March
1707.20s: 50 puts why do you think I did that well
1710.96s: because it clearly started showing signs
1714.20s: of strength take a look at the
1715.96s: difference in these scenarios in this
1718.40s: case up here it started showing a little
1721.88s: bit of strength and then it fell off a
1724.36s: cliff here we have one Day 2 Day 3 day
1728.16s: and then a big green upward candle on
1731.00s: this fourth day so that means that it o
1734.20s: opened way down here and then it surged
1736.20s: all the way up and closed up here
1738.60s: so to me this looks like it's starting
1740.60s: to post some near-term strength which is
1742.92s: exactly why on this candle specifically
1746.16s: I was willing to offer more of these
1748.04s: short puts so those brought in a credit
1750.44s: of 675 I still had a realized loss of
1753.24s: 120 from up here and then an unrealized
1755.96s: p&l now of 8775 so here's the net on the
1760.56s: trade next we go to 8 March so as you
1764.36s: can see this is where I sold those puts
1766.80s: and you can see how the underly behaved
1768.80s: since I sold those puts you can see
1770.88s: where my stop is now we are starting to
1772.92s: get real real close so in this case what
1775.92s: I ended up doing was taking these puts
1777.92s: down for a pretty big profit I sold them
1780.16s: for 45 took them in for 8 cents so that
1783.24s: gives me 555 bucks that'll clear this
1785.52s: loss out and put something in my pocket
1787.88s: and then the unrealized on the long
1790.68s: options came down a little bit and the
1793.52s: reason why that came down a little bit
1795.48s: is because the underlying started to go
1797.40s: up so that was the wrong direction for
1799.76s: the thesis here and volatility started
1802.28s: Contracting so I offered 10 of the 19
1807.08s: April 52 a halfs for $120 that brought
1809.80s: in 1,200 bucks these were a higher Delta
1812.92s: now I'm getting closer to the current
1814.92s: spot price notice it was trading at 5288
1817.76s: I got in at the 525s why did I go so
1819.84s: close because I can collect way more
1821.72s: money and it looks like the move might
1824.28s: be about done so this is exactly why I
1827.64s: take it from here to here and as I sense
1830.28s: it's starting to base this is a long
1832.12s: time that's trending sideways now as I
1834.60s: sense it's starting to base and the
1836.04s: trade might be drying up I will start
1838.52s: repositioning the way that I set the
1840.20s: trade up but notice how I don't close
1842.08s: the trade because I think it's drying up
1843.96s: who knows this could fall off a cliff
1846.00s: and keep going to the downside as you
1848.04s: could tell I'm purposely pulling up the
1849.64s: charts at the time so that you could see
1851.68s: what I saw at the time in hindsight
1854.16s: everything is super clear but right now
1856.32s: I don't know it looks like it's based it
1858.28s: looks like it's starting to gain some
1859.52s: strength but it also does absolutely
1861.92s: look like it could roll over if it can't
1865.44s: break up above this that was the thesis
1867.40s: at the time and we get stopped out so it
1871.16s: Trends sideways for a bit more it looks
1873.76s: like it's starting to accelerate to the
1875.48s: downside and then it gains its feet back
1878.52s: and then we get stopped out right up
1880.40s: here so this was the closing trade I
1884.04s: bought to close the puts that I sold for
1887.32s: $120 20 closed them at 55 and then I
1890.00s: sold all of the long options for
1894.16s: $6.80 so this trade came out up 5735
1898.40s: which is a
1899.92s: 36.4% return on invested Capital pretty
1904.00s: simple trade overall I didn't go through
1907.04s: the cycle of selling some of the longs
1908.84s: to cover the shorts I only had one
1910.64s: scenario where I was closing in the
1912.32s: money shorts and this is more so how I
1915.12s: kind of prefer these trades to unfold in
1918.32s: their entirety like pretty simple now
1920.92s: the big thing that I want you to notice
1922.68s: here is this isn't a small move but it's
1924.76s: not a big move so where I ended up
1926.88s: entering is trading around 56 and I only
1928.60s: got like a three-point move it's not
1930.12s: much but it was still enough with
1932.28s: leverage to walk away with something on
1934.28s: that money again making 5,700 bucks on
1937.36s: 16 is not bad at all so that's how that
1940.68s: trade essentially played out it popped
1943.20s: up via a breakdown scan I knew it was
1945.20s: going to be a shorter term trade and by
1948.52s: selecting essentially the Delta that I
1951.04s: did which was around a 75 it found a
1954.88s: really good basis and the days to
1956.76s: expiration on the original leg you can
1959.80s: see again the out to 17 May from Jan so
1964.52s: I ended up going here for the sake of
1966.84s: liquidity because when you're trading
1969.80s: these kinds of things you cannot forget
1972.08s: about liquidity all right let's take a
1974.40s: look at some of these questions the
1976.76s: first one from don't ask ask is how much
1978.92s: time and effort do you put in thinking
1980.12s: through the path of the trade about zero
1982.84s: it doesn't matter I have a hypothesis
1985.16s: when I enter the trade and then I'm
1987.12s: defining my profit and loss on Entry
1989.24s: based on my best guess but the path it
1991.40s: takes to get to either of those two
1992.88s: points I don't really care about I'm
1994.68s: going to kind of see how it
1996.68s: flows then this one is if your long
2000.08s: option moves to at the money meaning
2002.24s: it's going in the wrong direction and
2004.12s: you honestly think you were just early
2006.44s: do you reset it or ride it out it's a
2008.44s: moot point right because again the p&l
2010.52s: is defined on Entry so this will be
2012.28s: defined before I even enter if it's at
2014.16s: the stop I get out if it's not at the
2015.52s: stop I don't get out simple as that can
2018.32s: you go too far out in time with the long
2020.72s: option where the structure doesn't make
2022.08s: sense this applies if you're using a
2023.84s: really low Delta the reason why it
2025.80s: applies if you're using a really low
2027.52s: Delta is if you go super far out in time
2029.88s: and you have like a 10 Delta there's no
2032.00s: gamma there either so even if you get a
2034.24s: big move you're not going to see most of
2036.20s: it if you have a long
2038.32s: in the money option with a high Delta 90
2041.04s: plus 80 plus you're going to see most of
2042.56s: the move anyway so it doesn't really
2043.96s: matter the next thing would be liquidity
2045.92s: here situation where you would consider
2048.08s: adding the kicker at any point during
2049.76s: the trade between the short and long
2051.52s: option I think I covered that a little
2053.56s: bit before that's mostly just if I'm
2055.80s: expecting some sort of big directional
2057.52s: move in my favor and I want to be able
2059.88s: to compound more
2061.56s: efficiently next question from our boy
2063.60s: shj shj says I think it pretty much
2066.00s: covers it maybe you could highlight
2067.40s: differ in management compared to a ratio
2069.32s: called diagonal not much I mean it's
2072.00s: obviously trading to the downside so the
2073.64s: way that you analyze downside moves
2075.48s: might be slightly different it is for me
2077.44s: a stock can really fall under its own
2080.04s: weight as compared to what it needs to
2081.96s: be supported up through these really
2083.44s: veracious up moves and the other thing
2085.88s: is being mindful of the volatility
2088.12s: interaction with the position which is
2089.52s: very different from a ratio called
2090.80s: diagonal again in the trade that I
2092.68s: showed you I got again not a big price
2095.16s: accommodation was less than 10% but I
2097.40s: still got enough and as it started to
2099.80s: Trend back up and V was bleeding out it
2102.40s: really took a lot of the p&l out of the
2104.76s: trade so got to be aware of those
2106.64s: impacts I think last
2109.56s: one um reek says you talk about Critical
2112.16s: Strike can you go more into that I think
2113.88s: that overall we covered that pretty far
2116.36s: in depth here actually so I imagine
2119.20s: we're probably good on that as well so
2123.00s: that's ratio put diagonals and again
2124.88s: this honestly is kind of surface level
2126.60s: this is at a really really high level
2128.28s: there's a ton to go into now the last
2131.40s: thing I do want to show you guys is a
2133.12s: trade that I have on right now which is
2135.44s: in
2136.80s: Roku and the way that I found this trade
2139.56s: was really simple this popped up on a
2141.80s: breakdown scan here so I entered Here
2145.12s: original stop was at near-term
2147.32s: resistance at least what I deemed it as
2149.96s: and then as I started getting a price
2151.76s: accommodation I start sliding it down
2153.64s: sliding it down and this is where it's
2155.84s: at now and again today is is the 18th of
2158.36s: June we'll see how it goes right now
2159.92s: it's showing a profit but not much I
2161.68s: haven't gotten a giant move yet but I
2163.36s: will follow it to the downside I have
2165.60s: inverted moving averages nice and wide
2167.92s: negative price trend it definitely fell
2170.52s: out below this near-term resistance
2172.92s: after we cracked below this kind of
2174.56s: short-term resistance I FR ran front ran
2176.84s: the move just a little bit and yeah the
2180.00s: main reason why I got in here versus
2182.00s: here is because this was a big massive
2184.60s: down day a giant rejection at this level
2187.80s: so that to me was pretty bearish and I
2190.60s: was willing to play this move even
2192.28s: though I typically would have waited for
2194.32s: a drop below here I also looked back
2196.84s: this is really where there's way more
2198.28s: support right there's one touch at this
2200.84s: level over here there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2206.84s: 9 10 11 a ton of interactions with this
2209.32s: level so it was way more relevant to me
2211.12s: anyways so we'll follow this one all the
2213.56s: way through and right now that's looking
2216.48s: like long
2218.20s: 15 of the 60s at 626 and short five of
2223.48s: the
2224.28s: 51s and again these are out in 16 August
2226.96s: the shorts are at 5 July that's all to
2229.60s: capitalize on those details we talked
2231.28s: about before and it gives me way more
2234.68s: profit potential I'm waiting the long
2237.64s: options as much as I can so that's that
2240.36s: if you have any questions let me know
2241.92s: don't forget to subscribe like the video
2244.12s: be an outlier see you guys later
