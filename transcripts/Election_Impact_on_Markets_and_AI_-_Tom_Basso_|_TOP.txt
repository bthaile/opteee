2.20s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
3.72s: outlier podcast we have a familiar face
5.88s: Tom basso welcome back hey good to be
8.72s: here Eric so here we are post election
12.92s: and we were actually just talking about
14.24s: a bunch of physical ailments um but the
17.28s: the market so far is experiencing
19.88s: seemingly very few of those the the
21.64s: market obviously had this massive
23.76s: massive
25.28s: postelection outcome rally um I'd love
28.92s: to start there with
30.52s: what you thought about the market
31.88s: positioning leading into the election
33.84s: and then the reaction post election uh
36.80s: going into the election I saw extreme
39.16s: volatility my position sizing algorithms
41.96s: are measuring the increased risk and
44.72s: volatility and downsizing my reversal
47.84s: trades in some cases one day I
50.76s: actually right after the election when
53.12s: the market went up 1500 on the Dow I
56.16s: actually got some risk peel off trades
58.56s: across the entire portfolio the whole
60.48s: portfolio risk as measured by
63.64s: aggregating all of the positions
65.68s: together got over my tolerable limit and
69.04s: I had to peel off kind of one contract
72.08s: of everything uh just to get back down
74.92s: underneath the limit that I set for
76.84s: myself and from that point on I think
80.92s: I've seen two markets that have gone
83.12s: nuts that I've had to peel off one
86.04s: contract or something but volatility
88.68s: continues uh you're getting moves like
91.52s: uh man today coko was up 678 points yeah
98.20s: and that's that's after you know like
102.12s: what uh five days ago it was somewhere
105.56s: around 2,000 points down from where it
109.04s: is now uh those are some serious moves
113.08s: um you know bonds caving in stocks were
116.44s: down across the board today so we'll see
119.44s: whether is just a pullback or people
121.44s: getting nervous but what I saw before
123.08s: the election versus
125.36s: after in before the election there was a
127.88s: lot of reversal trades uh everybody's
132.20s: guessing Okay this is going to be good
134.40s: this is going to be bad and and you get
136.28s: one day it looks like the whole thing's
137.68s: going to cave in and next day it looks
139.80s: like it's Pie in the Sky ready to go and
143.32s: I'm just kind of following my strategy
145.60s: and running right through it and
147.64s: hopefully keeping the position sizes
149.44s: down
150.76s: and uh that was a draw down for me right
154.44s: before the election it was draw down
156.60s: city right after the election a lot of
159.32s: markets just made up their mind and
161.36s: started running so it broke that
164.12s: whatever the sideways each market was
166.60s: going in some of them to the upside some
169.36s: to the down I have to say out of some 38
174.28s: markets I've got right now one two three
178.24s: four five six seven out of 38 markets
182.40s: are to the
184.00s: upside
186.00s: all it's lighter than I would have
188.68s: expected um there are some that are to
191.60s: the upside like cocoa and coffee and
193.52s: that type of thing but yeah that's just
197.24s: the positioning and remember I'm trading
200.84s: seven strategies and I've got short-term
203.32s: ones that are sort of counter Trend and
205.80s: they jump in real quick so those have
208.12s: already shifted to the downside on socks
210.84s: the longer term ones are still upside
213.00s: for the most part although some of those
214.68s: are starting to kick over uh to the
217.12s: downside so where it goes from here
220.16s: anybody guessed my favorite saying the
222.04s: market will do what the market will do
224.16s: my job as a Trader is to go along for
226.32s: the ride and I try to enjoy the ride
228.96s: when I can and uh so I don't I don't try
234.44s: to necessarily predict what'll happen
237.12s: next but um yeah news is coming out fast
241.80s: and furious on what's happening in the
244.52s: new Administration and a lot of the
248.16s: purported proposals you know that have
251.24s: uh that Trump has espoused I think from
254.44s: my amateure behavioral economic uh
258.80s: analyst Viewpoint I think would be very
261.76s: positive for the economy so I could see
264.88s: the stock market being happy about what
268.16s: they're you know hearing
270.96s: now lot's got to happen before it kicks
274.00s: in uh you're talking first a whole lot
277.08s: of approvals of the cabinet you've got
280.40s: all sorts of laws that need to be passed
283.12s: executive orders that need to be
285.44s: signed uh economy the size of uh the
290.28s: United States does not turn around on a
292.44s: dime you're going to it's going to take
294.44s: months and maybe uh multiple quarters to
298.28s: even see any kind of a effect and in
300.64s: some traction and the numbers starting
302.40s: to turn and there may be some tougher
306.12s: periods
307.24s: before uh it catches and really starts
310.44s: paying off but I think he's on the right
312.80s: track I think a lot of these proposals
315.40s: are spot on I think they'll really
317.44s: really help the US economy long
320.80s: term bunch of questions I want to start
323.48s: with one of your comments first because
325.52s: it's something that I typically actually
328.24s: say myself and I find a lot of people
332.20s: seem to struggle with what I mean when I
334.12s: say it so I'm curious how you would
336.16s: explain it to somebody when you say
337.68s: something like you try not to predict
340.64s: the market right you try to go along
342.28s: with what the market is doing I actually
343.88s: know exactly what you mean however a lot
346.40s: of people they struggle to understand
350.48s: how that actually reflects positioning
352.88s: because no matter what if you have an
354.64s: open position it is some sort of
356.80s: forecast of expected future price
358.88s: Behavior
360.28s: so how do you how would you explain that
362.84s: to somebody when they say how does that
365.08s: work well what I I try to think about it
368.32s: I I say to people is that I TR I like to
371.36s: try to trade in the now in the Zen like
374.68s: experience of at this moment in time
377.48s: this second this minute this day this
381.20s: year the markets are doing something at
384.56s: this moment when I look down 38 markets
388.40s: and I analyzed them by way of seven
391.28s: different types of indicator
393.44s: combinations and parameter sets and
395.80s: everything
396.80s: else I can rate each one of those 38
401.32s: markets as being in an up or down
403.68s: Direction so at this moment I want to be
407.64s: in the same direction as all those
409.72s: markets up or down I'm completely
412.52s: agnostic I have no clue why Coco's going
415.36s: up like it did today um but I'm long
420.08s: so it was my uh largest position profit
423.96s: today and you know I don't sit there and
427.40s: analyze it and say well you know I
428.96s: should peel off some positions I have
430.92s: algorithms for that even uh I'm willing
433.84s: to hold a certain percentage of my
436.40s: equity in a cocoa position or a coffee
439.24s: position or a corn position or whatever
441.64s: else a stock position uh and whenever
446.20s: the risk level and the volatility level
448.40s: as a percent of my equity gets too high
451.04s: I take off just enough to get back down
453.28s: to an acceptable level so I've even got
455.96s: that algorithmization
479.60s: that say this is up or this is down and
482.44s: I want to take all that together and it
484.84s: gives me the direction I should be in
486.64s: how many contracts I should hold and um
490.64s: and then I total it up and see if my
492.56s: portfolio is getting overweighted
494.44s: because maybe all these markets are
496.36s: correlating with each other or something
498.12s: and I want to keep my risk managed and
500.84s: then I'm done I don't need to predict
502.84s: anything uh because the moment that I'm
506.56s: doing all this is now but tomorrow is
509.72s: going to be another moment in time and
512.48s: I'm going to have changes I'm going to
514.24s: have some of these shorts go long and
516.00s: I'm going to have some of the Longs go
517.28s: short going to have a whole bunch of
519.16s: positions that just stay the same
520.84s: direction as they stay and I'm just
523.32s: going to wait for those big runs the big
525.48s: runs pay the freight all these small
528.08s: runs that go back and forth and you know
530.04s: Market flips back and forth six times in
533.36s: the in six weeks that's going to be a
535.64s: loser for me but I'm going to limit
537.48s: those losses and make sure that they're
539.76s: very small then you get on the the large
542.84s: Runner which seems like at one any one
546.20s: time uh stocks have been doing really
548.72s: well this week pretty much after the uh
552.48s: after the election uh generally up uh a
556.88s: few softs here and there on the
559.20s: commodity side have done well uh corn
562.72s: and some of the grains are in a trend to
564.52s: the downside that's been profitable so
567.52s: had a good day in the grains today
570.44s: and so you you just kind of try to find
574.60s: where there's a trend and in that
576.20s: instant you make sure your
578.36s: portfolios positioned with that snapshot
581.64s: in time and then you feel freed up to
585.00s: make another snapshot in time tomorrow
587.12s: and the next day and the next day and
588.72s: the next day so I'm not really making a
591.40s: prediction I'm I'm just positioning my
593.40s: portfolio the way the markets are acting
595.64s: today it's a really great way to kind of
600.04s: explain the process because for me I
601.84s: typically would say I I just use like a
603.80s: a basian approach which is exactly what
606.08s: you're describing right it's based on
607.88s: updating your probabilities based on new
609.64s: information so I I I like that as a
612.24s: descriptor like I said it's something
613.72s: that the problem with your description
616.04s: is most clients or most Traders when you
618.60s: say
620.08s: theasian yeah yeah that's exactly it and
623.24s: I lost I yeah staying in the now it's a
627.68s: Zen like thing I you know I need to work
630.44s: I need to work on my communication
631.84s: skills they're not great it's a Mr
634.04s: Serenity type thing yeah I um yeah so
640.08s: one of the things that I'm interested
642.88s: though kind of finding this balance
644.88s: between you know trading what exists now
647.68s: and in forecast opportunities one of the
650.40s: things that I find really interesting
653.48s: and even lucrative at the point is when
656.32s: we have Trump and his you know policies
659.68s: flooding the market people starting to
661.56s: speculate okay it looks like um
664.92s: windmills probably not going to do super
666.92s: great he's not a big fan of windmills
668.96s: apparent I don't know if you saw the
669.96s: podcast with Joe Rogan but he was
671.08s: talking about how it messes up the
672.36s: whales I didn't even know that that's
673.96s: new new news to me yeah they make a a
676.96s: noise that hums and messes with the
679.84s: whales uh navigation system and
682.44s: communication systems isn't that the
684.68s: coolest thing about markets though is
686.24s: that you have an opportunity to learn
687.52s: about some sort of interaction between a
689.60s: thing in Wales I never would have known
691.60s: that yeah I think I saw that someplace I
694.24s: don't know if it's been or not but
695.88s: that's the speculation of why so many
698.28s: whales are washing up in New Jersey and
700.40s: other places that's they're building the
703.12s: windmills which is fascinating and so as
706.52s: I see these different policies though
708.40s: coming out from trump it seems like
709.96s: there are some fairly predictable themes
713.20s: coming in front of us right one of them
715.20s: is oil he clearly is a fan of oil wants
717.88s: to tap more into oil so then some
720.08s: Traders are probably speculating well I
722.04s: think oil goes up at some point maybe
724.16s: now maybe you know six months from now
725.76s: nine months from now is that something
728.12s: that would get you to venture into
730.72s: individual trades or you're staying in
732.12s: Futures going to trade oil as a
733.64s: commodity as that moves whenever I trade
736.48s: oil I trade natural gas I trade UNL gas
740.00s: in New
741.16s: York um those are the three energies I
744.28s: think that I'm in haven't gotten into
747.48s: trading uh Brent crew
749.80s: that involves a little more complexity
751.68s: and I'd rather keep my life
754.16s: simple why is that the case um I think
757.40s: it's traded in UK so therefore you end
761.04s: up with British pound conversions and
764.12s: you know interactive brokers could
765.92s: handle the transaction I know that but
768.88s: uh I would have to sign up for data I'd
770.92s: have to sign up um you know there
772.92s: there's exchange fees or whatever to uh
776.00s: to get the data then there's it's one
778.56s: more ticker to keep track of
782.32s: um yeah you know there's this just to
786.16s: add one market takes me sometimes to get
790.04s: it into the automated process check
792.56s: everything out involves a week or two of
796.68s: you know working on specs and making
800.00s: sure the specs are in the computer right
802.16s: and uh dealing with whatever currency
805.16s: risk I might have with that particular
807.08s: Market some things are priced in US
809.36s: dollars makes it a lot easier for me
811.04s: since I'm a US guy uh but if you know if
813.92s: you got trade it in UK uh pounds then
818.04s: you would have
819.20s: to you know realize that you're going to
821.40s: end up with a UK pound position you
823.12s: could either hedge that position or you
825.36s: could just treat it as another
827.08s: speculative position and let it run as a
830.80s: hedge against your US dollar so you have
833.56s: kind of look at that make decisions see
835.52s: if you want to deal with that risk with
838.20s: an actual ninth Strate eighth strategy
841.20s: or ninth strategy would be your currency
843.20s: hedging strategy or
845.56s: something and then you'd have to uh make
848.88s: sure you periodically uh zero out that
851.72s: risk if you wanted to zero it out
853.52s: there'd be it's you got to think through
855.88s: a lot of details make sure all the eyes
858.08s: are dotted keys are crossed and then I
860.72s: give it the green light and we start
862.20s: trading it and I've
864.44s: added probably about three or four
868.52s: markets three maybe three markets in the
871.40s: last um three months roughly I'm I'm
875.96s: trading iron or in
878.32s: Singapore I'm trading uh rap seed in
882.12s: Canada or Canola if you choose and I'm
886.08s: also trading the vix on the
888.20s: CME is that that's where the vix is let
890.80s: me see pretty sure uh no it's CBOE is
895.64s: the volatility index yeah uh the Futures
899.52s: is traded on the S
902.16s: CFE whatever that
905.16s: is when you're going through the process
907.52s: of deciding to add new products how does
911.68s: how does that work is it you're taking
914.20s: something out of your basket of stuffs
916.12s: and putting something in or do you see
917.88s: something that's moving interestingly
919.24s: you're like I want to add this to my
920.84s: basket uh it's not necessarily even
923.80s: something moving it's something that
926.12s: catches my eye that has sufficient
927.84s: liquidity and
929.96s: movement
931.92s: to be a viable trading vehicle and I'm
936.84s: especially attracted if it's something
938.60s: like iron ore which doesn't necessarily
941.80s: correlate with anything else in my
943.72s: portfolio and has the time zone
946.24s: diversification of trading out of
947.92s: Singapore so I like the concept over
951.00s: time I will be trading more and more
953.56s: things like Brent crude that would be in
955.76s: other time zones and their liquidity
959.76s: is maybe a little bit bigger over in
962.52s: that time zone and you know if something
965.60s: happens in the middle of the night and
967.60s: my crude oil position here in the states
969.60s: is not really open for trading maybe the
972.48s: Brent crude
974.12s: is you can partially mitigate some risk
977.52s: uh so those types of things over time as
980.72s: my portfolio keeps getting bigger and
982.44s: bigger um you know I'll be looking at
984.56s: adding more markets no doubt but I'm
987.00s: pretty careful about adding them I don't
988.68s: just Adam just to have a long list that
992.36s: seems foolish on my part as a retired
994.72s: guy I just I'm trying to keep my life
997.76s: easy so well yeah and I'm I'm interested
1000.60s: too because even 30s something products
1003.84s: is not insignificant and it almost seems
1005.92s: like in in your scenario I would I
1008.20s: honestly would expect like 10 to 15 and
1010.56s: just pick stuff that's inverse
1012.24s: non-correlated something like that so
1013.88s: obviously you're finding a lot of
1015.12s: opportunities though that you're like in
1017.00s: the movement yeah and even you know you
1019.52s: take the four grains I just mentioned a
1021.24s: little while ago today corn was the big
1023.48s: winner to the downside but I'm short all
1027.52s: of them or I'm net short of all of them
1029.52s: in some strategies I'm long others I'm
1031.52s: short net short though on all of them
1034.68s: and so the grains all total did very
1036.96s: well but what you realize when you dig
1039.76s: into under the hood corn was already
1042.60s: short so had a big day the other uh
1047.00s: soybean oil soybeans and wheat for
1050.00s: instance in some cases one of them was
1052.92s: long and flipped to the short side and
1054.88s: the others were short and didn't really
1057.12s: move very much so you end up with kind
1061.16s: of a diversification even amongst four
1064.24s: different grains and the same thing's
1066.44s: true I just recently had a trade I trade
1068.48s: Ultra buns and treasury buns one's like
1071.72s: a 50-year horizon the other one's
1074.60s: 30 and uh or I guess Ultra buns is over
1078.36s: 30 I I guess something like that
1081.12s: whatever the definition is they're
1082.76s: slightly different on the yield curve
1084.76s: and what you find just recently in the
1086.84s: last month I had a trade where I was
1089.68s: actually heavily into the ultra bonds
1092.32s: one way and I had already backed off the
1095.44s: treasury bond position didn't get a
1097.16s: trade so there's a diversification even
1099.84s: amongst something like interest rate
1101.76s: debt you know debt Futures so you see
1104.96s: that from time to time sure there's a
1106.72s: lot of correlation between those two
1108.80s: most of the time and as there is in
1111.28s: grains and meats and energy and and
1114.96s: currencies you know right now the dollar
1117.20s: strong and all the non- US currencies
1120.76s: are having a
1122.84s: struggle you know that'll break apart
1125.04s: and all of a sudden the British pwn or
1126.60s: the Swiss frank will be going up and the
1128.24s: rest are going down
1130.20s: and I I don't try to analyze it too much
1134.60s: uh you know the direction shifts I go
1137.16s: with it
1139.92s: sure sure and so when you're looking at
1143.68s: some of the the policy that's coming out
1147.16s: though from from trump it it's a lot of
1149.88s: people are speculating and I would
1151.48s: probably agree with the majority of them
1153.24s: that it does look like a lot of
1155.36s: inflationary practice probably coming in
1157.80s: the short term and the reason why a lot
1161.20s: of people and I do agree with that is
1164.00s: from a perspective of cutting spending
1166.96s: which is good but obviously that'll
1168.76s: impact
1169.76s: GDP and the near-term impact of stuff
1174.84s: like that I'm wondering if you have an
1178.68s: opinion on it obviously it seems like
1180.20s: you don't think it's going to be quite
1181.36s: as inflationary so I'd love to learn
1183.08s: about that I don't um for starters
1186.24s: negotiations using tariffs and things
1188.40s: like that cause foreign countries to
1192.12s: have problems getting stuff into the
1195.00s: country if they do it will be more
1197.72s: expensive but they're more inclined to
1200.56s: do if they're a multinational
1202.12s: corporation especially if you can get
1204.16s: the 15% if you build it in the United
1206.28s: States Tax Rate you've just put United
1209.52s: States into a top quartile competitive
1212.88s: position to build your next Factory in
1215.52s: the United States because that's where
1217.16s: your Market is the largest and that's
1220.12s: where there's plentiful supply of
1222.28s: skilled labor and Ai and computer
1227.12s: systems and server systems and
1228.76s: everything else so if you have your
1232.20s: choice do you uh you know build it in
1236.20s: Ghana or someplace like that because you
1238.52s: can get very cheap labor but you're not
1241.16s: even sure about the legal system there
1244.12s: you know like do your factory and it
1246.64s: might be in the middle of a revolution
1248.44s: or something a year from now or do you
1250.96s: go to a United States where you're
1253.28s: building it closer to where you're
1255.32s: selling it so Transportation becomes
1257.80s: less of an issue do you you get the
1259.96s: employees you need yes they are more
1261.92s: expensive but there's more automation
1264.44s: there's more robotics maybe you're
1266.36s: you're build a state-of-the-art factory
1268.92s: so a lot of capital flow comes in when
1271.76s: you do stuff like that uh by way of us
1276.76s: corporations and multinational
1278.76s: corporations deciding to infuse capital
1281.64s: in the United States because that's the
1283.52s: the easiest decision to make and in some
1286.44s: cases it's the best if you make the tax
1289.36s: rate loan off you literally are going to
1292.76s: be the the winning Choice when they do
1295.16s: the spreadsheet and say we could build
1297.28s: it here here you know Switzerland or we
1299.44s: could build it in Ghana or we could
1300.84s: build it in Australia or whatever and
1303.24s: you start figuring it out they start
1304.88s: saying well you know the US is looking
1306.76s: like a good place to build a factory so
1309.04s: Capital comes in more
1311.76s: jobs uh more supply of things the the
1316.00s: energy alone over the very short run
1319.56s: won't have an effect but over the say 6
1322.08s: months 12 months if you open up energy
1324.92s: and drive energy down energy goes into
1327.80s: literally everything you buy uh you know
1330.48s: the farmer has got to pay for the gas
1332.16s: for the tractor he's got to deal with
1335.44s: the fertilizers which are made largely
1337.44s: from
1338.64s: petrochemicals uh I was a chemical
1340.48s: engineer by degree so we had a lot of
1343.08s: petrochemical uh operations uh down in
1346.04s: Texas for instance where you're you're
1348.28s: cut cutting off a stream of product from
1351.20s: a barrel of oil and then you're taking
1353.52s: it and feeding it into all sorts of
1355.24s: other intermediaries Plastics and all
1358.44s: sorts of other things that we take for
1360.32s: granted every day that really come from
1362.80s: oil originally so if you drive the price
1365.80s: of that down you just drove the price of
1367.88s: everything down and so if you if you can
1371.56s: in say 12 months cut the price of oil in
1374.56s: half because you become the major
1376.72s: producer in the world you just did a lot
1379.88s: to to drop the prices of food drop the
1383.04s: prices of plastics drop the prices of a
1385.68s: whole lot of things and that's
1388.44s: anti-inflationary I I don't see some of
1391.40s: his policies as being inflationary at
1394.60s: all yeah well and I think you hit the
1396.96s: important point there right is like the
1398.44s: the different time frames because I
1400.08s: think most people and again myself
1402.04s: included wouldn't expect it to be
1404.20s: inflationary long term exactly to your
1406.28s: point but like is is you're talking
1409.48s: about like the the factories and whatnot
1411.84s: that that's not a six-month thing no
1414.00s: that's G to take years to build it but
1416.32s: but and I tell you what the Federal
1418.44s: Reserve doing what they did just before
1420.16s: the election dropping by half a point I
1423.16s: thought that's
1425.20s: insane a quarter of a point would have
1427.48s: been plenty and just leave it alone and
1429.52s: be careful that half point just kind of
1432.96s: smacked up a little bit of
1435.12s: politics and a juicing and what I worry
1438.64s: about is then with the latest inflation
1440.56s: numbers and GDP growth and all that some
1443.44s: of which could be you know revised later
1446.80s: which seems to happen a lot lately you
1449.48s: notice um you know to me uh you know
1455.08s: January 20th rolls around and inflation
1458.24s: is is going crazy again then all of a
1462.00s: sudden Trump's got another problem to
1463.60s: deal with and
1466.16s: uh who knows whether that's by design or
1469.04s: not I tell you what this is such a
1472.28s: screwed up mess uh yeah the American
1476.20s: citizen seems to be totally left out of
1478.52s: the picture in terms of decision making
1480.84s: sometimes I think but right now I I'm
1485.88s: cautiously optimistic that based on the
1489.20s: types of people he's proposing for his
1491.36s: cabinet the types of proposals that he
1494.52s: very detailed articulate detailed way
1498.60s: articulated on the campaign Trail if he
1501.12s: can get all of those things in place the
1503.80s: no tax on tips I think is a slam dunk uh
1508.44s: and if you overtime too right overtime
1511.88s: what do you do if you take the taxes off
1513.80s: overtime you encourage overtime you
1516.12s: encourage hustle you encourage people to
1518.60s: work harder more
1520.80s: productivity um all very beneficial to
1523.84s: the economic growth of the country which
1526.44s: increases tax revenues no matter what
1529.80s: level of taxes you put on it uh you're
1532.48s: going to increase tax revenues laugh or
1534.56s: curve at work you know drop the
1536.68s: incremental rate increase the amount of
1539.36s: growth and end up with more tax revenues
1541.84s: in the process so I mean all of these
1546.32s: proposals no tax on social security um
1550.72s: those types of proposals make it
1553.24s: possible for you to fire about 34 of the
1556.36s: IRS agents and I think a lot of our
1559.64s: inflation is really due to not you know
1562.56s: the Doge thing the uh Department of
1565.40s: governmental efficiency half a trillion
1567.60s: yeah half a trillion of waste and fraud
1570.52s: in our government out of Seven Something
1572.72s: trillion spent uh two trillion deficit
1576.24s: every year you get Whittle that down to
1578.56s: zero easily I think uh you get that down
1582.36s: and start producing a surplus with
1584.12s: things like tariffs and and a lot more
1587.08s: oil being produced and stuff like that
1589.20s: and all of a sudden uh government
1591.44s: revenues are increasing and the economy
1594.60s: is Rip roaring and you know
1596.64s: unemployment's in good shape everybody's
1598.56s: having a good time and what you end up
1601.12s: with out of that is running a surplus
1602.80s: and start paying down the
1604.92s: debt what are your per what's your
1607.60s: perspective on the possibility of a
1609.40s: recession sometime in like the next 24
1611.36s: years I know it's esoteric and there's
1613.04s: different definitions and stuff but just
1614.36s: from a a general perspective I'm curious
1616.44s: if you think about it and if so what or
1618.44s: 24 years 24 months okay so two years
1622.04s: sorry you said years oh well that it
1625.92s: would be more difficult I was gonna
1628.32s: answer that with let's see I'm 72 that
1630.84s: would make me 96 don't care anymore care
1635.12s: bring it on whatever it
1637.20s: is next 48 months chance of a recession
1640.64s: I think
1642.76s: um if this most recent move by the FED
1646.48s: ends up firing up inflation again which
1649.40s: I think it has a possibility of
1651.48s: doing and if then the short-term moves
1654.84s: that Trump's
1656.40s: making are very short-term inflationary
1659.56s: then the FED tries to respond by
1662.44s: overdoing it again and being too late
1665.12s: and not getting ahead of the problem
1667.64s: which they seem to do a lot of lately uh
1670.68s: you end up with then maybe a contraction
1673.48s: and uh yeah maybe it could slip I I
1676.80s: think with what he's proposing I think
1678.72s: it's that's going to fight the tendency
1681.28s: for a recession so I think it might be a
1684.20s: slower growth economy for a little while
1686.68s: but I'm not
1688.00s: sure I I think the possibility of a
1690.64s: recession is too awfully high at this
1693.08s: point yeah it's and that's an
1695.64s: interesting point specifically talking
1697.68s: about the the balance between some of
1700.16s: the policies and kind of the current
1701.68s: trajectory that we're on yeah um when
1704.80s: you're thinking about stuff like Apple
1708.56s: production of things right obviously
1711.36s: they they really favor offshore
1713.64s: production and I have to imagine that
1716.44s: they've done tons of analys on you know
1719.60s: where where they would prefer to produce
1721.00s: and stuff like that do you think moving
1724.08s: from 21 to 20% corporate and then 15% if
1728.12s: it's domestic do you think that's enough
1729.44s: to move the needle for somebody like
1730.88s: apple or do you still think that it
1732.08s: would be too cheap comparatively because
1734.24s: I mean they're literally just putting up
1735.88s: nets to catch people from it won't be
1738.96s: just the 15% it'll be also the potential
1743.28s: for tariffs on Goods coming from China
1746.28s: it'll also be the board of directors of
1750.44s: Apple getting around the table and
1752.20s: saying you know China's not exactly a
1756.84s: comfortable place legally I mean they
1759.28s: could come in and shut us down overnight
1762.08s: United States is going to let us be and
1764.88s: do our thing and you know we're a
1766.64s: respected company in the United States
1769.12s: they're going to protect our interests
1771.80s: if we're here for strategic purposes
1775.36s: since we sell a lot of stuff here maybe
1778.56s: we should go ahead and bite the bullet
1780.64s: and there makes a lot of sense to put a
1782.76s: plant here as a strategic backup in case
1788.00s: China decides to shut Apple down for
1789.96s: some reason overnight then Apple's got
1793.32s: alternate facilities that are a little
1795.44s: bit more secure so it's a supply
1798.72s: a supply
1800.08s: chain Logistics lots of different
1803.20s: decisions would go into that but yeah
1806.68s: taxes would definitely be one of them in
1809.76s: your perspective what has led them to
1813.12s: not make that decision already then if
1815.00s: it's based on the potential risk of like
1817.16s: the Chinese government like shutting
1818.52s: them down do you think that they just
1819.80s: needed one a couple more pieces to push
1822.00s: him over oh it's 21% now and and the
1825.52s: current Administration was going to let
1827.16s: the tax
1828.64s: uh breaks expire which means that the
1831.44s: tax rate was on its way up I see they
1834.16s: probably at least would wait until the
1836.48s: election cleared the landscape and then
1839.36s: they could make a more logical decision
1841.04s: at least for the next four years and um
1844.64s: yeah if I were them I would wait until I
1846.40s: saw the results of the election because
1849.00s: the way it was going was not going to be
1850.68s: very favorable to the United States and
1852.28s: I think it would have really increased
1854.40s: dramatically the chance of a recession
1856.36s: or worse in the next two years
1859.04s: interesting and so from a broader
1861.60s: trading perspective obviously you're
1863.68s: trading like the yield curve and stuff
1865.32s: like that do you have a perspective on
1867.40s: real estate in
1869.88s: general yeah my wife's more the real
1872.16s: estate expert you should be asking her
1873.68s: that question perfect bring her up I'm
1875.48s: just she she just got uh some work done
1879.68s: on on one of her eyes she's got a little
1881.80s: bit of um a problem with one of her eyes
1884.04s: so we just came from the eye doctor and
1885.88s: just barely got for this interview so
1888.12s: she's in the other room with her foot up
1891.00s: um but she would say I think and and I
1894.36s: have to agree with her that real
1896.40s: estate's been pretty good for a long
1898.20s: time with higher interest rates it's
1899.92s: Frozen everybody sort of where they are
1902.76s: they don't want to sell what they've got
1904.72s: because if they went to someplace else
1906.36s: their mortgage rate would go up a great
1908.36s: deal well with what seems to be
1911.88s: happening and if we look at um you know
1917.20s: pictures of the the bond market for
1920.28s: instance has been going sideways on my
1922.88s: graph here
1924.24s: for H about a month or so which is just
1927.80s: before the election just after the
1929.48s: election not a huge amount of movement
1931.84s: up or down and if that starts to rally
1935.76s: at all and drop those interest rates and
1938.64s: if the economy starts getting more
1940.36s: optimistic you're already seeing
1941.72s: businesses getting optimistic you're
1943.68s: seeing more announcements of people
1946.12s: wanting to bring uh factories and
1948.64s: business back in the United States deals
1951.24s: are going to happen with more frequency
1953.28s: now because you're going to get a rid of
1955.12s: that anti-
1957.72s: Monopoly uh bureaucracy in Washington
1960.64s: that seem to be against any deals uh
1964.32s: large deals for sure and um so when that
1967.60s: stuff starts happening and you free up
1970.28s: the the capital markets and the flow of
1972.96s: deals and the building of factories and
1975.72s: the jobs coming in uh you end up with a
1979.48s: more of an optimism more people are
1981.28s: going to take chances with buying a new
1983.40s: house uh you know getting that house
1985.64s: that they wanted out in the country or
1987.28s: in the suburbs or or that downtown condo
1990.68s: so they could be near all the action but
1992.44s: it was out of their reach back in the
1994.12s: days they had to rent and now they can
1997.00s: actually think about that million dooll
1998.60s: condo because they can afford it and so
2002.32s: I think that you'll see uh real estate
2005.24s: perk up now over the short run on until
2008.08s: we get the economy doing all those
2009.92s: things maybe the next 6 months or
2011.56s: something you could see some softness
2013.56s: maybe uh because if somebody really
2016.84s: needs to sell something like you guys
2019.32s: out in California for instance I think
2021.20s: you're in California aren't you you're
2022.56s: out San
2024.44s: Diego uh it's hard to remember with all
2026.68s: the people interviewing me where they're
2028.24s: from but uh I seem to remember you being
2030.88s: a San Diego boy and when you get a lot
2034.76s: of people trying to get out of place
2036.64s: like California
2038.76s: that's obviously less demand and you
2041.96s: have a fixed Supply so that's not
2045.08s: necessarily positive for prices on
2048.00s: places like uh say Texas Florida even
2052.12s: Arizona Scottdale is not showing a whole
2054.88s: lot of sign of downturn because we keep
2057.64s: having you California types coming over
2059.56s: here and buying up our real estate after
2061.88s: selling your mansion in California
2064.52s: that's it so they can buy a modest house
2067.16s: here and Bank a whole bunch of money
2069.68s: that's right that's the Playbook yeah
2072.36s: it's a you know it's a pretty easy
2074.40s: decision financially now yeah if you're
2076.88s: into the ocean and surfing and uh the
2079.68s: outdoors and you know do you don't like
2082.32s: the heat of the desert in the summer you
2085.32s: don't like Cactus or other reasons you
2087.40s: know there's there's lots of reasons to
2089.80s: dislike uh depending on your own
2091.96s: preferences but I love it here I love
2093.88s: the dry air I love the heat I'm an old
2097.00s: guy uh my my sore aing muscles feel
2100.12s: better when they're hot rather than when
2102.44s: they're cold and I breathe better in the
2105.12s: dry I have less allergy so I can
2107.88s: sing uh so yeah it's all good here this
2111.72s: is my favorite place on Earth but you
2114.72s: know it's not for everybody but we're
2116.28s: getting a steady supply of new people
2119.08s: coming in all the time here yeah and
2121.52s: it's funny actually my my wife and I we
2123.40s: planning a trip uh this month out to
2126.24s: Denver because we're looking at we're
2128.04s: looking at doing the Playbook you got to
2129.76s: you got to execute the game plan um
2132.64s: because I mean I I'm not from California
2134.32s: originally anyway I was stationed here
2136.08s: for a few years hung out for a bit liked
2138.20s: it um but yeah the the overall approach
2142.08s: that you're explaining is exactly what a
2144.12s: lot of us seem to do gratefully so but I
2148.08s: don't know who's going to be the last
2150.16s: one that leaves and turns the light out
2152.24s: you know at some point it's got to
2154.16s: affect real estate which is development
2157.40s: of
2158.20s: subdivisions it's got to affect the
2160.68s: development of Roads refurbishing of
2163.60s: Roads uh you know I noticed many times
2166.56s: when I'm out in California these days if
2168.36s: I drive out there that my car is hitting
2171.96s: more potholes and cracks in the highways
2174.48s: and just seems like it's not quite as
2178.16s: smooth as it was back in the you know
2180.36s: 80s let's say when California was a bit
2183.56s: more in its
2184.72s: Heyday I've noticed the kind of the over
2187.88s: the decades uh slight deterioration in
2191.44s: some of the
2192.60s: infrastructure and U so I don't know
2195.36s: we'll see how it all sorts out but
2197.48s: there's lots it's a big country out
2199.32s: there and there's lots of beautiful
2200.72s: country I've traveled a lot of it
2202.88s: and I choose to make this my home it
2205.48s: makes sense for a lot of different
2206.80s: reasons for Brenda and myself but
2210.32s: um even uh I mean I have a a nephew that
2215.08s: is now moving just north of
2218.12s: DC he's an expert in aerial
2220.60s: reconnaissance so he's going to be
2222.68s: working for the government he gets a 40%
2225.56s: increase in his salary he's one of these
2228.80s: guys that looks at the aerial
2230.16s: photographs and say says that's a
2232.72s: terrorist right there going into that
2234.88s: house we should arm you know we should
2237.92s: get a drone up there and take that place
2240.20s: out and uh so that's kind of what he
2243.68s: does he ruins his eyes all day long
2245.96s: looking at Ariel
2248.36s: photos but uh hey if you're good at it I
2251.84s: guess you it's a useful skill definitely
2255.44s: and it it actually leads to to a follow
2258.04s: on because one of the most interesting
2260.64s: things that we've learned so far from a
2262.68s: military perspective is the the
2264.84s: engagement that we're seeing in Israel
2267.64s: and Hamas a little bit less so that's a
2269.32s: little bit more traditional still some
2270.88s: elements that we're learning from
2272.24s: definitely Ukraine and Russia we have
2274.48s: learned so much about what would call
2277.92s: ttps T tactics techniques and procedures
2281.60s: to understand approach and this entire
2284.24s: new scale and methodology of warfare is
2288.60s: it's fascinating is the easiest way to
2290.88s: describe it and I say fascinating
2292.48s: because there's elements of it that's
2294.04s: freaking terrifying because you can have
2296.48s: these small drones that cost a few
2298.40s: hundred that can literally literally um
2301.72s: not necessarily um wipe out so to speak
2304.64s: but definitely incapacitate a squad
2306.96s: which now for the Marine cor 13 13
2309.60s: people um that doesn't seem obviously to
2313.44s: be slowing down when you see again
2317.24s: taking it back to the election since
2318.84s: it's so fresh one of Trump's imperatives
2322.44s: is he's talking about trying to end the
2324.24s: conflict in Ukraine and Russia any
2326.36s: thoughts on what that might look
2328.00s: like yeah I think Trump's uh you know
2330.96s: the art of the deal guy he's going to go
2332.72s: to both parties and he's going to get
2335.56s: their musts and wants
2338.04s: and if
2339.12s: there's anything whatsoever that there's
2342.76s: the musts can be distinctly met and then
2347.36s: it's down to the wants you give and take
2350.00s: and you some money flows and who knows
2353.44s: the United States may buy somebody off
2355.40s: and say okay we'll give you this much to
2357.28s: repair that and you stay over here and
2360.16s: everybody's Happy from here on in you
2362.40s: know he'll work the deal and he'll
2364.12s: figure it out and then get both of them
2366.16s: to agree and all of a sudden more
2368.36s: stops and if you were to more than one
2371.72s: more deal he's done a lot of them and if
2374.52s: you were to speculate the probability of
2377.64s: like some sort of deal being arranged is
2379.92s: that kind of what you're thinking is
2381.48s: likely to occur do you think it's going
2382.76s: to be an attempt and then it might get
2384.24s: dragged out or anything like that no
2386.68s: because I think both parties over there
2388.60s: Ukraine and and Russia both
2391.16s: want to quit wasting hundreds of
2394.32s: thousands of people and lots of money
2396.56s: getting blown up in bombs and missiles
2398.64s: and drones and it's a hassle on both
2402.16s: sides there's no
2403.92s: really nobody's winning it's the whole
2408.20s: thing is ridiculous and so when when
2411.96s: when Trump sits down and get goes to
2413.72s: each of them he'll figure it out
2415.56s: there'll be a deal
2417.40s: made yeah I'm obviously with my
2420.84s: background I'm I'm really really
2422.48s: interested to see how that reconciles
2426.04s: because right now if anything was drawn
2429.40s: based off of like the current lines
2431.48s: Russia would gain some territory which
2433.28s: would be very interesting uh to to frame
2437.72s: it lightly but then when I look at the
2441.68s: uh the overall scale of things it does
2446.40s: make me really interested to understand
2448.52s: like if what what kind of deal could be
2450.72s: made that would maintain Ukraine's
2454.40s: borders and that's the one that I'm
2456.40s: curious if it's even possible yeah I you
2460.04s: know sort
2462.04s: of I think Trump or any president really
2465.28s: should
2466.36s: be a little hesitant to to come in
2470.88s: especially a new president which Trump
2473.00s: would be here
2476.00s: and yeah he's got to be cognizant of
2479.16s: what has been but really he's thrust
2482.08s: into a situation of this is the way it
2484.20s: is today you know all of how we got here
2487.88s: is somewhat interesting but in reality
2491.32s: here's where we are today just like
2493.84s: trading in the now this is where we are
2497.16s: okay now that we're here what do we do
2499.48s: to get the deal done and get this done
2502.68s: with um you know and and both sides are
2506.16s: going to bring up well yeah but they did
2508.00s: this and there like a bunch of little
2509.44s: kids squabbling with each other yeah but
2512.00s: they did that and yeah they did this and
2514.44s: blah blah blah and they argue with each
2516.28s: other but reality he just needs to keep
2518.76s: focusing back on okay here's where we
2520.64s: are
2521.64s: today and here's what you need and
2525.44s: here's what you need and here's what you
2527.24s: want and what you want and let's see if
2530.08s: we can't figure out how to give as many
2532.44s: of the wants and needs on both sides and
2535.68s: where are we missing then when we get
2537.92s: all of that figured out then what do we
2541.96s: need to balance the deal and get the
2543.60s: deal
2544.56s: done interesting yeah I'm I'm really
2548.04s: curious to see if if and what that will
2550.72s: look like because yeah there's a lot of
2553.08s: different shapes and forms and I think
2554.56s: that the output of it will be pretty
2556.44s: impactful do you think that there's any
2558.80s: sort of broader Market impact from that
2562.44s: conversation so let's say that they
2564.56s: discuss a deal of struck do you think
2567.20s: that the market would have some sort of
2569.20s: reaction either way I doubt it because
2572.88s: uh if they start talking I think the
2575.44s: markets will assume that it probably is
2577.72s: going to happen sooner or later because
2579.64s: I think both parties want it and I think
2582.32s: frankly most of Europe wants it I know
2584.20s: the United States wants it the people at
2586.28s: least there seems to be some people in
2588.80s: our government right now that seem to
2590.36s: want to keep it going um I know the US
2594.12s: getting rid of sending hundreds of
2595.80s: billions over there is probably going to
2597.52s: be more money to help balance the budget
2600.32s: so that would be a useful function in
2603.20s: trying to make government more efficient
2605.80s: here uh so that I think definitely the
2608.56s: American people should be happy about
2610.92s: it uh I don't see a
2614.36s: downside yeah another question the only
2618.28s: downside would be to people who are in
2621.20s: favor of blowing up missiles and drones
2624.88s: and stuff like that so they can produce
2626.72s: more of them the military industrial
2629.68s: complex and then the other people that
2631.88s: would be happy about it keeping it going
2633.76s: would be those that are
2635.72s: involved in
2638.68s: who knows what money goes over to
2641.64s: Ukraine it gets distributed around to
2643.88s: who knows where the pentagon's lost
2646.68s: track of where it's
2648.32s: going uh who knows where where whose
2651.60s: Pockets that ends up in so yeah well
2654.96s: well I mean there's also the unfortunate
2656.48s: reality that other than the cost as a
2658.92s: country like we we do Ben the United
2661.32s: States does benefit if Russia is in
2663.84s: conflict because it gives us a ton to
2667.20s: look at from again a strategic
2669.96s: perspective I'm not advocating for it to
2671.60s: be clear I think it sucks but from a
2674.24s: from a pure agnostic point of view if
2675.88s: they're wasting money lives resources
2678.04s: material fighting this war that's really
2680.52s: not going anywhere that's no love lost
2682.60s: from us from like a a defensive
2684.28s: strategic position yeah yeah but in the
2686.88s: end in the end if we were strong
2689.12s: ourselves and not sending Munitions over
2691.92s: there out of our own
2693.56s: stockpiles we would be stronger we'd get
2696.76s: to a a point maybe where you know it's
2699.92s: interesting to know what everybody else
2701.36s: has got but we got better than they do
2704.00s: anyway so you kind of you know you're
2708.32s: not you're not too awfully not g to lose
2710.52s: sleep over it I guess it's interesting
2713.00s: to see that stuff I understand
2714.80s: strategically you're getting some
2716.12s: information but oh definitely I mean
2719.40s: probably with aerial reconnaissance and
2721.52s: lots of other you know CIA intelligence
2724.60s: and who knows what we probably uh in a
2727.08s: few uh defectors here and there you
2729.72s: probably have a sense of what's going on
2731.76s: in Russia or China and
2736.08s: um you you got to worry about what you
2739.12s: are capable of doing yourself probably
2742.00s: more than what they're doing you want to
2744.36s: make sure that you're the best you can
2745.92s: be oh sure and and I think the our
2749.20s: military is supremely competent I and I
2752.24s: I actually think another thing that we
2753.52s: are benefiting from again in an
2755.48s: unfortunate way we have a chance we're
2758.56s: testing all kinds of new Munitions and
2761.00s: technologies that have had no real
2763.04s: actual Battlefield application which
2766.20s: again it's um there's benefit to it but
2769.60s: it comes at a pretty egregious cost
2772.48s: right um another question though I had I
2774.96s: came across this the other night I I was
2776.60s: like really curious about it I didn't
2777.84s: know what to think of it but I saw Trump
2780.16s: was talking about getting rid of the
2782.28s: Department of Education and I did a
2785.04s: bunch of homework on that just because
2786.96s: is obviously you know there's people
2788.92s: that are like oh well you know he just
2790.40s: wants to make everybody dumb and it's
2791.68s: like no no he doesn't no nobody nobody
2793.56s: wants even regardless of what side
2795.92s: you're on quote unquote nobody wants our
2797.92s: kids to be dumb so it's like I I started
2801.08s: doing a bunch of homework though I'm
2802.12s: like what they do and it was really
2805.36s: fascinating because I learned a lot
2807.72s: about like their overall process the
2810.20s: allocation of funds one of the things
2812.36s: that I don't know if you know the answer
2813.48s: to this but I because I couldn't find it
2815.96s: right now lot of the the government the
2818.72s: federal funds that go to public schools
2820.84s: it's like 8 to 12% of total uh public
2823.76s: school funding that comes from the
2825.60s: federal government right now it's routed
2827.92s: through something like the
2830.20s: doe my the thing I was trying to figure
2832.40s: out is my assumption would be if doe
2835.72s: goes away those funds wouldn't
2838.48s: necessarily go away they would be like
2840.88s: redistributed in another manner but I
2842.56s: had no reference for that I don't know
2843.88s: if you know anything about that by
2845.00s: chance yeah I I happen to do I have a uh
2848.12s: perfect I have a a daughter-in-law it
2851.28s: turns out that used to be a teacher in
2854.40s: perfect school districts and thanks to
2857.56s: an advanced degree became uh a
2860.12s: specialist in reading and ended up
2862.88s: having to attend a lot of meetings and
2865.20s: what she noticed over time is as she got
2869.84s: more educated and more kind of in more
2873.20s: of an administrative type helping other
2876.00s: teachers with specializing and reading
2878.28s: and all that she noticed the meetings
2880.72s: were
2881.84s: unbelievable the
2883.56s: donuts the bureaucrats it just kept
2886.88s: growing and growing and growing and she
2890.64s: realized that she spended a lot more
2892.56s: time talking about a lot of things than
2895.08s: doing anything that directly helps a kid
2898.56s: learn how to read
2901.84s: and uh and and I think she leans more
2906.04s: liberal than conservative I doubt if she
2909.16s: voted for Trump and yet she she made the
2913.36s: statement uh that if you took the money
2916.40s: from the Department of Education and
2918.36s: just took all the money that's wasted on
2920.56s: all those bureaucrats there that then
2922.80s: decide how we're going to split the pie
2925.72s: up amongst all these school districts
2927.52s: across the whole country uh and you just
2930.24s: said okay California gets X billions and
2933.16s: New York gets X billions and their
2936.00s: individual State Department of
2937.88s: educations get to decide how to deal
2940.56s: with that they are more cognizant of
2942.96s: their needs than are the federal
2945.24s: government so you just you just directly
2948.32s: sort of short circuit this uh flow
2951.00s: through the bureaucracy and I think you
2952.48s: get a lot of more bang fre your buck and
2955.56s: I'll come back to the uh the most
2958.40s: obvious thing of all Carter put the
2960.96s: Department of Education in place it now
2964.24s: has something like is it 80 billion a
2968.04s: year budget yeah it's big and our scores
2971.56s: and our capabilities of our kids are
2974.48s: lower than they've ever been
2977.68s: so it's not working try something
2980.44s: different you got nothing to lose that'd
2983.04s: be my argument um it clearly it's it's
2986.76s: not helping yeah yeah and it's and it's
2989.84s: interesting because I I think the idea
2992.80s: and this is one of the things I was
2994.28s: arriving at last night as I was learning
2995.92s: more about the
2997.44s: um the department is that it it also
2999.88s: seems like just a larger gross number of
3003.28s: dollars obviously would be able to be
3005.68s: sent out so that not only would the
3009.04s: individual states be able to have a
3010.72s: greater impact because they know what
3012.04s: they need but they would actually have
3013.24s: more money to do it with which is kind
3015.00s: of interesting because the Department of
3016.88s: Education would not siphon off money for
3020.08s: all those bureaucrats and all their
3021.96s: little you know the the building and the
3025.68s: I you could take that build and lease it
3028.12s: or use it some other more valuable
3030.16s: purpose turn it into housing of some
3032.84s: sort for Washington DC
3035.08s: homeless whatever I mean you got to come
3037.76s: up with some more positive use for the
3041.44s: real estate and the people uh they're
3044.36s: not increasing the economy they are not
3048.44s: they are being a drag on the whole
3051.04s: system and they're not producing the
3054.36s: results in the end and I'm a big fan of
3057.36s: in general in all types of businesses
3060.44s: really
3061.96s: um military hard to do that police and
3065.48s: fire hard to do that but other than you
3068.52s: know the kind of the original scope of
3071.80s: limited government you know protecting
3073.88s: your rights and protecting the
3075.20s: boundaries of the United States the
3077.00s: minimalist approach to the federal
3079.08s: government just about everything else
3081.56s: out there if you open it up to
3084.60s: competition and good ideas I mean
3087.56s: X now is the leading platform in the
3089.80s: world being downloaded for news and all
3092.28s: that but 5 years from now some other
3094.92s: platform could come along and become the
3097.04s: new X and everybody goes there and it's
3100.84s: got XYZ and Elon has been so busy doing
3104.24s: the Doge thing that he's you know taking
3106.88s: his eye off the ball and X is no longer
3109.36s: the the darling and somebody else takes
3112.68s: uh the place of the number one app for
3114.80s: news there's always that ability and the
3117.60s: education's no different if you've got
3120.32s: uh I mean homeschooling back 30 years
3123.20s: ago when I was back in the middle of
3126.72s: trat days my head Trader actually
3130.52s: homeschooled his his kids and it was
3133.92s: kind of difficult because you know Mom
3135.72s: and Dad had to sit there and actually
3138.44s: deal with math class and geography and
3141.68s: stuff like that but nowadays there's all
3144.04s: sorts of organizations textbooks on
3146.52s: online
3147.56s: classwork
3149.44s: um leagues for
3152.44s: athletics the the homeschooler in
3154.72s: today's world has got a completely
3156.52s: different uh set of resources and
3159.52s: support groups to make it easier to do
3162.32s: that and a lot of people there's a
3164.00s: record number of people homeschooling
3165.80s: their kids now because they look at
3167.68s: what's happening over the public schools
3169.28s: and the scores keep getting lower and
3170.80s: lower and the kids keep dropping out and
3174.48s: and getting involved in violence drugs
3176.88s: and everything else they just say hey
3179.56s: this is a pretty easy decision I can do
3181.20s: it this way or I can do it that way and
3183.00s: this way seems better now Trump's
3186.44s: proposing uh school choice that makes a
3189.44s: lot of sense to me if money is going
3191.96s: into the government is coming back out
3194.64s: if I can choose where to spend it I'm
3197.12s: going to make the decision that seems
3199.24s: the best for my kids or for my family uh
3203.48s: I'm not going to put up with the
3206.68s: government deciding what's best for my
3208.76s: kids so it makes a lot of sense it's
3212.40s: more freedom loving you get bureaucrats
3215.76s: out of the way maybe you know if the
3217.96s: public schools don't tow the line and
3220.32s: get their act together maybe they go out
3223.28s: of business you know nobody wants to put
3226.52s: their kids in there anymore so they
3229.52s: disappear the teachers that want to
3231.80s: teach go work in homeschooling or they
3234.52s: go work in charter schools or or other
3237.12s: places where they can focus on
3240.60s: teaching well I'll tell you one thing if
3243.84s: I had a homeschool my kids they're in
3246.56s: trouble as soon as we get to doing
3247.92s: proofs on triangles because I don't
3250.36s: remember any of that I was just joking
3252.40s: about that I remember I had a teacher I
3253.96s: think it was like seventh grade that was
3255.20s: a real hard ass about writing in a
3257.32s: triangle as part of my proof that was a
3259.04s: big deal write in a triangle other than
3261.64s: writing in a triangle I don't remember
3263.68s: it so yeah we're we're we're in trouble
3266.60s: there we're both going to be
3268.04s: homeschooling we're going to be
3268.96s: homeschooled at the same time together
3271.28s: yeah but then there's a guy like me that
3272.88s: got a hundred on his geometry region
3275.12s: tests in New York state that might have
3278.04s: kids and you'd send your kids over to me
3280.24s: and I'd teach geometry and uh I'd send
3284.24s: my kids over to you for PE or uh perfect
3288.56s: a class in health or something like that
3291.04s: you know and you might have to have the
3293.08s: responsibility of teaching that course
3295.40s: that's good what what bunch of swole
3297.44s: martial artists so yeah I'm I'm down for
3300.04s: that hey nothing wrong with that you
3302.44s: know I think I think it's it's very
3304.68s: useful for a child in the today's world
3307.04s: and one of the things I noticed with my
3308.36s: grandchildren now I have two
3310.52s: granddaughters and uh fortunately my uh
3315.16s: the kids exposed the grandkids to as
3318.88s: many possible different things as they
3321.04s: can it it must drive their schedule nuts
3324.56s: because they're carting kids everywhere
3326.36s: Which Way but you know here's a ballet
3329.96s: class do you like that no okay how about
3332.80s: uh let's take a class in skiing how's
3335.16s: that oh that's fun uh but I don't you
3337.96s: know I just I like doing it I don't want
3339.88s: to compete in it or anything how about
3341.80s: swimming oh I think it's cool I like
3343.68s: swimming and and I like the I have some
3346.88s: girlfriends over in swimming and and uh
3349.88s: I won my last race and that was kind of
3352.00s: cool and uh I enjoy the going through
3355.44s: the water real fast or something you
3357.24s: know you never know with kids you just
3359.84s: kind of throw it out there and they
3362.60s: decide oh you know I really like writing
3364.80s: poems or I like coding on the computer
3368.00s: or whatever I think math is cool I
3370.76s: really like math you never know you just
3374.16s: have to keep exposing them and then all
3376.84s: of a sudden this profile comes out and
3378.76s: you're amazed and you think wow I didn't
3381.32s: see that coming I thought when you were
3383.04s: six you were going to be a fashion
3384.48s: designer and now you're talking about
3387.08s: mathematics being one of your favorite
3390.08s: subjects
3391.92s: wow yeah yeah so it's fun watching them
3395.72s: develop but a lot of that is just being
3397.72s: exposed to a lot of different things and
3399.44s: the world of today you know thanks to
3401.96s: the internet and all that you can get
3403.96s: exposed to a lot of different things so
3407.88s: you have to be open to allowing people
3410.08s: to reach their own potential and I think
3413.44s: that we have a more of ability in the
3414.96s: United States to allow our
3417.00s: our people individually if we keep um
3421.24s: holding on to freedom and encouraging
3424.24s: Freedom uh I think over a long run it's
3427.36s: going to be the Golden Age As Trump
3429.04s: often talks about I believe that you're
3431.16s: going to have more freedom more economy
3433.28s: more uh capability to get things done
3436.52s: capitalistic wise and I think uh that's
3439.24s: going to be good for everybody no matter
3441.48s: what party you voted
3444.04s: for last question and it actually
3446.92s: dovetails off of a lot of what you were
3448.64s: talking about the ability to to leverage
3450.64s: technology uh to gain exposure to
3452.80s: different things artificial intelligence
3455.60s: is so cool to me I I think that just the
3458.64s: potential for it is
3461.16s: incredible where do you think that that
3463.76s: goes as an industry over the next again
3466.56s: maybe a few years something like that
3467.84s: whatever time frame you you want but I'm
3469.48s: just thinking like I I view something
3471.88s: like AI in some different time frame
3474.00s: buckets right we have like early AI as
3475.72s: we're going through now then there would
3477.00s: be kind of like mid Advanced and then
3478.56s: obviously very very Advanced so for kind
3481.24s: of the early AI what are some of the
3483.44s: capabilities and just impact that you
3485.16s: see for that well at the stage we're at
3488.28s: right now I like to refer to it as a
3491.24s: fancy Google search back in the day 20
3494.56s: 30 years ago you put in one word in a
3496.92s: Google Search and you got some citations
3499.64s: back that were part of the database
3502.88s: where the the Bots had gone through for
3505.16s: Google and looked at a lot of different
3507.12s: web pages and decided that through
3509.80s: keywords or tags or words used in titles
3513.76s: of articles that here's a couple pages
3517.88s: of your search results based on that one
3520.56s: word you just put in there and then
3522.68s: there was rules that you could put two
3524.28s: words and you could separate them by
3526.00s: commas or with a plus or whatever you
3528.16s: wanted you know there was all sorts of
3530.52s: search capabilities well now with AI
3533.80s: it's more like Alexa
3536.60s: uh you know set the timer for 40
3539.68s: minutes and Alexa knows can interpret
3543.20s: your words understand the sentence know
3546.32s: that you're talking about a timer so
3547.96s: you're timing something set it for 40
3550.76s: minutes and then beep at you when it's
3554.32s: you know time to to do whatever it was
3556.76s: that you wanted to do um even more so
3561.00s: now you can say and I'm sure elon's
3563.28s: going to be doing this with v on the
3565.48s: Doge thing
3567.40s: they're going to take a whole lot of
3569.12s: financial records and they're going to
3571.60s: have an AI engine read those financial
3575.28s: records and they're going to look at
3577.72s: government statistics they're going to
3579.52s: look at headcounts they're going to look
3581.44s: at lease expense office space etc etc
3586.04s: lots and lots of information and they're
3588.56s: going to ask the question of
3591.28s: AI where's the lwh hanging fruit what do
3594.20s: we go after first Department of
3596.88s: Education or Department of energy
3600.08s: department or the the justice department
3602.56s: or you know what out of all of this what
3606.32s: is money being spent on that has the
3608.48s: least economic benefit coming back so
3612.76s: that's a pretty complex thing for a
3614.44s: human brain to figure out there's some
3616.40s: lwh hanging fruit you could obviously
3618.56s: get rid of the what's the effect of coke
3621.72s: on Quail you know Quail ingesting Coke
3627.24s: um yeah I don't think I need to know
3629.40s: that with my taxpayer dollars you know
3631.44s: those would be some simple things you
3632.84s: could do but that's not going to get you
3635.52s: two trillion you're going to have to go
3638.08s: after a lot of deeply entrenched stuff
3641.36s: that's just not being effective and
3643.16s: you're going to have to measure a lot of
3645.48s: variables that almost gets beyond the
3647.32s: human mind so they're going to be those
3649.12s: types of uh issues as you get more and I
3652.56s: call that a little bit getting more into
3654.44s: the intermediate
3656.76s: AI now
3659.00s: ultimately you're going to ask AI to
3661.76s: design AI you know you're gonna try to
3664.92s: take it to another whole level getting
3666.80s: meta here and that that gets to be a
3670.76s: science fiction novel and hopefully with
3673.56s: a good ending not a bad ending uh but
3676.80s: you I think that's some of the concerns
3679.00s: that people like Elon has when you look
3681.88s: at that level and AI is designing AI how
3685.60s: do you keep it within the
3687.92s: rails uh so in other words how do you
3690.32s: keep it um friendly to humanity as one
3694.32s: of its prime directives as they to coin
3696.88s: a term from Star Trek days the prime
3699.68s: directive to always you know to protect
3703.00s: human life and as as a prime
3705.96s: directive uh and I think
3708.92s: that you know I guess there's going to
3711.72s: be nefarious people maybe China and who
3714.68s: knows that will just ignore that and do
3716.84s: whatever they want and then there'll be
3719.16s: other more ethical AI Generations that
3723.72s: uh come out with limitations on what
3725.64s: they do but no end in sight for what the
3728.80s: AI could dream that it could do by
3732.12s: pulling all these different things
3733.60s: together
3735.00s: so I think I I see a positive effect I
3738.24s: see it being make it a more efficient
3740.48s: economy more efficient
3742.40s: manufacturing more efficient I already
3744.68s: see lots of different aspects of
3746.92s: technology in terms of uh even keeping
3750.76s: track of at standpoint funds which I'm
3754.08s: the chairman of here in Scottdale it's a
3756.76s: mutual fund that trades 75 alternative
3760.24s: markets and and a bunch of equity
3762.40s: exposure as well all in the one mutual
3765.00s: fund is done very well it's over a
3767.32s: billion and fiveyear track record very
3769.92s: very nice
3771.92s: however um trying to keep track of all
3774.92s: of the various marketing channels and
3778.60s: clients and all of this stuff requires
3781.32s: some pretty interesting software right
3784.44s: it's Way Beyond anything that I ever had
3787.16s: back in the day at trenet uh trying to
3790.60s: Market my measly little uh $600 million
3794.60s: uh money management firm back in the day
3796.88s: 20 years ago so you know the world
3799.80s: marches on there's lots of new
3802.04s: technologies and capabilities back when
3804.44s: I started there was no there was no
3806.56s: internet basically I didn't have the
3808.16s: worldwide web I couldn't talk to a Tom
3811.04s: baso as a mentor of some sort or have an
3814.20s: interview with with some of the big uh
3816.84s: money managers back in those days I
3819.28s: maybe read a Wall Street Journal article
3821.64s: about them or I could speculate or read
3824.44s: a book on them or something like that
3827.12s: but I didn't get to talk to him so you
3829.36s: had to dream up your own ways of
3831.88s: creating what it is that you were going
3833.36s: to trade and how you're going to protect
3834.84s: your position side in and you just had
3837.36s: to use your own math skills and
3839.08s: capabilities to figure it out on your
3840.96s: own and um fortunately I waited through
3845.36s: all that over the last 50 years but
3849.16s: nowadays gez there's so much re there so
3851.88s: many resources it's almost confusing
3853.80s: it's almost the opposite you have so
3856.08s: many people who do you believe who do
3858.52s: you want to talk to who which book do
3861.20s: you want to read there's too many of
3863.72s: them you know it's yeah it's that that's
3867.32s: the craziest part too because when I
3869.28s: started trading in ' 07 obviously
3871.40s: trading had come a long way by that
3873.20s: point clearly but like it still wasn't
3876.44s: what it is now and I it's the the
3879.48s: problem set is fascinating because when
3881.40s: I when I first started there was a
3882.76s: handful of like books on options and
3884.48s: derivatives there's not a bunch and now
3886.84s: it's unlimited so it's very much
3888.80s: information overload it seems but you
3891.44s: touched on a lot of really cool Parts
3894.04s: about Ai and actually some of the
3895.72s: elements that I'm so excited for is like
3898.40s: how multivariate it can become in how
3901.04s: many different levels of Industry
3903.92s: business economy that it can impact
3906.12s: which would be really cool to really
3907.88s: cool to check out so I appreciate your
3909.40s: thoughts on it Eric I would I would
3911.44s: caution Traders which you know probably
3914.32s: Traders are going to be more watching
3916.24s: this than any other group in the country
3919.44s: uh out there and I would caution Traders
3922.16s: though from an AI
3923.80s: standpoint I would almost call that over
3927.88s: optimizing history because AI is
3930.32s: naturally going to go off of data data
3933.32s: is going to have to be historical data
3936.76s: price moves that happen economic data
3939.40s: that comes in whatever uh pieces of data
3942.92s: the AI can come up with the AI cannot
3945.60s: come up
3946.68s: with necessarily opinions what they'll
3949.68s: do is they'll correlate all this stuff
3951.88s: based on what's happened in the past and
3954.52s: they will over optimize the heck out of
3956.96s: it and say you should be going long now
3959.20s: because of the following reasons and by
3963.24s: the same token if you take a simulation
3965.48s: platform and I've done this I I'm
3967.84s: absolutely positive that this is the
3969.56s: case and you over optimize you run it
3972.12s: like a thousand cases and you vary the
3974.64s: parameter from 0.1 to point uh 0.1 to
3979.64s: 1.0 by uh 0.01s or something and then
3985.40s: you have another variable and you change
3987.88s: those and you increment those and you'd
3989.76s: run every possible one of the 1,000
3992.56s: cases and then you say ah you know case
3995.08s: number
3996.12s: 537 made the most money in history so
3999.12s: that's the way I'm going to trade the
4001.64s: mark the market will never do that again
4004.64s: ever in your lifetime and just fully
4009.32s: over I did all this great work what the
4011.72s: heck happened and I I worry that AI will
4014.96s: tend to give you similar types of
4017.16s: answers so be careful on how you use it
4019.48s: it's a it's a
4021.24s: tool uh I think if you're trying to look
4023.60s: for tradeoffs and scenario uh analysis
4029.00s: and what some of the possibilities would
4030.72s: be maybe you could use it for that you
4033.36s: certainly can use it to to do screenings
4036.00s: of vast quantities of information and
4038.92s: you know say something like give me the
4041.68s: the 10 worst uh one-year periods for the
4045.56s: S&P 500 over the last 100 years well
4048.60s: then it can go back and find that and
4051.20s: return it if you ask it to then say well
4054.96s: given where we are right now should I be
4057.28s: buying or selling that's another whole
4060.16s: problem that's a different I think you
4063.16s: you're G to end up as a Trader having to
4064.80s: make that decision
4066.32s: yourself and it it adds a new paradigm
4069.92s: too because a lot of edge historically
4072.72s: used to come from information scarcity
4075.08s: in the people that would pay to acquire
4076.68s: the information and then create things
4079.20s: and now I actually think that there's
4080.68s: going to be a pretty profound impact
4082.60s: yeah exactly almost go the other way
4084.96s: people will be so drowned in information
4087.84s: and so over optimized on history that
4090.92s: they'll lose sight of the forest for the
4092.92s: trees and end up in the middle of all
4096.16s: this noise trying to make sense of it
4099.20s: all and I'll be sitting here with my
4101.24s: long-term 21-day indicators in boring
4104.76s: fashion doing my work like in 40 minutes
4108.36s: every
4109.40s: afternoon and just kind of yawning at
4112.56s: all this nonsense that goes on that I
4114.72s: just
4115.92s: ignore and it's like the world has
4118.64s: passed me by in a way but in a good way
4122.20s: I have just stuck to what I do and I'm
4124.92s: sort of outside all the nonsense that
4127.40s: goes on and uh keeps my life pretty easy
4132.24s: well I think that's also one of the
4133.28s: beauties of building the the opposite of
4136.04s: an overfit right and a robust approach
4139.16s: that allows us to to generally persist
4142.20s: so yeah yeah I love that I'm gonna catch
4145.60s: every move of Coco for instance we
4147.64s: started thetion about my number one
4150.08s: position profitability wise today coffee
4153.16s: is number two I guess no uh corn is
4156.60s: number two to the downside coffee's
4158.40s: number three um but you
4163.60s: know the the all of those have broken
4167.32s: out of sideways periods and are now on a
4170.16s: big Trend I'll catch every one of them
4172.28s: with what I'm doing right my indicators
4174.96s: will always pick those up because I'm a
4177.96s: trend follower so it's sooner or later
4180.28s: whether it's a short-term indicator will
4181.76s: go over quicker long-term want to go
4183.68s: over a little later eventually if it's a
4186.88s: big move they're all going to go over in
4188.68s: the direction that I want them to go
4190.08s: over and I'm going to make money on that
4191.92s: big run and I just do one of those every
4196.24s: quarter or half a year and it probably
4198.16s: pays my way because I make so much off
4200.76s: of that that you know all the rest of
4202.56s: the stuff just adds up to nothing or
4205.84s: chump change it really doesn't make that
4207.52s: much difference it's a lot of work to
4208.92s: get nowhere but you got to be on on
4211.20s: those big Runners that's the key right
4214.28s: right yeah Tom always awesome catching
4217.68s: up get a chance to learn a lot and
4219.72s: understand things for walking through a
4220.84s: lot of your perspective just on where
4222.76s: the market is today because we're we're
4224.60s: in a weird time and I think that yeah I
4228.04s: think the next uh 12 to 18 months are
4230.80s: going to be interesting to watch so
4233.52s: people can get a hold of you at enjoy
4235.72s: the ride.or I'll include that link in
4238.40s: the notes below but anywhere else that
4240.36s: you want to send people that's the
4241.72s: website uh most of the people that
4243.84s: follow me out of all the social media
4245.92s: seem to be on X and that's e it's baso B
4251.44s: oore Tom got it that's simple if it's
4255.00s: any anything other than that you got an
4257.08s: impostor and I get one a week so be
4259.96s: careful out there uh yeah and I'll I'll
4262.36s: grab the correct link and I'll throw
4263.80s: that in the notes as well for everybody
4265.36s: so that they are directed to the I'm
4267.08s: also on Facebook and Linkedin and Truth
4269.92s: social
4271.36s: and um I forget where I I have
4275.64s: a what do you call substack articles
4279.00s: that I write every now and again there's
4280.52s: some interesting stuff there if people
4282.16s: are interested in reading some of my
4284.12s: substack pieces um it's mostly on
4287.40s: trading or life uh attitude psychology
4291.64s: of trading that type of stuff so for a
4294.68s: Trader there might be some interesting
4296.16s: stuff in there for people but um there's
4298.56s: lots of ways you can get a hold of me
4300.68s: beautiful well yeah Tom thanks for
