0.00s: What's up, everyone? Happy Monday. We're going to do a quick recap here. I specifically just
5.20s: want to take a look at CrowdStrike in GameStop in this video because we have the YouTube live
10.00s: session later today to drive into the broader markets because there's a lot going on for
15.28s: us to take a look at. So let's pivot away from all this noise and let's take a look at CrowdStrike
21.12s: first really quick. And boom, there it is. I had a short on in there today because it just
28.24s: gaped down and I did not see that getting better. It was a very basic thesis about it is basic
35.04s: as you could possibly get bad news. And with a gap down on top of that, it just looked like the
41.52s: sellers were coming out and they did. If you take a look at this volume candle behind my head
45.52s: right here, this volume candle was 90% sale volume. There was just nobody wanting to step
51.04s: in front of this thing and that's really what led to this big red candle all the way down.
56.40s: So this I surprised me a little bit. It looked like it was starting to mellow out especially
61.92s: because we had the candle come down. Touching the 200 is whatever I guess it's something I don't
67.28s: care so much about that. It's just the fact that there was a candle because what that tells me
70.48s: like this WIC because it tells me that people were still selling selling selling and then sooner or
74.88s: later somebody started buying right. That's what moved it back up. So the fact that it went down
81.28s: here and then moved back up, it indicated to me that people might be willing to start buying this
87.36s: thing. And then today just nope, gap down all the way down and notice how little tiny this WIC is.
93.12s: This is just massive sale volume all day. Not a lot of people wanting to transact in there.
99.84s: So what does this mean? Well, this is why when I talked about this over this past weekend,
104.32s: I set two alerts to the upside and downside and I specifically said, I'll trade at either
109.20s: direction. I don't care. I still think this move is probably overdone when we finish getting the
115.36s: news. I think the reason why it's not overdone right now is because the market is still synthesizing
119.36s: the impact and the overall severity of things which clearly we don't have a firm grasp on just yet.
126.32s: So that's that interesting. Now let's pivot over to GameStop because there were a couple
132.72s: of people that hit me up today asking about a bunch of put volume in the stock and it looks like
140.16s: folks were seeing a lot of put sales is what they tell me. So I thought we could take a
145.60s: investigative look together and see what's going on in here. So let's dive right in. The first
151.20s: thing I noticed is we're still so range bound. We have this low over here, which is not using the
160.96s: WIC using the body. The body of this is somewhere around like 23 and a quarter, something like that.
166.32s: And then to the upside, again, just using the body is not the WICs. It's like 2850, something like
172.16s: that. So we're just so range bound in here. And we're seeing a little bit of life just in terms
179.92s: of upward pressure. But if you take a look at the candle today, it's still not super bullish.
186.24s: So it was 48% sale volume today. So what this tells me is that there are still people trying to
194.80s: fade this, but there are just a slight, slight edge in people wanting to buy it, which I do find
201.68s: interesting. I also find interesting that it crossed over slash under on the CCI. I'll get myself
207.60s: out of the way real fast so you could see right there's the CCI. I don't care a ton again about
213.76s: technical analysis in this specific product because it is so different in how it behaves. I see
219.12s: people say all the time like, Oh, it respects this perfectly. And it's like, no, it doesn't man.
223.84s: Like it doesn't that's why it does this is because it does other stuff. So the main thing I'm
231.68s: trying to emphasize is when you're looking at something whose price behavior is not solely
237.36s: determined by whether or not people are valuing the company higher than they did yesterday, there are
243.04s: other forces at play. And it's important to acknowledge that because if the idea here is that
248.32s: you can run technical analysis in here, like standard technical analysis, like you're you're going
253.04s: to have a hard time. You're going to have a really hard time moving and playing with this thing
257.20s: because the other thing like just from a general price movement perspective, something to go from
262.32s: essentially all the way down here to shoot up to this. It's like that's an abnormal movement.
267.92s: It's what makes it so cool. So I would just encourage people to keep an open mind when it comes to
273.12s: looking at the product. You'll see that I still overlay some level of technical analysis, but it's
277.44s: a sliding scale. If I'm trading something like this is compared to the indices, the weight that I'm
283.12s: going to apply on technical analysis is going to be completely different rightfully so because they
287.76s: behave very differently. So let's take a look at these options chains. The first thing I noticed is
293.36s: that volume today was heavy, but light. Here's what I mean. From an overall volume perspective,
299.92s: we're just under 200,000 contracts. That's relatively light for GameStop. It's heavy in the sense that
306.48s: this 200,000 call volume was opposed by just 46,000 puts. So really big call skew volume on the day,
318.00s: and we're back at it yet again with the majority of this being for this coming Friday.
326.72s: I've learned one of my favorite sayings that they use that you guys use in the the aid community,
331.44s: which I'm continually just loving learning about, but they'll say that it's always tomorrow.
338.48s: I actually love that so much. We use similar sayings in the military. We'll say things like the
343.20s: easiest day was yesterday and bullshit like that, but it reminds me of that, or it's just like it's
348.80s: always tomorrow because I mean, this is just a lot of volume for a seemingly quieter period.
357.76s: But again, that's what makes this thing so interesting is that a quiet period could be quickly not
361.84s: a quiet period. To prove that point and to provide the counter to my own statement there,
368.72s: this was a real quiet period. It had a high of 15, a low of 10, and it was just kind of
373.68s: training around in here. And then all of a sudden, it was no longer quiet, like pretty quick.
378.24s: So I understand that. Now again, the way I would structure my trades and a lot of stuff is very,
382.96s: very different, but that doesn't matter. So let's take a look instead at some of this open
389.92s: interest now where we're starting to see more call, oh, I building out still as a waste to go
396.08s: in order to get to like it's at least two times put a lie, right? So the put a lie on this right
402.16s: now is 37, I'm sorry, 371,000 compared to 622 K on the call side. So this isn't the same ratio.
410.64s: We've seen previously when it starts getting like super, super bullish. Now let's take a look at
414.72s: the time and sales and see if we can find the series of put trades that people are talking about.
418.96s: People are saying that there's a bunch of like bullish put trades that come out. So the first
423.68s: thing I'm going to do is kill off these spreads. I don't really care to see spreads in this context.
428.48s: So I nuked those. The next thing is I'm looking at both calls and puts both buys and sales in here.
435.36s: And there are different ways we can filter this. So what I'm going to do is start by filtering
442.08s: and looking at just the put side to see if I can find where all these puts were coming in. So
446.96s: here's one block right here that I can see clear as day. So these, the market was 162 by 182. So
454.80s: this came technically towards the mid of that market, but it's closer to the bid side. So this
461.28s: tells me that looks like a sale that looks like somebody sold 847 of the 25 puts expiring into
468.08s: all that's what that looks like to me. And you can run through and do that kind of analysis all
473.44s: the way through here. So in this case, for the 26 July expiration, the 24 and a half puts,
480.80s: these look like somebody bought them because the market was 59 by 66. These came in at 66. That's
488.16s: looks like a purchase trade. Now again, the kind of syntax that thinkorswim uses if it's red,
495.12s: it's telling you that it likely was sold. And then if it is green, it likely was bought.
503.04s: So if we sort these by quantity to kind of see where the bigger trades came in, I don't see
509.44s: this giant sale volume that people were alluding to. I do see sales for sure, but I also see a lot
516.40s: buying of puts. So all I'm kind of pulling away with here is that this doesn't look conclusive to
522.64s: me either way that there is massive, massive, massive amounts of one or the other. It looks like a
527.44s: bit of a mixed bag. Now to get a cleaner view, we can take a look at something like this from our
533.44s: buddies over unusual whales, which they have a need or tool, right? It's just cleaner to see.
539.92s: And we can take a look. We want to see instances where we transacted at the bid and we want it just
545.76s: for the puts and we want it for today, which is what this is looking at. And there is a couple big
550.48s: trades. No doubt. So we have out in 2026, two of them. And that's important to know. So we have the,
561.84s: what are these? The 120's and the 125's out in 2026. We're the more near term into August. We have
573.28s: the 25's. So these are big, but not crazy, not absolutely insane for what we've seen. Now if we
581.28s: open this up to take a look at the premium that's been transacted in here, it's a little bit of
586.32s: a different story because I actually see another thing that's way more interesting to me, which is
591.36s: this. Take a look at that. That is a series of calls out in 2025 and 2026. So these are long dated,
601.44s: kind of boring for the near term stuff. But take a look at this. They're getting punched in
606.24s: relatively consistent timing, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, all at the 20's. And they're bringing in
615.20s: a lot of money. So this is somebody that's selling calls. They sold 463,000 there,
621.52s: four hundred six. Like this is a ton of money that they brought in. This here's
627.20s: easily over $3 million worth of premium, especially if this is also the same person, which I
632.64s: probably would guess it is. So these 20's got cracked with a ton, a ton of short premium that somebody
644.72s: with a pretty big position is building this up. So if we have 500, 500 contracts,
652.56s: that gives us 50,000 shares times one, two, three, four, five, six, we'll start there.
661.04s: That gives us 300,000 shares right there. Then we have essentially, let's call it another
670.16s: 50, 100. I mean, this is a pretty massive position is kind of what this boils down to. I'm
680.48s: probably seeing something to the tune I'm guessing of like maybe four hundred thousand shares a
684.88s: little over that, especially because I just noticed it goes even further down here that they were
689.44s: that they were still hitting these. Now, this is a really, really interesting trade to me.
695.44s: Because from me, from a trading perspective, the prospect of selling premium that's all the way
701.12s: out there in 2025 is fascinating. The reason why it's fascinating is because it doesn't move that much.
708.08s: So if we go out here to 17, Jan 25, I think that's one of those work, right? Does 17, Jan's?
715.76s: This one. Okay, or no window. One sec. There it is. There it is. A little bit of a delay. Yeah, 17,
723.28s: Jan 25's. So as I look at those, I look at the 20's, they're in the money. So that's good from
732.24s: a perspective of essentially hedging a potential downside. So if you have a really big position
737.68s: and you want to hedge some of the downside, you can sell those calls in the money because if they fall
742.48s: out of the money, you've made a ton of money. Now, the other interesting thing that I find about
748.32s: these 20's is if you look at the theta, they're getting two pennies a day. It's just not that much money,
754.80s: especially if they had instead came into something even as close as the 25's, but like the 32's,
760.16s: 39's, even the 60's. If we take a look at something like those 20's, there's still at least
765.68s: to add an extra penny a day, which might not sound like a lot, but on a position that size,
769.20s: it's actually quite meaningful. And 60 days within 60 days is right as theta decay starts to really
774.24s: accelerate. So that position is very interesting to me. And that looks like somebody building a
780.16s: position that has a lot of shares because that's the reason why these would be sold in my opinion
786.40s: is against shares. They could be sold naked, definitely. To me, that would be madness, especially
795.52s: on something that can move the way that this thing does to sell those in the money. I would say that
799.92s: this is far more indicative of somebody who has shares that they would not mind selling at 20 if
805.20s: they had to. And they're collecting a bunch of money to do it. That's what that is. Now from
812.56s: the other trade that I saw today that was really interesting was the 362 lot at the 20's. Again,
820.16s: same expiration. This is out though in 2026. And these came in at the offers to somebody bought
827.12s: these and they bought almost $500,000 worth of this position. So there's a lot of big volume coming
834.40s: into this thing. If you take a look at the premium that's being transacted and remember the last
838.88s: couple of times I showed you this, we see like a handful, maybe 10, 12 positions with total premium
843.52s: above $100,000. Now if you take a look at this, it's literally this whole entire top of the screen
848.56s: that's above $100,000. Now if we limit this specifically to people that are buying calls,
854.32s: you'll see that it's slower. We do have that giant half a million dollar position. But beyond that,
860.40s: it's much slower. So this to me looks like people settling in not necessarily playing these really
866.64s: short term giant upside moves, but moving around established positions. That's my best guess as it
873.04s: sits right now. We'll see. As always, we'll see. It's fun to keep an eye on this. It's fun to see
877.76s: where it goes. If there's ever anything you want me to take a look at, let's boy, no, I love looking
882.00s: at this stuff being outlier. I'll see you guys later.
