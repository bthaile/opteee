0.12s: trading options can be incredibly
2.60s: lucrative however if you're anything
4.40s: like me when I first started I just kind
6.72s: of started trading and unfortunately
9.44s: that led to a bunch of wasted time and
11.92s: effort so the goal of this video is to
13.60s: share nine questions I would ask myself
16.84s: if I were to start trading options all
19.16s: over again and no this isn't to confirm
21.84s: whether or not options are right for me
24.04s: to trade because they are it's to make
26.72s: sure that I'm going down the right path
28.80s: because it is so easy easy not to Let's
32.04s: dig right in taking a look at the first
35.08s: three this first question is no mistake
38.56s: do you understand the trouble that
39.92s: you're in and it sounds a little
41.52s: dramatic but here is the long and short
44.60s: of it the vast majority of Traders fail
47.44s: we know this there's all different kinds
48.84s: of statistics on it you can find a lot
50.80s: of data on it on my website here are a
53.00s: list of studies that you can check out
54.96s: that report the behavior and the results
57.52s: of most Traders so why do I bring this
60.20s: up if I already know that I want to
62.20s: trade but I know that a lot of people
64.88s: fail at it well two reasons the first
66.80s: one is in order to succeed at something
68.64s: that's incredibly difficult you have to
70.80s: understand how difficult it is so that
73.36s: you can then conduct the proper
76.12s: preparation in order to succeed in it
78.88s: the same thing if you go through any
80.60s: sort of harder military training course
83.28s: if you just show up and hope it's going
84.80s: to go okay without doing all of the
86.60s: physical requirements ahead of time to
88.44s: make sure that you're ready to to go
90.28s: through that training there's a good
91.92s: chance you fail the other thing is
94.36s: trading has a remarkably low barrier to
98.28s: entry so if you think about being a
100.52s: professional athlete you've probably
102.08s: played your whole life you played in all
103.56s: different kinds of leagues you probably
104.84s: done really well had a lot of coaching
106.44s: yada y y in trading none of that it is
109.52s: literally sign on to a website open up
112.68s: rage account put some money and you are
114.36s: now a Trader that's it there's nobody
117.48s: looking at anything you do which is is
120.12s: both the beauty but a lot of people's
122.88s: destruction is having complete and utter
125.80s: autonomy because everything that happens
127.64s: as a Trader is only one person's fault
132.68s: our own so that's the trouble that we're
135.28s: in you're interfacing with a very
137.04s: difficult system with absolutely no
139.68s: structure around it it's actually one of
141.20s: the beautiful things about the outlier
142.88s: Community which you should check out the
144.64s: link in the Discord below link to the
147.04s: Discord below and you can join the free
149.24s: side the paid either or but that's the
151.44s: whole idea is to help people add some
153.32s: structure to this stuff okay so the next
156.32s: question I have for us once we
159.12s: understand that this is difficult it's
161.00s: easy to mess up but it's worthwhile
163.44s: we're understanding The Challenge here
165.48s: the next thing we need to do is level
167.20s: set on goals because how often have you
169.44s: heard something like I just want $100 a
172.32s: day doesn't sound too crazy especially
174.96s: if you have the average trading account
177.44s: which is 5,500 bucks according to the
179.48s: bank for international settlements that
181.28s: seems okay but if you actually look at
183.28s: the percent return it's
185.44s: 72,1 190% return pretty damn good now
189.40s: for context to be clear my return uh
192.40s: from 2018 to 22 was 24.6% on average and
197.68s: my compound annual growth rate from 2007
200.80s: is in the 20% range and this is
203.84s: 72190 apparently I have a lot of work to
207.12s: do really the point being is people can
209.76s: per way better than me to be clear and a
211.40s: lot of people should I've approached
212.76s: trading very specifically with the
214.84s: intent of doing well but consistently
217.40s: I've only had two down years my first
219.04s: two and both of them are less than 5%
221.20s: draw Downs so yeah I have a different
223.96s: objective but the point I'm trying to
225.92s: make is that a lot of people get into
228.08s: this with the idea of making a small
231.56s: amount of money they're taught not to be
232.88s: greedy they think they're doing that but
234.96s: once you actually start looking at the
236.32s: numbers a little bit you're like okay
237.92s: you're actually setting yourself up for
239.92s: failure right from the jump so you have
241.96s: to answer this question before you move
243.84s: on to the next three why are you
246.00s: different what are you going to do
248.96s: different than all of these people what
251.40s: are you going to do different than the
253.60s: 90% plus group of people that try to do
257.24s: this and fail and it can't be something
259.04s: as simple as I'm going to try hard I'm
261.00s: going to study hard lots of them do that
263.28s: you have to go further than that and one
265.12s: of the things I want you to start
266.60s: thinking about now is what are the
268.76s: qualities you have personally that can
272.84s: help you gain an edge in the markets so
275.92s: when I think about myself specifically
278.68s: I'm not that gifted with math I didn't
280.84s: come for money so I didn't have some big
282.44s: Bank role to start with so what were the
285.24s: things I had in my favor I'm incredibly
288.92s: organized so as I go through my trading
292.04s: career I spend a lot of time tracking
294.44s: things that create a feedback loop so
297.08s: you'll see some of that later in here
298.84s: the other thing is once I start
301.24s: something and I'm interested in it I
303.96s: tend to become obsessive and I use this
306.12s: metric all the time it's actually higher
307.52s: than this now obviously but I've spent
309.32s: over 30,000 hours looking at these
312.24s: things and the reason why that matters
314.64s: is because taking the time to learn the
317.20s: products and to learn what this is is
319.24s: not easy it's all delayed gratification
321.96s: it's your first 5 years your first eight
324.52s: years you're not going to see much you
326.48s: might trade really well you might be
328.08s: growing your money but if you're like me
329.96s: and you start without a lot of money
331.44s: even if you have a great return it's not
333.48s: going to move the line really that much
335.80s: as a gross dollar amount so you have to
338.60s: think about you what are you really good
340.76s: at are you good at pattern recognition
342.68s: do you see things over time and you can
344.56s: start to catch patterns that continue to
346.88s: reoccur you'll find that in the market
348.60s: all the time are you really good at
350.40s: being objective with yourself we'll get
352.64s: into that a little bit later but one of
354.76s: the biggest downfalls Traders have is
356.52s: literally the inability to control
358.48s: themselves and that's a massive draw
360.52s: down so think about that as we proceed
362.68s: forward what are you good at and how
365.24s: does that make you different than most
367.24s: people who try this and fail next three
369.92s: questions you probably caught some of
371.76s: this from what I was just talking about
373.48s: but how serious are you about doing this
376.28s: because a lot of people will start
377.56s: trading like I'll just throw some money
379.36s: in and see how it goes and it's gone
382.64s: it's fine you could do that it does like
385.00s: okay but trading especially as a wealth
388.24s: development vehicle is a terrible hobby
391.64s: because you have to wear so many hats as
395.60s: an individual retail Trader you have to
398.76s: research things you have to be a data
400.72s: analyst to look through a bunch of data
402.76s: you have to be a technical analyst to be
404.60s: able to look at charts you also have to
406.60s: be your own counselor and psychologist
409.92s: because guess what out of all of the
412.12s: people that interact with the stock
413.64s: market we all have access to the same
416.88s: information you have access to the same
419.20s: information I do yet 90% plus of Traders
423.28s: fail within 5 years I haven't I've
426.00s: obviously outperformed the market for
427.64s: that time frame is it because I have
429.00s: better tools better information no so
431.44s: what does it come down to it comes down
433.32s: to the way that I manage myself the way
436.20s: I understand myself and the way that I'm
439.08s: able to Bear myself to myself what I
441.88s: mean by that is we have an ego and it's
444.40s: very difficult to manage the ego and it
446.36s: leads to things like the disposition
448.08s: effect where we take winning trades down
451.20s: too fast because we want to realize the
453.20s: gain and then we let losing trades run
455.84s: because we don't want to realize loss I
457.48s: know that's a thing so I've created
459.36s: systems that allow me to control that
461.96s: and limit my ability to sabotage myself
464.88s: the point being is if you are going to
466.96s: be a Trader there's nobody looking over
469.48s: your shoulder telling you to be honest
471.72s: telling you to do the hard work it's all
474.08s: on you not a good hobby it's a great way
476.04s: to lose a lot of money so speaking of
478.44s: losing money how do you on making it a
480.36s: lot of Traders just think that if I
481.56s: start trading options it'll make money
483.48s: it's not how it works you have to Define
485.84s: what I like to call a money Mak
487.64s: mechanism I have an entire video on this
489.40s: I'll link to that in the notes below but
491.32s: you have to figure out options are just
493.04s: a vehicle there's something we can trade
495.76s: their uh type of security SO trading
498.92s: options doesn't equal making money you
501.88s: have to figure out what is the money
503.60s: making are you going to be good at
504.96s: trading directionally are you good at
507.04s: finding breakouts are you good at
509.00s: finding that have increasing volume and
511.24s: institutional support and you're able to
512.84s: follow that are you able to analyze
515.84s: broad Market data sets and find
518.40s: inefficiencies like variance risk
520.44s: premiums that you can capitalize on
523.16s: they're all out there they exist it's
524.96s: one of the beautiful things about being
526.12s: a retail Trader is you get to check
527.96s: about a lot of different boxes and find
529.68s: what works for you but simply trading
531.88s: options is not a way that you make money
533.68s: actually for most people for being
535.04s: honest it's a way to lose money why
536.84s: haven't you started a trading plan and
538.52s: trading log this is is simple if you
540.72s: haven't done them do them I have a video
542.84s: in the notes that will walk through both
544.60s: of them in depth but as you notice you
547.68s: have to do a lot of things the idea that
549.84s: you're going to be able to do all of
551.32s: those things and just memorize it really
553.72s: organized in your mind and perform well
556.36s: is wild even if over time you don't
560.44s: really refer to your trading plan all
562.04s: the time I don't but going through the
564.72s: exercise of building it is so important
567.80s: last three questions are you familiar
569.68s: with the done and Krueger effect because
571.08s: you have to be here it is it's
573.84s: essentially this cycle that we go
576.16s: through where in the beginning you don't
579.32s: know anything and you know you don't
580.84s: know anything then you go through three
582.80s: or four really hard intensive years of
585.12s: learning and you think you know what's
587.72s: going on fortunately we don't my Dunning
590.80s: Krueger effect essentially occurred
592.52s: after four years of trading that's where
594.04s: I had the largest percent draw down on
595.76s: my portfolio that sends you down here
598.20s: you've just now real realized that
600.88s: I have a long way to go you have a
602.44s: choice now do you do the learning and if
605.08s: so after average 10,000 hours which if
609.52s: you want to break that down that means
611.32s: you spend 5 hours every single day for 5
614.80s: and A2 years without missing a single
616.68s: day that'll put you just over this
618.20s: 10,000 hour mark to give you an idea of
620.68s: how long this takes in order to develop
623.00s: the skill set if you're not ready to
625.56s: just say yep suck it up buttercup we got
628.20s: to get through this and I think I can
630.24s: this isn't for you it's like if you
632.12s: start training Jiu-Jitsu if you start
634.44s: training Jiu-Jitsu and your goal is to
635.72s: be a black belt within 3 years it's not
638.16s: happening it's literally not happening
640.84s: it takes too long so what does that mean
642.88s: well maybe you still want your black Bel
644.52s: and that's a longer term goal and you're
646.04s: committed to that longer term goal but
648.08s: you learn to prioritize smaller
651.12s: processes along the way and you break it
654.52s: up into smaller chunks and then you
656.28s: start working last two questions how
658.52s: will you keep yourself honest right here
661.04s: trading plan and your trading log that's
663.52s: how whether we acknowledge it or not
666.52s: going back to one of the many hats we
668.60s: have to acknowledge and wear one of them
671.12s: is psychologist and if you think about
673.88s: our behaviors as humans we get away with
676.72s: doing a lot of mental manipulations in
679.32s: order to save our ego or in order to
681.72s: save discomfort however if that's your
684.64s: disposition trading is going to be very
686.32s: difficult you have to get comfortable
687.40s: being uncomfortable pretty regularly so
690.20s: the easiest way to make sure that you're
692.52s: doing the hard work that you're
694.20s: accomplishing what you're setting out to
696.24s: is to document what you're doing and
698.72s: then the last thing without this none of
701.76s: this matters because you're going to go
703.44s: through this phase you're going to have
705.28s: really bad draw Downs you're going to
706.84s: get really tired of looking at this for
709.72s: 5 years in a row and still not seeing
711.68s: the exact results that you want this is
714.36s: what keeps it all pushing why does this
717.60s: matter you for me it was simple I grew
720.76s: up poor I had a single mom she worked as
723.16s: a contractor she was a physical
724.52s: therapist she had no retirement I knew
727.52s: as a young man I'm the retirement if I'm
730.44s: not in a spot to take care of my mom who
733.68s: the is going to do it
737.28s: language so for me that was simple
740.44s: that's why this matters to me that's why
742.84s: when in college as my friends are going
745.52s: out to party rightfully so and I used to
747.28s: party too make no mistake about it but a
749.40s: lot of times I would say no because I
751.60s: was in my room doing homework because
753.92s: there was something bigger and more
756.28s: important than me at stake why does this
760.52s: matter to you you have to answer that
764.04s: and visualize it because this is what
767.44s: matters the time that I told my mom you
769.96s: don't have to worry about working ever
771.44s: again I have your back that was the
774.28s: culmination of all of this time and
777.16s: effort and it's completely worth
780.00s: it be an outlier see youall later
783.34s: [Music]
