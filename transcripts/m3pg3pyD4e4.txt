0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you

270.00s:  you
301.00s:  you
326.80s:  you
327.80s:  you
330.00s:  The agenda is fairly straightforward.
334.60s:  We are going to start by recapping the market really,
340.20s:  really fast and then I want to get directly into the skill
344.96s:  development session for tonight,
346.80s:  which is going to be overviewing the outlier strategy process.
351.04s:  And I want to really
353.56s:  just frame that not as this is the way to do it.
359.76s:  I don't want to constrain your mind like that.
362.28s:  This is simply the way that I have learned how to build strategies.
366.68s:  So I'm showing you my approach so that then hopefully you can take pieces of it and
372.68s:  move it forward.
374.04s:  So make it your own.
375.92s:  That's the that's really what that all summarizes to is that I'm going to show you a process.
382.52s:  So at the end of the video tonight, you should have a pretty good idea of how to create
389.40s:  a framework for you to be able to build your own strategies, which I think is one of
394.08s:  the the larger elements of quite literally every trader's career.
398.48s:  You got to get that part figured out and it takes a little time in the beginning,
403.16s:  but once you have it down, it really isn't that bad.
407.56s:  So that's the agenda for today.
411.84s:  So we will get kicked off.
413.80s:  I do have a relatively hard stop.
415.92s:  We can bleed over a couple minutes at 1800.
418.20s:  I have a call with a couple partners I might be working with.
421.52s:  So we are going to move at a decent clip.
425.72s:  Let's get over to the main screen.
427.44s:  I want to start with just recapping the market.
431.08s:  There's a few things as per usual.
433.12s:  I want to draw your attention to and then I want to talk a little bit about the market
441.08s:  as it sits as a whole because I do think that there's a couple things that we should
445.92s:  keep in mind as we move through the current markets.
449.68s:  So let's get into that.
451.68s:  First things first, Reddit.
454.40s:  Reddit actually looks great.
455.32s:  I have a long trade in Reddit on the breakout.
458.76s:  We talked about this a little bit and as earnings coming up and it does look like people
462.32s:  are hedging to the downside on earnings.
464.68s:  So I don't know if I'm going to hold it through earnings yet.
466.56s:  I'm prepared to, but we'll see how it behaves running into earnings.
471.64s:  In this case, it might be a function of put trade on, see if this drift continues and
478.20s:  then if the trade starts to roll back down, pull it down.
483.36s:  So that's why this is up.
484.96s:  Let's get to the flexible grid.
486.12s:  Let's talk about the market as a whole and then we will get into some new specific things.
492.32s:  We got to say hello to everybody.
494.80s:  Looks like we got Tommy, Lauren, Travel and Travel for those that don't know.
500.52s:  Travel is the winner of last month's raffle from the discord participation leaderboard.
508.88s:  And essentially this is a free chance for everybody to win one of two things at the end
513.84s:  of the month.
514.84s:  You either have the choice of a $15 gift card to go grab like Starbucks coffee or something
521.68s:  like that on me or you have a chance to hop on like a 20 minute call with me if you
527.00s:  prefer that.
528.00s:  So every single month, that's something I take a look at in the discord at the end of
535.84s:  the month.
536.84s:  I share it and it's kind of a random drawing the way that it works right now.
541.32s:  So I'll show you right now who we have.
547.92s:  Let's see.
549.68s:  So right now, this is the current leaderboard as it sits and the way it works is literally
556.12s:  whoever is in the top 10 will top two through 10, I should say, because I don't count myself
561.76s:  top two through 10.
563.16s:  They're entered into it's literally just as chat you be to pick a random number and then
567.24s:  it picks one of these people.
568.76s:  So that's what that is.
570.08s:  It's literally just to incentivize people to actively participate in the discord to share
574.64s:  information.
575.96s:  And it's because that really is where the benefit of the community comes from, especially
580.52s:  for the free side of the discord is connecting traders with one another and sharing
586.20s:  ideas laterally.
588.20s:  So we want to incentivize that.
589.44s:  I think it's an important thing.
591.12s:  It's something I wish I had access to, but I know most people's propensity is to lurk.
595.92s:  A lot of people feel weird about not sure if they have something to offer value to add
601.72s:  that I will always remind people the easiest thing you can do about that is post news articles,
606.40s:  post charts, right?
608.08s:  Like that stuff that's accessible to everybody.
609.88s:  So anyways, this is the leaderboard as it sits right now for this month, which is February.
615.00s:  So I'm looking forward to connecting with travel.
616.92s:  I actually think we're set up for this Saturday if I'm not mistaken.
619.84s:  Then we got Hader, Shamgard, dark mark.
623.96s:  Why not to john?
626.72s:  Lauren says my baby calls finally made more than a little.
630.04s:  I have a profit target and everything that's good.
632.04s:  That's awesome.
633.04s:  I love to hear that.
634.04s:  Now, Lauren, as the calls are making more obviously make sure, oh, no.
638.96s:  I knew it was going to happen.
641.60s:  I told you guys, I like this rubber band and it's already starting to break.
644.96s:  Damn, damn, like that rubber band.
650.92s:  Lauren, make sure that you have a system to slide your stops up as the stock is moving
656.08s:  up.
657.08s:  That's a really useful thing to try to capture your profit.
662.32s:  What else we got?
663.72s:  We got Will it?
665.76s:  Will it is a hell of a name from Sweden?
668.76s:  We got Dejon and Fasi T.
673.08s:  He says I was actually day dreaming about the collapse of Reddit today.
676.64s:  Interesting.
677.64s:  Reddit I think is a really great place for a lot of people, for a lot of things.
681.60s:  I like Reddit a lot.
682.60s:  I think it's not a great place to learn about trading in terms of like good information,
686.84s:  but I think it's a good place to learn about the the plight of traders and to really get
691.88s:  a sense of what this looks like for most people because there's a lot of stuff like that
698.40s:  that you'll find on there.
700.48s:  Yeah, but not the place I would go for really well designed information, although there
706.64s:  is a lot of that on there.
708.68s:  So let's take a peek now at the market and let's see what sticks out to us.
713.48s:  The large cap S&P 500 is closing in on highs, but not quite there yet.
719.68s:  We are about a percent off of three month highs and all turn highs in S&P 500.
727.72s:  The fuse is still rallying, but lagging.
730.24s:  These lines are now completely moot.
733.36s:  These do not matter anymore.
736.88s:  Small caps struggling, VIX is rolling over.
740.44s:  Bonds popped a little bit.
741.84s:  Now one of the thing to note about bonds is bonds has a really strange plight ahead of
749.00s:  it because Trump is now starting to talk about wanting to lower rates, especially
753.64s:  for the the 10 year.
757.12s:  That places the market in a really dangerous position, I think with respect to controlling
763.44s:  inflation and things of that nature, we have to see how that pans out, which I think
768.92s:  it's still a little too early to tell what that ultimately is going to look like.
773.36s:  But the fact that that's part of the conversation is something you should be aware of because
777.40s:  that is absolutely a market moving piece of news if and how that continues to progress.
787.52s:  Bitcoin trending sideways 97 and a half look into recapture that 100,000, but not quite
793.84s:  there yet.
795.04s:  You can take a look at materials just straight sideways, straight consolidation here on that
799.20s:  point of control.
800.72s:  Some services down tick a little bit, but still hovering near highs, energy in this downtrend.
808.68s:  It looks like it tried to continue the rally today, but couldn't fully keep it.
813.48s:  So this is starting to look like the potential for an acceleration to the downside.
818.12s:  We have to wait and see how this little reversal, short term trend reversal plays out if it
824.56s:  either can get some strength and rally up or if it rolls back over.
828.68s:  Those look pretty good covering in on closing in on highs, industrials rolling over still
835.28s:  re assuming this broader downtrend tech.
838.24s:  This is one of the ugliest charts I've seen for a sector, honestly, in a long time.
842.80s:  This is a really ugly chart.
845.04s:  So it's been on a bit of a run.
846.84s:  This is partly because of Nvidia Nvidia.
849.60s:  This is something I've talked about a few times, but Nvidia I still think.
854.88s:  Look so good here, but it's so early.
858.08s:  It's so early still.
860.44s:  And again, if you remember on this first drop, the first thing I said that I like to do
864.60s:  with stuff like this is see how it behaves.
869.00s:  The reason why I say that is because from a trader's perspective, there's no real huge
875.76s:  benefit here to being able to bottom ticket or top ticket because the probability of you
880.60s:  reliably doing that over any extended duration is about zero.
884.92s:  So from a trader's perspective, we want to try to follow a trend.
888.28s:  That's the idea.
889.56s:  So one of the things from a investor's perspective, which is completely different from an investor
896.20s:  standpoint chip, man, like this is a great spot, I think, to own Nvidia for the long run.
902.76s:  Like I was telling you guys before, it literally has less than one price to earnings growth,
905.92s:  which is fucking crazy.
910.48s:  Really insanely great valuation for like a longer term holding.
915.76s:  And as I've mentioned, I already have exposure to Nvidia because I'm trading the coverage
922.00s:  strangle and T triple queues.
924.00s:  So that's a surrogate Nvidia position.
927.28s:  Obviously, there's a little more to it than that, but if we take a look at the queues,
930.92s:  Nvidia has a significant part of it.
933.16s:  So and then I also still have it in the SSO position.
935.84s:  So I'm already really pretty well exposed to Nvidia and it's not even from the context
943.60s:  of saying like, oh, it's in the index, right?
947.92s:  Because yeah, it's in the index obviously, but the point I'm making more broadly than that
953.16s:  is this.
954.16s:  Like if you look at spy and you look at Nvidia, it's 6%, essentially of the index 5.7%.
962.44s:  So it's when you're trading something like SSO, you're essentially trading Apple, Microsoft
968.24s:  and Nvidia, Amazon meta.
970.20s:  Like that's the dominant portion of what you're trading.
974.48s:  And then if we look at QQQ, I don't think this does it for QQQ.
979.12s:  It doesn't, which is kind of annoying, but we can see that in here, if you take a look
983.64s:  at the NASDAQ, you can see Nvidia is a significant portion of the queues.
990.68s:  So all that being said, this still looks really good to me from an investing standpoint,
998.12s:  but from a trading standpoint, it is struggling.
1001.32s:  Now there are two points that make sense for entries.
1005.00s:  I think a break above this is viable.
1008.64s:  So I actually had an alert.
1010.56s:  It's off now because it broke above it.
1013.08s:  I'll just draw it with a trend line really quick so that you can see.
1017.20s:  So the first level was above this, and that's because of this volume node once it broke
1021.80s:  out above that.
1023.16s:  And then now it close above the 200 day MA.
1026.00s:  I think that this is all viable entries, even from a trading perspective.
1030.12s:  Now from a trading perspective, if there's an entry gained here, it's a really high probability
1034.64s:  it's going to be wrong.
1035.92s:  So I would size it appropriately.
1038.12s:  And what I mean by that is you can size it either conservatively so that you get out
1043.60s:  if it drops below this low, which means that you're going to be playing the game way,
1048.72s:  way, way more of getting in, getting out, getting in, getting out.
1052.24s:  But that's kind of just part of trying to trade these at this point if you're trying
1055.64s:  to get in really early, or you can give it more room and accept that you're going to
1059.72s:  have to size the trade down.
1061.56s:  Because if you give the trade essentially below this entire volume node down to like this
1065.84s:  114 handle, well now it's at 124, you're giving it a 10 point move.
1070.52s:  So now you have to size this trade logically to accept that kind of move, which is obviously
1078.32s:  entirely based upon your strategy, the way you trade these kinds of things.
1083.42s:  So for me, this is still too early.
1086.00s:  This is an interesting to me yet.
1088.08s:  I would feel pretty confident placing a trade on any of these days, especially in just
1094.48s:  placing a stop down here.
1096.48s:  That's just because it's viable, doesn't mean it's the right thing for me.
1101.08s:  I would much rather wait and see how it behaves if it starts to cruise above here.
1107.00s:  And then if so, that starts to look interesting to me.
1110.12s:  And the reason why above this is because there's another volume node here and it looks like
1116.52s:  overall, Nvidia is probably going to get bought up.
1120.24s:  Like let's just be realistic about it.
1123.40s:  If we look at the institutional arm of Nvidia, it has pretty strong sponsorship.
1132.00s:  So let's see this.
1142.44s:  So from an internal standpoint, it has pretty strong internal support for it.
1156.12s:  But that doesn't mean that near term can't look painful.
1158.96s:  It certainly can.
1161.24s:  From an overall growth perspective, it's crazy.
1164.12s:  It's absolutely crazy where it sits.
1166.52s:  So.
1168.52s:  That's Nvidia back over to this really quick.
1171.92s:  Anything else stick out to us.
1175.40s:  Not really.
1176.40s:  Yeah, not really.
1179.12s:  Staples is still rolling over.
1181.52s:  Staples continues to be the spot that I'm going to look for shorts.
1186.12s:  And even on days like this, I'm looking for divergence between what this is doing and
1191.60s:  then what the internals are doing, which there continues to be divergence.
1195.92s:  There's a lot of weakness right now within staples.
1199.28s:  So if we look at this really quick again from a breath perspective, we can see queues is
1205.20s:  seeing a pretty significant expansion actually of gross highs and a contraction of gross lows
1212.68s:  leading to moderate net highs lows, not much, but like 25 so light, but still there.
1220.12s:  And then the New York stock exchange same, same.
1222.88s:  So all of this synthesized out and maybe a couple sentences is the market continues to
1228.20s:  show in my opinion, really resilient behavior.
1233.12s:  But if we look at this performance of spy, meaning our proximity to all time highs.
1239.84s:  And if you look at what's actually contributing to that, you can see what clearly is calm
1245.64s:  services is financials is as well.
1250.40s:  And then that's almost it.
1252.56s:  You could argue healthcare is starting to provide a little bit, same thing with discretionary.
1259.76s:  But the dominant drivers right now of the S&P 500 performance are coming from these broad
1265.48s:  sectors.
1266.48s:  Now, obviously, that doesn't mean that it's only these sectors providing the strength.
1270.08s:  There will be individual names within that we can get a sense of and see how those are
1275.48s:  driving performance.
1276.88s:  But if we eyeball really fast advancing declining issues, you can see that's expanding across
1283.44s:  the board.
1284.44s:  And then you can also see new highs lows is expanding.
1286.72s:  So this is short term breath showing you a bit of a pause and a turnaround.
1291.32s:  These have been negative for some time now.
1294.36s:  And this is the first day that I've seen kind of green across the board on most of these.
1300.96s:  So as always, this does not mean market goes up.
1305.72s:  It does mean that the market is taking in information and deciding how it wants to behave
1312.36s:  obviously as it always does.
1314.60s:  But this isn't a defined trend yet.
1317.12s:  And this is why I structure trades really carefully right now.
1321.92s:  So we'll go over more of like the portfolio metrics and stuff like that tomorrow during
1327.20s:  the pro stream.
1328.60s:  But for general consumption right now, the portfolio is 106% utilized.
1339.08s:  So really, really light on a relative basis for me.
1342.44s:  And that's also a lot of capital obviously being placed in box spreads, less box spreads.
1348.36s:  It's quite a bit lower than that.
1350.28s:  It's 52% utilized.
1352.96s:  So the portfolio is essentially fully, fully allocated, but we're not fully utilized anywhere
1362.92s:  near it.
1363.92s:  In terms of allocation, we're well over 100% utilization with box spreads and stuff
1369.64s:  is just over 100% so pretty light.
1374.68s:  Now a couple of the things to be aware of, we were underway with earnings.
1381.08s:  And if you're not keeping pace with earnings, there's actually a lot to take away from
1386.08s:  what we're hearing so far.
1388.24s:  So for this week, this is one of the busier weeks you're going to see you can see this essentially
1393.92s:  this these two blocks here, I guess three blocks, three, these three weeks encompass a ton
1401.12s:  of really important companies.
1403.12s:  Now this isn't filtering by anything normally.
1406.32s:  I will filter by the S&P 500 or something like that.
1410.48s:  That's just to try to get rid of some of the names in here because a lot of these are
1417.00s:  not things that are super, super liquid.
1421.96s:  Let me see.
1423.96s:  No, what does this actually do to us?
1426.68s:  It kills everything.
1428.56s:  I don't know what this does for full session options.
1431.96s:  There's always kind of interesting.
1434.08s:  But I normally intersect it with weeklies because if I'm going to trade earnings most of the
1438.74s:  stuff that I want to trade earnings is going to have something with weeklies.
1443.72s:  But so we know Palantir reported yesterday, Palantir had a cracked earnings.
1449.56s:  It did so well.
1451.60s:  And I actually have a couple alert set as you can tell to eyeball Palantir.
1457.16s:  Now I like Palantir.
1458.16s:  I like it as a company.
1459.36s:  I continue to trade it.
1460.64s:  I'm in and out of Palantir constantly.
1463.24s:  The reason though for not entering yesterday is because you got to wait and see how this
1468.00s:  kind of moved digest.
1469.88s:  And now today it's the same thing, right?
1472.16s:  It didn't continue.
1473.48s:  If it was continuing with significant strength, then that would have been a different kind of
1476.72s:  trade idea.
1477.72s:  That's it didn't continue on strength.
1479.52s:  That's a different trade idea.
1481.56s:  This is again to reiterate this concept of a tactical pause.
1485.24s:  We use this in the military all the time.
1487.52s:  It's kind of like that saying you have to know the difference when it's time to move
1494.00s:  and when it's time to be still.
1495.96s:  And there are very distinct times for both.
1499.04s:  So this is a spot where a tactical pause in my opinion is completely warranted.
1504.56s:  And it's to look, see how it behaves.
1507.40s:  And then based on how it behaves, then enter a position that fits with how it's behaving.
1513.28s:  A lot of people when they see these big kind of giant gaps gap up, they'll really look
1518.60s:  to run into them super fast.
1520.92s:  And that generally is a mistake.
1523.00s:  The reason why it's generally a mistake is there will be instances where the stock will
1527.04s:  continue after the gap up.
1529.52s:  There are also a lot of instances where the stock will start to reverse back a bit if
1535.68s:  not this entire gap.
1537.00s:  It doesn't always happen, but it happens quite a lot.
1539.64s:  And this creates a pretty high risk entry because if you look at the last spot before
1543.60s:  it launched, it was at like 84.
1545.88s:  So now you have like a 15 point move that you're looking at.
1548.56s:  If you're trading something like options, which have leverage, you're now exacerbating
1552.36s:  that move, not insignificant amount.
1555.96s:  So for trader perspective, I have to pay attention here.
1560.12s:  Now this is a really, really great candidate though for post earnings announcement drift.
1566.08s:  And it's because it meets literally all the criteria.
1568.76s:  It's not super frequent that you'll find things that meet literally all the criteria,
1572.20s:  but this one does.
1573.44s:  So it came in at zero point, it was expected at 0.054.
1580.00s:  And it came in at 0.14, so almost three times expected EPS.
1585.40s:  So massive beat followed by a massive gap followed by significant expansion of volume
1592.64s:  and then a couple other criteria within the earnings release itself that lead it to
1597.48s:  qualify.
1598.68s:  But just because it has those criteria, it doesn't mean it's going to experience post
1604.36s:  earnings announcement drift.
1605.36s:  I would feel pretty confident that it does to be honest with you, but it needs to start
1610.48s:  moving correctly.
1611.48s:  So again, that's why these alerts are set.
1613.92s:  What I want to see is does it start to rally up into the day?
1618.64s:  Well, it will be two days prior or is this going to be a lot more price digestion by people
1624.52s:  who are taking trades down, trying to book their profits and then moving on to other things?
1632.40s:  It is too early to tell.
1634.56s:  So that's a pass.
1636.60s:  All right, back over to the broad markets.
1640.20s:  We need to take a look at a couple just economic outputs because there are a few things that
1646.76s:  stick out to me.
1647.76s:  I need to get rid of these.
1650.84s:  I don't care about the auction.
1654.80s:  And let's crush this down a little bit.
1661.04s:  And let's take a look at the fifth.
1663.72s:  So today non-farm employment change, you can see it's up actually quite a lot.
1670.28s:  183,000 versus 150 imports, exports are, imports are expanding.
1680.48s:  They're sort of contracting, not ideal.
1683.48s:  And then global services, PMI, global services, PMI and overall like the ISM services, PMI,
1692.04s:  these have been coming in a little bit strange.
1695.88s:  And they're expecting contraction, but the contraction isn't as bad.
1700.36s:  I don't think.
1701.36s:  Now, I'm really interested in specifically tomorrow when we get jobless claims to come
1707.84s:  in and then obviously also unit labor costs because these are just economic health benchmarks
1715.04s:  for us to see in general how do things currently look.
1720.32s:  And that is absolutely the canary in the coal mine for the stock market is how the economy
1725.60s:  is doing.
1726.60s:  So we have to pay attention to it.
1727.80s:  And this week is not packed with stuff, but it does have quite a few things going on
1733.68s:  that I believe we should be paying pretty close attention to.
1736.96s:  Okay.
1738.48s:  So now the other thing I want to take a quick look at is a couple upcoming earnings.
1745.52s:  This is more for myself because I've been trading earnings and I have a bunch of these
1751.88s:  that I need to take a quick look at.
1754.36s:  I'm already all set for my place tomorrow.
1757.44s:  So then let me double check.
1761.44s:  On the lease, that's what I have to look at.
1765.60s:  Grab in O rats really quick.
1768.88s:  So that we can look at Mondalees.
1770.32s:  Okay.
1778.80s:  So Mondalees is an interesting one.
1780.44s:  It's one that I trade earnings a lot like over my entire trading career, but it really
1785.32s:  comes in and out of favor hard.
1787.24s:  See, this one talked about it goes through these phases.
1790.84s:  But in general, this is a pretty easy trade for me.
1794.68s:  The implied, yeah, and you can see exactly why the average implied move is 3.2% the average
1800.28s:  actual is 1.8.
1801.76s:  And this is fairly consistently the case.
1803.96s:  This is one I look at very regularly.
1808.20s:  So this one is definitely on the table from an earnings play perspective.
1813.52s:  You can take a quick peek and see how it's doing.
1820.44s:  And it came out 663 against 65.
1826.64s:  So it actually came in a little bit light.
1828.48s:  That's actually really, really interesting.
1831.00s:  But really sizable move on the day 2.3%.
1834.20s:  I think that's still within the expected move.
1836.64s:  So Mondalees is one of those names that I really typically try to keep an eye on it.
1842.72s:  But this doesn't look good, to be honest, even from the post release.
1849.20s:  This is a heavily defined downtrend.
1858.40s:  heavily defined downtrend.
1863.40s:  That sucks.
1864.40s:  That sucks for Mondalees.
1870.48s:  This is interesting.
1871.48s:  It makes me curious, like really curious, to be honest with you.
1879.88s:  Wonder if there's a short in here.
1882.80s:  I'm going to keep an eye on this actually for a short.
1888.08s:  It's a little bit strange to short on something like this, but really want to see how this
1893.32s:  candle behaves and how people step into the market tomorrow.
1901.20s:  The really strange behavior because this is a heavy amount of buying.
1906.92s:  This is a really heavy amount of buying.
1909.48s:  But the earnings, like it wasn't that great from an EPS perspective.
1914.08s:  It fell short.
1915.48s:  Obviously, the guidance was decent, but still, like that's a massive buy.
1920.44s:  So unless that guidance was like really, really strong for whatever reason, hard to see
1925.56s:  it here.
1929.28s:  So this might be one to keep an eyeball for a return back to Earth kind of trade.
1934.72s:  Let's take a look at tomorrow after the close arm Qualcomm, S-Y-M, M-S-T-R.
1942.12s:  That's going to be a huge one.
1943.28s:  What is the vol in M-S-T-R?
1946.08s:  That's going to be interesting.
1948.56s:  Lauren says, if it turns around, it's going to be decent uptrend.
1951.20s:  I'm going to watch it.
1952.20s:  That's the thing, though, is like I'm really, really curious if it would be a decent uptrend.
1956.12s:  Because I don't see why it would.
1958.68s:  Right?
1959.68s:  Because it's fallen from 76.
1970.96s:  Now at 57.
1973.16s:  I'm not sure why it would be like a decent uptrend.
1983.64s:  Because even on the buying, let's also realize what happened today on the earnings.
1988.24s:  It gapped down.
1989.24s:  Right?
1990.24s:  Like that's what this is.
1991.24s:  That's the only reason why it had that big of a day.
1994.24s:  So even though it had a big day, it gapped down and it closed essentially where it was.
2001.48s:  So I would agree with you if it opened here and then this candle shot up like that,
2006.76s:  that I would agree with.
2008.48s:  But with it like this, I'm just not sure.
2010.96s:  That's why this is so interesting to me because this is a hell of a gap down.
2016.92s:  My guess is from an institutional perspective that hit some sort of value price level that
2024.44s:  some institutions were like, I just dig it here.
2027.28s:  Yeah.
2028.28s:  That's exactly what this is.
2030.04s:  Because you can see the volume right after the open jacked and then tailored off.
2036.60s:  This looks like a bunch of follow through with light resistance because I don't think
2041.24s:  that there's a bunch of people trying to sell it here.
2045.36s:  This is a really interesting one.
2049.36s:  This is a really, really interesting one.
2054.44s:  Yeah, it already broke above that one.
2061.08s:  Yeah.
2065.80s:  This will be a fun one to watch.
2067.64s:  It's not super common that you'll find moves like this where something will gap down
2071.40s:  that hard, but then still have such a powerful day.
2075.64s:  The thing I will always remind people, especially somebody like Lauren, is don't forget that
2082.92s:  the question always is not, is this a place I could put my money?
2087.12s:  The question always is, is this the right place for my money?
2091.12s:  And this is also an underperforming sector.
2095.80s:  So if we take a look, Paul says what's their PE?
2101.36s:  You said PE, right?
2102.92s:  Yeah, let's say look.
2108.16s:  Because they're in staples, which is not doing well.
2114.16s:  PE is 26.13.
2121.16s:  Let's take a look at here.
2144.16s:  I mean, they seem to be doing okay.
2175.16s:  So forward PE right now is 17.4 where the industry average is 23.5.
2181.16s:  This is actually one of the things I really like about the Benzingo platform is they have
2185.08s:  a lot of these style financials and like one really convenient spot, especially for these.
2190.48s:  And I like that they include the industry averages.
2193.52s:  That's for those that don't know when you're comparing stuff like PE ratios, peg ratios
2198.80s:  and stuff like that, the industry average is really, really important.
2203.44s:  So it's cheap on a relative basis.
2207.20s:  That's for sure, but just because it's cheap doesn't make me stoked for it.
2220.80s:  So what I'm doing is I'm just looking at revenue.
2224.80s:  9.69.2, 8.34, 9.29.2, 9.31.
2235.80s:  So revenue is growing.
2238.80s:  Not not exceedingly well.
2246.80s:  But overall, okay.
2257.80s:  And I mean, it's been doing okay on EPS.
2262.80s:  Yeah, really, really interesting.
2265.80s:  I always like keeping an eye on this stuff.
2269.80s:  I think the company itself is not not super impressive right now.
2289.80s:  We'll keep a we'll keep an eye by sweet.
2295.80s:  Any market stuff that we want to take a quick peek at actually let me check the pro.
2302.80s:  Let me check the pro questions.
2304.80s:  Alright, so we got one from our boy.
2309.80s:  Reese.
2313.80s:  Zero.
2315.80s:  To a mill.
2318.80s:  So here's the trade.
2321.80s:  Let's see what we got.
2328.80s:  Long balance your calls average cost 175 per call.
2334.80s:  So $1.75 took down 1014 long calls today for a 3 and 50% gain.
2341.80s:  Okay.
2342.80s:  So this is actually funny.
2344.80s:  We were kind of talking about this before.
2346.80s:  So for Reese.
2349.80s:  We are at what 39.30.
2352.80s:  We'll take a specific stroll.
2356.80s:  We're going to take a look at the last one.
2360.80s:  We're going to take a look at the last one.
2363.80s:  We're going to take a look at the last one.
2365.80s:  We're going to take a look at the last one.
2367.80s:  Thank you.
2377.80s:  930.
2394.80s:  $1.75 per, we closed 10.
2400.40s:  I guess there was 14.
2404.52s:  Okay.
2405.60s:  So then let's do some math here really quick.
2413.20s:  I'm gonna take this over to our Scratch tab
2417.80s:  so that we can do a little bit of math.
2419.88s:  So we're saying that we had 10 of these,
2422.88s:  we got them for $1.75, we closed them for seven and a half.
2427.88s:  Yep.
2428.88s:  And then we're saying that we have four that we also got
2431.88s:  for $1.75 and then these remain open current state.
2436.88s:  Okay.
2437.88s:  This was stuff from the fire things that we were looking at.
2444.88s:  We can kill all those.
2446.08s:  Things that we were looking at, we can kill all those.
2451.68s:  So then here we can figure out our profit.
2454.08s:  So it's this minus this times this times 100.
2460.88s:  When these we made $5,700, our current cost
2468.28s:  on this one is $700.
2471.48s:  So realistically we have a completely risk free trade-on
2477.28s:  right now, which is great.
2478.48s:  Love that.
2484.48s:  One sec.
2494.08s:  Okay.
2495.48s:  We're starting to figure out what dinner is gonna be.
2512.48s:  So now let's take a look at the trade that's left.
2519.08s:  17 April.
2522.88s:  Okay.
2523.28s:  So these are pretty near term.
2529.88s:  17 April.
2533.28s:  Oh, no, that's alive.
2533.98s:  Why did I think that was near term?
2535.08s:  That's plenty good.
2538.08s:  The 120.
2538.88s:  So we're pretty far out of the money.
2544.48s:  I don't see how we close those to be honest for 750.
2548.88s:  I might be missing something.
2550.88s:  But anyways, to continue the thought exercise,
2556.08s:  the way I would manage this for the remaining four,
2559.78s:  really would be I would pick a level below this that you would consider
2563.78s:  the trend broke into the downside.
2566.08s:  Otherwise, I mean, I would just give them as much room as I possibly can.
2569.18s:  It's if you got them for $1.75 and you already made $5,700.
2574.08s:  If those other numbers are correct, which honestly they look a little off to me.
2577.88s:  But if they are correct, then you have a completely risk free trade on right now.
2581.88s:  And after an earnings play like that,
2585.28s:  I would be way more inclined to leave the remaining trade on and just give it as much room to run
2590.88s:  because we already made, we would have made $5,000.
2593.88s:  And then we have $700 remaining on risk.
2596.68s:  And because again, if we look at that overall PNL,
2600.38s:  the overall PNL is actually 5750.
2604.18s:  So this is essentially just taken $700 from that saying,
2607.08s:  I'm going to account for it here,
2609.18s:  say that the total profit on the trade is just $5,700 and then just let it go.
2612.98s:  That's exactly what I would do.
2614.48s:  But if the numbers aren't quite that, which I think they might not be,
2618.68s:  because I don't think these traded for 750 today.
2622.68s:  Oh, no, that might be 750 profit, like 750 total,
2628.88s:  not what they actually were sold at.
2631.08s:  Let's do that really quick instead.
2633.48s:  So seven,
2637.98s:  oh, no, I still don't see how they were sold for 750 profit.
2643.88s:  Yeah, the numbers don't line up.
2646.28s:  The reason why they don't line up is selling them for 750, the 17 April 120's.
2652.28s:  I don't think they traded for 750.
2659.68s:  And then this one says the 14 oct.
2664.28s:  Oh, I'm fucked up.
2666.58s:  14 oct.
2669.08s:  Okay, so it might be the 14 oct long calls to instructions unclear.
2675.08s:  It's too difficult for me to understand the position because we're talking about long calls with this position here.
2680.58s:  And then we're talking another position over here, 1014,
2685.58s:  which I don't know anything about those.
2688.58s:  So having a little more detail on this would be super useful.
2691.18s:  But to just recapture what we talked about from this section,
2695.58s:  the management of the remaining,
2697.58s:  if the numbers are as we say they are here, it's a risk retrain.
2701.98s:  So for me, I would essentially just let them go because even if they fall down,
2708.58s:  now you could pick a point where you're like, yeah, okay,
2710.78s:  if it meaningfully falls below this,
2713.68s:  then I'm going to consider the trend dead.
2716.88s:  And the way that I would do that is I would just use a prior sample move.
2720.98s:  So an example of that is something like from here to here.
2725.28s:  And this was a 23% move.
2728.68s:  So you can take the clothes here.
2730.98s:  I got to squish this down.
2732.68s:  So you can take the clothes here,
2735.18s:  run this down 23% and again, it essentially puts you back into this.
2739.98s:  So you could consider a drop below this,
2741.98s:  but at that point, that option is going to be really cheap.
2743.98s:  Anyways, might as well just leave it on for the convexity if it does start to move.
2748.98s:  So yeah.
2751.28s:  Overall, good question.
2752.98s:  I need a little more detail on the position itself.
2755.08s:  I can't fully decipher from that, but yeah, that's what I got for your Reese.
2760.08s:  And then I'll tag you in the discord really quick to let you know that I hit your answer.
2774.28s:  Okay.
2775.48s:  Now, let us pivot time to talk about the skill development segment.
2781.78s:  So this skill development segment for tonight is a overview.
2787.98s:  So skill development.
2792.08s:  And this is going to be an overview of the outlier strategy process.
2798.38s:  Now, a couple of things I want you to keep in mind as I go through this is this is
2804.88s:  designed to be a framework for thinking.
2806.88s:  This is not designed to be the way for you to think.
2810.78s:  And I want that to be really clear.
2819.28s:  Tommy says, how do you want us to scribe our trades?
2823.28s:  So we can get good feedback.
2825.28s:  Yeah.
2825.98s:  So great question on this in order for I just need to know the trades.
2831.28s:  I don't really care the format.
2832.58s:  I can decipher it, but this one doesn't really help me, right?
2835.98s:  Because there's long pounds, your calls, and then I'm given this position.
2840.38s:  The 17 April expiration 120's.
2844.18s:  And then I'm given this position took down 10 14 long calls for a 350% gain.
2850.08s:  Like that, this doesn't literally mean anything to me.
2853.88s:  I don't know the strike.
2855.08s:  I don't know what we actually got in at.
2857.88s:  And then we lay this over.
2859.48s:  So the way that I would typically recommend inputting trade information is like this.
2865.28s:  I'll insert a comment.
2867.98s:  So standardized trade format is something like this.
2873.98s:  It's XX of the one Jan 25 calls at whatever price we got in at $1.
2887.98s:  So the XX is the size.
2890.98s:  So then this would be sold to open, bought to open.
2895.98s:  Like this.
2897.98s:  So it's just standard trade formatting.
2901.98s:  But the main thing here that's confusing is just that it's missing information.
2906.98s:  So I just can't give like a fully customized answer with like the specific, the specific metrics.
2911.98s:  That's what I would want to give them.
2913.98s:  But I still think we can get close enough.
2917.98s:  So.
2918.98s:  All right.
2919.98s:  Back over to skill development.
2922.98s:  For tonight.
2923.98s:  And again, we're going to talk about the outlaw strategy process.
2926.98s:  And again, this is not the way to think.
2930.98s:  This is a way to think.
2932.98s:  And I'm going to draw your attention to a view.
2934.98s:  Very specific things as we work through this.
2937.98s:  One of those specific things is I want to make sure that you are.
2942.98s:  Figuring out different ways that you can lift.
2948.98s:  What we're talking about.
2950.98s:  And ideally apply it in your own scenario.
2954.98s:  So this is not designed to be something that.
2958.98s:  You know, you're just going to follow along exactly and then do what I do.
2964.98s:  I want you to think a little more broadly than that.
2967.98s:  So the TLO for today, which is the terminal learning objective.
2970.98s:  Is I want you to understand the found the foundational concepts to creating your own process.
2977.98s:  To building strategies.
2978.98s:  This should not be a random effect.
2981.98s:  This should not be a random process.
2983.98s:  It should be clearly defined.
2987.98s:  Now, give me one sec.
2988.98s:  I'm going to email these dudes that I'm meeting with and let them know I'm going to be like 10 minutes late.
2999.98s:  Okay.
3000.98s:  Let's dig in.
3003.98s:  So for those that don't know, I already have a video out there.
3006.98s:  It's a little bit dated on the outlier strategy process.
3010.98s:  I will give you the overview of that here.
3014.98s:  So that link is in the chat for you.
3018.98s:  But the outlier strategy process essentially includes a couple key steps.
3023.98s:  The whole purpose of this outlier strategy process again is literally just to help us create a process and a framework for exploring ideas.
3033.98s:  The reason why this is super important is because if you do not have a framework to developing a strategy every time you try to develop a strategy,
3043.98s:  there's going to be slight variations in what you do, why you do it, how you do it, and therefore the strategies themselves are going to have massive deviations.
3052.98s:  The whole point of building processes is for efficiency.
3057.98s:  It's to spend less time doing like tasks and to do like tasks better because there's a defined process, a defined step that we're doing at each phase.
3070.98s:  So for example, these are the four steps in my mind that I think about when I'm building a strategy.
3078.98s:  I think about first profit mechanisms. I think about second profit mechanism type and signals.
3084.98s:  I think in the first version type might have been over here. It's the same thing.
3089.98s:  The reason why I moved type over here from here is I'm trying to help teach people to truly isolate this one in my mind. That's a given.
3099.98s:  But for a lot of other people, I don't think it is.
3102.98s:  So what does this even mean? I actually have a video that I just made last night that talks about profit mechanisms way more in detail.
3110.98s:  So you'll be able to check that out on Sunday.
3114.98s:  But the key note here is most traders. I don't think have a true understanding of what they're trading or how they're making money.
3127.98s:  It sounds kind of crazy, but that's exactly what I believe. And I'll give you an example.
3133.98s:  If I sell a call option.
3138.98s:  How does that trade make money?
3142.98s:  So give me some different scenarios that a call option can make money. Let's just say I sell a call.
3149.98s:  How can a short call make money?
3156.98s:  This is options 101. So I assume most of you will know the answer to this.
3162.98s:  We'll see if there's a brave soul that is willing to step in front.
3167.98s:  Data decay. See.
3171.98s:  Lauren says premium.
3174.98s:  Tommy says.
3176.98s:  See, none of you have hit the primary way that this trade makes money.
3182.98s:  Tommy says sold to open call time passes.
3184.98s:  Data decay volatility collapses.
3187.98s:  Shamgar says premium.
3189.98s:  If covered capital gains.
3192.98s:  None of these are the primary ways that that trade.
3194.98s:  There you go. Tommy has it.
3196.98s:  That's the primary way of short call makes money.
3199.98s:  Joseph's time. That's not it either.
3201.98s:  See, this is this is exactly why this is important to talk about this exact thing.
3208.98s:  Sean also has the right answer to be honest is just to put on the other trade.
3213.98s:  As soon as you put on the other trade, then your prior trade obviously will let.
3217.98s:  Yeah, I identify with that.
3219.98s:  But you guys see my point, right?
3221.98s:  Black Mama says Ivy and gamma. That's not it. Definitely not gamma.
3224.98s:  Gamma hurts short calls.
3227.98s:  Dejan says they make money from option being out of the money.
3232.98s:  Yeah, that's sort of correct. I get you.
3237.98s:  Joe says I was going to say price drop, but it seems obvious.
3240.98s:  Ah, does seem obvious. Doesn't it?
3242.98s:  But notice how nobody answers it that way because everybody is taught in the standard format
3248.98s:  that if you're talking about short options, you're taught that they did decay or volatility
3255.98s:  are your primary focuses, but they're not.
3258.98s:  They're literally not.
3260.98s:  They are an important focus. I want to be clear.
3262.98s:  I'm not saying don't pay attention to those absolutely pay attention to those.
3266.98s:  You have to, but it's not the primary way they make money.
3268.98s:  And I'll look at an example together right now.
3271.98s:  So let's say that we're looking at Palantir.
3275.98s:  This is fine. We'll just look at Palantir.
3277.98s:  And let's build a sample trade in Palantir.
3281.98s:  Let's say that we sell 44 DTE call.
3285.98s:  We sell the 30s.
3287.98s:  Let's analyze this trade.
3292.98s:  First off, how does this trade make money?
3295.98s:  To your point, it can make money in multiple ways, but not all ways are created equal.
3305.98s:  How can we tell this?
3308.98s:  The Greeks.
3310.98s:  The Greeks tell us exactly how it makes money and to what effect.
3318.98s:  So let's grab our handy dandy notebook.
3322.98s:  And let's take a look here are your Greeks.
3327.98s:  So the first thing that you told me was Thaited a K.
3334.98s:  This is the passage of time.
3342.98s:  The Thaited a K on this option for in state.
3348.98s:  $8.53.
3354.98s:  That's what you make per day holding it.
3357.98s:  Okay.
3359.98s:  So you do make money from Thaited a K.
3361.98s:  So then why am I saying that's not the thing I'm asking for.
3364.98s:  Well, let's take a look.
3366.98s:  Somebody else then said volatility.
3371.98s:  Okay.
3373.98s:  So volatility is Vega.
3376.98s:  Vega is $12.
3385.98s:  In 22 cents.
3391.98s:  So this means if volatility contracts, you make by one point, you make $12.22.
3399.98s:  I also said that's not the main thing I'm talking about.
3401.98s:  Why would that be?
3403.98s:  Oh, let's answer that question.
3405.98s:  I told you the dominant ways price direction.
3413.98s:  This is the thing that is so misunderstood.
3417.98s:  Is that this is still a directional trade.
3419.98s:  That is your primary profit mechanism here.
3422.98s:  That's measured through delta.
3426.98s:  The delta on this option is $30.
3433.98s:  So let's just take a look at the profit factors here.
3438.98s:  Delta accounts for $30.
3445.98s:  Vega gives us $12.
3451.98s:  Veda gives us $8.53.
3459.98s:  So I again ask, how does this option make money?
3464.98s:  It makes money from all these factors.
3466.98s:  But one of them is way more important than all the others.
3470.98s:  Here's an example.
3472.98s:  Let's say you get your change in volatility.
3477.98s:  Let's say volatility drops by 1%.
3484.98s:  That means you get your $12 here.
3486.98s:  You get this.
3487.98s:  So we're going to add that.
3489.98s:  Let's say one day passed.
3491.98s:  You get your $8.53.
3495.98s:  We add that.
3496.98s:  So now between these two, you're up 20 bucks.
3500.98s:  Guess what happens if the stock moves $1 against you.
3505.98s:  You lose 30.
3509.98s:  So you were right on your Vega.
3511.98s:  You were right on theta.
3513.98s:  And direction says, fuck you.
3515.98s:  I don't care.
3516.98s:  You're now negative $10.
3518.98s:  You got two out of three factors correct and you still fucking lose.
3522.98s:  That's because people misunderstand how to use things like the Greeks
3529.98s:  to inform the way we set positions up and the way that we then build strategies.
3537.98s:  Because again, if you are thinking of this from the perspective of
3542.98s:  the way I make money is through Vega and theta, then you're going to optimize for the wrong fucking things.
3553.98s:  You have to be directionally correct.
3557.98s:  This is a directional trade.
3561.98s:  Your profit mechanism is direction.
3564.98s:  Your profit mechanism is not volatility.
3567.98s:  Your profit mechanism is not theta.
3570.98s:  Those are two contributing profit mechanisms.
3574.98s:  But there's secondary to the primary, which is direction.
3579.98s:  And I just gave you an explicit example why it is the case using the Greeks from the very option that we're looking at.
3589.98s:  Okay, hopefully that point is clear.
3593.98s:  So let's go back to our overview.
3597.98s:  Next up.
3599.98s:  Let's fly through these.
3602.98s:  Wake.
3604.98s:  So the profit mechanism, this is where we isolate the actual way our trades make money.
3612.98s:  This is actually identifying the effects.
3616.98s:  And when you're trading options, there are almost multiple effects.
3620.98s:  It's never just one, but there is always one that is dominant.
3625.98s:  Just gave you an example of that.
3628.98s:  Then the second step is to take a look at the specific type of profit mechanism that we're looking at.
3636.98s:  So an example of this is something like this.
3640.98s:  Profit mechanism here using that short call example, that's price direction down.
3648.98s:  This is the profit mechanism, the overarching effect that leads to profit in this example.
3656.98s:  Then the type can be many different things.
3661.98s:  You can have price that goes down in different ways.
3666.98s:  So how do we figure out these different ways?
3668.98s:  Well, when you don't know, you start by just looking at stuff.
3672.98s:  So let's take a look.
3673.98s:  Let's go back to a staple.
3679.98s:  I think.
3682.98s:  So what's the difference between this kind of move versus this kind of move or this kind of move?
3699.98s:  Severity.
3700.98s:  How big the move was is different.
3703.98s:  There are different things about this move than this move.
3706.98s:  So the way that we label it, you can call it whatever you want.
3709.98s:  It doesn't matter.
3710.98s:  I use different terms to represent different kinds of moves.
3714.98s:  I use terms like break out so you can break up or break down.
3720.98s:  In this case, we'd be a breakdown.
3722.98s:  I have things like drift momentum because this is a breakdown within a longer term uptrend that has positive drift.
3733.98s:  But I can also see that there's some very clear things from a technical perspective that are starting to set up and create different conditions.
3742.98s:  So the whole point of defining the type is to differentiate between different things.
3749.98s:  Another great example is price direction up.
3751.98s:  What's the difference?
3753.98s:  If I look at the chart starting here and then I go to here.
3756.98s:  And then if I look at the difference between this and then this.
3763.98s:  What's the difference?
3764.98s:  This is drift.
3766.98s:  Well, this is technically momentum, shorter term than drift.
3770.98s:  This is momentum.
3771.98s:  Momentum and drift, they kind of go back and forth.
3773.98s:  I sometimes sloppily interchange them like I did there.
3776.98s:  This is momentum.
3778.98s:  And what, how do we understand the difference between these?
3782.98s:  We just start by looking.
3784.98s:  So if I measure this move from there to there.
3788.98s:  I might have to open this chart up a little bit more.
3793.98s:  Yeah, there you go.
3794.98s:  That represents a 7.7% move over 191 days.
3801.98s:  Okay.
3802.98s:  So now I have a 7% move over 190 days.
3806.98s:  What do I have here going from here to here?
3811.98s:  I have a 6% move in 33 days.
3816.98s:  Pretty damn different, huh?
3819.98s:  So the way that I think about trading these two different things is different.
3827.98s:  They behave differently.
3829.98s:  This one made way more ground in way less time on relative basis.
3835.98s:  So the idea behind profit mechanism and then profit mechanism type
3840.98s:  is to differentiate.
3842.98s:  First we have the broad profit mechanism price in this case direction up down.
3847.98s:  The type helps us understand the difference between those two examples I showed you.
3851.98s:  And then signals.
3853.98s:  The purpose of signals is to help us find the profit mechanism.
3857.98s:  So as you're looking at the profit mechanism and the type,
3861.98s:  then you're using these different tools to analyze your understanding of it.
3865.98s:  To see what you can learn about it.
3867.98s:  So I'm going to come to the signals that you want to track.
3870.98s:  You have questions about.
3871.98s:  So if we take a look at this again, we have things like moving averages.
3875.98s:  We have things like standard deviation channels, volume profile, RSI,
3879.98s:  with the moving average, average volume, someone and so forth.
3883.98s:  It's whatever tools you use to help you see the thing that you're trying to identify in the market
3888.98s:  to then therefore build, getting structures to then turn into strategies.
3895.98s:  So I'm really going to go over all of these and we'll go further in depth on each one.
3901.98s:  But I wanted to start you with this overview so that you have some ideas of how to build your own process.
3912.98s:  And this is exactly how I go about it.
3914.98s:  But the most important one on here, unequivocally is this one.
3918.98s:  You have to get the profit mechanism right.
3920.98s:  If you do not get the profit mechanism right,
3923.98s:  literally the rest of your work is wrong.
3926.98s:  So that's something to keep in mind and it's something to spend more time thinking about.
3931.98s:  Because again, based on the example that we reviewed earlier together,
3934.98s:  a lot of people got that answer wrong and that's okay.
3937.98s:  That's why we're here. We're here to learn.
3939.98s:  But that's clearly identifying that we have some ground to cover with what we're trying to learn.
3946.98s:  Because for a short call, delta, delta matters.
3952.98s:  And then is that option moves.
3954.98s:  Other things can overcome it.
3956.98s:  So let's take a quick look at an example of that.
3960.98s:  Let's say in here you started off by shorting this at the money call.
3967.98s:  And then it goes further and further down into the money.
3972.98s:  And notice how your delta climbs.
3974.98s:  So delta becomes more and more dominant over everything.
3979.98s:  But if you go too far out of the money, you can have delta that's relatively low compared to something like theta or Vega.
3988.98s:  But very rarely, even for super far out of the money options,
3992.98s:  will you have theta and Vega that overwhelms your delta?
3997.98s:  Keep it in mind.
3999.98s:  All right, gang.
4001.98s:  I'm going to pop off.
4003.98s:  If you have any questions, let me know for the outlier pros, we're literally going to go into a case study on this exact thing tomorrow.
4010.98s:  And I'm going to show you how to build your own version of this.
4014.98s:  So you use mine as a framework to give you ideas on where to start.
4017.98s:  If you like mine, lift it and shift it. Use it.
4019.98s:  But if there are elements about mine, they're like, I don't really know what to do.
4023.98s:  That's okay. That's what we're going to go through tomorrow.
4025.98s:  So tomorrow, you're going to have a sense literally a defined checklist of what to do in each of these steps.
4032.98s:  So that you have a starting point.
4035.98s:  As always, let me know if you have any questions, be an outlier.
4041.98s:  See you all later.
