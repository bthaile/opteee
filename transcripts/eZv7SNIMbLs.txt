0.00s: Sizing options trades can be a little bit tricky, but if we start with a simple scenario,
6.32s: which is if you typically trade bi-rexionally.
9.56s: And if you're going to establish directional trader, you normally, if you're doing a good
13.88s: job, are going to have predefined profit and loss targets before you enter your trade.
19.56s: Great example of this is, this is GM pulled up.
22.32s: So let's say that we thought GM might roll to the downside, post earnings, whatever, and
27.40s: you think tariffs are going to be awful and yada yada yada.
30.68s: Let's say that you defined your upside risk by saying, well, where would my idea be
35.24s: wrong?
36.24s: And let's just say that if it pops above this 4875 handle, that's where we would deem ourselves
42.68s: wrong.
43.68s: Well, all you do is define that point on the chart, then based on the long calls that
49.48s: you choose to buy the short puts, the call spreads, whatever, you look at what the
54.16s: cumulative loss of your position would be if GM trades at this 4875 handle.
61.12s: And then you size that risk.
63.28s: So it makes sense.
64.28s: So in this case, let's say this is a standard directional play.
67.24s: You don't want to risk any more than 5% on the high side of your portfolio.
70.92s: You typically stick between 1 to 3%.
73.36s: So let's say that you size it so that it represents a percent and a half to percent
77.68s: loss of the portfolio.
79.60s: Then in options, you can take it once that further, you can then measure what the probability
84.56s: is of it getting there compared to the probability of hitting whatever your profit target
89.96s: is.
90.96s: Maybe that's 43 and a half.
92.60s: And you can measure the expected return for the bet that you are making.
97.64s: This is one way with directional trades, short options, completely different story.
102.36s: Being all our sealer.
