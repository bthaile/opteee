0.44s: [Music]
0.80s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.68s: we got two things to go through both our
4.80s: position updates so as some of you
7.36s: probably know by now I am running a
9.52s: covered strangle in a couple different
11.96s: tickers that I'm sharing with you all
13.80s: and kind of updating as we go through
15.24s: one is to show the management of the
17.28s: coverage triangle and different ways we
19.28s: can apply it and then second a vector to
22.36s: learn about the markets together
24.12s: position management that kind of stuff
25.96s: so you guessed it we have two on the
28.72s: agenda the first one is GameStop and
31.60s: then we have ibit or Bitcoin and these
35.96s: are two positions that I've maintain for
38.48s: a little while now but it's about time
40.88s: to kick this off so that hopefully we
42.52s: can run this for like a full year and
44.04s: just see how they do so in GameStop what
47.56s: happened today we landed just above 32
50.36s: this was a a pretty solid close
52.44s: realistically because the GameStop down
56.96s: 1.97% but the broader Market was also
60.08s: having a pretty rough day you can see
61.88s: that NASDAQ down heavy and if you take a
64.72s: look at small caps take a look fell out
66.24s: of bed this is not good so this is small
68.96s: caps really rejecting this consolidation
71.32s: range and as you can see there's nothing
72.96s: but below this this is Lookout below
75.48s: there's just not a whole lot of
77.80s: transactions going on in here so what
79.44s: that tells me is that the movement that
80.88s: we saw in GameStop was actually
82.60s: relatively strong I think that's
84.40s: generally worthwhile noting the other
86.76s: thing that I want to follow up on was a
89.60s: conver ation between Dave low and I from
96.04s: this past week we did a live stream on
99.24s: Irvin and we talked about this a little
101.96s: bit neither he or I knew exactly what
103.96s: was going on but this looks like we kind
108.28s: of know what was going on this is from a
111.12s: little while ago on the 12th of December
113.64s: but this person is showing some trades
115.48s: on the Chicago Exchange and their
118.12s: assumption is that they're using it to
120.08s: hedge some options that traded very
123.20s: close proximately which makes a lot of
124.88s: sense so it looks like a few different
128.24s: contributing factors relating to the
129.84s: volume that we're seeing on Chicago a
131.32s: lot of it does probably have to do with
132.72s: the rebates that we're seeing liquidity
134.36s: availability but then you can also see
136.44s: here you go that there are different
139.36s: kinds of benefits that are provided on
144.56s: the Chicago Stock Exchange compared to
146.28s: the other so really interesting but it
148.52s: looks like internal Market incentives
152.00s: for people to to operate there also Los
154.64s: Angeles is a blaze right now in case you
156.72s: didn't know cool so that part aside
159.52s: let's take a quick look just at the
161.60s: options chain and then I'll run through
162.80s: the position itself this is I think
166.36s: mostly going to be representative of
168.24s: what the position sits now again this is
170.12s: through my pass through IRA account so
171.68s: it doesn't flash a bunch of personal
172.88s: information so I just recreate the
174.80s: position down here so that we can look
176.36s: at that together but we'll get to that
178.56s: in a second first let's take a look look
180.56s: at the options chain itself so this is
184.24s: actually interesting so
186.84s: 9 157,000 calls against 296,000 puts
191.72s: that's a massive expansion and still the
194.68s: majority of that is in 17 Jan 17 Jan is
197.08s: about to be spicy and you can see that
199.80s: in the VA in 17 Jan still being so
202.00s: elevated this there's just so much
203.68s: exposure there right now there's no way
205.60s: for it not to be spicy as it sits now so
208.80s: this is actually very cool to see I
210.20s: think that this is interesting now a
213.56s: bunch of these options will have fell
215.48s: off after today the 10th we lost 128,000
218.84s: calls only 30,000 puts so still I mean
222.80s: in excess of 3 to1 calls to put so still
226.24s: just massive bullish skew this kind of
229.24s: positioning as far as I see it right now
231.40s: is not just purly people playing these
233.76s: front run expectations of a squeeze
235.96s: right that's why the 10 Jan is so light
238.48s: that's why the 17 Jan is so heavy we got
240.88s: to 21 Feb it's super light 21 March
243.52s: super light so we're still playing the
245.72s: near game for sure but yeah we haven't
249.36s: really started filling out any of these
251.12s: deeper except 16 J 26 is already at
253.72s: 57,000 it's about a 1:1 ratio between
256.48s: calls and puts so the short term is
258.68s: capturing all of that bullish skew but
262.72s: as you know shout out to the out of the
265.88s: monies for today we lost a lot of good
268.24s: soldiers out there you just hate to see
270.48s: it happen but that's how the trading
272.96s: Game Works gang it's just going to be
275.32s: like that all right so last thing I want
277.92s: to take a look at for GameStop
279.84s: specifically is I just want to see if
282.40s: there's any interesting flow that came
284.52s: through really like using that word I
286.48s: have to be honest it's just because it's
288.08s: so abused and beaten down and it
290.84s: frustrates me so it's I don't know it's
292.48s: like a weird Quirk I suppose all of
294.72s: those and let's take a look on the
297.28s: options and see if there's any
299.08s: interesting sizing that we saw came
301.08s: through I just want to make sure the
301.80s: rest of the filters are set up as they
303.44s: should and we're good okay so sorting by
307.32s: premium super small nothing nothing
311.20s: sticking out to me here going back a
314.44s: week still small so nothing jumping
318.76s: out all of the major activity is still
322.32s: in that 17 Gen expiration but I think
324.52s: that's just because that's where people
325.68s: have been building out for a little
326.80s: while cool position update time so let's
330.76s: go down I keep forgetting I copy and
332.68s: paste it from my actual log into the
334.48s: workbook just because this has
335.88s: everything that we typically poke
337.08s: through but the links don't copy over
339.00s: for some reason which really really
340.52s: grinds the old gears so might have to
344.08s: get your eyes check if I was blurry
345.48s: there but it looks like we're back so if
349.24s: we take a look I did have the 7g and 25s
352.24s: I had the 32s and these were set to come
355.80s: down today the objective was to be
358.56s: assigned I sold these when they were 44
360.12s: Delta so they were right at the money
361.80s: but alas no such luck so easy day here
366.40s: these essentially will be moved down to
370.12s: my put tracking side down here got to
372.84s: make sure that the same format applies
374.92s: to this whole thing so that Eric's OCD
378.12s: doesn't go
379.60s: insane and this will come off from here
383.00s: and then we will look to reenter some
385.08s: more so now after today as the position
388.76s: sits it looks like we will be a little
392.92s: bit light like uh I was expecting to be
395.96s: up a little bit more shares here we're
397.28s: only on 300 shares at 2695 I still don't
400.56s: want to scale in a whole bunch here but
402.80s: it's starting to force the hand a little
405.20s: bit so there's a good chance what will
407.64s: happen on Monday is I'll actually buy
411.32s: some of the shares outright and then
413.32s: continue to sell cash secured puts cuz
415.04s: right now we're only 50% utilized and I
416.64s: think we should be deeper than that on
418.64s: GameStop for the
420.04s: and for those that don't know I did up
421.76s: the allocation to 25k just because we
425.40s: did a couple polls on the weekend
427.76s: streams and that seems to be about
429.20s: representative for about the average
431.16s: account size as far as I can tell so
434.08s: there's nothing going on here you can
435.64s: just ignore all that so yeah we have 300
438.36s: shares 2695 we have two of the 28 puts
442.92s: out in 21 Feb these will sit those were
445.44s: 52 DTE were're only 10 days in that
447.48s: trade and then we have only one one of
450.24s: the 35 calls I probably will sell a
452.20s: second soon and that will likely happen
454.60s: on Monday that's just to capture some
456.44s: more of this volatility especially as
458.08s: we're coming into this near-term
459.44s: expiration so the additional calls that
462.16s: I will sell will be it wouldn't be two
465.16s: it's just going to be one more so that
466.32s: it's two to three it's absolutely not
469.60s: with the intention of being assigned I
470.92s: want to keep the shares I'm just
471.92s: collecting the premium here now
475.32s: comparing the
477.32s: strategies all these numbers over here
479.68s: all messed up from the copy and paste so
481.52s: you really can't take any of those at
482.92s: face value this is really what the
484.60s: position will continue to look like at
486.52s: least for the time being until we get to
488.60s: Monday so that's the game plan here for
491.08s: now and for those that are interested in
493.60s: the Bitcoin position I am trading a
496.28s: coverage strangle in IIT this has a
499.00s: slightly larger allocation this is all
502.28s: part of a kind of a testing section of
505.40s: the portfolio I started this last year
507.60s: where I took a section of the portfolio
509.52s: I broke it off to trade and track these
513.12s: specific tickers with you all um ideally
516.40s: I'll show you ideally these so it's part
519.16s: of the leveraged coverage triangle in
521.48s: the index ETFs dqs and uo and then ibit
525.48s: was added on for a Bitcoin exposure
528.36s: proxy again for me and like my primary
530.24s: Bitcoin position is actually just in
531.64s: Bitcoin itself so this is all part of
534.36s: that broader tester portfolio this is
536.40s: actually using my money but I just break
538.92s: a piece of bit off to do these with you
541.20s: cuz even though there's a little bit
543.84s: that's suboptimal about doing some of
545.44s: these the way that I am it's not exactly
547.60s: how I'm playing these outright I still
549.60s: feel comfortable with the positions and
550.88s: I'm fine with them right I like I
552.20s: wouldn't just waste good money it's just
554.20s: not exactly optimized I would be trading
556.40s: a little more aggressively than this but
558.32s: the coverage strangle as I'll continue
559.88s: to remind you is really designed to be
561.44s: built around a Buy and Hold position so
564.56s: what I'm essentially doing here is
565.88s: saying I want to buy and hold something
567.92s: like ibit you Pro teacher qes and then
570.12s: GameStop and then I'm trading this
571.64s: around it so right now we have a th000
575.68s: shares at
577.96s: 5455 and we have five series five total
583.96s: short puts out to different tranches we
586.12s: have a two lot and a three lot so super
587.64s: small trades we're in the 52 strike in
591.48s: 17 genan and then the 49 strike in 21
593.96s: Feb and then on the call side we have
597.12s: six of the 60s expiring 21 Feb
600.00s: you can see that we have six or 600
603.04s: total short Delta potential on this side
605.28s: against 1,000 long Delta so we're still
608.00s: maintaining that ratio and this one is a
611.12s: lot of just sit and wait for now there's
612.88s: not a whole lot going on that's super
614.84s: exciting there were a couple management
617.04s: components a little earlier and let's
620.88s: take a look we have ibit is hanging out
625.32s: right now at 5384 this is basing a
628.68s: little bit better
630.12s: but it is at a very delicate spot still
633.84s: and the reason why I say that is because
635.88s: you can see that it's transacting
637.64s: against this point of control that it's
639.40s: been establishing for some time now the
641.52s: Market's been hovering around up here
643.72s: but I'm seeing lower highs which is not
646.88s: good it is better at least that it's
650.08s: holding these lows and those are pretty
652.08s: flat but beyond that it doesn't look
655.08s: super healthy this is completely stuck
656.96s: there for the time being it's our new
658.24s: friend so so really what we want to see
661.72s: is ibit starting to crack above this for
664.80s: kind of like a bullish continuation
666.72s: that's the reason why I added some
668.32s: shares here but in terms of overall
671.96s: allocation um what did I I have 125k
676.12s: allocated and the position right now is
678.08s: only using 80 so we're still less than
679.92s: 65% allocated and it's to give me room
682.36s: to move right like if we fall 30 40% I
684.92s: want to be able to scale into that and
686.88s: if we start breaking out I still have
688.28s: room to scale in and catch more of the
689.84s: upside my my broad expectation of the
693.04s: market right now is it feels like it is
695.00s: in a delicate state it does not look
697.00s: super healthy we're seeing some small
699.44s: elements of strength but one thing I
701.48s: have been really really pleased with the
703.24s: Bitcoin holding is that it does a good
705.88s: job to a degree offsetting some of the
708.32s: risk that I have in IW mqs and spy
711.04s: there's still beta relationship there
712.60s: it's not decoupled at all but it is
714.96s: lighter which is again just generally
717.40s: kind of cool because it's a way to beong
720.48s: something that I like I don't
722.20s: necessarily want Bitcoin to go down at
723.88s: all so that the underlyings like uo and
726.40s: tqs can do well and they maintain a
728.40s: relationship where they're a little less
730.36s: correlated that allows me to do that
733.16s: that's where we're at so there's
735.40s: anything you'd like to see me talk about
737.72s: anything you want me to go over in these
738.84s: recap videos let me know we'll be doing
740.68s: these pretty regularly for the rest of
742.64s: the year ideally because again I want to
744.48s: give you a long run view of what we're
747.60s: doing in these two strategies so
749.28s: hopefully people can learn a different
751.48s: way of doing things hopefully add couple
753.40s: more tools to the tool belt and there
755.64s: will be some weeks where there's not
756.80s: going to be a whole lot to talk about
757.84s: because a lot of the strategy is buying
759.36s: and holding and waiting but that's still
761.96s: part of the game so I I hope to show you
764.44s: some of the interesting points where
766.24s: we're going to have to roll in the money
767.64s: options that's absolutely going to be on
769.04s: the on the docket right now it is but
771.80s: there will be periods where this is
772.88s: going to become pretty hectic especially
774.40s: if the market rolls over but if not it's
777.28s: a lot of this so let me know if there's
779.68s: anything you want to see me talk about
780.80s: be an outlier I'll see you later
