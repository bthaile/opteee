0.52s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.84s: and today it's a little bit of a somber
4.36s: one we have some bad news
7.72s: unfortunately our fan favorite Kenneth C
12.20s: Griffin CEO of Citadel LLC it's a real
16.04s: bummer to see these kinds of things come
17.72s: down it's uh man Citadel Securities
21.32s: they're going to have to pay a $1
22.72s: million fine for alleged finra rule
27.00s: violations and you think like how could
28.72s: this happen right Ken obviously cares a
31.68s: lot he's a man of the people and for me
35.76s: I personally hate to see finra SEC bully
42.04s: people that take such good care of us so
44.84s: let's just get into the details here and
46.52s: see what happened to to go after our guy
49.44s: here because I mean I might have to
51.56s: start a petition in his favor because
54.20s: this is unbelievable it's you got to
56.12s: take care of those who take care of you
58.60s: so let's read through this and I have a
60.68s: bunch of things we'll review with
62.04s: respect to this but um from the start of
66.20s: its Consolidated audit Trail it's cat
69.28s: system I'm just going to refer to it as
70.76s: that instead of that whole thing each
72.00s: time on 22 June 20 through 28 a 24
76.12s: Citadel Securities failed to timely and
79.08s: or accurately report data for tens of
82.52s: billions of equity and option order
85.56s: events let's talk about that right tens
87.24s: of billions I think it's like 42 billion
88.80s: or something like that
90.52s: I mean who doesn't make a mistake once
92.56s: in a while right i' I've made mistakes
94.64s: so it's it's hard for me to conceive
96.64s: that finra would come down so hard on
98.80s: somebody for making a just a few
101.28s: mistakes and you think about it it's not
103.36s: it's not like this went on for like
104.68s: decades right it's only four years so
107.44s: it's like how could we expect something
110.60s: like Citadel and Ken in order to get a
114.44s: system in place to actually fall in line
118.12s: with these crazy compliance metrics and
120.72s: you know Market transparency it's like
122.76s: it's so unreasonable so to hit him over
126.00s: a 4year series of errors and something
130.08s: that amounts right here right three
132.24s: types of Errors accounted for 41.8
134.88s: billion who hasn't made a couple errors
138.16s: in their time so it's feels like feels
140.80s: like a really harsh punishment to me so
143.92s: let's continue to see the kind of Errors
146.12s: we've made did not report zero in the
149.16s: leaves quantity field for certain fully
152.64s: canell orders impacting 31.2 billion
156.04s: canceled order
157.44s: events applied the representative
160.36s: eligible indicator uh looks like we had
162.84s: a little bit of a typo here see H I'm
164.80s: telling you happens to everybody instead
168.28s: of the representative indicator in to
172.56s: 6.3 billion New Order events did not
175.92s: populate the iooc time and force code
179.48s: for 4.3 billion order events that's like
184.76s: you know you just hate to see it so
188.32s: then if we pop over here we can find the
191.16s: finra letter right there you click that
193.36s: it'll take you to this page well really
196.20s: it'll take you to one page before this
197.76s: page then you can get uh I'll just show
199.92s: you so that you can follow along you go
202.32s: here you go down to the bottom you just
204.44s: pop into this bad Larry right here and
207.08s: then when you click this bad Larry this
208.92s: one will pop up
210.40s: and then now we can read through the
212.00s: actual finra filing and let's let's just
215.36s: see what what happened here so it talks
218.96s: about the background essentially what's
221.16s: supposed to happen so from the start of
224.20s: the cat reporting obligation through 28
227.28s: August 24 there were some errors a
230.16s: couple errors and we can see they have a
233.76s: fact list of all the different things
236.56s: the violations that they have it's only
238.40s: a few of them right so there's just like
240.76s: a couple small rules here that we're not
243.44s: filing following you can see the issues
247.20s: laid out see look at this by 22
250.32s: September Citadel Securities had
252.16s: remediated the 33 error types The Firm
255.48s: experienced up to 31 July so you know
258.52s: they're trying to write their wrongs out
260.16s: here so you know good for them right
263.40s: after remediating the 33 a types they
265.80s: identified four additional
267.92s: issues who hasn't found another problem
270.36s: after you find one problem now here's
272.76s: the deal that we all I think have to
274.52s: take a giant step back and understand
276.96s: this is this is an institution with only
280.28s: 64 billion in assets it's not reasonable
284.64s: for them to have a functioning
286.64s: compliance arm that are staffed with
289.08s: like real people that can follow the
291.88s: rules right it's not how how could they
294.88s: you can't get that past the budget I'm
296.84s: sitting here trying to pay a YouTube
298.36s: video editor once in a while and I can
300.04s: only afford to pay them once a week so
302.32s: you know I I feel them here as a small
304.80s: business owner this just you know it
307.16s: really resonates you only have 64
309.28s: billion to play with you're only like
311.48s: take a look at this this is It's a
314.12s: crisis mode they're essentially making
316.16s: 2.3 billion in a quarter from Trading
318.56s: activities they posted only 6.3 billion
321.80s: in net trading Revenue last year which
323.48s: is down from 7.5 billion the year before
326.52s: money's got to come from somewhere so I
328.64s: mean it's not like they're working with
330.48s: a bunch of assets to hire the right
332.40s: people and if you look at Ken it's like
334.24s: well what's he going to do right like
336.36s: he's only 43 billion so if you think
339.28s: about what that adds up to it's just
342.36s: it's unreasonable and I think that we
345.16s: actually should take a moment to get to
346.52s: the bottom of this and see what this
348.48s: would look like for them so we have
351.40s: Kenny G 43 billion we have Citadel 64
354.80s: billion we have a a regular us person
357.24s: might be about $100,000 right maybe
359.20s: total worth something like that and we
361.48s: have our really big bad fine right here
364.00s: that's this one which is a million
365.56s: dollars so this might look like the math
368.72s: hasn't started yet it is it has we just
372.20s: actually need to add a couple more
374.04s: decimal places so in putting this $1
377.36s: million in the context of Kenny G and or
382.08s: citadel's assets this is what we have so
385.36s: you you click increase decimal places
387.28s: and you you might think Eric there's an
389.16s: error with your formula obviously the
391.68s: it's not mathing you need to do the
393.36s: formula no it's the formula is there but
396.44s: we just actually just have to add more
398.64s: decimals to understand what percentage
401.48s: of their net worth this $1 million fine
403.88s: represents so let's let's just click it
405.80s: again and it's like oh no Google Sheets
408.44s: isn't loading at this point because
410.12s: we're at 0.00 we're not even at a at a
412.96s: rounding Factor yet which is it can't be
416.16s: that low could it then we we'll click it
418.28s: again and there we go so I told you it
421.36s: was working I told you it was working
423.00s: just fine so if we click that out one
425.28s: more time to see what these numbers are
427.00s: we can see for you know poror Ken this
429.88s: $1 million fine would represent
434.24s: 0.23% of his total assets and for the
438.96s: Citadel LLC organization as a whole this
441.72s: represents
443.60s: 0.016 so you can see that it's really
445.84s: taken this would take a massive toll on
448.68s: on Ken on unfortunately now you might be
451.24s: curious like curi I'm a curious kind of
454.04s: person let's move these over here and
456.08s: let's just kind of take a look at an
458.00s: equivalence here let's say that you're a
460.28s: normal us person maybe you have
462.28s: $100,000 and let's take a look at what
465.64s: this equivalent is for you because I
467.76s: would want to know right like so I can
469.80s: empathize appropriately with Ken and
472.76s: Citadel I need to understand their
474.48s: plight so that's what I aim to do I want
476.64s: to know out of my money what what's the
480.76s: equivalent percentage what how much am I
482.72s: paying and we need to see what this
485.48s: looks like because the equivalent of $1
489.40s: million going to Ken or Citadel which
492.72s: comes in at this percentage of their
494.68s: total net worth um on
499.20s: $100,000 about
503.84s: $156 I'm sure they won't do it again
