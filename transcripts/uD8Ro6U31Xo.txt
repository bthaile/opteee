0.00s: I made 28% return on my money in less than two months on this trade, but I could have made more.
6.80s: I want to walk you through the Apple ratio call diagonal. I brought up on some of the YouTube live sessions.
11.52s: And I want to share with you at the end of the video some different scenarios that could have played out
16.32s: if I placed the trade differently and talk about how I think about those because it's really important to keep things in context.
23.04s: What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers.
25.84s: Shout out to the Patreon family if my videos are useful to you consider signing up. It helps me out a bunch.
31.68s: Let's get right into the video. Okay, so here we have a trade in Apple. And essentially I entered here with some 190 days to expiration, deep in the money long calls.
42.56s: And I also sold some short premium against them. The reason why I like this trade is because it allows me to benefit from the leverage of options,
50.08s: but then also collect some premium upfront. So that's exactly what I'm doing. It's also known as a poor man's covered call,
55.20s: which is slightly different than what I'm doing here. It's a ratio diagonal. Now as I progress through the trade,
60.16s: I started noticing that there is definitely some bullish bias here. I was getting the movements that I wanted to see.
64.80s: And I needed to make some interesting adjustments to my position. So here's what we got. Overall in Apple, I was bullish.
72.40s: That's why I chose a ratio call diagonal. And for those that, you know, don't really understand what I was seeing at the point in time,
78.88s: I'm going to zoom this in so that you can see exactly what it looked like when I entered, which is this right here.
84.24s: This is when I entered after a good earnings release after the earnings release, it was holding that gap up.
90.80s: And the other thing I found interesting is that this is near term highs, right, on the chart at the point in time.
96.64s: And this is counterintuitive to a lot of traders. Traders are typically like, they got to bargain by,
100.80s: they got to look in the bottom of the bins and find the cheap cigarette butts that are half smoldered and hope that it goes up.
106.00s: I'm partially making fun of Warren Buffett, but not really. He's a genius, but I'm too impatient.
110.16s: I'm not as good as he is. And my goal is to make money a little bit faster.
113.44s: So what I mean by all of this is I'm looking to buy on strength if I'm bullish. And that's what I saw here.
119.52s: So that's why I established the position that I did. Let me zoom this back into a six-month daily.
123.28s: That's a three-month daily, great job, Eric, you missed. There we go. We're back at it.
126.16s: And let's take a look at the entry. So like I said, this was on the 10th of May. I bought the 17-nove 130 at a two-to-one ratio.
134.40s: That's why I have two here and ones down here for the short calls and most of them.
139.20s: So I'm just giving you an idea of the ratio. This is the minimum size I could show you a two-to-one ratio.
143.52s: And I had bought those for 47-45. They were around an 86 delta. When I first bought them, when I exited,
149.52s: they were like a 98 delta. And the way that I was thinking about managing risks to the downside was actually pretty simple.
155.44s: I answered here and I was using this near-term resistance right down here as my stop.
160.80s: So essentially, as long as we didn't fall below like 164, I would have given it down to 162 before I got out.
167.36s: And if it had gotten to that point, it would have been a 2250 loss on the two contracts again that I'm using here for the position sizing.
176.32s: So it would have been a meaningful loss, but again, nothing too crazy. Relegating it to a pretty small portion of the account in total.
182.88s: That's just of the allotment that I'm using here for the proxy, 10,000 bucks.
187.20s: Okay, when I first entered, it was trading 172.73, something like that.
191.12s: And I was starting with selling short premium against it, as I typically do.
195.04s: But then I started to notice that it was rallying. It was continuing to rally.
199.12s: So what that meant was I had to take some of my short calls down.
202.40s: Actually, the first one was in the money, but I was able to take it down at a small profit because it so much time had passed
209.36s: that there was still a net credit to be seen even though it was in the money. I love those scenarios.
213.52s: And then I reloaded. I downsized. I went from a two lot to a one lot because I was seeing that bullish
218.96s: confirmation. I wanted to let it move to the upside. And that's exactly why I wanted to reduce some of
224.80s: the short deltas against the longs. Give it some more room to run.
227.52s: And then the rest of the short calls that I was using in this instance, I kept it down at that two to one
232.16s: ratio. The reason why I had a one to one when I first entered is because the deltas were offset enough
236.80s: that I still had upside potential to run. Now, I did end up having a bunch of these that I close for
242.96s: losses throughout the cycle of the trade. And again, that's because I was favoring the upside potential as compared to
249.44s: salvaging the credit that I could collect on the trade. So you can look through this, see what you think.
253.92s: And the ultimate end state here is I exited. I didn't exit both leaps at the same time. I exited one of them to
260.80s: cover the cost of this in the money short call that I couldn't wiggle out of. And then I closed the other one on this
267.76s: date right here on the 28th of July. And the reason why I did that is because I had this position that was
274.96s: expiring 28 July. They were the 190s. And at this point, we're at like 196. So there was nowhere for me to go.
280.48s: It definitely there wasn't a great role available without going super far down time. That kind of thing.
284.96s: And I looked at it and said it made the move that I wanted. And it had already started to stall out
290.00s: after hitting this high volume was contracting down. If we look at it on average. And I also saw
295.92s: starting to hover into this nine day moving average short term moving average. So all of that led me to
301.68s: say like I actually thought there was going to be a little bit more upside potential after I got out. But I
306.00s: didn't think it was going to be too much. So that's exactly why I got out here. Sometimes when something makes the
310.64s: move that you want it to make, you don't have to fight it all of the way. Now one of the things somebody was
315.44s: asking me is how did I kind of decide when to take profits? Like why didn't I exit here or why didn't I exit here?
323.76s: The main reason is is I'm following the trend. As long as the trend continues to move where I want it to move,
329.84s: what I like to do is continually slide up my stops. So what I mean by that is if I grab this price level and
336.72s: I show you my original stop was, you know, like I said somewhere right around here around 162. And that's when it was
341.60s: on the 10th of May. Then when I saw it rally up here into this like one high 170s, I slid my stop up to here to 170.
350.08s: Then as I saw it start to catch this leg, I look for the next set of near term resistance, which I
354.80s: considered something around here, maybe like 181. And I'm just using the tops from here and then the
359.92s: bottoms from here. And then I'm using the moving averages as my shorter term indicator as I'm sliding
364.80s: this thing up. I care about the slope and I care about the organization. So as long as it continues
369.84s: following the trend, then I'm going to try to stay in it. If I didn't have the short calls
374.16s: expiring that forced my hand to close here, I would have held it until here. And I would have gotten
378.64s: out as price firmly closed below the nine and was touching the 22. That would have been exit protocols
385.52s: for me in that case. So just giving you some context there. Okay. Now as I promise, I want to walk
390.00s: you through these three scenarios. The first scenario is exactly what happened. This was buying the
394.24s: long options and selling options against it, which in this case worked against me. I gave up some
399.12s: money doing that. So in this case, I walked out again, 28.8% return on a Vesic capital. If I didn't
404.96s: trade any short options, knew the future and knew it was going to go up and just bought the same
410.48s: long options, I would have had something between a 35 38% return on a Vesic capital depending on
415.68s: you know, exact exit and entry. So I'm giving up anywhere from you know, six to 10 points on my
421.68s: return here. But this is predicated on me knowing the future that it's going to go up. I did,
425.92s: that's why I trade these. And then if we look at buying the commensurate size in shares, it would
431.36s: have been a 13% return on a Vesic capital. That's another thing people ask all the time is,
435.44s: is it better to just buy the shares? It can be sometimes. But in this case, it's a little more
440.96s: nuanced because if I had bought again, using $10,000 account as the sample, if I had bought $10,000
447.36s: worth of Apple when it was trading at 172, I would have had like 55 shares, something like that,
452.32s: 57 I think. And if that made its run from 172 up to 196, that's my return 13.1%. But what you're
460.16s: seeing here is leverage. In this scenario, I would have controlled again like 57 shares. In this case,
465.28s: I was controlling 200 shares on the same exact cost structure. This is why sometimes if you use
471.28s: options for leverage, it can actually be a pretty beautiful thing. So if you have any questions on what
475.28s: I did, why I managed it the way I did, let me know. Throw down in the comments if you would make
479.68s: the same trade. And if so, what would you make the trade in? And until next time, be an outlier.
484.16s: I'll see you guys later.
