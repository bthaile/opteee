0.00s: What's up, everyone? Today is all about GameStop. I want to run through a little more in depth.
6.50s: Some of the activity that we're seeing, although it is generally quiet on the Western
11.14s: front, this is a good time to collect different baseline information for the product. So that's
17.18s: what I want to do here because a lot of the conversations that I've had recently about
21.08s: GameStop since we had this pop back in like the middle of May was very centered on kind
27.46s: of really busy markets, right? Like take a look at these volume bars. It's just a lot
31.34s: going on there. So we're in this little bit of a decline phase, right? And you can see
36.16s: a few things that I find interesting straight from a chart perspective. When I look at the
42.04s: way price was behaving before we had the previous squeeze, we can see that volume was real,
48.00s: real quiet. We saw a little bit of volume expand around earnings as per usual. Then
53.96s: we have this massive explosion in volume. And that's just been coming down real, real
59.72s: steadily. Let me get me out of the way so you can see right down here. So the very first
65.08s: thing that comes to my mind is closely monitoring the volume and the way that the volume moves.
74.06s: So what I like to do down here is to just kind of set, let me grab this little line for
79.28s: you guys like price level. So I try to set these different levels like that so that I
84.32s: could see, all right, this has been the kind of more recent regime high for volume. And
92.04s: we are definitely trailing down below that at this point, which is again, to be expected,
96.56s: it's relatively quiet. But this becomes informative with how this volume average line and how
104.04s: the volume bars themselves start to behave because I want to keep a really close eye
109.80s: if we start to see a meaningful expansion in volume because that's exactly what happened
115.80s: back here. When we had this first kind of slight turn day on three May, we started to see
121.68s: on the second before we had the bigger day on the third, again, contextually large expansion
131.36s: in volume. The reason why I say contextual is because when you look at this bar, you
135.20s: look at this bar and you're like, yo, that ain't nothing. But in this case, it is something.
141.68s: And the reason for that is because these bars expanded because of earnings. There is a
146.52s: clear event you can look at and say we are higher over here for that reason. This makes
151.88s: sense. There's more people transacting in the product around earnings. Okay, got it.
156.32s: Very, very normal. Now it gets a little different though because we have this random higher
162.76s: day here. And then all of a sudden, there's this day, the second, it's essentially a completely
169.76s: green bar, meaning the overwhelming amount of volume that you saw on this day was by volume.
179.16s: Interesting, I think. And then that's before we started seeing the rest of this move coming
185.52s: to fruition. So while some people might be slightly dismayed about the volume contracting
191.68s: down how it is and that kind of stuff, which I get, but I would also look at it on the bright
196.00s: side where now you kind of a really clean slate to identify triggers and to identify interesting
202.96s: buying activity and the underlying, if there is any, that's something I think about. Now
208.44s: a couple of people have asked me about my positions in GameStop. I always try to remind
212.44s: you guys that what I do really shouldn't matter. And I'm always happy to talk about it.
217.64s: But the reason why I preface that is I know a lot of people ask that question to try
221.24s: to benchmark what they think they should be doing for their own stuff. And the only
225.80s: person that can answer that is you, whatever you think makes sense for you, please do that.
231.60s: It's nobody else's decision other than your own. But I'm always again happy to talk about.
236.12s: So right now I still have shares of GameStop, but I've scaled out meaningfully. I do not
241.60s: have a big position on at this point. And I also have some short calls against them still
247.44s: to try to collect some premium against the shares. And essentially I started this campaign
252.32s: back here and here. It's scaling out of the product as it starts moving in the opposite
259.56s: direction. I began scaling in the shares a few different periods throughout this entire
263.64s: time frame, but this more relative period is kind of in here. And the basis on the shares
270.24s: that I was getting in at was around 22, which was overall really good basis. But the thing
275.08s: about the way that I operate as a trader is I'm very reluctant to let winning trades turn
281.16s: into losing trades. So when I see turn days like this, I start scaling out. And then when
287.52s: I see us falling below points of control, I start scaling out. The reason I'm scaling
292.00s: out is to take money out of the trade. I've made money. I want to keep the money in my
295.84s: pocket so that I can do more with the money going forward. Again, this is my world is a
301.10s: trader. I know a lot of you have a different approach, which I have tremendous respect for,
305.52s: which is to hold all and to D. R. S. your shares, which is totally cool. This is just a different
311.04s: way that I think about playing it. Now, I've already told you guys I will always maintain
315.36s: some level exposure and game stop just because being part of the story is cool. It literally
321.24s: that's that is the depth that goes into that. So what I'm highlighting is there's a part of
327.44s: me that is participating in the underlying literally to support you guys. But then the other
332.92s: part of me, the broader part of the position is a trader. And my job is to trade. So that's
337.52s: what I'm doing in here. Now, for the shares that I do have on, I still have a couple different
342.76s: alerts set to scale me out. But even if I essentially get to full scale out of my speculative shares,
350.52s: the position that I'm going to maintain just to participate will essentially remain.
355.96s: So that's where that is. I'm running the short calls because the premiums on them are still good,
361.32s: although they've contracted a lot. That's actually been one of the things I've been trading in
364.60s: game stop is a lot of relative volatility positions. And then also variance risk premium in here
370.20s: has been really good. But you have to be very careful the way you trade those kinds of things in
374.28s: a product like this because of how it can move. You literally can get your face ripped off in just
379.08s: a few seconds. So that is not something for the faint of heart. You have to have a pretty solid
385.00s: management plan for that. So anyways, this is a recap on what I'm doing in here. Now, in terms of
389.96s: my expectations, again, I'm a trader. I spend very little time making trades off of something I expect
397.00s: to happen before I see it starting to happen. So what that means is, for example, I think game stop
402.36s: is going to go up. Do I think it's going to go up tomorrow next week, five weeks from now? I
406.84s: genuinely don't know. Now, does that mean because I think it's going to go up that I'm going to
411.56s: start dog piling money into the product? No, that's not how I trade. And it's because I need it to
417.56s: start showing me that it wants to go in the correct direction because otherwise, it's very easy
424.20s: to get wrapped up in periods like this in periods like this where something kind of
429.32s: goes sideways a little bit, trends down. And then again, from a trader's perspective,
435.24s: there is a massive opportunity cost to tying up a bunch of capital and something that's not
442.12s: really doing a whole lot for a long period of time. It's a difficult way to make money again
449.80s: in my business. So what I'm primarily looking for here is it to start showing some different price
458.52s: behavior. This still just looks like consolidation to me. We saw a bit of an update today.
464.68s: It's up. Well, okay, I lied to you. It's not up, I guess technically it's up. Come on, man.
471.48s: So it looks like it closed at 2395. It's down like a quarter point. But after hours, it was
478.36s: jostling around just a little bit higher. I thought maybe we'd get that back. But no, it's up
482.92s: just a little bit on the day. So where did it open today? 2359. And then it closed at 2395. So
490.84s: it's up ever so slightly on the day. So I view this as a consolidation period. It's been
499.48s: exceedingly range bound between 23. And if you exclude these two pop-up days with like the
506.04s: broader data set here, it's really like 27. But if you include those, it's like 28, almost 29,
511.72s: maybe 28 and a half that I would consider this range. So like 23 to 28 is where it's hanging
516.12s: around in right now. And that's okay. As long as it continues basing here, because the other
520.04s: thing that I still am keeping a really close eye on is this. So right now, let me zoom this in
527.08s: a little bit more. So it's a little easier to see. One of the things when I'm looking for something
531.16s: even if it's slowly trending up is standard standard price behavior, higher highs, higher lows.
539.40s: So when I see something post, I call this a term low. You know, it's I'm excluding the data
543.96s: before this. This is kind of like after these really big candles all settle down. And the product
548.60s: seems to kind of be settling in a little bit. This is like the term low here, which is the first
553.80s: of July. From there, we post a low and I'm using the body of the candle, not the wick. I care
559.88s: about the body because that expresses some level of conviction in my opinion. The candles can be
564.28s: really extreme. And then things can snap back really quick. So I pay attention to the wicks to
570.36s: be clear. But in this case, I'm worried about the body where it actually was closed out at,
574.44s: which was 2333 is where it closed here. So then I want to make sure that this is not falling
582.92s: below that. If this starts going below 2333, which we're close, we're real close to that. We're
589.24s: like 50 cents away. But I care about that because from here, we made this low. We had a little bit
595.32s: of a pivot here. We had a higher low, right, which is kind of like this range here before it
600.92s: broke down below it. And now we're covering back down here. None of this ultimately matters,
606.28s: realistically speaking. But it tells me the behavior of people participating in the underlying
612.68s: and what they're doing. And I do care about that. So if we're able to kind of even kind of turn
618.28s: here a little bit and get back into this consolidation range closer to the point of control,
621.72s: that would be fantastic. I'd love to see that. If not, it's not something I'm adding money to
626.28s: until it starts doing that. And it's just because I can't park a bunch of money in there waiting
630.84s: for it. And that's that's the tricky part with GameStop is you never know when it's going to go.
635.80s: But I also find that it doesn't typically just go out of the blue. Again, even this move here
642.60s: up to 65. And I think pre-market it was up to like 80. It didn't just go from 995 to 80. It went
650.76s: from 995 here. It hit a high of 1288. Then here it hit a high of 1745. And so you had 1, 2, 3, 4,
661.24s: 5, 6, 7 days before we had the first launch here. And then a second launch after that. And it's
669.16s: the same thing here, right? So you still have 1, 2, 3, 4. I think I counted that twice. There's 4,
674.36s: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 days of price movement before it starts to pop up here, came back down,
681.32s: pop back up. All I'm saying here is that I have no problem not bottom-taking it, right? In this case,
688.20s: when I started building my position here, I didn't care that I was building here and not here.
694.60s: That's okay for me. Again, I'm trying to catch the majority of moves and avoid parking money
701.72s: and something until it starts really exhibiting some behavior in a strong direction.
707.16s: Now, from a company's perspective, I really think GameStop is positioned pretty well. And I
713.00s: chuckle at that because I look at the other examples for GameStop, things like Blockbuster and
717.56s: what they did and Xerox and what they did. And like these other kinds of companies that failed to
721.88s: adapt. But they have pretty good leadership that I think is really well in touch. I think Cohen
729.08s: is really smart, dude. They made a really wise at the money offering that I know is a little
735.32s: frustrating for people in terms of Moas and a squeeze. But position the company really,
740.68s: really well without massive dilution. So now they have a ton of cash and they have a really
745.88s: cool roadway ahead of them to now innovate. And they have the money to do that, which is very
752.12s: cool in my opinion. So even as a company, like I genuinely do not think that this is anything
758.68s: that people should just overlook. That's one of the most frustrating things I have with folks
763.00s: is when they're like, oh, it's just a meme stock. It's like I get how people have been trained
767.96s: to think that. But you have to be a little bit more of a thinker around those kinds of concepts
773.56s: in my opinion and these kind of products because they seem to have really interesting potential
778.60s: at this point. So now let's take a look at the options chain. Today we saw moderate volume.
787.16s: Again, lower on the call side than typical in terms of what's exciting. We're generally seeing
792.20s: stuff that's over 200,000 calls traded in a day. Now it's 132,772. But the put side is very light.
800.12s: This is an interesting ratio actually today. Whereas only 38,000 puts to 132 calls. If we take a look
806.76s: at OI, I see 729K calls against 400K puts. So this is getting closer to being 2 to 1, which again,
818.84s: that's a more bullish positioning for the options than I see in this is compared to what I see now.
824.92s: Although this is still very bullish. This is why it's important to develop a relationship with
828.92s: products because a lot of times people could see this and be like, wow, 729 to 409, it's going up.
834.44s: But if you don't have the context of what this number has been historically and you don't realize
837.96s: that this relationship is actually low on a comparative basis in terms of call skewed to the put side.
844.20s: Now it's still a bullish in arrangement, right? There's a lot of people speculating to the upside
848.60s: here and they continue to do so. What I'm seeing though is more and more of this build out in 16 August.
853.96s: That's specifically what I want to highlight for you guys. I'm not seeing a lot of people moving
860.52s: these positions out to 2 August. There's some but not a lot. So if we take a look at a bunch of
866.28s: this volume for today, there was a ton on the, what is it? The 25s for this week and next week.
875.88s: My speculation is that some of these are closing positions and moving out to 2 August. That's my
882.52s: guess. We'll know tomorrow. It's a pure guess at this point. But what I see at these 25s is 13,770
891.16s: OI with essentially 11,000 volume today. It was negative 88 over yesterday. So people started
898.84s: closing positions out yesterday. My guess is more of this 13,000 will be closed out tomorrow.
905.72s: And a lot of these, my guess is that if we go out into next week, will be reopened here.
912.52s: Right. And actually, this was already partially confirmed because the open interest on these is
918.20s: only 7930 and the volume is 91 away. So immediately, there's adding volume to this. So this
928.20s: number will be net positive tomorrow with people moving out to essentially 2 August. But that's
934.36s: essentially where I'm seeing that happen. The vast majority of the remaining activity that I'm
941.40s: seeing is moving us further out into this 16 August. So if we take a look at this front
946.28s: expiration, there's 178 K calls. Next expiration is 64. Next after that is only 23. And then out
955.80s: in 16, it's 197. So what this further expiration for the first time in a long time actually
961.40s: overwhelms the front explorations. And this is just telling me that more and more of the interesting
969.32s: behavior, more likely than not, is going to start looking at 16 August during the op-ex. And you
974.76s: can also see this just take a look at the open interest skew here, 197 to 107. This is much
981.16s: closer to 2 to 1 than when we look across the broader relationship here. So overall, it looks
989.56s: like that's where most people are starting to kind of position themselves out into. Now the other
994.76s: thing I want to look at quick is just the order flow as it's been coming in. I'm limiting this
999.80s: by 50 lots or higher just to find some of the bigger trades. We have the 26 July, 35 calls,
1007.32s: 1100 of those for three cents. That's an interesting trade to me. So somebody bought those. And
1014.52s: I'd love to know why it's not a big trade. So I don't really care about it quite that much.
1019.80s: But I'm still curious about it because I mean, you got a day left. So this is hard for me to make
1029.24s: heads or tails on whether or not this is just somebody coming out with a crazy yolo. I wouldn't
1033.88s: put it past somebody. Or if this is some sort of institutional hedging, it's hard. It's really hard
1038.92s: for me to see. But I find that trade generally interesting. Now same thing with these 22 puts,
1045.64s: there's 837 of them, but 19 cents like the problem is a lot of these are just smaller value.
1050.12s: There are some decent value trades like the two log 20 calls, 310 of those at 350. But most of the
1056.92s: volume that we're seeing today is just lower premium amounts. And this really doubles down on what
1063.56s: we've been seeing lately in GameStop. I'm grabbing unusual whale so that we could take a look at today's
1070.20s: activity specifically. And we can see what the premiums work. I haven't looked at this yet.
1076.36s: And this is interesting. There's some activity here. So this was today at 0710 at the ask 500 of the
1085.88s: 20 calls out in September. Interesting. That's a $200,000 position. So we're starting to get some
1092.60s: position showing up that are breaking, you know, over $100,000 in premiums. They're all purchased
1098.44s: calls, but they're across different time frames. So I see the 20s here in two aug. I see 16,
1105.08s: Jan 26 kind of really far out. This is a smaller position, but just super far out in time.
1112.92s: Then 23, this is interesting too. I'm surprised that none of these are for the primary
1117.80s: expiration. I have to be honest with you. So when I look at this, I would expect more of them to be
1122.28s: in the 16 aug. Let me put it side by side like that. Maybe easier to see. This is the primary
1127.72s: expiration. And I don't actually see a lot of activity going on there, which does surprise me.
1133.96s: Let me take a look real quick at that cycle. Color me shocked. I'm surprised. I'm very surprised.
1143.40s: I would have expected some larger trades happening there. This is very interesting to me. So there's
1149.48s: definitely people building side. I mean, $200,000 again, I know it can be kind of numbing when we're
1155.08s: so used to seeing somebody like roaring kitty who's dropping these just wildly size position.
1161.40s: So it can kind of skew your perception of reality. But buying $200,000 in calls is not insignificant.
1168.04s: Especially they're essentially the ones building out the strike. So if we go to six September,
1173.64s: which is just a weird, weird expiration. It's almost like tasty trade-esque, like 45 days out.
1180.36s: Maybe there's somebody out there yellowing from tasty trade. That would be hilarious.
1184.20s: And it was those 20s, right? No, the, am I wrong? The 20s? Yeah, the 20s.
1191.40s: They're essentially the entire volume for these. There's 46 other people. But this one trade
1198.84s: is the overwhelming majority of this position. And that's interesting to me.
1207.32s: I don't know why you picked this one. I really don't know why you picked this one. Because again,
1211.88s: like if I were to look at this, let's just add a curiosity. Let's compare. Let's go to the 20th
1215.64s: September. Let's check out those 20s. And these are 75 cents wide, 530 to 605.
1225.64s: These are $1.70, essentially. Like just way more liquid, way more liquid.
1233.00s: That's nuts to me. I don't know why you would pick this. It's just what I'm highlighting here is
1239.88s: for putting on a larger position, this is so liquid. In comparison to something just one week after
1245.64s: it at the same strike, if you like, or even something further in the money. These are a $1.40.
1251.00s: But these are just just relatively so liquid. And they were the only person playing in there.
1257.08s: There was just there's not a lot of activity activity activity happening out here in six
1264.44s: set. Actually, let's take one last look here at I just want to see what's out there.
1277.00s: Nothing. Like there's just so little happening out in this expiration. Yeah, this, I mean,
1282.60s: this dude is out there by himself. Interesting trade. We'll have to see.
1288.60s: Well, as always, that's what I'm seeing right now. If there's anything else you want me to look
1292.36s: over, feel free to send it in. I love seeing the emails and seeing what I can talk about our
1296.12s: answer for you guys. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
