0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.54s: I want to talk to you about a trade in CCJ
4.78s: where I used unusual options activity
7.94s: in conjunction with a thematic idea
11.02s: to effectively make over 200% return on the option itself.
16.38s: And it was about 160% return on a VESA capital
20.30s: so far, the trade's not fully over yet.
23.38s: So I'm going to talk to you about what the idea was,
26.54s: how I found it, those kinds of things.
28.42s: And I want to start by setting the table with you all.
33.02s: And this is the position we're going to be talking about.
35.98s: The first thing to know is that I've scaled this position
39.78s: so that it's similar sizing in my actual portfolio,
44.98s: but using the $600,000 model portfolio.
48.66s: I'm trying to put everything in a common language.
51.10s: So effectively what this is is essentially saying,
53.94s: if this trade was part of this portfolio,
56.54s: this would be the relative sizing used,
59.94s: which ended up being $12,600 position for 50 lots.
65.44s: This represents about a 2% position,
69.22s: which in my actual portfolio, this trade was larger,
72.78s: but this is the same relative size.
75.14s: So that is we talk about the model portfolio
77.18s: and stuff like that, all of this carries over.
79.06s: Because the actual dollars amounts,
80.66s: it none of it matters.
81.54s: That's why I'm not spending time showing
83.66s: like the actual position.
84.58s: It doesn't actually matter.
85.78s: I know that it's fun for like gain porn and seeing numbers,
89.18s: but I care so much more about talking about the process.
92.98s: So I think it's useful to keep everything in that context.
95.94s: So let's start with the broader theme.
98.26s: And let's listen to a few seconds of this.
100.34s: This is from a few months ago.
102.78s: From President-elect Donald Trump,
104.22s: that he wants to drill baby drill,
105.50s: but it's unclear if oil executives actually
107.54s: want to increase production while President-elect Trump
110.42s: has said that he wants to gut the inflation reduction act.
112.86s: So nuclear could actually be the biggest energy beneficiary
116.14s: for a few reasons.
116.94s: First of all,
117.94s: so you heard it, and I think this is actually a pretty decent summary.
122.10s: The positioning for nuclear power is very strong.
124.58s: So it put it on a watch list for me.
127.82s: And it's something that I knew that we were going to see
130.18s: policy eventually announced around.
132.50s: And when we would see that policy,
135.18s: there likely was going to be a interesting change in price.
139.34s: So we're going to talk about this trade
141.54s: in the context of the outlier trade process.
144.06s: And I will throw a link to this video in the notes below.
147.30s: But this is effectively the major steps I go through mentally
150.70s: as I'm putting on a trade.
151.94s: So I feel it relevant to talk about the trade
154.90s: in the context of this process.
157.54s: So I have different positions on in nuclear power
161.10s: themed trades right now.
163.54s: But and even in CCGI, multiple positions on.
166.66s: But I'm actually focusing on a specific subset of those positions.
170.70s: And it's because the entry for this series of trades
173.78s: was fueled again by unusual options activity,
176.30s: which is kind of fun to look at.
177.90s: And it helps me create a tie-in, actually, for something
182.58s: I regularly use, but combining it with thematic play.
186.14s: So again, ticker here with CCGI,
188.70s: and it's because they produce uranium.
191.26s: And they're very successful at it.
193.10s: They're one of the primary producers that we see.
196.02s: And with all of the domestication of things
198.22s: that the US is going through,
200.46s: it seems like this company would be pretty well positioned.
203.14s: And this is more for a longer term idea.
205.50s: Again, this is the backdrop.
207.26s: The way that my brain works is,
209.18s: I like to create different themes
211.02s: that I'm paying attention to,
212.18s: and that as they see opportunities emerge
213.94s: in those themes, I'm ready to bounce on them.
216.82s: So this started not as a portfolio need,
221.22s: but an opportunity.
222.22s: So again, for my general screening process,
224.46s: I want to know, do I have something specific?
226.74s: I need to put into the portfolio,
228.06s: do I need long delta short delta's,
230.14s: long premium short premium, long data adoption,
232.30s: short data options, all that kind of stuff,
233.66s: not a little polite.
234.74s: This was entirely driven by an opportunity
238.66s: as I saw it emerging.
240.46s: So for some general context in CCGI,
244.74s: if we look out over the last three-year time frame,
248.22s: we can see that it's in a pretty aggressive growth phase.
251.18s: However, it had a massive sell-off,
254.62s: essentially from late 2024,
258.50s: and then it started bottoming around April.
261.50s: So the longer term trades that I'm using,
265.06s: not gonna go into detail on those here,
266.74s: but actually started following earnings,
269.46s: and it's using essentially two breakout periods
272.06s: from the second of May, and then also on the sixth of May.
274.74s: But again, that's not what we're gonna discuss today.
277.26s: We're actually gonna discuss a trade that started on the 14th.
280.90s: And the 14th kind of quasi breakout,
283.38s: but again, it was the options component
285.94s: that led to the idea.
287.58s: So this is a broader thematic upside play
292.02s: in nuclear energy.
293.66s: The profit mechanism in this trade
295.62s: is gonna be direction.
297.26s: And the stuff that I was looking for
299.74s: really helped me identify momentum,
302.70s: drift, and positioning.
303.70s: And again, we're gonna spend time looking at
305.78s: the actual options positioning that peaked my interest.
309.62s: The trade itself was gonna start with long calls,
313.42s: and in the back of my mind,
315.90s: it has the ability to turn into a ratio called diagonal.
319.30s: Again, I have other positions on that already exhibit
321.58s: or the ratio called diagonal side.
323.54s: So this one was really designed to be a little bit shorter
325.94s: term again because of the options
327.98s: in just following the options flow.
331.18s: So this position was going to be managed
335.90s: not by time, meaning duration and trade.
339.46s: More so based on movement.
341.62s: However, if enough time passed
344.10s: and the trade wasn't doing what I thought it should,
346.50s: then I would have exited.
348.58s: So the actual trade that went on was super simple
353.30s: on the 14th of May, CCJ was about $52.53.
358.02s: And again, relative to the $600,000 portfolio,
361.86s: this represents a 50, 50 lot
364.10s: the actual trade was larger than this.
366.26s: And I went out to the 19th, set 60 calls
369.58s: for $2.52.
370.78s: These were a 37 delta.
372.46s: This is a little bit different than when
374.34s: I'm typically trying to size these trades
376.54s: because if I'm going to go that far to the money
378.50s: a lot of times, I'm actually going to be closer in time.
382.38s: However, this is mostly where I saw better liquidity,
385.62s: which is what led me into that strike
389.26s: versus something that was a slightly higher delta.
391.86s: So this represents a $12,600 debit.
395.34s: And again, this is a little bit large
398.14s: for a speculative trade based on what I typically would do.
402.42s: Normally it would be less than a percent.
404.82s: However, in this context, I went for a little bit larger
408.22s: because of slightly higher eviction.
410.86s: And the risk in the trade was defined by the size.
415.26s: I wasn't expecting to realize that full 2% loss
418.74s: if I started seeing not accommodating price behavior,
422.26s: but that is what I was prepared to lose
424.10s: based on the trade.
424.86s: The reason why I always take the time to define risk,
428.34s: whether it's going to be by size or by a hard stop,
431.02s: is because it allows me to then plan
433.86s: successfully for the rest of the trade.
436.14s: So what led to the original entry,
439.54s: it's actually kind of interesting.
441.10s: And I have some screenshots here to show you.
444.58s: We'll take a look on the platform,
445.90s: but I really want you to just pay attention
448.42s: to the net premiums.
451.02s: And notice what happens on this day.
453.86s: You see how there's just this massive spike
457.30s: in positive call premium.
459.90s: So people that are buying calls.
461.90s: And then you also see that there's kind of a drop
463.86s: the next day in put premium,
466.26s: meaning that these are people selling puts.
468.90s: Overall, very interesting positioning.
471.38s: And this is what originally caught my eye.
473.50s: Again, it wasn't just this.
477.02s: It's this in conjunction with the broader theme
479.46s: that I'm paying attention to.
480.50s: The reason why I'm making that point is
481.94s: because this in and of itself would not lead to an entry
485.26s: for me, but it's this in conjunction with that broader idea.
489.70s: So let's go over to the platform really quick.
492.50s: And let's take a look specifically at two things.
497.06s: I want to show you what the options chain actually looks
501.50s: like.
502.58s: And it's for two different things,
505.74s: but I want to show you broader skew.
508.54s: So if we take a look and we rank this by premium.
511.98s: And we take a look over the next couple of explorations.
515.62s: Now this is on the 27th of May.
517.94s: This is after some of the move has started.
521.42s: So this was a little more pronounced leading into the release.
527.14s: But notice how strong the call premium is relative
530.38s: to the put premium to 136,000 in put premium compared
535.18s: to 1.7 million on the call side.
536.82s: This is for this coming expiration 30th of May.
539.70s: Then if we go out to the next expiration,
542.18s: you can see still really big call premium skew.
545.86s: And then again, really big call premium skew.
549.06s: And so on and so forth.
550.70s: So this skew had been present for some time,
554.42s: as I was looking at it.
555.94s: So then the other thing I'm monitoring
557.90s: is the percent change in open interest.
561.30s: And again, this is after the move a little bit.
564.22s: So we're starting to see this winding down
567.14s: to a degree day over day.
569.22s: But this was also really pronounced.
572.38s: So then what I do is I say, OK,
574.34s: I'm seeing interesting positioning going on coming
577.02s: into what might be some sort of known release of information.
582.18s: At this point, when I put on the trade on the 14th of May,
584.98s: the executive orders that Trump announced
587.22s: had not been announced yet, because that was on the 23rd.
590.74s: So it's still kind of quiet.
592.26s: But I can see this positioning going on.
595.74s: Then if I take a look at the actual options feed
599.78s: from the 14th of May, and I'm looking at the call side,
603.34s: I notice that the 60s are getting hit a lot.
607.58s: And most of the larger trades are being bought,
613.62s: which is bullish in nature.
616.46s: So I'm seeing this pretty strong positive build out
620.82s: based on options premium, which, again,
622.86s: all of that ends up leading to my entry into that trade.
628.34s: Now, interestingly enough, the position itself really
632.10s: didn't need to be held for that long.
634.82s: I had originally targeted just outside 5775 in CCJ.
639.30s: That's not where I'm actually going to exit,
641.78s: but it's where I'm going to set profit taking.
644.34s: And the reason for that is because it's
646.02s: outside this next volume node.
648.38s: So this is where the original entry was.
650.66s: And then my expectation was hold as it's rallying.
655.18s: And then the original profit target
657.14s: taking would be, again, about 5775,
660.06s: downside risk management, again, fully defined by the size
663.06s: of the trade, but would have been starting to scale out
665.82s: or below the 48 and a half handle as it fell below this
669.34s: point of control.
670.10s: So it's just a pure directional play.
672.42s: So then we got to move much faster than expected.
676.02s: So in those kind of instances, you'll notice what I did
679.26s: here on the 27th today is I don't actually
683.26s: take the whole thing down, but I take a good portion of it
687.34s: down.
687.86s: And given the size of the move and the velocity
690.42s: against what I already have existing,
693.22s: this trade broadly served its purpose, which
696.30s: is shorter term in nature compared to the other trades.
699.18s: And it's based again on the flow that I saw
702.30s: leading to the position.
703.26s: So this represented a realized piano of 20,720.
708.38s: Again, this is relative to the 2% sizing
710.90s: on the model portfolio I've been sharing with you,
713.26s: the actual position, a bit different sizing than here.
716.38s: Now the remaining risk that exists is 2,520 bucks.
720.26s: So I've already more than paid for the risk that's on.
722.98s: I've secured a profit.
724.66s: So now what I'm doing is just following the trend.
728.34s: And again, I already told you where the profit taking would
731.82s: be done, which is about 5775, for this leg of the trade
735.78s: that was entered here.
736.98s: So that's really what I'm going to monitor from here forward.
739.98s: The main thing I want to attach here for you
741.82s: is using a broader thematic idea, coupling it
745.46s: with using options as some sort of alert.
748.62s: My guess is people started understanding or getting ideas
752.90s: that we might be hearing about the nuclear energy
756.66s: policy with Trump again.
757.98s: It's hard to tell.
759.18s: But seeing that kind of options activity
761.34s: and then just this massive explosion in volume following,
766.74s: it's telling that a lot of times people get pieces of
770.22s: information before it's fully released.
771.74s: And that seems like what might have happened here.
774.34s: So we still have the 10-Lawed out.
775.62s: We'll see how it goes.
776.54s: Like I said, it'll be locked in for a profit
778.38s: no matter what.
779.02s: At this handle, provided that there's no massive gaps
781.10s: down overnight that puts me outside of that.
783.74s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know.
785.42s: Bien Allair.
786.02s: See you later.
