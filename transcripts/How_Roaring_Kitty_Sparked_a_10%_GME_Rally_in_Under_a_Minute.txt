0.68s: what up outliers what up Apes what up
2.72s: outlier Apes it's bring your uh dog Thor
5.68s: to work day you can tell he's clocked in
7.44s: ready to lock in and we're talking about
9.76s: GameStop today you know we have to talk
11.36s: about GameStop and it's because take a
14.12s: look at this big giant candle for today
18.48s: here we are plugging along just cruising
21.08s: along actually hit a low of the day 2615
24.12s: at 10:15 Pacific time and then we get to
27.20s: 10:45 and what do you notice at 10 45
31.00s: Pacific time he saw it he's actually the
32.64s: one that called it out what we see is a
37.08s: massive candle emerg from the ocean we
40.28s: had a low on this candle of 26 27 and a
44.60s: high of
45.92s: 30 yeah 10 plus per move on a single
50.04s: candle within 15 minutes that typically
52.04s: happens on some pretty big news take a
53.44s: look at the volume volume is mellow
56.24s: mellow mellow mellow mellow and then
57.88s: boom massive volume so what happened in
59.76s: this time period you know what happened
64.16s: Boom the cat returns yet again now as
69.84s: most of you hopefully know by now I am
73.04s: but a humble Trader I do not know all of
76.76s: the ins and outs of all these different
78.28s: memes and what they mean I actually have
80.80s: no clue that's your expertise and that's
82.68s: what I lean on you all for to help me
84.72s: with to understand what this might mean
87.04s: cuz I don't know what I do know is that
89.00s: it says time on the top there's a blank
90.92s: screen with this fuzzy thing in it
93.48s: obviously the time thing is very
95.56s: specific we have 420 end time 420 joke
99.36s: and then 109 that's 69 seconds in case
102.32s: those are wondering so
104.08s: 69420 just playing games there that's
106.36s: what I see I don't know how accurate
107.96s: that is and I don't know what this means
109.12s: I also don't know anything about time
110.84s: maybe he's just wanting you to look at
112.12s: the time I don't know any of that so you
115.28s: all will have to tell me what's going on
117.08s: here but I want to talk about what
118.84s: happened in GameStop I want to talk
120.36s: about on a short-term time frame why
122.04s: this move is so interesting and I want
123.52s: to take a look at the options markets
125.56s: because they also hold a couple things
128.64s: that I find Curious so first things
130.68s: first I want to start with this the
133.04s: Tweet comes out at
135.12s: 1045 driving this massive movement cool
138.20s: great let's come into a one minute time
141.20s: frame and
143.12s: 10:45 again so within 60 seconds volume
149.28s: expands from 93,000 the candle before to
154.24s: 1.8 million in 60
158.76s: seconds what I want to highlight here is
162.68s: that ever so clearly is not retail
167.20s: that's not retail that did this this
169.88s: isn't the people on X it's not the
174.84s: people on super ston or other
178.08s: communities that saw this and jumped
180.80s: into The Fray within 60 seconds driving
184.40s: up volume to 1.8 million this highlights
188.80s: the thing a lot of people in GameStop
191.08s: talk about and a lot of people that are
193.12s: external to the GameStop story will kind
195.48s: of look at it and say like yeah whatever
198.04s: and clearly this is automation there's
200.72s: algorithms that are ever so clearly
202.84s: watching everything that happens on his
206.92s: accounts and front running uh
209.48s: perspective Ive move and they were
210.76s: correct whatever things were doing this
212.84s: were correct so let's actually Zoom this
215.60s: in even more because it's kind of
219.12s: fascinating to me so that's within a 5
220.76s: minute time frame we come in here to a
223.00s: one minute time frame let's take a look
225.44s: we have to zoom in a little bit and
228.00s: again right at that 1045 handle of that
231.96s: 1.8 million that I told you about in the
235.28s: five minute candle in this one minute
239.08s: candle it's 1.5 million shares that
242.84s: moved and for context the one minute
246.44s: candles before you can look at the
248.00s: volume 20 and the Volume 5 preceding it
251.28s: the Volume 5 is 319,000 the volume 20 is
254.04s: 92,000 that's the average number of
255.92s: shares over the um prior five and 20
260.04s: minute periods meanwhile this 20-minute
262.72s: period is 1.5
265.20s: million huge huge move and it all
269.08s: happened in insanely fast
271.92s: so that is something I think is
274.92s: generally known that I don't think this
276.28s: is breaking any new ground but it's
278.88s: something that I do feel like Traders
281.32s: absolutely have to be aware of and the
284.16s: reason why I think it's so important for
285.44s: retail traders to be aware of this is
287.12s: because if a retail Trader starts to see
289.36s: this kind of movement the fervor is
292.72s: generally strong and people really want
294.76s: to get in as fast as they can and most
296.76s: of the retail traders that I know
298.52s: there're people that still work normal
300.20s: jobs they're trying to get in on their
302.44s: coffee break or whatever and they're not
304.60s: going to catch this news instantaneous
306.80s: like this is they're going to catch this
308.20s: News 5 minutes late 10 minutes late half
310.28s: hour late few hours late whatever
311.68s: they're going to catch it now during
312.80s: this video and the problem there is by
316.52s: that time so much price action has
319.60s: already occurred driven by automation
322.16s: that by the time retail starts to get in
325.00s: sometimes it can start reversing and
326.80s: selling off right so if you think of the
328.96s: person that checked in on their lunch
330.92s: break and they got in at 11:55 Pacific
333.72s: time well they really saw a rally from
336.28s: 30 to 30 and. 76 cents and then all the
340.16s: way back down to 28 so I just want that
343.08s: message to be known that it's good to be
346.60s: excited it's good to be quick and react
349.32s: to news it's it's unfolding but there's
351.40s: just very clear signs of Automation in
353.68s: here you're not going to outpace that so
356.48s: you have to be kind of judicious in your
358.76s: entry selection here because if you're
361.08s: trying to play the really short-term
362.80s: moves that happen like this you're late
365.32s: to the punch almost inherently just
366.92s: being a retail Trader and if you're
368.76s: anything other than a fully dedicated
370.56s: Trader that's not doing anything other
372.72s: than looking at this you're going to be
373.80s: late I didn't even catch it right away
375.76s: and I watch this stuff like a hawk and I
378.64s: got alerts and stuff like that it takes
380.08s: me a few seconds to open up devices log
381.84s: in whatnot and it's not instantaneous so
386.60s: just keep that in mind because it it's
388.88s: always a bummer for me to see people
390.64s: getting caught with these really high
392.08s: cost basis on a relative level because
395.12s: of this kind of thing but it is
397.12s: something to keep an eyeball on that's
398.76s: for sure so the price today was great
401.64s: and I even talked about this before I
403.12s: think the price the past couple days has
404.40s: been great even though that there's
405.44s: these down moves that doesn't scare me
407.48s: that's normal price movement in a stock
409.44s: you need to see it because there has to
411.04s: be an exchange of supply and demand so
413.36s: the fact that it's been holding these
415.24s: levels the past couple days is beautiful
417.88s: and the fact that it still held it today
419.64s: is also beautiful I definitely don't
421.96s: want to see it drop below 25 and a half
425.32s: so we still have a little time and we
426.76s: are definitely coming in on earnings on
428.76s: the 10th of December which will be a
430.36s: pretty big thing so off over to what I
434.16s: do the options chain so what do we see
437.52s: in here well the first thing I can tell
439.12s: you is the front volatility
442.24s: jacked absolutely jacked it was over 270
446.60s: earlier when I made a post on x I don't
449.68s: know if you call it Xing or tweeting on
452.04s: X do you X on x I don't know what it's I
455.20s: don't know what it is but doing the
457.20s: thing on X this was over 270 and you can
461.12s: see this front expiration is so heavy my
465.00s: guess is the market probably saw that
468.44s: there wasn't massive buying behavior
473.16s: that they thought could have been him
474.60s: which we'll talk about now there was
477.20s: tremendous call volume today massive
479.88s: call volume there is 495,000 calls
482.52s: traded against 91,000 puts so huge huge
485.16s: huge call volume and the overwhelming
488.08s: majority of that volume as expected is
490.76s: in the 6ds and 13d time frames the
493.72s: reason why that's as expected is because
495.24s: whenever we see something like this go
496.76s: on Everybody Plays the front expiration
499.28s: almost always and unfortunately my guess
502.24s: is a lot of these people are just
503.48s: lighting money on fire I never want to
505.04s: see it happen but unless there's some
506.88s: sort of indication of a sustained move
508.92s: or something like that these are going
510.68s: to Decay away super super fast so if we
513.12s: go to 6 December which is tomorrow's
515.24s: expiration we can see like this here
517.12s: there was 60,000 of the 30s that
519.80s: transacted and you can see before today
521.88s: people were unwinding the 30s we
524.32s: literally can see that the net change in
526.16s: oi over yesterday was 100 uh not 100
531.12s: 1,072 so this was pairing down as people
533.60s: were moving out in expirations but today
535.24s: people are just dog piling it massive
537.08s: amounts of people 60,000 volume here
540.04s: so big big big short-term expectations
542.60s: from people and we've seen this before
545.48s: um yeah we we'll kind of see how it goes
547.88s: the thing that I kind of key into from a
550.16s: longer term time frame as I like to
552.20s: look the move up into this has been
555.52s: pretty strong we had a high volume day
557.88s: today which is always a big thing to
560.08s: keep an eyeball on but it's still a
562.88s: little early in my opinion to make any
564.92s: big decisions about whether or not we
566.60s: think that there's going to be a massive
567.92s: continuation here or not
570.00s: that normally takes a few days to
571.64s: transpire right so you can see this even
573.56s: back during these prior expansion
575.12s: periods where volume went from 8.6 to 36
579.00s: so massive volume expansion and then
580.92s: it's still you know trended sideways for
582.60s: a little bit before rocket shipping up
584.32s: and out so this is like really really
586.44s: early days in my opinion to try to
588.52s: identify if anything's going on here so
592.04s: back into the rest of the options though
594.08s: and I wanted to take a look at TNS time
596.68s: and sales see if anything really stuck
598.60s: out to me there
600.08s: and let me show you
603.24s: this when I first when I first posted
607.88s: this and I actually think I can grab it
610.24s: on X from my account here I first posted
615.64s: this and you can see when I posted this
619.32s: this was at 1109 Pacific time I was
622.84s: sorting by premium and the largest
625.28s: premium trades here were 100,000 and
627.44s: change so that's when I first saw this
630.60s: and I thought okay so not like a massive
632.64s: move going on here just yet still kind
634.48s: of early days but we'll see and take a
637.04s: look at what happened the rest of the
638.44s: day we did see some really really big
642.00s: trades come in but a lot of them are at
644.64s: the bid so we have people in 17 Gen 25
648.20s: still 43 days left to go and these are
650.84s: people that almost assuredly are taking
652.88s: these down on pretty big profit because
654.52s: there was a nice big run today I was
656.80s: fortunate I had covered calls not as you
659.72s: all know it's always at a ratio for me
661.44s: but I had short calls against the long
662.80s: shares that I took off as soon as I saw
664.60s: that news cuz they were still on profit
666.36s: I didn't want to get ran over to the
667.56s: upside which I was pleased that I did so
670.32s: lots of people are just managing
671.88s: positions that they're holding on days
673.20s: like this to kind of see how the dust
674.92s: settles but most of the bigger trades
677.12s: that we saw today look like unwinds as I
679.32s: would fully expect there's a little over
681.40s: a half million dollar trade $287,000
683.80s: trade here so big people unwinding in
687.08s: terms of people uring
689.36s: not as big but this one stuck out to me
692.04s: big time 771 days to expiration the 55
696.16s: calls super far out of the money from
698.00s: where it sits now and this is a quarter
699.40s: million dollar trade just very
701.88s: interesting and this is one I'm going to
703.92s: keep an eyeball on this popped on an
705.56s: alert for me for volume over oi but I
708.44s: thought that that was real Curious most
710.56s: of the other trades today were either
712.96s: take a look at this we see another 771
715.40s: day this was 155,000 and then we have
717.72s: some shortterm these are on the B sides
720.12s: for these calls 22 days to expiration 15
722.92s: days to expiration so these are people
724.56s: playing front moves expected front moves
726.40s: 8 Days 8 days is all super short-term
728.60s: time frames so this is interesting to
732.24s: see but there's nothing jumping out at
734.36s: me from an options trading perspective
736.88s: that's like yeah okay something huge is
738.64s: going on here it's just too early to
741.52s: tell I believe now the other thing is
743.52s: looking back over the past couple days
745.24s: this week for context we can see that
748.40s: well one I don't know why oh I guess the
751.00s: data from today isn't integrated yet I
752.96s: don't know why that oh cuz I didn't
754.48s: include today cuz I'm an idiot I was
755.92s: wondering why the volume wasn't
757.80s: there I meant to click this I was like
761.24s: where did everything go uh it's right
763.16s: here so as we looked back through the
766.16s: the rest of this week there was
767.60s: definitely some bigger trades but just
769.88s: overall lighter premium sizing and this
773.36s: has been the case for weeks now we're
774.88s: still seeing things over 100,000 pretty
777.00s: regularly but nothing nothing too
779.24s: noteworthy in my opinion so very very
781.72s: fun I'm very curious to know what you
783.68s: all think the the post was today what
786.28s: that was all about it doesn't look like
788.24s: there's crazy options activity going on
790.24s: in here just yet we know that there was
792.00s: a lot of stock activity going on without
793.80s: a doubt because volume shot up as people
796.88s: were trading but we have to see where it
799.04s: goes from here so let me know what you
800.60s: think the Tweet or X was all about and
803.84s: then also where you think price is going
805.28s: from here and do we close above 30
807.60s: tomorrow that's the big question as
809.80s: always let me know if there's anything
810.88s: you want me to take a look at any
812.04s: questions be an outlier I'll see youall
813.52s: later
