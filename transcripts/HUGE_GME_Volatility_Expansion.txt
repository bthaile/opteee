0.76s: all right you guys I thought today was
2.00s: an off day but GameStop is wellbe in
5.72s: GameStop today I was looking at the
8.72s: options chain kind of going through
10.36s: markets doing my standard scan quiet
13.60s: Wednesday afternoon I thought we were
16.40s: just going to be managing existing
17.76s: positions maybe see if anything weird is
20.20s: going on and then game stopped as this
23.56s: something super weird and I'm curious if
25.68s: you could tell what it is right from
27.60s: what you're seeing here it might be a
28.80s: little difficult to see this one but
30.28s: this is the options chain from today the
33.20s: 19th of June and it's in the evening
35.68s: it's like 7:00 Pacific time and this is
39.72s: what I see that's really super
42.76s: surprising to me at this point there is
45.48s: a 47 Point increase in the volatility in
49.88s: the front expiration cycle that is due
53.64s: to expire in 2 days the market was
56.12s: closed today yet this is up massively
60.24s: from where the market closed yesterday
64.04s: now if you recall from the conversation
66.44s: yesterday the move down here didn't
68.88s: surprise me after the shareholders
70.68s: meeting came through made sense I
72.88s: actually thought after the shares
74.32s: shareholders meeting we would have gone
75.76s: closer to this rate from the jump took
77.56s: an extra day sometimes V bleeds out a
80.32s: little more slowly but then I did not
83.48s: expect at all to see a near 50 point
88.04s: increase in volatility faity with 2 days
90.84s: left to go the other thing is right now
94.68s: I cannot see a clear Catalyst of sorts I
99.56s: genuinely do not know why this would be
102.16s: up 47 points in addition that I also
106.00s: find really interesting is the next
108.68s: expiration cycle also went up 10 points
112.48s: it went from
113.84s: 15124 up to
116.68s: 16117 that is also not an in significant
120.56s: move for something like this it's almost
122.64s: a 10% increase so something again is
127.80s: going on and as I was looking through
130.44s: trying to figure out what this is why
133.28s: this might be happening what this what's
136.12s: driving it I cannot find a clear answer
139.48s: here I don't see anything in the options
141.76s: chain that's absolutely out of place to
144.04s: me we did talk about the series of
146.56s: really large orders at the 30s which is
149.28s: still massive and then the 35s but the
153.52s: problem that these orders are going to
155.08s: face is the insane Theta Decay that
157.92s: they're going to experience over the
159.24s: next couple days so for example the 35s
162.04s: they have 18 19 cents left of total
164.28s: value but the Theta Decay is 17 cents on
166.76s: the day so it means after a day passes
168.80s: essentially these become worthless even
171.04s: the 30s they're going to lose
173.32s: essentially their entire value after the
176.12s: pass of a single day right now they're
177.84s: worth 33 cents they data Decay on them
180.48s: is
181.20s: 27 so unless there's this some sort of
184.16s: massive accommodating move that I still
187.40s: genuinely don't see and as I continue to
190.08s: remind people I am not here to spread
192.84s: hype or fud I'm doing my best just to
196.12s: look at the data and share what I'm
198.36s: seeing and right now I'm confused I
202.12s: don't see what's driving this as a right
203.96s: now so part of the reason for this video
205.44s: is to ask you guys if you're seeing
207.72s: anything that can explain what's
209.48s: happening right now cuz I don't see it
212.04s: now a couple other things that I wanted
214.44s: to take a look at was the volatility
216.68s: smile we've been looking at this pretty
218.16s: regularly together now and one of the
220.76s: things I did notice compared to what I
223.20s: was looking at yesterday was kind of
225.76s: twofold the first thing was this kind of
229.64s: smile on the next week expiration is
233.04s: about the same it flattened out a little
234.96s: bit in the tail but the smile for this
238.36s: expiration did actually see an uptick in
241.80s: the implied volatility being applied to
244.28s: the out-of-the money calls so I can't
247.24s: fully tell if that's just the market
249.32s: kind of dealing with this excessively
251.84s: High open interest with a really short
253.84s: duration left and we need to see what
256.64s: happens to these 70,000 open interest at
260.24s: the 30s because there was 42,000 volume
263.84s: yesterday and these obviously didn't
265.24s: update yet cuz today's not a trading day
266.80s: they'll update tomorrow so I'm really
269.28s: interested to see what this 70,000 turns
272.56s: into and if there's significant buying
276.28s: going on here that does start to get a
278.16s: little interesting we can see that
279.96s: there's a lot of volatility wrapped
281.76s: around this specific strike
284.88s: 28% but again I don't I don't see what's
290.12s: driving us here so interesting find this
293.04s: has even gone up since we were talking
294.64s: literally already it was 20785 when we
298.84s: were looking at it last and it's already
300.20s: up to 20860 so this is not moving an
303.12s: insignificant amount wanted to share it
304.84s: with you guys I don't know exactly
306.80s: what's going on yet but this looks
308.96s: interesting to me so we will see what
311.04s: happens tomorrow catch you guys later
