0.00s: What's up outliers? Time for another market update and figure to share a few pictures, but I want to talk about the indices. I want to talk about the fed rate. I want to talk about how I think about trading the indices when they're behaving as they are.
15.00s: I want to talk about earnings quickly and then I want to touch on some chewy options activity and then seem for game stop. So we have a few things to cover. I'm standing up because my leg is still bothering me and we have our boy, the big white wolf to help us out.
32.00s: I want to talk about the market update and figure to share a few things. I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed
62.00s: uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuout through
92.00s: of rock. This reminds me of like the Pacific Northwest. And then this was another glacier
97.68s: while we were going back from Whittier into Portage through that same funnel. I thought
102.32s: this one was cool because there's a lot of these different little runoff shoots of water
105.68s: kind of running over the black rock, which is a pretty sure volcanic kind of neat. And there's
110.40s: still a lot of this green moss growing, which I think is fun. This is a close-up of a glacier
115.04s: in case you've never seen one. The coloration is really neat. The dark areas is kind of sediment
120.88s: from it burrowing through and pulling through rock and landscape. And then the blue is a function
127.36s: of the compression of water and ice. And it gets to a point where it filters out light differently.
133.52s: And that's kind of what leads to this, which is kind of cool. This was a spot that we stayed. It
140.08s: was right over here. This was our cabin. And it was just another one of these glacial lakes.
146.40s: Just thought it was kind of neat. This is a bunch of glacial runoff actually from a park. We're
151.84s: going to go check out today and go hike and fly the drone a little bit. This is where we're
156.08s: staying now. This is Seward. And our spot is like right down here on the bay. This is a glacier
162.40s: over there. This was where we were staying yesterday, which was, you had to take like an hour
166.72s: boat ride to some year. It's completely off the grid. Very cool spot. But there's a chance to go
171.52s: high-acking, check out some of these waterfalls and stuff, which is really, really cool. So that's
176.08s: what we've been up to now. Let's get into the markets. What's happening? Well, I haven't been trading
180.88s: much. Obviously yesterday I had no service all day. And today I traded some zero-debted ease
185.60s: that went pretty well. I find when the market has slightly higher volatility like this, it can be
192.08s: appealing. But the trades need a little bit of room. And I actually tend to go a little further
198.48s: out of the money to accommodate some additional movement. Now, I also find the behavior
207.44s: between all the indices interesting in terms of how essentially they're in lockstep. Everything
213.44s: from the shape of the candles, they're almost indesernable. And that happens periodically,
220.72s: but not very frequently. You can even see the constitution of the downside is different.
226.64s: So the Russell on the first started to sell off, then it had this gap down day that actually
233.52s: was the slightly positive day. And when you look at the cues and the S&P 500, that was not the case.
239.84s: But then the behavior from essentially the fifth until today has been almost lockstep,
247.28s: which I find interesting. Now, my broad sense here of the indices is I feel like this sell-off
253.84s: needed to happen. I think that this is something, again, that I'd kind of talked about for a while.
258.96s: I think that we had a really, really aggressive ascent. And sooner or later, that has to come to a
266.16s: head and mellow out just a little bit. So that's kind of what I'm seeing here. Now, this decline
272.96s: was a little steeper and faster, specifically in this phase than a normal sell-off might include,
279.44s: but there was some additional events that led to it accelerating to a pretty strong degree.
284.80s: But one thing I noticed almost uniformly is that as we got down to this value area and towards
291.52s: the point of control, I mean, it literally bounced right off of it. And that's because when it got
297.36s: to this level, lots of people became super interested in transacting. And you can see that reflected
303.68s: in the buy volume just going off the shelf here. So the average volume as of the fifth
312.96s: was 57 million. And the total volume on that day was 146 million. So what that tells me is that
321.76s: it got to a point where massive buying pressure started to step in and support it here. So the way
327.84s: I personally would look at this is as a near-term support line. Now again, support turns into
334.00s: resistance as things fall through. There's no real function that keeps things where they are
339.36s: outside of supply and demand. And I think sometimes people get too wrapped up around that idea of
343.44s: I view this as like a support line. And then it falls right through then people are stopped. And to
349.04s: me, it's not dropping. Again, I view technical analysis in the lens of a probabilistic assessment,
355.84s: not deterministic. So the fact that this behave the way it did, again, doesn't surprise me.
361.92s: And I would view this to be an area that it would be more likely to behave like this than not. But
367.84s: that doesn't mean if new information comes out, new bad news, whatever, that it would fly right through.
372.80s: It absolutely can. It always can. So just important to keep that in mind. And I don't know if you
377.12s: guys can hear those seagulls in the background. If you can, they're kind of part of the content,
382.72s: I guess, because there's no way I can stop them. So they hold it to them, I guess. So that's what I see
389.60s: in the S&P 500. It looks like we kind of came off this top a little bit. Then we got to a point
395.84s: where the market became really interested in transacting. And even with this heavy sell-off volume
401.92s: on the seventh, it picked right back up with near total buy volume today. It was 93% by volume.
408.80s: Yesterday was 96% sale volume. So there's just a lot of people countering one another,
414.00s: which is what you want to see in a two-sided market. That's a good thing. But it means that there's
418.80s: a mix of opinions on where things are. Now, my opinion is the sell-off probably found a little bit
426.32s: of a ground here. Now, what would need to happen in order for it to continue? And my opinion would be
432.24s: a change of information. Now, when I think about grading these kinds of things to answer the question
436.88s: that I got in the discord, it really comes down to the broader position that I'm looking to build.
442.08s: For me personally, and anybody that follows the way that I trade something like the coverage
446.16s: triangle, you guys already know that when I see the market near all-time highs, your near-term
451.92s: highs as I like to refer to it more specifically, I'm already lighter on what I'm offering. And that's
458.08s: not because I don't think it's going to go down, but it just means that's not where I want to add a
462.08s: bunch of risk. If I have trades on, I'm not going to take them down because it's at highs. But if I
467.44s: don't have trades on, I'm not going to pile into a bunch of them when we're sitting at highs.
471.92s: That's just asking for trouble. So in this kind of scenario, I had already rotated out of the
477.92s: indices. And for me personally, I'm looking to trade the more so via ratio diagonals at this
483.04s: point, specifically ratio called diagonals, as compared to trading something like the coverage
487.28s: triangle. And that's just because I'm trading the coverage triangle already on T-triple cues.
491.60s: So I have leveraged exposure that I'm running with the smaller subset of capital. That's when I'm
496.32s: using T-triple cues is because the leverage you don't have to add as much. And I'm trading more so
502.64s: the stronger directions in the market, not just maintaining positive drift exposure. And that's
508.88s: just because I think we're in a generally tumultuous time. And I don't want to get stuck kind of
515.12s: holding too much overall market delta here. So what that all summarizes to is one volatility is very
523.84s: high. And that's why I'm trading zero DTEs. You can trade anything really that includes some
529.60s: short of variance risk premiums because the market is priced so rich right now. And I think that
536.08s: that's an interesting trade. I think earnings is another really interesting space right now.
540.40s: I'm going to start slowing down soon, but there's been really good releases that we've seen so far
546.16s: that offer pretty good opportunities. For the markets themselves, I would probably use something
552.00s: like this point of control, again, depending on when I would want to get into something like a diagonal.
557.60s: For me, I'm more interested in something like the Russell for a diagonal. And it's just because
564.16s: I think it's still undervalued compared to the other indices. And I think that the movement we've
569.52s: seen in the Fed leads us to a scenario that obviously had a pull to this back down. And it would
576.00s: not surprise me to see another positive drift up towards the previous five that it posted.
580.88s: Was that just above right at like 2300. So I like the relative opportunity and Russell more. And
587.20s: again, I'm already playing T triple Q's. So that gives me quasi S&P 500 exposure already via
596.08s: the pack overlap heavy tech overlap and also some of the other companies just a little more
600.56s: concentrated. So when I'm looking at something like the Russell though, I do like this to the upside
608.16s: still. And when I look at where it seems to be basing, it's already hit actually, let me grab IWM
615.92s: so that you can see where the points of control are. This is an example that just plumbing right
621.28s: through the point of control couldn't have cared less. And then it did run off of the 200 and start
626.80s: rebounding up off of that. So for me, this starts looking interesting from that perspective using
632.88s: something in there as the downside control depending on how much room you want to give it that
638.48s: obviously will depend on the book specifically. But you could use something really, really tight
643.44s: like this 201 to a two handle or you can use something looser like the 200 day MN. But I think the
649.52s: 200 day MAs is a really, really wrong base to use because it really doesn't drop down through the
658.24s: 200 day MA overly frequently. It did this year and you would have gotten chopped up a little bit,
663.76s: but not a ton. If you're using really short term MAs moving averages and markets like this,
669.52s: you're going to get you're going to get destroyed because things are going to just going to move
673.52s: around way too much. And it's going to be really, really annoying to try to maintain a position
678.40s: if you're trying to hold things too tightly. So one of the things I think about is giving stuff a
683.60s: little bit of room to breathe, sizing things down just a little bit in case it turns back over so
688.40s: that if you do decide to use something that as a wider margin, right, like the 200 day MAs versus
694.16s: this 202 handle, that takes you again, this is down at like 197, 198. So that's a much bigger drop
701.68s: that you would potentially absorb if you use the 200 day. And in that kind of scenario,
707.44s: I would want to size things that would allow me to withstand that kind of drop if I were to use it.
712.56s: For me, when I look at this, I think that's fine. I think using the 200 handles, okay,
716.96s: I'm just expecting to get snapped out. All of that is fully on the table at this point. So
723.60s: the really punchline cliff notes version of this is when markets are trending sideways like this,
730.32s: if you're using things that are too tight, you're going to get chopped up. That's just how it goes.
734.64s: And it's difficult to trade at least a lot of the things that I like to trade in markets like
739.60s: this, like ratio called diagonals, unless you give them more room to move and just size them more
745.92s: appropriately. So that's kind of my two cents on them. Now, the other thing I wanted to take a look
750.80s: at with you are the sectors. And it's because I'm still seeing strength. And I think a lot of times
756.16s: people forget that there is strength out there in markets like this. So right now, the S&P 500
764.16s: coming down obviously, XLB coming down still. But there's a couple of things that actually are
770.88s: hanging in there and providing a bit of strength. XLU utilities is one of them. XLV is another one.
778.40s: XLRE real estate is finally coming into favor, whereas earlier this year, I was fading real estate,
784.56s: but this so far looks good. XLP looks good. So what I'm trying to highlight to you is whether you
790.48s: want to trade something to the upside to the downside, there's opportunities. And what I like to do
794.48s: is find the sectors that are doing what I want in a corresponding timeframe. And then overlay trades,
801.20s: maybe look within this sector and find the more specific, strong performing components to it.
806.40s: Something like that tends to work pretty well for me. So just wanted to share that with you because
810.88s: there are a lot of opportunities. And I'm actually really excited to start trading a bit more
816.40s: actively because of that. Now for me, a lot of the things that still look way, way, way more
821.76s: interesting are these variants for a premium place because they're just so rich right now.
830.32s: I have a percentile in the S&P 500 and 99%. It's extremely elevated, which offers a lot of
841.52s: really interesting opportunities to capture volatility. And this is one of my favorite times
847.84s: to trade stuff like that. If we take a quick look at the VIX, it is coming down. It peaked all the
854.56s: way up at what, 65. It this ran over some of my trades, but I always have defined risk. This is an
861.92s: example where I typically talk to you guys about not liking vertical spreads. There's no chance.
866.16s: You're going to see me short calls in VIX. It's always going to be spread off so that I can with
871.04s: stand stuff like this. And they're now making money. But the cool thing about VIX mean reverting
877.12s: product. It has a lot of very standardized behaviors. And this still is slightly elevated
883.36s: compared to longer term time frames and just. So to me, this actually offers a really interesting
890.80s: opportunity, but it would be generally long deltas that I would want to put on long spy beta-weight
897.04s: adultas. It would be short VIX. But that can be a tough trade to hold, especially if it's not
902.40s: working well. Right. So now let's take a quick look at the Fed. I've fixed the screen darkness,
910.40s: by the way, it should be a little bit better today. That's what this is. But let's take a quick
914.16s: look at the Fed. Now the Fed is now still over 50% probability of a half point rate cut,
921.84s: which is kind of telling that tells us that the market got a little bit overdone. And they're
930.96s: kind of concerned. That's what I see here. Right. So if we look at the probability a week ago
936.40s: of a 50 basis point, it was like 22%. And then a month ago, it was four and a half percent,
941.76s: essentially. Now it's all the way up to 56. It was as high as 69. Look at us go. So the market is now
949.76s: definitely paying close retention to economic data as it's coming out. And we're seeing a bit of a
957.44s: mixed bag. So if we take a look at consumer credit, that actually came in kind of light,
962.32s: surprising to me, but the link ones these are going up, which I find interesting. Though the
966.80s: consumer is using less credit, but they're also defaulting on credit still. So that leads to a
973.04s: pretty constrained environment. And then initial jobless claims came in kind of light. It was expected
977.60s: 241 came in at 233. This is an interesting one because this is kind of like good news is bad news,
982.64s: bad news is good news. It's a mixed bag because we want to see jobless claims actually a little bit
987.52s: higher to again, start pushing the Fed's hand, but their hand is already kind of pushed as you
993.44s: could tell from the bond market. So I don't actually know if this matters quite as much at this point
999.68s: based on what we've seen over the last couple weeks. So that's kind of like a broad market perspective
1006.32s: of what I'm seeing, what I'm thinking. Now let's take a quick look at Chewie. This was asked
1012.24s: because apparently there is some options activity in here that was sticking out to you all. So
1017.92s: I'll take a peek. I haven't looked at this yet. So I don't have anything prepared. I'm kind of
1021.68s: going to look at it real time with you guys. So just from a general chart perspective, very sideways,
1028.16s: very, very sideways, and this doesn't look great for our case position. If he still has it on,
1036.16s: which I'm completely unsure of personally, I have no idea what he's done. Now the reason why I say
1042.88s: that is because I think his average is about like 24 something. You guys will have to correct me.
1048.32s: I don't have the, I don't have all the information at the top of the dome right now because we're
1053.92s: still a little disconnected. But I think it was like 24 something. So here it's down 23 and he had
1060.00s: a big position. It was like 9 million thousand shares. So I think if he's still holding, it's interesting.
1067.36s: And I don't know what you'd be doing. But let's take a look at the option chain. And I also have
1074.64s: unusual wails pulled up for us to take a look at together. So let's see. So in the option chain,
1084.00s: volume is still very call heavy. And it's 261,000 calls against 199 puts. So this is contracted quite a
1093.04s: lot. This used to be a much wider spread with calls very much leading. Now from trading activity
1103.44s: today in terms of quantity, there's some nine all calls going out. I see blocks of like 500. So
1114.16s: decent size positions, but nothing massive. Let's take a look at unusual wails. And we will grab
1122.64s: chewy. And then I'll take a look at it for this week. So you can see what's popping up.
1131.04s: And you see a block of 5,000 of the 30s. That's an interesting one because it does.
1143.04s: So this is just brought to open. This is interesting. So the reason why I think this is interesting
1150.88s: is that a couple things come to my mind. The first one is if this is RK, then it would lead me to
1159.36s: believe that he closed the rest of his stock position because I don't see why he would put these
1168.80s: on unless he's just using options to play the move, which is not outside the realm of possibility.
1174.56s: We've seen him do that. I know a lot of times people seem to assume that he's using options
1181.52s: always to acquire shares. But I've been spending more time going through his history. Again,
1187.04s: I want to be very clear. I still do not consider myself any sort of well versed source of
1192.24s: information of still learning a lot myself. But it seems like he uses options to trade directly
1199.60s: not necessarily always with the intent based on the fingerprint that I've kind of built for him
1204.80s: so far. He kind of has a profile. Now the fact that it's 5,000, I actually don't think that's
1210.80s: his telling his people think. I don't think he's attached to the number 5,000. I think it has
1216.08s: everything to do with the size of the trade that's going on. So when he was building his GME position,
1223.04s: I don't think he was using 5,000 lots because he likes 5,000 lots. I was thinking I think he was
1228.08s: using 5,000 lots as a way to scale into a trade to a size and a premium that makes sense for him.
1235.20s: And this does still fall into this because this 5,000 lot trade is $277,000.
1242.56s: But it's also at the ask so buying more. Which could be. I mean, that really could be
1251.44s: something he would do. It's very hard to say. But I wouldn't immediately assume it is simply because
1258.72s: it's 5,000. I think we would need to see a little bit more than that. Now as far as strike
1264.48s: selection with Chewie at 23, this seems like it would be a little far out of the money for him
1270.16s: based on what I've seen. But again, that doesn't mean it can't be him. And then the other thing I see
1274.24s: is for the DTE 22 DTE a little shorter dated than what I see him buy typically. But again, it could
1281.20s: be him. I'm just going off of historic stuff and trying to connect what I tend. But the other
1287.04s: thing I find, let's take a look at that option chain specifically, which is the 30th 30s.
1293.68s: So let's go to these and these. So there's 225 OI and 11,000 volume today. So that is somebody
1311.76s: making a concerted position. Like if I was watching the market today, all day, this would have popped
1316.00s: up on my scan without it out because it's the exact kind of activity that I looked for. So this
1321.36s: is somebody doing something very specific. Now it's hard for me to tell if this is spread across.
1326.96s: Let's take a quick look at that. If we go to the volume, we can see what happened today.
1331.36s: Let's look in that 30-Aug expiration cycle. So we can see those 30s perched up way up here.
1337.04s: What are these? These aren't 30s. Yeah, okay, these aren't 30s good. If these were 30s, that was
1341.36s: going to be a problem, just in terms of making a guess at what they are. But I mean, the overwhelming
1347.12s: majority volume today in the 30s, in 30, Aug was the 30s. So that's a very specific position
1356.00s: that's being built out. And you can see the 30s are still here. Overwhelmingly, the leader of
1362.32s: all volume, which is interesting. And when is earnings? Oh, it's the 28th. So this could be somebody
1375.04s: making a bet on earnings. This makes more sense now. So that could be another thing. This,
1381.04s: yeah, this trade makes a lot more sense to me now. So because I was curious why we would go to
1387.84s: the 30s, right? As I typically talk to you guys, these weekly explorations won't be as good as
1392.96s: the monthly's in terms of liquidity. But if you explicitly want to be exposed to earnings,
1399.92s: this is the cycle you pick. So if I had to guess now knowing that, this is somebody that wants
1405.92s: to play earnings to the upside. This is a speculative upside-played earnings. And who is it?
1412.64s: We don't know. Could it be somebody like RK? It could be. It absolutely could be. But I have no idea.
1418.48s: All right, now let's take a quick look at GME because there was another
1423.20s: grade that I want to highlight quickly today, which was actually in the put side.
1434.16s: Let's sort this. It should have been up at the top.
1438.24s: I want to make sure I'm not filtering anything else.
1440.96s: Yeah, so let's take a look at this to this. I'm looking at the seventh to the eighth.
1449.92s: I'm looking at calls and puts, the bid or the offer. Wait, is this just picking up GM?
1459.44s: I don't know why this is just saying GM there. Because that's also not the right price.
1468.72s: This is showing 42 bucks, but it did GME. Let me refresh this.
1474.64s: Yeah, it did just pick up GM. I was wondering because the trade I was looking at wasn't there.
1478.96s: And there it is. So this is what I want to show you.
1482.64s: I'm keeping the dates open on purpose because something really weird is happening right now
1489.52s: with these 125s, something really, really weird. So you can see on the sick,
1495.28s: there was a bunch of 125 puts that were sold to open. Then we can see on the seventh,
1502.72s: there was more 125s that went out a bunch. And then if we look at the 125s for today,
1513.44s: 110 of them were at the ask. So this to me looks like somebody that sold to open here and then
1522.72s: bought to close here. Now, why this trade went the way it did? I really don't know. It's very weird
1529.92s: to me. The reason why it's so weird is I don't know why we would waste the time and effort to put
1536.72s: on 110 of these 125s if this is the same person, which I'm speculating. It's a guess, just guess it,
1542.96s: but it seems like it's probably the same person. And I see this total size going on. And then I see
1550.64s: it going on again. And then a day later, essentially coming off at 103 80. So the position
1560.00s: would have been sold to open for about 104 and a half there, 104 10 there. So like 104 and change,
1566.08s: 104 and a quarter on average, probably. And it looks like some of it came down today for 103 80.
1572.00s: So if we sold to open here, bought to close here, that's actually making a few bucks. Interestingly.
1577.20s: So I'm keeping a closer eye and I really need to spend a little more time digging into those to
1582.56s: try to figure out what the overall behavior is. But I just found that really interesting to go
1587.60s: through the effort of building this position and then essentially taking it off after a few pennies
1591.20s: of a move. It seems like this position went on to serve another purpose. And I don't know what,
1596.24s: but that is partially what seems to be going on there because, yes, seeing a good part of it came
1602.88s: down today. So let's 1.14 million in premium. So yeah, that's what I'm seeing from GME. I wanted to
1610.56s: update you on that trade. Now let's take a quick look at the GME option. Just to see if anything
1617.28s: interesting is going on in here. If we take a look at open interest, 724 K against 366 love that.
1624.40s: So we are now just about at 2 to 1, which again is that more bullish configuration that I typically see
1630.96s: and the overwhelming majority is out there at 16. So to me, that's really where this gets more
1636.08s: interesting. It seems like next week's expiration is becoming much more engaged and we're seeing the
1642.72s: critical mass of options hanging out there. The 125s are busy as per usual, but we also see a couple
1650.96s: other cycles that are pretty aggressive here. So the 30s have what is that 32,600 contracts. So
1660.16s: that's a big strike. The 25s have 22,800. And then the what is this? The 40s? Yep. The 40s have
1668.40s: almost 20,000. So there's a lot of exposure out there for next week. And what does that look like
1675.76s: in terms of total? Yeah, it's like 250,000 calls against 100,000 puts. So it makes me really
1683.84s: interested. I'm very, very interested in what we see going on there. If we take a quick look at the
1689.76s: chart, it's good to see game stops starting to base and move up a little bit, but it has a way
1697.68s: to go before I would call this any sort of return to value or kind of fending back towards the
1703.28s: short term price mean because this now looks like a bit of a floor that's baked in, but we have
1711.04s: to keep a really close eye on it. It did hit this value area and people were interested in it quite
1716.64s: a lot there. And then if we take a look at the volume today, volume is still really, really light,
1724.40s: but there's more buy volume, but there's just it's so light. There is 55.4 million with 88%
1732.96s: being buy, which is great, but buy volume is pretty light. Now still based on averages that I see
1739.60s: that's like 70% plus are being routed off exchange. So that volume isn't obviously hitting
1746.64s: here. It's not helping us understand price discovery near real time, but I would be interested to see
1753.20s: on exchange volume starts to peak back up, but that's what we're seeing so far for game stop.
1759.28s: As always, if there's anything that you want me to take a look at, you have any questions,
1762.88s: just let me know being outlier. See you guys later.
