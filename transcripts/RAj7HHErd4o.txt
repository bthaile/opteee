 What's up outliers? Time for another market update and figure to share a few pictures, but I want to talk about the indices. I want to talk about the fed rate. I want to talk about how I think about trading the indices when they're behaving as they are. I want to talk about earnings quickly and then I want to touch on some chewy options activity and then seem for game stop. So we have a few things to cover. I'm standing up because my leg is still bothering me and we have our boy, the big white wolf to help us out. I want to talk about the market update and figure to share a few things. I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about all the fed rate and then I want to talk about the fed rate and then I want to talk about things like Tahira is a huge company who couldn't sell the stock companies out. He sold all the fed rates and then I want to talk about how much real nicotine functionalizing that is sold all the fed rates and then there's this source... And I want to talk about how much real nicotine is pure that grow off of this little tiny thin piece of rock. This reminds me of like the Pacific Northwest. And then this was another glacier while we were going back from Whittier into Portage through that same funnel. I thought this one was cool because there's a lot of these different little runoff shoots of water kind of running over the black rock, which is a pretty sure volcanic kind of neat. And there's still a lot of this green moss growing, which I think is fun. This is a close-up of a glacier in case you've never seen one. The coloration is really neat. The dark areas is kind of sediment from it burrowing through and pulling through rock and landscape. And then the blue is a function of the compression of water and ice and a guess to a point where it filters out light differently. And that's kind of what leads to this, which is kind of cool. This was a spot that we stayed. It was right over here. This was our cabin. And it was just another one of these glacial lakes just thought it was kind of neat. This is a bunch of glacial runoff actually from a park. We're going to go check out today and go hike and fly the drone a little bit. This is where we're staying now. This is Seward. And our spot is like right down here on the bay. This is a glacier over there. This was where we were staying yesterday, which was, you had to take like an hour boat ride to some Europe. It's completely off the grid. Very cool spot. But there's a chance to go eye-acking, check out some of these waterfalls and stuff, which is really, really cool. So that's what we've been up to now. Let's get into the markets. What's happening? Well, I haven't been trading much. Obviously yesterday I had no service all day. And today I traded some zero-ditae's that went pretty well. I find when the market has slightly higher volatility like this, it can be appealing. But the trades need a little bit of room and I actually tend to go a little further out of the money to accommodate some additional movement. Now, I also find the behavior between all the indices, interesting in terms of how essentially they're in lockstep. Everything from the shape of the candles, they're almost indesernable. And that happens periodically, but not very frequently. You can even see the constitution of the downside is different. So the Russell on the first started to sell off, then it had this gap down day that actually was the slightly positive day. And when you look at the cues and the S&P 500, that was not the case. But then the behavior from essentially the fifth until today has been almost lockstep, which I find interesting. Now, my broad sense here of the indices is I feel like this sell off needed to happen. I think that this is something, again, that I had kind of talked about for a while. I think that we had a really, really aggressive ascent. And sooner or later, that has to come to a head and mellow out just a little bit. So, that's kind of what I'm seeing here. Now, this decline was a little steeper and faster, specifically in this phase. Then, you know, a normal sell off might include, but there is some additional events that led to it accelerating to a pretty strong degree. But one thing I noticed almost uniformly is that as we got down to this value area and towards the point of control, I mean, it literally balanced right off of it. And that's because when it got to this level, lots of people became super interested in transacting. And you can see that reflected in the buy volume, just going off the shelf here. Right? So the average volume as of the fifth was 57 million. And the total volume on that day was 146 million. So, what that tells me is that it got to a point where massive buying pressure started to step in and support it here. So, the way I personally would look at this is as a near term support line. Now, again, support turns into resistance as things fall through. There's no real function that keeps things where they are outside of supply and demand. And I think sometimes people get too wrapped up around that idea of I view this as like a support line. And then it falls right through then people are stopped. And to me, it's not dropping. Again, I view technical analysis in the lens of a probabilistic assessment, not deterministic. So the fact that this behave the way it did, again, doesn't surprise me. And I would view this to be an area that it would be more likely to behave like this than not. But that doesn't mean if new information comes out, new bad news, whatever, that it would fly right through. It absolutely can. It always can. So just important to keep that in mind. And I don't know if you guys can hear those seagulls in the background. If you can, they're kind of part of the content, I guess, because there's no way I can stop them. So, say hello to them, I guess. So, that's what I see in the S&P 500. It looks like we kind of came off this top a little bit. Then we got to a point where the market became really interested in transacting. And even with this heavy sell-off volume on the seventh, it picked right back up with near total buy volume today. It was 93% buy volume. Yesterday was 96% sale volume. So there's just a lot of people countering one another, which is what you want to see in a two-sided market. That's a good thing. But it means that there's a mix of opinions on where things are. Now, my opinion is the sell-off probably found a little bit of a ground here. Now, what would need to happen in order for it to continue? And my opinion would be a change of information. Now, when I think about trading these kinds of things to answer the question that I got in the Discord, it really comes down to the broader position that I'm looking to build. For me, personally, and anybody that follows the way that I trade something like the Carver Strangle, you guys already know that when I see the market near all-time highs, your near-term highs, as I like to refer to it more specifically, I'm already lighter on what I'm offering. And that's not because I don't think it's going to go down, but it just means that's not where I want to add a bunch of risk. If I have trades on, I'm not going to take them down because it's at highs. But if I don't have trades on, I'm not going to pile into a bunch of them when we're sitting at highs, that's just asking for trouble. So in this kind of scenario, I had already rotated out of the indices. And for me, personally, I'm looking to trade the more so via ratio diagonals at this point, specifically ratio called diagonals, as compared to trading something like the Carver Strangle on. That's just because I'm trading the Carver Strangle already on T-Triple Cues. So I have leveraged exposure that I'm running with a smaller subset of capital. That's when I'm using T-Triple Cues is because the leverage you don't have to add as much. And I'm trading more so the stronger directions in the market, not just maintaining positive drift exposure. And that's just because I think we're in a generally tumultuous time. And I don't want to get stuck kind of holding too much overall market delta here. So what that all summarizes to is one volatility is very high. And that's why I'm trading zero DTEs. You can trade anything really that includes some short of variance risk premiums because the market is priced so rich right now. And I think that that's an interesting trade. I think earnings is another really interesting space right now. I'm going to start slowing down soon. But there's been really good releases that we've seen so far that offer pretty good opportunities for the markets themselves. I would probably use something like this point of control again depending on when I would want to get into something like a diagonal. For me, I'm more interested in something like the Russell for a diagonal. And it's just because I think it's still undervalued compared to the other indices. And I think that the movement we've seen in the Fed leads us to a scenario that obviously had a pull to this back down. And it would not surprise me to see another positive drift up towards the previous five that it posted. Was that just above right at like 2300. So I like the relative opportunity in Russell Moore. And again, I'm already playing T-Triple Q's. So that gives me quasi S&P 500 exposure already via the pack overlap heavy tech overlap. And also some of the other companies just a little more concentrated. So when I'm looking at something like the Russell though, I do like this to the upside still. And when I look at where it seems to be basing, it's already hit. Actually, let me grab IWM so that you can see where the points of control are. This is an example that just plummet right through the point of control. Couldn't have cared less. And then it did run off of the 200 and start rebounding up off of that. So for me, this starts looking interesting from that perspective using something in there as the downside control depending on how much room you want to give it that obviously will depend on the book specifically. But you could use something really, really tight like this 201202 handle or you can use something looser like the 200 day MN. But I think the 200 day MAs are really, really wrong base to use because it really doesn't drop down through the 200 day MN overly frequently. It did this year. And you would have gotten chopped up a little bit, but not a ton. If you're using really short term MAs, moving averages and markets like this, you're going to get destroyed because things are going to just going to move around way too much. And it's going to be really, really annoying to try to maintain a position if you're trying to hold things too tightly. So one of the things I think about is giving stuff a little bit of room to breathe, sizing things down just a little bit in case it turns back over so that if you do decide to use something that is a wider margin, like the 200 day MAs versus this 202 handle, that takes you again. This is down at like 197-198. So that's a much bigger drop that you would potentially absorb if you use the 200 day. And in that kind of scenario, I would want to size things that would allow me to withstand that kind of drop if I were to use it. For me, when I look at this, I think that's fine. I think using the 202 handles okay, I'm just expecting to get snapped out. All of that is fully on the table at this point. So the really punchline cliff notes version of this is when markets are trending sideways like this, if you're using things that are too tight, you're going to get chopped up. That's just how it goes. And it's difficult to trade at least a lot of the things that I like to trade in markets like this, like ratio called diagonals, unless you give them more room to move and just size them more appropriately. So that's kind of my two cents on them. Now the other thing I wanted to take a look at with you are the sectors. And it's because I'm still seeing strength. And I think a lot of times people forget that there is strength out there in marketplaces. So right now, the S&P 500 coming down obviously, XLB coming down still, but there's a couple of things that actually are hanging in there and providing a bit of strength. XLU utilities is one of them. XLV is another one. XLRE real estate is finally coming into favor, whereas earlier this year I was fading real estate, but this so far looks good. XLP looks good. So what I'm trying to highlight to you is whether you want to trade something to the upside to the downside, there's opportunities. And what I like to do is find the sectors that are doing what I want in a corresponding time frame and then overlay trades maybe look within this sector and find the more specific strong performing components to it. Something like that tends to work pretty well for me. So just wanted to share that with you because there are a lot of opportunities and I'm actually really excited to start trading a bit more actively because of that. Now for me, a lot of the things that still look way, way, way more interesting are these variants for premium place because they're just so rich right now. IVP, IV% tile and the S&P 500 is 99%. It's so high. It's extremely elevated, which offers a lot of really interesting opportunities to capture volatility. And this is one of my favorite times to trade stuff like that. If we take a quick look at the VIX, it is coming down. It peaked all the way up to what 65? It this ran over some of my trades, but I always have defined risk. This is an example where I typically talked to you guys about not liking vertical spreads. There's no chance. You're going to see me short calls in VIX. It's always going to be spread off so that I can withstand stuff like this. And they're now making money. But the cool thing about Dex mean reverting product. It has a lot of very standardized behaviors. And this still is slightly elevated compared to longer term time frames and just. So to me, this actually offers a really interesting opportunity, but it would be generally long deltas that I would want to put on long spy beta-weighted deltas. It would be short VIX. But that can be a tough trade to hold, especially if it's not working well. Right. So now let's take a quick look at the Fed. I've fixed the screen darkness, by the way, it should be a little bit better today. That's what this is. But let's take a quick look at the Fed. Now, the Fed is now still over 50% probability of a half point rate cut, which is kind of telling that tells us that the market got a little bit overdone and they're kind of concerned. That's what I see here. Right. So if we look at the probability a week ago of a 50 basis point, it was like 22%. And then a month ago, it was four and a half percent, essentially. Now it's all the way up to 56. It was as high as 69. Look at us go. So the market is now definitely paying closer attention to economic data as it's coming out. And we're seeing a bit of a mixed bag. So if we take a look at consumer credit, that actually came in kind of light, surprising to me, but the link when these are going up, which I find interesting. Though the consumer is using less credit, but they're also defaulting on credit still. So that leads to a pretty constrained environment. And then initial jobless claims came in kind of light. It was expected at 241, came in at 233. This is an interesting one because this is kind of like good news is bad news, bad news is good news. It's a mixed bag because we want to see jobless claims actually a little bit higher to again start pushing the Fed's hand, but their hand is already kind of pushed as you could tell from the bond market. So I don't actually know if this matters quite as much at this point based on what we've seen over the last couple of weeks. So that's kind of like a broad market perspective of what I'm seeing, what I'm thinking. Now let's take a quick look at Chewie. This was asked because apparently there is some options activity in here that was sticking out to you all. So I'll take a peek. I haven't looked at this yet. So I don't have anything prepared. I'm kind of going to look at it real time with you guys. So just from a general chart perspective, very sideways, very, very sideways. And this doesn't look great for our case position. If he still has it on, which I'm completely unsure of personally, I have no idea what he's done. Now, the reason why I say that is because I think his average is about like 24 something. You guys will have to correct me. I don't have the, I don't have all the information at the top of the dome right now because we're still a little disconnected. But I think it was like 24 something. So here, it's down 23 and he had a big position. It was like 9 million thousand shares. So I think if he's still holding, it's interesting. And I don't know what you'd be doing. But let's take a look at the option chain. And I also have unusual wails pulled up for us to take a look at together. So let's see. So in the option chain, volume is still very call heavy. And it's 261,000 calls against 199 puts. So this is contracted quite a lot. This used to be a much wider spread with calls very much leading. Now, from trading activity today in terms of quantity, there's some nine all calls going out. I see blocks of like 500. So decent size positions, but nothing massive. Let's take a look at unusual wails. And we will grab a chewy. And then I'll take a look at it for this week. So and see what's popping up. Did you see a block of 5,000 of the 30s? That's an interesting one because it does. So this is just brought to open. This is interesting. So the reason why I think this is interesting is that a couple of things come to my mind. The first one is if this is okay, then it would lead me to believe that he closed the rest of his stock position because I don't see why he would put these on unless he's just using options to play the move, which is not outside the realm of possibility. We've seen him do that. I know a lot of times people seem to assume that he's using options always to acquire shares. I've been spending more time going through his history. Again, I want to be very clear. I still do not consider myself any sort of well versed source of information. I'm still learning a lot myself. But it seems like he uses options to trade directly and not necessarily always with the intent based on the fingerprint that I've kind of built for him so far. He kind of has a profile. Now the fact that it's 5,000, I actually don't think that's as telling as people think. I don't think he's attached to the number 5,000. I think it has everything to do with the size of the trade that's going on. So when he was building his GME position, I don't think he was using 5,000 lots because he likes 5,000 lots. I was thinking I think he was using 5,000 lots as a way to scale into a trade to a size and a premium that makes sense for him. And this does still fall into this because this 5,000 lot trade is $277,000. But it's also at the ask so buying more. Which could be. I mean, that really could be something he would do. It's very hard to say. But I wouldn't immediately assume it is simply because it's 5,000. I think we would need to see a little bit more than that. Now as far as strike selection with Chew Yet 23, this seems like it would be a little far out of the money for him based on what I've seen. But again, that doesn't mean it can't be him. And then the other thing I see is for the DTE 22DTE a little shorter dated than what I see him buy typically. But again, it could be him. I'm just going off of historic stuff and trying to connect what I tend. But the other thing I find, let's take a look at that option chain specifically, which is the 30th 30s. So let's go to these and these. So there's 225 OI and 11,000 volume today. So that is somebody making a concerted position. Like, if I was watching the market today all day, this would have popped up on my scan without it out. Because it's the exact kind of activity that I looked for. So this is somebody doing something very specific. Now it's hard for me to tell if this is spread across. Let's take a quick look at that. If we go to the volume, we can see what happened today. Let's look in that 30-Aug expiration cycle. So we can see those 30s perched up way up here. What are these? These aren't 30s. Yeah, okay, these aren't 30s good. If these were 30s, that was going to be a problem. Just in terms of making a guess at what they are. But I mean, the overwhelming majority volume today in the 30s, in 30, Aug was the 30s. So that's a very specific position that's being built out. And you can see the 30s are still here overwhelmingly the leader of all volume, which is interesting. And when is earnings? Oh, it's the 28th. So this could be somebody making a bet on earnings. This makes more sense now. So that could be another thing. This, yeah, this trade makes a lot more sense to me now. So because I was curious why we would go to the 30s, right? As I typically talk to you guys, these weekly expiration won't be as good as the monthly's in terms of liquidity. But if you explicitly want to be exposed to earnings, this is this is the cycle you pick. So if I had to guess now knowing that, this is somebody that wants to play earnings to the upside. This is a speculative upside play earnings. And who is it? We don't know. Could it be somebody like RK? Could be. It absolutely could be. But I have no idea. All right, now let's take a quick look at GME because there was another grade that I want to highlight quickly today, which was actually on the put side. It should have been up at the top. I want to make sure I'm not filtering anything else. Yeah, so let's take a look at this to this. I'm looking at the seventh to the eighth. And I'm looking at calls and puts the bid or the offer. Wait, is this just picking up GM? I don't know why this is just saying GM there. Because that's also not the right price. This is showing 42 bucks, but I did GM. Let me refresh this. Yeah, it did just pick up GM. I was wondering because the trade I was looking at wasn't there. So this is what I want to show you. I'm keeping the dates open on purpose because something really weird is happening right now with these 125s, something really, really weird. So you can see on the sick, there was a bunch of 125 puts that were sold to open. Then we can see on the seventh, there was more 125s that went out a bunch. And then if we look at the 125s for today, 110 of them were at the ask. So this to me looks like somebody that sold to open here and then bought to close here. Now why this trade went the way it did? I really don't know. It's very weird to me. The reason why it's so weird is I don't know why we would waste the time and effort to put on 110 of these 125s if this is the same person, which I'm speculating. It's a guess, just guessing. But it seems like it's probably the same person. And I see this total size going on. And then I see it going on again. And then a day later, essentially coming off at 10380. So the position would have been sold to open for about 104 and a half there, 104104, 10 there. So like 104 and change 104 and a quarter on average, probably. And it looks like some of it came down today for 10380. So if we sold to open here, bought to close here, that's actually making a few bucks. Interestingly. So I'm keeping a closer eye. And I really need to spend a little more time digging into those to try to figure out what the overall behavior is. But I just found that really interesting to go through the effort of building this position and then essentially taking it off after a few pennies of a move. It seems like this position went on to serve another purpose. And I don't know what, but that is partially what seems to be going on there because guessing a good part of it came down today. So let's 1.14 million in premium. So yeah, that's what I'm seeing from GME. I wanted to update you on that trade. Now let's take a quick look at the GME option. Just to see if anything interesting is going on in here. If we take a look at open interest, 724k against 366. Love that. So we are now just about at 2 to 1, which again is that more bullish configuration that I typically see. And the overwhelming majority is out there at 16. So to me, that's really where this gets more interesting. It seems like next week's expiration is becoming much more engaged. And we're seeing the critical mass of options hanging out there. The 125s are busy as per usual. But we also see a couple other cycles that are pretty aggressive here. So the 30s have what is that 32,600 contracts. So that's a big strike the 25s have 22,800. And then the what is this the 40s? Yep, the 40s have almost 20,000. So there's a lot of exposure out there for next week. And what does that look like in terms of total? Yeah, it's like 250,000 calls against 100,000 puts. So it makes me really interested. I'm very, very interested in what we see going on there. If we take a quick look at the chart, it's good to see game stops starting to base and move up a little bit. But it has a way to go before I would call this any sort of return to value or kind of fending back towards the short term price mean. Because this now looks like a bit of a floor that's baked in. But we have to keep a really close eye on it. It did hit this value area and people were interested in it quite a lot there. And then if we take a look at the volume today, volume is still really, really light. But there's more buy volume. But there's just it's so light. There is 55.4 million with 88% being buy, which is great. But buy volume is pretty light. Now still based on averages that I see that's like 70% plus are being routed off exchange. So that volume isn't obviously hitting here. It's not helping us understand price discovery near real time. But I would be interested to see if on exchange volume starts to peak back up. But that's what we're seeing so far for game stop. As always, if there's anything that you want me to take a look at, you have any questions. Just let me know be an outlier. See you guys later.
