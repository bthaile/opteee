0.00s: I have a question for you. Do you know how you actually make money in trading? I asked this because
7.20s: I had a conversation in my discord a couple days ago that really reminded me that a lot of people
11.92s: have kind of these different notions about where and how they make money but they really don't
17.76s: understand at a base level the function that leads to making money and I'm going to walk you through
24.32s: three ways to actually make money in the stock market and know one of the ways to make money isn't
30.08s: day trading. You can lose money day trading so what I hope to do is to get us to a better understanding
37.28s: of the actual functions that lead to making money so that you can spend more time focusing on developing
44.00s: those functions so that you can make more money. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all
48.32s: the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible so that my
53.12s: video editor can make these fun for all of us to watch and yeah so you guys are paying him so
58.56s: he thanks you. Let's take a look at what I'm talking about here. I want to start with some level
63.20s: setting. This was from the discord. Now I blanked out the dude's name because this isn't meant to drag
68.32s: anybody. This is literally meant to have a conversation because my guess is the vast majority of people
73.60s: would answer this the same way. So here I ask him what are ways that you can conceive of that a
79.44s: trader can make money in the market two to three is fine. Now to be clear, three is not an exhaust
84.24s: a list. There's plenty of ways to make money in the stock market but I'm going to talk about three
87.68s: broad functions and I wanted to see if I could get this person even close to any of them because
93.44s: a couple of them are pretty common ones. And their response was many things day trading futures,
99.20s: swing trading options, buy and hold stocks. Now when I read this I immediately saw what was going on.
105.52s: They were completely disconnected from what actually makes money versus activities. You can buy
112.80s: and hold a stock that goes down. You don't make money. You can swing trade options and not make
118.56s: money. You can day trade futures and not make money. These the specific futures options stocks.
124.72s: Those are just products. Buy and hold is a strategy. Swing trading is a type of strategy. Day
129.20s: trading is a type of strategy. None of those inherently lead to making money. So again my hope is
134.40s: to get people to a closer understanding of what functions actually make money because in this
140.96s: example, if I were to ask this trader, how do you make more money? They might say, well,
144.96s: you need to day trade futures more. That probably actually is the worst thing they could possibly do.
149.04s: The worst idea I ever heard. But they view that as a way to make money. So let's get to the heart
155.20s: and soul of what's happening here. I ask what are the actual functions that lead to making money
161.04s: and they responded with trading by and sell, which is kind of reiterating this slightly different.
165.52s: And then I kind of pointed out what I just pointed out to you that none of these essentially
169.28s: inherently lead to making money. Another thing I saw in the option subreddit was this. I've built
174.96s: together this option strategy. It seems to guarantee a profit. Let's just completely pretend that
181.92s: guarantee at least was spelled correct in the context of talking about something that automatically
187.52s: makes a profit in option trading. Now, to be clear, if you was trading long box spreads in a
192.64s: European style cash settled index like SPX, technically that does guarantee a profit. But then the
198.24s: second sentence quickly tells us that's not what he's talking about. So anyways, the point being
202.48s: is this also doesn't guarantee anything. So what are some other commonly cited ways to make money
209.52s: in the stock market that are incorrect? Well, faded decay. That's not you can lose money while you
215.20s: are gaining faded decay. So no, that's not one. Stelling options and buying options, neither of
220.00s: though inherently leads to profit being long gamma that does not inherently lead to making profit.
226.24s: The point being is that these are all different measures of how things behave or these are different
230.72s: strategies. These are different products. But this isn't how money is made. There is a giant
237.36s: disconnect for people between these two things. And I continue to beat this point to death because I
243.12s: think it is so important for traders to be able to clearly articulate simply how they're making
249.20s: money so that you can make more money. You can optimize whatever that thing is. But if we can't even
256.08s: identify the thing that we need to optimize, then what do we even do in here? So now let's talk about
263.28s: these three methods. The first one, direction. This is a really common approach to trading stocks,
269.84s: for example. You can look at something like the Kanslin method where they create a system that
275.68s: structured around very careful timing so that they can buy things that what they consider to be a
281.36s: low risk entry and then buy low sell high. That is absolutely a way to make money. You can also
289.44s: short stocks selling high and buying low. You can also do this with volatility. If you think volatility
294.64s: is overpriced or underpriced, you could buy or sell it. But direction is one of the oldest tricks
300.00s: in the book. And being directionally correct is absolutely a function that can lead to making money
307.04s: trading. Now notice how I have a couple bullet points here, though. And I think these are important
311.28s: to call out because you can be good at determining direction in a bunch of different capacities. You
316.72s: can have a very high win rate, but a low average win and moderate losses that in aggregate is
324.48s: positively expected. You could have another scenario where you actually have a very low win rate.
329.60s: You could be right 25% of the time. But if your winning trades are big enough, you can still make money.
334.96s: So this is why I believe in this scenario, there's two things that we really need to focus on is
341.28s: getting good at determining direction in some capacity, but then also intertwining managing money
347.04s: effectively, being able to follow winning trades. If that's your style, being able to capture a certain
352.64s: win amount if you're trying to hit a higher win rate, but directional trading is a really common one.
357.36s: The next one we have is risk assumption. So this is kind of also known as structural alpha. And
363.12s: this is where we assume other people's risk. This is the very commonly cited risk premia
371.36s: in option trading. Now there are other ways you can assume risk for people. There are other
376.00s: kinds of structural alpha that just risk premiums is one of them. And this is essentially the force
381.20s: where if we take a look at spy here, we go 29 days out, just picking an expiration and we look at
386.16s: the 443 puts that's oh I'm sorry, let's look at the 445s. The 445s are a 34 delta. And those are
393.36s: trading for $3.84 for the 445s, 34 delta. Now if we look at the corresponding 34 delta calls,
399.84s: same expiration, those are only trading for 297. So why is there an extra dollar essentially on
405.76s: these puts that's puts queue? That is structural alpha. This is showing us that the theoretical
412.16s: understanding of options pricing is not what happens in the markets because people are willingly
417.84s: overpaying for puts. And that's for a bunch of different reasons. This is why things like this do
424.24s: exist because a lot of the times when we talk about the stock market, we talk about it in the
428.48s: context of a theoretical vacuum where everything's perfect, everybody's a rational actor, but we know
433.36s: markets are not rational. And we also know that there are a lot of players that have a bunch of
439.12s: rules they have to follow. If you're a pension fund manager and you want to keep your job next
443.84s: quarter, you can't have big draw downs. So they would rather overpay for downside protection so that
449.76s: they can keep their job and sacrifice some profit potential knowing that they're inefficiently
454.16s: buying that protection. They don't care. So this is a way for retail traders to make money. Is
460.00s: you can assume that risk for other people? One example, this right here, selling cash-secured puts.
465.68s: We know in general, there are variance risk premiums baked into put options because of put skew
471.84s: and also implied volatility tends to be priced over realized volatility. So both of those put together
478.32s: can lead to a way to make money. So how can you make money doing this? We have to study this idea of
482.72s: risk premium. Then you have to figure out how you want to capture it and then you have to optimize it.
486.40s: But this is the second method. Let's take a look at the third method. We have inefficiencies.
490.24s: Now this one's interesting because some here are more available to traders than others. So for example,
495.28s: something like mispricing. This could be a market maker turns on their quote machine and literally
500.08s: it has the wrong price. That is insanely improbable. It's not frequent at all and your capacity
506.72s: want to spot it fast enough to then trade it is essentially zero. It's not impossible entirely.
512.56s: But it's so insanely unlikely. There are literally algos that are looking for stuff like that.
517.20s: And if you think about really these kind of two styles of trading assuming risk or looking for
522.96s: structural alpha or looking for inefficiencies, you're kind of providing a service in all of these
528.24s: circumstances. Because here the service you're providing is taking somebody else's risk. Here,
532.88s: let's say if you could catch one of these mispricings, you are then normalizing prices to what they
537.44s: should be in a set marketplace. Then there's things like cross exchange arbitrage. This is where you
542.96s: find something on one exchange that might be trading expensive and you sell it and you buy it on
547.36s: another exchange where it's trading cheaply. Here you are normalizing prices, but you are also
552.24s: providing liquidity. That's another service you're providing. Value dissonance is interesting.
556.80s: Because this is kind of when we can clearly see and have a system to assess when a move is overdone.
564.64s: And there is a break from the current price of something and whatever you perceive the value to be.
570.16s: Because again, going back to periods of mania like GameStop where that was a short squeeze that
576.56s: turned into a bit of a pump and dump where people are still waiting for the mother of all squeezes
580.72s: to come up and there are different forces that happen there. But during that squeeze there's value
585.60s: dissonance that starts to occur where nobody looks at that and says GameStop is worth this. Nobody
590.48s: thinks that. But because of structural forces in the markets and artificial manipulation we saw this
595.60s: giant moving price and you could have either rode it to the upside or taken the short to the
600.24s: downside when it eventually did collapse. But you can find ways to look for value that's just
605.28s: completely out of whack and to place a trade on it. There's also things like Pied and no this is
610.80s: not what you do with your boyfriend in the bathtub on the weekends. This is positive earnings
615.92s: announcement drift. This is a really well studied force where after an earnings release if something
621.12s: is a really great release and a giant beat to the upside there's certain parameters that have to be met
626.08s: and there are studies that you can find on SSRN on this exact thing that over the next quarter they
631.84s: tend to go on and have outsized returns. That's because the market is not efficient enough to price
637.44s: in that new information quickly enough and it takes time for it to be digested that's exactly what
642.48s: leads to this. That is a potential way for you to make money as a trader. The point here is every
649.04s: single one of these things is tied to a way discreetly to make money. If you are directionally correct
655.92s: if you are able to price and take risk for other people providing a service or if you can find
661.12s: different types of these efficiencies. There's all different kinds of these and then if you have
666.72s: any questions on how do you build a strategy around this well I have a video that I'll throw in the
670.96s: link in the notes below on this exact thing that really goes into building an option strategy in depth.
676.24s: However this is the general flow that you're going to take so let's say that your profit mechanism
681.12s: is being directionally correct. Your hypothesis is one of two things one of three things you could pick
685.60s: whatever your hypothesis is but let's just say your hypothesis is that you can use technical
690.24s: analysis whatever indicators you choose to be correct 51% of the time. That would lead to a
695.36s: profitable outcome provided that you manage your money effectively. So then you can test that
699.44s: hypothesis you can test those tools you can test your money management you can test other tools
703.84s: other management other alternatives to see what actually works best. Then you figure out which one
710.08s: of those combinations offers the greatest opportunity then you can live test that track the
715.04s: results and optimize. None of this is easy. Trading is not supposed to be easy that's why there's
719.76s: an opportunity here. The barrier to entry is so low anybody can start. Imagine if it was so easy
725.92s: to make money. There would be nothing left to pick up off the ground. You have to look in the
730.48s: difficult places you have to spend the time thinking through these things so that you can outsmart
735.84s: other participants because it is a competitive landscape. This is exactly the art of trading. You
742.08s: have to get used to it. So these are three ways you can actually make money trading. Like I said
745.84s: there's plenty more but I wanted to give you something you can bite on to that most people could
749.76s: probably wrap their head around fairly reasonably but it's always if you have any questions let me know
755.04s: don't forget like subscribe share be an outlier. See you guys later.
