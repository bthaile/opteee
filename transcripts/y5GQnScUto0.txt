0.00s: What up outliers, what up apes, what up outlier apes.
3.68s: It's bringing your dog Thor to work day.
6.40s: You could tell he's clocked in ready to lock in.
8.96s: And we're talking about GameStop today.
10.52s: You know we have to talk about GameStop.
12.48s: And it's because take a look at this big giant candle
17.24s: for today.
18.48s: Here we are plugging along, just cruising along,
21.56s: actually hit a low at the day, 2016, 15, at 10, 15,
24.92s: Pacific time.
26.04s: And then we get to 10, 45.
28.40s: And what do you notice at 10, 45, Pacific time?
31.56s: He saw it.
32.24s: He's actually the one that called it out.
34.64s: What we see is a massive candle emerged from the ocean.
40.00s: We had a low on this candle of 26, 27 and a high of 30.
46.76s: Yeah.
47.68s: 10 plus percent move on a single candle within 15 minutes.
51.48s: That typically happens on some pretty big news.
53.32s: Take a look at the volume.
54.72s: Volume is mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow.
57.56s: And then boom, massive volume.
58.96s: So what happened in this time period?
60.68s: You know what happened?
62.36s: Boom.
65.16s: The cat returns yet again.
68.36s: Now, as most of you hopefully know by now,
72.20s: I am like a humble trader.
74.64s: I do not know all of the ins and outs of all these different memes
78.64s: and what they mean.
80.00s: I actually have no clue.
81.20s: That's your expertise and that's what I lean on.
83.28s: You all for to help me with to understand what this might mean.
87.16s: I don't know.
88.12s: What I do know is that it says time on the top.
90.20s: There's a blank screen with this fuzzy thing in it.
93.40s: Obviously the time thing is very specific.
96.00s: We have 420 and time 420 joke and then 109.
100.48s: That's 69 seconds and casals are wondering.
103.12s: So 69 420 just playing games there.
106.16s: That's what I see.
107.16s: I don't know how accurate that is and I don't know what this means.
109.12s: I also don't know anything about time.
110.84s: Maybe he's just wanting you to look at the time.
112.60s: I don't know any of that.
113.88s: So you all will have to tell me what's going on here.
117.28s: But I want to talk about what happened in GameStop.
119.84s: I want to talk about on a short term time frame.
121.84s: Why this move is so interesting.
123.32s: And I want to take a look at the options markets
125.52s: because they also hold a couple of things that I find curious.
129.68s: So first things first, I want to start with this.
132.80s: The tweet comes out at 1045 driving this massive movement.
137.84s: Cool. Great.
138.84s: Let's come into a one minute time frame and 1045.
143.84s: Again, so within 60 seconds volume expands from 93,000
150.84s: the candle before to 1.8 million in 60 seconds.
159.84s: What I want to highlight here is that ever so clearly is not retail.
166.84s: That's not retail that did this.
169.84s: This isn't the people on X.
173.84s: It's not the people on Superstank or other communities
178.84s: that saw this and jumped into the fray within 60 seconds
183.84s: driving up volume to 1.8 million.
186.84s: This highlights the thing a lot of people in GameStop talk about
191.84s: and a lot of people that are external to the GameStop story
194.84s: will kind of look at it and say like, yeah, whatever.
197.84s: And clearly this is automation.
199.84s: There's algorithms that are ever so clearly watching everything
203.84s: that happens on his accounts and front running perspective move.
209.84s: And they were correct.
210.84s: Whatever things were doing this were correct.
213.84s: So let's actually zoom this in even more because it's kind of
218.84s: fascinating to me.
219.84s: So that's within a five minute time frame.
221.84s: We come in here to a one minute time frame.
224.84s: Let's take a look.
225.84s: Let's take a look at the zoom in a little bit.
228.84s: And again, right at that 10 45 handle of that 1.8 million
233.84s: that I told you about in the five minute candle.
237.84s: In this one minute candle, it's 1.5 million shares that moved.
244.84s: And for context, the one minute candles before you can look
248.84s: at the volume 20 and the volume five preceding it.
251.84s: The volume five is 319,000.
253.84s: That's the average number of shares over the prior five
258.84s: and 20 minute periods.
260.84s: Meanwhile, this 20 minute period is 1.5 million.
265.84s: Huge, huge move.
267.84s: And it all happened insanely fast.
270.84s: So that is something I think is generally known that I don't
275.84s: think this is breaking any new ground.
277.84s: But it's something that I do feel like traders absolutely
281.84s: have to be aware of.
283.84s: And the reason why I think it's so important for retail traders
285.84s: to be aware of this is because if a retail trader starts
288.84s: to see this kind of movement, the fervor is generally strong
293.84s: and people really want to get in as fast as they can.
295.84s: And most of the retail traders that I know,
297.84s: they're people that still work normal jobs.
299.84s: They're trying to get in on their coffee break or whatever.
303.84s: And they're not going to catch this news instantaneously like this is.
306.84s: They're going to catch this news five minutes late,
308.84s: ten minutes late, half hour late, few hours late, whatever.
311.84s: They're going to catch it now during this video.
313.84s: And the problem there is by that time,
316.84s: so much price action has already occurred driven by automation
321.84s: that by the time retail starts to get in,
324.84s: sometimes it can start reversing and selling off.
327.84s: So if you think of the person that checked in on their lunch break
330.84s: and they got in at 1155 Pacific time,
333.84s: well, they really saw a rally from 30 to 30 and 76 cents
338.84s: and then all the way back down to 28.
340.84s: So I just want that message to be known that it's good to be excited.
345.84s: It's good to be quick and react to news.
348.84s: It's just unfolding, but there's just very clear signs of automation in here.
352.84s: You're not going to outpace that.
354.84s: So you have to be kind of judicious in your entry selections here.
358.84s: Because if you're trying to play the really short term moves that happen like this,
363.84s: you're late to the punch almost inherently just being a retail trader.
366.84s: And if you're anything other than a fully dedicated trader that's not doing anything
370.84s: other than looking at this, you're going to be late.
372.84s: I didn't even catch it right away.
373.84s: And I watched this stuff like Hawk.
375.84s: And I got alerts and stuff like that.
377.84s: It takes me a few seconds to open up devices, log in, whatnot.
380.84s: And it's not instantaneous.
382.84s: So just keep that in mind.
385.84s: Because it's always a bummer for me to see people getting caught with these really high-cost
390.84s: basis on a relative level because of this kind of thing.
394.84s: But it is something to keep an eyeball on.
397.84s: That's for sure.
398.84s: So the price today was great.
400.84s: And I even talked about this before.
402.84s: I think the price to pass couple days has been great.
404.84s: Even though there's these down moves that doesn't scare me.
406.84s: That's normal price movement in a stock.
408.84s: You need to see it because there has to be an exchange of supply and demand.
411.84s: So the fact that it's been holding these levels the past couple days is beautiful.
416.84s: And the fact that it's still held it today is also beautiful.
419.84s: I definitely don't want to see it drop below 25 and a half.
423.84s: So we still have a little time and we are definitely coming in on earnings on the 10th of December,
428.84s: which will be a pretty big thing.
430.84s: So off over to what I do.
433.84s: The options chain.
435.84s: So what are we seeing here?
437.84s: Well, the first thing I can tell you is the front volatility jacked.
442.84s: Absolutely jacked.
444.84s: It was over 270 earlier when I made a post on X.
448.84s: I don't know if you call it Xing or tweeting on X.
452.84s: Do you X on X?
453.84s: I don't know what it's I don't know what it is, but doing the thing on X.
457.84s: This was over 270 and you can see this front expiration is so heavy.
463.84s: My guess is the market probably saw that there wasn't massive buying behavior
471.84s: that they thought could have been him, which we'll talk about.
474.84s: Now there was tremendous call volume today.
478.84s: Massive call volume.
480.84s: There is 495,000 calls traded against 91,000 puts.
483.84s: So huge, huge, huge call volume.
485.84s: And the overwhelming majority of that volume as expected is in the 6D and 13D time frames.
492.84s: The reason why that's as expected is because whenever we see something like this go on,
496.84s: everybody plays the front expiration almost always.
499.84s: And unfortunately my guess is a lot of these people are just lighting money on fire.
503.84s: I never want to see it happen, but unless there's some sort of indication of a sustained move
508.84s: or something like that, these are going to decay away super, super fast.
512.84s: So if we go to 6 December, which is tomorrow's expiration, we can see like this here,
516.84s: there was 60,000 of the 30s that transacted.
519.84s: And you can see before today, people were unwinding the 30s.
523.84s: We literally can see that the net change in OI over yesterday was 100, not 100,
528.84s: 1,072.
530.84s: So this was pairing down as people were moving out in expirations,
534.84s: but today people are just dog piling it massive amounts of people, 60,000 volume here.
539.84s: So big, big, big short term expectations from people.
542.84s: And we've seen this before.
545.84s: Yeah, what we'll kind of see how it goes.
547.84s: The thing that I kind of key into from a longer term time frame is I like to look.
552.84s: The move up into this has been pretty strong.
555.84s: We had a high volume day today, which is always a big thing to keep an eyeball on.
561.84s: But it's still a little early in my opinion to make any big decisions about whether or not we think
566.84s: that there's going to be a massive continuation here or not.
569.84s: That normally takes a few days to transpire.
571.84s: Right.
572.84s: So you can see this even back during these prior expansion periods,
575.84s: where volume went from 8.6 to 36.
578.84s: So massive volume expansion.
580.84s: And then it's still, you know, trend its sideways for a little bit before rocket shipping up and out.
584.84s: So this is like really, really early days in my opinion to try to identify if anything's going on here.
590.84s: So back into the rest of the options though.
593.84s: And I wanted to take a look at TNS time and sales see if anything really stuck out to me there.
599.84s: And let me show you this.
603.84s: When I first, when I first posted this and I actually think I can grab it on X from my account here.
613.84s: I first posted this and you can see when I posted this, this was at 1109 Pacific time.
621.84s: I was sorting by premium and the largest premium trades here were 100,000 in change.
627.84s: So that's when I first saw this and I thought, okay, so not like a massive move going on here just yet still kind of early days, but we'll see.
635.84s: And take a look at what happened the rest of the day.
638.84s: We did see some really, really big trades come in, but a lot of them are at the bid.
645.84s: So we have people in 17 Jan 25 still 43 days left to go.
649.84s: And these are people that almost assuredly are taking these down on pretty big profit because there was a nice big run today.
656.84s: I was fortunate I had covered calls not covered as you all know it's always at a ratio for me, but I had short calls against the long shares that I took off as soon as I saw that news because they were still on profit.
665.84s: I didn't want to get ran over to the upside, which I was pleased that I did.
669.84s: So lots of people are just managing positions that they're holding on days like this to kind of see how the dust settles.
675.84s: But most of the bigger trades that we saw today look like unwinds as I would fully expect there's a little over a half million dollar trade, $287,000 trade here.
683.84s: So big people unwinding in terms of people occurring not as big, but this one stuck out to me big time.
692.84s: 771 days to expiration the 55 calls super far out of the money from where it sits now and this is a quarter million dollar trade.
700.84s: Just very interesting and this is one I'm going to keep an eyeball on this popped on an alert for me for volume over OI.
707.84s: But I thought that that was real curious.
709.84s: Most of the other trades today were either take a look at this.
713.84s: We see another 771 day this was 155,000 and then we have some short term these are on the buy sides for these calls 22 days expiration 15 days expiration.
723.84s: So these are people playing front moves expected front moves eight days eight days is all super short term time frames.
729.84s: So this is interesting to see, but there's nothing jumping out at me from an options trading perspective.
736.84s: That's like yeah, okay, something huge is going on here.
739.84s: It's just too early to tell I believe now the other thing is looking back over the past couple days this week for context.
746.84s: We can see that well one I don't know why I guess the data from today is an integrated yet.
752.84s: I don't know why that oh because I didn't include today because I'm an idiot.
755.84s: I was wondering why the volume wasn't there.
757.84s: I meant to click this.
760.84s: I was like where did everything go.
762.84s: That's right here.
763.84s: So as we look back through the the rest of this week, there is definitely some bigger trades, but just overall lighter premium sizing.
772.84s: And this has been the case for weeks now.
774.84s: We're still seeing things over 100,000 pretty regularly, but nothing nothing to know where they in my opinion.
780.84s: So very, very fun.
781.84s: I'm very curious to know what you all think the the post was today.
785.84s: What that was all about.
786.84s: It doesn't look like there's crazy options activity going on in here just yet.
790.84s: We know that there was a lot of stock activity going on without a doubt because volume shot up as people were trading, but we have to see where it goes from here.
798.84s: So let me know what you think the tweet or X was all about and then also where you think price is going from here.
804.84s: And you'd be close above 30 tomorrow.
806.84s: That's the big question.
807.84s: As always, let me know if there's anything you want me to take a look at any questions.
811.84s: Be an outlier.
812.84s: I'll see you all later.
