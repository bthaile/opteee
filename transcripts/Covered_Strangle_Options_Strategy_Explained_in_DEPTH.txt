0.56s: what's up everybody eric here time for a
2.72s: reboot on my favorite strategy the
4.88s: coverage strangle my goal is to do a
7.76s: in-depth but quick video so i'm gonna
10.56s: try to run through all of it within 10
12.32s: minutes my other more in-depth videos
15.12s: will still exist they're just a little
16.56s: older i want to go over some new details
19.04s: so if you want the more in-depth version
21.60s: check that out i'll throw a link up here
23.36s: and then also in the video description
24.96s: below but otherwise let's get straight
27.28s: to this trade
29.68s: so this is hands down my favorite
31.44s: strategy i deploy this almost ah man
35.68s: tough to say i would argue at least 70
38.72s: of my trades i do ebb and flow based on
41.36s: market conditions obviously but this is
43.76s: just such a utilitarian trade that is so
46.16s: good in so many different circumstances
48.48s: and my favorite part about the trade is
51.44s: the way that i define an edge in the
53.76s: trade is via management that's not me
56.64s: being any sort of great stock picker
58.88s: being able to guess direction it is the
61.20s: ability to structure well-developed
63.28s: trades that take advantage of different
65.68s: option pricing and just option
68.24s: conditions to try and increase the
70.88s: overall success of the strategy um and i
74.00s: would say between this and diagonals of
76.80s: some sort these are hands down the vast
79.36s: majority of my trades
81.20s: so what is the coverage strangle or the
83.60s: cash secured strangle as my mentor likes
85.68s: to refer to it as essentially we're
87.68s: going to start with the cash secured put
89.36s: then we're going to roll to a covered
90.72s: call and then we add another cash
93.28s: secured put on top of that so let's take
96.16s: a quick look at what this flow chart
98.24s: looks like so it's easy to conceptualize
100.96s: and then we're going to go through the
102.48s: rest of the details how we're going to
104.00s: set the trade up where we're going to
105.36s: look what kind of things we want to see
107.04s: how we're going to management and then
108.48s: some notes at the end
109.84s: so like i said we're going to start with
111.20s: the cash secure put so this means that
112.64s: we're going to sell a put and we are
115.12s: expecting to be assigned if things go
117.60s: poorly that doesn't mean that we're
118.88s: going to be assigned it doesn't mean
120.24s: that we're not going to defend and roll
121.76s: a position but it means that we are
123.52s: prepared to be assigned
125.52s: a couple really important implicit
127.76s: components to that
129.44s: the main one being is you don't mind the
131.92s: underlying that you're going to be
133.28s: trading and a lot of people that trade
135.04s: puts they always say oh i don't mind
136.48s: ownership but then as soon as the stock
138.56s: drops 15
140.00s: their put
141.12s: is you know 10 down they're like well i
144.96s: don't want it here that that's not how
147.12s: that works
148.32s: so it's really important to truly like
151.68s: what you are holding because if you're
153.36s: gonna get a sign on a cash secured put
155.36s: it means that the underlying is going to
157.28s: be trading below your strike a lot of
160.32s: people like to say oh well if i just
161.92s: sell a put i'll buy the stock at a
163.28s: discount yeah you're going to get it at
165.12s: a discount to the current price but if
167.52s: you're getting assigned it means that
169.36s: you're at a premium to the to the then
171.76s: price because your put has to be in the
174.16s: money so it's just important to keep
175.84s: that in mind so if we sell that put the
178.80s: easiest scenario here is that it's going
180.40s: to be out of the money or we're going to
182.80s: manage it at a profit
184.48s: and then that leads us back to the cash
186.56s: secure put and you just kind of recycle
188.80s: those the other scenario is you're in
191.28s: the money
192.56s: now my first approach when we're in the
194.88s: money is to look to roll the trade which
198.00s: we will get into detail in a minute but
200.56s: essentially rolling is just a way for us
202.72s: to close out that existing trade we are
205.04s: going to book a loss however we are
208.24s: going to establish a new trade that has
211.60s: a profile that allows us to take in an
213.76s: overall credit so that we can make money
216.08s: on the entire trade without being
218.16s: assigned that being said
220.40s: weight can also be assigned
222.08s: so if you take a look at the assigned
225.12s: tree over here there's two segments we
227.84s: have the covered call side and then an
230.00s: additional cash secured put so this cash
232.96s: secured put that you see here simply
235.04s: follows this tree that we already went
237.52s: over essentially everything up there
240.72s: now while the cash secured put side is
243.36s: relatively straightforward the covered
245.60s: call side isn't anything too crazy we're
247.84s: just compiling combining two different
249.44s: strategies at the same time so for the
251.44s: covered call you're gonna sell
253.36s: short calls against the long stock that
255.76s: you're assigned on those covered calls
258.24s: there's two potential outcomes the first
260.64s: one is those covered calls the short
262.24s: calls are out of the money meaning your
264.56s: calls are either managed at a profit or
266.32s: expire worthless
268.32s: and then you just do it again sell
270.64s: another covered call as long as you have
273.92s: the ability to collect some money which
275.52s: i'll also explain in a little bit
277.60s: for
278.40s: the in the money side if they fall in
280.16s: the money that's perfect that's best
281.44s: case scenario here we don't want to do
283.60s: anything we want to let them expire in
285.68s: the money
286.80s: the long stock that you now have will be
289.28s: called away and then essentially you
291.36s: just circle your butt right back up to
294.00s: the start here and do it all again
295.76s: so the true power in this strategy
298.64s: comes in multiple forms it's definitely
300.80s: management and part of the management
303.28s: approach here that's really important to
305.04s: understand is sometimes you have to wait
309.12s: nobody likes to do that in trading it
311.28s: doesn't feel very sexy or fun but that
313.60s: is important and the reason why mit
316.16s: waiting is important is because let's
318.88s: say that we're assigned and we have long
321.44s: 100 shares of xyz and our basis is 10
325.68s: and right now it's trading at six
328.24s: we're not going to be able to sell
329.68s: covered calls
331.20s: above our 10 basis if the underlying is
334.24s: trading at six at a 40 discount to where
336.64s: we're at right now if you try to sell
338.80s: short calls there
340.64s: more likely than not you're gonna get
342.72s: two cents three cents for a 50-day trade
345.60s: it's not enough money in my opinion to
347.44s: cap your potential upside
349.44s: in those circumstances my preference is
352.72s: to wait you said at the onset of the
355.68s: trade that you're comfortable holding
357.04s: the underlying do it because
360.24s: if we start trying to sell calls too
362.80s: early let's say we do get a rally now
365.68s: those calls might be trading at two
367.44s: dollars you got two cents for them just
370.16s: because you want to try to collect
371.76s: something right at your basis and that
374.40s: leads to the next problem you want to be
376.80s: able to sell your covered calls above
379.04s: your basis
380.40s: so if we are assigned at the same
383.04s: example at 10
384.88s: and the underlying is trading at six
387.60s: you don't want to trade short calls
389.76s: ideally at 10. you want to be able to
392.08s: have some capital gains on the short
393.60s: calls so you're going to want to be
395.20s: selling them
396.24s: at 12 or 13. you need to give the trade
399.68s: a little room to the upside
401.92s: all right let's move on to the setup
404.24s: these are the things that i look for in
405.60s: general this isn't an all-inclusive list
407.44s: but this is a general guideline to help
409.60s: give you some ideas the punchline here
412.08s: is you are wanting to trade things that
414.16s: are liquid and that you don't mind
416.08s: holding for real for real again not just
418.00s: saying it but you really mean it so
419.84s: these are products that you might be
421.12s: holding for a year two years three years
423.36s: find products that fit that profile for
425.76s: you so i tend to use sector etfs or
431.04s: index etfs those are my favorite as
432.88s: anybody knows that follows the channel
434.72s: iwm is typically my go to
437.28s: and you can also i also venture into
440.24s: individual s p 500 stocks and that's
442.48s: just because there's some inherent
443.84s: screening going on there if it's within
445.84s: the s p 500 it tends to be a pretty
448.00s: strong company so you can find
450.48s: reasonable things in there instead of
452.56s: kind of just chasing premiums and
454.72s: selling some random ass stock that is
457.20s: paying a bunch of money
458.72s: ps they pay a bunch of money for a
460.32s: reason it's because it's super volatile
463.04s: um and it helps eliminate some of just
466.48s: unnecessary risk in my opinion
468.72s: so i do like to look for things that
470.40s: have weeklies a lot of times that will
472.24s: indicate a certain level of liquidity
474.40s: because the occ and just the exchanges
477.28s: in general don't immediately offer
479.44s: weeklies there has to be enough demand
481.12s: volume there that's not to say that
483.28s: weeklies can't be illiquid that does
486.24s: happen you have to check it but in
488.08s: general it's a good place to start
490.56s: now this is a short premium strategy so
493.52s: i tend to prefer higher implied
495.28s: volatility percentile something higher
497.68s: than 25 typically is good the main
500.24s: reason for this is you don't want to get
501.68s: stuck in a bad position where you sell
504.64s: some premium and then iv expands even
507.76s: further and then you lose potential
509.44s: profits or you're seeing an unrealized
511.76s: loss unnecessarily so keep an eye on
514.48s: that you definitely don't want to sell
516.00s: these in really really low
518.08s: implied volatility percentile
519.92s: environments it just sets you up for
521.52s: failure in kind of two ways right you
523.12s: have directional risk and then you also
524.88s: have volatility expansion risk in this
528.08s: trade so we want to limit that
530.24s: price and trend super important also
533.12s: side note it's already eight minutes 50
535.04s: seconds in there's zero percent chance
536.64s: i'm going to finish this in 10 minutes
538.00s: so i'm sorry
539.52s: um
540.80s: but for price and trend
542.72s: this is there's kind of two ways i think
544.56s: about it sometimes i will go with the
547.20s: catching of falling knife where i'm
549.36s: looking for some sort of trend reversal
551.92s: i want to see something that is kind of
554.88s: making big declines maybe
557.44s: on a three month chart is declining but
560.56s: on a six month one month it's up
562.40s: trending a couple really important just
564.72s: general technical analysis tools that i
566.64s: look at again these help inform
568.80s: decisions they're not hard rules but i
571.20s: prefer it to be generally uptrending so
573.28s: that means
574.24s: short term moving average above midterm
576.56s: above long term i also definitely prefer
579.36s: price above the long term and midterm if
582.64s: it's below the short term i'm a little
584.00s: more flexible on that
585.60s: i also want to make sure that it's
587.76s: trending up at least on a yearly chart
590.80s: preferably on a six month annual yearly
594.00s: i also like to look at some fundamentals
596.56s: so to make sure that we have growing
598.48s: free cash flow if it's an individual
600.48s: stock i want to make sure that there are
603.68s: growing sales those are really important
605.68s: for longer term trades shorter term
607.84s: trades within a year the multiple tends
609.84s: to drive a lot of the price performance
611.76s: so it's another thing i like to look at
613.76s: multiple something around or below
616.32s: industry averages so for the short put
619.84s: itself when i'm sending that out the
621.20s: door i like something that has at least
623.20s: a one percent return on an invested
625.04s: capital so you can take a look at
627.20s: whatever total premium you're going to
628.88s: need to cash secure that position figure
631.04s: out the credit you're going to receive
632.32s: divide the credit buy whatever it is to
634.56s: cash secure that position and that's how
636.00s: you get your return on invested capital
638.48s: dividend optional
640.16s: i like to look for something with the
641.76s: dividend if it has one and it's still
644.16s: something that i like i'm not gonna go
645.76s: chasing them but it is something i'm
647.52s: aware of if i have two products that are
650.00s: essentially equal in most dimensions and
652.32s: one pays a dividend one doesn't i'm
654.00s: gonna go for the one with the dividend
655.36s: kind of straightforward there
657.28s: then we get into a little bit of
659.44s: management here so let's throw the rest
662.48s: of this up i want to talk about these
664.80s: two
665.68s: and how this fits in with the rest of
668.00s: our management plan
669.36s: so for management
671.36s: max profit is going to be whatever the
673.36s: credits you receive over the life of the
675.04s: trade plus the capital gain on the stock
677.20s: max loss technically is unlimited
679.36s: however a stock can only go to zero so
682.16s: that is your max loss if it goes to zero
684.80s: now when we're looking at entering this
687.52s: trade we find what we like we need to
689.68s: figure out our trade allocation and then
692.40s: our initial outlay this is an important
695.68s: concept so when we're trading like an
698.32s: index etf i don't mind allocating a lot
701.28s: of the portfolio to that because if i'm
703.68s: for a while i would trade levered in
706.16s: something like iwm
708.24s: and then if i was assigned on 100 had to
710.88s: close some for a loss but then i was
712.72s: just gonna sit on a hundred percent of
715.28s: my portfolio and iwm no problem with
717.44s: that whatsoever it's an index etf i'll
719.60s: hold it for 10 years if i have to
721.52s: doesn't typically happen but
723.68s: what i'm saying is make sure that your
725.60s: allocation is a size that you're
727.28s: comfortable with based on what you're
728.64s: trading if you're trading individual
730.64s: stocks i like to use no more than eight
732.88s: percent of the account in an individual
734.88s: stock sometimes it might flow to ten
736.72s: percent but that's about it not so much
738.96s: anymore normally it's way smaller than
740.80s: that probably you know two to five
743.36s: percent just because i don't really
745.28s: venture into individual stocks a whole
747.20s: lot at this point there's not a huge
749.20s: drive for it but i do on occasion and
752.16s: that's where i look for
753.76s: and then your outlay
755.52s: is how much of that allocation are you
757.52s: going to use
758.40s: when you're setting the trade up and
760.24s: then you're scaling is how are you going
762.48s: to add additional capital to the trade
764.08s: so let's say that you set 50 000 aside
766.88s: for a trade
768.16s: and let's say on your outlay you use
771.20s: twenty thousand means that you have
772.96s: thirty thousand dollars left when are
775.20s: you going to use that thirty thousand
776.96s: dollars that's what scaling is
779.12s: so let's talk about how those two look
781.60s: based on this right here entry off of
784.80s: delta so normally i'm going to enter my
788.16s: cash secured put with a 3
791.36s: or 0.3 or 0.4 delta typically somewhere
794.96s: between the two and what i find is that
797.28s: gives me a good balance between the
799.76s: premium i'm receiving as well as
803.76s: not necessarily fighting every single
806.16s: trade that i have on the higher your
807.60s: delta the higher the probability is that
809.12s: you're going to be managing that trade
810.40s: at some point
811.52s: but the higher delta the more you're
813.36s: going to get paid for it the other thing
815.60s: to make sure that you're doing when
817.44s: you're checking out these credits that
819.12s: you're going to be getting is check the
820.80s: theoretical price it is another way to
823.52s: confirm if you are paying too much or
826.80s: too little for an option really easy to
829.04s: do that you can use a black trolls
830.56s: calculator in excel you can add it to
833.20s: your platform that's what i have on as
835.12s: well just because it's quick and
836.24s: convenient but it is important to take a
838.16s: look at that in conjunction with your
840.00s: implied volatility percentile level
842.16s: because
843.60s: your theoretical
845.12s: pricing gives you an idea if you're
846.64s: slightly overpaying slightly underpaying
849.04s: or if you're grossly overpaying grossly
851.52s: underpinks you want to avoid those
852.88s: ladders
854.48s: all right let's talk about percentage
856.64s: off of highs and then how that ties to
858.80s: your outlay so we talked about that 50
861.44s: 000 allocation instead of just saying
864.00s: well i'm going to use 20 000 i like to
866.40s: use some guidelines to inform my
868.72s: decision making so in this instance
870.88s: let's say that i'm trading iwm and we're
873.84s: greater than 40 off of all-time highs
876.32s: i'll use 90 even 100 of that allocation
881.04s: on the initial outlay
883.44s: if we are less than that i tend to use
886.24s: smaller outlays the reason for this is
888.64s: again just an assessment of risk if
891.68s: we're 10
892.72s: off of all-time highs or recent highs
896.08s: there's probably a pretty good chance at
897.92s: least at some point within the next year
899.60s: or two that there's going to be a
900.72s: pullback i don't want to be fully
902.96s: invested during that pullback because
905.04s: scaling
906.32s: is an important part of managing these
909.28s: trades
910.56s: so
911.68s: what scaling allows us to do
914.16s: is to remain sensitive to the the basis
917.76s: of the underlying so if we're trading
921.20s: something like iwm and it starts to drop
924.32s: by scaling in via additional cash
926.64s: secured puts that are below our basis
930.00s: one we have an opportunity to continue
932.08s: to realize profit i have a video that is
934.96s: that compares the wheel to this strategy
938.00s: and it explains this exact point i'll
940.16s: link to that up here for you all as well
942.40s: but essentially
943.76s: by remaining and having capital ready to
946.24s: use during a down move it's an extremely
948.48s: advantageous position to be in
951.52s: all right so let's slide over to just
953.92s: general management typically i'm going
955.76s: to manage these at 60 credit received or
959.04s: if we're within a week and i see
961.60s: something between 30 and 50 max profit i
964.64s: might take that trade down it really
966.48s: depends on the broader market
968.16s: circumstances how many trades i have out
970.24s: how much risk i'm trying to take in or
972.72s: expose myself to but just some general
975.92s: ideas to use
977.68s: the other thing is once we start getting
979.36s: around 20 days to expiration normally i
982.00s: will offer these out at you know 50
986.00s: something between 30 and 50.
988.24s: and if we start getting within 20 so 18
992.24s: days
993.12s: it's important to note that our gamma
995.44s: risk over here starts to raise
997.84s: significantly gamma risk is just the
1000.00s: rate of change of delta as we get closer
1002.08s: to expirations options that are out of
1004.64s: the money want to move to a zero delta
1007.92s: options that are in the money want to
1009.44s: move to a 1 delta x that's where they're
1010.96s: going to approximate at expiration
1013.68s: so it's important to know that once we
1015.76s: get within 20 days
1017.36s: gamma or your delta is going to move
1020.40s: very quickly so that's why that window
1023.44s: is something at least for me to look at
1025.28s: again none of this is hard written in
1027.44s: stone never deviate but it is important
1029.60s: to know
1030.96s: now let's talk about
1032.64s: this section here when we're rolling or
1035.28s: assigned
1036.48s: if we're gonna roll that's typically my
1038.72s: first preference simply because if we're
1042.08s: rolling it means that we're being
1043.36s: challenged it's hard to know
1045.28s: when we're at the bottom of a bear
1047.04s: market or something so i do my best not
1049.28s: to get caught at the top
1051.36s: rolling sometimes
1053.12s: just doesn't work and you might run out
1055.12s: of capital to add to the trade you might
1057.04s: run out of reasonable roles and you
1059.28s: might just take assignment at that point
1060.72s: i've done that plenty of times but my
1062.24s: typical preference is to roll
1064.24s: now your best time to roll is when the
1067.76s: stock equals your strike price not
1070.24s: saying that's when you should roll it's
1071.92s: just when you're going to have the most
1073.52s: opportunities and what i mean by that is
1076.40s: when your stock equals strike if you
1078.80s: want to roll you'll almost assuredly be
1081.60s: able to go out a couple weeks and move
1083.12s: your strike out of the money or further
1085.20s: away from the money more often than not
1088.32s: the issue is once you end up further and
1090.88s: further in the money
1092.56s: you have less and less extrinsic value
1094.64s: that means that going further out in
1096.40s: time by two three weeks
1098.40s: isn't going to help you that much to get
1099.92s: a credit or to more importantly
1102.00s: aggressively adjust your strike so i use
1106.08s: stock equal strikes as the first time
1108.24s: for me to look for a roll
1109.92s: typically i will wait and typically
1112.16s: it'll go further in the money and i will
1114.80s: use risk as a way to manage those trades
1118.64s: so once we start deciding okay
1121.68s: i'm in iwm i had twenty thousand dollars
1124.88s: initial outlay i wanna add an additional
1128.08s: eight to ten percent of my allocation
1131.44s: um or i'm sorry at each ten
1134.88s: eight to ten percent drop
1137.52s: in iwm i want to add more of my risk the
1141.36s: amount of that risk will definitely
1143.04s: depend on the rest your portfolio plan
1144.88s: your outlook the underlying things like
1146.96s: that but typically for me i like to
1150.08s: maybe add
1152.24s: 10
1153.36s: something like that so
1155.52s: what i'll do is say okay we move down
1158.00s: another 10 i want to add another 10
1161.12s: of my capital to the trade that allows
1164.72s: me to do exactly what we were talking
1166.24s: about before which is slowly scale into
1168.96s: the trade now when we are in the money
1171.68s: it is important to monitor how much how
1174.00s: much extrinsic value is left in those
1175.92s: options for early assignment if you see
1179.04s: less than a dime and extrinsic value in
1181.04s: the options you're definitely at risk of
1182.80s: early assignment make sure you take a
1184.32s: look it's not a huge deal if you get
1185.84s: assigned early you can always unassign
1187.44s: yourself provided you have the capital
1189.84s: and you know your your broker's not
1191.28s: going to lose their but otherwise
1193.36s: it's really no impact it's just
1195.36s: something to work around
1196.96s: now when we do have the covered call out
1200.56s: i like to have a ratio meaning if i'm
1204.24s: long 500 shares of the underlying i like
1206.88s: to sell two maybe three covered calls
1209.76s: against it and the reason for that is so
1212.00s: that i allow unlimited upside potential
1214.72s: i like that scenario the other thing
1216.88s: like i mentioned before do your best to
1219.36s: allow for capital gains meaning don't
1222.16s: sell your short call like right at the
1224.56s: same price as your long call or as your
1227.68s: long stock sorry i think that's a bad
1229.76s: idea and you really need cap a lot of
1232.88s: the potential return of the strategy
1234.64s: especially there's an opportunity cost
1237.04s: to hold so if you sell a short call
1240.08s: against your long stock you collect that
1241.68s: premium whatever that is that's it
1243.76s: that's all you got on that side of the
1245.20s: trade there's an opportunity cost that
1246.88s: you just gave up there
1248.72s: we talked about gamma risk we talked
1250.72s: about not chasing premiums and
1252.80s: essentially getting into bad products
1254.48s: that you don't really like the last one
1256.96s: is make sure you check your liquid
1259.12s: weekly liquidity i mentioned that but
1262.00s: liquidity is going to be king especially
1263.92s: because when we're rolling
1265.52s: i prefer not to roll out super far out
1267.68s: in time i like to roll out as little in
1269.60s: time as possible while collecting a
1271.60s: credit while ideally being able to
1273.76s: adjust my strike at the same time all
1276.16s: right that is the coverage strangle
1278.08s: speed round i literally doubled the time
1280.40s: that i thought i was going to try to hit
1282.48s: but i didn't want to skimp on the
1283.92s: information so i'm okay with it as
1286.40s: always if there's any questions or
1287.52s: anything let me know like i said i do
1289.20s: have the more in-depth videos that you
1290.80s: could check out there's a bit of a
1292.00s: series there but until next time i'll
1294.32s: catch y'all later
