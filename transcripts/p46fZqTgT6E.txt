0.00s: 13 options trading lies that you've been told now that's a little inflammatory not all of these are directly what I would call lies
8.04s: But there are a lot of
11.04s: Misrepresented data points that are super misleading to people so the goal of this video is to walk through 13 of them
16.08s: What they are and then to give you the reality around some of them hopefully so that you can make better trading decisions
23.56s: Let's get straight into it. So this is actually a post that I recently did on
28.92s: Reddit not too long ago and it serves as a great spot for us to start the conversation and
34.52s: I'll be able to add way more color around these obviously because we are on a video
39.40s: So the first one you see here is 90% of options
44.28s: expire worthless and the reality this is not true the
48.44s: Overwhelming majority of options are closed before
52.96s: Expiration 55 to 60% of the total option contracts that are opened about 30 to 35% of those expire worthless
62.32s: So the reason why this matters is because sometimes when people will say like oh
68.88s: I like to sell options because most of them expire worthless
73.04s: It's not the case and it's important to differentiate that's why I highlight a lot of these
80.08s: It's not just because the fact in and of itself is wrong
83.76s: But it's the implications of what the lie is in this context
90.32s: So you can look at this data on the OIC or Cebo whatever your preference is but the cliff notes version is most options
98.80s: Are actually traded before expiration the next one is the follow on argument of but that means most options that are taking
107.12s: Expiration expire worthless that's correct and it doesn't matter the reason why it doesn't matter is because again
113.04s: The implication of the first one are people typically taking that to think that we're better off selling because of this and
121.04s: It's not the case so that follow on argument point is really just more pedantic than anything again
128.24s: It's not wrong. It's completely fine
129.52s: But what I'm most interested here are
132.88s: Are the rationale and the implications of things which is the next one is selling theta is an edge
139.52s: The answer to this is sometimes it inherently is not an edge theta is
147.36s: Simply the measurement of time. So when we think about an option an option has two
154.72s: Parts of the premium intrinsic and extrinsic value
158.64s: X-trinsic value is broken off it has time
163.36s: Which is we know time time is defined at the onset of the option time decays linearly
169.12s: And then there's volatility the volatility component is where there can be edge in selling theta or selling options for the sake of
177.84s: collecting theta
179.20s: But the time frame that it makes sense is not always and it's actually relative to the relationship between
187.68s: implied and realize volatility
190.00s: So if we take a look at this down here
192.16s: You can see that there are periods where implied volatility exceeds the same time frame for realize volatility
199.60s: And then other times it's the inverse
202.64s: So in this case if you sell theta here
205.36s: You actually can lose money because the realize volatility is more volatile than what's implied
211.36s: Which is what's priced into your options when you choose to sell now a couple cliff notes version
217.84s: For general context here is if you're looking at things like spy well
223.52s: This very often will have risk premiums
227.04s: So if you take a look at this chart this is going back six months
231.28s: Notice that there is this one period this was back that moved during August of this year
235.84s: We're realized really picked up a bit compared to implied
239.36s: But generally speaking the indices are going to have risk premiums
243.04s: So it is absolutely okay and safe to assume in general
248.80s: You can find risk premiums through selling strategies. You can say that the problem is that unless you're delta hedging
256.00s: In purely isolating volatility which most people don't you're not fully exposing yourself
262.16s: To this exact phenomenon and again the implication here is people will automatically default
269.20s: To selling because they think that selling always has an edge and it doesn't
274.64s: In something like smb500 it very often will but it's not always
279.04s: So it can be really misleading the next one
281.84s: This one's really native to the people that trade the wheel
285.44s: Which is when we say things like I'm gonna sell puts to buy stock at a discount and
291.68s: Electup premium sounds great doesn't it sounds really really good. Here's the problem if you sell a put
297.60s: Let's take a look at an example in something like spy and you come in here you go 49 days out
305.04s: And you grab these 30 delta short puts the 592s
309.68s: And you sell them
311.28s: When you sell a put you are taking undefined down to zero risk and you have defined profit
318.48s: What's the payoff for that? Why would somebody take that trade? Well, it's typically because implied volatility is overpriced
324.64s: So you have a little bit of a structural edge when that is the case and the second component is you have a bit of a buffer space to be wrong
332.48s: So spot price right now is like 603 it can move all the way down to here
336.96s: Which 586 and change and you can still hit a profit so you get a bit of a buffer room
342.80s: That's also great the problem people have when they sell puts with that kind of mindset the first thing is
350.56s: Not comparing it to any other strategy, but at the time of
354.88s: expiration if you're assigned a put let's say the stock drops to 570
360.72s: You're buying the stock in this context at 592 when spot price is 570
367.68s: This you're literally buying it at a premium at the time of expiration the reason why that matters is because
375.20s: When people say things like this they're only trying to focus on the elements of the trade that they like that sound good
383.36s: That comfort them and they're not actually thinking about what the reality of the position might look like which sometimes can be kind of ugly
392.24s: So if we take a look at something like Tesla and let's zoom out
396.80s: Let's do like a three-year daily if you sold puts in here and let's say that you're like
403.20s: I would love owning Tesla at 302 back in 2022. We just think that's a bargain
409.28s: What a great spot to be able to get Tesla
411.28s: So I'm gonna sell these puts so that maybe I'll get assigned at a discount
416.00s: But here's the problem when it's at a discount relative to when you sell the puts in time frame
421.76s: There's a reason why it's going down
423.60s: So the original calculus that you had that
426.88s: Decided that it was a discount at the time of selling the puts might not still be a discount
433.12s: In the scenario that you're assigned on the puts because things change that's why the underlying price moves
441.52s: So you might find yourself getting assigned at three and change thinking that you got in at a steal until it drops to
447.92s: 101 and one dollars
450.08s: So the main issue here is not selling puts I sell puts all the time selling puts is fine
455.52s: But it's the way that people do this and the tricks they play because they want to feel comfortable
461.20s: Now if you really want to sell puts to buy a stock at a discount guess what we do
466.56s: Rather than coming in and selling some sort of 30 put why
471.12s: You need the underlying to drop a bunch to get there
474.16s: So maybe we actually sell something that's slightly in the money
477.36s: Maybe we grab the 350s or the 355s that are like a 50 delta
481.52s: You're going to collect a ton of extrinsic value and your probability of being assigned is much higher
486.40s: Which is what we're saying we want
488.32s: So you're actually getting the stock at a little bit of a discount because of the premium received to current spot price
493.52s: And you're collecting way more money to do it
495.28s: But
496.40s: Last most people say that they're really comfortable with assignment until the stock drops 15%
501.44s: And then all of a sudden they don't want that to be the case they don't want to sign in anymore
504.88s: Rightfully so conditions change
507.28s: All right next one to make money on a long option you need the stock to go to be at or above your strike price
514.00s: This is only true at expiration. This is a really common mistake
517.60s: Going back into Tesla
520.24s: Let's say that we think Tesla is going to go up
522.08s: We're going to go out about 90 days is 84 days to expiration and let's say that we go really far out of the money
528.24s: And we grab these
529.76s: 500 calls super far out of the money and we take a look at there's two lines
536.00s: There's a purple line which represents today and then there's a blue line which represents at expiration at
541.36s: expiration you absolutely need to be above your strike plus the premium you paid in order to make any money at
549.28s: expiration notice what this purple line does
552.96s: well before expiration
554.96s: As soon as Tesla starts to go up
558.96s: Isolating delta meaning volatility isn't changing and not focusing on time decay yet
564.88s: This means that the underlying
566.80s: appreciates
568.00s: The options call options will appreciate you will make money
571.44s: So in this case you have the 500 calls even if Tesla goes from
576.00s: Spot price today, which is 345 to 350 you make 70 bucks. That's nowhere near 500
582.88s: It's nowhere near your strike price, but you still make money
585.12s: So the caveat here is you do have to make sure that you're overcoming any changes in volatility and any changes in theta
593.84s: Which is actually why a lot of times I go further out in time like this 84 days to expiration because if you take a look at the theta here
600.64s: It will be much less
601.92s: theta here is 15 cents if we come into this 21 days expiration we go to that same 15 delta you take a look at theta
609.04s: It's 25 cents and you're really double. So that's the trade off there
612.88s: I have a video that goes super far into detail on buying call options smarter to balance all of these things including gamma
620.56s: But for this specific point you just need to know you don't need it to go above your strike price in order to make money
627.36s: You make money quite a bit before that
629.36s: The next one you can't go broke taking profits you absolutely can and this is for a very specific reason
635.76s: That's pretty simple. It has everything to do with expected return sooner or later risk is going to be realized
643.60s: What I mean by that is so we have nine winning trades one losing trade
647.68s: You're making $50 on each of those winning trades. So it's really high win rate 90 percent
653.04s: However on that one loss if you lose four to seventy five dollars your gross overall expected P&L here is negative 25 bucks
661.20s: You lose money
662.64s: So why why is that the case you can't go broke taking profits? Well the problem is sooner or later
669.12s: If you continue to trade you're going to have a loss. So the only scenario where
675.60s: You can't go broke taking profits is if you don't have a losing trade
679.04s: Which you're we're all going to have at some point. So it's a it's a completely
682.88s: Broken saying that forces people into something called the disposition effect which is really well studied
688.72s: And it is where traders have a propensity to take winning trades down too fast and let winning trades run too large
696.24s: And these kinds of sayings feed directly into that the way we need to manage trade is based on expected return
702.40s: It's not about little sayings like you can't go broke taking profit because sooner or later you're going to have losing trade
708.16s: Which can hurt
709.68s: The next one buying is better than selling or selling is better than buying the
713.52s: Punchline here is neither is better. They both have a use case that's really important
718.32s: And if one was structurally better than the other nobody would do the other there's lots of smart people in markets
725.20s: So they have use cases they both have pros and cons
729.36s: It's up to you as a trader to determine what's better for what you're trying to do
733.12s: I both buy and sell it's entirely context dependent
738.08s: The next grouping options are zero sum
742.56s: So in a nutshell, they absolutely are now I want to talk about what this means though
748.96s: Because most people when they say options are zero sum
752.96s: It simply means that in order for one option to make money the other option on the other side is losing money
759.44s: This is looking at the option contracts in a vacuum and again, it's completely correct
764.56s: The problem is the mindset that it infers against the reality
770.40s: The mindset it infers is that because options are zero sum
773.60s: It means that the counter party on the other side of the trade is also probably sophisticated that might know more than you do
779.76s: And there's a reason why they're on the other side of the trade that might be smarter than the reason you're getting into your trade
786.40s: Or something along those lines
788.48s: The problem is
790.00s: Multiple fault the first thing is the counter party to your trade is probably a market maker
795.04s: Which fun fact the market maker doesn't actually care that much about how much they're going to make on the option itself
800.88s: It's a bonus
801.92s: But they make money off of providing liquidity and capturing the bit ask spread
805.92s: So this is where we remove ourselves from the vacuum of just comparing options themselves and what that might infer
814.16s: against the reality of markets
816.80s: which is
818.40s: Typically the counter party to your trade is a market maker who's going to make money by providing liquidity
824.64s: The next important component is that the overall
829.04s: Process that somebody's placing a trade for is different. So for example
835.68s: Let's go back to our example in Tesla and let's say that we have a short haul
842.08s: Well, if somebody sells a call the general inference is oh, they want the stock to go down right options
848.40s: Zero sum
849.44s: So that means if I'm buying a call somebody selling the call and the person selling the call obviously wants this stock to go down
856.00s: Maybe
856.96s: Or maybe they have 200 shares of Tesla as part of that position and they actually wanted to go up
862.64s: They're just collecting some premium against their long shares and they're actually bullish
866.24s: They might actually have the same thesis you do
868.40s: But they're putting a position on that might make sense for the portfolio
871.92s: So the reason why I call this out is because the inferences people make from it that lead them to
877.52s: Incorrect conclusions
879.76s: The reality is markets are very diverse. There's lots of reasons why people are doing things
885.68s: So if you take the inference that there's zero sum to mean that somebody is directly opposing your idea for
892.16s: Potentially better research idea. It's misleading
895.28s: The next one to make money you need to emulate what institutions do
900.16s: This one's pretty simple the fact of the matter is institutions are playing a completely different game than you
904.96s: That's what it comes down to
906.40s: So there are elements that an institution exhibits that are great
910.40s: To model things like having a rigorous process checks and balances
914.56s: Training those kinds of things are great
916.88s: But the function of a market maker is completely different you as a retail trader or making money off of speculating
924.08s: A market maker makes money off of providing liquidity and managing risk literally completely different game
930.80s: So when people come out and say oh my friend is a hedge fund manager or my buddy does this or I was a former whatever
939.76s: It's cool to have that experience
941.44s: But there's a reason why a lot of people that move from professional trading into retail trading don't do as well
947.60s: And it's because they're just different. It's different games
951.52s: So I would think really carefully about what elements of institutional professional trading
957.28s: You try to pick up as a retail trader because they're doing things differently
961.12s: And I actually use a very specific example here at the end of the post it says
967.28s: Taking the applicable elements is great obviously of institutional trading that makes sense
972.08s: But trying to emulate what they do is akin to emulating playing basketball like shack even though you're five six
979.76s: Right, that's a it's an inherent attribute that you don't have
983.20s: Things that market makers have access to or high-frequency traders or hedge funds
987.44s: There are access features that you don't have you won't have as a retail trader
991.60s: So you have to play the game the best you can within your space
995.92s: You absolutely should understand how these entities work what they care about how they behave
1000.72s: But if you try to do what they do you're going to fail because they're different
1005.44s: So you have to play the game your way
1008.00s: institutions are out to get to retail
1010.72s: Sometimes and it's kind of tricky because
1014.16s: People that the inference from this is that you're playing a stacked game that is only out to hurt you
1021.28s: And it's really not so much the case there are absolutely instances where a market maker
1027.20s: Might try to pursue Max Payne if we're within a couple pennies because why not it doesn't hurt them
1032.24s: The problem is
1034.24s: In general
1035.68s: Institutions are busy competing with each other on the retail side you're kind of just
1041.28s: Round them in the same space, but again, you're doing different things
1046.08s: So if you apply a victim mindset as you're moving through markets, which is the bigger inference here
1051.92s: It's just going to be a complete hindrance
1054.32s: The next one one of my favorites actually one of the reasons why I started YouTube channels to counteract these kinds of people
1060.00s: Make xx per day per week per whatever time frame easy
1065.76s: With no time or effort and in a incognito window on YouTube
1071.28s: I just throw an options trading and this looks like a good video the first one
1076.24s: It looks like they're providing just general information then the second video take a look
1080.64s: Obstrastrating in 10 minutes how to make a thousand dollars a day
1086.24s: This is a quintessential clickbait video. I don't know anything about him
1090.64s: He might be great and he might just be playing the YouTube game not talking crap about Chris
1094.64s: He's probably fine
1095.76s: But this objectively is terrible clickbait
1098.80s: Designed to trick people into thinking that this is a reality and it is not think of it this way
1105.36s: If you could make a thousand dollars a day
1108.08s: Obstrastrating in 10 minutes as a beginner only who wouldn't do that
1113.76s: Everybody would there's a reason why trading has such a high failure rate
1117.52s: So don't fall for this kind of stuff as you scroll through some more you can see some basic content
1122.80s: This is all good teaching people how to do stuff. This is Benjamin's channel. He's a homie
1127.44s: So you should definitely check out his stuff
1130.24s: This is also Chris another good dude, and then you get down a little bit further and then we have this
1135.92s: 4,600 in a million dollars and 13 minutes again that can completely happen
1140.24s: There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself
1142.96s: The problem with this is that it's designed to set up terrible expectations for you the beginner
1149.68s: And make you believe that this is normal. This is common. This will happen all the time
1153.68s: And again, it's just clickbaits designed to get you to click through the video again
1156.72s: I'm not saying there's anything wrong or that that didn't happen
1159.84s: I don't know
1160.80s: But what I'm telling you is that the inference from stuff like this is to make you think that it's common repeatable easy
1167.20s: And it simply isn't
1169.44s: The next one this one's super simple, but everybody messes this up
1173.20s: You'll see things like rolling avoids losses
1177.60s: And again, I go into an incognito window
1179.92s: So it's not skewed by anything that I look at and the first non-sponsored post is by this guy
1185.92s: And it says avoid losses by rolling options, which is
1190.56s: utter bullshit. It's not what it is at all
1193.20s: I actually would recommend checking out this video that talks about the reality and how it actually works
1198.72s: This isn't just to promote my own stuff
1200.72s: But it's because there are a lot of misconceptions about rolling options like this one here
1206.16s: I can tell you what rolling isn't
1209.44s: It's not free money. It objectively is not free money
1214.48s: So
1215.68s: Rolling options and a link to that video so you could check it out
1218.88s: But in a nutshell, it's closing a trade and opening a new trade and tying the accounting together
1224.16s: Whatever the realized P&L of the prior trade was that's whatever the P&L is
1228.80s: That's what's realized
1230.56s: So rolling trades is literally booking a profit or a loss whatever it was in opening a new trade that may
1238.80s: Overwhelmed the prior loss, but it doesn't produce free money. Not how it works
1245.44s: The last thing trading is hard. This is completely
1249.20s: Completely accurate, but inaccurate at the same time. It's kind of a fun topic actually
1254.48s: The reason why I say that is trading the actual process of trading is supremely easy
1260.16s: All of the work all of the difficulty is done long before you click the button
1267.36s: When you're actually executing a strategy and physically trading that's the easy part
1272.08s: It's as easy as it gets. It's just execution
1275.20s: All of the hard work is done before this is like people who practice really really hard Kobe Bryant's a great example
1281.44s: And when he was playing games he would literally talk about how game was like a release
1287.12s: Because he put himself through hell in training and in practice
1291.36s: So that games essentially become easy by comparison
1295.44s: So trading itself overall is very difficult the vast majority of people will fail
1301.84s: But if you define a process you go through the effort of building strategies
1306.48s: Building a plan that you can execute that you trust
1310.00s: Trading in and of itself the button clicking component of it is super super easy
1315.20s: So what are some other options trading myths or lies you've heard?
1319.76s: I'd love to hear them in the comments be an outlier. I will see you all later
