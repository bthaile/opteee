0.80s: what's up outliers got three things for
3.20s: the market update today first we're
5.28s: going to talk about Dollar General then
6.72s: we're going to talk about the tech
7.72s: sector then we're going to talk about
9.16s: GameStop let's get right to it so the
11.16s: first thing is Dollar General had a hell
14.64s: of a day today and as you can tell it
17.48s: closed at the bottom of this candle it
20.08s: just got shoved down all day it tried to
23.72s: Rally a little bit post earnings and its
26.24s: earnings wasn't abysmal but it
29.24s: definitely was wasn't good so we can
32.00s: take a look through what happened this
33.48s: was before the market opened and it
36.28s: dropped over
38.08s: 25% and we can see that it came in at
40.76s: 170 per share which is down from 213
44.40s: year-over-year and it was expected at
47.20s: 179 net sales came in 1021 10.21 billion
53.44s: which actually expanded that doesn't
55.52s: seem you know too bad to me but this is
59.12s: the big problem
60.48s: so it expects fiscal 2024 EPS of 550 to
64.76s: 620 and sales growth 4.7 to 5.3% which
69.04s: is down so yeah this is one of the
72.60s: things that you'll find with forward
74.32s: guidance is this exact kind of scenario
77.36s: the market was originally expecting it
79.00s: at 712 this obviously is really missing
82.72s: that to the downside unfortunately for
84.80s: them so they are behind the curve here
88.12s: now the other thing I want to take a
89.52s: look at with you is just the indices but
92.48s: specifically Tech because Tech really
95.48s: had a a pretty big problem out here so
98.20s: if we take a look at first the
101.96s: sectors and we can see what's going on
104.40s: here Tech is still this is now in a
107.08s: negative sloping Channel like this is
109.08s: very clearly trending down and we're
112.48s: still seeing relative weakness across
114.76s: quite a few of the sectors but it
117.32s: definitely looks like to me Tech is lead
119.88s: leading us to the downside the S&P 500
121.88s: is staying a little more resilient
123.24s: trending sideways here but Tech is in
126.52s: the picture that's one of the the
127.92s: biggest things that I see here and if we
130.36s: take a look across the
132.84s: indices we can see that again Q's which
135.88s: is a little more Tech heavy than the
137.12s: others is already moving down towards
139.56s: these moving averages the S&P 500 still
141.92s: has a little bit of room here before it
143.28s: starts rotating over but then we're
144.76s: seeing the Russell actually bucking the
147.64s: trend vix is down
151.20s: curious huh so vix is down Market is
154.24s: down that happens sometimes it's not
155.92s: quite as infrequent as people might
157.68s: think but still interesting to see this
161.12s: slowing amidst the rest of this seeming
164.80s: potential selloff accelerating it's a
167.16s: little too early to tell now quick recap
169.48s: on Nvidia I was curious how it was going
171.40s: to Faire today and it actually fell a
174.00s: little more than I expected earlier in
176.00s: the day was hovering right around 120s
178.00s: that seemed about where it was going to
179.40s: be and then it looked like it was being
181.56s: held up propped up pretty strong
183.68s: actually by people interested in it but
186.12s: they just couldn't hold on and there's a
188.48s: massive sale candle today with over 89%
192.12s: sale volume so people were just
193.40s: unwinding here and I get it it this was
196.24s: a a pretty interesting earnings release
198.12s: because it was so so focused on Nvidia
201.36s: and the impact of the broader market and
203.00s: then the tone for AI all these kinds of
205.44s: things are so topical right now so I
208.36s: totally get it but it's just a little
210.36s: more emotional than I was expecting it
212.48s: seemed like it was hanging in there and
213.88s: then it just kind of broke down the rest
215.44s: of the day so yeah this is interesting
218.52s: to me but something that I think is not
221.68s: unexpected after its earnings because
223.32s: again I was talking about this before
225.08s: the earnings in here needed to be
227.16s: perfect in order for it to continue this
229.36s: kind of parabolic ascent so it doesn't
232.12s: surprise me that we find ourselves in
235.08s: this scenario with Nvidia the way I'm
237.20s: looking at Tech right now is it still to
240.44s: me is very promising long-term but
242.84s: shortterm it looks a little weaker and
245.88s: something that I'm definitely going to
247.40s: be minding my exposure in so now we need
250.88s: to take a look at GameStop because
253.48s: GameStop had a great day today and again
257.08s: it's not like a a huge day but I am so
260.56s: stoked that it started coming into this
263.48s: value area and immediately started
266.92s: rejecting right back out like that was
268.92s: great for me to see I was very very
270.96s: happy with that I still see RSI both raw
274.92s: RSI and the EMA below the 50 handle so I
277.76s: don't love that from just a general
280.92s: strength picture but this was a good day
282.96s: in here and the other thing is we can
284.80s: see the volume really stepped up big
287.80s: time again it's really hard to see
289.92s: because the volume is so skewed by all
291.84s: this noise back here but if you take a
294.00s: look at the volume today was 10.3
297.32s: million shares with 53% % buy volume and
302.08s: the 20-day average volume is only five
304.72s: and the 5-day average volume is 5.7 so
308.12s: this is two times the average midterm
311.00s: 20-day and short-term volume so there
313.28s: are a lot of people stepping out here
314.84s: that really liked it at this point so
316.64s: that that was sick I was really really
318.28s: happy with that and again we do have
320.88s: earnings coming up in here come the 10th
325.04s: after the market closes so now the other
328.68s: thing is I took a look through just the
332.36s: options flow for both GameStop and chewy
334.76s: to see if anything stuck out to me not a
336.72s: lot if I'm being completely honest with
338.68s: you but there were a few more
340.32s: transactions that came in above $100,000
342.92s: but it's still just five so there's not
345.48s: uh tremendous amount of activity and a
347.44s: lot of it is further out in time right
348.96s: so we see these 26 expirations then we
351.60s: see this 25 expirations so a lot of it
354.36s: is generally longer term in uh nature so
358.20s: yeah just not quite as much going going
359.80s: on there which is okay it's still
362.36s: relatively quiet in here so if we take a
365.32s: look at the options let's take a look at
367.40s: the volume today we had
369.64s: 211,000 calls trade against 47,000 puts
372.72s: which this is actually quite a lot and
375.24s: 30 a was super active and we can see the
377.76s: six was also fairly active my
380.56s: expectation here is that we'll continue
383.00s: to see both of these vs rise as they are
386.20s: and I think that we start building out
388.60s: this 133 step sooner rather than later
391.24s: that's my guess so if we take a look at
393.60s: the open interest 576,000 calls against
396.40s: 288,000 puts uh General call skew in
401.48s: here not super heavy but it's still
403.64s: there which is good to see and we can
406.40s: see though that a lot of these calls are
407.92s: actually further out in time which is
410.04s: generally anomalous so the 17 Jan 25s
413.32s: that's where a lot of the the largest
415.12s: positions are which again previously we
417.24s: would' see much more of that in the
418.76s: near-term expiration
420.80s: the 30 hugs have 110 against 29k on the
425.20s: put side so strong call skue here but
428.56s: we'll take a look at how many of those
429.72s: are out of the money I would imagine the
431.40s: majority and the 13-step expiration is
433.84s: still real quiet 25k calls against
436.40s: 10,000 puts so we'll see if we start
439.04s: getting that build out in the earnings
440.96s: expiration cycle it's not quite there
443.04s: yet but it's getting there now the last
445.84s: thing I want to talk about with respect
447.96s: to GameStop is as is I look through the
450.24s: order flow here I see a really healthy
454.28s: mix across expirations which again this
457.48s: is not so much the case that I've
459.00s: typically seen in the product I
460.44s: generally see this specific ticker look
463.72s: like the majority of volume tends to be
466.28s: centralized in the front expirations and
468.24s: we can still see some elements of that
469.80s: right like all these 30 augs it's still
472.52s: happening to a degree but I am seeing
475.36s: way more other expirations pop up on
477.96s: this list doesn't really mean a whole
479.96s: lot it just means that we're not hyper
481.60s: concentrated in the front exploration
483.60s: like we have been previously and I draw
486.04s: your attention to it simply because it
487.92s: is an observation that I have there's
489.48s: not a lot to take away from it as of now
492.04s: it's something that we track the changes
493.84s: that's how a lot of this stuff works
495.24s: there's not always a takeaway directly
498.08s: from um the individual observation but
500.80s: the trend of an observation so that's
503.68s: just something generally new to add into
505.92s: the mix all right gang that wraps me up
509.08s: for today as always let me know if
510.44s: there's anything you want me to take a
511.48s: look at be an outlier and I'll see you
513.40s: guys on the live session tomorrow catch
515.64s: you guys later
