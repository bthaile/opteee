0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update. I got three things on the agenda. The first one
4.68s: is what you see on the screen. We're going to talk a little bit about September 11th,
7.76s: because your boys are patriot and it's important to continue that message. The second thing
12.16s: I want to talk about quickly is actually looking at the broad market and specifically tech
17.16s: slash Nvidia. There's some interesting activity going on there. And then the third thing
21.36s: for today is actually going to be chewy. And I want to discuss a few things I'm seeing
26.88s: in there specifically. So kind of a broad market update today with a few bubble points.
32.76s: Let's dive right in. So for those that don't know today's September 11th, and I think
36.60s: it's important to at least talk about it very quickly. You can check out this really,
40.72s: really, really good video from National Geographic. This is kind of just about the attacks from
47.12s: the American perspective. So there's not a lot about war fighting and stuff in here,
51.56s: which honestly is what I'm more interested in. There's a couple other documentaries.
54.76s: I think are better for that. But the thing that I think is important to highlight about
60.40s: this is I feel like most of us in this Western world consider us civilized and, you know,
65.48s: we're really, really comfortable here comparatively. I know for Americans that haven't traveled
69.84s: a lot that's kind of hard to see. We can always find things to bitch and complain about.
74.88s: But if you look across a lot of the world, it's very little compared to most other places.
79.92s: So we live in a pretty cool spot. And I think this is an important reminder that even though
84.56s: we live in a cool spot, it can be disrupted. And this is a reminder of how cool of a spot
89.08s: it is that something like this is still so prolific and it's something that's happened
93.68s: over almost a decade and a half ago, right? We don't get that much heat here. And it's very
99.92s: fortunate because of our geographical location, our neighbors, all that kind of stuff. So
103.92s: it's not getting into politics, anything like that. Couldn't care less. The main thing is just
107.68s: to be thankful for where we are to be reminded that a lot of the world is not quite as fortunate.
113.92s: And as I try to remind people is that although we play the game civilized, we are all quite
119.20s: literally still animals. Violence is a part of human nature. It's not changed since our
124.56s: existence. I don't see it changing anytime soon. So this is exactly why we say things like be hard
129.92s: to kill. Just remember, people can suck as much as we have these ideals about how good we want
135.68s: things to be, how we would love there to be flowers and butterflies everywhere and everybody to
140.24s: love one another. It's just unrealistic. There's going to be different people that believe different
144.40s: things. So you can like flowers and butterflies. I think they're sick too. But I also think it's
150.24s: important for people to remember the overall scope of the world. So big day, this is a
155.76s: transformative day for me. I remember it literally crystal clear. I was still a kid at this time.
160.24s: I was in elementary school. And this is one of the reasons why my brother joined the Marine Corps.
164.56s: Why I joined the Marine Corps? We saw this happen and we're like, we're going to war. Let's
168.48s: do what's got to get done. So that's that. Let's get on to the markets. So DJT funny enough. I
175.12s: wasn't going to talk about it, but fell off a cliff. So this was interesting to see. This has just
179.44s: been a vicious, vicious downtrend. This isn't anything that I trade as you could tell. I think it's
184.96s: a great trade to the downside. Although the downside is starting to look a little bit exhausted here
189.76s: because it's kind of like how far down can it go? And it looks like it's almost at IPO levels.
195.68s: Yeah, it's essentially all the way down near all time lows. So you might get another couple bucks
199.76s: down like the 14 handle, but not what I wanted to talk about. Let's dive in here. This. This is
208.80s: what I want to highlight. Take a look at this candle in queues. Queues right now is essentially what
216.32s: led to this massive rally in the S&P 500. And as per usual, it comes down to a handful of names.
222.24s: We saw volatility contract down now, even below 18. It's in the mid 17 handle.
229.84s: And the market is starting to catch a bite here. But again, I still view this as tenuous. Now I
237.12s: did add a queues position today. I have NASDAQ futures to complement my S&P futures, but it's
244.72s: very, very tenuous. I do not have a position still in IWM, although as you all probably know,
250.24s: I typically prefer to just don't see it right now. And it's because even though this does start
255.68s: look like it might be rallying, it's just way too early. And there's no, there's no heroes in the
261.04s: market. I have found that the game of trying to top tick or bottom tick or perfectly time
267.12s: reversals as a really difficult game. I don't want to call it a fool's errand because
272.96s: some people can do it really well. I just find it to be an absolute minority of people that can,
278.88s: and it's not me. I'll tell you that. I miss time it all the time. And that's just how this game
284.08s: goes for me. I have to adopt a different strategy to deal with my litany of issues that being one of
289.92s: them. So that part aside, I do think when I look at queues that this starts to get interesting. So
297.92s: let's take a closer look at QQQ. And let's see how it's performing. I want to come into a six
304.56s: month because here's what I've highlighted before. This is a really important level in my opinion.
312.40s: And the reason why this level is very important to me is because once we start dropping below this
318.96s: handle, we really collapse this higher low thesis. Again, lower low, higher low, higher low.
329.04s: But there's a couple issues I see with this move. The first one is look at the compression. So if
334.16s: you look at the distance between this lower low and then this higher low, that's a fair period of time.
340.72s: It's like four months almost. So that move compared to what we're seeing now from here to here is
347.36s: about a month. So this is more reminiscent of this move. And that doesn't mean that it can't,
353.60s: bounce around here for a little bit, shoot up, then come back down. Who knows where it goes?
356.64s: It goes circles. But what I'm really trying to highlight here is although I like the movement that
362.00s: I'm seeing in tech right now, I also understand that it still seems fairly tentatively moving in my
368.56s: opinion. The moving averages are an absolute mess. It's starting to look healthy. Again, that's
373.92s: why I built a position today. But it's something that I'm watching very carefully. And the way that I
379.12s: play those kinds of positions is to be really aggressive because I'm not trying to bottom ticket,
384.40s: right? Like I waited till today to start getting in. But I also don't want this to roll right back
392.16s: over as it starts coming up into this handle, which is really where near term resistance is going
396.88s: to be kind of like first stop will be there ish. And if it gets up there and gets stuck up and
402.32s: starts shooting back down, that's exit for me right away. And then I would wait until some sort of
408.00s: ability to break above this. If it hits it consolidates and then starts moving up, great.
412.72s: But I'm really sensitive to a down move off of that at this point because again, you can see
417.44s: that this has happened. This happens with stocks all the time when they have these failed breakouts
421.92s: on consolidation that weekends. This all goes back to the broader thesis. The market right now is
426.88s: so freaking emotional. And if you need proof of that, look at Nvidia. Nvidia got trounced, got murdered
436.64s: here in the beginning of August, then after earnings, which were really good earnings, it went from
443.76s: one 28 down to 101, almost a low of 100, I think actually, yeah, a low of 195, a massive down move.
453.60s: And now it's starting to rally back out. So to see these kind of movements based on solid earnings,
460.16s: most of this is from a broader economic sense. Again, in my opinion, there's a lot of broad
464.80s: economic factors, which we'll go into later during the YouTube live stream a little bit later today.
470.80s: But that's what I see going on with Nvidia. I mean, it had a crack day. It was up what, eight points.
478.32s: So I mean, a massive massive rally. And the interesting thing I find about Nvidia here is that it
485.52s: is still consolidating well. So what that means is I'm setting new alerts to kind of follow this move
491.68s: up and see how it performs. But again, low, higher low, higher low. So even though it's having
498.72s: these really nasty selloffs, which I don't love from a volatility perspective, it's rallying out
504.32s: and it's not falling too deep. So tech is still alive here. It just looks like it's really,
513.84s: really dependent on external factors at this point. Energy getting killed. So I still have my
519.60s: fades in energy. I'm pleading individual stocks, not XLE writ large, but that's playing out really,
525.20s: really well. And we can also see a couple interesting behaviors. XLF caught a bite today.
531.44s: That started selling off pretty hard. And we're starting to see again rotation among the sectors.
537.60s: So XLU still strong performing, XLR is still strong performing. XLP stay still hanging in there.
544.00s: And XLK obviously technology is really starting to rally up out of here, but this is not out of the
549.44s: woods in my opinion. This is not whole port tech. All right. So the last thing I want to take a look
554.80s: at with you quickly is Chewie. And it's because people are obviously really excited and the timing for
561.44s: roaring kiddie's post about Chewie and dropping the toys is really funny. And a lot of people are
569.04s: going back and forth as to whether he caught this move or not or whether he's already out based on
574.24s: that post. We still haven't seen a refiled 13G, which he would owe within 10 days of when he made
583.76s: the transaction that would cause him to fall below 5%. So let's say, for example, because after I
588.88s: think his percentage would have increased pretty meaningfully because of the corporate actions from
594.96s: Chewie. So that could put him at a higher percentage. He could have sold some of it, not hit the
599.12s: 5% threshold, waited a little bit. And who knows, maybe you caught a little bit of the move today.
603.68s: But based on our best guess is the date that he got into at least cross the 5% threshold was back
608.56s: here. So again, this is still not big bucks for him. Even if he top tick tick going from 26 to 30,
614.64s: it's a lot of money. It's a ton of money. But again, like we've seen this dude go through a quarter
620.16s: billion dollar rally and just hold it. So my guess is he's not trying to play this move as anything
626.56s: significant. He is a time traveler that's doing something else. But I do think it's interesting
633.60s: because it's important to highlight the move that happened today. So if you'll notice,
640.00s: we saw that pet co-wolf, it had really good second quarter results. So you can see that it missed
649.44s: its earnings target, expected what, two cents. But overall, we saw growth within wolf.
660.16s: And you can tell that the market really, really, really liked the report. So this is again,
666.24s: a really important comparison. When we're looking at the performance of products and earnings releases.
672.40s: Sometimes we get too wrapped up in the idea of, oh, if it's a earnings miss, the market's going to
678.32s: hate it. And it's going to collapse not necessarily. It all depends on the context. So in this case,
682.88s: again, you can see that let's grab wolf really fast. And you'll see it came in at negative two
691.76s: cents. It was expected at negative eight cents. So really, really big beat in terms of EPS. It fell
700.16s: a little bit short on some of its metrics. But that earnings beat absolutely through pet co-through
705.68s: the roof on today. I mean, it's a 32.9% move. So Chewie moved some of that in sympathy. And again,
713.12s: this is very common for stocks that share similar industries around earnings. Because if you see
718.00s: collective strength, then it typically means some of that strength will pass between other companies
723.04s: in the same industry. So this is a really interesting movement today. And I didn't go through all
729.12s: of the earnings yet. I did see that there were some elements that were a little bit soft
735.44s: from the earnings. But overall, it looked like it did. It did really, really well. You can see
741.12s: capital expenditures, 140 million. So they're investing adjusted EPS came in three four cents for,
749.44s: this is looking for Q three. So this is forward-looking guidance. So yeah, I mean, overall,
755.92s: it looks like the company is, I mean, this isn't something that I love. This isn't something
760.96s: I typically would trade its way too cheap of a stock. But it looks like overall, we can see
766.32s: that like, for example, net revenue came down half a percent year over year. I know that that's
771.12s: we, we normally really don't like that. But there was enough other components that
776.80s: counteracted that and led to the market really liking the move. And then the forward guidance. So
782.40s: really, really massive move in pet co. So there apps me up. I'll see you on the live session
788.72s: later today. 5 p.m. Pacific time being out there. See you guys later.
