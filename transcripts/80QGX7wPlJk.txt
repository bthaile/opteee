0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have saws and off ready to
6.86s: wrap up 2024 stellar year. Super fun time. How'd you fair out there?
13.30s: How did I fair? I think it was an average, you know, I'm a contrarian. So it's a little
22.44s: bit of a, you know, when you have a straight one, one dimensional, one directional market,
29.48s: sometimes that gets a little tough for me. I had probably only really one horrible trade
36.46s: all year and the rest I think was like a, you know, was a pretty average year for me.
43.40s: I did not knock the ball out of the park this year and I didn't get hurt either. It was just
48.84s: it was about an average year. I should have done better, but I was, I sold out some,
57.24s: passive longs a little too early. I guess.
60.20s: Yeah. And you actually preamble into the next question, two questions I had for you. Is
66.68s: I always think it's a weird question to ask, but I'm always curious to the response like
71.40s: of a trade that was memorable for a good reason and bad reason, not necessarily best trade
76.76s: worst trade, but memorable trades. And again, positive memory and then negative memory.
83.08s: What takes you to a dark place? It sounds like you had a bad trade. I'd love to hear about
86.52s: that one. Was it in video? Yeah. My worst trade of the year was in video. But it was in video
94.20s: because I was, I got stupid. That's all. It wasn't in video because, you know, I am a person
101.40s: that completely accepts the fact that sometimes the stock wins. You know, I mean, I've had,
109.32s: I'm going to assume I've had hundreds of thousands, if not millions of losing trades in my career.
114.04s: You know, so, so I would think that I'm very comfortable, you know, not being right.
120.28s: I think that's, no, I can't be millions. So hundreds of thousands, let's say. And
129.16s: so I'm okay, you know, losing to a good competitor, you know, like a worthy opponent.
135.96s: But in the case of Nvidia, I got a little pig headed towards the end of that move and just did
141.40s: some stupid things. So yeah, that was my worst trade of the year, you know, walk, walk me through
146.36s: the stupid things size. And was it was it initial size or was it still it size? It was, it was,
155.40s: it was what I call angry size. Love that. That's good. A little bit of revenge trade. We all need
159.96s: that in our lives. Yeah. Yeah. It was a little bit. Well, it wasn't, yeah, I never got to the point
163.96s: where I even deserved revenge. I was it, you know, it was, it was just an angry, you know,
169.48s: ego-tistical, you know, like you can't hurt me, you know, like you can't hurt me. So I'm going to go
175.80s: and, you know, I knew I couldn't move the markets. So I just thought, you know, I was getting
181.32s: at the right price. And I was about three or four months early. Got it. And what was the scaling
190.20s: and protocol that you did? Was it anything specific or was it based on feel like as you saw it do
195.32s: something? It was based on ego. It was, it's the worst kind of scale. It's the ego scale. I'm not a,
201.24s: I'm not a, a, a scalar type trader. I'm a, I'm a lump summer. That's what I call it. Yeah. I'm
210.60s: purely a lump summer. So I'm not, I'm not somebody that dollar costs average. I don't roll in over time.
218.20s: You know, I don't allocate it in over time. I'm usually one of the reasons that I've been able
223.64s: to hang around this business for so long and not really ever get hurt is because I don't add to
229.32s: losing trades very often at all. For me, to make you mad at trade. Yeah. Yeah. For me to add to
234.92s: losing trade is incredibly rare. Like I can accept losing, but I won't take myself down by adding to
241.24s: his job. I'm not big head about it. I don't fall in love with my freaking trades. But, um, every
246.52s: once in a while, I do something pretty fucking stupid. And that would be, you know, like I'll just let
252.04s: my ego go in the way. And I just did it yesterday in Tesla. And I'm like six months ago in, uh, in
258.76s: video. But the rest of the time, I'm pretty good. It's so funny. I was literally just going to ask
263.16s: you about this move in Tesla. So beautiful. What do you think of it? The move in Tesla is ridiculous.
269.24s: I mean, it's ridiculous. I made, I made about it not because of not even because of the move in
276.84s: Tesla. But because of what I feel like is, is a, um, it's just something that, um, you look at
285.80s: that. I feel like, I feel like this whole Tesla thing is such a bad indictment of what's going
295.24s: on in America right now. And what's going on in politics all over. Like it kind of makes me sick.
302.04s: And so, um, you know, I don't like the fact that, that, uh, all of a sudden the presidency is for
309.40s: sale. I don't like that at all. I don't like the fact that the idea of a cleaning of, of, of
315.88s: cleaning out the swamp is really making the swamp that much worse. Um, I just feel like it's a
321.96s: very dangerous precedent to set. Incredibly dangerous. So when you see stocks like this gap up
329.64s: after the election is known, is that the, the way that you're thinking is that this is, do you
334.52s: think that this is like forecasting future policy decisions and that's being priced in? Or do you
339.56s: think this is? Yeah, I don't think it's forecasting future policy decisions. I think it's forecasting.
345.64s: I don't think it's forecasting anything. When I think it is, it's making a statement that, hey,
350.36s: you know what, if you're willing to, um, if you're willing to commit a certain amount of
356.04s: loyalty, which could be measured in hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, we're willing to
360.76s: give you whatever you want. Even though this is a democracy, it doesn't matter. Um, you know,
366.44s: it's kind of that, that's what it means. And what do you think of that in context again? It's like
371.96s: if we look within the energy sector, we know that there's a bunch of stuff in there
378.84s: that is doing well, but then there's also buckets that's that are doing poorly.
383.32s: And to me, that would indicate that it's starting to think about in forecast policy expectations.
391.80s: So if we think that we're going to drill more things that drill will probably be doing well.
395.24s: If we think that we're going to roll back green energy, green energy companies are probably
399.56s: not going to do as well. Do you think that's part of this or no? If it's, if it's part of a platform,
405.56s: I am, it doesn't bother me at all because that's already priced into the market. So if you're
410.84s: talking about, you know, a political party platform, then I'm fine with that because that's,
418.12s: that's what, you know, that's what people voted for. And, um, and that was known all long.
424.12s: So efficient market theory says that that's already priced into the market. I have no issue
428.52s: with that. I don't think there's been a change in policy. So I think that's already priced in.
433.88s: I'm talking about something different. Yeah, I see. Yeah. And I can pick up that new one.
438.92s: That's why I use this example to understand the new ones, which makes sense. Yeah, I don't
442.12s: care about things that are, you know, like, if you, if you campaign that, hey, you know, I'm,
447.40s: this is, this is who I am. This is our party platform. Then that's fine. No problem.
452.92s: I see. Yeah. And then did you see there's a ETF? It's called DXYZ. It's like the Destiny 100.
459.64s: It's kind of like a smaller, a smaller fund that invests in different kind of non-public companies,
466.20s: SpaceX being one of them. And that also flew off the handle. I don't know if that's something that
471.72s: you picked up on your radar or not. I don't trade that. It makes me a little nervous when they say
477.88s: that ETFs are investing in non-public companies. I don't know exactly what that means and what
484.92s: valuation. There are some insane valuations. And I think you got to be really careful about,
490.60s: you know, I don't think there's a bigger, I would almost say right now in the listed markets
498.60s: that Elon Musk might be a bigger single point of failure risk than Trump even. So I,
506.84s: it makes me very nervous to have any investments. And I was shown the SpaceX deal like three times
512.52s: already. Different, you know, chances to get into SpaceX and I had zero interest. Really? Yeah, zero.
520.92s: Just because this single point of failure, well, one, the single point of failure and two,
524.44s: the valuations are just insane. Like you're, you're overpaying by, you know, it's almost like,
529.96s: you know, if you could, would you buy, you know, would you buy MSTR here? And, you know, and no,
537.00s: because the valuations are, you know, it's trading 230% over Bitcoin. No, I have zero interest.
542.92s: What do you mean? It's intelligent leverage though. It always works.
548.12s: Yeah, it always works because it's a Ponzi scheme and Ponzi schemes always work until they don't,
553.32s: as long as you keep buying the crap, you know, yeah, you can, it's intelligent, you know,
557.80s: I love the term intelligent leverage because I know because if you can buy something,
562.92s: if something's worth a dollar and you can pay $3 for it, it's intelligent leverage if it goes to $4.
569.72s: It's an, it's the dumbest thing ever and a Ponzi scheme if it goes to $2. You know, or $1. So,
576.44s: so it's like, you know, yeah, it's intelligent leverage until it's not. So yeah.
582.52s: Got it. Yeah, the, it's interesting because I, I was in DXYZ for a little while just because I like
588.04s: the idea of SpaceX, I like the idea, I don't know, I'm just fascinated by space, but I'm interested
593.00s: that it's curious that they were pitching those kind of valuations to you for, for something like
597.64s: that, but, oh, they, I mean, you know, these are all, what happens is that people that are,
602.76s: they've been in early, you know, that are early either seed investors, employees, they,
609.16s: what they do is they go to these brokerage firms that are all over the place, you know,
613.56s: different kinds of small investment, registered investment advisors, that kind of thing.
617.24s: And they package together anywhere between, let's say, $10 million and $50 million worth of
623.64s: equity at, at evaluation, you know, under market, slightly under market, and just because they want
629.80s: out. Right. And, you know, and, and I've done it before and it's been incredibly successful with
636.20s: certain companies and done it before and, you know, I still have open trades left. So I do buy
640.52s: companies that are not public. I did it. My biggest winner was Reddit recently, but I mean,
648.44s: some other ones. And, you know, and we'll see what happens to them. They haven't gone public,
654.68s: and I have no idea, but I must scares me because I consider him to be risk on a lots of different
661.64s: levels. I consider him to be a risk on, you know, on a political level, because at some point,
670.52s: Trump and Musk are like, they're the, they're the odd couple to the extreme, you know, it is the
679.64s: extreme odd couple relationship. And being the best friend or the best buddy of Trump usually doesn't
689.24s: last too long. Like it's, it's, it's not, it's not a position for life. Let's put it that way. And
697.00s: neither Trump or Elon have a lot of friends in the world. I don't think other than, you know,
701.80s: each other right now. So I don't see either of those two guys lasting as friends. And I think it's
706.60s: going to hurt both of them when that comes crashing to a halt. So I do think that's a single point of
711.64s: failure. Yeah. And that's a really interesting perspective. Because when I look at the relationship,
716.76s: I can see elements that they clearly align. But then I can see elements that they clearly don't.
722.44s: And I was always curious how that was going to flesh out specifically like the EV side of things,
727.80s: right? Because they're talking about getting rid of the EV credit and whatnot that obviously would
731.80s: naturally not be helpful. But I just took it is like a net weight positive meaning they align
738.76s: on more than they disagreed. I assume you're thinking sooner or later that on wines. And I have no,
744.12s: I have no clue. I just, I think here, let's put it this way. I think it's price to perfection.
750.68s: Fair enough. It's like, it's like the perfect marriage. But it's like, it's like a made for TV
759.48s: marriage, you know, like whatever that bachelor or whatever it is. Yeah. That's what we need.
764.12s: The older bachelor type thing. And it's a made for TV marriage that in six months or 12 months
770.04s: for now, you're going to like, they're not even talking to each other. You know, that's the way I see it.
774.28s: Well, well, we'll have to put a line on it and see how it goes because that's a fun,
778.28s: that's a fun, I'm sure. If you could bet on it, if there was an event-based contract on this,
784.28s: I think this would be the one that I might mortgage the house for.
790.04s: I love it. Now, the other thing I was curious about is why are there drones above New Jersey?
803.80s: That bothers a lot of people. You know what? So crazy. That does not bother me for some reason.
809.80s: Like of all the nutty things that drive me crazy and all the things that people worry about,
816.12s: there are so many people at this, even an art firm that are all bent out of shape about this.
821.40s: And for me, I couldn't care less.
825.88s: It's been, I find it so entertaining listening to all of the different conspiracy theories.
832.12s: That is always one of the funnest things. I mean, if somebody want to buy New Jersey,
835.56s: do they want to take over New Jersey? I mean, we will, you know, we will trade New Jersey for like,
840.20s: I mean, maybe we can, I'm trying to think what's about the size of New Jersey is pretty big.
845.00s: I mean, maybe we can get Sweden for it or something. Like, you know, I'd love to have to make a trade.
850.92s: I think we would, I think everybody would do that in a heartbeat. Like Sweden for Jersey.
855.24s: I like, yeah, that's not even close. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what the drones are.
858.12s: I'm not sure what the game plan is. But, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, like if you add to pick a state,
862.68s: would you pick Jersey? Sure. Go ahead, take it. Well, we're okay with that.
865.88s: So maybe it's the aliens taking Jersey. You heard it here first. Everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
871.32s: No, no, I actually, the whole, the whole drone thing for some reason, I just can't get into it. I don't care.
879.56s: That surprises me. It's just so weird to not care at all. I can get like,
884.04s: I can't sleep at all. At all, at all, at all. Because I'm not an alien person.
889.96s: I'm not a UFO person. You know, like, I know now zero zero.
895.48s: The universe is huge. That's zero zero. The only ones.
900.36s: I don't know if we're the only ones, but I'm not a, yes, here were the only ones.
906.76s: You're never going to get me. You're never, ever going to get me to bite on the whole alien,
912.36s: the whole alien thing with the only one. We're going to have to start throwing it out there somehow.
917.88s: Maybe put some like orbs outside your window at night. Get you see in the fly.
921.24s: It's whatever you got to do. I'm not good with that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not good.
926.92s: And just that a general curious. Is it just that it's like not tangible enough to really think
931.16s: about it, spend time thinking about other stuff? Yeah, right. Yeah.
934.68s: Right. Totally see that. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of tangible stuff, what was like a really solid
941.88s: trade that you made this year? Solid trades for this year.
951.32s: I did okay across the board hanging in there with my Concertion plays. So I'll give you some
962.04s: examples. Yeah. All year I hung in Long China. It didn't do anything, but it paid all year.
970.52s: I hung in, you know, the dollar got killed all year. I stayed. I stayed. I mean, sorry, the
976.60s: dollars. The dollar went up on current. And I basically stayed short dollar and survived.
987.32s: There were a lot of different groups like that. Like all year, I stayed on the long side of the
996.20s: bond market and made money. Like it's kind of crazy. But I hung in with positions that had
1004.60s: that traded range bound anything that was range bound in 2024. We did really well. Like we hung
1012.76s: in there all year on the range bound stuff. I'm trying to think right at the top of my head,
1017.80s: like what would be the best? Trying to. It doesn't have to be the top performer,
1026.20s: but just something that you thought was a solid, a solid trade.
1029.56s: I mean, there were a few equities that I did really well in this year. But the most, I would say,
1039.88s: oh boy, I'm going to say I probably did the best all year with my bond position because I
1047.16s: seemed to be on the right side of the bond market the whole year. Let's think if there was anything
1053.16s: else. I was on the right side of crude oil most this year in the equity marketplace.
1062.20s: In the equity marketplace, I didn't have too many stumbles. I think my most challenging stocks
1067.80s: in the equity world this year were Tesla and the second half. Tesla really since the election
1072.60s: before that was fine. In video early on the year. And we might have got a little chopped up in some
1080.76s: some weird earnings place over the course of the year. But for the most part, I think I traded the
1085.56s: year pretty good. Were you trading the 10 years, 30 years all of them? All of them. 10, 30s,
1094.44s: five, five, two's mostly in yield curve trades. But the 10s and 30s, I mean, I'm still long 10s and 30s
1101.64s: tonight playing the little bit of the Fed number tomorrow, but I went home long 10s and 30s.
1110.36s: And what's the general position you're taking on just futures and then rolling them as they move
1116.36s: along or anything more complicated than that? Yeah, futures and short puts. Got it. And long futures
1124.92s: short puts. Yep. And with the Fed rate announcement, are you looking to play that as an event
1133.48s: itself or is this more of a thematic drift post rate event? I'm not playing the actual event itself.
1144.84s: I don't trade the actual number. I think that to trade to trade a Fed number, you kind of have to be
1154.76s: to trade the Fed number itself. You really have to be in the pits or you have to be
1163.88s: in the pits. You kind of have to be a market maker. I don't think you can trade the actual number
1170.28s: just as an outsider. But if you are, if you're making markets, you can trade the number. If you're
1178.68s: not, I don't think you can. Why do you think that? Just the old market maker in me. I just think
1186.12s: you're too disadvantaged, speed wise and edge wise. You can't really, it's not that it's not,
1193.64s: it's just because you can't see the order flow around you. So it's hard to tell what's going on.
1199.24s: How would you differ that compared to something like an earnings play?
1203.48s: There's no difference. An earnings play is the same thing. An earnings play, any kind of a
1207.16s: binary event is instant gratification. There's no real edge. I consider the Fed number and the
1217.00s: earnings play is the same. Except the only difference on Fed numbers. I don't see a big volatility
1223.40s: collapse on Fed numbers. So I don't like selling a lot of premium going to Fed numbers. The bond
1229.48s: premium just doesn't seem to come in. Whereas if you're doing an earnings play, the earnings premium
1234.44s: comes in dramatically. So it's not exactly the same thing. For whatever reason, the bond premium
1240.76s: just doesn't come in. I always lay it out. So tomorrow, I will lay out bond premium prior to
1246.76s: the number. But I just don't seem to get paid that much on it. It's like a struggle.
1251.80s: Yeah, just have to do it because you got to do it. I get it. Yeah, it's interesting. I actually
1256.92s: did a study looking back, especially this year. I was really curious about the FOMC
1260.84s: meetings. So I looked back at the movement and volatility. And I found a similar thing to what
1265.56s: you found. But the thing that differed was the size of the rate change. It had an impact on the
1273.08s: volatility movement. So yeah, which I thought that that was pretty interesting. And I was
1277.88s: I'm actually really curious to see how it works on a on a quarter point real life. Like what
1281.64s: it's going to do tomorrow. Now specifically for earnings has your team tracked the variance
1290.68s: risk premiums around earnings like back over a specific time frame. The question I want to ask
1296.92s: is I'm wondering if you've seen a contraction in the amount of risk premium that you can get from
1304.68s: selling premium through an earnings event as compared to five years ago or 10 years ago.
1309.08s: There's it's a it's a it's a little bit of a loaded question because on if you ask me that
1320.84s: question, if I had to generalize, I would say yes, markets are more efficient today than they were
1327.80s: five years ago. So the pricing becomes more efficient because we're trading in tighter markets.
1332.92s: So the answer is yeah, but earnings are no different than any other kind of
1339.08s: binary event and they really depend on the levels of implied volatility. I find that earnings
1344.68s: in markets like we're in right now are incredibly difficult when volatility is low and stock markets high,
1352.44s: the implied earnings moves are too low for me. And I like earnings moves when volatility is high
1359.24s: and the earnings moves can get sometimes they feel like they can be much bigger.
1363.32s: Like what makes me nervous is 357 and even in some cases 10 or 11%. What makes me less nervous is
1371.48s: when it's when it's universally the implied moves over 10%, then I feel much better about earnings.
1378.60s: Yeah, I totally can see that. And throughout earnings this year, what were the general themes
1384.92s: you picked off? Was it about flat anything? They were tough. I would say about flat for the year.
1392.12s: We the worst one we've had recently was probably APGO last week. That was a tough one. That move was
1400.52s: insane, you know, from whatever it came out to be like whatever 50 points or whatever the
1408.76s: crazy handle was, you know, on that stock. That was that was an insane move in in AVG on Broadcom.
1418.28s: I, you know, there was nothing you could do. I mean, it was it was so far outside the expected move
1425.16s: than it continued the next day. Today was the first day. There was any relief at all. But the AVGO
1429.96s: move was kind of the most surprising move. My position there was relatively small. So it wasn't
1435.48s: it wasn't disastrous at all, but it was it was a little painful. But that was probably that I can
1440.44s: remember, you know, the recent moves that that was probably the worst thing. The expected move was
1446.44s: like 13 or 15 dollars. The actual move was, you know, all said and done almost 60.
1453.00s: What do you think of seeing really large cap companies moving like this?
1457.56s: Well, what that's a great question because, you know, like there's a couple takeaways from that.
1463.56s: First of all, this was a 750. It's a big company. It was a 750 billion dollar company that went to
1469.00s: like 1.1 trillion. How do you move a fricking steam engine, you know, like a like a like a cruise ship,
1476.76s: you know, around that quickly. How does how does it how does a cruise ship pick up a third of its
1483.56s: value? You know, how does it increase in market cap by 35% in two days? You know, a seven I can see
1491.80s: three billion dollar stock going to four billion. Okay, and going up to 25% but I can't see a
1497.16s: 750 billion dollar stock going up, you know, to 1.1 trillion in two days. I can just blows my mind,
1504.68s: just on just on an earnings outlook. So I think there's a couple takeaways from that. One is
1511.24s: why do I even need to trade biotechs? Why do I need to trade small cap stocks? Because if you're
1517.88s: going to get that kind of liquidity and that kind of stock, there's no reason to trade something
1521.64s: junky. And then and then the other takeaways, you know, maybe this is a this is indicative of the
1528.44s: level of, you know, speculation, complacency, just market greed that's going on right now. And I
1536.60s: think it's a scary red flag. I purposely asked that question because there's been a few instances of
1544.12s: moves like this that have stuck out to me in just these really, really large companies using AVGO
1549.16s: for an example, obviously this one had again, not just to find the move, but it did have a catalyst.
1554.84s: Who do you think saw the outcome of that cat? Like who's the volume that's buying it at 240?
1563.32s: I have no idea. I mean, there's obviously some of it is, some of it is shorts and some of it is,
1573.16s: you know, different, uh, profferms just trying to get in front of it and race it a little bit. I mean,
1581.88s: there's there's a skill. It's almost like being a poker player at some point. There are,
1588.52s: it's a trillion dollar stock. So you can't move it around with like, you know, your pinky type thing.
1593.88s: But there are games that are played in stocks like this where they think that there's enough short
1601.00s: interest and enough weekends that they can, you know, maybe they maybe they felt there's the
1607.96s: potential for a little bit of a gamma squeeze. Maybe they felt that, you know, there there was a certain
1615.00s: that it was susceptible to a little bit of short covering. I don't really know, but that move at
1620.76s: that point, you know, like who's buying it up there? I have no clue. I want to be covering shorts.
1626.60s: Yeah. I'm just curious like who who's because I just similar thought presses you like how does this
1632.20s: grow this much as the overall market cap and then people like the companies not worth either it was
1637.72s: grossly undervalued right or now it's grossly overvalued, but it doesn't go up 40% in two days.
1643.56s: Right. So then for this kind of move, if it is shorts, how long do you think it hangs up at a
1651.96s: place like that before that the short participation is essentially flat now and then it starts
1657.16s: returning back to earth? It's hard to say. I mean, it was down like 12 bucks today. So started to come
1661.72s: back a little bit to earth today. It depends. It's probably not like just because it rallied whatever
1668.76s: 60 points, doesn't mean it's going to go back 30 or anything like that. Maybe it's going to go back,
1672.84s: you know, 15, 25 points or something like that. And then maybe it's just that's good. You know,
1678.04s: maybe that was the root. It's got to it's got to find its level of what it's, you know,
1681.88s: what the new valuation is because it's clearly going to carry a new valuation. Right. And see what
1686.36s: happens. You can't get hung up on these trades. You got to you got to just trade and move on.
1692.92s: Definitely. For me, it's just fascinating. Like the under the underlying market activity that
1697.80s: leads to that is very interesting to me because yeah, exactly. It's just anomalous. Yeah,
1703.08s: if you've ever traded in those kind of stocks, it's it's very emotional. And sometimes, you know,
1708.92s: you can't explain it until things slow down. Yeah. When you're looking out over 25. Yeah. What are
1716.92s: the bigger themes that you're looking to play? Well, I think 25 is going to be a super interesting
1726.84s: year because I do not think that we are looking at a repeat of 2017. 2017 was a year that we
1734.76s: didn't even move 1% and the market just took it easy and tried to figure out, you know, what
1741.00s: was going on in this new Trump administration and the market was trying to figure out. You know,
1746.60s: wasn't really sure how to play it. So it grounded itself higher for the entire year. No 1% moves
1751.64s: all year was incredibly boring and all of a sudden in 2018, you know, the crap at the fan type thing.
1759.08s: I would think that all of that is going to be accelerated dramatically in 2025.
1766.76s: There is the biggest risk to the market in my opinion is that
1773.48s: is that the market, you know, remember, the market generally doesn't do that well under Republican
1781.40s: presence. The market generally doesn't generally doesn't do that well after it's had a move like it's
1787.32s: had this, you know, this year. I mean, we had an insane move the last, basically, the last two years.
1794.52s: And it would be normal for the market to be a little more jittery next year. And plus, I don't
1801.48s: mean Eric, I don't even know the last time that the consensus has been unanimous.
1809.88s: Like when you think about it, you know, think about all the years you've been following the market.
1814.36s: Think about all the times you've heard people talk about things. When have you ever heard a
1819.56s: unanimous consensus on anything? Normal level lower and draw. Yeah, I mean, there is not a single
1827.80s: freaking person that thinks that we're not, you know, that doesn't have a projection up 10, 15,
1832.76s: 20% for next year. And it's universal. It is, it is unanimous. It doesn't happen. I mean,
1839.16s: they can't even get unanimous on a high level. They can't do deal with savings. They can't get
1845.40s: unanimous on a high-spin trophy winner or a whole fame player. I was Derek Cheater, not a
1850.44s: unanimous choice. Like I'm just saying, you know, like it's insane.
1856.12s: It's funny. One of the things I use as an example of just
1859.96s: government is the fact that daylight savings is still a thing. And we know that there's a bunch
1865.24s: of studies about daylight savings like the day after like increasing car crashes, hard attacks,
1870.12s: like from the lack of sleep that hour of sleep that's missed. It's incredible. And yet we still
1876.28s: visible. So do you know why they do it? I was surprised. I thought it was something to do with
1882.60s: agriculture and farming. That's what I've heard. Okay, great. But I'd love to know because I don't get
1888.04s: it. It might have been originally, but that's not why they kept it. So the argument, the argument on
1894.44s: the house floor was the reason to keep it is that they didn't want kids going to school,
1903.32s: walking to school in the dark. For all the kids that walked to school.
1908.52s: All the kids that go to school early in the morning, you know, they didn't want to stay dark till,
1912.76s: you know, kids that go to school before 730 in the morning, they didn't want to go to school in the dark.
1918.92s: Give them a flashlight. Be all right. Yeah, that's the reason. I'm not, I would prefer no
1928.52s: daylight savings, but that is the reason. And that's why it didn't pass.
1932.20s: Because now they all just what get to walk home in the dark? Is that better? Because that's
1935.64s: what it gets dark at like three. I guess. I don't, I don't know the answer. So that
1942.28s: all right. Fine. It's good to walk in the dark at one point, but not the other. All right. Whatever.
1948.52s: Well, my answer would be well, how do they, how do they figure it out in places where it's
1952.12s: always dark? I don't know. Somehow, somehow we were actually, we were just looking at maybe going
1957.32s: to Fairbanks to go see the Northern Lights until I realized that at 2 p.m. in the afternoon,
1963.24s: it was negative 27. And then I told Mel, I was just like, yo, I don't know if you got a jacket big
1969.48s: enough. Negative 27. One of the suns up. That's cold, man. Well, Chicago gets cold, but.
1976.12s: Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't, that's a, the Northern Lights thing is a tough one.
1981.32s: Yeah, we saw, we saw when we were in Iceland and it was, it was fine. Like it, it wasn't,
1986.28s: it wasn't that cold there. That was pretty mellow. But yeah, the, that quickly got axed off the
1991.96s: list. We're going to go to Calgary now. Go to another cold place. It's just not as cold.
1997.40s: That's the idea. Negative 27 hurts. Yeah. That's like, I'm not afraid of the cold, but that is like,
2004.36s: you, you have to be careful because your skin starts to crack. That's next level cold,
2009.32s: because I did Mount Warfare training and my eyebrows would freeze. And then like, if I move my face,
2015.96s: I would get cracks in my eyebrows. And I start to bleed. I was just like, yeah, okay, this is,
2021.16s: this is a little too much. So I had to put like petroleum jelly. Make sure that my eyebrows.
2025.48s: Yeah, that's, yeah, that's kind of the, yeah, you don't want to do it. At some point, when you're
2030.84s: young and you can, you know, you can pull that off and go out without a shirt on, sure, no problem.
2037.32s: At this point, ain't worth it. Yeah, it's something you got to ask yourself, like, what,
2041.08s: what am I really doing here? We have to get you out of here in a few minutes. So I want to pivot
2047.64s: and I want to talk about the beginner trader. So we've talked about this, we've talked about this
2053.48s: a few times and I know that this is something you spend a lot of time with the research that you
2056.76s: guys put out and whatnot. So if there was somebody that was going to start trading in 2025 for their
2063.88s: first year ever, what advice would you give them? Well, I mean, I would be excited for them because
2076.60s: the one thing that you have to realize when you start because you're never going to pick the
2079.96s: ideal time. It's like not possible. I mean, because I don't even know what the ideal time is. But
2085.56s: what, the way I would approach somebody that's just starting out the way I would explain trading and
2090.68s: finance them is that for the rest of your life, you're going to do this. Like, you're never going to
2095.88s: stop. One, two, get bitten and you, and you start to understand market structure and, you know,
2102.44s: markets and finance and strategy and trading and all the above, you're going to do it forever.
2108.68s: Like, it's going to change the way you think, it's going to change the way you think about, you know,
2112.92s: wealth creation, it's going to change the way you think about business, entrepreneurship,
2117.72s: every decision you make is going to be, you're going to be able to put it and quantify things
2122.84s: and put it into mathematical terms. I think that it's just, you know, that's how I would explain
2129.00s: trading to somebody who's just starting out. I would be like, listen, you're going to do this at
2132.92s: some point. If you're going to be successful, if you're going to acquire wealth, whatever it is,
2138.36s: you're going to do this at some point. And, or you're going to need to know this stuff.
2143.00s: And so just start. Doesn't matter. Just start.
2148.36s: Natural follow-up question is, how do I start?
2152.28s: Yeah, well, you know, yeah, that is one. And I mean, the simple answer is, you know, you have to,
2160.52s: you open up a brokerage account with it, hopefully with Tasty, but with a good, you know,
2167.00s: software platform. And, and you just do something. I don't care if you buy one share or stock,
2173.64s: sell, buy or sell one option, you know, do anything by some crypto. It doesn't even matter.
2178.84s: It does it, whatever you do, doesn't matter. You're learning new technology, new markets, new strategies,
2185.32s: new opportunities. And that's, you have to get started by doing something. You know,
2190.44s: I don't know how else to, I don't know how else to, I don't know how to sugarcoat it.
2194.84s: Yeah, well, and I think you hit one of the really important points as far as I'm concerned, is that when,
2199.48s: because I, I started in 07, which was like a middle time, there was information you could find,
2206.76s: but not a ton. You obviously started when they were writing it on stone tablets. So the information
2211.64s: was a little bit different. But for, for people today, they have AI, they have stuff, and it almost
2218.84s: feels like they deal with information overload. Like I have to research this, I have to research,
2223.80s: this, I have to research this. So you're kind of talking about do something that's similar to you,
2228.68s: like find something that's small, not a ton of risk, and do something.
2232.92s: Do something. Just do something. Make it, make it actionable, make it practical, but do something.
2238.60s: Don't just sit there, you know, like people learn by doing better than anything else.
2243.80s: Completely agree. And for the trader that's starting then over their first year,
2249.08s: what should they be focusing on? Like what are the things that you think matter most?
2253.32s: Number of trades. I know that's going to sound like self-serving and weird, but that's not.
2258.92s: The number of trades purely, this is, this is, this is a numbers game. And in order to get to a number
2265.64s: that, that helps you understand something, you've got to just do it. You know, like, like, you,
2272.12s: you're, you're not going to, there's nothing you can learn by just watching and not participating.
2277.40s: And I think in the trading world, it's, it's, it may be more true than anywhere else.
2283.56s: You have to participate. So that would be my.
2287.64s: And how do they balance participation with probably small account size, limited number of
2293.00s: trades that can go on at a given point in time? Yeah, that's exactly just small size, you know,
2298.36s: it could be one or two or 10 shares to stock. It could be the amount of money you make or lose
2303.16s: is not really relevant. You know, the option trades could be tiny, a couple pennies, you know,
2307.72s: a couple dollars, a couple of divine, divine wrist spreads, but nothing that requires a lot of capital.
2313.40s: And it's just, you know, you've got to get your, you've just got to get your feet wet. You got
2321.56s: to dip your toe. You got to do whatever it doesn't matter. You know, I mean, everybody that does
2326.60s: anything starts somewhere. Like it's, it's like, you know, people say, well, I don't know why you
2332.04s: started. I don't want to do it. Well, anytime you do anything, you know, the first time you pick up,
2336.36s: hit a golf ball the first time, you know, you, I don't know, do whatever it is you do, no matter
2341.88s: where you had a first time, just start it, just do it. I love it. And a couple of follow-on
2348.68s: questions for a different skill category. You have somebody that's been trading for years, so
2353.00s: getting their feet under them. What are some of the things you think a beginner trader does to turn
2360.44s: the corner into like an intermediate trader? Like what are the things that they focus on think
2365.16s: about that kind of stuff? Yeah. So, so that's where it starts to get a little more challenging and
2369.72s: a little more important. I think the, the, the, the term I like to use is that that beginner trader
2376.28s: before they, they need to, they need to get to the another level because they need to prove
2382.36s: that everything is repeatable and it's scalable because until they do that, they, you know,
2388.28s: they don't know what they have. So I call this the, the, the proof of concept stage, you know,
2394.60s: you, you have to have a proof of concept. And, um, uh, and so, you know, this is the, this is the
2403.96s: challenging part where you have to prove, hey, I can do this repeatedly, you know, like, like,
2411.00s: that's, I'm not a one, I'm not a one hit wonder, I'm not a one trick pony, I can do this repeatedly,
2416.76s: and I'm proving concept. And how do you think that trader does that in a time frame where the market
2425.64s: might show them one thing, the market might just show you up. So, the market, the market, unfortunately,
2432.44s: you know, the market's never going to do exactly what you wanted to do. So I don't know the answer
2438.12s: to that because, you know, that's a tough one. And you're going to have to have opinions and you're
2443.32s: probably going to be wrong. And so, you know, but, but I don't know the answer.
2447.56s: Well, I feel like one of the things to plug for you guys is your back testing tool because I,
2452.68s: like, I do think that can give somebody an idea to test ideas out in a market that they might not see
2458.20s: because the, yeah, the path dependent nature of a market, I find that to be one of the really
2462.84s: tricky things for people is when they've been trading three, four years, but the market's been doing
2466.04s: one thing. And then when it finally turns, they're like all out of the sorts because they just
2470.36s: not seen that before. So actually, you guys got something. I'm worried about that. I'm worried
2474.44s: that there's an entire generation now. Like, there's literally an entire generation that has never
2482.28s: seen a downtick. Well, if you, I don't know, I think of it as if somebody started in 2020,
2489.00s: anytime around there where a lot of people did, they actually got to see quite a lot in a short
2492.84s: term timeframe because they got to see a pretty sharp contraction, the unbelievable reversal of
2500.76s: like a three day bear market, which is like untold. But then they also got a bear market in 22,
2506.60s: which is kind of cool. Market was a little bit of a bear market in 2022. I'm not sure
2512.28s: the impact, but yeah, they did. You're right. I forgot about 2022. Yeah, they did. Yeah,
2516.76s: because I actually, I was thinking about it. And again, like, I started in 07, but I've only seen
2521.56s: three bear markets and two of them have been in the last four years. So I've been, I've been seeing
2527.08s: the same pitch non-stop, same thing. Yes, been wild. Yeah. And that leads me to the last question.
2534.76s: When the market eventually does roll over, always does with valuations where they are, where AVGO
2543.96s: grows by 40%. How do you think a potential unwind slash correction bear market might look?
2552.12s: Nobody knows, but might look. This is the, this is the billion dollar question, you know.
2558.20s: This is the billion dollar question. Let's make some money. Tom, let's get this right.
2561.88s: I know. We can cash in. Yeah. I spent a lot of time thinking about this because on the one hand,
2568.36s: you know, I don't want the markets to implode and crash and burn all that kind of stuff because,
2575.00s: you know, everybody's inherently long. It's good for the world. You know, I'm a glass half full person.
2580.60s: So I don't want that to happen. The other side to it is I've never felt stronger about the risks,
2592.44s: like the pod odds risk in the market right now. Like what do I think that we could go higher? Sure.
2598.28s: There's a chance we could go, I think maybe 6,300, let's just say we're 6,100 now, maybe 6,300.
2606.52s: I don't, I don't see us going too much higher than that, but there's a chance.
2611.08s: The flip side of this whole thing, I can see us going down to 5,100 almost overnight,
2615.08s: which means I've got like four to one downside over upside. Easy. Maybe it's five to one.
2623.16s: And I am a pure pod odds contrarian. So that's my biggest hurdle that I've got to overcome in my head here.
2632.92s: I think there's $5 or $4 or $5 of risk for every $1 upside. And when I get my head in that space,
2639.80s: it's very difficult to think objectively. So that's where I'm challenged with right now.
2647.72s: So if that downside realizes what do you think it's a faster move or do you think it's something?
2655.16s: Oh yeah, the downside moves are always faster. There's not even, there's so many red flags right now,
2661.72s: which is like there's not even put skew anymore in the indexes. I mean the red flags are like,
2667.00s: the skew is 170. There's no, that's the rating on outlaw. The market is so anticipating
2675.72s: outlier risk that probably won't happen. But the skew numbers are off the charts.
2681.00s: There is no put skew, which happens about 10 or 12% of the time, which is insane.
2685.96s: And there's, and there is this unanimous bullishness among everybody. It's not,
2693.88s: it's not, are we going higher? It's how high? And we might not.
2701.48s: I don't know. I mean, the downside scares me. And I don't think any, the other problem is,
2706.12s: I don't think anybody's short. Usually like I think shorts are there and they can pick up and cover
2710.04s: some stuff. Man, I don't see it. Well, on that rosy note, it's time to get you out of here. You
2716.28s: got to run into some traffic, but always great to connect with you for people that want to find
2721.00s: you obviously tasty live all through all the links in the notes below. But anything else you
2724.76s: want to leave people with any events you have coming up? No, we just finished all our events for
2730.52s: we did, I think 26 events this year was insane. I've been on the road for like 11 straight weeks.
2735.88s: I know you kind of every time I talk to you, you're in the middle of going somewhere coming back.
2739.48s: Yeah, I literally, I mean, I'm a junkie and I love it. So like, I'm not doing it because I have to.
2745.96s: I do because I love it. But I'm not going back on the road until May. So yeah, so I've got a
2753.64s: couple of months off now because I've been, I've been on the road for half of this year. Are you going
2759.00s: to go stir crazy? No, no. Okay, you'll be all right. Yeah, I need to be all right. My daughters
2765.48s: having a baby, my son's getting married. I got a lot of stuff going on. You got tons of stuff
2768.84s: anyways. Good. Yeah. Well, I'm stoked to hear the families doing well and keeping you busy. That's
2773.32s: the way it should be. We got to keep you running around because you're doing a lot of good out
2776.92s: there. So thanks for hanging out Tom. All right. Love it. Thanks, Eric.
