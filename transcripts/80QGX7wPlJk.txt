0.00s:  What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have saws now, ready to wrap
7.16s:  up 2024 stellar year. Super fun time. How'd you fare out there?
15.52s:  How did I fare? I think it was an average, you know, I'm a contrarian. So it's a little
22.44s:  bit of a, you know, when you have a straight one, one dimensional, one directional market,
29.48s:  sometimes that gets a little tough for me. I had probably only really one horrible trade
36.48s:  all year and the rest I think was like a, you know, was a pretty average year for me.
43.40s:  I did not knock the ball out of the park this year and I didn't get hurt either. It was just
49.16s:  it was about an average year. I should have done better, but I was, I sold out some,
57.24s:  passive longs a little too early. I guess. Yeah. And you actually preamble into the next question,
64.36s:  two questions I had for you. Is I always think it's a weird question to ask, but I'm always
69.72s:  curious to the response like of a trade that was memorable for a good reason and bad reason,
75.56s:  not necessarily best trade, worst trade, but memorable trades. And again, positive memory,
81.72s:  and then negative memory. What takes you to a dark place? It sounds like you had a bad trade.
85.80s:  I'd love to hear about that one. Was it in video? Yeah. My worst trade of the year was in video.
91.88s:  But it was in video because I got stupid. That's all. It wasn't in video because, you know,
100.36s:  I am a person that completely accepts the fact that sometimes the stock wins.
106.52s:  You know, I mean, I've had, I'm going to assume I've had hundreds of thousands,
111.48s:  if not millions of losing trades in my career. So I would think that I'm very comfortable,
117.80s:  you know, not being right. I think that's, you know, I can't be millions. So hundreds of thousands
125.80s:  would say, and so I'm okay, you know, losing to a good competitor, you know, like a worthy opponent.
135.96s:  But in the case of Nvidia, I got a little pig headed towards the end of that move.
140.68s:  And just did some stupid things. So yeah, that was my worst trade of the year, you know, walk,
145.08s:  walk me through the stupid things size. And was it initial size or was it
152.68s:  standard size? It was, it was, it was what I call angry size. Love that. That's good. A little bit
158.76s:  of revenge trade. We all need that in our lives. Yeah. Yeah. It was a little bit. Well, it wasn't,
162.84s:  yeah, I never got to the point where I even deserved revenge. I was, you know, it was,
167.72s:  it was just an angry, you know, ego-tistical, you know, like you can't hurt me, you know,
173.40s:  like you can't hurt me. So I'm going to go and, you know, I knew I couldn't move the markets.
179.56s:  So I just thought, you know, I was getting into the right price. And I was about three or four
185.16s:  months early. Got it. And what was the scaling and protocol that you did? Was it anything specific
192.76s:  or was it based on feel like as you saw it do something? It was based on ego. It was, it was
197.80s:  the worst kind of scale. It's ego scale. I'm not a, I'm not a, a scalar type trader. I'm a,
206.20s:  I'm a lump summer. That's what I call it. Yeah. I'm purely a lump summer. So I'm not,
213.72s:  I'm not somebody that dollar costs average. I don't roll in over time. You know, I don't
218.84s:  allocate it in over time. I'm usually one of the reasons that I've been able to hang around
223.96s:  this business for so long and not really ever get hurt is because I don't add to losing trades
230.04s:  very often at all. For me to add to losing trade. Yeah. For me to add to losing trade is
236.04s:  incredibly rare. Like I can accept losing, but I won't take myself down by adding to lose trade.
241.56s:  Like I'm not pig headed about it. I don't fall in love with my freaking trades. But um,
246.20s:  every once in a while, I do something pretty fucking stupid. And that would be, you know, like,
251.56s:  I'll just let my ego go in the way. And I just did it yesterday in Tesla. And I'm like six
256.84s:  months ago in, in, in video. But the rest of the time I'm pretty good. It's so funny. I was
262.04s:  literally just going to ask you about this move in Tesla. So beautiful. What do you think of it?
267.16s:  The move in Tesla's ridiculous. I mean, it's ridiculous. I mad, I'm mad about it. Not because
274.68s:  of not even because of the move in Tesla, but because of what I feel like is, is a,
282.12s:  it's just something that, um, you look at that. I feel like, I feel like this whole Tesla thing
289.96s:  is such a bad indictment of what's going on in America right now. And what's going on in politics
298.68s:  all over like it kind of makes me sick. And so, um, you know, I don't like the fact that, that,
307.72s:  all of a sudden the president sees for sale. I don't like that at all. I don't like the fact that
312.84s:  the idea of a cleaning of, of cleaning out the swamp is really making the swamp that much worse.
320.20s:  I just feel like it's a very dangerous precedent to set. Incredibly dangerous.
326.68s:  So when you see stocks like this gap up after the election is known, is that the, the way that
332.20s:  you're thinking is that this is, do you think that this is like forecasting future policy decisions?
337.56s:  And that's being priced in. Or do you think this is, yeah, I don't think it's forecasting future
342.04s:  policy decisions. I think it's forecasting. I don't think it's forecasting anything. When I think
347.56s:  it is, it's making a statement that, hey, you know what, if you're willing to, um, if you're
354.12s:  willing to commit a certain amount of loyalty, which could be measured in hundreds of millions or
358.84s:  billions of dollars, we're willing to give you whatever you want. Even though this is a democracy,
364.20s:  it doesn't matter. Um, you know, that's kind of, that's what it means. And what do you think of that
370.52s:  in context again? Like if we look within the energy sector, we know that there's a bunch of stuff
377.80s:  in there that is doing well, but then there's also buckets that are doing poorly.
384.28s:  And to me, that would indicate that it's starting to think about
389.32s:  in forecast policy expectations. So if we think that we're going to drill more, things that
393.88s:  drill will probably be doing well. If we think that we're going to roll back green energy, green
398.44s:  energy companies are probably not going to do as well. Do you think that's part of this or now?
402.68s:  If it's, if it's part of a platform, I am, it doesn't bother me at all because that's already
408.68s:  priced into the market. So if you're talking about, you know, a political party platform, then I'm
415.88s:  fine with that because that's, that's what, you know, that's what people voted for. And, um,
422.44s:  and that was known all along. So efficient market theory says that that's already priced into
427.00s:  the market. I have no issue with that. I don't think there's been a change in policy. So I,
431.88s:  I think that's already priced in. I'm talking about something different. Yeah, I see. Yeah, and I
437.72s:  can pick up that nuance. That's why I use this example to understand the nuance, which makes sense.
441.80s:  Yeah, I don't care about things that are, you know, like if you, if you campaign that, hey, you
446.92s:  know, I'm, this is, this is who I am. This is our party platform. Then that's fine. No problem.
453.00s:  I see. Yeah. And then did you see there's a ETF? It's called DXYZ. It's like the Destiny 100. It's
459.88s:  kind of like a smaller, a smaller fund that invests in different kind of non-public companies,
466.20s:  SpaceX being one of them. And that also flew off the handle. I don't know if that's something that
471.72s:  you picked up on your radar or not. I don't trade that. It makes me a little nervous when they say
477.88s:  that ETFs are investing in non-public companies. I don't know exactly what that means and what
484.92s:  valuation. There are some insane valuations. And I think you got to be really careful about,
490.36s:  you know, I don't think there's a bigger, I would almost say right now in the listed markets
498.60s:  that Elon Musk might be a bigger single point of failure risk than Trump even. So I,
506.84s:  it makes me very nervous to have any investments. And I was shown the SpaceX deal like three times
512.52s:  already. Different chances to get into SpaceX. And I had zero interest. Really? Yeah. Zero.
520.84s:  Just because this single point of failure. Well, one, the single point of failure and two,
524.44s:  the valuations are just insane. Like you're you're overpaying by, you know, it's almost like,
530.68s:  if you could, would you buy, would you buy MSTR here? And, you know, and no, because the valuations
538.20s:  are, you know, it's trading 230% over Bitcoin. No, I have zero interest.
542.68s:  Well, it's intelligent leverage though. It always works.
548.20s:  Yeah, it always works because it's a Ponzi scheme and Ponzi schemes always work until they don't
553.24s:  as long as you keep buying the craft. You know, yeah, you can, it's intelligent. You know,
557.88s:  I love the term intelligent leverage because if you can buy something, if something's worth a
563.88s:  dollar and you can pay $3 for it, it's intelligent leverage if it goes to $4. It's an, it's the
570.68s:  dumbest thing ever and a Ponzi scheme if it goes to $2. You know, or $1. So, so it's like, you
577.64s:  know, yeah, it's intelligent leverage until it's not. So yeah. Got it. Yeah. The, it's interesting
584.44s:  because I was in DX YZ for a little while just because I like the idea of SpaceX. I like the
589.64s:  idea. I don't know. I'm just fascinated by space. But I'm interested that it's curious that
594.20s:  they were pitching those kind of valuations to you for, for something like that. But,
598.68s:  oh, they, I mean, you know, these are all what happens is that people that are, they've been in
603.32s:  early, you know, that are early, either seed investors or, like, employees, they, what they do is
609.88s:  they go to these brokerage firms that are all over the place, you know, different kinds of small
614.52s:  investment, registered investment advisors, that kind of thing. And they package together
619.48s:  anywhere between, let's say, $10 million and $50 million worth of equity at, at evaluation,
625.64s:  you know, under market, slightly under market. And just because they want out. And, um, you know,
632.76s:  and, and I've done it before and it's been incredibly successful with certain companies and
637.48s:  done it before. And, you know, I still have open trade slaps. So I do buy companies that are not
641.40s:  public. Um, I did it. My biggest winner was Reddit recently, but I mean some other ones. And, um,
652.44s:  you know, and we'll see what happens. They're not, they haven't gone public it. I have no idea. But
655.64s:  I must scarce me because I consider him to be risk on a lots of different levels. I consider him
663.72s:  to be a risk on, you know, on a political level because at some point, um, Trump and Musk are like,
673.96s:  they're the, they're the odd couple to the extreme, you know, it is the extreme odd couple relationship.
681.88s:  And being the best friend or the best buddy of Trump usually doesn't last too long. Like it's,
692.04s:  it's not, um, it's not a position for life. Let's put it that way. And neither Trump or Elon have a
698.84s:  lot of friends in the world. I don't think other than, you know, each other right now. So I don't see
703.40s:  either of those two guys lasting as friends. And I think it's gonna, it's gonna hurt both of them
708.20s:  when that comes crashing to a halt. So I do think that's a single point of failure.
712.76s:  Yeah. And that's a really interesting perspective because when I look at the relationship,
716.76s:  I can see elements that they clearly align. But then I can see elements that they clearly don't.
722.28s:  And I was always curious how that was gonna flesh out specifically like the EV side of things,
727.72s:  right? Because they're talking about getting rid of the EV credit and whatnot that obviously would
731.72s:  naturally not be helpful. But I just took it as like a net weight positive meaning they align on
738.84s:  more than they disagreed. I assume you're thinking sooner or later that on wines. And I have no,
744.04s:  I have no clue. I just, I think here, let's put it this way. I think it's price to perfection.
750.60s:  Fair enough. No. It's like, it's like the perfect marriage. But it's like, it's like a made for
758.92s:  TV marriage, you know, like whatever that bachelor or whatever it is. Yeah. That's what we need.
764.12s:  The older bachelor type thing. And it's a made for TV marriage that in six months or 12 months
770.12s:  for now, you're gonna like, they're not even talking to each other. You know, that's the way I see it.
774.28s:  Well, well, we'll have to put a line on it and see how it goes because that's a fun, that's a fun
778.84s:  bet. I'm sure that's going to be on the, if you could bet on it, if there was an event-based contract
783.56s:  on this, I think this would be the one bet I might mortgage the house for.
791.00s:  I love it. Now, the other thing I was curious about is what, why are there drones above New Jersey?
800.92s:  That father's a lot of people. You know what? So crazy. That does not bother me for some reason.
809.88s:  Like of all the nutty things that drive me crazy and all the things that people worry about,
816.12s:  there are so many people at this, even an art firm that are all bent out of shape about this.
821.40s:  And for me, I couldn't care less. It's been, I find it so entertaining listening to
830.12s:  all of the different conspiracy theories. That is always one of the funnest things.
834.12s:  I mean, if somebody want to buy New Jersey, do they want to take over New Jersey? I mean, we will,
837.80s:  you know, we will trade New Jersey for like, I mean, maybe we can, I'm trying to think what's
843.32s:  about the size of New Jersey is pretty big. I mean, maybe we can get Sweden for it or something.
848.04s:  Like, you know, I'd love to have it. I mean, to make it trade.
851.00s:  I think we would, I think everybody would do that in a heartbeat. Like Sweden for Jersey.
855.24s:  I like, yeah, that's not even close. I'm not sure, I'm not sure what the drones are. I'm not sure
858.60s:  what the game plan is, but, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, like if you had to pick a state,
862.68s:  would you pick Jersey? Sure. Go ahead, take it. We'll broke that.
865.96s:  So maybe it's the aliens taking Jersey. You heard it here first. Everybody.
869.16s:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's good. No, no, I actually, the whole, the whole drone thing
874.28s:  for some reason, I just can't get into it. I don't care.
879.56s:  That surprises me. It's just so weird to not care at all. I could get like,
883.96s:  you're at all, at all, at all, at all, because I'm not an alien person.
889.96s:  I'm not a UFO person. You know, like, I know now zero, zero.
895.48s:  The universe is huge. That's zero. Zero.
898.68s:  The only ones. I don't know if we're the only ones, but I'm not a, yes, here were the only ones.
906.76s:  You're never going to get me. You're never, ever going to get me to bite on the whole alien,
912.36s:  the whole alien tank with the only one. We're going to have to start throwing it out there
917.48s:  somehow. Maybe put some like orbs outside your window at night. Get you see in the fly.
921.32s:  Wherever you got to do. I'm not good with that stuff. Yeah, yeah. I'm not good.
927.64s:  Just at a general curious, is it just that it's like not tangible enough to really think about it,
931.48s:  spend time thinking about other stuff? Yeah, right. Yeah, right.
934.84s:  I can totally see that. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of tangible stuff, what was like a really solid
941.88s:  trade that you made this year? Um, solid trades for this year.
954.20s:  I did okay across the board hanging in there with my contrarian plays. So I'll give you some
962.04s:  examples. Yeah. All year, I hung in long China. It didn't do anything, but it paid all year,
970.60s:  I hung in, you know, the dollar got killed all year. I stayed. I stayed. I mean, sorry, the dollars,
977.24s:  the dollar went up on current. And I basically stayed short dollar and survived.
985.88s:  Um, there were a lot of different groups like that. Like all year, I stayed on, on the long
995.72s:  side of the bond market and made money. Like it's kind of crazy, but, but, um, I hung in with
1003.00s:  positions that had that traded range bound anything that was range bound in 2024.
1009.72s:  Or we did really well. Like we hung in there all year on the range bound stuff. I'm trying to
1016.12s:  think right at the top of my head, like what would be the best, um, trying to.
1023.48s:  It doesn't have to be the top performer, but just something that you thought was a solid, a solid
1029.00s:  trade. I mean, there were a few equities that that I did really well in this year. Um, but
1037.32s:  the most, I would say, oh boy, I'm going to say I probably did the best all year with my
1045.56s:  bond position because I was seemed to be on the right side of the bond market the whole year. Um,
1051.88s:  let's think if there was anything else. I was on the right side of crude oil most this year.
1056.28s:  Um, in the equity marketplace, in the equity marketplace, I didn't have too many stumbles.
1064.84s:  Um, I think my, my most challenging stocks in the equity world this year were Tesla and the second
1070.60s:  hand, Tesla really since the election before that I was fine. Um, in video early on the year. And,
1076.28s:  you know, we might have got a little chopped up in some, you know, some weird earnings place over
1082.20s:  the course of the year, but for the most part, um, I think I traded the year pretty good.
1087.96s:  Were you trading the 10 years, 30 years, all of them? All of them. 10, 30s, um, five,
1095.32s:  five, two's mostly in yield curve trades, but um, the 10s and 30s, I, I mean, I'm still long 10s and 30s
1101.64s:  tonight, um, uh, playing the little bit of the Fed number tomorrow, but I went home long 10s and 30s.
1110.36s:  And what's the, the general position you're taking on just futures and then rolling them as they
1116.20s:  move along or anything more complicated than that. Yeah, futures and short puts. Got it.
1123.56s:  And, you know, long future short puts. Yep. And with the Fed rate announcement,
1131.16s:  are you looking to play that as an event itself? Or is this more of a thematic drift host rate event?
1139.56s:  Um, I, I'm not playing the actual event itself. I don't trade the actual number. I think that, um,
1148.52s:  to trade to trade a, um, a Fed number, you kind of have to be to trade the Fed number itself.
1156.36s:  You, you really, um, have to be, you know, in the pits or, or you have to be, um, uh,
1165.80s:  you kind of have to be a market maker. Like, I don't think you can trade the actual number
1170.36s:  just as a outsider, but if you are, um, um, you know, if you're making markets, yeah,
1177.80s:  you can trade the number if you're not, I don't think you can. Why do you think that?
1181.96s:  Um, just, you know, it's the old market maker in me. It's just, I, I, I just think you're,
1186.20s:  you're too disadvantaged, um, speed wise and, and edge wise. You know, you can't really,
1192.20s:  it's, it's not, it's not, it's, it's just because you can't see the order flow around you.
1196.44s:  So it's hard to tell what's going on. And how would you differ that compared to something like
1201.72s:  an earnings play? There's not, there's no difference. An earnings play is the same thing.
1205.72s:  An earnings play, any kind of a binary event is, you know, instant gratification. There's no,
1211.96s:  there's no real edge. Um, I, I consider the Fed number and the earnings plays the same.
1218.28s:  Except the only difference on Fed numbers, I don't see a, a big volatility collapse on Fed numbers.
1224.92s:  So I don't, I don't like selling a lot of premium going to Fed numbers. The bond premium just
1230.12s:  doesn't seem to come in. Whereas if you're doing a earnings play, the earnings premium comes in
1234.84s:  dramatically. So yeah, it's, it's not exactly the same thing for whatever reason the bond premium
1240.76s:  just doesn't come in. I always lay it out. So tomorrow, I will lay out bond premium prior to
1246.76s:  the number. But, um, I just don't seem to get paid that much on it. It's, it's like a struggle.
1252.04s:  Yeah, just have to do it because you got to do it. I get it. Yeah, it's, it's interesting.
1256.52s:  Because I actually did a study looking back, especially this year, I was really curious about
1260.04s:  the FOMC meeting. So I looked back at the movement and volatility. And I found a similar thing to
1265.32s:  what you found, but the thing that differed was the size of the rate change, it had an impact on
1272.92s:  the volatility movement. So yeah, which I thought that that was pretty interesting. And I was,
1277.88s:  I'm actually really curious to see how it works on a, on a quarter point real life. Like what,
1281.56s:  what it's going to do tomorrow. Now, um, specifically for earnings has your team tracked the
1290.28s:  variance risk premiums around earnings like back over a specific time frame. The question I want to
1296.36s:  ask is I'm wondering if you've seen a contraction in the amount of risk premium that you can get from
1304.68s:  selling premium through an earnings event as compared to five years ago or 10 years ago.
1309.08s:  There's, it's a, it's a, it's a little bit of a loaded question because, um, on, if you ask me
1320.68s:  that question, if I had to generalize, I would say yes, markets are more efficient. Right.
1327.00s:  Today, they were five years ago. So the pricing becomes more efficient because we're trading in
1331.80s:  tighter markets. So the answer is yeah. But earnings are no different than any other kind of, um,
1339.08s:  binary event and they really depend on the levels of implied volatility. I find that earnings
1344.68s:  in markets like we're in right now are incredibly difficult when volatility is low and stock markets high,
1352.44s:  the implied earnings moves are too low for me. And I like earnings moves when volatility is high.
1359.32s:  And the earnings moves can get sometimes, you know, they, they feel like they can be much bigger.
1363.40s:  Like what makes me nervous is, you know, three, five, seven, and even some cases 10 or 11 percent.
1369.64s:  What makes me less nervous is when it's, when it's universally, you know, the implied moves over 10
1374.92s:  percent, then I feel much better about earnings. Yeah. I totally can see that. And throughout earnings
1382.60s:  this year, what were the general themes you picked off? Was it about flat, anything, they were tough.
1389.24s:  I would say about flat for the year. Um, we, the worst one we've had recently was probably AVGO
1396.28s:  last week. Um, that was a tough one. That move was insane, you know, from, um,
1404.92s:  whatever it, whatever it came out to be like whatever 50 points or whatever the crazy handle was,
1410.12s:  you know, on that stock, that was, that was an insane move in, in AVGO and Broadcom. Um,
1417.32s:  I, you know, there was nothing you could do. I mean, it was, it was so far outside the expected move,
1425.16s:  then it continued the next day. Today was the first day there was any relief at all. But the AVGO move
1430.28s:  was probably the most surprising move. My position there was relatively small. So it wasn't,
1435.40s:  it wasn't disastrous at all, but it was, it was a little painful. But that was probably,
1439.88s:  that I can remember, you know, the recent moves that, that was probably the worst thing. The expected
1446.04s:  move was like 13 or 15 dollars. The actual move was, you know, all said and done almost 60.
1453.00s:  What do you think of seeing really large cap companies moving like this?
1457.56s:  Well, what, that's a great question because, you know, like, there's a couple takeaways from that.
1463.56s:  First of all, this was a 750, it's a big company. It was a 750 billion dollar company that went to
1469.00s:  like 1.1 trillion. How do you move a fricking steam engine, you know, like a, like a, like a cruise ship,
1476.76s:  you know, around that quickly. How does, how does it, how does a cruise ship pick up a third of its
1483.56s:  value? You know, how does it increase in market cap by 35% in two days? You know, a seven, I can see
1491.24s:  a three billion dollar stock going to four billion. Okay. And going up to 25%. But I can't see a 750
1498.28s:  billion dollar stock going up, you know, to 1.1 trillion in two days. I can just blows my mind,
1504.60s:  just on just on an earnings outlook. So I think there's a couple takeaways from that. One is,
1511.24s:  why do I even need to trade biotechs? Why do I need to trade small cap stocks? Because if you're
1517.88s:  going to get that kind of liquidity and that kind of stock, there's no reason to trade something
1521.64s:  junky. And then, and then the other takeaways, you know, maybe this is a, this is indicative of the
1528.44s:  level of, you know, speculation, complacency, just market greed that's going on right now. And I
1536.60s:  think it's a scary red flag. I purposely asked that question because there's been a few instances
1543.96s:  of moves like this that have stuck out to me in just these really, really large companies using
1548.68s:  AVGO, for an example, obviously this one had, again, not just to find the move, but it did have a
1553.96s:  catalyst. Who do you think saw the outcome of that cat? Like, who's the volume that's buying it at 240?
1563.32s:  I have no idea. I mean, there's obviously, some of it is, some of it is shorts and some of it is,
1573.16s:  you know, different, uh, profferms just trying to get in front of it and race it a little bit.
1581.64s:  I mean, there's, there's a skill. It's almost like being a poker player at some point.
1587.08s:  There are, it's a trillion-dollar stock. So you can't move it around with like, you know,
1592.44s:  your pinky type thing. But there are games that are played in stocks like this where they think that
1599.16s:  there's enough short interest and enough weekends that they can, you know, maybe they,
1606.92s:  maybe they felt there's the potential for a little bit of a gamma squeeze. Maybe they felt that,
1611.32s:  you know, there, there was a certain, um, that it was susceptible to a little bit of short
1617.88s:  covering. I don't really know. But that move at that point, you know, like, who's buying it up there?
1622.68s:  I have no clue. I want to be covering shorts. Yeah. I, I, I'm just curious. Like,
1628.76s:  who's, because I, the similar thought pressed you. Like, how does this grow this much as the
1633.00s:  overall market cap and then people, like, the companies not worth either. It was grossly undervalued.
1639.16s:  Right. Or now it's grossly overvalued, but it doesn't go up 40% in two days. Right.
1644.84s:  So then for this kind of move, if it is shorts, how long do you think it hangs up at a place like
1652.28s:  that before that the, the short participation is essentially flat now and then it starts to turn
1657.40s:  them back to earth. It's hard to say. I mean, it's down like 12 bucks today. So it started to come
1661.72s:  back a little bit to earth today. Um, it depends. It's probably not like just because it rallied
1668.36s:  whatever 60 points. Doesn't mean it's going to go back 30 or anything like that. Maybe it's going to go
1672.60s:  back, you know, 15, 25 points or something like that. And then maybe it's just that's good. You
1677.96s:  know, maybe that was the root. It's got to, it's got to find its level of what it's, you know,
1681.88s:  what the new valuation is because it's clearly going to carry a new valuation. Right. And see what
1686.28s:  happens. You can't get hung up on these trades. You got to, you got to just trade and move on.
1692.92s:  Definitely. For me, it's just fascinating. Like the under the underlying market activity that
1697.80s:  leads to that is very interesting to me. Because yeah, exactly. It's just anomalous. Yeah. If you've
1703.32s:  ever traded it, those kind of stocks, it's, it's very emotional. And sometimes, you know, you can't
1709.32s:  explain it until things slow down. Yeah. When you're looking out over 25. Yeah. What are the
1717.48s:  bigger themes that you're looking to play? Well, I think 25 is going to be a super interesting
1726.84s:  year because I do not think that we are looking at a repeat of 2017. 2017 was a year that we didn't
1734.92s:  even move 1% and the market just took it easy and tried to figure out, you know, what, what was going
1741.48s:  on in this new Trump administration and the market was trying to figure out, you know, wasn't really
1747.16s:  sure how to play it. So it grounded itself higher for the entire year. No 1% moves all year.
1751.96s:  It was incredibly boring and all of a sudden in 2018, you know, the crap at the fan type thing.
1758.12s:  I would think that all of that is going to be accelerated dramatically in 2025.
1766.76s:  There is the biggest risk to the market in my opinion is that
1777.24s:  is it the market, you know, remember, the market generally doesn't do that well under Republican
1781.48s:  presidents. The market generally doesn't generally doesn't do that well after it's had a move like
1787.16s:  it's had this, you know, this year. I mean, we had an insane move the last, the last, basically,
1793.32s:  the last two years. And it would be normal for the market to be a little more jittery next year.
1799.96s:  And plus, I don't need Eric. I don't even know the last time that the consensus has been unanimous.
1808.92s:  Like when you think about it, you know, think about all the years you've been found the market.
1814.36s:  Think about all the times you've heard people talk about things. When have you ever heard a
1819.48s:  unanimous consensus on anything? Normal level lower and draw. They were going higher. Yeah, I mean,
1825.40s:  there is not a single freaking person that thinks that we're not, you know, that doesn't have a
1831.32s:  projection up 10, 15, 20% for next year. And it's universal. It is, it is unanimous. It doesn't
1838.68s:  happen. I mean, it came and get unanimous on a high savings. They can't do deal with savings.
1844.92s:  They can't get unanimous on a high-spin trophy winner or a whole fame player. How is Derek Geter
1850.20s:  not a unanimous choice? Like I'm just saying, you know, like it's insane.
1854.20s:  I, it's funny. One of the things I use as an example of just government is the fact that
1861.24s:  daylight savings is still a thing. And we know that there's a bunch of studies about daylight
1866.20s:  savings like the day after, like increasing car crashes, heart attacks, like from the lack of
1871.64s:  sleep that hour of sleep that's missed. It's incredible. And yet we still like, this is what we should
1876.92s:  do. So do you know why they do it? I was surprised by the reason. I thought it was something to do with
1882.52s:  agriculture and farming. That's what I've heard. Okay, great. But I'd love to know because I don't
1887.80s:  get it. It might have been originally, but that's not why they kept it. So the argument, the argument
1894.28s:  on the house floor was the reason to keep it is that they didn't want kids going to school,
1903.24s:  walking to school in the dark. For all the kids that walked to school. All the kids that go to
1909.40s:  school early in the morning, you know, they didn't want to stay dark till, you know, kids that go
1913.56s:  to school before 730 in the morning, they didn't want to go to school in the dark. Give them a flashlight
1920.20s:  be alright. Yeah, that's the reason I'm not, I would prefer no daylight savings, but that is
1929.96s:  the reason. And that's why it didn't pass. Because now they all just what get to walk home in the dark,
1934.52s:  is that better? Because that's what it gets dark at like three. I guess I don't don't, I don't know
1939.56s:  the answer. So that's all right. Fine. It's good to walk in the dark at one point, but not the
1945.24s:  other. Alright, whatever. Whatever. Well, my answer would be well, how do they, how do they figure
1951.32s:  it out in places where it's always dark? I don't know. Somehow, somehow we were actually, we were
1956.28s:  just looking at maybe going to fair banks to go see the Northern lights until I realized that
1961.72s:  at 2 p.m. in the afternoon, it was negative 27. And then I told Mel, I was just like, yo, I,
1968.20s:  I don't know if you got a jacket big enough because negative 27, one of the suns up, that's cold,
1973.56s:  man. Well, Chicago gets cold, but yeah, yeah, that doesn't, that's a, the Northern lights thing is a
1979.80s:  tough one. Yeah, we saw, we saw when we were in Iceland and it was, it was fine. Like it, it
1986.36s:  wasn't that cold there. That was pretty mellow. But yeah, the, that quickly got axed off the
1991.96s:  list. We're going to go to Calgary now. Go to another cold place. It's just not as cold.
1997.40s:  That's the idea. Negative 27 hurts. Yeah, that's like, I'm not afraid of the cold, but that is like,
2004.36s:  you, you have to be careful because your skin starts to crack. That's next level cold, because I did
2010.20s:  Mount warfare training and my eyebrows would freeze. And then like, if I move my face, I would get
2016.52s:  cracks in my eyebrows. And I just start to bleed. I was just like, yeah, okay, this is, this is a
2021.48s:  little too much. So I had to put like petroleum jelly. Make sure that my eyebrows. Yeah, that's,
2026.36s:  yeah, that's, yeah, that's kind of the, yeah, you don't want to do it. You know, at some point,
2030.44s:  when you're young and you can, you know, you can pull that off and go out without a shirt on,
2035.00s:  sure, no problem. But you know, at this point, ain't worth it. Yeah, it's something you gotta ask
2040.12s:  yourself, like, what, what am I really doing here? We have to get you out of here in a few minutes.
2046.44s:  So I want to pivot and I want to talk about the beginner trader. So we've talked about this,
2052.76s:  we've talked about this a few times. And I know that this is something you spend a lot of time with
2056.12s:  the research that you guys put out and whatnot. So if there was somebody that was going to start
2062.12s:  trading in 2025 for their first year ever, what advice would you give them?
2069.16s:  Well, I mean, I would be excited for them because the one thing that you have to realize when you
2078.52s:  start, because you're never going to pick the ideal time, it's like not possible. I mean,
2083.08s:  because I don't even know when the ideal time is. But what, the way I would approach somebody that's
2088.12s:  just starting out the way I would explain trading and finance them is that for the rest of your life,
2094.04s:  you're going to do this. Like you're never going to stop. One, two, get bitten and you, and you
2099.16s:  start to understand market structure and, you know, markets and finance and strategy and trading
2104.60s:  and all the above, you're going to do it forever. Like it's going to change the way you think,
2110.68s:  it's going to change the way you think about, you know, wealth creation, it's going to change the
2114.36s:  way you think about business, entrepreneurship, every decision you make is going to be, you're
2120.04s:  going to be able to put it and quantify things and put it into mathematical terms. I think that it's
2126.92s:  just, you know, that's how I would explain trading to somebody who's just starting out. I would be like,
2131.08s:  listen, you're going to do this at some point. If you're going to be successful, if you're going to
2136.84s:  acquire wealth, whatever it is, you're going to do this at some point and, or you're going to need
2141.48s:  to know this stuff. And so just start. Doesn't matter. Just start.
2148.36s:  Natural follow-up question is how do I start? Yeah, well, you know, yeah, that is one. And I mean,
2156.52s:  the simple answer is, you know, you have to, you open up a brokerage account with it, hopefully
2164.12s:  with Tasty, but with a good, you know, software platform. And, and you just do something. I don't
2171.40s:  care if you buy one share of stock. So buy or sell one option, you know, do anything by some crypto.
2178.04s:  It doesn't even matter. It doesn't, whatever you do doesn't matter. You're learning new technology,
2183.16s:  new markets, new strategies, new opportunities. And that's, you have to get started by doing something.
2190.04s:  You know, I don't have to, I don't know how else to, I don't know how to sugarcoat it.
2194.84s:  Yeah, well, and I think you hit one of the really important points as far as I'm concerned,
2198.68s:  is that when, because I, I started in 07, which was like a middle time, there was information you
2205.96s:  could find, but not a ton. You obviously started when they were writing it on stone tablets. So
2211.08s:  the information was a little bit different. But for, for people today, they have AI, they have
2217.64s:  stuff. And it almost feels like they deal with information overload. Like I have to research this,
2223.24s:  I have to research this, I have to research this. So you're kind of talking about do something
2227.80s:  that's similar to you, like find something that's small, not a ton of risk. Do something, do something.
2233.96s:  Just do something. Make it, make it actionable and make it practical, but do something. Don't just
2239.08s:  sit there, you know, like people learn by doing better than anything else.
2242.84s:  Completely agree. And for the trader that's starting then over their first year,
2249.00s:  what should they be focusing on? Like what are the things that you think matter most?
2253.32s:  Number of trades. I know that's going to sound like self-serving and weird, but that's not.
2258.92s:  The number of trades purely, this is, this is, this is a numbers game. And in order to get to a number
2266.20s:  that helps you understand something, you've got to just do it. You know, like, like you're,
2272.52s:  you're not going to, there's nothing you can learn by just watching and not participating. And I
2277.64s:  think in the trading world, it's, it's, it may be more true than anywhere else. You have to participate.
2285.32s:  So that would be my. And how do they balance participation with probably small account size,
2292.28s:  limited number of trades that can go on at a given point in time? Yeah, that's exactly just small size,
2297.96s:  you know, it could be one or two or 10 shares to stock. It could be the amount of money you make
2302.76s:  or lose is not really relevant. You know, the option trades could be tiny, a couple pennies,
2307.48s:  you know, a couple dollars, a couple of divine, divine wrist spreads, but nothing that requires a lot
2312.68s:  of capital. And it's just, you know, you've got to get your, you've just got to get your feet wet.
2321.24s:  You got to dip your toe. You got to do whatever it doesn't matter. You know, I mean, everybody
2325.96s:  that does anything starts somewhere. Like it's, it's like, you know, people say, well, I don't
2331.88s:  want to start it. I don't want to do, well, anytime you do anything, you know, the first time you
2335.72s:  pick up, hit a golf ball the first time, you know, you, you, I don't know. Do, do whatever it is,
2340.76s:  you do no matter where you had a first time. Just start it. Just do it. I love it. And a couple
2348.36s:  follow along questions for a different skill category. You have somebody that's been trading for
2352.20s:  years. So getting their feet under them. What are some of the things you think a beginner trader
2359.00s:  does to turn the corner into like an intermediate trader? Like what are the things that they focus
2364.84s:  on think about that kind of stuff? Yeah. So, so that's where it starts to get a little more challenging
2369.72s:  and a little more important. I think the, the, the, the term I like to use is that that beginner
2376.36s:  trader before they, they need to, they need to get to another level because they need to prove
2382.44s:  that everything is repeatable and it's scalable because until they do that, they, you know,
2388.28s:  they don't know what they have. So I call this the, the, the proof of concept stage. You know,
2394.60s:  you have to have a proof of concept. And, um, uh, and so, you know, this is the, this is the
2403.96s:  challenging part where you have to prove, hey, I can do this repeatedly. You know, like, like,
2411.00s:  that's, I'm not a one, I'm not a one hit wonder. I'm not a one trick pony. I can do this repeatedly.
2416.76s:  And I'm proving concept. And how do you think that trader does that in a time frame where the
2425.08s:  market might show them one thing? The market might just show you up. So, the market, unfortunately,
2432.44s:  you know, the market's never going to do exactly what you wanted to do. So I, I don't know the answer
2438.12s:  to that because, you know, that's a tough one. And you're going to have to have opinions and you're
2443.32s:  probably going to be wrong. And so, you know, but, but I don't know the answer. Well, I feel like
2448.52s:  one of the things to plug for you guys is your back testing tool because I, like, I do think that
2453.88s:  can give somebody an idea to test ideas out in a market that they might not see because the,
2459.32s:  yeah, the path dependent nature of a market, I find that to be one of the really tricky things for
2463.48s:  people is when they've been trading three, four years, but the market's been doing one thing. And
2467.16s:  then when it finally turns, they're like all out of the sorts because they just not seen that before.
2471.16s:  So actually, you guys got something cool. I'm worried about that. I'm worried that there's an
2475.08s:  entire generation now. Like, there's literally an entire generation that has never seen a down
2483.00s:  tick. Well, if you, I don't know, I think of it is if somebody started in 2020, any time around,
2489.56s:  there were a lot of people did, they actually got to see quite a lot in a short term timeframe
2493.64s:  because they got to see a pretty sharp contraction. The unbelievable reversal of like a three day
2501.40s:  bear market, which is like untold, but then they also got a bear market in 22, which is kind of
2507.24s:  cool. Market was like, sure, they got a little bit of a bear market in 2022. I'm not sure
2512.28s:  the impact, but yeah, they did. You're right. I forgot about 2022. Yeah, they did.
2516.52s:  Yeah, because I actually, I was thinking about it. And again, like I started in 2007, but I've
2521.08s:  only seen three bear markets and two of them have been in the last four years. So I've been,
2526.60s:  I've been seeing the same pitch non-stop, same thing. Yes, been wild. It's been wild. Yeah. And
2533.08s:  that leads me to the last question. When the market eventually does roll over, always does,
2540.20s:  with valuations where they are, where AVGO grows by 40%. How do you think a potential unwind slash
2550.28s:  correction bear market might look? Nobody knows, but might look. This is the, this is the billion
2556.76s:  dollar question. You know, let's make some money. Tom, let's get this right. I know. We can
2562.68s:  catch you. I spent a lot of time thinking about this because on the one hand, I don't want the
2570.20s:  markets to implode and crash and burn all that kind of stuff because everybody's inherently long.
2576.76s:  It's good for the world. I'm a glass half full person. So I don't want that to happen.
2582.44s:  The other side to it is, I've never felt stronger about the risks, like the Padaw's risk in the market
2594.20s:  right now. Like, what do I think that we could go higher? Sure. There's a chance we could go, I think
2601.64s:  maybe 6,300, let's just say we're 6,100 now, maybe 6,300. I don't, I don't see us going too much
2609.24s:  now, but there's a chance. The flip side of this whole thing, I can see us going down to 5,100
2613.96s:  almost overnight, which means I've got like four to one downside over upside. Easy. Maybe it's
2622.52s:  five to one. And I am a pure Padaw's contrarian. So that's my biggest hurdle that I've got to
2631.80s:  overcome in my head here. I think there's $5 or $4 or $5 of risk for every one dollar upside.
2637.64s:  And when I get my head in that space, it's very difficult to think objectively.
2646.12s:  So that's where I'm challenged with right now. So if that downside realizes,
2651.56s:  what do you think it's a faster move or do you think it's something that?
2655.16s:  Oh, yeah. The downside moves are always faster. There's not even, there's no, there's so many
2660.92s:  red flags right now, which is like there's not even puts you anymore in the indexes. I mean,
2664.92s:  the red flags are like, you know, the skew is 170. There's no, that that's the rating on out,
2673.72s:  you know, the market is so anticipating outlier risk that probably won't happen. But the skew
2679.00s:  numbers are off the charts. There is no put skew, which happens about 10 or 12% of the time,
2684.60s:  which is insane. And there's, you know, and there is this unanimous bullishness among everybody.
2692.76s:  Like it's not, it's not, are we going higher? It's how high?
2698.28s:  And we might not. I don't know. I mean, the downside scares me. And I don't think any,
2705.48s:  the other problem is I don't think anybody's short. Usually like I think shorts are there,
2708.92s:  they could pick up and cover some stuff. Man, I don't see it.
2713.24s:  Well, on that rosy note, it's time to get you out of here. You got to run into some traffic,
2717.64s:  but always great to connect with you for people that want to find you obviously tasty live.
2722.28s:  I'll throw all the links in the notes below, but anything else you want to leave people with any

2740.28s:  I mean, I'm a junkie and I love it. So like I'm not doing it because I have to. I do it because I love it.
2747.72s:  But I'm not going back on the road until May. So yeah, so I've got a couple of months off now
2755.24s:  because I've been on the road for half of this year. Are you going to go stir crazy? No, no.
2762.28s:  Okay, you'll be all right. Yeah, I need to be all right. My daughter's having a baby,
2766.04s:  my son's getting married. I got a lot of stuff going on. You got tons of stuff anyways. Good. Yeah,
2769.72s:  well, I'm stoked to hear the families doing well and keeping you busy. That's the way it should be.
2774.04s:  We got to keep you running around because you're doing a lot of good out there. So thanks for hanging out Tom.
2779.24s:  All right. Love it. Thanks, Eric.
