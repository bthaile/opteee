0.00s: Risk management for traders, it's not what you think.
2.88s: The vast majority of people really don't understand what this means or what it looks like.
8.32s: So we're going to do two things. The first thing is I'm going to show you real examples of what
13.52s: retail traders think about when it comes to risk management. And then the second thing is I'm
18.40s: going to walk you through exactly how I manage risk in an active trading portfolio. I've been doing
24.72s: this since 2007. So let's take a quick look and baseline on what the Godfather himself says about
33.92s: risk. The first rule of an investment is don't lose. And the second rule of an investment is don't
38.16s: forget the first rule. And that's all the rules there are. Well, there it is. Couldn't say it
42.00s: better myself. And if you couldn't hear it because it's kind of an old video, essentially he's
46.16s: ingest saying the first rule is don't lose. And the second rule is don't forget rule of number one,
51.04s: which is don't lose. Why is that the case? Why does that matter so much? Well, let's take a look.
54.96s: This is a projection for compound growth. And I'll get my head out of the way in a second. But I
60.56s: want to show you something. We have this first portfolio on the left hand side. We're looking at
64.88s: $100,000 in total. And it has all positive years. Although one year it went 10% 10% 2% 10% 5%. So
73.60s: overall, we had a pretty slow year. Let's compare that to portfolio three, which is right underneath my
78.48s: head here. We have 30%. So this return is three times the highest return that portfolio one saw.
85.44s: Then we had a 25% drawdown than 12, 14, 12%. All of the returns here except for that one single
92.56s: negative return is higher than what we saw in portfolio one yet portfolio one walked away with more
98.24s: money 142,000 550 compared to 139. You might be saying, oh, that's pretty close. It is. But if you
104.16s: take a look at the impact of this drawdown and what this has on our compounding returns long term,
112.56s: this is catastrophic. You have a portfolio that absolutely has crushed the first portfolio yet
118.96s: it walks out ahead. Look at the average return 8.6% compared to 7.4%. 1.2% higher in portfolio three
127.12s: is the average return, including this giant negative year. However, the compound annual growth rate
131.84s: lacks quite a bit. This is why you should care about risk and this is why you need to completely
138.80s: change the way you think about risk because it's not something that we just figure out while we're
143.68s: in the trade and hope it works out because let's take a look at how that goes. This is from Wall Street
150.48s: Betts and it's using that joke. I'm never going to financially recover from this, right? But this
156.40s: portfolio is down 91.6% or for this specific trade. Okay, you might be saying, yeah,
162.96s: Wall Street Betts, we expect that from the degenerates. You're not wrong. Well, let's take a look at
168.16s: day trading. This is another scenario, really bad trade. Long story short, this person took a stop
173.20s: and then it ran up away from them and you could tell this was a whole emotional cycle because the
177.52s: last part I highlight here, how do you guys deal with such things? Do you recommend I take a break
182.64s: for a few days? Again, that's all fueled by emotion and you might be saying, okay, well, that's
187.12s: day trading. Obviously, day trading is a perilous sport. Still degenerates. You're not wrong.
193.20s: Maybe we look at investing. Should I jump or not? When I first saw this, I thought it was a suicide
197.52s: thing, but it's not actually what it says. Let me slide this down just a little bit so you could
201.92s: see easier. What this actually says is I'm 64 and freaking out over having 60% of my funds in a
209.12s: money market right now in the market is rising. I won't need 30% that it is a the point being
214.08s: completely emotionally fueled process here. And this is pretty reasonable. Let's take it another
219.76s: step further. Here we have dividend investing. What most traders would consider to be the pretty
225.60s: mellow group, the ones that are looking for a little bit of money. And this guy's saying solid
230.32s: value and dividend play for Verizon. This is what the fucking chart looks like for Verizon.
235.68s: Where's the value? This person is contorted because of the yield that they see in Verizon and they
243.12s: see dollar signs. So what I'm hoping you're picking up in these different examples is it's not
248.32s: really as much as we like to joke about it. It's not just the degenerates that have a problem here.
253.68s: It's most people. Let's talk about what this looks like. The very first concept I want to cover here
259.20s: is why risk? Why do we care about this? And it's exactly what Warren Buffett said. If you don't have
264.08s: any principle to invest, there's nothing to do. You don't belong in this conversation. So risk
269.60s: managing risk is what makes sure you have investable income so that you could do something so that you
275.92s: can invest. I can't invest zero dollars. The way you stop from going to zero dollars is through
280.80s: managing risk. But what I just showed you there are some of the psychological effects that people have
287.76s: when we talk about things like risk for traders, stuff like the disposition effect, which is when
293.84s: we have a propensity to look at winning potential and losing potential differently. And what I mean by
301.04s: that is we have the tendency to sell winners way too fast. And we hold losers way too long because
309.68s: we like ealing like we're winning. It strokes our egos. But we don't like feeling like we lost or
316.40s: that we're wrong. It hurts our egos. So we don't want to have these losing positions. And then you
321.84s: couple this with loss aversion. And this essentially means that we are more sensitive to losing things
327.92s: than gaining by a factor of about two. I encourage you to read both of these studies. But the whole idea
333.44s: of loss aversion, and this is a biological in context, loss aversion exists because biologically,
340.32s: if you have enough to survive, if you lose something off of that, that could mean you die. Whereas
346.88s: if you have enough to survive and you could gain a little bit, maybe live slightly more comfortably,
352.72s: but if you lose it, you die. You don't really care about gaining whatever it is as much. So both
357.84s: of these run rampant. And this doesn't go into everything else like ego and stuff like that. But
363.04s: those are important notes nonetheless. However, I want to talk to you about how I think about risk
369.92s: and then how I actually deploy risk management efficiently. So in this case, we have a question that
375.44s: we have to solve for by ourselves. Our goals versus the risk we want to take. If your goal is to make
382.08s: 100% on your account by the end of the year, double your goal or double your account to pretty
387.84s: fucking aggressive goal. Does that mean that you can't have that as a goal? Now you can have it.
392.00s: But what does that mean in terms of the risk you are going to have to take in order to even stand
396.96s: a shot at that goal? Massive. So based on the way you think about your goals, your risk is going
403.84s: to have to correspond to it one way or the other. So for me personally, when I was aggressively
408.48s: growing my account, I looked at 15% per year as my goal. I broke that down to monthly targets to
415.68s: give me a little bit of context on how much risk I should be taking on a monthly basis in order
420.96s: to hit those targets. So the idea is 15% per year. For me, it was doable and it didn't force me to
429.12s: take so much risk that I wouldn't be able to significantly scale this. And my compound annual growth
434.16s: rate has maintained pretty far above that at least by 5%, but nonetheless, that was my goal.
439.12s: And the reason why I picked that goal is to really control the rest of all these psychological
444.00s: functions that we have. So now let's get into what my approach actually looks like. First, we need to
450.16s: understand the idea of expected return. And then we need to overlay that with the idea of tails,
456.88s: because here's the deal. Every single time you're in a trade and you start messing with your
463.68s: win rates or your loss rates, the average wins and losses are going to change. Same thing if you
469.92s: mess with the average loss size. And I'll get into an example in a second. And if you need kind of
474.40s: more details on what this all looks like, I have a video, I'll link to it in the notes below. But
479.36s: if we decide that we want to have lower average loss sizes, we want to reduce the size of our
486.24s: average loss, it means we're going to have more losses because you are managing that risk. You
492.56s: obviously are going to pass that same threshold on your way to whatever your max losses. However,
498.32s: my entire approach to managing risk is to maximize this relationship. And what that means is the
506.00s: following. We can take a look at a data set, something like this, whatever you want. This is
510.08s: just data from Yahoo Finance. And I get an idea of how something moves. What you're going to look at
516.40s: is going to vary drastically by your strategy. But I'm giving you an example of how we could use
521.28s: data to make choices that make sense. So we could say, what are the number of occurrences where over
526.72s: the course of a weekend, we move x percentage. And what does that mean for whatever the strategy is
532.56s: that we're running? What I'm trying to do is look for the outliers. I want to find the instances
538.96s: where we have either big moves or little moves. And I want to use that to inform how I treat
545.84s: stops. So stops can be problematic. If you integrate stop losses in any sort of trading strategy,
553.20s: you are going to increase your loss frequency. Your average loss may go down because our stop is
560.72s: decreasing how big our loss can get to. But we're going to have more of them. So we don't want to do
565.28s: that because if you modulate your loss rate and your loss size too much such that it starts to
572.56s: overwhelm your winning side of the equation, now you are managing risk fine, but you're running a
579.44s: negatively expected strategy. We don't want that. So to find what works is pretty simple. What you
585.28s: need to do is take a look at your strategy. A great example is my earnings strategies. I like to look
591.12s: at at least the past eight quarters, if not 10 to 12, depending on the time frame of the product
596.72s: that I'm looking at. And I want to see how it moves in general. Then I find trading a short
601.76s: straddle for this earnings plate to capture that variance risk premium, which if you're not sure
606.56s: what that is, there's a link in the notes below. As I do that, I know that I have break even points.
613.12s: My short straddle gives me room to the upside and the downside. But if it moves too much, I lose money.
618.32s: I don't want to have a stop where if it moves enough to hit my stop, but then it comes back
623.84s: in profitable, well, now that's just hurting the profit side of my equation, I don't want that.
629.36s: So what I need to do is I need to look at the strategy and say, okay, if it moves 10% up looking
636.48s: at a specific product, what is the frequency that it moves 10% up, but then would fall back into my
642.56s: profit zone? And if it's a really low percentage, like 2% of the time, I now just found the tail.
650.40s: So if I set up a stop for that strategy in that specific product that cuts off the tail,
657.84s: it will help improve my average loss, meaning decrease it without impacting my loss rate too much.
665.60s: It will still impact it slightly, but not too much. This is exactly the way we need to think about
671.36s: managing risk. It's not just a path hazard approach. We need to be thoughtful about what we're
677.36s: picking and how it impacts our expected return. So what I like to do is this down here. I like to use
684.48s: two different bands for most positions. And then I break down risk into portfolio and individual
692.88s: positions. So first, let's take a quick look at this band concept. I have a position on an apple,
698.00s: and you can see what this band concept actually looks like. Up here is my first band, and then down
704.16s: here is my second band. I'm bullish. So what this means is I actually have to move this first band
709.04s: up to 177.61. So this is a prime time example. I'm going to remove this one, and I'm going to slide
715.20s: this alert up to 166. And this or 176, this is just to manage profits. And this is, well, 166.50.
722.88s: Sorry, we got to screw it up even more because it's making good money. Making good money.
727.20s: So I'll actually move it up to 177. And then this is exactly how it works. So this first band
734.56s: is when I take a hard look at the position. And I say, is this still working the way that I want
740.80s: it to work in this case? It's yes. And let's say Apple hit this first band. I would make a choice.
745.84s: I would say, do I want to get out here? Yes or no? And if it's no, I need a really good reason
752.48s: to stay in. Then I have my second band, which I also need to move up now to here. And this second
758.00s: band is essentially if it hits this, I'm done. I'm out no matter what. What this does is protects
764.88s: the verity. It makes sure that I am mentally overriding this entire concept of the disposition
773.52s: effect in loss of version. I'm not allowing these losing trades to expand because I don't like to
779.68s: look at them. I'm not allowing winning trades to get cut too short because I know where my loss
784.96s: is going to be managed. So in this case, specifically with Apple, I don't have to take the trade down
790.72s: to say, Oh, I want to lock in this profit. I'm scared that it's going to lose. I don't care. I'll let
795.44s: the profits run because I have a loss plan for the downside to make sure that I don't allow this
802.00s: winning trade to turn into a losing trade. This allows me to let winners run, but make sure that I'm
806.08s: managing the losses at a point where it makes sense based on the individual strategy and the
810.72s: expectancy for that strategy. So to kind of round this idea out, I'm going to give you some of the
815.60s: things that I like to look at for both the portfolio and then individual trades. So for the portfolio,
820.72s: I like to look at these kinds of metrics. I'm going to look at beta weighted delta. This
825.04s: essentially takes all of the different delta's of your portfolio and it puts them into a single
828.88s: language, so to speak, into a single ticker so that you know what your exposure is in terms of size
834.16s: across all your different positions. And then you also know how it's going to behave. I typically like
838.00s: to beta weight either against the spy or the SPX. And it lets me know like if I have 1000 positive
845.04s: beta weighted delta's into the SPX, then I know all of my positions are essentially behaving like
850.48s: long 1000 shares of SPX. So by doing this, it gives me a lot of fidelity over the risk profile and how
856.16s: I feel about it. And then I'm also going to look at the gamma theta Vega for the entire portfolio.
860.88s: All of this kind of gives me an idea of sizing and correlation. That's why I like beta weighted
865.28s: delta so much, but it's not just the correlation of the individual directional risk of each strategy,
872.24s: but also theta also Vega, how fast is my portfolio set to move? These will give me some of those
877.84s: details. Then for the portfolio, we already talked about this kind of this goal. That's the return
883.12s: target for my entire portfolio. So I keep that in mind on an annual and a monthly basis. And I make
889.20s: sure that the risk that I have out at any given point in time serves that broader purpose. Then
893.92s: I'm always going to make sure that there are if there are any events coming up, I'm aware of it,
897.92s: depending on how much risk I have out in the portfolio, but things like FOMC rate statements.
902.32s: That's kind of a big deal right now. So in those instances, I want to make sure I know it's coming
906.40s: up for the week so that I can adjust the portfolio as needed. And then PNL bands. I set PNL bands
912.16s: for the portfolio. Now a really important note, let's say if I want to make $100 in a month in my
917.68s: portfolio and I make that $100. That does not mean I stop. That does not mean I stop. It just means
924.32s: I get more selective. There are no real time frames when it comes to the market. The market doesn't
929.92s: really know if it's Tuesday or Wednesday. The point being is if you're making money and things are
934.24s: working, why would you stop just because you hit a number this month? What happens next month when
939.68s: it's a slow month? This is how in aggregate, I'm able to come out ahead is I set these PNL bands
946.48s: to guide me, but they absolutely do not specifically the profit bands. It doesn't mean I stop.
952.40s: And then the loss bands, this is just in case I'm asleep at the wheel and then I'm not doing a good
957.44s: job managing the risk in individual positions so that I don't allow my entire portfolio to start
963.52s: losing way too much because again, if you'll recall, the impact of these compounding returns is
970.80s: massive if we have a big drawdown to big impact. We don't want to see that. So that's kind of how I
976.32s: set up for the portfolio and you have to figure out what's right for you. If your goal is to make
980.00s: 100% over the course of a year, you better believe that you better be ready for some big portfolio
984.96s: movements to get there, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it makes sense and you have to figure out
989.36s: what suits your goals and what risk you're comfortable with. Now for individual positions,
993.68s: I care about the expectancy of the individual strategies, as I mentioned, this helps inform
999.12s: how I'm going to allocate to the position. This stops me from automatically adding to losing trades,
1005.76s: which is really common for people. So I'm going to allocate things out via an initial allocation
1010.56s: and then I have subsequent scaling targets. So for something like this, I have a video that talks
1015.12s: about portfolio management. I'll also link to that in the notes below so you can see more about it.
1019.44s: Every single position is going to have those PNL targets, profit and loss for the loss size or
1024.88s: loss side. I'm going to use those bands. I'm going to have two bands. Sometimes it's based on
1029.20s: support and resistance. Sometimes it's based on the value of an option. It really comes down to the
1034.16s: individual strategies. So you have to see what makes sense for your strategy. And then again,
1037.60s: I'm always, always, always going to pay attention to events. What events are coming up for that
1042.56s: individual position because those can have a really big impact on the overall profitability.
1047.92s: So if you made it to the end, like, subscribe, be an outlier and comment down below what you learned
1052.96s: if anything new. I'll catch you guys later.
