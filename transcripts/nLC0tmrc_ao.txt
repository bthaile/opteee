 Green, 16, at a 17 months in a row selling options. Let's talk about it. First, let's take a look at this post, and then I want to discuss some of the issues that I see here. This says, the totals in the all chart look weird because I'd pull a huge amount for taxes. For anybody who would be curious, I run a synthetic strategy that blends credit spreads in various variations of butterfly, broken wing butterflies. I don't really know what the synthetic component is there, but anyways, either on earnings reports or just on spy slash SPX. Before I focused solely on high-volve earnings, but I've taken much less risk as my portfolio is increasing still found a lot of profit. Just sharing, because it's hard to share with people in real life, don't really want to go too far in depth on the strategies I'm running, but slower and safer is better. Having patients to know when to cut profit slash loss is important, especially in this market. Let's take a look at the other photo here. This is the all chart. We can see that this one shows up 532,975, 2124%. You can see the dip that they talked about pulling a bunch out, and then clearly they added almost the same amount back in because of this V. The other thing, clearly like money has come into and out of this account in terms of just transfers. If we take a look at this, it shows us that the account here is up 8.32% since 2004. First, let's just talk about this idea, because it is really, really common for traders, especially on the sell side, to really wrap their arms around high wind rates. The fact that it says green 16 out of 17 months in a row selling options. Well, it's obviously not in a row if this is breaking that. But this is like just a mental thing, right? Like we want to be able to say that we're always winning and to be clear who literally who wouldn't. So we can see that they do have some actual equity holdings, which is smart. But let's just take a look at a comparison for a reference. If we plot going back to the beginning of January of 2024, and we go to today, which is 16 June, this post is from 18 days ago. So this post would have been a little bit lower in here. But if we take a look at what spy or S&P 500 is done over this time frame, we can see it's just overwhelmingly up, right? Massively up. Okay, fine. So they're up again based on their portfolio 8%, 8.32%. Okay, fine, that's completely fine. There's nothing wrong with that. However, if we take a look at what the market did over this time frame, just plotting from again, the beginning of the range to where we sit today. And I look at this, it's up 27.8. I'm sorry, 27.67%. So what's the problem here? Well, the problem here is the market is up almost 30% and their portfolio is up 8. Yet in their mind, this is like a massive win. And again, this is not to say that this isn't a massive win for them. It very well might be. But this is the disease of people who are really too wrapped up in win rate and selling to get a high win rate that we sometimes lose the forest for the trees. So if they're trying to trade some sort of income generation thing or whatever, that's fine. Again, not a completely developed account in order to be able to make a lot that way sustainably again, it's up 8% essentially in a year and a half. So I doubt that that's the case. My guess is this is somebody who just likes trading. They believe that selling is giving them some sort of edge and it's leading to a lot of green months. But again, the problem is, is this becomes seductive? Losing lots and lots of green months or green days or green trades in general feels good. But it's lollying you into a really, really, really false sense of security and I want to show you how. So if we plot their performance and I'm just using $500,000 over a 10 year timeframe looking at an 8.3% return, which again is completely fine. That's solid. That leads us to 1.1 million over 10 years. Again, that's completely respectable. Now if we take a look at what's actually going on here, this is their return, which is the 8.32%. If we look at this compared to the S&P 500, just via spy. And in this case, all I'm doing is using the end balance taking out the 8.32% to give me a starting balance for them. And then I'm using the same starting balance here. I had to update the numbers. So if we have our beginning balance of around $500 and 88K, they ended up with $6.37 in this case using their 8% return. I'll switch these so it's easier to tell. And if we start with this 588 and we get the S&P 500 return over those 17 months, that gives us 751,000. That's a variance of 163,000. Call it over 18 months. And the return variance there is 19.3%, which is pretty significant. Now if we plot this out now and we include that, what I'm going to do is not compare it against the variance rate, although we can do that to start just for an example. So if we look at this 19% variance rate over the same duration, they instead of 1.1 million, they would have 2.8 million. But let's just say that the market doesn't actually return that and the market, you know, on average is somewhere around 12%. But if you look in, that's in a more recent window and even more recent window, it's even higher than that still. It can be 13, 14%. Really just depends on what range you use. So if we plot this at, let's call it that 12%, that long term, and that's a longer term, high end markets range, but still leaning a little more towards the last 20 years. In this context, your return variance here goes from 1.1, which is their return to 1.5. So it's essentially half a million dollars that are wrapped up in the difference between these, not to mention the tax differences and all that kind of stuff from being able to exhibit just buy and hold. So to summarize all that, there's nothing wrong with this. This is a completely fine return, no issue. The problem here is if this person is doing this and thinking that this is some sort of like great performance or the performance that they're really looking for, unless their performance is based on a very specific series of conditions, being things like maybe they prioritize really consistent returns, but I honestly don't see that with this kind of variance or really reducing the negative months simply because they don't like negative months. That's okay. Then this is smashing it. The problem though is with these kinds of strategies, more often than not only is it more tax efficient to just buy and hold, but you typically make more money. So the takeaway here is if you decide to trade options, do your best to avoid getting sucked into one of these two polar camps of buying options that are like zero DTE going to expire or selling options. In my opinion, you are far better served blending things and doing things as they make sense. Sometimes it will make sense to buy. Sometimes it will make sense to sell, but in this case, this person is giving up a ton of potential money and it seems simply because they like selling and they like this return profile. And again, if they accept that trade off, okay, but I can tell you in my own shoes and I imagine most other people's shoes, I would not take that trade off. I would rather have the better return that's more efficient. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
