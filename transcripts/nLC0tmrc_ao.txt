0.00s: Green, 16, at a 17 months in a row selling options.
6.00s: Let's talk about it.
8.00s: First, let's take a look at this post, and then I want to discuss some of the issues that
14.40s: I see here.
15.80s: This says, the totals in the all chart look weird because I'd pull a huge amount for taxes.
22.00s: For anybody who would be curious, I run a synthetic strategy that blends credit spreads
27.44s: in various variations of butterfly, broken wing butterflies.
31.12s: I don't really know what the synthetic component is there, but anyways, either on earnings
36.76s: reports or just on spy slash SPX.
41.08s: Before I focused solely on high-volve earnings, but I've taken much less risk as my portfolio
46.52s: is increasing still found a lot of profit.
49.12s: Just sharing, because it's hard to share with people in real life, don't really want
52.16s: to go too far in depth on the strategies I'm running, but slower and safer is better.
57.40s: Having patients to know when to cut profit slash loss is important, especially in this
62.12s: market.
63.12s: Let's take a look at the other photo here.
66.08s: This is the all chart.
69.12s: We can see that this one shows up 532,975, 2124%.
77.12s: You can see the dip that they talked about pulling a bunch out, and then clearly they added
80.88s: almost the same amount back in because of this V.
85.28s: The other thing, clearly like money has come into and out of this account in terms of
90.72s: just transfers.
92.80s: If we take a look at this, it shows us that the account here is up 8.32% since 2004.
102.64s: First, let's just talk about this idea, because it is really, really common for traders,
109.64s: especially on the sell side, to really wrap their arms around high wind rates.
117.72s: The fact that it says green 16 out of 17 months in a row selling options.
123.00s: Well, it's obviously not in a row if this is breaking that.
128.20s: But this is like just a mental thing, right?
130.28s: Like we want to be able to say that we're always winning and to be clear who literally
136.40s: who wouldn't.
138.08s: So we can see that they do have some actual equity holdings, which is smart.
143.84s: But let's just take a look at a comparison for a reference.
151.36s: If we plot going back to the beginning of January of 2024, and we go to today, which is
158.92s: 16 June, this post is from 18 days ago.
162.76s: So this post would have been a little bit lower in here.
168.04s: But if we take a look at what spy or S&P 500 is done over this time frame, we can see
172.52s: it's just overwhelmingly up, right?
175.56s: Massively up.
176.56s: Okay, fine.
178.16s: So they're up again based on their portfolio 8%, 8.32%.
183.88s: Okay, fine, that's completely fine.
186.64s: There's nothing wrong with that.
188.40s: However, if we take a look at what the market did over this time frame, just plotting from
194.20s: again, the beginning of the range to where we sit today.
197.56s: And I look at this, it's up 27.8.
201.04s: I'm sorry, 27.67%.
204.96s: So what's the problem here?
206.48s: Well, the problem here is the market is up almost 30% and their portfolio is up 8.
212.32s: Yet in their mind, this is like a massive win.
217.72s: And again, this is not to say that this isn't a massive win for them.
221.32s: It very well might be.
223.64s: But this is the disease of people who are really too wrapped up in win rate and selling
232.00s: to get a high win rate that we sometimes lose the forest for the trees.
238.72s: So if they're trying to trade some sort of income generation thing or whatever, that's
244.36s: fine.
245.36s: Again, not a completely developed account in order to be able to make a lot that way
249.52s: sustainably again, it's up 8% essentially in a year and a half.
254.68s: So I doubt that that's the case.
257.04s: My guess is this is somebody who just likes trading.
260.72s: They believe that selling is giving them some sort of edge and it's leading to a lot of
266.88s: green months.
267.88s: But again, the problem is, is this becomes seductive?
272.12s: Losing lots and lots of green months or green days or green trades in general feels good.
278.56s: But it's lollying you into a really, really, really false sense of security and I want
284.80s: to show you how.
286.60s: So if we plot their performance and I'm just using $500,000 over a 10 year timeframe
292.24s: looking at an 8.3% return, which again is completely fine.
296.92s: That's solid.
298.24s: That leads us to 1.1 million over 10 years.
302.36s: Again, that's completely respectable.
305.40s: Now if we take a look at what's actually going on here, this is their return, which is
311.04s: the 8.32%.
313.52s: If we look at this compared to the S&P 500, just via spy.
318.92s: And in this case, all I'm doing is using the end balance taking out the 8.32% to give
325.12s: me a starting balance for them.
327.68s: And then I'm using the same starting balance here.
332.00s: I had to update the numbers.
334.36s: So if we have our beginning balance of around $500 and 88K, they ended up with $6.37 in
346.72s: this case using their 8% return.
350.28s: I'll switch these so it's easier to tell.
353.80s: And if we start with this 588 and we get the S&P 500 return over those 17 months, that
360.76s: gives us 751,000.
363.40s: That's a variance of 163,000.
367.64s: Call it over 18 months.
370.72s: And the return variance there is 19.3%, which is pretty significant.
374.64s: Now if we plot this out now and we include that, what I'm going to do is not compare it
381.16s: against the variance rate, although we can do that to start just for an example.
385.64s: So if we look at this 19% variance rate over the same duration, they instead of 1.1 million,
392.80s: they would have 2.8 million.
396.16s: But let's just say that the market doesn't actually return that and the market, you know,
401.04s: on average is somewhere around 12%.
404.08s: But if you look in, that's in a more recent window and even more recent window, it's
408.92s: even higher than that still.
410.28s: It can be 13, 14%.
412.76s: Really just depends on what range you use.
414.92s: So if we plot this at, let's call it that 12%, that long term, and that's a longer term,
420.48s: high end markets range, but still leaning a little more towards the last 20 years.
428.24s: In this context, your return variance here goes from 1.1, which is their return to 1.5.
436.40s: So it's essentially half a million dollars that are wrapped up in the difference between
442.24s: these, not to mention the tax differences and all that kind of stuff from being able to
447.40s: exhibit just buy and hold.
449.44s: So to summarize all that, there's nothing wrong with this.
453.08s: This is a completely fine return, no issue.
456.20s: The problem here is if this person is doing this and thinking that this is some sort of
461.92s: like great performance or the performance that they're really looking for, unless their
467.28s: performance is based on a very specific series of conditions, being things like maybe they
472.92s: prioritize really consistent returns, but I honestly don't see that with this kind of
477.92s: variance or really reducing the negative months simply because they don't like negative
483.60s: months.
484.60s: That's okay.
485.60s: Then this is smashing it.
487.60s: The problem though is with these kinds of strategies, more often than not only is it more
492.66s: tax efficient to just buy and hold, but you typically make more money.
496.76s: So the takeaway here is if you decide to trade options, do your best to avoid getting sucked
504.88s: into one of these two polar camps of buying options that are like zero DTE going to expire
512.32s: or selling options.
514.60s: In my opinion, you are far better served blending things and doing things as they make sense.
521.52s: Sometimes it will make sense to buy.
523.24s: Sometimes it will make sense to sell, but in this case, this person is giving up a ton
529.36s: of potential money and it seems simply because they like selling and they like this return
535.16s: profile.
536.16s: And again, if they accept that trade off, okay, but I can tell you in my own shoes and
540.76s: I imagine most other people's shoes, I would not take that trade off.
544.36s: I would rather have the better return that's more efficient.
547.16s: Be an outlier.
548.16s: See you guys later.
