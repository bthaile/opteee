0.48s: I'm going to show you five strategies
2.34s: that I use to trade all market
4.38s: conditions that's the beautiful aspect
6.48s: of options is our ability to form fit
9.48s: them to the current markets like right
10.92s: now it's 2022 it's a bear market we've
13.62s: had a down year however I'm up on the
15.96s: year and it's not because I'm a magician
17.76s: it's simply because I have different
19.62s: tools that I can apply to different
21.54s: scenarios I'm not stuck just doing one
23.94s: or two things hoping that the market
25.74s: lines up with those what's up everybody
27.54s: Eric here welcome back to all the
29.10s: outliers let's talk about some
30.42s: strategies so first I'm gonna get my
32.22s: stupid face out the way and we're going
33.96s: to talk about the first one which is
35.34s: probably not surprising to anybody here
37.56s: the covered ratio strangle you're going
39.84s: to see this term ratio multiple times
42.06s: throughout this and it's because I
44.94s: purposely use ratios to create different
47.40s: risk to reward profiles and this is what
50.28s: I'm talking about
51.48s: so the first trade we have here is a
54.18s: short put and this is the payoff it's a
57.42s: Max profit of the credit received so
59.88s: that's why it has a capped Max profit
61.80s: and technically unlimited downside now
64.08s: one note on these short puts that I want
66.42s: to make sure it's abundantly clear is I
68.94s: purposely put short puts not cash
71.88s: secured puts and the reason why I don't
74.28s: put cash secured puts here is because
76.20s: some people think that if it's a cash
78.54s: secured put then we're parking the cash
81.66s: that we're going to use for that trade
83.94s: if we get assigned and just waiting to
86.34s: see whether or not that happens that is
88.62s: not at all what I used to do at this
91.26s: point I generally do that because I have
92.82s: enough room in the portfolio but when I
94.80s: was aggressively growing my account
96.12s: trading things like this the money that
98.46s: I would earmark to take assignment if I
101.88s: if the option expired in the money and I
103.92s: received the stock in that scenario I
106.98s: would typically have that money out
108.72s: doing something else whether it's a box
110.64s: spread whether whether it's being tied
112.62s: up in another trade and to cover early
115.50s: assignment if it happened I would rely
118.20s: on margin for the account pay the
120.42s: interest on the margin until I could
121.68s: free up the capital to bring over to
123.00s: this that I originally had earmarked so
125.52s: to summarize that when I was
127.92s: aggressively growing the account my
129.78s: short puts were not sitting there cash
131.40s: secured I would use the money elsewhere
133.14s: I would have the money earmarked to use
136.20s: in this trade when I need it but I
139.38s: typically would expect and plan to free
142.20s: up that money towards expiration so that
145.20s: did leave me early expiration risk and I
147.60s: needed to make sure I had enough room in
148.74s: the portfolio to at least be able to
150.00s: take on the shares via margin now let's
152.82s: talk about that scenario there's two
154.20s: outcomes with this short put the first
156.12s: one it expires out of the money and you
157.86s: just do it again or if it expires in the
160.44s: money and we take assignment that leads
161.94s: to this scenario and that's what this
164.22s: looks like down here we have now long
167.22s: stock because we would have bought it at
169.44s: whatever the strike price was keeping
171.42s: the credit and then I sell calls against
174.30s: it just like a covered call and then
176.28s: additional short puts so in this
179.04s: scenario sometimes the short puts go on
180.90s: right away sometimes they get layered on
182.64s: later it all depends on the underlying
184.38s: but the main thing I'm trying to avoid
186.36s: is this so in this scenario I'm
188.94s: pretending that I have 200 shares of
191.22s: long stock and this short put
193.92s: on top of that we have this one short
196.50s: call so I have one short call here 200
199.92s: long shares over here and that's why we
202.74s: do not have a capped upside whereas if
205.62s: we look over here this is using 200 or
209.34s: 100 shares but the same amount of short
212.64s: calls so if this is 200 long shares of
215.10s: stock even with that additional put
217.44s: this is 200 or two short calls against
219.84s: it and sooner or later you're going to
221.64s: cap out your max profit I don't want to
224.04s: do that so that's exactly why I trade
226.68s: these as I do without capping the profit
230.10s: potential so these live within my core
232.50s: allocation meaning this is really how I
235.44s: make a lot of my money over time they're
237.78s: bullish in their nature I want the
239.88s: underlying to go up through all stages
241.92s: of trading this and I put volatility in
245.28s: different the reason why I put
247.08s: volatility in different is because when
249.90s: we're selling short puts if we have
251.64s: higher volatility it's a good thing
253.26s: because you're going to collect a little
254.46s: bit more money but it also means that
256.14s: you're going to have higher variance in
259.20s: the underlyings movements which means
261.90s: even though you're getting paid more
262.92s: you're probably going to have to adjust
264.30s: the trade more frequently as compared to
266.94s: low volatility environment so it's a
269.40s: trade-off that's why I don't say this is
271.50s: better for high ivp environments I get
274.50s: paid a little bit more but there's a
276.06s: diminishing return so I prefer implied
279.78s: volatility percentile to be maybe 30 to
282.54s: 40 percent something like that and as
285.18s: soon as it starts getting over that I'm
286.56s: gonna make more money but I'm gonna have
289.08s: to deal with the trade more so it's a
290.82s: bit of a delicate balance and I will
293.94s: trade this strategy even if implied
295.80s: volatility is low it's not better for
298.20s: the strategy it's not the ideal scenario
300.12s: but because it is a core allocation and
302.58s: because there's a period of time where
303.78s: you have long stock which doesn't really
305.04s: care about volatility that is why I
307.38s: label this implied volatility
308.94s: indifferent all right let's get on to
310.98s: the next one here so we have ratio
313.32s: diagonals again that same ratio thing
315.36s: that we're talking about
316.98s: and this works for
320.40s: um calls or puts and this is how I can
324.18s: easily directionally trade Bull and Bear
326.88s: markets so in this scenario if we have a
329.34s: trending bull market using the call
332.34s: diagonal gives us upside potential and
335.52s: it again this ratio is so important
338.18s: because the ratio unlocks unlimited
342.36s: profit potential whereas if we look at
344.28s: this version with a regular diagonal
346.80s: sooner or later you find yourself in
349.44s: this scenario where you actually can
351.12s: start losing money even though your
352.92s: direction that you selected is correct
354.96s: you can still start losing money so this
358.32s: is exactly why I prefer to trade them at
361.14s: a ratio and again to set up this long
364.32s: call diagonal typically ratio diagonal
367.86s: typically I'm going to go further out in
369.54s: time for the long call like maybe at
372.60s: least 180 days plus and I'm going to go
374.82s: deep in the money and then I'm going to
377.16s: sell short calls against it shorter term
380.16s: and it's the same thing for the put side
381.96s: just inversed and again notice how by
384.96s: trading these at a ratio I have
387.30s: unlimited downside profit potential in
390.00s: this scenario because this is a bearish
391.86s: play so sometimes this can live in the
394.32s: core allocation sometimes speculative
395.88s: for me though I split these up very
398.04s: purposefully I have a video that will
399.60s: walk through that for those that are
400.92s: interested I'll throw it in the video or
402.60s: in the video notes below and then again
405.18s: this can be bullish or bearish
406.62s: environments and again I call this
408.48s: volatility indifferent I use volatility
410.76s: indifferent because there are trade-offs
413.28s: here so the reason the core position
416.58s: here is the long option that's far out
420.36s: in time and deep in the money Vega or
424.08s: changes in volatility do not impact the
427.68s: price of those options that much that is
430.80s: the heart and soul of the position but
432.84s: regardless the long option is going to
435.96s: prefer in general lower volatility
438.06s: because if volatility expands you can
440.04s: make make money via it
441.84s: so there's that side but then we also
444.36s: have the short call or short put that
446.82s: we're selling against the long haul or
448.62s: the long put respectively and that would
450.66s: prefer High implied volatility so
453.06s: generally speaking this is going to be
455.82s: your short near term option is going to
458.16s: be way more sensitive to changes in
459.78s: volatility so there's a benefit there
462.24s: and the longer term options are going to
464.52s: be less sensitive to changes in
465.90s: volatility so again there's trade-offs
468.24s: here it's different parts of the trade
469.80s: like different changes in volatility but
472.08s: overall I will still trade these in
474.30s: varying volatility environments it's not
476.52s: necessarily the heart and soul of the
477.96s: trade let's move on now to the next one
481.68s: let's talk about short single options
484.08s: these take a pretty different shape for
486.72s: me this is when I want to trade
489.00s: directionally so if we have a high
491.88s: volatility environment that's trending
493.86s: one way or the other I will use short
496.20s: calls or short puts to take advantage of
498.24s: it now notice in this scenario I most
501.90s: certainly have a volatility preference I
504.84s: want implied volatility percentile to be
507.12s: high and it's because a major part of
510.06s: this trade is the movements in
512.58s: volatility
513.74s: whereas with these trades they have
517.44s: different aspects that benefit from
519.90s: different portions of volatility
521.76s: movements these not so much even though
525.54s: if I sell a short caller short put again
528.06s: there is a higher probability that I'm
529.86s: gonna have to deal with it at some point
531.42s: because if we have high implied
533.64s: volatility percentile we're expecting
535.38s: bigger moves that's a big part of the
537.42s: compensation for these trades so these
540.00s: are definitely speculative this is what
541.56s: I'm I want to get directional and again
543.36s: if you trade a short call you're going
544.68s: to be bearish if you trade a short put
546.06s: you're going to be bullish but these
548.46s: normally for me would be traded via
550.26s: margin and not cash secured like the uh
552.96s: the strangle
554.46s: on to the next two more we have short
557.10s: ratio straddle strangles I bucket these
559.26s: into the same category essentially
561.60s: because it's a similar concept just
563.70s: slight differences and this is when
565.62s: we're going to sell a call and put
569.28s: typically in the same expiration cycle
572.34s: if we're doing straddles it's going to
574.92s: be in the same series and it's going to
576.66s: look like this it's going to have a
577.80s: peaky top and strangles it's going to
580.56s: have more of this flat top and it's just
584.16s: because for short straddles we're going
586.44s: to use the same strike trying to get as
588.90s: close to the same Deltas on the column
590.70s: put side whereas for the strangles we
594.24s: typically are going to pick you know
596.52s: same Deltas but I'm sorry the same
599.40s: figure Delta but on the respective side
601.92s: so for the short straddle short
604.08s: strangles
605.22s: I'm sorry for the short straddles
606.84s: normally we're going to go right at the
608.70s: money something like that for short
610.68s: strangles I might do a 30 40 Delta call
613.08s: and a 30 40 Delta short put so it's
615.36s: going to put them at staggered strike
617.52s: prices as compared to the straddles and
620.10s: this ratio I apply to both if I have a
625.86s: pure volatility play in my mind I'm
629.10s: gonna gravitate towards a straddle but
631.62s: if I have a slight directional
633.84s: preference but I still want to play
635.82s: volatility very directly I sometimes
639.00s: will skew the straddle less likely than
641.28s: not more often than not I'm gonna go
643.50s: with strangles if I have some sort of
645.84s: preference for Direction so more often
649.14s: than not these are going to be
650.28s: speculative trades specifically for
652.32s: volatility not so much I don't expect
654.96s: the market to move and I want you to see
657.66s: this here that really codifies that I
661.56s: want to see a big variance between
664.02s: implied volatility in historic
666.06s: volatility specifically where implied
668.88s: volatility is tracking higher than than
671.64s: historic volatility that is the name of
673.62s: the game we want to sell volatility that
676.44s: is overpriced compared to what's being
678.78s: realized so this is definitely going to
681.78s: be tied to volatility trading this is
684.54s: not I don't have an opinion on where the
686.64s: Market's going so I'm just going to try
688.08s: to be neutral this is I have an opinion
690.60s: on volatility and it's that implied
692.52s: volatility is overpriced compared to
693.90s: Historic volatility a lot of people get
695.94s: that mixed up with these trades they
697.44s: want to just they can't pick a market
699.18s: Direction so they want to be neutral but
701.40s: what you are trading volatility with
702.90s: these strategies and you got to know
704.22s: that all right last one here
706.26s: long single options sometimes I use
709.26s: these if I'm buying units meaning really
711.60s: far out of the money long puts expecting
714.24s: kind of a large movement in an
716.40s: underlying or if I want to use leverage
719.28s: to speculate in a Direction but these
722.40s: are more rare than not a good example
725.28s: for something like this is
727.44s: more often than not I'm gonna end up
729.66s: turning it into a diagonal but sometimes
731.58s: not so what I mean by that is I have
733.92s: some long out of the money uh calls in
738.48s: huts I'm not really expecting much out
741.24s: of that trade it's didn't work in my
743.16s: favor but I used the long calls to
746.70s: essentially serve as my risk management
749.58s: meaning I had to Define risk moving into
751.86s: the trade it's cryptocurrency they move
753.48s: a lot and I fully expected it to be a
755.70s:  show so I used long call instead of
757.86s: buying the stock and setting a stop I
759.84s: wanted to give it enough room to move so
761.94s: in this case I used options to gain
764.28s: exposure to that the problem with using
766.32s: long singles to speculate on direction
768.12s: is even though you think you're
769.86s: speculating on Direction you are still
772.56s: speculating on volatility and that
774.48s: cannot be overstated enough
776.46s: if you are trading long single options
779.16s: just because you want to more
781.20s: efficiently in terms of capital use
783.84s: gain exposure directional exposure to an
786.78s: underlying to trade a hypothesis
788.46s: regardless of how you feel about the
790.38s: direction volatility still is a big say
792.54s: in this scenario so in this example
794.70s: notice what I have down here I'm not
796.86s: necessarily just looking for low implied
798.78s: volatility I prefer low implied
801.18s: volatility because similar to short
802.80s: single options
804.36s: it will increase my overall
806.22s: profitability if I get an implied
808.68s: volatility movement in my favor but
811.20s: really what I'm looking for here is a
813.90s: low variance between implied volatility
815.94s: and historic volatility I don't want to
818.22s: be overpaying for volatility that is the
820.98s: main thing I'm looking for here so
822.48s: that's the first threshold if that can
825.00s: happen and I can also obtain low implied
828.60s: volatility meaning I have room for
830.04s: implied volatility to expand it's a
831.90s: great scenario to be in but the main
833.64s: thing is checking out the variants so
835.02s: these are five of my favorite strategies
837.60s: and their derivatives on how I trade
839.70s: different market conditions this year
841.56s: it's been a lot of volatility trading
844.62s: for sure and that that's been the heart
848.04s: and soul be between earnings fomc
851.58s: announcements economic announcements and
854.70s: then still as always running the
857.34s: coverage strangle I almost always have
858.90s: exposure to the cover strangle out there
860.46s: because it works so well for me over
862.26s: time I've developed a great way to
864.00s: manage it I will link two videos for all
867.06s: of these in the description below so
868.62s: that you can check out any of the ones
869.76s: that you like don't forget to subscribe
871.44s: like the video see you all later being
873.48s: outlier
