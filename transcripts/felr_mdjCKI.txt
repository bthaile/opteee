0.00s: Do you know the difference between good and bad risk as a trader?
4.80s: My guess is most traders out there have an idea on a spectrum, but it's not really well-defined.
10.56s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through in detail good risk versus bad risk with examples.
17.60s: And then at the end of the video, I'm going to go through some best practices that I've learned
22.40s: from trading over the years.
23.92s: What's up everybody? Welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family.
27.84s: You guys make content like this possible for everybody else.
31.04s: So thank you for the support. Let's get straight into it.
33.84s: So first let's start with level setting.
36.40s: How do we make money in the markets?
37.84s: Well, really there's these two broad buckets.
40.24s: You can either earn the risk-free rate, so kind of government bond investing, something like that,
45.20s: which is seen as very, very low risk, which typically will correspond to pretty low returns.
51.76s: Or you can take risk of some sort.
54.72s: You can take speculative risk and guess on a direction.
57.92s: You can offload risk for another trader by assuming their risk via selling cash-secured puts,
64.00s: where somebody's buying puts for protection and you're selling them.
67.36s: There are lots of different ways to take risk.
70.24s: But the idea here is for us to understand the difference between good and bad risk
74.40s: and then most importantly, to understand what our individual risk profiles are.
80.80s: So for the next part of this, I want you to think about yourself.
84.64s: How do you think about risk?
86.88s: Because most people fall closer to one of two spectrums.
90.64s: Either you're very risk-averse.
93.04s: You don't want to take risk.
94.64s: You look to hedge risk at most opportunities.
97.52s: And unfortunately, this typically means you're not going to make any money.
100.72s: Because as you hedge all of this risk, all of that incurred cost,
104.88s: which pretty much moves you closer to this risk-free rate.
107.60s: Or you could be the kind of person that's very risk-open.
110.56s: You don't really think about it, probably not as much as you should.
114.24s: And sooner or later, you put on risk that you didn't fully think about
118.48s: and it runs you over and eviscerates your account.
121.12s: The idea here is to fall somewhere in the middle.
124.16s: Because notice here how I have R to R.
127.20s: This is risk and this is reward.
129.76s: Risk and reward are intimately tied to one another.
132.48s: It's not a one-to-one relationship.
134.32s: You can find really great risk opportunities,
136.88s: which we're going to talk about.
138.72s: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
140.00s: Here I come.
140.64s: Oh, here I come.
141.44s: Oh.
142.00s: But in general, you would do well to assume,
145.92s: if you see a big reward, there's probably a correspondingly-sized risk
150.88s: somewhere close by that you may or may not see.
154.08s: So the idea here is to see where you fall on this scale
158.48s: and then to create structures that allow you to operate effectively,
163.92s: given how you feel about these two extremes.
167.44s: So remember, as we go through this,
170.24s: not all risk is created equal.
172.80s: And the markets are indifferent to your perception,
176.56s: your preferences, none of that matters.
178.96s: The risk is going to be whatever the risk is.
181.28s: So let's talk about bad risk.
183.92s: The very first thing I have for you here is undefined risk.
187.52s: So what does that mean?
188.40s: Does that mean that I think every trade you put on
191.52s: has to be a vertical spread or something that has structurally defined risk?
195.84s: No, that's not what I mean.
197.36s: So take, for example, this vertical that we have in AMD.
201.60s: Instead of trading a vertical spread,
204.00s: which if you know anything about me,
205.44s: you know, actually don't like these.
207.04s: What do you hate me?
208.40s: You can manage risk a lot of other ways.
210.80s: You could define a period that if it gets to that point, you get out.
216.32s: So let's say in this example, you sell this short putt.
220.08s: Let's say it's not cash secured.
222.32s: And you're not wanting to take assignment.
224.80s: You can pick a point that you say, okay,
226.88s: if it gets below 80, I'm going to get out.
229.28s: And then you can validate that point.
231.12s: You could say, okay, if I look at a chart,
233.04s: do I think this gives the trade enough room to move?
235.28s: And if it gets down here,
236.40s: do I think that I'm adequately proven wrong?
239.28s: This happens to be below six month lows.
241.52s: In that case, that would probably be a really effective place to define your risk.
245.60s: So even in undefined risk trades,
248.40s: you can define your risk.
250.56s: The next is unknown risk using AMD again.
254.08s: Let's say in this trade,
256.40s: you wanted to put on this 24 November vertical short putt, whatever it is.
261.60s: But you didn't know I had earnings today.
264.56s: That is an unknown risk that you exposed yourself to.
268.80s: So we have to work around that.
270.64s: We have to think about different common sources of risk
274.40s: that you might not know about and make sure we check for them.
278.24s: You can create a trading checklist that allows you to look for these things.
282.24s: Another great example of unknown risk is
284.88s: let's say that you wanted to trade intraday SPX options
289.20s: and you didn't know FOMC was that day.
292.88s: That's another unknown risk that you're stepping in front of
296.72s: that you're not acknowledging.
298.08s: You don't know it's there.
299.44s: That's a problem.
300.64s: So we have to make sure that in our trading process,
303.68s: we have a way to identify most sources of risk.
308.72s: There is going to be risk you cannot control.
311.04s: That's okay.
312.08s: That's part of the game.
313.28s: But the idea is we want to know about almost all of it if possible.
318.56s: Then we have misunderstood risk.
320.24s: This comes in many different forms.
322.24s: So for example, a common misunderstood risk
326.08s: is that if we look at this vertical in AMD,
329.84s: people will assume that this is a safer trade
334.08s: than just selling the short putt.
336.64s: That's not necessarily the case because the cost to hedge via this long putt
343.20s: in the long run, this trade might actually not even be positively
348.24s: expected, meaning it can lose money in the long run compared to this one.
353.36s: So when we're thinking about risk,
355.84s: you have to think about this idea of catastrophic risk.
359.20s: If there's a big move, but then also the systematic risk.
362.72s: What does this do if we deploy it in the long run?
365.92s: This is also very akin to the common idea
368.56s: that really high probability strategies make money.
371.76s: That's also not so much the case.
373.84s: You can have something with the 90 plus percent win rate.
377.20s: But if the metrics of the trade in terms of average win size
381.84s: versus average loss size don't make sense,
384.64s: even with the 90 percent win rate,
386.48s: you can still lose money.
388.96s: So that leads us to this idea of good risk.
392.24s: I was sprinkling this in as we ran through the other scenarios.
396.24s: So the very first thing, a good risk is one that is defined.
401.28s: So if we're to trade this cash secured put
404.56s: or naked short putt in AMD, defining that risk,
409.52s: that's a good risk to take because then we can analyze
413.60s: that defined risk that we're setting compared to the profit potential
417.84s: and see if it makes sense.
419.36s: Next is unknown risk.
421.76s: I call this research risk, but essentially this is just where we don't have things
426.56s: sneaking up on us.
427.76s: So again, if I'm trading AMD, I know to look.
431.12s: When does it have earnings?
432.08s: Does it have any big news that's on the roadmap that's going to happen while I'm in the trade?
437.28s: And then we have misunderstood versus accepted risk.
441.04s: You can have, for example, risk in an earnings play,
445.52s: where there's an overnight move that's really big.
448.16s: If you accept that risk as part of a broader system and it still makes sense,
454.40s: that's a great example of accepted risk.
457.36s: It's something that you've analyzed, even if that risk is realized in a broader system,
462.56s: it still works out okay.
464.24s: It still makes sense.
465.68s: That is an example of good risk.
468.08s: Another great example of good risk is when you can create an asymmetric return profile.
476.00s: I have a recent trade that I talked about in another video in the VIX.
480.08s: That was a VIX ratio called diagonal where I was trading this to the upside.
484.88s: When I was placing this trade, it was on the 15th of September,
488.56s: just as the market started, well, the market was very, very relaxed,
493.44s: but the VIX fell below 13.
495.28s: So to me, that was as spot I was interested in getting long.
498.24s: Long story short, I looked at the upside potential,
501.84s: compared to what I considered to be the near term downside potential,
505.44s: where I was defining the risk in the trade.
508.08s: And this was essentially the downside risk I was accepting,
511.92s: about a dollar move in the VIX to the downside,
514.48s: compared to what I thought could be an $8 plus move to the upside.
518.40s: That's an asymmetric return profile that was created by defining the risk.
524.16s: That is another great example of good risk.
526.24s: So let's talk about some best practices.
528.16s: First, probably guess this.
529.84s: Every single trade that goes on needs to have risk defined.
533.20s: It doesn't always have to be structurally defined,
536.40s: but you have to define it as a trader.
538.40s: The second thing is we researched the potential risk to the trade,
542.48s: so that we know about them at least.
544.48s: And then we can assess the overall risk reward profile of the trade
549.12s: to make sure it makes sense.
551.28s: That is an idea that most traders forego,
555.44s: because they will look at something like a high win rate,
558.32s: and they're automatically on board,
560.08s: because they just think it's a high win rate.
562.00s: How could you lose?
563.04s: You can still lose money long term.
565.68s: That's why it is so important to look at the risk reward profile
570.32s: and the expected return of that strategy over the long run.
575.04s: So that's a general rundown of good versus bad risk.
578.80s: If there's anything I missed,
580.08s: throw it in the comments below.
581.52s: Don't forget, like, subscribe, be an outlier.
583.84s: I'll see you guys later.
