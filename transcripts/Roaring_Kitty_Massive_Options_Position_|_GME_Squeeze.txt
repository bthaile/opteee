0.80s: markets will forever continue to
2.92s: fascinate me but people like roaring
5.52s: Kitty are the anomalies you can't not be
9.24s: completely infatuated what this guy is
12.08s: doing so the goal of this video is
13.48s: actually to walk through his options
15.28s: position and talk about the settlement
17.88s: that's coming up on 21 June and how that
20.28s: might play out and the potential impacts
23.12s: to the markets now to be very clear I'm
25.76s: nowhere near as close to this entire
27.84s: Saga as a lot of other people are and
30.64s: shout out to the Apes however I am
33.52s: familiar with options so I want to focus
35.56s: on that perspective I'll definitely tie
37.36s: in as much general information as I can
39.88s: but it would be super helpful if you
41.84s: guys can throw in the comments the
43.52s: pieces that help fit this whole story
45.96s: together cuz I'm trying to share as much
48.48s: information as I can about the position
51.08s: what's up everyone Eric here welcome
52.48s: back to the outliers let's get right in
54.12s: so we have this gem to start off with
58.28s: and this essentially says uh screw it if
60.44s: DV exercises that I don't know if it's a
63.72s: banana or a plantain is going in
65.80s: someone's rectum a bold move cotton and
70.68s: we'll see if this person indeed has 50
74.40s: lb testes because that's probably what
76.08s: they're going to need in order to
77.28s: facilitate that movement but I want to
79.24s: highlight that because if you want to
80.72s: talk about one of the most fascinating
82.80s: groups of people to watch it's the ape
85.28s: Community I am they're just the coolest
87.48s: people ever this is hilarious to me and
89.96s: everything that they're doing and
90.92s: everything that they're standing for is
92.76s: also so cool it's why I hold shares of
96.24s: both AMC and gme it's literally just to
100.28s: support you guys in your movement
102.48s: because I find it so cool all right so
105.52s: let's talk a little bit about what's
106.80s: going on in the last few days so this is
108.80s: from Super stun and we saw a position
111.92s: posted by dfv and this is again on the
115.64s: 2nd of June and it highlights his
118.24s: initial position so what I see here is
121.04s: that we have 5 million shares of
122.96s: GameStop at
124.72s: 2127 and then we have
128.32s: 12,000 of the 21
130.84s: june2 calls that were entered in at
134.92s: $5
136.56s: 6754 average price so you can see the
139.96s: value of these positions and then he's
141.36s: sitting in about 29 mil cash this
145.32s: actually is pretty important by the way
147.00s: this 29 million cash and let's take a
150.40s: look at what was posted on the 3rd of
152.00s: June we can see that he was up $ 78.6
155.52s: million at the time of that post that's
158.40s: wild and the position was doing well and
161.48s: then we can fast forward again to the
162.96s: 6th of June so this is yesterday today's
165.52s: the 7th of the June the day of the live
167.08s: stream we'll grab some pieces from that
169.12s: in just a second and you can see his
171.16s: position here up uh border of a billion
176.56s: dollar again absolutely crazy so a
180.20s: couple things to note as of this posting
184.64s: the position obviously was crushing it
186.36s: and there's been a lot of speculation
188.20s: there's been people popping up like this
190.24s: from Citron research who this dude is
193.32s: known to be short GameStop we know he is
195.88s: a short GameStop position and it's not
198.32s: surprising at all to see him taking this
201.84s: angle essentially trying to diminish the
205.56s: value of the position and trying to
207.16s: paint it in a negative light because
208.64s: quite literally his fun depends on it
210.16s: he's in terrible terrible position right
213.28s: now you could take a look at this
215.40s: article from Yahoo finance and he got
219.24s: crushed on his previous attempt and now
224.24s: he is back at it
227.96s: so and as you can see from here he's
230.92s: back at attempting to short the stock
233.76s: now his position so far would have been
236.76s: up then down if we take a reference of
239.96s: how the performance has been so far at
242.92s: least in the past week and you can see
245.32s: it's pretty sporadic I'll get myself out
246.96s: of the way so that you can see cu the
248.16s: volume bars here matter a lot so his
250.92s: short would have been absolutely
252.16s: hammered here it's not looking great
254.04s: here either but definitely better off
256.32s: than where it was early in the week but
258.20s: the reason why all of that matters is
259.68s: because there's a lot of people out
261.08s: there that are trying to com kind of
264.72s: press this down from an Institutional
267.20s: perspective and you can see relics of
269.24s: that which again there's something to be
271.84s: said about just being wrong in a
273.40s: position okay so let's get over here and
277.68s: let's get into the details a bit more on
280.32s: his actual position and what this could
281.80s: look
282.68s: like if we take a look at the option
286.72s: position itself he essentially entered
288.88s: it in and it was a $68 million outlay
292.60s: when you're purchasing options like this
294.92s: you are paying for them upfront in cash
298.40s: so this means that at this juncture
300.48s: obviously he had enough cash to enter
302.48s: this entire position and he still has
305.04s: $29.5 million left over however if you
308.52s: notice the notional value of this
310.88s: position is massive and it's much more
315.16s: Capital than what he has available now
318.32s: it's essentially equivalent to 12
321.00s: million shares which in addition to his
323.20s: 5 million would make him the fourth
325.40s: largest shareholder which brings on a
327.88s: bunch of SEC regulations when it comes
330.16s: to his positions going forward from that
332.04s: but the main thing of Interest here is
335.00s: the fact that people are talking about
338.00s: whether he's going to exercise how he
340.00s: wants to approach that and one of the
341.24s: big issues is having the capital to
343.36s: exercise because right here he's not
345.28s: even close he needs a lot more money in
347.52s: order to be able to exercise this entire
349.68s: thing now let's talk about those
352.16s: scenarios though the first scenario it
354.64s: doesn't look like it's very likely to
358.36s: happen is the options could expire
361.36s: worthless What scenario would they
362.84s: expire worthless if these 20 calls that
365.36s: are out in 21 June fall out of the money
369.04s: so for example if we come in here to
371.48s: today's expiration all of these options
373.32s: that are out of the money will be worth
376.08s: nothing they will expire worthless his
378.24s: options right now are very deep in the
380.00s: money even with the recent down moves
382.04s: there's still over an 80 Delta trading
385.44s: essentially for double the value that he
387.00s: got in at so overall you can see that
390.28s: his position is still completely fine
392.28s: he's the Lion's Share of this open
395.24s: interest existing and there's only
397.08s: 13,600 transacted today at this level
400.64s: now the other thing I noticed when I was
402.08s: looking at this is it has tremendous
404.84s: call skew right no real surprise based
408.36s: on his position but his position is
411.24s: large enough to completely skew the
414.76s: options as they sit from a volume
417.12s: perspective and if we go to Oi
420.08s: you can see that there's massive massive
422.00s: call skue which for those that don't
423.32s: know you typically see putc with things
425.28s: priced into the downside but if we
427.68s: isolate the series that he's in you can
431.16s: see that he's again a big Pusher of the
435.24s: call skew here but even without him
437.96s: there still is some call skew present
440.64s: which is interesting now if we take a
442.64s: look at the following expiration beyond
444.44s: that there's even still some residual
446.40s: call skew although it's a little bit
448.24s: lighter and if we look look at these
450.04s: shorter term
451.44s: expirations there is slight put skew so
455.48s: right now the markets are a little bit
457.00s: all over the place but you can see that
459.24s: there is option transactions leading to
463.16s: Upward pricing thesis that's pretty
465.96s: clear for me to
467.44s: identify another thing that I find
469.48s: really interesting as of right now is
471.60s: notice the implied volatility for the
473.16s: near-term expirations compared to this
474.88s: 21 June this actually surprises me and
477.60s: it might be the market expecting him not
479.84s: to have the capital to actually exercise
483.08s: his shares because if we go back over
484.84s: here and we look at these other
485.96s: scenarios if he tries to sell to close
488.44s: this position entirely possible but it's
491.08s: 120,000 shares and time is starting to
493.76s: dwindle so what's going to happen is
495.96s: he's essentially going to be bidding
497.28s: against himself he's going to run out of
499.52s: liquidity because most of the ape Army
502.08s: salute to you guys again you're buying
504.64s: it right so then we need to find
506.92s: Opportunities to offset the position and
509.52s: sell them so the market makers will be
511.76s: able to have a bit of a field day with
514.12s: the liquidity here in terms of the
515.72s: spreads that they quote him they still
516.88s: have to be fair but he'll get definitely
519.56s: beat up on the spreads and on exit
521.76s: liquidity then we have the really
523.64s: interesting scenarios exercise and this
525.76s: is where moaz absolutely comes into the
528.68s: conversation now how much into the
531.20s: conversation it comes is Up For Debate
534.80s: because if we take a look at if he does
536.88s: exercise if he does have the capital or
539.24s: is access to the capital in order to
541.76s: support onboarding all of these shares
543.68s: including marginable value if you choose
545.36s: to take them on margin the market makers
548.24s: then need to locate this 12 million
551.68s: shares of a generally lowf float stock
555.80s: this kicks off what very likely can be a
559.36s: massive gamma squeeze gamma squeezes are
563.00s: very similar to a short squeeze except
565.04s: the primary difference here is that it's
567.20s: driven by market maker Behavior not
570.28s: individual Trader not the trader
572.36s: perspective it's driven by market makers
575.44s: and this can have pretty serious
577.56s: cascading effects because this increases
579.80s: demand for the stock heavily and again
582.24s: the fact that it's low float is really
584.60s: really
585.96s: important what's started to cause this
588.52s: is Again by the ape Community very
591.28s: smartly dsing their shares so that kind
594.88s: of system the direct registration system
596.92s: essentially locks those shares up so
598.64s: that they can't be moved around now when
601.32s: we look at the overall short position as
603.96s: it sits now you can see that the short
606.72s: interest is actually scaling up it's 68
610.12s: million and this is where it gets
612.20s: interesting the short interest ratio
613.88s: right now is 3.3 days to cover this is
616.32s: where it starts to get very interesting
619.56s: because as the percentage of shares
621.80s: shorted goes up slightly they become
624.56s: even more scarce the duration to cover
627.80s: them as it goes up causes an issue
630.76s: because then we have to locate shares
632.36s: quickly that are not there as other
634.36s: people are trying to get to those same
636.24s: shares and that's what creates a
638.40s: scarcity gamma squeeze then short
640.56s: squeeze so this is a fascinating
642.52s: position to have on right now of
644.92s: Interest however is this GameStop is
649.72s: potentially looking to offer
653.76s: more this can cause further share
657.12s: dilution the timing of this being
659.40s: brought up was a little strange compared
661.60s: to when dfv started talking about his
664.60s: positions but again you guys know way
667.04s: more about this than I do so I would
668.68s: love any ideas on the connection here
671.16s: but I find the timing of this
672.76s: interesting there are pros and cons in
675.12s: terms of the gamma squeeze thesis the
677.92s: severity of it would be diminished by
680.24s: this process however so for those that
683.28s: don't know you can go to dfvs page right
686.84s: here and you can check out all of his
690.84s: recent posts and it shows essentially by
694.88s: the last few days what this has been
696.80s: looking like and if you check out his
699.16s: live stream from today you can see his
701.92s: positions as they were and most
704.36s: importantly you can be reinforced at how
706.72s: this dude has quite literal Diamond
708.84s: hands as he's down $235 million still
712.76s: holding like a freaking Soldier the
715.36s: other thing is the stream was kind of
716.80s: interesting I didn't catch the whole
718.04s: thing but you could tell that this is a
720.84s: really smart dude that is doing a lot of
723.24s: trolling and I love to see it it's some
726.36s: of the coolest stuff to watch somebody
728.56s: with this kind of capital playing the
730.08s: games that he is against the people that
731.52s: he is it's just an absolute blast now
734.56s: the tricky part here again is this cash
736.96s: perspective so if we go back in here and
740.12s: we think about the exercise scenario
742.04s: there's another scenario in here where
744.20s: there could be a partial exercise where
746.40s: he doesn't exercise his entire position
748.28s: but some of it and that would still have
751.64s: a similar effect potentially causing a
753.48s: gamma squeeze but it might not be to the
755.04s: same magnitude so whether or not you
757.88s: care about this or not whether or not
759.64s: you're a GameStop buyer seller none of
761.52s: that really matters if you're involved
764.08s: in markets at all you should be watching
766.40s: this this is an absolute anomaly a
769.20s: spectacle of a scenario that might not
771.20s: ever happen again if you have any
772.88s: questions or anything to add to the
775.08s: dialogue please throw it in the comments
777.40s: below so I can learn more about this
779.52s: alongside with you guys be an outlier
781.28s: I'll see youall later
