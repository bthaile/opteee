0.00s:  What's up outliers? I forgot we're over here now. Gotta get the right spot. So I'm using
8.00s:  my little crappy camera. It's actually not a crappy camera. I just can't get it to look
11.76s:  even remotely good, but I don't think there's anything looking good with me in it. Anyways,
15.64s:  so none of it ultimately matters. But I'm using this one since the sessions tend to go
21.12s:  a little bit longer for this one, because I want to give you guys as much time as I can.
25.40s:  I want to be able to sit and stand and then sit again and then probably stand again
29.92s:  several times. I try to typically move like every 15 minutes. I don't like sitting all
33.92s:  day. But for whoever is in here, please first say hello in the chat so I can say hello
39.64s:  back. And then if there's anything in particular that you want to hit, just let me know.
43.80s:  We can slot it in as we go through kind of the standard agenda that I have built for
49.16s:  us. Or we can hit it at the end depending on the question and what makes sense for the
53.96s:  question that whole bit. It looks like we got Paulo, Samota, Jay and Chaser, good to
61.24s:  see all of you. And Paul is asking what kind of breed a dog. It is a multi-sputtle. Give
67.56s:  me one sec.
73.08s:  He ain't doing a whole lot. We might have to change because he's very, let's see. Does
78.84s:  he come through? Yeah, he's right there. He's kind of just like a big, big ball of
83.00s:  loop. He can't see too many eyes that he does have eyes. See if I pull his head. He's not
89.80s:  super into being disrupted during the sleep in sessions. He's in charging mode. What up, my boy.
96.28s:  A nice little nose lick. But he actually doesn't know that much about options. So we will retire him
104.28s:  back to his post. And I'm sure he will just crawl back and go to bed. That is essentially how he gets
112.68s:  down. All right. Back at it. Obviously, game stops up. But we don't have to talk about game
120.04s:  stop. I know I've been on game stopped for essentially the past week. When you trade options
127.24s:  as much as I do in your end markets as long as I am, it's not super common that you come across
133.16s:  super, super fascinating things like this because it has all the elements of a crazy story.
139.08s:  So I can't get enough of it. But enough of that. Let me move over. And again,
147.56s:  this is going to be as interactive as possible. I use this as a framework. Right. So I'm not giving
153.40s:  you a freaking PowerPoint presentation. I have zero interest in doing that.
159.80s:  Reggie says lies. I saw him reading options as a strategic investment. He probably could read it
163.88s:  better than me. I bet. I would not. I would not be surprised. We also got no you. That's hilarious.
169.32s:  That reminds me. We have another person named don't ask. Oh my God. We got to like get you guys.
175.00s:  You ever see those phone calls where people do a prank call between like two different
178.84s:  pizza places or Chinese restaurants and then like turn the phones so that they essentially try to
183.88s:  order from one another and it's a hilarious battle. I feel like don't ask and know you would be
189.24s:  perfect together in that sense. All right. What I'm going to do now is flip through the vast
197.16s:  majority of this. We covered a lot of this in the last session and also be completely straight
204.20s:  up with you guys. I don't know where we left off. So you will have to coach me a little bit. I will
208.84s:  share the link for the last session in the notes here. There you are. That is the last workshop
215.80s:  we've done. And then the other thing somebody asked me for is kind of some ideas for homework,
222.04s:  which is a great question. And especially for this group, the beginner level, I am throwing in
227.80s:  a playlist there that is kind of like an options intro playlist. Now a couple notes. Some of the
233.16s:  videos in there are super old. You will get a pretty hilarious look at old Eric in production
238.84s:  quality, which hasn't gotten much better, especially with this camera. But it's still generally
244.04s:  solid information. So it's a good spot to start. I have a new beginner video coming out and like
249.08s:  I don't even know how long at this point. We're so backed up with the videos I'm trying to get out.
252.68s:  I don't want to do two weeks. I feel like that's too much, although I did one like every day this week.
256.92s:  So who knows, man, literally who knows what's going on out here. All right. Let's start actually
264.28s:  with a question. And I like this question. And the other part beyond the question I'm not
269.32s:  even going to lie with you is the fact that I want this. I want to close this window because I have
273.24s:  too many windows open. So this is a way for me to answer the one eyed fat man and to close this
279.40s:  window out. And it's a great question. So essentially they said in regards to where I think I'm at,
284.76s:  they have you and Sinclair on one shoulder saying, don't be a pussy put on a damn trade, which is
289.80s:  literally great. And then it says, then I have me on my other shoulder saying, when there's no
296.04s:  trade, don't trade. And I think this is a fair spot to be at for a lot of traders. The easy way
302.60s:  I would look at this personally, I genuinely believe there's always a trade. I genuinely believe
309.32s:  that. Now, if you trade a system that is very specific on set criteria and there's genuinely not
317.08s:  always a trade for you, that's okay. Then I think this advice is fine. If there's no trade,
321.64s:  don't trade. But for me as a trader, one of my goals in developing my toolkit that I reference
328.12s:  all the time is to almost always be able to find a trade. There's not a great reason not to be
332.84s:  able to find a trade in my opinion other than a very niche skill set, which again, that can be a
337.56s:  completely viable system for people, especially for like very specific canceling breakout style traders.
344.28s:  You'll come across that exact kind of scenario. But to me, if you're running into that scenario too
350.76s:  often when there's no trade, don't trade to me. That means we need to broaden the skill set a
354.04s:  little bit. And the other thing is to just put on a damn trade. It's good advice. And there's
358.60s:  nothing wrong with just putting on a small trade. If as long as you have a solid system behind it,
364.60s:  and even if it's not fully fleshed out, as long as you're very careful about managing your risk,
370.04s:  you're not going to hurt yourself. So for example, if you're trying to do some sort of breakout
373.56s:  momentum following strategy and you buy a call, your risk is defined on the onset. So you literally
379.88s:  could go into that trade under the assumption of, I'm going to lose this $200 I used to buy this call.
386.60s:  You're not going to die. Like that's okay. But the main point is I don't actually think getting stuck
392.76s:  in this gridlock is super logical. And I think it stems from either not being willing to
399.00s:  size down enough to be able to be comfortable putting on the trade or not having a diverse enough
404.04s:  skill set. That's my take. Let's see, not sure if this would be a place I should pass
409.96s:  around the way up the ladder. If this is where I should live, nope, should not live there.
413.24s:  I guess I'm looking for a home-based daily routine to anchor everything. I think this is okay.
418.36s:  But I think over emphasizing kind of like comfort and in markets, it works and it doesn't work.
426.12s:  What I mean by that is you have to get comfortable working in uncomfortable conditions. One of the
430.52s:  uncomfortable conditions of markets is the fact that there is always going to be ambiguity.
437.08s:  You will never know with certainty at any point what's going to happen. So getting used to
442.44s:  operating in conditions like that. One of the big things I think that's worth mentioning to people
447.08s:  is getting way more comfortable looking at markets as probabilistic scenarios and decreasing
453.56s:  kind of the self-reflection and assessment of being wrong. Those are probably the most common themes
459.08s:  I see for traders that are too fearful to put on positions. Is they're terrified of being wrong?
464.52s:  And to me, again, that's one of the beautiful things about being like an idiot like I am.
469.56s:  I'm wrong literally all the time and I don't care. It's fine. I understand that in this world,
477.08s:  you're going to be wrong all the time. And if you use that and that scares you so much from
482.52s:  taking steps, guess what? You're never going to get better at something. So in my scenario,
487.96s:  I think having a routine is great. That makes a lot of sense. But the way I'm reading this home-based
493.72s:  kind of thing to me that just reeks of trying to be comfortable and wanting to be comfortable.
498.92s:  And you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable in my opinion. So that's what I say to that.
506.60s:  I guess picking core positions, building scans. Yep, that's good. I think I'm stuck there. Yeah.
511.64s:  And I mean, you will be stuck there unless you choose to not be stuck there. So then they go on
517.56s:  to say normally I copy people and then iterate on my own, but variants and constraints are so
521.88s:  wide with this. It's not the same as other skills. Yeah, I completely agree. You can't copy people
525.08s:  in this. You kid maybe take inspiration from here or there. But if this is your system of learning,
529.40s:  this is not good. So let's say let's go from here. It's really super, super simple. We're actually
536.76s:  going to cover it a little bit as we get through the presentation today. But you have an idea of
543.40s:  picking core strategies or structures that you might run, finding conditions to look for those.
548.84s:  Oh, like actually, I'm going to stop there because we're literally going to talk about this in
552.12s:  just a second. But we'll talk about these next steps from the jump here. Truck and plane. Good
559.80s:  afternoon from New Zealand. It's great to see you. And we're actually on our first stand-up face.
565.96s:  What time is it truck and plane in New Zealand? And while we're figuring out what time it is in New
571.96s:  Zealand, let's get into this. All right. So we talked about this stuff yesterday. Yada, yada, yada,
577.64s:  blah, blah, blah. This we didn't talk about because this is a new ad. And there's really nothing
583.48s:  revolutionary in here for you other than the fact that I like the colors. But I just want to give
588.84s:  you kind of this other side of the equation, primary market participants. There's way more than this.
594.76s:  But my goal here is for retail traders to see that there's a lot going on in the space.
602.12s:  These can break down into subcategories. The overall goal for these different entities is different.
609.96s:  But it's we're operating in a space that has a lot of other players. But there's a lot of different
615.72s:  rules. And that's a really common misconception. I was actually emailing somebody a little bit
620.44s:  earlier about this where markets are competitive. There's not just money laying around every
625.32s:  year everywhere. But at no point as you use the retail trader, you're not competing with high
630.76s:  frequency traders. They're literally doing something completely different than you. There's no
635.08s:  competition there loosely, right? Obviously, if you put a terrible offer out, one of the
640.28s:  algos might scoop it up in orbit. Sure. That's obviously an extreme scenario. But the entire world
646.60s:  that we play in is so different. It's so different than what the vast majority of these other
651.88s:  entities are doing. Prop traders are slightly different. They're way closer and there's definitely
655.64s:  competition there. Even market makers, there's some competition there because they can try to front
659.24s:  run your order if they think you're an informed trade coming through. But you're not in direct
664.12s:  competition with them. They're doing very different things writ large. High frequency traders
669.32s:  literally are fighting over how close they can locate near the exchange to decrease the length
677.64s:  of their freaking cables to transact milliseconds faster than somebody else. That's where they're at.
684.20s:  They're paying millions of dollars to do things like that and build a requisite infrastructure.
690.76s:  I'm not doing that at all. I'm sitting here with again a freaking sleeping dog in my office.
696.68s:  So again, the point is we're in a competitive space. Very, very different place.
703.80s:  Truck and plane says it's 12 p.m. Saturday. Oh, that's literally perfect. Great time change.
710.52s:  Pat says 011 in the UK. Good old UK. I wonder what the weather's like there.
718.68s:  All of says there's even cable speed bumps. Yeah. So that's really the point that to drive home
724.28s:  there. We already talked about this. This is actually what we're going to talk about.
728.68s:  So what I was going to for the one-eyed fat man that I was going to follow up with. And I don't
734.28s:  know why I like angles. This is actually really inconvenient. So you might have to tilt your head
739.08s:  to follow along here. But you know, so be it. What I'm highlighting in this slide is trading options
751.40s:  is really confusing to people and that they think options inherently provide some sort of edge
758.12s:  when they do not. So the way I think about trading options is the very first thing I'm doing
765.88s:  is devising a thesis based on a profit mechanism of some sort. So for example, if I want to trade
776.36s:  momentum breakouts to the upside, I can buy calls, I can sell puts, I can buy shares. That comes
782.68s:  down to optimizing what works best based on my deployment. The mechanism is the same across all
789.08s:  those different products. Momentum breakout to the upside. That's a directional trading strategy.
794.12s:  Now the cool part about options is you gain exposure to completely different asset classes
798.92s:  essentially, namely things like volatility. And you can trade a completely different world.
804.12s:  But again, in that scenario, volatility is the profit mechanism. Then the structures that you
811.08s:  then turn into strategies, that is simply the implementation of the tools. In this case,
816.60s:  that would be derivatives via options.
822.12s:  Truck complaint says, bro, my internet can only
824.84s:  comparally stream this damn live stream, let alone make a trade in milliseconds, literally.
829.72s:  That's actually hilarious.
833.48s:  Samota says, fit more in one slide, but still big enough to read. Yeah, I probably could size that
839.64s:  stuff up a little bit, I suppose. Jay says, kind of off that, how much do you think as a retail
846.12s:  trader, think about what the other traders are doing when planning your strategies of positions?
850.60s:  I guess stuff like sentiment indices and stuff like that. Yeah, that's a great question.
854.60s:  The first thing I will definitely mention on that is I think for retail traders, sometimes
859.16s:  they're way too concerned with other people with what other people are doing.
863.08s:  So trying to play the game of like, what's the other guy on my trade doing is really a fool's errand.
868.52s:  You're not going to learn much that way. So and the reason why I think that is because again,
873.00s:  like we don't know the motivation of the other side of your trade. You could have a roaring kitty
878.44s:  on the other side of your trade, who's literally just out there moving around, doing a bunch of
883.40s:  crazy seemingly things. He has his goal in mind, though. He's doing his thing. I don't know
889.48s:  about looking at half a billion dollars in the face and then taking shares of stock, but he made
894.36s:  that choice essentially. That's the cool part about markets and kind of what I'm highlighting
898.92s:  is that there are a lot of different reasons for what people do. So when planning strategies and
906.04s:  positions, you can leverage elements of sentiment, but that gets more baked into the strategy.
912.92s:  Way less about the, if I sell this call, that means the other person on the other side thinks
917.80s:  it's going up and maybe they know more than me. That could be the case. That could not be the case.
922.28s:  They also could be playing a completely different game than you. That long call could be some sort
927.00s:  of hedge that they're hoping to lose on against a larger position that they have elsewhere.
933.00s:  So again, playing the game of what's the other guy doing? It's okay to be aware of it and you
937.72s:  should be, but it's kind of a circuitous route. I think the most important thing you can focus on,
945.16s:  it's kind of a hat tip to the stoic methodology of things, but focusing on your control, what you
952.52s:  can control. You can't control what the other guys do and what they're thinking. You should be
956.60s:  generally aware that other market participants are generally smart. That's not always the case.
961.96s:  You could get paired up with a complete idiot. None of that matters necessarily, but as you're
967.48s:  playing the game, I think it's important to think markets are generally relatively informed.
973.40s:  If you see something that seems way too good to be true, you're probably missing something,
977.72s:  stuff like that. But it's a great question. I think the absolute focal point for traders, in my
985.56s:  opinion, is on your own book and on your own strategies. Whatever it is that whatever profit
993.56s:  mechanism that you first outlined and then measured and know is there, you can control that. You can
1000.52s:  see it. So going through that process is really important. This is a lot of what I share with you
1005.24s:  guys in the discord is just a bunch of different studies. I'm studying the markets every single day.
1013.16s:  I've built a massive data set that I query against just to look for ideas, just to confirm
1018.28s:  existing ideas and see if they're still relevant. But the whole point is just start here, profit
1024.68s:  mechanism. There's got to be something that makes money. You can then fit an option structure,
1029.16s:  then strategy around whatever that is. But to me, this would be essentially the primary focus.
1034.28s:  Being aware of the other counterparties good, but that's not going to tip the scales one way or the
1039.08s:  other. This one I think we already did. You guys already know about buyers and sellers. You
1046.36s:  guys already know the components of an options contract. You guys already know about calls and puts,
1051.64s:  which is great. This one I think I've added in. So this one is a bit of a ugly word slide.
1060.44s:  I think this covers most stuff that we've already hit on. Correct me if I'm wrong. But you guys,
1065.96s:  this might be worth lingering on for just a few moments, the pricing component.
1070.44s:  The at the end of the day, and I think we did talk about this, but I just want to make sure we did.
1076.12s:  When we're looking at options prices in the market, so if I come in here to GME,
1080.60s:  get rid of this example trade for now. And I'll pick something other than GME just so that you
1085.88s:  guys don't get completely fatigued by looking at the same thing because I'm obsessed with it right now.
1091.08s:  And let's say these 35 DTE 19 July Apple 205 puts these ones, the 26 Delta's.
1100.44s:  The way that this price is quoted here is by market consensus. That's really what it boils down to.
1107.48s:  Now we talk about all these different kinds of theoretical pricing models. We talk about things
1113.64s:  like the Black Sholes Martin pricing model, which actually doesn't represent markets. We can use
1120.12s:  it in some instances and it was the framework for how we originally started thinking about pricing
1124.04s:  options. You can use things like binomial trees. You can do all sorts of kind of different
1129.56s:  permutations of pricing models. They lay a foundation for us. The way that options are price in the
1135.72s:  market is via supply and demand. The other thing most importantly, as that educated price
1140.84s:  discovery is occurring and supply and demand is being established, what is happening is this.
1148.04s:  We are looking to solve for volatility. So as different entities are making markets, as you
1155.88s:  could probably tell by the way I'm framing that, making markets, market makers, they're determining
1161.08s:  what the value of volatility should be in their model to offer options at that price.
1167.24s:  So on the retail side, you can choose to attempt to track and forecast volatility. You can do that.
1175.00s:  And I'll actually talk a little bit about that later because I think there was a few questions
1179.08s:  about it. And I geek out geek out over that stuff. I have a bunch of different models built to try
1184.68s:  and do it. But the fact of the matter is, unless you think you can do it better than the market,
1189.80s:  your prices don't actually matter that much. That's why we call it implied volatility. We use
1196.36s:  whatever the market is pricing. So again, this 20526 delta put right now, the implied volatility
1202.84s:  is 21.08%. That's implied from the current pricing of the option. Regardless of what I get,
1210.52s:  this is probably more accurate, probably. It doesn't mean that it is. And there are opportunities
1217.16s:  to find misprice options. But I would consider that a much more sophisticated approach that will take
1222.92s:  time. That's not where I personally would start. That's not where I'm directing you guys.
1227.40s:  At least the whole concept of this is to share the path I would give myself to be very, very clear.
1234.04s:  So I wouldn't turn that off as something that you can't look at. But for example, a much better
1240.04s:  play if we want to use this specific volatility example. And if this is way too deep, literally,
1245.32s:  just let me know in the chat. And I can completely pivot. But I want to maybe see if this helps
1251.16s:  explain a few things. If we just look through this options chain and the implied volatility at
1256.68s:  different prices, there are some anomalies that immediately stick out to me. And there are relative
1264.60s:  pricing opportunities. So let's go maybe something like 21 days. Let's see if these are liquid enough.
1271.96s:  Just for an example, yeah, these are okay. So what you can do is monitor the value of implied
1281.00s:  volatility for different time frames and different strikes at different deltas in specific
1286.60s:  underlines. If you want to be sophisticated, you can import all of this data so that you don't
1290.76s:  have to manually comb through. If you're relatively new to this, you just pick a couple underlines.
1295.72s:  In general, if you're trying to look at volatility the way I'm about to describe it,
1299.96s:  doing it in super liquid products is not the move because there's so much liquidity and movement
1304.44s:  in these products. Finding mispricings becomes way more difficult because this is where a lot of
1308.84s:  people are looking. The more often opportunities are going to be found in like the trashy,
1314.20s:  less liquid, small products because for other entities to interact in those market spaces,
1319.64s:  it's just not worth their time and capital because they can't size a position on well enough.
1323.80s:  I'm priced out of a bunch of stuff and I'm still very much a small fish compared to the other
1328.92s:  entities I'm referring to. So if we look at the let's say 21 days to expiration and we look at the
1336.76s:  22 delta here, I see that that's priced at a 21.14. Let's go further out and I already forgot
1344.12s:  what delta I just told you guys 22 delta. Yeah, 22 delta. So let's find a 22 delta ish. There's no
1350.60s:  direct here that's kind of annoying. Let's see if we can find a 22 delta here. This is 24 delta.
1356.12s:  This 24 delta is priced at 21.29%. So you can come up with a relative value play based on
1362.76s:  a variance between these volatilities. What I'm highlighting in this scenario is that there are
1370.04s:  opportunities to play relative, relative premium opportunities in options, but it's a slightly more
1378.52s:  sophisticated strategy that requires more tracking. That's what this will boil down to. The other
1384.12s:  thing that you should note though is if we look across this options chain, notice why I have
1388.92s:  this to the volatility when it's at the money. You see 20.36% here and then you go further out of
1394.92s:  the money that volatility starts jacking way up. That's an important observation to make, especially
1401.16s:  if you're making relative volatility plays like we're talking about that creates different opportunities.
1406.84s:  You can also look at the corresponding delta put in call and see if there's some sort of skew there
1413.00s:  that you can play with. What I'm sharing here are just a bunch of random different ideas that I
1420.12s:  absolutely look at and trade from time to time in using something like what I would consider to be
1428.36s:  relative pricing opportunities. An entire different strategy of trading, which is the thing.
1435.00s:  Paul says what entities do you look for? Sorry, could you clarify that question? What entities do you
1440.92s:  look for? Do you mean what what the entities look for that I'm talking about in terms of their
1446.92s:  ability to be able to transact your what kind of products I look for? And then truck complaints says do
1452.52s:  you use volatility smile charts for that sort of thing? Do you prefer to look at the option chain?
1456.20s:  Yeah, yeah, definitely. So with you can use volatility smile and surface charts all the time,
1462.28s:  there's a bunch of different ones available. You can create your own in import if you like.
1466.52s:  You can use stuff like this down here, which is also super simple. It's a slightly less
1470.36s:  definitive model and it can be a little noisy. But in order to make something like this work, I
1475.00s:  typically would pick, you know, 50, 75 strikes which is pick 50. And then instead of all the
1479.72s:  different series, I would pick the primary series. So in this case, I would start by using the standard
1485.48s:  explorations, aka not the weekly. So I would pick like this, pick like this, pick like this.
1491.08s:  And then you can look literally for opportunities either relative to the call in the put side.
1497.48s:  If there's kinks like that, that's an opportunity. That's a relative value play.
1502.68s:  You can also, if you're so inclined, you can combine them and see if there's centralization
1507.32s:  around a specific strike. I prefer to look at calls and puts specifically. And the mean time,
1513.72s:  we go back down. But yeah, you can absolutely use smile or skew charts for sure.
1523.00s:  So Modus says canceas behind you. Oh, yeah, sorry. My bad. My B. It's literally right behind me.
1529.48s:  And all right, let me get me out of the way. There you go. So I'm talking about kinks like this.
1537.08s:  Or even kinks like this steeper is better. But stuff like that. Now you have to understand why
1543.56s:  it's there. That's an important component to this because the like these big dips, they might
1549.40s:  mean something. It's not always that you see these kind of really extreme drops. But again,
1555.40s:  it's a spot to at least potentially look. You can say, okay, perhaps in the, what is this?
1561.56s:  The 19 July's perhaps the 91 calls might be underpriced in terms of vol. Now again, this is probably
1568.44s:  something because it's after hours and markets are closed. You typically don't see stuff like zero
1573.16s:  out, right? It wouldn't have zero wall. But that's the idea. Anyways, is looking for relative value
1578.60s:  place, something like that. Paul says products. Yeah. So for products, what I'm talking about,
1587.48s:  what I'm looking for, it's especially for these relative value plays. I'm looking for things
1593.56s:  that have interesting, interesting volatility. If there's an event coming up that helps a lot,
1602.28s:  that's a slightly different style play, but that's also one that I would integrate into this.
1607.24s:  And I also care if it's moderately liquid. Again, for me, I've been kind of priced out of a lot of
1616.84s:  things that I typically would trade previously, but a great example of a previous book that I
1623.64s:  normally would try to a biotech. Now when I trade biotech, I have to trade it smaller and I
1628.68s:  essentially have to size it as if I can't manage it again. So the way I can trade that is very
1633.80s:  different. So Modus says, cause of kinks. Yeah. The, I mean, the simplest explanation without
1642.44s:  going super far in the weeds on that, kinks are caused by different relative volatility pricing.
1648.92s:  That's all that means. So in that case, as we're looking at implied volatility curve, that simply
1653.16s:  means at this strike for whatever reason, it's priced either low or high relative to everything else
1658.84s:  that's around it. Now why that's priced as that? That's kind of part of the name of the game.
1663.96s:  We got to lose the socks. It's a little too warm in here now. That's kind of part of the name of
1669.32s:  the game is determining why, but yeah, the short answer is to why that happens is it's simply because
1677.00s:  volatility is either underpriced or overpriced relative to what's right around it and that same
1681.72s:  expiration cycle. And then again, on that same thing, you can compare other like different
1687.08s:  expiration cycles to one another. So let's see if we use like SPX.
1697.96s:  And again, like this, you have to get rid of a bunch of the series. There's just way, way too
1701.16s:  much noise in order to be able to see anything quarterly. So this right there, this is another
1705.88s:  immediate relative value play that I can see. If you can see it, throw it in the chat before I
1709.72s:  answer, there's actually several of them in this case. And again, the way that you play it is
1714.28s:  different and the way that it unwinds is different. Just because you play, it doesn't mean it works out.
1730.28s:  I'm curious if you guys have any guesses as to what I'm seeing specifically on the call side here,
1734.36s:  at least. Oh my God. I just swallowed a piece that went down the exact wrong tube.
1748.28s:  Alex says, kink exactly. And this is large enough. This is now interesting to me because that is a
1755.64s:  very distinct kink. And Alex's other perspective, so notice this can see puts out, yeah, it's fine.
1765.08s:  I'm not talking about the puts side. Don't worry about it. But the other thing that Alex points out
1770.20s:  is exactly correct. We're looking at the slope variance between these aspirations. So now what you
1775.96s:  can do is say, okay, I want to look at, I actually don't know what those DTEs are. Let's take a quick
1781.56s:  look. 21 June, 34, and then the 16 August, which is 60 days. Let's add that August in there.
1790.36s:  This one. So now you get to make a decision. You can say you have the 21 June down here, the 28 June
1797.40s:  up here, the 16 August here. You can even add another one, maybe the 19 July.
1804.84s:  You can make a determination. One, notice the kink here in this specific exploration cycle. This
1810.44s:  is in the 28 June. That's something that you're not seeing on anything else. This is a great example
1815.48s:  of a relative value play in terms of volatility. The other thing I see is notice that the
1819.32s:  departure between these two lines relative to one another, the 19 July's are much less steep in
1825.00s:  terms of their drop as compared to the 28 June. So what we're seeing very clearly is more of
1830.84s:  volatility being priced into the calls here this far out in time. That's again, something you can
1836.52s:  play. Now on the put side, which now I do want you to look at. So I will get out your way.
1842.28s:  Is look at this. How much the 21 June's peaked on the put side compared to the 28 June's.
1852.60s:  This is another relative value play. So just looking in volatility, you can find tons and tons
1860.20s:  and tons of ideas. That's why I say there's always trades. There's literally always trades.
1866.04s:  All right, I'd probably just keep myself on the top right. Keep me out of the way for you guys.
1870.76s:  I don't really think anybody's super eager to look at me. I'm not eager to look at me.
1876.28s:  Though multiply are you guys know, right? That's just the standard
1882.68s:  that's the standard size of a contract. So if we grab spy, it's better example since there's
1888.68s:  an underlying that trades. And we look at any of these options, you have to multiply the premium by
1894.36s:  100. And that is because this represents 100 shares. There are actually, I don't know if they're
1901.00s:  still arke. You guys know if there's still many options there used to be. I know that there's
1905.56s:  like teeth style options is compared to like SPX. There's like the little brother, which are
1911.16s:  the tenth the size. But that's the product itself. I'm curious about options themselves.
1916.28s:  Because I think they used to have like Apple minis. I think they got rid of them though because I
1920.04s:  don't think they were super liquid. Damn it. Chat GPT just signed me out at the worst possible time.
1926.28s:  I was going to have chat GPT look it up for us. I bet we could still have chat GPT.
1933.08s:  I don't think so. I haven't seen them. And Apple was one of the products. They try to pick the
1936.60s:  most liquid products. Here we go. Do markets still offer many options? Let's see the answer.
1950.44s:  As of now, many options are generally not available for individual stocks or ETFs. Yeah. They were
1960.60s:  introduced to allow smaller investors to trade options with lower capital requirements since many
1964.60s:  options represent 10 shares instead of 100. But they were discontinued due to low trading
1969.32s:  volume and demand. Yeah, makes it so. So that's super common. And it's because options people
1975.72s:  don't realize like how liquidity based this stuff is. It's wildly wildly liquidity based.
1983.88s:  And that's why when we look at something like SPX, it's why you see literally daily
1990.84s:  expressions because there's enough liquidity. There's enough demand to transact in these time frames,
1996.12s:  which is actually very, very cool. That's stuff like that is a thing.
2000.36s:  Trot complaints as many futures completely different concept when we're talking about the underlying
2005.96s:  itself as compared to the options on the underlying. But yeah, you're 100% correct. There are
2011.96s:  the micros. So you have the eminies and the micros which are smaller than you have things like SPX
2017.08s:  versus I think it's what excess P. Is that right? The mini. Yeah. So this is the mini SPX index.
2024.60s:  So it takes it down massively takes it down to 543 versus 5431. So yeah, there are many products,
2035.16s:  but there's not many options. I don't know if you guys ever actually seen that. For me,
2039.08s:  I'm ever seeing them pop up. And then they have I haven't seen them since. So it makes sense. They
2044.60s:  have disappeared due to lack of interest. But anyways, that's what the multiplier is. It used to be
2049.64s:  that there used to be minis. So you kind of have to know if it's multiplied by 110, but now it's easy.
2055.80s:  It's all 100. American versus European options is important from a few different perspectives.
2061.24s:  And you guys should know what that is by now, I think. I think we talked about that last time as well.
2065.32s:  But it's essentially when an option can be exercised. American style options can be exercised. And I
2071.72s:  guess I should say exercise here versus assigned at any time. So if roaring kitty, for example,
2080.52s:  great example, if he exercises options, it's due to the fact that they're American, he's able to
2085.08s:  exercise them at any point in time. A lot of products are American style of as majority,
2092.36s:  but there are European style options. So things like SPX is European style option. That means it can
2099.40s:  only be exercised at expiration. That impacts the risk of the position so that actually impacts the
2106.76s:  pricing pretty significantly. J Kim says, so can you exercise the option when it hurts you? You can,
2114.36s:  but it wouldn't help you. Unfortunately, if you're exercising an option that's not doing what you
2120.92s:  want as the buyer, only the buyer can I forgot what you can't reason right now, which one do I look
2124.84s:  that one? Okay. As the buyer, you get to choose the seller. You don't get to choose it all. But as
2131.32s:  the buyer, if you choose to exercise an option that's not working, let's look at an example and
2136.28s:  go down that rabbit hole, a PL again. Oh, let's use Nvidia. I haven't looked at it much since
2143.56s:  it's split. Check that out. That's super cool. 131, little baby product now. So if we let's say we
2152.04s:  bought this call, the one throughout even better, even better, I'm going to go into on demand. So this
2157.72s:  is now taking us back in time so that we can look at an example and then kind of dissect how this goes.
2166.84s:  And what's actually even better is if I go in here and I find a time where this wouldn't work well
2172.84s:  for us. So I'm actually going to find another product that's not going up IWM as a great example.
2178.60s:  So let's go back in time to the 28th of March. And let's take a look at how this would perform
2187.64s:  down to the 19th of April. So I'm going to go back into on demand. I'm going to take us back to March
2195.08s:  28th. I'm going to change the time to that. So you'll see this chart update. This is one of the
2202.04s:  cool things you could do. And think or swim is kind of go back and play. It's I think especially
2206.84s:  for stuff like this, I'm hopeful that it'll better elucidate the point because one of the things I
2211.88s:  can do sometimes that's not super fair is because I can kind of like see all this stuff in my head.
2216.60s:  I know that sometimes as I'm talking about it, it's not as clear maybe as it is to me. So
2222.84s:  let's take a look at let's just say we wanted to buy a call. Now another great kind of workshop
2228.84s:  topic here. When I'm looking to buy a call, I'm going to freeze the market so it's not nice. When I'm
2234.44s:  looking to buy a call, I'm typically going to try to go further out in time, typically greater than
2239.56s:  60 days. And I'm typically going to try to go in the money at least a little bit. Do you guys have
2246.20s:  any idea why I would do that? And if you don't know what any of that means, that's completely okay,
2253.16s:  you don't have to. Part of what I like to do when I'm talking about this stuff is surround you with
2259.08s:  the topics and concepts. And it's not all going to make sense right out of the gate. But as you hear
2264.52s:  over time, it will start to click. So even if it's something that sounds like a different language to
2268.84s:  you, that's completely okay, just literally let it passively into your mind. So the reason why we do
2276.36s:  this is because the way that Delta behaves. Alex says, Jay says with more DTE, you would have
2285.72s:  more time to enter in the money. Yep. So that's a great, great point. So with more
2291.88s:  days to expiration, you have more time for the trade to move in your favor. Now,
2301.00s:  it to be very clear in it does not have to go in the money in order for you to make money on your
2308.76s:  long option. So if you buy a call or buy a put, the underlying does not need to go in the money
2315.80s:  in order for you to start making money. It doesn't even have to go to your strike. It just needs to
2320.44s:  move in the correct direction. And then Dennis says to reduce risk. It's a good point. Now,
2326.04s:  that's a tricky one though, because when you go further out in time, let's take a look at an example.
2330.84s:  If I buy these 22 DTE IWM calls, let's say I go at the money. These two 12s are trading for like
2339.72s:  292, something like that. If I go out to beyond 60 days, 85 days, and I go to a like a 52 Delta,
2346.28s:  again, these are now trading for like 7625. So did I actually reduce risk? Kind of not, because
2354.20s:  these are more expensive. So if I'm buying an option, if we buy a call, we know our max risk is
2361.00s:  defined by the premium we pay. In this case, your max risk is lower on a dollar basis, because
2369.88s:  this is a lower dollar amount. And this trade, I buy it for $392. In this trade, I have to put up
2377.24s:  more money. I have to put up $762. Put this trade on. So on a dollar basis, it's more risk.
2385.48s:  Now, in terms of the dynamics of the position and holding this position,
2390.04s:  going further out in time gives your option more time to work. So in that sense, it decreases your
2397.96s:  time risk. So what I'm highlighting is when we're talking about options, it is really, really important
2403.80s:  to decouple the various types of risk that exist for us now, because when you're trading something
2409.16s:  like equities, risk is pretty straightforward. You put your money in, it goes up or down. That's
2414.20s:  about as much there is to it. It's as simple as it gets. With options, we introduce again, like we
2419.64s:  talked about in the last session, a lot of complexity. We now have time risk. We need to be correct
2424.60s:  in the correct amount of time. We have volatility risk. If volatility moves unfavorably to us,
2429.16s:  it can temporarily decrease the profitability of our position, or permanently if it stays down,
2434.04s:  or up. We now have interest rate risk, less applicable in most scenarios, but it's worth mentioning.
2440.44s:  It's not something you typically have to worry too much about. So Dennis, your instincts there
2445.40s:  are right on, but it's just really important to get a little more nuanced with the response.
2451.72s:  Tommy says, slightly in the money less theta decay, position behaves more like shares. That's
2456.20s:  exactly it. So as soon as you go deeper in the money with a higher delta, you're going to decrease
2459.72s:  your theta decay. However, you're paying more money up front. So you're essentially
2466.36s:  taking two different risk profiles and modulating them to be what you want. If I go further in the
2472.52s:  money, my cost risk profile is going up. However, my theta decay profile, which is this here, we'll go
2480.60s:  down. So one of the cool parts is you can de-conflict things like theta decay by using different
2487.72s:  delta's or by using different times. Because for example, 85 days to expiration, if we take a look at
2494.12s:  the theta decay for the at the money strikes, it's six cents. If we go super deep in the money all
2500.84s:  the way down to an 81 delta, it's five cents. You've decreased it by one penny. Is that worth the
2508.12s:  cost? For me, it wouldn't be at all. I don't care about that one penny in theta decay. That is
2512.44s:  completely fine. So then it's more of a scenario of, okay, this metric theta decay doesn't matter
2518.68s:  to me as much. So now, how do I feel about the cost relative to the delta? Do I think that there's
2523.48s:  going to be a really big move? If so, maybe I go something out here, it's like a 50 delta.
2529.16s:  If I think it's going to be maybe a smaller move and I want to participate in more of it on a
2532.76s:  dollar for dollar basis, maybe I go deeper in the money and cough up the money. Don't know. But that's
2537.72s:  the cool part with options is you get to pick all of those details. So now going back to Jay's
2543.24s:  original question, let's say that we want to analyze exercising the options if things are
2549.72s:  not working in our favor. So let's say we buy these 50 DTE 212s. So they're going to cost us. I'm
2558.60s:  just going to make it 660. So it's easier to talk about. It'll cost us 660 bucks. Now let's fast
2564.36s:  forward time and we'll go out to April and I think it was kind of crappy around like the 18th of
2570.20s:  the 20th or something. Let's go out here and let's see what our option is trading for at that time.
2575.80s:  Yeah, it went way down. And we have the 212s. So what's going to happen here is you're going to see
2584.44s:  the option move super far out of the money in a way from where we're at, which is unfavorable to
2591.40s:  the long call. There it goes. So 212s are now way out here. So the option that we bought for $6.60
2598.84s:  is now worth 45 cents. It's essentially completely further out of the money. So following Jay's joking,
2605.08s:  but still a good hypothesis to to to play out is well, what if we exercise the option? What you can,
2613.56s:  but a few things happen when you exercise the option one, you forego the remaining extrinsic value
2620.44s:  that you could have captured by selling the option. So if I sell the option to close the position,
2626.60s:  I capture this cost back to me. I get it back. You lost most of your option, but you still get
2632.20s:  some back. If you exercise, this is just going. The other thing is if you're a long call, it gives you
2638.44s:  the right to purchase shares at a specific price, your strike price. And in this case, we have the
2643.96s:  so I WM is now trading at 195 02. So sure, you can buy them at 212. I would want to buy a
2651.80s:  met to 12, not even close. So if you're, however, saying, well, I really don't want to take this loss
2658.20s:  and I want to hold the position for a long time and build a position, you can do that. But that
2663.08s:  obsession with trying to avoid losing trades is way more damaging than it's helpful. So for me,
2669.56s:  if I felt that kind of way that I really wanted to build a big position in I WM and I like it here,
2674.28s:  you can just eat this cost, recoup your extrinsic value and then just buy it at the money.
2679.72s:  You're going to lose the money here. It's gone already, but you're not essentially doubling down
2684.20s:  into something that's moving against you and then tying up capital way more capital for a
2689.08s:  longer period of time. Because again, you have to buy 100 shares at 212. So 21,200. So Jay, I know
2698.12s:  you obviously meant that partially as a joke, but that's actually why it doesn't help you at all.
2702.68s:  It does us very, very little good. Then it says less of a lottery ticket type trade, so a bit more
2709.40s:  money paid up from higher chance of profit. That is literally exactly correct. That is exactly
2713.80s:  correct. The way to think about those kinds of plays, at least the way that I trade long options,
2718.12s:  which again, big caveat. I'm kind of talking to you guys from the perspective of how I do business.
2723.96s:  There are other people who trade lots of different ways. If you listen to any of the books,
2729.16s:  Stock Market Wizards by Jack Schwager, you'll hear that everybody has a different approach.
2734.44s:  And funny enough, the way that markets are, everybody has an approach that can work for them.
2739.40s:  It's there. But what's really important is defining an approach that aligns with you as a human
2745.16s:  being. That is so freaking important. I cannot overstate it. And it's really hard to find out. It
2750.60s:  takes some time. I bring that up because again, I'm talking about the way that I think about
2756.12s:  using something like a long call. I'm using it for a leverage directional play. Other people can
2761.32s:  absolutely try to just go with yellows. They can try to go super far out of the money. They don't
2766.44s:  care if they lose 90 of 100 trades. But if those 10 trades actually are profitable enough to over
2773.16s:  one of those losses, then it's still profitable. Just not how I do business. So just a really important
2777.64s:  caveat. Now, when we are looking at these different structures, which we're going to get to in a
2783.80s:  minute, you'll notice that as I'm talking about them, there's a lot, a lot of different trade-offs.
2788.60s:  And that's the cool part about options because for something like a ratio call diagonal,
2793.08s:  one of my go-to strategies, I often will add what I call kicker options, which is actually kind of
2799.88s:  closer to what Dennis is talking about. So sometimes if I'm really convicted in something that I think
2806.68s:  it's going to go up, let's for whatever reason. So let's say for right now, I just think I W
2810.28s:  going to go up. I probably wouldn't hear yet until a little more confirmation. But let's just
2814.04s:  play the scenario. I think this is going to go up. Well, I can trade a ratio call diagonal. I can go
2820.36s:  out, let's say 90 days by my in the money option. But I'm really convicted that this thing is going
2826.20s:  to move. So what I can do on top of that is I can go a little closer in time and go further out of
2833.24s:  the money. These are cheaper options. But the way that they will behave is very different. Let's
2839.40s:  take a look. Let's say we buy these two 11s. Can you do analyze trade in here? Yes. Kind of slow,
2848.92s:  but okay, great. That works. Great, great, great. And then let's take a look at this, the 92.
2856.52s:  And let's say that we get like 80 delta. Let's take a look at how this looks.
2865.00s:  So let's take a look at a couple scenarios. We think IWM is going to go up a whole bunch.
2869.96s:  Well, we can go further out in time, deeper in the money. It's going to cost us way more money
2875.08s:  upfront in this scenario. I would be paying 1966. So $1,966. And this down here would be only $175.
2884.68s:  If I did the 21 June 21 11s, big difference in delta. These are 20 delta, the 211s, the 180s are
2893.08s:  a 79.63 delta. So call it an 80 delta. So before I show you the difference between these, what can you
2901.24s:  infer if we get a price accommodation? How would these behave? And I specifically want to know
2909.08s:  which one would compound better? Which one would make more money as a gross dollar amount?
2917.48s:  Paul says, how would you have explored that king in the SPX curve? That would be a relative
2922.04s:  wallplay. So you can either trade the expected fade of the point or you can trade the expected
2927.72s:  rise of the surrounding walls. You could trade relative to a different time frame.
2934.20s:  In order for you to answer that question for yourself, what you would need to do is study them
2939.96s:  a little bit and see how different structures behave around it. That's the correct answer for you.
2946.84s:  Truck complaints says option with the higher delta will make more money. Okay.
2953.24s:  So far so good. Which option compounds more? Any thoughts?
2964.12s:  Do you guys know what I mean by compounds more?
2972.60s:  Lot of us. Yeah. The further out of the money, the kicker options.
2977.08s:  Truck complaints says no, that's perfect. So when I talk about compounding more, yep,
2981.88s:  Samo does exactly correct. The percent return on an invested capital. So let's take a look at
2987.08s:  these two different scenarios. Let's say that we get, do these plot here? They don't. That's kind
2991.96s:  of annoying. It'll be it. Let's say we get a move to 240. At 240, our single, deep in the money
3003.08s:  option would provide a profit of 41, 24. So let's say 41, 24 divided by 1966. So that gives us
3017.64s:  a 209 percent return on an invested capital. Really good return at 240. That's a big move, by the way.
3026.92s:  If we take a look at the further out of the money option, this option only returns 28, 12. However,
3035.72s:  you only put in 175 dollars. So this option returns 1607 percent. That's compounding.
3047.00s:  In this cheaper option, you will get a lower dollar return as a gross figure, but you will get
3055.40s:  if it's a big accommodating move, a much better percent compound return. That's the trade off.
3063.16s:  So then you get to then make a decision. You could say, well, I think there's going to be a really,
3068.12s:  really big move. So rather than putting one trade on at 1966, I'm going to go further out of the
3074.36s:  money and I'm going to put on six trades. Oops, that's wrong button.
3081.64s:  Look at what this was trading at. Let's call it 175. And in this case, we've put on six.
3087.72s:  This is still cheaper than what you paid for this one option. So if you have that 175 times six,
3095.40s:  you'd be putting up a thousand and fifty bucks. So this is still half the size of this position.
3100.84s:  But let's say you still get that same accommodating move to 240. Now your return is 16,246.
3108.28s:  That's leverage. That is quite literally leverage at play.
3113.80s:  Paul says, I can't see the entire strategy. Which strategy you talk about?
3118.44s:  You talk about here? You can see the whole thing. Yeah, this is all the wrist shut.
3125.56s:  Are you talking about the SPX stuff? The SPX stuff is a whole different ballgame. We can
3129.56s:  absolutely talk about that a little bit more in another session. But I think getting into
3133.48s:  a ball relative place because the other thing, if you start doing stuff like that, you have to get
3137.08s:  more sophisticated with the approach to isolate the volatility. So you have to do things like
3140.44s:  Gamahedge. And that opens up a completely completely different dialogue. It's cool stuff, but
3145.88s:  not so fitting at least for this dialogue. So anyways, back to this. If we take a look at
3154.12s:  the compounding potential for these cheaper, further out of the money options, it's much bigger.
3158.68s:  And if you put on same size positions, you can make way more money. But again,
3164.36s:  you need a bigger move in order for these to pay you out as much as what you can make on a dollar
3170.44s:  for dollar basis with deeper in the money options. Truck Complain says, what are the drawbacks about
3177.08s:  doing more out of the money options first, less in the money options apart from lower chance of profit?
3183.16s:  I just said another component to it. Can you guys take a guess at what it is?
3187.48s:  Right now we're using a scenario where essentially we're presuming IWM goes from 195
3194.12s:  all the way up to 240.
3203.88s:  Shrey says higher chance of loss. Yep, well, I guess that's kind of the inverse of
3209.48s:  probability profit. Yep. Okay. Shrey J is on it like white on rice. That's a massive, massive point.
3216.92s:  So if we take a look at theta decay, this option is losing five cents a day. If we go to the 60 day,
3227.32s:  and we look at theta decay, this option is using four cents a day. So you might be saying,
3233.32s:  well, wait a minute. This is losing more, oh, five cents. This is losing five cents.
3238.92s:  So why, like, what's going on here? Why would this not be the optimal answer? Well,
3243.96s:  look at it as a percentage relative to the premium of the option. This is losing five cents on
3250.36s:  something that again, we got into for 1966. If we look at this, this is losing four cents on
3256.36s:  something that has a dollar 75 left to go. As a percentage, the theta decay here is massive.
3263.00s:  So you are bleeding heavily. And this is already going 64 days out, which again, most people
3269.08s:  don't do when they're buying options. They're really cheap. When most people are buying options,
3272.68s:  they're going like same week, maybe two weeks if they're slightly patient. And if we take a look
3277.40s:  at that profile, and we look at again, like a 20 delta out of the money option, this thing is
3283.48s:  worth 90 cents. And it's losing nine cents a day. It's decaying at a massive relative rate to
3291.56s:  the premium that's there. So that's the other reason. The other thing is you need a big move.
3297.72s:  You need a big accommodating move in order to start seeing your money. If you see a small move,
3303.88s:  even with a larger position, unless the delta's are the same aggregate size, it doesn't matter.
3310.04s:  What I mean by that is again, if we're looking at this further out in time, this is 80 delta's.
3317.00s:  Right? At the time you put the trade on, you get your 80 delta's. If we go to some
3321.96s:  like two weeks out and we go to the super far out of the money, let's say these 14 delta's.
3329.16s:  Unless you put on the commensurate size that would equal 80 delta's here, then you don't see the
3336.92s:  same short term price appreciation if you don't get a big move. It means you really need these
3343.08s:  to compound via gamma to start seeing an actual return on the capital that's meaningful.
3350.52s:  It's a great question. It's exactly the kind of stuff you guys should be looking at. So I'm glad
3353.64s:  that you asked that. And then this one, I think we talked about this one already, closing positions,
3362.36s:  spider open, sell the clothes, sell the open by the clothes, essentially just inversing.
3366.60s:  Now with options, we can talk about the different scenarios that can happen for an unwind.
3371.32s:  So you can close the contracts. That's kind of what most people tend to do. It's typically a little
3377.00s:  bit more efficient. You can choose to exercise if you're the buyer, which as we talked about,
3382.68s:  you give up the remaining extrinsic value. And then either you would buy or sell shares
3387.96s:  at the strike price if it's a caller put respectively. And if you're a seller, you could choose to
3393.56s:  hold it all the way through expiration. You could do that as a buyer as well. But it's typically not
3399.16s:  advantageous for a buyer to take something all the way into expiration because if you have something
3404.60s:  that's really far out of the money, let's say in IWM, let's actually pull up the real market now,
3409.56s:  because we're on expiration Friday. So let's say you have these options that expire in three days.
3416.28s:  And let's say that you had these 196s. So and let's say you bought these puts,
3422.44s:  they have a really low probability of being in the money at expiration, less than 50%.
3427.24s:  Even of a touch, sorry, to be super clear. These have a low probability of being touched of 32%
3432.36s:  and being in the money is 16.04%. So low probability trade here.
3437.48s:  You could as the buyer of these options say, okay, this didn't move in my favor,
3442.36s:  rather than hold it to expiration on hope EM. And maybe this thing will work out.
3447.00s:  You can just close a position and you can at least recoup some of your costs. Those kinds of
3451.48s:  decisions have to be defined ahead of time. You can not make them up on the fly. You cannot.
3460.04s:  The reason why you cannot make them up on the fly is because you cannot think of any one trade
3466.36s:  as kind of your book, the end all be all. Everything you do as a trader should be viewed in the
3473.00s:  performance of a long term system. So if in this individual scenario, you're like, okay, I want my
3480.36s:  25 bucks back. I'm going to buy them back or sell them out so I can recoup the cost. So you do that.
3485.72s:  Then in that scenario, you got your money. Then in another scenario, you do something else.
3489.96s:  And then another scenario, you do something else. You now have no idea what actually works for
3496.04s:  the strategy as a whole over the long run. It's another really common mistake traders have is they
3503.24s:  get way way too wrapped up in the outcome of an individual trade and trying to maximize their profit
3510.52s:  in an individual trade. And it's a massive mistake. I cannot overemphasize hopefully based on
3516.12s:  how dramatic I'm talking, but I really do mean it. It's a massive, massive mistake.
3522.36s:  Cool. What else do we got? It's all deck. Huh? We already talked about this one. Let's talk about
3529.48s:  volatility. I think this is a new one. So we talked a bit about volatility last time and how it's
3536.60s:  kind of the big unknown with options. It's the one part that we're using to price options really.
3543.08s:  That's why a lot of times you'll hear season trader. They're not even talking about
3547.32s:  if I bought to open the 184 or something like that, you'll hear them say things like, oh, I bought
3552.60s:  31 vols. And it's because that's really what we're trading as option traders, whether or not you
3559.88s:  fully recognize it. So there are different kinds of volatility. I think we talked about some of
3567.08s:  this last time. Oh, sorry. Correct me if I'm wrong. But there's a bunch of different kinds of
3572.44s:  volatility, especially in the realized volatility side of space. You can have realized historic
3578.12s:  future realized. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. These are kind of the main
3581.88s:  volsilities for a new trader to be concerned within the beginning forecast implied statistical or
3587.72s:  historical. We normally would refer to it as hv historical volatility. I guess I can add that
3593.00s:  here and make it easier hv. Maybe there you go. Most of the time retail is not doing this,
3604.04s:  but this is what I was talking about before in terms of figuring out how to price these options.
3609.24s:  Most of the time retail is doing this where we're looking at a current option price. And because
3616.12s:  we know all the other variables, we can imply what the volatility is. That's why it's called
3621.56s:  implied volatility. We're essentially using the black sholes martin model. And that's a really
3626.68s:  easy way to derive volatility from current pricing. And then there's historical volatility. This is
3633.40s:  looking backwards in time. So if we look at iwm, you'll notice there's a bunch of different
3639.40s:  volsilities. Well, you might not, but there is. And I'll show them to you. We have different
3644.60s:  volsilities for each expiration. So these 19 July's have 20 vol, 20.8. These 18 June's have 17.9.
3657.48s:  Really important. No. Notice what happens in general as you go further out in time. What happens to
3663.72s:  the volatility? Does it get higher or lower as you go further out in time?
3677.64s:  I have to be honest, as I'm doing this, I'm drinking this lime spend drift and this one is not
3682.52s:  as good. I like the raspberry one way better. I am unable to proceed until somebody lets me know
3692.20s:  because otherwise I'll be confused for the rest of the session. If we go further out in time in
3698.84s:  general, this volatility increase or decrease. Loaf, you are our savior. The motive is flat.
3707.88s:  That's actually incorrect. It's a good guess, but it's actually incorrect. Dennis says it depends.
3713.08s:  That's actually the most correct answer if we're being honest. But in general, that is correct.
3721.00s:  Is the most accurate answer is it depends in the general sense. Loaf was right on the money.
3728.12s:  The reason why it increases in general and even though there's pockets where it goes up and down,
3733.40s:  if you were to plot a line of best fit, it still would go up. And the reason for that is think of it
3739.48s:  this way. How much the motive says, are we talking about the ticker on the screen? Sure. It doesn't
3745.08s:  matter. It's essentially universal. Even with something like GameStop that will have a bit of
3750.92s:  a different smile with this near term volatility than contracting down. As this near term
3756.20s:  vol bleeds out, this will eventually revert again, eventually. So this is I wouldn't use like
3764.76s:  anomalous circumstances as like the base of a theme or a thesis. Andre is also exactly correct.
3773.16s:  The reason why volatility gets higher as you go further out in time is because more shit can
3778.04s:  happen. That's really what it boils down to. Now on a relative basis, you can absolutely have periods
3784.28s:  where it's high here, lower here, high here, and you'll normally see that in shorter term time
3789.72s:  frames. But you can also see those kinds of pockets out here. This is relatively high. These 21.3s
3795.48s:  versus these 21.31s versus this 28.82, which is in the middle of those. And again, that's a
3801.24s:  tradable. This is a tradable thing right here. The vol for this expiration is much lower compared
3807.88s:  to its surrounding constituents. So you could absolutely trade the expansion of vol here against
3813.08s:  the contraction of vol here as a perished trade, or you could trade the expansion of vol here by
3817.80s:  itself. All of those are completely reasonable positions in this scenario. But that's the reason
3823.24s:  why in general, you'll see it increasing as you go further out in time, which is an important
3827.72s:  thing to know because then when you see things like this, this identifies an opportunity for us.
3834.28s:  It's different. We know it's different. Same thing here. 22.05 compared to 21.82. 21.91. Sometimes
3841.40s:  you'll see that change involved because there's a very good reason. There could be some sort of
3848.36s:  yep, Jay is Jay. My man, you are right on it, brother. That's exactly correct. Do these
3854.12s:  predictions account for events like elections earnings fed and based on DTE that is exactly correct.
3859.88s:  Kill it literally kill a job. It's exactly correct. So volatility is very smart and we can use it
3867.24s:  again to identify opportunities within the market. Sometimes there's a very good reason why the
3873.32s:  volatility will be different. Sometimes there might not be as good of a reason. But it still provides
3879.08s:  another relative value trade. So Jay, absolutely great job there. That's expiration volatility.
3886.52s:  Now if we go into the strike, you'll notice we also have implied volatility for every single strike.
3894.12s:  Each strike price gets its own vol. The other thing you'll notice is that if we look at the
3902.04s:  underlying itself, you'll see that there is implied volatility. The underlying itself also has
3908.76s:  its own vol. So there's these different measures of volatility across different places. It actually
3915.48s:  creates what we refer to as a volatility surface. And it's kind of like a 3D model. I don't want to
3920.68s:  do 3D with my hands, maybe something like that. And it has essentially volatility charted across
3928.28s:  different days to expiration across different strike prices. And it lets you visualize
3935.08s:  any areas that might be slightly elevated relative to others slightly lower. But volatility is very
3941.72s:  informative for us. So volatility is also something you can trade directly, which I actually think
3949.16s:  we spent quite a bit of time on actually. What did I just do that move this? Oh, I added, I was like,
3958.36s:  why is this now overlapping? It didn't be there. Now the other thing you can do is assess volatility
3966.20s:  relative to itself in individual products. And we looked at this last time. So I think we can
3970.60s:  brush over that point for here. This is looking at volatility a little more zoomed in. We talked
3977.80s:  about the Greeks last time. This I don't think I showed to you guys last time I added it in. I'm
3982.84s:  pretty sure afterwards. But this shows you the behavior of kind of some of the primary Greeks.
3989.80s:  I don't have row in here because it really doesn't matter that much. In how some of these Greeks
3994.60s:  behave with respect to things like strike price, delta and time. So a couple notes here really high
4001.80s:  level. For days to expiration, you'll notice that theta decay, then amount of extrinsic value kind of
4007.80s:  the inverse, how much decays out of extrinsic value. They didn't really start to accelerate as we
4014.36s:  close within 60 days. This is actually why I typically will buy options outside of 60 days.
4021.08s:  Now there's drawbacks to that. If you get a big move and you're at a low delta, you're not going
4027.56s:  to see as much of a move because of gamma. Gamma is higher as we get low. So let's take a look.
4037.24s:  If we take a look at gamma out here for an at the money option 30 days out, it's 0.3 gamma.
4045.40s:  And if we go four days out and we go to the same out of the money option, it's 0.11 much, much higher.
4051.88s:  Why is that the case? Because every single option that is coming up on expiration, which is perfect.
4057.80s:  We have an expiration here. Every single option has to make a choice. Either it's going to be in the
4062.92s:  money and have a delta of one or it's going to be out of the money and have a delta of zero.
4068.68s:  Gamma assesses the rate of change of delta. So as we get closer to expiration, gamma is going to get
4075.16s:  jacked up because all of these options have to make that choice. So delta is going to be approximating
4080.76s:  to either a one or a zero or in the money and out of the money respectively. So that's why
4087.88s:  it's slightly elevated, well, it gets steeply elevated as we get closer in time. So the punchline here
4096.92s:  is you have to spend some time getting familiar with the Greeks because it's not so much,
4102.04s:  the Greeks don't help you, the Greeks don't hurt you, the Greeks don't give a shit about you.
4107.56s:  But they help you inform, make an informed decision on what kind of position you're going to put on
4115.24s:  and what kind of risk-reward profile you want that position to have.
4120.20s:  That's exactly why understanding the Greeks is super, super important. There's no super power
4124.60s:  within the Greeks. It's not going to save you from losing a bunch of money if your strategy
4129.24s:  has no edge. The Greeks are not going to do any of that for you. People I think have this really
4133.56s:  weird perception of the Greeks and it's not like the Greek gods. They're just the Greeks. And
4139.40s:  fun fact actually some of these aren't even actually Greek. We just call them the Greeks.
4145.24s:  Anyways, if you have any questions on these, let me know because this kind of stuff is actually
4149.56s:  really important, but it's something that you have to spend some time looking at. One of the
4153.64s:  recommendations I would have for you is to go through an options chain and open up an Excel sheet
4160.84s:  and literally take a look at at least delta gamma theta Vega and look at them across
4173.32s:  four different explorations. That's plenty. That will give you a pretty good idea of how they
4177.64s:  behave and it will become very informative to you. So I think that's a really, really good exercise
4183.48s:  to go through. This already showed to you guys. Okay, so this I think I added this is a ton
4191.56s:  of different option structures and a quick recap of what they are. I think I showed you guys these
4197.16s:  already, but then did I show you guys these? I might have, but then I also add the P and all
4205.64s:  graph for them. So I'll kind of flip through the, oh, it's Africa. This is a video. I'm so stupid
4210.04s:  sometimes I was going to say I'll flip through kind of slow so you can take a screenshot, but
4213.72s:  newsflash. This is a video so you literally can go back at any point in time. I'm not going to
4217.40s:  linger on any of these for too long unless there's one that you're interested in. We learned about
4221.16s:  long calls before, which is essentially we want something to go up. Now as we saw before, you don't
4228.36s:  actually need it to go up to your long strike. Super, super important. You just need to go up
4237.00s:  for a short call. You want something to go down. And essentially you have a little bit of extra
4244.44s:  room on a short call. Now this is also one of the reasons why I highly, yeah, you can see it.
4251.48s:  I highly recommend that book options as a strategic investment because it breaks down all of these
4257.40s:  and I'm sure you can get it from investor pdia as well. Like what the break evens are and stuff
4261.56s:  like that. It's all good to know. But across all of them, let's just use these calls and puts or
4267.16s:  calls for an example real quick. Let's buy this one. We can get rid of all these other sample
4274.12s:  trades. And then let's sell this one as well. And then we'll take a look at some different scenarios.
4283.24s:  The first thing. Notice these two different lines. It's important to understand the difference
4289.08s:  between these. This purple line is today. The blue line is at expiration. Very important to
4296.52s:  differentiate these. The reason why it's so important to differentiate is because options decay
4303.00s:  over time. So as time passes, this purple line will approximate to the blue line.
4310.36s:  So let's say for example, we get a really small move and let's say IWM goes up to 253.
4317.24s:  In that here, you would make $112. But if it doesn't move again and it stays there and you continue
4324.36s:  to hold it, this purple line would approximate to this blue line. So actually your profit would
4329.88s:  then decay away into nothing. And you would have a losing position at this point.
4335.32s:  The notice says, where can I find the Greek behavior charts need a poster for my wall? Yeah.
4341.08s:  You can grab a screenshot from that one I flashed up earlier. For the Patreon members,
4346.52s:  give them that one that I made in Excel. Or I think it's a Google sheet just so that they can
4351.24s:  have as a reference. But yeah, I mean, I think this is the way to live your life. Just let everybody
4357.00s:  know that you worship the Greeks. Oh yeah, the other thing I want to highlight though is when we're
4367.56s:  buying single options and it doesn't really matter if it's single, it's just kind of easier to start
4371.80s:  with singles. When you're buying a call, your break even price is your strike price plus the
4381.32s:  premium you pay. When you buy a put, it's strike less break even price. The reason being is you
4388.60s:  have to think of it moving in the direction that you want. Now,
4393.80s:  a notice says meant the four visuals. Oh, I already told you dog, that's for you to make.
4398.52s:  There's a reason why I don't give you guys every component out there. It's because I cannot
4406.52s:  over emphasize how valuable I think going through the exercises are. So for you, Samota, if you want
4413.56s:  to use a screenshot as like a reference, that's completely cool, completely cool. But you should make
4418.52s:  your own. Like you absolutely should make your own. It's an annoying process. But this is the world
4425.16s:  of trading. If doing stuff like this is super off-putting, trading is not going to be a good fit
4430.60s:  because it's a lot of small little due diligence work like this. And what I can promise you is if you
4436.04s:  go through that exercise, you will have a much, much deeper relationship with those Greeks. Then if you
4442.28s:  just grab a screenshot from somewhere else and print it out, hands down, I guarantee it.
4447.40s:  So anyways, back to this. If we take a look at the 199 calls and the strike price here, actually,
4460.52s:  let's pick something that's further out of the money for the example. Let's say you picked the 210s.
4464.92s:  I'm going to unlock this price. So right now in this scenario, IWM is trading for 198 Fiddy.
4473.48s:  And our strike price on the calls 210. I already told you it doesn't need to go to your strike
4479.16s:  price in order to make money. The 210 strike is right here. At 210, you would be making money for
4484.84s:  sure. But notice that you actually start making money as soon as it starts moving in your direction.
4489.88s:  So it can go from 198 Fiddy to 200 and you're up 33 bucks. Now you are fighting theta decay.
4498.60s:  As time passes, this purple line is going to approximate to the blue line, but you're up money already.
4503.40s:  It's just another common really common misconception for long options. You don't need the
4507.56s:  underlying to go to your strike. That's just the ideal scenario actually to go above your strike or
4512.44s:  below your strike if it's a long put. But it doesn't have to get there in order for you to make money.
4516.60s:  You can remember, you can always trade the option. Now if we take a look at short options,
4522.04s:  this one for an example is a short call. Your break even is slightly different because you collect
4530.44s:  money upfront. So because we collect that credit when we sell to open, you actually have a little
4536.60s:  bit of a buffer in your position. So in this case, we're short the 199 call. That means we want
4543.08s:  IWM. Oh man, I just realized what I did. We can't use IWM for this. I'm not saying you're trying
4548.04s:  to talk about shorting IWM. Let's use hood. Fuck Robin Hood. Yeah, this is better. This is
4555.48s:  better for everybody, I think. I can't believe you guys were about to let me commit sacrilege there.
4560.20s:  That was about to be pretty messed up. All right. So now that we're fading Robin Hood, which is
4567.48s:  completely okay and always on the table. Look at this falling down from that cliff. Die. I hope it
4573.40s:  crashes. And we're short now the 22 call, which is right here. Right now Robin Hood somehow
4582.52s:  magically is above 22 and it's at 2243. We actually want it below this, but notice where our break
4589.80s:  even is all we out here at 2288. So in this case, it is really, really important when you are selling
4600.68s:  credits, you have the benefit of receiving a small buffer. If you're buying things, you need things
4607.72s:  to move enough to cover the cost of whatever you paid in the direction you want. That's quite literally
4613.88s:  the easiest way to think about break even calculations. If you're selling things, you get a pad
4621.08s:  against the direction you don't want it to go. So again, if we're selling a call, we want this to
4625.96s:  go down. Of course, it's Robin Hood. We always want it to go down. But if it doesn't go down,
4632.28s:  you still get a pad equivalent to the credit you received. So in this case, it can go against you,
4637.96s:  meaning up, God forbid, for Robin Hood, you can go up all the way to 2288 and you would still be at
4645.56s:  your break even. But again, this is at expiration. So your option would be showing a loss until it
4654.44s:  gets closer to expiration. So if you take a look in this bottom left corner over here, you'll see the
4659.40s:  two different dates and then you'll see the two different prices. So let's say Robin Hood rallied
4665.24s:  and it goes up to again, 2288. If you held that all the way to expiration, it would be break even.
4672.60s:  But until then, it would first show a loss of down 3246 and then as time passes, again, this purple
4681.40s:  line approximates to the blue line. So Moda says, do I need to understand calculations?
4687.88s:  Yeah, I think you do for these. These are fundamental enough that it's important to know. And again,
4693.40s:  it's quite literally as simple as I kind of outlined it before. If you're entering a trade via a
4701.32s:  debit or verticals and stuff like that, you need something to move in your favor plus the debit.
4708.68s:  If you've sold an option, you get a buffer against you strike with the premium, whether it's a
4716.36s:  caller put depends on whether you add or sell it. That's the way I think about it. For other
4721.16s:  strategies like butterflies and stuff like that, it's different, right? Because they have completely
4724.92s:  different risk profiles, which you'll see in a second. But for the directional stuff that will
4730.84s:  essentially carry you through pretty carefully. So these are now long puts, short puts. This is
4743.48s:  incorrect.
4746.04s:  Elite. So if we take a look at a short put, just to just to get us right, let me go here to spy.
4757.16s:  And let's take a peek at like this 30 delta short put and a live trade.
4763.08s:  So a short put is a bullish trade. I think I probably just forgot to swap it out.
4768.68s:  So I'll add this one in for us now.
4772.44s:  So the short put, we want it to go up. And I think in this scenario, I probably just forgot to
4778.68s:  switch it. But here you go.
4781.32s:  Long put, we want stuff to go down. Short put, we want it to go up.
4789.00s:  Calculating the break evens is the same process for the calls. Long put, you needed to go
4795.24s:  in your direction plus the W paid at expiration or put you get a buffer if it moves against you,
4801.16s:  which would be down. Any questions on these single options to start? Long calls,
4811.16s:  short calls, long puts, short puts. And while you're ruminating on that,
4815.80s:  I'm just going to let the dog out super fast.
4826.44s:  He was very excited to see what movements were going on out there.
4833.80s:  So notice says I meant calculus in order to make the four visuals on the green charts.
4838.36s:  No, no, no, no, no. So that calculus that you're referring to that literally just helps you
4843.96s:  understand the way that the Greeks behave. But think about, think about what you're doing, right?
4850.60s:  Think about the process I'm kind of somewhat forcing you to do, I guess.
4857.16s:  Is if we take a look at spy and let's say that you come into again, those three or four
4863.24s:  explorations, let's say that you go out a week and you got to 21 June.
4869.08s:  And you literally just create a Google sheet with these columns, delta, gamma, theta, Vega,
4876.36s:  and just pick a handful of strikes, pick like a 50 delta, 75 delta, a one delta, same thing to
4882.36s:  the other direction. And then just write the numbers down. That's it. And then literally you
4886.52s:  can plot them, right? Because you're inputting the data directly from the the options chain.
4894.12s:  Andrei says, how do you make a long put to short the stock?
4901.00s:  So Moda says, okay, I thought the variance would screw it up. Oh, it definitely will. You need to
4905.32s:  try to, you need to normalize to some sort of, you need to normalize to something. So like,
4911.96s:  you can anchor off of delta. That's a really easy anchor point. So then you can reference everything
4917.56s:  relative to delta. That's why those charts have slightly different configurations. Because if it's
4925.96s:  isolated off of delta, off of time, there's difference between those. Andrei says, how do you make a
4931.80s:  long put to short the stock? Yeah, great question. So if I want to buy a put to trade something to
4937.32s:  the downside, kind of similar rules I follow as compared to buying options, buying options is simple.
4943.56s:  I normally will go beyond 60 days, at least. If it's a shorter term thesis, you can creep it in a
4948.60s:  little bit. But again, if you remember actually that graph that we're kind of referring to right now,
4954.36s:  you don't want to creep it in too far. Because then you're going to start losing theta to case
4958.20s:  super, super fast. So maybe we go out to this 63 16 August. And the delta selection is literally
4965.48s:  the same process with respect to if we go in the money at a higher delta out of the money.
4970.76s:  That's all completely predicated on how big of a move we think we're going to get.
4974.36s:  So let's say that we go kind of right at the money, something like this, the 545s. So in this case,
4980.76s:  literally you can hit buyer sell. It kind of doesn't matter. It just changes the interface when it pops
4985.64s:  up. But in this case, you can hit buy. I always would go for the midpoint, at least to start. So it's
4992.12s:  a slightly more favorable price to you. And then you launch that order. Now you would essentially have
4997.48s:  a position with this risk profile. You would want it to go down. And you need to have risk management
5005.48s:  in place for the strategy. So whatever risk management, you tend to apply to stuff like this for
5011.00s:  directional trading for me personally. It's generally predicated off of some sort of technical
5015.48s:  analysis. So let's say using spy. Let's say I wanted to fade this to the downside, which I probably
5021.88s:  wouldn't hear. But let's say I did, then I would essentially set some sort of stop on the chart that
5027.64s:  makes sense based on the way that I'm analyzing the chart. And if it hits that stop, I would use that
5033.40s:  as my point to enter the trade or exit the trade. Sorry. But that's essentially a cliff notes version
5040.52s:  on how to open a long put to trade a stock to the downside.
5047.24s:  And let's get back to this. So single options. These are vertical spreads. I don't trade them too
5055.24s:  much, but there's nothing wrong with them for a newer trader. It's just nothing that I would want to
5058.52s:  get stuck on for too long. They're difficult to make money on. But you'll notice that they have
5063.56s:  this similar profit zone as its single option counterpart. So long call spread versus a long call.
5070.68s:  But it adds a leg to define the risk. So it also decreases the amount of capital that you need.
5077.88s:  Andre says, if you're scalping, would you go one week out? No. And again, scalping is really important
5082.84s:  to define because retail traders typically don't scalp algoes or scalping, meaning moving super,
5087.88s:  super fast retail traders, typically or day trading, but going with the colloquial use of scalping,
5093.64s:  totally cool. But if I'm trading something intraday, I'm not going to go out a week. That's way too
5098.20s:  long. I might, and if it's not something I'm planning on holding for multiple days, I might
5101.96s:  literally trade that same day. But I rarely will try to scalp options. I will have intraday trades.
5108.68s:  But I think people think scalping is a lower risk, higher probability way of making trades. But
5114.44s:  realistically, it's just a way for retail traders to more or less get screwed over because you're
5119.72s:  transacting so frequently in such a high friction environment, meaning it's very expensive for
5124.76s:  retail to trade more so than you probably realize that it's very difficult to make a bunch of money
5129.64s:  that way. So it's not my go-to personally. There might be another, again, that's me, right? So
5135.40s:  there might be other entities that are super, super successful doing that. And I would probably tap
5140.76s:  into them a little bit more so than me. It's just very different than what I do. I trade every day
5145.64s:  and I trade things intraday. But that's not my primary go-to at all. But verticals kind of same thing
5153.64s:  to the downside. These are straddles and strangles. So the way to think about straddles and strangles,
5159.48s:  they're more specific to attempting to trade volatility. So what we want to see is different
5166.52s:  expressions of volatility specifically for straddles, which is if we're long as straddle, as you
5172.12s:  can tell, we don't care which way it moves. We just want it to move in a direction, not chop around
5178.84s:  right in the middle and not go anywhere. So this is a volatility play and expansion. Because
5183.96s:  remember, volatility is just an expression of movement. How much does something move? It's variants
5189.16s:  that's time bound. For a short straddle, as you can imagine, it's the exact inverse. We want
5195.24s:  something to stay within a range. In this scenario, we are betting that volatility implied will be
5203.00s:  higher than realized volatility. Meaning it won't move as much.
5207.72s:  And then strangles are essentially the same, slightly different structure. As you can tell,
5213.00s:  it's less of a pinpoint and it kind of has this tabletop surface to it. That's because rather than
5218.60s:  going at the money for both strikes, you're now going to out of the money.
5224.92s:  The
5227.16s:  motor says if you express the straddle in a way other than
5231.32s:  BTO put and call, do you still call it a straddle? Could you give me an example of what you mean?
5240.28s:  Because you can have a long straddle or a short straddle. Long straddle is if you buy the
5245.24s:  at the money same strike put and call. The short straddle is if you sell the at the money same strike
5252.92s:  put and call. Technically, you could do it at a different strike, but it's most often done at the money.
5261.24s:  Let me know if that answers if you have a different question there.
5268.76s:  So the way to think about long straddles, long strangles is you want something to move.
5275.48s:  And then short straddles, short strangles, you want something to stay relatively put.
5280.44s:  Now, these are essentially the risk-defined versions of straddles and strangles. Just like I showed you
5288.60s:  long call, long put, short call, short put, and then vertical spreads. It's kind of the same thing
5294.04s:  that I'm doing here. So this is adding legs to straddles and strangles when we go to iron butterflies
5300.92s:  and iron condors. The names are terrible. They're all supernabulous. You get a feel for them over time.
5308.44s:  That's why I put it in like a little chart here to make it easier to understand.
5312.12s:  But as you can see for something like a butterfly, again, you just want it to move.
5317.08s:  And for a short iron butterfly, you just don't want it to move. This is a straddle that has wings
5323.16s:  purchased. And then if you look at an iron condor, it's the same thing. You just want the thing to
5328.92s:  move either direction, but it will have defined risk as well these. For the short iron condor, you just
5336.76s:  want it to stay put within a range. But you're buying the wings.
5342.28s:  And then these are kind of my personal strategies. These are my go-to's. So the vast majority of
5347.56s:  the time I'm trading, it is something from here. The overwhelming majority of what I do is in
5354.20s:  here. So I add the payoff diagrams for all of these so that you have a sense of how these work.
5360.92s:  So, notice says long shares at a profit by puts at a strike above your basis, above your share count,
5373.72s:  at a quantity above your share count. In 700 shares at 20,
5384.20s:  I'm super confused. That just looks like a protective put.
5388.76s:  But if your long shares in buying a put, it's just a protective put. That's not a straddle.
5398.92s:  Yeah, what you're showing there is a type of protective put.
5405.48s:  And then the motive says, but it's uncapped downside. Yeah, it doesn't mean that your hedge
5412.60s:  one to one. So if you're saying that you're buying the put above your share count, I mean, let's look at
5418.28s:  an example. So if we take a look at what did you say your long 700 shares. So we buy 700.
5428.68s:  Get red.
5431.72s:  Lies. Get red. Get red.
5436.20s:  And then you bought something that was like
5449.24s:  $20 on a line. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. It looks the same one model. Yeah, definitely.
5454.92s:  So the reason why it looks the same is because they're essentially synthetics, depending on what
5460.04s:  Delta it is, right? A long call is going to look just like long shares. So if I grab this 50 delta
5466.04s:  long call and we add it, it's synthetically the same thing. The difference is it will have
5474.76s:  cap downside because it's a long call, but it'll have the same overall slope as long shares.
5482.04s:  Now if you're adding short puts, then it becomes synthetically the same thing.
5487.00s:  Okay, call it a synthetic straddle. No, no, no, no, I wouldn't call it a synthetic straddle at all.
5490.52s:  It's not a synthetic straddle. I literally just call it a, it's a just protective put.
5496.20s:  So even though in your scenario, you still have downside risk, it will decrease your downside risk.
5503.08s:  So in your example, you had something you're saying the $20 underlying was at 25.
5509.24s:  So in this example, we would have already bought spy, which is trading at 2542. Let's say we got it
5515.88s:  cheaper to follow along with your scenario and we're in the profit. So let's say instead of
5521.80s:  getting it at 542, we got it at 535. Like that. And then you're saying we bought to open 10
5532.20s:  of the at the money puts. So which would be the current price. So these,
5537.56s:  they'll buy these and we'll buy 10. And we take a look. So in this case,
5549.40s:  you're essentially creating a position that you have a really small risk here, but the reason
5555.96s:  why it's a protective put is because it's taking the risk off of your long shares. So if this goes
5562.20s:  down in this scenario because you're, you're adding more puts, you actually have profit potential
5568.68s:  if it goes in your direction. But the overall premise behind these puts is you could call it a
5574.20s:  married put. If you don't like the term protective put, that's also fine. But yeah, it's literally
5578.84s:  just long stock long put is the easiest way to think about it.
5586.92s:  Yeah.
5588.20s:  And when it says my long position is at profit and put strike is at profit. So line starts above zero.
5593.56s:  Yeah, that's totally cool. It's and that's kind of the idea behind a protective put, right?
5598.60s:  Is you're trying to protect the value of your shares. Now the downside to this kind of position,
5605.08s:  it well, it all depends on your management. I don't want to get super far down the rabbit hole.
5609.32s:  But it's not riskless inherently unless you're trading it as one position. That's important to
5616.04s:  so if you're going to keep your shares and not use like, let's say, for example, just
5621.32s:  let's say this moves to here and it falls down to five 23. If you don't move the entire position,
5629.24s:  what would happen is on your puts, they would be in the profit you would make money. Now the
5634.44s:  inverse would happen if it goes up. So let's say it goes up to five 60 and you still want to keep
5639.48s:  your shares. It goes up to five 60 and you don't sell your shares. You're eating that entire loss
5645.72s:  on your long puts. So there's nothing wrong with that kind of strategy, but it's really important
5650.52s:  to be thoughtful about how you choose to manage it because you can start building stupid losses
5655.40s:  that aren't being offset by realized positions. Andre says, how long would you keep a protective put
5662.28s:  on? I personally wouldn't use protective puts. So the way you would kind of think about that,
5670.44s:  though, is for the duration of the risk you're trying to cover. One of the biggest issues retail
5677.08s:  traders can have is becoming too adverse to risk in trying to hedge all of it away.
5683.88s:  If you hedge too much risk away, you are literally hedging your profit opportunity away at the same
5689.32s:  time. You're decreasing your profit massively. So I much prefer to size trades and decrease
5696.68s:  risk via sizing and then via trade management as compared to structurally decreasing it by adding
5703.00s:  more legs to it. It just decreases the overall profitability of the strategy in the long run
5708.68s:  and you're adding more legs. So again, back to that cost thing. That's a little bit nefarious.
5715.96s:  So personally, I wouldn't run them with them on. But if you wanted to for some reason, like
5722.04s:  that's totally fine. But you have to define how much of your upside or total profitability you're
5727.72s:  willing to sacrifice for that and then how long you need the protection on the longer the protection
5733.32s:  is on the more expensive it is. This is just about how I think about managing a portfolio.
5741.32s:  And I kind of use this top down approach. This is probably a good, oh no, we're like essentially
5746.12s:  done with this thing. Yeah, okay, cool. So I think we just wrap us up. We only have a few left.
5753.72s:  So the way I think about managing a portfolio is starting with literally a really broad perspective
5759.64s:  and then narrowing it down and making sure that my portfolio fits how I think about the stock market
5765.64s:  as it sits now and literally how that fits against the economy as it sits now. And then the individual
5772.68s:  positions I put on need to make sense in the context of all of that proceeding information.
5779.08s:  So I split my portfolio into two different allocations. I have a core allocation and then I have
5784.76s:  a speculative allocation. The purpose of the core allocation is that's really where I'm trying to
5790.04s:  generate my annual returns. The speculative allocation is kind of where I'm looking to I take
5795.88s:  advantage of opportunities. Not quite as discreet as that. Right now, a lot of my capital is tied up
5802.28s:  in my speculative allocation that is driving returns. That's because sometimes some years,
5808.44s:  the core allocation will be performing more slowly. So because of that, I rotate more capital and I
5814.92s:  look more intensively for speculative opportunity. A couple other things I want to highlight from here
5823.16s:  specifically are these two. And I already talked about this one. It's vital to create an approach that
5828.92s:  aligns with you as a trader worth reiterating. This one, I cannot overemphasize enough either.
5834.60s:  Blanket rules in trading generally are stupid, which is kind of funny because that's a blanket rule.
5841.32s:  Take profits. That's not a good answer. Never risk more than blank percent of your capital in one
5848.84s:  trade. That's also not a good answer. The reason why it's not a good answer is because everything
5854.60s:  you're doing within your strategies needs to make sense when we're analyzing the expected return,
5862.36s:  the expected performance of that strategy over a specific time frame. So if I look up,
5868.28s:  I'm going to grab a video for you guys that walks through expected return way more in depth there
5873.96s:  that you could take a look. But the whole idea here is it can't be oh yeah, I'm just going to take
5880.44s:  profits. I don't want to keep that risk out. And then if you run a portfolio like that, you will
5885.72s:  find it's too inconsistent to actually make money long term because you are so set in your own
5892.36s:  discretion that sometimes you will make decisions differently in different time frames. And then
5899.00s:  you can't model that long term. So this long term modeling is super, super important. And I'll share
5907.00s:  another couple of videos. This one is a new one that I actually think is kind of important for people.
5912.44s:  And that one is how to create a consistently profitable trading strategy. And it walks through
5917.40s:  essentially this process way more in depth. But I think that that is worth the conversation.
5928.04s:  Someone says no correlation between risk and position size. Your risk of losing one dollar on a
5933.64s:  billion dollar tips position is smaller than your risk of losing one dollar holding one share of
5942.76s:  Jimmy. Again, I get your point, but it's that's like it's trying to find an example that refutes
5952.12s:  the concept because even in your tips position, there is risk. Now to your point, the relative risk
5959.40s:  there is different, but you can't have a unilateral view of risk. There's opportunity cost.
5965.80s:  That is a risk to the returns of your portfolio. So I get your point and I follow you, but I wouldn't
5973.80s:  try to essentially just find things like that to have a talking point. There absolutely is a
5980.36s:  correlation between risk and position size. Again, there are scenarios where it could not be on a
5986.84s:  relative basis. But even that one billion dollar tips position still has risk. And it has a billion
5994.60s:  dollars in some sort of commensurate risk compared to the one dollar in GME. So I agree with you,
6001.96s:  I understand the point that you're trying to make there. But they're to essentially say something
6009.08s:  like there's no correlation between risk and position size is not super logical. Because if we
6016.76s:  look at now as comparing two different strategies and we actually compare what we're talking about,
6023.24s:  risk and position size, not relative risk based on beta, but risk and position size. If I buy
6033.24s:  700 shares of spy versus five 300 shares of spy, same trade, same position, same product,
6043.08s:  position size is a direct correlation on risk.
6047.00s:  So it's actually really important to not get too wrapped up. So I've noticed that she's
6052.12s:  sharing the same product, of course. Well, of course, that's when we're making comparisons like
6056.92s:  that are saying about correlations, you have to control for those things, right? That's the
6062.20s:  entire point of identifying correlations is you're isolating something and then assessing something
6069.16s:  else to determine what that behavior is. Again, to your point, I agree with you. Different products
6076.20s:  can have different relative risk. Like if we were to chart the risk, if you were to put a thousand
6082.68s:  dollars in GameStop versus a thousand dollars in spy, very different risk profiles. But that doesn't
6090.44s:  remove the size component to the equation. It's still absolutely a component.
6096.92s:  Jay says, is there a way to quantify the probability of success for a strategy position? It's a
6100.68s:  great question. Jay, you are on this, man. I love your questions. So definitely. And some of it
6107.72s:  will depend on your strategy. And let's use a couple examples. Let's say I'm trading in video.
6116.20s:  And look at that candle. And let's say I think Nvidia is going to go up. Well, let's say you first
6123.00s:  would need to say, okay, I think it's going to go up for whatever reason. Let's say you're doing
6127.24s:  a momentum following strategy or a breakout strategy. Let's say that you're using this most
6132.12s:  recent 125 55 handle as resistance. And let's say that you were using this breakout day to enter.
6138.84s:  So you got in now at 128, 129, whatever. And it's starting to drift up. So you then have to make
6145.80s:  some assumptions about where you think this might go relative to where you where you entered.
6150.92s:  A lot of times it's easier to use like a really long term reference. If there is one,
6156.04s:  if there's not one, then you kind of have to come up with your own an easy way to do that to
6160.60s:  determine how far do I think this is going to go is you can use options for this. So if we go to
6167.08s:  this, you can then model where you think Nvidia might go with a different confidence interval
6175.08s:  based on different time frames. So this is exactly how you can say, all right, if I think Nvidia is
6181.08s:  going to go up, what's the probability that it goes up within 40 days? The probability and let's
6186.92s:  do a touch because we don't care if it stays in the money. The probability of it touching, let's say
6192.84s:  142 is 57%. There's your probability of hitting 146. So you can use options again, even to inform
6202.12s:  directional targets. So that's essentially the system that I would run for directional trades to
6207.72s:  start. That's a very simple one for options. It's kind of baked into the option. So if you're selling
6213.00s:  an option, let's say that you think Nvidia instead is going to go down and you want to sell calls.
6217.72s:  Well, you can come out here to the 30 delta and you could say, okay, the probability of these 30
6222.76s:  delta calls getting touched is 47.13%. The probability of them being in the money is 22.8%. Well,
6229.24s:  if you're going to apply early management based on them being touched, you obviously need to use
6233.56s:  this 40% 47% number. Not if it doesn't expire in the money, which right now is 22.8%.
6241.48s:  But let's say instead your approach is going to be to not do anything until it goes all the way
6248.04s:  to expiration. Well, then you can use the 22.8% understanding that they're likely will be a period
6253.80s:  that they would be underwater, almost to the tune of 50%, not quite 50%, but pretty close.
6260.04s:  So yeah, you should be able to quantify essentially the way that you're setting all of these different.
6267.72s:  Jay says, would you use that information to inform your allocation? How much are we
6270.92s:  willing to risk in the position to keep your relative to your available cash? Another great question.
6275.56s:  That's based more on portfolio management and actually that video that I shared above
6281.16s:  about building a strategy will go directly into capital management on that. But that's another great
6287.00s:  question. Essentially, the way I think about what gets money in my account is based on what the
6295.16s:  portfolio needs. I take again, not a position first approach. I take a portfolio overhead approach.
6302.68s:  So sometimes I need long deltas, even if I have super high conviction in something, if I don't
6307.08s:  need a bunch of long deltas, I'm not going to oversized my long deltas, that kind of thing. And
6311.72s:  that's using something called beta weighted deltas, which I will share with you here.
6320.68s:  Which helps a lot with subsequent sizing.
6326.44s:  All right, you all. Man, hour 45 minutes in on a Friday. Thank you guys for hanging out. I have
6332.28s:  a blast talking about this stuff. It is time for me to go. However, please like, subscribe, share.
6337.40s:  It does help the channel grow. And I'm looking to do that as best as I can, connect more people together.
6341.96s:  And we will have another beginner workshop next week. It'll probably a little bit more shorter.
6346.52s:  I think I'm going to go a little more Q&A on that one since we got through a lot of the core content.
6351.88s:  So in the meantime, think of your questions. What kind of stuff do you want to dig into on the
6356.28s:  next session? I think it would make sense to start thinking about analyzing kind of that profit.
6362.76s:  Let me see. Do I still have this up for you? Yeah, I do. The way I think your next steps would
6368.12s:  look like is this right here. I think we should start talking about this next week.
6374.36s:  So take a look at how you intend to do this. And I think we should have some questions to talk
6380.92s:  about next week on that. As always, feel free to join the discord. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys
6388.44s:  later.
