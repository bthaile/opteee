0.00s: What's up outliers? I forgot we're over here now. Gotta get the right spot. So I'm using
8.00s: my little crappy camera. It's actually not a crappy camera. I just can't get it to look
11.76s: even remotely good, but I don't think there's anything looking good with me in it. Anyways,
15.64s: so none of it ultimately matters. But I'm using this one since the sessions tend to go
21.12s: a little bit longer for this one, because I want to give you guys as much time as I can.
25.40s: I want to be able to sit and stand and then sit again and then probably stand again
29.92s: several times. I try to typically move like every 15 minutes. I don't like sitting all
33.92s: day. But for whoever is in here, please first say hello in the chat so I can say hello
39.64s: back. And then if there's anything in particular that you want to hit, just let me know.
43.80s: We can slot it in as we go through kind of the standard agenda that I have built for
49.16s: us. Or we can hit it at the end depending on the question and what makes sense for the
53.96s: question that whole bit. It looks like we got Paulo, Samota, Jay and Chaser, good to
61.24s: see all of you. And Paul's asking what kind of breed a dog. It is a multi-sputtle. Give
67.56s: me one sec.
73.08s: He ain't doing a whole lot. We might have to change because he's very, let's see. Does
78.84s: he come through? Yeah, he's right there. He's kind of just like a big, big ball of
83.00s: loop. He can't see too many eyes that he does have eyes. See if I pull his head. He's not
89.80s: super into being disrupted during the sleep in sessions. He's in charging mode. What up, my boy.
96.28s: A nice little nose lick. But he actually doesn't know that much about options. So we will retire him
103.96s: to back to his post. And I'm sure he will just crawl back and go to bed. That is essentially
112.20s: how he gets down. All right. Back at it. Obviously, game stops up. But we don't have to talk about
119.80s: game stop. I know I've been on game stop for essentially the past week. When you trade options
127.24s: as much as I do in your end markets as long as I am, it's not super common that you come across
133.16s: super, super fascinating things like this because it has all the elements of a crazy story.
139.08s: So I can't get enough of it. But enough of that. Let me move over. And again,
147.56s: this is going to be as interactive as possible. I use this as a framework. Right. So I'm not giving
153.40s: you a freaking PowerPoint presentation. I have zero interest in doing that.
159.80s: Reggie says lies. I saw him reading options as a strategic investment. He probably could read it
163.88s: better than me. I bet. I would not. I would not be surprised. We also got no you. That's hilarious.
169.32s: That reminds me. We have another person named don't ask. Oh my god. We got to like get you guys.
175.00s: You ever see those phone calls where people do a prank call between like two different
178.84s: pizza places or Chinese restaurants and then like turn the phones so that they essentially try to
183.88s: order from one another and it's a hilarious battle. I feel like don't ask and know you would be
189.24s: perfect together in that sense. All right. What I'm going to do now is flip through the vast
197.16s: majority of this. We covered a lot of this in the last session and also be completely straight
204.20s: up with you guys. I don't know where we left off. So you will have to coach me a little bit. I will
208.84s: share the link for the last session in the notes here. There you are. That is the last workshop
215.80s: we've done. And then the other thing somebody asked me for is kind of some ideas for homework,
222.04s: which is a great question. And especially for this group, the beginner level, I am throwing in
227.80s: a playlist there that is kind of like an options intro playlist. Now a couple notes. Some of the
233.16s: videos in there are super old. You will get a pretty hilarious look at old Eric in production
238.84s: quality, which hasn't gotten much better, especially with this camera. But it's still generally
244.04s: solid information. So it's a good spot to start. I have a new beginner video coming out and like
249.08s: I don't even know how long at this point. We're so backed up with the videos I'm trying to get out.
252.68s: I don't want to do two weeks. I feel like that's too much, although I did one like every day this week.
256.92s: So who knows, man, literally who knows what's going on out here. All right. Let's start actually
264.28s: with a question. And I like this question. And the other part beyond the question I'm not
269.32s: even going to lie with you is the fact that I want this, I want to close this window because I have
273.24s: too many windows open. So this is a way for me to answer the one eyed fat man and to close this
279.40s: window out. And it's a great question. So essentially they said in regards to where I think I'm at,
284.76s: they have you and Sinclair on one shoulder saying, don't be a pussy put on a damn trade, which is
289.80s: literally great. And then it says, then I have me on my other shoulder saying, when there's no
296.04s: trade, don't trade. And I think this is a fair spot to be at for a lot of traders. The easy way
302.60s: I would look at this personally, I genuinely believe there's always a trade. I genuinely believe
309.32s: that. Now, if you trade a system that is very specific on set criteria and there's genuinely not
317.08s: always a trade for you, that's okay. Then I think this advice is fine. If there's no trade,
322.52s: don't trade. But for me as a trader, one of my goals in developing my toolkit that I reference
328.12s: all the time is to almost always be able to find a trade. There's not a great reason not to be
332.84s: able to find a trade in my opinion other than a very niche skill set, which again, that can be a
337.56s: completely viable system for people, especially for like very specific canceling breakout style traders.
344.28s: You'll come across that exact kind of scenario. But to me, if you're running into that scenario too
350.76s: often when there's no trade, don't trade to me. That means we need to broaden the skill set a
354.04s: little bit. And the other thing is to just put on a damn trade. It's good advice. And there's
358.60s: nothing wrong with just putting on a small trade. If as long as you have a solid system behind it,
364.60s: and even if it's not fully fleshed out, as long as you're very careful about managing your risk,
370.04s: you're not going to hurt yourself. So for example, if you're trying to do some sort of breakout
373.56s: momentum following strategy and you buy a call, your risk is defined on the onset. So you literally
379.88s: could go into that trade under the assumption of, I'm going to lose this $200 I used to buy this call.
386.60s: You're not going to die. Like that's okay. But the main point is I don't actually think getting stuck
392.76s: in this gridlock is super logical. And I think it stems from either not being willing to
399.00s: size down enough to be able to be comfortable putting on the trade or not having a diverse enough
404.04s: skill set. That's my take. Let's see, not sure if this would be a place I should pass
409.96s: around the way up the ladder. If this is where I should live, nope, should not live there.
413.24s: I guess I'm looking for a home-based daily routine to anchor everything. I think this is okay.
418.36s: But I think over emphasizing kind of like comfort and in markets, it works and it doesn't work.
426.12s: What I mean by that is you have to get comfortable working in uncomfortable conditions. One of the
430.52s: uncomfortable conditions of markets is the fact that there is always going to be ambiguity.
437.08s: You will never know what certainty at any point what's going to happen. So getting used to
442.44s: operating in conditions like that. One of the big things I think that's worth mentioning to people
447.08s: is getting way more comfortable looking at markets as probabilistic scenarios and decreasing
453.56s: kind of the self-reflection and assessment of being wrong. Those are probably the most common themes
459.08s: I see for traders that are too fearful to put on positions. Is they're terrified of being wrong?
464.52s: And to me, again, that's one of the beautiful things about being like an idiot like I am.
469.56s: I'm wrong literally all the time and I don't care. It's fine. I understand that in this world,
477.08s: you're going to be wrong all the time. And if you use that and that scares you so much from
482.52s: taking steps, guess what? You're never going to get better at something. So in my scenario,
487.96s: I think having a routine is great. That makes a lot of sense. But the way I'm reading this home-based
493.72s: kind of thing to me that just reeks of trying to be comfortable and wanting to be comfortable.
498.92s: And you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable in my opinion. So that's what I say to that.
506.60s: I guess picking core positions, building scans. Yep, that's good. I think I'm stuck there. Yeah.
511.64s: And I mean, you will be stuck there unless you choose to not be stuck there. So then they go on
517.56s: to say normally I copy people and then iterate on my own, but variants and constraints are so
521.88s: wide with this. It's not the same as other skills. Yeah, I completely agree. You can't copy people
525.08s: in this. You kid maybe take inspiration from here or there. But if this is your system of learning,
529.40s: this is not good. So let's say let's go from here. It's really super, super simple. We're actually
536.76s: going to cover it a little bit as we get through the presentation today. But you have an idea of
543.40s: picking core strategies or structures that you might run, finding conditions to look for those.
548.84s: Oh, like actually, I'm going to stop there because we're literally going to talk about this in
552.12s: just a second. But we'll talk about these next steps from the jump here. Truck and plane. Good
559.80s: afternoon from New Zealand. It's great to see you. And we're actually on our first stand-up face.
565.96s: What time is it truck and plane in New Zealand? And while we're figuring out what time it is in New
571.96s: Zealand, let's get into this. All right. So we talked about this stuff yesterday. Yada, yada, yada,
577.64s: blah, blah, blah. This we didn't talk about because this is a new ad. And there's really nothing
583.48s: revolutionary in here for you other than the fact that I like the colors. But I just want to give
588.84s: you kind of this other side of the equation, primary market participants. There's way more than
594.12s: this. But my goal here is for retail traders to see that there's a lot going on in the space.
602.12s: These can break down into subcategories. The overall goal for these different entities is different.
609.96s: But it's we're operating in a space that has a lot of other players. But there's a lot of different
615.80s: rules. And that's a really common misconception. I was actually emailing somebody a little bit
620.44s: earlier about this where markets are competitive. There's not just money laying around everywhere.
625.32s: Everywhere. But at no point as you use a retail trader, you're not competing with high frequency
631.16s: traders. They're literally doing something completely different than you. There's no competition
635.56s: there loosely, right? Obviously, if you put a terrible offer out, one of the algos might scoop it
641.16s: up and orbit. Sure. That's obviously an extreme scenario. But the entire world that we play in
647.72s: is so different. It's so different than what the vast majority of these other entities are doing.
652.60s: Prop traders slightly different. They're way closer and there's definitely competition there.
656.44s: Even market makers, there's some competition there because they can try to front run your order if
659.88s: they think you're an informed trade coming through. But you're not in direct competition with them.
664.92s: They're doing very different things writ large. High frequency traders literally are fighting over
671.80s: how close they can locate near the exchange to decrease the length of their freaking cables to
679.88s: transact milliseconds faster than somebody else. That's where they're at. They're paying millions of
685.72s: dollars to do things like that and build the requisite infrastructure. I'm not doing that at all.
692.52s: I'm sitting here with again a freaking sleep and dog in my office. So again, the point is we're in a
699.40s: competitive space. Very, very different place. Truck and plane says it's 12 p.m. Saturday. Oh, that's
706.76s: literally perfect. Great time change. Pat says 0 111 in the UK. Good old UK. I wonder what the
717.08s: weather's like there. All this says there's even cable speed bumps. Yeah. So that's really the point
723.00s: that to drive home there. We already talked about this. This is actually what we're going to talk about.
728.68s: So what I was going to for the one-eyed fat man that I was going to follow up with. And I don't
734.28s: know why I like angles. This is actually really inconvenient. So you might have to tilt your head
739.08s: to follow along here. But you know, so be it. What I'm highlighting in this slide is trading
750.12s: options is really confusing to people and that they think options inherently provide some sort of
757.64s: edge when they do not. So the way I think about trading options is the very first thing I'm doing
765.88s: is devising a thesis based on a profit mechanism of some sort. So for example, if I want to trade
776.36s: momentum, breakouts to the upside, I can buy calls, I can sell puts, I can buy shares. That comes
782.68s: down to optimizing what works best based on my deployment. The mechanism is the same across all
789.08s: those different products. Momentum, breakout to the upside. That's a directional trading strategy.
794.04s: Now the cool part about options is you gain exposure to completely different asset classes
798.92s: essentially, namely things like volatility. And you can trade a completely different world. But
804.36s: again, in that scenario, volatility is the profit mechanism. Then the structures that you then turn
811.64s: into strategies, that is simply the implementation of the tools. In this case, that would be
817.08s: derivatives via options. Truck complaints says, bro, my internet can only comparatively stream this
825.96s: damn live stream, let alone make a trade in milliseconds, literally, literally. That's actually hilarious.
833.48s: So notice says fit more in one slide, but still big enough to read. Yeah, I probably could have
839.24s: sized that stuff up a little bit, I suppose. Jay says kind of off that, how much do you think as a
845.64s: retail trader, think about what the other traders are doing when planning your strategies of positions?
850.60s: I guess stuff like sentiment indices and stuff like that. Yeah, that's a great question.
854.60s: The first thing I will definitely mention on that is I think for retail traders, sometimes they're
859.48s: way too concerned with other people with what other people are doing. So trying to play the game
864.68s: of like, what's the other guy on my trade doing is really a fool's errand. You're not going to
869.08s: learn much that way. So and the reason why I think that is because again, like we don't know the
873.88s: motivation of the other side of your trade. You could have a roaring kitty on the other side of
879.00s: your trade who's literally just out there moving around doing a bunch of crazy seemingly things.
885.32s: He has his goal in mind though. He's doing his thing. I don't know about looking at half a billion
891.24s: dollars in the face and then taking shares of stock, but he made that choice essentially.
895.88s: That's the cool part about markets and kind of what I'm highlighting is that there are a lot of
900.76s: different reasons for what people do. So when planning strategies and positions, you can leverage
908.12s: elements of sentiment, but that gets more baked into the strategy way less about the, if I sell
915.16s: this call, that means the other person on the other side thinks it's going up and maybe they know
919.32s: more than me. That could be the case. That could not be the case. They also could be playing a
923.72s: completely different game than you. That long call could be some sort of hedge that they're hoping to
928.76s: lose on against a larger position that they have elsewhere. So again, playing the game of what's
935.16s: the other guy doing? It's okay to be aware of it and you should be, but it's kind of a circuitous
941.80s: route. I think the most important thing you can focus on, it's kind of a hat tip to the
948.12s: stoic methodology of things, but focusing on your control, what you can control. You can't control
953.88s: what the other guy is doing and what they're thinking. You should be generally aware that other
958.28s: market participants are generally smart. That's not always the case. You could get paired up with
963.88s: a complete idiot. None of that matters necessarily. But as you're playing the game, I think it's
968.44s: important to think markets are generally relatively informed. And like if you see something that seems
975.16s: way too good to be true, you're probably missing something, stuff like that. But it's a great question.
980.92s: I think the absolute focal point for traders, in my opinion, is on your own book and on your own
989.00s: strategies. Whatever it is that whatever profit mechanism that you first outlined and then measured
997.80s: and know is there, you can control that. You can see it. So going through that process is really
1003.56s: important. This is a lot of what I share with you guys in the discord is just a bunch of different
1009.00s: studies. I'm studying the markets every single day. I've built a massive data set that I query
1016.04s: against just to look for ideas, just to confirm existing ideas and see if they're still relevant.
1021.48s: But the whole point is just start here, profit mechanism. There's got to be something that makes
1026.60s: money. You can then fit an option structure, then strategy around whatever that is. But to me,
1032.04s: this would be essentially the primary focus, being aware of the other counterparties good, but
1037.16s: that's not going to tip the scales one way or the other. I, this one I think we already did. You
1044.04s: guys already know about buyers and sellers. You guys already know the components of an options
1048.52s: contract. You guys already know about calls and puts, which is great. This one I think I've added in.
1056.20s: So this one is a bit of a ugly word slide. I think this covers most stuff that we've already
1062.36s: hit on. Correct me if I'm wrong. But you guys, this might be worth lingering on for just a few
1068.28s: moments, the pricing component, the at the end of the day. And I think we did talk about this,
1073.32s: but I just want to make sure we did. When we're looking at options prices in the market. So if I come
1079.32s: in here to GME, get rid of this example trade for now. And I'll pick something other than GME
1084.92s: just so that you guys don't get completely fatigued by looking at the same thing because I'm obsessed
1089.56s: with it right now. And let's say these 35 DTE 19 July Apple 205 puts these ones, the 26 Delta's.
1100.44s: The way that this price is quoted here is by market consensus. That's really what it boils down to.
1107.56s: Now we talk about all these different kinds of theoretical pricing models. We talk about things
1113.64s: like the Black Sholes Martin pricing model, which actually doesn't represent markets. We can use it
1120.12s: in some instances. And it was the framework for how we originally started thinking about pricing
1124.12s: options. You can use things like binomial trees. You can do all sorts of kind of different
1129.64s: permutations of pricing models. They lay a foundation for us. The way that options are priced in
1135.64s: the market is via supply and demand. The other thing most importantly, as that educated price
1140.84s: discovery is occurring and supply and demand is being established. What is happening is this.
1147.96s: We are looking to solve for volatility. So as different entities are making markets, as you could
1156.04s: probably tell by the way I'm framing that, making markets, market makers, they're determining what the
1161.80s: value of volatility should be in their model to offer options at that price. So on the retail side,
1169.16s: you can choose to attempt to track and forecast volatility. You can do that. And I'll
1175.56s: actually talk a little bit about that later because I think there was a few questions about it.
1179.40s: And I geek out over that stuff. I have a bunch of different models built to try and do it.
1185.56s: But the fact of the matter is unless you think you can do it better than the market,
1189.80s: your prices don't actually matter that much. That's why we call it implied volatility. We use
1196.44s: whatever the market is pricing. So again, this 20526 delta put right now the implied volatility on
1202.84s: it is 21.08%. That's implied from the current pricing of the option. Regardless of what I get,
1210.52s: this is probably more accurate. Probably. It doesn't mean that it is and there are opportunities
1217.16s: to find misprice options. But I would consider that a much more sophisticated approach that will take
1222.92s: time. That's not where I personally would start. That's not where I'm directing you guys.
1227.32s: At least the whole concept of this is to share the path I would give myself to be very,
1232.76s: very clear. So I wouldn't turn that off as something that you can't look at. But for example,
1239.08s: a much better play if we want to use this specific volatility example. And if this is like way too
1245.00s: literally just let me know in the chat and I can completely pivot. But I want to maybe see if
1250.12s: this helps explain a few things. If we just look through this options chain and the implied volatility
1256.60s: at different prices, there are some anomalies that immediately stick out to me. And there are relative
1264.68s: pricing opportunities. So let's go maybe something like 21 days. Let's see if these are liquid enough.
1271.96s: Just for an example, yeah, these are okay. So what you can do is monitor the value of implied
1281.00s: volatility for different time frames and different strikes at different deltas in specific underlines.
1287.56s: If you want to be sophisticated, you can import all of this data so that you don't have to manually
1291.48s: comb through. If you're relatively new to this, you just pick a couple underlines. In general,
1296.60s: if you're trying to look at volatility the way I'm about to describe it, doing it in super
1301.00s: liquid products is not the move because there's so much liquidity and movement in these products.
1305.64s: Finding mispricings becomes way more difficult because this is where a lot of people are looking.
1310.20s: The more often opportunities are going to be found in like the trashy less liquid small products
1316.20s: because for other entities to interact in those market spaces, it's just not worth their time
1320.76s: in capital because they can't size a position on well enough. I'm priced out of a bunch of stuff and
1325.48s: I'm still very much a small fish compared to the other entities I'm referring to.
1330.92s: So if we look at the let's say 21 days to expiration and we look at the 22 delta here,
1337.64s: I see that that's priced at a 21.14. Let's go further out and I already forgot what delta. I
1344.76s: just told you guys 22 delta. Yeah, 22 delta. So let's find a 22 delta ish. There's no direct
1351.72s: here that's kind of annoying. Let's see if we can find a 22 delta here. This is 24 delta.
1356.12s: This 24 delta is priced at 21.29%. So you can come up with a relative value play based on
1362.76s: a variance between these volatilities. What I'm highlighting in this scenario is that there are
1370.04s: opportunities to play relative relative premium opportunities in options, but it's a slightly more
1378.52s: sophisticated strategy that requires more tracking. That's what this will boil down to.
1383.80s: The other thing that you should note though is if we look across this options chain,
1388.36s: notice why I'm just to the volatility when it's at the money. You see 20.36% here and then you go
1394.28s: further out of the money that volatility starts jacking way up. That's an important observation
1400.36s: to make, especially if you're making relative volatility plays like we're talking about. That
1404.84s: creates different opportunities. You can also look at the corresponding delta put in call and see
1411.32s: if there's some sort of skew there that you can play with. What I'm sharing here are just a bunch
1417.72s: of random different ideas that I absolutely look at and trade from time to time in using something like
1425.64s: what I would consider to be relative pricing opportunities. It's an entire different strategy of
1431.96s: trading, which is the thing. Policies, what entities do you look for? Sorry, could you clarify that
1438.60s: question? What entities do you look for? Do you mean what the entities look for that I'm talking
1446.04s: about in terms of their ability to be able to transact your or what kind of products I look for?
1451.32s: And then truck complaints says do you use volatility smile charts for that sort of thing? Do you
1454.76s: prefer to look at the option chain? Yeah, yeah, definitely. So with you can use volatility smile and
1461.16s: surface charts all the time. There's a bunch of different ones available. You can create your own
1465.00s: and import if you like. You can use stuff like this down here, which is also super simple. It's a
1469.72s: slightly less definitive model and it can be a little noisy. But in order to make something like
1474.28s: this work, I typically would pick, you know, 50, 75 strikes, which is pick 50. And then instead of
1479.48s: all the different series, I would pick the primary series. So in this case, I would start by using
1484.68s: the standard explorations, aka not the weekly. So I would pick like this, pick like this, pick like
1490.20s: this. And then you can look literally for opportunities either relative to the call in the put side.
1497.48s: If there's kinks like that, that's an opportunity. That's a relative value play. You can also, if
1503.88s: you're so inclined, you can combine them and see if there's centralization around a specific strike.
1509.08s: I prefer to look at calls and puts specifically. And the meantime, we go back down.
1516.76s: But yeah, you can absolutely use smile or skew charts for sure.
1523.56s: Samo just says can see it's behind you. Oh, yeah, sorry. My bad. It's literally right behind me.
1529.48s: And all right, let me get me out of the way. There you go. So I'm talking about kinks like this.
1535.64s: Or even kinks like this steeper is better. But stuff like that. Now you have to understand why it's
1543.80s: there. That's an important component to this because the like these big dips, they might mean
1549.64s: something. It's not always that you see these kind of really extreme drops. But again, it's a spot
1556.12s: to at least potentially look. You can say, okay, perhaps in the, what is this? The 19 July's,
1562.92s: perhaps the 91 calls might be underpriced in terms of all. Now again, it's, this is probably
1568.44s: something because it's after hours and markets are closed. You typically don't see stuff like zero
1573.16s: out, right? It wouldn't have zero wall. But that's the idea. Anyways, is looking for relative value
1578.60s: value plays something like that. Paul says products. Yeah. So for products, what I'm talking about,
1587.48s: what I'm looking for, it's especially for these relative value plays. I'm looking for things
1593.56s: that have interesting, interesting volatility. If there's an event coming up that helps a lot,
1602.28s: that's a slightly different style play, but that's also one that I would integrate into this.
1607.24s: And I also care if it's moderately liquid. Again, for me, I've been kind of priced out of a lot
1616.76s: of things that I typically would trade previously, but a great example of a previous book that I
1623.64s: normally would try to a biotech. Now when I trade biotech, I have to trade it smaller and I essentially
1629.00s: have to size it as if I can't manage it again. So the way I can trade that is very different.
1635.00s: So Motis says, cause of kinks. Yeah. The, I mean, the simplest explanation without going super far
1643.56s: in the weeds on that, kinks are caused by different relative volatility pricing. That's all that
1649.40s: means. So in that case, as we're looking at implied volatility curve, that simply means at this
1653.88s: strike for whatever reason, it's priced either low or high relative to everything else that's
1659.00s: around it. Now why that's priced as that? That's kind of part of the name of the game. We
1664.28s: gotta lose the socks. It's a little too warm in here now. That's kind of part of the name of the
1669.48s: game is determining why. But yeah, the short answer is to why that happens is it's simply because
1677.08s: volatility is either underpriced or overpriced relative to what's right around it in that same
1681.72s: expiration cycle. And then again, on that same thing, you can compare other like different
1687.08s: expiration cycles to one another. So let's see if we use like SPX.
1692.12s: And again, like this, you have to get rid of a bunch of the series. There's just way, way too
1701.16s: much noise in order to be able to see anything quarterly. So this right there, this is another
1705.88s: immediate relative value play that I can see. If you can see it, throw it in the chat before I
1709.72s: answer. There's actually several of them in this case. And again, the way that you play it is
1714.28s: different and the way that it unwinds is different. Just because you play it doesn't mean it works out.
1722.28s: I'm curious if you guys have any guesses as to what I'm seeing specifically on the call site here at
1734.36s: least. Oh my god, I just swallowed a piece that went down the exact wrong tube.
1746.28s: Alex says, kink exactly. And this is large enough. This is now interesting to me because that is a
1755.64s: very distinct kink. And Alex's other perspective, to be honest, says, can't see puts out, yeah, it's fine.
1765.00s: I'm not talking about the puts out. Don't worry about it. But the other thing that Alex points out
1770.20s: is exactly correct. We're looking at the slope variance between these aspirations. So now what you
1775.96s: can do is say, okay, I want to look at, I actually don't know what those DTEs are. Let's take a quick
1781.56s: look. 21 June, 34. And then the 16 August, which is 60 days. Let's add that August in there.
1790.36s: This one. So now you get to make a decision. You can say you have the 21 June down here, the 28 June
1797.40s: up here, the 16 August here. You can even add another one, maybe the 19 July.
1804.84s: You can make a determination. One, notice the kink here in this specific expiration cycle. This is
1810.52s: in the 28 June. That's something that you're not seeing on anything else. This is a great example
1815.48s: of a relative value play in terms of volatility. The other thing I see is notice that the
1819.32s: departure between these two lines relative to one another, the 19 July's are much less steep in
1825.00s: terms of their drop as compared to the 28 June's. So what we're seeing very clearly is more
1830.84s: volatility being priced into the calls here this far out in time. That's again something you can play.
1836.52s: Now on the put side, which now I do want you to look at. So I will get out you a way.
1842.28s: Is look at this. How much the 21 June's peaked on the put side compared to the 28 June's.
1852.60s: This is another relative value play. So just looking in volatility, you can find tons in tons
1860.20s: and tons of ideas. That's why I say there's always traits. There's literally always traits.
1866.04s: All right, I'd probably just keep myself on the top right. Huh? Keep me out of the way for you guys.
1870.76s: I don't really think anybody's super eager to look at me. I'm not eager to look at me.
1875.24s: The multiplier you guys know, right? That's just the standard. That's the standard size of a contract.
1885.08s: So if we grab spy, it's better example since there's an underlying that trades.
1890.84s: And we look at any of these options, you have to multiply the premium by 100. And that is because
1896.92s: this represents 100 shares. There are actually, I don't know if there's still art. Do you guys know
1901.96s: if there's still many options there used to be? I know that there's like teeth style options
1908.52s: is compared to like SPX. There's like the little brother, which are the tenth the size.
1912.52s: But that's the product itself. I'm curious about options themselves because I think they used to have
1917.16s: like Apple minis. I think they got rid of them though because I don't think they were super liquid.
1922.76s: Damn it. Chat GPT just signed me out at the worst possible time. I was going to have chat GPT look
1928.04s: at up for us. I bet we could still have chat GPT. I don't think so. I haven't seen them.
1934.68s: And Apple was one of the products. They try to pick the most liquid products. Here we go.
1939.32s: Do markets still offer many options? Let's see the answer.
1947.80s: As of now, many options are generally not available for individual stocks or ETFs. Yeah.
1960.28s: They were introduced to allow smaller investors to trade options with lower capital requirements since
1964.36s: many options represent 10 shares instead of 100. But they were discontinued due to low trading
1969.32s: volume and demand. Yeah, makes it so. So that's super common. And it's because options, people
1975.72s: don't realize how liquidity-based this stuff is. It's wildly, wildly liquidity-based.
1983.88s: And that's why when we look at something like SPX, it's why you see literally daily
1990.84s: expirations because there's enough liquidity. There's enough demand to transact in these time frames,
1996.12s: which is actually very, very cool. That stuff like that is a thing.
2000.36s: Trot complaints as many futures, completely different concept when we're talking about the
2005.32s: underlying itself as compared to the options on the underlying. But yeah, you're 100% correct.
2011.00s: There are the micros. So you have the eminies and the micros which are smaller. Then you have
2015.96s: things like SPX versus I think it's what? Xsp? Is that right? Yeah. So this is the mini SPX index.
2024.60s: So it takes it down massively. It takes it down to 543 versus 5431. So yeah, there are
2033.88s: many products, but there's not many options. I don't know if you guys ever actually seen that.
2038.84s: For me, I'm ever seeing them pop up. And then they have, I haven't seen them since. So it makes sense.
2044.36s: They have disappeared due to lack of interest. But anyways, that's what the multiplier is.
2048.84s: It used to be that there used to be minis. So you kind of have to know if it's multiply by 110,
2055.08s: but now it's easy. It's all 100. American versus European options is important from a few
2060.52s: different perspectives. And you guys should know what that is by now, I think. I think we talked
2063.64s: about that last time as well. But it's essentially when an option can be exercised. American style
2069.48s: options can be exercised. And I guess I should say exercise here versus assigned.
2074.68s: At any time. So if roaring kitty, for example, great example, if he exercises options, it's due to
2083.40s: the fact that they're American, he's able to exercise them at any point in time.
2088.36s: A lot of products are American style, the vast majority, but there are European style options. So
2095.00s: things like SPX is European style option. That means it can only be exercised at expiration.
2102.20s: That impacts the risk of the position so that actually impacts the pricing pretty significantly.
2109.80s: J Kim says, so can you exercise the option when it hurts you? You can, but it wouldn't help you
2115.96s: unfortunately. If you're exercising an option that's not doing what you want as the buyer,
2121.96s: only the buyer can I forgot what you can't respond right now, which one do I look that one? Okay.
2125.96s: As the buyer, you get to choose the seller. You don't get to choose it all. But as the buyer,
2131.88s: if you choose to exercise an option that's not working, let's look at an example and go down that
2136.76s: rabbit hole, APL again. Oh, let's use Nvidia. I haven't looked at it much since it's split. Check that
2144.52s: out. That's super cool. 131, little baby product now. So if we, let's say we bought this call,
2153.24s: the one throughout even better, even better, I'm going to go into on demand. So this is now
2158.12s: taking us back in time so that we can look at an example and then kind of dissect how this goes.
2166.84s: And what's actually even better is if I go in here and I find a time where this wouldn't work
2172.68s: well for us. So I'm actually going to find another product that's not going up IWM as a great example.
2178.60s: So let's go back in time to the 28th of March. And let's take a look at how this would perform
2187.64s: down to the 19th of April. So I'm going to go back into on demand. I'm going to take us back to March
2195.08s: 28th. I'm going to change the time to that. So you'll see this chart update. This is one of the
2202.04s: cool things you could do. And think or swim is kind of go back and play. It's I think especially
2206.84s: for stuff like this, I'm hopeful that it'll better elucidate the point because one of the things I
2211.88s: can do sometimes that's not super fair is because I can kind of like see all this stuff in my head.
2216.60s: I know that sometimes as I'm talking about it, it's not as clear maybe as it is to me.
2221.56s: So let's take a look at let's just say we wanted to buy a call. Now another great kind of workshop
2228.84s: topic here. When I'm looking to buy a call, I'm going to freeze the market so it's not noise.
2234.12s: When I'm looking to buy a call, I'm typically going to try to go further out in time,
2238.68s: typically greater than 60 days. And I'm typically going to try to go in the money at least a little bit.
2245.16s: Do you guys have any idea why I would do that?
2250.84s: And if you don't know what any of that means, that's completely okay, you don't have to. Part of
2255.00s: what I like to do when I'm talking about this stuff is surround you with the topics and concepts.
2261.32s: And it's not all going to make sense right out of the gate, but as you hear over time,
2265.56s: it will start to click. So even if it's something that sounds like a different language to you,
2268.92s: that's completely okay, just literally let it passively into your mind.
2273.80s: So the reason why we do this is because the way that Delta behaves.
2281.08s: Alex says, Jay says with more DTE, you would have more time to enter in the money. Yep,
2288.52s: so that's a great, great point. So with more days to expiration, you have more time for the trade
2296.20s: to move in your favor. Now, it to be very clear in it does not have to go in the money
2306.68s: in order for you to make money on your long option. So if you buy a call or buy a put,
2312.36s: the underlying does not need to go in the money in order for you to start making money.
2317.48s: It doesn't even have to go to your strike. It just needs to move in the correct direction.
2323.00s: And then Dennis says to reduce risk. It's a good point. Now, that's a tricky one though,
2327.16s: because when you go further out in time, let's take a look at an example. If I buy these 22 DTE
2333.16s: IWM calls, let's say I go at the money. These two 12s are trading for like 292, something like that.
2341.80s: If I go out to beyond 60 days, 85 days, and I go to like a 52 Delta, again, these are now trading
2347.24s: for like 7625. So did I actually reduce risk? Kind of not because these are more expensive.
2355.56s: So if I'm buying an option, if we buy a call, we know our max risk is defined by the premium we pay.
2363.56s: In this case, your max risk is lower on a dollar basis because this is a lower dollar amount.
2371.64s: In this trade, I buy it for $392. In this trade, I have to put up more money. I have to put up
2379.24s: $762. Put this trade on. So on a dollar basis, it's more risk. Now, in terms of the dynamics of
2387.32s: the position and holding this position, going further out in time gives your option more time to work.
2395.56s: So in that sense, it decreases your time risk. So what I'm highlighting is when we're talking about
2401.08s: options, it is really, really important to decouple the various types of risk that exist for us now
2408.04s: because when you're trading something like equities, risk is pretty straightforward. You put your
2412.44s: money in, it goes up or down. That's about as much there is to it. It's as simple as it gets.
2417.08s: With options, we introduce again, like we talked about in the last session, a lot of complexity.
2422.44s: We now have time risk. We need to be correct in the correct amount of time. We have volatility risk.
2426.76s: If volatility moves unfavorably to us, it can temporarily decrease the profitability of our position,
2431.88s: or permanently, if it stays down or up. We now have interest rate risk less applicable in most
2438.68s: scenarios, but it's worth mentioning. It's not something you typically have to worry too much about.
2443.24s: So Dennis, your instincts there are right on, but it's just really important to get a little more
2448.76s: nuanced with the response. Tommy says slightly in the money less theta decay, position behaves more
2455.64s: like shares. That's exactly it. So as soon as you go deeper in the money with a higher delta,
2458.92s: you're going to decrease your theta decay. However, you're paying more money upfront. So you're essentially
2466.36s: taking two different risk profiles and modulating them to be what you want. If I go further in the
2472.60s: money, my cost risk profile is going up. However, my theta decay profile, which is this here, we'll go
2481.24s: down. So one of the cool parts is you can de-conflict things like theta decay by using different
2487.80s: delta or by using different times. Because for example, 85 days to expiration, if we take a look at
2494.12s: the theta decay for the at the money strikes, it's six cents. If we go super deep in the money all
2500.84s: the way down to an 81 delta, it's five cents. You've decreased it by one penny. Is that worth the
2508.12s: cost? For me, it wouldn't be at all. I don't care about that one penny in theta decay. That is
2512.44s: completely fine. So then it's more of a scenario of, okay, this metric theta decay doesn't matter
2518.68s: to me as much. So now, how do I feel about the cost relative to the delta? Do I think that there's
2523.48s: going to be a really big move? If so, maybe I go something out here, it's like a 50 delta.
2529.16s: If I think it's going to be maybe a smaller move and I want to participate in more of it on a
2532.76s: dollar for dollar basis, maybe I go deeper in the money and cough up the money. Don't know. But that's
2537.72s: the cool part with options is you get to pick all of those details. So now going back to Jay's
2543.24s: original question, let's say that we want to analyze exercising the options if things are
2549.72s: not working in our favor. So let's say we buy these 50 DTE 212s. So they're going to cost us. I'm
2558.60s: just going to make it 660. So it's easier to talk about. It'll cost us 660 bucks. Now let's fast
2564.36s: forward time and we'll go out to April and I think it was kind of crappy around like the 18th of
2570.20s: the 20th or something. Let's go out here and let's see what our option is trading for at that time.
2575.80s: Yeah, it went way down. And we have the 212s. So what's going to happen here is you're going to see
2584.44s: the option move super far out of the money in a way from where we're at, which is unfavorable to
2591.40s: the long call. There it goes. So 212s are now way out here. So the option that we bought for $6.60
2598.84s: is now worth 45 cents. It's essentially completely further out of the money. So following Jay's joking,
2605.08s: but still a good hypothesis to to to play out is well, what if we exercise the option? What you can,
2613.56s: but a few things happen when you exercise the option one, you forego the remaining extrinsic value
2620.44s: that you could have captured by selling the option. So if I sell the option to close the position,
2626.60s: I capture this cost back to me. I get it back. You lost most of your option, but you still get
2632.20s: some back. If you exercise, this is just going. The other thing is if you're a long call, it gives you
2638.44s: the right to purchase shares at a specific price, your strike price. And in this case, we have the
2643.96s: so I WM is now trading at 195 02. So sure, you can buy them at 212. I would want to buy a
2651.80s: met to 12, not even close. So if you're, however, saying, well, I really don't want to take this loss
2658.20s: and I want to hold the position for a long time and build a position, you can do that. But that
2663.08s: obsession with trying to avoid losing trades is way more damaging than it's helpful. So for me,
2669.56s: if I felt that kind of way that I really wanted to build a big position in I WM and I like it here,
2674.28s: you can just eat this cost, recoup your extrinsic value and then just buy it at the money.
2679.72s: You're going to lose the money here. It's gone already, but you're not essentially doubling down
2684.20s: into something that's moving against you and then tying up capital way more capital for a
2689.08s: longer period of time. Because again, you have to buy 100 shares at 212. So 21,200. So Jay, I know
2698.12s: you obviously meant that partially as a joke, but that's actually why it doesn't help you at all.
2702.68s: It does us very, very little good. Then it says less of a lottery ticket type trade, so a bit more
2709.40s: money paid up from higher chance of profit. That is literally exactly correct. That is exactly correct.
2714.60s: The way to think about those kinds of plays, at least the way that I trade long options,
2718.12s: which again, big caveat. I'm kind of talking to you guys from the perspective of how I do business.
2723.96s: There are other people who trade lots of different ways. If you listen to any of the books,
2729.16s: Stock Market Wizards by Jack Schwager, you'll hear that everybody has a different approach.
2734.44s: And funny enough, the way that markets are, everybody has an approach that can work for them.
2739.40s: It's there. But what's really important is defining an approach that aligns with you as a human
2745.16s: being. That is so freaking important. I cannot overstate it. And it's really hard to find out. It
2750.60s: takes some time. I bring that up because again, I'm talking about the way that I think about
2756.12s: using something like a long call. I'm using it for a leverage directional play.
2760.28s: Other people can absolutely try to just go with yellows. They can try to go super far out of
2765.40s: the money. They don't care if they lose 90 of 100 trades. But if those 10 trades actually are
2771.88s: profitable enough to overwhelm those losses, then it's still profitable. Just not how I do business.
2776.36s: So just a really important caveat. Now, when we are looking at these different structures,
2782.84s: which we're going to get to in a minute, you'll notice that as I'm talking about them,
2786.28s: there's a lot, a lot of different trade-offs. And that's the cool part about options. Because
2791.16s: for something like a ratio called diagonal, one of my go-to strategies, I often will add what I
2797.32s: call kicker options, which is actually kind of closer to what Dennis is talking about.
2802.28s: So sometimes if I'm really convicted in something that I think it's going to go up,
2807.32s: let's, for whatever reason. So let's say for right now, I just think I'd be able to go up.
2810.76s: I probably wouldn't hear yet until a little more confirmation. But let's just play the scenario.
2814.76s: I think this is going to go up. Well, I can trade a ratio called diagonal. I can go out,
2820.60s: let's say 90 days by my in the money option. But I'm really convicted that this thing is going to move.
2826.92s: So what I can do on top of that is I can go a little closer in time and go further out of the money.
2833.72s: These are cheaper options. But the way that they will behave is very different. Let's take a look.
2840.28s: Let's say we buy these 2.11s. Can you do analyze trade in here? Yes. Kind of slow, but okay,
2849.56s: great. That works. Great, great, great. And then let's take a look at this, the 92.
2857.08s: And let's say that we get like 80 delta. Let's take a look at how this looks.
2865.08s: So let's take a look at a couple scenarios. We think IWM is going to go up a whole bunch.
2869.96s: Well, we can go further out in time, deeper in the money. It's going to cost us way more money
2875.64s: in this scenario. I would be paying 1966. So 1,966 bucks. And this down here would be only 175 bucks.
2884.68s: If I did the 21 June 21. Big difference in delta. These are a 20 delta, the 211s. The 180s are a
2894.12s: 79.63 delta. So call it an 80 delta. So before I show you the difference between these, what can you
2901.24s: infer if we get a price accommodation? How would these behave? And I specifically want to know
2909.08s: which one would compound better? Which one would make more money as a gross dollar amount?
2917.48s: Paul says, how would you have explored that king in the SPX curve? That would be a relative
2922.04s: wallplay. So you can either trade the expected fade of the point or you can trade the expected rise
2928.04s: of the surrounding walls. You could trade relative to a different time frame. In order for you to
2936.44s: answer that question for yourself, what you would need to do is study them a little bit and see
2940.84s: how different structures behave around it. That's the correct answer for you.
2946.92s: Truck complaints says option with the higher delta will make more money. Okay.
2951.32s: So far so good. Which option compounds more? Any thoughts?
2963.16s: Do you guys know what I mean by compounds more?
2972.20s: A lot of us. Yeah, the further out of the money, the kicker options.
2977.08s: A truck complaint says no, that's perfect. So when I talk about compounding more, yep,
2981.88s: Samo does exactly correct. The percent return on an invested capital. So let's take a look at
2987.08s: these two different scenarios. Let's say that we get to these plots here. They don't. That's kind
2991.96s: of annoying. It'll be it. Let's say we get a move to 240. At 240, our single, deep in the money
3003.08s: option would provide a profit of 4124. So let's say 4124 divided by
3013.64s: 1966. So that gives us a 209 percent return on invested capital. Really good return at 240.
3024.76s: That's a big move, by the way. If we take a look at the further out of the money option,
3030.36s: this option only returns 2812. However, you only put in 175 dollars. So this option returns
3040.52s: 1607 percent. That's compounding. In this cheaper option, you will get a lower dollar return as
3053.08s: a gross figure, but you will get if it's a big accommodating move, a much better percent compound
3060.44s: return. That's the tradeoff. So then you get to then make a decision. You could say, well,
3067.08s: I think there's going to be a really, really big move. So rather than putting one trade on at 1966,
3073.24s: I'm going to go further out of the money and I'm going to put on six trades. Oops, that's
3078.76s: wrong button. Forget what this was trading at. Let's call it 175. And in this case, we put on six.
3087.72s: This is still cheaper than what you paid for this one option. So if you have that 175 times six,
3095.40s: you'd be putting up a thousand and 50 bucks. So this is still half the size of this position,
3100.84s: but let's say you still get that same accommodating move to 240. Now your return is 16246.
3108.28s: That's leverage. That is quite literally leverage at play.
3113.80s: Paul says, I can't see the entire strategy. What strategy you talk about?
3118.44s: You talk about here? You can see the whole thing. Yeah, this is all there is to it.
3125.56s: Are you talking about the SPX stuff? The SPX stuff is a whole different ballgame.
3129.00s: We can absolutely talk about that a little bit more in another session, but I think getting into
3133.48s: a ball relative place because the other thing, if you start doing stuff like that, you have to get
3137.08s: more sophisticated with the approach to isolate the volatility. So you have to do things like
3140.44s: Gamahedge and that opens up a completely completely different dialogue. It's cool stuff, but not
3146.12s: so fitting at least for this dialogue. So anyways, back to this. If we take a look at
3154.12s: the compounding potential for these cheaper, further out of the money options, it's much bigger.
3158.68s: And if you put on same size positions, you can make way more money. But again, you need a bigger move
3165.64s: in order for these to pay you out as much as what you can make on a dollar for dollar basis
3171.40s: with deeper in the money options.
3175.00s: Truck Complain says, what are the drawbacks about doing more out of the money options first,
3179.00s: less in the money options apart from lower chance of profit? I just said another component to it.
3185.32s: Can you guys take a guess at what it is? Right now, we're using a scenario where essentially we're
3191.00s: presuming IWM goes from 195 all the way up to 240.
3203.96s: Shrey says higher chance of loss. Yep, well, I guess that's kind of the inverse of
3210.44s: probably profit. Yep, okay, Shrey J is on it like white on rice. That's a massive, massive point.
3216.92s: So if we take a look at theta decay, this option is losing five cents a day.
3224.92s: If we go to the 60 day and we look at theta decay, this option is using
3231.00s: four cents a day. So you might be saying, well, wait a minute, this is losing more, oh, five cents.
3237.16s: This is losing five cents. So why, like, what's going on here? Why would this not be the optimal answer?
3243.56s: Well, look at it as a percentage relative to the premium of the option.
3248.68s: This is losing five cents on something that again, we got into for 1966.
3253.72s: If we look at this, this is losing four cents on something that has a $1.75 left to go.
3259.16s: As a percentage, the theta decay here is massive. So you are bleeding heavily.
3265.32s: And this is already going 64 days out, which again, most people don't do when they're buying
3270.04s: options. They're really cheap. When most people are buying options, they're going like same week,
3273.88s: maybe two weeks if they're slightly patient. And if we take a look at that profile and we look at
3279.32s: again, like a 20 delta out of the money option, this thing is worth 90 cents. And it's losing nine
3286.28s: cents a day. It's decaying at a massive relative rate to the premium that's there. So that's the
3294.04s: other reason. The other thing is you need a big move. You need a big accommodating move in order
3300.20s: to start seeing your money. If you see a small move, even with a larger position, unless the delta's
3307.00s: are the same aggregate size, it doesn't matter. What I mean by that is again, if we're looking at this
3313.64s: further out in time, this is 80 delta's right at the time you put the trade on, you get your 80 delta's.
3320.44s: If we go to something like two weeks out and we go to this super far out of the money,
3325.64s: let's say these 14 delta's, unless you put on the commensurate size that would equal 80 delta's here,
3335.32s: then you don't see the same short term price appreciation if you don't get a big move.
3341.16s: It means you really need these to compound via gamma and start seeing an actual return on the capital
3348.84s: that's meaningful. It's a great question. It's exactly the kind of stuff you guys should be looking
3353.16s: at. So I'm glad that you asked that. And then this one, I think we talked about this one already,
3361.32s: closing positions, spider open, sell the closed, sell the open by the close, essentially just
3365.72s: inversing. Now with options, we can talk about the different scenarios that can happen for an
3370.60s: unwind. So you can close the contracts. That's kind of what most people tend to do. It's
3376.36s: typically a little bit more efficient. You can choose to exercise if you're the buyer,
3381.40s: which as we talked about, you give up the remaining extrinsic value. And then either you would buy
3386.52s: or sell shares at the strike price, if it's a caller put respectively. And if you're a seller,
3392.44s: you could choose to hold it all the way through expiration. You could do that as a buyer as well.
3396.84s: But it's typically not advantageous for a buyer to take something all the way into expiration.
3402.20s: Because if you have something that's really far out of the money, let's say in IWM,
3407.72s: let's actually pull up like the real market now because we're on expiration Friday.
3413.24s: So let's say you have these options that expire in three days. And let's say that you had these
3417.96s: 196s. So and let's say you bought these puts, they have a really low probability of being in the money
3424.92s: at expiration less than 50%. I'm even of a touch, sorry, to be super clear. These have a low
3430.04s: probability of being touched of 32% and being in the money is 16.04%. So low probability trade here.
3437.48s: You could as the buyer of these options say, okay, this didn't move in my favor,
3442.36s: rather than hold it to expiration on hope EM. And maybe this thing will work out. You can just
3447.40s: close a position and you can at least recoup some of your costs. Those kinds of decisions have to
3453.40s: be defined ahead of time. You cannot make them up on the fly. You cannot. The reason why you
3460.92s: cannot make them up on the fly is because you cannot think of any one trade as kind of your book,
3468.04s: the end all be all. Everything you do as a trader should be viewed in the performance of a long-term
3475.40s: system. So if in this individual scenario, you're like, okay, I want my 25 bucks back. I'm going to
3481.48s: buy them back or sell them out so I can recoup the cost. So you do that. Then in that scenario,
3486.68s: you got your money. Then in another scenario, you do something else. And then another scenario,
3490.84s: you do something else. You now have no idea what actually works for the strategy as a whole
3498.60s: over the long run. It's another really common mistake traders have is they get way, way to wrapped up
3506.76s: in the outcome of an individual trade and trying to maximize their profit in an individual trade.
3511.64s: And it's a massive mistake. I cannot overemphasize hopefully based on how dramatic I'm talking,
3517.16s: but I really do mean it. It's a massive, massive mistake. Cool. What else do we got in this old
3526.28s: deck? Huh? We already talked about this one. Let's talk about volatility. I think this is a new one.
3531.72s: So we talked a bit about volatility last time and how it's kind of the big unknown with options.
3539.16s: It's the one part that we're using to price options really. That's why a lot of times you'll hear
3544.68s: season trader. They're not even talking about if I bought to open the 184 or something like that,
3550.60s: you'll hear them say things like, oh, I bought 31 vols. And it's because that's really what we're
3557.56s: trading as option traders, whether or not you fully recognize it. So there are different kinds
3565.24s: of volatility. I think we talked about some of this last time. Oh, sorry, correct me if I'm wrong,
3570.12s: but there's a bunch of different kinds of volatility, especially in the realized volatility side of
3575.56s: space, you can have realized historic future realized. You don't have to worry about any of that
3580.76s: stuff. These are kind of the main volatilities for a new trader to be concerned within the beginning.
3585.00s: Forecast implied statistical or historical, we normally would refer to it as HV historical volatility.
3591.96s: I guess I can add that here and make it easier HV.
3598.28s: Maybe there you go. Most of the time, retail is not doing this, but this is what I was talking about
3606.20s: before in terms of figuring out how to price these options. Most of the time retail is doing this,
3611.40s: where we're looking at a current option price. And because we know all the other variables,
3617.96s: we can imply what the volatility is. That's why it's called implied volatility. We're essentially
3623.32s: using the black sholes, Martin model. And that's a really easy way to derive volatility from current
3628.68s: pricing. And then there's historical volatility. This is looking backwards in time. So if we look at
3636.84s: IWM, you'll notice there's a bunch of different volatilities. Well, you might not, but there is. And
3641.56s: I'll show them to you. We have different volatilities for each expiration. So these 19 July's have
3650.44s: 20 vol 20.8. These 18 June's have 17.9. Really important. No. Notice what happens in general as you go
3662.28s: further out in time. What happens to the volatility? Does it get higher or lower as you go further out in
3667.88s: time? I have to be honest, as I'm doing this, I'm drinking this lime spend drift. And this one is
3682.28s: not as good. I like the raspberry one way better. I am unable to proceed until somebody lets me know
3692.28s: because otherwise I'll be confused for the rest of the session. If we go further out in time in general,
3700.20s: does volatility increase or decrease? Loaf, you are our savior. The motive is flat. That's actually
3708.36s: incorrect. It's a good guess, but it's actually incorrect. Dennis says it depends. That's actually the
3713.96s: most correct answer, if we're being honest. But in general, that is correct. The most accurate answer
3723.16s: is it depends in the general sense. Loaf was right on the money. The reason why it increases in
3730.36s: general and even though there's pockets where it goes up and down, if you were to plot a line of
3735.40s: best fit, it still would go up. And the reason for that is think of it this way. How much
3742.04s: the motive says, are we talking about the ticker on the screen? Sure. It doesn't matter. It's
3745.80s: essentially universal. Even with something like GameStop that will have a bit of a different smile
3751.88s: with this near term volatility than contracting down. As this near term vol bleeds out, this will
3758.12s: eventually revert again, eventually. So this is, I wouldn't use like anomalous circumstances as
3766.44s: like the base of a theme or a thesis. Andre is also exactly correct. The reason why volatility
3774.76s: gets higher as you go further out in time is because more shit can happen. That's really what it
3779.64s: boils down to. Now on a relative basis, you can absolutely have periods where it's high here,
3785.48s: lower here, high here, and you'll normally see that in shorter term time frames. But you can also
3791.64s: see those kinds of pockets out here. This is relatively high. These 21.3s versus these 21.3 ones
3797.32s: versus this 28.82, which is in the middle of those. And again, that's a tradable. This is a
3802.52s: tradable thing right here. The vol for this expiration is much lower compared to its surrounding
3808.68s: constituents. So you could absolutely trade the expansion of vol here against the contraction of
3814.04s: vol here as a payers trade, or you could trade the expansion of vol here by itself. All of those are
3819.56s: completely reasonable positions in this scenario. But that's the reason why in general, you'll see
3824.68s: it increasing as you go further out in time, which is an important thing to know because then when
3829.40s: you see things like this, this identifies an opportunity for us. It's different. We know it's
3835.40s: different. Same thing here. 22.05 compared to 21.82, 21.91. Sometimes you'll see that change involved
3842.84s: because there's a very good reason. There could be some sort of, yep, Jay is Jay. My man, you are
3851.16s: right on it, brother. That's exactly correct. Do these predictions account for events like
3855.96s: elections, earnings, fed, and baseline DTE that is exactly correct. Kill it literally. Kill
3861.00s: a job. It's exactly correct. So volatility is very smart. And we can use it again to identify
3869.08s: opportunities within the market. Sometimes there's a very good reason why the volatility will be
3874.52s: different. Sometimes there might not be as good of a reason. But it still provides another relative
3880.76s: value trade. So Jay, absolutely great job there. That's expiration volatility. Now if we go
3887.32s: into the strike, you'll notice we also have implied volatility for every single strike. Each strike
3895.24s: gets its own vault. The other thing you'll notice is that if we look at the underlying itself,
3903.32s: you'll see that there is implied volatility. The underlying itself also has its own vault.
3910.44s: So there's these different measures of volatility across different places. It actually creates what
3916.04s: we refer to as a volatility surface. And it's kind of like a 3D model. I don't want to do 3D with
3921.32s: my hands, maybe something like that. And it has essentially volatility charted across
3928.36s: different days to expiration, across different strike prices. And it lets you visualize
3935.16s: any areas that might be slightly elevated relative to others slightly lower. But volatility is
3941.48s: very informative for us. So, volatility is also something you can trade directly, which I actually
3949.08s: think we spent quite a bit of time on, actually. What did I just do that move this?
3956.52s: Oh, I added, I was like, why is this now overlapping? It didn't be there.
3963.08s: Now the other thing you can do is assess volatility relative to itself in individual products.
3968.44s: And we looked at this last time. So I think we can brush over that point for here.
3972.12s: This is looking at volatility a little more zoomed in. We talked about the Greeks last time.
3979.40s: This, I don't think I showed to you guys last time I added it in. I'm pretty sure afterwards.
3984.60s: But this shows you the behavior of kind of some of the primary Greeks. I don't have row in here,
3990.68s: because it really doesn't matter that much. And how some of these Greeks behave with respect to
3996.20s: things like strike price, delta, and time. So a couple notes here, really high level.
4002.60s: For days to expiration, you'll notice that theta decay, then amount of extrinsic value,
4007.40s: kind of the inverse, how much decays out of extrinsic value.
4010.84s: theta decay really starts to accelerate as we close within 60 days. This is actually why I
4017.40s: typically will buy options outside of 60 days. Now there's drawbacks to that. If you get a big move
4025.48s: in it, you're at a low delta. You're not going to see as much of a move because of gamma.
4030.60s: Gamma is higher as we get low. So let's take a look. If we take a look at gamma out here for an
4041.40s: at the money option 30 days out, it's 0.3 gamma. And if we go four days out and we go to the same
4047.40s: out of the money option, it's 0.11 much, much higher. Why is that the case? Because every single
4054.92s: option that is coming up on expiration, which is perfect. We have an expiration here. Every single
4059.64s: option has to make a choice. Either it's going to be in the money and have a delta of one, or it's
4065.56s: going to be out of the money and have a delta of zero. Gamma assesses the rate of change of delta.
4071.56s: So as we get closer to expiration, gamma is going to get jacked up because all of these options
4077.88s: have to make that choice. So delta is going to be approximating to either a one or a zero
4083.00s: in the money and out of the money respectively. So that's why it's slightly elevated, well,
4091.24s: it gets steeply elevated as we get closer in time. So the punchline here is you have to spend some
4098.20s: time getting familiar with the Greeks because it's not so much the Greeks don't help you. The Greeks
4103.80s: don't hurt you. The Greeks don't give a shit about you. But they help you inform, make an
4111.80s: informed decision on what kind of position you're going to put on and what kind of risk-reward
4117.08s: profile you want that position to have. That's exactly why understanding the Greeks is super,
4123.08s: super important. There's no superpower within the Greeks. It's not going to save you from, you know,
4127.72s: losing a bunch of money if your strategy has no edge. The Greeks are not going to do any of that for
4131.48s: you. People, I think, have this really weird perception of the Greeks and it's not like the
4136.68s: Greek gods. They're just the Greeks. And fun fact actually, some of these aren't even actually
4142.36s: Greek. We just call them the Greeks. Anyways, if you have any questions on these, let me know,
4147.72s: because this kind of stuff is actually really important, but it's something that you have to spend
4152.04s: some time looking at. One of the recommendations I would have for you is to go through an
4157.16s: options chain and open up an Excel sheet and literally take a look at at least delta gamma theta
4169.16s: Vega and look at them across four different explorations. That's plenty. That will give you a
4176.04s: pretty good idea of how they behave and it will become very informative to you. So I think
4181.64s: that's a really, really good exercise to go through. This already showed to you guys.
4188.44s: Okay, so this I think I added this is a ton of different option structures and a quick recap
4194.92s: of what they are. I think I showed you guys these already, but then did I show you guys these?
4202.44s: I might have, but then I also add the P and all graph for them. So I'll kind of flip through
4207.72s: the, oh, it's Africa. This is a video. I'm so stupid sometimes. I was going to say I'll flip
4211.08s: through kind of slowly. You could take a screenshot, but newsflash, this is a video. So you literally
4215.64s: can go back at any point in time. I'm not going to linger on any of these for too long unless
4219.16s: there's one that you're interested in. We learned about long calls before, which is essentially we
4224.04s: want something to go up. Now, as we saw before, you don't actually need it to go up to your long
4232.12s: strike. Super, super important. You just need to go up for a short call. You want something to go
4239.88s: down. And essentially, you have a little bit of extra room on a short call. Now, this is also
4247.24s: one of the reasons why I highly, yeah, you can see it. I highly recommend that book options as a
4253.48s: strategic investment because it breaks down all of these. And I'm sure you can get it from
4258.44s: Investopedia as well, like what the break evens are and stuff like that. It's all good to know.
4263.24s: But across all of them, let's just use these calls and puts or calls for an example real quick.
4268.84s: Let's buy this one. We can get rid of all these other sample trades. And then let's sell this one as
4277.32s: well. And then we'll take a look at some different scenarios. The first thing. Notice these two
4286.04s: different lines. It's important to understand the difference between these. This purple line is
4291.08s: today. The blue line is at expiration. Very important to differentiate these. The reason why it's
4298.52s: so important to differentiate is because options decay over time. So as time passes, this purple line
4306.92s: will approximate to the blue line. So let's say, for example, we get a really small move. And let's
4314.44s: say IWM goes up to 253. In that here, you would make $112. But if it doesn't move again and it stays
4323.56s: there and you continue to hold it, this purple line would approximate to this blue line. So you
4328.44s: actually your profit would then decay away into nothing. And you would have a losing position at
4334.36s: this point. The notice says, where can I find the Greek behavior charts need a poster for my wall?
4339.80s: Yeah. You can grab a screenshot from that one I flashed up earlier. For the Patreon members,
4346.12s: I give them that one that I made in Excel. Or I think it's a Google sheet just so that they can
4351.24s: have as a reference. But yeah, I mean, I think this is the, this is the way to live your life.
4355.96s: Just let everybody know that you worship the Greeks.
4363.96s: Oh, yeah. The other thing I want to highlight though is when we're buying single options and it
4369.40s: doesn't really matter if it's single, which is kind of easier to start with singles. When you're
4373.72s: buying a call, your break even price is your strike price plus the premium you pay. When you buy a
4383.24s: put, it's strike less break even price. The reason being is you have to think of it moving in the
4389.64s: direction that you want. Now, Samoah says meant the four visuals. Oh, I already told you dog,
4396.76s: that's for you to make. There's, there's a reason why I don't give you guys every component
4404.12s: out there. It's because I cannot overemphasize how valuable I think going through the exercises are.
4411.96s: So for you, Samoah, if you want to use a screenshot as like a reference, that's, that's completely
4415.96s: cool, completely cool. But you should make your own. Like you absolutely should make your own.
4421.08s: It's an annoying process. But this is, this is the world of trading. If doing stuff like this is
4427.64s: super off-putting, trading is not going to be a good fit because it's a lot of small little due
4432.68s: diligence work like this. And what I can promise you is if you go through that exercise, you will have
4438.20s: a much, much deeper relationship with those Greeks. Then if you just grab a screenshot from
4444.36s: somewhere else and print it out, hands down, I guarantee it. So anyways, back to this.
4452.28s: If we take a look at the 199 calls and the strike price here, actually let's pick something
4461.08s: that's further out of the money for the example. Let's say you picked the two tens. I'm going to
4465.32s: unlock this price. So right now in this scenario, IWM is trading for 198. Fiddy. And our
4474.28s: strike price on the calls 210. I already told you it doesn't need to go to your strike price
4479.56s: in order to make money. The 210 strike is right here. At 210, you would be making money for sure.
4485.32s: But notice that you actually start making money as soon as it starts moving in your direction.
4489.96s: So it can go from 198. Fiddy to 200. And you're up 33 bucks. Now you are fighting theta decay.
4498.60s: As time passes, this purple line is going to approximate to the blue line, but you're up money
4502.44s: already. It's just another common really common misconception for long options. You don't need
4507.40s: the underlying to go to your strike. That's just the ideal scenario, actually, to go above your strike
4512.28s: or below your strike if it's a long put. But it doesn't have to get there in order for you to make money.
4516.60s: Because remember, you can always trade the option. Now if we take a look at short options,
4521.96s: this one for an example is a short call. Your break even is slightly different because you collect
4530.44s: money upfront. So because we collect that credit when we sell to open, you actually have a little
4536.60s: bit of a buffer in your position. So in this case, we're short the 199 call. That means we want
4543.00s: IWM. Oh man, I just realized what I did. We can't use IWM for this. I'm not saying you're trying
4548.04s: to talk about shorting IWM. Let's use hood. Fuck Robin Hood. Yeah, this is better. This is better
4555.80s: for everybody. I think I can't believe you guys were about to let me commit sacrilege there. That
4560.44s: was about to be pretty messed up. All right. So now that we're fading Robin Hood, which is completely
4567.96s: okay and always on the table. Look at this falling down from that cliff. Die. I hope it just crashes.
4575.24s: And we're short now the 22 call, which is right here. Right now Robin Hood somehow magically is
4583.24s: above 22 and it's at 2243. We actually want it below this, but notice where our break even is
4590.92s: all the way out here at 2288. So in this case, it is really, really important when you are selling
4600.60s: credits. You have the benefit of receiving a small buffer. If you're buying things, you need things
4607.72s: to move enough to cover the cost of whatever you paid in the direction you want. That's quite literally
4613.88s: the easiest way to think about break even calculations. If you're selling things, you get a pad against
4621.40s: the direction you don't want it to go. So again, if we're selling a call, we want this to go down.
4626.76s: Of course, it's Robin Hood. We always want it to go down. But if it doesn't go down, you still get
4633.00s: a pad equivalent to the credit you receive. So in this case, it can go against you, meaning up,
4639.16s: God forbid, for Robin Hood, you can go up all the way to 2288 and you would still be at your break
4645.88s: even. But again, this is at expiration. So your option would be showing a loss until it gets
4654.52s: closer to expiration. So if you take a look in this bottom left corner over here, you'll see the
4659.40s: two different dates and then you'll see the two different prices. So let's say Robin Hood rallied
4665.24s: and it goes up to again, 2288. If you held that all the way to expiration, it would be break even.
4672.60s: But until then, it would first show a loss of down 3246. And then as time passes, again, this purple
4681.40s: line approximates to the blue line. So, Moda says, do I need to understand calculations? Yeah,
4688.36s: I think you do for these. These are fundamental enough that it's important to know. And again,
4693.40s: it's quite literally as simple as I kind of outlined it before. If you're entering a trade via a
4701.40s: debit or verticals and stuff like that, you need something to move in your favor plus the debit.
4708.68s: If you've sold an option, you get a buffer against you strike with the premium, whether it's a
4716.36s: caller putt depends on whether you add or sell it. That's the way I think about it.
4720.52s: For other strategies like butterflies and stuff like that, it's different, right? Because they
4724.28s: have completely different risk profiles, which you'll see in a second. But for the directional
4729.32s: stuff that will essentially carry you through pretty carefully. So these are now long puts, short puts.
4741.40s: This is incorrect.
4745.96s: Elite. So if we take a look at a short put, just to just to get us right, let me go here to spy.
4757.48s: And let's take a peak at like this 30 delta short put and a live trade.
4763.16s: So a short put is a bullish trade. I think I probably just forgot to swap it out.
4768.76s: I'll add this one in for us now. So the short put, we want it to go up. And I think in this
4776.84s: scenario, I probably just forgot to switch it. But here you go. Long put, we want stuff to go down.
4787.48s: Short put, we want it to go up. Calculating the break evens is the same process for the calls.
4793.56s: Long put, you needed to go in your direction plus the W paid at expiration or put you get a
4799.72s: buffer if it moves against you, which would be down. Any questions on these single options to start.
4808.76s: Long calls, short calls, long puts, short puts. And while you're ruminating on that,
4815.80s: I'm just going to let the dog out super fast.
4823.56s: He was very excited to see what movements were going on out there.
4833.80s: So what it says, I meant calculus in order to make the four visuals on the green charts.
4838.28s: No, no, no, no, no. So that calculus that you're referring to that literally just helps you
4843.96s: understand the way that the Greeks behave. But think about what you're doing, right?
4850.68s: Think about the process I'm kind of somewhat forcing you to do, I guess.
4857.16s: Is if we take a look at spy and let's say that you come into again, those three or four
4863.16s: explorations, let's say that you go out a week and you go out to 21 June. And you literally just
4870.52s: create a Google sheet with these columns, delta, gamma, theta, Vega, and just pick a handful of
4877.88s: strikes, pick like a 50 delta, 75 delta, a one delta, same thing to the other direction.
4883.56s: And then just write the numbers down and say, and then literally you can plot them, right?
4887.48s: Because you're inputting the data directly from the the options chain.
4894.20s: Andre says, how do you make a long put to short the stock?
4901.00s: The motor says, okay, I thought the variance would screw it up. Oh, it definitely will. You need to
4905.32s: try to, you need to normalize to some sort of, you need to normalize to something. So like,
4911.96s: you can anchor off of delta. That's a really easy anchor point. So then you can reference everything
4917.56s: relative to delta. That's why those charts have slightly different configurations. Because
4924.84s: if it's isolated off of delta, off of time, there's difference between those.
4930.68s: Andre says, how do you make a long put to short the stock? Yeah, great question.
4934.84s: So if I want to buy a put to trade something to the downside, kind of similar rules I follow
4940.36s: as compared to buying options, buying options is simple. I normally will go beyond 60 days,
4945.56s: at least if it's a shorter term thesis, you can creep it in a little bit. But again, if you remember
4951.16s: actually that graph that we're kind of referring to right now, you don't want to creep it in too
4956.12s: far because then you're going to start losing theta to case super, super fast. So maybe we go out
4960.76s: to this 63 16 August. And the delta selection is literally the same process with respect to
4967.64s: if we go in the money at a higher delta out of the money. That's all completely predicated on how
4972.52s: big of a move we think we're going to get. So let's say that we go kind of right at the money,
4977.32s: something like this, the 545s. So in this case, literally you can hit buyer sell. It kind of
4983.24s: doesn't matter. It just changes the interface when it pops up. But in this case, you can hit buy.
4988.36s: I always would go for the midpoint at least to start. So it's a slightly more favorable price to
4993.64s: you. And then you launch that order. Now you would essentially have a position with this risk profile.
5001.32s: You would want it to go down. And you need to have risk management in place for the strategy. So
5007.00s: whatever risk management you tend to apply to stuff like this for directional trading for me personally,
5012.76s: it's generally predicated off of some sort of technical analysis. So let's say using spy. Let's say
5019.16s: I wanted to fade this to the downside, which I probably wouldn't hear. But let's say I did.
5023.56s: Then I would essentially set some sort of stop on the chart that makes sense based on the way that I'm
5029.48s: analyzing the chart. And if it hits that stop, I would use that as my point to enter the trade or
5035.24s: exit the trade. Sorry. But that's essentially a cliff notes version on how to open a long put to trade
5045.40s: a stock to the downside. And let's get back to this. So single options. These are vertical spreads.
5054.44s: I don't trade them too much, but there's nothing wrong with them for a newer trader. It's just
5057.72s: nothing that I would want to get stuck on for too long. They're difficult to make money on. But
5062.04s: you'll notice that they have the similar profit zone as its single option counterpart. So long call
5068.92s: spread versus a long call. But it adds a leg to define the risk. So it also decreases the amount of
5076.12s: capital that you need. Andre says, if you're scalping, would you go one week out? No. And again,
5081.72s: scalping is really important to define because retail traders typically don't scalp algos or scalping,
5087.08s: meaning moving super, super fast retail traders, typically or day trading, but going with the
5091.88s: colloquial use of scalping totally cool. But if I'm trading something intraday, I'm not going to
5096.60s: go out a week. That's way too long. I might and if it's not something I'm planning on holding for
5100.92s: multiple days, I might literally trade that same day. But I rarely will try to scalp options. I will
5107.16s: have intraday trades, but I think people think scalping is a lower risk, higher probability way of
5113.56s: making trades, but realistically, it's just a way for retail traders to more or less get screwed
5118.36s: over because you're transacting so frequently in such a high friction environment, meaning it's
5124.04s: very expensive for retail to trade more. So then you probably realize that it's very difficult to
5129.08s: make a bunch of money that way. So it's not my go to personally. There might be another, again,
5133.88s: that's me, right? So there might be other entities that are super, super successful doing that.
5138.92s: And I would probably tap into them a little bit more so than me. It's just very different than what
5144.20s: I do. I trade every day and I trade things intraday, but that's not my primary go to at all.
5151.64s: But verticals kind of same thing to downside. These are straddles and strangles. So the way to think
5158.04s: about straddles and strangles, they're more specific to attempting to trade volatility. So what we
5163.96s: want to see is different expressions of volatility specifically for straddles, which is if we're long
5171.08s: as straddle, as you can tell, we don't care which way it moves. We just want it to move in a direction,
5177.80s: not chop around right in the middle and not go anywhere. So this is a volatility play an expansion
5183.64s: because remember, volatility is just an expression of movement. How much does something move? It's
5188.68s: variance that's time bound for a short straddle. As you can imagine, it's the exact inverse. We want
5195.24s: something to stay within a range in this scenario. We are betting that volatility implied will be higher
5203.08s: than realized volatility, meaning it won't move as much. And then strangles are essentially the same
5210.20s: slightly different structure as you could tell it's less of a pinpoint and it kind of has this
5215.32s: tabletop surface to it. That's because rather than going at the money for both strikes, you're now
5221.80s: going to out of the money. The motive says if you express the straddle in a way other than
5231.32s: BTO put in call, do you still call it a straddle? Could you give me an example of what you mean?
5235.56s: You can have a long straddle or a short straddle. Long straddle is if you buy the at the money,
5245.88s: same strike, put in call. The short straddle is if you sell the at the money, same strike, put in call.
5253.88s: Technically, you could do it at a different strike, but it's most often done at the money.
5260.28s: Let me know if that answers if you have a different question there.
5268.76s: So the way to think about long straddles, long strangles is you want something to move,
5275.48s: and then short straddles, short strangles, you want something to stay relatively put.
5282.36s: Now, these are essentially the risk-defined versions of straddles and strangles,
5287.56s: just like I showed you long call, long put, short call, short put, and then vertical spreads.
5293.08s: It's kind of the same thing that I'm doing here. So this is adding legs to straddles and strangles
5298.52s: when we go to iron butterflies and iron condors. The names are terrible. They're all supernabulous.
5306.60s: You get a feel for them over time. That's why I put it in like a little chart here to make it
5310.52s: easier to understand. But as you can see for something like a butterfly, again, you just want it to move.
5317.08s: And for a short iron butterfly, you just don't want it to move. This is a straddle that has wings
5323.16s: purchased. And then if you look at an iron condor, it's the same thing. You just want the thing to
5328.92s: move either direction, but it will have defined risk as well these. For the short iron condor,
5336.36s: you just want it to stay put within a range, but you're buying the wings.
5340.28s: And then these are kind of my personal strategies. These are my go-to's. So the vast majority of the
5347.64s: time I'm trading, it is something from here. The overwhelming majority of what I do is in here.
5354.60s: So I add the payoff diagrams for all of these so that you have a sense of how these work.
5360.92s: So, notice says, long shares at a profit by puts at a strike above your basis, above your share count,
5373.64s: at a quantity above your share count. In 700 shares at 20,
5384.20s: I'm super confused. That just looks like a protective put.
5388.76s: But if your long shares in buying a put, it's just a protective put. That's not a straddle.
5398.92s: Yeah, what you're showing there is a type of protective put.
5405.48s: And then, the motive says, but it's uncapped downside. Yeah, it doesn't mean that your hedge
5412.60s: one to one. So if you're saying that you're buying the put above your share count, I mean,
5417.64s: let's look at an example. So if we take a look at what did you say? Your long 700 shares. So we buy
5427.80s: 700. Lies. Get red. Get red. And then you bought something that was like
5449.24s: $20 on a line. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. It looks the same one model. Yeah, definitely.
5454.92s: So the reason why it looks the same is because they're essentially synthetics, depending on what
5460.04s: Delta it is, right? A long call is going to look just like long shares. So if I grab this 50 delta
5466.04s: long call and we add it, it's synthetically the same thing. The difference is it will have
5474.76s: cap downside because it's a long call, but it'll have the same overall slope as long shares.
5482.04s: Now if you're adding short puts, then it becomes synthetically the same thing.
5487.00s: Okay, call it a synthetic straddle. No, no, no, no, I wouldn't call it a synthetic straddle at all.
5490.52s: It's not a synthetic straddle. I literally just call it a, it's a just protective put.
5496.20s: So even though in your scenario, you still have downside risk, it will decrease your downside risk.
5503.08s: So in your example, you had something you're saying the $20 underlying was at $25.
5509.24s: So in this example, we would have already bought spy, which is trading at $25.42. Let's say we got
5515.32s: it cheaper to follow along with your scenario and we're in the profit. So let's say instead of
5521.80s: getting it at $5.42, we got it at $5.35. Like that. And then you're saying we bought to open 10
5532.20s: of the, the money puts. So which would be the current price. So these,
5537.56s: they'll buy these and we'll buy 10. And we take a look. So in this case,
5549.40s: you're essentially creating a position that you have a really small risk here, but the reason
5555.96s: why it's a protective put is because it's taking the risk off of your long shares. So if this goes
5562.20s: down in this scenario because you're, you're adding more puts, you actually have profit potential
5568.68s: if it goes in your direction. But the overall premise behind these puts is you could call it a
5574.20s: married put if you don't like the term protective put. That's also fine. But yeah, it's literally just
5579.16s: long stock long put is the easiest way to think about it.
5586.92s: Yeah.
5588.20s: And when it says my long position is at profit and put strike is at profit. So line starts above zero.
5593.56s: Yeah, that's totally cool. It's and that's kind of the idea behind a protective put, right?
5598.60s: Is you're trying to protect the value of your shares. Now the downside to this kind of position,
5605.08s: it well, it all depends on your management. I don't want to get super far down the rabbit hole.
5609.32s: But it's not riskless inherently unless you're trading it as one position. That's important to
5616.04s: so if you're going to keep your shares and not use like let's say for example, just let's say
5621.72s: this moves to here and it falls down to five 23. If you don't move the entire position,
5629.24s: what would happen is on your puts, they would be in the profit you would make money. Now the
5634.44s: inverse would happen if it goes up. So let's say it goes up to five 60 and you still want to keep
5639.48s: your shares because up to five 60 and you don't sell your shares, you're eating that entire loss
5645.72s: on your long puts. So there's nothing wrong with that kind of strategy, but it's really important
5650.52s: to be thoughtful about how you choose to manage it because you can start building stupid losses
5655.40s: that aren't being offset by realized positions. Andre says, how long would you keep a protective put
5662.28s: on? I personally wouldn't use protective puts. So the way you would kind of think about that,
5670.44s: though, is for the duration of the risk you're trying to cover. One of the biggest issues retail
5677.08s: traders can have is becoming too adverse to risk in trying to hedge all of it away.
5683.80s: If you hedge too much risk away, you are literally hedging your profit opportunity away at the same time.
5689.80s: You're decreasing your profit massively. So I much prefer to size trades and decrease
5696.68s: risk via sizing and then via trade management as compared to structurally decreasing it by adding
5703.00s: more legs to it. It just decreases the overall profitability of the strategy in the long run
5708.68s: and you're adding more legs. So again, back to that cost thing, that's a little bit nefarious.
5715.96s: So personally, I wouldn't run them with them on, but if you wanted to for some reason,
5721.96s: that's totally fine. But you have to define how much of your upside or total profitability you're
5727.72s: willing to sacrifice for that and then how long you need the protection on the longer the protection
5733.32s: has on the more expensive it is. This is just about how I think about managing a portfolio.
5741.32s: And I kind of use this top down approach. This is probably a good, oh no, we're essentially
5746.60s: done with this thing. Yeah, okay, cool. So I think we just wrap us up. We only have a few left.
5753.72s: So the way I think about managing a portfolio is starting with literally a really broad perspective
5759.72s: and then narrowing it down and making sure that my portfolio fits how I think about the stock market
5765.64s: as it sits now and literally how that fits against the economy as it sits now. And then the individual
5772.68s: positions I put on need to make sense in the context of all of that proceeding information.
5779.08s: So I split my portfolio into two different allocations. I have a core allocation and then I have
5784.76s: a speculative allocation. The purpose of the core allocation is that's really where I'm trying to
5790.04s: generate my annual returns. The speculative allocation is kind of where I'm looking to I take
5795.88s: advantage of opportunities. Not quite as discreet as that. Right now, a lot of my capital is tied up
5802.28s: in my speculative allocation that is driving returns. That's because sometimes some years,
5808.44s: the core allocation will be performing more slowly. So because of that, I rotate more capital and I
5814.92s: look more intensively for speculative opportunity. A couple other things I want to highlight from here
5823.16s: specifically are these two. And I already talked about this one. It's vital to create an approach that
5828.92s: aligns with you as a trader worth reiterating. This one, I cannot overemphasize enough either.
5834.60s: Blanket rules in trading generally are stupid, which is kind of funny because that's a blanket rule.
5841.32s: Take profits. That's not a good answer. Never risk more than blank percent of your capital in one
5848.84s: trade. That's also not a good answer. The reason why it's not a good answer is because everything
5854.60s: you're doing within your strategies needs to make sense when we're analyzing the expected return,
5862.36s: the expected performance of that strategy over a specific time frame. So if I look up,
5868.28s: I'm going to grab a video for you guys that walks through expected return way more in depth there
5873.96s: that you could take a look. But the whole idea here is it can't be oh yeah, I'm just going to take
5880.44s: profits. I don't want to keep that risk out. And then if you run a portfolio like that, you will
5885.72s: find it's too inconsistent to actually make money long term because you are so set in your own
5892.36s: discretion that sometimes you will make decisions differently in different time frames. And then
5899.00s: you can't model that long term. So this long term modeling is super, super important. And I'll share
5907.00s: another couple of videos. This one is a new one that I actually think is kind of important for people.
5912.44s: And that one is how to create a consistently profitable trading strategy. And it walks through
5917.40s: essentially this process way more in depth. But I think that that is worth the conversation.
5928.04s: Someone says no correlation between risk and position size. Your risk of losing one dollar on a
5933.64s: billion dollar tips position is smaller than your risk of losing one dollar holding one share of
5942.76s: Jimmy. Again, I get your point, but it's that's like it's trying to find an example that refutes
5952.12s: the concept because even in your tips position, there is risk. Now to your point, the relative risk
5959.40s: there is different, but you can't have a unilateral view of risk. There's opportunity cost.
5965.80s: That is a risk to the returns of your portfolio. So I get your point and I follow you, but I wouldn't
5973.80s: try to essentially just find things like that to have a talking point. There absolutely is a
5980.36s: correlation between risk and position size. Again, there are scenarios where it could not be on a
5986.84s: relative basis. But even that one billion dollar tips position still has risk. And it has a billion
5994.60s: dollars in some sort of commensurate risk compared to the one dollar in GME. So I agree with you,
6001.96s: I understand the point that you're trying to make there. But they're to essentially say something
6009.08s: like there's no correlation between risk and position size is not super logical. Because if we
6016.76s: look at now as comparing two different strategies and we actually compare what we're talking about,
6023.24s: risk and position size, not relative risk based on beta, but risk and position size. If I buy
6033.24s: 700 shares of spy versus five 300 shares of spy, same trade, same position, same product,
6043.08s: position size is a direct correlation on risk.
6047.00s: So it's actually really important to not get too wrapped up. So I've noticed that sure in the same
6052.60s: product, of course, of course, that's when we're making comparisons like that are saying about
6058.04s: correlations, you have to control for those things, right? That's the entire point of identifying
6064.68s: correlations is you're isolating something and then assessing something else to determine what
6071.48s: that behavior is. Again, to your point, I agree with you. Different products can have different
6077.08s: relative risk. Like if we were to chart the risk, if you were to put a thousand dollars in GameStop
6084.12s: versus a thousand dollars in spy, very different risk profiles. But that doesn't remove the size
6092.12s: component to the equation. It's still absolutely a component.
6095.00s: Jay says, is there a way to quantify the probability of success for a strategy position? It's a great
6101.00s: question. Jay, you are on this, man. I love your questions. So definitely. And some of it will
6107.80s: depend on your strategy. And let's use a couple examples. Let's say I'm trading in video.
6116.20s: And look at that candle. And let's say I think in video is going to go up. Well, let's say you
6122.36s: first would need to say, OK, I think it's going to go up for whatever reason. Let's say you're doing
6127.24s: a momentum following strategy or a breakout strategy. Let's say that you're using this most recent
6132.52s: 125 55 handle as resistance. And let's say that you were using this breakout day to enter. So you
6139.16s: got in now at 128, 129, whatever. And it's starting to drift up. So you then have to make some
6145.96s: assumptions about where you think this might go relative to where you where you entered. A lot of
6151.40s: times it's easier to use like a really long term reference. If there is one, if there's not one,
6157.16s: then you kind of have to come up with your own an easy way to do that to determine how far do I
6162.36s: think this is going to go is you can use options for this. So if we go to this, you can then model
6170.20s: where you think Nvidia might go with a different confidence interval based on different time frames.
6177.16s: So this is exactly how you can say, all right, if I think Nvidia is going to go up, what's the
6182.04s: probability that it goes up within 40 days? The probability and let's do a touch because we don't
6188.20s: care if it stays in the money. The probability of it touching, let's say 142 is 57%. There's your
6196.04s: probability of hitting 146. So you can use options again, even to inform directional targets.
6203.96s: So that's essentially the system that I would run for directional trades to start. That's a very simple
6208.76s: one for options. It's kind of baked into the option. So if you're selling an option, let's say that
6213.96s: you think Nvidia instead is going to go down and you want to sell calls. Well, you can come out here
6218.92s: to the 30 delta and you could say, okay, the probability of these 30 delta calls getting touched is 47.13%.
6226.12s: The probability of them being in the money is 22.8%. Well, if you're going to apply early management
6231.16s: based on them being touched, you obviously need to use this 40% 47% number. Not if it doesn't expire
6239.00s: in the money, which right now is 22.8%. But let's say instead your approach is going to be to not do
6245.40s: anything until it goes all the way to expiration. Well, then you can use the 22.8% understanding that
6252.44s: they're likely will be a period that they would be underwater, almost to the tune of 50%, not quite
6257.80s: 50%, but pretty close. So yeah, you should be able to quantify essentially the way that you're
6263.88s: setting all of these different. Jay says, would you use that information to inform your allocation,
6270.44s: how much you're willing to risk in the position to keep your relative to your available cash. Another
6274.28s: great question. That's based more on portfolio management and actually that video that I shared above
6280.92s: about building a strategy will go directly into capital management on that. But that's another great
6287.00s: question. Essentially, the way I think about what gets money in my account is based on what the
6295.16s: portfolio needs. I take again, not a position first approach. I take a portfolio overhead approach.
6302.68s: So sometimes I need long deltas, even if I have super high conviction in something, if I don't need
6307.32s: a bunch of long deltas, I'm not going to oversized in my long deltas, that kind of thing. And that's
6312.04s: using something called beta weighted deltas, which I will share with you here, which helps a lot
6322.04s: with subsequent sizing. All right, you all. Man, hour 45 minutes in on a Friday. Thank you guys
6331.40s: for hanging out. I have a blast talking about this stuff. It is time for me to go. However,
6335.72s: please like, subscribe, share. It does help the channel grow. And I'm looking to do that as best as
6339.96s: I can connect more people together. And we will have another beginner workshop next week.
6344.92s: It'll probably a little bit more shorter. I think I'm going to go a little more Q and A on that
6349.32s: one since we got through a lot of the core content. So in the meantime, think of your questions.
6353.96s: What kind of stuff do you want to dig into on the next session? I think it would make sense to
6358.12s: start thinking about analyzing kind of that profit. Let me see. Do I still have this up for you?
6364.92s: Yeah, I do. The way I think your next steps would look like is this right here.
6371.24s: I think we should start talking about this next week. So take a look at how you intend to do this.
6378.52s: And I think we should have some questions to talk about next week on that. As always, feel free
6385.56s: to join the discord. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
