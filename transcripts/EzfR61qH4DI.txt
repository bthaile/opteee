0.00s: What about Liars? Quick market update. We have two things on the agenda for today. The
5.46s: first one is going to be Wells Fargo. The second one is going to be Adobe. And then I
10.88s: guess there's a third bonus item, which I want to take a look at GameStop because on
15.04s: the dark pool side of things, there are just a lot of transactions that I find slightly
20.52s: curious and topical that I want to share with you. So let's start with Wells Fargo. What's
24.34s: going on in here, the stock dropped 4% today for probably the most classic Wells Fargo
30.22s: reason on earth, which is it continues to break the law.
36.82s: It's kind of like part and parcel for Wells Fargo. It's one of the best reasons to be
42.26s: in Wells Fargo is because you know that they don't care about the rules that they're
46.78s: just going to kind of do whatever they want. They might open accounts to show account
50.82s: openings that don't exist. They might in this case not really care about their internal
55.42s: mechanisms that they need to fight financial crimes. They're just doing whatever they
60.98s: want out here. And you got a respective bank that somehow stays in business behind a
67.38s: litany of different investigations and pretty much continuing to get in trouble for breaking
73.14s: the law. I just I find a hilarious. So shout out to Wells Fargo for continuing to do whatever
78.94s: it is that they do. But right now they are in a steep decline, which funny enough, it's
83.66s: not super fortunate because I do have a long position right now in Bank of America.
87.58s: That's not exactly playing ball as I wanted. But the financial sector is a whole is starting
93.70s: to turn over a little bit here. So if we jump over to XLF, we can see that it's grabbing
99.70s: a bite, which is good. But you know, I want for a while, financials were really holding
105.98s: things up. But now it looks like it's rotating over a little bit. So yeah, got to love us
111.70s: some Wells Fargo news. We'll see where this one goes as always absolute blast. The next
117.94s: thing I want to take a look at is Adobe. And this is because it feeds into the broader tech
123.54s: picture. So they had earnings today after the close and they had a massive, massive beat.
132.70s: So if you take a look, they came in 363 was estimate 465 actual. And then let's take
138.64s: a look at the old Adobe price and it's closed at 586 and is trading at 532. Another
145.38s: example of where good is just not good enough. So if we take a look at some of the news here
154.02s: specifically in Adobe, there's a couple things that stuck out to me. First one is it crushed
160.72s: on revenue. So that seems great news. But this is one of the issues I think it didn't
167.72s: really like it being the market is the forecast. And again, I try to remind people when we're
173.24s: coming into earnings, forecasts are so important. And it's because we have a sense of the
180.04s: performance of a company coming into earnings. We can kind of see how they're broadly doing.
186.16s: But the forecast is new information to us. And it's the first time that we get a glimpse
192.68s: at how a company is expecting to perform for the remainder of the year for the next quarter.
197.40s: And that gets priced in pretty heavily. And you can see how tight these margins are, right?
202.56s: Because you can see that the company says it's forecasting 5.5 build a 5.55 for Q4. And
211.76s: it's just shy of 5.6. And they just don't like that. So these kind of softer forward guidance,
219.64s: I think is really important for us as both investors and traders. Because we've seen this
224.24s: in a few companies now and in technology companies specifically, we're getting to a really
229.40s: interesting part of the market where as we're coming up on rate cuts, which will be very
234.04s: soon, at least for the first round, those are generally priced in at this point. The market
238.92s: is trying now to figure out how do we proceed through this rate cut picture. And I think
243.16s: one of the bigger risks we have if we start cutting rates too fast, which it doesn't look
247.76s: like that's going to be the case upfront. We're still looking at a pretty conservative
251.16s: starting cycle at least. But right now to me, it looks like the market is grasping to
256.88s: see how this thing plays out like we all are very curious about. And the reason why I say
261.48s: grasping is because we have no period in history that's like a really close reference
268.36s: for what we've seen starting from the COVID drop, then the overall fiscal policy deployed
275.60s: by the Fed during that period to combat that drop. Like we've not seen what has happened
280.72s: before to this degree. So this is very much a first of its kind kind of scenario. So from
285.72s: a trading perspective, I continue to do what I always do, which is remain sensitive to
290.04s: current information trading the market as it is, not how I think the market should be.
295.12s: That leads us into the fan fave game stop. So a couple of things jump out to me here with
302.60s: the new offering. We can see that volume definitely has spiked over the last couple
308.40s: days. And part of this is also because of earnings, but a really big contraction in volume
313.96s: here. So I think right now a lot of people are curious how far does this go? When are
319.84s: we going to be done with the shares because that obviously will suppress price ever so
324.04s: slightly. But again, what I find most intriguing here is following its earnings release. We
330.76s: beat on earnings. We came down. We also have news of the offering and it's still holding
336.52s: tight here. This is not a new line that I've drawn at the 1981 handle. This has been here
341.40s: for some time. And I do think that this is kind of meaningful support at this point.
345.64s: We've been hitting it a few times recently. So we have to see how the overall behavior
352.84s: of game stop flows here. But again, I find myself looking at it the same way I typically
357.76s: look at it. Looks like we're coming into a more quiet period and it's quiet until it's
361.84s: not. So the other thing I wanted to take a look at with you is the options. So we haven't
366.20s: done this a little in a little while. So if we take a look at the overall volume for
371.92s: today, it's 119,000 against 54,000 calls to put so very, very quiet on a relative basis.
380.24s: But this strikes me different. There's 700,000 calls against 350,000 puts. That's a lot of
387.72s: calls. And it's still barely at a 2 to 1 ratio, which is good. But the other thing that
394.80s: I is very striking to me about the way that the options chain looks right now is that
399.96s: of those 700,000, the majority clearly is not in this front expiration. This front expiration
405.24s: is 146,000 of those. So it's a lot, but not all of them. And this represents a shift.
412.52s: What this shift ultimately means, I don't know yet. I have to keep an eye on it. But from
417.16s: an options trading perspective, I notice changes like this. And typically speaking when
422.92s: we're looking at the front expiration, we tend to see really, really heavy option, concentrated
428.52s: option value as a percentage of the total OI. That's not what I'm seeing right now.
433.52s: The other thing I'll notice, I'll point out is that there is decent exposure already
439.08s: in this 20-sep expiration, 135,000. That makes sense to me. 20-sep is the next primary
445.16s: expiration. Options are typically more liquid there. Very, very normal. So the main anomaly
450.32s: I see here is just the variance across all these different expiration cycles for the call
455.44s: side. I find that interesting. Not a direct takeaway just yet, but interesting. When I look
461.24s: at the overall volatility, we're still very front heavy, right? So we have 121% for this
469.00s: week. It drops down to 98, 96, 95, 95, 99. So obviously 18 ought becomes slightly interesting
479.00s: because that four point wall increase here, it could just be because this is the next
484.48s: primary expiration cycle. Or it could be that the market is starting to anticipate something
490.12s: coming out here. So that's an expiration cycle I'm keeping a close eye on because that
494.08s: is anomalous to go from 95, 95, 99, 95, essentially. That's strange. Then it plummets right after
502.68s: that to 69, get a backup to 90. So this is also really interesting to me. How soft the
508.92s: volatility is here so far in one no. So this continues to lead to a massive, massive host
515.80s: of crazy opportunities to trade relative volatility and something like GameStop. It's
521.32s: something that I've ran for some time now. We can see for the first time in some time that
526.84s: for the 20 step expiration, we have massive, massive call implied volatility skew. Again,
533.88s: normally you'll see the put side priced more heavily than the call side, but that's not
537.72s: what's happening right now. We're actually seeing everything out. Typically the 50s would
541.92s: be the highest still, but like this kink is tradable to there, to their relative to here.
547.68s: There's a lot of different ways that that can be traded. But the main note is that volatility
552.08s: as an outright asset class is very tradable in GameStop, even though the price so far has been
558.64s: a little bit slower going. All right. So the last thing I want to show you is what I alluded to
563.52s: at the beginning of the video. And it's this. We have almost 100 transactions today across the
572.80s: entire day separated by very, very little time frames if any of 5,000 share by blocks.
582.96s: And if we go back in time, I wanted to actually open this up a little bit and like let's look
588.00s: over the last month together and let's see what this looks like. So if we start,
594.48s: sorry, I want to do for the last 30 days, not last month, right? Here we go.
598.16s: So if we start from the 12th of September, you'll notice again that there's almost a hundred of
602.24s: these. That's a ton. And it's like throughout the entire day. So again, it's hard to tell who or
608.96s: what this is or what series of entities this is. There's never anybody that outright owns 5,000
616.80s: share contracts or not contracts purchases because this is shares, not options. Obviously,
622.32s: used to talking about options. But what I find most interesting is this. If we look, there's about 90
630.48s: high 90s here, then if we go to the 11th, we see that that's about cut in half ish. So the 11th,
638.16s: there's still a ton of them. If we go to the 10th, there's maybe a third of that. There's much less.
643.76s: Then if we go to the ninth, even less still, we go to the sixth, it opens back up. The fifth,
649.20s: like none, fourth, like none, will not like none, but very far less. So what I'm highlighting is that
655.12s: this is ungelating. These purchases are ungelating. And I can't quite put my finger on why.
661.68s: There's no real answer to this. It's very difficult to tell is to why we're moving in 5,000
668.16s: share blocks because here's the other thing I find interesting is that if we sort this by size,
673.92s: we can move way more. If somebody wanted to take all of those 5,000 share blocks and
679.92s: essentially throw them at once or twice or three times, meaning across a few orders, they can,
684.32s: if they're so inclined. Because if you look at this, the size that we're trading for the larger
690.72s: positions here, 150,000, 145,000, 100,000, even, 93, 87, so on and so forth. So there's really big
696.32s: transactions flowing through here, no problem. So the fact that there's so many of those at the
700.64s: five, I find just interesting because I also don't see that same kind of repeat buying behavior
707.60s: in any other relative size so far. So yeah, hard to say is per usual, but something I just can't
715.84s: help but find interesting. And that's one of the things I try to do for all of us here on the
721.04s: channel is find things that look interesting to me and that does look interesting. I don't have it
725.12s: there at conclusion yet. Perhaps we can dive a little bit further into it on the GME live stream
729.76s: on Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific time, looking forward to that actually. We have a couple things to
733.68s: get into, which is the rest of roaring kiddie's old trades. We have maybe about a quarter to a third
739.68s: left of them to go last week and we got super far in detail on them, which I'm actually pretty excited
744.48s: to get back into those. That was very fun. So yeah, interesting stock behavior, generally quiet
751.04s: options behavior. And it is a continue to monitor for me right now. I am trading it very conservatively.
759.52s: I've already told those, I think it was during the live session, I've already paired down my stock
764.16s: position a little bit. And it was just because of essentially we're getting to a decent spot,
768.88s: I was making okay money based on what I had. And then this is kind of like an accumulation zone
773.36s: depending on how it behaves. But for me, I will always continue to remind everybody like I'm a
777.76s: trader, I participate in holding game stop stock to participate because I like the community and
783.28s: I want to support it. But this is not where I know a lot of people are parking like all of their
787.84s: money. It's not even close for me. And it's simply because I trade the markets differently. And I
793.76s: have to my livelihood. So yeah, interesting thing to follow along though, I am really eager to see
799.36s: how it handles kind of this high 19 low 20 handle and see what it doesn't hear, especially when
806.24s: the offering a baits. And then I want to see if we start springing from there.
810.40s: T B D also still waiting to hear if we get any guidance soon on what the master plan is behind
818.32s: the capital that's raised. Still very, very eager to hear that as well. So as always, anything
823.12s: I should look at let me know be an outlier. See you all later.
