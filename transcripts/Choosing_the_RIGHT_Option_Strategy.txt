0.00s: what's up everybody I'm gonna explain to
2.10s: you exactly how I go about selecting
4.68s: what option strategy I'm going to apply
7.50s: when and it's because one of the biggest
10.14s: changes I made to my trading it was
12.12s: revolutionary was not attempting to
15.00s: always trade one or two strategies
17.40s: because the market doesn't care about
20.22s: what strategy you like the market is
22.62s: going to do whatever the Market's going
23.82s: to do so it's on us as traders to
26.58s: develop a toolkit that allows us to take
29.34s: advantage of the current market
30.90s: condition so I'm going to walk you
32.10s: through How I build this process to
34.68s: determine what option strategy I want to
36.60s: use at the end of the video I'm going to
38.16s: walk you through exactly what option
40.44s: strategies I use in various market
42.78s: conditions to give you some ideas to
44.58s: start with so what's up everybody Eric
46.02s: here welcome back to all of the outliers
48.42s: a huge shout out to the patreon family
50.16s: and YouTube members thank you guys for
51.54s: the support you make videos like this
53.04s: possible and with that let's get right
55.56s: into the details so the very first thing
57.18s: you're going to notice here is process
58.26s: driven this is by Design most of what I
60.00s: do has a process involved and it's
62.94s: because it allows me to be more
64.56s: efficient and I reduce the variance what
67.14s: do I mean by reduce the variance well it
69.36s: lets me identify what works in what
71.58s: market conditions because sometimes if
73.74s: you buy stock in scenario a and then
76.62s: scenario a pops up again and then you
78.42s: buy an out of the money call and then
80.16s: scenario a pops up again and then you
81.78s: buy it deep in the money call and then
83.52s: scenario a pops again and then you sell
85.32s: a put if you don't figure out which one
87.54s: of those works best in scenario a we're
89.82s: wasting a lot of time so the idea here
91.74s: is to figure out what works in what
93.48s: market conditions against your
95.34s: preferences as a Trader and then codify
97.50s: how we get there so for me personally
99.72s: there are two scenarios that I start
102.84s: with and what I mean by this is when I
105.00s: am searching for a trade this is the
106.92s: first scenario portfolio driven what I
109.68s: mean by this is as I'm reviewing my
112.62s: portfolio I'm seeing what I need and
115.86s: this is what I'm reviewing I have a
117.90s: video that goes through portfolio
119.22s: Management in depth so I'm not going to
121.08s: go through all of these here but these
122.76s: are some of the things that I take a
124.20s: look at so I'm going to look at the
125.46s: portfolio and I'm going to see do I need
127.62s: risk do I have too much risk do I have
129.84s: too much directional risk but not enough
132.36s: total risk I'm going to review the
135.06s: entire portfolio and then look at the
136.92s: end result to see what do I need to
138.96s: change here and if it's nothing the
141.18s: other scenario that exists is an
143.34s: opportunity driven trade so the
145.92s: difference between these two is when I
148.44s: look at the portfolio and then I
149.88s: identify that I need something I'm
151.80s: already specific to what I'm looking for
154.68s: so what I mean by that is if I look at
156.90s: the portfolio and I realize ah I need
158.94s: more long Deltas well that immediately
161.64s: starts to narrow down what strategies
164.10s: are going to give me long Deltas same
166.14s: thing with my gamma risk my Vega risk
168.78s: all of those sorts of things when we're
170.46s: looking at an opportunity this is
172.86s: typically going to be tied to some sort
174.96s: of event for me so fomc meetings that's
178.08s: an opportunity there's already a certain
180.30s: subset of strategies that fit that
182.40s: opportunity so how do we figure out once
185.10s: we identify okay I'm looking for
187.20s: something based on a portfolio review or
189.42s: something that's opportunity driven how
191.10s: do we pick what strategy to use well
193.08s: it's simple for me the first thing I'm
195.00s: going to do is Define the hypothesis and
196.92s: then contextualize the hypothesis which
199.20s: I'll get into in a minute and then we're
200.40s: going to finish strategy to it a lot of
201.90s: times one or two strategies may actually
204.84s: work for a specific trade and that's
207.66s: totally cool but in this scenario I want
209.94s: to walk you through first the strategies
211.86s: and then how I fit them to the specific
214.14s: opportunities so over here you get to
217.02s: see in general this is most of what I'm
219.60s: gonna do this isn't only exhaustive but
222.12s: this is most of it so for bullish trades
224.76s: I'm going to be doing the coverage
225.96s: strangle this is kind of a specific
228.00s: strategy that I almost always have
230.82s: exposure on in as for a whole bunch of
233.34s: reasons I'm not going to go into in this
234.66s: video you can check out my playlist on
236.40s: the coverage triangle I'll throw that in
237.84s: the notes below but almost always have
239.88s: this trade on so it's almost it's
242.04s: definitely bullish strategy but I don't
243.78s: consider it as part of this because I
245.22s: have a specific ticker I'm going to run
246.60s: in this and it's kind of off by itself
248.46s: now for other dispositions though where
251.16s: let's say I'm looking at Apple and I
253.44s: think Apple's going to go up I'm
254.82s: typically not going to trade the
255.96s: coverage strangle in there I'm going to
257.28s: look at some of these other ideas like a
259.14s: long call a short put a ratio call
261.72s: diagonal which I actually have one on
263.70s: right now in Apple for that exact reason
265.62s: for a long stock and I throw this in
267.90s: here because it's good for options
269.40s: traders to know that you can still
271.32s: always buy stock it's not going to hurt
272.94s: anything for bearish trades it's
274.98s: essentially the inverse of most of these
276.54s: uh short call Long put ratio put
278.58s: diagonal that's pretty much it and
280.26s: notice how I don't do short stock
281.76s: typically and it's just because it costs
283.68s: money to hold it and in general I can
285.90s: get the risk profile that I want via
288.06s: long puts or ratio put diagonals and
290.28s: then there's kind of this
294.72s: price is
295.92s: or down that's really kind of a bad
297.48s: reason to place a neutral trade when
299.34s: we're talking about neutral trades
300.78s: really what I'm focusing in on is
302.22s: volatility do I have an opinion on
304.62s: volatility so if I'm bullish in
307.50s: volatility meaning I think volatility is
309.36s: going to expand specifically relative to
311.70s: Historic volatility I might buy a
313.92s: straddle if I think volatility is
315.42s: overstated like I very typically do
316.86s: doing fomc meetings when Big Daddy Jade
319.20s: Pals out there slamming the hammer down
321.06s: on everybody then in those scenarios I'm
323.10s: probably just going to short the
324.12s: straddle now the other thing to notice
325.86s: here though is that there are kind of
327.42s: these two words ratio and skew sometimes
330.42s: I have a primary volatility disposition
333.78s: but a slight or secondary directional
337.20s: disposition so sometimes I'll skew these
339.54s: a little bit for the straddle maybe I'll
341.10s: sell two calls against the one put still
343.44s: a straddle but I'm adding more likes to
345.84s: it and skewing the wrist profile in a
347.76s: certain direction for a strangle if I'm
349.74s: more bullish than bearish maybe I'll
352.14s: scoot up the Delta on the short put all
354.48s: of this gets into the details on the
356.40s: strategy execution themselves but the
358.74s: point here is that they're very
359.82s: different and it allows me to then
361.38s: capitalize on various smart conditions
363.18s: so now this ultimately begs the question
365.58s: how do I pick if I'm bullish in apple
368.46s: why do I land on a ratio call diagonal
371.22s: versus long stock or short put or a long
373.80s: call and it comes down to an analysis of
376.26s: these items I'm gonna take a look at do
378.90s: I want defined or undefined risk that is
381.72s: an important first threshold because if
383.94s: I want defined risk then I'm going to be
386.58s: immediately looking at things like ratio
388.92s: call diagonals long calls the covered
391.32s: strangle those are defined risk so by
393.60s: adding this filter I immediately start
395.82s: to narrow down my choices then if I have
398.28s: a preference for defined or undefined
400.14s: profit that also does the same exact
402.18s: thing now you might be thinking why
403.80s: would somebody want specifically defined
405.66s: or undefined profit well it's because
407.10s: it's not just the profit the other side
409.02s: of this profit scenario is the
411.36s: probabilities so when I'm talking about
413.94s: undefined risk undefined profit baked
416.52s: into both of these together is really
418.02s: the probabilistic outcome so those aside
420.78s: then I get into my other criteria like
423.54s: the duration what's the duration of my
425.58s: hypothesis so for example if I'm trading
427.86s: the fomc meeting I'm I don't have any
430.08s: sort of super long-term duration on
432.06s: volatility in those scenarios I'm
433.68s: specifically trading the release itself
435.30s: same thing for earnings place I'm
436.74s: trading the volatility around the
438.06s: earnings play so I don't really care as
440.16s: much about super long-term trades so
442.80s: again this is naturally going to start
444.78s: narrowing down my choices so for example
447.12s: I'm not going to trade any sort of these
449.22s: ratio diagonals if I have a one day or a
451.98s: two day or a one week hypothesis I'm
453.90s: going to trade something else so what
455.94s: I'm showing you is as I'm stitching
457.92s: together these various preferences I'm
460.44s: naturally backing into only a couple
462.66s: strategies so the same thing for
464.58s: volatility what's my volatility
465.96s: disposition do I think volatility is
467.76s: expensive do I think it's cheap do I
469.38s: think it's transitionary do I think
471.60s: we're going between volatility clusters
473.64s: that is also going to naturally
475.38s: determine where I'm going to go in terms
477.12s: of strategy then also Theta do I want to
479.52s: be long or short Theta again that
481.56s: inherently will knock off a bunch of
483.06s: these trades if I want to be collecting
485.16s: Theta then I'm going to be looking at
486.90s: selling strategies if I want to be long
489.24s: gamma I'm going to be looking at buying
491.16s: strategies if I look at my portfolio and
493.80s: my Deltas are too high now I'm looking
496.14s: for short Deltas there are different
497.82s: ways you can gain short Deltas you can
499.86s: either sell L Deltas in something that
502.74s: is positively correlated with your
504.54s: product or you can buy inversely
507.00s: correlated Deltas so there's a lot of
509.04s: different ways you can structure these
510.48s: trades but the point being is once you
512.64s: outline the trades you trade the
514.68s: circumstances that these belong to and
517.08s: then you qualify with what your
519.36s: hypothesis is and fit that around these
522.42s: other criteria you're naturally going to
525.42s: back into whatever trade that you're
527.94s: looking for because it's naturally going
530.10s: to limit down different choices so
532.26s: overall you don't have to make this a
534.48s: super complex strategy it doesn't have
536.40s: to be exhaustive but once you have a
538.26s: decent idea of the criteria that you're
540.18s: looking for then you are going to be
542.46s: selecting what fits that disposition so
544.68s: if you have any questions let me know
