0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you
210.00s: you
240.00s: you
270.00s: you
300.00s: you
302.00s: you
331.00s: and
332.00s: you
333.00s: you
335.00s: I want to show you something
337.00s: let's say that you have a graph here
338.00s: and
340.00s: let's say that this side is
342.00s: piano
344.00s: with this being your zero line
346.00s: and then let's say
348.00s: your horizontal axis
350.00s: is just your number of traits
352.00s: here
353.00s: and
354.00s: in order of you placing them
357.00s: and let's say that
359.00s: This is what your sample looks like.
366.00s: Okay.
372.40s: So, we have one scenario here.
384.64s: Now, let's first start with this scenario.
389.14s: Let's say that you just open up your brokerage platform,
392.84s: you export your trade performance,
395.44s: and then this is what you see.
397.64s: What kind of decisions can we make off of this?
401.44s: Well, as I look at it,
405.44s: not that fucking many,
407.74s: because I have no idea
411.34s: what any of this is pertaining to.
415.14s: Is this one individual ticker?
417.64s: Is this multiple tickers?
419.24s: Is this one individual strategy?
421.04s: Is this multiple strategies?
423.24s: This means nothing to me, right?
425.54s: I can't use this information to help me make
431.24s: any piece of my system better.
434.04s: Now, let's kind of take the scenario one step further.
437.44s: Let's say that you are an enterprising trader
440.64s: in the outlier community.
442.54s: And you've watched videos from a pretty ugly look in dude
448.84s: about trade logs.
451.04s: And you understand that having a record of your trades
455.64s: is kind of useful.
457.54s: You don't really understand why it's kind of annoying to do.
460.94s: It's extra work that you don't feel enthused about.
464.44s: You much rather just make the money.
466.04s: But let's just give this random internet dude a shot.
470.44s: Let's see if this idea has any merit to it.
473.44s: And let's take a look at a different scenario.
475.54s: Let's say that the scenario here instead,
478.54s: rather than it just being an export of your brokerage statement.
483.54s: And let's say instead that this is your momentum strategy.
491.24s: Let's say that your holding period is anywhere from one
497.24s: to 35 days.
500.24s: Let's say that these are all long options.
504.74s: Let's say that they're bought anywhere from 60 to 180 DTE.
513.74s: Let's say that the holding, we already did the holding period
519.24s: up here.
520.74s: Let's say that the average risk is $1,000.
533.74s: And so on and so forth.
535.24s: So we have some details here to go off of.
538.94s: If I have a trade log that tracks these details,
544.64s: and this is the output of that strategy,
548.64s: I can now begin conducting a very useful analysis.
555.64s: I can say things like, is there a correlation
560.14s: between the holding duration of the position
565.14s: and the subsequent outcome?
569.64s: So let's say for the example,
573.14s: I'm looking at holding duration.
575.34s: And I notice that for trades that are greater than 20 days held.
583.84s: And I go through and I want to highlight those trades that are
587.34s: greater than 20 days held.
589.34s: And this is the grouping of that that I get.
596.34s: I now have some really interesting data to start going off of.
600.54s: The first thing I can tell you is that the win rate is pretty damn good.
605.54s: The second thing is I might be able to understand a relationship
609.54s: between the average winning size
612.34s: and the average winning size.
615.34s: I can also say that something squirrely happened with this one
619.34s: compared to all of these.
621.34s: If I were to draw a line of best fit through these,
625.34s: it would completely exclude this point essentially
628.34s: and it would be something like that ish.
631.34s: So this isn't anomaly, something happened here.
634.34s: Something broke down in the strategy
636.34s: and I should understand what it is.
638.34s: And I think that's the first thing I can tell you
641.34s: is that I'm going to be able to understand what it is.
644.34s: The only way, the only way you can get to this level of information
650.34s: is if you have a robust trade process.
656.34s: If you do not have an actual process that you're following
661.34s: for your trades, that is highlighting literally just one element
665.34s: of this process.
666.34s: That example there is highlighting this after-action review.
670.34s: Stage of the outlier trading process.
674.34s: Another really important stage that you'll see us talk about
678.34s: in a little bit is the way that we place our trades.
684.34s: The reason why this matters is because if we do not control
689.34s: and isolate different variables,
691.34s: it is literally impossible for you to make educated decisions
698.34s: about how you might want to refine your strategy.
702.34s: Based on that prior example I gave you,
704.34s: maybe we start to analyze, well, maybe I should let the holding duration
708.34s: go a little bit longer on these.
710.34s: Because there's something in my setup that tends to take a little longer
713.34s: and maybe I should start experimenting with later entries.
717.34s: Or a million different ideas can come into your brain
719.34s: based on that one simple analysis there alone.
723.34s: Now, the only way that we can successfully control
726.34s: for these different variables is if we have a repeatable process
731.34s: we follow, one more placing trades.
734.34s: Even if there are different trades,
736.34s: even if there are different strategies, different trade ideas.
739.34s: All of that, totally cool.
741.34s: We can manage all of that.
743.34s: But by the end of the skill dev session for today,
747.34s: you should have a much better idea on how to build your own process
754.34s: to consistently place trades.
757.34s: The consistency element is how you control all these other variables
763.34s: so that you can start to figure out what might work,
767.34s: what might not work.
769.34s: Because as you know, and I know, the majority of traders don't do this.
774.34s: And they just kind of randomly go off of gut feel.
777.34s: And then they are shocked, flabbergasted,
782.34s: flored even, that the results are completely sporadic
788.34s: all over the place, nothing even usable.
791.34s: And then they wonder why trading is difficult.
794.34s: They blame the Fed, they blame other things
798.34s: for their terrible performance because they suck.
801.34s: So let's not do that.
803.34s: So let's talk about this outlier trade process.
808.34s: This is a way to do it.
812.34s: This is not the way to do it.
814.34s: There's lots of different ways.
815.34s: You can structure trades and build things that might work better for you.
818.34s: This is literally my rendition of what I find that tends to work.
825.34s: So the reason why I share these frameworks with you all
829.34s: are to give you a starting point.
832.34s: It's not to say that like use this framework,
834.34s: this is the correct framework.
836.34s: Genuinely, not the intention whatsoever.
839.34s: But a lot of people don't know where to start.
842.34s: So while I go through this trade process with you all,
846.34s: I want you not to focus too deeply on the individual elements
851.34s: and sub components.
853.34s: And I want you to be a thinking trader and say,
857.34s: okay, yeah, I got some inspiration.
859.34s: I got some ideas for this on how I could build my own
863.34s: that might fit a little better with how I do things.
866.34s: That's the output that should come from here.
869.34s: And I encourage you to rip what I do,
874.34s: rip the stuff that I give you.
875.34s: That's the point of me giving it to you and make it your own.
878.34s: Turn it into something that works for you,
880.34s: leverage the framework.
881.34s: If this framework works great by itself, beautiful,
884.34s: then use the framework.
885.34s: You don't have to change it.
886.34s: But don't be afraid to just take inspiration from things
890.34s: and then to make it your own.
892.34s: One of the really cool things about my experience
895.34s: in the military is a Marine officer is a lot of what I do
900.34s: as a trader and in the rest of my life is literally forged
904.34s: by my experience there.
906.34s: Literally this terminology after action review is literally
910.34s: directly from the military.
912.34s: And I make that up.
913.34s: They did.
914.34s: I use it.
915.34s: So that's the broader point.
917.34s: You'll notice that there are four stages as we look
921.34s: at the outlier trade process.
923.34s: And if I were to split these, there's kind of like a
927.34s: preparatory stage, there's an execution stage,
930.34s: and then there's a post trade stage.
935.34s: So the preparatory stage is one and two execution.
938.34s: Obviously is three.
940.34s: And then four would be the post-grade stage.
945.34s: So you'll notice that there are two preparatory
950.34s: and then one of the other remaining.
953.34s: Why would that be?
954.34s: Well, it's because as per usual, the preparatory stage
958.34s: is the most important.
960.34s: It's where all the work is done.
962.34s: The rest of this is wrote process that comes out of
968.34s: the first two steps here.
971.34s: So let's run through these really quick.
973.34s: I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on it because I
976.34s: literally already have a video that goes through all of this
979.34s: stuff.
980.34s: I want to spend a little more time working through some
983.34s: examples with you all to help you get a sense of how to
986.34s: like functionally implement it at a high level.
988.34s: And then obviously for the pro members during the case
991.34s: study tomorrow will go deep and will actually build like
996.34s: a outlier trade process for a specific strategy.
1001.34s: So we'll actually go end to end.
1004.34s: But I want everybody to have an idea of how to execute a
1008.34s: process like this.
1010.34s: So the first stage of my process is looking at the portfolio
1013.34s: fit.
1014.34s: The reason why I look at the portfolio fit is because at the
1019.34s: end of the day, every single individual position you put
1022.34s: on becomes part of the portfolio.
1025.34s: And the way that that total portfolio behaves is the
1029.34s: sum of all the individual parts.
1031.34s: So if you treat each individual trade as if it is a
1036.34s: vacuum, you start to set yourself up for a big problem.
1039.34s: Here's an example of that.
1041.34s: If we have, and by the way, feel free to throw any questions
1045.34s: in as we go along again, I already have a video on this whole
1048.34s: thing.
1049.34s: So you're not like interrupting me.
1051.34s: This is designed to be back and forth conversation with
1054.34s: you guys.
1055.34s: I'll pull the chat up in just a second.
1057.34s: I kind of just started getting into it.
1059.34s: Now, let's say this portfolio fit thing.
1062.34s: You and your kind of like, I don't really know how that
1064.34s: might look.
1065.34s: Well, let's say here's your portfolio.
1068.34s: And let's say all you do is sell puts.
1070.34s: That's all I like to do is sell puts.
1072.34s: I'm going to sell puts in Apple and Amazon.
1079.34s: In Nvidia.
1081.34s: I'm going to sell some puts in maybe JP Morgan.
1086.34s: Let's sell some puts also in what Costco maybe.
1092.34s: So I'm kind of just building out this broad portfolio based
1095.34s: on selling puts in all these different things.
1097.34s: Cool.
1098.34s: Now, all of these might be high probability trades.
1101.34s: We might be thinking to ourselves, there's a really high
1105.34s: probability for each one of these positions here to work out
1109.34s: in our favor.
1110.34s: Okay, cool.
1111.34s: So what happens if what happened the last five days in the
1117.34s: market happens?
1120.34s: Well, the S&P 500 over the last five days has gone something
1125.34s: like this.
1128.34s: This period here.
1130.34s: So even though you have all of these individual trades that in
1134.34s: your mind are in different tickers, so you're nice and
1138.34s: diversified.
1140.34s: This and this and this are essentially the same trade.
1143.34s: They're going to behave super similarly, especially during
1147.34s: broad market movements.
1149.34s: They become more correlated risk becomes more concentrated when
1153.34s: you have higher volatility environments.
1156.34s: So you might be saying, well, the JP Morgan and the Costco,
1160.34s: they surely help me out, right?
1163.34s: They set things a little bit different.
1165.34s: So I'm getting diversification from there, maybe depends on how
1168.34s: big the drawdown is and what the market's doing.
1170.34s: What I can tell you is right now, it's not.
1172.34s: If this was the case, you functionally now, you thought you
1176.34s: had five individual positions, but really you have one position.
1182.34s: And you're placing all these thinking that these are all
1185.34s: different things that are going to help you out in offset one
1188.34s: another, and they're simply not, especially as volatility
1191.34s: starts to expand.
1193.34s: So the way that all of these individual positions fit into
1196.34s: your portfolio has to be carefully understood.
1201.34s: Notice the emphasis there on understood, not saying that you
1204.34s: can't do this, you could do this if you want, but you should
1207.34s: be going into it eyes wide open.
1211.34s: It could be the scenario that you just happen to really like
1214.34s: all five of those companies and unlike the majority of
1218.34s: people who say, oh, I would love to own this at this price,
1222.34s: you actually do want to buy them.
1225.34s: And you've thought through them in bad scenarios, if the market
1228.34s: goes down 30%, you still are interested, all that kind of
1231.34s: stuff is legitimate in this case, and it's fine.
1233.34s: There's no problem, right?
1234.34s: You should do what's right for your portfolio, but you
1237.34s: should be aware of what you're doing.
1239.34s: And a lot of people on that kind of scenario are not.
1242.34s: They're not aware.
1243.34s: And then when there is a big broad market down move,
1246.34s: they're not protected in the way that they thought they were
1248.34s: going to be protected.
1249.34s: That's a massive problem.
1252.34s: So the other things that matter from the portfolio fit is,
1257.34s: do these additional trades move me further towards my goal?
1263.34s: You might be saying, what goal is that?
1265.34s: Great question.
1266.34s: Whatever goal you've defined, because as you know, this
1270.34s: should have been done already.
1271.34s: You should already know what your trading goal is, what we're
1274.34s: trying to accomplish here.
1275.34s: If you don't have that, then it becomes really difficult to
1278.34s: know how this fits into your portfolio.
1280.34s: And if you're moving towards your goal, because that shit's
1282.34s: undefined, how can it work super well?
1285.34s: The reason why the goal defining element is very important is
1288.34s: because then we can make sure our portfolio reflects
1293.34s: something that can lead us towards that goal.
1297.34s: But if the goal is undefined, you obviously can't do that.
1300.34s: It won't work.
1302.34s: So the portfolio fit in a nutshell is where we take a
1306.34s: holistic look at the portfolio and then the individual
1309.34s: prospect position that we're considering putting on and
1312.34s: we're making sure that it fits, that it makes sense.
1315.34s: This is a big puzzle that you're building, whether your
1318.34s: puzzle is five jumbo pieces or if your puzzle is 50 pieces,
1323.34s: meaning obviously each piece representing an individual
1327.34s: trade, it can be different things.
1330.34s: So because of all of that, you don't want to start building
1337.34s: a portfolio that when you eventually look at the whole
1340.34s: thing, you're like, wait a minute, this isn't what I thought
1343.34s: this would look like.
1344.34s: That's bad news, bears.
1346.34s: Okay, cool.
1347.34s: So then the next step we have, profit, mechanism, and
1354.34s: signal.
1355.34s: So before we place a trade, before we place a trade,
1359.34s: we should be able to clearly identify how this idea can
1364.34s: be monetized.
1365.34s: How does it actually make money?
1367.34s: And what is the analysis that I have done to help me quantify
1373.34s: the probability, how much money I think it might make?
1377.34s: Those details, again, matter.
1380.34s: So these things should be generally defined already from your
1385.34s: strategy.
1386.34s: The skill depth session we did a couple of weeks ago was on the
1391.34s: outlier strategy process, which is exactly where we go through
1395.34s: this stage for the individual strategies, this stage.
1400.34s: And we say, what are the different ways I as a trader attempt
1404.34s: to make money in the stock market?
1406.34s: Okay, I try to trade things directionally, sick.
1409.34s: That is one way you can make money.
1411.34s: Well, how do I try to do that?
1413.34s: Well, one of the things that I'm going to do is to make money
1415.34s: in the stock market.
1416.34s: I try to do that.
1417.34s: Well, one of my strategies I try to use timing to get better
1420.34s: entries.
1421.34s: One of my strategies I try to use breakouts.
1424.34s: One of my strategies I try to use post earnings announcement
1427.34s: drift and so on and so forth.
1429.34s: By defining them in their individual categories like this,
1433.34s: you can then create a profile for each one of these profit
1437.34s: mechanisms.
1438.34s: So that then you know how it behaves.
1440.34s: You know what makes sense, which will get into in a second.
1444.34s: So that's why I'm going to explain to you how it is that
1446.34s: in a second of the day, you know, when you're at a realize
1449.34s: you're going to have to have a right to start the business.
1451.34s: And so you know, if you don't do this and you're just kind
1453.34s: of throwing on trades as they are, even if you're right,
1455.34s: it's probably suboptimal what you're doing.
1457.34s: There's probably a better way to get a better return on the
1459.34s: risk you're taking.
1460.34s: You're already taking the risk.
1461.34s: Why not monetize it as much as humanly possible.
1463.34s: And again, people don't do that because they're lazy.
1465.34s: They're like, I'm just going to keep defaulting to the same
1468.34s: thing that I do, because I know how to do this.
1470.34s: Okay, well, you could do that, and if it works, it works.
1472.34s: But you have to understand the lens that I talked to you from is, is that of a, like,
1477.86s: a professional trader. Those margins matter. And for a casual trader, they might not care.
1486.02s: But what they don't realize, again, is that they're already taking the risk.
1491.62s: If you're taking the risk and not ringing out is much reward as you can possibly get out of
1497.62s: this risk, in the long run, you have suboptimal performance. And there's no reason for it.
1502.82s: Other than, again, just being lazy. So the second step here is where we're actually going to
1509.70s: identify those traits to then help us build an idea. Once we get through and we understand
1520.98s: the profit mechanism and the signal as we've defined it, based on whatever ticker it is that
1528.34s: we're looking at and our analysis, we then now get to go in and begin building a trade. Notice
1535.54s: how late this is? We're talking about literally a trade process. And it's not until step three that
1544.74s: even really get into the concept of a trade because the trade literally comes this late in the
1552.58s: process. All the work is done before. So let's start putting it together as we go through the rest
1561.14s: of these because I think it will be a little more useful for you. So let's say that we look at our
1566.18s: portfolio and the portfolio doesn't really have a specific need and a need can be I need to trim
1575.86s: my long beta-weighted deltas. I need to add more long beta-weighted deltas. I need to move my risk
1582.18s: out in time because the market's becoming more correlated near term. I need to get some short
1587.54s: theta trades on because right now I have too much long theta that's eroding the value of the
1592.58s: account and I would like to offset that slightly. I have too much Vega in the account right now
1598.42s: and I'm holding a fucking Vama bomb that might go off and most people don't even know what that is
1604.18s: and I do because I study and practice and I'm not going to be the sucker that gets ran over by one
1611.62s: or I guess blown up by one. Those are portfolio needs. So let's just say in this example the portfolio
1620.02s: need is no but we need to increase utilization. So this means that there's no real specific way we
1641.54s: have to do it but we need to use more of the account. How do we arrive at this portfolio need?
1649.94s: Again super simple. I look at the list of trades that I have on right now and I look at my pre-defined
1661.94s: profit and loss targets for each. So let's say this trade's going to make me a hundred box. This
1668.98s: trade's going to make me ten bucks. This trade might make me a hundred bucks and so on and so
1673.38s: forth. That's the profit side and on the risk side as I look through all of these this one I'm
1680.82s: risking ten. This one I'm risking one. This one I'm risking ten. Whatever. I'm just obviously
1684.74s: throwing random numbers out. But let's say that you get through running your analysis
1691.06s: and let me get myself out of the way one sec because this is about to be in the way for you.
1702.58s: There we go. So now let's say you get to the bottom of your analysis here and you're going to
1711.70s: potentially make two hundred ten bucks. Well let's say that your monthly target is three hundred
1720.42s: bucks. Guess what? God do something. This ain't it. We're not going to get there right now. This is not
1730.10s: this. So this tells me I need to do some shit. Some's got to happen. Otherwise this starts to leave me
1737.70s: to falling further and further behind and then you might be asking, well how do I come up with
1744.18s: my monthly target? Great question. This is part of that goal setting function that we've talked
1750.66s: about previously. This is defined ahead of time. So this is how I have no specific way to get to
1763.70s: deutilization. The portfolio doesn't have any other needs as I review the portfolio,
1768.98s: but it does have a utilization need that I'm not hitting right now. I'm likely to miss what I'm
1774.58s: supposed to hit at the end of the month. And obviously this is under the scenario of assuming all
1779.22s: of these are going to be profits, which anybody that knows anything about trading is that most of
1784.10s: these are probably going to lose. You're going to be like, well, fuck, I got to put on a bunch more
1787.62s: than. So you need to account for this. It's not just a function of counting up the profit and loss.
1793.62s: The way that we would want to actually do this is by using the expected return down here,
1798.66s: which includes the probabilities for each of these and then making the decision off of this.
1804.10s: This is just a simplified version of that for you. Okay. So now we know what our portfolio need is.
1810.10s: We have to use some money and we don't really have any specific rules, goals, guidelines for
1816.18s: how we use the money. It may be used, however, but we need to increase our utilization so that we
1821.46s: can hit our monthly target. Great. So we know what we're looking for. And let's say that we got
1827.06s: into the market and we find a trade that looks interesting. Let's say that you want to trade
1834.82s: gold to the upside. And let's say that this is because gold is been on a tear. The market is
1846.18s: starting to roll over and yada yada yada all these other things. So the portfolio fit for this
1853.22s: trade that we go out and find and come back. At this point, we might say, okay, how does this
1859.62s: how does this trade fit into the portfolio? Well, if I have mostly long beta-weighted
1865.46s: delta, this will add more, but it's lower correlated. Does that resonate with what I'm trying to build
1872.74s: right now? If it does, cool. If not, okay. And if we start thinking that in terms of
1880.34s: what impact does a prospective trade in here have on the Greeks for the portfolio?
1887.22s: Well, let's say that right now I'm long theta and I'm okay with that. Or actually, let's say
1891.54s: that we're short theta. So we're collecting money. We're definitely short Vega. And this would have
1898.58s: kind of a smoothing effect on the portfolio Greeks. So it fits in well from that lens. Okay, cool.
1905.94s: So now we move on to stage two. We've assessed how this thing fits into things. We now need to go to
1911.38s: stage two. What's the profit mechanism? Well, the profit mechanism is we're seeing gold go up
1918.10s: from 2650 to 2928 over the course of the last what three months. So we're expecting that to
1927.30s: continue based on macroeconomic factors as well. So the primary profit mechanism is direction.
1935.14s: And we're really approaching it from a momentum lens.
1944.18s: Oh, so what do I know about momentum? I know momentum tends to hold up best with things that have
1951.70s: gone up for the last six months. I can rank and sort things momentum for commodities is slightly
1956.34s: different. There's seasonality to it. So on and so forth. I can go through this entire archive
1963.86s: of qualifying factors about this profit mechanism. How do you get that archive of qualifying
1971.94s: factors for profit mechanism? Great question. You research them. You do the fucking work.
1980.26s: So then I start looking at the signals. And I say, okay, short term moving average is starting
1986.50s: to roll over as it's pulling back. The 20 day moving average is still positive sloping.
1991.94s: Price is above the 20 all the moving averages are aligned appropriately.
1997.38s: Standard deviation channels are upward sloping. Volume average is starting to contract on the day,
2004.34s: but it's still remaining elevated over the last five days and so on and so forth.
2010.82s: You can run through the entire breadth of technical analysis that's tied to this profit mechanism.
2019.22s: Whatever you've previously deemed as relevant to this profit mechanism, this is where you look at it.
2026.82s: And then you evaluate the idea based on the entire breadth of evidence based on everything
2036.58s: that you typically look at for this profit mechanism. You evaluate the idea against those.
2043.46s: Day swag says what resources should someone use to get more proficient in understanding the larger
2048.58s: market plumbing sectors rolling over and all of that. That's a great question. I think you should
2054.98s: look at the market. So the way to do that is you can, I mean, man, Chatchy PT is such a revolutionary
2063.78s: tool. It's not even funny. I would use Chatchy PT and I would have it help me classify different
2074.74s: regimes that I'm interested in studying. So if you're interested in studying larger market plumbing
2082.82s: or rolling over of broad sectors or things like that, I literally would have Chatchy PT
2091.30s: help me identify historic periods where we can see these different sectors starting to roll over.
2101.38s: Right? So one of the things you can do is go into bar chart or another resource like that and you
2107.94s: can download the sector ETFs and you can look at their performance relative to one another if you
2116.34s: want to do a little bit of coding. If you don't want to do a little bit of coding, that's okay.
2121.46s: The other thing you can do is go to really any sort of resource that has it. I'm not sure all of
2129.54s: them, but you can take a look at the performance for the broad market over different time frames.
2139.06s: Maybe it's completely locked up. This started doing this and I don't know why, but it makes me
2150.90s: furious. There it goes. So I can look back over this long term time frame and what do I notice? Well,
2159.06s: I notice that a bunch of these things started crashing in here all together. What the fuck happened
2166.34s: there? Go back and look. This is exactly what I would do. Like this is the exact process. I would
2175.78s: follow to help me understand these historic market moves like this. So that's a great question.
2183.94s: And a big part of it is literally just going through and kind of exploring a little bit of what
2189.46s: you see from historic precedent. Okay. So now we have the profit mechanism defined. We looked at all
2200.74s: our signals. We evaluated all of them systems or go. It looks like we can build our trade. Now we
2206.50s: move into step three. And step three is when we actually scope out the trade. So in this case,
2212.58s: do I want to be long futures? Okay. If I'm long futures, what's my PNL management plan going to be?
2219.46s: Am I going to use stops? Am I going to use mental stop hard stops? Am I going to set
2226.66s: specific price targets? Am I going to scale in or scale out? All of these questions can be defined
2232.34s: here in the PNL management bullet point. The trade checklist is something you can build for yourself.
2238.66s: It's essentially a series of things to make sure that you are ticking the correct boxes before
2246.02s: you actually launch the trade off. So they are not potentially stepping in front of something that
2251.06s: you don't even really know is there. That's generally a bad practice. So a great example of this is
2256.26s: if I'm trading a commodity, I should know the seasonality. Is there some sort of seasonal effect
2262.82s: coming up that I'm not aware of? I should look at that. If I'm trading an individual ticker,
2267.86s: there should always be an element in a trade checklist to verify earnings dates.
2272.82s: So that if there's earnings coming up, I'm aware of where it is. So that as I'm selecting my strikes
2278.98s: and my aspirations, I'm taking that into account and so on and so forth.
2285.38s: So this is where you outline those ideas. You make your decisions. One of the most important functions
2292.42s: during this stage is the sizing and scaling. Because let's take a look at an example quickly together.
2300.98s: Let's say that let's say I wanted to trade this PANW just because it's up. And let's say that I
2309.30s: wanted to buy a call in it. I think it's a good trade and I want to go far out in time because I
2313.94s: want the call to have plenty of time to work. I kind of want to hold the company for a longer term.
2318.74s: I come out here. I apply a standard ratio diagonal style approach. I find stuff that's liquid.
2324.02s: Yada yada yada. And I come in and I decide that these, the 175s come in at a 70 delta. Cool.
2334.74s: So now let's say that I'm sitting here saying, well, I think the trade might go up to 195.
2343.86s: It's pretty close. The market's starting to drift at direction. Yada yada yada. So I come in.
2348.42s: I do my analysis and I say, well, what's it worth at 195? It would be $387. I'm like, oh,
2353.62s: I'm not so jazzed about that. I'd rather make more money than that. So I just jacked this up to a
2357.94s: three lot. Now it's $1,000 and I like that number better. Okay, great. That looks so great.
2362.98s: And then I'm like, well, where am I going to manage the risk in this trade? Well, I don't want to
2366.34s: manage it here at 184 right below this because it's too tight. I don't want to manage it down here
2371.54s: because I want to give the trade plenty of room to move. I'm using a longer term trade.
2375.14s: I'm going to maybe I'll go all the way down here to the 165 166 handle. If it falls below that,
2380.90s: it will be below all the moving averages. It will take it out. All these successive higher lows.
2386.66s: And I'll call that a change of marketing condition. So we'll just call it 165. Okay, fine. I come in here.
2392.82s: And then I take a look and it doesn't have to be in here, by the way. You can literally create
2396.74s: your own graph for this in Excel. This is just here. It's easier. So 165, I plot that in.
2402.74s: And I say, whoa, shit, I'm trading a $100,000 account. This now is going to potentially be a $47,000
2412.34s: loser to make a thousand. That's fucked up. That doesn't make sense. I can't do this. That's a
2419.30s: bad risk reward for the trade. So that's the entire purpose of this here determining sizing and
2428.10s: scaling. Because if I define those profit and loss targets based on where I think it's going to go,
2433.30s: I can assign probability using the options, chains. And then I can say, what sizing makes sense? This,
2439.78s: first example, is what most retail traders do. They're too focused on what they want to see themselves
2446.10s: make. And they're not paying attention to the risk side. And then all of a sudden, you see like,
2450.10s: oh, shit, if I apply the trade as it's designed in my first pass, I'm taking way too much risk.
2458.10s: Something needs to change. Now, this something can be, well, instead of giving it this much room,
2464.34s: maybe I slide it up here to the 180 handle. Well, what does that change? It decreases my loss,
2470.74s: but it increases my loss probability. Am I okay with that? Maybe depends on your idea of the trade.
2476.82s: Or I can come in here and say, well, damn, I really would like to make a thousand bucks, but
2480.98s: it's more important for this trade to have enough room to move. Maybe it'll go higher. Maybe I'll
2485.22s: size this down. If I take it back down to the one lot, I'm still risking one and a half percent
2489.94s: on the portfolio. So it's a little on the high side, but it fits within the portfolio. I can rationalize
2494.82s: this. I'm only making three hundred fifty seven, which is not really exciting. Maybe if it gets to
2498.90s: that point, I can set a stop and then let it continue to run to try to squeeze it for a little bit more.
2505.62s: This is where you go through that entire scoping process to figure out exactly how this trade
2514.74s: should be built based on your idea. Once this is done, the trade is placed. We immediately
2524.18s: go to the trade log and input all of the relevant details. What details are relevant? Great question.
2530.66s: All of the details that you assigned based on the profit mechanism, based on the signal,
2536.26s: based on the strategy. All of this is defined ahead of time. It's already sitting in your trading
2540.34s: plan. And if you're sitting there saying, well, shit, it's not my trading plan.
2544.82s: Fucking fix it means you have a problem. Fix it. It should be in there. Now the last stage
2552.18s: of the trade is the trade. We see how it goes. And then it hits one of our P&L management targets,
2562.90s: whether upside or downside. And let's just play out the scenario in P&W since we're in here.
2568.98s: And let's say it's the unhappy path. Let's say it goes down and it moved all the way down here
2574.74s: to 165 and we get stopped out. Damn sucks. I'm going to take the trade off. I'm going to take my
2581.70s: 1567 loss and I'm going to input all of the trade data into my trade log that I need to complete
2587.78s: the trade log, which the fun part is it's not that much that you need when the trade is exited.
2594.50s: Most of the details for a trade log are there for you when you first put the trade on.
2599.14s: When a trade exits, there's only a handful of new data points. There's a new date. There's a new
2603.94s: ticker price. There could be a new volatility. There's your exit price. There's most of the stuff
2608.58s: is already input when you first put the position on. And then if you have a good trade log,
2612.82s: it's going to auto calculate all the pertinent details for you into something that's consumable
2618.02s: so that you now have a simple way to view the performance of what you're doing.
2624.26s: So this is the outlier trade process. The entire purpose of this is to take the strategies
2630.98s: that we build from the outlier strategy process and then to literally execute them.
2637.54s: That's the whole idea here. So happy to talk about any of the specific details in here if you have
2644.34s: any questions about the way that this should work if you're hung up on any of these individual
2651.22s: points, anything like that, let me know. And we can absolutely discuss it for you.
2658.58s: And then in the meantime, I'm going to get my dinner order started.
2666.50s: I don't know what we should get for dinner.
2669.86s: Like a big problem. We can go through the markets if you guys want to. I still have like 15 minutes.
2683.62s: Close this off.
2685.06s: And then I need to move myself back over to the side. This is the right set.
2700.42s: Ben.
2703.54s: Let's see what you got. Ben says, do you prefer automated stops or mental stops?
2707.62s: Or do you have different types for different situations? Yeah, your instincts are exactly correct.
2714.02s: So I have a video that will probably be useful for you on risk management for options trading.
2722.34s: The cliff notes version for that specific question is definitely relative.
2726.98s: And it's based on the strategy. So if I'm trading a strategy that's much more process oriented.
2733.62s: Right. So let's say it's something like zero DTE options. I had some of those or one DTE
2738.90s: options. I had some of those on as well that from yesterday into today.
2743.30s: So for those, they are essentially placed. And then they're just left.
2748.42s: Meaning what happens is what happens. The trade is going to be size the ones that I put on
2753.14s: yesterday were actually spread off because of the vault. And that's a scenario though where the
2761.22s: stop is built into the trade itself. Then there are sometimes where I'm trading just short
2765.86s: strangles, something like that. And in those instances, I typically will rest a stop.
2772.42s: Then there are cases where I'm trading ratio called diagonals where the stop would be a mental
2781.86s: stop. It would be a series of alerts that I actually would scale out as it goes down.
2788.98s: So it is highly, highly, highly situation and context dependent. Now one of the downsides,
2795.30s: especially for like the zero DTEs and stuff like that is the stops can be a little bit frustrating
2801.62s: specifically because when you use them, you have to use the stop market order. It's the only choice
2812.82s: that's rational, but it's also a very annoying choice. The reason why it's so annoying is because
2819.14s: when you use the stop market, you can get it a abysmal fill. But in the case of a stop market,
2825.54s: we're literally telling ourselves, I am prioritizing getting out of this trade when I'm supposed to
2830.66s: get out of the trade as compared to literally anything else. So you just kind of accept that
2836.18s: as a byproduct of that preference. So yeah, it's definitely a glorious mix. I'm going to pop the
2842.10s: door for the real quick. Ben says, what does portfolio management look like for drawdown? It would
2868.34s: seem like you would be behind on profit. Could you expand on that a little bit? What you mean?
2875.30s: Obviously happy to answer. I just want to make sure I understand the question is relaying it out.
2898.34s: Then in the meantime, Paula says, is into likely to show peed? Let's see.
2908.58s: Close this? No, it is not.
2916.10s: Yeah, no. Travel says, if I'm doing a wheel, what would be the loss? If I would not expect to
2936.18s: buy back with loss, initially it's undefined, but for ETF like spy, not really. So for plan,
2943.06s: how does that fit? Yeah, it's a great question. So the way to think about it for stuff like that,
2948.58s: the covered strangle, the wheel, any of those variants is the total capital risk. Like that is your
2957.70s: max loss. So it's low probability, not planning on taking it, but that is the max loss. So that's
2966.74s: typically what I account for personally. If there's a spot that you think you might exit,
2973.46s: like if things weren't going well and you're like, yeah, I might get out here if it's, you know,
2977.70s: looking kind of sketchy or not doing what I want, then in that case, you have to use whatever
2984.10s: that number would be, even if it's a number you don't like. But if that's not the case,
2990.74s: then yeah, it's whatever the capital would be that's going to be locked up for a while.
2997.06s: Ben says you were showing how you were behind on profit, you would look for more opportunities.
3004.50s: But what if the other side of the risk side is adding up, you still look for more opportunities,
3009.62s: definitely. It's the only way to make money as a trader, you have to look for more opportunities.
3013.78s: If the other side of the risk is adding up, it means we have to change some shit. Either we're not
3019.30s: doing a good job figuring out what the market's doing and we're making mistakes or we're trading
3026.42s: a strategy that doesn't fit the current market and we might have to dust off another strategy for
3030.58s: the current current period. But yeah, absolutely. The only way to make money as a trader is to place
3036.66s: trades and we're all going to have losing trades. So if you're having losing trades that are
3042.58s: successive, meaning they're starting to ramp up, then it means that you have a fatal problem
3049.30s: with literally your process as a trader that you have to identify and address. And this is exactly
3055.38s: why the trade log is so important because it literally will it will literally show it to you.
3063.94s: If you look through all of your different strategies and you notice that one of the strategies
3069.70s: is suffering more than others during this period, that's kind of really important information
3075.78s: for us to have. That's really important information for us to have. We can learn a lot from that data.
3083.78s: So we might find that our bullish breakout trades are not working well, which fun fact,
3090.82s: they're not going to work well right now given the broader market condition. So I already know
3095.54s: to rotate away from those and move into other shit that tends to work better. Something that works
3101.62s: really well right now or the different ideas that I've been talking about for some time,
3106.98s: like the earnings plays are good trading, vol and indices is good. Like there's a lot of other
3111.78s: things to pivot to during markets like this. So yeah, definitely there's a ton. There's a ton
3118.74s: that you can analyze from your trade log to then come up with a better decision because if you don't
3124.50s: do that, it's just guessing. But yeah, you have to even if you're having losing trades, you can't stop
3129.70s: because there's losing trades, they're going to be part of the game.
3132.58s: Sweet. All right, gang. I think that wraps us up. I'm going to go feed the dude because
3144.90s: Mel is not home. As always, if you guys need anything, let me know. Tomorrow you guys will see
3151.62s: the outlier pro or not outlier pro, the outlier quick tips video every Thursday. I'm starting to
3158.66s: drop a quicker video. That's not 20 minutes. And discusses things, hopefully trying to give you
3166.10s: a quicker takeaway later left, something to grab and go. So you can see those on Thursday.
3173.06s: You need anything? Let me know. You know, outlier. See you later.
