0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  you
150.00s:  you
180.00s:  you
210.00s:  you
240.00s:  you
270.00s:  you
300.00s:  you
302.00s:  you
331.00s:  you
333.00s:  you
335.00s:  you
337.00s:  are
339.00s:  you
341.00s:  and
343.00s:  and
344.00s:  and
345.00s:  let's say
346.00s:  that this side is
347.00s:  P&L with this being your zero line
349.00s:  and then let's say your horizontal axis
352.00s:  is just your number of trades
354.00s:  right
355.00s:  So they're just kind of in order of you placing them
359.00s:  This is what your sample looks like.
366.00s:  Okay.
372.40s:  So, we have one scenario here.
384.64s:  Now, let's first start with this scenario.
389.14s:  Let's say that you just open up your brokerage platform,
392.84s:  you export your trade performance,
395.44s:  and then this is what you see.
397.64s:  What kind of decisions can we make off of this?
401.44s:  Well, as I look at it,
405.44s:  not that fucking many,
407.74s:  because I have no idea
411.34s:  what any of this is pertaining to.
415.14s:  Is this one individual ticker?
417.64s:  Is this multiple tickers?
419.24s:  Is this one individual strategy?
421.04s:  Is this multiple strategies?
423.24s:  This means nothing to me, right?
425.54s:  I can't use this information to help me make
431.24s:  any piece of my system better.
434.04s:  Now, let's kind of take the scenario one step further.
437.44s:  Let's say that you are an enterprising trader
440.64s:  in the outlier community.
442.54s:  And you've watched videos
445.54s:  from a pretty ugly look in dude about trade logs.
451.04s:  And you understand that having a record of your trades
455.64s:  is kind of useful.
457.54s:  You don't really understand why it's kind of annoying to do.
460.94s:  It's extra work that you don't feel enthused about.
464.44s:  You much rather just make the money.
466.04s:  But let's just give this random internet dude a shot.
470.44s:  Let's see if this idea has any merit to it.
473.44s:  And let's take a look at a different scenario.
475.54s:  Let's say that the scenario here instead,
478.54s:  rather than it just being an export
481.54s:  of your brokerage statement.
483.54s:  And let's say instead that this is your momentum strategy.
491.24s:  Let's say that your holding period is anywhere
496.24s:  from one to 35 days.
501.04s:  Let's say that these are all long options.
505.04s:  Let's say that they're bought anywhere from 60 to 180 DTE.
514.54s:  Let's say that the holding,
517.04s:  we already did the holding period up here.
520.54s:  Let's say that the average risk
528.34s:  is $1,000
533.54s:  and so on and so forth.
535.14s:  So we have some details here to go off of.
538.84s:  If I have a trade log
542.24s:  that tracks these details
546.84s:  and this is the output of that strategy,
550.84s:  I can now begin conducting a very useful analysis.
557.74s:  I can say things like,
559.64s:  is there a correlation
561.94s:  between the holding duration
564.94s:  of the position
566.34s:  and the subsequent outcome?
571.24s:  So let's say for the example
573.24s:  I'm looking at holding duration
575.54s:  and I notice that for trades
578.94s:  that are greater than 20 days held
584.04s:  and I go through and I want to highlight those trades
587.14s:  that are greater than 20 days held.
600.44s:  And this is the grouping of that that I get.
604.34s:  I now have some really interesting data
607.04s:  to start going off of.
608.24s:  The first thing I can tell you is that the win rate
610.84s:  is pretty damn good.
613.54s:  The second thing is I might be able to understand
616.84s:  a relationship between the average winning size
619.34s:  and the average losing size.
621.04s:  I can also say that something squirrely happened
624.94s:  with this one compared to all of these.
627.84s:  If I were to draw a line of best fit through these,
631.74s:  it would completely exclude this point essentially
634.94s:  and it would be something like that ish.
637.64s:  So this isn't anomaly, something happened here.
640.34s:  Something broke down in the strategy
642.04s:  and I should understand what it is.
644.74s:  The only way, the only way you can get
649.34s:  to this level of information
651.24s:  is if you have a robust trade process.
657.34s:  If you do not have an actual process
660.84s:  that you're following for your trades,
662.54s:  that is highlighting literally just one element
665.34s:  of this process.
666.94s:  That example there is highlighting
668.94s:  this after action review stage
672.54s:  of the outlier trading process.
675.14s:  Another really important stage
677.94s:  that you'll see us talk about in a little bit
681.04s:  is the way that we place our trades.
685.34s:  The reason why this matters
687.34s:  is because if we do not control
689.74s:  and isolate different variables,
692.14s:  it is literally impossible for you
695.94s:  to make educated decisions
698.94s:  about how you might want to refine your strategy.
702.64s:  Based on that prior example I gave you,
704.94s:  maybe we start to analyze,
706.64s:  well, maybe I should let the holding duration
709.24s:  go a little bit longer on these
710.94s:  because there's something in my setup
712.64s:  that tends to take a little longer
714.24s:  and maybe I should start experimenting
715.74s:  with later entries
717.74s:  or a million different ideas
719.14s:  can come into your brain based on that
720.74s:  one simple analysis there alone.
723.64s:  Now the only way that we can successfully control
726.94s:  for these different variables
729.04s:  is if we have a repeatable process
732.34s:  we follow, one more placing trades.
735.24s:  Even if there are different trades,
737.54s:  even if there are different strategies,
738.94s:  different trade ideas,
740.14s:  all of that, totally cool.
741.64s:  We can manage all of that.
743.54s:  But by the end of the skill dev session for today,
747.74s:  you should have a much better idea
751.54s:  on how to build your own process
755.80s:  to consistently place trades.
758.40s:  The consistency element
760.74s:  is how you control all these other variables
764.94s:  so that you can start to figure out
766.70s:  what might work, what might not work.
770.00s:  Because as you know,
771.50s:  and I know the majority of traders don't do this
775.08s:  and they just kind of randomly go off of gut feel
778.08s:  and then they are shocked, flabbergasted,
782.40s:  Florida even, that the results are completely sporadic
788.64s:  all over the place, nothing even usable.
791.92s:  And then they wonder why trading is difficult,
794.94s:  they blame the Fed, they blame other things
798.68s:  for their terrible performance because they suck.
802.08s:  So let's not do that.
804.32s:  So let's talk about this outlier trade process.
808.24s:  This is a way to do it.
812.12s:  This is not the way to do it.
813.92s:  There's lots of different ways.
815.20s:  You can structure trades and build things
816.92s:  that might work better for you.
818.20s:  This is literally my rendition
820.80s:  of what I find that tends to work, right?
825.56s:  So the reason why I share these frameworks with you all
829.76s:  are to give you a starting point.
832.28s:  It's not to say that like use this framework,
834.88s:  this is the correct framework.
836.00s:  That's genuinely not the intention whatsoever.
839.68s:  But a lot of people don't know where to start.
842.72s:  So while I go through this trade process with you all,
846.48s:  I want you not to focus too deeply
850.04s:  on the individual elements and sub components.
853.40s:  And I want you to be a thinking trader and say,
857.84s:  okay, yeah, I got some inspiration,
859.80s:  I got some ideas for this
861.44s:  on how I could build my own
863.64s:  that might fit a little better with how I do things.
867.16s:  That's the output that should come from here.
870.56s:  And I encourage you to rip what I do,
874.80s:  rip the stuff that I give you.
876.04s:  That's the point of me giving it to you
878.12s:  and make it your own.
879.16s:  Turn it into something that works for you
880.92s:  leverage the framework.
882.40s:  If this framework works great by itself, beautiful,
884.76s:  then use the framework.
885.56s:  You don't have to change it.
886.84s:  But don't be afraid to just take inspiration from things
890.88s:  and then to make it your own.
892.40s:  One of the really cool things about my experience
895.52s:  in the military is a Marine officer
897.64s:  is a lot of what I do as a trader
901.08s:  and in the rest of my life is literally forged
904.48s:  by my experience there.
906.40s:  Literally this terminology after action review
909.24s:  is literally directly from the military.
912.56s:  And I make that up, they did.
914.08s:  I use it.
915.60s:  So that's the broader point.
917.76s:  You'll notice that there are four stages
921.68s:  as we look at the outlier trade process.
924.44s:  And if I were to split these,
926.80s:  there's kind of like a preparatory stage,
929.52s:  there's an execution stage,
931.40s:  and then there's a post-trade stage.
936.32s:  So the preparatory stage is one and two, execution,
939.60s:  obviously is three, and then four would be
942.60s:  the post-rade stage.
946.00s:  So you'll notice that there are two preparatory
951.36s:  and then one of the other remaining.
953.28s:  Why would that be?
954.12s:  Well, it's because as per usual,
957.12s:  the preparatory stage is the most important.
960.76s:  It's where all the work is done.
963.04s:  The rest of this is wrote process
968.04s:  that comes out of the first two steps here.
971.92s:  So let's run through these really quick.
973.96s:  I'm not gonna spend a whole lot of time on it
975.68s:  because I literally already have a video
978.12s:  that goes through all of this stuff.
980.32s:  I wanna spend a little more time
981.92s:  working through some examples with you all
984.72s:  to help you get a sense of how to functionally implement it
988.08s:  at a high level,
988.96s:  and then obviously for the pro-members,
991.00s:  during the case study tomorrow, we'll go deep
993.68s:  and we'll actually build like an outlier trade process
998.52s:  for a specific strategy.
1002.04s:  So we'll actually go end to end,
1004.52s:  but I want everybody to have an idea
1007.36s:  of how to execute a process like this.
1010.68s:  So the first stage in my process
1012.36s:  is looking at the portfolio fit.
1014.60s:  The reason why I look at the portfolio fit
1017.88s:  is because at the end of the day,
1020.88s:  every single individual position you put on
1023.04s:  becomes part of the portfolio.
1025.56s:  And the way that that total portfolio behaves
1028.76s:  is the sum of all the individual parts.
1032.92s:  So if you treat each individual trade
1036.52s:  as if it is a vacuum,
1038.16s:  you start to set yourself up for a big problem.
1040.68s:  Here's an example of that.
1043.04s:  If we have, and by the way,
1045.08s:  feel free to throw any questions in as we go along again,
1047.44s:  I already have a video on this whole thing,
1049.24s:  so you're not like interrupting me.
1051.12s:  This is designed to be back and forth conversation
1054.80s:  with you guys.
1055.64s:  I'll pull the chat up in just a second.
1057.60s:  I kinda just started getting into it.
1059.96s:  Now, let's say this portfolio fit thing,
1063.20s:  you and your kind of like,
1063.88s:  I don't really know how that might look.
1065.40s:  Well, let's say here's your portfolio.
1068.40s:  And let's say all you do is sell puts.
1071.12s:  That's all I like to do is sell puts.
1072.68s:  So I'm gonna sell puts in Apple, in Amazon,
1079.80s:  in Nvidia.
1082.36s:  I'm gonna sell some puts in maybe JP Morgan.
1086.00s:  Let's sell some puts also in what Costco maybe.
1091.84s:  So I'm kind of just building out this broad portfolio
1094.88s:  based on selling puts in all these different things.
1096.64s:  Cool.
1097.64s:  Now, all of these might be high probability traits.
1101.60s:  We might be thinking to ourselves,
1103.64s:  there's a really high probability
1105.72s:  for each one of these positions here
1108.04s:  to work out in our favor.
1110.12s:  Okay, cool.
1111.28s:  Well, what happens if what happened
1115.68s:  the last five days in the market happens?
1120.72s:  Well, the S&P 500 over the last five days
1124.60s:  has gone something like this.
1128.28s:  This period here.
1130.32s:  So even though you have all of these individual trades
1134.40s:  that in your mind are in different tickers,
1136.72s:  so you're nice and diversified,
1138.92s:  this and this and this are essentially the same trade.
1144.16s:  They're gonna behave super similarly,
1146.04s:  especially during broad market movements.
1149.88s:  They become more correlated,
1151.48s:  risk becomes more concentrated
1153.64s:  when you have higher volatility environments.
1157.08s:  So you might be saying, well, the JP Morgan and the Costco,
1160.92s:  they surely help me out, right?
1163.40s:  They set things a little bit different.
1165.36s:  I'm getting diversification from there, maybe.
1167.88s:  Depends on how big the drawdown is
1169.48s:  and what the market's doing, what I can tell you is right now,
1171.64s:  it's not.
1172.72s:  If this was the case, you functionally now,
1175.68s:  you thought you had five individual positions,
1179.56s:  but really you have one position.
1183.24s:  And you're placing all these thinking
1185.00s:  that these are all different things
1186.48s:  that are gonna help you out in offset one another
1188.92s:  and they're simply not,
1190.20s:  especially as volatility starts to expand.
1193.08s:  So the way that all of these individual positions fit
1196.32s:  into your portfolio has to be carefully understood.
1201.56s:  Notice the emphasis there on understood.
1204.24s:  Not saying that you can't do this,
1205.92s:  you could do this if you want,
1207.36s:  but you should be going into it eyes wide open.
1212.12s:  It could be the scenario that you just happen
1213.92s:  to really like all five of those companies
1216.40s:  and unlike the majority of people who say,
1219.12s:  oh, I would love to own this at this price,
1222.20s:  you actually do want to buy them.
1225.60s:  And you've thought through them in bad scenarios,
1227.72s:  if the market goes down 30%, you still are interested,
1230.48s:  all that kind of stuff is legitimate in this case,
1232.84s:  and it's fine, there's no problem, right?
1234.72s:  You should do what's right for your portfolio,
1237.00s:  but you should be aware of what you're doing.
1238.96s:  And a lot of people on that kind of scenario are not.
1242.08s:  They're not aware.
1243.08s:  And then when there is a big broad market down move,
1246.12s:  they're not protected in the way that they thought
1248.20s:  they were gonna be protected.
1249.84s:  That's a massive problem.
1252.68s:  So the other things that matter from the portfolio fit
1256.84s:  is do these additional trades move me further towards my goal?
1264.16s:  You might be saying what goal is that?
1265.80s:  Great question, whatever goal you've defined,
1269.32s:  because as you know, this should have been done already.
1271.92s:  You should already know what your trading goal is,
1274.04s:  what we're trying to accomplish here.
1276.00s:  If you don't have that,
1277.56s:  then it becomes really difficult to know
1279.20s:  how this fits into your portfolio
1280.76s:  and if you're moving towards your goal,
1282.12s:  because that shit's undefined.
1284.16s:  How can it work super well?
1286.12s:  The reason why the goal defining element is very important
1289.20s:  is because then we can make sure our portfolio
1293.28s:  reflects something that can lead us towards that goal.
1297.96s:  But if the goal is undefined, you obviously can't do that.
1301.28s:  It won't work.
1302.88s:  So the portfolio fit in a nutshell is where we take
1306.48s:  a holistic look at the portfolio
1308.32s:  and then the individual prospect position
1310.68s:  that we're considering putting on
1312.56s:  and we're making sure that it fits,
1314.84s:  that it makes sense.
1316.00s:  This is a big puzzle that you're building,
1318.16s:  whether your puzzle is five jumbo pieces
1321.88s:  or if your puzzle is 50 pieces,
1324.28s:  meaning obviously each piece representing an individual trade.
1328.28s:  It can be different things.
1330.60s:  So because of all of that,
1336.64s:  you don't want to start building a portfolio
1338.96s:  that when you eventually look at the whole thing,
1341.28s:  you're like, wait a minute,
1342.36s:  this isn't what I thought this would look like.
1344.44s:  That's bad news, bears.
1346.60s:  Okay, cool.
1347.80s:  So then the next step we have,
1353.12s:  profit, mechanism and signal.
1356.24s:  So before we place a trade,
1359.36s:  before we place a trade,
1361.84s:  we should be able to clearly identify
1365.68s:  how this idea can be monetized.
1368.16s:  How does it actually make money?
1370.60s:  And what is the analysis that I have done
1374.36s:  to help me quantify the probability?
1378.56s:  How much money I think it might make?
1380.72s:  Those details again matter.
1383.40s:  So these things should be generally defined already
1387.52s:  from your strategy.
1390.04s:  The skill depth session we did a couple of weeks ago
1394.08s:  was on the outlier strategy process,
1396.64s:  which is exactly where we go through this stage
1399.20s:  for the individual strategies, this stage.
1403.40s:  And we say, what are the different ways I
1406.08s:  as a trader attempt to make money in the stock market?
1409.80s:  Okay, I try to trade things directionally sick.
1412.60s:  That is one way you can make money.
1414.40s:  Well, how do I try to do that?
1415.84s:  Well, one of my strategies I try to use timing
1419.04s:  to get better entries.
1420.28s:  One of my strategies I try to use breakouts.
1423.60s:  One of my strategies I try to use post earnings
1426.32s:  announcement drift and so on and so forth.
1428.96s:  By defining them in their individual categories like this,
1432.84s:  you can then create a profile for each one
1435.96s:  of these profit mechanisms.
1437.44s:  So that then you know how it behaves.
1439.68s:  You know what makes sense, which we'll get into in a second.
1444.00s:  Because if you don't do this and you're just kind of throwing
1447.84s:  on trades as they are, even if you're right,
1450.52s:  it's probably suboptimal what you're doing.
1452.60s:  There's probably a better way to get a better return
1454.92s:  than the risk you're taking.
1456.40s:  You're already taking the risk.
1458.08s:  Why not monetize it as much as humanly possible?
1461.52s:  And again, people don't do that because they're lazy.
1463.76s:  They're like, I'm just gonna keep defaulting
1465.96s:  to the same thing that I do because I know how to do this.
1468.32s:  Okay, well, you could do that.
1469.96s:  And if it works, it works, that's okay.
1472.40s:  But you have to understand the lens that I talked to you from
1476.20s:  is that of like a professional trader.
1479.88s:  Those margins matter.
1482.08s:  And for a casual trader, they might not care.
1486.16s:  But what they don't realize again,
1488.56s:  is that they're already taking the risk.
1491.76s:  If you're taking the risk and not bringing out
1494.84s:  as much reward as you can possibly get out of this risk
1498.96s:  in the long run, you have suboptimal performance.
1501.80s:  And there's no reason for it.
1503.00s:  Other than, again, just being lazy.
1505.52s:  So the second step here is where we're actually gonna
1509.72s:  identify those traits to then help us build an idea.
1517.80s:  Once we get through and we understand the profit mechanism
1522.40s:  and the signal as we've defined it based on
1527.36s:  whatever ticker it is that we're looking at
1529.12s:  and our analysis, we then now get to go in
1534.12s:  and begin building a trade.
1535.32s:  Notice how late this is.
1537.36s:  We're talking about literally a trade process.
1542.60s:  And it's not until step three
1544.52s:  that I even really get into the concept of a trade
1548.00s:  because the trade literally comes this late in the process.
1554.48s:  All the work is done before.
1558.08s:  So let's start putting it together
1560.32s:  as we go through the rest of these
1561.68s:  because I think it will be a little more useful for you.
1565.16s:  So let's say that we look at our portfolio
1567.64s:  and the portfolio doesn't really have a specific need
1572.88s:  and a need can be, I need to trim my long beta-weighted deltas.
1578.04s:  I need to add more long beta-weighted deltas.
1580.84s:  I need to move my risk out in time
1583.08s:  because the market's becoming more correlated near term.
1586.08s:  I need to get some short theta trades on
1589.04s:  because right now I have too much long theta
1591.28s:  that's eroding the value of the account
1593.40s:  and I would like to offset that slightly.
1595.84s:  I have too much Vega in the account right now
1598.52s:  and I'm holding a fucking Vama bomb that might go off
1602.28s:  and most people don't even know what that is.
1604.20s:  And I do because I study and practice
1607.96s:  and I'm not gonna be the sucker that gets ran over by one
1611.76s:  or I guess blown up by one.
1614.24s:  Those are portfolio needs.
1616.60s:  So let's just say in this example, the portfolio need,
1624.40s:  is no, but we need to increase utilization.
1635.64s:  So this means that there's no real specific way
1639.44s:  we have to do it, but we need to use more of the account.
1644.44s:  How do we arrive at this portfolio need?
1647.44s:  Again, super simple.
1650.28s:  I look at the list of trades that I have on right now
1656.48s:  and I look at my predefined profit and loss
1662.52s:  targets for each.
1664.88s:  So let's say this trade's gonna make me a hundred bucks.
1668.92s:  This trade's gonna make me 10 bucks.
1670.72s:  This trade might make me a hundred bucks
1672.84s:  and so on and so forth.
1675.64s:  That's the profit side.
1676.96s:  And on the risk side, as I look through all of these,
1680.32s:  this one I'm risking 10, this one I'm risking one,
1683.08s:  this one I'm risking 10, whatever.
1684.24s:  I'm just obviously throwing random numbers out.
1686.52s:  But let's say that you get through running your analysis
1692.20s:  and let me get myself out of the way one sec.
1699.40s:  Cause this is about to be in the way for you.
1702.76s:  There we go.
1704.56s:  So now let's say you get to the bottom of your analysis here
1710.00s:  and you're gonna potentially make 210 bucks.
1714.76s:  Well, let's say that your monthly target
1719.44s:  is 300 bucks.
1722.56s:  Guess what?
1725.20s:  God do something.
1727.20s:  This ain't it.
1727.96s:  We're not gonna get there right now.
1729.52s:  This is not this.
1731.64s:  So this tells me I need to do some shit.
1733.40s:  Some's gotta happen.
1734.88s:  Otherwise, this starts to lead me to falling further
1738.72s:  and further behind and then you might be asking,
1740.36s:  well, how do I come up with my monthly target?
1745.64s:  Great question.
1746.80s:  This is part of that goal setting function
1750.08s:  that we've talked about previously.
1752.28s:  This is defined ahead of time.
1756.72s:  So this is how I have no specific way
1762.64s:  to get to the utilization.
1764.68s:  The portfolio doesn't have any other needs
1767.16s:  as I review the portfolio,
1769.16s:  but it does have a utilization need
1771.00s:  that I'm not hitting right now.
1772.72s:  I'm likely to miss what I'm supposed to hit
1775.56s:  at the end of the month.
1776.80s:  And obviously this is under the scenario
1778.48s:  of assuming all of these are gonna be profits,
1780.44s:  which anybody that knows anything about trading
1783.52s:  is that most of these are probably gonna lose.
1785.08s:  You're gonna be like, well, fuck,
1786.72s:  I gotta put on a bunch more then.
1788.60s:  So you need to account for this.
1790.68s:  It's not just a function of counting up the profit
1792.80s:  and loss, the way that we would wanna actually do this
1795.64s:  is by using the expected return down here,
1798.84s:  which includes the probabilities for each of these
1802.48s:  and then making the decision off of this.
1804.28s:  This is just a simplified version of that for you.
1807.32s:  Okay, so now we know what our portfolio need is.
1810.24s:  We have to use some money
1812.16s:  and we don't really have any specific rules,
1815.00s:  goals, guidelines for how we use the money.
1817.24s:  It can be used however,
1818.56s:  but we need to increase our utilization
1821.28s:  so that we can hit our monthly target.
1823.20s:  Great.
1824.04s:  So we know what we're looking for
1826.00s:  and let's say that we got into the market
1827.92s:  and we find a trade that looks interesting.
1831.32s:  Let's say that you wanna trade gold to the upside.
1839.12s:  And let's say that this is because gold is been on a tear,
1844.96s:  the market is starting to roll over
1847.88s:  and yada yada yada, all these other things.
1851.04s:  So the portfolio fit for this trade
1853.72s:  that we go out and find and come back.
1856.12s:  At this point, we might say, okay, how does this,
1859.56s:  how does this trade fit into the portfolio?
1861.52s:  Well, if I have mostly long beta weighted delta,
1865.84s:  this will add more, but it's lower correlated.
1870.04s:  Does that resonate with what I'm trying to build right now?
1873.40s:  If it does, cool, if not, okay.
1876.40s:  And if we start thinking that in terms of what impact
1881.96s:  does a prospective trade in here have on the Greeks
1885.80s:  for the portfolio?
1887.36s:  Well, let's say that right now I'm long theta
1889.88s:  and I'm okay with that,
1890.92s:  or actually let's say that we're short theta.
1892.52s:  So we're collecting money, we're definitely short Vega
1897.28s:  and this would have kind of a smoothing effect
1900.32s:  on the portfolio Greeks.
1901.52s:  So it fits in well from that lens.
1904.64s:  Okay, cool.
1906.08s:  So now we move on to stage two.
1908.72s:  We've assessed how this thing fits into things.
1910.76s:  We now need to go to stage two.
1912.52s:  What's the profit mechanism?
1914.04s:  Well, the profit mechanism is we're seeing gold go up
1918.20s:  from 2650 to 2928 over the course of the last,
1923.88s:  what, three months.
1925.72s:  So we're expecting that to continue based
1928.28s:  on macroeconomic factors as well.
1931.12s:  So the primary profit mechanism is direction.
1937.28s:  And we're really approaching it from a momentum lens.
1944.60s:  Oh, so what do I know about momentum?
1948.64s:  I know momentum tends to hold up best with things
1951.56s:  that have gone up for the last six months.
1953.44s:  I can rank in sort things, momentum for commodities
1955.92s:  is slightly different, there's seasonality to it.
1959.04s:  So on and so forth.
1960.32s:  I can go through this entire archive of qualifying factors
1966.96s:  about this profit mechanism.
1968.84s:  How do you get that archive of qualifying factors
1972.76s:  for profit mechanism?
1973.80s:  Great question.
1974.92s:  You research them, you do the fucking work.
1980.36s:  So then I start looking at the signals
1982.92s:  and I say, okay, short term moving average
1986.00s:  is starting to roll over as it's pulling back
1989.08s:  the 20 day moving average is still positive sloping.
1992.04s:  Price is above the 20,
1994.68s:  all the moving averages are aligned appropriately.
1997.52s:  Standard deviation channels are upward sloping.
2000.72s:  Volume average is starting to contract on the day,
2004.36s:  but it's still remaining elevated over the last five days
2008.56s:  and so on and so forth.
2010.92s:  You can run through the entire breadth
2015.00s:  of technical analysis that's tied to this profit mechanism.
2019.40s:  Whatever you've previously deemed as relevant
2023.68s:  to this profit mechanism, this is where you look at it.
2027.00s:  And then you evaluate the idea
2030.36s:  based on the entire breadth of evidence.
2035.20s:  Based on everything that you typically look at
2038.08s:  for this profit mechanism, you evaluate the idea against those.
2043.60s:  Day swag says, what resources should someone use
2046.36s:  to get more proficient in understanding
2048.00s:  the larger market plumbing,
2050.04s:  sectors rolling over and all of that?
2052.24s:  That's a great question.
2053.64s:  I think you should look at the market.
2056.48s:  So the way to do that is you can,
2060.20s:  I mean, man, ChatGPT is such a revolutionary tool.
2064.24s:  It's not even funny.
2065.96s:  I would use ChatGPT and I would have it help me
2070.96s:  classify different regimes that I'm interested in studying.
2077.64s:  So if you're interested in studying larger market plumbing
2082.64s:  or rolling over of broad sectors or things like that,
2087.64s:  I literally would have ChatGPT help me identify
2093.88s:  historic periods where we can see these different sectors
2099.88s:  starting to roll over.
2101.88s:  So one of the things you can do is go into bar chart
2105.76s:  or another resource like that and you can download the sector ETFs.
2112.40s:  And you can look at their performance relative to one another
2116.16s:  if you want to do a little bit of coding.
2118.36s:  If you don't want to do a little bit of coding, that's okay.
2121.56s:  The other thing you can do is go to really any sort of resource
2127.24s:  that has it, I'm not sure all of them,
2130.68s:  but you can take a look at the performance
2134.64s:  for the broad market over different timeframes.
2142.12s:  Maybe it's completely locked up.
2146.12s:  This started doing this and I don't know why,
2148.80s:  but it makes me furious.
2152.36s:  There it goes.
2154.12s:  So I can look back over this long term time frame
2157.88s:  and what do I notice?
2158.88s:  Well, I notice that a bunch of these things started crashing
2163.36s:  in here all together.
2165.04s:  What the fuck happened there?
2166.96s:  Go back and look.
2170.84s:  This is exactly what I would do.
2172.56s:  Like this is the exact process.
2175.44s:  I would follow to help me understand
2178.60s:  these historic market moves like this.
2182.44s:  So that's a great question.
2184.08s:  And a big part of it is literally just going through
2186.36s:  and kind of exploring a little bit
2188.84s:  of what you see from historic precedent.
2195.12s:  Okay.
2197.00s:  So now we have the profit mechanism defined.
2200.04s:  We looked at all our signals, we evaluated all of them.
2202.80s:  Systems are go, it looks like we can build our trade.
2206.28s:  Now we move into step three.
2208.12s:  And step three is when we actually scope out the trade.
2212.04s:  So in this case, do I want to be long futures?
2214.76s:  Okay.
2215.68s:  If I'm long futures, what's my PNL management plan going to be?
2219.60s:  Am I going to use stops?
2220.84s:  Am I going to use mental stop hard stops?
2223.52s:  Am I going to set specific price targets?
2228.08s:  Am I going to scale in or scale out?
2230.44s:  All of these questions can be defined here
2233.04s:  in the PNL management bullet point.
2235.24s:  The trade checklist is something you can build for yourself.
2238.80s:  It's essentially a series of things to make sure
2243.68s:  that you are ticking the correct boxes
2245.88s:  before you actually launch the trade off.
2248.32s:  So they are not potentially stepping in front of something
2251.04s:  that you don't even really know is there.
2252.96s:  That's generally a bad practice.
2254.60s:  So a great example of this is if I'm trading a commodity,
2259.12s:  I should know the seasonality.
2261.28s:  Is there some sort of seasonal effect coming up
2263.48s:  that I'm not aware of?
2264.64s:  I should look at that.
2265.84s:  If I'm trading an individual ticker,
2268.00s:  there should always be an element in a trade checklist
2270.92s:  to verify earnings dates.
2272.96s:  So that if there's earnings coming up,
2274.92s:  I'm aware of where it is.
2276.52s:  So that as I'm selecting my strikes and my aspirations,
2281.84s:  I'm taking that into account and so on and so forth.
2285.52s:  So this is where you outline those ideas.
2288.44s:  You make your decisions.
2290.20s:  One of the most important functions during this stage
2293.68s:  is the sizing and scaling.
2296.88s:  Because let's take a look at an example quickly together.
2301.00s:  Let's say that, let's say I wanted to trade this, PANW,
2306.44s:  just because it's up.
2307.96s:  And let's say that I wanted to buy a call in it.
2311.12s:  I think it's a good trade and I want to go far out in time
2313.64s:  because I want the call to have plenty of time to work.
2316.40s:  I kind of want to hold the company for a longer term
2318.68s:  and I come out here, I apply a standard ratio diagonal style
2322.44s:  approach, I find stuff that's liquid, yada yada yada.
2325.60s:  And I come in and I decide that these, the 175s,
2332.48s:  come in at a 70 delta. Cool.
2334.76s:  So now, let's say that I'm sitting here saying,
2338.88s:  well, I think the trade might go up to 195.
2343.92s:  It's pretty close.
2345.12s:  The market started to drift at direction, yada yada yada.
2347.88s:  So I come in, I do my analysis and I say,
2349.84s:  well, what's it worth at 195?
2351.80s:  It would be $387.
2353.40s:  I'm like, oh, I'm not so jazzed about that.
2354.80s:  I'd rather make more money than that.
2356.36s:  So I just jacked this up to a three lot.
2358.56s:  Now it's $1,000 and I like that number better.
2360.60s:  Okay, great, that looks so great.
2363.20s:  And then I'm like, well, where am I going to manage
2364.92s:  the risk in this trade?
2365.84s:  Well, I don't want to manage it here at 184,
2368.12s:  right below this because it's too tight.
2370.28s:  I don't want to manage it down here
2371.72s:  because I want to give the trade plenty of room to move.
2373.68s:  I'm using a longer term trade.
2375.40s:  Well, then maybe I'll go all the way down here
2377.40s:  to the 165, 166 handle.
2379.92s:  If it falls below that, it will be below all the moving averages.
2383.28s:  It will take it out all these successive higher lows
2386.80s:  and I'll call that a change of marketing addition.
2389.48s:  So we'll just call it 165.
2390.64s:  Okay, fine.
2391.60s:  I come in here and then I take a look
2394.12s:  and it doesn't have to be in here, by the way.
2395.60s:  You can literally create your own graph for this in Excel.
2398.80s:  This is just here, it's easier.
2400.52s:  So 165, I plot that in and I say, whoa, shit.
2405.08s:  I'm trading a $100,000 account.
2408.76s:  This now is going to potentially be a $4,700 loser to make a thousand.
2413.76s:  That's fucked up.
2416.20s:  That doesn't make sense.
2417.80s:  I can't do this.
2418.96s:  That's a bad risk reward for the trade.
2422.20s:  So that's the entire purpose of this here, determining sizing and scaling.
2429.32s:  Because if I define those profit and loss targets
2432.08s:  based on where I think it's going to go,
2433.44s:  I can assign probability using the options, chains.
2436.40s:  And then I can say, what sizing makes sense?
2439.20s:  This first example is what most retail traders do.
2443.44s:  They're too focused on what they want to see themselves make
2446.84s:  and they're not paying attention to the risk side.
2449.12s:  And then all of a sudden you see like, oh, shit.
2451.28s:  If I apply the trade as it's designed in my first pass,
2456.24s:  I'm taking way too much risk.
2458.00s:  Something needs to change.
2460.32s:  Now this something can be, well,
2462.56s:  instead of giving it this much room,
2464.40s:  maybe I slide it up here to the 180 handle.
2468.04s:  Well, what does that change?
2469.40s:  It decreases my loss,
2470.92s:  but it increases my loss probability.
2473.12s:  Am I okay with that?
2474.20s:  Maybe depends on your idea of the trade.
2476.92s:  Or I can come in here and say, well, damn,
2479.32s:  I really would like to make a thousand bucks,
2480.80s:  but it's more important for this trade
2482.40s:  to have enough room to move.
2483.60s:  Maybe it'll go higher.
2484.88s:  Maybe I'll size this down.
2486.68s:  If I take it back down to the one lot,
2488.36s:  I'm still risking one and a half percent on the portfolio.
2490.84s:  So it's a little on the high side,
2492.20s:  but it fits within the portfolio.
2493.84s:  I can rationalize this.
2495.60s:  I'm only making 357, which is not really exciting.
2498.08s:  Maybe if it gets to that point, I can set a stop
2501.48s:  and then let it continue to run to try to squeeze it
2504.00s:  for a little bit more.
2505.64s:  This is where you go through that entire scoping process
2511.64s:  to figure out exactly how this trade should be built
2516.04s:  based on your idea.
2519.00s:  Once this is done, the trade is placed.
2522.40s:  We immediately go to the trade log
2525.88s:  and input all of the relevant details.
2528.52s:  What details are relevant?
2529.60s:  Great question.
2530.72s:  All of the details that you assigned
2533.08s:  based on the profit mechanism,
2535.32s:  based on the signal, based on the strategy.
2538.00s:  All of this is defined ahead of time.
2539.28s:  It's already sitting in your trading plan.
2540.88s:  And if you're sitting there saying, well, shit,
2542.08s:  it's not my trading plan.
2544.92s:  Fucking fix it means you have a problem.
2547.68s:  Fix it.
2548.88s:  It should be in there.
2550.64s:  Now the last stage, after action review,
2555.24s:  we trade, goes on, we monitor it, we see how it goes.
2560.16s:  And then it hits one of our P&L management targets,
2563.04s:  whether upside or downside.
2564.68s:  And let's just play out the scenario in P&W
2567.68s:  since we're in here.
2569.08s:  And let's say it's the unhappy path.
2571.52s:  Let's say it goes down and it moved all the way down here
2574.84s:  to 165 and we get stopped out.
2577.04s:  Damn, sucks.
2579.08s:  I'm going to take the trade off.
2580.68s:  I'm going to take my 1567 loss
2583.60s:  and I'm going to input all of the trade data
2585.92s:  into my trade log that I need to complete the trade log,
2589.04s:  which the fun part is, it's not that much
2591.76s:  that you need when the trade is exited.
2594.68s:  Most of the details for a trade log are there for you
2597.84s:  when you first put the trade on.
2599.36s:  When a trade exits, there's only a handful
2601.12s:  of new data points, right?
2602.64s:  There's a new date, there's a new ticker price,
2604.76s:  there could be a new volatility, there's your exit price.
2607.68s:  Most of the stuff is already input
2609.64s:  when you first put the position on.
2611.36s:  And then if you have a good trade log,
2613.00s:  it's going to auto-calculate all the
2614.44s:  important details for you into something that's consumable
2618.24s:  so that you now have a simple way
2622.24s:  to view the performance of what you're doing.
2624.40s:  So this is the outlier trade process.
2627.56s:  The entire purpose of this is to take the strategies
2631.12s:  that we build from the outlier strategy process
2634.56s:  and then to literally execute them.
2637.76s:  That's the whole idea here.
2639.56s:  So happy to talk about any of the specific details
2643.92s:  in here if you have any questions about the way
2646.56s:  that this should work if you're hung up
2649.84s:  on any of these individual points, anything like that,
2653.88s:  let me know.
2654.68s:  And we can absolutely discuss it for you.
2659.08s:  And then in the meantime, I'm going to get my dinner order
2660.60s:  started.
2665.40s:  I don't know what we should get for dinner.
2669.08s:  Like a big problem.
2671.12s:  We can go through the markets if you guys want to.
2672.80s:  I still have like 15 minutes.
2683.68s:  Close this off.
2686.72s:  And then I need to move myself back over to the,
2690.40s:  to this side.
2690.92s:  This is the right side.
2695.56s:  Ben.
2700.56s:  Ben.
2703.76s:  Let's see what you got Ben.
2705.24s:  Ben says, do you prefer automated stops or mental stops
2707.88s:  or do you have different types for different situations?
2709.96s:  Yeah, your instincts are exactly correct.
2714.16s:  So I have a video that will probably be useful for you
2719.24s:  on risk management for option is trading.
2722.36s:  The cliff notes version for that specific question
2725.36s:  is definitely relative.
2727.16s:  And it's based on the strategy.
2729.28s:  So if I'm trading a strategy that's much more process oriented,
2734.00s:  so let's say it's something like zero DTE options.
2737.28s:  I had some of the or one DTE options.
2739.40s:  I had some of those on as well that from yesterday
2742.28s:  into today.
2743.48s:  So for those, they are essentially placed.
2747.20s:  And then they're just left.
2748.52s:  Meaning what happens is what happens.
2751.16s:  The trade is going to be sized.
2752.44s:  The ones that I put on yesterday were actually spread off
2754.84s:  because of the vault.
2756.72s:  And that's a scenario though, where the stop
2761.88s:  is built into the trade itself.
2763.80s:  Then there are sometimes where I'm trading
2765.32s:  just short strangle, something like that.
2767.84s:  And in those instances, I typically will rest a stop.
2772.52s:  Then there are cases where I'm trading ratio called
2778.88s:  diagonals, where the stop would be a mental stop.
2782.36s:  It would be a series of alerts that I actually would scale out
2787.32s:  as it goes down.
2789.12s:  So it is highly, highly, highly situation and context
2793.24s:  dependent.
2794.04s:  Now, one of the downsides, especially
2795.92s:  for like the zero DTEs and stuff like that,
2798.24s:  is the stops can be a little bit frustrating,
2801.76s:  specifically because when you use them,
2808.28s:  you have to use the stop market order.
2810.84s:  It's the only choice that's rational,
2814.32s:  but it's also a very annoying choice.
2817.64s:  The reason why it's so annoying is because when you use
2819.68s:  the stop market, you can get it a abysmal fill.
2822.76s:  But in the case of a stop market,
2825.76s:  we're literally telling ourselves,
2827.36s:  I am prioritizing getting out of this trade
2830.12s:  when I'm supposed to get out of the trade
2832.16s:  as compared to literally anything else.
2834.52s:  So you just kind of accept that as a byproduct
2837.32s:  at that preference.
2838.64s:  So yeah, it's definitely a glorious mix.
2841.72s:  I'm gonna pop the door for the whole quick.
2864.16s:  Ben says, what does portfolio management look like
2866.72s:  for a drawdown?
2868.16s:  It would seem like you would be behind on profit.
2871.08s:  Could you expand on that a little bit?
2872.92s:  What you mean?
2875.48s:  Obviously happy to answer.
2880.40s:  I just wanna make sure I understand.
2881.88s:  The question is really in it out.
2897.72s:  And then in the meantime,
2899.32s:  Paula says, is into likely to show peed.
2903.84s:  Let's see.
2908.72s:  Close this.
2913.96s:  No, it is not.
2916.32s:  Yeah, no.
2926.56s:  Travel says, if I'm doing a wheel,
2929.56s:  what would be the loss?
2931.12s:  If I would not expect to buy back with loss.
2936.12s:  Initially, it's undefined, but for ETF like spy, not really.
2939.64s:  So for plan, how does that fit?
2941.16s:  Yeah, it's a great question.
2942.64s:  So the way I'm doing it,
2944.40s:  a great question.
2945.48s:  So the way to think about it for stuff like that,
2948.80s:  the covered strangle, the wheel, any of those variants,
2953.12s:  is the total capital risk.
2956.56s:  Like that is your max loss.
2959.44s:  So it's low probability, not planning on taking it,
2962.48s:  but that is the max loss.
2966.08s:  So that's typically what I account for personally.
2970.68s:  If there's a spot that you think you might exit,
2973.64s:  like if things weren't going well and you're like,
2975.60s:  yeah, I might get out here if it's, you know,
2977.80s:  looking kind of sketchy or not doing what I want.
2981.52s:  Then in that case, you have to use whatever that number would be,
2985.28s:  even if it's a number you don't like.
2987.72s:  But if that's not the case,
2990.80s:  then yeah, it's whatever the capital would be
2993.68s:  that's going to be locked up for a while.
2999.04s:  Ben says, you were showing how you were behind on profit.
3002.48s:  You would look for more opportunities.
3004.60s:  But what if the other side of the risk side is adding up?
3008.16s:  You still look for more opportunities, definitely.
3010.28s:  It's the only way to make money as a trader.
3011.92s:  You have to look for more opportunities.
3013.96s:  If the other side of the risk is adding up,
3015.84s:  it means we have to change some shit.
3018.36s:  Either we're not doing a good job,
3020.96s:  figuring out what the market's doing
3022.52s:  and we're making mistakes,
3024.84s:  or we're trading a strategy that doesn't fit the current market
3028.60s:  and we might have to dust off another strategy
3030.64s:  for the current period.
3032.76s:  But yeah, absolutely.
3034.60s:  The only way to make money as a trader is to place trades
3037.40s:  and we're all going to have losing trades.
3039.64s:  So if you're having losing trades that are successive,
3043.36s:  meaning they're starting to ramp up,
3045.88s:  then it means that you have a fatal problem
3049.36s:  with literally your process as a trader
3051.88s:  that you have to identify and address.
3054.56s:  And this is exactly why the trade log is so important
3059.56s:  because it literally will, it will literally show it to you.
3064.08s:  If you look through all of your different strategies
3067.48s:  and you notice that one of the strategies
3069.80s:  is suffering more than others during this period,
3073.36s:  that's kind of really important information for us to have.
3077.24s:  That's really important information for us to have.
3080.08s:  We can learn a lot from that data.
3083.88s:  So we might find that our bullish breakout trades
3088.88s:  are not working well, which fun fact,
3091.00s:  they're not going to work well right now
3092.32s:  given the broader market condition.
3094.24s:  So I already know to rotate away from those
3097.80s:  and move into other shit that tends to work better,
3100.72s:  something that works really well right now
3103.08s:  or the different ideas that I've been talking about
3105.80s:  for some time, like the earnings plays are good,
3108.48s:  trading volume indices is good.
3111.00s:  Like there's a lot of other things to pivot to
3112.80s:  during markets like this.
3114.80s:  So yeah, definitely.
3117.08s:  There's a ton, there's a ton that you can analyze
3120.96s:  from your trade log to then come up with a better decision
3124.16s:  because if you don't do that, it's just guessing.
3126.32s:  But yeah, you have to, even if you're having losing trades,
3129.00s:  you can't stop because there's losing trades,
3131.56s:  they're going to be part of the game.
3137.04s:  Sweet.
3139.32s:  All right, gang.
3142.48s:  I think that wraps us up.
3143.60s:  I'm going to go feed the dude because Mel is not home.
3146.08s:  As always, if you guys need anything, let me know.
3149.64s:  Tomorrow you guys will see the outlier pro,
3153.36s:  or not outlier pro, the outlier Quick Tips video
3156.64s:  every Thursday.
3158.08s:  I'm starting to drop a quicker video that's, you know,
3161.52s:  not 20 minutes and discusses things, hopefully,
3165.60s:  trying to give you like a quicker takeaway,
3167.76s:  lighter lift, something to grab and go.
3170.28s:  So you can see those on Thursday.
3173.28s:  You need anything?
3174.12s:  Let me know.
3174.96s:  See you in outlier.
3175.64s:  See you later.
