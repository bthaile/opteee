0.00s: bit of an interesting week ahead for GameStop. The shareholder meeting was moved again.
5.84s: Now I think it's Monday, but a couple people sent in a few things from good old Super
10.92s: stonk about options. And as you know, I'm a dude ready to talk about some options, even
17.00s: if it's like 70 and sunny here in the middle of a Sunday afternoon in San Diego, I'm here
22.36s: for you guys. It's mostly just because I find this stuff fascinating. But the, I just
27.04s: want to talk through essentially these two different things people sent in. One of
30.04s: them is about implied volatility over the weekend. And the other one is about kind of
35.16s: the paradox of buying far out of the money options and why it's a bit of a trap in a lot
41.52s: of different ways. The goal here is just to give you information so that you can make
45.52s: better educated decisions when it comes to options because they can be tricky. The learning
51.32s: curve for them is very steep upfront. Once you know how they work, it's kind of like
54.60s: knowing anything else. I like cars. So if you're in auto mechanics is the same thing.
58.04s: When you first look at it, you have no idea what you're staring at. But then once you
60.56s: get it, you kind of get it. It's the same thing with options. It's really nothing that
63.30s: complex. So I'm going to break this all down. Barney style for us all. Now first, let's
68.24s: talk about this. This post from good old boss blunts is GameStop implied volatility continues
74.80s: to rise this weekend. So they're talking about this option and they're essentially saying,
78.88s: Hey, what's going on over the weekend? Imply volatility is moving and it may or may
84.70s: not be. And in this case, it is, but it's not. And I'll explain exactly what that means.
90.32s: So if we take a look at my ugly mug from a screenshot, this is a video that I did Friday
96.16s: after the close. Take a look at the implied volatility for this coming expiration cycle,
102.56s: which is 21 June in GameStop. The implied volatility for this chain at this time was 234
108.84s: 4.71%. I kind of blow it out because this is a little bit blurry. So in general, implied
114.96s: volatility doesn't move that much over the weekend. Now, if we take a look at what it is
118.80s: today, there's a pretty big variance. So right now, the implied volatility is 272.46%,
126.32s: which is a 37 point difference that sure as heck looks like implied volatility increased.
131.28s: Correct? Yeah, absolutely. If we take a look at the implied volatility across these
136.36s: different time frames, especially for something like GameStop, it's been very front loaded.
141.08s: Normally, it's the opposite. Normally, the further out in time you go, you expect to see
146.24s: a bigger, relative move over that time frame. But in this case, there's a lot of conjecture
152.40s: going on in the short term, a lot with the shareholder meeting and whatnot. And we actually
156.12s: can kind of see that. So I want to show you what I'm seeing. If we take a look at this
160.48s: coming expiration, let me scoot this down. This might be weird to you up front. So let
164.84s: me explain what you're looking at. This is looking at the implied volatility for out
169.40s: of the money options. So right now, GameStop closed at 2870. So that means that 2870s
177.00s: about right here. So everything to the left of this line is out of the money puts. Everything
185.76s: to the right of current spot price is out of the money calls because this is looking
190.84s: at out of the money options. And this goes back to kind of options 101. If we go again,
196.28s: just pop up in the chain, maybe make it a little easier. This is the call side. This is
200.24s: the put side. Notice how everything with a strike price above the current price, those
205.92s: are out of the money. And then on the put side, it's the inverse. If your strike price
210.92s: is below the current price, they're out of the money. So it's important because if we
215.64s: take a look at this, you'll notice something, especially if you trade options with any
219.24s: sort of frequency, there's something anomalous here. It's just massive call skew, massive
226.24s: call skew in terms of volatility. And in terms of implied volatility for this reference
231.24s: time frame, because notice how much higher this line is for the out of the money calls relative
236.64s: to the out of the money puts normally, that's the inverse. So to show you what this might
242.68s: look like normally, let's grab something like SPX. And we'll go down to the same thing.
248.28s: This looks super noisy right now because you notice this is using a ton of different
252.12s: explorations. So to kind of clean this up a little bit, let's just pick something that's
256.16s: a little further out, not like that, maybe trying to find like a good, oh, here we go,
261.12s: 19 July, here we go, 16 August. So if we look at the out of the money options here in something
267.60s: like SPX, notice it's actually quite literally the exact inverse because we typically see
273.64s: puts trading with more vol than calls. The market over emphasizes downside risk and you
282.24s: will typically see more vols to things that experience downside risk. So in this case,
288.44s: puts so all these out of the money puts are way jacked up as compared to the calls. And
293.92s: again, if we go back to game stop and again, let's clear out all this noise. We'll look at
298.20s: this near term expiration. It's literally the exact inverse, which is really interesting.
302.84s: Another interesting thing for kind of the options nerds, all these little bumps that you
306.40s: see, those are tradable events you can trade relative volatility for these positions,
311.00s: not going to go super far into that on this. I'm just trying to explain a little bit of
314.52s: what's going on here because all of this amounts to the market expects something to happen
320.12s: this week. Now how big or how small that's TBD. And I know a lot of people were really,
324.96s: really hopeful for kind of this big squeeze coming on due to the potential exercise of options
330.32s: from roaring kitty. Unfortunately, again, based on my best calculations that I can see,
335.12s: I don't think he exercised. And I'm not here to spread fun. I know people are like really,
339.68s: really concerned about that. And rightfully so big institutions are seemingly putting quite
344.80s: a interesting spin on a lot of this data. No doubt. But again, I'm just trying to call it as
349.76s: I see it and share just straight up information for you to make whatever conclusions you want.
354.32s: The reason why I don't think he exercised is because he would have lost millions of dollars
358.40s: to do that. He had not a ton of extra value left, but he had enough that it would have been
363.36s: literally like three or four million dollars just vanish. So he could have exercised some,
368.40s: he could have not to me as a right now. It looks like he didn't exercise again. It's just my best
373.68s: guess. He could have exercised. It's no way really to know. I have a video actually my last video
378.08s: that talks through that exact scenario. The fact that like nobody can actually know. But anyways,
382.32s: the reason why all that matters is because the fact that we didn't see much of a move on Friday
387.92s: from this. And it doesn't look like there's a ton of squeezing happening just yet. And sometimes
393.68s: stuff like that can take time to build up. What I'm highlighting is that there's no clear
400.88s: massive catalyst that I can see right now that leads to this. So this is interesting to me.
408.32s: The reason for that is because this isn't even an earnings release. This is literally a shareholder's
413.04s: meeting. The fact that implied volatility is this high for a shareholder's meeting is freaking
420.56s: fascinating to me. That is not common at all. This is almost like what you would expect to see from
425.20s: a biotech stock that's going through some sort of FDA approval phase. Really, really interesting.
430.56s: So who knows, but what I can tell you again, objectively speaking, massive, massive call IV skew
437.44s: that's pricing in an upside move. That's that's literally what I can see here. What that actually
442.64s: means in terms of what happens this week. Nobody knows absolutely nobody knows. And I'm not trying to
447.84s: get anybody's hopes up or put anybody's hopes down. Again, just trying to call it as I see it.
452.40s: All right, let's talk about the last thing that somebody was cool enough to send in. And it's this
457.52s: meme, which is actually pretty hilarious as I think about it. Let me blow it up just a little bit.
462.40s: And essentially, this is talking about a little bit of the problem with buying far out of the
468.24s: money calls. And a lot of new people that trade options this guy is thinking that's a good move.
474.80s: But then there are a couple components. And actually, this isn't fully accurate either. And I'll
479.04s: explain why. But there's a couple components to this that make this not as appealing as it might
486.00s: seem. And I want to explain to you why again, so that you can make informed decisions. So let's
492.32s: take a look at what this. How this goes. First, I'm going to show you these two little graphs. I
497.20s: guess I can leave them up like that. They might look like gibberish. Don't worry about it. I'm
500.80s: going to explain exactly what the mean. Let's focus on this. Right now, this is looking at something
505.20s: where the spot price is kind of essentially right in the middle here. And this is showing you two
510.24s: different expiration cycles, 31 days to expiration, 325. Notice the longer term expiration cycle has this
516.88s: nice gentle slope. And notice how the 31 DTE starts to have this really steep slope. And if we look
522.32s: at this coming expiration cycle, it's five days. So it's a very, very small subset of this. So
527.20s: this would be like almost purely vertical. Here's what's happening. Here's what this is telling you.
533.04s: Options have to make a choice. Either they're going to be in the money within
537.84s: intrinsic value, or they're going to be out of the money and worth nothing at expiration.
543.04s: So options that are out of the money are all extrinsic value, which is time value and volatility.
548.64s: Essentially, those are the two components for extrinsic value. When we look at intrinsic value,
553.68s: that's simply how far in the money something is. So for the call side, again, notice this shaded
558.96s: area. This is just telling you, if you look at the price of GameStop, again, when it closed, 2870,
565.52s: all of these strikes that are below GameStop spot price, those calls are in the money. Those have
571.04s: intrinsic and extrinsic value. But something happens. When we go, let me kill some of these
577.52s: strikes. So it's a little easier to see. When we go further in the money, we have more and more
583.84s: intrinsic value and less extrinsic value. Quick cheat code you can use that works in most scenarios.
590.72s: Now GameStop, it doesn't work quite perfect or near as perfect simply because this is such
597.36s: a skewed environment in terms of volatility. But it's a good general rule that you can use
603.20s: anyways, which is if you want to know how much extrinsic value is left for a deep in the money
607.76s: option, you can just look across the aisle and look at the corresponding out of the money option.
613.36s: So what that typically would look like for this 22 strike. If I look at this, it's obviously a
618.88s: few bucks in the money like six dollars or so. How much extrinsic value do these options have left?
624.32s: One, you could do the math. Literally, you could just take the difference between spot price,
628.80s: strike price, and then refer that to the premium. That's extrinsic value. Or you can just look at
635.76s: this out of the money. So this looks like 2526 cents of extrinsic value left in these options.
641.28s: Something like that. Okay, deeper in the money you go, the less extrinsic value you have. Now
648.80s: further out of the money you go, it's actually the same thing. And why? It's because the options are
654.64s: cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. There's only 25 cents of extrinsic value in these 105s. They're
659.52s: just very, very cheap. Why does that matter? Well, because when theta decays, the theta decay curve
666.64s: is highest or options that are at the money because there's the most extrinsic value. And theta
674.32s: decay actually slows down as you go deeper in the money because there's less extrinsic value.
681.12s: And theta decay slows down when you go further out of the money because there's less extrinsic value.
688.00s: That is as a gross dollar amount. So what I mean is if we look at theta decay here,
693.92s: for the at the money's ish, it's like 40 cents. If we go super far out of the money, you'll notice
699.36s: it's all the way down to like 15 cents. It essentially slows down a lot as a gross amount.
705.52s: But if you look at it as a percentage of the remaining premium, it's massive.
712.32s: So if you do what a lot of new traders do, which is see, oh, I want cheap options. I don't have a
718.24s: lot of money. These options right here literally would cost me 28 bucks. So I'll buy those.
724.08s: The probability of you getting a return on this is very, very low. You need a really big move
730.24s: and you need it fast because you only have five days before these are worth nothing. And hey,
736.00s: not to mention each time a day passes, which theta decay is continuous. By the way, it's not just
743.20s: it's set and then the next day and then it comes out. It's literally continuous decay on the options.
748.64s: It's kind of amortized throughout the remaining time. But if you look at this,
753.60s: on a daily basis, you're going to lose 15 cents out of your 28. So that means literally after one day
759.20s: passes, you just essentially cut this in half. That means that you now need an even bigger move
765.84s: before you can make money. So this is why a lot of times when sophisticated traders are trading calls,
772.48s: we actually don't go super short in time and we don't go super far out of the money unless we're
778.32s: expecting a massive move. If so, then we would buy them. We typically would call them something
782.48s: like kicker options. But for me personally, if I'm buying options, I'm going to go at the very
788.48s: least typically two weeks, three weeks out. That's if it's like super short term for me.
793.44s: The vast majority of my premium buying, whether it's calls or puts is going to be greater than 60 days.
798.40s: And why is that? Because of this, if you notice, this is looking at
804.08s: an at the money option, how it's theta decays over time. And notice what happens essentially from 100
811.20s: to 60 days. This slope is not that big. But then notice once you get within 60 days to 40, 40 to
818.08s: 20, 20 to 10. And then all the way in, beta starts decaying super, super fast on a relative
826.40s: basis to the remaining premium. I don't want to get stuck in this because this is the price for
832.16s: your low and gamma. That's what you're trying to get is rapid appreciation of your option,
837.28s: which you might not see. So it's a way to not lose a bunch of money, but you're probably going to
843.28s: lose a whole bunch of times before you might win once. And you would have to manage it very,
848.00s: very smartly in order to have a positively expectant scenario. So I really, really like this post
855.92s: because it's reminding people that what looks really appealing, aka super cheap options,
861.60s: actually have a lot going on underneath the surface that make them very difficult to make money with.
866.56s: The last thing I'll say is the further out of the money you go, the lower your delta is. And for
871.52s: those that don't know, delta is simply the rate of change of premium for one point move in the
877.04s: underlying. So what that means is if GameStop goes up by a dollar, these 42 calls have a delta of 24.
884.56s: So if GameStop goes up by a dollar, this premium will change by 24 cents. Whereas if you pay up a
890.72s: bit more and you're closer to add the money or even slightly in the money. Now if GameStop moves
896.72s: a dollar, you see 50 cents of that move. And if you're further in the money, again, more expensive
903.20s: still, but now if GameStop goes a dollar instead of seeing 24 bucks, you're going to see 80 bucks,
910.08s: 80 cents times a hundred. That's the multiplier for options contracts. So it's a bit of a balance.
915.76s: That's the cool part about options. You get to set them up to be exactly what you want. If you
919.68s: expect a big, big massive move and you're super convicted, you can go further out of the money
924.40s: and play the expansion of those deltas. Or you can play a little more conservatively like I
930.32s: typically do. I would go slightly in the money, pay up for the options. I would still have a
935.68s: management plan in place. I at no point would expect to just hold these into expiration because then
941.60s: you do run the risk of losing more money if these fall out of the money. I wouldn't want that to
946.48s: happen. But you can get stuff that's in the money, get a better delta for dollar move based on what
952.64s: you put in a little more expensive. And then you could also add a couple kicker options, maybe
957.92s: like a 20 delta, something like that in case you get that big move. But if you get a bit of a move,
963.68s: but not big enough in order to make a bunch of money, you can still walk out with a bit of a profit
968.40s: by having a slightly higher delta. They're completely, completely intricate game to play.
973.20s: And this is why options are so cool to me because they're a puzzle that you get to solve for
977.36s: yourself, depending on what you want to do. But this is such a great point. If you buy super
985.28s: far out of the money calls or puts super far out of the money options, the vast majority of the time,
989.12s: you were just lighting that money on fire, difficult to make money that way. So as always, if there's
993.60s: anything else you want me to take a look at with respect to options, I'm happy to help and jump in
998.64s: as much as I can. I'm now as invested in this game stop story and saga is you guys are you guys have
1004.48s: got me absolutely fascinated by everything that's going on. I'm actually looking forward to the
1009.36s: shareholder meeting now and seeing how things go. So thanks for sharing these with me. If there's
1013.68s: anything else you want me to take a look at, let me know. I'll see you guys later.
