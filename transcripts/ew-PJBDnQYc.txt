0.00s: Max Payne theory in options. What is it? We're going to talk about exactly that. We're going to start with what it is and then what it is then how you can use it. What's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers is shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make creating content like this possible. And if you enjoy my content.
17.28s: Consider signing up helps me out a bunch so as per usual I want to start with what it isn't and if you're like me and you were playing video games in the late 90s really 2000s you would think it's this dude which is kind of like OG to the taken guy it's the video game where his family was killed and he was a undercover detective that's not the Max Payne we're talking about today next we have that feeling you have in the bottom of your stomach when you open up your portfolio and this is what you see where
47.28s: you're down 94% all time that is also not Max Payne although both technically are also Max Payne. Let's talk about what it actually is. So first off I want to start with kind of a quick definition from
64.10s: investopedia you can read that at your leisure I'm going to summarize it for you because I mean that's what I'm here for and essentially it's the strike price in an individual series meaning an expiration cycle where the most options expire worthless.
79.42s: Why does that matter well there's a couple things that lead into that the first being this bullet point right here. The assumption we start with is that on the
89.70s: counter side to most purchased options are market makers they're the people that typically make markets so if a lot of people are buying options they're
98.58s: typically selling options and there's a reason why this is important it's because market makers tend to hedge their
104.74s: position so the ability to move rice at least somewhat but those same sellers they would much rather the
111.94s: options they sold expire worthless it's just a simpler transaction for them they don't have to move any
117.46s: inventory there's no weekend risk anything like that so the theory in general is market makers are the vast majority of sellers out there on the open marketplace they would
127.94s: prefer their options to expire worthless so come expiration day they are then incentivized to quite literally manipulate the price of the stock to land at maximum
140.26s: pain and I'm going to show you exactly how to find what that looks like on the left hand side over here we have the calculation
146.02s: for it there's a lot of websites that do it for you but I'm also just going to show it to you in think or swim because that's a platform I
151.14s: use and then I'm sure you can find a proxy if you use any sort of regular platform cough cough probably not fucking Robinhood but other than those dorks
159.70s: but come on man you have one fatal flaw Robinhood such a dork most things will give you a proxy for maximum pain although they may or
168.42s: may not call it that and I'll show you what that looks like in a second but first let's understand how it's calculated what we need to do is
173.94s: understand the series value for all of the individual strikes in an expiration cycle so what does that mean well if we pop
181.94s: open the platform here let's say we're going to go to the 25 July expiration and typically you want to use the closest
188.26s: expiration it's really prevalent on expiration date itself but because I'm filming this over a weekend there is no zero
194.42s: DTE available right now but this will serve as a proxy essentially what we need to do is see where the vast majority of
201.46s: option value exists so there's two things we have to look at one is the open interest which is this column and then we have to look at the
208.50s: intrinsic value because essentially that would be the value if it expired in the money so you do that for all of the options
215.30s: again there's a simple way to do it don't worry I'm just explaining how it's actually calculated once you get the value for
221.62s: all of the options in that chain then we understand the series the expiration cycle value and we need to find the
230.42s: specific strike price where the vast majority of the greatest value as a dollar amount of options expire worthless that's the maximum
239.54s: pain strikes yet at pain strikes I hope somebody picked that up and then down here like I said it does become more
245.86s: pronounced when expiration cycle gets closer and that's because that's when a lot of hedging is happening and again this
252.26s: comes into play at expiration when the options are about to expire so we talked a little bit about what it's
258.42s: not now hopefully we have an idea of what it is but before I show you exactly how to find it in the
263.94s: platform I want you to take a look at the study not gonna go through it in detail here you are more than
268.66s: capable of looking this up on SSRN as I always say you shouldn't take my word for any of this stuff I'm
274.58s: literally just a dude that talks on the internet like all the other finance content creator youtubers we are
280.66s: just people sharing anecdotes essentially I have a really comprehensive data set on this actually but
287.30s: mine's not peer reviewed this is and this is actually a pretty recent study this is from 19 of
291.62s: ember 2022 and it says no max pain no gain stock return predictability at option expiration and there
298.02s: are some actually really interesting bits in here so I've highlighted those for you but let's take a
302.18s: look this says we construct a measure of potential max pain gain loss stores stocks according to this
308.10s: measure and find that a spread portfolio that buys high max pain stock and sells low max pain stocks
314.82s: generates large positive and statistically significant returns and alphas so essentially with
320.18s: that entire line means if you're new to reading these kinds of things it means that there's an
324.90s: observable tradable trend then down here it says our results provide strong evidence of stock return
330.18s: predictability at the expiration of options we find that these returns reverse after options
335.14s: expiration that's super important because this is talking about stock manipulation the fact that
340.10s: it happens at expiration but then reverse is post would definitely be indicative of some sort of
344.82s: market force causing that movement and then the last thing here this is probably the most important
348.66s: things I can already see the dollar signs lighting up in your eyes but it says our results are
353.86s: especially strong for relatively small in a liquid stocks so all the people that are out there
359.38s: trading zero dte options I will tell you that there is some semblance of it existing but it's very
364.10s: difficult for those to be moved in x like spx or even spy there's a lot of money in those indices
370.82s: so now let's take a quick look on how we can find it so for example what I'm going to do is pull
377.54s: up some options product depth details and right now I have it set to show me the average so this
384.18s: is combining calls and puts into one individual chart for me it's easier to see the other thing you'll
391.06s: notice over here is I have intrinsic value so if we go back really quick and we take a look at
396.26s: if you'll recall the calculation we need to calculate the intrinsic value so that's exactly what
401.54s: we're doing here I'm finding the spot where the intrinsic value is actually the lowest because
407.94s: again that will tell me that that's where maximum pain lives so if we take a look at this graph we
413.06s: can change it to be whatever series you want you want to isolate whatever expiration cycle you're
417.22s: looking at so going off of this 25 July series we can see that maximum pain is right around 45 32 is
423.86s: what I would say options you know it has to move in the full strike price so even though this will
428.34s: show you you know distances between strikes meaning it goes from you know 4400 and then it has
433.38s: decimal point the strikes don't have a decimal point so you just round and you get kind of the
437.14s: closest idea that you have based on what I'm seeing here it's right around like 45 maybe 30 yeah
443.30s: it's like right or somewhere right around 45 35 something like that and what this is really
448.34s: showing us is if I actually change this to open interest we can find the strikes where there's
454.66s: a lot of debt and realistically you would want to do it for calls and puts so that you can get an
459.46s: idea and you know where that strike might live but we can see again pretty simply if you just use
464.82s: this tool over here that we can see the intrinsic value and again we want it to be combined if it's
470.18s: not combined it's kind of more difficult to find now let's take a look at what this looks like
474.34s: in practice I actually went into think or swim and I ran this in on demand so this is kind of the
481.22s: tool where you can look back in time and so this is one clip I think this was from 2018 march of
486.74s: 2018 is when I went back to in time it's just a random day so I went to the open of the day there
493.06s: and it was 275 87 in spy and maximum pain at that point in time was 276 I'm going to show you
501.38s: something this is at the end of the day this was right after the close it closed at 278 76 maximum
507.06s: pain was then 278 what happened Eric you just said at the open of the day it was 276 but then it
512.74s: was 278 alas markets move they don't stay static that's actually one of the issues with using this
519.78s: as a strategy is some people believe that once you understand maximum pain at one point in time
524.42s: that you're good that you're set you know where it's probably going to get pinned to if it's likely to
528.42s: get pinned but the problem is is options move the vast majority of options 60% of them are traded
534.90s: before expiration an important figure because what that means is this is an aesthetic data point if
540.02s: you want to try to use this it typically is a little bit more effective to be closer to actual
545.62s: expiration and then the other thing is depending on where maximum pain lives if we're 10 points off
551.70s: of maximum pain probably not going to trend to maximum pain that's a really difficult leap to make
557.30s: because again it's really important to remember that if we're very close to maximum pain it is
562.26s: entirely possible for market manipulation to occur so that market makers can just bump price just
567.86s: a bit and that's what that study indicates observing so is this the silver bullet you now have the
573.78s: secret recipe to making money and options unfortunately no you're still going to struggle like the
578.26s: rest of us but this isn't interesting phenomenon so my suggestion to people is if you're interested in
584.26s: this kind of stuff track it take a look at it for the next few weeks going forward with things like
589.14s: spy and spx there's an expiration nearly every day so you could do this you can create a data sample
594.34s: like really quick now with all the expressions available to us and you can see does it trend to
598.82s: this or does it not and then you can start to think about different trade hypothesis that you use
603.22s: around that so for example personally i like to trade zero dt spx short straddles sometimes iron
608.82s: flies and i purposefully wait until later in the day and i will look at maximum pain that's not
615.38s: the center of my universe for the trade but it's an additive input because then if i realize that
621.14s: where a couple points off of maximum pain i might tend to move my strikes a little bit or wait
627.14s: a little bit longer until i kind of get some confirmation if we're moving in that direction
631.06s: it's the kind of thing that there is efficacy behind it but this isn't gonna fix all your problems
635.86s: so if you have any questions any follow-ups on this let me know don't forget to like,
