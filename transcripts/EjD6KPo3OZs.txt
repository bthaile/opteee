0.00s: What's up everyone?
2.88s: Welcome back to the Outlier podcast.
4.64s: We have you and some clear back.
6.20s: I actually reached out to him for this podcast with a little bit more of a specific
10.80s: idea in mind.
11.80s: A lot of times we talk a little more broadly about markets and volatility, but I was
16.64s: recently having a couple conversation with folks and it still strikes me.
23.32s: The misinformation and the misunderstanding that exists between the overlap and then glorious
31.72s: lack thereof between institutional and retail traders.
36.64s: So I immediately thought of you and to have a conversation about this because he's done
41.92s: both.
42.92s: He's done institutional, then you took a break, you did your personal account for a little
46.92s: bit, then you went back.
48.64s: So you have like a very deep level of experience on both sides of this equation at a professional
55.96s: level.
56.96s: So I'm actually really really stoked to talk to you about this because I think I refer
61.44s: to these things as like trap tasks where it's like you could think you're doing the
65.40s: right thing, but in thinking you're doing the right thing, you can kind of hurt yourself.
69.36s: So I want to explore that world a little bit with you, but before is always thanks for
74.64s: coming to hang out for a little bit and share in your knowledge.
78.64s: No problem, I just got the constant winding in the background.
81.72s: I don't know what his deal is.
83.28s: Anyway, thanks for having me back.
87.60s: Let's see if we can disappoint some people who don't like the stuff we're saying to them
92.40s: literally for free.
94.40s: That was good.
95.40s: I showed people because we were just winding about it.
97.64s: Right.
98.64s: Yeah.
99.64s: No, and they're going to be there.
100.64s: So I'm excited to hear what they got.
102.64s: But first, I thought we could start just like a very high level.
107.44s: If you were to summarize what institutions are doing versus retail and I know even institutions
115.24s: is kind of an annoying way of frame-exters so many different things going on there.
119.32s: But at like a super high level, if you were to explain to a second year trader, what's
125.12s: the difference between institutions and retail, what would you say?
130.00s: I mean, that's, that is really tough actually because we talk about the differences
136.88s: in sort of the way they're set up, the way they're funded.
144.76s: I mean, okay, we could just before I go on, we could start there, right?
149.08s: It's like sometimes people say, you know, what's your track record?
152.92s: And that's kind of an indication that they don't have any idea what institutional trading
157.20s: is like.
158.20s: Because I could tell you the track record of the firm I worked for, but I can't tell you my
165.24s: track record because that involved doing a whole bunch of different things all the time
169.60s: and moving around from place to place and you're literally working for someone.
174.12s: And you never, you don't know what your return on capital is because you're given a,
180.32s: it's not like even at a hedge fund, you're given there.
182.76s: There's $100 million at the end of the year, you've got $110 million.
187.68s: Easy math, right?
188.92s: If you work in a trading firm, you don't get an account like that.
192.68s: Like you see your account equity go up or down, but you don't know how much risk capital
196.64s: is being allocated to it.
198.76s: So when someone's like, what's your track record?
203.72s: The answer is really, I see you don't understand what professional institutional and by
208.84s: that I largely mean sell side stuff.
212.40s: And that's the other thing between buy side and sell sides and normal.
215.52s: Buy side is almost like retail.
219.32s: Whereas most of the big option firms, actually, pretty much all of them are largely
227.00s: sell side.
228.24s: Most of them are providing liquidity market making in one shape or another.
235.84s: And it's obviously there are people who are pure market makers to people who trade positions,
243.36s: but only get in on a bit of the offer or something.
245.60s: And that whole bunch of stuff in the middle.
247.44s: But I would say most institutions are not taking the sort of risks that retail always
256.44s: thinks you need to take to make money.
259.88s: Because they can do it with much, much bigger size in much, much smaller edges.
265.96s: So I mean, almost by definition, professionals are better than retail.
273.28s: And we're going to be honest about that, right?
276.52s: There's no other performance oriented thing in the world where amateurs can beat professionals.
284.92s: That's why the professionals are the professionals.
288.64s: So in their sphere, they are definitely better.
294.52s: Having said that, you take a professional out of his seat.
297.68s: So there's a million bucks sitting in front of your right be screened makes some money.
301.40s: Most of them can't do that either.
302.92s: It's just, it's a very, very different job.
306.60s: Sorry, to start in a row, that's such a fantastic point that I don't think is talked about enough.
312.16s: Could you double click on that?
313.72s: The fact that if you take somebody that it was operating in an institutional capacity doing some function,
319.24s: and then you give them the full suite of just retail and what that is in compasses,
325.48s: how their performance might look there.
329.96s: Well, for a lot of them, they wouldn't have the first clue where to start because there are a piece of a team,
337.20s: right?
338.04s: They might be at the end of a chain of sales groups where they have to make a market,
345.48s: that they're making a market to a structured disc, which is then decomposing it,
350.04s: talking to a sales guy, pitching it to the customer, and then it comes back to them.
354.76s: That's totally different to me saying, there's the S&P option chain.
359.20s: Makes some money.
360.72s: So often they will be literally one part of a production line.
368.32s: But also, even if they're trading, right?
371.20s: They're the Goldman Sachs, equity options trader.
375.28s: How much money is there due to them, and how much money is it because customers are trading with Goldman Sachs?
381.68s: Like you take that guy and you say, you're now trading for ABC Corp.
387.84s: He's not going to get the calls from customers anymore.
390.88s: So even if he acknowledges, I'm making all this money because I'm making markets to customers
396.32s: and the markets are wider, that's not you.
399.68s: That's gold, but now you can do it better than other people, maybe,
404.00s: but you've got to sort of come up with, and this is something I did when I was working at the market
409.68s: making firm.
411.28s: When it came to paying traders, you have to kind of come up with a
417.68s: almost like a replacement level trader, like in baseball.
421.28s: You know, so you've got dollars above replacement, and you're like, look, this is a really,
425.60s: really easy product this year.
427.60s: This guy made 5 million bucks.
429.44s: That's great.
430.24s: But I think a good trader, like that we could pull off one of the other deaths, might have made 10 million
435.60s: bucks.
436.56s: So this guy actually didn't have a very good year and didn't make the money he should have.
442.08s: And there's other guys, you're like, look, this guy's a great trader, but
445.52s: a dispersion, which goes in and out of fashion quite a lot,
450.56s: had a shitty year.
451.92s: So I'm not going to stiff him too much on his bonus, because I know he did really well relative
456.80s: to what he could have done.
458.80s: So I kind of feel like I've gone in circles there.
463.44s: Basically, institutional guys, there's a lot of money they get given because they're at the
468.80s: institution, not because of anything they do.
471.52s: The seat in the franchise has a lot of value.
474.96s: Where is a retail guy has none of that?
478.48s: And then you were also talking about the function, which I think is a, is a really,
482.80s: really important component to double-click, because trading is also one of those really weird
488.08s: things in my opinion, where typically speaking when you're trying to play rugby or if you're trying
494.16s: to get good at jiu-jitsu, you're looking at people that are really, really good, and you're saying,
499.04s: like, how can I emulate them? How can I take pieces of this and try to onboard it?
504.40s: And I think retail traders sometimes struggle with figuring out the pieces that make sense to take
511.36s: and emulate, and then the pieces that don't.
514.64s: And to give you an example here, a lot of times you'll hear retail traders talking about hedging.
520.16s: You'll hear them talk about hedging all the time.
521.76s: And they want to hedge the risk, they want to reduce their downside,
525.60s: which sounds smart, and they're hearing a lot of different kind of institutions talking about that kind
532.32s: of stuff. But then they kind of forget the actual game that they're playing and what that does
537.20s: to their performance. So if you were to think about the functions that institutions do,
545.92s: that you do think are good examples and good elements that retail traders should take and try to
554.00s: integrate it into their trading. What are some of those things that might come to mind?
558.40s: It's not so much the techniques as the general principles.
568.32s: So going back to your hedging example, if you go to a firm like a Jane Street or a Sasko Hanna,
574.88s: their idea of hedging isn't so they don't lose money. Their idea of hedging is so they take away
582.32s: all the risks that they don't want, so they can isolate the exposure to the one thing they do what.
588.08s: So they are literally trying to isolate that edge. Whereas I think with most retail traders
594.80s: that are like, oh, I'm hedging either because it the worst case they think I make money on my hedges,
602.00s: which is, you know, you can't think of a hedges separate from the option. There's a thing called
607.84s: a hedged option that you're doing. So that's the first big confusion. But the second thing is,
613.12s: I'm going to hedge to stop my catastrophic loss, which isn't really a hedge at all. That's kind of
621.28s: you know, it's, I'm not saying it's not the thing to do, but it's not what a professional firm
626.08s: would think of as a hedge. That's like a different layer of risk management above that.
631.36s: So I would say that your average retail person gets that wrong and they try to hedge in a way that
640.88s: can't possibly be cost effective for them. Could you give it an example of that?
649.04s: Yeah, hedging. Anything you do. Basically, most jobs to get better at them, you do more of them.
657.12s: You become a better baker by baking more cakes. With trading, you become a better trader by taking
663.44s: your hands off the keyboard and letting things play out. Because every time you touch the keyboard
668.56s: a cost you money, and it's really insidious, right? Because you're thinking, oh, I might make
675.68s: 5000 bucks on this trade. Why do I care that I paid 50 bucks and spreads to give in?
681.52s: Then it's because it's always 50 bucks. You might make 5000, but whether you make 5000 or
688.96s: lose 5000, you've got that 50 bucks always and it adds up. It can never be in your favor. So I think
696.56s: the professional spend a lot more time focusing on cost reduction. And I mean, that's one of the
701.92s: things, one of the boring things you actually do inside a professional organization has spent time on
707.68s: the phone talking to your clearing agent and stuff, trying to negotiate half a penny better
713.60s: commissions on options. Because that's for money. If you can get that down, that's huge. Whereas I don't
721.60s: think most retail spend, I don't think they have the amount of fear of transaction costs that they
727.76s: really should. Especially now when there are tons of brokers saying, you know, commission free.
733.44s: Well, commission. Yeah. Well, the CBOE are giving you commission free. And
740.24s: sit down a lot, making buckets on all that stuff out of the goodness of Ken Griffin's heart. So,
745.76s: you know, you always pay somewhere. And I think your average retail person trades way too much.
758.16s: When I first started trying to teach other people about anything, I kind of thought that the
764.32s: best way for a retail person to not lose money was to do more stuff like the professionals.
772.16s: And I still think that's true in some regards. You've got to treat it like a business. And I don't mean
779.76s: even if it's not your business. But I'm saying you have to almost have a business plan. And you
784.64s: have to be really detail oriented. And professionals are, right? Like you get to the office two hours
791.84s: before the market opens and go through all your clearing statements to make sure there was no mismetchers.
797.68s: And you make sure everything's in the right account. And it's all just detailed bullshit like that.
802.64s: Whereas I don't think most retail people go through that. So that kind of detail oriented business
810.24s: plan thing. You definitely can learn from the professionals. The other things psychology.
816.08s: Right? How many sort of beginning traders do you talk to who are like, oh, I've got traders
821.84s: block. I just couldn't pull the trigger on that one. It was like, greedy. If you if you pull that
828.16s: bullshit as a professional trader, you lose your job. Like no one cares, you didn't quite feel it today.
836.24s: Do you job, right? And that's something that I think instead of reading all this nonsense about
842.56s: trading psychology, it's just actually like a goddamn adult come to work, do you job? Don't be
849.84s: a dickhead and then go home. That's what professionals have to do. And I think amateur could
855.12s: learn a lot from that. Most trading psychology problems go away if you're like, I'm thinking of
860.88s: myself as a professional. I just come here, I do what I meant to do if I feel bad about it, if I feel
867.52s: good about it, don't care, pull the trigger, go, just do it. So I think that's something really
874.72s: people could learn a lot from. And a quick blog on that on your behalf, and I'm still trying to
883.04s: get you to release this book, but the FedPACs talks about that exact thing. And it's actually a
889.60s: fantastic section in there. So that's why I attempt to get you to release that book still.
894.80s: Well, I'm not releasing it. I mean, I don't care if people give it to other people.
899.52s: I doubt that I'll ever publish it because publisher who reached out to me wanted me to make it
908.40s: three times as long. And I don't want to make it three times as long because I don't think
913.12s: this is the right time. So that section in there was perfect on that. Retail options trading
920.00s: does have a section on that stuff as well. I think a lot of traders like to sort of think of
925.28s: themselves as uniquely heroic workers who no one else understands the stress and pain I'm in.
933.84s: Clearly, these people have never worked McDonald's at lunchtime or taught a bunch of kindergarteners.
941.20s: There's a lot of stressful jobs out there. Trading isn't unique. It's not even a stressful job
949.20s: I've had. It's just a job just do it. I think retail could learn a lot from that kind of attitude.
958.32s: Where I think they go wrong is they sort of see what they think pros do from the outside.
964.40s: And there's a lot of people on Twitter who play into this who should know better.
968.88s: But they'll be talking about Greeks here and implied vols here and skew and sticky strike and
975.36s: all that stuff. That's important if you're Ben I for it and you're trading cardal variants
982.32s: swaps against VIX futures. But retail can't trade cardal variants swaps anyway. If all you're doing
988.96s: is going to be banging out a one week SPY Strangle, none of that stuff is really, that's not going
996.24s: to make you money. That's sort of that's lopping is being a pro. And I think that's the impression
1004.72s: a lot of people give that that's what you should take from the pros. And it really isn't. If you're
1011.36s: trading the stuff retail can trade that stuff isn't the important stuff. And then it leads on to the
1017.68s: real shit. I don't know if I can call anyone a scammer now without listening to their side of the story.
1025.68s: But a lot of the the gamma feedback guys, I think that plays into it.
1035.60s: Because everyone's oh this gamma feedback makes me feel like a pro. And there's a lot of things wrong
1043.52s: with that whole process. So anyway, I feel like we're sort of going around the circles a bit.
1050.16s: No, you hit a couple super like super high level items in there that are really important
1057.36s: in terms of things that retail can pull. One that you didn't talk about that I'm curious
1063.28s: your take on is a prox to risk.
1065.84s: I think retail are two of this to small risks and leave themselves open to catastrophic risks.
1085.60s: Whereas the professionals, the suscohanners of the world, they don't think of losing a million
1093.28s: dollars and a day as a risk. That's just what happens if you're tossing a coin. It comes up
1098.56s: heads 55% of the time. Well, you know, 45% of the time you're going to be losing money. That's not
1103.60s: a risk. That's just part of the business plan, right? That's but where they want lose. They won't
1111.36s: lose a billion dollars. Whereas there's tons of retail who look at a strategy and they say, oh,
1117.04s: you know what, on average, I make $1,000 a week. That's great. But there's some weeks where I
1123.44s: lose $1,000. I don't like that. I'm going to stop myself out so I can only lose $2,000. And by
1130.40s: doing that, all they've really done is they've hedged away the risk by getting paid for.
1136.08s: You've got to accept that every strategy you've got has a sort of an intrinsic risk reward profile.
1142.40s: You know, and if you're winning on average, $1,000 a week, look, legitimately winning that on average,
1149.36s: well, if it takes you a $5,000 loser every couple of months, just deal with it. I mean,
1157.04s: that's part of that game. But what you shouldn't ever do is like lose your house.
1163.84s: You know, it's like you should never be in a situation where you can go bankrupt. And I think that
1170.72s: the other risks people should be ensuring themselves against. Not the, I lost a little bit of money,
1176.72s: I feel sad. I mean, that's part of the game. I mean, this is something some people should do.
1184.32s: I really encourage everyone to learn how to program at least enough to do Monte Carlo simulation.
1189.60s: And now there's chat GPT. You don't need to really need to learn. Just ask it how to do it.
1195.20s: Um, simulate a sharp force strategy and see how many days in a year that loses money.
1202.80s: You know, and by the way, if you genuinely have a sharp force strategy that scales,
1208.00s: you are like an all-time super legend, better than Steve Cohen, better than Kim Griffin.
1214.96s: You know, Kim Griffin isn't really a trader. I mean, he's made a lot of money and I'm not criticizing
1219.76s: him because what he does is fine, but he's probably not a very good example.
1224.00s: Um, if you have a sharp force strategy and you're not making some mistake and
1228.96s: you just haven't seen the big risk it, you're doing great. But see how many days a year you'd losing.
1234.96s: And I think the pros are much better at accepting that as part of the overall risk package.
1240.72s: Um, but the pros are never exposed to, you know, I can lose my business, lose my house, that kind of thing,
1248.08s: which is why it's such a big news when it's one of them blows up.
1251.12s: Right. It's almost always a particular trader who's hidden something.
1256.88s: I mean, it's almost never the firm deliberately took that risk. There's one case I know where
1264.72s: they did, but usually it's, it's kind of a, sort of, it's a failure of process between the trader
1272.00s: and the risk management and the, the sea sweet. Right. Right. You mentioned something in there that
1280.32s: I want to double click into the, just sequence over turn the path where you can have something
1288.48s: that on average makes a thousand, every once in a while will lose five. Retail in my opinion sometimes,
1299.12s: if they don't know a strategy well enough, when they see the first five pop up,
1305.52s: five thousand dollar loss. And then let's say that the next five thousand dollar loss happens in two
1311.04s: weeks versus, you know, another couple months. Then they say to themselves, like, oh, shit,
1316.72s: I've lost 10, that just wiped out, you know, the last 10 months or 10 weeks. I'm sorry of gains.
1324.32s: Right. I don't like this anymore. I'm going to switch.
1327.44s: Could you talk about that? Yeah. Um, for two reasons, you shouldn't monitor with a things of working
1341.68s: by watching your PML. Um, obviously your PML at the end of the day is the most important thing.
1347.92s: But we're really talking about at the end of the day being at the end of your trading career.
1352.96s: We're not talking about any given day. Because what will happen is people will do a very careful analysis
1360.08s: they'll go over five years of data, you know, thousands of data points come up with a strategy.
1365.44s: And then I'll trade it for two weeks and go, oh, shit. But if I told you, I've got a trading
1371.12s: strategy and I've tested it on two weeks of data, you'll be like, there's nothing. I mean,
1375.60s: what the hell? That's nothing. So people tend to massively overwate the very short period
1381.76s: they've been trading something relative to all the time that they've tested. So
1388.96s: statistically, that's a massive problem. And I don't know why people do that, but they do.
1394.40s: And that's we probably shouldn't be saying retail as if retail are bad and pros are good.
1402.32s: Because I know a lot of, I don't know a lot. I know some very good retail traders. Some of the
1406.88s: best traders I know are definitely on the retail side. Retail isn't amateur. The opposite of
1413.28s: retail's institutional, not, it's not amateur and professional. So we should say sort of beginning
1422.00s: retail traders maybe. But they definitely make that mistake where they they're moved experience
1428.96s: massively overwhelms the statistics that they've got. And if you set them down and talk them through it,
1436.56s: they, these people aren't dumb. They would say, oh yeah, you're right. But when they're in the midst of it,
1442.56s: they feel that way. And I feel like a lot of the communities they've got around them, which can be really
1448.16s: good. I think other people in their desire to help screw that process up even more by sort of saying,
1457.36s: oh, well, that's because of this, it's because of this. So they're going to nice simple strategy.
1462.72s: And then they start overlaying all these things based on a very short time period. Like, oh,
1467.76s: God, this thing doesn't work on a Thursday, obviously, because I don't know natural gas inventorys
1472.80s: come out or something, whatever. But also, so doing that statistically is bad. But doing that
1480.32s: cycle, that's terrible for your psychological health. You can't attach any degree of self-worth
1488.16s: to something that's almost a random process. You know, because if you're going to be like,
1493.20s: either great day today, everything's happy. Oh my God, everything's terrible. Well, again,
1499.20s: the best traders in the world, you're going to be losing them awful lot. You can't do that.
1505.52s: You've got to, and I think if you hang around this game long enough, you get kind of used to that,
1511.44s: you know, like, I'm not saying I enjoy losing money, but like, my typical day, you lose money,
1517.60s: you're like, all right, whatever, it's still decent week, I still, you know, you're a count might swing
1523.36s: around 2% a day, right? But at the end of the week, you know, oh, I'm not 1%. You know, so it's not,
1531.04s: that 2% is just a lot of it's just noise, and you've got to sort of see how I'm attracting over
1536.24s: the long run. So that's a big problem. I think people get into as well.
1542.40s: Speaking of that problem specifically, if you were to recommend or at least give some ideas on
1553.04s: how you can approach that, I think a lot of people will find themselves in the scenario where they,
1561.60s: they're comfortable. They think it's good. Then they see those bad couple days that just happen
1566.32s: to happen in that sequence, and then like the fear hits, then it's all the questions of like,
1572.00s: oh shit, did I do this right, did I miss something and so on and so forth? So if you were to just
1577.92s: talk to somebody about how they might even attempt to navigate that, what might you say?
1584.40s: I'm going to assume that the person has done all the backtesting properly and they've got
1590.64s: a strategy that really as comfortable as you can be, you know, because that's the other thing.
1596.80s: There's almost always a million things you don't know, right? And it doesn't, I think it's better
1601.76s: that someone understands, I've done the strategy and it tests really well, but in the real world,
1607.04s: who the hell knows, right? You know, a comment could hit the exchange, something. So as long as
1614.56s: you acknowledge that real life is a lot messy of an any-back test. I think after that, there's a few things,
1624.64s: you probably know this if you've done martial arts, it's an old samurai trick, I guess actually,
1630.56s: a lot of soldiers might feel this way. I don't know, Marines don't like to say their soldiers, but,
1635.20s: you know, we give you grace. As soon before you've done a trade that you're going to lose,
1642.64s: you know, and then it's kind of like before you go into a battle of samurai,
1646.96s: I would sit down and convince themselves they would go to die. And that's the worst thing,
1650.72s: they don't accept that that's the worst thing that can happen. And so when they don't die, it's all
1655.44s: upside. And that sounds like a really stupid trick. Funny thing about psychology is we're really
1661.20s: good at tricking ourselves with practice enough. So you can use all these stupid bullshit tricks.
1668.08s: I mean, largely they're called together if you want to make it scientific, that's behavioral,
1672.40s: you know, cognitive, behavioral therapy. So you can convince yourself like that. So one of the tricks
1678.00s: I like to do is like if I'd missed an earnings trade and I know it's blown right through earnings
1684.96s: and I'm short to struggle and I know it's going to suck. I'm like, okay, I think and I know intellectually,
1695.04s: maybe I'm going to lose 20,000 bucks. But I'll convince myself before I open the trading screen.
1702.32s: I'm like, I've got to probably lose 100,000 dollars here. I've got to probably lose 100,000
1708.00s: shit. And then you open it and you're like, wow, I've only lost 20,000 bucks. That doesn't
1714.40s: feel nearly as bad. And you know this from trading, right? When you're you're having a shitty day
1718.64s: and you've lost, I don't know, $10,000 and then the market comes back and you're only end up losing
1724.72s: 2000. Like today, for example, right? Sure. And then you're like, that was actually a pretty good day.
1731.92s: But if you had a day when you were making 20,000 and you were that I'm losing 2000, you'd be totally
1737.52s: different mood. So it's like how you get to that loss actually matters psychologically and awful lot.
1744.56s: So that's a trick I like to use on myself at works. Also, just don't trade big enough that it's
1750.48s: going to kill you. You know, if you legitimately can't handle for any reason financially or emotionally,
1758.32s: if you can't handle or losses you're getting, well, stop doing that. You know, it's like,
1764.24s: it hurts when I do this. Well, stop doing that. I mean, that's not really a magic thing, right?
1770.08s: It's like if anything else is like that, you know, you don't have to trade as big. If you get to
1776.24s: the point where you really can't trade big enough to make any money at all. I mean, that's okay.
1782.72s: Maybe trading's just not for you. I mean, if you're thinking of this as like a part-time thing,
1788.64s: there's a hobby, something that's fun, you don't have to do it if it's not fun. That's one of
1794.48s: the big advantages retail do have. Like I said, a pros got an advantage because they just
1799.44s: come in and act like it's their job. Retails got the other advantage. They don't have to do it.
1805.44s: You know, if it's making you feel sick, just take up another hobby, take the dog for a walk,
1811.28s: go surfing. There's a lot of other things you can do in life. And then finally, obviously,
1817.20s: there's one's experience really helps. Once you've lost money a lot of times, it's just another
1823.20s: day. You know, the losses come along, the wins come along. You know, it all fades away in the end.
1831.92s: You mentioned something before that I think is probably commonly overlooked, which is
1841.12s: sizing things so that it doesn't necessarily kill you or cause too much pain. And I
1847.60s: wager a lot of those instances come from cases where traders are too focused on how much they're
1854.72s: trying to make. And I know personally, my largest percent drawdown on my account came from
1861.68s: exact such a trade where I was trading this super wide iron condor in the rut. And I was just trying
1868.48s: to make like a few hundred bucks over a week or two. I don't remember it was back in college.
1872.64s: And I was just so focused on how much I was trying to make that I didn't really fully appreciate
1878.40s: the risk side of the equation. If you were to walk through and for a folks familiar with your work,
1886.16s: you share frameworks on how to think about this with like fractional Kelly and tools like
1890.96s: that to actually help inform sizing. But if you were to walk through the major muscle movements
1896.96s: on that person, let's say placing that earnings trade. And we know every once in a while,
1900.80s: you're going to get a forced interdiviation move. It's going to pop up sometime.
1905.04s: Right. How do you walk them through that sizing protocol?
1911.12s: Okay, well the only the ultimate sizing rule, however you express it mathematically, is you want to,
1919.44s: if you lose, you don't want that loss to kill you. And if you make money, you want it to be enough
1925.60s: money to make the whole thing worthwhile. So if you can't come up with that balance, and there's
1931.60s: a lot of stuff you could mathematicize on that, right? When I say worthwhile, you could turn that
1936.16s: into a utility function, or it's kind of stuff. But if you can't come up with a healthy sort of
1942.16s: happy balance between, you know, if I make a thousand bucks, I'd really happy with that. It's worth
1948.48s: doing. And if I lose on the same trade, $2,000, I can handle that. If you can't come up with that
1957.20s: balance, you can't do that trade. And I think, again, it goes back to this idea that trades
1964.48s: have a intrinsic risk profile of their own. And at a certain point, you can't really change that.
1971.76s: You can't change it by putting in stops or adding options or something. You kind of have to be
1977.36s: pretty comfortable with what the market's giving you. And I think where people really go wrong with
1983.68s: this is selling the iron condolking, people decide they want to make a certain amount. It doesn't,
1991.92s: you can't make a certain amount. You can only make what the market's giving you. If the
1996.48s: if the ball is like 30%, you know, you might be able to sell one option and make a thousand bucks.
2004.32s: But if all five percent, you might be like, I have to sell 20 options to make a thousand bucks.
2009.68s: The problem with that is, for normal movements, your risk is described by the Greeks.
2018.24s: For big movements, there's only one risk and that's the net number of options.
2023.04s: Because for big movements, that's the only thing that matters.
2027.28s: Like if you're short 20 options, I don't care what your Greeks are. You've got 20 times as much
2031.68s: catastrophe risk as if you're short one option. And if you go basically yield hunting
2038.72s: and try to make the same amount of money each time, you are going to blow up. I guarantee it.
2046.40s: Actionable inside for you. You don't do that. It's one of the worst things you can do. And that's
2051.20s: one of, when I said the only institutional case I know of where they did this knowingly, that's what
2058.72s: they were trying to do. Absolutely. Sorry. Option sellers.com, the net gas. Oh, no, I kind of
2069.76s: you just let pass that one. I think if him more is retail, this is what I mean.
2075.92s: No, this was a, this was a hedge fund called LKM. And they lost, they say they lost billions,
2085.92s: billion dollars in two days. But I saw their position beforehand and I know what the market did.
2092.64s: They lost basically a billion dollars in 10 minutes. And that was because as they were selling
2099.20s: options, which is fine. I mean, for a start, selling options usually has the edge. Right? We all know
2106.80s: that. Also, there's no trade that's always good or bad. It's the price you get in there.
2116.96s: So if I'm selling it up, go back to your own condoler, right? When you're like, oh, I just sell
2121.36s: our condols. Really? Would you sell it for a cent? No. So you don't just sell our condols. Right?
2127.12s: You've got some sort of lower price limit. So everyone, you basically have to have that. You can't
2133.68s: just be totally price and sensitive and say the edge is in iron condols. There's always a price
2139.68s: where you should buy stuff too. And I think that's another mistake retail make as they think
2144.72s: their edges in the structure. So they become price in sensitive around that structure. I'm going
2151.12s: to sell all iron condor, zero DTI in condor. And you know, every money vols 5%. You've probably got
2158.64s: a edge. But you've got a lot of risk here. And you're not going to make much money if you're
2165.20s: right because the amount of premiums minuscule. So maybe you just don't want to do that trade.
2172.16s: And a lot of people won't take that on board. There's another action more insight.
2179.44s: Don't trade zero DTIs. I mean, the amount of money you can make is pretty small because
2189.04s: the premiums are pretty low. And the costs relative to the amount of money you can make are huge.
2198.00s: Because your age is in volatility spread, but your costs are in dollars. Your costs on that are
2205.92s: the same with vols 4%. As if it is 40%. So I'll trade zero DTIs of vols over 20. I mean,
2214.48s: I'm not going to trade them a vols under 7 or 8 or something. I mean, there's no, there's it just
2220.80s: doesn't make sense. It's not from a risk perspective, but just because I've cost perspective. How
2225.28s: much money can you make? So could you? Why people do want to trade zero DTIs to be honest?
2232.16s: You know exactly why. Well, okay, true. It's a quick hit of dopamine. You get to do something
2241.68s: every day. You feel active. There's just not much engine it. And everything you do in zero DTIs,
2249.60s: if you're doing it in a sensible way, you can do that in one week options as well. It's not different.
2255.68s: It's the same thing. It's just you're not doing it every day. So if you've got a thing that
2262.80s: works in zero DTIs and it's a legit thing, it's going to work in weeklies too. Or monthlys.
2270.40s: You said something earlier that I want to hone in on with respect to just vol, right? You're
2276.72s: saying, vol 7 versus 20, which scenario would be more appealing to you. I noticed there that
2284.32s: you didn't say something like implied volatility rank is high, which I think is another really,
2292.00s: really common mistake when people hang all the way around things like volatility rank always,
2298.56s: not even understanding like the scoop potential for something like that. Could you talk about
2305.76s: why in that instance you were looking at raw vall and you were already set it by the way with
2310.40s: respect to premiums, but just to elucidate the point a little bit more.
2316.32s: Okay, so volatility, this is something that's, it's not tricky, but it might be,
2325.84s: I don't know, people, it's difficult sometimes to explain this correctly. Volatility behaves differently
2332.56s: when you're looking at a rank across different stocks as opposed to how a volatility works in
2340.40s: a single stock. So when you say, when I say in the cross section volatility is high,
2345.36s: that's when I take every stock that has options on it and I rank them by IV. So you know, the highest
2351.36s: one is some biotech company, none of us have ever heard of it. And the lowest ones, I don't know,
2356.48s: camera suit or something. There is definitely edge there in selling the ones with the highest
2362.56s: vall and buying the ones with the lowest vall. As a cross sectional thing, that works.
2367.76s: It doesn't work as well as it used to for very clear reasons. Back when it worked really well,
2374.24s: you had to go and make all those calculations yourself. You had to pull in all the options days,
2378.96s: I calculate the implied vall, keep track of all the stuff in a massive database, huge amount of work.
2384.48s: Now you can sign up for almost any, you know, $30 a month service and they'll do it all for you.
2390.56s: You would expect the edge to have gone away. Hasn't gone away completely,
2394.80s: edges like that rarely completely go away, but it's not as good as it was.
2401.36s: But the other thing is, if you have a, if you're just looking at the vall of a single stock
2407.60s: through time, selling it when it's vall gets high is usually the wrong way around.
2415.52s: When it's vall gets high, it's usually a very low variance premium. Because people, you can't just
2424.56s: look at the level of vall, you have to look at the variance premium. And usually implied vall is
2430.00s: understating, you know, implied vall might do this when the realized vall is doing that,
2436.88s: which means when implied vall's low, there tends to be a pretty high volatility edge and when it's high,
2443.68s: it's the other way around. So, can we, sorry, sorry to interrupt. I just
2448.56s: talking about rank over time or in the cross section, totally different.
2455.04s: Got it. Yeah, and so, and sorry to interrupt. I wanted to, and really emphasize the point that you just
2462.80s: made and draw it out a little bit more. A lot of times when people are saying like, oh, I'm going to
2469.92s: sell vall when IVR is high. And you were talking about the difference between vall itself,
2478.08s: ranked against itself versus the risk premium. I can talk about the difference of
2486.88s: a stock's vall compared to its historical, what has been in the past. And a stock's vall
2494.56s: versus all the other stocks. So, that ranking scheme works in the way you would think it would.
2501.92s: The ranking thing based on where it's been through time is a much, much slippery
2507.44s: and I don't think there's a great deal of edge in that and if you're just treating that mechanically,
2513.20s: chances are you're on the wrong side of that. If what you're doing is selling and this is,
2518.96s: no one said this stuff was easy, right? But that's not true. A lot of people say it's easy,
2523.04s: but it's not. One of the problems you get is if you're selling vall, you can often be wrong and
2528.64s: still make money, right? Because the edge is naturally on that side. So, this is one of the reasons
2535.60s: it's difficult to convince people that selling iron condols when implied vall is five is bad.
2542.08s: It's difficult to convince someone that doing the wrong thing if they're making money.
2546.00s: Right? So, if you're selling 10 delta 2 delta iron condols, you're going to make money most of the time.
2553.04s: So, anyway, the, a lot of things in the volatility world that you think should be true
2562.64s: just really aren't. And that's selling something, selling vall when it's high. So, like,
2568.48s: I mean, if anything you should buy vall when it's high.
2572.16s: Now, the traditional thought process behind that and I think it's really, really important to
2581.60s: double-click into this is the thought process typically, and I know you know this,
2587.44s: when implied volatility rank is high, people are told volatility is mean reverting.
2592.88s: And they're told that the rubber band is stretched and then they're essentially selling the
2598.00s: expected collapse of that rubber band. Can you explain why that dynamic doesn't work the way that they
2603.12s: think it does? Well, same volatility's mean reverting is true, but the mean's also change.
2611.68s: You know, so if you, if you sold volatility in, I don't know, March 2020,
2618.96s: right? Volatility didn't go back to 15 for about a year, right? Volatility had a new normal. So,
2627.28s: just because something's mean reverting doesn't mean you'll make money because it comes back.
2631.76s: The other thing that can be wrong is you're not directly trading volatility. You're trading the
2637.44s: spread between implied and realized. And that doesn't have to be mean reverting and it doesn't
2642.72s: have to be negatively correlated with the level of volatility either. So, just because the implied
2648.32s: vol comes down, that's not necessarily going to help you if the realized vol still is higher than the
2654.56s: implied. So, you can do things that sort of mitigate that, like you can trade options,
2661.60s: they have more Vagre exposure and less gamer exposure, but the market's not stupid.
2667.04s: They're not going to have gone up nearly as much as the ones at the front of the curve. So,
2674.64s: yeah, that's one of the problems people get wrong. It's selling volatility spikes isn't as appealing
2681.68s: as it looks as when you look at the VIX graph over time and you're like, oh, the VIX,
2688.24s: these spikes that always comes down again. Yeah, but you're that's not what you're trading when
2693.60s: you're trading options. That part I think is probably completely foreign, especially for new
2702.16s: traders to hear, or a new trader they think when they're selling premium that when Vol goes down,
2710.40s: they've now made money. You made a really important point with respect to the relationship
2717.52s: between implied vol and realizable. So, for that same new trader,
2723.52s: what's a specific way that they could gauge when a good time to sell might instead be,
2732.64s: instead of using IVR? Well, forget about volatility, all right?
2737.92s: volatility is just a way of turning option prices into another thing. It relies on model.
2744.16s: Forget about all the. Right? Let's see you've got a straddle and the straddle is trading at five
2749.68s: bucks and that straddle normally is trading at two bucks. So, you're like, oh, that's really high. I'll sell
2754.72s: it. And then as soon as you sell it, it moves by $10. You know, the stock moves by $10. So,
2760.40s: you've just got hammered, right? But, you know, the straddle drops down to a dollar.
2764.88s: So, you will rise about the price of the straddle, but you won't really just trading that.
2770.48s: If the stock hadn't moved in the straddle of drop, just buy it back and you made money.
2775.04s: And that's what's happened. It happens over earnings. But I think in general, people have to
2780.32s: remember that implied volatility is the price of the straddle at any point. But the thing that's
2786.80s: going to be important to you is, okay, but think it in the simplest possible terms. What you've
2793.44s: done is you've made a bet that we're not going to move by more than the straddle at the price
2798.48s: you sold it. The volatility changing just means you might be able to buy it back later on.
2803.68s: But you should always kind of think, I've done this trade. I'm going to have to hold it to
2806.96s: exploration. What happens then? So, going back to when people should be confident about selling things?
2817.04s: I mean, that's kind of a... people aren't going to like hearing this answer either.
2825.84s: But the variance premium is just sort of something you have to buy into that exists on average.
2835.04s: It's really hard to time. It looks like it should be easy because you look at the vets.
2841.52s: But if you look at the actual variance premium itself, it's got way less of a pattern in it.
2847.76s: Timing it is really hard. So you'll default position has to be unless something nuts is happening.
2856.40s: I'm going to have a core short-volt position. And buy something nuts. It's easier. Again,
2863.20s: don't get tied up in the math so much. Don't be like looking at a specific,
2869.84s: you know, garge model or something. Forget about all that. You know when something is nuts.
2876.08s: Right? I'm not talking about the difference between v-vix of 85 and 88 going through some
2883.28s: moving average or something. I'm saying, okay, if v-vix is 120, that market's crazy.
2891.44s: If the... the... if the contender of the vix futures has done that, that market's crazy.
2899.44s: And all of these the market's crazy indicators tend to come along at the same time.
2906.16s: So, you know, vix spikes, the term structure's going to flip. v-vix is going to go up.
2912.24s: The equal weighted vix is going to go up. The nine-day vix, you see what I mean? Like all
2917.28s: these things will do the same thing. So it doesn't really matter which one you're watching.
2921.36s: As long as you have a good idea of the difference between normal and crazy, and then basically,
2930.00s: you just avoid crazy. That's pretty much as good as you can do unless you go full time and spend
2937.84s: all your time building a really complicated v-v-v-v, which I wouldn't recommend. And the same way
2943.92s: that I wouldn't recommend anyone doing that cross section or across all the stocks thing.
2949.12s: It's just a really hard way to get a one-and-a-half sharp strategy. There are easy ways to approach
2955.44s: the world than that. So if you just want to basic rule, you should be selling v-v-v-v as a core
2962.88s: position, stick to indices because they have a much more consistent volatility premium than stocks.
2971.52s: Don't try and pick and choose between stocks that much more difficult than much more videos
2976.64s: and credit. With an exception, I'm going to come to one second. When the market goes nuts and
2983.20s: volatility is really high, just relax. You don't have to sell v-v-v-v at the top tick. Don't sell
2990.88s: it when it's going up. So when it's coming down. And you don't even have to worry about, say,
2996.80s: when the vix went to like AC, you don't even have to worry about, I want to sell it at 60 on the
3001.60s: way down. You can relax. Sell it 30 because you're going to make more money selling vull when vull
3008.96s: is in medium to low levels. So that's when I say about the zero DTE when they're trading a five
3015.28s: vull, there's going to be edge there. The problem is you have to weigh that edge against the cost.
3021.84s: So that's slightly different issue. But generally stick to selling vull when the vix is in
3028.80s: 25 to 15 range. When it's much lower than that, you don't get enough premium to cover your
3035.76s: costs. When it's higher than that, this probably not much variance premium at all.
3042.16s: The one thing I would say about stocks is when stocks go into bubbles, there are definitely
3048.00s: there's a death of opportunity there. The difficult thing with this is you have to be patient
3053.28s: and it has to really be a bubble. And it can't be a bubble like Tesla is a bubble. I'm not
3058.40s: talking about being disconnected from its fundamental valuation. What's the PE of Tesla now?
3064.56s: I don't know. 100. Millia. You know, how long here is like 600 plus? It's really high, right?
3071.84s: But Tesla's had a high PE forever. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the sort of bubble
3077.12s: where the stock just goes like this. I'm talking about GM E, AMC, all that kind of stuff.
3084.80s: When you're in that kind of thing and vull is really high, you've almost got a free bit.
3092.16s: But the worst thing you can do is to sell the calls. Because remember, you probably do remember
3099.44s: when GM E started off, I think it was about eight. Went to 16, went to 32.
3106.40s: You would completely be legitimately okay to say, I think it's now on a bubble.
3112.64s: I'll sell calls. So you sell 50 calls, right? Then it goes to 500.
3118.00s: Once something's in a bubble, it can continue to be in a bubble. Like it's doing something stupid.
3123.28s: And once someone's stupid, this stupidity knows no bounds. Right? Once it's become unmoored from reality.
3131.60s: So selling calls is insane. Buying calls is probably the second worst thing you can do, because
3138.32s: you're paying way too much money. The opportunity here is to sell ports.
3146.00s: Because if you're selling ports, when implied vull is super high,
3150.00s: the implied vull is now correlated with the stock move. Like GM E, the vull when it started, I don't
3155.68s: know, probably like 50 or 60. When it went nuts, I don't know what it was, because my system
3161.12s: topped out in a thousand. So it was above a thousand, right? So we know vull has gone up as the
3168.48s: stock's gone up. So what happens when the stock comes down? Vull comes down. So I'm selling ports.
3176.88s: I'm getting a huge premium for those because vull's high. If the stock keeps going up,
3182.32s: well that's fine, right? Those ports are going to expire worthless. But if the stock goes down,
3188.80s: I've got a huge cushion there because vull's going to come in. So if the stock drops,
3194.80s: if let's say I sell the 40% so I'm selling the 200 strike puts when the GM E's 500.
3203.20s: And it implied vull's a thousand. If it drops back to 200, then implied vull is probably going to drop
3209.44s: back to 200. It's quite likely I'll make money because the viga is made up for any delta effect.
3218.40s: So that's the other, that's a, that is a really, really good trade. Actionable trade. The problem
3227.52s: is you can't force that. Don't go out now and look around on a stock screen if the stuff that's
3233.84s: in a bubble. It's not going to be in a big enough bubble if that's what you have to look for.
3239.04s: If it's all people are talking about all the time, that's when it's in a bubble.
3244.72s: So I can't even think of an example right now. Is there one we're talking about?
3253.28s: I mean I think that example there was perfect. No but I'm saying if people are going to go look for
3258.96s: it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it turns up. It's a wonderful, wonderful thing. But literally it might
3265.44s: turn up on every three or four years. Yeah. I was going to say there's, there's definitely,
3270.56s: there's nothing that sticks out to me right now. That's at those kind of levels.
3276.00s: There probably is in the crypto world, but I don't know if crypto vull behaves in that way.
3280.16s: Crypto vull. Yeah. I was going to say the other thing that I will see sometimes that would probably
3285.76s: be good to discount is the the biotech names because you can see that going into specific events
3293.28s: for biotech, but typically it's for a reason. It's not. Okay, that's another really good example.
3302.32s: Options before earnings events are systematically overpriced. Why? Because we know the stock's
3309.92s: going to have a big jump. And there's a decent chance you're going to lose a ton of money. On the
3314.24s: other hand, on average, it's overpriced. Selling options right before earnings is a good trade.
3322.08s: Selling biotech options right before FDA announcements is the same thing.
3329.44s: Selling zero DTE's right before a big economic announcement. Again, there's an edge in there.
3338.00s: So selling it on Thursday night, sell the Friday options if there's a non-farm payroll release.
3344.48s: So Friday one. I think Thursday, but anyway, you sell there's a premium over those big announcements
3352.72s: always. And again, though, don't push this too far. Don't say, oh, I'm going to do it when
3359.28s: Michigan sentiment's being released or something. It's going to be one of the really big ones.
3363.52s: Like even GDP's a bit iffy. Right now, CPI and non-farm payroll have that premium. It's big enough.
3371.52s: So whenever there's an event and you don't know what the outcome's going to be, but you
3376.56s: know when the event is sold. Oh, and there's one of biotechs sold by a TETVOL. You know the
3387.04s: number of people who trade options on everything, but they're like, I won't touch biotech because that's
3391.60s: risky. What do you think selling VOT? Why do you think you make money selling VOT? Because it's risky.
3398.80s: Biotechs are more risky. Works through this to the logical conclusion. There is a
3404.56s: depth that distinct biotech bowl premium above and beyond what is with a normal stop. So
3413.76s: if you're going to sell VOT, so the stuff that makes you think it's a stupid thing to sell.
3419.44s: If following the biotech example, understanding that sometimes after, you know, they go through
3429.20s: their phase trial release or whatever, there can be 10 times moves, right? Whatever.
3436.08s: If you're thinking about sizing something like that, how do you size it so that you can make
3441.68s: something that makes sense for the portfolio? But then for those exceedingly five standard deviation
3448.48s: plus moves, when they do happen, it doesn't blow you out. Yeah, you have to do each individual one
3454.56s: small because you can get a 10-sick move, right? I can't remember the biggest loss I've ever had
3462.16s: on earnings thing like that, but it's absolutely enormous, right? Like 30% move when it was priced
3468.64s: then it like eight or something. You've really just, it's one of those things you can't just
3474.96s: nibble at. You can't just pick and choose each one because I've been doing that trade for
3480.08s: 15 years now. I really don't know any way of picking the ones that are more likely to blow through
3488.56s: them not. I will tell you that if implied bowl has gone up a lot before earnings,
3495.68s: it's usually a better sale than the ones where it hasn't gone up as much, but that effect isn't
3502.32s: enough to override the general idea of just selling everything. So you have to accept you're going
3509.44s: to get a 10-s-d loss. You can't expect to do that risk reward thing on one stock, right? You
3519.04s: have to do that over a whole bunch of stocks and say, on average if I do this on 100 stocks, I'm not
3525.28s: going to get a 10-s, the whole thing is not going to be 10-s-d. So on 100 stocks maybe your real risk is
3531.28s: too SD and then you size it based on that. So where you'll go wrong is if you do too few of them.
3539.60s: That's one of the things that makes that hard for people is they find it difficult to manage
3547.92s: that many things and that really is just a matter of practice because after you've been doing that
3554.32s: for a while you can easily put on 30 or 40 of these in 10 minutes, take them off in the open,
3560.56s: not a big deal. When you're starting that idea it is a big deal is beginning anything is.
3568.40s: So that's what you've got to do. That implementation hassle, that's important.
3575.84s: Don't buy wings because when you buy wings you're buying options that are even more overpriced
3581.92s: and wings very rarely help. It's very unlikely that the wings are going to be the saviors and you're
3590.24s: going to throw away a ton of money in all the cases that I'm not. If you insist on
3596.56s: tapping your losses due calendar spreads, sell the fronts and buy the backs. Don't buy one week or
3604.24s: two week because those have got big jump premium in them as well. Buy like the longest dated ones
3611.28s: that have any liquidity at all. So like two months. So, problem with that is if you blow through the
3618.48s: strikes, both of these things end up in the money. It's a pain in the ass to get out of that long
3624.24s: dated one because the front one will expire in the money. You'll get stock, no big deal. You're still
3630.08s: hedged and you're long gamer. If anything goes wrong, you're long. So that's a decent position
3637.52s: but you're going to be holding that until expiration because you're not going to be able to get
3640.48s: out of a deep in the money option. They're going to have a really wide bid ask spread. So it does tie
3646.32s: up quite a bit of money if you, if that happens. Yeah. But yeah, it does a little way to hedge that.
3654.96s: So I don't know how how many more direct pieces of information you could give people before
3663.52s: they're happy but I feel like trade is a never happy. That's okay. I'm not going to try and
3672.24s: make trade as happy. I just want them to be unhappy with me in specific ways. So the best
3678.48s: looking hopeful. Well fair enough and honestly thank you a lot for doing this. I know again a lot
3686.00s: of this stuff is very elementary for you but one of the big projects that I'm working on is trying
3690.88s: to serve is a little bit of like a middle ground, right? Like trying to pull information from
3696.16s: you at a level that newer traders can operationalize. And generally like I genuinely think you
3701.84s: didn't insanely awesome job on this one which leads me to kind of a fun follow on project at some
3708.24s: point that I want to do with you is actually more at like the intermediate to advanced level
3712.80s: so that there's an opportunity to talk about slightly more complex things for folks. But first
3719.04s: I just want to thank you for for doing this and hanging out and sharing some of your information.
3724.80s: Yeah, I actually think you're going on the wrong direction there. I think the underserved
3731.84s: the underserved part of this educational process is telling beginners stuff that's actually true
3741.20s: and does have edge in a way that doesn't have all the heavy math behind it. The extra stuff.
3749.60s: Because you can trade vol without knowing about black shows. You don't need to know about
3754.08s: Greeks. You can get most of it from payoff diagrams. So I think that's the
3762.24s: I think that's the underserved part of the market. Something legit, something serious but also something
3771.12s: it can't be condescending but it also has to be true. So my example is Guy Fieri.
3778.56s: Okay, Guy Fieri is legit chef. No's what he's doing but he also does this thing,
3785.36s: you know his steak is he goes round diners and you know talks to his genuine all-round people
3790.48s: and he just enjoys it. He just talks about food with people at that level. So that's the thing
3795.92s: I think finances missing is something true legit not condescending but also kind of entertaining.
3805.68s: I love that. That gives me some homework. I have a couple of ideas actually that pop up immediately for that
3811.68s: but yeah, thank you. I love that. I think that's awesome.
3814.32s: I think you're here. I have a 1968 camera.
3819.44s: If I bleach my hair too much. Well, I don't know. My hair gets pretty blonde in the summer so I might be
3827.04s: all right. You just need the 68 camera convertible and you're good.
3830.32s: GT500 will probably be the muscle car rebuild. 6A camera sec but I heard I like old
3844.80s: muskings. I'll never get one right? But I do like them. I've heard the 350's better because they've heard
3849.60s: the 500 is really front heavy and basically just a drag car. You mean for the new ones?
3855.44s: Oh, you're talking about a new one. I'm talking about one of the old ones. Like yeah, I was talking
3858.72s: about the old ones. Okay, got it. Yeah. Because I know that the boss 429 is no one nearer's good
3864.00s: a car so the 302. But I think that's true of the shell visas. Well, but it was in gone in 60 seconds.
3874.32s: I can't like. Yeah. And so many nice cars have been ruined by trying to make a
3880.88s: ripple car of that thing. I know. Yeah. Well, such as life. All right, you and um, for folks they
3890.80s: can. Well, you're not really on X anymore. Are you? Or you know, I mean, I've still have an account.
3898.48s: Okay. Guy who hacked to my account is possible for me to delete my account.
3904.72s: But the only reason he hacked it was to do crypto scamming. Yeah, nice.
3909.84s: If I don't post anything nothing happens. So my account is just dormant. Got it. So if folks
3917.28s: did want to find your work, they can find your books and stuff off of Amazon, but anywhere else that
3921.76s: you want to direct into? I don't really have anything going on right now. Um, are you still writing
3927.04s: for a whole? Yeah. I've got a blog on the whole technical. So if you just write do whole
3933.60s: technical blog, little point you know, the right thing. Um, I think technically I'm on LinkedIn,
3940.24s: but I'm not allowed to post there. I've just allowed to forward stuff from whole technical.
3945.28s: Fair enough. Well, nobody should go on LinkedIn anyways. That's, that's a sad place. So avoid
3950.72s: LinkedIn at all. I mean, like I said, feel free to give people that. The least is if you feel like it.
3962.16s: Yeah. I would be more than happy to. I purposely have an honestly just out of respect. Like I
3966.32s: wouldn't shuffle your work around, but yeah, I'm more than happy to share that now. Because I
3971.76s: really do think it's it's good. It's really good. It was just vanity project. I didn't
3977.76s: never expect it to get to be sold or anything. So yeah, shit, send it around. Got it. We'll do.
3983.68s: Well, thank you for, for letting me share that and thank you for making that for folks. I think it's
3987.44s: awesome. And it's always, thank you for your time. And I'm sure we will sync up again in the near future.
3992.48s: Yeah, you too. Be guys.
