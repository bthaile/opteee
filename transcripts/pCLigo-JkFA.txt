712.00s: I
714.00s: I
716.00s: I
718.00s: Okay.
720.44s: I think that's it from like a performance perspective.
725.60s: If you guys have any questions, obviously, feel free to let me know.
728.48s: But the, yeah, the main stuff was, I was looking through my notes and trading activity did
734.20s: tick up a little bit.
735.44s: So total number of transactions did grow a little bit.
738.80s: It doesn't really surprise me to be honest with you just because of the earnings season
742.88s: and stuff like that.
743.88s: And I'm also trading more index of all.
747.20s: But I mean, it's just kind of business as usual as you can tell.
749.84s: It's not like some crazy cool return, right?
754.88s: It's very, very inside.
757.52s: But I pride myself in the consistency of returns.
761.84s: And that's really what will probably take me through the rest of the year because honestly
768.16s: to be up 20% within the first two months, like that's pretty strong.
774.84s: And I think a big reason for that really came from this last earning cycle.
780.36s: And then this pop in volatility from the broader market conditions have led to volatility
785.72s: trading really recapturing a pretty meaningful part of the percent return of the portfolio
790.92s: in a relatively short term timeframe.
792.64s: Because normally it takes a little longer for me to see the returns to pipe up like
797.68s: they did.
799.16s: So that's really where things sit as of today.
805.04s: I know not really, not really anything to crazy or fun, but you know, gets the job done
816.72s: as opposed to how I look at it at least.
820.96s: So yeah, if you guys have any follow on questions, feel free to let me know.
826.92s: And then let me take a look at the last thing.
829.24s: Oh yeah, I realize one of these is mislabeled.
831.44s: This one says speculative coverage strangle, and that shouldn't be that.
835.44s: That should be speculative zero DT.
839.44s: And it's really speculative SPX more than anything because I've opened it, I've opened
844.84s: up that bucket a little bit.
847.16s: It's not just.
850.52s: It definitely not just zero DT's anymore.
852.12s: Actually, most of what I'm trading right now for index fall is not zero DT's.
856.00s: It still is zero DT's most days, but it's mostly a mix of a mix of things.
865.68s: So yeah, I think I think that about sums us up.
875.32s: Anything else that you guys want to hit on that?
878.56s: Tommy says you still positive deltas sort of, I mean, net long, but I have a whole lot
888.72s: of short satellite positions for sure.
892.52s: So yeah, it's kind of a little bit of a mix there, I would say.
899.76s: Yeah.
901.56s: So general yes, but not.
907.40s: Not total like it's not just sitting at long deltas.
910.80s: It's definitely a pretty healthy mix of things as things are right now.
916.52s: And really the big reason for that is because we can see a lot of opportunity right now
927.28s: as far as I'm concerned at least from trading things through these broad directional
936.44s: shifts because here's a common thing that'll happen during periods like this.
943.24s: We will see a lot of opportunities emerge that do not remain super strong.
951.44s: And a big reason for that is because the markets will have this like really, really ugly
956.68s: kind of crash down phase to it, but then they typically will recapture.
963.12s: So when that happens, we have to obviously wait and see when that eventually comes to
968.80s: fruition.
970.12s: But I think while it's happening like these kinds of moves, you can make a lot of money
977.52s: on these kinds of moves, which is exactly the idea for trading things.
981.96s: When I'm trading stuff from a short term trading perspective, and I think I've told you
986.36s: guys this before because at least to me, it's a fairly important note is that when things
995.86s: crash down like this, I am very, very interested in trying to participate as much as I possibly
1006.14s: can before things slow down too much.
1011.84s: And they will almost always, always, always slow down.
1017.24s: Now how quick that comes today, we actually got a little bit of a continuation note,
1022.64s: which I mean, I honestly think is fairly fortunate.
1026.04s: And a big reason for that obviously is from the Trump tariffs, which actually there was
1031.00s: a clip that I wanted to show you guys that reminds me, let me find it really fast.
1035.52s: What's green in my own?
1038.04s: I want to play this clip for you.
1040.04s: It was on the Trump tariffs.
1043.64s: Is this it?
1050.64s: This one.
1054.08s: So I got to turn the volume off and then I'll turn close captions on.
1064.88s: And it's only like a couple minutes so we'll watch this together real fast.
1095.88s: Or not.
1098.88s: Why did this completely freeze?
1101.88s: There it goes.
1124.88s: You
1155.88s: keeps freezing.
1172.88s: I don't know why.
1184.88s: You
1214.88s: keeps freezing.
1233.88s: Bro, what the hell?
1236.68s: Now my mouse is gone.
1238.48s: Alright, this thing is struggling hard.
1268.48s: So the main thing I thought that was really interesting about this was a lot of the impression
1291.28s: that it was almost like he's viewing the tariffs as kind of like a punitive function.
1298.64s: And then it rotates into trying to complete the domestication of work.
1308.08s: I don't know.
1309.08s: I just thought it was really interesting.
1310.08s: And the reason why I mentioned that point is because obviously the market also thought
1315.28s: that this is a little strange because it seemed like with the tariffs being delayed
1320.92s: a month, it seemed like there was going to be a path where the tariffs might be avoided.
1325.92s: But then now it seems like that's not so much the case.
1328.92s: So very, very interesting behavior across the board.
1332.92s: But I mean, it is what it is.
1334.92s: Now the interesting part about tariffs is that they do open the door to opportunities and trade opportunities
1342.92s: to be all over the place from trying to trade index movements to finding individual names that are exhibiting strength,
1351.92s: which there are still a lot to trading earnings.
1354.92s: There's really so much to be done right now of note.
1358.92s: However, if we take a look at Nvidia, that's pretty ugly.
1364.92s: Like this does not necessarily look really solid for Nvidia.
1371.92s: And this is now starting to challenge even these lows.
1377.92s: So if this continues to post lows in this way, that's fairly catastrophic for what Nvidia has been able to accomplish over the last several months.
1390.92s: But if you take a look, we've essentially undone six months.
1395.92s: Right? Like this is where we opened six months ago and we just closed below it.
1399.92s: So Nvidia is very, very much trending sideways here on a longer term timeframe.
1406.92s: We can still obviously see tons of upside and lots of growth.
1412.92s: But even if we go back almost a year ago, we've given up most of what we've created essentially since the end of April.
1421.92s: So the general movement that we're seeing in tech is going to continue to drive the short term sentiment.
1433.92s: But now the other cool part about this though is that I still overwhelmingly think the market is very well positioned, especially with AI.
1442.92s: So that's why even when the market does start to look as ugly as it does right now, I just see such a massive catalyst sitting in front of us through something like AI that I think this all of this will effectively be not like a minor blip in the radar.
1462.92s: That's kind of selling it short to be honest, but this doesn't make me nervous as okay, we might be entering like a significant bear market or something like that, although we are getting very, very close and hovering right around a correction.
1476.92s: So that's probably not that far off the table and a lot of that will come through simply because of the the tear of stuff.
1485.92s: I don't necessarily think it's a change in underlying business conditions outside of that.
1489.92s: There's a lot of those external factors right now.
1492.92s: So very interesting market behavior. Now I want to run a couple of scans really fast.
1498.92s: And then if you guys have anything you want to look at now is a perfect time to start throwing it in because I got like another 10 minutes or so.
1505.92s: And then I got a bounce. So let's take a look at a few scans together because there are still things showing fairly persistent strength that are worth.
1518.92s: And then I'm going to be talking about.
1523.92s: Let's do the gap up on the day. And then I need to change this.
1528.92s: Yo, what in the world?
1531.92s: I've really got to figure out why something has changed with OBS that it's like completely locking up my browser for some reason.
1540.92s: And it just normally does not do that.
1543.92s: OBS was just updated every once in a while. It does that. It gets real weird for a while.
1548.92s: Let's get total.
1550.92s: We want at least five hundred.
1554.92s: Last price at least two dollars.
1558.92s: Realize you're just duplicated open interest because I'm a silly goose.
1564.92s: All right, let's see.
1566.92s: So these are things that are gapping up on the day.
1569.92s: And you can see that there are some how we looked at this one a few times now. I've already flagged this one to you guys.
1577.92s: This.
1579.92s: This has been flying off the damn shelf.
1584.92s: Even today it had a it's still had a big nasty red day, but it's still gapped up.
1592.92s: There there's still a lot of strength. It's just pocketed. It's not as widespread as I think people might be used to seeing.
1605.92s: And the fact that there are still pockets of strength that still shows us that this is not like a a total market rollover.
1612.92s: This is obviously a broad market pullback, but how far it shapes and materializes.
1620.92s: I think we'll have a lot to do with a couple things. One of them.
1625.92s: Absolutely will be the war in Ukraine and Russia. How that comes to pass and how impactful that that can be.
1633.92s: And that is actually something to be really thoughtful about by the way.
1639.92s: Because that that meeting between Zalensky and Trump was very interesting. That's not it's really not the way I expected that to go.
1649.92s: I don't think it's the way most people expected it to go.
1652.92s: But it didn't surprise me that it didn't go that well.
1659.92s: And for those that don't know the president's a Lensky, he did a podcast with Lex Friedman.
1668.92s: That was pretty good. Lex Friedman. I have a lot of respect for him.
1672.92s: His podcast can be a little difficult to listen to. Maybe it's just because I'm not smart enough or I just think he's like very monotone.
1682.92s: So anyways, my personal opinion is that nobody asked for a side.
1686.92s: The reason why I offer that personal opinion here, by the way, is because if you feel that same way, it's still worth listening to.
1693.92s: And anyways, one of the things that came out of that podcast listening with Zalensky and Lex Friedman was that there is a lot of pent up aggression and issue, right.
1706.92s: So with Ukraine and Russia, the problem with that though is that if the way to close this war out is through an agreement, it's very difficult to do that.
1721.92s: If one side is really disenfranchised with the other side, that becomes very, very difficult to manage.
1731.92s: And that's actually one of the things that Lex Friedman pointed out while on the podcast with Zalensky.
1738.92s: And I can totally respect and understand Zalensky's perspective, but he's in a very precarious spot because Ukraine without external support is in a real, real precarious place.
1750.92s: So the reason why I'm getting into all that one, obviously it's a personal interest of mine, just global security and stuff from a military mindset.
1758.92s: But beyond that, if that war starts to meaningfully escalate, which is not off the table, I still generally view that is less likely than more likely, but it's not off the table.
1771.92s: If that does escalate, that's the kind of condition that can send the market reeling downside.
1777.92s: And that's something I'm paying very close attention to because that is the exact kind of condition where my entire investment strategy would literally flip overnight if that happens.
1788.92s: So I'm waiting to see the way it goes.
1791.92s: Again, the way to think about markets as a trader is that we never know what's going to happen, but we have to have an idea of what we would do in different scenarios based on the broader context of what the world is doing.
1802.92s: And so that we're not caught off guard because I can tell you exactly what would happen to the majority of retail traders who are kind of passively involved.
1811.92s: If that war escalated, they do not have a playbook ready on what they would do.
1816.92s: And it would take them a couple days to get their feet under them to figure out what to do with the portfolio as it sits to try to find new opportunities. And by that point, you are late to the dance.
1826.92s: So anyways, all of that is an encouragement for you to prepare yourself.
1834.92s: And again, we're not I'm not preparing myself for something that I view as super high probability, but it is something I view as higher severity, which means it's something that deserves my respect.
1844.92s: Now that stuff aside, that's one thing that can really change this broader market picture. The other thing, the good part with the tariffs is that I think a lot of what we're seeing in the short term is absolutely.
1860.92s: Absolutely sentiment driven meaning most most large banks have already priced in most of this meaning the tariffs because these aren't things that popped up overnight.
1874.92s: These are things that have been on the docket for the last month. And then if you paid attention during Trump's cabinet meeting, he talked a little bit about these and there was no talk about delaying them again, kicking them down the line.
1888.92s: So I think most institutions had a sense of what's going on. And guess what? As per usual, the fucking options market tells you what's going on.
1900.92s: And I didn't post about this because I was playing it myself. And we have seen rapid build out in VIX options over the last four days.
1914.92s: And there's a couple really large trades that have come in and I'll show you.
1922.92s: As per usual, the market knows what's up.
1930.92s: So if we take a look at VIX and if we take a look at the delicious clear out, let's take a look at very, very clear pricing.
1943.92s: And let's take a look first at the last seven days.
1950.92s: Take a look at the total premium that you're seeing across these long calls. And most importantly, pay attention to where what contract where they are.
1967.92s: And then if you take a look for a prior reference range, if my computer would not freeze, we go to another reference range just for an example.
1980.92s: We'll go not to November. We'll just go like somewhere in here.
1987.92s: Notice the difference.
1990.92s: I just picked a random time. So what I'm showing you is that if you develop a relationship with things, especially things like VIX, it is wildly telling, wildly telling.
2006.92s: And you can see the build out occur near real time.
2011.92s: You take a look at the total amount of premiums that have been purchased for relatively short dated calls.
2019.92s: You have the majority of these are 43 days, a couple of 14s, but the overwhelming majority of these million dollar plus trades are 43 days out.
2030.92s: That does not happen normally. And again, I just gave you a prior reference range just to give you something to compare it against. And again, it was a random range.
2039.92s: I'm cherry picking because I can clearly tell some shit's going on. And this build out started again, like four or five days ago, you see it start on the 25th, 27th, and you can see it repeatedly getting hit.
2054.92s: So the market provides for usual. So the trade here is really interesting because VIX obviously looks strong. But if you take a look at UVX Y, this is where my trade was.
2070.92s: And it is for the leverage, the leverage we come in here for leverage. It's always likely to fall apart. And the cool part about trading a leveraged position is there's a higher probability of losing your trade.
2089.92s: But you can lose less money because you don't have to put on as big of a position to get the same exposure. That's why I like something like UVX Y for this exact kind of idea, which is a very short term idea.
2102.92s: And then the fun part about trading volatility is guess what? I'm going to play it to the downside as well, typically not as profitable to be completely honest with you.
2112.92s: Playing VIX spikes to the upside is always dangerous because if it takes too long, the market essentially will penalize you through theta decay.
2122.92s: But trying to play the reversion is more challenging because everybody in their mother know it's we know it's going to revert. Whereas when the spike is going to happen, we don't know what it's going to happen.
2133.92s: So it's a little more easy. If you get your move to make money to the upside to the downside, it's a higher probability of making the money, but you typically make less money. So that's the road map.
2148.92s: Pretty easy stuff. As far as I'm concerned, now let's go back to the scan really quick. And I realize it's already 530 so I got to hop off in a minute. But let me see what you guys have if there's anything that we want to hit.
2161.92s: Zach says today was rough did not see the sell off coming so much for me thinking we had bottom too much thinking with my heart probably.
2168.92s: Yeah, well, and I mean the other thing is like we you just never know right like going into the market with an expectation of oh, like did we bottom here? It's okay, but also like what does that do for us?
2183.92s: It's the role of a trader is always Bayesian analysis. That means we come up with the best possible mental model that we can until new information emerges and then we update the mental model.
2197.92s: So to your point, I think just about all of us thought a similar thing to be completely honest, right? Like if we take a look at what the market did on Friday, if you look across everything here on Friday, just about everything.
2212.92s: So that is the start of something now I think it's way too premature to think whether or not we bottomed or not there to be honest just because it's one day you really can't come up with the conclusion in one day, but with the start that we had to the market today, it looked probably.
2232.92s: But then the tariffs came so when we have new information injects like that it's always going to be real challenging.
2242.92s: And that's why it's so important to remain as flexible as humanly possible as a trader it's literally our job.
2249.92s: We have to be able to pivot rapidly because the markets move around a lot. So yeah, I think to your broader point though, avoid at all costs making trading decisions with emotions or you know,
2261.92s: obviously your your your term there was the heart. We want to avoid that we want to use solid analysis that's based based on data.
2272.92s: And you can get a lot of really great data points from the market. I mean, take a look at this healthcare had a great day today utilities great day today real estate taking up today staples taking up today.
2286.92s: So again, like the market as an entire entity is not dying off right now, but tech is and as we know tech even with the S&P 500 is over 30% of the S&P 500 is huge.
2301.92s: So the S&P 500 is going to move by the way of tech.
2305.92s: Let's show.
2309.92s: Let's see Zach says what would your strategy be if that happens put options I think you're referring to when I was talking about if the war kicks up.
2318.92s: It depends entirely on the context, but essentially what would end up happening in broad muscle movements would be coverage strangles would get paired down to minimal viable products.
2330.92s: So what that means is for the coverage strangle I very rarely come flat to cash. But I get very close to cash now in something like T triple cues I do go flat to cash because it's three times levered and it's more of a speculative hybrid coverage triangle.
2346.92s: I still consider it core. It's all bucketed together, but it's it is speculative in nature because it's three times leverage.
2352.92s: So that's one of the first playbook items the other thing is things that benefit from war obviously start to get put on with leverage.
2363.92s: So for example, the balance here position I have on I would expect that to do well I would expect the other defense contractors to do really well.
2370.92s: I would also expect fixed income to do better debt instruments I would expect to see.
2377.92s: A pair relationships get distorted that I would then play the normalization of those and then for broad directional movements it's straight to futures.
2391.92s: Yeah anything like that straight to futures.
2398.92s: A birder says can you look at AVGO it is earnings this week and it looks like it'll do well, but I think the movement will be drowned out by the broader market movements we're seeing like in video.
2408.92s: Well in videos earnings is a little bit of a different story to be honest if you're paralleling it to that.
2416.92s: So I think it's a trail down into their earnings I think does them a favor it makes it easier to see some sort of up move.
2429.92s: Let's take a look this six. Let's get rid of this.
2438.92s: This chain looks generally built to the call side let's see.
2443.92s: Yeah 58 against 42 so not massive.
2455.92s: I mean it's for me to it's hard to say I think it's real hard to say I don't see a clear positioning with respect to the options chain though.
2464.92s: We can look across and see if anybody has been building into anything in there.
2470.92s: And then what direction they might be building into.
2480.92s: Just making sure the filters are correct.
2483.92s: Let's see.
2490.92s: You can put 280 put I mean it looks like a lot of put activity to be on.
2501.92s: Yeah it looks like a lot of put activity but this is really normal the reason why you'll see this is because.
2513.92s: People will hedge bigger stocks like this into the earnings release.
2520.92s: Let's take a look let's take a look over the last three days yeah I mean it's mostly put premium that's coming in super heavy.
2527.92s: Last seven days.
2531.92s: Yeah I mean it's mostly put premium that I see.
2544.92s: And this rose again.
2548.92s: Yeah and then yeah you can see the volume stacking over the last.
2558.92s: I don't need 15 minutes so excessive honestly if I could just look at this in terms of a day that would be fine.
2566.92s: Yeah I mean I don't personally have some sort of baked opinion on how it'll do during earnings I don't see anything super conclusive though.
2577.92s: Just eyeballing things.
2582.92s: Had a really good last earnings.
2586.92s: For earnings good earnings poor earnings poor earnings poor earnings poor earnings good earnings.
2596.92s: Kind of like a mixed bag.
2602.92s: It does look like it's recent earnings trend looks a little bit stronger so yeah I don't I don't really think.
2613.92s: I don't really think anything strong directional wise for me at least just because of the options position doesn't mean that I can't move really strong.
2621.92s: It looks like it's well positioned and I would favor it more strongly just because of this last earnings release.
2629.92s: But beyond that it would just be like that that's just a straight guess.
2636.92s: And then if we look year over year.
2640.92s: Like I had a really big beat here.
2644.92s: But then it still slid off.
2648.92s: So really interesting earnings history very strange.
2653.92s: Yeah kind of like mixed bag for me.
2661.92s: Anything else that we should look at.
2666.92s: You guys good otherwise I mostly just want to make sure everybody's not getting like crushed out there getting super disenfranchised and things like that.
2673.92s: I think there's a lot to do.
2676.92s: I think you can be pretty active right now.
2680.92s: I think general general thoughts though.
2684.92s: Would be to pay pretty close attention to total risk that's out.
2691.92s: And the market with the start of the year that it's having.
2697.92s: Is anything wrong with being slightly underutilized right now in kind of playing things more so by year.
2705.92s: I actually think that that's probably a smarter play because if the market is going to have some sort of blow out smash move to the upside.
2713.92s: With the down move that we've seen so far like you'll literally see it.
2717.92s: You'll see it happening.
2719.92s: You'll see the total tone and tenor change.
2723.92s: And you will see people's general perception about the external environment changing just in terms of tonality.
2730.92s: And you'll obviously see it through price and volume.
2734.92s: So that's one of the reasons why I mean even in the coverage strangles that I have on right now they're super light.
2741.92s: I mean they're all 20% equity or less which is about as late as you can go I think most of them are 50% utilize or less.
2749.92s: Let me see.
2753.92s: The teacher accused coverage strangle is 63% ssso's 59% I bits 52.
2759.92s: So.
2763.92s: I mean most of that is in short puts 22% for ssso of that 59 is shares 17% of teacher book uses shares the rest isn't cash secured puts actually offered more puts today and it's to take advantage of the down move and I will almost assuredly have to roll these but that's OK.
2787.92s: The volatility is there so just keep that in mind is your monitoring the market getting into like really big positions right now.
2797.92s: If you have a really long term horizon it can look very good I'll go back and say again for the record like for Nvidia I love Nvidia all in here but that's for a much longer term idea.
2810.92s: I think if you're trying to trading shorter term it doesn't it literally is crazy as it is to say doesn't make sense right now but if you're trying to build a longer term coverage strangle long equity position I mean you're probably not going to get a ton of good looks at Nvidia like this over the next five years it's just going to be growing way too fast based on the involvement in AI and whatnot.
2837.92s: Now that is another key theme to keep in mind though the AI the AI theme is really really dangerous because if things work well then AI has an unbelievable amount of potential if there starts to if we if we start to see impediments and stuff like that you just cannot absolutely cannot
2866.92s: rationalize the long term exposure in it and it's just because that's such a key market factor right now and if that starts to fall off then the broad market really starts to look way more tenuous to me so it's very very much predicated on that so some closing thoughts for you guys as always if you need anything hit me up in the discord being outlier see all that
2896.92s: you
