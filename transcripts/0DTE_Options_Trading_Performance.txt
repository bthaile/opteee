0.20s: what's up gang today we're talking about
2.84s: Zer DTE SPX options trading specifically
7.44s: in 2023 because this year's been kind of
10.52s: interesting I'll be honest with you I
12.16s: take a look at data pretty much every
14.00s: day with regards to trading and there
15.72s: are some anomalies this year that I
18.64s: picked up on and I actually pivoted what
21.36s: I was doing midy year because of that so
24.12s: the goal of this video is to walk
25.32s: through two things the first thing is
26.84s: kind of what happened with the trading
28.84s: side of stuff and the second part is to
31.20s: walk you through a little bit of this
33.08s: concept of being able to Pivot this is
35.32s: one of the reasons why a lot of traders
37.36s: in my opinion fail that become too
40.48s: systematic because you try to execute
42.92s: the same exact way every single time
44.88s: without fail and sometimes markets
47.84s: change what we did before might not work
51.16s: now and that's the point what's up
52.92s: everybody Eric here welcome back to the
54.40s: outliers shout out to the patreon family
56.40s: you guys make content like this possible
58.44s: for everybody else so if what I do helps
60.24s: you in any way consider signing up all
63.00s: right so let's start with what didn't
65.84s: work what I'm showing you here is a back
69.28s: test from my friends over at options
71.32s: Omega I am affiliated with them this
73.36s: isn't a promoted video by them this is
75.08s: just me using the platform because I
77.04s: think it's usable for you you folks so
79.40s: the details to signing up for them for
82.00s: 50% off are in the notes below for those
84.48s: interested but this is an easy way to
86.36s: summarize a lot of information this is
87.88s: going to be a mix of their information
89.52s: and then my own trade data that I track
92.08s: so here I was looking at 2015 and I was
95.52s: using two days to expiration because
98.00s: daily expirations weren't launched then
100.16s: and I was looking at 50 Delta short
103.20s: straddles worked which is really to
105.44s: capture variance risk premiums for those
107.60s: that are unaware a short straddle simply
110.28s: looks like this it's a short option both
113.88s: call and put that share the same strike
116.52s: price typically trying to get right out
117.96s: of 50 Delta and the whole premise of
120.24s: this trade is to capture variance risk
122.64s: premiums which I have a standalone video
125.24s: that walks through what those are in
127.08s: detail a link to them in the notes below
128.96s: but in the meantime for a quick refresh
131.00s: variance risk premiums is simply the
133.48s: tendency for implied volatility which is
135.84s: the yellow lines in this graph down here
137.68s: that I'm highlighting tends to Trend
139.92s: over realized volatility which are the
142.28s: white lines that you see here and you
143.96s: can see in general the yellow line is
146.48s: above the white line that's variance
148.48s: risk premiums and it's a sort of
151.20s: systematic Alpha it's actually one of
153.04s: the best possible things retail Traders
154.68s: can expose themselves to because it is
157.56s: really persistent okay so that is the
160.48s: short stradle why the short stradle
162.48s: because this is kind of a more pure play
165.08s: on variance risk premiums compared to
167.48s: something like this now this is looking
169.48s: at the same time frame but looking at a
171.72s: 20 Delta 2 days to expiration short
174.84s: strangle and this is from the same exact
176.96s: time frame the idea here is if you look
179.28s: at the p pnl for these two different
180.88s: positions the short straddle performed
183.32s: much better it came out like $700 ahead
186.08s: I was just using essentially one lot for
188.84s: each of these trades but you can see
191.12s: that in general the stradle performed
193.56s: better and this was back in 2015 so to
196.52s: give you some context let's take a look
198.36s: at the chart over here this is when 2015
200.84s: kicked off notice how relative to what
204.24s: we're seeing now kind of flat there's
206.56s: really not a whole lot going on here
208.48s: until towards the end the year which we
210.52s: did start to see some volatility it's
212.12s: actually why these strategies didn't do
213.92s: super great because of this period here
216.28s: but in general the daily movements were
219.40s: not that big and that's an important
221.28s: detail especially if you look at that
223.28s: compared to what we see now the daily
225.76s: movements are much larger in general
228.88s: just for reference this is using a
230.84s: weekly aggregation but still you can see
233.24s: that they are much larger in scale so
236.00s: why does all of this matter well what
237.76s: didn't work is what did work for a long
240.56s: time I'm sorry I'm confused which is
242.80s: just selling the short straddles so now
245.20s: I want to walk you through what did
247.64s: actually work and then most importantly
249.96s: how I actually did trading what I do
253.76s: because there is a slight difference
255.28s: between the data you're about to see and
257.04s: what I did so this is looking at one
259.52s: Lots looking at this year only 2023 and
263.16s: it's looking at 1 January to 10 November
265.92s: and you'll see there's a bunch of
267.04s: different permutations up here the way
268.84s: you can think about this is that the
270.60s: different columns are different
272.64s: combinations of the strategies we have
275.52s: the Deltas so this is looking at a 15
278.04s: Delta 20 Delta 30 Delta 50 Delta for
280.84s: calls and puts so this entire study is
283.52s: looking at straddles or strangles
286.00s: straddles are the 50 Delta anything
287.80s: other than that are strangles now these
290.32s: two rows here Max profit Max loss this
293.00s: is showing if there's any max profit
296.28s: management applied or Max Loss
297.88s: Management so kind of for these first
300.12s: four columns notice how there's no Max
302.76s: profit no Max loss management and then
305.28s: at the next sets of columns I start to
307.64s: introduce Max loss management and that's
309.56s: because I talked about this a little bit
311.24s: earlier in the year but I already
312.84s: started to catch wind that things were
314.80s: changing so I was testing different
316.72s: things now this is essentially how it
320.04s: all played out what worked the best from
322.96s: a back testing perspective was 20 Delta
326.40s: short call short put so a short strangle
328.92s: managed at a 300% Max loss there's a
332.44s: really really really interesting piece
335.08s: that comes with this notice how if we
337.32s: look at something like the 20 Delta
340.04s: strangle with no Loss Management there's
343.52s: 154 winning positions now if we apply a
346.92s: 250% loss management there's now 149 if
350.88s: we look at a 300% Loss Management 152
353.96s: and then 153 winning trades the reason
356.88s: why this matters is because we do do not
359.88s: want to get stopped out prematurely
362.36s: which is what happened in this 250%
364.88s: scenario this means that there were
366.64s: trades that went outside of our loss
368.84s: management band that actually came back
371.28s: in now fortunately it's actually not
374.12s: that big of a difference and that's why
375.80s: this worked so well this year notice how
379.52s: the Max winners if no no management was
381.84s: applied was 154 so what this means is is
384.28s: that there's only five trades that you
386.48s: artificially cut out and in this case
388.84s: there's only only two trades notice
391.60s: though the change in the max loss this
394.88s: is why it all comes together because the
396.96s: max loss in this trade went from
400.12s: 5,623 bucks and it dropped down to 3360
404.64s: big change in Max loss this is the exact
408.24s: thing that I'm talking about when I'm
409.68s: saying cut off the tails because if we
413.60s: take a look at a bell curve imagine that
416.00s: each individual trade here is a DOT and
418.52s: this represents the distribution of
420.68s: those dots what we're doing by cutting
422.84s: off the tails is we are managing this
426.44s: loss we're taking away these really
429.32s: large losing trades and it drastically
432.64s: increases our win potential which is
435.64s: exactly the point here so what did I
437.76s: actually do here it is from the middle
440.60s: of the year is about 22 May is when I
442.84s: made this pivot and I ran this I
445.68s: typically run this strategy almost
447.64s: always so in this case case I ran 20
451.00s: Delta short strangles managed at a 300%
455.20s: Max loss now instead of a one lot I
457.92s: typically trade five Lots so that's why
460.16s: you'll see these numbers look quite
461.64s: different however the things I want to
463.16s: hone in on is the total number of Trades
465.16s: I had was 121 with 89 winning trades so
469.24s: I did still have some pretty serious
472.48s: large losses that occurred relatively
475.40s: infrequently but still enough that it
477.48s: hurts the profitability of the position
479.48s: so I did take a look at this study to
482.48s: see okay well if I'm doing this 20 Delta
484.60s: strangle what if I either decrease or
487.84s: increase the max loss potential and this
490.24s: is actually still The Sweet Spot it's
492.16s: just a function of trading this kind of
493.88s: thing so I actually walked out up about
495.88s: $6,000 so far on the year so as long as
498.16s: I don't throw it all away it's a pretty
499.88s: good year the main thing I want you guys
501.40s: to take away from this is you might have
503.44s: your typical way of deploying which is
505.20s: great however you have to stay sensitive
507.88s: to the current market conditions because
509.56s: what worked before doesn't always
511.20s: continue to work in the future and it's
512.84s: a continual system of optimization
515.08s: that's all based on what a good trading
525.32s: log it's
528.36s: beautiful if you are tracking all of
530.68s: this detail you can come across like I
533.28s: did earlier in the year when something
535.64s: didn't look right compared to what it
537.52s: looked like when it was working and I
539.00s: knew it was time to try something else
540.96s: if you have any questions comments
542.08s: concerns as always drop me a line throw
544.32s: it in the comments below be an outlier
546.60s: I'll see you guys later
