0.76s: what's up outliers quick market update I
2.60s: got three things on the agenda the first
4.52s: one is what you see on the screen we're
5.84s: going to talk a little bit about
6.80s: September 11th because your boy's a
8.80s: patriot and it's important to continue
10.84s: that message the second thing I want to
12.40s: talk about quickly is actually looking
14.64s: at the broad market and specifically
16.76s: Tech Nvidia there's some interesting
19.64s: activity going on there and then the
21.04s: third thing for today is actually going
22.28s: to be chewy and I want to discuss a few
25.88s: things I'm seeing in there specifically
28.36s: so kind of a broad Market update today
30.56s: with a few bubble points um let's Dive
33.04s: Right In so for those that don't know
34.40s: today is September 11th and I think it's
36.72s: important to at least talk about it very
39.04s: quickly you can check out this really
40.76s: really really good video from National
43.52s: Geographic this is kind of just about
45.76s: the attacks from the American
47.88s: perspective so there's not a lot about
50.16s: war fighting and stuff in here which
51.76s: honestly is what I'm more interested in
53.40s: there's a couple other documentaries I
54.80s: think are better for that but the thing
57.60s: that I think is important to highl about
60.44s: this is I feel like most of us in this
62.16s: Western World consider us civilized and
65.08s: you know we're really really comfortable
66.64s: here comparatively I know for Americans
69.00s: that haven't traveled a lot that's kind
70.60s: of hard to see we can always find things
72.52s: to and complain about but if you
75.08s: look across a lot of the world it's it's
77.04s: very little compared to most other
78.96s: places so we live in a pretty cool spot
81.72s: and I think this is an important
83.36s: reminder that even though we live in a
85.08s: cool spot it can be disrupted and this
87.08s: is a reminder of how cool of a spot it
89.24s: is that something like this is still so
91.84s: prolific and it's something that's
93.28s: happened over almost a decade and a half
95.80s: ago right we don't get that much heat
98.72s: here and it's very fortunate because of
100.76s: our geographic location our neighbors
102.76s: all that kind of stuff so this not
104.32s: getting into politics anything like that
105.64s: couldn't care less the main thing is
107.56s: just to be thankful for where we are to
110.28s: be reminded that a lot of the world is
112.60s: not quite as fortunate and as I try to
115.28s: remind people is that although we play
117.12s: the game civilized we are all quite
119.20s: literally still animals violence is a
122.00s: part of human nature it's not changed
124.24s: since our existence I don't see it
125.88s: changing anytime soon so this is exactly
128.60s: why we say things like be hard to kill
131.04s: just remember people can suck as much as
133.60s: we have these ideas about how good we
135.52s: want things to be how we would love
137.48s: there to be Flowers and Butterflies
139.48s: everywhere and everybody to love one
140.92s: another it's just unrealistic there's
143.04s: going to be different people that
143.96s: believe different things so you can like
146.40s: flowers and butterflies I think they're
147.84s: sick too but I also o think it's
150.40s: important for people to remember the
152.20s: overall scope of the world so big day
155.36s: this is a transformative day for me I
157.88s: remember it literally crystal clear I
159.44s: was still a kid at this time I was in
160.68s: elementary school and this is one of the
163.00s: reasons why my brother joined the Marine
164.52s: Corps why I joined the Marine Corps we
165.92s: saw this happen and we're like we're
167.32s: going to war let's let's do what's got
169.04s: to get done so that's that let's get on
171.84s: to the markets so djt funny enough I
175.16s: wasn't going to talk about it but fell
176.24s: off a cliff so this was interesting to
178.80s: see this has just been a vicious vicious
181.52s: downtrend um this isn't anything that I
183.60s: trade as you could tell I think it's a
185.24s: great trade to the downside although the
186.88s: downside is starting to look a little
188.40s: bit exhausted here because it's kind of
190.72s: like how far down can it go and it looks
193.96s: like it's almost at IPO levels yeah it's
196.20s: essentially all the way down near
197.92s: alltime lows so you might get another
199.28s: couple bucks down to like the 14 handle
201.60s: but not what I wanted to talk about
204.92s: let's dive in here this this is what I
209.08s: want to highlight
210.64s: take a look at this candle in Q's Q's
213.72s: right now is essentially what led to
216.92s: this massive rally in the S&P 500 and as
220.00s: per usual it comes down to a handful of
221.56s: names we saw volatility contract down
224.24s: now even below um 18 it's in the mid 17
229.04s: handle and the market is starting to
233.52s: catch a bite here but again I still view
236.04s: this as tenuous now I did add A's
238.48s: position today I have Nasdaq futures to
241.04s: complement my um S&P futures but it's
244.80s: very very tenuous I do not have a
246.60s: position still in iwm although as you
249.40s: all probably know I typically prefer to
251.76s: I just don't see it right now and it's
253.92s: because even though this does start look
256.00s: like it might be rallying it's just way
257.88s: too early and there's no there's no
260.44s: heroes in the market I have found that
263.08s: the game of trying to top tick or bottom
265.56s: tick or perfectly time reversals as a
269.20s: really I game I don't want to call it a
270.80s: Fool's errand because some people can do
273.88s: it really well I just find it to be an
276.76s: absolute minority of people that can and
279.36s: it's not me I'll tell you that I mtime
281.52s: it all the time and that's just how this
283.96s: game goes for me I have to adopt a
285.76s: different strategy to deal with my
288.44s: Litany of issues that being one of them
291.16s: so that part aside I do think when I
294.68s: look at cues that this starts to get
297.28s: interesting so let's take a closer look
299.72s: at
300.84s: QQQ and let's see how it's performing I
303.80s: want to come into a six-month because
306.08s: here's what I've highlighted before this
309.36s: is a really important level in my
311.52s: opinion and the reason why this level is
314.64s: very important to me is because once we
317.60s: start dropping below this handle we
320.24s: really collapse this higher low thesis
323.92s: again Lower low higher low higher low
329.20s: but there's a couple issues I see with
331.20s: this move the first one is look at the
332.88s: compression so if you look at the
334.72s: distance between this lower low and then
337.00s: this higher low that's a a fair period
340.48s: of time it's like four months almost so
344.88s: that move compared to what we're seeing
346.56s: now from here to here is about a month
348.24s: so this is more reminiscent of this move
351.24s: and that doesn't mean that it can't you
353.44s: know bounce around here for a little bit
354.84s: shoot up then come back down who knows
356.32s: where it goes It goes circles but what
358.56s: I'm really trying to highlight here is
360.20s: although I like the movement that I'm
362.20s: seeing in Tech right now I also
364.84s: understand that it still seems fairly
367.12s: tentatively moving in my opinion the
369.56s: moving averages are an absolute mess
372.16s: it's starting to look healthy again
373.88s: that's why I built a position today but
375.88s: it's something that I'm watching very
377.28s: carefully and the way that I play those
379.64s: kinds of positions is to be really
381.52s: aggressive because I'm not trying to
383.72s: bottom ticket right like I waited till
385.80s: today to start getting in but I also
389.20s: don't want this to roll right back over
392.48s: as it starts coming up into this handle
394.44s: which is really where near-term
395.96s: resistance is going to be kind of like
397.64s: first stop will be there is and if it
400.92s: gets up there and gets stuck up and
402.36s: starts shooting back down that's exit
404.52s: for me right away and then I would wait
406.92s: until some sort of ability to break
408.84s: above this if it hits it consolidates
410.72s: and then starts moving up great but I'm
413.32s: really sensitive to a down move off of
415.44s: that at this point because again you can
416.88s: see that this has happened this happens
419.08s: with stock all the time when they have
420.44s: these failed breakouts on consolidation
422.92s: that weekends this all goes back to the
424.80s: broader thesis the market right now is
426.88s: so freaking emotional and if you need
430.36s: proof of
431.36s: that look at
433.20s: Nvidia Nvidia got trounced got murdered
436.76s: here in the beginning of August then
439.88s: after earnings which were really good
441.84s: earnings it went from
444.56s: 128 down to 101 almost a low of 100 I
448.68s: think actually yeah a low of
450.60s: 195 a massive down move and now it's
454.20s: starting to Rally back out so to see
456.52s: these kind of movements based on solid
459.28s: earnings most of this is from a broader
461.96s: economic sense again in my opinion
464.00s: there's a lot of broad economic factors
465.76s: which we'll go into later during the
467.72s: YouTube live stream a little bit later
470.16s: today but that's what I see going on
472.72s: with Nvidia I mean it had a crack day it
475.76s: was up what eight points so I mean
479.64s: massive massive rally and the
482.68s: interesting thing I find about Nvidia
484.72s: here is that it is still consolidating
487.36s: well so what that means is I'm setting
489.56s: new alerts to kind of follow this move
491.56s: up and see how it performs but again low
494.88s: higher low higher low so even though
498.00s: it's h it's having these really nasty
499.88s: sell-offs which I don't love from a
501.44s: volatility perspective it's rallying out
504.40s: and it's not falling too deep so Tech is
508.24s: still alive
510.00s: here it just looks like it's um really
513.92s: really dependent on external factors at
515.80s: this point energy getting killed so I
519.08s: still have my Fades and energy um I'm
521.20s: plating individual stocks not XLE RIT
523.40s: large but that's playing out really
525.28s: really well and we can also see a couple
528.60s: interesting behaviors XLF caught a bite
530.68s: today that started selling off pretty
533.12s: hard and we're starting to see again
535.68s: rotation among the sectors so xlu still
539.12s: strong performing XLR still strong
541.08s: performing xlp stay still hanging in
543.68s: there and xlk obviously technology is
546.32s: really starting to Rally up out of here
548.56s: but this is not out of the woods in my
550.12s: opinion this is not bport Tech all right
553.60s: so the last thing I want to take a look
554.84s: at with you quickly is chewy and it's
556.80s: because people are obviously really
559.20s: excited and the timing for roaring Kitty
562.28s: post about you know chewy and you know
564.72s: dropping the toy is really funny and a
568.32s: lot of people are going back and forth
570.12s: as to whether he caught this move or not
572.12s: or whether he's already out based on
574.32s: that post we still haven't seen a
576.96s: refiled 13g which he would owe within 10
580.72s: days of when he made the transaction
584.88s: that would CA him to fall below 5% so
587.52s: let's say for example CU after I think
589.32s: he his percentage would have increased
591.00s: pretty meaningfully because of the
593.20s: corporate actions from chewy so that
595.68s: could put him at a higher percentage he
597.56s: could have sold some of it not hit the %
599.72s: threshold waited a little bit and who
601.40s: knows maybe he caught a little bit of
602.56s: the move today but based on our best
604.76s: guesses the date that he got into at
606.80s: least cross the 5% threshold was back
608.72s: here so again this is still not big
611.40s: bucks for him even if he top tick tick
613.32s: going from 26 to 30 it's a lot of money
615.60s: it's a ton of money but again like we've
617.64s: seen this dude go through a quarter
620.24s: billion dollar rally and just hold it so
623.44s: my guess is he's not trying to you know
625.36s: play this move as anything significant
627.48s: he is uh time traveler that's doing
630.28s: something else but I do think it's
633.20s: interesting because it's important to
634.80s: highlight the move that happened today
637.92s: so if you'll notice we saw that Petco
642.00s: wolf it had really good second quarter
645.88s: results so you can see that it missed
649.52s: its earnings Target expected uh what two
653.56s: cents but
655.88s: overall we saw growth within wolf
660.36s: and you can tell that the market really
662.24s: really really liked the report so this
665.68s: is again a really important comparison
667.96s: when we're looking at the performance of
670.56s: products and earnings releases sometimes
672.84s: we get too wrapped up in the idea of oh
675.48s: if it's a a earnings miss the Market's
678.16s: going to hate it and it's going to
679.04s: collapse not necessarily it all depends
680.84s: on the context so in this case again you
683.40s: can see that let's grab wolf really fast
689.96s: and you'll see it came in at -2
692.44s: cents it was expected at8 cents so
696.84s: really really big beat in terms of eps
699.72s: it fell a little bit short on some of
701.52s: its metrics but that earnings beat
703.92s: absolutely through Petco through the
705.92s: roof on today I mean it's a 32.9% move
710.44s: so chewy moved some of that in sympathy
712.92s: and again this is very common for stocks
715.00s: that share similar Industries around
716.76s: earnings because if you see Collective
718.64s: Strength then it typically means some of
720.96s: that strength will pass between other
722.60s: companies in the same industry so this
725.84s: is a really interesting movement today
728.16s: and I didn't go through all of the
729.36s: earnings yet I did see that there were
732.28s: some elements that were a little bit
734.52s: soft from the earnings but overall it
737.96s: looked like it did it did really really
740.20s: well you can see Capital expenditures
742.60s: 140 million so they're
744.08s: investing um adjusted EPS came in 34
748.16s: cents or this is looking um for Q3 so
751.96s: this is forward looking guance so yeah I
754.72s: mean overall it looks like the company
758.08s: is I mean this isn't something that I
760.08s: love this isn't something I typically
761.40s: would trade it's way too cheap of a
762.72s: stock but it looks like overall we can
765.48s: see that like for example net revenue
768.36s: came down half a percent year-over-year
769.80s: I know that that's we we normally really
772.40s: don't like that but there was enough
774.92s: other components that counteracted that
778.20s: and led to the market really liking the
779.80s: move and then the forward guidance so
782.48s: really really massive move in
784.72s: Petco so that wraps me up I'll see you
787.80s: on the live session later today at 500
789.48s: PM Pacific time being an outlier see you
791.16s: guys later
