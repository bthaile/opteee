2.64s: hey everybody what's up so i was
5.60s: fortunate enough to get brent on
8.80s: and um so he has a fascinating
11.76s: background but first off thank you for
14.08s: taking the time to you know hop on chat
15.84s: with me a little bit and share some of
16.96s: your experience sure good to see you and
19.12s: um there's definitely a good synergy
21.68s: between trading and people with military
24.40s: backgrounds in fact uh two of the best
26.32s: traders that so i've had i've been a
27.84s: manager a lot at various banks and two
30.32s: of the best traders that ever worked for
31.68s: me were both military backgrounds so
34.24s: not a coincidence yeah
36.24s: it's it makes sense to me in a lot of
37.92s: ways though just because of the
38.96s: discipline i think that that's such a
40.48s: big thing
41.60s: um which you know
43.20s: yeah i mean there's a couple of things
45.44s: that the discipline and then also i
47.44s: think
48.48s: the stakes don't feel as high like if
50.88s: you've been in the military and then you
52.24s: come to trading it's like yeah okay it's
54.16s: scary to you know whatever is going to
56.24s: happen
57.04s: to your p l but it's not comparable to
59.60s: real life you know military situations
63.12s: and needless to say and then also um
66.24s: maybe this is just more of like a quirk
68.08s: but generally people that come to wall
70.08s: street from the military are older and
72.40s: more mature
73.52s: so it's not like a 22 year old like
75.92s: quant who's you know never been out of
78.48s: their parents
80.00s: backyard in in their life you know like
81.92s: so they're generally military people
84.48s: that come to wall street are just more
87.68s: you know adult and i'm not saying that
89.60s: that i was because i was very immature
91.76s: when i came to wall street but um and so
94.16s: that was probably a weakness of mine but
95.52s: a lot of military people come
97.60s: you know as adults that are mature and
100.00s: and kind of ready to sit down and get to
101.92s: work so
103.36s: yeah it's an interesting observation
105.36s: because i i i do find that a lot just in
107.52s: terms of the scale
108.96s: of the perception of risk
111.76s: is really important because yeah i think
114.00s: a lot of retail traders focus a lot on
117.68s: if they're actually
119.52s: developed retail traders they focus on
121.20s: risk a lot but i think a lot of people
123.52s: forget the other side of that equation
125.52s: you know that reward is tied to risk and
127.44s: a lot of people become really
128.48s: risk-averse
129.84s: then you can't really make any money if
131.68s: you're too risk-averse and yeah that's
134.56s: interesting i don't know if you want to
135.84s: get started like go right into this or
137.44s: i'm like
138.48s: there's literally no format so whatever
140.64s: i don't know if i'm like hijacking your
142.00s: intro or whatever at all
143.68s: um but one interesting thing that i
146.00s: found so like i'm a very risk loving
147.92s: person like i took a lot of stupid risks
149.84s: as an adolescent and just like i've
151.84s: always been a risk-taking person and so
154.88s: that has generally for me been harnessed
156.80s: in trading by like rules and and systems
159.68s: and things like that right and so
162.48s: as a manager when i was like 30 or so i
165.20s: started managing people and i started
166.72s: managing more and more people and the
168.48s: biggest surprise or one of the biggest
169.92s: surprises to me was how risk-averse
172.40s: people actually are and i kind of
174.08s: thought oh everyone must be like me i'll
175.68s: just need these rules to like pull the
177.76s: reins back on everyone and actually most
180.16s: of the guys that i'm saying guys
182.40s: not all men work for me but mostly men
184.80s: and somewhere everybody uh but actually
186.80s: the women that work for me were more
188.08s: risk seeking so whatever that means um
190.88s: but
191.76s: a lot of the guys that worked for me i
193.04s: had to actually institute rules to force
195.36s: them to take more risk because
197.52s: their risk would be their positions
199.28s: would be too small or they were always
201.36s: like there's two ways of being risk
202.80s: averse one is your positions are too
204.24s: small and you can't pull the trigger
206.40s: that's kind of like the textbook thing
208.08s: right like i can't can't always waiting
210.48s: for the perfect trade and all that yeah
212.96s: but then there's another form of it
214.48s: which is
215.76s: people that put on risk but then just
217.44s: always want to take it off so like any
219.36s: excuse like oh the price action you know
221.28s: it should have gone down by now and that
223.36s: kind of like there's a lot of traders
224.88s: that will just make a million excuses
226.88s: because it's the having the risk that
229.04s: makes them nervous not the putting it on
231.44s: so
232.40s: i found that really interesting when i
234.48s: started becoming a manager on wall
235.92s: street was
237.04s: that actually 80 percent of people are
239.68s: risk averse and what you really wanted
241.76s: was like the 22 year old analyst that
244.40s: came in and like where i was like dude
247.04s: you're taking way too much risk this is
248.56s: insane like that's that was very rare
251.12s: and that's what i was so like you know
253.28s: you when you don't know the world that
255.60s: well which i didn't you just think
257.20s: everyone's kind of like you but
258.32s: obviously that's not the case so
260.88s: everyone i think like a really important
263.04s: thing
264.32s: in this whole dialogue is being really
267.52s: self-aware about what your thing is like
269.92s: you know yeah are you risk-averse are
272.00s: you like what are you good at and what
273.84s: are you not good at
275.36s: and like for me one big breakthrough i
278.08s: had was
279.76s: acknowledging
281.04s: so like everyone wants to like get
282.64s: better right like self-improvement and
284.64s: that that sort of like the the
287.04s: um
288.80s: sorry like the the growth mindset and
291.28s: all that is like i'm not who i am now or
293.52s: i am who i'm now but i can be anything
296.08s: through improvement and stuff and i
298.16s: think that philosophy kind of like
299.68s: dominates education and a lot of trading
301.92s: education as well but the reality is
304.96s: that some things you cannot change and
307.12s: that was actually a big breakthrough for
308.96s: me was instead of saying like okay
311.28s: tomorrow i'm gonna be more disciplined
312.80s: i'm definitely gonna like follow my
314.40s: rules tomorrow
316.00s: was that mentality didn't work for me
318.32s: because the next day like i'd make the
320.00s: same mistake again right so the
322.24s: mentality actually that helped me a lot
324.00s: was
325.04s: okay my self-discipline sucks like my or
327.68s: my self-control sucks so
330.72s: instead of trying to fix it
332.64s: like now whatever like in those days i
334.56s: was when i made this kind of leap or
336.72s: whatever i was probably 30 33 or
338.64s: something i'm like okay i'm 33 years old
340.64s: my my self-control still sucks so what
343.28s: am i going to do about it and then
345.76s: when i acknowledged it and then started
347.76s: putting in systems and and like
349.76s: basically automating more of my risk
351.68s: management and stuff like that that was
353.52s: like a big leap for me was like instead
356.16s: of putting having the chips in the
357.68s: cupboard in the closet and saying like
360.72s: okay i'm definitely not gonna eat the
362.16s: chips tonight
363.36s: it's better to just not have the chips
364.96s: in the closet and the fresher and the
366.24s: cupboard in the first place you say
367.52s: cupboard or closet i'm canadian
369.84s: i was going to say you must be canadian
371.92s: so here we have we would go with closet
375.12s: if it's like a big one
376.96s: a pantry is a big tree yeah maybe pantry
379.44s: was the word i was looking for every now
381.20s: and then
382.00s: pantry yeah i like the other night i
384.32s: actually said uh or i was in actually a
386.40s: board room and i you know there's food
388.64s: there and i was getting a water and i
390.48s: said anybody want to pop
392.24s: and like the friggin silence in that
394.80s: room holy crow
396.40s: no
397.28s: i try to
398.24s: i have a few miss midwest friends and
400.56s: they'll go with pop and it's always at
403.04s: least i mean these are friends i've been
404.40s: friends with for a decade and i'll fight
406.32s: with them for 10 minutes every time pop
407.92s: is a sound pop is a noise
410.72s: so i mean i've been in the u.s since 06
412.72s: so i've like cleared most of these ticks
414.48s: by now but uh
415.92s: you know they they still sneak back but
417.92s: anyways um okay i'll give you the mic
420.56s: back but um yeah the the whole the whole
422.72s: spectrum of uh from like risk-averse to
425.92s: risk-seeking is really interesting and i
428.24s: think like
429.52s: knowing your own place on that spectrum
431.92s: and trying to move to a more appropriate
434.32s: point on the spectrum but then also
436.48s: knowing like there's only so far you can
438.72s: move yourself because
440.48s: you're fundamental like who you are
443.36s: is somewhat anchored you know like it's
445.28s: not completely it's definitely not fixed
448.00s: um but it is somewhat anchored and then
450.08s: so understanding that i think is useful
454.16s: i absolutely agree with you when you see
455.68s: me put my head down i'm just taking some
457.20s: notes because i actually i actually
459.28s: really want to talk about that risk to
461.36s: reward spectrum a little bit later
464.32s: so
465.12s: for general context um i want to talk a
468.56s: little bit
469.68s: about your background so from my
472.64s: understanding
474.32s: you started at citibank at the fx desk
479.20s: yes yep that's right yep i started 19
482.24s: 1995 95 yeah
484.72s: and then you worked at the spot desk for
487.28s: a bit and then you decided that you were
490.32s: the next steven spielberg
492.40s: so you wanted to go into film
494.80s: yeah and then that had um
497.84s: mixed outputs so then it was a
500.96s: subsequent rotation
502.96s: back to floor trading good so far
506.64s: yeah it wasn't really floor trading it
508.64s: was more like
510.00s: the term people usually use as bucket
511.84s: shop but it wasn't a bucket shop it was
513.76s: like a professional day trading place
516.00s: you know that many of those existed in
517.76s: the late 1990s yeah
520.56s: so i was kind of doing the creative
522.56s: thing which the the most like the peak
524.72s: of that success was like we had a
526.40s: cartoon on tv in canada for like two
528.64s: years yeah that's right what was it
530.00s: called daft planet yeah that's right
532.32s: yeah so i was doing that and trading the
534.56s: nasdaq bubble
536.08s: um at the same time so yes anyways 100
539.44s: accurate so far
540.80s: all right um and i even got the cartoon
542.64s: name i'm pretty yeah that's pretty good
544.08s: good research
545.60s: i watched a couple episodes of it
547.12s: actually on on youtube it's like it's
549.04s: it's actually really good i think
552.64s: i think that i think that the timing was
554.56s: rough because i know that south park was
556.64s: getting big in the mid 90s
558.72s: um and they did it you know they took a
561.52s: lot of limelight but i like i don't know
563.84s: the humor that you guys have in there is
565.28s: i i think like really well really well
567.36s: done so it's actually the opposite so
569.76s: south park helped us because
572.00s: the the sort of like
574.08s: way in animation in that time was
577.36s: basically like script and story over
580.24s: animation quality because south park's
582.08s: animation quality was low like
583.60s: intentionally
584.88s: the bar to make like a
587.20s: show wasn't as high so like our our show
589.92s: was actually the first one uh the first
592.16s: animated tv show made in flash like
594.24s: remember flash
595.68s: i don't but no okay flash was like a a
598.40s: program that was used mostly for online
600.40s: animation okay and so our show was the
602.56s: first so it's still like cost like 250
604.56s: grand an episode but that was cheap at
606.96s: the time for for a show
609.92s: so
610.96s: yeah but the business model generally in
612.72s: canada for for a lot of artistic things
615.52s: is you got to sell it in the us within
617.36s: like a year or two because that's like
619.28s: really interesting the economies of
621.04s: scale
622.00s: in the canadian market being like 1 10
623.84s: the size of the us aren't great like
626.32s: depending on what the thing is
627.92s: um and then when you release in the us
629.76s: you get like the big marketing halo and
631.44s: all that because
632.88s: the us tv and ra like not radio now but
635.92s: the tv and
637.36s: print and all that like all kind of
639.12s: flows back into canada so
641.28s: um so anyways we never sold it in the us
643.52s: so i'll let you continue
645.44s: interesting yeah i mean that's
646.80s: interesting background though so then
649.04s: um
650.00s: after that is when you said that you
652.16s: were trading the
653.52s: the nasdaq bubble
656.48s: is that accurate that's right yeah okay
659.44s: and then you did some time in hedge
662.16s: funds after that mixed hedge funds i
664.32s: know that you worked at a couple places
665.92s: hsbc and
667.36s: um
668.24s: i think what city also or is that yes i
670.88s: went back to city again um so
673.76s: basically what happened was like this is
675.84s: this is relevant to to trading so i'll
678.16s: tell you a little bit more detail
680.00s: was
681.28s: around like
683.60s: 2 000 right around the cusp of when the
686.24s: bubble peaked i think like april 2000 i
688.24s: think was a peak march april 2000
690.64s: um
691.52s: it was getting harder to do what i was
693.12s: doing but it was still fine so mostly my
695.84s: strategy was i had a in those days you
698.80s: had a like the s p pit was still a thing
701.04s: like the actual pit in chicago or
702.88s: whatever
703.68s: so i had a like a a feed like an
706.40s: earphone whatever to the at two guys
709.28s: the squawk from the pit
711.28s: and you could kind of get a sense of
712.96s: like
713.76s: when smps were bid and when they were
715.52s: heavy and all that and then i had like
717.68s: eight stocks on my screen that were all
720.32s: like high absolute value stocks so like
722.24s: stocks trading from 100 to 500 a share
725.52s: and when you could feel like bullish
727.04s: energy in the pit in the s ps you get on
729.76s: i get on the bid and all the stocks so
731.76s: if it was a hundred it and some of them
733.60s: were trading pretty wide like 100 102
735.92s: say like some of the the shitty tech
737.52s: stocks were trading yeah so i'd go at
740.00s: that time it was fraction so i go 100
742.00s: and one-eighth bid and there's enough
743.84s: retail back and forth sometimes you'd
745.52s: get filled but in a in a moment where
748.40s: like smps were kind of ticking higher so
751.04s: you know obviously that was a good time
752.16s: to be getting filled on the bid and then
753.92s: you just try and offer them out at 101
755.60s: and 7 8 right away
757.28s: got it and so
758.64s: part of that was every morning i printed
760.56s: a thing of all the stocks over a hundred
762.80s: because that was kind of what was
763.84s: necessary because you didn't want to be
765.76s: trading a stock that was at like five
767.52s: bucks like sun microsystems or something
769.76s: because you had to do so many shares you
771.76s: know when the spreads were smaller what
773.68s: you are like absolute value and low
775.76s: volume because the commission was was a
777.52s: big thing in those days so
780.00s: like it was a much easier to be gross
782.48s: positive but obviously you had to be net
784.16s: positive so you wanted to pay as little
786.08s: bro as you could in those days it
787.60s: actually mattered a lot
789.04s: so
789.76s: anyways what kind of leverage
791.52s: just sorry just out of curiosity what
792.80s: kind of leverage were you using if you
794.24s: were i mean you're taking for what like
795.44s: a point ride or something like that yeah
797.60s: so like
798.88s: not very much like i might i open my
801.44s: account with 25 grand i think we only
803.28s: had two to one two to one margin i'm
805.04s: pretty sure oh okay so yeah interesting
808.08s: um
809.28s: so
810.88s: uh yeah so in the morning i would print
812.72s: out a sheet of all the stocks over 100
814.40s: and it was like four pages long
816.56s: and so in o2 this is when when things
819.60s: started going pear-shaped for me when i
821.52s: printed that thing out in the morning
822.80s: there was four stocks on it so
824.96s: like the absolute value of the stocks
826.56s: had collapsed so my churn rate was going
828.72s: up a lot so
830.08s: almost every day i'd still be gross
831.92s: positive but a lot of days now i was net
834.40s: negative because of the brokerage so i
836.40s: would make four grant like say i'd make
838.16s: uh 3 800 bucks and my commission would
841.04s: be 4 200 or whatever and you know that's
842.88s: a lot of work to make and you know i
844.56s: don't know if those numbers are that
845.84s: that's probably on the high side but you
847.76s: know but some days i'd make you know
850.08s: whatever anyway so i was kind of like it
852.64s: was getting more and more difficult to
853.92s: make money
855.04s: and then what killed me was
856.88s: decimalization came in um at that time
859.60s: as well and then all the spreads just
861.60s: went like
862.64s: after that so like things that were
864.40s: trading two bucks wide were now like
866.88s: there was all these little shitty bids
868.40s: and offers in there on all the pennies
871.20s: so
872.72s: it was a really good lesson for my like
875.04s: broader career um so basically like i
877.76s: took my account from like 25 grand to
879.92s: 350 to 350 000
882.56s: and like i made way more than that
884.16s: because i paid my taxes i bought like an
886.08s: m3 out of that i paid my rent for i was
888.64s: out of like i was doing that basically
890.64s: for five years
892.00s: um except the tv show i got paid a
894.08s: little bit
895.12s: um
896.00s: so like i did really well but then
898.64s: starting with basically the day
900.32s: decimalization happened
902.24s: i never adopted and i never really found
905.20s: a new way to trade and so my equity
907.76s: started going the
909.36s: like slowly slowly down
911.52s: and i was just basically bleeding every
913.44s: day and i could kind of feel like okay
915.36s: this isn't happening anymore like i
916.80s: don't know what i'm i don't know how to
918.08s: make money anymore
919.60s: um
920.56s: so and it coincided a whole bunch of
922.88s: things happened so the show got
924.16s: cancelled
925.28s: right around that same time as
926.64s: decimalization and then i met my wife so
929.12s: i was like i kind of wouldn't mind
930.64s: having like a real job now like i've
932.16s: been partying and trading for five years
934.16s: it's kind of like yeah i'm gonna be an
935.76s: adult
936.72s: and
938.00s: also i'd been out for almost five years
939.92s: so i thought like if i'm i still had
941.60s: people that i knew that i had worked
942.96s: with and stuff so it's like if peop if
944.40s: someone wants to hire me
946.00s: you know after five years that's gonna
947.52s: be a miracle but like after seven or
949.36s: eight years people are just gonna say
951.04s: like dude you've been gone too long
952.48s: nobody knows who you are right so i
955.36s: decided at that time
957.20s: to then go back into into trading so
960.24s: back into fx trading but the the reason
963.36s: that i left part of the reason i left
965.12s: originally was market making was 100
967.84s: percent flow in the 90s it was just like
970.40s: super transactional sell 100 buy 50 and
973.68s: basically you're just trying to keep
974.80s: track of your position and like take all
977.28s: the crumbs and make 100 grand and be
979.44s: happy
980.56s: and
981.60s: now so like now fast forward to 2022
985.12s: almost all the market making is
986.64s: automated like especially in what i do
988.64s: which is spot fx is the most
990.24s: commoditized of all the it's one of the
992.40s: most commoditized products really in the
994.08s: world most liquid and commoditized
996.24s: products even more than like probably
997.76s: apple stock
998.96s: um
999.92s: so but actually what that opened up was
1002.32s: a lot of opportunities for the job to be
1004.08s: a lot more interesting so
1006.32s: now the job is much more about like
1008.40s: talking to clients almost acting like a
1010.08s: consultant
1011.44s: excuse me and then also writing about
1013.52s: macro and being more strategic trying to
1016.40s: take positions and and
1018.24s: like forecast the market and like kind
1020.40s: of what i always thought trading really
1021.92s: was um as opposed to what market making
1024.64s: is which is executing transactions for
1027.44s: external counterparties which
1029.44s: wasn't i didn't never found very much
1031.44s: fun
1032.32s: um but the downside of that is that like
1034.64s: when i started at city in
1036.84s: 1995 the spot spot is like you know
1040.00s: two-day settlement
1041.44s: currency trade so normal currency trades
1043.28s: that people think of like you know i'm
1045.04s: buying euro i'm selling dollar yen or
1046.80s: whatever
1047.76s: that spot and the spot desk at city new
1050.64s: york was 30 people when i started and
1052.88s: now like most spot deaths are three
1055.12s: three people um because computers can do
1057.92s: most almost all the trades right so you
1060.48s: as a market maker and fx now
1063.04s: you basically do like the huge trades
1065.60s: and you you know take risk based on what
1067.92s: you think is going to happen like based
1069.36s: on where you think the market's going
1071.20s: and then you talk to clients and it's so
1072.96s: it's more of like almost like a hybrid
1075.44s: like what i've developed into is more
1077.36s: like a hybrid sales trading um and
1080.16s: research kind of like
1082.32s: i don't know i was going to say triple
1083.76s: threat but that sounds way too uh
1086.16s: it sounds very sexy yeah way too sexy
1089.12s: way more sexy than i am
1091.68s: so but like you know i think that's
1093.68s: that's kind of like the
1095.68s: people that work at banks that are that
1097.60s: are succeeding now on on desks a lot of
1101.04s: them are doing that more like more
1102.88s: hybrid role where you're talking to
1104.32s: clients and taking risks but then also
1107.20s: um doing more like researchy kind of
1109.68s: stuff and then some actually doing quant
1111.92s: stuff as well which uh that's not really
1114.40s: my area like i'm i'm functional in excel
1117.12s: and stuff but i'm not like applied math
1119.36s: guy
1120.64s: um got it yeah i've had a couple people
1123.04s: that i've worked with and um actually my
1125.12s: best friend is kind of a
1126.72s: super
1127.92s: nerd when it comes to excel and
1129.20s: sometimes
1130.40s: i feel proficient but then i do stuff
1132.88s: around them and then i just feel like an
1134.32s: idiot so yeah yeah same here like when
1136.56s: the vlookup's not doing what you wanted
1138.24s: it to do and you're like yeah
1140.24s: they're pretty sure i learned that like
1141.68s: the first club first class but
1144.40s: you know you don't have to worry about
1145.84s: it because there's some six-year-old on
1148.00s: youtube that can walk you right through
1149.60s: it yeah and then you're just like
1151.60s: sick this kid is in middle school
1155.44s: i'll just cut and paste his code
1156.96s: straight into excel
1159.84s: so one of my main questions i think i
1162.24s: was telling you before we started um i i
1164.80s: did trade some some fx when i was in
1167.92s: college so i started trading
1170.08s: when i was in high school but it was
1171.76s: mostly just stock and then i because i
1175.20s: didn't have any money i was like three
1176.56s: five thousand dollars three two five
1178.80s: thousand not thirty five thousand thirty
1180.80s: five thousand in high school would have
1181.92s: been sick um
1184.08s: but anyways you know i i didn't have a
1185.76s: bunch of money and then in college i
1187.68s: came across
1189.12s: fx and i for a while fx was at least on
1191.84s: the retail side was was kind of a big
1193.84s: deal because it seemed like there was
1196.08s: this thought that it was fast easy money
1199.36s: that was like the general messaging
1201.60s: around it and you know i thought fast
1204.48s: easy money that sounds that sounds like
1206.96s: me yes please yeah right yeah and then
1210.24s: and then i realized it was like you know
1212.72s: lose your money fast and easy was
1214.72s: probably a better yeah moniker for it
1216.80s: because i was trading it for a little
1218.56s: bit
1219.68s: i had moderate success at best
1222.64s: and it was not worth the time you know
1224.96s: for what what i was trying to get out of
1227.28s: it and i would love to know other than
1230.00s: you just starting in you know fx when
1232.72s: you first kind of got into the markets
1234.64s: what's kept you there why fx why not
1237.36s: futures on equities why not other
1240.24s: products what's kept you there
1242.08s: well so
1243.52s: my kind of like interest was always more
1246.48s: macro than micro like in terms of
1248.64s: economics and all that
1250.56s: um i wouldn't say that like i was super
1252.64s: thoughtful and strategic about where i
1254.48s: ended up i was like 22 and i kind of
1256.32s: ended up in fx
1258.16s: some like not totally randomly but kind
1260.56s: of like i had a couple choices and i
1262.16s: picked it and
1263.44s: but the reason that it appeals to me is
1266.96s: that there's so many like there's just
1269.12s: this constant ebb and flow of new
1271.36s: narratives like a lot of what i do is
1273.12s: kind of around narrative sentiment
1274.64s: positioning trying to understand like
1277.52s: kind of what the crowd's doing and then
1280.08s: being ahead of it and
1281.92s: you know i have more of an edge in that
1283.84s: now than i used to because like i just
1285.92s: because i know a lot of people and i
1287.04s: talk to a lot of people
1288.96s: but even when i was starting out i think
1290.72s: i always liked the macro
1292.64s: like the kind of
1293.92s: like on like unchanging or sorry
1296.40s: continuously changing narratives
1298.56s: like this crazy puzzle that's so complex
1301.28s: that it can never be solved and like
1303.92s: just when you think you've solved it
1305.92s: you know all the rules change and those
1307.76s: things you thought mattered don't even
1309.12s: matter whereas like to me like dcf and
1312.56s: 10ks and stuff like that
1314.96s: never really appealed to me as much um
1317.76s: because i'm just more into like macro
1320.24s: and behavioral stuff so like i i think
1323.44s: and then
1324.88s: like the approach that i use in terms of
1326.96s: like behavioral stuff um
1329.20s: i think would work like works across
1331.36s: asset classes but
1333.04s: generally i think it's so hard to make
1335.12s: money trading
1336.48s: that you really just have to like become
1338.88s: expert on your thing and like you can
1341.36s: understand and watch other things and
1342.80s: maybe incorporate other asset classes
1345.20s: into your into your framework but i feel
1348.16s: like so like my my guess would be that
1350.40s: like if you're succeeding in what you're
1351.84s: doing now in equities
1353.52s: if you had devoted the same amount of
1355.04s: time to fx you probably would have found
1356.80s: your your niche you know what i mean
1358.48s: like i don't think there is some aspect
1361.44s: like i've described
1363.36s: my
1364.48s: kind of interest in economics and stuff
1366.08s: was always more macro so i think my
1368.40s: personality is more
1370.16s: like i'm more likely to enjoy myself
1371.92s: doing effects than than doing like small
1374.48s: caps just because that's more macro
1377.12s: but at the same time
1379.68s: you know like does that mean there's
1381.04s: more like a greater chance i'd have an
1382.88s: edge in it i don't really think so like
1384.72s: if i spent 10 years
1386.64s: trading small caps i think i could
1388.16s: probably figure out my edge and it'd
1389.84s: probably be something kind of different
1391.20s: and maybe not as behavioral but
1393.36s: i think that's why i'm a big proponent
1395.12s: of um
1396.72s: really like picking a thing and saying
1398.16s: okay like i'm going to be as expert as i
1399.84s: possibly can at this and like i said it
1402.56s: doesn't preclude you from looking at
1404.00s: other stuff for trading other stuff
1406.24s: um but um
1408.40s: but yeah like so
1409.84s: the question i guess is like
1412.16s: can people have an edge in fx
1414.56s: i think generally
1416.48s: you
1417.28s: first of all having an edge in any
1418.80s: product is extremely difficult and
1420.48s: there's like so much empirical data that
1422.80s: supports that
1424.00s: you know what day traders and equities
1425.60s: or fx or whatever the success rate's
1427.60s: very low
1429.84s: but the upside is huge so like not just
1432.64s: financially but also like quality of
1434.24s: life and enjoyment you know like
1436.40s: um i i have some stuff that i've written
1438.88s: in my book about like the the
1440.64s: relationship between money and happiness
1442.48s: and
1443.20s: everyone has their own curve and all
1444.56s: that and my curve's pretty flat like you
1446.80s: know making more money doesn't really
1448.96s: make me happier um but i still love
1451.60s: trading and i love writing about trading
1453.44s: just because it's like a it's an
1455.36s: interesting puzzle that's constantly
1456.88s: yeah it's fun and like i guess the money
1459.20s: is
1460.00s: is like a measuring
1462.16s: rod or whatever like a video game has a
1464.00s: score and trading can sometimes be like
1467.20s: that um
1469.28s: but then also like it is
1471.68s: still real you know like it's not like a
1473.28s: video game because
1474.72s: it's connected to the real world in
1476.72s: different ways although less connected
1478.24s: than it used to be i guess um like
1480.16s: financial markets in the in the real
1481.84s: world have been drifting apart for the
1483.92s: last 15 years so yeah now one of the
1487.44s: things i'm curious about um again just
1489.76s: kind of from a selfish perspective in my
1492.48s: own curiosity yeah so when i was trading
1496.40s: fx it felt like longer time frames were
1500.48s: very difficult for me to
1503.04s: align with to
1504.72s: figure out
1506.24s: where things were most likely to go i'm
1508.00s: sure it's a good amount of experience
1510.00s: that i was missing for that but i what
1512.08s: led me closer to equities was it felt
1516.24s: more forgiving
1517.60s: um where things i could swing trade or
1521.60s: even trade you know like i like to trade
1523.92s: options like i was telling you so i'll
1525.84s: have leaps diagonals on that i manage in
1529.04s: six to nine months
1530.80s: and i've had pretty good success with
1532.96s: those kinds of things
1534.80s: in fx
1536.32s: i felt like i could never find that so i
1538.48s: would be curious just to understand
1540.80s: your perspective on time frames that you
1544.72s: would think more people could be
1546.96s: successful in if they were trading fx or
1549.36s: even from your own experience like what
1551.20s: time frames you prefer the most
1553.44s: yeah so my time frame is much shorter um
1556.16s: yeah
1556.96s: and like a time frame is a really
1558.88s: important question like part of it is
1560.56s: personality
1561.84s: so
1562.72s: if you're not like if you're a patient
1564.80s: person who like tends to over sorry
1567.60s: inpatient person who tends to over trade
1570.32s: you know like
1571.36s: that's going to be obviously more suited
1573.04s: to shorter time horizons and then if
1574.88s: you're like sort of like a patient
1576.32s: mature wise person
1578.80s: like you are then it sounds like then
1581.28s: you're a longer time frame would be true
1583.68s: well like i don't know you found your
1585.28s: way about no i get it holding on to
1587.20s: things and stuff then a longer time
1589.44s: frame works
1591.04s: i think philosophically
1593.20s: for me
1594.56s: so generally like my average holding
1596.24s: period is about two days but it varies
1598.96s: from like one hour to two months like
1601.12s: it's that one but um and mostly if i'm
1604.00s: doing longer stuff it's through options
1607.04s: um but a lot of it has to do with like
1610.00s: understanding what is signal and what's
1612.40s: noise on your specific time horizon so
1615.44s: like people have these macro views like
1618.32s: oh the you know russia sanctions mean
1621.04s: china's going to switch out of
1622.72s: treasuries into gold so i'm going to be
1624.64s: long gold but then their stop is like
1626.88s: four percent below the market or
1628.16s: whatever and like so that would be a
1629.68s: timing mismatch of like a super macro
1632.16s: trade with a
1633.60s: stop loss like 1.5 days ranges away
1636.80s: right so i think that's a mistake that a
1638.56s: lot of people make is
1640.48s: the combination of like leverage
1642.96s: tightness of stop and like trying to
1645.20s: make x amount of money or whatever
1647.28s: doesn't always fit with the with the
1649.20s: thesis or the time horizon that they're
1650.88s: trading
1651.92s: um
1652.80s: but generally i find and so this is just
1656.08s: like a philosophical thing to me but
1659.20s: when you think about something like a
1661.76s: very very complex system like markets or
1664.56s: like weather or whatever
1666.40s: i feel like the more you go out and and
1669.36s: like it's interesting because this
1670.88s: obviously isn't consistent with your
1672.88s: your
1673.76s: experience but my experience is
1676.80s: that like sometimes i feel like i can
1678.72s: basically see what's gonna happen before
1680.32s: it's happening for like a day or two and
1682.88s: then i try to hold on to it for another
1684.56s: day and another day and then and then i
1686.40s: end up giving the whole thing back
1688.32s: so whatever it is that i understand i
1690.64s: have that where i can like see like i
1693.12s: feel like i can see the future because
1694.80s: of probably pattern recognition and sure
1697.12s: and stuff like that
1698.88s: it seems to dissipate after about two
1700.80s: days
1701.68s: and like my i keep a lot of data on my
1704.08s: trading data on my trading and it
1706.48s: supports that as well
1708.24s: um and actually just one takeaway for
1710.72s: people watching
1712.16s: is if you keep data on your trading
1715.52s: you'll learn
1716.72s: 80 of the stuff you you find in the data
1719.04s: will be like yeah i knew that i lose
1720.88s: money in the afternoons or whatever
1723.04s: but there'll be a few nuggets in there
1724.88s: where you're like whoa like i didn't
1726.40s: know that like i had no idea and
1727.84s: actually i said the losing money in the
1729.36s: afternoons thing so when i worked i
1731.20s: worked at a hedge fund for a few years
1733.36s: and i used to snap my p l every 30
1735.68s: minutes and fx is very busy when
1738.56s: london's in and then it tends to fizzle
1740.88s: after that so
1742.16s: 7 a.m or really like 6 a.m new york till
1745.04s: 11 a.m is like the good time to trade fx
1747.92s: and like everyone knows that and you
1749.60s: know i knew that i probably shouldn't
1751.04s: trade in the afternoon
1752.40s: but then i started snapping my p l every
1754.64s: 30 minutes
1755.76s: and basically like if you just normalize
1757.60s: it to like
1758.72s: maximum p l like this is starting p l
1761.76s: then that's maximum the maximum was at
1763.92s: 11 and then i was losing between 11 and
1766.24s: 5 p.m i was losing about 35 percent of
1768.48s: my p l like on average
1770.40s: so like yeah i knew that afternoons
1772.40s: weren't great to trade but then when i
1773.76s: saw that i'm like that's like a lot of
1775.52s: money you know yeah
1777.04s: a percentage at a hedge fund so that's
1779.52s: like real money that's you know it it
1783.04s: registered for the first time in my mind
1785.12s: like okay i really have to like pretty
1787.20s: much square up at 11 or like reduce my
1789.84s: position reduce my risk to 20 of what it
1792.48s: was or whatever um
1795.04s: and so very like a specific i mean
1797.44s: that's a pretty specific thing that i
1798.88s: learned
1799.68s: but whatever data people can keep um
1802.48s: like a journal like in is generally
1806.16s: people think of a trading journal as
1807.60s: like words and and thoughts and all that
1810.48s: but also like keeping like i got in at
1812.80s: this time out at this time depends on
1814.88s: your frequency like if you're doing
1817.12s: 200 trades a day then that's not
1819.12s: realistic and then your data has to be
1820.80s: on
1821.52s: like your granularity has to be daily
1823.84s: levels but if you're doing like four
1825.20s: trades a day you can keep track pretty
1827.44s: specifically and then you can start to
1829.12s: see
1830.00s: um and you you can start to get
1831.68s: information about like oh whenever i do
1834.00s: options beyond a month like so that's
1836.88s: what one thing i started noticing was
1838.56s: like i used to do a lot of options that
1840.08s: were pretty short
1841.36s: and i noticed like one week options
1844.08s: at the end of the year one week options
1845.92s: were making me a lot of money and
1847.68s: overnight options were were killing like
1849.60s: we're super negative
1851.68s: and there's kind of like a reason for
1853.52s: that in the market in fx like this is
1855.68s: boring so i won't get into it but
1857.20s: generally overnight options are very
1858.80s: expensive because nobody wants to sell
1860.56s: them
1861.52s: probably same thing in equities right as
1863.20s: you as you get to like the stupid short
1865.04s: time horizons nobody wants to sell that
1866.72s: thing because the leverage is too crazy
1869.20s: so if you're systematically buying those
1871.36s: things you're losing money so i would
1873.52s: just encourage your your peeps to just
1876.56s: keep as detailed as as within reason um
1880.40s: yeah and then
1881.52s: so the interesting thing is like just
1883.12s: sit there and collect it for three
1884.56s: months
1885.44s: and then after three months or whatever
1887.68s: go look at it and go like okay what you
1889.92s: know what can i learn here you don't
1891.44s: have to constantly be checking back on
1893.12s: it like
1894.24s: most of my trip most of my data i just
1896.64s: have it in a sheet and like i look at it
1898.64s: once a quarter and i go because
1900.32s: especially now i kind of know what it's
1901.76s: going to say
1902.80s: um but then sometimes you're like oh wow
1904.80s: i'm surprised like you know i every
1906.96s: single option i did like this quarter
1909.92s: lost money and all my spot trades made
1911.52s: money like sometimes it's even something
1913.52s: that obviously you don't realize so
1915.76s: well and i feel like there's a ton of
1917.52s: value in that i actually do a segment
1919.28s: right now it's called teaching to trade
1921.28s: i like to four random people from my
1923.68s: audience and we meet each week and we
1925.36s: record sessions together essentially
1927.04s: just about like learning our skill set
1928.96s: together okay and one of the big things
1931.44s: is trade logs i'm a huge advocate of
1934.64s: trade documentation and especially when
1937.52s: i think people are early on in their
1940.08s: journey it even starts to give you
1941.84s: information in terms of like what's
1943.36s: important to track
1944.96s: and then over time you can cut out
1946.80s: things like you know for options
1948.96s: i originally tracked all of the first
1951.68s: order and second order greeks
1954.08s: super overkill did not need to happen
1956.48s: and i don't do that anymore but now i
1958.40s: know that if i'm trading you know two
1960.40s: week options row doesn't really matter
1962.64s: that much however for really long-term
1965.20s: stuff especially during a year like this
1967.28s: when interest rates are moving row is
1969.28s: now important and we know that you know
1971.28s: from reviewing that kind of data so yeah
1973.52s: i love that you mentioned that
1975.04s: especially because i i do feel like
1977.44s: there's such a paradox with retail
1979.12s: trading it's so
1981.04s: easy to enter now even robin hood you
1983.68s: know they like gamify it's literally a
1985.36s: game now yeah and it just a lot of
1987.76s: people feel like well you could just
1989.52s: walk onto the field and play this game
1991.60s: and be successful
1993.20s: and you know as you rightfully pointed
1994.96s: out it's statistically speaking like
1997.20s: literally not the case it's just not how
1999.04s: this this whole thing works i
2001.28s: it my
2002.72s: main like i have two books but my first
2004.40s: one's just about fx trading and my
2006.00s: second one's more about trading in
2007.20s: general
2008.24s: but in the first couple chapters of that
2010.00s: book i kind of go into like
2012.24s: success rates and like what it takes to
2014.48s: succeed and all that kind of stuff in
2016.24s: trading
2017.20s: and the the thing about trading is that
2019.84s: it's like online poker or or like
2021.92s: professional poker
2023.44s: like anyone can go sit down right um but
2027.04s: like i think it's really important to
2029.04s: understand like not necessarily on day
2030.80s: one like nobody has an edge on day one
2033.28s: um but to like be kind of looking at
2035.68s: like okay what's my edge gonna be
2037.36s: because
2038.40s: there's a lot of like
2041.04s: i don't wanna say like get rich quick
2042.48s: but i guess that's what it is right it's
2044.00s: getting get rich quick kind of mentality
2046.16s: of
2047.04s: like technical formations that are
2049.36s: generally like what a lot of companies
2051.44s: will do is like back test a bunch of
2053.44s: things find some things that work and
2054.88s: then market the success rate of those
2056.88s: things but out of sample they don't work
2058.88s: they just worked you know it's data
2060.96s: mining kind of thing
2062.24s: and so like there is in my opinion
2065.20s: and i can pretty much say this like with
2067.20s: 100 certainty there's no easy way to
2070.00s: trade like there's no like you draw a
2071.68s: line on a thing and when it breaks you
2073.84s: sell it and then you make money
2075.28s: constantly
2076.56s: if that was a thing
2078.24s: first of all like that it isn't a thing
2079.84s: but if everybody would do it there'd be
2081.68s: computers doing it and there are
2083.76s: computers doing it you know so like
2085.76s: the simplest
2087.04s: the very simplest things
2089.52s: don't exist as profitable like alpha
2092.40s: generating strategies yeah the thing is
2094.80s: though also is that i don't feel like
2097.04s: the level of complexity has to be like
2099.20s: insanely higher either
2101.20s: like a simple strategy of
2103.92s: trying to determine when people are
2105.36s: panicking and doing the opposite
2107.44s: like that's kind of what renaissance
2108.88s: technologies did for a long time right
2110.64s: is just finding like a basic
2112.88s: inefficiency in the market and then
2114.96s: trying to capitalize on it so like
2117.28s: there used to be things like sometimes
2119.04s: headlines used to be like that right
2120.48s: it's just there's an a there's like uh
2122.80s: equilibrium asymmetry where
2124.96s: for
2125.68s: 15 seconds a headline comes out and the
2128.24s: price discovery happens and if you're
2130.08s: really fast like that was one of the
2131.44s: things i did in 99 in the 90s was i was
2134.48s: just really fast because i played a lot
2135.76s: of video games and so
2138.16s: something came out and i said
2139.84s: and then i was i was out as the other
2141.92s: people were trying to buy on the
2143.28s: headline that were slow you know i mean
2144.72s: i was selling to those guys right so
2146.64s: that can be like an edge can be that
2148.72s: simple
2149.68s: um but like having some understanding of
2153.52s: like why
2155.04s: should you be able to make money is and
2157.28s: sometimes i think you can figure it out
2159.12s: right like somebody notices like oh
2161.52s: these spacks are mispriced or like they
2164.96s: you know they'll when the lockup happens
2166.72s: on these ipos
2168.32s: there's a two-week window where the
2169.68s: stock goes down and like that's a
2171.84s: violation of efficient markets but
2174.24s: the flow is bigger than
2176.16s: the buy and nobody's buying for those
2177.68s: two weeks and so like you know there's
2180.24s: to me there's like
2181.76s: the market is extremely efficient
2184.48s: um on like most time frames but there's
2186.72s: all these millions of little
2188.16s: inefficiencies constantly happening and
2190.88s: if you're good you you're not really
2192.72s: like you don't have to be some like
2194.32s: george soros macro genius savant you
2198.24s: just find these like if you become
2199.68s: really good at your thing your your cur
2201.84s: your currency or your whatever your your
2204.64s: stock
2205.52s: you start to see little inefficiencies
2207.36s: are like oh if you have level two like
2209.04s: when this person's buying
2210.88s: you know it always seems to tick like 30
2212.64s: 30 cents higher right you just start
2214.24s: seeing patterns and um
2216.72s: so
2217.68s: my point my original point was that
2220.56s: there's a lot of marketing and stuff of
2222.48s: like super simple
2224.00s: methodologies um usually involving
2226.64s: charts and texts and breakouts and stuff
2228.56s: like that and they don't work so i'm
2230.24s: just telling people
2232.00s: don't do that because it's it like and
2235.20s: you're better off i think you said
2236.64s: actually in
2237.60s: a video that i was just watching before
2239.84s: like don't spend your money on that
2241.52s: thing put like if you're gonna spend 15
2243.76s: grand on a course or whatever
2245.84s: put like five grand in a in a trading
2248.72s: account and buy like a thousand dollars
2250.64s: worth of books and read all those books
2252.32s: and you'll get way more out of it
2254.08s: um a lot of the like courses and stuff
2256.64s: or you were talking about discord um yes
2259.36s: but but like there's
2260.88s: you know there's there's definitely very
2262.72s: good products out there but
2264.56s: in general i think like
2266.80s: you can probably have just as good odds
2269.20s: teaching yourself because the incentives
2271.60s: are aligned when you're teaching
2272.64s: yourself and if you're buying a course
2274.72s: then it's not guaranteed that the
2276.00s: incentives are aligned but anyways i
2277.60s: didn't mean to come on here and talk
2278.80s: about trading courses but
2280.96s: no i i i again literally that's why i
2283.68s: love these conversations they go
2284.80s: wherever they go and i think there's
2286.32s: like goodness like literally in all of
2288.48s: that because
2289.76s: one of my my biggest heartaches is a lot
2292.24s: of these courses that are marketing
2296.08s: you know i always find it to be so
2297.84s: important to like work backwards from an
2300.16s: entity and understand the incentive if i
2303.20s: am a trading course what is my larger
2306.16s: audience treating like
2308.64s: preaching a really hard long process to
2312.24s: be profitable or
2314.00s: this two simple strategies that works 80
2316.72s: of the time right right you know what i
2318.88s: mean it's like it's inherent in the way
2321.44s: that the marketing works and
2323.44s: that's actually i've started a bit of a
2325.76s: crusade against win rate and everybody
2329.20s: wants to talk about win rate and
2330.48s: probability of profit which i like but
2333.68s: it's something that my mentor actually
2335.28s: drilled into my head early on is
2336.72s: expectancy expectancy you can have a
2340.24s: very low win rate not very low you still
2342.64s: have to win sometimes but you can have a
2344.40s: low relatively low win rate but still be
2346.80s: profitable it's an extreme example but
2349.12s: the point being there's two parts to
2351.52s: this equation that matter you can also
2353.44s: have a 95 win rate that's not profitable
2356.96s: and that like
2358.16s: that doesn't sell well you know even the
2360.08s: idea of exposing that's an interesting
2362.48s: thing that came out of so like in i i
2365.36s: started keeping real data all the time
2367.44s: after i read this book by um ken grant
2370.24s: called uh trading risk
2372.64s: one of the few like really good risk
2374.64s: management books but um so i had already
2377.20s: been trading for like 10 years at that
2378.72s: point and i never had kept data before
2380.88s: and that was one thing that really
2382.00s: surprised me was i was keeping data
2384.56s: mostly most of my data that i keep is
2386.40s: just daily like so i just keep track of
2388.08s: my like
2388.96s: up down high low of the day and all that
2391.60s: and my win rate is basically always
2394.00s: between like 50 and 53 percent
2397.12s: and then
2398.24s: my p l is all based on the ratio like is
2401.36s: it one point seven to one or like you
2403.44s: know in a really bad year it could be
2404.88s: like base you where you're flat it'd be
2406.64s: obviously one to one and fifty percent
2408.24s: kind of thing
2409.28s: but the thing that i that so like
2411.20s: there's the two levers like you said
2412.80s: right there's wind percentage and
2414.16s: there's the ratio of up to down
2416.80s: and i always found
2418.88s: any kind of tweaks and stuff that i did
2420.96s: very i could never really change my win
2422.88s: percentage the everything was always
2424.64s: more to do with
2426.00s: you know like running winners and and
2427.92s: just stops and all that all influences
2430.56s: this thing but
2431.84s: win percentage is just like
2434.48s: your edge and your edge is like
2438.48s: kind of goes up and down but doesn't go
2439.92s: up and down all that much the edge comes
2441.92s: from
2442.72s: uh or your your prediction capability or
2445.12s: whatever your edge correct um from
2447.12s: monetizing the good ideas and getting
2449.36s: out of the bad ideas i know that's kind
2450.96s: of like it's a truism it's kind of like
2453.60s: mathematical common sense but it's
2455.76s: interesting to see it because like i
2457.12s: think i would have guessed probably
2458.56s: because like everyone else probably
2460.24s: overestimates their skill as well i
2462.48s: probably would have guessed my win rate
2464.16s: was like 60 or something and then
2466.24s: knowing it was only 50 and how stable it
2468.56s: was after year after year after like
2470.08s: five years i'm like my win percentage
2472.40s: doesn't even move basically and some
2474.08s: years i'm making tons in one year i was
2475.84s: flat
2476.72s: um so i found that really interesting
2479.04s: and then you know kind of changes your
2480.72s: focus a little bit on like where do you
2482.24s: want to put your energy
2483.68s: um
2484.64s: and obviously the energy should be
2486.40s: devoted and more like
2488.08s: not cutting too early and and
2490.40s: things like that you know
2492.00s: yeah i'm kind of a big nerd when it
2494.08s: comes to reading white papers and
2496.16s: studies on retail trading and like
2498.48s: barbara and odin they do a bunch
2501.04s: um so i read their stuff all the time
2503.60s: they're from um berkeley and they do you
2506.32s: know just all different kinds of studies
2508.00s: and
2508.64s: one of the really normal effects for
2511.04s: retail traders is we tend to let losers
2514.08s: run and we cut winners too short and i
2517.44s: think that feeds right into
2519.36s: kind of the broader conversation around
2521.20s: why high win rates are so appealing is
2524.32s: there's just there's a lot of ego
2526.16s: involved in this space for a lot of
2527.84s: people until they learn that like ego
2530.08s: loses money as soon as like i feel like
2532.40s: a retail trader gets to that conclusion
2535.12s: you're so much better off but early on
2538.16s: you know you don't want to admit you're
2539.44s: wrong and when you do have a trade
2541.52s: that's winning even if it's just a
2542.96s: little bit that's a winner that feels
2544.40s: good yeah you're like sweet yeah we want
2546.96s: to take that down but then there goes
2548.48s: expectancy you know letting losers run
2550.64s: cutting winners short equals
2552.88s: negative expectancy yeah um
2555.92s: so we have about 10 minutes left and we
2558.32s: we were this is like literally the same
2560.24s: conversation but i do want to get your
2562.32s: like explicit thoughts on it when we're
2564.72s: thinking about the risk to reward
2566.80s: spectrum for retail traders before you
2569.44s: know we were discussing that there's a
2570.80s: you know a bit of a scale and it's
2572.72s: important to figure out where we are on
2574.72s: that scale as individuals there's kind
2576.64s: of two questions i have for you for
2578.64s: retail traders that are watching this
2580.32s: how
2581.36s: would they best determine where on that
2584.16s: scale they are
2585.92s: and then based on where they are in that
2588.32s: scale what kind of adjustments would you
2590.32s: be making if you were in their shoes
2592.08s: let's say if they're
2593.52s: um low risk low return high risk high
2595.52s: return and then in the middle you know
2597.20s: just for like some perspective ideas
2599.44s: so i think
2600.80s: interestingly um well i hope um the this
2604.56s: sort of the solutions for
2608.32s: um
2609.44s: both ends of the spectrum
2611.68s: are really about
2613.44s: having some kind of rules-based approach
2616.08s: that is consistent and the good thing
2619.20s: about having rules too is that you know
2621.36s: like if you
2622.72s: if you're doing well
2624.72s: it makes it less likely that it's luck
2627.28s: um because it's repeatable right you're
2629.12s: not just like coming in and hitting
2630.40s: buttons and like oh i made money six
2632.00s: days in a row well it doesn't really
2633.68s: mean anything because you might blow up
2635.12s: on on day seven but if you have like a
2637.44s: systematic approach
2639.04s: so i think in general whether you're
2640.96s: like the
2642.40s: the i know the first part of the
2643.68s: question was like how do you know i
2645.60s: think most people just know like i think
2647.76s: in general
2649.76s: you know if you first of all
2652.16s: you need to know
2653.76s: basically what your risk management
2655.52s: strategy is like what percentage of
2657.52s: capital are you risking on your trades
2659.36s: and and that kind of stuff like you need
2661.36s: a basic here's my framework and here's
2663.28s: my spreadsheet and if i lose money 10
2665.84s: days in a row
2667.28s: here's what's going to happen i think
2669.36s: everyone has to have that
2671.12s: and then the question just becomes like
2674.00s: are you pushing against the edge of that
2675.68s: every single day
2677.12s: um or are you like say you're
2679.52s: like just for whatever just pick
2681.12s: whatever number but like say your max
2682.88s: loss
2684.16s: let's say at a bank so you say i have a
2685.76s: trader that's working for me and she's
2687.68s: not supposed to lose more than 50 grand
2689.28s: a day and she's losing like 15
2692.64s: and then 9
2694.16s: and 16 and stuff then i'm like okay dude
2696.72s: you're not like you should be hitting
2698.00s: your limit once in a while very rarely
2699.84s: but you should be hitting it
2701.52s: um and then the other person is like
2704.40s: hitting it four times a week that's
2706.16s: obviously the other the other extreme so
2708.72s: i think what you do is like you
2710.80s: establish your bound your boundaries
2713.28s: right whatever like my max loss
2715.68s: um like you know what my good day is
2718.48s: going to be relative to my bad day
2720.56s: and then you start to see like how often
2722.56s: am i testing that and like if you have
2725.12s: say like a retail trader and
2727.36s: again i don't want to get into the
2728.88s: nuances of like percent of risk per
2731.52s: trade and all that it's just such a long
2733.12s: conversation but let's just say let's
2734.88s: say you have 100 grand in your account
2736.72s: and every trade you do you're risking
2738.24s: two grand that's like a simple
2739.52s: methodology sure then if you're losing
2742.80s: four grand once a week
2744.88s: like obviously that's a risk management
2746.88s: problem but if you're losing like 800
2749.68s: 600 and 200
2751.68s: and like you know barely ever losing
2753.52s: more than a thousand
2755.20s: then you're probably not maximizing like
2757.12s: and you're doing okay you're probably
2758.72s: not maximizing your your upside because
2760.88s: you're not
2761.84s: you're not touching the guardrails at
2764.00s: all so like i think having like a really
2766.00s: clear idea in your mind okay these are
2768.40s: this is what like if i'm doing well this
2770.64s: is what it's going to look like
2772.32s: and you can do simulations and stuff
2774.56s: like that too like i've changed capital
2777.04s: amounts like crazy like i you know i was
2779.04s: trading my own money i was trading a
2780.56s: hedge fund with like hundreds of million
2781.92s: dollar of millions of dollars and then
2783.60s: at a bank where
2784.96s: different banks have different risk
2786.32s: tolerances so i've had like wildly
2788.56s: different amounts of risk so each time i
2791.76s: kind of always establish like okay
2794.56s: like a bad day is this a good day is
2796.64s: this max bad day is this and then on a
2799.20s: weekly monthly basis kind of looks like
2801.20s: this and i know i make money like 50 of
2803.84s: days and you can start to build little
2806.08s: spreadsheets that kind of do like
2807.92s: simulations
2809.28s: and then kind of get an idea of like
2811.12s: okay
2812.00s: you know also reverse engineering
2814.16s: targets and reverse engineering like
2816.24s: okay i'm bankrupt if this happens
2818.48s: um you can start to get an idea of your
2820.72s: like daily guard rails and and weekly
2824.16s: and i think what you want to do is
2826.00s: occasionally be testing those bounds on
2828.08s: the really when you have a really bad
2829.60s: run you should be getting close to
2831.52s: whatever that like worst case for that
2834.00s: say your weekly loss limit is um
2837.28s: and then
2838.24s: to me though it's all about rules so
2840.24s: like whether you work at a bank or for
2842.00s: yourself or whatever to me the scary
2844.32s: times for me have always been when i'm
2846.08s: not following my own rules because then
2848.16s: you don't really know what's going to
2849.44s: happen because you're you're the one
2850.88s: pushing the buttons and you don't even
2852.32s: know if you're going to stop or not to
2854.08s: me that's like being in that position is
2856.32s: scary
2857.52s: um
2858.56s: and to avoid that what i've always done
2860.80s: like for many years is every time i put
2863.04s: a position on because my like i was
2864.56s: saying at the start um like my
2866.72s: self-control discipline has never been
2868.56s: that great
2869.68s: is i automate everything so like you
2871.92s: know i buy 10 million euros
2874.16s: as soon as i do that i just put a stop
2876.16s: lot wherever my stop is i put it on a
2878.24s: computer because like in fx you can
2879.68s: automate everything and most yeah you
2881.76s: can yeah and i i usually always almost
2884.32s: always put my take profit as well
2886.64s: and then i try my hardest to not touch
2889.60s: it and you know and i i'm pretty good
2892.56s: now because a lot more steps are
2894.88s: required to like actively cancel a stop
2897.44s: move it down and all that but what if
2899.52s: you don't have it automated it's it
2901.44s: doesn't require that much effort to go
2903.12s: oh i was that 90 let me just move i'll
2905.52s: i'll stop out at 80. you know it looks
2907.52s: kind of big here i'll just wait till it
2909.04s: gets to 70. and then all of a sudden
2911.04s: like you're selling at 52 on the yeah
2913.68s: so
2914.64s: um whereas if you have a thing in a
2916.64s: system
2917.68s: to go in and actually change it requires
2919.92s: a lot more active engagement so
2922.64s: um
2923.60s: yeah so all of that to say i think like
2926.08s: you develop your kind of like range
2928.56s: hopefully you're touching both sides of
2930.00s: that range occasionally
2932.00s: um and like you have a good
2933.68s: understanding of what your standard
2934.72s: deviation is in that range
2936.56s: and then
2937.76s: it's all rules based and there's no like
2941.44s: there's no oops factor because
2943.12s: everything you're doing has like a
2944.72s: pretty simple set of rules and there's a
2946.32s: spreadsheet and yeah
2948.24s: formatting like for when you break your
2950.32s: limit it turns red and you don't have
2952.24s: too many red cells on the spreadsheet
2955.44s: yeah i i love that it's actually one of
2957.84s: the things i'm doing with that teaching
2959.36s: to trade segment right now is is having
2961.84s: conversations with them about creating
2963.44s: those rules that's actually a fun
2965.44s: follow-on obviously we don't have time
2967.12s: to discuss it too far in this this call
2969.28s: i'd love to talk to you another time
2970.40s: about it though because i find for newer
2972.64s: traders
2973.84s: um especially the four that i'm working
2975.76s: with right now they have a hard time
2978.64s: um well let's take a step back most
2980.64s: retail traders have no rules for
2982.40s: themselves it's lord of the flies
2984.64s: so for the smaller subset that does
2987.20s: acknowledge that rules are helpful
2989.28s: structure serves them well it gives them
2991.28s: something to make adjustments off of in
2993.52s: a quantitative manner some of them have
2995.92s: a hard time even understanding where to
2998.08s: make a rule right if you don't know what
3000.00s: you don't know and that's actually what
3002.00s: i'm working a lot with them on right now
3004.64s: um so like i said definitely would be
3006.40s: fun to pick your brain on that in in the
3008.24s: future but i think one of the most
3010.16s: important things that i really want to
3011.44s: echo that you mentioned is
3013.36s: you know as we were talking about the
3014.72s: this risk to reward spectrum you were
3016.72s: talking about having some spreadsheets
3019.44s: that you can review and i think that's
3023.12s: for most people have a hard time
3024.56s: understanding the right risk and reward
3026.08s: for themselves that's the first place to
3027.52s: start is logging having data to look at
3030.72s: because otherwise how could you possibly
3032.96s: make any decisions
3034.48s: and so like i don't i don't mean to make
3036.56s: this sound like super complex either
3039.28s: essentially it's it's not like what i do
3041.68s: isn't very complicated it's just
3043.84s: basic i think the the number one reason
3047.12s: you have to have some rules about like
3049.60s: max daily loss and all that
3051.68s: is that you're gonna blow up otherwise
3053.60s: like you know eventually
3055.60s: you you know you take your account from
3057.68s: 30 grand to 200 grand
3060.00s: and like i saw people do this and you
3062.72s: don't have any guard rails and you go
3065.20s: from 200 to 100 and then you're like oh
3067.76s: well like now
3069.20s: like i've already lost 100 i might as
3070.80s: well just let it ride and then all of a
3072.48s: sudden you're like you owe the firm 28
3074.64s: grand because you busted your margin or
3076.56s: whatever so like
3078.80s: and also it gives you um control of your
3081.52s: drawdown so that like you don't go from
3083.60s: 30k to 200k to 30k because that's
3086.16s: obviously a common pattern as well
3088.24s: is that like you really shouldn't be
3090.08s: drawing down
3091.36s: you know whatever that is
3093.28s: 86 percent of your of your capital
3096.96s: yeah at any time um so just having like
3100.08s: a super basic rule of like
3102.32s: you know ten percent from peak i cut or
3104.16s: whatever like any and basically one rule
3106.72s: that's going to stop you from blowing up
3108.96s: is like the starting point and then you
3110.88s: can layer on more a little bit more
3112.32s: complexity but um
3114.56s: there's there's a lot of interesting
3115.84s: things like i i know it's kind of time
3117.44s: to go but like even keeping the track of
3120.16s: your high and low like if you're kind of
3121.68s: like an intraday trader um your time
3124.16s: horizon this might not work but for
3125.76s: people that are trading more like
3126.80s: intraday just keeping track of your low
3128.88s: of day and high of day sometimes you
3130.80s: might notice like oh i whenever i get to
3132.88s: two grand i always like the bed and
3135.52s: end up flat you know and there's a lot
3137.60s: of people have that as well like yeah
3139.84s: because they think they have house money
3141.84s: yeah so it's house money effect and then
3144.16s: it's also partly
3146.08s: um a mathematic i've noticed this in fx
3149.28s: it's a mathematical output of how big
3151.92s: your positions are and how volatile the
3153.84s: instrument that you trade is
3155.68s: is that if you you know if you're taking
3157.52s: 10 million dollar positions and your
3159.52s: thing moves one percent a day
3161.60s: you're going to start to notice like
3162.80s: whenever you're up 100 grand that you
3164.88s: tend to peek out because your product
3166.88s: mean reverts at that point and so your p
3169.28s: l is showing you that um so anyways
3172.08s: there's a lot of ways you can you can
3173.68s: extract information from the data um but
3176.24s: like just keeping a simple open high low
3178.16s: close of your p l i think is like a
3180.64s: super easy way to start
3183.04s: i love that and that's literally a
3184.80s: perfect note to end on i think that's a
3186.48s: great great piece of advice so um first
3189.28s: off on behalf of you know myself and
3191.28s: everybody else that's watching this
3192.32s: thank you you know for taking some time
3193.84s: to
3194.56s: you know just with me talk
3195.92s: about trading a little bit i always find
3198.32s: these conversations i enjoy them i get
3200.24s: to learn and i think that a lot of other
3202.32s: people get to pick up you know different
3203.84s: skills here and there so thank you for
3205.44s: sharing some of your experience with us
3207.20s: you're welcome yeah i'm happy to do it
3209.20s: awesome brother well love to have you on
3210.80s: again in the future and until next time
3213.52s: we'll see you later all right
