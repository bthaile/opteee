0.00s: What's up gang? Today we're talking about zero DTE SPX options trading specifically in 2023 because
9.44s: this year's been kind of interesting. I'll be honest with you. I take a look at data pretty much
13.68s: every day with regards to trading and there are some anomalies this year that I picked up on and
19.52s: I actually pivoted what I was doing mid-year because of that. So the goal of this video is to walk
25.28s: through two things. The first thing is kind of what happened with the trading side of stuff and
29.84s: then the second part is to walk you through a little bit of this concept of being able to pivot.
34.88s: This is one of the reasons why a lot of traders in my opinion fail that become too systematic because
41.68s: you try to execute the same exact way every single time without fail and sometimes markets change.
48.48s: What we did before might not work now and that's the point. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome
53.92s: back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible
58.40s: for everybody else. So if what I do helps you in any way consider signing up. All right so let's
63.76s: start with what didn't work. What I'm showing you here is a back test from my friends over at
70.88s: Options Omega. I am affiliated with them. This isn't a promoted video by them. This is just me
75.52s: using the platform because I think it's usable for you folks. So the details to signing up for them
81.76s: for 50% off are in the notes below for those interested but this is an easy way to summarize a lot
86.96s: of information. This is going to be a mix of their information and then my own trade data that I track.
92.00s: So here I was looking at 2015 and I was using two days of expiration because daily
98.32s: expiration weren't launched then and I was looking at 50 delta short straddles worked which is
104.96s: really to capture variance risk premiums for those that are unaware a short straddle simply looks
110.48s: like this. It's a short option both call and put that share the same strike price typically trying
117.44s: to get rid of 50 delta and the whole premise of this trade is to capture variance risk premiums
123.20s: which I have a standalone video that walks through what those are in detail a link to them in the
128.32s: notes below but in the meantime for a quick refresh variance risk premiums is simply the tendency
134.16s: for implied volatility which is the yellow lines in this graph down here that I'm highlighting
138.56s: pens to trend over realize volatility which are the white lines that you see here and you can see
144.40s: in general the yellow line is above the white line that's variance risk premiums and it's a sort
150.80s: of systematic alpha it's actually one of the best possible things retail traders can expose
155.12s: themselves to because it is really persistent okay so that is the short straddle why the short straddle
162.32s: because this is kind of a more pure play on variance risk premiums compared to something like this
168.64s: now this is looking at the same time frame but looking at a 20 delta two-days expiration short
174.88s: strangle and this is from the same exact time frame the idea here is if you look at the P&L for
180.08s: these two different positions the short straddle performed much better it came out like 700 dollars
185.68s: ahead I was just using essentially one lot for each of these trades but you can see that in general
192.48s: the straddle performed better and this was back in 2015 so to give you some context let's take a
198.16s: look at the chart over here this is one 2015 kicked off notice how relative to what we're seeing
204.80s: now kind of flat there's really not a whole lot going on here until towards the end of the year
210.08s: which we did start to see some volatility it's actually why these strategies didn't do super great
214.48s: because of this period here but in general the daily movements were not that big and that's
220.56s: an important detail especially if you look at that compared to what we see now the daily movements
226.48s: are much larger in general just for reference this is using a weekly aggregation but still you can
232.80s: see that they're much larger in scale so why does all of this matter what what didn't work is what
239.12s: did work for a long time I'm sorry I'm confused which is just selling the short straddles so now I
245.20s: want to walk you through what did actually work and then most importantly how I actually did
251.52s: trading what I do because there is a slight difference between the data you're about to see
256.80s: and what I did so this is looking at one lots looking at this year only 2023 and it's looking at
263.68s: one January to 10 November and you'll see there's a bunch of different permutations up here the way
268.80s: you can think about this is that the different columns are different combinations of the strategies
274.80s: we have the delta's so this is looking at a 15 delta 20 delta 30 delta 50 delta for calls and
281.52s: puts so this entire study is looking at straddles or strangles straddles are the 50 delta anything
287.76s: other than that are strangles now these two rows here max profit max loss this is showing if there
294.40s: is any max profit management applied or max loss management so kind of for these first four columns
301.36s: notice how there's no max profit no max loss management and then at the next sets of columns I
307.28s: start to introduce max loss management and that's because I talked about this a little bit earlier
311.60s: in the year but I already started to catch wind that things were changing so I was testing different
317.28s: things now this is essentially how it all played out what worked the best from a back testing
324.00s: perspective was 20 delta short call short put so short strangle managed at a 300 percent max loss
331.84s: there's a really really really interesting piece that comes with this notice how if we look at
337.76s: something like the 20 delta strangle with no loss management there's 154 winning positions now
346.00s: if we apply a 250 percent loss management there is now 149 if we look at a 300 percent loss management
352.96s: 152 and then 153 winning trades the reason why this matters is because we do not want to get
360.64s: stopped out prematurely which is what happened in this 250 percent scenario this means that there
366.24s: were trades that went outside of our loss management band that actually came back in now fortunately
373.20s: that's actually not that big of a difference and that's why this worked so well this year notice how
379.44s: the max winners if no no management was applied was 154 so what this means is that there's only five
385.36s: trades that you artificially cut out and in this case there's only two trades notice though the change
393.28s: in the max loss this is why it all comes together because the max loss in this trade went from 5,623
401.04s: bucks and it dropped down to 3360 big change in max loss this is the exact thing that I'm talking
409.12s: about when I'm saying cut off the tails because if we take a look at a bell curve imagine that each
416.24s: individual trade here is a dot and this represents the distribution of those dots what we're doing by
422.40s: cutting off the tails is we are managing this loss we're taking away these really large losing trades
430.88s: and it drastically increases our wind potential which is exactly the point here so what did I actually
438.08s: do here it is from the middle of the year is about 22 May is when I made this pivot and I ran this
445.36s: I typically run the strategy almost always so in this case I ran 20 delta short strangles managed
453.68s: at a 300% max loss now instead of a one lot I typically trade five lots so that's why you'll see
460.48s: these numbers look quite different however the things I want to hone in on is the total number of
464.80s: trades I had was 121 with 89 winning trades so I did still have some pretty serious large losses
473.68s: that occurred relatively infrequently but still enough that it hurts the profitability of the
478.80s: position so I did take a look at this study to see okay well if I'm doing this 20 delta strangle
485.12s: what if I either decrease or increase the max loss potential and this is actually still the sweet
491.44s: spot it's just a function of trading this kind of thing so I actually walked out up about $6,000
496.72s: so far in the year so as long as I don't throw it all away it's a pretty good year the main thing I
500.96s: want you guys to take away from this is you might have your typical way of deploying which is great
505.44s: however you have to stay sensitive to the current market conditions because what worked before
510.48s: doesn't always continue to work in the future and it's a continual system of optimization
514.96s: that's all based on what a good trading log
519.04s: it's beautiful
529.28s: if you are tracking all of this detail you can come across like I did earlier in the year when
535.04s: something didn't look right compared to what it looked like when it was working and I knew it was
539.52s: time to try something else if any questions comments concerns as always drop me a line
544.16s: throw it in the comments below be an outlier see you guys later
