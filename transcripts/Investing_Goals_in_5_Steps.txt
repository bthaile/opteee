0.00s: let's talk about how to create investing
1.74s: goals this is probably one of the most
3.54s: overlooked aspects that all Traders just
6.06s: dismiss I did the same exact thing early
8.40s: on and it's a giant mistake because you
10.98s: do not realize how powerful it is to
13.44s: even take a few hours to create a
15.12s: roadmap so we're going to do exactly
16.32s: that right now what's up everybody Eric
17.88s: here welcome back to all outliers a big
19.80s: shout out to the YouTube members and the
21.30s: patreon folks if you're interested in
22.92s: joining and supporting you can find the
24.36s: links in the description below and with
26.16s: that let's get right to it so the very
27.48s: first thing there's gonna be five steps
28.92s: here and at the end the fifth step is
30.72s: going to walk us through some of the
32.10s: best practices that I've learned both
33.90s: from my personal experience but then
36.00s: also observing other people in their
38.28s: natural habitat working on these kinds
39.96s: of things so the very first one is one I
42.06s: reference all the time this is from
43.50s: Stephen covey's Seven Habits of Highly
45.78s: Successful People begin with the end in
47.64s: mind this is in the Marine Corps what we
49.62s: would call the desired end State what
52.02s: are we trying to do and most commonly
54.60s: it's some derivative of this replace my
57.78s: income people attempt to use invest
59.94s: testing and trading as a source of
62.04s: income so that they do not or not forced
64.50s: to work at a nine to five regular job
66.60s: okay got that one pretty easy The Next
68.94s: Step
71.46s: s eight replacing our income and we need
73.50s: to project it out in time and then we
75.18s: need to quantify things so these are the
76.98s: questions you have to ask yourself when
78.90s: are you attempting to replace your
80.88s: income with your investing income how
82.98s: much is your current income AKA how much
85.50s: investing income do you need what are
87.18s: your expenses and what are your margins
88.80s: this isn't necessarily used directly in
90.96s: these formulas I'm going to share in a
92.40s: little bit but it is more going to be a
94.50s: thing we want to track because that's
95.94s: going to be one of the the most
97.32s: impactful early levers you can pull on
99.78s: to get your desired outcome and then the
101.82s: last one is your future income
103.80s: preferences this one is super important
106.80s: because a lot of people when they're
108.72s: talking about this kind of planning they
110.82s: tend to be super super conservative
112.92s: they'll say things like oh I just want
115.38s: this or I just want that and maybe you
118.38s: do but maybe you don't who's to say that
121.02s: the right retirement for you is just
123.18s: Bare Bones as little as you possibly
125.40s: need but then you can't take vacations
127.02s: you can't buy that car that you
128.94s: want to get for me I definitely am far
131.22s: more interested in that fire financial
133.64s: Independence rep retire early is the
136.56s: Fire part but fat means you have a lot
138.66s: of money it means you get to do things
140.34s: so that's the very first juncture you're
142.56s: going to run up to here do you want to
144.30s: be fat meaning have a lot of money if so
146.70s: there's obviously burdens that come with
148.74s: that you're gonna have to figure out how
149.70s: to make more money save more money and
151.14s: you're probably gonna have a slightly
152.10s: longer Runway unless you hit it big
153.42s: which is okay but you have to identify
155.34s: truly for yourself what kind of
157.44s: retirement you prefer if it's a what we
160.38s: would call a moon fire exactly what it
162.72s: sounds like it's essentially Financial
163.92s: Independence retire early but lean you
166.38s: do it by cutting costs living a Frugal
168.36s: life and a lot of people are super
169.74s: fulfilled in doing that you got to pick
171.24s: what's right for you I definitely prefer
173.10s: fat fire but plenty of people do and
175.14s: live completely fulfilled lives on lean
177.42s: fire you got to figure out what this is
179.34s: because it's a huge planning Factor okay
181.38s: so we got the first two steps what is
183.30s: the current state in the Marine Corps we
185.64s: would call this the orientation we want
187.74s: to know where we're at right now so
189.18s: what's your liquid net worth this is a
191.10s: super super important question because
192.78s: this essentially becomes your investable
195.42s: income this is your principle that we
197.58s: can invest so when I'm thinking about
199.32s: liquid net worth I'm talking about money
201.42s: you can invest not all of the cash you
203.70s: have because you're going to want some
205.08s: of that emergency expenses and things
206.88s: like that so liquid net worth in this
209.16s: context I'm referring to the principle
211.38s: that you can invest next is your income
213.60s: because this is going to tie into this
216.12s: later on AKA how much do you make now
218.46s: how can we grow that and how much of it
220.44s: can we keep and then the last one this
222.06s: is another source of income for Traders
223.80s: which is your investing performance in
225.90s: my opinion I think you need to have at
227.94s: the very bare minimum Ultra minimum a
230.64s: five-year Runway of how you've done over
233.10s: the past five years with the objective
234.90s: being that in the more recent years on
237.00s: that that you're starting to get more
238.80s: consistent that part is super important
240.78s: because if you have a five-year trading
242.40s: history and it's all over the place you
244.38s: can't really plan off of that so that's
246.48s: why having a five-year minimum and if
249.00s: you get out of the gate running well
250.38s: your first year is whatever ever second
252.00s: year you're starting to get your feet
253.14s: under you and then the next three years
254.64s: are pretty bang on The Mark with what
256.32s: you're trying to do perfect most people
257.94s: it's going to be more than that but the
259.32s: reason why I say five year minimum is
260.76s: because it typically will give you
262.08s: enough looks at different markets to
264.24s: have a pretty fair idea but one of the
265.86s: things is if you are going through your
267.84s: planning cycle and let's say you did it
269.94s: in 2012 when we went through literally a
272.10s: 10-year bull market that's kind of
273.78s: difficult because you don't know how
274.92s: you're going to fare in a bear Market
276.12s: but that leads into some of our future
278.04s: points so this is the variance that I
280.20s: was just referring to and then the
281.46s: confidence interval this is important
283.08s: this tells you how confident you are in
285.42s: this as your future potential a lot of
287.64s: people when we're talking online or when
289.38s: we're talking to other people we like to
291.66s: bound more confident than we might
293.76s: actually be be honest here how confident
296.04s: are you in this because literally quite
298.38s: literally your future depends on it so
300.66s: now we understand our current state
302.46s: let's talk about a road map so what this
304.44s: is I'm literally going to walk you
305.58s: through an example so let's say that we
308.16s: want to retire in 10 years let's say
310.74s: that we want two hundred thousand
312.72s: dollars per year this is more of like a
315.18s: mid fire slash lean fire if you're in a
317.70s: High Cost of Living City but you know
319.32s: this can be adjusted to whatever you
321.60s: want I'm just using numbers so that's
323.94s: why these are like 10 200 200 1000 these
327.66s: are very easy for you to adjust to your
329.52s: current scenario so let's say we want
331.32s: 200 000 per year post taxes our current
334.20s: net worth is two hundred thousand
335.88s: dollars and your savings rate is one
337.32s: thousand dollars a month I will tell you
338.70s: right out of the gate that's way too low
339.90s: of a savings rate but I'm just throwing
341.22s: something out there based on these
342.36s: numbers at least okay so let's take a
343.98s: look at this scenario let's say that
345.54s: you're a Trader with at least five years
346.92s: of experience and in those five years
348.66s: you're averaging your compound annual
350.70s: growth rate is around 20 per year it
352.62s: means you're doing great so this is the
354.90s: growth phase of our account and then
357.30s: there's a maintenance phase the reason
359.10s: why I differentiate between these two is
361.32s: because I do not personally want to have
364.74s: to maintain essentially my Top Line
366.90s: performance into perpetuity in order to
369.24s: live off of it it's a very stressful way
370.92s: to do things so the way that I think
372.84s: about it is we have a growth phase where
374.34s: we're more aggressive more on top of it
375.90s: but then we ease off the gas once we
378.00s: start getting closer to our metric so
379.44s: that we can actually chill the out
381.00s: a little bit enjoy the stuff that we're
382.74s: working on so think of it this way
384.30s: growth phase is what gets you to your
386.04s: maintenance phase maintenance phase is
387.60s: supposed to be a little bit easier and
388.98s: more reliable for you to hit all right
390.60s: so back over to this as you can see at a
392.88s: 20 growth rate with this information
394.62s: you're gonna have 1.55 million and 10
397.80s: years does this get you to your 10 at 10
401.52s: maintenance does this get you to your
403.26s: 200 000 no it gets you to 150 000 so we
406.86s: are short this is not what we're looking
408.78s: for so in this case we have to figure
410.52s: out how to fix this thing because we
412.50s: want to make sure that we are again on
415.20s: target so in this case we have three
417.96s: things that we could take a look at and
419.70s: they're right here we can look at our
421.14s: savings rate we can look at the time
422.58s: frame we can look at our rate of return
424.68s: and my overall way to approach this is
428.10s: to use all of them you don't have to
429.84s: just pick one I certainly wouldn't if it
432.24s: were me so let's talk about how we can
434.22s: use these different levers if we change
436.26s: our savings rate if we're able to
438.24s: increase our savings rate from one
440.58s: thousand dollars to two thousand five
442.62s: hundred dollars per month that gets you
444.30s: to your two million everything else
445.80s: being the same ceterus paribus or you
448.50s: can look at the time frame if we instead
450.42s: keep the same performance but instead of
452.46s: this 10 years to retire we move to 12
454.62s: years that gets you to 2.26 million
457.38s: you've met Your Mark or you can play
459.36s: with your return so let's say if you can
461.82s: go from 20 return to 23 return that gets
464.94s: you to 1.95 million again in this time
467.70s: frame now really important note this is
470.04s: all pre-tax a lot of this will depend on
471.90s: the rest of your tax footprint but the
473.58s: point I'm showing you is based on these
476.04s: three inputs you will affect the outcome
479.40s: up here which is exactly what we're
482.22s: trying to do so think of what of these
484.92s: you can adjust and how aggressively you
486.84s: can adjust it maybe instead of going
488.22s: from 1K savings you go to 2K but then
490.50s: you go from 10 years to 11 years maybe
492.78s: that's fine for you there's a million
494.34s: different ways you can do this but it's
495.84s: all going to be based on your current
497.46s: performance what you're able to maintain
499.62s: into perpetuity and then how much slack
502.32s: you're giving yourself in terms of your
503.64s: time frame all right I want to talk now
505.26s: about some of the best practices you got
508.32s: to start with what you have what this
509.58s: means is most people they are scared to
512.82s: start even the conversation of this
515.58s: because they don't know these variables
517.14s: they haven't thought about it they don't
518.28s: even know where to start we're actually
519.54s: having this dialogue in my free outlier
521.88s: Discord right now so you can hop in
523.86s: there the link is in the show notes
525.30s: below like I said it's free but this is
527.34s: an important thing is just start just
529.02s: start with something because just like a
530.94s: trading plan just like a trading log if
532.86s: you start the process of writing this
534.78s: stuff down you will start to at least
537.24s: get something going and then you can
539.22s: move it forward from there so just start
541.08s: with what you have think about your
542.58s: current savings that's fine and then
544.08s: move from there this is I cannot over
546.66s: emphasize this you have to be honest
548.46s: with yourself when you're looking at
549.60s: these things there's probably going to
550.74s: be some stuff you're not comfortable
552.24s: with because to be completely honest
554.10s: this is why most people don't do it is
556.26s: because they don't like the answer that
557.76s: they think they're gonna see AKA if you
559.68s: looked at all that and you're like damn
560.76s: I'm gonna have to do this for 30 years
562.74s: yeah that sucks but the only way to
564.72s: affect it is to acknowledge it exists
567.30s: and then do something about it so you
569.04s: got to be honest when we're talking
570.24s: about these different return potentials
572.40s: um in this scenario it is extremely
574.26s: important to be conservative I cannot
576.12s: over emphasize that so if you think you
578.76s: could scrape by maybe you know taking
581.82s: the bike to work a few weeks instead of
584.34s: you know driving to get you to a higher
586.62s: savings rate maybe that's not super
588.54s: conservative and highly fallible be
591.18s: conservative in your numbers and be
592.68s: realistic so this is probably one of the
595.50s: next most slept on aspects here which is
598.02s: once we've defined what we're trying to
600.36s: do is to break this out into our
603.90s: tracking metrics because we have our
605.88s: 10-year goal that's what we just created
607.98s: so then if we think logically that means
610.56s: 5 years down the line we should be
612.48s: halfway to that goal so what does that
614.64s: mean it means each year each month we
616.68s: need to be in pursuit of this five-year
619.02s: and this 10-year goal which if we did a
621.30s: good job planning them conservatively we
623.40s: should be ahead of pace typically which
625.74s: is good that's what we want because
627.24s: guess what life is going to happen
629.52s: is going to happen that's going to set
630.84s: you back it's how it goes so think about
632.64s: these different metrics that support
635.28s: that those longer term metrics early on
638.22s: as I mentioned before this is your
640.50s: biggest lever this is the easiest thing
642.00s: you could do is save money so instead of
644.82s: trying to move from a 20 return to a 23
648.30s: return which might be really
650.82s: hard an easier thing would be just save
653.22s: an extra 200 a month and those kinds of
655.68s: changes are massive so think about
657.78s: saving first but you can only save so
660.84s: much you can only cut so many expenses
663.18s: what I mean by Saving increasing your
664.86s: savings margins you can only cut so many
666.78s: expenses you still need to eat you still
668.40s: need to do what you got to do so this is
670.56s: a immediately your second priority once
673.32s: you get to a good savings place is more
675.66s: income whether it's side hustles whether
677.64s: it's creating another side business
679.50s: whatever you have to do to start
681.12s: creating more income it's got to happen
682.80s: and it's got to happen as fast as
684.42s: humanly possible because this increases
687.12s: our savings margins that's the whole
688.92s: point and then the last thing here Loop
690.60s: and CPI ooda Loop sounds really weird
692.82s: this is actually from um a book that a
695.58s: lot of marine officers have to read and
697.38s: it's a decision cycle of a fighter pilot
699.54s: and you can look it up but essentially
701.52s: what I'm referring to here is this is
703.62s: observe Orient decide act this means
706.20s: this is a Perpetual review of where you
709.26s: currently are in this process and then
711.30s: what needs to happen to get you there
712.68s: because let's say for a couple months
714.42s: you're slightly behind Pace but at the
716.10s: end of the year you're above Pace well
718.08s: that's great maybe you can ease down
720.12s: your return targets maybe you can ease
722.16s: some of the savings so you can spend and
723.60s: enjoy now a little more or maybe you can
725.40s: accelerate your time frame but this is a
727.26s: perpetually
728.34s: um adjusted process and then the last
730.26s: thing here is CPI continual process or
733.02s: contiguous process improvements exactly
734.70s: what it sounds like these little things
736.50s: that none of this is complex this is why
738.96s: I like investing so much is because a
741.42s: neanderthal like myself can do this all
744.24s: you have to do is create a little bit of
746.70s: planning some metrics around that
748.80s: ultimate goal and then go for it but one
751.26s: of the worst possible things you could
752.64s: do is just think that life is going to
755.10s: Magic you there because you're going to
756.78s: look back after 20 years you're gonna
757.98s: say what the just happened and
759.60s: guess what those 20 years are going to
761.04s: be your best possible compounding years
763.44s: that exist so if this video is helpful
765.96s: like share it with other people that
767.70s: need to do this subscribe be an outlier
769.50s: I'll see you guys later
