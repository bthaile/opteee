0.00s: Everyone Eric here up next is a pretty fun topic, which is trading in your IRAs
5.96s: So let's jump over to the main screen and dig in so first off
10.04s: The very first thing I have on here is if you are
14.24s: Interested in setting up a Roth IRA
17.68s: Do yourself a favor and make sure you do it as soon as possible and max it out as
24.80s: Frequently as possible and here's the reason why I'm gonna pull up a quick overview that reviews Roth IRAs versus traditional
35.16s: So if you take a look traditional is on this side Roth is on this side same thing traditional is here and then
42.54s: Roth is over here and that's what the mouse so don't make fun of the handwriting anymore than we already need to
48.80s: most of it is gonna look pretty similar, but there is a very
55.96s: significant difference in income eligibility and that is right here
62.08s: So the reason why it's important to start in your Roth is soon as possible is
69.56s: once you hit 124k if you
72.52s: File single or
76.52s: 196 if you file jointly
80.00s: Once you hit those thresholds and you move over you cannot
84.68s: Contribute to the account anymore. So what happens is you can get stuck with a certain amount of money in that account and
93.44s: You're gonna essentially completely rely on your ability to develop the account or the accumulation of wealth in there so
101.52s: Big recommendation if you are gonna trade Roth IRAs start as soon as possible give yourself as much time to continue max it out
109.88s: Before you hopefully hit these thresholds. It's like I said once you hit there like I can't add any more to the account
116.60s: So it's stuck I can only trade what's in there and it is what it is now the good part is you can always have a traditional
123.76s: IRA which is nice
125.20s: So once you finish your time in your Roth or you can even have them both simultaneously
130.52s: You know you can still do the traditional now something to keep in mind is you're you're still gonna be limited on
138.12s: The amount you can apply to Roth. I mean sorry not Roth that you can apply to IRA accounts
146.00s: So keep that in mind don't start maxing out both because you're gonna find yourself in a bad spot
150.60s: You can you get up to that amount for IRAs in general not whether it's Roth or
158.16s: traditional
161.80s: So moving on to a couple I don't know I guess just quick overview of what I like to do a couple things
167.28s: first one is I
169.56s: Typically trade cash secured positions in there
172.88s: But there is a loophole which is interesting enough that it exists because it's for futures
179.76s: Which you know the idea of
182.16s: forcing people to not be able to trade on margin in a Roth account is
186.84s: Obviously for the security of the account to make sure that it's less volatile things like that kind of protect you again yourself
194.68s: Forces people until less volatile trading styles, but you can trade futures
199.72s: I can trade options on futures. I can sell naked calls on futures. Just can't do it with options
206.80s: No idea why it exists, but it is helpful to know that it is there in case you want to speculate in your IRA
213.72s: You most certainly can you just use futures
217.00s: Now something else to keep in mind is
219.80s: If slash when you do trade futures in your IRA it requires a
224.52s: 125% of standard margin so they're gonna
229.04s: Essentially force you to have more money that you would have to set aside for those trades than you would see
236.72s: And you know your standard margin account before you're margin so on so forth. So just keep that mind
242.16s: My general focus is coverage triangles. That's
246.44s: 99% of the trades that I'm gonna put on in my IRAs and
250.88s: With that I just looked at the accounts and I have averaged from
255.72s: 2007 19 15.2 percent so it's not as high as my general margin account by a fair
262.28s: margin sorry for the pun
264.40s: But that part aside it's still slightly above the market and
269.44s: You know it just shows that using options kind of in a very conservative manner
273.16s: We can still enhance our returns modestly over the market
276.44s: but again kind of fall fall within the rules of
281.64s: The IRA structure so that's pretty much all I have for this
286.44s: I don't really believe in actively trading the IRA
289.60s: This is where I put a lot of my slower trading things and I focus on my margin accounts
294.28s: for more actively trading and
297.00s: Like I said just keep in mind the amount that you can contribute to all
302.20s: IRAs is 6,000 a year as of right now so
305.92s: If you're interested in a Roth I would focus on that get that thing going and continue to max that out until you hit that threshold
313.32s: Then when you can't add to that anymore then you can rotate over to a traditional if you feel like it
318.76s: Just keep that mind if you do use Roth once you hit that threshold you're stuck and then the other
324.28s: Thing to keep in mind like I said is the futures trading if you do want to speculate you can use futures
329.72s: But other than that it's going to behave a lot like a regular account
332.96s: It's just going to force you to be cash secured. So you're not going to be able to trade on margin for options
338.48s: So that is essentially my approach. I keep it really simple in there nothing crazy
343.20s: If anybody's any questions or anything that they like to add on what they like to do in their IRAs feel free to chime in
350.08s: Let me know and I'll catch everybody later
