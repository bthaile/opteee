1.04s: no position update from roaring Kitty
3.52s: but a fascinating day in the options
6.92s: chain I want to walk through the
8.64s: position that he has and what it looks
10.32s: like today even though we haven't seen
12.44s: the latest I'm going off of what he
14.00s: shared previously but then I definitely
16.40s: want to dive into what I'm seeing in the
17.96s: options chain because there's some
19.72s: really really interesting activity that
21.80s: can have some pretty significant
23.12s: implications for what we're seeing in
24.72s: GameStop so let's Dive Right In right
27.64s: now what I've done is kind of crossed
29.32s: out the last prices and updated with
32.04s: what they are as of now even though
34.08s: technically GameStop is right around 26
35.80s: after hours it closed at 2546 so left it
38.52s: there and then the 20 calls that he has
42.28s: they're trading for 635 this is the mid
44.76s: price this is really important to drive
46.92s: home this mid price is not what he would
50.08s: get if he chose to close all
53.80s: 120,000 of these calls because as he
57.92s: starts unwinding this the market would
60.32s: start to move so what that means is I'm
64.28s: quoting it at the midpoint that's not
67.16s: what he actually would be able to
68.72s: execute at that doesn't mean that he
70.60s: would be completely eviscerated and not
73.24s: be able to make a market obviously the
75.08s: market makers will provide a market but
77.08s: it's just important to note that this
78.20s: would look slightly different if he
79.52s: chooses to liquidate the position all at
81.40s: once which I don't imagine he would do
83.76s: he's done things in phases so far and it
86.24s: also seems like he seems to prefer to
89.08s: exercise his options which is another
90.92s: interesting layer to this so taking a
94.08s: look at the 5 million shares at
97.04s: 21274 right now those would be worth
99.36s: about 20.9 million and these long calls
103.72s: would be worth about 8.1 million so that
107.32s: takes his p&l to about 29 million bucks
110.48s: unrealized on these positions and he
112.88s: still would presumably have the 29.4
116.12s: million in cash so we did get to see a
119.44s: couple hilarious memes from him today we
122.28s: got this one from the office we have the
124.68s: GameStop logo and then the kitty in the
126.48s: pocket over here and then a sweet mullet
129.04s: and then over here we have the
132.64s: unbelievable humor of breaking news on
136.68s: CNBC with our boy raring Kitty just
140.16s: chilling in his chair and the beginning
141.72s: of this video is epic it's the clip from
144.40s: Eng glorious bastards where the dude
147.04s: says you know this might be my
148.36s: masterpiece it's yeah couldn't agree
151.24s: more this is a masterpiece so let's take
155.16s: a look at the options chain because this
158.44s: is where things start to get a bit
160.56s: interesting if we take a look at the
162.60s: volume which to be clear volume is
164.84s: different than open interest open
167.36s: interests are contracts that are
170.00s: currently open it means that there's a
171.72s: buyer and seller on both sides of that
175.12s: contract volume are the number of
177.72s: contracts traded in a day so this volume
180.92s: could represents buying contracts and
183.20s: opening new ones this can also represent
185.84s: closing contracts where volume can lead
189.12s: to a decrease in oi which is actually
192.16s: what I think might be happening here to
193.52s: some degree now the 21 June 24th this is
197.48s: roaring Kitty's chain right now and I do
200.20s: believe it's his chain and if you look
202.72s: through the volume for today let's take
204.72s: a scan down together I see 21 3 39 797
209.56s: pretty big number 761
216.24s: 93,6 keep going 676 588 38 592 so on and
222.32s: so forth the next largest volume for
225.80s: today was at
228.80s: 27182 volume which is at the 30 and then
232.60s: we see out to the 35 8628 now from an
237.32s: options trading perspective this is
238.60s: always funny because this is anchoring
241.04s: human beings like round numbers so
242.76s: you'll notice that the 30s have more
244.72s: volume in oi the 35s have more volume in
247.76s: oi that's kind of standard Fair humans
249.96s: are pretty predictable in that sense
251.36s: it's kind of interesting it's actually
253.12s: what makes options so interesting is
254.80s: that you can pick up on a lot of these
256.44s: small behaviors and actually trade them
258.88s: now this is interesting this amount of
261.24s: volume is anomalous and if we take a
263.52s: look at the existing open interest it's
267.72s: 169,900 contracts
271.32s: so it's really difficult to say whether
273.64s: or not this is Kitty starting to unwind
277.32s: even if this was all his volume which I
279.32s: absolutely do not think it is it still
281.40s: would leave a lot of his position open
283.68s: my guess is this would be a mix of
285.36s: people involved
287.04s: transacting and what could be happening
290.48s: here is some of that cashless exercise
293.12s: that we talked about and really all that
295.68s: is is a method for him to capitalize on
298.04s: some of the p&l of his options position
301.04s: because even though it's not a massive
302.84s: p&l he's still up $8.1 million so he
306.60s: could always essentially trade even half
310.28s: of this position 60,000 he could then
313.12s: take the 4 million that he would
316.16s: generate from that and use that 4
317.92s: million to buy shares at spot price now
321.36s: we can confirm a little bit more of that
323.36s: if we take a look at the stock volume
325.16s: for today which is mostly sale volume
328.52s: the vast majority
330.28s: of the volume that we saw today was on
332.52s: the cell side
335.08s: so if we zoom in on this bar it looks
337.88s: about 140 of that is sale volume so
343.56s: again kind of the majority there so what
346.04s: does this mean for roaring Kitty's
348.72s: position well as far as I can tell a few
352.20s: things could be
353.40s: happening the first one like we talked
356.20s: about ashless exercise I do think that
359.04s: could be on the table for him because we
360.76s: know he does not have the free cash in
363.72s: order to generate probably the size of
365.68s: the long shares he would want to hold
368.64s: the other thing that could be happening
370.40s: that I'm not convinced is happening yet
373.92s: is if we look through the other options
378.28s: chains I don't see corresponding volume
381.56s: so even if we take a subset of this 93
384.12s: and assume 30 or 60 of it is his if I go
387.96s: out to the 19 July expiration and I look
390.56s: at the volume for today I don't see
393.64s: enough volume that would add up to
395.48s: anything kind of close to his size
397.72s: unless he's a much smaller subset of
399.84s: that which he could be he could be
401.32s: unwinding in 10,000
403.80s: lot um blocks and that actually seems to
407.44s: be probably what he did to enter
409.52s: although he definitely had some larger
410.92s: blocks to get into the position now you
413.40s: might be asking why am I using these
415.04s: expirations These are the standard
416.76s: expirations as compared to the weekly
418.28s: there's more liquidity in here here so
420.52s: to prove that point if we come here to
422.96s: this 9 days to expiration we go to the
426.28s: at the money strike right now the 26 is
429.44s: they're a 58 Delta and they're 5 cents
432.96s: wide if we go out here to the next
436.00s: expiration we use the at the money
438.60s: you'll notice how much wider all of
440.44s: these are and that's for a reason it's
443.32s: because there's less people in these
445.68s: expiration Cycles if you take a look at
447.32s: the open interest it's still there's
449.68s: still open interest there to be clear
451.00s: but it's nowhere near as much as you'll
452.76s: see in the primary expiration cycles and
454.76s: that's almost always going to be the
455.92s: case unless there's an event or
457.68s: something like that that would funnel
459.00s: people into a specific expiration people
461.56s: are looking for liquidity especially
463.08s: larger Traders they're trying to
464.28s: transact at the fairest prices available
466.80s: so now if we go out here we looked at
469.32s: the 19 July if we go out here to the 16
471.28s: Aug and I start looking through the
473.52s: volume for today is still not that
476.52s: impressive now these two block trades
479.96s: these are interesting to
481.84s: me and it's because they're a very
484.00s: similar size
485.32s: 1,786
487.32s: 1,785 however based on what I've seen so
489.80s: far from raring Kitty he kind of keeps
492.12s: his position super simple if you'll
493.84s: notice he has two positions he has a
496.60s: shares and then one expiration so I'm
499.56s: not convinced that this would be him
501.20s: either he doesn't seem like he was going
502.52s: to go to the 26 and the 27 again not
505.40s: outside the realm of possibility but
506.60s: it's just not what I'm seeing so far all
508.76s: I can say definitively as of this point
511.48s: is something's happening here there's no
513.40s: doubt
514.68s: 93,000 volume in these contracts is not
518.68s: insignificant and if we just do the math
520.92s: on this we know
522.72s: 120,000 of these were his so just
527.36s: following the logic here that means some
530.48s: of
531.28s: these probably are
534.44s: his if this turns out to be a mix in a
538.96s: mix of buy and sell volume there could
542.88s: be the alternate scenario where this is
546.32s: just a bunch of
549.40s: buys could be and if this is a bunch of
553.96s: buys that means none of this might be
556.24s: Unwound and that means most of this
558.68s: might be positive change in open
561.00s: interest adding to the position so what
564.08s: I'm trying to highlight here is that you
565.96s: can't definitively tell from what you
568.08s: see from at least this picture so far
570.88s: again what I can tell something's
572.80s: happening in this strike which is
574.80s: interesting cuz it's his this is a giant
577.60s: amount of volume relative to what I've
580.16s: seen at least so far this could be a mix
583.60s: of buy and sell volume which means it
587.04s: could be Kitty unwinding some of his
589.60s: position to either buy more shares or it
591.88s: could be him rolling out in time or it
594.16s: could be a bunch of people getting into
595.88s: the trade or it could be a mix of both
597.92s: of those where most of that volume is a
599.52s: bunch of people getting into the trade
600.68s: and maybe he's unwinding some of it or
602.84s: maybe he just bought a bunch more we
604.96s: won't know until tomorrow it's too early
607.04s: but we were following the breadcrumbs
609.72s: eagerly awaiting his next update I got
611.60s: to say because it would make all this
612.72s: investigative work much easier but I am
615.08s: just too interested to not continue
616.92s: following this long on a daily basis
618.32s: it's way too fascinating so I want to
620.36s: thank you all again for sharing your
621.68s: community with me the Apes have been so
623.52s: cool I'm getting a chance to learn so
625.44s: much about this Saga it's a blast I've
627.36s: been in markets for 16 years there's
629.16s: just just not too many instances to see
631.48s: really really interesting things like
633.16s: this happening especially with options
635.04s: which is kind of where I tend to operate
637.20s: so I'm having an absolute ball learning
639.80s: alongside you guys if you have any
641.24s: questions throw them in the comments
643.20s: I'll see you guys later
