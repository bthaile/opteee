0.00s: What's up outliers? Happy Friday. Welcome to another options trading for beginners session.
6.68s: Believe it or not, we're running out of these. I have a handful of more that are in the
14.10s: docket. And then we're going to switch this series a little bit into something else.
20.52s: So enjoy these while they're here because they ain't going to be here forever. All right,
28.88s: let me get this chat over here. And let's do a quick rundown. First, if you're here,
33.44s: don't forget to say hello. That's the whole point of doing a live stream is to hang out
36.96s: with you all is compared to making videos by my loan sum, which is way less fun. Although
42.20s: I'm not even going to lie, the video that I made today was pretty enjoyable. I like,
47.92s: I looked down at the time and I realized like I had been, I'm essentially at like what?
54.08s: 25 minutes was that video earlier today was nuts because I ended up just kind of rambling
59.84s: about this story because it was nuts. But really fun all the same. We are loaded up on beverages.
69.60s: We have the black berry lemonade from Waterloo. Then we have Mandarin orange from Croger.
76.72s: And then we also have a spin drift raspberry lime. So I am essentially almost positively going to
85.12s: need a pea break, but I am not going to need a break to go get liquid because I have quite
90.88s: literally a plethora of them. So I'd love to hear how your trading week was. And I want to say
97.36s: a lot of everybody, I see we got Tom Benoit, the sheet, what the sheet could you see, Brenna
104.16s: Gayson, Elon Songs, Mac chicken, OG, what a name. I love that. Kenny Wu, love that Reese Eric.
114.96s: It's my doppelganger. In case you guys didn't know, there's another Eric, which is really,
119.04s: really cool. Steven running D Gen, aren't we all D Gens at the core? Shrey J Mike, we got
127.84s: everybody hanging out. Shane Soldner, that's a hell of a name too. I would have, I'd like my
133.76s: mind goes soldier there, which would have been completely wrong. All right, so what's the deal
139.44s: for today? Well, there are two big things. The first thing is I want to work through this list
145.84s: with you guys, understanding common options trading misconceptions. That's the first thing.
153.44s: The second thing that I want to work through with you guys is taking a look at specifically
158.56s: what kind of misconceptions you've heard. And as always, my intent to go through this session is
167.44s: we should me and are all over. So if there's a specific thing we're talking about from this
171.68s: misconception list that leads into a rabbit hole conversation about a specific trade that was put
177.28s: on, that is cool. That's the point of live sessions. If I want to do a discrete video about this,
183.60s: I would do a video just about this and post that as compared to doing a live session. You get
188.40s: the point. So I just want to encourage people at no point are you bothering me or anything like that.
197.84s: All right, that part aside.
200.16s: Um,
204.72s: Brennan Gates says you see news on Andrew left. Yeah, man, you must have not seen the news on the video
209.84s: that I put out about Andrew left. I spent like the first half a day, or I guess like
216.96s: half the afternoon talking about this dude. So that video is for you because I am aware of Andrew
223.84s: left. And I actually think it's a really, really interesting update to the to the GME story.
230.40s: H says love the content. Thanks for putting this style of information out there. Awesome. Yeah,
235.04s: I love that. That's great. That's absolutely great. Steven says, let's look at Bitcoin. Yeah,
240.88s: I'm happy to start there. In the meantime, I would like you guys to let me know what you saw this
246.24s: past week in the market. So the reason why is a lot of the sessions that we're doing, they're predicated
251.76s: on this idea of, you know, understanding the theory and the background behind
258.08s: options trading. Now one of the things we're going to do today is actually review a trade that I
261.76s: took off last week so that we're integrating more and more and more practical application.
270.88s: That's where this all goes. You can understand the theoretical, the theoretical aspects of options
276.80s: trading inside and outside ways backwards. Whatever other dimension there is. And it doesn't
282.96s: matter unless you can figure out how to use them to make money. So we're at the point in our
290.64s: journey together. I don't even know which episode this is at this point. You guys might know
294.40s: better than me. I can't even see it. It's kind of annoying actually. The title cuts it off here.
298.00s: What episode are we on? Is this like eight seven something like that? Eight maybe.
302.96s: And so we're at the point now where the groundwork has been laid. And we need to start pivoting the
314.72s: way we think about markets to the practical application. Jason says, hey, perfect. That's useful.
319.68s: Yeah. So eight episode eight. We've been through a few of these at this point.
326.56s: And the reason why I'm drinking a lot, by the way, is because I just got a shit ton of
330.24s: cupping done. And you're supposed to have a lot of fluid to help flush all that madness around.
335.36s: So though my right leg right now looks like fucking hamburger. If you guys want to see it later,
340.64s: maybe I'll flash you my leg, but it looks nuts. I get cupping done fairly regularly, but the
346.56s: leg is bad because I have like an inflamed thing going on. You know how it goes. It's a 33 year old
352.16s: white man problems. As I'm training more shit is breaking and I don't see it getting better.
358.08s: So now I'm having them put suction cups on me to keep me together. That's the thesis.
363.76s: Little stretch out. Good to see you. Let's say, okay, let's now go back up and let's take a look
374.08s: at Bitcoin. Bitcoin was up today. I mean, I don't know. It's not doing anything exciting to me.
383.36s: To me, it needs to be above this level before I really care.
396.56s: Essentially up there. This is the way I think about it.
403.28s: Because Bitcoin has been pretty range bound for a while, right? So it started basing down here.
410.32s: So I care about it if it's down below this. And then, okay, sometimes I do stupid things.
420.24s: Like the stupid thing I did there was not change this. I thought I changed it, but I didn't change it.
427.76s: And wait. Okay, so I didn't mess that up. What's happening right now? Why are these alerts?
437.12s: Are these like not good till canceled? What's happening here? Oh, duh. Because it's N24. See,
444.32s: I like I just said, I do stupid things sometimes. So anyways, it's because so in case you didn't know
450.96s: what was going on there and why there was a problem, it's because they're good for this expiration,
455.44s: which is essentially is now. So they're not sticking. And then I think when you put these in different
462.88s: groups, yeah. So like you have to pick which expiration cycle you want. So that was my bad.
469.20s: That was my bad. That do you some dumb there? But anyways, this looks really range bound to me.
473.44s: It looks like we had lower lows, lower lows, higher low, higher low, slightly higher high. Like this
481.84s: was a bit of an inflection point in my opinion. Then it just glide, slope down. We based out here.
488.72s: So this tells me obviously people are willing to transact at this level. And it's starting to
494.72s: drift back up. But I mean, to me, this point of control is going to be a little bit of a problem.
500.48s: It looks like it's already starting to break through. So this can definitely start to look like
505.60s: support once it gets all the way through. But it just looks like a lot of congestion right here.
511.04s: So essentially, before it starts getting above those levels, I don't necessarily see like a massive
518.16s: story here. I maintain a position in Bitcoin just in the underlying itself. But that's mostly just
525.20s: because Bitcoin, I think, is interesting. And I view it as a disruptor. And that's the reason why
531.84s: I like it. So a slightly different thought process towards these. But yeah, I mean, happy to take a
538.24s: look at it. If there's something specific that you're seeing, I'm always down to discuss that. But
542.80s: at least from my perspective, this doesn't look too, I don't know, too interesting yet.
549.28s: Now, I want to talk you all through a couple things from the past week, just from a broader market
554.40s: perspective. The reason why I want you guys to like hear some of this information is because I think
566.32s: it's really important to be able to see how these different things start to fit with one another.
576.16s: So that's really what I want to talk about specifically with this past week. So I want to take
582.64s: a step back and go here. And I want to walk you guys through some of the broader trends as far as
590.88s: I see it from the past week. And if you look at just this chart, these series of charts,
597.44s: before I even say anything, what do you think one of the things is that I would talk about here?
606.16s: We got to stand up. What sticks out to you here?
613.20s: Sneheel says I thought today's live was GME. That is incorrect. And I'm sorry to break your heart.
622.24s: The GME live stream is tomorrow. The Friday live streams are options for beginners. So this is where
630.40s: we're kind of going through the basics of options and stuff like that. So a little bit of a different
635.20s: focus. So yeah, sorry, Sneheel. Well, I mean, I'm not really sorry. I've been really good about
640.96s: publishing the dates with what is when. So I'm not so sorry about that to be completely honest,
646.40s: because I know I've been pretty clear about it. But I guess the part I'm sorry for is that it would
653.28s: make me sad if I was going to a concert expecting one band. And it was a completely different band.
659.44s: I wouldn't like that. So I don't blame you for being in here and being like, what is this all about?
665.76s: I don't blame you. But and I feel bad for that because I was hoping that it would be closer to
671.52s: your expectations. But yeah, that one's tomorrow. And for those that are interested in that live
675.44s: stream tomorrow, the game plan is really Newton's not joining me for this one. He can't make it. He's
681.36s: going to start back up on the next one next week. We're going to connect again, because we're both
686.24s: doing a bit of research. But my game plan for tomorrow is actually to go pretty deep into watching
693.20s: some of his old videos and stuff. I've been collecting some that I want to work through.
698.32s: It's just to learn that's essentially the goal for me tomorrow. And that's actually why I was
702.80s: asking people for help, because a lot of folks, especially in the chat are way, way, way more
709.52s: abreast with like the history behind this whole thing. So that's the goal for tomorrow's live stream.
714.96s: Today's options for beginners. So it looks like a few things I see. Tom is bang on as would be
722.64s: expected. He's typically on top of some of these broader trends. And this is a really important one,
730.16s: because one of the very clear things you're seeing is strength in small caps. That's super important.
737.84s: The reason why it's super important is because that in and of itself opens up a series of trade
747.36s: opportunities if you are a discerning trader. So you can think of things like pairs relationships
754.08s: and pairs trades. You can look at relative value between the different indices and where they're at.
760.32s: You can look at macroeconomic factors and how right now small caps are trying to front run
767.52s: the rate cut that we think is coming. So the reason why I want to draw your eyes to something like
774.00s: that is because you have to get in the habit as a trader of looking at these things. You have to have
778.72s: a specific process that you go through because if every day you open up the platform and it's just
783.60s: kind of like whatever blinks the brightest to you or whatever, like you're never really going to see
788.56s: anything. You have to take the time to make deliberate scans and things that you want to look at
793.92s: in particular analyze relationships because then it starts to breed trade ideas. Now to give you
800.16s: guys a little bit of background on this, anybody that's been in my community since the beginning of
805.12s: the year, you guys know that I expected this to happen. Now I want to be abundantly clear. This
811.76s: took longer than I thought and I told you guys that as well because I originally structured the whole
817.44s: IWM slash Russell trade under the idea that we originally were looking at rate cuts so much earlier
825.20s: in the year and then everything changed. And guess what? Markets do that. Markets change.
832.72s: And that actually goes into one of the misconceptions we're going to talk about in a little bit
837.04s: because one of the hallmarks of a trader is the ability to adapt to changing environments. So again,
844.48s: going back to the community as I'm doing YouTube live streams on Monday talking about the stuff
850.88s: that I'm doing. There was a while back that I told everybody that I pivoted out of small caps
856.40s: and then I pivoted back into small caps when I saw them start doing what I thought made sense.
863.20s: So if you can start identifying broader market relationships, the idea of doing that sooner rather
872.24s: than later is only going to help you. So there's a reality behind time and tenure in markets
879.12s: and it just takes time observing things. You can't fast track that. You can only see things as
884.40s: fast as they happen. So what I recommend to people is just take the time even if it's just for a few
891.04s: minutes, it doesn't even have to be all the markets open. But take the time on a daily basis and try
898.16s: to look at a few things consistently for a set period of time. So for example, pick something like
904.80s: the Russell and just follow it for a week, just a week, but make sure you look at it every day
910.16s: for that week. I guarantee you you'll learn something. I literally guarantee you you will learn
915.12s: something. What it is, it depends on what you know going into it. But by being specific with some
920.88s: of these things that you're literally drawing concerted focus towards will help you.
927.12s: So yeah, that's one of the really important things that happen this week. There's another few things
933.12s: that I think we can draw from this past week, one of which is the market's perception still
942.56s: of the rate environment that we're in. So if we grab this and we look at news, right? So this is
949.52s: from this past week and we take a look at some of the things that have happened. What's happened? Well,
954.80s: home sales came in a little bit light. That matters. Again, this once you start getting the
962.24s: habit of analyzing these things, the first flow of my thoughts when I see this is how we're small
968.56s: lending banks doing that would typically finance these things, how are materials doing, how are
973.36s: builders doing? There's immediately trade themes that you can come up with just from this information.
980.32s: Now, this is the cool part is you could decide if you're trying to play more thematic things that
985.60s: take way longer to unravel or you could literally play the digestion of this information.
992.00s: Because even though as a retail trader, your propensity to be first in line to see this metric come
997.92s: out and trade it is essentially no. It's probably never going to happen. That doesn't mean that you
1002.96s: still can't make money trading information like that as the broad move gets priced in. Because
1009.44s: this is exactly how we get into these instances where stocks become so beat down or so elevated.
1017.36s: And that's because price is not always rational. It gets pushed to these extremes. And then it slowly
1026.64s: oscillates back to normal levels. It's very common. It'll continue to happen. And this all comes
1033.68s: down to an observable market effect that's tied to this concept called information discreteness or
1040.80s: indiscreteness. And it's this idea that in order for new information to be integrated into market
1047.68s: pricing, it's not an instantaneous thing. And people have different ideas about it. So it leads to
1053.60s: what we call noise price noisiness. So something like this that's just kind of bouncing around and
1060.40s: then it just randomly hits 163367. And then it decides, up, that's it to the downside. And then
1066.08s: it starts going up from there. That's noisiness. This is not a clean dissemination or integration
1072.72s: of information. And it leads to extremes. Tradeable events. So to wrap down this thought here,
1081.28s: let's take a look at a couple other things from this past week. So we had the composite
1087.44s: from S&P PMI. We had the services, global services and global manufacturing PMI. Why would all of
1093.92s: these matter? Why do I care about these metrics? And for those that don't know, I want you to take a
1099.84s: guess. If you do know, you don't have to answer because you already know the answer to this.
1106.48s: But if you're not sure, if you know, I would love to see what the guess is. Shraja is a great
1114.24s: question. Shraja says, what are your thoughts on XLB strength despite poor housing data? It's a
1118.72s: great question. It's not causal. It's not causal at all. So just because home sales are up or
1127.44s: down, one, the miss was minor, very minor, literally 3.89 versus 3.99. So this is not any sort of
1139.36s: giant miss. But the other thing is you have to again zoom out into the broader macroeconomic
1145.36s: picture. What do you think home builders would be doing in an environment where they think rates
1152.08s: might start to come down? What would they do in that scenario? And that in there lies most likely
1158.40s: than not the answer to your question. The sheet, what the sheet says rate cuts or not depending on
1165.76s: PMIs? Yeah, that's great. That's exactly it. And Jason's concept of build based on what I was
1171.12s: just talking about what the builders might be doing in this scenario is exactly correct. So that's
1175.60s: why because this missed by 3.89 versus 3.99 is why XHB doesn't care. There are other factors right now
1183.04s: that are overwhelming that data. That's the cool thing, right? Because this is new home sales. This
1189.52s: isn't new home builds. This isn't build permits. Take a look at build permits this next line.
1195.36s: 3.90 versus 3.4. It essentially tells you the inverse of that, right? It's important to look at
1203.20s: individual data points. The example I was giving before when I said looking into those when you see
1207.60s: these, it's just to get people thinking about where to look after you see these data points.
1213.44s: But it's not that they're causal relationships because they're not.
1220.00s: Shane, Shane says I don't know what those things actually mean. That's literally great. I'm glad you
1225.04s: said that. Let's take a really quick look together. We don't have to dive super far into this. And
1230.00s: the other thing is I actually want to steer you guys away from looking too far into economic
1236.40s: indicators because it is a little, I'm not exactly sure it's the best use your time.
1243.20s: Is the easiest way to describe it. But there is usable information. So when you look at stuff like
1250.24s: PMI, you can see a sent wool. Oh, it's this. I was like, where the fuck did I just get a
1257.04s: check ping from? So this is looking at a certain set of data, right? And you can see essentially
1265.04s: what's built into the data, what's built into the surveys and what you can deduce from it.
1271.52s: Now, if you think about what's topical right now in the market, it's anything related to inflation,
1280.64s: anything related to cost to produce things. All of that is under a microscope right now
1286.64s: because we've been in an elevated rate environment for some time. That will change. That's not
1291.28s: always going to be the case. That's this is not always going to be the most important thing out
1295.20s: there. And that's the cool part about markets is that during the bull market that we saw essentially
1301.04s: from 2010 until COVID-ish, there was a bunch of other things that mattered way more than stuff like
1307.28s: this. So the idea is to try and identify what matters at a given point in time from a broad
1314.32s: perspective and then find supporting data points that help us assess where we're at in the
1321.12s: specific broader picture so that you can come up with ideas. So that's why right now stuff like
1327.68s: PMI is actually really, really important. So Shane, that's what the data is. It tells us different
1337.20s: economic assessments really. And you can take a look. There's different people that do these. So
1343.44s: this is S&P global. There are some that there's ISM. That's another really common one and they'll
1348.64s: have difference in what they report and shit like that. That's the same kind of thing is looking
1354.64s: and carefully tracking these kinds of things will give you some ideas on where we're at in a market
1360.32s: cycle. So that's why I think this stuff managed to you. Nick, what up? Good to see you as well.
1367.36s: Shane says his PMI private Morgan insurance. No, I just showed you what it was. You got to work
1375.12s: with me here. I literally just showed you what it was. I grabbed the website again. S&P PMI.
1385.92s: Oh, it's right there. I'm an idiot right there. So do you see? I'll throw this in the chat for
1402.00s: you so you can take a look. And then you can take a look at the actual reports, right? And you can
1408.96s: see what's in there. The sheet also is not correct. It's a great guess, but that's not it either.
1416.88s: Fantastic. Yes, very close, but not exactly quite. In this case, it's the purchase
1422.72s: in managers index. So there's PMI, which we really care quite a lot about. There's a couple other
1431.28s: like larger ticket economic releases that matter to us more than others. Another important one
1438.16s: believe it or not, GDP, which is a recent one from this past week. And GDP came in good,
1443.36s: actually surprisingly good. I think the market and most people in general were pretty surprised
1447.60s: that where this came in 2.8 versus 2 expected. That was much higher for the prelim for Q2. That was
1454.08s: interesting. Then there's PCE, which is another important inflation style metric, 2.9 versus 2.7.
1461.84s: So what I'm highlighting right now are just some broader macroeconomic measurements that matter
1468.32s: to the current market to varying degrees. And you should just be aware of them. So as you look
1473.52s: across the previous week, these are some of the important things I think that show up here and
1481.36s: that you should be aware of. So that is that. All right, let's get over to some of these misconceptions.
1490.16s: What do you guys think of this very first one? This first one says this is how you make 500
1494.80s: a week selling covered calls or easy, passive income. Are these things that you've seen or are
1502.16s: these things that you've believed for yourself at some point? I'm going to type in actually,
1507.20s: I'm going to grab a private window so that it's not skewed by any of my search habits. And then
1515.04s: I'm going to go to YouTube.com and then I'm literally going to type in options trading. That's it.
1522.88s: Now I want to see what pops up. Let's see.
1532.32s: So we have full free course. That's fine. This is fine. Here you go. We're right off, we're right
1539.52s: off to the jump. If I wanted to make 1000 a week trading options, what does this even mean?
1547.68s: I'll tell you what this is. This is really good branding designed to capture somebody's attention
1555.20s: that's like, oh, shit, I want to make a thousand dollars a week. Who doesn't want to make a thousand
1558.40s: dollars a week? I'd make more than that. So I'd like to make that too. So why not do this?
1563.20s: Right? That's it's natural. And unfortunately, a big part about this is
1571.84s: appealing to people's issues, specifically the desire to make money fast. So this one actually
1579.28s: project finance. Chris, I've talked with him a few times. He's a buddy of mine. He's cool.
1584.08s: And I like the stuff that he does. We have very different approaches to trading, but I like his stuff.
1589.60s: I just want to see what else is in here. There you go. 91% win rate. Who doesn't like a good win rate?
1598.80s: And believe it or not, that'll actually be one of the things we talk about in here.
1602.96s: In this back here is why, in my opinion, that's probably one of the worst possible things to focus
1608.40s: on as a new trader, which no big surprise there. I think it's hilarious that that's a common
1614.72s: thing. So anyways, what I'm trying to highlight to you, it's not to go through and poke at these
1618.96s: other YouTube videos and stuff. What I'm trying to highlight is the shit that's put in front of you
1624.24s: as a new trader. And the fact of the matter is, options are complicated. They are not impossible
1631.92s: by any stretch. You do not have to be a genius to figure that amount. I am clearly proof of that.
1637.92s: However, this, it's not, it's not a place for either of these is what it comes down to.
1643.44s: Could you make $500 a week selling covered calls? Of course you could. But what this comes down to
1650.08s: is this is how you make $500 a week. What are the things that just trigger in your mind?
1654.80s: $500 every week. That's not going to happen with that. Not going to happen with that.
1662.16s: And but it leads you to believe that that's true. And the issue with that then is then you start
1668.24s: this world of trading with this really contorted mindset and it sends you down the entirely wrong
1674.40s: path in my opinion. So that's why we don't like these ones. The idea of easy passive income in my
1686.48s: opinion, it also sets traders up for the wrong experience because it's focusing on this idea of
1693.20s: easy. And then as soon as we start having to do difficult things to be successful at this,
1698.80s: well, we struggle because we started thinking that this was easy and passive. So to both of these
1705.84s: in the beginning, I would offer a counter data point for you. So I'm going to go to my website
1715.36s: because I'm still building this out for you guys to have kind of some different resources available.
1721.44s: And in this tab here, there's a bunch of different things we can look at, but one of them I want
1726.24s: to show you is this right here. Right? So if we're looking at something that you can make $500 a
1732.80s: week selling covered calls or it's easy passive income, then how, how, how is it the case that we see
1741.44s: these issues that after five years in the market, generally speaking, 7% give or take of traders
1750.08s: continue trading where even a small cohort of them are not profitable. Why is that?
1757.44s: If it's easy passive income or if this is how you make X number of dollars a week selling covered
1764.32s: calls, why is that? Or this, why is it that of the 7% that continue trading? Why is it that such a
1773.04s: large number of them underperform the market on average by 6.5%. That's what this number is,
1779.44s: by the way, I know it's a little confusing. Why is that? What I'm highlighting to you is all of this
1785.84s: stuff in my opinion sets you up with the entirely wrong mindset to be successful in this long term.
1792.80s: I would encourage people to actually do something slightly different, which is this.
1800.80s: Understanding why this matters to us, right? So this kind of sucks if you think about it. The
1815.36s: average income in the US is 94K, median is 74, average retirement is 61, lifespan is 77.3.
1825.12s: That kind of sucks. So you essentially work your entire life and then you look to retire when
1830.72s: you're 61, where as I already mentioned to you at the beginning of this video, I already have, I think,
1836.32s: like a partially herniated fucking disc, and I'm going to physical therapy like I'm 90 in order to
1842.24s: move healthily and I'm 33. So I'm real eager to see what this whole thing looks like for Yabola at 61.
1852.08s: But my guess is I'm probably not going to do the same shit that I can do today. Then that's probably
1858.96s: what I'm guessing. And then if you're lucky, you get to enjoy that 16 years. It's good. 16 years is
1866.80s: good, but you only get one shot at this life thing. So then you start with that and you start to
1874.80s: realize, well, a lot of people don't do a great job at this. So then starting this entire process
1883.92s: with this in mind, that trading just as it can enhance your wealth, it can just as easily destroy it.
1895.68s: Why would I say that? Why would I throw that out there if the idea is to try to help present
1901.20s: information in order for people to figure this thing out? Well, it's the same thing like if I'm
1906.88s: coaching somebody in boxing and I put them in a sparring session and I just say, oh, it's easy.
1913.84s: You'd be okay. Just go in there and move around. You'd be okay. You'll figure it out.
1918.00s: What's probably going to happen to that dude in the ring? He's probably going to get the
1924.80s: just the piss beat out of them. And after that, we're going to have a really tough conversation
1931.28s: because because they weren't ready for that experience, they're now questioning if this thing is
1937.92s: for them or not, or maybe a better approach to that boxing scenario is if I have a friend,
1944.40s: I put them on a heavy bag for a little bit, then I put the mitts on and I work with them for a
1949.52s: little bit. I let them watch sparring sessions so that they can see what it looks like.
1954.96s: And then before that they go in there and they start doing a full spar, we move them at 30%,
1961.52s: 50%, we ratchet it up. Then what happens? What's the difference in that experience? Well, in the
1968.56s: latter experience, you are prepared to get punched in the fucking face because it's going to happen.
1976.40s: But if you start this without that expectation, when it happens, it completely derails you.
1983.52s: So if you walk into this trading world like most of us do, hoping for quick easy money,
1990.08s: and that's your base expectation. And as soon as you start to realize that it's not quite like that,
1995.84s: it becomes very difficult to continue because you're like, well, this isn't what I thought it was
2000.24s: going to be. Do I want to continue doing this? Which is a great question to ask yourself. But if you go
2005.20s: into this understanding that in the beginning, it is hard. In the beginning, you have a long way
2013.20s: to go. But however, if you're able to turn the corner, then all of a sudden it becomes worthwhile.
2024.16s: I thought I had another thing in here, but it's in here.
2031.12s: Here. This is it. This is what it's all about.
2035.76s: So for those that ask, like how long does it take to get really good at this? If you spend five
2044.64s: hours every single day without fail for five and a half years straight, you'll hit that typical 10,000
2051.44s: hour mastery, mastery level, five hours every single day for five and a half years.
2059.44s: A lot of people grossly overestimate how hard they're working and how fast they're learning.
2066.32s: And it leads to this over here, which is a very common wealth depleting effect. Then we have a
2074.16s: terrible experience. And then we have a choice. Do we continue this path or do we not? Because here
2080.40s: is the beauty and this is the absolute truth. Trading for me at this point genuinely is easy.
2089.92s: It is mindless. What I do as a trader is easy. But that's because literally all of the work is done
2101.44s: before I click a button. Everything is done before I click a button. All of the hard work is
2107.28s: completed before I have the luxury of being able to put a trade on by tapping my screen.
2115.04s: That's the reality. So if you can embrace this slope of learning and if you can embrace the
2125.12s: learning process, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But it's not a quick short tunnel.
2133.28s: That is the objective reality of this. And it's super important for you guys to hear that so
2140.64s: that you don't come into this with the wrong mindset and then go through a phase of lighting your
2146.72s: own wealth on fire, trying to do stupid things. That's number one. We got 11 more to go through.
2153.92s: Some of these will be a little bit faster. But do you guys have any questions on this one? Or this
2157.44s: is a great time for any injections or moving around anywhere else. If you have anything else,
2163.52s: you want to look at quick. The sheet says, I've been assuming the worst. I've been trying to get my
2168.56s: process with as many risk mitigations as possible. That's a good idea. But the problem is you can't
2175.28s: become too risk averse either. You have to have a really solid balance between the two in my opinion.
2181.12s: So I would be very careful with that idea of as many risk mitigations as possible. I'm not even
2186.56s: sure that that's the right focus there. If that were me, I would be focusing on the proper risk
2192.88s: mitigation. That's what I would think. G33 says stock goes up, call options go down WTF. That's easy.
2203.04s: There's a lot of reasons why that can happen. You're fighting a lot of things with call options.
2207.68s: You're experiencing stuff like faded decay, where the value of your option is eroding every single day.
2213.36s: You're fighting things like changes in volatility. So if the stock moves up a little bit,
2220.40s: but not enough to overwhelm faded decay, you'll lose money. Or if the stock moves up a little bit,
2225.44s: but not enough to outpace faded decay plus a change in volatility, you'll lose money.
2231.04s: That's the tricky part with options is that it starts to bake in new elements into what can happen
2238.32s: in our trade. So for example, if we're looking at something, we'll use GME. If you're looking at
2245.04s: something like GME and the reason why I think this is a good example, I'll explain why I think it's a
2249.44s: good example. Because let's say that you're trading GME and let's say, let me get rid of this.
2256.64s: Let's say that you're bullish and let's say that you've been in this game for a while and you're
2261.92s: trading GME from a long while back. Well, one of the problems that you will face with something like
2268.24s: GME is because it is heavily volatile. So your options are going to move as volatility chains.
2277.84s: Take a look at both the 30 day and the 7 day vol for literally the past week. It's moved
2287.76s: meaningfully. So if we take a look today is what, the 26th. So if we go back to the beginning of the
2295.36s: week here, your 30 day vol was like 171 and it landed today like 137. That's a direct input into
2305.52s: the value of your options and it just cratered. That does not help you. The other thing with
2312.56s: options specifically is that you need to move in a certain time frame because you're holding
2317.68s: at the king asset. So for example, let's say that you go back between the two squeezes that we've
2324.56s: seen. Let's say that you're somewhere in here and you're like, man, there should be another one soon.
2330.16s: I mean, you had a couple in here. So let's even cut those off. Let's say that you're getting
2333.92s: in somewhere around here like early 23 and you're just you're hoping for a movement.
2340.00s: Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Well, what is happening is your
2344.48s: options are eroding. So what that means is that if you eventually get a move, you now need a
2350.48s: bigger move to compensate for that holding duration that you were in and for a lot of GME
2357.04s: options traders as far as I can see, they structure their trades terribly and they're using these
2362.88s: really short dated options that decay super fast. I talked about that as well in the video today
2371.12s: because what I saw was this surprised me actually the fact that more people opened these
2376.48s: yesterday into today. I did not expect that and I called that out in the video by the way.
2381.84s: And the reason why I did that just for to call it out here in case you haven't seen the video is
2385.44s: I think it's important for people to realize that people get shit myself included wrong all the time.
2390.40s: So I would have guessed something else here. I literally would have guessed that the vast majority
2395.04s: of these people would be rolling their options out further in time, but there was clearly enough
2400.00s: yesterday into today to have a net positive inflow into these which that genuinely is surprising,
2406.80s: but it's also shouldn't be surprising with me anymore with GameStop. I should know better. Now,
2413.28s: if I take a look at where they're moving into though, it's very clearly here, right? The 25 strike
2419.92s: next week. There's 10,500 OI against 15,000 new volume. So there's already essentially a very
2428.40s: clear ad 4000 plus going on here. What's going to happen? Well, they're losing seven cents every day
2437.36s: on something that's worth 65 cents. So you have your $7 decay on something that's at 65 bucks.
2445.76s: 10.77% of the options value decays every day.
2456.08s: And the fun fact is that's going to get worse. As this gets closer to expiration as a percentage
2464.32s: of the remaining premium, this will get worse. So that's a big problem here. So all of that
2472.00s: is to go all the way back to whose question was that? Where was it?
2484.24s: G 33. That was to answer your question about stock goes up, call options go down. That's why.
2491.20s: It's not, it's not that relationship isn't as you're describing it. You're just missing the
2496.16s: rest of the nuance that goes with it. So yeah. Shane asks, what do you do with your unallocated
2504.64s: money? Do you leave it in cash? Do you put it in TLT or do you do something else with it? Yeah,
2508.40s: it's a great question. So the majority is going to be put into things called box spreads because
2517.44s: they get a better yield. So here's a video about box spreads. And then there's a log
2527.44s: for those interested in learning how to analyze box spreads. That's what I do with my money. So
2534.40s: capital that's not being utilized, I use box spreads for a bunch of different reasons, but it's
2538.96s: because they're highly, highly adjustable to whatever timeframe. There's a couple really
2544.48s: important traits when you're trading something called a box spread. The first one is you need to
2548.56s: use a European style option that has no early exercise. That is a massive risk if you're trading
2555.04s: box spreads. And especially if you're not expecting it to be there, there was somebody on Reddit
2560.08s: that traded a UVXY box spread that they didn't know this.
2567.44s: So this isn't actually what happened by the way. This is, oh, let me squish this down.
2581.60s: I think this person is trolling somebody else, but this is a joke, right? But they're trolling
2592.48s: else from here. So essentially, maybe it was this person.
2599.68s: But anyways, they're trolling. So there was somebody who had a UVXY box spread on.
2605.36s: And the problem with UVXY is that it's not a European style option has early assignment. So
2609.84s: it has a ton of risk, right? So again, this person I think is trolling somebody else. I forgot
2615.52s: the name of the person who actually did the real trade. But this is what that person thought.
2620.64s: This person thought that they were putting on a box spread, which if you're buying a box spread
2625.12s: and you're doing it correctly, it is a risk-free trade. However, if you're not paying attention to
2630.64s: the products you're using, there can be a ton of risk. And that's what happened to the person
2634.40s: doing this. They were using UVXY because they were able to get a shit ton of money.
2639.04s: Because there's risk, but they didn't realize that. They thought it was risk-free. So they thought
2644.40s: it was a really good risk-free return, which obviously wasn't. So that's a big problem.
2652.08s: WheelStrecht Joe says, any European style option have a dividend. That's actually a great question.
2658.96s: I don't think so because most European style options, at least like these, they don't have an
2663.84s: underlying, like they would be cash settled. Let me see you're a quick. Do any European style
2671.84s: options have a dividend? It's a good question. They do not. Oh no, this says index style options.
2681.44s: And then this one says, no, European styles do not usually pay dividends. So yeah.
2688.48s: Because what they're doing is they're equating right away European to index options.
2693.92s: Rudevega says, what's a European style option? Yeah, a good example of that are the indices.
2701.12s: So like SPX, this is a European style option. You'll notice that there's no underlying,
2706.72s: right? There's no volume. There's nothing that trades here. So European style options are options
2717.12s: that have no early exercise. And they're typically cash settled. It's one of the two
2727.04s: types of options that exist. There is American, which is mostly what you're used to seeing.
2733.76s: And then there's European. I think this is in here. Yeah.
2740.80s: So we would have went through this in one of the earlier videos that we did, but it's totally
2748.00s: cool to go back through. So the main component of a European style option is that there's no
2756.08s: early exercise. Now there are a lot of reasons why that matters. It matters in terms of pricing.
2762.48s: It matters in terms of risk assessment and things like that. But the other component is that many
2768.88s: European style options are also cash settled, which is a really important component, because
2777.92s: there's no underlying that moves. It's just settled to the value at that point in time.
2784.72s: So that's why using something like a box spread in a European style option is so important,
2790.88s: because early assignment induces risk that otherwise wouldn't be there,
2795.60s: which we're not trying to have.
2800.00s: Tom says, are you only using box spreads for capital allocated to the CS strategy? No,
2804.48s: I use box spreads for everything, man. Any unused cash in the portfolio, I will absolutely put
2811.28s: into something unless I'm planning on using it soon. Now normally I leave a little bit of money
2816.72s: easily accessible, right? So like, because like as a trader, I also don't know
2820.96s: what opportunities are going to come up. So I'll leave like a few hundred thousand dollars that I
2824.00s: can tap into whenever I want. But like the majority of unused cash is going to be put to work in
2830.32s: some capacity. So I'll put it in typically a box spread. Now to your point, a lot of times that
2835.60s: includes capital that's already allocated to other trades, but it's not being utilized yet.
2840.64s: So it's not always in one single box spread, right? Because I need to de-conflict by time the
2848.56s: different box spreads that I have out against when I think I need that money. So it makes a giant
2855.60s: difference in terms of when I want to use the capital, how I set up the box spread,
2863.36s: how many of them I need to have on at a given point in time, how much the box spread is worth.
2868.56s: All of that is variable, but it's all going to start with trying to use the capital. Now,
2875.36s: this is relatively new, especially from what I would have been talking to you guys about.
2879.52s: Because if we go back to pre-COVID, pre-interest rate increase, there was like no yield.
2885.60s: So if you put money in anything trying to earn something on the cash, it didn't really matter,
2892.48s: because you're earning so little that really are just sacrificing liquidity. It didn't really
2897.60s: matter that much. So yeah, the short answer though, it's definitely not just relegated to stuff
2904.00s: allocated to the coverage triangle. It's pretty much for everything. Good question though.
2911.20s: All right, let's get on now to our next one. The market should have done X.
2919.60s: What do you guys think about this? Why is this a misconception? What's wrong with this idea?
2923.68s: Yeah. What do you guys think? The market should have done X or Y or Z.
2937.68s: The notion here being that the market should have done something else.
2941.84s: Brennigate says, unforeseen circumstances. Nope, not it. That's not it.
2948.24s: The market is irrational. That's not it either. Hater says we don't control the market.
2955.28s: There we go. Rude of Vegas says no self accountability. There we go.
2959.76s: M. Ram says, views to narrow. You miss something. Could be.
2963.84s: Enig says the market will do what it will do. There you go. You guys got it. So
2968.24s: the market should have done X is stupid because it infers that what you think should have
2974.24s: happened, you surped what happened. The reason why I did whatever it did is because the rest of
2980.56s: the market did that. That other thing that you said shouldn't have happened, but the majority
2988.56s: said it should. And that's what they did. So the problem here is that for this kind of trader
2996.64s: and for this kind of mindset, you breed massive problems because you start to overvalue
3006.32s: your assessment of what should or should not happen over whatever is happening.
3013.76s: And it's a really weird concept to get used to, but at some point, you literally have to
3020.08s: relinquish yourself to the market. I know it sounds really weird and esoteric. But what it
3025.84s: means is even if you have some of the highest conviction ideas, if the market is not agreeing with
3032.00s: you, you have to reconsider them. So for example, a great version of this is the big short,
3040.40s: specifically when he had these custom swaps made, essentially on the mortgage back securities.
3048.08s: And the premium that he was paying on them was literally about to make his fund go insolvent.
3055.84s: Is much as that turned out to be the coolest story ever where Michael Burry stuck to his guns. He
3066.80s: really knew it was going to happen. And then it happened. You had better believe there was a massively
3075.12s: healthy dose of fucking luck. All the hard work in the world went into identifying the opportunity.
3083.60s: The luck component really came into the timing of the opportunity because he almost had to close his
3090.40s: positions because he was way too early and he was going to go insolvent. He actually had to go
3096.72s: death con five and essentially disallow people from pulling their money out of the account because
3102.64s: if they did, essentially the play would have died. So that kind of thing is really important to
3109.84s: acknowledge because even when we see these really, really cool stories, you like who doesn't love
3114.64s: what Michael Burry did. It's one of the coolest things ever. But he was super fucking close to that
3123.04s: whole thing not working, mistiming it and having an entire fund blow up. So while it's really cool
3129.84s: to look and acknowledge those really interesting scenarios, it's important to understand
3135.36s: survivorship bias, which is exactly what that is. We're looking at a successful result for
3142.16s: maintaining conviction and we're not seeing the litany of unsuccessful results stemming from
3150.16s: the same exact strong conviction. So what I'm highlighting with number two here is nobody,
3158.40s: literally nobody gives a flying fuck what you think should happen. Nobody cares. I don't care.
3166.00s: Nobody cares what I think should happen. Nobody cares. It is really important to understand
3173.84s: how to interface with markets. This other idea of markets can remain irrational,
3181.44s: longer than you can remain solvents. I love the saying, but guess what? If the market is remaining
3188.88s: irrational for a long duration, what does that tell you? Is it irrational then? Maybe, maybe it is.
3199.04s: I'm not saying all instances is not. I just told you in the beginning of the stream that prices can
3203.28s: get pushed to extremes that don't make sense. That can happen. But what I'm highlighting is this idea
3210.24s: that it's almost like where people will place themselves way higher than they should be in a hierarchy
3218.24s: and essentially saying that maybe the market is doing what the market thinks it should be doing
3224.24s: and maybe we're just being ignorant and stubborn and we don't like that it doesn't align with
3230.64s: what we want it to do. This idea of the market being irrational, longer than you can be solvent
3236.24s: is complete bullshit. It's worrying about the wrong thing. It's literally a giant series of bias
3243.92s: that are happening in that instance. Again, it will skew your thoughts heavily.
3252.08s: Let me grab this. This is another thing that I'm working on for resources for you guys. It's this
3259.92s: one. It's a giant list of all these different decision making faults, cognitive biases and all
3266.64s: that kind of stuff. All that really fun stuff. There's a few things in this kind of scenario that
3273.28s: really, really stick out to me. But this one is a massive one and there's cognitive bias
3286.32s: and there's another one that I'm thinking about in particular. I want to see if I can find it quickly.
3292.96s: No, no. This one. This one right here. Line spot bias. It's the perception of being less
3307.44s: biased than other people and that essentially your desire to assess others is more severe.
3313.12s: That's what that boils down to is when you say the market is irrational or can remain irrational
3322.96s: longer than you can remain solvent, that essentially means that you think you're so unbiased in your
3328.88s: analysis of things and the market is biased. It's complete bullshit.
3333.04s: All right. Next one.
3342.96s: Mike Williamson says, hurting. Yeah. Hurting is a really common one. I think where was that
3349.28s: towards the bottom or did I miss it? I might have taken that one out. It was literally on here
3354.88s: because I wanted to pick a weird number. And I'm going to continue building the cell. I don't
3359.20s: really care how long this one gets. But essentially hurting is absolutely another bias.
3366.24s: Hurting is interesting in terms of what it stems from. And the other thing you'll notice with
3371.04s: a lot of these different kinds of kind of devices is that they stem from similar things and they
3375.28s: overlap a lot. They're very infrequently discreet from one another. But yeah, like I said,
3381.20s: I literally am building this out on the website for you guys so that whenever you want a reference
3386.64s: of these different kind of decision making faults and shit, you can find a ton of them.
3390.96s: What led me to do this honestly was when I was building this for you guys. I was in the process
3399.36s: of updating this tool. And I wanted to build like a more in-depth syllabus to at least give you
3406.40s: some subtopics that I think you should focus on for each topic. This was the OG version.
3411.36s: Right. So this was supposed to be down in Dirty. Just send you down the right path, which was the
3415.04s: hope here. But this is to give you some specific things that you should be learning in these topics.
3420.72s: And take a look. I actually find this comical. Take a look at how many subtopics are in this one.
3426.80s: Nine. How many are in this one? 11. How many are in this one? Seven. And then you get to
3432.16s: trader, behavior and decision making. How many are in here? 32. And this isn't even all of them.
3440.48s: There's more that going here. And then I keep going down and I realize this one has 10.
3446.88s: This one has 10. This one has like four. This one had nine. You get the point. What I'm highlighting
3453.68s: is literally the densest section in this entire syllabus is this right here. And the reason why
3460.40s: that's the case is in my opinion, this is the difference between a successful trader or not.
3466.64s: Now, it's not quite that simple because in my opinion, the first differentiator is edge or do you
3472.80s: have the capacity to build edge? That's not that difficult to do, right? Edge is there. Edge,
3478.32s: there's structural alpha. There's different kinds of edge that exists objectively speaking.
3483.92s: And they're not that it's just not that difficult to find them. Now, off of that,
3492.72s: what then becomes the difference? If we have access to the same tools, the same information,
3497.52s: it's the individual trader. It's how they conduct business. So that comes down to decision making
3504.08s: and understanding yourself really well to make good decisions. So yeah.
3509.44s: Anec says, your opinion on a spread for our WT. Let's just, we'll take a look.
3518.08s: Some R WT. I swear if this is a penny stock. Okay, it's not, it's a reat.
3528.96s: What kind of spread?
3534.56s: It has earnings coming up.
3539.36s: You have to tell me, yeah, you have to tell me what position you're thinking of.
3545.68s: In a nutshell, as I look at this six-month daily, bullish trending, Anec says call put,
3551.84s: what kind of spread though? There's diagonal spreads, calendar spreads, vertical spreads.
3558.72s: You got to hook me up.
3562.64s: To me, it looks like it's had a massive move. This almost ran like a small cap,
3570.72s: essentially displaying very similar small cap behavior, meaning like the Russell 2000,
3574.64s: like a lot of stuff in the Russell moved like this. And I see upward sloping standard deviation
3581.60s: channels. I see the moving averages now all aligned as they should be. I see a little bit of
3587.28s: topping behavior going on here. So for me, I like to see a break up above that of some sort.
3596.16s: To the downside, it looks like it's channeling at this. So a break down below that, something like that.
3605.20s: Inex says, sorry, bro, you speak like Chinese for me now. That's totally cool.
3610.96s: So what I'm highlighting are different kinds of option spreads.
3615.36s: So I forgot which part in the series it was. You'll have to go through the titles because I
3620.88s: obviously don't remember. But there are different kinds of structures you could put on.
3626.00s: So a spread is a generalized type of option structure, but there's a lot of different kinds of
3634.24s: spreads. So there are things called vertical spreads, diagonal spreads, calendar spreads,
3640.08s: butterfly spreads, iron condors, like those are all different kinds of spreads.
3645.36s: The way to think about a spread in an option trade is essentially when you have an additional
3650.80s: leg of some sort that offsets components of another leg. That's kind of the idea. More or less.
3657.60s: So the way I would look at something like this personally is then if you're not sure like what
3662.48s: kind of structure makes sense, then I would start it with what's the thesis. Do we think up, down
3668.16s: sideways, which way do we think that RWT is set to move? And then from there we can work, I mean,
3675.44s: this is a great example of like building and framing a trade. We can work through that together.
3680.08s: I could open up the door for the pup.
3691.28s: But that's where it starts.
3693.28s: And it says I think up, but maybe hedging also those are literally completely different things.
3699.92s: Hedging is the process of reducing risk of some capacity up obviously is a bullish direction.
3706.16s: But if we're hedging that means that we want to reduce downside risk, which means we think
3710.40s: something is going to go to the downside. So I would offer to you that you have right at the
3715.60s: origin of your thesis, you have conflicting thesis in my opinion. So I think you have to start with
3722.24s: defining what thesis you have. So for me, again, I see something that's trending upwards here.
3729.68s: I don't really love REITs right now, but the main reason for that is for those that don't know,
3735.12s: I have a bunch of real estate that I've been building out into over time. So that's a part of the
3740.88s: reason, right? Like I'm not looking for more real estate exposure in the market because I have it off
3746.72s: and in the kind of physical sense. So for me, I wouldn't look to trade this in any sort of
3755.04s: like significant holding capacity. Now the other thing for me is it has earnings coming up.
3760.32s: And I would want to know how it's performed during previous earnings. So we can see
3766.32s: oh, oh, wait, this is a REIT. Now I'm very confused. Now I'm very, very confused.
3782.24s: Because what? Because no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try another platform real quick.
3788.40s: I'm going to grab ORATS. And for those that don't know, I am in affiliate for ORATS. If you like
3796.32s: their platform, you can sign up with a link that's in the notes you get. It's like 50% discount.
3801.60s: It's a good discount. And it's a cool platform. I like it. But let me grab it really quick.
3808.08s: Obviously this isn't sponsored by them. I didn't know that I was going to use the tool, but I thought
3813.20s: that I would give you the background on it. Paul says some reads, pay good dividends. Yeah,
3818.08s: but that's the problem, right? Like again, people fuck up the idea of dividends.
3822.96s: It's I would take capital gains every single day of the week and twice on Sunday over a good dividend.
3829.68s: Like I don't really care about a good dividend. I'm sure this, yeah, this is a great dividend,
3834.24s: right? 8.65%. This is beautiful for the product. But what I care about is the price
3842.88s: performance. And guess what? Like that dividend doesn't help you when you have an underlying that's
3848.16s: gone from fucking 20 down to two back up to seven. So yeah, like literally screw the dividend.
3857.92s: People get too wrapped up about dividends. And I would always take a much lighter dividend,
3863.92s: much lower percentage with something that has much better capital gains. Now that's for total
3869.28s: returns, right? That's not prescriptive for everything. There are scenarios where dividends
3872.88s: might make a ton of sense, but I'm just saying in general. All right. So we need to look at RWT here.
3884.08s: Let's see. So RWT is a shotgun blast.
3893.76s: Yeah. So I don't like it for earnings. I wouldn't trade it for earnings personally.
3899.28s: And so that would mean for me, I would wait until after earnings and see what it does.
3904.88s: Ram Alama. Yo, thank you so much for the donation. Really appreciate it. That will go towards
3909.52s: my dinner tonight, which is going to be Mexican food. Ram Alama says, felt content to enter a
3915.44s: short iron condor. It was GME, which was unsuccessful, but excellent experience observing movements,
3922.24s: thoughts on iron condors. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. So I do not like iron
3929.04s: condors personally. It is not what I would trade at all. So the issue is
3937.44s: they sacrifice too much in too many places. And I do not see them as overall like a favorable
3946.48s: structure pretty much at all. So it's not what I would trade personally is what that boils down to.
3953.12s: Matt says thoughts on ASTS. Let's see.
3965.12s: Oh, this looks good. I mean, this thing is up and out.
3974.72s: So the way I look at something like this is if you didn't get in today, it's getting late.
3982.64s: Like really late. That's how I would do this. So this is okay.
3988.64s: In terms of like a breakout play, but really, this is the day I would want to enter on a breakout
3994.16s: here. And then if I didn't get in on this breakout, I would definitely want to get in. I would
3998.88s: have wanted to be in today because these are lower risk entries. So I don't dislike it. It's
4006.08s: definitely moving and it's moving really well, but it just becomes a higher risk entry that I would
4011.36s: have to manage the risk tighter and tighter in my opinion. So yeah, I don't dislike it.
4016.72s: Paul says they're safe though iron condors. Yeah, who fucking cares, man? Like that's again,
4021.76s: like that's a problem with traders is you guys can get too focused on safe. If you want safe,
4029.44s: put your money in a safe, right? Like if I'm looking for safe, the market is not where I'm going to
4035.68s: take my money. When I'm going to the market with my money, it is for a return. And more often than not,
4042.72s: the reason I get a return is because I'm taking risk. I'm not safe. So like I have a special place
4052.88s: in my heart when I hear traders that are wanting to hedge all their positions, they don't want to
4058.72s: have downside risk. How do I reduce risk? The way you reduce risk chiefly is by sizing trades.
4065.68s: That makes sense for you. That's the first way before you ever put the trade on size the trade.
4071.60s: So it makes sense. That's your first risk reduction tool. Size your trade well. After that,
4078.56s: it's managing the trade. But this like for iron condors, for example, just put on a short
4085.84s: strangle and then manage the short strangle if you need to. So I think the problem is again,
4092.08s: like this obsession with risk aversion. And I think it's a problem.
4098.72s: Ramalamus has preferred strut for sideways moving stock or a bin in that stock and trade something
4102.96s: else. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing in that equation personally. So if there's a sideways
4117.44s: moving stock, I don't care if the price direction is sideways. That's not one of my profit mechanisms
4128.32s: that I leverage as a trader. So when I think about the way I trade, there's a handful of profit
4137.52s: mechanisms, things that are directional or volatility. Right. So like sideways isn't one of these.
4146.24s: And the reason is because if I want to trade something that's going sideways, which is actually
4150.96s: a beautiful segue, great question. I don't know if you realized how good of a question this was,
4156.00s: but it is a perfect segue into the trade that I was going to show you guys in something called path.
4164.40s: There she goes. So what do you guys think I did in here? Why am I talking to you guys about this trade?
4171.20s: Any ideas? Talk to me about what you see. And then I got to talk. I got to step away for just one second.
4201.36s: All right.
4212.48s: Then Wallace says, VRP trade. Yep, you got it. Exactly right. So this is something that is moving sideways.
4221.60s: Right. But the basis or the theory for my trade is not price sideways. Don't really care inherently
4229.92s: if prices sideways. What I do care about though is if something has variance risk,
4238.48s: premium, and this does. So essentially, you can see I highlighted it for you. I have to pull it up
4245.84s: here here is where I entered. It was on the 14th of June. And you can see essentially what I saw
4253.04s: on the 14th of June, which is about right here, just a really, really steady variance risk premium.
4261.20s: And you'll notice that it actually started the variance risk premium for the short term time
4264.96s: frame started building. And for the long term time frame looked completely static. It declined
4270.80s: precipitously due to this drop. But it was still plenty attractive to me. So how did I trade this
4280.96s: position? How do you guys think? How would I have traded variance risk premium in here?
4289.36s: Any ideas? My dog is just like curled up in a little tiny ball. If you guys want me to
4298.40s: bring them on the stream, let me know. I'm always happy to bother them and pick them up.
4303.76s: Short strangle puts. What other guesses we got? Two good guesses so far. Short strangle inputs.
4311.76s: Strattle also great guess. Ruudabega, I'm too dumb for this sir. As a my, I don't blame you. I'm
4317.76s: right right there with you. Elon Song says dog break.
4330.32s: Here he goes. We have to change to the to this. So this is actually from him digging in his bed.
4339.52s: He has like war paint on. He's got some there too. So here he is in all his glory. Say hello to the people.
4352.96s: So he he licked he licked the mic. I think that tells me that he likes you guys. He looks
4361.52s: generally unenthusiated. He kind of noticed the face we got. What?
4368.56s: Good boy. This is Thor. You guys see his mohawk still? He's a cool mohawk. We're a big fan of this.
4384.24s: He doesn't he's not like good at looking at the camera. Notice like whenever I point him
4387.92s: that direction. He like diverts his eyes. But the one thing I would say is he has a tuxedo.
4396.08s: He's more formal literally than all of you guys combined because he essentially is always in his
4402.72s: tuxedo. Fun fact. All right, let's get my face out of the way. Nobody wants to see that.
4411.68s: He long songs that was for you. It was time to see the pup. All right, so back to this fan of
4419.28s: airplanes. I'm also a fan of airplanes provided that they stay in the sky. I do not like airplanes
4424.32s: that fail to do that. Great to see you. But how much correct it was a short strangle. So I offered
4437.28s: the 13 and the 11s at an average of 40 cents. 40 cents. So what does that tell you? Well,
4448.40s: unfortunately, I needed to put on 10 million of them in order to essentially get any sort of
4457.12s: size on that I wanted. But the basis for the trade is literally as simple as it gets. It's
4464.08s: something that showed really good variance or premiums and it still does. So this is still
4470.80s: completely well within play and this is built around or right here. It's literally still in my
4476.96s: variance or premium play scan. So there's different ways that I can come across the positions and
4483.68s: it's generally built based on a portfolio need. So then I'm generally looking for different ideas.
4489.76s: But the big filter here is I don't want stuff with earnings. So you'll notice it doesn't have
4494.24s: earnings coming up. And yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. So just wanted to give you guys an
4499.60s: example. The management of the trade was super simple. All I do is figure out where I want to manage
4505.20s: it to the upside set an alert where I want to manage it to the downside set an alert or rest
4510.48s: orders to close the position either or is completely fine. And then just let it go literally just let
4516.48s: it go. And I ended up taking it to expiration just because it was behaving exceedingly well. But
4522.88s: for these kinds of trades, I very often will manage them early. The only reason for that is because
4529.20s: as you get closer to expiration, things like gamma do start to skyrocket. So the overall return
4537.04s: on risk is not as good in like the last bits of the trade, typically the last week and a half
4543.84s: two weeks. That starts to get not good. The sheet says this is over my head a bit. That's a great
4550.16s: question. So talk to me. What about this is over your head? What questions do you have? That's the
4554.64s: whole point of these. And I'm glad that you spoke up and said that. Rudebega says, what was the DTE?
4560.56s: It's a great question. So the trade was put on 14 June. And it went till 19 July.
4571.44s: So that's the first component to the trade. So is about a month 14 June to 19 July.
4579.84s: Now this one in particular, I ended up keeping for the vast majority of the trade. But like I said,
4586.08s: that's just because it was behaving. So you know that fuzz I picked off my dog's face, he's digging in
4591.44s: his bed again. So, stop. And he has more fuzz on his face. Yep, that sounds perfect. Good for him.
4598.56s: So the sheet, tell me what questions you have. Who's sane sauce? What was your return like?
4606.72s: That's another great question. So the trade was at 40 bucks. So let's just call it 40 per lot.
4617.36s: The sheet says variance, risk premium. What is it? Great question. So the first thing I'm going to do
4623.20s: is actually give you a video that you can go deeper into detail on the concept. But I will summarize
4629.84s: it for you. Simply put, variance risk premium is the tendency for implied volatility to be higher
4639.92s: than realized volatility. So that means that there is a risk premium being priced into the options
4649.44s: where we're pricing in a higher vol. Obviously expecting slightly higher volatility than we realize.
4659.20s: So that leads to an opportunity. That's the general concept behind that. So great question. And
4667.12s: that's precisely what it is. As always, again, like if you have follow-ups on that, just let me know.
4671.04s: I'm happy to dive in. Now to figure out what this was, not HV. HV is the same thing. So in this context,
4683.28s: as I'm framing it, realized vol is historic volatility. Same thing. Now, volatility can be really
4689.12s: quirky in that there are different kinds of realized vol. You can have future realized vol,
4696.48s: which is kind of weird. But you don't have to worry about that. I actually think in
4704.72s: I think in one of the earlier videos we did, but let me see. I think I have a video that really
4709.68s: goes into volatility pretty deep. Yeah, here you go. So this video goes a bit deeper into the concept
4720.24s: of volatility so that you can kind of see. Tom says, how do you go about picking an expiration for
4728.16s: the type of trade and how do you see VRP for a certain amount of time before placing the trade?
4732.72s: Yeah, so I can care about persistence or magnitude of VRP that will depend a little bit on the
4739.68s: opportunity itself. So in this case, it's a little bit of both. I saw persistence over time and
4747.28s: and then in terms of expiration, that's more about the portfolio. It's less so about the individual
4751.84s: trade. But like if there's earnings coming up, obviously, I'll see how I feel about the earnings.
4757.52s: If there are other trades that are going to be coming down, it's mostly going to come down to
4762.80s: how is this thing going to fit into the portfolio. VRP plays, there's sloppy, right? I'm not really
4768.00s: trying to maximize each element of the individual position because I'm just expecting to put on a
4773.12s: fair number of these things, have a fair number of them work like total shit and in the aggregate,
4778.08s: have them make money. So it's an important differentiation, I think. But yeah, DTE, I think to give you
4792.72s: at least something resembling an answer would be something between two weeks and 45 days, 50 days,
4801.12s: something like that. I think that that's fair. The sheet says, or more important, let me see,
4806.88s: the sheet says so IV above HV is basically on the indicator, you know, that's exactly it. Or more
4812.40s: importantly, the change in IV versus HV versus before, great questions. And the first one is that's
4818.16s: correct. So this indicator is literally plotting a few different things. It's plotting imply
4825.12s: volatility for different time frames. The plots you see here are for a week and then a month.
4831.52s: And then these white lines are historic or realize volatility, past volatility. And you can see
4841.84s: there's two different time frames. The dark is like 30 day realized. And then this is five day or
4849.12s: one week realized. And then the purple lines with red, those are actually tracking the variance
4854.48s: between those two. That's variance risk premiums. So notice how between this bright yellow and
4860.80s: this white line really big gap. And then you can see between the bright pink, how it turns super
4866.00s: red. It's essentially that like the near perfect inverse of this. So that's essentially what that
4872.80s: indicator is showing me, showing me volatility so that I can visualize it. Benoit, I won't get tired
4880.08s: of that name, Benoit. So hilarious name. It reminds me of Archer. I don't remember if the dude's name
4886.32s: is Benoit, balls, whatever that guy was, but that's what it reminds me of. Benoit says, what's the
4892.16s: most appropriate profit mechanism to focus on capital preservation of a small account? Okay, well,
4898.08s: I personally don't like those, right? Like the idea of capital preservation in a small account.
4903.76s: If the goal is to preserve capital, it would be like dollar cost averaging into an index ETF using
4909.84s: some sort of moving average momentum following strategy to play positive drift. That's kind of the
4915.60s: the way to preserve capital. Now, beyond that, assuming that we want to trade and depending on what
4920.56s: small capital means, let's just call it like sub hundred thousand something like that. Then
4927.52s: in that scenario, if the goal is to like really try to grow the portfolio, which would be my approach,
4933.12s: would be trying to grow without having massive drawdowns would be primarily direction strategies.
4938.64s: So things like ratio diagonals, I have an old series on the playlist from, it was called small stacks
4946.88s: and it's still there. That one hasn't gotten nuked yet, but that one goes through this entire
4953.44s: process of trading a small account. Now, I traded both the coverage strangle and the ratio
4958.48s: diagonal, the ratio diagonal provided a much better return in that portfolio, but the coverage
4962.96s: strangle provided a little bit of like a keel where my P&L wasn't highly volatile because I
4970.40s: had capital committed to that. So yeah, that's essentially the way that I would think about it.
4976.56s: I personally would be trading ratio diagonals and believe it or not, I have a video on this exact
4983.60s: thing for like what account or what strategies I would use in a small account, which is right here.
4991.04s: So you can check that video out. And then I funny enough, the small stacks segment pops up.
4996.72s: So I'll give you the first video in that segment here. And then it looks like there's 16 parts.
5005.76s: It was a three month experiment. I made 26.85% over the three months. So not terrible, not great,
5016.40s: but we still have money. So that part's cool, I guess. That's not so bad.
5025.04s: Behemoths says what delta do you use for strangles? It's not a fixed thing. It's highly dependent
5030.24s: on the individual product. I would say general bans though would be anything from 40 delta's out to
5039.60s: five. If I had to ballpark an average, it would probably be like 30, I think is a fair average normal
5050.56s: go to delta. But it is a specific metric. It's not something that standardize just blindly. And again,
5057.60s: like I know what you guys are trying to do and it makes total sense to do that, where essentially
5062.16s: we're trying to come up with like simplified heuristics for how to use these things.
5069.28s: But the problem with that with options is that is another, it's another bias that you have
5078.80s: to find it one second. It might not be on here.
5092.56s: Anyways, there's another bias essentially where we seek to oversimplify things.
5098.40s: And I think that's partially what that is. Like just trying to come up like what DTE to use or what
5108.64s: what delta to use. Like I said, I totally, totally understand the origin of the questions.
5113.84s: But it essentially will always be a variable component to some degree. And the reason for that is
5121.12s: that that's the whole concept behind options is to have that kind of variability. Because without it,
5131.84s: right, like if you didn't care about any of that stuff, all you would do then is trade the
5138.08s: simplest expression which would typically be the underlying itself. Let me see what that bias is
5144.48s: called. I can't. Oh, fallacy of a single cause. Oh no, that's not it.
5161.84s: My bad. I'm not sure what it's called. I have to figure it out. But essentially it's just
5166.00s: oversimplification. That's the, oh, I think it's attribution. Is that it?
5172.88s: Oh, let me see. Do I even have that in here? I don't.
5177.68s: Ooh, we have another one we need to add. Yeah, I think it's attribution.
5192.64s: Oh, no, not really. Damn. Damn, damn, damn. My bad. I thought I, I thought I knew it. I can't remember.
5201.84s: Simplicity or reductive bias? Is it simplicity?
5209.44s: Simplicity bias. So I'm not sure if that's actually like a standard bias.
5215.76s: Reductive, I think. Yeah, okay. So reductive bias. Thank you. That's what it's called. Thank
5228.40s: you very much. Yeah, I was going to say I like I recently came across a bunch of these, right?
5233.44s: Like as I was building out that page and I'll actually add that one for you guys as well.
5239.84s: But yeah, essentially when we try to oversimplify a lot of those components, we lose a lot of the
5247.84s: details associated with them that kind of make them what they are because they actually are kind of
5254.40s: these, I would honestly, I would almost call them like magical concepts because the cool thing about
5262.16s: options is that there's a lot of variability that go into them. And in my opinion, that's
5270.40s: that's kind of the benefit of them is that you can very, very carefully structure them to be what
5276.08s: you want them to be. So yeah, I think in this context, you can come up with general heuristics,
5283.28s: which again, it's normal. And I think it's a good thing to do because in doing that, you
5288.32s: essentially simplify the way that we're analyzing information so that it's more palatable.
5294.08s: But I think it's also important to make sure that we identify like what components make the most
5300.96s: sense for what we're trying to do. And then make sure that we're prioritizing the correct
5308.88s: components. So like for example, when I hear something about the Delta selection, you guys tell me,
5314.96s: when you're selecting a Delta, what's the trade off? Let's say that we're picking the same
5319.60s: expiration, same product, all everything else is the exact same. But what's the trade off when
5324.64s: you're picking Delta's? There's a few things that come to mind to me.
5331.92s: So
5343.12s: price to risk ratio, that's part of it for sure. Think of things like
5349.20s: how much money you can make. Think about things like risk. Think about things like management.
5356.00s: Right? So what happens if I sell a 40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle? What are the
5364.88s: things that you guys can think of? And I want you to specifically to think about the overall
5369.12s: P and all of the position. I want you guys to think about how the path of that position will look.
5376.16s: 40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle. You guys tell me what's the difference?
5380.24s: Depreciation, that's not it. It's a good guess, but that's not it.
5385.52s: Risk of assignment, that's part of it.
5408.48s: Bingo, Tom has it. Tom, Tom summarized it really well.
5419.68s: So what Tom is highlighting is that you can make more money, but you're in a scenario where it's
5430.80s: much more likely to give you problems. What's another thing? So let's take a look. Let's take a
5437.92s: look in here, for an example, and let's say that we're looking at something that's like 45 days
5442.08s: out. Let's just pretend that these were liquid. You have to use the monthly. Fine. We'll just use
5445.52s: the 21 days. So using the 21 days, what do you guys notice about this 36 Delta put as compared to
5454.16s: this? I don't know why these are, oh, because the 10 and a half is to like this 14 Delta or 10 Delta
5460.96s: or something like that. There's another really important component. There's another Greek that you
5465.52s: guys need to look at. Gamma, bingo, that's exactly correct. That's exactly correct. It's gamma.
5488.16s: So the reason why we care about gamma is because that tells us that the path of our returns
5496.72s: has the potential to be super painful. If you have an option that has a higher gamma,
5504.16s: it tells us that its Delta's can move a lot, and it tells us that the overall position will move
5511.04s: tremendously more. So if you take a look at this 36 Delta option here, it is a gamma of 28.
5518.88s: If you take a look at the 14, 10 Delta, whatever this actually is because the options are kind of messed
5522.72s: up here, this one has a gamma of eight. So that means for every one point move in the underlying,
5533.28s: down here, your deltas are going to move by 28. And for every one point move in the underlying
5540.32s: here, your deltas are going to move by eight. Much, much, much different behavior of the position.
5548.16s: So that's why the decision of selecting deltas matters a lot. And that's why there's not a set
5554.80s: answer on what Delta to pick for something like a Strangle because it heavily depends on the product.
5560.40s: It heavily depends on how this thing fits into your portfolio and how you want to manage it.
5564.48s: Those are all the nuanced details. So for example, let's say that, I mean, let's literally go
5570.88s: through an example. But before that, actually, let's take a quick look. We already saw this one
5577.60s: on this idea of how much effort goes into being successful. I think we already talked about that.
5585.52s: We can kind of, this is perfect timing. We've talked about a bunch of those already. We can skip over
5591.52s: that. Here, this is a great one. So we actually talked about this before. So do you guys remember
5600.32s: when who was it? Somebody was asking about that stock that we were looking at the re and they
5613.92s: said, what do you think about a vertical in there? That's this, right? So that's a really,
5620.56s: really common error and issue that traders will make. It's literally quintessential. It's
5627.60s: like so common, right? That's why it's here. That whoever I did that example with, they did this
5633.44s: exact thing where we focus on some element of a structure and not on the profit mechanism.
5644.24s: So the misconception here is that a structure somehow makes a trade profitable.
5649.84s: And it doesn't. A structure is just a way to capture a profit mechanism.
5656.40s: Profit mechanism is what makes us money. So that's actually a great example of what we were
5664.40s: reviewing before. Now, to take this example into this example now, this idea of a profit mechanism,
5671.12s: if we're thinking about trading VRP, let's just pick something random.
5679.04s: MSOS looks okay. That I don't love. GME looks great, but this is a unicorn. I would not have
5688.48s: naked options and it's same thing with Chui. Let's use something like MSOS. We use something
5695.84s: slightly different. So MSOS, let's say that we want to structure a variance risk premium trade in
5701.84s: here. Let's just say for whatever reason we like it, it doesn't look bad to me. And it doesn't have
5706.72s: earnings coming up too soon. It doesn't look like. So now let me just double check really quick.
5713.44s: I'm going to change this time frame so that it is just a little further out. Yeah. So it doesn't
5723.84s: have earnings coming up just yet. So we have a little bit of time here. So let's say we want to
5728.80s: structure our strangle. Let's say that we want to keep it in a primary expiration and we're stuck
5736.00s: between two. You can either do 21 or 56. Neither one of these are optimal. So for me,
5742.24s: depending on how the portfolio fits and all that kind of stuff, I'm going to trend towards this
5746.40s: one, the 56. A little bit longer in duration, but for this style trade, I don't care about that.
5755.28s: And it's for a bunch of different things. Now opening this up, let's see what's in here.
5766.08s: Benoit says pot ETF could be affected by political, of course. Yeah, that's the thing is everything
5772.40s: as risks, right? Yeah. And I obviously appreciate the call out, but that doesn't matter to me.
5777.60s: I'm coming in here literally to make money. So I expect to take risk. So if we take a look at
5786.56s: something like this 32 delta and this 32 delta and we plot this. Now again, this is in a pass through
5795.52s: account that doesn't have any money. And the reason why that matters is because this is not a
5800.88s: portfolio margin account. So we can see what the margin of requirement would be for most people,
5806.00s: which is super cheap, $837. So in this case, we'd be taking in about 83 bucks and we're putting up,
5815.76s: let's just call it like 850, something like that. So it gives you a 9.8% return over that 56 days.
5823.20s: Now that does tell me that the risk in this is elevated because that is a pretty high return.
5829.28s: Now the other thing I need to see is how do I want to manage this? Well, my break even to the
5834.16s: downside is let's call it six six bucks, something like that. And that puts me at a 45 dollar loss
5846.80s: if we get there. And to the upside, it's about let's call it 10 bucks a little bit less than that.
5854.24s: Like 986. And that puts us at an $80 loss. So now I can go through the process of seeing what the
5863.04s: probabilities is of those being hit, which is super simple. We do that in here. Based on that
5869.04s: information, I validate that the risk makes sense compared to where I would be managing the trade.
5874.56s: And then let's just assume that it makes sense 986 down to six. I would come in here and I would
5880.40s: say, okay, I need to start getting out of this trade if it gets up to 986. So let's call it 970.
5889.44s: I need an alert for up or above that. And then down to six, I need an alert a little higher than
5895.68s: that. Give me a minute to see it. So give it like 614, something like that. At or below that.
5904.56s: And then trade goes off. So then the other scenario would be, okay, maybe I can trade this.
5914.80s: What is this? A 14 delta and this 14 delta. And we can compare this in this case.
5922.08s: I am making 30. So I'm making quite a bit less than the 83 that I would see. And if we have a move
5936.88s: against us again, break even to the downside is about 570. And at that point, I would be losing 43
5943.52s: bucks. And to the upside break even is at 1130. And I'd be losing about 123 bucks. So the first
5951.84s: thing you'll notice is I have better break evens. But I have worse severity when I get there.
5958.00s: That is everything to do with the fact that I've collected way less money. I collect it only 30 bucks
5962.88s: as compared to 83. What's the payoff here? I have a much higher probability of this trade working out.
5968.56s: So let's just use the worst scenario for a quick example. Let's say to the upside, my risk is at
5974.72s: 1130. And I would be realizing a $124 loss. So if we look at 1130, the probability of hitting that
5984.32s: in 20 September, look at the probability of a touch. What's the probability of us hitting 1130?
5992.00s: 17.8% probability of being stopped out to the upside within our time frame. And then I forgot
6001.28s: what it was in the other trade. It was like nine something, right?
6006.48s: 971 I think it was like 980. So let's say in the same time frame, what's the probability of us hitting
6012.56s: 980? 37% chance. So there's a much higher probability of being stopped out in this trade than this
6022.56s: trade. But you make more in this trade than you do in this trade. So now that's taking it to
6028.96s: expiration. If I wanted to analyze, okay, I don't want to take it all the way to expiration. Let's say
6034.96s: that I hold it until there's maybe 14 days left, something like that, something about two weeks.
6041.52s: So something around here. What's the probability then? If instead of managing it at the equivalent
6048.08s: of this 20 September expiration, I'm managing it in the same DTE equivalent. If I were to leave two
6053.68s: weeks left, which would put me here at like the 30 aug. Now what's the probability of me hitting that
6060.40s: 980? That probability is now 27% chance. And then the 1130 is like a 9.7% chance.
6077.12s: So this is the game. And you have to figure out what makes the most sense. There is absolutely no
6084.48s: right or wrong answer. But that's the exact process you can go through to see what makes sense.
6091.68s: Let me know if the answer is a question for you guys.
6095.92s: Hussein says, would you consider Delta for regular options calls puts? Of course, Delta is one of
6101.52s: the primary inputs for literally every single trade that goes on unequivocally. The sheet says all
6107.76s: things equal look for the highest ratio of Delta gamma. No, not at all. That will change massively.
6114.00s: Again, depending on the disposition, what I'm trying to trade the underlying thesis. So I would
6120.64s: not personally look for that. No, it's a good guess. But yeah.
6134.40s: Tom says, if I myself picking Delta based on strikes that align with my perception of support
6139.28s: and resistance, yeah, it doesn't matter. So like picking the Delta at those levels doesn't matter.
6150.96s: Because again, like that's not necessarily where the trade management is. You could essentially
6156.96s: think about the idea of structuring the trade so that you would manage it at those support
6163.92s: and resistance levels. So let's say for example, you thought resistance was at 907 and you would want
6171.28s: to get out for something that is above that. You can do that. You can structure your position so
6179.12s: that it makes sense for management. But make that selection based off Delta and putting your Delta
6185.68s: where you think that is to me. It's not, it doesn't make sense. It doesn't align. Unless you're
6191.76s: just managing it when it gets to the strike inherently. But again, that's not how I do it. But if
6197.20s: you were doing it that way, then it at least would make more sense. Benoit says, what time of day do
6204.40s: you typically put on trades for new positions? This is a great question. Typically towards the end of
6208.32s: the day, it depends on for a new position, like a net new position. If I manage and trade, sometimes
6214.96s: it'll be throughout the day, kind of whenever it comes up. And then I do put trades on and off in
6220.32s: the morning again, like sometimes people I think they get too binary when we have conversations
6225.52s: like this. So it's important to reiterate that it's not that I never put trades on earlier, but I
6231.76s: typically will put them on towards the end of the day. There's a different kind of liquidity that
6236.08s: happens then. And you miss the first hour illiquidity and volatility rush, which I don't, I don't
6242.48s: want to be a part of just because you get way sloppier fills. So unless there's a specific reason
6249.68s: for me to get filled or to enter at those times, I typically avoid it.
6256.24s: Iceman says, when managing a trade that touches your break evens, do you consider the amount of days
6263.68s: that have passed prior to it touching? That is how quickly it touches. No. So I assume we're talking
6272.56s: about this trade that we were looking at. So specifically looking at the idea of like a short
6279.52s: strangle like a variance risk premium style trade, because the reason why I'm coming with that
6283.28s: assumption is because that answer also would depend entirely on the strategy and what's being
6288.72s: traded. But if I have something that hits the management point, then I would manage the trade.
6296.88s: It doesn't matter if it happens quick. It doesn't matter if it happens later. When it's time to
6301.44s: manage that position, that's why those things get defined before entry. And it has to marry up to
6307.60s: the thesis. It's really, really important for those things to line up.
6313.84s: To me says, how about picking bygama? No. I wouldn't pick bygama. I would have no issue for
6323.20s: like obviously heavily including gammas. So like for example, if I am trying to trade a long
6330.72s: call strategy that includes an element that might rapidly expand the basis, what I would refer
6337.52s: to them as kicker options, then the gamea matters a lot. That is an important decision component
6343.92s: of that position. But I wouldn't pick just off of gamma because I still would prioritize things
6350.56s: like delta. So yeah, their gamma can have heavier waiting in some instances. But I don't think I
6359.84s: would base a trade completely off of it personally. Behemoth says, is it important to be mechanical
6367.36s: buying back options like the tasty method of 50% profit? That's a great question. What do you guys
6372.32s: think? If you guys were to answer Behemoth's question with him or to explore that concept, what do
6378.88s: you guys think? Because there's a few things that come to my mind with that specific thing.
6386.48s: Chewie says kicker gamma is so higher gamma number? Yeah, exactly. So if I'm adding kicker options,
6391.92s: which are lower probability of payout but a higher compounding capability, I would use things
6397.28s: that I've hired gamma. Tom says, based on the expectancy of the trade, that's part of it. That's
6402.16s: actually not the first part in my opinion, but that's definitely as part of it. What else do you guys
6408.80s: think? Depends on your portfolio. That's a great component. And you guys are, I'm converting you
6416.00s: guys to be it depends people. So you too will piss off everybody that asks you a simple question
6422.88s: when you respond with it depends. Shane says, based on what I've been told, having a set rules
6429.60s: is beneficial. Can be I agree? So here's what I would say. I think it depends on the
6438.40s: strategy as you design it. So if you have a strategy that's a little more geared towards discretionary,
6448.96s: I don't think being purely mechanical is good. And I think the trader needs to maintain discretion.
6455.52s: However, it also cannot be a random selection of things. So the way I look at that is I make sure
6466.88s: that whatever rules set I'm applying generally makes sense. That's the first thing.
6474.80s: So the next thing is to make sure exactly as Tom highlighted, because if your strategy is
6486.08s: baked on taking 50% profit, that's okay. But it needs to have an effective expected return based
6496.00s: on that parameter. So the first decision that really depends on what route I would take that
6505.20s: answer is if we're trying to devise a more mechanical strategy, if it's more mechanical, then yes,
6511.28s: we need to decide how that mechanic mechanical approach will play out. If it's a more discretionary
6518.24s: approach than no, then I think that that can actually be a problem and it needs to be a little more
6524.16s: individualized to the opportunity. The issue that you have with things like taking things at a
6529.84s: blanket 50% profit is it really does depend on how you're managing the losing side of the trade and
6536.24s: does it maintain positive expected return. Paulus says why 50% and not 30 or 80? The reason why
6546.32s: places like tasty trade do that is because they're trying to provide people a generally
6553.52s: applicable set of rules to simplify things. That's why. So when you think about something like why
6563.60s: 50% is because it applies to a lot of strategies in a lot of circumstances where it generally is okay.
6572.40s: It loses a lot of specificity, which obviously I look for, I care about the details. So that's why I
6580.08s: don't do something like that. Now for me, if I'm trading a more mechanical variation of something
6584.88s: like my zero DTE SPX strategies, for those kinds of things, I have a more mechanical profit taking
6591.92s: approach applied and it's because it's like a numerically based strategies the same thing with
6597.84s: things like earnings plays. But for things like ratio diagonals where there's a lot more discretion
6604.56s: involved, I don't apply that same methodology. So it does depend quite a lot on the strategy.
6612.72s: It's a good question though.
6617.68s: Fanta Veraplane says, Hey, do you think GME is a good spot to write covered calls? I am
6621.92s: conflicted because IV keeps dropping, but I would like to make some money while the stock trade sideways.
6626.72s: I mean, yeah, if you have long shares and you want to write calls against them, then that's okay.
6633.36s: The component of IV contracting, that's one component of the trade, but like GameStop still has
6640.80s: high IV. It's 90 and a half percent. So you're going to get still a completely healthy return for
6647.52s: selling calls. Now to your point, you're not going to make as much if IVP were higher, but that
6654.16s: still doesn't mean that you're not going to make money. You still absolutely will make money.
6658.64s: Provided that it does what you want, meaning not go blow through your short strike,
6663.28s: then obviously the short call will lose. But when trading something like covered calls for me,
6670.08s: volatility, specifically IVP or the relative volatility level, it's secondary. I don't care
6676.32s: as much about that. As long as I'm getting a decent amount of money as far as I can see,
6681.52s: on what I'm capping in terms of upside potential and I'm okay with that trade off, then it's fine.
6687.36s: But I wouldn't not make that kind of trade just because implied volatility is low and it might
6696.24s: go against you temporarily because that doesn't really matter. If you're going to hold the trade,
6701.36s: then it still would make the money. It just would be a potential loser in the interim.
6707.04s: So yeah, I wouldn't care about that at all.
6709.68s: Next question. Our next misconception, options are too risky. You guys should know the answer to
6718.00s: this one by now. It's not that options are too risky or not risky enough. It is simply that
6724.00s: options take whatever risk you give them. That's it. It's literally all there is to this. You can
6731.04s: structure options trades that are very risky. You can structure options trades that are not risky at
6737.20s: all. It's completely up to the way you build the trade. This one you guys should know about as well.
6745.12s: So if you're buying a long call or a long put, there's a widely misunderstood concept that the
6753.12s: stock price has to go to the strike price in order for you to make money. And that's not the case.
6760.80s: Why is that not the case? And in the meantime, I'm going to answer silly Russians.
6768.00s: Which is just hopped on. I want to say I love you in noon. Yeah, noon is awesome.
6772.32s: Any tips on how to stop being a greedy degenerate? It can be very self sabotaging with a tiny
6777.52s: cash account. Yeah. I think for that, it comes down to developing a better, a better road map for
6784.96s: yourself that you respect. If you do not have respect for the road map that you've built for yourself,
6791.20s: then there's no real incentive for you to follow it, especially if you're the kind of person to
6796.24s: think that this short term price movement can essentially change your life and that you should
6802.00s: put all your money on it. The way I think about it is if you develop a road map that you're highly,
6808.08s: highly convicted in, then it's much easier to make those shorter term sacrifices and stuff like that
6816.16s: and to focus on the broader plan. So what does that look like? Really simple. Not that.
6822.00s: I'm trying to grab this.
6830.08s: It looks like this. If I'm 21 and I have $15,000 saved and by the time I'm 35,
6841.60s: I know I want to have over a million bucks. Well, it tells me a few things. It tells me I'm going to
6852.16s: need to have a better rate of return and it tells me I'm going to need to get really good at saving money.
6859.44s: So if I get to the point where on average, I'm able to save $1,000 a month over the course of 14
6868.64s: years and my return, I can target something around 15% on close, but not quite. So you can see if I save
6882.16s: just $100 more per month, I would be at $640,000. So depending on what this number feels like to you,
6892.32s: then and again, it's important because when you're 21, will you be able to put this away? Probably not.
6898.40s: Depending on how much money you make at 21, but it's probably not going to be enough to support that.
6902.56s: But what I'm talking about is this on average because you had better believe by the time in your
6907.92s: late 20s, early 30s, you should be putting away way more than this. And if you're not doing that,
6914.24s: you're not living essentially a viable lifestyle for your broader objectives. And you need to go into
6921.52s: what I like to call monk mode. That's what I spent most of my early 20s and what I call monk mode.
6927.04s: And it's so that I could really amplify this and maximize my contributions as much as humanly possible.
6934.64s: So then you could say, well, maybe I am able to save that extra $100 a month, makes a pretty big
6940.08s: difference. And now let's say you look at a slightly different return variance profile where you
6945.76s: say, well, plus or minus 3%, how can I do? And well, you realize if you're able to do 3% better
6952.64s: than this 15 and that puts you at 18, now you're at $823,000. This takes somebody from a $15,000
6961.44s: account saving on average $11,000, which is a lot. But again, if you're able to get to this point
6968.88s: and compensate later in your compounding approach on average, it'll still work out for you.
6974.80s: Then over a 14 year time span, by the time you're in your mid 30s, you can be very close to
6983.28s: having that million dollars. So then the other thing you could say, well, maybe instead of when I'm
6987.76s: 30, I could maybe do it, well, instead of 35, maybe I could do it when I'm 40. So that'll take us
6994.40s: here. And now all of a sudden, that's now completely possible. And you have $1.3 million. So then we
7000.96s: could say, well, instead of then saving that much money on a monthly basis, maybe I save $800,
7006.80s: which is even more doable, but you've given yourself a longer runway. So what I'm highlighting
7012.08s: is going through this process. You literally can use this tool. It's why I fucking built it on my
7016.80s: website because I use this all the time myself. But it'll give you a lot of clarity. So then going
7022.72s: all the way back to this idea of like being a greedy degenerate. Well, if I realize that the path
7028.56s: of being a greedy degenerate can include stuff like this where I might have really good years,
7036.80s: but then if I have one not good year, it actually can really derail my growth.
7043.44s: So for example, portfolio one here, both starting with $100,000, portfolio one has a 10% return,
7049.76s: 10% 2%, 10% 5%. The best year in portfolio one does not outperform the worst positive return
7062.16s: from portfolio three. They both have generally positive years, but portfolio three is one negative
7068.96s: year. That one negative year, even though they have a better average return of 8.6%, their compound
7076.24s: annual growth rate is 6.87% over this five year period. So what I'm highlighting is that this drawdown
7085.12s: is a massive problem because this drawdown of 25%, it needs a 33.3% return to recover back to
7094.24s: break even. So when you make these mistakes as a greedy new trader trying to grow a small amount
7100.80s: of money into a big amount of money, the only thing we do is move the goalpost backwards.
7108.32s: That's it. So that's the way and that's really the general tip and advice I would give to
7116.32s: somebody that's struggling with that is to develop a process in a roadmap that you believe in,
7124.08s: that you're comfortable with, that you're willing to commit to and then commit to it because
7131.92s: the world of trading is interesting. In my early 20s, when I compared myself to all of my friends,
7138.88s: I was actually worse off than a lot of them. And then in my mid 20s, I started noticing a little
7144.96s: bit of a difference. Then in my late 20s, I started noticing a pretty big difference. Now in my
7149.68s: early 30s, I noticed a massive difference between me and most of my friends.
7156.56s: Where at completely different places financially. And it's because of adherence to this,
7163.68s: while a lot of them in their early 20s were fucking around. They wanted to go out to the bars,
7169.60s: have a bunch of fun, which I get that. That's really attractive. That's super fun.
7174.40s: But it's really difficult to essentially become a self-made millionaire without making sacrifices
7182.48s: of some sort. They got to come from somewhere. And if you want to do that in a relatively
7190.40s: compressed time frame, like by your late 20s or early 30s, you have to sacrifice even more.
7198.88s: But if you do, it can be very worth it. That's the tip. That's the advice.
7207.52s: Create a plan that you truly believe in and then prioritize the plan. It's exactly what I would do.
7214.56s: It's exactly what I did. I think that that works exceedingly well. Let me know if that answers your
7221.92s: question, silly Russian. Now going back to this, who saying says, because of things such as time
7230.96s: volatility, price movement, up or down, that's not it actually. The reason why this is a
7237.60s: common misconception and why this doesn't matter is like, you don't need the underlying to go
7243.04s: to your strike to make money on a long option. As long as it goes in your direction,
7248.88s: the option will make money. Again, Ceterus Parabus, everything else remaining the same. Let's look at
7254.08s: an example. If we look at, let's go to Tesla. And let's go here to 25 June.
7267.92s: Let's buy. This might be even better actually. Let's go to the 12th, something that's not as
7288.24s: aggressive of a move. Because then the 13th, there is a decent size move. Let's see.
7298.56s: So here, I just got such a good hip hop. It's like that really satisfying crack.
7306.48s: And now my nose is super itchy. I realize that when I talk a lot, my nose gets itchy. I don't know
7312.00s: what that is. I actually think it's like my nose hairs that are vibrating too much. Fun fact,
7318.48s: by the way. All right, let's see these options. And then let's do something that's like 37 days out.
7328.80s: And let's pick out of the money option. Let's pick these 190s.
7334.40s: So let's pretend that those got put on for like 590. Now let's fast forward to the 13th.
7342.32s: Let's see what happened here. So on the 13th, we had a little gap up, a little bit of
7356.96s: wall because we gapped up and started closing back down. But you can see we're not at our strike.
7363.36s: Our strike, I think, was 190, something like that. Yeah. But look what happened.
7372.80s: We got in for 590. It's trading for 1120 now.
7379.12s: This option made a decent amount of money. Yet it did not hit our strike.
7385.84s: It went in the correct direction. The other thing notice, this isn't some really short term dated
7392.88s: option. These are 36 DTE options. And this is looking at the passage of a single day.
7402.16s: Yet the trade made money. How is that? It's because you don't need the underlying to go to your strike
7413.44s: in order to make money. Like that's literally the punchline to this. It doesn't need to do that.
7419.92s: You can make money with this kind of position as long as you get in a accommodating move. This is
7426.08s: another really common misconception. All right. We got another question here from Paulo. When do you
7433.52s: roll a strangle into a straddle versus realize loss? I don't really roll them into straddles very
7438.40s: much. And realizing a loss typically happens at the predefined PNL target. I don't bother rolling
7449.12s: things like straddles or strangles too frequently. If it's not working, it's not working. I'll close the
7455.60s: trade except that it didn't work and then just move on to another trade. Something like that.
7461.92s: There's not a giant benefit to me to keep attempting to force the trade to work.
7470.48s: I tend to take slightly more care in terms of how I'm selecting PNL targets and stuff like that.
7477.36s: That's not to say again that I never will roll, but that's definitely just not my go to.
7483.76s: I typically will do a slightly simpler approach on setting targets ahead of time.
7491.36s: Next one. Buying is better than selling your vice versa. This is one of the most common
7496.72s: misconceptions I see. There is this wild misconception that theta is some sort of edge.
7504.48s: That's another kind of tied version of this. So if one was better than the other, why would anybody
7514.00s: do the other? Just doesn't make sense. So the way to think about buying or selling is they both
7523.76s: have their strengths and weaknesses. They both have their pros and their cons. But one is not inherently
7531.20s: better than the other. They do different things. That's the way to think about that.
7537.92s: This is a really common one. You guys, I bet you some of you probably think this right now.
7542.32s: There's 40 of you on the stream right now. My guess is at least one of you probably think this
7548.16s: that if you're selling options that going further out of the money is safer.
7554.16s: What does that mean to you? And why do you think I might frame it as that might not be the truth?
7561.60s: That might not be the case. Any ideas? And then silly Russian says absolutely going to
7568.48s: dive in your resources. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great. There's a lot that you can do. If I were
7574.48s: in your shoes, silly Russian, you can check out like my 101 playlists. I think that's where I would go.
7587.20s: So silly Russian, this one. Benoit says it's just less likely to happen, but when it does, it will
7593.36s: be worse. Will it be worse though? So for example, let's flip the script here.
7604.64s: Let's look at here. 22 April to 29 April. Let's go there real quick. 22 April. Let's say we
7618.00s: sell a call. We know it's going to go up. Let's sell a call. We'll sell two calls.
7622.24s: Because Benoit, what you're seeing actually is not fully correct. And I want to show you why.
7638.88s: So in this case, let's pick a 30 Delta short here. Let me, I'm going to throw this in the chat
7649.76s: so that I remember. So the 155 calls is at 440. We'll just do it at the natural price.
7659.28s: So we'll do the sell to open here. And these are a 31 Delta. So 0.31 Delta.
7669.76s: Now let's take a look at these ones.
7672.72s: So to open the 190 calls, you're going to get 53 cents for those. And then those are at a 0, 0, 5 Delta.
7692.56s: Cool. Now, let's go forward. What is it like a week to the 29th, I said?
7702.96s: Cool. That's right. Let's see what happens here.
7717.04s: So our 5 Delta's, which were the 190's here, they become 47 Delta's.
7728.16s: And they represent essentially like 785, something like that.
7740.48s: So now we sold something for 53. We got to buy it back for 785. So that's a negative 7732.
7758.48s: loss on the 0, 0, 5 Delta. Now let's take a look at these 155's. These are now trading for 3282.
7771.04s: So we sold something for 440. And we have to close it out for 3282. That's a negative 2842.
7783.04s: Negative 2842 on the 31 Delta. So what do you guys think about that? Does that align with what
7800.48s: Benoit showed us? It does not. Why is that? Why does it behave that way? There's a few things
7815.36s: you have to pay attention to. Benoit says, but the position size was very different. The risk
7820.56s: capital wasn't the same. It's a one lot for both. So the margin requirement for both of these is
7827.60s: not going to be wildly different. It will be different to your point, but I don't think it will
7832.32s: be wildly different. Let's double check. So we went back in time again. We're going to check at
7837.84s: these. What is the 155's? Yeah. Let's see what the margin requirement is for these.
7841.92s: These want 2600 bucks. Now let's take a look at the 05's. These want 2,100 bucks. So no, I also
7861.60s: disagree with you there, Benoit. The position size is actually not that different. This is
7866.72s: T margin. They're going to require very, very similar sizes based on a naked short call that are
7871.84s: only this far apart. So also good guess, but also incorrect. It's super simple. The reason why these
7890.24s: don't lose more money as a gross dollar amount is because they have a lower delta.
7896.88s: It's literally the start of the trade because remember, these 155's are going to have a higher
7905.84s: gamma and a higher delta. So after we get that first $1 move against us, these 155's are going to
7918.00s: move against us $31. These 5's are only going to move against us $5. That's it. That's on the
7928.72s: first $1 move. The gamma on these super far out of the money options hasn't started to change
7936.96s: that much yet. So maybe on that next dollar move, you only lose 5 bucks again. In this case,
7944.08s: your gamma already gained one gamma. So your 31 delta's became 32. So you lost 31 bucks on the
7951.28s: first point move. Now 32 bucks on the second point move. So you have what? 63 bucks lost on a
7959.20s: two point move. $10 loss, two point move. It's exactly why that the severity on these is not going
7968.00s: to be as bad because they're further away. Now the caveat here is that the return on the risk
7977.52s: is slightly different because these you're only collecting 50 cents. These you're collecting $4
7983.44s: and change. So the return on the risk has a slightly different profile. But the further out of
7990.56s: the money, that that's the tradeoff. That's why you make so much less is because there's a lot less
7997.84s: risk total in this position. Now you have to also think about the realized PNL or the realized loss
8007.76s: against what you stood to gain the return on your risk. And if you don't have such an extreme
8014.48s: example, but let's say you have an example where the underlying just goes to at the money.
8020.64s: So let's say that let's just pretend that there's a move that takes these 155s and it makes them
8027.68s: behave like these 140s where they go at the money. Right? So in this case, you stood to make $442.
8036.96s: If we have that move that essentially takes us to be at the money, which would be here. It's about
8042.64s: a 10 point move or a 15 point move. Let's say a 15 point move happens against those short calls.
8048.48s: These you sold them for $442. They'd be trading for $1010. Right? So that would be your loss.
8056.32s: Now let's say the same move happens for these 190s. You stood to make $53.
8064.88s: You get a 15 point move. So these 190s would look like the 155s.
8074.48s: Ish. A little further out. These would still show a lower loss, but it would be a higher relative
8085.44s: loss to what you stood to make. So I think that's what Benoit was attempting to convey in that scenario.
8092.64s: But that's only one scenario in a gross dollar amount. You'll still do better in terms of reducing
8098.16s: your risk. So the reason why I say further out of the money, safer for short options as a
8104.96s: misconception is because that perception of safety is relative to when risk is eventually
8112.40s: realized because if you make 50 bucks, 50 bucks, 50 bucks in this scenario,
8123.04s: right? So let's just use the same similar scenario here. You make $455 on these $2.35.
8129.52s: And let's say you do that a bunch of times and you make money. You make a bunch of money a few times.
8135.04s: Five trades in. You've made that $455. Then on the sixth trade, it goes here. And you're now at
8142.24s: $9. Well, this one you would have made money. Your system is okay. In this one, you probably didn't
8149.44s: make money because let's just call it 50 cents. If you make 50 cents, 50 bucks, five times in a row,
8156.96s: you get your $250, whatever. And then on your sixth trade, it goes here. You're now net loss.
8165.12s: So the problem with the safer options being further out of the money is that when a big move
8171.76s: eventually happens, it can be big enough to essentially kick you out of all of the profit you've
8177.52s: made because it's not much. That's why they're not safer. Couple more. Being an options trader,
8184.56s: what I alluding to here is don't be any kind of trader. Just be a trader. Don't be a day trader.
8190.24s: Don't be a spread trader. Don't be a long trader. Don't be a short trader. Don't be a stock trader.
8194.48s: Don't be an options trader. Just be a trader. Be whatever makes sense. Focus on making money.
8200.88s: That's what matters here. Next thing is rolling avoids losses. This one's a pep of mine.
8209.60s: Rolling does the exact opposite. Rolling realizes the PNL of a trade and it offers the opportunity
8220.24s: in a new trade to overwhelm the previous losses. So this video is about rolling options,
8231.04s: myths versus reality. This one is just kind of a general best practices master class.
8238.48s: And then this one is kind of like a step-by-step guide on like the decision cycle behind rolling
8245.76s: options. So those are three sources for you there. Last one. Market is out to get you.
8251.68s: I put this in here because people like to blame all kinds of things all the time market
8256.08s: makers trying to get them, somebody's trying to get them. And it again is handing the keys of
8261.92s: control over to somebody else. And there's no reason to do that. It is all about taking as much
8269.52s: responsibility as you can and figuring out how you can affect outcomes. That's what the entire
8276.96s: entire focus is here. That alone. Nobody's out to get you. Nobody cares about you. They're just
8282.80s: trying to make money just like other people are trying to make money. But by focusing on the things
8288.08s: you can control, taking responsibility for things don't go your way. That feeds the system to
8295.04s: eventually optimize it and find something that works. If you think something is out to get you,
8300.48s: then it's really difficult to manage around that. It's not. The way that the market is out to get
8305.44s: you is that it's competitive and it's looking for easy money. That's a thing. And that will be the
8309.76s: case. And you have to learn how to operate in that environment. So these are 12 misconceptions
8317.92s: related to options trading and obviously a bunch of individual random offshoots we took
8322.40s: along the way. But I had a blast. I love talking about this stuff with you guys. The next session
8328.56s: for next Friday will still be in options trading for beginners. I have a couple of other things
8333.92s: that I want to work through with you guys. And then we're going to transform this into what I would
8338.40s: call an options trading boot camp series, which is just going to be pivoting it more to the practical
8343.28s: application of this. And it will be less theoretical concepts. But I hope the information is useful for
8350.48s: you. And as always, if you guys have any questions, let me know. And the last thing I'll note is
8355.28s: tomorrow I am doing that GME live stream. If you guys want to check that out. And if you're not
8359.84s: a part of the outlier discord, it's completely free to join. I encourage you to do so.
8363.92s: Tons of cool people in there and great learning resources. So enjoy the rest of your evening
8369.36s: for those that want to do the GME live stream. I'll see you tomorrow. And then for the outlier
8374.32s: pro members, I'll see you Sunday for a market prep session. And thank you very much for TGO1
8380.96s: for the $20. Really appreciate that. Thank you. That will go directly towards my dinner. That'll
8386.48s: hook me up with the burrito carne asada burrito. That's the that's what we're targeting here. So
8390.88s: thank you very much. I appreciate that generosity a lot. Thank you. Awesome you guys. I will see you all
8397.20s: around being outlier. Catch you guys later.
