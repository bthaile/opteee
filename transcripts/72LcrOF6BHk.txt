0.00s:  What's up outliers? Happy Friday. Welcome to another options trading for beginners session.
6.68s:  Believe it or not, we're running out of these. I have a handful of more that are in the
14.10s:  docket. And then we're going to switch this series a little bit into something else.
20.52s:  So enjoy these while they're here because they ain't going to be here forever. All right,
28.88s:  let me get this chat over here. And let's do a quick rundown. First, if you're here,
33.44s:  don't forget to say hello. That's the whole point of doing a live stream is to hang out
36.96s:  with you all is compared to making videos by my loan sum, which is way less fun. Although
42.20s:  I'm not even going to lie, the video that I made today was pretty enjoyable. I like,
47.92s:  I looked down at the time and I realized like I had been, I'm essentially at like what?
54.08s:  25 minutes was that video earlier today was nuts because I ended up just kind of rambling
59.84s:  about this story because it was nuts. But really fun all the same. We are loaded up on beverages.
69.60s:  We have the black berry lemonade from Waterloo. Then we have Mandarin orange from Kroger.
76.72s:  And then we also have a spin drift raspberry lime. So I am essentially almost positively going to
85.12s:  need a pea break, but I am not going to need a break to go get liquid because I have quite
90.88s:  literally a plethora of them. So I'd love to hear how your trading week was. And I want to say
97.36s:  a lot of everybody, I see we got Tom Benoit, the sheet, what the sheet could you see, Brenna
104.16s:  Gayson, Elon Songs, Mac chicken, Oh gee, what a name. I love that. Kenny Wu, love that
113.60s:  Reese Eric. It's my doppelganger. In case you guys didn't know, there's another Eric,
118.48s:  which is really, really cool. Steven running D Gen, aren't we all D Gens at the core?
126.00s:  Shrey J Mike, we got everybody hanging out. Shane Soldner, that's a hell of a name too. I would
133.44s:  like my mind goes soldier there, which would have been completely wrong. All right, so what's the deal
139.44s:  for today? Well, there are two big things. The first thing is I want to work through this list
145.84s:  with you guys, understanding common options trading misconceptions. That's the first thing.
153.44s:  The second thing that I want to work through with you guys is taking a look at specifically what
158.80s:  kind of misconceptions you've heard. And as always, my intent to go through this session is we
167.68s:  should meander all over. So if there's a specific thing we're talking about from this misconception
172.48s:  list that leads into a rabbit hole conversation about a specific trade that was put on, that is
178.16s:  cool. That's the point of live sessions. If I want to do a discrete video about this, I would do
184.32s:  a video just about this and post that as compared to doing a live session. You get the point.
189.12s:  So I just want to encourage people at no point are you bothering me or anything like that.
197.84s:  All right, that part aside.
204.64s:  Brennan Gates says you see news on Andrew left. Yeah, man, you must have not seen the news on
209.28s:  the video that I put out about Andrew left. I spent like the first half a day, or I guess like
216.96s:  half the afternoon talking about this dude. So that video is for you because I am aware of Andrew
223.84s:  left. And I actually think it's a really, really interesting update to the to the GME story.
231.36s:  H says love the content. Thanks for putting this style of information out there. Awesome. Yeah,
235.04s:  I love that. That's great. That's absolutely great.
238.88s:  Steven says let's look at Bitcoin. Yeah, I'm happy to start there. In the meantime, I would like you
243.84s:  guys to let me know what you saw this past week in the market. So the reason why is a lot of the
249.60s:  sessions that we're doing, they're predicated on this idea of, you know, understanding the theory
255.92s:  and the background behind options trading. Now one of the things we're going to do today is actually
260.72s:  review a trade that I took off last week so that we're integrating more and more and more
268.24s:  practical application. That's where this all goes. You can understand the theoretical
275.04s:  the theoretical aspects of options trading inside and outside ways backwards. Whatever other
280.08s:  dimension there is. And it doesn't matter unless you can figure out how to use them to make money.
288.48s:  So we're at the point in our journey together. I don't even know which episode this is at this
293.52s:  point. You guys might know better than me. I can't even see it. It's kind of annoying actually.
296.64s:  The title cuts it off here. What episode are we on? Is this like eight seven something like that?
301.28s:  Eight maybe. And so we're at the point now where the groundwork has been laid. And we need to
313.60s:  start pivoting the way we think about markets to the practical application. Jason says,
318.56s:  eight. Perfect. That's useful. Yeah. So eight episode eight.
323.60s:  We've been through a few of these at this point. And the reason why I'm drinking a lot by the
328.48s:  way is because I just got a shit ton of cupping done and you're supposed to have a lot of fluid to
332.96s:  help flush all that madness around. So though my right leg right now looks like fucking hamburger.
339.44s:  If you guys want to see it later, maybe I'll flash you my leg, but it looks nuts. I get cupping done
345.04s:  fairly regularly, but the leg is bad because I have like an inflamed thing going on. You know how it
350.24s:  goes. It's a 33 year old white man problems as I'm training more shit is breaking and I don't see
356.96s:  it getting better. So now I'm having them put suction cups on me to keep me together. That's the thesis.
362.80s:  Little stretch out. Good to see you. Let's say, okay, let's now go back up and let's take a look at
374.32s:  Bitcoin. Bitcoin was up today. I mean, I don't know. It's not doing anything exciting to me.
385.28s:  To me, it needs to be above this level before I really care.
392.56s:  Essentially up there. This is the way I think about it. Because Bitcoin has been pretty range bound
405.84s:  for a while, right? So it started basing down here. So I care about it if it's down below this.
413.52s:  And then, okay, sometimes I do stupid things. Like the stupid thing I did there was not change this.
424.72s:  I thought I changed it, but I didn't change it. And wait. Okay, so I didn't mess that up.
434.24s:  What's happening right now? Why are these alerts? Are these like not good till cancelled?
440.08s:  What's happening here? Oh, duh. Because it's N24. See, I like I just said, I do stupid things sometimes.
448.16s:  So anyways, it's because so in case you didn't know what was going on there and why there was a problem,
453.68s:  it's because they're good for this expiration, which essentially is now. So they're not sticking.
459.60s:  And then I think when you put these in different groups, yeah, so like you have to pick which
466.88s:  expiration cycle you want. So that was my bad. That was my bad. That do some dumb there.
471.36s:  But anyways, this looks really range bound to me. It looks like we had lower lows, lower lows,
477.28s:  higher low, higher low, slightly higher high. Like this was a bit of an inflection point in my opinion.
485.04s:  Then it just glide, sloped down. We based out here. So this tells me obviously people are
490.72s:  willing to transact at this level. And it's starting to drift back up. But I mean, to me,
497.76s:  this point of control is going to be a little bit of a problem. It looks like it's already starting
501.76s:  to break through. So this can definitely start to look like support once it gets all the way through.
508.16s:  But it just looks like a lot of congestion right here. So essentially before it starts getting
513.68s:  above those levels, I don't necessarily see like a massive story here. I maintain a position in Bitcoin
522.40s:  just in the underlying itself. But that's mostly just because Bitcoin, I think, is interesting.
528.72s:  And I view it as a disruptor. And that's the reason why I like it. So a slightly different
534.80s:  thought process towards these. But yeah, I mean, happy to take a look at it. If there's something
539.36s:  specific that you're seeing, I'm always down to discuss that. But at least from my perspective,
545.04s:  this doesn't look too, I don't know, too interesting yet. Now I want to talk you all through a
551.04s:  couple things from the past week, just from a broader market perspective. The reason why I want
559.04s:  you guys to like hear some of this information is because I think it's really important
569.60s:  to be able to see how these different things start to fit with one another. So that's really what I
577.36s:  want to talk about specifically with this past week. So I want to take a step back and go here.
585.12s:  And I want to walk you guys through some of the broader trends as far as I see it from the past
592.16s:  week. And if you look at just this chart, these series of charts, before I even say anything,
599.92s:  what do you think one of the things is that I would talk about here? We got to stand up.
611.76s:  What sticks out to you here?
616.00s:  Sneheel says I thought today's live was GME. That is incorrect. And I'm sorry to break your heart.
622.32s:  The GME live stream is tomorrow. The Friday live streams are options for beginners.
629.44s:  This is where we're kind of going through the basics of options and stuff like that.
633.76s:  So a little bit of a different focus. Sorry, Sneheel. I'm not really sorry. I've been really good
640.64s:  about publishing the dates with what is when. So I'm not so sorry about that to be completely
646.24s:  honest because I know I've been pretty clear about it. But I guess the part I'm sorry for is that
652.96s:  it would make me sad if I was going to a concert expecting one band and it was a completely different
659.12s:  band. I wouldn't like that. So I don't blame you for being in here and being like, what is this all
665.44s:  about? I don't blame you. But and I feel bad for that because I was hoping that it would be
670.96s:  closer to your expectations. But yeah, that one's tomorrow. And for those that are interested in
675.12s:  that live stream tomorrow, the game plan is really Newton's not joining me for this one. He can't
680.72s:  make it. He's going to start back up on the next one next week. We're going to connect again
685.68s:  because we're both doing a bit of research. But my game plan for tomorrow is actually to go pretty
691.60s:  deep into watching some of his old videos and stuff. I've been collecting some that I want to work
696.96s:  through. It's just to learn. That's essentially the goal for me tomorrow. And that's actually why I was
702.80s:  asking people for help because a lot of folks, especially in the chat are way, way, way more
708.56s:  abreast with like the history behind this whole thing. So that's the goal for tomorrow's live stream.
714.96s:  Today's options for beginners. So it looks like a few things I see. Tom is bang on as would be
722.64s:  expected. He's typically on top of some of these broader trends. And this is a really important one
730.16s:  because one of the very clear things you're seeing is strength in small caps. That's super important.
737.84s:  The reason why it's super important is because that in and of itself opens up a series of trade
747.36s:  opportunities if you are a discerning trader. So you can think of things like pairs relationships
754.08s:  and pairs trades. You can look at relative value between the different indices and where they're at.
760.32s:  You can look at macro economic factors. And how right now small caps are trying to front run
767.52s:  the rate cut that we think is coming. So the reason why I want to draw your eyes to something
773.68s:  like that is because you have to get in the habit as a trader of looking at these things.
778.24s:  You have to have a specific process that you go through because if every day you open up the
782.32s:  platform and it's just kind of like whatever blinks the brightest to you or whatever, like you're
787.20s:  never really going to see anything. You have to take the time to make deliberate scans and things
793.04s:  that you want to look at in particular analyze relationships because then it starts to breed trade
797.92s:  ideas. Now to give you guys a little bit of background on this, anybody that's been in my
803.52s:  community since the beginning of the year, you guys know that I expected this to happen. Now I
809.84s:  want to be abundantly clear. This took longer than I thought and I told you guys that as well
815.20s:  because I originally structured the whole IWM slash Russell trade under the idea that we originally
822.56s:  were looking at rate cuts so much earlier in the year and then everything changed. And guess what?
829.36s:  Markets do that. Markets change and that actually goes into one of the misconceptions we're going to
835.44s:  talk about in a little bit because one of the hallmarks of a trader is the ability to adapt to
842.48s:  changing environments. So again, going back to the community as I'm doing YouTube live streams on
848.08s:  Monday talking about the stuff that I'm doing. There was a while back that I told everybody that I
854.08s:  pivoted out of small caps and then I pivoted back into small caps when I saw them start doing what
860.88s:  I thought made sense. So if you can start identifying broader market relationships, the idea of doing
871.04s:  that sooner rather than later is only going to help you. So there's a reality behind time and tenure
878.08s:  in markets and it just takes time observing things. You can't fast track that. You can only see
883.92s:  things as fast as they happen. So what I recommend to people is just take the time even if it's just
890.56s:  for a few minutes, it doesn't even have to be all the markets open. But take the time on a daily
895.04s:  basis and try to look at a few things consistently for a set period of time. So for example,
903.68s:  pick something like the Russell and just follow it for a week, just a week, but make sure you look at
909.12s:  it every day for that week. I guarantee you you'll learn something. I literally guarantee you,
914.56s:  you will learn something. What it is, it depends on what you know going into it. But by being specific
920.48s:  with some of these things that you're literally drawing concerted focus towards will help you.
927.12s:  So yeah, that's one of the really important things that happen this week. There's another
932.16s:  few things that I think we can draw from this past week, one of which is the market's perception
941.52s:  still of the rate environment that we're in. So if we grab this and we look at news,
949.12s:  so this is from this past week and we take a look at some of the things that have happened.
953.52s:  What's happened? Well, home sales came in a little bit light. That matters. Again,
960.24s:  this, once you start getting the habit of analyzing these things, the first flow of my thoughts when
966.08s:  I see this is how we're small lending banks doing that would typically finance these things.
971.68s:  How are materials doing? How are builders doing? There's immediately trade themes that you can come
978.16s:  up with just from this information. Now, this is the cool part is you could decide if you're trying to
983.76s:  play more thematic things that take way longer to unravel or you could literally play the digestion
990.40s:  of this information. Because even though as a retail trader, your propensity to be first in line to
996.80s:  see this metric come out and trade it is essentially no. It's probably never going to happen.
1002.00s:  That doesn't mean that you still can't make money trading information like that as the broad move
1007.92s:  gets priced in because this is exactly how we get into these instances where stocks become so
1014.64s:  beat down or so elevated. And that's because price is not always rational. It gets pushed to
1023.52s:  these extremes and then it slowly oscillates back to normal levels. It's very common. It'll
1030.96s:  continue to happen and this all comes down to an observable market effect that's tied to this
1037.92s:  concept called information discreteness or indiscreteness. And it's this idea that in order for
1045.12s:  new information to be integrated into market pricing, it's not an instantaneous thing and people
1050.96s:  have different ideas about it. So it leads to what we call noise, price noisiness. So something like
1058.00s:  this that's just kind of bouncing around and then it just randomly hits 16, 33, 67. And then it
1064.24s:  decides, up, that's it to the downside and then it starts going up from there. That's noisiness.
1069.04s:  This is not a clean dissemination or integration of information and it leads to extremes.
1075.92s:  Tradeable events. So to wrap down this thought here, let's take a look at a couple other things from
1082.88s:  this past week. So we had the composite from S&P PMI. We had the services, global services,
1091.28s:  and global manufacturing PMI. Why would all of these matter? Why do I care about these metrics?
1096.72s:  And for those that don't know, I want you to take a guess. If you do know, you don't have to answer
1102.32s:  because you already know the answer to this. But if you're not sure, if you know, I would love to see
1110.40s:  what the guess is. Shraja is a great question. Shraja says, what are your thoughts on
1116.00s:  XLB strength despite poor housing data? It's a great question. It's not causal. It's not causal at all.
1124.24s:  So just because home sales are up or down, one, the miss was minor, very minor, literally 3.89
1135.76s:  versus 3.99. So this is not any sort of giant miss. But the other thing is you have to again,
1142.88s:  zoom out into the broader macroeconomic picture. What do you think home builders would be doing
1149.04s:  in an environment where they think rates might start to come down? What would they do in that scenario?
1155.76s:  And that in there lies most likely than not, the answer to your question.
1160.16s:  The sheet, what the sheet says rate cuts or not depending on PMIs. Yeah, that's great. That's
1167.44s:  exactly it. And Jason's concept of build based on what I was just talking about what the builders
1172.48s:  might be doing in this scenario is exactly correct. So that's why because this missed by 3.89 versus
1178.16s:  3.99 is why XHB doesn't care. There are other factors right now that are overwhelming that data.
1185.60s:  That's the cool thing, right? Because this is new home sales. This isn't new home builds.
1191.20s:  This isn't build permits. Take a look at build permits. This next line, 3.90 versus 3.4.
1198.24s:  It essentially tells you the inverse of that, right? It's important to look at individual data points.
1204.24s:  The example I was giving before when I said looking into those when you see these, it's just
1208.96s:  to get people thinking about where to look after you see these data points. But it's not that
1214.32s:  their causal relationships because they're not. Shane says I don't know what those things
1222.48s:  actually mean. That's literally great. I'm glad you said that. Let's take a really quick look
1226.96s:  together. We don't have to dive super far into this. And the other thing is I actually want to
1231.28s:  steer you guys away from looking too far into economic indicators because it is a little,
1240.16s:  I'm not exactly sure it's the best use your time is the easiest way to describe it.
1244.96s:  But there is usable information. So when you look at stuff like PMI, you can see a set,
1253.04s:  whoa, oh, it's this. I was like, where the fuck did I just get a chat ping from?
1258.40s:  So this is looking at a certain set of data, right? And you can see essentially what's built
1265.52s:  into the data, what's built into the surveys and what you can deduce from it.
1271.52s:  Now, if you think about what's topical right now in the market, it's anything related to inflation,
1280.64s:  anything related to cost to produce things, all of that is under a microscope right now because
1286.88s:  we've been in an elevated rate environment for some time. That will change. That's not always
1291.52s:  going to be the case. This is not always going to be the most important thing out there.
1295.84s:  And that's the cool part about markets is that during the bull market that we saw essentially
1301.04s:  from 2010 until COVID-ish, there was a bunch of other things that mattered way more than stuff like
1307.28s:  this. So the idea is to try and identify what matters at a given point in time from a broad perspective
1315.36s:  and then find supporting data points that help us assess where we're at in the specific
1321.92s:  broader picture so that you can come up with ideas. So that's why right now stuff like PMI is
1328.64s:  actually really, really important. So Shane, that's what the data is. It tells us different economic
1340.08s:  assessments really. And you can take a look. There's different people that do these. So this is
1343.76s:  S&P global. There are some that there's ISM. That's another really common one and they'll have
1348.88s:  difference in what they report and shit like that. That's the same kind of thing is looking
1354.64s:  and carefully tracking these kinds of things will give you some ideas on where we're at in a market
1360.32s:  cycle. So that's why I think this stuff managed to you. Nick, what up? Good to see you as well.
1367.36s:  Shane says his PMI private Morgan insurance. No, I just showed you what it was. You got to work
1375.12s:  with me here. I literally just showed you what it was. I grabbed the website again.
1382.80s:  S&P PMI.
1391.84s:  Oh, it's right there. I'm an idiot. Right there.
1397.92s:  So do you see? I'll throw this in the chat for you so you can take a look.
1405.76s:  And then you can take a look at the actual reports, right? And you can see what's in there.
1412.08s:  The sheet also is not correct. It's a great guess, but that's not it either. Fantastic guess.
1417.68s:  Very close, but not exactly quite. In this case, it's the purchase in Managers Index. So there's PMI
1426.16s:  which we really care quite a lot about. There's a couple other like larger ticket economic
1433.92s:  releases that matter to us more than others. Another important one believe it or not, GDP,
1440.00s:  which is a recent one from this past week. And GDP came in good, actually surprisingly good.
1445.12s:  I think the market and most people in general were pretty surprised at where this came in 2.8 versus
1449.20s:  2 expected. That was much higher for the pre-limb for Q2. That was interesting. Then there's PCE,
1457.20s:  which is another important inflation style metric, 2.9 versus 2.7. So what I'm highlighting right now
1463.84s:  are just some broader macroeconomic measurements that matter to the current market to varying
1470.24s:  degrees. And you should just be aware of them. So as you look across the previous week,
1475.28s:  these are some of the important things I think that show up here and that you should be aware of.
1483.12s:  So that is that. All right, let's get over to some of these misconceptions.
1490.16s:  What do you guys think of this very first one? This first one says this is how you make 500
1494.80s:  a week selling covered calls or easy, passive income. Are these things that you've seen or are
1502.16s:  these things that you've believed for yourself at some point? I'm going to type in actually,
1507.20s:  I'm going to grab a private window so that it's not skewed by any of my search habits. And then
1515.04s:  I'm going to go to YouTube.com and then I'm literally going to type in options trading. That's it.
1522.88s:  Now I want to see what pops up. Let's see.
1532.32s:  So we have full free course. That's fine. This is fine. Here you go. We're right off, we're right
1539.52s:  off to the jump. If I wanted to make 1000 a week trading options, what does this even mean?
1547.68s:  I'll tell you what this is. This is really good branding designed to capture somebody's attention
1555.20s:  that's like, oh, shit, I want to make a thousand dollars a week. Who doesn't want to make a thousand
1558.40s:  dollars a week? I'd make more than that. So I'd like to make that too. So why not do this?
1563.20s:  Right? That's it's natural. And unfortunately, a big part about this is
1571.84s:  appealing to people's issues, specifically the desire to make money fast. So this one actually
1579.28s:  project finance. Chris, I've talked with him a few times. He's a buddy of mine. He's cool.
1584.08s:  And I like the stuff that he does. We have very different approaches to trading, but I like his stuff.
1589.60s:  I just want to see what else is in here. There you go. 91% win rate. Who doesn't like a good win rate?
1598.80s:  And believe it or not, that'll actually be one of the things we talk about in here.
1602.96s:  In this back here is why, in my opinion, that's probably one of the worst possible things to focus
1608.40s:  on as a new trader, which no big surprise there. I think it's hilarious that that's a common
1614.72s:  thing. So anyways, what I'm trying to highlight to you, it's not to go through and poke at these
1618.96s:  other YouTube videos and stuff. What I'm trying to highlight is the shit that's put in front of you
1624.24s:  as a new trader. And the fact of the matter is, options are complicated. They are not impossible
1631.92s:  by any stretch. You do not have to be a genius to figure that amount. I am clearly proof of that.
1637.92s:  However, this, it's not, it's not a place for either of these is what it comes down to.
1643.44s:  Could you make $500 a week selling covered calls? Of course you could. But what this comes down to
1650.08s:  is this is how you make $500 a week. What are the things that just trigger in your mind?
1654.80s:  $500 every week. That's not going to happen with that. Not going to happen with that.
1662.16s:  And but it leads you to believe that that's true. And the issue with that then is then you start
1668.24s:  this world of trading with this really contorted mindset. And it sends you down the entirely wrong
1674.40s:  path in my opinion. So that's why we don't like these ones. The idea of easy passive income in my
1686.48s:  opinion, it also sets traders up for the wrong experience because it's focusing on this idea of
1693.20s:  easy. And then as soon as we start having to do difficult things to be successful at this,
1698.80s:  well, we struggle because we started thinking that this was easy and passive. So to both of these
1705.84s:  in the beginning, I would offer a counter data point for you. So I'm going to go to my website
1715.36s:  because I'm still building this out for you guys to have kind of some different resources available.
1721.44s:  And in this tab here, there's a bunch of different things we can look at, but one of them I want
1726.24s:  to show you is this right here. Right? So if we're looking at something that you can make $500 a
1732.80s:  week selling covered calls or it's easy passive income, then how, how, how is it the case that we see
1741.44s:  these issues that after five years in the market, generally speaking, 7% give or take of traders
1750.08s:  continue trading where even a small cohort of them are not profitable. Why is that?
1757.44s:  If it's easy passive income or if this is how you make X number of dollars a week selling covered
1764.32s:  calls, why is that? Or this, why is it that of the 7% that continue trading? Why is it that such a
1773.04s:  large number of them underperformed the market on average by 6.5% that's what this number is,
1779.44s:  by the way, I know it's a little confusing. Why is that? What I'm highlighting to you is all of this
1785.84s:  stuff in my opinion sets you up with the entirely wrong mindset to be successful in this long term.
1792.80s:  I would encourage people to actually do something slightly different, which is this.
1800.80s:  Understanding why this matters to us, right? So this kind of sucks if you think about it. The
1815.36s:  average income in the US is 94K, median is 74, average retirement is 61, lifespan is 77.3.
1825.12s:  That kind of sucks. So you essentially work your entire life and then you look to retire when
1830.72s:  you're 61, where as I already mentioned to you at the beginning of this video, I already have, I think,
1836.32s:  like a partially herniated fucking disc, and I'm going to physical therapy like I'm 90 in order to
1842.24s:  move healthily and I'm 33. So I'm real eager to see what this whole thing looks like for Yabola at 61,
1852.00s:  but my guess is I'm probably not going to do the same shit that I can do today then.
1858.24s:  That's probably what I'm guessing. And then if you're lucky, you get to enjoy that 16 years.
1865.04s:  It's good. 16 years is good, but you only get one shot at this life thing. So then you start with
1874.00s:  that and you start to realize, well, a lot of people don't do a great job at this. So then
1881.12s:  starting this entire process with this in mind, that trading just as it can enhance your wealth,
1891.92s:  it can just as easily destroy it. Why would I say that? Why would I throw that out there if the idea
1899.20s:  is to try to help present information in order for people to figure this thing out? Well, it's the same
1905.84s:  thing like if I'm coaching somebody in boxing and I put them in a sparring session and I just say,
1912.80s:  oh, it's easy. You'll be okay. Just go in there and move around. You'll be okay. You'll figure it out.
1918.00s:  What's probably going to happen to that dude in the ring? He's probably going to get the
1924.80s:  just the piss beat out of him. And after that, we're going to have a really tough conversation
1931.28s:  because because they weren't ready for that experience, they're now questioning if this thing is
1937.92s:  for them or not or maybe a better approach to that boxing scenario is if I have a friend, I put
1944.88s:  them on a heavy bag for a little bit, then I put the mitts on and I work with them for a little bit,
1950.40s:  I let them watch sparring sessions so that they can see what it looks like. And then before that they
1956.56s:  go in there and they start doing a full spar, we move them at 30%, 50%, we ratchet it up.
1964.80s:  Then what happens? What's the difference in that experience? Well, in the latter experience,
1969.84s:  you are prepared to get punched in the fucking face because it's going to happen. But if you start
1977.36s:  this without that expectation, when it happens, it completely derails you. So if you walk into this
1984.88s:  trading world like most of us do, hoping for quick, easy money, and that's your base expectation.
1992.48s:  And as soon as you start to realize that it's not quite like that, it becomes very difficult
1997.84s:  to continue because you're like, well, this isn't what I thought it was going to be. Do I want to
2001.44s:  continue doing this? Which is a great question to ask yourself. But if you go into this understanding
2007.12s:  that in the beginning, it is hard. In the beginning, you have a long way to go. But however,
2017.12s:  if you're able to turn the corner, then all of a sudden, it becomes worthwhile. I thought I had
2025.44s:  another thing in here, but it's in here. Here, this is it. This is what it's all about.
2037.76s:  So for those that ask, like how long does it take to get really good at this? If you spend five
2044.64s:  hours every single day without fail for five and a half years straight, you'll hit that
2049.52s:  typical 10,000 hour mastery level. Five hours every single day for five and a half years.
2060.48s:  A lot of people grossly overestimate how hard they're working and how fast they're learning.
2066.88s:  And it leads to this over here, which is a very common wealth depleting effect. Then we have a
2074.16s:  terrible experience and then we have a choice. Do we continue this path or do we not? Because here
2080.32s:  is the beauty and this is the absolute truth. Trading for me at this point genuinely is easy.
2089.92s:  It is mindless. What I do as a trader is easy. But that's because literally,
2099.60s:  all of the work is done before I click a button. Everything is done before I click a button.
2105.76s:  All of the hard work is completed before I have the luxury of being able to put a trade on by tapping
2114.08s:  my screen. That's the reality. So if you can embrace this slope of learning and if you can embrace
2124.96s:  the learning process, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but it's not a quick short tunnel.
2133.28s:  That is the objective reality of this. And it's super important for you guys to hear that so that
2140.80s:  you don't come into this with the wrong mindset and then go through a phase of lighting your own
2146.96s:  wealth on fire, trying to do stupid things. That's number one. We got 11 more to go through. Some of
2154.08s:  these will be a little bit faster. But do you guys have any questions on this one? Or this is a great
2157.92s:  time for any injections or moving around anywhere else. If you have anything else you want to look
2163.92s:  at quick. The sheet says, I've been assuming the worst. I've been trying to get my process with
2169.20s:  as many risk mitigations as possible. That's a good idea. But the problem is you can't become
2175.60s:  too risk averse either. You have to have a really solid balance between the two in my opinion.
2181.12s:  So I would be very careful with that idea of as many risk mitigations as possible. I'm not even
2186.56s:  sure that that's the right focus there. If that were me, I would be focusing on the proper risk
2192.88s:  mitigation. That's what I would think. G33 says stock goes up call options go down WTF. That's easy.
2203.04s:  There's a lot of reasons why that can happen. You're fighting a lot of things with call options.
2207.68s:  You're experiencing stuff like faded decay where the value of your option is eroding every single day.
2213.36s:  You're fighting things like changes in volatility. So if the stock moves up a little bit,
2220.40s:  but not enough to overwhelm faded decay, you'll lose money. Or if the stock moves up a little bit,
2225.44s:  but not enough to outpace faded decay plus a change in volatility, you'll lose money.
2231.04s:  That's the tricky part with options is that it starts to bake in new elements into what can happen
2238.32s:  in our trade. So for example, if we're looking at something we'll use GME. If you're looking at
2245.12s:  something like GME and the reason why I think this is a good example, I'll explain why I think it's
2249.44s:  a good example. Because let's say that you're trading GME and let's say, let me get rid of this.
2256.64s:  Let's say that you're bullish and let's say that you've been in this game for a while and you're
2261.92s:  trading GME from a long while back. Well, one of the problems that you will face with something
2268.24s:  like GME is because it is heavily volatile. So your options are going to move as volatility chains.
2277.84s:  Take a look at both the 30 day and the seven day vol for literally the past week. It's moved
2287.76s:  meaningfully. So if we take a look today is what? The 26th. So if we go back to the beginning of the
2295.36s:  week here, your 30 day vol was like 171 and it landed today like 137. That's a direct input
2305.20s:  into the value of your options and it just cratered. That does not help you. The other thing with
2312.56s:  options specifically is that you need to move in a certain time frame because you're holding
2317.68s:  at the king asset. So for example, let's say that you go back between the two squeezes that we've
2325.52s:  seen. Let's say that you're somewhere in here and you're like, man, there should be another one
2329.44s:  soon. I mean, you had a couple in here. So let's even cut those off. Let's say that you're getting
2333.92s:  in somewhere around here like early 23 and you're just you're hoping for a movement. Nothing's
2340.40s:  happening. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. Well, what is happening is your options are
2345.44s:  eroding. So what that means is that if you eventually get a move, you now need a bigger move to
2351.20s:  compensate for that holding duration that you were in and for a lot of GME options traders as
2358.08s:  far as I can see, they structure their trades terribly and they're using these really short
2363.68s:  dated options that decay super fast. I talked about that as well in the video today because what
2371.60s:  I saw was this surprised me actually the fact that more people opened these yesterday into today,
2378.08s:  I did not expect that and I called that out in the video, by the way. And the reason why I did that
2382.96s:  just for to call it out here in case you haven't seen the video is I think it's important for people
2386.56s:  to realize that people get shit myself included wrong all the time. So I would have guessed something
2392.08s:  else here. I literally would have guessed that the vast majority of these people would be rolling
2396.32s:  their options out further in time. But there was clearly enough yesterday into today to have a net
2403.28s:  positive inflow into these, which that genuinely is surprising, but it's also shouldn't be surprising
2408.64s:  with me anymore with GameStop. I should know better. Now, if I take a look at where they're moving
2415.92s:  into though, it's very clearly here, right? The 25 strike next week. There's 10,500 OI against 15,000
2424.88s:  new volume. So there's already essentially a very clear ad 4000 plus going on here.
2432.72s:  What's going to happen? Well, they're losing seven cents every day on something that's worth 65 cents.
2440.64s:  So you have your $7 decay on something that's at 65 bucks, 10.77% of the options value decays every day.
2455.20s:  And the fun fact is that's going to get worse. As this gets closer to expiration as a percentage
2464.32s:  of the remaining premium, this will get worse. So that's a big problem here. So all of that is to go
2472.88s:  all the way back to whose question was that? Where was it?
2484.24s:  G 33. That was to answer your question about stock goes up, call options go down. That's why.
2491.20s:  It's not, it's not that relationship isn't as you're describing it. You're just missing the
2496.16s:  rest of the nuance that goes with it. So yeah. Shane asks, what do you do with your unallocated
2504.64s:  money? Do you leave it in cash? Do you put it in TLT or do you do something else with it? Yeah,
2508.40s:  it's a great question. So the majority is going to be put into things called box spreads because
2517.44s:  they get a better yield. So here's a video about box spreads. And then there's a log for those
2528.00s:  interested in learning how to analyze box spreads. That's what I do with my money. So capital that's
2535.12s:  not being utilized. I use box spreads for a bunch of different reasons, but it's because they're
2539.60s:  highly, highly adjustable to whatever timeframe. There's a couple really important traits when
2545.44s:  you're trading something called a box spread. The first one is you need to use a European style
2549.84s:  option that has no early exercise. That is a massive risk if you're trading box spreads. And
2556.32s:  especially if you're not expecting it to be there, there was somebody on Reddit that traded a
2560.96s:  UVX Y box spread that they didn't know this. So this isn't actually what happened by the way.
2576.72s:  This is, oh, let me squish this down. I think this person is trolling somebody else,
2586.00s:  but this is a joke, right? But they're trolling somebody else from here. So essentially, maybe it
2595.68s:  was this person. But anyways, they're trolling. So there was somebody who had a UVX Y box spread
2604.56s:  on. And the problem with UVX Y is that it's not a European style option has early assignment. So
2609.92s:  it has a ton of risk, right? So again, this person, I think, is trolling somebody else. I forgot
2615.52s:  the name of the person who actually did the real trade, but this is what that person thought.
2620.56s:  This person thought that they were putting on a box spread, which if you're buying a box spread
2625.12s:  and you're doing it correctly, it is a risk-free trade. However, if you're not paying attention to
2630.64s:  the products you're using, there can be a ton of risk. And that's what happened to the person
2634.64s:  doing this. They were using UVX Y because they were able to get a shit ton of money
2639.04s:  because there's risk, but they didn't realize that. They thought it was risk-free. So they
2644.16s:  thought it was a really good risk-free return, which obviously wasn't. So that's a big problem.
2652.16s:  Wheel stretch O says, any European style option have a dividend. That's actually a great question.
2658.96s:  I don't think so because most European style options, at least like these, they don't have
2663.60s:  an underlying, like they'd be cash-settled. Let me see you're a quick. Do any European style
2671.84s:  options have a dividend? That's a good question. They do not. Oh no, this says index style options.
2681.44s:  And then this one says, no, European styles do not usually pay dividends. So yeah,
2688.48s:  because what they're doing is they're equating right away European to index options.
2693.92s:  Rudevega says, what's a European style option? Yeah, a good example of that are the indices.
2701.12s:  So like SPX, this is a European style option. You'll notice that there's no underlying,
2706.72s:  right? There's no volume. There's nothing that trades here. So European style options are options
2717.12s:  that have no early exercise. And they're typically cash-settled. It's one of the two
2727.04s:  types of options that exist. There is American, which is mostly what you're used to seeing.
2733.76s:  And then there's European. I think this is in here. Yeah.
2740.80s:  So we would have went through this in one of the earlier videos that we did, but it's totally
2748.00s:  cool to go back through. So the main component of a European style option is that there's no
2756.08s:  early exercise. Now, there are a lot of reasons why that matters. It matters in terms of pricing.
2762.48s:  It matters in terms of risk assessment and things like that. But the other component is that many
2768.88s:  European style options are also cash-settled, which is a really important component,
2777.52s:  because there's no underlying that moves. It's just settled to the value at that point in time.
2784.72s:  So that's why using something like a box spread in a European style option is so important,
2790.88s:  because early assignment induces risk that otherwise wouldn't be there,
2795.60s:  which we're not trying to have.
2800.00s:  Tom says, are you only using box spreads for capital allocated to the CS strategy? No,
2804.48s:  I use box spreads for everything, man. Any unused cash in the portfolio, I will absolutely put
2811.28s:  into something unless I'm planning on using it soon. Now, normally, I leave a little bit of money
2816.72s:  easily accessible, right? So like, because like as a trader, I also don't know
2820.96s:  when opportunities are going to come up. So I'll leave a few hundred thousand dollars that I can
2824.24s:  tap into whenever I want. But the majority of unused cash is going to be put to work in some capacity.
2831.20s:  So I'll put it in typically a box spread. Now, to your point, a lot of times that includes capital
2836.80s:  that's already allocated to other trades, but it's not being utilized yet. So it's not always in
2842.64s:  one single box spread, right? Because I need to de-conflict by time the different box spreads that I
2849.68s:  have out against when I think I need that money. So it makes a giant difference in terms of
2858.08s:  when I want to use the capital, how I set up the box spread, how many of them I need to have on
2865.36s:  at a given point in time, how much the box spread is worth. All of that is variable. But it's all
2871.76s:  going to start with trying to use the capital. Now, this is relatively new, especially from what I
2877.76s:  would have been talking to you guys about. Because if we go back to pre-COVID, pre-interest rate increase,
2883.76s:  there was like no yield. So if you put money in anything trying to earn something on the cash,
2890.80s:  it didn't really matter because you're earning so little that really are just sacrificing liquidity.
2896.96s:  It didn't really matter that much. So yeah, the short answer though, it's definitely not just
2902.80s:  relegated to stuff allocated to the coverage triangle. It's pretty much for everything. The question
2908.40s:  of. All right. Let's get on now to our next one. The market should have done X. What do you guys
2920.08s:  think about this? Why is this a misconception? What's wrong with this idea? What do you guys think?
2931.20s:  The market should have done X or Y or Z. The notion here being that the market should have done
2940.80s:  something else. Brennigate says unforeseen circumstances. Nope, not it. That's not it.
2950.16s:  The market is irrational. That's not it either. Hater says we don't control the market. There we go.
2956.08s:  Rudebegas says no self accountability. There we go. M. Ram says views to narrow. You missed
2961.76s:  something. Could be. Aenex says the market will do what it will do. There you go. You guys got it.
2966.88s:  So the market should have done X is stupid because it infers that what you think should have
2974.24s:  happened. You served what happened. The reason why I did whatever it did is because the rest of
2980.56s:  the market did that. That other thing that you said shouldn't have happened, but the majority
2988.56s:  said it should. That's what they did. The problem here is that for this kind of trader and for
2997.04s:  this kind of mindset, you breed massive problems because you start to overvalue your assessment
3007.92s:  of what should or should not happen over whatever is happening. It's a really weird concept to
3015.92s:  get used to, but at some point, you literally have to relinquish yourself to the market. I know
3022.88s:  it sounds really weird and esoteric. What it means is even if you have some of the highest conviction
3029.44s:  ideas, if the market is not agreeing with you, you have to reconsider them. For example, a great
3036.72s:  version of this is the big short, specifically when he had these custom swaps made, essentially on
3046.24s:  the mortgage-backed securities. The premium that he was paying on them was literally about to make
3053.68s:  his fund go insolvent is much as that turned out to be the coolest story ever where Michael
3064.88s:  Burry stuck to his guns. He really knew it was going to happen. Then it happened. You had better
3071.84s:  believe there was a massively healthy dose of fucking luck. All the hard work in the world went into
3081.28s:  identifying the opportunity. The luck component really came into the timing of the opportunity
3088.32s:  because he almost had to close his positions because he was way too early and he was going to go
3094.56s:  insolvent. He actually had to go death con five and essentially disallow people from pulling their
3100.72s:  money out of the account because if they did, essentially the play would have died.
3106.80s:  So that kind of thing is really important to acknowledge because even when we see these really,
3112.00s:  really cool stories, you like, who doesn't love what Michael Burry did? It's one of the coolest
3116.64s:  things ever. But he was super fucking close to that whole thing not working, mis-timing it and
3125.60s:  having an entire fund blow up. So while it's really cool to look and acknowledge those really
3132.16s:  interesting scenarios, it's important to understand survivorship bias, which is exactly what that is.
3139.36s:  We're looking at a successful result for maintaining conviction and we're not seeing the
3146.00s:  litany of unsuccessful results stemming from the same exact strong conviction.
3153.52s:  So what I'm highlighting with number two here is nobody, literally nobody, gives a flying
3160.48s:  fuck what you think should happen. Nobody cares. I don't care. Nobody cares what I think should happen.
3168.32s:  Nobody cares. It is really important to understand how to interface with markets.
3176.88s:  This other idea of markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvents. I love
3184.96s:  the saying, but guess what? If the market is remaining irrational for a long duration,
3192.40s:  what does that tell you? Is it irrational then? Maybe. Maybe it is. I'm not saying all instances
3200.16s:  is not. I just told you in the beginning of the stream that prices can get pushed to extremes.
3205.60s:  That don't make sense. That can happen. But what I'm highlighting is this idea that it's almost like
3213.04s:  where people will place themselves way higher than they should be in a hierarchy and essentially
3219.12s:  saying that maybe the market is doing what the market thinks it should be doing and maybe we're
3225.84s:  just being ignorant and stubborn and we don't like that it doesn't align with what we want it to do.
3232.00s:  This idea of the market being irrational longer than you can be solvent is complete bullshit.
3237.76s:  It's worrying about the wrong thing. It's literally a giant series of bias that are happening in
3245.12s:  that instance. Again, it will skew your thoughts heavily. Let me grab this. This is another thing
3256.08s:  that I'm working on for resources for you guys. It's this one. It's a giant list of all these
3263.44s:  different decision making faults, cognitive biases and all that kind of stuff. All that really
3268.48s:  fun stuff. There's a few things in this kind of scenario that really, really stick out to me.
3276.32s:  But this one is a massive one. There's cognitive bias. There's another one that I'm thinking about
3289.36s:  in particular. I want to see if I can find it quickly. No, no. This one.
3303.04s:  This one right here. Line spot bias. It's the perception of being less biased than other people
3308.72s:  and that essentially your desire to assess others is more severe. So that's what that boils down to
3318.00s:  is when you say the market is irrational or can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
3324.72s:  that essentially means that you think you're so unbiased in your analysis of things and the
3330.24s:  market is biased. It's complete bullshit. All right, next one.
3338.88s:  Mike Williamson says, hurting. Yeah, hurting is a really common one. I think where was that
3349.28s:  towards the bottom or did I miss it? I might have taken that one out. It was literally on here
3354.96s:  because I wanted to pick a weird number. And I'm going to continue building this out. I don't
3359.20s:  really care how long this one gets. But essentially hurting is absolutely another bias.
3366.24s:  Hurting is interesting in terms of what it stems from. And the other thing you'll notice with
3371.12s:  a lot of these different kinds of devices is that they stem from similar things and they overlap
3375.84s:  a lot. They're very infrequently discreet from one another. But yeah, like I said, I literally
3381.76s:  am building this out on the website for you guys so that whenever you want a reference of these
3387.04s:  different kind of decision making faults and shit, you can find a ton of them. What led me to do
3392.00s:  this honestly was when I was building this for you guys. I was in the process of updating this tool.
3402.16s:  And I wanted to build like a more in depth syllabus to at least give you some sub topics that I
3407.84s:  think you should focus on for each topic. This was the OG version. Right. So this was supposed to
3412.40s:  be down in dirty. Just send you down the right path, which was the hope here. But this is to give
3417.44s:  you some specific things that you should be learning in these topics. And take a look. I actually
3422.08s:  find this comical. Take a look at how many sub topics are in this one nine. How many are in this one?
3428.48s:  11. How many are in this one seven? And then you get to trader behavior and decision making.
3435.36s:  How many are in here? 32. And this isn't even all of them. There's more that going here.
3442.72s:  And then I keep going down and I realize this one has 10. This one has 10. This one has like four.
3450.88s:  This one had nine. You get the point. What I'm highlighting is literally the densest section in
3455.92s:  this entire syllabus is this right here. And the reason why that's the case is in my opinion.
3462.96s:  This is the difference between a successful trader or not. Now it's not quite that simple because
3468.56s:  in my opinion, the first differentiator is edge or do you have the capacity to build edge?
3474.64s:  That's not that difficult to do. Right? Edge is there. Edge. There's structural alpha.
3479.84s:  There's different kinds of edge that exists objectively speaking. And they're not that it's
3485.92s:  just not that difficult to find them. Now off of that, what then becomes the difference?
3494.40s:  If we have access to the same tools, the same information, it's the individual trader.
3498.80s:  It's how they conduct business. So that comes down to decision making and understanding yourself
3505.76s:  really well to make good decisions. So yeah.
3512.40s:  Anec says, your opinion on a spread for our WT list. What's it going to look?
3517.92s:  Some R W T. I swear if this is a penny stock.
3524.32s:  Okay, it's not it's a reat. What kind of spread?
3534.56s:  It has earnings coming up.
3540.24s:  You have to tell me, yeah, you have to tell me what position you're thinking of.
3545.20s:  In a nutshell, as I look at this six month daily, bullish trending, Anec says call put,
3551.76s:  what kind of spread though? There's diagonal spreads, calendar spreads, vertical spreads.
3558.56s:  You got to hook me up.
3565.36s:  To me, it looks like it's had a massive move. This almost ran like a small cap,
3570.72s:  essentially displaying very similar small cap behavior, meaning like the Russell 2000,
3574.64s:  like a lot of stuff in the Russell moved like this.
3578.08s:  And I see upward sloping standard deviation channels. I see the moving averages now all aligned
3584.40s:  as they should be. I see a little bit of topping behavior going on here.
3589.76s:  So for me, I like to see a break up above that of some sort.
3596.16s:  To the downside, it looks like it's channeling at this.
3600.48s:  So a break down below that, something like that.
3605.28s:  Anec says, sorry, bro, you speak like Chinese for me now. That's totally cool.
3611.04s:  So what I'm highlighting are different kinds of option spreads.
3615.44s:  So I forgot which part in the series it was. You'll have to go through the titles because I
3620.88s:  obviously don't remember. But there are different kind of structures you could put on.
3626.24s:  So a spread is a generalized type of option structure, but there's a lot of different kinds of
3634.24s:  spreads. So there are things called vertical spreads, diagonal spreads, calendar spreads,
3640.16s:  butterfly spreads, iron condors. Like those are all different kinds of spreads.
3645.36s:  The way to think about a spread in an option trade is essentially when you have an additional leg
3651.28s:  of some sort that offsets components of another leg. That's kind of the idea, more or less.
3657.60s:  So the way I would look at something like this personally is then if you're not sure like what
3662.48s:  kind of structure makes sense, then I would start with what's the thesis. Do we think up, down
3668.08s:  sideways? Which way do we think that RWT is set to move? And then from there, we can work,
3675.12s:  I mean, this is a great example of like building and framing a trade. We can work through that
3679.36s:  together. I could open up the door for the pup. But that's where it starts.
3694.24s:  And it says I think up, but maybe hedging also, those are literally completely different things.
3699.92s:  Hedging is the process of reducing risk of some capacity. Up obviously is a bullish direction.
3706.24s:  But if we're hedging, that means that we want to reduce downside risk, which means we think
3710.48s:  something is going to go to the downside. So I would offer to you that you have right at the
3715.60s:  origin of your thesis, you have conflicting thesis in my opinion. So I think you have to start with
3722.00s:  defining what thesis you have. So for me, again, I see something that's trending upwards here.
3729.68s:  I don't really love REITs right now. But the main reason for that is for those that don't know,
3735.12s:  I have a bunch of real estate that I've been building out into over time. So that's a part of the
3740.88s:  reason, right? Like I'm not looking for more real estate exposure in the market because I have it
3745.92s:  off and in the kind of physical sense. So for me, I wouldn't look to trade this in any sort of
3755.04s:  like significant holding capacity. Now the other thing for me is it has earnings coming up. And I
3760.80s:  would want to know how it's performed during previous earnings. So we can see, oh,
3767.12s:  dot, wait, huh? This is a REIT.
3774.72s:  Now I'm very confused. Now I'm very, very confused.
3782.24s:  Because what? Because no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try another platform real quick.
3788.40s:  I'm going to grab ORATS. And for those that don't know, I am in affiliate for ORATS. If you like
3796.32s:  their platform, you can sign up with a link that's in the notes you get. It's like 50% discount.
3801.52s:  It's a good discount. And it's a, it's a cool platform. I like it. But let me grab it really quick.
3808.08s:  Obviously this is in sponsored by them. I didn't know that I was going to use the tool. But I thought
3813.20s:  that I would give you the background on it. Paul says some reads, pay good dividends. Yeah,
3818.08s:  but that's the problem, right? Like again, people fuck up the idea of dividends.
3822.96s:  It's, I would take capital gains every single day of the week and twice on Sunday over a good
3828.64s:  dividend. Like I don't really care about a good dividend. I'm sure this, yeah, this has a great
3833.84s:  dividend, right? 8.65%. This is beautiful for the product. But what I care about is the price
3842.88s:  performance. And guess what? Like that dividend doesn't help you when you have an underlying that's
3848.16s:  gone from fucking 20 down to two back up to seven. So yeah, like literally screw the dividend.
3857.92s:  People get too wrapped up about dividends. And I would always take a much lighter dividend,
3863.84s:  much lower percentage with something that has much better capital gains. Now that's for total
3869.28s:  returns, right? That's not prescriptive for everything. There are scenarios where dividends
3872.88s:  might make a ton of sense. But I'm just saying in general, all right. So we need to look at RWT here.
3884.08s:  Let's see. So RWT is a shotgun blast. Yeah. So I don't like it for earnings. I wouldn't
3897.12s:  trade it for earnings personally. And so that would mean for me, I would wait until after earnings
3903.04s:  and see what it does. Ramalama. Yo, thank you so much for the donation. Really appreciate it.
3908.48s:  That will go towards my dinner tonight, which is going to be Mexican food.
3913.52s:  Ramalama says, felt content to enter a short iron condor. It was GME, which was unsuccessful,
3920.48s:  but excellent experience observing movements, thoughts on iron condors. Thank you. Yeah, great question.
3926.16s:  So I do not like iron condors personally. It is not what I would trade at all. So the issue is
3937.44s:  they sacrifice too much in too many places. And I do not see them as overall like a favorable
3946.48s:  structure pretty much at all. So it's not what I would trade personally is what that boils down to.
3956.32s:  Matt says thoughts on ASTS. Let's see.
3965.04s:  Oh, this looks good. I mean, this thing is up and out.
3974.80s:  So the way I look at something like this is if you didn't get in today, it's getting late.
3982.64s:  Like really late. That's how I would do this. So this is okay.
3988.64s:  In terms of like a breakout play, but really, this is the day I would want to enter on a breakout
3994.16s:  here. And then if I didn't get in on this breakout, I would definitely want to get in. I would
3998.88s:  have wanted to be in today because these are lower risk entries. So I don't dislike it. It's
4006.08s:  definitely moving and it's moving really well, but it just becomes a higher risk entry that I would
4011.36s:  have to manage the risk tighter and tighter in my opinion. So yeah, I don't dislike it.
4016.72s:  Paul says they're safe though iron condors. Yeah, who fucking cares, man? Like that's again,
4021.76s:  like that's a problem with traders is you guys can get too focused on safe. If you want safe,
4029.44s:  put your money in a safe, right? Like if I'm looking for safe, the market is not where I'm going to
4035.68s:  take my money. When I'm going to the market with my money, it is for a return. And more often than not,
4042.72s:  the reason I get a return is because I'm taking risk. I'm not safe. So like I have a special place
4052.88s:  in my heart when I hear traders that are wanting to hedge all their positions, they don't want to
4058.72s:  have downside risk. How do I reduce risk? The way you reduce risk chiefly is by sizing trades.
4065.68s:  That makes sense for you. That's the first way before you ever put the trade on size the trade.
4071.60s:  So it makes sense. That's your first risk reduction tool. Size your trade well. After that,
4078.56s:  it's managing the trade. But this like for iron condors, for example, just put on a short
4085.84s:  strangle and then manage the short strangle if you need to. So I think the problem is again,
4092.08s:  like this obsession with risk aversion. And I think it's a problem.
4098.72s:  Ramalamus has preferred strut for sideways moving stock or a bin in that stock and trade something
4102.96s:  else. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing in that equation personally. So if there's a sideways
4117.44s:  moving stock, I don't care if the price direction is sideways. That's not one of my profit mechanisms
4128.32s:  that I leverage as a trader. So when I think about the way I trade, there's a handful of profit
4137.52s:  mechanisms, things that are directional or volatility. Right. So like sideways isn't one of these.
4146.24s:  And the reason is because if I want to trade something that's going sideways, which is actually
4150.96s:  a beautiful segue, great question. I don't know if you realized how good of a question this was,
4156.00s:  but it is a perfect segue into the trade that I was going to show you guys in something called path.
4164.40s:  There she goes. So what do you guys think I did in here? Why am I talking to you guys about this trade?
4171.20s:  Any ideas? Talk to me about what you see. And then I got to talk. I got to step away for just one second.
4201.36s:  All right.
4212.48s:  Then Wallace says, VRP trade. Yep, you got it. Exactly right. So this is something that is moving sideways.
4221.60s:  Right. But the basis or the theory for my trade is not price sideways. Don't really care inherently
4229.92s:  if prices sideways. What I do care about though is if something has variance risk,
4238.48s:  premium, and this does. So essentially, you can see I highlighted it for you. I have to pull it up
4245.84s:  here here is where I entered. It was on the 14th of June. And you can see essentially what I saw
4253.04s:  on the 14th of June, which is about right here, just a really, really steady variance risk premium.
4261.20s:  And you'll notice that it actually started the variance risk premium for the short term time
4264.96s:  frame started building. And for the long term time frame looked completely static. It declined
4270.80s:  precipitously due to this drop. But it was still plenty attractive to me. So how did I trade this
4280.96s:  position? How do you guys think? How would I have traded variance risk premium in here?
4289.36s:  Any ideas? My dog is just like curled up in a little tiny ball. If you guys want me to
4298.40s:  bring them on the stream, let me know. I'm always happy to bother them and pick them up.
4303.76s:  Short strangle puts. What other guesses we got? Two good guesses so far. Short strangle inputs.
4311.76s:  Strattle also great guess. Ruudabega, I'm too dumb for this sir. As am I. I don't blame you. I'm
4317.76s:  right right there with you. Elon Song says dog break.
4330.32s:  Here he goes. We have to change to the to this. So this is actually from him digging in his bed.
4339.52s:  He has like war paint on. He's got some there too. So here he is in all his glory. Say hello to the people.
4352.96s:  So he he licked he licked the mic. I think that tells me that he likes you guys. He looks
4361.52s:  generally unenthusiated. He kind of noticed the face we got. What?
4368.56s:  Good boy. This is Thor. You guys see his mohawk still? He's a cool mohawk. We're a big fan of this.
4384.24s:  He doesn't he's not like good at looking at the camera. Notice like whenever I point him
4387.92s:  that direction. He like diverts his eyes. But the one thing I would say is he has a tuxedo.
4396.08s:  He's more formal literally than all of you guys combined because he essentially is always in his
4402.72s:  tuxedo. Fun fact. All right, let's get my face out of the way. Nobody wants to see that.
4411.68s:  He long songs that was for you. It was time to see the pup. All right, so back to this fan of
4419.28s:  airplanes. I'm also a fan of airplanes provided that they stay in the sky. I do not like airplanes
4424.32s:  that fail to do that. Great to see you. But how much correct it was a short strangle. So I offered
4437.28s:  the 13 and the 11s at an average of 40 cents. 40 cents. So what does that tell you? Well,
4448.40s:  unfortunately, I needed to put on 10 million of them in order to essentially get any sort of
4457.12s:  size on that I wanted. But the basis for the trade is literally as simple as it gets. It's
4464.08s:  something that showed really good variance or premiums and it still does. So this is still
4470.80s:  completely well within play and this is built around or right here. It's literally still in my
4476.96s:  variance or premium play scan. So there's different ways that I can come across the positions and
4483.68s:  it's generally built based on a portfolio need. So then I'm generally looking for different ideas.
4489.76s:  But the big filter here is I don't want stuff with earnings. So you'll notice it doesn't have
4494.24s:  earnings coming up. And yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it. So just wanted to give you guys an
4499.60s:  example. The management of the trade was super simple. All I do is figure out where I want to manage
4505.20s:  it to the upside set an alert where I want to manage it to the downside set an alert or rest
4510.48s:  orders to close the position either or is completely fine. And then just let it go literally just let
4516.48s:  it go. And I ended up taking it to expiration just because it was behaving exceedingly well. But
4522.88s:  for these kinds of trades, I very often will manage them early. The only reason for that is because
4529.20s:  as you get closer to expiration, things like gamma do start to skyrocket. So the overall return
4537.04s:  on risk is not as good in like the last bits of the trade, typically the last week and a half,
4543.84s:  two weeks. That starts to get not good. The sheet says, this is over my head a bit. That's a great
4550.24s:  question. So talk to me. What about this is over your head? What questions do you have? That's the
4554.64s:  whole point of these. And I'm glad that you spoke up and said that. Rudebega says, what was the DTE?
4560.56s:  It's a great question. So the trade was put on 14 June. And it went till 19 July.
4571.44s:  So that's the first component to the trade. So is about a month 14 June to 19 July.
4579.84s:  Now this one in particular, I ended up keeping for the vast majority of the trade. But like I said,
4586.08s:  that's just because it was behaving. So you know that fuzz I picked off my dog's face, he's digging in
4591.44s:  his bed again. So stop. And he has more fuzz on his face. Yep, that sounds perfect. Good for him.
4598.56s:  So the sheet, tell me what questions you have. Who's sane sauce? What was your return like? That's
4606.96s:  another great question. So the trade was at 40 bucks. So let's just call it 40 per lot.
4617.36s:  The sheet says variance, risk premium. What is it? Great question. So the first thing I'm going to do
4623.20s:  is actually give you a video that you can go deeper into detail on the concept. But I will summarize
4629.84s:  it for you. Simply put, variance risk premium is the tendency for implied volatility to be higher
4639.92s:  than realized volatility. So that means that there is a risk premium being priced into the options
4649.36s:  where we're pricing in a higher vol. Obviously expecting slightly higher volatility than we realize.
4659.20s:  So that leads to an opportunity. That's the general concept behind that. So great question. And
4667.12s:  that's precisely what it is. As always, again, like if you have follow-ups on that, just let me know.
4671.04s:  I'm happy to dive in now to figure out what this was not HV. HV is the same thing. So in this context,
4683.20s:  as I'm framing it, realized vol is historic volatility. Same same. Now, volatility can be really
4689.12s:  quirky in that there are different kinds of realized vol. You can have future realized vol,
4696.48s:  which is kind of weird. But you don't have to worry about that. I actually think in
4704.72s:  I think in one of the earlier videos we did, but let me see. I think I have a video that really
4709.68s:  goes into volatility pretty deep. Yeah, here you go. So this video goes a bit deeper into the concept
4719.68s:  of volatility so that you can kind of see. Tom says, how do you go about picking an expiration
4728.00s:  for the type of trade and how do you see VRP for a certain amount of time before placing the trade?
4732.72s:  Yeah, so I can care about persistence or magnitude of VRP that will depend a little bit on the
4739.68s:  opportunity itself. So in this case, it's a little bit of both. I saw persistence over time and
4746.24s:  magnitude. And then in terms of expiration, that's more about the portfolio. It's less so about
4751.28s:  the individual trade. But like if there's earnings coming up, obviously, I'll see how I feel about
4756.32s:  the earnings. If there are other trades that are going to be coming down, like it's mostly going
4762.16s:  to come down to how is this thing going to fit into the portfolio? VRP plays, there's sloppy,
4766.88s:  right? Like I'm not really trying to maximize each element of the individual position,
4771.52s:  because I'm just expecting to put on a fair number of these things, have a fair number of them
4775.44s:  work like total shit. And in the aggregate, have them make money.
4784.96s:  So it's an important differentiation, I think. But yeah, DTE, I think to give you at least something
4793.36s:  resembling an answer would be something between two weeks and 45 days, 50 days, something like that.
4802.72s:  I think that that's fair. The sheet says, or more important, let me see, the sheet says, so IV
4808.40s:  above HV is basically on the indicator, you know, that's exactly it. Or more importantly, the change
4814.00s:  in IV versus HV versus before, great questions. And the first one is that's correct. So this indicator
4820.80s:  is literally plotting a few different things. It's plotting implied volatility for different
4826.24s:  timeframes. The plots you see here are for a week and then a month. And then these white lines
4834.96s:  are historic or realize volatility, past volatility. And you can see there's two different time
4842.96s:  frames. The dark is like 30 day realized. And then this is five day or one week realized.
4850.72s:  And then the purple lines with red, those are actually tracking the variance between those two.
4855.20s:  That's variance risk premiums. So notice how between this bright yellow and this white line
4862.00s:  really big gap. And then you can see between the bright pink, how it turns super red. It's
4866.40s:  essentially that like the near perfect inverse of this. So that's essentially what that indicator
4873.28s:  is showing me, showing me volatility so that I can visualize it. Benoit, I won't get tired of that
4880.40s:  name, Benoit. So hilarious name. It reminds me of
4884.48s:  Archer. I don't remember if the dude's name was Benoit, balls, whatever that guy was. But that's
4889.52s:  what it reminds me of. Benoit says, what's the most appropriate profit mechanism to focus on
4895.04s:  capital preservation of a small account? Okay, well, I personally don't like those.
4900.56s:  Right? Like the idea of capital preservation in a small account. If the goal is to preserve capital,
4905.76s:  it would be like dollar cost averaging into an index ETF using some sort of moving average momentum
4911.68s:  following strategy to play positive drift. That's kind of the way to preserve capital. Now,
4917.52s:  beyond that, assuming that we want to trade and depending on what small capital means,
4921.68s:  let's just call it like sub hundred thousand something like that. Then in that scenario,
4928.80s:  if the goal is to like really try to grow the portfolio, which would be my approach,
4933.12s:  would be trying to grow without having massive drawdowns, would be primarily direction strategies.
4938.56s:  So things like ratio diagonals, I have an old series on the playlist from, it was called small
4946.40s:  stacks and it's still there. That one hasn't gotten nuked yet. But that one goes through this
4953.04s:  entire process of trading a small account. Now, I traded both the coverage triangle and the ratio
4958.48s:  diagonal. The ratio diagonal provided a much better return in that portfolio. But the coverage
4962.88s:  triangle provided a little bit of like a keel where my P&L wasn't highly volatile because I had
4970.56s:  capital committed to that. So yeah, that's essentially the way that I would think about it. I
4976.80s:  personally would be trading ratio diagonals and believe it or not, I have a video on this exact
4984.00s:  thing for like what account or what strategies I would use in a small account, which is right here.
4991.04s:  So you can check that video out. And then I funny enough, the small stacks segment pops up. So
4996.96s:  I'll give you the first video in that segment here. And then it looks like there's 16 parts.
5005.76s:  It was a three month experiment. I made 26.85% over the three months. So not terrible, not great.
5016.40s:  But we still have money. So that part's cool, I guess. That's not so bad.
5025.04s:  Behemoth says what delta do you use for strangles? It's not a fixed thing. It's highly dependent
5030.24s:  on the individual product. I would say general bans though would be anything from 40 delta's out
5039.36s:  to five. If I had to ballpark an average, it would probably be like 30, I think is a fair average
5050.16s:  normal go to delta. But it is a specific metric. It's not something that standardize just blindly.
5057.20s:  And again, I know what you guys are trying to do. And it makes total sense to do that.
5061.28s:  Where essentially we're trying to come up with like simplified heuristics for how to use these
5068.48s:  things. But the problem with that with options is that is another, it's another bias that you have
5079.76s:  to find it one second.
5087.28s:  It might not be on here.
5092.56s:  Anyways, there's another bias essentially where we seek to oversimplify things.
5098.40s:  And I think that's partially what that is. Like just trying to come up like what DTE to use or what
5108.64s:  what delta to use. Like I said, I totally, totally understand the origin of the questions.
5113.84s:  But it essentially will always be a variable component to some degree. And the reason for that is
5121.12s:  like that's the whole concept behind options is to have that kind of variability. Because without it,
5131.84s:  right, like if you didn't care about any of that stuff, all you would do then is trade the
5138.08s:  simplest expression, which would typically be the underlying itself.
5143.20s:  Let me see what that bias is called.
5156.24s:  I can't. Oh, fallacy of a single cause.
5161.04s:  Oh, no, that's not it. My bad. I'm not sure what it's called. I have to figure it out.
5165.04s:  But essentially it's just oversimplification. That's the, oh, I think it's attribution. Is that it?
5170.08s:  Let me see. Do I even have that in here? I don't.
5176.88s:  Oh, we have another one we need to add. Yeah, I think it's attribution.
5182.16s:  No, not really. Damn. Damn, damn, damn. My bad. I thought I thought I knew it. I can't remember.
5201.84s:  Simplicity or reductive bias. Is it simplicity?
5206.48s:  Simplicity bias. So I'm not sure if that's actually like a standard bias.
5219.76s:  Reductive, I think.
5225.28s:  Yeah, okay. So reductive bias. Thank you. That's what it's called. Thank you very much.
5229.44s:  Yeah, I was going to say I like I recently came across a bunch of these, right? Like as I was
5233.92s:  building out that page and I'll actually add that one for you guys as well.
5239.84s:  But yeah, essentially when we try to oversimplify a lot of those components, we lose a lot of the
5247.84s:  details associated with them that kind of make them what they are because they actually are kind of
5254.40s:  these. I would honestly, I would almost call them like magical concepts because the cool thing about
5262.16s:  options is that there's a lot of variability that go into them. And in my opinion, that's
5270.40s:  that's kind of the benefit of them is that you can very, very carefully structure them to be what
5276.08s:  you want them to be. So yeah, I think in this context, you can come up with general heuristics,
5283.28s:  which again, it's normal. And I think it's a good thing to do because in doing that, you
5288.32s:  essentially simplify the way that we're analyzing information so that it's more palatable.
5294.08s:  But I think it's also important to make sure that we identify like what components make the most
5300.96s:  sense for what we're trying to do. And then make sure that we're prioritizing the correct
5308.88s:  components. So like for example, when I hear something about the Delta selection, you guys
5314.00s:  tell me when you're selecting a Delta, what's the trade off? Let's say that we're picking the same
5319.60s:  expiration, same product, all everything else is the exact same. But what's the trade off when you're
5324.80s:  picking Delta's? There's a few things that come to mind to me.
5330.40s:  Price to risk ratio, that's part of it for sure. Think of things like how much money you can make,
5352.00s:  think about things like risk, think about things like management.
5357.04s:  Right? So what happens if I sell a 40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle? What are the
5364.88s:  things that you guys can think of? And I want you to specifically to think about the overall
5369.04s:  P and all of the position. I want you guys to think about how the path of that position will look.
5376.16s:  40 Delta strangle versus a 10 Delta strangle. You guys tell me what's the difference?
5382.00s:  Depreciation, that's not it. It's a good guess, but that's not it.
5405.84s:  Risk of assignment, that's part of it.
5411.44s:  Bingo, Tom has it. Tom, Tom summarized it really well.
5419.68s:  So what Tom is highlighting is that you can make more money, but you're in a scenario where it's
5430.80s:  much more likely to give you problems. What's another thing? So let's take a look, let's take a look
5438.08s:  in here, for an example. And let's say that we're looking at something that's like 45 days out.
5442.16s:  Let's just pretend that these were liquid. You have to use the monthly.
5444.80s:  Fine, we'll just use the 21 days. So using the 21 days, what do you guys notice about this 36 Delta
5451.44s:  put as compared to this? I don't know why these are, oh, because the 10 and a halfs to like this 14
5459.92s:  Delta or 10 Delta or something like that. There's another really important component. There's another
5464.96s:  Greek that you guys need to look at.
5483.28s:  Gamma, bingo, that's exactly correct. That's exactly correct. It's gamma.
5488.16s:  So the reason why we care about gamma is because that tells us that the path of our returns
5496.72s:  has the potential to be super painful. If you have an option that has a higher gamma,
5504.16s:  it tells us that its Delta's can move a lot and it tells us that the overall position will move
5511.04s:  tremendously more. So if you take a look at this 36 Delta option here, it is a gamma of 28.
5518.88s:  If you take a look at the 14, 10 Delta, whatever this actually is because the options are kind of messed
5522.72s:  up here, this one has a gamma of eight. So that means for every one point move in the underlying,
5533.28s:  down here, your deltas are going to move by 28. And for every one point move in the underlying
5540.32s:  here, your deltas are going to move by eight. Much, much, much different behavior of the position.
5548.16s:  So that's why the decision of selecting deltas matters a lot. And that's why there's not a set
5554.80s:  answer on what Delta to pick for something like a Strangle because it heavily depends on the product.
5560.40s:  It heavily depends on how this thing fits into your portfolio and how you want to manage it.
5564.48s:  Those are all the nuance details. So for example, let's say that, I mean, let's literally go
5570.88s:  through an example. But before that, actually, let's take a quick look. We already saw this one
5577.60s:  on this idea of how much effort goes into being successful. I think we already talked about that.
5585.52s:  We can kind of, this is perfect timing. We've talked about a bunch of those already. We can skip over
5591.52s:  that. Here, this is a great one. So we actually talked about this before. So do you guys remember
5600.32s:  when who was it? Somebody was asking about that stock that we were looking at the re and they
5613.92s:  said, what do you think about a vertical in there? That's this, right? So that's a really,
5620.56s:  really common error and issue that traders will make. It's literally quintessential. It's
5627.60s:  like so common, right? That's why it's here. That whoever I did that example with, they did this
5633.44s:  exact thing where we focus on some element of a structure and not on the profit mechanism.
5644.24s:  So the misconception here is that a structure somehow makes a trade profitable.
5649.84s:  And it doesn't. A structure is just a way to capture a profit mechanism.
5656.40s:  Profit mechanism is what makes us money. So that's actually a great example of what we were
5664.40s:  reviewing before. Now, to take this example into this example now, this idea of a profit mechanism,
5671.12s:  if we're thinking about trading VRP, let's just pick something random.
5679.04s:  MSOS looks okay. That I don't love. GME looks great, but this is a unicorn. I would not have
5688.48s:  naked options in it. Same thing with Chui. Let's use something like MSOS. We use something slightly
5696.24s:  different. MSOS, let's say that we want to structure a variance risk premium trade in here. Let's
5702.24s:  just say for whatever reason we like it, it doesn't look bad to me. And it doesn't have earnings coming
5707.36s:  up too soon. It doesn't look like. So now let me just double check really quick. I'm going to change
5714.24s:  this time frame so that it is just a little further out. Yeah. So it doesn't have earnings coming
5725.04s:  up just yet. So we have a little bit of time here. So let's say we want to structure our strangle.
5731.36s:  Let's say that we want to keep it in a primary expiration and we're stuck between two.
5737.04s:  You can either do 21 or 56. Neither one of these are optimal. So for me, depending on how the
5742.96s:  portfolio fits and all that kind of stuff, I'm going to trend towards this one, the 56. A little
5748.32s:  bit longer in duration. But for this style trade, I don't care about that. And it's for a bunch
5756.32s:  of different things. Now opening this up, let's see what's in here. Benoit says pot ETF could be
5768.56s:  affected by political. Of course, yeah, that's the thing is everything has risks, right? Like, yeah,
5774.40s:  and I obviously appreciate the call out, but that doesn't matter to me. I'm coming in here literally
5779.28s:  to make money. So I expect to take risk. So if we take a look at something like this 32 delta
5789.44s:  and this 32 delta and we plot this now, again, this is in a pass through account that doesn't have
5797.12s:  any money. And the reason why that matters is because this is not a portfolio margin account. So we
5802.32s:  can see what the margin of requirement would be for most people, which is super cheap, $837.
5809.60s:  So in this case, we'd be taking in about 83 bucks and we're putting up, let's just call it like
5816.80s:  850, something like that. So it gives you a 9.8% return over that 56 days. Now that does tell me
5824.24s:  that the risk in this is elevated because that is a pretty high return. Now the other thing I need
5830.80s:  to see is how do I want to manage this? Well, my break even to the downside is let's call it six,
5837.52s:  six bucks, something like that. And that puts me at a $45 loss if we get there. And to the upside,
5849.76s:  it's about, let's call it 10 bucks a little bit less than that, like 986. And that puts us at an
5858.40s:  $80 loss. So now I can go through the process of seeing what the probabilities is of those being
5865.44s:  hit, which is super simple. We do that in here. Based on that information, I validate that the risk
5871.12s:  makes sense compared to where I would be managing the trade. And then let's just assume that it makes
5876.32s:  sense 986 down to six. I would come in here and I would say, okay, I need to start getting out of
5884.40s:  this trade if it gets up to 986. So let's call it 970. I need an alert for up or above that. And then
5892.64s:  down to six, I need an alert a little higher than that. Give me a minute to see it. So give it like
5898.64s:  six, 14, something like that. At or below that. And then trade goes off. So then the other scenario
5910.40s:  would be, okay, maybe I can trade this. What is this? 14 delta and this 14 delta. And we can
5919.44s:  compare this in this case. I am making 30. So I'm making quite a bit less than the 83 that I would see.
5934.16s:  And if we have a move against us again, break even to the downside is about 570. And at that
5942.16s:  point, I would be losing 43 bucks. And to the upside break even is at 1130. And I'd be losing about
5949.36s:  123 bucks. So the first thing you'll notice is I have better break evens. But I have worse severity
5956.88s:  when I get there. That is everything to do with the fact that I've collected way less money.
5961.28s:  I collect it only 30 bucks as compared to 83. What's the payoff here? I have a much higher
5966.40s:  probability of this trade working out. So let's just use the worst scenario for a quick example.
5972.00s:  Let's say to the upside, my risk is at 1130. And I would be realizing a $124 loss. So if we look
5981.36s:  at 1130, the probability of hitting that in 20 September, look at the probability of a touch.
5987.92s:  What's the probability of us hitting 1130?
5994.00s:  17.8% probability of being stopped out to the upside within our time frame.
6000.24s:  And then I forgot what it was in the other trade. It was like 9 something, right?
6006.40s:  971, I think it was like 980. So let's say in the same time frame, what's the probability of us
6012.32s:  hitting 980? 37% chance. So there's a much higher probability of being stopped out in this trade
6022.08s:  than this trade. But you make more in this trade than you do in this trade. So now that's taking
6028.72s:  it to expiration. If I wanted to analyze, okay, I don't want to take it all the way to expiration.
6034.40s:  Let's say that I hold it until there's maybe 14 days left, something like that, something about
6040.88s:  two weeks or something around here. What's the probability then? If instead of managing it at the
6047.60s:  equivalent of this 20 September expiration, I'm managing it in the same DTE equivalent. If I were to
6053.36s:  leave two weeks left, which would put me here at like the 30 aug. Now what's the probability of me
6059.04s:  hitting that 980? That probability is now 27% chance. And then the 1130 is like a 9.7% chance.
6077.12s:  So this is the game. And you have to figure out what makes the most sense. There is absolutely no
6084.48s:  right or wrong answer. But that's the exact process you can go through to see what makes sense.
6091.68s:  Let me know if the answer is a question for you guys.
6095.92s:  Hussein says, would you consider Delta for regular options calls puts? Of course, Delta is one of
6101.52s:  the primary inputs for literally every single trade that goes on unequivocally. The sheet says all
6107.76s:  things equal look for the highest ratio of Delta gamma. Nope, not at all. That will change massively.
6114.00s:  Again, depending on the disposition, what I'm trying to trade, the underlying thesis.
6119.36s:  So I would not personally look for that. No. It's a good guess. But yeah.
6134.40s:  Tom says, if I myself picking Delta based on strikes that align with my perception of support
6139.28s:  and resistance, yeah, it doesn't matter. So like picking the Delta at those levels doesn't matter.
6150.96s:  Because again, like that's not necessarily where the trade management is. You could essentially
6156.96s:  think about the idea of structuring the trade so that you would manage it at those support
6163.84s:  and resistance levels. So let's say, for example, you thought resistance was at 907 and you
6170.88s:  would want to get out for something that is above that. You can do that. You can structure your
6178.48s:  position so that it makes sense for management. But make that selection based off Delta and
6184.96s:  putting your Delta where you think that is to me. It's not, it doesn't make sense. It doesn't
6191.28s:  align unless you're just managing it when it gets to the strike inherently. But again,
6195.04s:  that's not how I do it. But if you were doing it that way, then at least would make more sense.
6202.72s:  Benoit says, what time of day do you typically put on trades for new positions? This is a great question
6207.12s:  typically towards the end of the day. It depends on for a new position, like a net new position.
6213.12s:  If I manage and trade, sometimes it'll be throughout the day, kind of whenever it comes up.
6217.84s:  And then I do put trades on and off in the morning again. Sometimes people I think they get too
6223.52s:  binary when we have conversations like this. So it's important to reiterate that it's not that I never
6230.24s:  put trades on earlier, but I typically will put them on towards the end of the day. There's a
6234.64s:  different kind of liquidity that happens then. And you miss the first hour illiquidity and volatility
6240.80s:  rush, which I don't want to be a part of just because you get way sloppier fills.
6245.44s:  So unless there's a specific reason for me to get filled or to enter at those times, I typically
6253.04s:  avoid it. Iceman says, when managing a trade that touches your break evens, do you consider the
6262.64s:  amount of days that have passed prior to it touching? That is how quickly it touches.
6269.28s:  No. So I assume we're talking about this trade that we were looking at.
6275.44s:  So specifically looking at the idea of like a short strangle like a variance risk premium style
6281.36s:  trade, because the reason why I'm coming with that assumption is because that answer also would
6285.20s:  depend entirely on the strategy and what's being traded. But if I have something that hits the
6293.60s:  management point, then I would manage the trade. It doesn't matter if it happens quick. It
6298.40s:  doesn't matter if it happens later. When it's time to manage that position, that's why those things
6303.76s:  get defined before entry. And it has to marry up to the thesis. It's really, really important
6310.00s:  for those things to line up.
6313.84s:  Should we say how about picking by gamma? Now I wouldn't I wouldn't pick by gamma. I would have
6319.60s:  no issue for like obviously heavily including gamma. So like for example, if I am trying to trade
6330.16s:  a long call strategy that includes an element that might rapidly expand the basis, what I would
6337.20s:  refer to them as kicker options, then the gamma matters a lot. That is an important decision
6343.36s:  component of that position. But I wouldn't pick just off of gamma because I still would
6349.52s:  prioritize things like delta. So yeah, their gamma can have heavier waiting in some instances,
6358.96s:  but I don't think I would base a trade completely off of it personally.
6364.00s:  Behemoth says, is it important to be mechanical buying back options like the TACE method of 50% profit?
6370.56s:  That's a great question. What do you guys think? If you guys were to answer Behemoth's question
6376.00s:  with him or to explore that concept, what do you guys think? Because there's a few things that come
6383.28s:  to my mind with that specific thing. Chewie says kicker gamma so higher gamma number? Yeah, exactly.
6390.40s:  So if I'm adding kicker options, which are lower probability of payout, but a higher compounding
6395.52s:  capability, I would use things that have higher gamma. Tom says, based on the expectancy of the trade,
6401.04s:  that's part of it. That's actually not the first part in my opinion, but that's definitely
6404.72s:  as part of it. What else do you guys think? Depends on your portfolio. That's a great component.
6413.84s:  And you guys are, I'm converting you guys to be it depends people. So you too will piss off
6420.24s:  everybody that asks you a simple question when you respond with it depends. Shane says, based on
6426.96s:  what I've been told, having a set rules is beneficial. Can be I agree? So here's what I would say.
6435.52s:  I think it depends on the strategy as you design it. So if you have a strategy that's a little more
6446.56s:  geared towards discretionary, I don't think being purely mechanical is good. And I think the
6453.44s:  trader needs to maintain discretion. However, it also cannot be a random selection of things.
6463.04s:  So the way I look at that is I make sure that whatever rules set I'm applying generally makes sense.
6472.64s:  That's the first thing. So the next thing is to make sure exactly as Tom highlighted,
6481.76s:  because if your strategy is baked on taking 50% profit, that's okay. But it needs to have an
6492.56s:  effective expected return based on that parameter. So the first decision that really depends on what
6503.92s:  route I would take that answer is if we're trying to devise a more mechanical strategy, if it's
6510.00s:  more mechanical than yes, we need to decide how that mechanic mechanical approach will play out.
6516.96s:  If it's a more discretionary approach than no, then I think that that can actually be a problem
6522.56s:  and it needs to be a little more individualized to the opportunity. The issue that you have with
6528.16s:  things like taking things at a blanket 50% profit is it really does depend on how you're managing the
6534.64s:  losing side of the trade and does it maintain positive expected return. Paulus says why 50% and not
6543.12s:  30 or 80. The reason why places like tasty trade do that is because they're trying to provide people
6551.92s:  a generally applicable set of rules to simplify things. That's why. So when you think about something
6563.04s:  like why 50% is because it applies to a lot of strategies in a lot of circumstances where it
6569.92s:  generally is okay. It loses a lot of specificity, which obviously I look for, I care about the details.
6578.96s:  So that's why I don't do something like that. Now for me, if I'm trading a more mechanical
6584.00s:  variation of something like my zero DTE SPX strategies, for those kinds of things, I have a more
6590.56s:  mechanical profit taking approach applied. And it's because it's like a numerically based strategies,
6597.36s:  the same thing with things like earnings plays. But for things like ratio diagonals where there's
6602.96s:  a lot more discretion involved, I don't apply that same methodology. So it does depend quite a lot
6611.60s:  on the strategy. It's a good question though. Fan of Airplane says, Hey, do you think GME is a good
6620.24s:  spot to write covered calls? I am conflicted because IV keeps dropping, but I would like to make some
6624.80s:  money while the stock trade sideways. I mean, yeah, if you have long shares and you want to write
6630.80s:  calls against them, then that's okay. The component of IV contracting, that's one component of the
6638.72s:  trade, but like GameStop still has high IV. It's 90 and a half percent. So you're going to get
6645.44s:  still a completely healthy return for selling calls. Now to your point, you're not going to make as
6651.44s:  much if IVP were higher, but that still doesn't mean that you're not going to make money. You still
6656.56s:  absolutely will make money provided that it does what you want, meaning not go blow through your
6662.64s:  short straight. Then obviously the short call will lose. But when trading something like covered
6668.08s:  calls for me, volatility specifically IVP or the relative volatility level, it's secondary. I don't
6676.32s:  care as much about that. As long as I'm getting a decent amount of money as far as I can see,
6681.60s:  on what I'm capping in terms of upside potential and I'm okay with that trade off, then it's fine.
6687.36s:  But I wouldn't not make that kind of trade just because implied volatility is low and it might
6696.24s:  go against you temporarily because that doesn't really matter. If you're going to hold the trade,
6701.36s:  then it still would make the money. It just would be a potential loser in the interim.
6707.04s:  So yeah, I wouldn't care about that at all.
6711.68s:  Next question or next misconception, options are too risky. You guys should know to the end.
6717.04s:  You guys should know the answer to this one by now. It's not that options are too risky or not
6721.76s:  risky enough. It is simply that options take whatever risk you give them. That's it. That's literally
6729.12s:  all there is to this. You can structure options trades that are very risky. You can structure
6735.28s:  options trades that are not risky at all. It is completely up to the way you build the trade.
6742.96s:  This one you guys should know about as well. So if you're buying a long call or a long put,
6748.96s:  there's a widely misunderstood concept that the stock price has to go to the strike price
6757.76s:  in order for you to make money. That's not the case. Why is that not the case? In the meantime,
6764.24s:  I'm going to answer Silly Russians question, which is just hopped on. I want to say I love you
6770.48s:  in noon. Yeah, noon is awesome. Any tips on how to stop being a greedy degenerate? It can be
6775.36s:  very self sabotaging with a tiny cash account. Yeah. I think for that, it comes down to developing a
6782.24s:  better roadmap for yourself that you respect. If you do not have respect for the roadmap that
6790.00s:  you've built for yourself, then there's no real incentive for you to follow it, especially if
6795.04s:  you're the kind of person to think that this short term price movement can essentially change
6800.16s:  your life and that you should put all your money on it. The way I think about it is if you develop
6806.08s:  a roadmap that you're highly, highly convicted in, then it's much easier to make those shorter-term
6813.84s:  sacrifices and stuff like that and to focus on the broader plan. So what does that look like? Really
6819.12s:  simple. Not that. Trying to grab this. It looks like this. If I'm 21 and I have $15,000
6836.56s:  saved and by the time I'm 35, I know I want to have over a million bucks. Well, it tells me a few
6850.48s:  things. It tells me I'm going to need to have a better rate of return and it tells me I'm going to need
6855.36s:  to get really good at saving money. So if I get to the point where on average, I'm able to save $1,000
6866.00s:  a month over the course of 14 years and my return, I can target something around 15%
6877.36s:  on close, but not quite. So you can see if I save just $100 more per month, I would be at $640,000.
6888.88s:  So depending on what this number feels like to you, then, and again, it's important because when
6894.56s:  you're 21, will you be able to put this away? Probably not. Depending on how much money you make
6899.68s:  at 21, but it's probably not going to be enough to support that. But what I'm talking about is this
6904.40s:  on average, because you had better believed by the time you're in your late 20s, early 30s, you
6909.84s:  should be putting away way more than this. And if you're not doing that, you're not living
6916.64s:  essentially a viable lifestyle for your broader objectives and you need to go into what I like to
6922.16s:  call monk mode. That's what I spent most of my early 20s and what I call monk mode. And it's so
6927.60s:  that I could really amplify this and maximize my contributions as much as humanly possible.
6934.64s:  So then you could say, well, maybe I am able to save that extra $100 a month, makes a pretty big
6940.16s:  difference. And now let's say you look at a slightly different return variance profile, where you
6945.84s:  say, well, plus or minus 3%, how can I do? And well, you realize if you're able to do 3% better
6952.56s:  than this 15 and that puts you at 18, now you're at $823,000. This takes somebody from a $15,000
6961.20s:  account saving on average $11,000, which is a lot. But again, if you're able to get to this point
6968.88s:  and compensate later in your compounding approach on average, it'll still work out for you.
6975.84s:  Then over a 14 year time span, by the time you're in your mid 30s, you can be very close to
6983.28s:  having that million dollars. So then the other thing you could say, well, maybe instead of when I'm 30,
6989.28s:  I could maybe do it, well, instead of 35, maybe I could do what I'm 40. So that'll take us here.
6995.44s:  And now all of a sudden, that's now completely possible. And you have $1.3 million. So then we could
7001.12s:  say, well, instead of then saving that much money on a monthly basis, maybe I save 800 bucks,
7006.80s:  which is even more doable, but you've given yourself a longer runway. So what I'm highlighting
7012.08s:  is going through this process. You literally can use this tool. It's why I fucking built it on my
7016.80s:  website because I use this all the time myself. But it'll give you a lot of clarity. So then going
7022.72s:  all the way back to this idea of like being a greedy degenerate. Well, if I realize that the path
7028.48s:  of being a greedy degenerate can include stuff like this where I might have really good years,
7036.80s:  but then if I have one not good year, it actually can really derail my growth. So for example,
7044.24s:  Portfolio one here, both starting with $100,000, Portfolio one has a 10% return, 10%, 2%, 10%,
7051.28s:  5%. The best year in Portfolio one does not outperform the worst positive return from Portfolio three.
7064.72s:  They both have generally positive years, but Portfolio three has one negative year, that one negative
7071.12s:  year, even though they have a better average return of 8.6%, their compound annual growth rate is
7077.28s:  6.87% over this five year period. So what I'm highlighting is that this drawdown is a massive
7086.00s:  problem because this drawdown of 25%, it needs a 33.3% return to recover back to break even.
7095.68s:  So when you make these mistakes as a greedy new trader trying to grow a small amount of money into
7101.28s:  a big amount of money, the only thing we do is move the goalpost backwards. That's it.
7110.16s:  So that's the way and that's really the general tip and advice I would give to somebody that's
7116.96s:  struggling with that is to develop a process in a roadmap that you believe in that you're comfortable
7125.84s:  that you're willing to commit to and then commit to it because the world of trading is interesting.
7134.96s:  In my early 20s when I compared myself to all of my friends, I was actually worse off than a lot of them.
7142.00s:  And then in my mid 20s I started noticing a little bit of a difference. Then in my late 20s I started
7147.20s:  noticing a pretty big difference. Now in my early 30s I noticed a massive difference between me
7154.40s:  and most of my friends where at completely different places financially and it's because of adherence
7162.24s:  to this while a lot of them in their early 20s were fucking around. They wanted to go out to the
7169.04s:  bars have a bunch of fun which I get that that's really attractive that's super fun. But it's really
7175.76s:  difficult to essentially become a self-made millionaire without making sacrifices of some sort.
7183.20s:  They got to come from somewhere and if you want to do that in a relatively compressed time frame
7192.08s:  like by your late 20s or early 30s you have to sacrifice even more. But if you do it can be very
7202.72s:  worth it. That's the tip that's the advice. Create a plan that you truly believe in and then prioritize
7212.56s:  the plan. It's exactly what I would do. It's exactly what I did. I think that that works exceedingly well.
7220.40s:  Let me know if that answers your question silly Russian. Now going back to this who saying says
7229.76s:  because of things such as time volatility price movement up or down that's not it actually.
7234.96s:  The reason why this is a common misconception and why this doesn't matter is like you don't need
7241.60s:  the underlying to go to your strike to make money on a long option. As long as it goes in your direction
7248.96s:  the option will make money. Again, Cetero's Parabus everything else remaining the same. Let's look at
7254.24s:  an example. If we look at let's go to Tesla and let's go here to 25 June.
7275.92s:  Let's buy.
7276.56s:  This might be even better actually. Let's go to the 12th something that's not as aggressive of a move.
7292.16s:  Because then the 13th there is a decent size move. Let's see.
7295.84s:  So here. Oh, I just got such a good hip hop. It's like that really satisfying crack.
7306.24s:  And now my nose is super itchy. I realize that when I talk a lot my nose gets itchy. I don't know what
7312.16s:  that is. I actually think it's like my nose hairs that are vibrating too much. Fun fact, by the way.
7319.76s:  All right, let's see these options. And then let's do something that's like 37 days out.
7328.72s:  And let's pick out of the money option. Let's pick these 190s.
7334.32s:  So let's pretend that those got put on for like 590. Now let's fast forward to the 13th.
7342.32s:  Let's see what happened here. So on the 13th we had a little gap up a little bit of
7356.96s:  all because we gapped up and started closing back down. But you can see we're not at our strike.
7363.36s:  Our strike I think was 190 something like that. Yeah, but look what happened.
7372.80s:  We got in for 590. It's trading for 1120 now.
7379.12s:  This option made a decent amount of money. Yet it did not hit our strike.
7385.84s:  It went in the correct direction. The other thing notice, this isn't some really short term dated
7392.88s:  option. These are 36 DTE options. And this is looking at the passage of a single day.
7402.16s:  Yet the trade made money. How is that? It's because you don't need the underlying to go to your strike
7413.44s:  in order to make money. Like that's literally the punchline to this. It doesn't need to do that.
7419.92s:  You can make money with this kind of position as long as you get in a accommodating move. This is
7426.08s:  another really common misconception. All right, we got another question here from Paulo. When do you
7433.52s:  roll a strangle into a straddle versus realize loss? I don't really roll them into straddles very
7438.40s:  much. And realizing a loss typically happens at the predefined PNL target. I don't bother rolling
7449.12s:  things like straddles or strangles too frequently. If it's not working, it's not working. I'll close the
7455.60s:  trade except that it didn't work and then just move on to another trade. Something like that.
7461.92s:  There's not a giant benefit to me to keep attempting to force the trade to work.
7470.48s:  I tend to take slightly more care in terms of how I'm selecting PNL targets and stuff like that.
7477.36s:  That's not to say again that I never will roll, but that's definitely just not my go to.
7483.76s:  I typically will do a slightly simpler approach on setting targets ahead of time.
7491.36s:  Next one. Buying is better than selling your vice versa. This is one of the most common
7496.72s:  misconceptions I see. There is this wild misconception that theta is some sort of edge.
7504.48s:  That's another kind of tied version of this. So if one was better than the other, why would anybody
7514.00s:  do the other? Just doesn't make sense. So the way to think about buying or selling is they both
7523.76s:  have their strengths and weaknesses. They both have their pros and their cons. But one is not inherently
7531.20s:  better than the other. They do different things. That's the way to think about that.
7537.92s:  This is a really common one. You guys, I bet you some of you probably think this right now.
7542.32s:  There's 40 of you on the stream right now. My guess is at least one of you probably think this
7548.16s:  that if you're selling options that going further out of the money is safer.
7554.16s:  What does that mean to you? And why do you think I might frame it as that might not be the truth?
7561.60s:  That might not be the case. Any ideas? And then silly Russian says absolutely going to
7568.48s:  dive in your resources. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great. There's a lot that you can do. If I were
7574.48s:  in your shoes, silly Russian, you can check out like my 101 playlists. I think that's where I would go.
7587.20s:  So silly Russian, this one Ben Wallace says it's just less likely to happen, but when it does,
7593.12s:  it will be worse. Will it be worse though?
7595.84s:  So, for example, let's flip the script here. Let's look at here 22 April to 29 April. Let's go there real quick.
7615.44s:  22 April. Let's say we sell a call. We know it's going to go up. Let's sell a call. We'll sell two calls.
7626.16s:  Because Ben Wallace, what you're seeing actually is not fully correct. And I want to show you why.
7638.88s:  So in this case, let's pick a 30 Delta short here. Let me, I'm going to throw this in the chat so
7649.92s:  that I remember. So the 155 calls is at 440. We'll just do it at the natural price. So we'll do the
7660.96s:  Celta open here. And these are a 31 Delta. So 0.31 Delta.
7669.76s:  Now, let's take a look at these ones.
7672.72s:  So, to open the 190 calls, you're going to get 53 cents for those. And then those are at a 0.05 Delta.
7692.56s:  Cool. Now, let's go forward. What is it like a week to the 29th, I said?
7702.96s:  Yeah. That's right. Let's see what happens here.
7717.04s:  So our five Delta's, which were the 190's here, they become 47 Delta's.
7728.16s:  And they represent essentially like 785, something like that. So now we sold something for 53.
7747.76s:  We got to buy it back for 785. So that's a negative 7732.
7758.48s:  loss on the 0 0 5 Delta. Now, let's take a look at these 155's. These are now trading for 3282.
7770.96s:  So we sold something for 440. And we have to close it out for 3282. That's a negative 2842.
7783.04s:  Negative 2842 on the 31 Delta. So what do you guys think about that? Does that align with what
7800.48s:  Benoit showed us? It does not. Why is that? Why does it behave that way? There's a few things
7815.36s:  you have to pay attention to. Benoit says, but the position size was very different. The risk
7820.56s:  capital wasn't the same. It's a one lot for both. So the margin requirement for both of these is
7827.60s:  not going to be wildly different. It will be different to your point, but I don't think it will
7832.32s:  be wildly different. Let's double check. So we went back in time again. We're going to check at
7837.84s:  these. What is the 155's? Yeah. Let's see what the margin requirement is for these.
7841.92s:  These want 2600 bucks. Now, let's take a look at the 05's. These want 2,100 bucks. So no, I also
7861.60s:  disagree with you there, Benoit. The position size is actually not that different. This is
7866.72s:  T margin. They're going to require very, very similar sizes based on a naked short call that are
7871.84s:  only this far apart. So also good guess, but also incorrect. It's super simple. The reason why these
7890.24s:  don't lose more money as a gross dollar amount is because they have a lower delta.
7896.88s:  It's literally the start of the trade because remember, these 155's are going to have a higher
7905.84s:  gamma and a higher delta. So after we get that first $1 move against us, these 155's are going to
7918.00s:  move against us $31. These 5's are only going to move against us $5. That's it. That's on the
7928.72s:  first $1 move. The gamma on these super far out of the money options hasn't started to change
7936.96s:  that much yet. So maybe on that next dollar move, you only lose 5 bucks again. In this case,
7944.08s:  your gamma already gained one gamma. So your 31 delta's became 32. So you lost 31 bucks on the
7951.28s:  first point move. Now 32 bucks on the second point move. So you have what? 63 bucks lost on a
7959.20s:  two point move. $10 loss, two point move. It's exactly why that the severity on these is not going
7968.00s:  to be as bad because they're further away. Now the caveat here is that the return on the risk
7977.52s:  is slightly different because these, you're only collecting 50 cents. These are collecting $4
7983.44s:  and change. So the return on the risk has a slightly different profile. But the further out of
7990.56s:  the money, that that's the tradeoff. That's why you make so much less is because there's a lot less
7997.84s:  risk total in this position. Now you have to also think about the realized PNL or the realized loss
8007.76s:  against what you stood to gain the return on your risk. And if you don't have such an extreme
8014.48s:  example, but let's say you have an example where the underlying just goes to at the money.
8020.64s:  So let's say that let's just pretend that there's a move that takes these 155s and it makes them
8027.68s:  behave like these 140s where they go at the money. Right? So in this case, you stood to make $442.
8036.96s:  If we have that move that essentially takes us to be at the money, which would be here. It's about
8042.64s:  a 10 point move or a 15 point move. Let's say a 15 point move happens against those short calls.
8048.48s:  These, you sold them for $442. They'd be trading for $1010. Right? So that would be your loss.
8056.32s:  Now, let's say the same move happens for these 190s. You stood to make $53.
8064.88s:  You get a 15 point move. So these 190s would look like the 155s.
8074.48s:  Ish. A little further out. These would still show a lower loss, but it would be a higher relative
8085.44s:  loss to what you stood to make. So I think that's what Benoit was attempting to convey in that scenario.
8092.64s:  But that's only one scenario in a gross dollar amount. You'll still do better in terms of reducing
8098.16s:  your risk. So the reason why I say further out of the money, safer for short options as a
8104.96s:  misconception is because that perception of safety is relative to when risk is eventually
8112.40s:  realized because if you make 50 bucks, 50 bucks, 50 bucks in this scenario,
8123.04s:  right? So let's just use the same similar scenario here. You make $455 on these $235s.
8129.52s:  And let's say you do that a bunch of times and you make money. You make a bunch of money a few times.
8135.04s:  Five trades in. You've made that $455. Then on the sixth trade, it goes here. And you're now at
8142.24s:  $9. Well, this one you would have made money. Your system is okay. In this one, you probably didn't
8149.44s:  make money because let's just call it 50 cents. If you make 50 cents, 50 bucks, five times in a row,
8156.96s:  you get your $250, whatever. And then on your sixth trade, it goes here. You're now net loss.
8165.12s:  So the problem with the safer options being further out of the money is that when a big move
8171.76s:  eventually happens, it can be big enough to essentially kick you out of all of the profit you've
8177.52s:  made because it's not much. That's why they're not safer. Couple more. Being an options trader,
8184.56s:  what I alluding to here is don't be any kind of trader. Just be a trader. Don't be a day trader.
8190.24s:  Don't be a spread trader. Don't be a long trader. Don't be a short trader. Don't be a stock trader.
8194.48s:  Don't be an options trader. Just be a trader. Be whatever makes sense. Focus on making money.
8200.88s:  That's what matters here. Next thing is rolling avoids losses. This one's a pep of mine.
8209.60s:  Rolling does the exact opposite. Rolling realizes the PNL of a trade and it offers the opportunity
8220.24s:  in a new trade to overwhelm the previous losses. So this video is about rolling options,
8231.04s:  myths versus reality. This one is just kind of a general best practices master class.
8238.48s:  And then this one is kind of like a step-by-step guide on like the decision cycle behind rolling
8245.76s:  options. So those are three sources for you there. Last one. Market is out to get you.
8251.68s:  I put this in here because people like to blame all kinds of things all the time market
8256.08s:  makers trying to get them, somebody's trying to get them. And it again is handing the keys of
8261.92s:  control over to somebody else. And there's no reason to do that. It is all about taking as much
8269.52s:  responsibility as you can and figuring out how you can affect outcomes. That's what the entire
8276.96s:  entire focus is here. That alone. Nobody's out to get you. Nobody cares about you. They're just
8282.80s:  trying to make money just like other people are trying to make money. But by focusing on the things
8288.08s:  you can control, taking responsibility for things don't go your way. That feeds the system to
8295.04s:  eventually optimize it and find something that works. If you think something is out to get you,
8300.48s:  then it's really difficult to manage around that. It's not. The way that the market is out to get
8305.44s:  you is that it's competitive and it's looking for easy money. That's a thing. And that will be the
8309.76s:  case. And you have to learn how to operate in that environment. So these are 12 misconceptions
8317.92s:  related to options trading and obviously a bunch of individual random offshoots we took
8322.40s:  along the way. But I had a blast. I love talking about this stuff with you guys. The next session
8328.56s:  for next Friday will still be in options trading for beginners. I have a couple of other things
8333.92s:  I don't want to work through with you guys. And then we're going to transform this into what I would
8338.40s:  call an options trading boot camp series, which is just going to be pivoting it more to the practical
8343.28s:  application of this. And it will be less theoretical concepts. But I hope the information is useful for
8350.48s:  you. And as always, if you guys have any questions, let me know. And the last thing I'll note is
8355.28s:  tomorrow I am doing that GME live stream. If you guys want to check that out. And if you're not
8359.84s:  a part of the outlier discord, it's completely free to join. I encourage you to do so.
8363.92s:  Tons of cool people in there and great learning resources. So enjoy the rest of your evening
8369.36s:  for those that want to do the GME live stream. I'll see you tomorrow. And then for the outlier
8374.32s:  pro members, I'll see you Sunday for a market prep session. And thank you very much for TGO1
8380.96s:  for the $20. Really appreciate that. Thank you. That will go directly towards my dinner. That'll
8386.48s:  hook me up with the burrito carne asada burrito. That's the that's what we're targeting here. So
8390.88s:  thank you very much. I appreciate that generosity a lot. Thank you. Awesome you guys. I will see you all
8397.20s:  around being outlier. Catch you guys later.
