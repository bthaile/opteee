0.08s: I started trading options back in 2007
2.72s: while I was in high school and it's the
4.32s: primary way that I built my original
6.40s: layer of wealth the goal of this videoos
8.36s: to walk you through how I trade options
11.60s: the idea is to kind of pull together all
13.84s: these different concepts into one place
16.00s: to give you some ideas because what I do
17.72s: doesn't really matter to you but
19.92s: hopefully you can gain some different
21.56s: ideas Inspirations from some of the
23.36s: things that I do and maybe bake it into
24.80s: your process have better results going
26.44s: forward so you'll notice on the left
28.12s: hand side we have some guiding Concepts
30.00s: called what I pursue right hand side
31.88s: gets a little deeper into my actual
34.40s: approach let's start on the left- hand
35.96s: side with the guiding Concepts process
37.80s: driven what does this mean well when I
39.60s: first started trading the vast majority
41.84s: of what I did really had me focusing on
45.32s: the outcome of a single trade that
48.28s: sounds kind of important doesn't it why
50.16s: wouldn't I emphasize the outcome of a
52.24s: single trade well it's because I noticed
55.04s: that there was a propensity for me to
56.72s: start doing a lot of things that
58.44s: disagreed with my plan trying to salvage
61.28s: the individual trade and then I started
63.28s: noticing that I would deviate from the
64.96s: plan way more frequently trying to
66.64s: salvage other trades then I noticed that
69.32s: essentially I wasn't doing anything
71.48s: related to the plan and I had nothing to
74.12s: lean on to figure out what I was doing
75.68s: wrong because I was just doing whatever
77.64s: I wanted so the idea behind process
80.08s: driven is that my goal is to create
83.16s: something that's repeatable for the long
85.32s: run one of the biggest mistakes I made
87.56s: as a early Trader and I imagine same
89.20s: with a lot of other people people is I
90.52s: had the idea that I was going to turn my
92.44s: $5,000 account $33,000 account $115,000
96.36s: account into my future wealth the
98.20s: reality is that's not going to happen
100.40s: for the vast majority of people it's
102.40s: going to take a lot of saving more money
106.16s: making more money by achieving better
108.64s: jobs while you're saving more and in
111.52s: third lever you can pull is getting
113.52s: better at trading so in this scenario by
116.64s: focusing on the individual trade
118.08s: outcomes I'm sitting here trying to put
120.12s: the cart in front of the horse thinking
121.80s: well if I can just get a bunch of money
123.16s: really fast on these trades I'll be set
124.84s: and it's a really naive perspective it
126.84s: doesn't bear out so the main thing I
129.20s: remind myself is that everything I do
131.48s: feeds a process that I should be able to
134.20s: execute not over the next week month
136.64s: year 5 years 10 years literally over
139.12s: several decades is the idea and that
141.60s: leans to what you see down here number
143.96s: five is robustness what I do needs to
147.56s: make sense not just today not just in
150.08s: the current market environment but how
151.92s: can I create an approach that allows me
154.28s: to stay up to dat with what the Market's
156.60s: doing because for example if we take a
158.44s: look at a chart and we go back let's
160.16s: check out SPX and then let's go back
162.24s: like 5 years you'll notice that SPX over
164.72s: the last 5 years has done different
166.16s: things it had this really steep decline
168.20s: during covid then stimulus checks came
170.44s: out started skyrocketing back up came
172.48s: back down went sideways for a little bit
174.12s: and then it started grinding back up so
176.04s: if you develop an approach that does
178.00s: well here and only here here it lacks
180.88s: robustness it means that you don't have
183.00s: the skill set to trade this kind of
185.24s: environment or this kind of environment
187.32s: or maybe a slower drift up and the idea
191.16s: is to be able to trade all of those
193.04s: conditions because over your trading
194.96s: career you'll see many different
197.20s: conditions so process driven we want to
199.56s: be focusing on how am I building
202.52s: something that stands the test of time
204.52s: that I can continually optimize over
206.76s: time worrying less about the individual
209.04s: trades worrying more how each individual
211.40s: trade fits into a broader system
213.68s: accepting the fact that that's going to
215.08s: include losing positions and that's
216.68s: entirely okay the second Point here is
219.32s: strong convictions loosely held so when
221.52s: I first started trading I would kind of
223.16s: go after whatever I heard sounded good
226.12s: at the time and again highly naive
228.96s: approach because when you're first
230.92s: starting out you don't have the depth of
233.16s: experience to kind of intuition your way
235.48s: through what may or may not make sense
238.00s: so then you just kind of start doing it
239.84s: for a little bit and then abandon it
241.36s: when it's not working periodically you
243.52s: don't really have anything to show for
244.76s: it so the idea behind strong convictions
246.84s: loosely held it's like basian analysis
249.00s: what I want to do is do a bunch of
250.84s: research on something quantify how
253.44s: strong something is and then as I get
255.40s: new information injected update my
258.68s: analysis so great example is actually
260.68s: this past year in rut the Russell and
263.92s: this past year if I pull this out
265.72s: year-to date when the year started I was
268.24s: positioned long Russell and the reason
270.32s: for that is because we were coming out
272.16s: of this really high rate environment and
274.96s: the market was starting to forecast Cuts
277.36s: as early as March I knew that that was
279.48s: going to be front ran by the market I
281.36s: didn't want to miss the opportunity
283.36s: there so I'm positioning myself long I
285.72s: wait a month and not much is happening
288.40s: right so if we look here at the end of
290.56s: January compared to the beginning we we
292.32s: just did not do much and I was like hm
294.40s: okay this is taking a little bit longer
296.04s: rate environment's changing it's getting
297.72s: pushed out maybe I need to give it a
299.12s: little bit longer longer instead of
300.52s: March now it's looking like kind of
301.88s: middle of the Year okay fine I wait
303.68s: another month so the end of January
305.40s: takes us to the end of February I start
307.12s: to see some movement but if you look at
309.40s: this in context it's not much the market
311.84s: opened over here at like 2010 and
314.88s: towards the end of February it hit like
317.68s: less than 2100 so it just didn't move
320.88s: that much so I started repositioning my
323.08s: portfolio because even though I believed
326.52s: that when the rate environment was going
328.56s: to change that we would see small caps
330.88s: move that's what I believe that was the
332.72s: thesis it wasn't happening so the strong
334.88s: conviction was in that thesis loosely
337.32s: held was as soon as it wasn't doing what
339.88s: I thought it should do in a reasonable
341.24s: amount of time it was time to do
342.56s: something else and that's when I rotate
344.68s: into things like the NASDAQ which was
347.64s: actually starting to move really strong
350.08s: it doesn't look like it because it looks
351.48s: flatter here but that's because of the
352.92s: magnitude of the moves it started the
354.76s: year at like 16604 and then by marchish
358.52s: it was at 183 350 so it already had made
361.84s: Fair move in the same time frame and
364.28s: realistically what I was starting to
365.84s: Pivot into was tle q's and that's
368.16s: because it's essentially slightly
370.20s: magnified version of this showing a lot
372.64s: of strength so that's the idea behind
375.76s: basing analysis is I want to formulate a
378.84s: really wellth thought out perspective
380.56s: that's Based on data that I can
382.20s: objectively analyze but then I want to
383.76s: be sensitive to new information hard and
385.68s: soft quantifiable Edge what this means
387.80s: is I want to have different modalities
389.92s: to make money and you'll see that over
392.04s: here a little bit more in detail when we
393.64s: get to this section but to give you an
395.36s: example of hard Edge versus soft Edge
398.04s: very simple if we take a look at
400.16s: something like the Russell when it
402.68s: started making this breakout move I
404.92s: traded this breakout and then I followed
407.16s: it up this was based on momentum that
409.92s: broader thesis but all of that boils
412.44s: down to stuff that I was able to
414.72s: quantify research around but it's still
416.56s: very discretionary it I had the same
418.64s: thesis here and it didn't work right so
420.68s: here it did it's a discretionary trade
423.12s: because I'm front running a move
425.20s: hopefully with the rest of the market
426.80s: but this is something that takes a ton
428.80s: of different experiences together in my
430.56s: mind as I'm creating this idea it's
432.04s: discretionary in nature meanwhile for an
434.28s: idea of a hard Edge if we take a look at
437.04s: Apple and we take a look at its earnings
439.24s: we look through Apple's earnings out of
441.04s: the past eight earnings here six of them
444.20s: the implied volatility was higher than
446.96s: the realized or historical volatility
449.56s: here here here here here and here what
452.80s: am i showing you this is a
455.60s: longstanding market function where
457.92s: implied volatility leading into earnings
460.24s: tends to be overstated compared to
462.44s: realized volatility this is not unique
464.32s: to Apple this is across earnings in
466.16s: general this is a known phenomenon that
469.20s: is a hard Edge it's something everybody
472.12s: knows exists and it's there anyways for
474.72s: a bunch of different reasons that I'm
476.00s: not going to get into in this video but
477.88s: it's not really discretionary I mean
479.60s: essentially just running an analysis
481.56s: based on a persistent Trend and trying
483.64s: to trade that so a completely different
485.76s: profit mechanism baked in here combined
488.00s: analysis simply means I'm going to use
490.12s: all data points that are relevant to
492.08s: what I'm doing so I'm not a fundamental
494.52s: analyst I'm not a technical analyst I'm
496.64s: a whatever analyst my main job is to
499.24s: make sure that what I'm doing aligns
502.16s: with what analysis I require so for
504.28s: example going back to the rut in this
507.44s: position I had the thesis I had that was
510.44s: baked on a lot of fundamental concepts
513.16s: High inflation depression of small caps
515.36s: due to that those kinds of things
517.12s: there's a lot of fundamental components
518.52s: to that from a technical perspective I'm
520.20s: using that to lock in my timing so even
522.72s: though I still had the thesis here from
524.60s: a technical perspective it was not
525.96s: lining up so then I need to do something
527.72s: else but that combines both fundamental
530.52s: and technical analysis into a cohesive
532.76s: picture I'm essentially going to wait
534.96s: the fundamental and technical analysis
537.28s: differently based on what I'm Trading
539.56s: robustness we already hit 1% growth
542.40s: sustained is simple the devil is in the
544.56s: details and it can take you really far
546.84s: in trading and I give you this example
548.48s: down here this is looking at a
550.24s: hypothetical scenario over 30 years
552.92s: where we start with $25,000 and we save
557.00s: $115,000 per month at 15% return versus
560.80s: 16% return 1% variance at the end of
564.04s: that leads to a $2.2 million variance I
568.12s: care about the difference between 15 and
570.52s: 16% because I care about $2.2 million
574.08s: over that time frame the tricky part is
576.20s: if you look at this for the first 16
578.32s: years it's not much of a difference you
580.28s: can't really see what's going on here
582.28s: but that's the nature of compounding
584.00s: returns they take time to display
586.76s: themselves but then notice once you get
588.32s: over here towards year 30 look at the
590.36s: gap between these as it's opening up
592.72s: this just becomes parabolic from there I
595.00s: care about that 1% that 1% difference is
598.92s: a lot of money I care about that
601.68s: so should you the last thing here is
603.36s: skeptical optimism in the finance world
606.28s: you notice that there's no shortage of
608.20s: complete and utter but I still
610.84s: remain open to information just about
612.92s: all of it there is a heavy screening
615.36s: process that data goes through as I'm
617.80s: receiving it I think it's done me really
619.96s: well remaining very open to new data but
622.88s: being highly skeptical in how I analyze
626.04s: it see how quantifiable it is see how
628.76s: rigorous the origin of the thesis is
631.80s: those Details Matter a lot but you don't
633.56s: want to get too close-minded in my
635.16s: opinion because markets change and as
636.92s: soon as you get to the point where you
638.12s: don't want to change anything you're
639.48s: going to start falling behind all right
640.84s: let's talk about the approach I take a
642.24s: very top- down approach I start with the
644.04s: economy then I'll look at the market the
646.24s: indices sectors sub sectors I want to
648.92s: understand from a broad picture how
650.80s: things are moving why what are the
652.28s: primary themes so right now the primary
655.44s: themes are still high inflation it's
657.24s: getting fairly persistent the economy is
659.80s: still fairly strong but slowing in some
661.92s: instances and we're seeing things like
663.92s: AI still being very interesting although
665.96s: it's now just starting to WAN a little
667.64s: bit in this next earning cycle so
669.72s: there's a lot of interesting things that
671.28s: you can kind of devise just from that so
674.08s: based on these two inputs I'm going to
675.96s: come up with the disposition how do I
677.40s: feel about things what do I think makes
679.24s: sense for the portfolio that I want to
681.08s: construct based on this information then
683.28s: I'm going to build a portfolio around it
684.92s: and make sure that each individual
686.84s: position in the portfolio supports this
689.68s: disposition collectively so even though
692.28s: for example let's say that I'm bullish
694.64s: in Tech does that mean that everything I
697.36s: have in the portfolio is bullish Tech no
699.24s: because there's other things at play and
701.36s: I want to make sure I integrate that
702.76s: into what I'm doing this is really
704.60s: important for options Traders number two
706.68s: this idea that profit mechanisms come
708.96s: first then we fit a strategy all this
711.88s: means is I'm not going to look at the
713.84s: market and say hey where can I put on a
715.48s: vertical spread where can I put on a
717.52s: ratio diagonal I don't really care so
720.20s: much about what structure or strategy
722.48s: I'm using what I care about is what
724.48s: opportunity am I trying to capture and
726.64s: then what strategy fits it the best so
729.96s: the cliffnotes version of this is if I
731.72s: want to trade something bullish The
733.48s: Profit mechanism is bullish something
735.36s: going up in value that's what matters
738.28s: then if I choose to buy a call sell a
740.12s: put that's just a expression of what
742.44s: fits the portfolio best they both make
744.44s: money in the same scenario how much they
746.16s: make how much risk they have that's the
747.76s: difference you have to focus on the
749.24s: profit mechanism first the structure and
751.92s: the strategy just give us ideas on how
754.08s: to capture it so how to derivatives
756.20s: specifically options fit into my life
758.24s: well I use both long and short premium
760.48s: strategies not wedded to either or I
762.96s: actually think they both have a use case
764.80s: so I don't limit myself to being an
767.20s: Theta ganger or somebody that's just
768.96s: trying to buy YOLO options I do
770.88s: everything I generally use undefined
773.24s: risk structures so I'm not spreading
775.12s: things off with verticals more often
777.40s: than not and I simply manage the risk of
779.68s: the positions so rather than putting on
781.36s: a vertical spread and then just letting
782.68s: it go I might sell a put or buy a call
785.52s: and then if it's not doing what I want
787.04s: I'll manage the trade in the middle as
788.64s: compared to just letting it go what I'm
790.16s: trying to do here is reduce the friction
792.36s: of what I'm putting on when I'm trading
794.72s: directionally with options I'm looking
796.28s: for leverage the other reason why I like
798.32s: options is because it gives me exposure
800.52s: to specific things like volatility that
802.52s: you can't really isolate as well with an
805.16s: equity itself I use all different time
807.12s: frames everything from zero days out to
809.88s: 180 is kind of the majority of what I do
812.52s: I have stuff that goes out past a year
814.44s: it's a little bit of everything and it
816.12s: depends a lot on what the market is
817.60s: doing again I'm agnostic to time frame
819.80s: what I care most about is the profit
821.44s: mechanism first and foremost and then
823.20s: the time frames I'm using are just
824.80s: designed to help me capture the profit
826.80s: mechanism so I don't go into this
828.56s: thinking oh I only want to trade you
830.28s: know 90day options I I don't really care
832.92s: I don't really care if it's 90-day
834.40s: options what I care about is how do I
835.92s: best capture this profit mechanism next
837.76s: thing is for directional trades I have a
840.12s: bullish tendency in me and it's because
842.96s: markets quantitatively display bullish
845.36s: drift so I don't look to stand in front
847.48s: of that um unless there's a really good
849.16s: reason so I typically am looking for
851.56s: Trend momentum drift style directional
854.64s: plays I like breakouts breakdowns like I
857.00s: showed you in that rut position and then
858.80s: these are the strategies that I use for
860.88s: bullish and bearish directional trades I
862.88s: have videos about all of these I have an
864.40s: entire playlist I'll link in the notes
865.92s: below that goes through all of them as
867.40s: you could tell the stable ain't that
869.84s: deep I focus on simple strategies that I
873.80s: can execute really well it's the same
875.80s: thing we use in the Marine Corps
877.12s: Brilliance at the basics that's really
880.20s: what I Look to convey with what I'm
882.16s: doing in the markets I'm not looking for
883.88s: the 62 leg Dragon Leaping Frog spread I
887.12s: want the simplest expression of
888.52s: structures that allow me to capture the
890.16s: profit mechanism not as sexy as the
892.36s: dragon fire breathing Leaping Frog
894.64s: spread but gets the job done looking at
896.84s: volatility this is a really important
898.64s: aspect for options Traders and the
900.44s: reason being is because it provides a
902.12s: completely different style of return
904.00s: than equities products themselves
905.80s: typically so with volatility I'm looking
908.00s: to trade things like variance risk
909.72s: Premia which I have a video on that I'll
911.48s: link to it below mean reversion for
913.64s: volatility extremes either upside or
915.48s: downside because volatility is mean
917.44s: reverting and then relative value and
919.80s: skew between different options chains
922.64s: between different strikes you can find
924.60s: things that have a little excessive or
927.04s: not enough V compared to what it
929.24s: historically might and these are the
930.80s: strategies that I use to capture most of
933.28s: those I would add single options both
935.84s: long calls and puts short calls short
939.20s: puts to these really for the more
940.76s: relative value or calendars stuff like
943.12s: that but this is the hard and soul of
945.44s: what I do here and now for analysis I
947.72s: have videos that go through how I apply
949.84s: analysis to markets in general but as I
951.60s: already told you it's combined I'm going
953.08s: to use technical fundamental analysis
955.16s: I'm going to use everything I can find
956.52s: and successfully quantify the main
959.04s: things I'm looking for are price and
960.96s: volume that leads everything so all of
963.64s: the different indicators that I have on
966.52s: the chart are designed to help me
968.72s: visualize price and volume because
971.08s: that's what matters so these are just
973.24s: moving averages standard deviation
975.08s: channels volume profile on stuff that
978.08s: has an underlying that trade so if you
979.84s: grab Apple you'll see the volume profile
982.00s: over here volume down here average
984.56s: volume over certain durations those
986.92s: kinds of things the idea is to to do my
989.28s: best to analyze what the market is doing
991.08s: and figure out how to interface with it
993.12s: not to dictate onto the market what I
995.32s: think it should do because what I think
997.00s: it should do literally doesn't matter at
998.84s: all my job is to work with the market so
1001.68s: this is how I think about trading
1002.68s: options if you have any questions let me
1003.88s: know be an outlier see you guys later
