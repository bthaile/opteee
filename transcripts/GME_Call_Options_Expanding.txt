0.48s: you know I didn't have this one on my
1.68s: bingo card I really thought today
4.00s: GameStop was going to crack above 25 it
6.88s: was oh so very close and we ended up
10.12s: closing today at
15.56s: 2497 close very close but not quite
18.68s: spend most of the day above that handle
21.08s: can't help but find that slightly
22.60s: interesting now another interesting
25.04s: component to this though is the fact
27.24s: that we were bumping up against the
30.84s: point of control for the volume profile
34.28s: which is what this is here it just tells
36.72s: me where we were transacting the most
39.40s: with in a specific time frame in this
41.32s: case a 3-month daily there's a lot of
43.92s: people that are holding shares right now
46.72s: at
47.48s: 2644 like somewhere around there and if
49.72s: we go out to 6 months it's kind of right
52.12s: around that same exact period 2648 is
56.60s: and then if we go out to a year you'll
58.72s: notice it's still very close to that
62.04s: 2662 the reason why that matters so much
65.04s: is because a lot of times when you look
66.60s: at different time frames you'll actually
68.12s: see the point of control move around as
70.12s: people are buying at all different kinds
71.76s: of time frames this doesn't surprise me
75.04s: to see a lot of selling happening as we
77.84s: get up to this point of control because
79.36s: for a lot of people this is where
81.36s: they've been holding for a pretty
84.28s: prolong period of time and some people
87.40s: are trying to get out at a profit now
90.40s: whether or not the ape Community is
92.52s: going to handle that and people not
95.08s: hling well that's up to y'all to take a
97.48s: look at I'm just telling you what I see
99.20s: here which is people that are unwinding
101.92s: as they are getting back towards break
103.52s: even reminds me of that gif or the meme
107.32s: of the dude that says with the new on
109.56s: his neck and he goes first time I feel
111.80s: like most of the Apes have been here so
113.36s: long that being down under the point of
117.36s: control by a dollar is that probably
119.44s: doesn't even register at this point but
122.08s: for some people especially if they have
124.08s: reasonable size positions that they've
125.68s: been holding for a year say like say
128.72s: even back further than this and then
131.36s: they're having an opportunity to unwind
134.52s: that starts to look kind of attractive
136.08s: depending on what your disposition is as
139.16s: a Trader and what you're trying to
140.32s: accomplish which everybody needs to do
142.64s: what's right for them trading is an
145.00s: individual Endeavor I would call it an
147.20s: individual sport but it's so physically
150.00s: inactive it doesn't feel comfortable
151.44s: saying that so let's take a look at the
155.32s: options chains what are we seeing well
157.40s: the very first thing is compared to
159.56s: yesterday volatility has now expanded
163.00s: actually quite a lot and I don't think
166.24s: that that's
167.84s: coincidental I think that we're starting
170.20s: to see a heavy amount of options
173.20s: activity so when I look at this today
176.52s: there was over
178.48s: 300,000 calls s that transacted today in
182.04s: only 86,000 puts very heavy call
185.48s: activity this has been hovering in like
187.28s: the mid TW and it's even been down below
189.56s: two a couple times over the last week or
191.96s: so so this is a a reasonable surge in
195.60s: call volume and it's very much centered
199.36s: around the 19 July and the 12 July
202.36s: expiration so if I just look at those
204.56s: two
207.64s: 25,500 of that volume are in these front
210.72s: two
211.96s: expirations as you can see here now we
214.84s: have a little bit of a loan Ranger all
216.88s: the way up here and this is showing us
219.20s: in the 19 July the 30s there was
223.04s: 41,700 contract trades
226.12s: today and if we just take a quick look
229.04s: at that specific contract to get a sense
231.36s: of how prevalent it was was there any
234.88s: really big sizing and apparently all my
237.96s: alerts are going off right now
240.44s: and there really weren't very many big
242.76s: trades realistically so as I look at
244.88s: this the biggest one I saw was the 30s
248.56s: now what I did do is grab unusual whales
252.72s: which I have a link in the description
255.44s: for anybody that wants to sign up with a
257.08s: small discount I do get a kickback for
258.92s: that but the main thing is if you like
262.08s: the tool otherwise we can look at it
263.88s: together and let's take a quick look at
266.52s: those
267.76s: 30s uh we need to go to to the strike
271.00s: and we want to look only at the
273.12s: 30s for 19
276.48s: July and let's see like there's some
280.04s: decent size trades but nothing too
282.20s: significant right 43,000 37,000 this
284.76s: isn't like the transactions we've been
287.12s: seeing recently with a couple 200,000
289.48s: plus dollar trades which funny enough
291.80s: there was somebody in my comments that
293.92s: was saying like they were expecting like
296.28s: a $20 million trade and I was sitting
299.40s: there thinking like how crazy is this
302.08s: whole story that that's become the
304.44s: expectation that it's boring until
306.72s: there's a 20 million plus dollar
309.48s: position and not only that but there's a
312.40s: single dude that does that and it's
316.92s: reality we've already seen it
319.16s: before the fact that that is part of the
321.76s: conversation here is so crazy to me and
326.00s: it is part of the conversation which is
328.12s: quite hilarious
330.04s: so that's a interesting amount of
332.68s: activity but yeah from here you can see
334.76s: it's a lot of activity for sure but the
337.56s: majority of it smaller trades but tons
340.56s: of them right tons and tons of five lots
343.36s: and lower so there's a little bit of
346.92s: building out happening there and then we
350.48s: also see quite a bit of activity in the
352.76s: 12 July's resuming so specifically at
355.44s: the 30s which we have seen going off for
357.40s: a while at the 26 which is Rel
359.60s: relatively new and then I would assume
360.80s: these are the 25s which they are so
362.96s: let's take a look now at the 12s which
364.60s: are literally 2 days away and we see
369.44s: overwhelming volume for the
373.20s: 26 that's
374.96s: interesting 9,600 oi and there's
379.96s: 2,636 volume today that's a ton of
382.64s: opening positions no matter what we see
385.56s: a bunch of opening positions here at the
387.16s: 26 and a halfes at the 27s we see
390.24s: opening positions all the way out here
391.64s: at the 30s so people very clearly are
394.80s: still building positions even though
396.84s: there are 2 days left to go now we are
400.60s: coming up on a perspective start to
403.56s: another one of these Cycles we need to
405.72s: explore a little bit more I actually
407.68s: have another live stream scheduled with
410.64s: Newton this coming Saturday at 1,700
413.84s: Pacific time the same exact thing we did
415.32s: last week but this time I have like 2
416.60s: hours so plenty of time to dig way
419.08s: further into details so we'll be able to
420.64s: talk a little bit about what we see
422.08s: happen this week but there does look to
424.32s: be some positioning around that going on
426.92s: because there's two days left and
429.04s: there's 10,000 contracts at least that
432.40s: were open today here at the 26 anle
434.24s: which is really interesting same thing
435.40s: here at the 25 handle 17,500 contracts
438.60s: traded against 16,000 oi so that's a lot
440.72s: of opening positions the other thing is
442.80s: we had that homie that was in at the 10
445.36s: let's see if they're still here all the
447.12s: way out here at the 10 ah aha they
452.60s: bounced so wait was it the 12 July or
455.60s: was it the 19 July let me
458.36s: see no this looks right it looks like
460.92s: the 19 July because it looks like
462.16s: they're still there I I messed up so
465.08s: yeah because there was that dude that I
466.40s: saw come through buying the 10 which was
468.32s: a little different and it was a pretty
469.72s: meaningful Siz position and it looks
472.68s: like they're still there cuz I remember
473.72s: there was around 300 oi you guys can
475.40s: fact check me to make sure I'm not
476.80s: completely off base here but I think
478.36s: that that's right
481.24s: so what's the deal here well a couple
484.56s: things one of the things I notice is
487.36s: volatility is coming up here this was
489.28s: really low this was like low ones just
491.56s: yesterday and the day before and now
493.72s: it's already starting to Peak back up so
495.32s: you could tell that the mar the options
496.92s: Market knows when there's expiration
499.40s: coming gets weird like that's the
502.04s: trend the overwhelming Trend that I've
504.52s: started to pick up on since I've started
506.20s: following this more closely and
507.60s: rightfully so I totally get why it does
509.76s: that when I look at most of the call
511.80s: transactions today 33% of them were at
514.36s: the offer above meaning they were buys
517.16s: and on the put side it looks like they
519.48s: were at the bidder below slight Edge by
521.84s: three points and that means that those
523.72s: are probably
525.12s: sells so overall bullish leaning in the
529.48s: overall volume that we saw transacting
532.12s: today now let's take a look at the oi
534.76s: because this expanded a lot now we have
537.72s: 835,000 call HS to 483 puts so this is
542.20s: built out quite nicely the other thing
544.48s: that you guys might notice Happening
546.88s: Here I know I do is there's way more of
549.84s: these 16 augs popping up here here here
554.24s: here we're seeing more red squares
557.24s: popping up in here that's important
560.12s: because this also means that there are
562.08s: people playing multiple Cycles right
564.48s: like for me I was in the 16 augs and I
567.28s: actually just recently moved out to the
568.64s: 20 September
570.00s: but that's the way that I trade these
571.84s: things it's very different than most
573.68s: people that I come across at least in
575.56s: this space that are really really
576.92s: centered on these super short-term
579.00s: expirations it's just not how I do it
581.92s: so I don't I don't find it anything
586.88s: other than conviction leading people out
590.60s: to establishing this far out at this
592.60s: point because it's still kind of early
594.40s: we didn't see this kind of building in
596.88s: this 16 a which in this case are 3 days
599.88s: out we didn't see this kind of building
601.56s: in the prior expiration Cycles at least
603.48s: for the last few weeks people have been
605.12s: playing the fronts very very heavily so
607.76s: another interesting data point here so
610.40s: that's mostly what I'm seeing here we
612.36s: have an expansion of volatility in the
614.16s: short term without a doubt I see 139 134
617.52s: 132 and then it starts to drop off a
620.00s: cliff from there so my expectation would
622.96s: be as like something like 16 all gets
625.76s: closer I would fully expect this
628.12s: volatility to start expanding that's
630.56s: kind of the overall trend that I've been
632.00s: seeing and it's also something I've
633.36s: actually started trading because it has
635.92s: been fairly consistent thus far with
638.08s: meaningful moves I should add so as
641.92s: always any questions anything I should
643.60s: take a look at let me know be an outlier
646.16s: see you guys later
