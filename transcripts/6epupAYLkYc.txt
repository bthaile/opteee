0.00s: What's up outliers, no live stream today, just a quick market update.
4.16s: I have two things on the agenda.
5.96s: I'm going to talk quickly about Tesla and a recent trade that I discussed in TSL.
10.76s: And then we have a lot to get into with GameStop.
14.84s: So we're going to cover all of that pretty quickly.
18.20s: The quick reason for no stream in the slightly intermittent cadence is because this dude
24.32s: here, the guy that really got me into investing trading and really just sent me down a
29.88s: completely different path of life is in the hospital.
33.04s: Long story, but it is taking a bit of my time and I'm actually heading to New York to
38.52s: go see him.
39.84s: So just working around that stuff all that aside, let's take a look at the markets broadly
47.20s: quickly.
48.80s: And a couple things really still stick out to me that are worth mentioning.
52.56s: One of them is volatility still remains suppressed even on the move that we saw today.
58.32s: And we can see across the sectors, we're starting to see some clear trends emerge.
63.48s: And that is, if you'll notice, most of the standard deviation lines on these three-month
68.64s: charts are actually slightly positive sloping for most of them.
73.32s: Now you will see things like tech still lagging against comm services.
78.12s: That's an important relationship to pay attention to.
80.76s: You can also see that staples is still hovering sideways while discretionary is in the resumption
89.04s: of this broader rally.
90.92s: So interesting market interplay here.
93.52s: I don't want to get bogged down on this because we have a lot to get into.
96.88s: So let's pivot now quickly to Tesla.
100.64s: And Tesla has been in a really interesting phase.
106.12s: I had talked about this on a couple live streams, not that long ago, about how from a
111.96s: podod's perspective, Tesla down here after it posted this bottom looked interesting to
118.76s: me to an upside style play.
121.48s: So I ended up choosing to run it with TSLL.
125.44s: I'll show you the trades in a second.
127.48s: But if we take a look at the primary news impacting Tesla right now, a lot of it has
133.72s: to do with the tariffs that were recently launched.
136.80s: But the interesting thing for Tesla is most of the Tesla's are built in Texas.
141.76s: So the impact of the automotive tariffs really are unlikely to nail Tesla as hard as it
149.24s: will.
150.24s: Other companies like Ford and GM, which again, we knew that this was coming down the
154.40s: pike.
155.40s: So this broader rally that you see going on here still seems really tenuous to me.
160.84s: We captured the 200 day MA and then rolled right back over.
164.20s: So normally when I'm using any sort of MA, I'm not in this case, but typically I'll use
168.32s: a percent band around it because this kind of behavior is relatively normal.
172.60s: But I think Tesla is getting wrapped up in a lot of near term bad sentiment and press.
179.00s: There are a lot of people that are very upset with Elon.
181.44s: What he's doing with Doge, you can see this obviously represented in people with these
185.96s: crazy Tesla stickers.
187.40s: Like before I knew Elon was not and literally vandalizing other people's Tesla, which is
193.72s: absolutely absurd to do that to somebody else.
197.20s: And also vandalizing Tesla buildings.
199.68s: It's I think all of that is captured in here.
202.84s: Now Tesla historically is super volatile and we can see that, right?
208.12s: Like just the way that it moves.
209.52s: This is not highly anomalous to see it moving how it is.
213.56s: It's always been very volatile.
216.36s: One big note though is this really persistent downside pressure also coalesced with the
221.88s: rest of the broader market.
223.80s: And sooner or later people do start to step in and say, do I think Tesla or whatever company
228.56s: we're looking at is really at a point where it should be price where it is relative to
233.80s: where it was.
235.16s: And it still has a very high multiple.
238.08s: There is no way around that when we look at where Tesla sits.
242.24s: So I think in the near term, shorter term ideas is mostly playing the volatility longer
248.00s: term ideas is probably playing the longer term appreciation of the company.
252.80s: Now the shorter term ideas I discussed for me was via TSL.
257.52s: And this is for a few different reasons.
259.00s: It's just the right product for what I was doing.
261.64s: And what I ultimately chose was once I saw this double bottom here, it kind of rotated
268.52s: up and around approach bottom again, but then it rallied up a little bit.
272.56s: This is where I started slowly building a position very, very early.
277.16s: And then I had terminated meaning built the final position on the 21st.
281.64s: And then I ultimately unwound the position.
285.04s: I took some of it down on the 24th of really small amounts.
288.60s: And then I put the remaining of it down as it fell through the close from the prior day
294.52s: in here on the 25th.
295.96s: So I'll show you those trades really quick so that just so you can get a sense of what
300.24s: they were.
301.24s: And I actually want to show you how they behave differently.
303.68s: So I had two different explorations.
305.68s: I had the 17 April 25 in the 16 Jan 26.
310.00s: So if you take a look at the options chain, it's 22 days expiration and 51.
315.04s: So why would I do that?
317.16s: Why am I in these, I'm sorry, 16 Jan 26, sorry, not the May this one here.
324.12s: So this was 296 days.
325.44s: So why would I do that?
326.92s: Well, it's the same thing you've heard me talk about before where if I'm trying to play
331.36s: something for gamma, I will use near term options that are typically further out of the
335.68s: money I refer to these as kicker options.
338.60s: They're much more likely to lose money.
340.84s: But if I do get an accommodating move, they can print pretty heavily relative to their
344.84s: cost, which you'll see.
346.84s: Then this is the base position, the position that I had out in 16 Jan 26.
351.48s: This is to give the idea of much more time to work if it needed it.
355.48s: And in this case, it didn't.
356.96s: That doesn't mean that I think the idea is done.
359.04s: I actually don't.
360.56s: But it is there's no reason for me to roll it right at back through this rollover section
367.04s: versus just reentering if conditions look favorable again.
371.60s: So let's take a look at the difference between these two trades.
375.24s: I had 100 of the 17 April 25 15 calls.
379.56s: And again, I kind of phased over to these in several days.
382.64s: The average cost for the position was around 12 cents.
386.64s: So these were very cheap options, very likely to expire worthless.
391.00s: And you can see the cost to get into the position is trivial, right?
396.68s: So the entire premise behind this is pretty straightforward.
402.08s: This is a $1,200 position as it relates to the portfolio.
405.72s: This is a fraction.
407.40s: It's literally less than a percent way less than a percent.
410.36s: And it's either going to work or it's not going to work.
413.12s: So the way that the risk is defined on that leg is literally by the size of the trade.
420.04s: So those go on for $1,200 and you can see when Tesla, when I first started phasing out,
426.08s: you can see that it was here and here.
428.36s: The overall average price was just right around 11.
433.60s: So that's what I'm using for the analysis here is using 1110.
437.04s: So you can see these were bought for $1,200 and they ended up returning $3,200.
440.96s: So a pretty significant return relative to the cost that went in.
445.68s: Now again, it's not a big sum of money, but this is just playing the pot odds on a speculative trade.
452.84s: Now take a look at this other position where average price was about $1,48.
457.64s: This was a 25 lot in total and take a look at the difference here.
462.40s: So this is obviously a bit more of an expensive trade to put on relative.
468.04s: It was like $3,700 and this ended up returning about $4,500.
475.44s: So a larger gross total return, but a lower return on invested capital.
483.12s: Still overall really solid between the two of these.
487.36s: And again, the broad idea here was playing this short term pop.
493.60s: And if it continued, I would have still been in them,
496.28s: but we'll see if we phase back in, but it's a little early to tell.
499.96s: Okay, now over to GameStop.
503.72s: What's going on here?
505.16s: Well, first of all, we had earnings and earnings came out after the close.
512.44s: We can see here, there was estimated at nine pennies and it came in at 30 cents.
519.48s: That is a massive EPS surprise, technically called a surprise.
526.12s: And it's a massive EPS beat.
528.92s: So that coupled with this move typically opens us up to a fantastic thing
535.20s: called post earnings announcement drift.
537.44s: If we take a look through how we actually performed,
541.44s: we can see that net sales came down a little bit compared to Q4 year over year.
550.04s: That is not a great look.
552.96s: We don't actually care for that.
555.64s: We want to see sales expanding, but right now the company is absolutely going through pivot,
560.68s: which leads into part of the Bitcoin news that came out from the earnings.
564.72s: And then also today, which we'll talk about, you can see that cash that they're sitting on
569.72s: is 4.775 billion at the close of the quarter.
574.16s: And you can see that they divested Italy and winding down operations in Germany.
580.80s: So looking at the total year of 2024, sales really were very soft.
588.76s: 24 compared to 23.
591.32s: Again, this is a broader trend that we have to pay attention to
594.92s: because the company is in a great spot to pivot and innovate,
600.28s: but it does have to do something.
601.68s: And it's starting to do something which again, we'll talk about,
604.60s: but contracting sales at this scale is not good.
610.08s: Now, a lot of people are really honed in on this net income of 131 mill,
617.40s: again, 6.7 mill.
619.20s: The net income here is good, but again,
622.56s: when too much of it comes from holding cash and earning interest,
627.32s: that is not sustainable, especially if inflationary pressures come back,
632.80s: this is good for now.
635.12s: It's good scenario, but the net income is more of a byproduct
640.36s: of what it's holding from really advantageous offerings.
643.52s: Sales needs to go up.
645.84s: Now, that leads us into the following announcement from yesterday
651.12s: that says that the board approved an update to investment policy
655.60s: to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.
660.56s: Very interesting choice, something that we've seen
664.08s: clues about for quite a while now, the picture with Sailor,
667.92s: some of the conversations that Cohen has had with Bitcoin magazine,
672.28s: and I forgot the name of the actual company,
674.36s: but he was replying in a thread saying that he heard from them,
677.72s: which it was another cryptocurrency organization.
681.12s: And so this move, I don't think shocks anybody.
685.32s: Now, the way that the move is happening is actually very interesting.
689.52s: And here's what's going on.
691.60s: They're using a very smart approach here.
697.12s: What they're doing is effectively using convertible senior notes.
703.16s: This is a debt instrument.
706.40s: So they're looking to raise 1.3 up to 1.5 billion dollars.
712.04s: The convertible notes, they mature on 1 April in 2030,
717.04s: unless they are chosen to be converted earlier.
720.16s: This is the really interesting part of the notes that we see here.
725.84s: The first one is that they do not yield any regular interest.
732.04s: And the principle does not change.
733.80s: So the first question we ask ourselves is,
736.92s: why would somebody buy these if there's obviously no yield on them?
742.40s: Well, you buy because you think it's going to go up.
745.36s: You buy because you can get it cheaper now
747.68s: and you expect to be able to convert these at some point in the future
751.72s: and make money on the conversion.
753.08s: That's the idea here.
754.64s: So this is actually starting to tie in very interesting parties
758.48s: from an institutional level, which I find interesting.
763.72s: Next thing I see here is a broad misunderstanding
769.12s: of the settlement of these notes.
774.36s: There are effectively four paths GameStop can go.
778.12s: The first one is they can settle them with cash.
781.40s: The second is they can issue new shares.
785.12s: So what this does is at the time of offering of the notes,
788.48s: there's no dilution.
790.12s: But there can be dilution.
792.52s: If in the future GameStop chooses to issue new shares
797.04s: to cover the conversion of these when they do begin converting,
801.52s: they can use a mix of these different approaches
804.04s: or they can leverage treasury shares
806.24s: if they want to just sell their own shares
809.00s: versus bringing new shares onto the market,
810.88s: which I don't think they have any.
813.24s: You would know better than me.
814.40s: So I definitely would lean on you all to let me know in the comments
818.20s: if they do have treasury shares.
820.12s: But I don't think that they do based on looking
823.76s: at their cash assets and equivalents.
826.32s: So then this opens the follow on question of,
829.20s: well, why Bitcoin?
830.56s: How does adding Bitcoin help GameStop here?
834.88s: Well, it's a really interesting thing
837.24s: because right now GameStop is doing well holding cash.
841.48s: However, if you can raise money
844.52s: using other people's money without diluting the stock up
848.12s: front with the expectation of increasing the value of the stock
852.96s: so that those people can get paid back,
855.48s: then you can add to the balance sheet
857.84s: without drawing down your cash.
860.28s: It is a massive branding opportunity for GameStop
864.92s: to show that it's doing things different,
866.80s: that it's adopting cryptocurrency, potentially
869.88s: using it for even different that we're not even thinking
874.20s: about now, business operations or opportunities in the future.
878.04s: So I think that there's a big part of this
879.92s: that literally comes from a branding perspective
882.64s: because the institutional story for people
885.84s: that are going to be interested in buying these convertible senior notes
889.04s: is important.
891.20s: Now, the other thing is if you compare cash against Bitcoin,
895.52s: Bitcoin is super volatile.
897.84s: So you can also tell that's why they're not putting a ton of money in Bitcoin.
902.48s: The other thing to note about Bitcoin
904.32s: is that it does offer appreciation opportunity.
908.12s: So if this trend continues with other institutions
912.00s: and other companies starting to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet,
915.04s: it actually starts to push the price of Bitcoin up
918.04s: as it becomes largely sponsored.
920.24s: So this could be GameStop actually speculating a little bit
924.48s: with an investment.
925.48s: Now, again, when it comes to the broader business,
929.36s: I don't really care about this one way or the other.
932.04s: I don't think it's a bad move.
933.08s: I think it's completely fine.
934.56s: But for the business side of things, we need profitability.
938.04s: We need sales.
938.76s: We need revenue.
940.00s: This, I think, is starting to hint at a pivot
944.40s: that the company might be taking in the future,
946.24s: which we will have to see how that pans out.
949.96s: So I am really, really excited to see this happening.
954.20s: Now GameStop is trading lower after the close today.
958.84s: We can see right now it's at 2675 after hours.
962.20s: It was at 28, so really, really great run.
965.16s: But it'll be returning back down pretty considerably
968.92s: down to this handle somewhere in here.
972.24s: And this doesn't surprise me just because Bitcoin,
974.88s: I'm sorry, GameStop, now holding Bitcoin,
977.36s: just moves a lot.
978.20s: So there's no big shock here.
980.80s: Now, I do have a couple of position updates
982.84s: and stuff like that, but we can go into those
985.16s: that a future point of people are interested.
986.88s: If so, great.
987.60s: Happy to, if not, no problem.
989.60s: But before we do that, let's take a quick look
993.12s: at the options chain and see if anything sticks out to us here.
997.28s: And you can see that the options chain is actually
999.28s: very, very quiet on a relative level.
1001.44s: There's only 690,000 calls against 209,000 puts.
1005.52s: So for something like GameStop, this is actually very quiet.
1009.16s: Now, another thing that is different
1011.48s: is that the front expiration concentration is still there.
1015.40s: But you can see that there's actually
1016.72s: a lot more dispersion into some of the further term,
1021.48s: less near term expiration.
1023.60s: So this is more positional style trading.
1026.12s: There were a lot of calls traded today on the ask side,
1030.56s: but still, again, nothing massive as far as I'm concerned.
1035.84s: I took a look through on our friends
1039.36s: over at unusual whales, just to see if anything was jumping out
1044.12s: at me and not really.
1047.68s: So if we take a look over the last 14 days,
1050.36s: we can see that the call premiums absolutely jacked today
1055.20s: on a relative basis.
1056.84s: So really, really high call premiums on a relative basis.
1060.64s: But this is on a relative basis
1062.72s: because things have been absolutely silent.
1066.00s: So a lot of this, I think, is from following
1068.88s: the earnings announcement.
1069.92s: And then we will see how this trends tomorrow.
1072.72s: But I think that this is a lot of people probably
1074.64s: playing the next quarter for GameStop
1076.72s: based on its prior earnings release.
1078.72s: But again, like the overall size here isn't too crazy.
1082.12s: 10 million total premiums.
1085.12s: That's again, for the context of GameStop,
1089.60s: it's not, it's not huge.
1092.60s: It's not insignificant, not worth noting.
1096.28s: But if we take a look at the largest trade today,
1098.72s: it was 1.1 million.
1100.28s: And you can see that the rest are like sub 500,000.
1103.04s: So this isn't like huge positioning yet.
1106.20s: But it looks really positive for GameStop.
1109.08s: I love to see the pivot that it's making
1111.84s: with cryptocurrency, adding a little bit of Bitcoin.
1115.32s: And I'm more interested to see what adding the Bitcoin
1119.12s: means to the company in terms of its future
1121.52s: and its future plans to generate sales and revenue.
1126.96s: As always, if you have any questions,
1129.24s: let me know anything I should look at.
1130.72s: Let me know via an outlier.
1132.24s: See you later.
