0.00s:  What's up outliers, no live stream today, just a quick market update.
4.20s:  I have two things on the agenda.
6.04s:  I'm going to talk quickly about Tesla and a recent trade that I discussed in TSL.
10.96s:  And then we have a lot to get into with GameStop.
14.84s:  So we're going to cover all of that pretty quickly.
18.20s:  The quick reason for no stream in the slightly intermittent cadence is because this dude
24.28s:  here, the guy that really got me into investing trading and really just sent me down a
29.96s:  completely different path in life is in the hospital.
33.08s:  Long story, but it is taking a bit of my time and I'm actually heading to New York to
38.60s:  go see him.
39.88s:  So just working around that stuff all that aside, let's take a look at the markets broadly
47.44s:  quickly.
48.84s:  And a couple things really still stick out to me that are worth mentioning.
52.60s:  One of them is volatility still remains suppressed even on the move that we saw today.
58.40s:  And we can see across the sectors, we're starting to see some clear trends emerge.
63.52s:  And that is, if you'll notice, most of the standard deviation lines on these three month
68.66s:  charts are actually slightly positive sloping for most of them.
73.36s:  Now you will see things like tech still lagging against comm services.
78.16s:  That's an important relationship to pay attention to.
80.80s:  You can also see that staples is still hovering sideways while discretionary is in the resumption
89.08s:  of this broader rally.
90.96s:  So interesting market interplay here.
93.56s:  I don't want to get bogged down on this because we have a lot to get into.
96.92s:  So let's pivot now quickly to Tesla and Tesla has been in a really interesting phase.
106.16s:  I had talked about this on a couple live streams, not that long ago, about how from a
112.02s:  pot odds perspective, Tesla down here after it posted this bottom looked interesting to
118.80s:  me to an upside style play.
121.52s:  So I ended up choosing to run it with TSLL.
125.24s:  I'll show you the trades in a second.
127.52s:  But if we take a look at the primary news impacting Tesla right now, a lot of it has
133.76s:  to do with the tariffs that were recently launched.
136.80s:  But the interesting thing for Tesla is most of the Tesla's are built in Texas.
141.80s:  So the impact of the automotive tariffs really are unlikely to nail Tesla as hard as it
149.28s:  will.
150.28s:  Other companies like Ford and GM, which again, we knew that this was coming down the
154.36s:  pike.
155.44s:  So this broader rally that you see going on here still seems really tenuous to me.
160.84s:  We captured the 200 day MA and then rolled right back over.
164.20s:  So normally when I'm using any sort of MA, I'm not in this case, but typically I'll use
168.32s:  a percent band around it because this kind of behavior is relatively normal.
172.60s:  But I think Tesla is getting wrapped up in a lot of near term bad sentiment and press.
179.00s:  There are a lot of people that are very upset with Elon.
181.44s:  What he's doing with Doge, you can see this obviously represented in people with these
185.96s:  crazy Tesla stickers.
187.40s:  Like before I knew Elon was not and literally vandalizing other people's Tesla, which is
193.72s:  absolutely absurd to do that to somebody else.
197.24s:  And also vandalizing Tesla buildings.
199.72s:  It's I think all of that is captured in here.
202.88s:  Now Tesla historically is super volatile and we can see that, right?
208.16s:  Like just the way that it moves.
209.56s:  This is not highly anomalous to see it moving how it is.
213.60s:  It's always been very volatile.
216.40s:  One big note though is this really persistent downside pressure also coalesced with the
221.92s:  rest of the broader market.
223.80s:  And sooner or later people do start to step in and say, do I think Tesla or whatever company
228.60s:  we're looking at is really at a point where it should be price where it is relative to
233.84s:  where it was.
235.20s:  And it still has a very high multiple.
238.12s:  There is no way around that when we look at where Tesla sets.
242.24s:  So I think in the near term, shorter term ideas is mostly playing the volatility longer
248.04s:  term ideas is probably playing the longer term appreciation of the company.
252.84s:  Now the shorter term ideas I discussed for me was via TSL.
257.56s:  And this is for a few different reasons.
259.00s:  It's just the right product for what I was doing.
261.68s:  And what I ultimately chose was once I saw this double bottom here, it kind of rotated
268.56s:  up and around approach bottom again, but then it rallied up a little bit.
272.64s:  This is where I started slowly building a position very, very early.
277.44s:  And then I had terminated meaning built the final position on the 21st.
281.88s:  And then I ultimately unwound the position.
285.16s:  I took some of it down on the 24th of really small amounts.
288.80s:  And then I put the remaining of it down as it fell through the close from the prior
294.12s:  day in here on the 25th.
296.20s:  So I'll show you those trades really quick so that just so you can get a sense of what
300.24s:  they were.
301.24s:  And I actually want to show you how they behave differently.
303.72s:  So I had two different explorations.
305.72s:  I had the 17 April 25 in the 16 Jan 26.
310.04s:  So if you take a look at the options chain, it's 22 days expiration and 51.
315.08s:  So why would I do that?
317.24s:  Why am I in these, I'm sorry, 16 Jan 26, sorry, not the May this one here.
324.16s:  So this was 296 days.
325.48s:  So why would I do that?
326.92s:  Well, it's the same thing you've heard me talk about before where if I'm trying to
331.16s:  play something for gamma, I will use near term options that are typically further out
335.60s:  of the money I refer to these as kicker options.
338.64s:  They're much more likely to lose money.
340.88s:  But if I do get an accommodating move, they can print pretty heavily relative to their
344.88s:  cost, which you'll see.
346.88s:  Then this is the base position, the position that I had out in 16 Jan 26.
351.52s:  This is to give the idea of much more time to work if it needed it.
355.52s:  And in this case, it didn't.
357.00s:  That doesn't mean that I think the idea is done.
359.08s:  I actually don't.
360.60s:  But it is there's no reason for me to roll it right at back through this rollover section
367.08s:  versus just reentering if conditions look favorable again.
371.64s:  So let's take a look at the difference between these two trades.
375.28s:  I had 100 of the 17 April 25 15 calls.
379.60s:  And again, I kind of phased over to these in several days.
382.68s:  The average cost for the position was around 12 cents.
386.68s:  So these were very cheap options, very likely to expire worthless.
391.04s:  And you can see the cost to get into the position is trivial, right?
396.72s:  So the entire premise behind this is pretty straightforward.
402.12s:  This is a $1,200 position as it relates to the portfolio.
405.76s:  This is a fraction.
407.44s:  It's literally less than a percent, way less than a percent.
410.40s:  And it's either going to work or it's not going to work.
413.16s:  So the way that the risk is defined on that leg is literally by the size of the trade.
420.08s:  So those go on for $1,200 and you can see when Tesla, when I first started phasing out,
426.12s:  you can see that it was here and here.
428.40s:  The overall average price was just right around 11.
433.64s:  So that's what I'm using for the analysis here is using 1110.
437.08s:  So you can see these were bought for $1,200 and they ended up returning $3,200.
441.00s:  So a pretty significant return relative to the cost that went in.
445.72s:  Now again, it's not a big sum of money, but this is just playing the pothods on a speculative trade.
452.92s:  Now take a look at this other position where average price was about $1,48.
457.68s:  This was a 25 lot in total and take a look at the difference here.
462.44s:  So this is obviously a bit more of an expensive trade to put on relative.
468.08s:  It was like $3,700 and this ended up returning about $4,500.
475.48s:  So a larger gross total return, but a lower return on invested capital.
483.16s:  Still overall really solid between the two of these.
487.40s:  And again, the broad idea here was playing this short term pop.
493.64s:  And if it continued, I would have still been in them,
496.32s:  but we'll see if we phase back in, but it's a little early to tell.
500.00s:  Okay, now over to GameStop.
503.76s:  What's going on here?
505.20s:  Well, first of all, we had earnings and earnings came out after the close.
512.48s:  We can see here, there was estimated at nine pennies and it came in at 30 cents.
519.52s:  That is a massive EPS surprise, technically called a surprise.
526.16s:  And it's a massive EPS beat.
528.96s:  So that coupled with this move typically opens us up to a fantastic thing
535.24s:  called post earnings announcement drift.
537.48s:  If we take a look through how we actually performed,
541.48s:  we can see that net sales came down a little bit compared to Q4 year over year.
550.04s:  That is not a great look.
552.96s:  We don't actually care for that.
555.68s:  We want to see sales expanding, but right now the company is absolutely going through a pivot,
560.72s:  which leads into part of the Bitcoin news that came out from the earnings.
564.76s:  And then also today, which we'll talk about, you can see that cash that they're sitting on
569.72s:  is 4.775 billion at the close of the quarter.
574.16s:  And you can see that they divested Italy and winding down operations in Germany.
580.80s:  So looking at the total year of 2024, sales really were very soft.
588.72s:  24 compared to 23.
591.28s:  Again, this is a broader trend that we have to pay attention to
594.96s:  because the company is in a great spot to pivot and innovate,
600.24s:  but it does have to do something.
601.68s:  And it's starting to do something which again, we'll talk about,
604.56s:  but contracting sales at this scale is not good.
610.08s:  Now, a lot of people are really honed in on this net income of 131 mill,
617.36s:  again, 6.7 mill.
619.20s:  The net income here is good, but again,
622.56s:  when too much of it comes from holding cash and earning interest,
627.28s:  that is not sustainable, especially if inflationary pressures come back,
632.80s:  this is good for now.
635.12s:  It's good scenario, but the net income is more of a byproduct of what it's holding from really
641.84s:  advantageous offerings. Sales needs to go up.
645.84s:  Now, that leads us into the following announcement from yesterday that says that the board
652.40s:  approved an update to investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.
660.56s:  Very interesting choice.
662.24s:  Something that we've seen clues about for quite a while now, the picture with Sailor,
667.84s:  some of the conversations that Cohen has had with Bitcoin magazine.
672.08s:  I forgot the name of the actual company, but he was replying in a thread saying,
676.56s:  you know, that he heard from them, which it was another cryptocurrency organization.
682.00s:  So this move, I don't think shocks anybody.
685.28s:  Now, the way that the move is happening is actually very interesting.
689.44s:  And here's what's going on.
691.52s:  They're using a very smart approach here.
697.12s:  What they're doing is effectively using convertible senior notes.
703.12s:  This is a debt instrument.
706.32s:  So they're looking to raise 1.3 up to 1.5 billion dollars.
712.00s:  The convertible notes, they mature on 1 April in 2030 unless they are chosen to be converted
719.20s:  earlier. This is the really interesting part of the notes that we see here.
725.76s:  The first one is that they do not yield any regular interest.
731.92s:  And the principle does not change.
733.68s:  So the first question we ask ourselves is, why would somebody buy these if there's obviously no
741.52s:  yield on them? Well, you buy because you think it's going to go up.
745.28s:  You buy because you can get it cheaper now and you expect to be able to convert these at some
750.40s:  point in the future and make money on the conversion. That's the idea here.
754.56s:  So this is actually starting to tie in very interesting parties from an institutional level,
760.56s:  which I find interesting. Next thing I see here is a broad misunderstanding of the settlement
770.72s:  of these notes. There are effectively four paths GameStop can go.
778.00s:  The first one is they can settle them with cash.
781.28s:  The second is they can issue new shares. So what this does is at the time of offering of the notes,
788.40s:  there's no dilution. But there can be dilution. If in the future GameStop chooses to issue new shares
796.96s:  to cover the conversion of these when they do begin converting, they can use a mix of these
803.12s:  different approaches or they can leverage treasury shares if they want to just sell their own shares
808.88s:  versus bringing new shares onto the market, which I don't think they have any. You would know
813.68s:  better than me. So I definitely would lean on you all to let me know in the comments if they do
818.64s:  have treasury shares. But I don't think that they do based on looking at their cash assets and
824.80s:  equivalents. So then this opens the follow on question of well, why Bitcoin? How does adding Bitcoin
832.40s:  help GameStop here? Well, it's a really interesting thing because right now GameStop is doing
839.60s:  well holding cash. However, if you can raise money using other people's money without diluting the
847.44s:  stock up front with the expectation of increasing the value of the stock so that those people can
854.00s:  get paid back, then you can add to the balance sheet without drawing down your cash. It is a massive
862.16s:  branding opportunity for GameStop to show that it's doing things different, that it's adopting
868.16s:  cryptocurrency, potentially using it for even different that we're not even thinking about now
874.72s:  business operations or opportunities in the future. So I think that there's a big part of this that
880.00s:  literally comes from a branding perspective because the institutional story for people that are
885.92s:  going to be interested in buying these convertibles senior notes is important. Now the other thing is
892.24s:  if you compare cash against Bitcoin, Bitcoin is super volatile. So you can also tell that's why they're
899.68s:  not putting a ton of money in Bitcoin. The other thing to note about Bitcoin is that it does offer
905.68s:  appreciation opportunity. So if this trend continues with other institutions and other companies
913.12s:  starting to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet, it actually starts to push the price of Bitcoin up
918.16s:  as it becomes largely sponsored. So this could be GameStop actually speculating a little bit
924.32s:  with an investment. Now again, when it comes to the broader business, I don't really care about
931.04s:  this one way or the other. I don't think it's a bad move. I think it's completely fine.
934.40s:  But for the business side of things, we need profitability. We need sales. We need revenue.
940.00s:  This I think is starting to hint at a pivot that the company might be taking in the future,
946.08s:  which we will have to see how that pans out. So I am really, really excited to see this happening.
954.08s:  Now GameStop is trading lower after the close today. We can see right now it's at 26,
960.72s:  75 after hours. It was at 28. So really, really great run. But it'll be returning back down pretty
968.00s:  considerably down to this handle somewhere in here. And this doesn't surprise me just because Bitcoin,
974.88s:  I'm sorry, GameStop, now holding Bitcoin, it moves a lot. So there's no big shock here.
980.72s:  Now I do have a couple of position updates and stuff like that. But we can go into those that
985.20s:  a future point of people are interested. If so, great. Happy to, if not, no problem. But before we do
990.56s:  that, let's take a quick look at the options chain and see if anything sticks out to us here.
997.12s:  And you can see that the options chain is actually very, very quiet on a relative level. There's
1001.52s:  only 690,000 calls against 209,000 puts. So for something like GameStop, this is actually very quiet.
1009.12s:  Now another thing that is different is that the front expiration concentration is still there.
1015.20s:  But you can see that there's actually a lot more dispersion into some of the near the further term,
1021.52s:  less near term expiration. So this is more positional style trading. There were a lot of calls
1027.36s:  traded today on the ask side, but still again, nothing massive as far as I'm concerned.
1035.68s:  I took a look through on our friends over at unusual whales, just to see if anything was jumping
1043.76s:  out at me. And not really. So if we take a look over the last 14 days, we can see that the call
1051.44s:  premiums absolutely jacked today on a relative basis. So really, really high call premiums on a
1059.76s:  relative basis. But this is on a relative basis because things have been absolutely silent.
1066.00s:  So a lot of this I think is from following the earnings announcement. And then we will see how
1071.12s:  this trends tomorrow. But I think that this is a lot of people probably playing the next quarter
1076.00s:  for GameStop based on its prior earnings release. But again, like the overall size here
1081.20s:  isn't too crazy. 10 million total premiums. That's again, for the context of GameStop,
1089.60s:  it's not it's not huge. It's not insignificant, not worth noting. But if we take a look at the
1097.76s:  largest trade today, it was 1.1 mil. And you can see that the rest are like sub 500,000. So this
1103.44s:  isn't like huge positioning yet. But it looks really positive for GameStop. I love to see the pivot
1110.56s:  that it's making with cryptocurrency, adding a little bit of Bitcoin. And I'm more interested to see
1117.76s:  what adding the Bitcoin means to the company in terms of its future and its future plans to
1124.00s:  generate sales and revenue. As always, if you have any questions, let me know anything I should look
1130.40s:  at. Let me know via an outlier. See you later.
