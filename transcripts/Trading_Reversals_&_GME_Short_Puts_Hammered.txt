0.12s: what's up here from Alaska saw a lot
2.72s: going on in the market want to take a
3.96s: look at it with you guys and no I am not
6.08s: an angel this is just some light
8.04s: bleeding in from behind me because we
9.88s: are on the mobile setup via the laptop
12.92s: so actually first thing I want to play
15.12s: is uh where's Waldo if you can see where
18.08s: we are in this photo let me know and
21.72s: I'll give you the answer but throw it in
23.40s: the comments if you can find us and if
26.28s: you couldn't we are right here you can
28.52s: tell by this big Shadow that's kind of
31.28s: casting out from where we're at but the
33.80s: reason why this water is so blue we've
36.40s: learned is because of stuff called Rock
38.40s: flower which is from glacial water which
40.72s: is pretty neat and then just a couple
42.84s: other photos really quick for you guys
45.00s: uh kind of like a preamble I'll
46.56s: obviously share a lot more when uh I
49.68s: have a chance to pull it all down from
51.00s: the Drone but let's get over to the
52.88s: markets CH I have a few things I want to
55.20s: talk about today first the indices RIT
57.52s: large then I want to talk about where
59.36s: I'm still seeing strength then I want to
61.96s: talk a little bit about crowd strike and
64.80s: using it as a conversation for reversals
67.28s: which was a question that I got from the
69.92s: outlier community and then I also at the
72.32s: end want to take a look at GameStop
73.88s: because there was some really
75.16s: interesting options activity that
78.56s: occurred in the last couple days
80.16s: specifically with some 125 puts so we'll
82.88s: take a look at those but first looking
85.44s: at the indices what's going on here well
87.60s: as far as I can tell it looks like the
89.36s: market is is really in a mixup but this
92.80s: is broadly what I'm expecting to see as
96.16s: a broad pullback so if we look across
98.76s: the indices we have the e- minis the
100.52s: NASDAQ the Russell these are the Futures
102.52s: but you there it's essentially the same
104.32s: thing as what you'll see in uh spy QQQ
107.60s: and I so first things first we're seeing
111.56s: a selloff across everything pretty clear
114.16s: no duh but the structure of the selloff
117.20s: is very different and what I mean by
119.12s: that is if you take a look at something
120.52s: like the Russell this has gone parabolic
123.28s: up trended sideways and is now returned
126.52s: essentially going parabolic down and
129.04s: it's almost back to where it started
131.40s: which is kind of insane and you can use
134.92s: small caps in this kind of setting is
136.80s: like a proxy for what's going on what
139.32s: the market is thinking and right now
142.12s: it's obviously thinking constrain
144.72s: specifically for smaller cap companies
147.92s: and that's because of a slew mixed
150.84s: economic data that we're getting in so
154.64s: we're seeing still probability of a cut
157.80s: in the next meeting and it's varying
160.76s: quite a lot because the market is
162.24s: starting to show signs of weakness and
165.16s: because of that you'll see small caps
168.40s: definitely taking the brunt of this this
170.20s: is this original rise that you see here
172.84s: is when things were looking good and the
175.04s: market was expecting a cut and then
177.92s: things started kind of chopping sideways
179.96s: for a little bit and then starting last
181.92s: week into this week there's been a
184.32s: pretty meaningful contraction in small
186.72s: caps because of this now Tech is a
189.20s: slightly different story in my opinion
191.12s: because you can see take a look at the
193.12s: slope of this pullback take a look at
196.48s: the slope of small caps pullback right
199.64s: so small caps essentially gave this all
201.80s: back up over the course of one two three
204.96s: days it's just pure parabolic in nature
208.96s: you'll see these kinds of moves when it
211.16s: has this kind of parabolic up move
213.36s: unless there's something that really
215.08s: maintains the momentum and that's
217.08s: because there's not a lot of support and
219.20s: resistance built into price when it
221.48s: moves like this this is an insane
223.80s: movement so that's part of the reason
226.00s: why you'll typically see something like
227.68s: this pattern in small caps is it did not
231.24s: build and consolidate on the way up so
234.04s: on the way down it kind of follows suit
235.80s: whereas something like Tech you can see
237.28s: it's definitely still drawing back no
239.88s: out but it's a completely different
242.20s: structure and the e- minis they're kind
244.72s: of somewhere in the middle they
246.40s: definitely showed a healthy dose of
248.40s: weakness starting on the second and then
250.80s: it's starting to level out a little bit
253.08s: more than what you're seeing in the
255.20s: NASDAQ so all in all pretty interesting
258.32s: price performance so far as far as I'm
261.16s: concerned now I want to take a look at a
264.60s: couple things a little more closely so
266.36s: let's grab a chart here and let's grab
268.36s: spy and I'm right now I can't see where
272.20s: I'm at in OBS because I am on my laptop
275.32s: so I only have the same screen you guys
276.92s: are but I'm guessing I'm covering up
278.52s: some stuff down here but you'll have to
280.88s: take my word for it let me slide this up
283.12s: maybe you can see that I don't know how
284.40s: much you guys will be able to see of
285.28s: this but essentially I'm trying to show
287.60s: you the net highs and lows here and we
290.44s: came to a point this is looking in the
292.00s: NASDAQ where even up to the 31st we
295.52s: still had pretty strong net highs lows
298.84s: but you'll notice that it was still
300.08s: downward sloping it wasn't at a point
302.56s: where it was fully consolidating and the
304.76s: breath indicator really turned pretty
306.52s: heavy and we saw this massive expansion
309.92s: in lows gross lows happen on the 5th
314.68s: where we peaked out at
318.72s: 331 as compared to highs of 110 so this
323.32s: is up a pretty big negative rotation
326.28s: over but it's already starting to kind
328.60s: of mellow back out and coming back
330.56s: towards the zero line so what I'm
332.52s: highlighting is that it's definitely a
334.68s: bit of a broad sell-off here that we saw
336.96s: happen on the fifth but it doesn't look
339.08s: like it's heavily sustained so far and
341.64s: we're definitely dipping into this value
343.76s: area pretty heavily as you can tell the
345.68s: point of control in spy specifically is
348.24s: still like 512 513 so because of these
352.88s: kind of small
354.84s: details the pullback that we see in my
357.48s: opinion is still generally in line with
362.08s: what I would expect to see for something
363.76s: that has had this kind of first
365.04s: six-month move it's just been a little
367.04s: bit aggressive which I think has taken
368.88s: some people by surprise but it's at a
372.28s: point now where I definitely think you
374.12s: have to be careful with laying out risk
377.12s: I definitely am I'm being very cautious
379.48s: with how much Capital I'm offering the
381.60s: market right now which funny enough I
383.60s: I've already made the joke a couple
384.80s: times where it seems like whenever I'm
386.20s: going up on a trip the market decides to
388.56s: sell off a few people the Discord have
390.32s: highlighted that too which is just kind
391.64s: of comical so my portfolio just
393.84s: naturally happens to be pretty light
395.44s: right but I'm still trading I was
397.56s: trading zeros today and those were
399.44s: actually really really successful this
400.88s: is one of my favorite periods of time to
403.00s: trade zeros or really any type of
407.52s: variance RIS premium style plays and
409.52s: it's it's for this exact reason right
411.80s: like we can see V is
414.44s: just so that offers a really big
417.60s: opportunity now you have to understand
420.12s: that the way that these charts work is
422.64s: you're you're making a forecast on what
424.28s: this will look like essentially tomorrow
426.80s: so what I'm highlighting is because
428.96s: realized is so high over implied doesn't
432.64s: inherently mean that where you're at
435.12s: right now is an inopportune time
437.32s: something like this where it's trending
439.08s: above definitely more inopportune but
442.76s: with this kind of really large movement
445.12s: a bit of positive momentum taking a look
447.20s: at the intraday charts in spy didn't
449.12s: look quite too terrible so it looked a
451.60s: little bit interesting to me so now I
453.52s: want to take a quick look what we have
456.36s: coming up on the week and you can see a
460.08s: few things so if I grab this week's
466.04s: data and we take a look kind of like
469.36s: from a a broad perspective we had PMI
472.60s: come in pretty light it was expected at
474.72s: 56 came in at 55 the composite PMI also
478.28s: came in light it was expected at 55 came
480.88s: at 543 so again we're just seeing some
485.12s: level of weakness and the market is
489.12s: overwhelmingly going to react violently
491.04s: to this and it's because of where we're
493.12s: at in the current cycle and You' better
496.24s: believe that any sort of future economic
500.48s: data that releases is going to be looked
502.80s: at with an absolute it's going to be
504.88s: looked at with a microscope because the
506.76s: market is now starting to get a little
508.52s: bit jittery with where we're at so on
512.08s: the 7th we have one that I'm interested
514.36s: in I don't think the Market's going to
515.64s: care that much about but Consumer Credit
517.24s: I really want to see that and then on
519.24s: the eighth jobless claims going to be a
521.04s: big deal there's no doubt have to keep
523.08s: an eye on jobless CLA claims if that
524.80s: starts moving too aggressively outline
526.64s: of expectations I think the market will
529.20s: kind of have a freak out about that so
531.80s: it's something else that I'm keeping in
533.48s: on all right now let's take a look at
536.28s: crowd strike and specifically I want to
538.56s: look at this idea of trading reversals
542.16s: because one of the questions was it
544.08s: looks like grou strike was starting to
545.76s: base out what do we think about
547.84s: potentially trading this for reversal
549.52s: play and like I was I've been talking to
551.56s: you guys about this trade for a while
553.20s: because i' been trading it to the
554.76s: downside via ratio put diagonals and
557.56s: then I ended up getting out um just
560.60s: naturally before the trip funny enough
562.72s: which happened to be really good timing
563.96s: on the trade but I would have just kind
566.24s: of followed it otherwise using just stop
570.28s: but I would have no problem trading this
572.44s: to the upside the tricky part here
574.96s: though is that the rest of the market
576.88s: isn't to accommodating so what I mean by
579.28s: that is if I'm trading some sort of
580.64s: price mean reversion play like this I it
583.28s: it is absolutely snapped all the way out
586.16s: like a rubber band super super far out
588.28s: of line in my opinion and when I see
591.00s: this kind of price Behavior it does
592.92s: interest me to the upside especially
594.76s: with this follow-through day that it had
596.80s: now typically speaking what I would do
599.16s: is is essentially look to enter if we
602.72s: come down we base below this and then
604.60s: you break above in this case it's the
606.44s: 222 handle then essentially trading that
609.28s: using the 222 handle as a stop but it's
611.68s: a super speculative play the probability
613.68s: of getting stopped out is really strong
615.72s: now the other thing that's even more
617.00s: important in this context is what the
618.52s: broader Market is doing that does not
620.36s: have big Market wind at its back meaning
623.12s: Tech is doing really well but it's also
625.60s: important to remember that for crowd
626.88s: strike specifically this move was
628.60s: entirely precip itated by an impact only
631.92s: to Windows systems less than 1% of the
635.12s: the total systems in its Network
638.88s: so even though like it's impactful right
642.28s: like there's a lot of issues caused by
644.36s: it it's not like this crazy thing that's
646.96s: going to in my opinion completely cause
649.12s: crowd strike to go under or anything
651.24s: like that this just looks like a
652.84s: visceral reaction and again this is a
655.52s: really well-known phenomenon in the
657.40s: stock market this is price indis
659.28s: greatness meaning information is not
661.44s: priced in super well and it causes these
663.68s: kinds of movements now as far as the
665.92s: reversal like I said that's an
667.48s: interesting play here it doesn't have
669.76s: the broader wind at its back which is
671.68s: something that I do consider but when I
673.80s: look at the options chain for something
675.44s: that's fallen down so far take a look at
677.16s: this it is
678.72s: 344,000 calls against 328,000 puts so it
683.80s: literally already has cew in terms of OI
687.00s: for something that is literally in free
689.36s: fall so what this tells me is the market
691.24s: is starting to play the upside and you
693.44s: can see this also the volume just the
695.52s: number of transactions today 78,500
698.76s: calls transacted against 51,000 puts so
703.28s: again people in the options markets are
705.64s: trading this to the upside in a pretty
708.64s: clear way so if we look at the overall
710.96s: call volume today
712.36s: 27% were at the offer or above so those
715.40s: are people that are buying calls and
717.00s: only 16% were at the bid or below in
718.96s: terms of of selling so yeah in my
721.36s: opinion what we're seeing are people
723.16s: buying calls we see people selling puts
725.64s: If This Were me that is the initial way
728.20s: that I would play it only because the
730.00s: broad Market is not wind at its back if
733.44s: we had Tech still doing really well I
735.72s: would have no problem playing this with
737.72s: something like a ratio call diagonal I
739.60s: like those kinds of plays for these
741.32s: larger expected reversion but again with
745.00s: the way that the broad Market is
746.28s: behaving I don't necessarily love that
748.32s: and to me it looks like first stop in
750.20s: terms of price level would be something
751.68s: around there 261 if it can get above
754.52s: even this small congestion zone so this
756.96s: would be the first hurdle to get over in
758.68s: my opinion and then this would be the
760.36s: next spot that I would be looking at
761.72s: it's just because there's a big volume
763.08s: node sticking so yeah that's kind of two
766.36s: things wrapped up in a one looking at
767.80s: crowd strike specifically but then also
769.92s: this idea of trading reversion plays
772.24s: it's catching a falling knife you want
774.08s: to wait for a little bit of strength
775.68s: generally speaking again my Approach but
778.28s: then you have to be careful and have
780.92s: really strong expectations of getting
782.32s: stopped out there's absolutely really
784.68s: really high probability of that happen
786.96s: all right now let's get over to
788.76s: everybody's
790.32s: favorite GameStop so what's going on in
793.60s: here a few things first I am really
797.20s: happy to see it literally came down to
799.72s: this 18 handle that I had drawn for a
802.16s: long time ago talking about where I saw
805.04s: essentially the next node of volume and
809.16s: it essentially hung out right by it and
811.44s: started bouncing up a little bit which
812.92s: is great to see now I still don't love
815.88s: that this is a lower low and the other
818.00s: thing that I don't love is just the
819.80s: volume it it's anemic there's so light
822.92s: volume now it's great that there's a
825.52s: pretty large percentage of buy volume
827.44s: that's fantastic but the problem here is
830.40s: it's not necessarily doing a lot it's
834.40s: good that this is starting to break up
836.24s: above this handle this 20 21 handle that
839.72s: huge but it's not doing it on a lot of
842.64s: volume so there's not a copious amount
845.16s: of participation going on here and I
847.76s: think it's important to flag that for
849.48s: people and it's because with this kind
852.20s: of movement any sort of strong volume
855.96s: can absolutely start to move this thing
858.32s: because there's such light volume in it
861.24s: as it says so let's take a look at the
863.48s: options chain really quick and then I
865.32s: want to take a look more specifically at
867.44s: some of those bigger plays that we saw
869.76s: so right now there's 683 th000 calls
873.60s: against 361,000 puts so this is getting
876.64s: still better moving closer to the 2:1
879.52s: ratio calls to puts and again that's
881.52s: just what I typically see more in a
882.76s: bullish configuration the other thing
884.84s: that you'll find different than what
886.64s: we've typically seen as of late with
888.56s: GameStop is take a look at where the
890.80s: larger volume for calls is it's not in
893.44s: the front expiration it's in the next
895.48s: expiration this 16 o that's where all
897.96s: these blue boxes are
899.80s: so I've already highlighted this
902.00s: rotation for a while now I could see it
903.96s: happening essentially real time but what
906.20s: that implies to me is that this
908.52s: expiration cycle doesn't look like a lot
910.80s: of spiciness is happening I see 91,000
914.20s: calls against 39,000 puts and then in 16
916.80s: a
917.80s: 237,000 calls to 100,000 puts so you can
921.32s: see the we're we're doing what I would
923.96s: expect to happen meaning playing the
925.64s: next primary expiration cycle now we
928.48s: still see some slightly elevated implied
931.16s: ball in the front and then in 16a gets
933.96s: down to 105 but overall still if we move
938.48s: this to the out of the money combined
940.68s: yeah that's a really Jagged profile you
943.68s: can see that on the call side meaning to
947.84s: the upside for the 16 a the out of the
950.04s: money calls they are priced a little bit
952.64s: Rich compared to the puts on a relative
954.96s: basis compared to some of these other
956.32s: expiration Cycles so again what that
959.16s: tells me is just pricing in potential
962.16s: upside moves which for something like
964.08s: GameStop you have to do because you
965.80s: literally just do not know when it's
968.48s: time for it to make that kind of jump so
971.32s: what I want to do now is take a quick
973.80s: look at some of these thicker strikes
976.76s: specifically these 125s I'm assuming yep
979.92s: out in 16 Aug there's 39,000 of those
983.00s: now so if we grab all of these strikes
986.88s: we go out to these 125s
989.36s: take a look at that that's very
991.84s: different so over yesterday to today
996.00s: 6,000 of these were closed in terms of
999.48s: net add net subtract 6,000 of these
1002.88s: contracts exited which is actually
1004.88s: really interesting and 2,000 of them
1007.64s: traded today I would be very interested
1009.80s: to see if this continues to be closing
1011.84s: volume versus exposing new trade volume
1016.56s: because I'm actually seeing a lot of
1018.28s: General closing volume here even in this
1020.48s: 16 a expiration cycle which is kind of
1022.64s: interesting now here the 25s are getting
1025.52s: Super Active still with 21,000 oi with
1028.80s: 6,000 volume today and then same thing
1032.24s: with these 23s they're fairly busy the
1035.40s: 20s are holding pretty steady that's
1039.08s: actually really interesting to me
1040.88s: there's 10,000
1043.32s: oi6 so almost Pure Balance between
1046.48s: yesterday's volume with 3700 trans acted
1049.20s: today that's probably some people taking
1051.08s: I'm guessing a little bit of profits on
1053.84s: the upside move here to unwind where
1056.52s: they can and let's take a quick look
1059.52s: actually we're going to use unusual
1060.68s: whales for time in sales so uh let me
1063.16s: take a quick look through this to see if
1064.76s: anything jumps out I haven't looked at
1066.20s: this yet but I just want to see if
1067.96s: anything looks really interesting so 16
1071.56s: Aug 30 Aug nine Aug so it's a lot of the
1073.76s: front Explorations I'm seeing and
1075.92s: there's a healthy mix right so I'm
1077.68s: seeing a healthy mix of the midpoints
1081.84s: between bid ask and I'm seeing sales and
1084.24s: buys kind of a little bit of everything
1086.52s: so let's take a quick look at unusual
1088.60s: whales and I think we'll be able to see
1092.00s: a couple things here so let me slide
1095.08s: that out of the way really quick put
1096.88s: that back and so this is looking at
1100.64s: contracts traded from the fifth and the
1102.48s: six just the last two days calls inputs
1105.56s: and there's one thing that jumped out of
1107.68s: me which is this Series right here which
1109.96s: we're going to talk about now up at the
1112.20s: top the other thing I want to highlight
1113.56s: is that there was a
1115.76s: $278,000 doll trade in the 20 SE 22 puts
1122.04s: at the offer so there's still people
1125.40s: buying downside Mo movements here and
1128.64s: you can see it in a pretty big size most
1131.24s: of the transactions that you see of
1132.60s: these larger sizes right so I typically
1135.24s: use like 100,000 as the cut off so think
1137.32s: right here all of these essentially were
1140.68s: puts with uh block here for
1145.28s: $127,000 at the 16 genan 26 which we're
1149.24s: also seeing that a lot of these build
1150.88s: out in these further expirations which
1152.36s: is interesting let's take a look at
1154.16s: these we have a series this is clearly
1157.64s: one person because you could take a look
1159.20s: at the execution times they're all right
1160.96s: around one another they're all the same
1162.64s: size so I would absolutely feel pretty
1166.00s: confident saying that this is
1167.20s: overwhelmingly likely to be this the
1168.84s: same person and it's all the 125s out in
1172.60s: 16 genan 26 they're at the bid so that
1175.56s: means that we're selling
1177.20s: puts and this is an interesting amount
1181.40s: of capital because if you take a look
1183.40s: this is 1 two 3 four five six seven
1186.32s: eight nine nine blocks so it's
1188.96s: essentially a million dollars of sold
1193.28s: premium and this is generally a bullish
1197.28s: trade you want it to go up now if we
1200.56s: take a look at modeling this trade so
1202.68s: you can see exactly what this looks like
1205.48s: so if we go out here to the 16 Jan
1211.00s: 26s and we go out here to the 125s let's
1214.16s: sell these really quick if we grab
1217.16s: those analyze that trade pop into the
1220.52s: risk profile so that you can see what it
1221.88s: looks
1222.92s: like so you can see that essentially all
1227.60s: the way out to expiration I mean this is
1231.44s: just a wild wild position it does have
1236.64s: quite a bit of downside risk but because
1239.68s: GameStop is so low already it's quite
1242.68s: limited and if we pop back over just to
1245.24s: see how
1246.24s: many total transactions it's 90
1249.72s: contracts so let's take a look at this
1252.16s: at
1253.92s: size and I wouldn't be surprised if it's
1256.28s: 100 if there's another 10 in there
1257.72s: somewhere just because cuz that would be
1260.00s: more natural human behavior see if I can
1262.80s: find those really quick I'm just curious
1264.76s: the 125s there they are right
1267.56s: there so there's another 20 actually and
1272.36s: these are both at
1274.20s: 105,000 and were there any more that
1276.80s: came through so let me recount that's 1
1278.96s: 2 3
1281.20s: 4 that's four 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
1287.04s: interesting I wouldn't expect 11 kind of
1289.00s: just a strange size here we go here's a
1291.40s: couple more 12 right so we have two
1294.28s: blocks of
1296.44s: five 12 that kind of a more natural
1299.84s: number I would say so let's take a look
1303.24s: at what this would look like
1306.76s: at 120
1309.56s: contracts so in the near term I mean
1312.32s: this is essentially behaving just like
1315.08s: long stock you can see that the total
1317.28s: downside for this trade is like
1320.00s: $200,000 nothing catastrophic and on a
1323.60s: daily basis they are going to collect
1325.36s: some premium Now the interesting thing
1327.12s: here is they're just not going to
1329.08s: collect that much which I can't help but
1331.76s: find interesting so if I look at the
1334.92s: Theta that they would get on this on a
1338.00s: daily basis it's a dollar so it's just
1340.32s: not a lot of money to sell things that
1342.60s: far in the money so this could be some
1344.44s: sort of covered put position so it's
1347.52s: kind of the inverse of selling deep in
1349.40s: the money covered calls you can do that
1351.40s: essentially on the put side which is
1353.76s: maybe what this is looking like to me
1355.64s: it's hard to tell because you're not
1357.36s: selling these to collect a bunch of
1359.20s: Premium even if you get a massive move
1362.24s: right like let's say they're expecting
1363.96s: by selling these puts and they want it
1365.44s: to go above 125 if you think it's going
1367.40s: to go to above 125 in this sense you
1369.84s: would make so much more money using
1371.84s: calls so the fact that they're not doing
1374.40s: that leads me to believe that this is
1376.44s: part of some sort of covered put
1379.72s: scenario I just can't totally see what
1383.56s: the other side of this trade is or what
1385.28s: the purpose is but it's likely being
1387.40s: used to offset something else that's my
1389.60s: best guess so quick update on the
1392.64s: markets as always if you guys need
1394.56s: anything let me know be an outlier see
1397.08s: you guys later
