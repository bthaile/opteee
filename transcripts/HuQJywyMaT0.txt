0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update. We're going to focus on the broad market and the
4.92s: FOMC statement for today because I think it's kind of a big deal. So it's worth spending
10.84s: a few minutes understanding what happened today and what that means for us going forward.
16.36s: So what happened today is we all probably have heard at this point, the Fed has selected
24.52s: to decrease rates by 50 basis point. Now for those that don't know, it's kind of a mixed
32.76s: view in my opinion. And the reason why I say it's a mixed view is because of a few things.
39.84s: It primarily comes down to how calculated of a path the Fed has taken so far with respect
46.24s: to rates. And then this near term acceleration is slightly interesting to me. So when I take
56.04s: a look at some of the primary inflation driven metrics, right? So we can see what they're
61.84s: expecting core PCE to be and what it was that they're clearly showing that they think inflation
71.20s: is under control that unemployment is strong, that the economy overall is strong. And I can
76.72s: see that perspective. But I think the relatively last minute pivot to a 50 BIPS cut versus
84.68s: 25 is actually quite telling because everything that we've done so far has been like very slow,
91.04s: very controlled, very, it seems like very considerate. And if there was going to be a 50 basis
98.64s: point cut in this cycle and it was projected like that for a month, well, I would feel a little
104.32s: bit differently, but I don't because if we take a look at the Fed watch tool before it's most recent
110.72s: update, there's kind of an important change that happened here. And it's leading up until the
119.20s: last week, the probability of a 25 basis point cut was the overwhelming majority. And it kind of
128.08s: cut down, cut down, cut down until about a week ago. And then it finally inverted. We're now a 50
135.20s: basis point cut was seen as more probable. The fact that that took place over the course of
140.48s: about a week is actually quite telling to me. It leads me to believe that based on the economic
147.52s: data that continued to flow in that the market started showing some level of concern. And that
155.92s: starts begging the question with respect to inflation. And whether or not it is fully tamped down.
163.76s: And even if it is, it begs the second question of what's the probability now of a recession.
171.52s: And we can't overlook that. So right now, I feel like in the near term, the market is going
177.12s: through this bit of a cycle of euphoria. So if we take a look at the Russell. And let's take a
183.12s: look at what it did just today. So we'll do like a one day, five minute chart. And let's see what
189.28s: it did today. You can see, I'll do it just for standard market hours. So 0 630. And you can see when
197.20s: the cut was originally announced, it flew up. It literally went from 22 19 and a half as a low
204.48s: on the day to 22 87.4. I actually traded this pretty leveraged with futures because I expected
213.60s: this move to a degree. I didn't know the magnitude or how long it would last. But I expected a
219.44s: sympathetic move. What I did not expect is this subsequent return. I was running stops. And I
227.20s: actually exited a little bit premature in some instances because I started scaling out at about
232.64s: like the to the 22 75 handle area. So I missed a few points to the upside. But here's the main
241.12s: problem I see. This is euphoria that then got really trounced down to almost pre cut levels.
248.48s: That's very interesting to me that the market went through that cycle. So when I look at the where
253.92s: the market is right now, I think it's very happy about the cuts. And I think we can see that being
259.84s: priced in. But I think the market is also now trying to understand what does this mean with
265.36s: respect to path forward and recession prospects, which then influences the way that we set up our
271.44s: portfolios. If we take a look at this from Y charts, we can see that the probability of recession
279.04s: be by August 2025. It's like 62%. Then if we take a look at this latest by JP Morgan, this is from
286.80s: 15 August. I'm actually very interested to see if they update this and what this will look like
292.88s: because they're one of the few institutions that actually called the 50 Bips cut versus 25.
298.00s: And we can see as of again, about a month ago, this is showing the probability of a recession by
304.16s: the end of 2025 at about 45%, which again is not insignificant. So I think the problem that we have
312.56s: right now is that this probability of a soft landing is not tiny. It's there. But it's also not
321.76s: quite as strong. I think as some people might think it is. And then we can see what the probability
328.16s: is again, a recession by these different timeframes because we can typically see from rate cut
333.20s: campaigns. I'm doing actually a pretty big study right now to see based on prior rate cut campaigns,
338.96s: what that meant for the stock market specifically over set durations after we start the rate cut
344.88s: campaign. The problem is that we've never had the same scenario that we just went through.
350.64s: Where essentially we had rates at 0%. Like that's there's not a good comparable period for me to
357.44s: actually compare apples to apples or at least even close to what we are going through now. Sorry,
363.60s: to what we've gone through over the last 100 years. So it's a little bit of a guessing game here.
370.72s: Now, when I'm looking at how to trade this, I'm playing the near term moves and I'm playing them
377.52s: very, very carefully. What that means is running stops. When the move today started unfolding,
384.08s: I thought for sure I was an idiot for starting to play stops. I had started them. I had already had
390.56s: a Russell position leading into today. It wasn't built today, but I started scaling into it heavily
395.68s: today. You can see that I've been in the Russell position for a little while now. But I started
399.60s: scaling into it heavy today. And I really did think like I was kind of an idiot for starting to set
405.20s: the stops where I did. And I fully anticipated that some of the stops that I were running were going
411.36s: to essentially just get me kicked out prematurely. And it was going to be frustrating because I absolutely
418.32s: did not expect this level of retracement in trade day. I didn't expect that. I thought it might
424.96s: be coming down over the next two to three days. And I didn't really expect a near full retracement.
431.92s: I thought it would be this euphoria that then boiled down and then maybe we kept a third of the move
437.20s: or something, maybe a little bit more. So what this tells me is that the market is very conflicted
442.88s: because I do think that Powell chose the 50 bips to try and accommodate the market more than
448.16s: anything because I don't see any other reason why he would have done it in that case.
452.16s: Everybody's super critical of the Fed. I give the Fed credit because I know the job they're doing
456.72s: is not easy. And I know that they're not trying to break things. They're not incentivized to do so.
461.68s: But the higher for longer idea, I get it, get inflation under control, starts to seem like that's
467.36s: the case. Now it's really is inflation actually under control. And what does it actually look like
475.76s: from a recession standpoint? And I do not know just yet. We'll see. We'll find out soon enough.
484.72s: So yeah, I'm really excited to dive a little further into this and see how the market plays out
489.36s: the rest of this week. But I think now we're coming into the next round of earnings that starts
494.16s: actually next month. So we'll have a lot to look at. So that would be the next big thing I want to
500.96s: see when we're coming into October. And we have the banks starting second week of October. I want
507.12s: to know what they're expecting now. So I'm eager to see what that looks like as well. So as always,
513.52s: anything we should take a look at. Let me know later today. We have a YouTube live session at 5 p.m.
517.68s: We'll probably talk more about this and a couple other things as they pop up. But let me know if
521.52s: there's anything else in the meantime. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
