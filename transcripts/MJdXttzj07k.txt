0.00s: What up, outliers? Quick market outlook for the week ahead. We had a bit of an interesting
7.00s: week last week. We obviously saw the Fed cut rates. There's a lot of speculation now.
13.28s: What that means for the markets going forward. There's people like myself that are still
17.52s: kind of not convinced that we're in the land of soft landing. There are other people that
23.24s: think we've nailed it and we're good. Only time will tell. So I just want to take a quick
28.36s: look of the market broadly. What's coming up this week. And that will essentially hopefully
35.20s: set us all up for a solid week. Because there's a couple things. So first off, I still am
40.44s: seeing obviously relative strength within large caps. The other thing I'm seeing is that
45.92s: even the cues are starting to rally. There's still like 20 points off off of highs. And
50.80s: then if we take a look at small caps, small caps have now taken down to seven points
57.00s: off of highs. So what that tells me is tech still is not really that strong. And then
65.72s: that tells me when I'm looking at the performance of the S&P 500, it's not it's not primarily
72.64s: coming from technology. It's coming from these other sectors. It's coming from XLU. It's
78.48s: coming from XLF, which is now just back up essentially at all time highs. We'll see
83.16s: how that goes. It's coming from XLC. It's coming from XLB. It's coming from XLI. So this
89.28s: is one of those really interesting scenarios where for so long technology was really dragging
94.96s: everything up with it. And it's kind of the inverse. It's the rest of the sector or the
100.92s: rest of the index via all these different sectors is what's really dragging spy up.
106.12s: It's not being fueled by tech. And again, this is just not super common. So when I'm looking
113.04s: for opportunities, it's really interesting. I'm still finding a lot of really interesting
118.72s: things in utilities for sure. And which I don't think most people thought that that's where
125.44s: we would be looking right now. But that is what we're still continuing to see some level
130.52s: of strength. The other thing is looking at a market perspective this coming week. We
136.20s: have a few things coming up. So when I look at the 23rd, main thing are going to be
143.28s: services in manufacturing PMI. Then the 24th consumer confidence. I'm actually not that
150.24s: jazzed about it. Meaning I don't think it's going to be a big deal. But I do think it's
153.20s: going to be an important read because what I can tell you right now is if we take a
157.36s: look at Fred, there are a few things going on. So the first thing is if we take a look
162.12s: at the link. We're right. I can see a few very clear trends. The first one is the
166.80s: link. We rates on credit cards are still going up. I can also see that consumer loan charge
174.24s: offs is also going up. So I don't like seeing all these different debt instruments from
180.36s: a consumer perspective increasing. And I also can see that personal savings is actually
185.96s: contracting, which I don't love. So a big part of this is understanding, you know, what
191.62s: the new norm is, what the new paradigm is. But what I can tell you is it's not like
195.78s: the consumer is in this fantastic position. Now I still fully expect to see things in
200.42s: like real estate showing strength because as rates come down, the real estate market is
204.94s: likely going to become a little bit more active. But I'm not sure that the consumer is
210.22s: in this rock solid position. And again, there's leads and lags to this whole thing. So
214.82s: it can take a little while before we see the consumer starting to struggle holistically.
221.34s: And if we look at the 25th, nothing really going on home sales again, I don't see anything
226.70s: really on the 25th. That's jumping out at me. The 26th big day. So we have GDP quarter
232.34s: over quarter final. We have jobless claims. Both of those are going to be a really big deal
237.78s: because now we need to see based on the cut that we had, what kind of path are we on? And
243.70s: then we also have a bunch of different Fed speaker, but our boy Jay Powell will be speaking
248.18s: in the morning. So that typically brings with it a little bit of market volatility.
253.66s: And then on the 27th, we have more inflation level metrics. So we have things like PCE,
259.54s: both regular and core. And then we have the University of Michigan sentiment. So when
264.66s: I look across this personal income consumption, these I'm expecting to see kind of fall within
270.46s: a range based on again, what I'm seeing here. But I think the big thing is the market
276.54s: is now trying to see what is the path forward? How likely is it that we find ourselves
282.62s: in a soft landing? And there's actually a really important series of events coming up
288.14s: very soon that are going to help us identify that. So if we take a look now at the calendar,
296.34s: it's pretty quiet right now. But again, if we take a look at October, we start to open
301.94s: up with the banks reporting earnings. I think this earnings report is going to be really
307.90s: this earning season is going to be really, really important. And the banks are kind of
311.66s: like the Canary and the coal mine. You'll be able to see how they're behaving in the
316.38s: current environment and what they're forecasting for the rest of the year. And all of them
321.14s: are going to integrate obviously their expected impacts from the Fed rate cuts. Because if
326.86s: we take a look now at the Fed watch tool, the Fed rate scenario or really the sofa rate
333.54s: is really interesting. So if we take a look at the probabilities here, it's literally already
340.06s: showing the probability of us landing between four and a quarter and four and a half as 51
346.70s: percent come the seven November meeting. So this is going to be really important to track
352.94s: because that's showing literally a greater than 50 percent probability right now today of
359.74s: another 50 basis point cut. That starts to become kind of aggressive. And I thought that
366.66s: the recent rate cut was whatever, it's 50 basis points in terms of where we're at is
371.50s: not a giant deal. But if we continue down this path, that I don't want to say is alarming,
378.66s: but it is concerning, I think, because obviously the probability of no change is essentially
385.02s: null. It's gone away entirely. And we're 50, 50 split between 25 basis points in 50. That
392.26s: starts to get really aggressive. And it has us hitting this two and three quarters to
399.54s: three percent. It has us landing there by September of next year, which this is the first spot
410.46s: where I see the probability of a pause that surprises me. I would expect to see a pause much
416.50s: sooner in the sequence. But I mean, who knows? We'll soon find out. So when I look across the
422.58s: broad market, though, I think this upcoming earnings is going to be really informative for us.
428.82s: So I'm eagerly awaiting that. Now for the outlier pro members, we have our live stream later
434.82s: today. So we'll dive into running through some scans, looking at some trades. But for everybody
439.54s: else, I will catch you on the live stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time, be an outlier. We'll see
444.50s: you guys out there.
