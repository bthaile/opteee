0.00s: What up, outliers. Today is all about GME and we have a hilarious series of new documents
7.28s: on the bed bath and beyond case that have come out recently that are we're going to take
13.76s: a look at mostly tomorrow during the live stream. Today, I just want to do a gloss over
19.48s: of some of the things that have come across so far. And then I want to take a look at
22.56s: GameStop, the stock because it was expiration. And as you know, we have to pour one out for
27.44s: the homies because there was hundreds of thousands of options that expired worthless
30.96s: today. So we got to pay our tribute to the fallen soldiers there. So that's the game
38.24s: playing for say is just looking at some GameStop stuff. So quick update in general on the daily
43.92s: video schema is I'm actually going to go back to picking like one or two specific things that
49.92s: I want to talk about versus like the broad market update because I'm also doing a daily live
54.48s: stream. So the game plan is during the live stream is when I'll do kind of like the market
59.04s: updates stuff. So in the meantime, the video that I release each day other than Saturdays will be
66.32s: about something specific like this GameStop. So here we go. This one was hilarious.
72.48s: This is obviously a deposition of Cohen. So he's the one that's currently answering questions.
79.68s: So you can see like the top part here starting from number eight. They're talking about the
84.64s: consultants and we know that Cohen doesn't have a super favorable opinion of them. And especially
93.04s: in this, like how it all went down. So this is the part I really want to highlight on starting
98.56s: from 13. It says or BCG, right? This is the question. Sure, consultants. I know that you,
105.12s: you are critical of those. But what I'm saying is that you never felt ever while you were
109.04s: invested that they did any of these things. Correct? And here's Cohen's answer for just the g.
115.36s: up moment. The company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't know what they did
120.08s: or didn't do. They did a remarkable job of driving the company off of a cliff. They get a
125.12s: naplus for that. It's awesome. It's such an awesome response. And as you guys know, I am just
130.80s: an idiot online. I'm not an attorney. I don't know anything about any of this stuff. But from my
137.20s: just deductive reasoning, this is actually a pretty smart answer because one of the issues they
141.12s: have with this case is that Cohen didn't pay the consultants because he didn't feel like they
148.48s: did the job. So by answering like this, he's essentially saying that regardless of contractually
156.16s: what they agreed that they would do or not do, the result was bad. So I actually think this is
162.88s: a really smart response, also just a hilarious framing of the response. And yeah, overall,
169.36s: I thought that that was a pretty interesting component to this.
173.04s: From my understanding, I think it was like with BCG specifically, they had like a 30 million
178.32s: unpaid bill of some sort. I'm not saying that they didn't pay them at all. I don't know those
181.76s: details. I just know that I came across that at some point that they had an unsettled account
186.40s: there. And so this is just a hilarious response. The other thing that I thought was interesting was
190.56s: this question or kind of comment from Ruff Willow. And it says, how did this guy pass the bar exam?
196.40s: So Mr. Freen says, no, no, no, if you want to ask him his opinion, you now have
200.80s: him under oath giving his testimony. If you want to show him something and ask him whether he
203.84s: agrees with it, he'll tell you whether or not he agrees with it. And then you'll have his
207.20s: testimony, Mr. Jaffrey says, okay, thank you for the advice. So these are obviously the again,
213.44s: don't know, guessing two attorneys. It looks like Farina is with Cohen and Jaffrey is on the other
220.88s: side. Now what I do think is important to point out, again, like I understand why people might
225.20s: think this, but you have to know it's fun to poke fun. I love poking fun, trolling a little bit
231.12s: having a bit of a jast and just throwing around some insults. It's a good time. Bans are
236.64s: is great. However, it is also important to make sure we understand like this actually doesn't
241.92s: apply here at all. So this guy is asking really smart questions in the way that he's doing it.
247.04s: So my guess is that person that posted this saying how they passed their bar exam is essentially
253.20s: saying that like Mr. Farina was explaining to Jaffrey essentially how to do things, but from my
258.24s: understanding, during the depositions, one of the tactics attorneys will use is that they'll have
263.28s: a document that essentially has some sort of transcription or information. And then they'll ask
269.12s: the person about what's on the document without showing them. And then essentially what they're
274.00s: trying to do is get a contradiction. They'll say like what did you do last Tuesday? And the person
279.04s: will say what they think they did last Tuesday and they'll say, oh, interesting because in this
282.32s: email over here, it says you did this last Tuesday. What does that mean? Right? So they're trying
287.20s: to create problems. That's why depositions go the way they go. It's why you'll see attorneys
294.24s: ask questions 16 million times. That's the same question. They just try to rephrase it slightly.
301.84s: In the whole goal there, it's just attrition. These are long sessions where they're beating you
305.84s: over the head with these questions, just trying to find small holes in kinks that they can pull out.
312.08s: The other thing is that they want to make sure that they're getting to a point with their
314.96s: responses so that when if and when it goes to trial, they already know your answer because they've
320.72s: essentially boxed you into an answer going through the deposition process. So if they say what did
324.64s: you do last Tuesday, you'll say I went to the beach and then they'll say what else did you do?
328.96s: Oh, I had lunch. What did you have for lunch? I had toast. What else did you have for lunch?
332.88s: Turkey sandwich, right? Like they're literally going to get to that detail so that during the
337.04s: actual trial as they're going through their story, trying to frame out how they can,
341.28s: they already know all your answers. And then if you bulk on it while you're going through the trial
345.68s: itself, then you look dumb because then they'll say, oh, interesting because during your sworn
349.12s: testimony, you said this, now you're saying this. Can you explain that? Put some in a bad spot.
353.84s: So I just want to point that out because again, like I'm down for the jokes, love this. It's a
359.52s: hilarious question or like it's a hilarious comment, right? But for those that actually take this
364.32s: seriously thinking like, wow, this is so dumb. How dumb are these lawyers? They're not. They're
367.84s: fucking smart. Unfortunately, super smart. And the people that are involved in these kind of cases,
372.48s: like about as high profile as they can get. So you're going to have the quintessential big law
378.96s: firm attorneys with tons of experience that make millions of dollars doing this stuff.
384.48s: You're not going to have kind of the run of the mail me trying to play lawyer like these are
389.52s: smart people. So it's just important to know that it's again, better to banter. I like that better
395.28s: myself. But it is important to know and actually like analyze the playing field for what it is. These
401.92s: are not stupid people. So anyways, just a couple of things that I saw here at a pre-limm for those
407.92s: that are interested. This is the website and the case number that you could look up. So this one
413.36s: here specifically exhibit 41, which is Doc 130 attachment five. This is actually the deposition.
418.72s: It's like 77 pages. Like I said, I haven't gone through it all. We'll go through it more in depth
423.60s: together during the live session tomorrow. But this is essentially the latest documentation that's
429.76s: been added on the 14th of August. So the whole thing is continuing to move along. It looks like it
437.28s: started back on 23 aug in 22. So yeah, this is the website. The case you can look up to find it
445.12s: if you're so interested. All right, let's turn it over to here. Take a look at GameStop.
450.32s: What do we see in here? Well, we're seeing sideways. And that's essentially the long and short from
457.84s: at actual price perspective volume is still super, super light. Volume today was 3.6 million.
466.88s: Against the 28 average of 7.28 million. We contracted volume over yesterday, which is 5.3. Today's
474.72s: 3.6. So volume is just super low here. We're not seeing a lot of movement. This kind of further
481.04s: bolsters this whole consolidation thesis. Now one thing that's worth pointing out that I think
487.12s: is favorable for GameStop is small caps is starting to grab a little bit of a leg here.
493.20s: So that just adds a general wind at the back of small cap stocks when the broader index itself
501.44s: is progressing in a positive direction. So that part is actually in my opinion pretty good to see.
508.16s: So looking at GameStop options, those specifically, we had a ton, we had a ton,
515.52s: expire today. So if we take a look at the 16-og and we look at the out of the monies,
522.08s: there is 346,359. So pull one out for the homies. I'm going to pour it in my mouth so it's not on my
528.56s: carpet. But there was a pretty big decline in the overall options chain today. Now one of the
538.48s: things that I like to look for in days like this though is did we start a big bout of volume
545.12s: in the next expiration cycle. So if we take a look at the volume today, we can see all these
549.76s: blue squares popping up. That's 23-og. So this is the next expiration cycle, but you notice these
556.24s: are actually very small sizes. So today, from the call side, there's probably 150, almost
564.88s: probably a little more than that out of the money, 150,000 out of the money calls that expired
570.40s: worthless. And now, as far as replacements in 23-og, the biggest offering, biggest volume today
578.16s: was 5,273. So this is just a pretty big slowdown. So when we take a look at 23-og, you'll see that
587.44s: it's getting built out over yesterday. And my guess is on Monday at the open, this will get built
591.60s: up more from people moving positions out from yesterday into today. And then from today into
598.88s: next week, after expiration here, but there was just a ton of options that got nothing. So the 23s,
607.12s: there was 12,000 of those essentially with 614 added over yesterday. There was 9900 traded today.
614.96s: Again, my overwhelming guess is that for these larger explorations, when you see like 9900 traded
621.04s: today, 4700 traded today, to me, that's probably people trying to scalp any existing value out of
627.76s: these that they can to save some of it. So that's what I see on the call side. Now,
634.24s: when I look at our implied volatility, super low, I mean, it's just super low. It's not even above
642.00s: 100 anywhere. And I still see this six-sep expiration, super light, 84% IV, as compared to,
652.00s: I mean, and this has earnings as compared to 13-sep, which is 92. And then the primary expiration
658.00s: after that is 89. That's still surprising to me. And I'm expecting that to change. I'm expecting
663.76s: this IV to expand. And the reason why I pointed out is for me that it's a tradable event. It's
668.64s: something that I will trade because my opinion is that this wall is going to expand. And it's
676.72s: because there's earnings there. And it's very rare that you'll find an earnings
681.52s: expiration cycle that is like that much, almost 10 points lower from the next expiration cycle.
687.28s: It's just very anomalous. So it's something that I will probably look to trade. So that's what we
693.68s: got for today. As always, if there's any questions, anything you want me to take a look at,
697.20s: let you boy know, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
