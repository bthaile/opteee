0.00s: What's up outliers? Today we're going to talk about trading meme stocks with options.
5.52s: The whole goal of this video is to hopefully change the way we think about using options,
11.28s: because I know for a lot of traders they think it's kind of fast easy money to get leverage,
16.80s: but the problem is most of us are structuring trades probably the exact wrong way.
22.40s: So what I'm guessing is the majority of you that have tried this have probably bought some sort
27.60s: of fairly near term dated option that's pretty far out of the money and you kind of just watch
32.88s: your money evaporate in front of your eyes. So the goal is to not do that. So let's dive straight in
40.08s: and get into the details. So first off I'm going to give you some general concepts to keep in mind
45.76s: about trading directionally with options and then we'll get into the specifics about meme stocks
51.12s: as an example. So when we're trading directionally with options there's a few things that need to be
56.08s: nailed down before we even start. The first one is the profit mechanism. So a lot of people will
62.08s: start just picking different option structures not paying attention to the fact that if you pick
67.76s: the wrong option structure then you know you may or may not make money it's hard to tell. But what I
72.88s: can guarantee you is that if you don't have a defined profit mechanism doesn't matter what
77.60s: option structure you pick you won't make money. So we have to figure out how things make money
83.20s: first and here are a couple examples. So we have things like price movement changes in volatility,
87.84s: yields if something pays a dividend if there's correlation so on and so forth. So when we're talking
92.56s: about meme stocks there's some very specific traits that come with them but the main thing that
98.08s: we're trading when we're looking at stuff like meme stocks is actually these two right here price
104.88s: movement and volatility which we'll talk more about. So once we understand the profit mechanisms
110.00s: we need to measure them. We need to understand how they work. What are the in-sign outs of when it
116.48s: happens which I have a prime example for you that we're going to get into looking at five different
121.28s: meme stocks from GameStop, Cost, Siri, Lunar to give you some ideas on how to look at this. But we
128.00s: need to not just understand the profit mechanism but we need to measure it and then figure out
132.88s: corresponding signals that help us find it. Now we get to use options. We get to look at what
140.00s: structures make the most sense or what we're trying to accomplish because as you'll know when we
146.24s: go through an example in a minute there are trade-offs to every single options structure and that's
152.08s: the beautiful part is you get a chance to fit things so that it makes sense based on your specific
159.20s: thesis. So if we have things that are expected to move a whole bunch well we probably don't want to
164.64s: sell premium because then we're going to miss out on a lot of profit. You'll learn more about that
168.24s: in a moment. The last thing is to tie all of this together. So now we understand the profit mechanism.
173.92s: We've measured it. We know how it behaves. We've identified signals that help us find it. We've
178.16s: compared different structures and we understand what structures make the most sense based on how
183.04s: this thing moves and our ability to detect it. So now we codify what we're doing so that we can
188.88s: continually do it over time consistently and that allows us to optimize our approach and ultimately
196.96s: make more money which is the name of the game. So if we think about this process it's actually
202.88s: pretty straightforward and we'll look at an example together. So we're going to start by looking
207.84s: at a profit mechanism. Then we're going to start figuring out what strategy makes the most sense.
212.64s: I follow kind of a three step process where I'm going to look at what is my general thoughts towards
217.52s: the economy, the market, that kind of stuff. Look at the portfolio. See if there's any specific
221.36s: needs and then the position itself. Then I'm going to build a trade and for this example we're
227.52s: actually going to look at meme stocks. So let's start with what we just talked about. What's the
232.72s: profit mechanism? Well the profit mechanism here as I've already outlined is going to be price
237.44s: movement up or down and volatility changes up or down. So then what are some of the traits that we
243.12s: can think of when we look at meme stocks? Well let's eyeball it really fast. If we hop over to the
249.12s: platform you'll see a few things right out of the gate. So I'm right now looking at GameStop.
253.68s: One of the things I notice about the profit mechanisms here is that they're pretty severe.
258.40s: All that means is I can find plenty of periods of time where things are kind of really really quiet
263.20s: and then all of a sudden they get really not quiet. That's very very important to identify. And
269.36s: again if I look at something like Siri I see the same thing. It'll go through periods of time where
274.00s: it trends a little bit, trends again then takes another trend and then it'll go through these
278.40s: explosive periods up or down. So what I'm doing here is identifying the traits of this profit
286.40s: mechanism. So I can obviously see that it's very high volatility and I can see that it moves very
291.60s: quickly. Now this is just an eyeball test. I'm looking at the charts coming up with some ideas
296.40s: and you'll see in a second that we can get one click into detail and actually qualify and quantify
303.20s: both profit mechanism behavior and then signals. Because again signals are how do we determine
308.64s: when this stuff starts to happen. So again when I look through this and just eyeball it there's
314.08s: one thing I can tell you clear as day. When I see price starting to go crazy I see volume go crazy
319.84s: across the board in every single circumstance. So here we can see prices kind of like trending
325.04s: but notice how volume although comparatively to here it looks way less it still is much higher than
330.08s: what it was in here. So that gives me some ideas on what might matter. I also can see clear
336.00s: relationships between prices relationship to moving averages or even things like oscillators.
342.08s: So then what I do is I take those ideas and I say okay well let me take a look at some different
348.64s: indicators and let me find a correlation between certain size price moves and what that indicator
355.36s: is showing me. And in this case you can see a bunch of different indicators but what jumps out
359.28s: at me is that the five day average volume across all of these different stocks which is this redline
365.52s: here is highly highly correlated with price movement of greater than 10%. So then that gives me
371.76s: one thing I need to pay attention to. Okay I now know average volume in relation to current volume
377.76s: is actually pretty informative. I can also tell you something using like an RSI with a five day
382.80s: moving average is not very correlated. So that might be one I spend less time focusing on and I
388.64s: spend more time focusing on these other tools. Volume is a massive massive indicator. So then I also
395.28s: want to qualify and quantify those movements I was talking about. Okay so now if I see any of these
401.60s: stocks move greater than 15% once it moves 15% how much higher above it does it typically go
408.80s: and we can see that in these bars for costs series so if I lunar in GME then I can also say okay how
415.36s: long does it stay above that threshold that's what the redline is and I can tell you that it's
421.04s: really short duration for most of them after those moves. So all of this information directly feeds
428.40s: into how I think about building positions which we're going to get into right now. So I can tell you
434.08s: in terms of timing that there are two different elements to this. One if I'm trying to time it really
440.08s: really well and catch the majority of the move I'm going to have to have some sort of longer term
443.84s: position in here because by the time you start to see volume expanding it's already starting its move.
448.48s: Now my preference is actually to follow the latter part of the move more than anything but if you're
453.44s: trying to capture the whole move you have to be very thoughtful about what duration you choose to
458.80s: pick. So for something like GameStop right now as if I was trying to trade some sort of what I
463.04s: expect to be upward movement well it's really quiet. There's nothing for me to do right now. So
467.44s: I'm probably going to favor a mix of long term and short term durations so that the long term can
473.92s: keep me exposed if the thing happens before I can pick up on it but then when I start to see some
480.80s: of these signals occurring then maybe I can add some short term trades as well the capitalize on
485.52s: the movement when they start to move. The other thing I can tell you is that I have a bunch of other
490.64s: visuals here but the overall move severity meaning how far it tends to move the vast majority of
495.92s: the case sits not much but then sometimes it will have a smaller subset of these really big
502.00s: parabolic moves. So then it tells me the majority of the time I'm going to be playing it it's
507.76s: actually for less than these massive moves that we might see and then that tells me that every once
513.84s: in a while I'll see a really big move. So then that leads me to a few strategies that I think
519.76s: make the most sense. Trading it to the upside I'm probably going to use something like ratio call
524.32s: diagonals or just regular diagonals and I would add kicker options. I have a video that I'll link
529.36s: to in the notes below that goes through this more in detail we'll look at a quick model together
533.44s: and then the way that I can trade it to the downside because I know that it doesn't stay above
538.16s: the threshold for that long is by trading something like long puts. So why do I favor long premium
543.92s: strategies? Because as we've talked about I want the structure to fit the thesis and if I'm talking
549.76s: about things that are moving a lot I actually don't want to have capped profit potential so I can
555.12s: capture those moves when they happen. The other thing is if I'm trading some sort of short premium
560.80s: against it it can be really painful to go through these really big moves and it can be problematic.
565.92s: So let's talk about this idea of building these trades now. So when I'm going through and I'm deciding
571.68s: let's just start with ratio call diagonals. This is a really simple structure. Essentially what I'm
576.56s: going to do is select the product that I want to trade and then I'm going to figure out where I
581.84s: think it might go to. Some of us might think it's Moas. Some of us might think it could be another
586.48s: run up above 45 whatever your profit target is. Then I'm going to start modeling trades off of
591.84s: that. The important part of defining a profit target is so that you don't do this where let's say we
597.12s: get in when GameStop is down here at 10 bucks it goes up to 64 and then it comes back down and
602.16s: then we're just still in it. Not saying get out not saying completely move away but what I am saying
607.36s: is that if you do this you showed a massive profit that then went away and again if it's some sort
613.76s: of long term buy and whole trade for you that's a completely different strategy. This is talking
617.68s: about trading these movements. So you need a way to get out when it's at a favorable price or even
623.52s: reverse the position to take it to the other side. So what I tend to do is look at a few different
628.64s: choices but the very first thing we have to decide on when buying call options is how far out in
634.00s: time do we want to go because if you are too close in time a to decay is very very high. So I try
642.00s: to balance a few things because if you'll notice that they did a kicker of here it really starts
647.68s: to accelerate once we get within 30 days to expiration. I don't necessarily want that. The other
654.16s: problem is gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of delta and if we're buying options we want gamma.
660.88s: It's how our options start to compound. So the way that I think about it is if I want to maintain
666.00s: a position in GameStop I'm going to use options that are slightly further out in time. I'm going to
671.44s: use options that are actually slightly in the money. Why do I do this? Because they have a higher
676.24s: delta. So they're going to move better dollar for dollar with the underlying. These are going to be
680.72s: more expensive. So I have to account for that upfront but I can always add what I like to call
687.52s: kicker options which would be combining it if movement starts to happen. So let's say I
692.80s: established that position now because I think it's at an overall good price level right then if it
697.28s: starts to show volume exceeding the five day average and it's starting to look bullish. Well then
701.76s: in that case I can come back in and I could say well maybe I'll go out like 30 days or 20 days
706.56s: and then I'll pick up some options that are maybe like a 30 delta something like that. Now what's
712.48s: the problem with just grabbing these? They're way cheaper. They look awesome. There was a problem.
716.72s: Notice how high the theta decay is. It's three cents which might not sound like a ton three dollars
722.16s: but as a percentage of the remaining premium it's actually quite massive. So this is why if we take a
728.56s: look at an example here this is looking at that one single in the money option and let's say we get
735.04s: that move up to 45 up here. If we get that we make twenty two hundred bucks. Not bad we're putting up
740.64s: four hundred and eighty dollars to make that. That's great. We would make way more money if we buy
745.60s: the twenty seven September twenty one and a half calls so slightly out of the money for forty nine
750.16s: cents because they're so cheap we essentially can get ten of those for the price we get one of the
754.80s: other ones and then if we get that move to forty five well now we make twenty three thousand dollars
760.08s: that sounds pretty damn good doesn't it but again there's a problem. Here's the problem. Watch as
766.48s: I fast forward time just a little bit. If I go forward let's say to the twenty fifth of September
773.44s: notice what happens to my options they essentially start decaying away to nothing and then they
780.00s: have to have a much bigger move in order to make the same amount of money and then as we talked about
786.32s: before there's an overwhelming probability of instances where we don't actually get the big move
792.32s: so then if you continue buying these cheap out of the money options you're going to cycle through
796.64s: them repeatedly until hopefully sooner or later it hits but how much will have been lost in that
801.52s: process which is exactly why I prefer to trade something like this. It doesn't make as much money
807.92s: but it doesn't lose anywhere near as much money as time passes and I make more money off of
814.00s: smaller moves that allow me to slowly build my account versus eroding it and then when I see
820.16s: interesting conditions I can add those kicker options so the way to think about picking an
825.68s: expiration is the more time you give yourself the better off you're going to be in terms of
830.64s: letting the trade work but it's going to be more expensive. The other thing you do is when you go
834.80s: further out in time you might be incentivized or think it's better or maybe I'll go further
839.04s: on time but get these cheap options. Well the problem with the cheap options is they will have
843.28s: lower gamma being further out in time so if I show you gamma this is showing you two different
848.96s: explorations this is showing you 10 DTE versus 30 DTE and if you go to like 60 it's even further
853.60s: down here. So the problem is if gamma is too low and you have a low delta so let's take a look at
859.52s: these 30 force for example. If GameStop goes up by a dollar my options will appreciate by 30 cents
865.36s: and then my delta will gain by three so this will go from 30 to 33. It's not bad but compare that
872.72s: to these 18s that I was modeling in the other trade. In this case if GameStop goes up by a dollar
878.40s: the premium will change by 70 cents or 70 dollars and then I'll gain four gamma so I'll get a
885.44s: little bit more gamma and on a dollar for dollar move I'll make more but here's the tradeoff
890.08s: it's more money upfront your money is not going to compound as much compare that to the inverse
895.60s: if you buy further out of the money options no matter if it's closer far they're going to decay
900.24s: more quickly and if it's a lower delta in further out in time they're less sensitive to price
905.36s: movements so then you stand to make less overall. This is the beauty of trading options and for me
911.12s: the answer for something like this is pretty simple I would essentially structure long calls via
916.00s: something further out in time I would probably sell some near term short calls against it to help
921.36s: subsidize the cost and I would do it at a ratio this is what makes it a ratio call diagonal so for
926.96s: example if I add these calls against my longs but instead of just having one let's say I put on
933.20s: five of them and then I sell two calls against it so now I have a leveraged long position I'm
938.72s: collecting some theta from these short calls and then when the move eventually starts to happen
944.32s: then I can come in closer in time again maybe this 2431 dte and then add some kicker options
951.04s: that are further out of the money higher probability of losing the investment but if I do get the move
956.32s: then they make a bunch of money make sure you have a system to capture it because again it doesn't
960.80s: do you any good the hold options that are decaying assets have them show a really great profit
965.76s: and then watch the profit go away not saying you have to book a full win every single time there is an
970.32s: entire world around managing partial parts of your trade setting stop losses but the name of the game
975.20s: is to do something and if we're interested in learning more about that let me know we can do a follow
979.28s: on video now the last thing that we have to cover is how do we manage the downside because options are
985.84s: decaying assets so for me I typically will set price levels that if something starts dropping below
992.88s: them then I will either start pairing my position down or I'll flatten it entirely and just say
997.60s: I'm directionally wrong if you are using longer term options you can give yourself a much wider window
1003.28s: but sooner or later you have to do something with the options because otherwise they will decay
1008.24s: away into nothing so taking them all the way to expiration typically is not a great idea so the
1013.36s: simplest approach for me like I said is literally just setting alerts like this and if I get alert to
1018.72s: the upside or the downside then I'll move a stop up and continue to track the profits like that
1024.08s: and if it's on the lost side I'll set a defined period that I will get out and then if it starts
1029.36s: going back up I'll get right back in but what I don't want to do is hold the asset as it's decaying
1034.96s: because then it makes it more and more difficult to make money until next time be an outlier I'll see you
1039.92s: all later
