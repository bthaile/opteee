0.66s: think or Swim it's a huge platform for a
3.18s: lot of people it's overwhelming I know
4.74s: it was for me when I first started but I
6.30s: want to walk you through the platform I
8.40s: started trading on it back in 2007 when
10.50s: I first started trading so I've had over
12.24s: 16 years on it I've gone to a bunch of
15.30s: different webinars on it I even
17.10s: participate in some of the alphas for
18.72s: new features that they're releasing
20.04s: because I like it overall it's pretty
21.90s: robust so I want to walk you through two
23.22s: things the first thing some general ins
25.50s: and outs how I like to set it up stuff
27.12s: like that and then at the end of the
28.98s: video I want to go through how I use the
31.62s: chart side of the program because it's
33.42s: really powerful and there's a lot you
35.22s: could do with it so what's up everybody
37.14s: Eric here welcome back to all the
38.58s: outliers and a shout out to the patreon
40.86s: family you guys make videos like this
42.24s: possible so thank you so much for the
43.74s: support let's get right to it so here we
46.02s: go we're going to start from the trade
47.22s: Tab and you'll notice that we have these
49.50s: different sub tabs I'm not going to go
51.00s: through everything think or Swim
53.34s: actually is a really comprehensive
54.72s: Library so if you are completely new to
57.24s: the software I'm not the right the guy
58.74s: to start with definitely check their
60.30s: stuff out for first I'm going to be
61.92s: going through some of the preferred
63.66s: things that I like to include okay
65.58s: that aside in the trade grid a lot of
68.82s: people don't even know this exists it's
70.68s: underneath the underlying drop down so
72.54s: if I close all these down you can kind
74.22s: of see
75.48s: um what choices are available the
76.98s: underlying is just typical
79.50s: um details about the underlying itself
80.88s: you can customize some of this actually
82.44s: and then the trade grid I like this
84.42s: because you can actually drop level two
86.46s: data you can also drop the order book
88.44s: depending on the product stuff like that
89.94s: which I actually think is really cool
91.20s: then for the options chains let's talk
94.26s: about this I like to set up all these
96.54s: different columns you'll notice that
97.98s: there's actually too many that they
99.24s: don't even you can't see the whole name
100.74s: that's okay because I know what they are
102.30s: we have bid ask last those are all your
105.48s: just general pricing tools then we have
108.00s: kind of the stereotypical options tools
110.10s: so Delta gamma Theta Vega row I like to
113.16s: think see all of them realistically and
115.26s: a lot of people actually don't realize
116.46s: how big of an impact some of these have
118.14s: and it's also really good to be able to
120.96s: see these different Greeks at different
124.32s: Deltas different stripes likes even when
127.26s: we're comparing across put calls at the
130.50s: same Delta taking a look at Theta
132.30s: between the two overall it's really
134.40s: interesting stuff and it integrates into
136.32s: a lot of my strategies in different ways
138.42s: from there we have open interest and
141.30s: then volume for those that don't know
143.04s: the difference between these two very
144.54s: simple volume is how many transacted
146.64s: today open interest is how many remain
149.70s: open at the end of the day so volume can
152.88s: be in and out open interest is what's
154.92s: remaining day over day
157.44s: have the implied volatility probability
159.78s: of in the money and probability of a
161.52s: touch
163.80s: in fact is if you take a look at a Delta
166.02s: and this is a 30 Delta if we take a look
168.42s: at the probability of in the money for
171.12s: the 13 days to expiration I'm just using
174.18s: a short put here it's the 4235 and this
177.96s: has a 30.4 percent probability of in the
181.32s: money very very close to this Delta the
183.84s: problem with using Delta as an
185.34s: approximation is that that relationship
187.20s: doesn't hold true over all periods of
189.60s: time and it actually breaks down the
190.86s: further out you go for example looking
193.20s: at a same 30 Delta but now we're 104
195.78s: days out if I look at probability of in
198.00s: the money it's 33.3 percent it's a 3.3
201.36s: percent variance which doesn't sound
202.92s: like much but that's 10 percent
204.12s: difference between these two numbers the
206.58s: point being is it's a really common
207.78s: thing to use Delta as approximation for
209.76s: in the money I don't think that's going
211.26s: to break anything necessarily but there
213.60s: is a difference and it's also going to
215.10s: change based on volatility volatility is
216.78s: very low right now so these are actually
220.14s: the closest I've ever seen them in terms
221.94s: of the true probabilities to one another
223.38s: and it also changes the further out of
225.30s: the money and the money you go stuff
226.44s: like that this is not a video about
227.76s: probabilities but I do think it's a fun
229.74s: fact and it's why I like to have Delta
232.32s: and the probability of in the money and
235.38s: the probability of a touch because also
237.30s: common way to use probability of a touch
240.36s: is 2x the Delta so that would give us 60
242.46s: chance probability of a touch it's
244.44s: actually 63.4 percent probability of a
246.84s: touch and this is for the 13 days to
248.52s: expiration the point being is depending
251.04s: on your Edge and what that looks like
252.54s: it's not exactly perfect and your
255.42s: strategy may or may not care about that
256.92s: difference I do in general but
258.60s: nonetheless I think it's good to know
260.22s: okay so that kind of goes through what I
262.92s: like to see in the options chains the
264.54s: other thing is that I typically like to
266.28s: have at least 50 strikes and it's
267.90s: because if you trade more expensive
269.22s: products like SPX if you only use
271.50s: whatever the default is I think it's
272.94s: like 10 you like this is a 38 Delta and
276.42s: a 44 Delta on the column put side you
278.28s: miss way too much so I just leave 50 and
280.98s: that's typically pretty good if I'm
282.42s: trading really wide box spreads or
284.40s: something sometimes I have to open it up
285.78s: more but in general is pretty good okay
288.36s: down here today's option statistics this
291.12s: is super useful the current IV
293.46s: percentile it is really important to
295.38s: note that this is actually incorrect the
298.02s: IV percentile is not what they're
300.24s: reporting here oh they actually changed
302.52s: it I think
304.14s: it's like they sure haven't so this is
306.66s: actually IV rank they I've wrote into
309.84s: them a bunch of times
311.94s: um but this says current IV percentile
314.28s: this is actually IV rank you can tell
316.62s: I'm not going to go into the difference
317.58s: between IV percentile and rank right now
319.38s: I have other videos on that but there is
321.48s: a difference between the two and the
322.68s: time it's going to be the most exposed
324.78s: is when there's a big move in the
326.34s: underlying but that's what's going on
327.66s: here but
330.30s: part specifically but I do like to use
332.88s: Ivy high low and I also like to use HV
337.32s: percentile IV like all of those are
339.60s: pretty decent tools I also have them on
342.12s: the charts so I don't need them but it
344.34s: depends on where I'm looking at things
345.72s: sometimes this is an easy way for me to
347.46s: check it out then over here this is kind
350.76s: of a unsung hero side of this but
353.16s: there's actually some pretty cool stuff
354.24s: in here so you can take a look at the
357.12s: volume of calls versus puts you can look
359.58s: at it for different time frames you can
361.20s: take a look at
363.00s: um also the Delta transaction bands it's
366.60s: kind of useful stuff to look for
368.04s: anomalies you have to get used to
369.66s: looking at these numbers to understand
371.16s: like what's weird but once you follow
373.86s: this for a little while you can kind of
375.36s: eyeball that stuff pretty quick like
377.40s: today for example it's no big surprise
379.50s: to me to see a lot more puts not a lot
381.90s: but notably more puts than calls
384.12s: transacting that's pretty common but
385.80s: there's barriers where you'll seal that
387.78s: see that invert same thing with the
390.84s: breakdown of Deltas you can get a feel
394.62s: for how they typically transact
396.18s: essentially
397.80s: then there's the volatility Sizzle
400.80s: indexes that's essentially like a TD
402.96s: Ameritrade version of
405.12s: um like unusual volume I don't use this
407.64s: as an index much but the book call ratio
410.04s: I do that's actually a useful tool then
413.16s: going down a little bit further we have
416.10s: time and sales I typically put this up
418.20s: in that other chart that I showed you
419.58s: but you can also see it in here which is
421.68s: kind of useful you can see if something
424.14s: was a spread itself you can also kind of
426.84s: tell even if orders are submitted
428.70s: separately what they are it also tells
431.22s: you where there's some big orders if you
432.90s: want to check that out so I'm actually a
434.76s: pretty big fan and a lot of people also
436.14s: don't know that you can filter here so
438.06s: you can take a look if you want to look
439.92s: at a specific exchange if you want to
441.42s: just look at calls puts a specific time
444.12s: series so if you just wanted to see what
445.92s: transacted today so on and so forth
447.96s: again it's a pretty robust tool that a
450.60s: lot of people don't uh don't fully take
452.82s: advantage of and it's because they don't
454.20s: know it's there then down here product
456.54s: depth this is one of my favorite tools I
459.12s: use this a lot and a lot of people don't
460.98s: which is also a bummer this shows us a
464.34s: lot so right now I have it split out by
466.92s: call input volume but you can combine
469.86s: them into an average you can look at
472.80s: just one just the other or just out of
475.26s: the money versions but here's what's
477.48s: cool you can look at volume which is
480.36s: super common for me to take a look at
481.92s: this is where you can see where things
483.18s: are centralizing I actually talk about
484.74s: this also in the zero DTE videos because
487.26s: you can see how much zero DTE volume
489.24s: there is take a look it shows you the
490.74s: expiration right here and that's still
492.78s: the majority of the volume that we're
494.64s: seeing on a daily basis but
497.04s: here's some of the other cool stuff you
499.20s: can look at open interest so you can see
501.24s: where things are remaining open and take
504.24s: a look at how big the put open interest
507.30s: is compared to the call open interest
508.92s: it's literally 2X
510.90s: like almost precisely which is pretty
513.84s: crazy significant put skew there but
516.66s: here's some other cool stuff implied
518.22s: volatility so if you're a volatility
520.26s: Trader you can actually start to see the
522.30s: volatility time series you can also see
524.40s: the surface it's not 3D because it's not
526.80s: necessarily giving you the the extra
530.22s: view but nonetheless
533.46s: you're able to do it by isolating off of
536.58s: the actual dates right you can clean
539.34s: some of the series up so you don't have
540.72s: too many the point being is you can get
542.28s: the implied volatility you can get the
544.02s: strike and the money-ness and then you
545.94s: can also figure out the DTE off of here
547.74s: it's just not as neat as the 3D version
549.78s: but it's still here which is kind of
551.70s: cool so yeah this is a really really
553.86s: cool spot to to take a look and Tinker
555.72s: with
556.92s: um and then yeah let's move on now I'm
559.08s: not going to go through Forex I'm not
560.46s: going to go through Futures active
562.26s: Trader this is another useful tool
564.36s: specifically if you intraday trade so I
566.64s: like to set it up with an ichimoku Cloud
568.38s: for intraday stuff sometimes macd
570.24s: sometimes not it all of the specific
572.94s: indicators and tools I use really depend
575.58s: on what I'm doing but the main thing is
578.46s: I like to have a chart over here and
580.44s: then I like to have the order book open
581.94s: over here because when the markets open
583.74s: you can actually see where orders are
586.08s: resting how big they are all that kind
587.88s: of stuff
588.78s: and then pairs Trader this is a really
591.00s: great place to set up a way to compare
593.76s: different products to one another so in
596.22s: this example you can see that I have a
597.84s: comparison on the left hand side for
599.52s: Walmart and Target the way I have this
601.80s: split up is into three sections the left
604.80s: hand side is combining them into a ratio
607.80s: and then the right to I typically would
610.92s: mimic whatever is over here to look at
612.90s: them individually so for example if
614.34s: we're looking at Walmart and Target I
616.20s: would drop Walmart over here Target over
618.78s: here
619.74s: and then you can see how they move in
622.02s: relation to one another across the same
623.58s: time frame it's a useful tool for me but
625.80s: I keep the TA over here super simple I
628.14s: just use some moving averages and linear
629.64s: regression channels but what I really
631.56s: like to do is look at all the different
632.88s: correlation time frames so I have
634.74s: correlations built out for three days
636.36s: five days 10 days 30 days 60 days 90
638.64s: days so on and so forth it allows me to
640.74s: very quickly assess correlation across
642.54s: different time frames if I'm looking for
644.46s: some sort of pair straight now
647.04s: down to the analyze tab for the risk
651.06s: profile this lets you see open positions
653.16s: there's not a whole lot to adjust and
655.38s: hear or modify but this is one of my
657.12s: favorite things to use anyways you can
659.28s: include commissions or not I typically
661.38s: include exclude depending on the
663.18s: strategy but I typically exclude and
665.10s: then just track it on my own and then
667.20s: for the different lines you can actually
669.54s: view day by day steps it doesn't have to
672.24s: be just off of one expiration cycle
674.76s: there's a lot of really cool Tools in
676.50s: here the probability analysis this gives
679.02s: you a probability of cone you can look
681.00s: at either in the money or a out of the
683.40s: money or a touch and then you can also
685.62s: change the probability range so this is
687.42s: a one standard deviation move so this is
689.22s: telling you this is a one standard
691.44s: deviation probability of SPX falling
694.50s: Within These time bands by these
697.26s: specific dates and that's what this
698.76s: vertical axis is well really it's the
701.10s: x-axis but I'm sorry these vertical
702.48s: lines it's showing you the different
704.18s: expiration Cycles so the y-axis is is
707.40s: actually the price now
709.80s: economic data this is another spot a lot
712.56s: of people don't know about but you can
715.26s: come in here and look at a lot of really
718.14s: interesting things so we go take a look
719.94s: at Commercial Banking and we could maybe
722.58s: look at federal funds sold and
725.22s: securities purchased for all commercial
727.02s: Banks the point being is some of these
729.48s: are like really extreme specific stuff
731.64s: but some of them are actually really
733.44s: really useful so you can look at house
735.12s: price indexes which this is super useful
737.82s: if you don't use this you can look at it
739.98s: for different time frames different
741.30s: aggregation periods you can change it
743.28s: from linear to logarithmic scale you
745.56s: could do all sorts of cool things in
747.18s: here
747.96s: really cool spot think back I don't
751.02s: typically use within here I typically go
754.14s: to On Demand which is in the top right
756.12s: corner you can't totally see it because
757.92s: my stuff's in the way but it's right
760.20s: below the x button essentially to close
762.48s: the platform you'll see a button that
763.68s: says on demand that's really cool too
765.60s: this is where you get to use the
768.30s: historic data but trade it as if it were
770.64s: live which is also very very cool
772.44s: fundamentals this is like a must so if
775.98s: we wanted to look at Nvidia which is
777.78s: just you know the Talk of the Town
779.16s: flying through the roof you can set this
781.44s: up to take a look at a bunch of
783.06s: different things but I like to include
785.40s: it automatically populates all this
787.56s: different data for you you can look at
788.82s: it on an annual basis a quarterly basis
791.04s: and then even down here it goes through
793.80s: the different details on how it did in
796.74s: the past earnings what why it did what
798.90s: it did what are some of the key trends
800.82s: within the individual product and
802.14s: Industry and then down at the bottom it
804.66s: actually breaks down the percentage of
807.66s: market cap what individual segments how
811.92s: they Institute that market cap so for
814.26s: example Computing and networking is 56.9
817.20s: percent of the Stock's market cap and
819.12s: then it can even break it down into
820.20s: sub-sectors and it can even give you
822.62s: essentially historic Trends but then
825.00s: forward price projections huge really
827.40s: really useful stuff and then earnings
830.46s: for those that don't know I track
832.20s: earnings very closely and you can take a
834.78s: look at either all of these different
836.82s: earnings you can see how it did before
838.56s: earnings how it did at earnings it tells
841.68s: you essentially what the date was down
843.48s: at the bottom which you can't totally
844.74s: see because it's cut off but then you
846.90s: can see what the actual earnings was
849.36s: what Wall Street was projecting this is
851.22s: also super common by the way were the
853.38s: actuals trend above Wall Streets because
855.30s: of the way that the earnings system is
857.70s: structured I have a video on that I'll
859.62s: actually link for you because it's such
861.48s: a up system that you can't trust
863.04s: but nonetheless I digress you can still
865.50s: track a lot of stuff you can see how the
866.94s: at the money straddle did what IV HB did
869.88s: if you track earnings the way that I do
871.86s: this is probably one of the most useful
873.54s: tools that you have at your disposal to
875.34s: quickly synthesize information
877.26s: then there's all the different scan
878.94s: scans essentially I'm not going to not
880.32s: going to go through all those but you
881.88s: can either use like some of your
883.32s: personal scan queries you can use public
885.42s: scan queries and you can just Tinker
887.64s: with a lot of different stuff I
888.78s: typically stay in stock hacker which
890.70s: allows me to look through stocks and
892.74s: then what I like to do as you'll notice
895.08s: is I have a bunch of columns set up this
898.08s: allows me to see a ton of information
901.34s: super quickly so I have all these
904.56s: different fundamental indicators I also
906.78s: have columns for technical analysis
909.42s: indicators that are custom think scripts
911.34s: like is it above a 50-day ma is it above
913.44s: the 150 day is the 50-day slope positive
915.84s: all of those kinds of things and then we
919.68s: have the market watch tab this allows us
922.86s: to look at the different indices the
925.44s: different sectors all different kinds of
927.72s: breakdowns of the publicly available
929.34s: products for us to trade I like to see
932.10s: what's in different sectors this is a
934.08s: really convenient way to do that so if
935.94s: you're curious what's in the S P 500
937.50s: here you go this is where you see it and
939.54s: then if you want to know it's in
940.50s: communication Services specifically
941.94s: Great Click there now you know and you
944.46s: can continue to dive in further and
946.86s: further based on the sector sub sector
950.18s: sub-sectors so on and so forth
953.40s: now if we go over to tools I don't
956.88s: really use this for much of anything but
958.92s: you can upload your think scripts you
961.08s: can look at different ones you can check
963.00s: out their different videos like all that
964.74s: kind of stuff so there is value over
966.84s: here same thing with the education
968.16s: center I don't use this that much but I
970.62s: know that they bake everything into this
972.78s: which is really cool but let's talk
974.52s: about charts real quick
976.14s: in general I like to use different time
980.22s: frames to take a look at different
983.18s: hypothesis so I have all of these
986.64s: different time frames quickly baked in
988.86s: so that I can quickly bounce between
992.10s: different ones based on what I'm trying
994.38s: to trade so for example
997.44s: those some other things you'll notice I
999.84s: almost always have linear regression
1001.76s: channels these are one of my favorite
1002.84s: tools I have an entire video that walks
1005.66s: through linear regression channels so
1007.22s: I'll link to that in the notes below
1009.38s: a couple other things I do like to
1011.36s: include earnings
1013.40s: um in the chart and dividends it kind of
1015.44s: gives me just some general context which
1017.12s: I find useful then down below for the
1019.76s: sub graphs I have volume volume average
1023.30s: then I have a macd histogram and then
1027.44s: the macd2 lines it kind of gives me a
1029.84s: little better Fidelity when I'm using
1031.34s: macd it's not always this but sometimes
1033.56s: so and then I always have IV HV plots
1037.46s: for different time frames I have
1039.92s: specific calculators that let me look at
1042.32s: intraday IV more effectively because
1045.26s: this essentially IV is going to update
1048.02s: end of day here whereas HB would update
1050.84s: throughout the day that's just the
1051.92s: movement of the underlying and then this
1054.08s: last sub graph that you see is actually
1055.88s: all broad Market data this actually
1057.74s: isn't tied to this individual stock at
1059.78s: all so down here I have things like tick
1062.18s: Trend average weighted Trend I have
1064.52s: different vix future months so I can see
1068.18s: if we're in contango accredation how
1070.82s: steep it is and then I also have net
1073.76s: highs lows and then Advanced decline
1076.52s: cumulative average so those are just
1079.34s: breath indicators for the broad market
1081.38s: now
1082.94s: back up here in the main chart section
1085.52s: there's a few other things that you'll
1087.74s: see so I already told you about the
1089.30s: linear regression channels I have a
1091.04s: volume profile which I really really
1092.84s: like and I always put it kind of in the
1095.48s: background I overlay it on the chart so
1097.58s: that it's not in my way and if you're
1100.46s: curious how to do that you go to edit
1102.50s: study and then these are the settings
1104.18s: essentially that you want to set up so I
1107.60s: don't have it on the expansion if you do
1109.58s: that that's when you're going to have
1110.54s: like that split chart which I don't like
1112.52s: and then some of the other things is
1114.56s: just changing the opacity so that it's
1116.30s: not like super in your face and I also
1119.06s: like to change the color of the profile
1121.82s: itself so that it's not quite as loud
1125.00s: but then I get rid of essentially all
1127.52s: this other stuff I don't have the value
1129.02s: areas I don't have the low profile the
1131.36s: high profile just kind of showing you
1132.86s: the the overall parameters of it I don't
1134.96s: use any of that stuff because it's just
1136.04s: extra noise I just want to see the
1137.42s: profile itself which is right here and
1140.06s: then
1140.84s: I always have moving averages so I
1144.14s: tinker with different time frames a lot
1146.36s: but typically it's going to be a short
1148.34s: term either a nine day 10 day 11 day
1150.98s: right now my short term is a nine day
1154.22s: and this is an SMA and then here we have
1158.00s: a 22-day EMA exponential moving average
1161.30s: and then this third one that you see let
1164.30s: me try to isolate it so that you can see
1167.06s: clearly here we go this is a 50-day EMA
1169.58s: and then this one's almost always a 150
1171.92s: or 200 right now it's a 200 EMA I like
1175.34s: to use these different moving averages
1176.72s: because also it's very educational for a
1179.36s: lot of different things but it's most of
1182.06s: what I have on my chart is pretty simple
1183.56s: in nature like if you think about it and
1185.78s: I purposely keep it that way because
1187.46s: there's a lot of stuff out there and I
1190.34s: find this stuff to work pretty well
1191.66s: sometimes I'll add things like anchor V
1193.58s: waps Bollinger Bands but
1196.46s: more often than not this is going to be
1198.44s: the setup and then at the top I have
1200.72s: different labels these are all think
1202.52s: scripts and I have things for implied
1204.80s: volatility percentile and rank which I
1206.72s: already told you before but then I also
1208.46s: plot out the expected moves in a dollar
1211.22s: and percentage amount then I also have
1213.62s: like the average daily range and average
1215.60s: true range so I have the percent removed
1218.36s: today the five day average daily range I
1220.52s: tinker with different time frames on the
1222.08s: ADR and the ATR
1224.72s: and then we have the high low for the
1226.76s: week and for the month
1228.14s: again this is just kind of giving us
1230.24s: General context around things at the
1232.82s: money put call ratio so what strike what
1235.10s: expiration we're using and what is the
1237.38s: put call ratio and then this is actually
1239.48s: a pretty cool can slim tool that I found
1241.94s: and modified a little bit but it pulls
1244.40s: in the earnings per share you over year
1246.26s: the quarter over quarter the return on
1248.90s: Equity
1250.34s: um how far we are off of Highs are we
1253.16s: above the 200-day EMA with an additional
1256.52s: two percent and then the relative
1258.62s: strength ratios so this is kind of just
1261.26s: like a cool little canceling tool for
1263.06s: specific stocks that you would run that
1264.56s: in and then I also have how correlated
1267.44s: is it to the Spy this uses different
1269.48s: time frames it's completely customizable
1271.22s: to what you want and then the relative
1272.90s: strength I also have this slaved against
1275.54s: the Spy so that's most of what I have on
1278.90s: my chart if you have any specific
1280.16s: questions in there let your boy now
1282.02s: happy to take a look but otherwise this
1284.72s: is a really cool platform I'm happy to
1287.12s: dive way more into detail there's a lot
1289.28s: of other stuff this just scratches the
1290.96s: surface we didn't get into watch lists
1293.12s: we didn't get into watch list columns we
1295.52s: didn't get into pretty much any of these
1297.14s: side panel tools which there's actually
1299.00s: a lot of really cool things that I like
1300.74s: to use in here so happy to do that if
1302.90s: you guys are interested in the future
1304.22s: but otherwise let me know what you
1306.32s: thought don't forget like subscribe
1308.42s: share with some friends we're trying to
1309.92s: grow out here we're coming up on 12K I'd
1312.14s: love to hit 15K by the end of the year
1313.82s: that's my goal be an outlier I'll see
1315.68s: you guys later
