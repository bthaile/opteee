0.00s: Oh boy, this is a hot topic, but we're going to dive right into it.
3.36s: The cost of defining your risk in zero DTE plays.
9.28s: A lot of people don't like this conversation because it starts to highlight the reality of things,
14.88s: but as you hopefully know, my goal isn't to persuade or dissuade anybody from anything.
21.44s: My goal is to share with you the objective reality of things and then let you make the decisions
27.68s: for yourself. So the goal of this video is to walk you through some different examples of
32.56s: undefined and defined risk zero DTE trades through very specifically picked markets so that you
40.64s: can see the bad and some of the good and then combined so that you can see what this all looks
46.32s: like and then at the end of the video, I'm going to share some concepts that you can use to help
51.12s: inform the way you structure these kinds of trades in the future. What's up everybody? Eric
56.32s: here. Welcome back to the outliers shout out to the Patreon family. Consider signing up and let's
60.80s: get straight to it. So real quick upfront recap together. Defined versus undefined risk trades,
67.20s: it is pretty simple. When we think about a defined risk trade in this context, we're going to look
72.48s: at short iron condors and this is a way for you to sell options to capitalize on variance risk
82.00s: premiums, which if you're unfamiliar with what that is, I'll throw a link in the notes below for
86.16s: you to check out. But when we're trading short premium zero DTE strategies, that's essentially what
93.92s: you are trying to capture variance risk premiums. Now the beautiful part about a short iron condor
100.56s: is that notice this there's defined risk both to the upside and the downside. This means that even
107.28s: if there's a massive move, you are cushioned yet you still this really nice big profit zone.
114.32s: That looks pretty good to me. But as with all things in trading, there are trade-offs which
120.08s: we'll get to in just a second. Now let's take a look at a different example which is going to be
126.72s: the short triangle. The profit zone on your short triangles typically will be wider if you have
133.04s: the same short delta. So in this case, both of these use short 20 delta in SPX. However, notice how
141.44s: both to the upside and to the downside, undefined risk. This is a problem for a lot of people. Not
147.28s: just because if your account size is too small that you can't handle taking on a position of that
151.76s: size, but then there's also the mental component of undefined risk that scares a lot of people.
157.44s: And rightfully so, if you want to exist as a trader for any meaningful duration of time, you need
162.32s: to be thoughtful about risk. And if you hear risk undefined, it's kind of a problem. But there
167.20s: are different things we can do to help cushion this a little bit and ideally to move people towards
173.60s: a healthier relationship with undefined risk strategies because we have to talk about what's going
179.60s: on here. As you may or may not know, I am a nerd and I'm continually looking for studies on
187.28s: markets in general. And this is a pretty new one. This is from 14 January 2024. And this looks
193.68s: at zero DTE options from six 2016 out to 2024. And I want to share a specific section of this with
203.44s: you that I've bookmarked, which is this zero DTE options offer a substantial variance risk premium.
210.96s: The exact thing that we're looking to trade. And if you're looking for more context on this whole
216.00s: zero DTE trading concept, I'll throw another video in the notes below that will give you a much
221.60s: broader landscape. We're here. We're kind of getting directly to a specific comparison that might
226.88s: confuse some folks if you're not familiar with the landscape. Then here it says with implied
232.16s: variance consistently higher than realized variance until settlement. This that's what variance
237.92s: risk premiums are. That's why there's a market here. However, the success of various strategies is
243.36s: not guaranteed. The other thing to note though is that some of these strategies have high
248.88s: volatility in skewed returns that are health expiration. So all of this is to say and you should
254.64s: absolutely take a look at this study. It's fantastic. It's one of my favorite recent studies on this
260.48s: as compared to the other one about analyzing the cost of zero DTE strategies. But in this case,
268.00s: the landscape is if you are selling this premium, you are providing liquidity, which is a utility
275.12s: to the market. And part of that is we are trying to capture the phenomenon that implied variance
283.12s: is higher on average than realized variance. Sometimes markets move. So if you get a big enough move,
289.36s: this can hurt really bad. So what I want to talk about now is an example to help us dive further
296.48s: into this. So here I look at one Jan 2022 to 31 December 2023. Why these two years? I wanted to pick
305.12s: actually a short timeframe that includes two extremes. 2022 was a pretty big down year about 20
311.84s: percent. And then 2023 was a decent up year up 23 percent. And the good part about that is if
317.76s: you look at those two years together 2023 was not a big enough up year to overcome the loss
325.44s: from 2022. So this gives you two beautiful views. You have a pretty big severe down year. And then
332.96s: you have a subsequent up year that is strong, but still not strong enough to overcome those two
339.12s: years combined in terms of an average return. If you had bought at the highs, how long I threw.
344.80s: So working down this side over here, we have a bunch of different things. And if you'll notice,
350.32s: I honed in on short calls and puts at a 20 delta. So a strangle. But then for this part of the sample,
357.60s: I'm showing you the iron condors at three different locations, long wings at five, 10 and 15
364.32s: delta. These are all entered at 12 PM Pacific time, 3 PM Eastern. So an hour before the close.
371.44s: You can tinker with the entry time and you'll see slightly different results. The point I want to
375.36s: highlight here more so is few things. First, notice the heighter the wings, so 20 delta and a 15 delta
383.28s: long. It had the worst overall P&L out of these three, a lower compound annual growth rate, a much
390.40s: better drawdown. You would expect that if you have less room to move, we would expect to lose less
396.40s: in total. So if you go down here to the max loss, it's only $775. Pretty light as compared to the
402.32s: 20 delta shorts, five delta longs, the max loss on that was 3145, quite a bit bigger. Now notice
409.68s: though, the expected return on these two outside samples, which is negative in the long run, which
416.08s: is problematic for the strategies. Now, so what is the cost? What is the cost of buying these wings?
423.12s: Let's take a look. If you had sold just the 20 delta short, tall and put all else the same,
431.28s: you would make $26,197 over the same time frame. Your compound annual growth rate goes from a high
439.60s: of 4.7 to 12.3. Your max drawdown is negative 9.8. This is still pretty damn bad. Average when portrayed
448.88s: is 56 bucks, so on and so forth. So you can see that by just getting rid of the wings and accepting
455.76s: the volatility in the returns, you in aggregate make way more money. Look at the max loss here though.
462.24s: 56, 57. That's a big max loss, depending on the size of your account. And if you're not capable of
469.20s: withstanding that kind of max loss on a single trade on a one lot, you have to find different
474.32s: ways to get innovative here. You can scale down because if you notice here, the max profit and the
479.36s: max loss both not touched on either of these. So what happens if we start to modulate that just a
485.60s: little bit? Well, if we take a look at a 200% and then a 300% max loss for the 20 delta strangle,
493.76s: notice how good the returns become. Our P&L grows from 26 to 36 max loss contracts from 5600 to
502.48s: 2,200. So what's going on here? We're cutting off the tails. If you take a look at the number of
507.52s: winning trades in this scenario, there's 358. Then if you take a look at the number of winning trades
511.84s: in this scenario, there's 344. So what this is telling me is that the difference between these two
517.12s: conditions is 14 trades that would have been profitable that we cut off using this max loss.
523.12s: You generally want to avoid that. But in doing so in this sample, we've so grossly decreased our
529.44s: max loss that in general on average, we're not cutting off so many trades that would go outside of
535.36s: our range and then back in that our average win per trade is actually very strong. And then 300% max
541.28s: loss brings us back down a little bit, but it's still better than the unmanaged P&L. So now you might
547.36s: be thinking, well, Eric, if we're managing the max loss, we should do that for dire and condors,
554.80s: sure, why not? It sucks. What's going on here? Buying these wings is very expensive. So even if you
565.52s: buy the wings, which would then manage your loss side of the equation, and then you apply
571.76s: management on top of that, you perform worse. That is a problem with using winged strategies.
578.72s: Now, in this case, you'll notice these are all 20 delta shorts, 15 delta longs. You can look at
584.72s: this across the gamut. It is going to negatively impact your return potential. In this case with
593.04s: the five delta long options, you would increase the overall profitability of this from $9,600,
600.40s: you would kick it up to 17,000, which is much better. But in the long run, that cost adds over time.
607.92s: None of this includes commissions, which wouldn't identically sway this either way. But the more
613.68s: important function here is the drag that you're adding to your returns. So you have to make choice.
619.52s: As a trader, you have to determine what function you're providing the market. If you think that
624.80s: you just get to sell options and you should just make money because you're selling, but then you
630.00s: want to buy wings to protect your position, you can do that. That means that we are placing a premium
636.24s: on our risk aversion and that's going to negatively impact our profitability. You can see in this
641.36s: case, the way that I typically lean, I prefer to simply use make it options. You can use max loss
648.48s: management. If you're so inclined, I think that's okay. Notice how the max profit is not managed
654.40s: in any of these. That's because that simply adds more transactions. And as you add taking a max
661.44s: profit, you'll notice the PNL on most of these decreases in efficacy. But if you're interested
666.88s: in seeing that, we could do another video that dives deep into this. So now let's talk about real
671.28s: quick, the application of this. What does all this mean? First thing, you have to define what your
675.92s: risk tolerance is, what market function are you performing? Then after you define that, you have
682.96s: to figure out what kind of trades fit your risk tolerance, understanding the trade offs there of.
688.72s: And again, especially for zero DTE trades where we don't experience overnight gap risk, I
695.84s: tend to be on this side. You want to interact with the positions as little as possible to reduce
701.44s: your cost. Overall, that is a killer. Again, that video I referenced earlier will dive deep into
707.04s: detail on how dangerous that can be. The cool part is you can optimize these even more considering
714.40s: 2022, which was an aggressive down year. So we don't have to cherry pick the results to create the
720.72s: outcome that we want that's in sample and out of sample, kind of making a combination of a statistical
725.84s: process. But you can come up with a pretty simple rule set when it comes to the X levels, SPX
731.68s: levels or trend to determine when you choose to enter versus when you choose not to enter. But
737.52s: without any of that, you still have strategies here that are double digit compound annual growth
744.00s: rates that survived during a pretty massive drawdown in 22 and performed just fine during the
750.64s: subsequent market rally in 23. Any questions? Let me know what should I test next? Throw it in the
758.08s: comments below. Like, subscribe, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
