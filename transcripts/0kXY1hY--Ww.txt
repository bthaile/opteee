0.00s: All of us traders are degenerates at heart, however, the goal of this video is to help some
7.00s: of my game stop people think about buying call options or really any option a little bit
13.36s: differently so that rather than putting on positions that magically vanish in a couple of days
18.48s: and all your money has gone, we might actually stand a chance at making some money out here
24.76s: because what we don't want is to be in the scenario of our friend and teak marketing
29.84s: who's down 99.68% with $32 left to go, super unfortunate.
35.84s: But who knows, they have some Apple options, expire in this week, they're pay off might
40.64s: be there.
41.64s: My guess is they're probably making a bunch of the mistakes I'm about to walk through
44.84s: with you guys.
45.84s: We're going to talk about kind of looking at options a little bit differently through the
49.52s: lens of these three things.
52.96s: Days, expiration, how long the contract lasts.
57.24s: The delta of the option, delta simply measures the rate of change of an options premium
64.72s: for every one dollar move in the underlying and then gamma which is simply the rate of
70.68s: change of delta.
73.04s: So I am not going to get super theoretical here.
75.64s: My goal is to keep this as practical as possible.
78.24s: So with that, let's get straight over into the platform and we're going to grab GameStop
84.64s: in dig right in.
86.68s: Okay.
87.88s: So the first thing to know is you notice the first thing on our list is picking DTE,
91.92s: Dase Taxpiration.
92.92s: What expiration makes the most sense?
95.24s: Here's the way to think about it.
97.00s: The further out in time you go, the more expensive, extrenzic value gets for options.
105.60s: Also, the slower gamma will move, which matters specifically for out of the money options.
113.28s: And I'll explain how.
115.00s: So that's the first thing.
116.88s: The further out in time you go, the more expensive the options get because there's more
121.08s: extrinsic value, gamma has a dampened effect.
126.00s: What's the benefit?
127.16s: Your trade now has a longer time to work.
131.92s: Although your theta decay will be higher in a gross dollar amount, your daily theta decay
138.96s: as a percent of the resulting premium will be less.
142.84s: So let's take a look at exactly what that means.
145.36s: If we go out here to 120 days to expiration and we look at really anything, let's find
152.20s: this 60 delta call right now in GameStop.
156.12s: So we can see this is gamma, this is theta.
160.84s: And I'm specifically focusing on the call options because I imagine that's probably what
164.72s: most of you guys are playing, but the same stuff generally applies to the put options as
169.64s: well.
170.64s: So if we look at these 60 delta calls right now, they have a 0.02 gamma.
176.68s: So that means for every one point move in the underlying delta is going to move by 0.02.
184.28s: Everything else remaining the same good old Latin saying setteress perabis.
188.84s: Now theta notice what theta is negative 0.03.
194.48s: This means as each day that passes, these options are going to lose a resense again,
201.84s: everything else remaining the same.
203.92s: A couple notes that are really important here.
207.60s: Options that are out of the money are all extrinsic value.
213.16s: Extrinsic value kind of is two components.
216.36s: First component is how much time the second component is volatility, how much volatility
222.76s: are we pricing in those options.
225.08s: So as you go further on time, the more extrinsic value you will have.
231.08s: As you go deeper in the money, your options will have more intrinsic value and less extrinsic
241.20s: value.
242.24s: They will be a higher delta.
244.16s: So what does all this mean?
246.16s: The very first juncture we need to cross is what expiration to pick.
250.96s: For me, I typically try to go at least greater than 60 days to expiration.
256.92s: The reason for that is option theta to k starts to really accelerate once we go within 60 days.
263.60s: So let's take a look at what this looks like again.
265.72s: 60 delta these have a 0.03 theta.
271.08s: Let's now go into 29 find a 60 delta.
274.40s: This is a 62 that's pretty close.
276.48s: Beta now is negative 0.07.
279.28s: What do you notice?
280.68s: The daily theta decay just skyrocketed going from 120 which was three cents into 29 days
288.84s: to expiration is double in change.
292.12s: Seven cents massive way higher.
295.20s: And also what's most important is if you think about your theta decay this seven cents
300.64s: on a percentage of the premium.
303.20s: These are trading for 460, 465 something like that.
307.16s: They're losing seven cents every single day.
309.72s: That's a much larger percentage of the total premium that's eroding on a daily basis.
315.36s: If we go again out here to the 120s, not only is the theta much lower for the 60s,
321.80s: it's again three, three cents, but look at the price of the options.
326.36s: They're much more expensive.
328.00s: So as a percentage, you're also losing way less of your total premium.
333.68s: So that's the expiration decision.
336.36s: To me, in general, it's kind of just easy.
339.60s: If you go at the very least, the very least greater than 30 days out, ideally 60 plus
345.56s: for me, most of my trades are 90 plus.
348.20s: But again, I trade these a little bit differently than most people.
351.64s: So it might not be a direct corollary.
353.72s: I'm just giving you some ballpark to go off of.
357.28s: Because we need to now talk about gamma.
361.16s: When we're buying options, a lot of times people will be lured into these really cheap,
367.64s: really far out of the money options.
370.00s: Like these 21 dunes that expire in one day and the 125s, where there's 113,000 open interest.
378.28s: That's not saying all those people entered today.
379.84s: They didn't, but a lot of people entered these.
382.64s: These are very far out of the money.
384.76s: So the reason why we care about gamma is because gamma tells us how fast we're going to
392.28s: see profit if we start getting a big move in our favor.
398.20s: Because if you remember, Delta tells us the rate of change of an option's premium.
402.24s: So in this case, if Gamestop moves $1 in our favor, this literally is going to move less
407.80s: than a penny.
409.40s: There's the Delta is so low in these options that it's going to be a third digit.
414.68s: You're not even going to see it.
416.48s: The other problem here is that as you get that first dollar move in your favor, gamma
421.92s: doesn't even start turning on.
423.64s: And what does that mean?
424.92s: Well, if we take a look here, something like a 15 Delta.
429.28s: Notice what the gamma is, 0.06.
431.16s: So that means that if you get a $1 move in your favor, these options are going to give you
435.88s: 15 cents or $15 because the multiplier for options is 100.
441.00s: 100.
441.92s: So you get 15 bucks, but something else happened along that.
445.76s: This 15 Delta just gains six more Delta.
450.84s: So now if you get another dollar move in your favor, instead of just seeing 15 cents,
455.80s: you now see 21 cents.
457.80s: And what do you notice?
460.36s: Options that are closer to at the money have much higher gamma.
466.20s: The other thing you'll notice is options that are closer in time have a much higher
471.40s: gamma.
472.40s: So this is 1 d to e.
473.80s: The at the money here is a 16 gamma.
476.24s: We go all the way out here to the 120s.
478.32s: We go to the at the money.
479.52s: The gamma is 0.02.
481.64s: Why is that simple?
484.32s: Options have to make a choice.
485.36s: As we get closer to expiration, it's either going to be in the money and have a Delta
489.40s: of one or it's going to be out of the money and have a Delta of zero.
493.72s: So, gamma tells us the rate of change of Delta.
496.72s: So that's why it gets so jacked up as we get closer to expiration.
502.64s: All of these options are in the process of making a big choice.
505.76s: Either in the money Delta of one out of the money Delta of zero.
509.08s: That's also why gamma is highest for at the money options.
512.60s: Because they're going to swing a ton.
515.00s: This is going to go from a 46 Delta either to a one Delta or to a zero Delta.
519.88s: That means it needs to be able to change a lot.
521.80s: That's what gamma is measuring.
523.40s: If you go to the super far out of the money options, they're not going to change much
527.24s: at all because they're as zero Delta.
529.24s: They're probably going to be as zero Delta.
531.08s: Meaning they're going to expire worthless.
532.80s: That's what this is.
534.28s: So taking this back to what we care about Delta is the next big selection.
540.88s: And I just gave you kind of a preamble on the way to think about Delta to a degree.
546.00s: Delta makes our options more expensive.
549.36s: The higher the Delta is, but you get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying.
556.24s: What that means is in this case, if GameStop goes up a dollar.
560.48s: In these 25s for example, you would have paid a dollar six something like that.
567.24s: So you pay your dollar here.
569.60s: You get a dollar move in the underlying.
571.68s: You get to see 54 cents of profit added to these.
576.80s: The premiums going to move by 54 cents.
579.36s: Whereas if you go super far out of the money, you get that same $1 move.
583.12s: You're only going to see a nickel as compared to 54 cents.
586.92s: What's the trade off here?
588.12s: Good question.
589.56s: As your Delta's are higher, the options are more expensive.
592.16s: Notice this one you have to buy for a dollar.
595.32s: This one you can buy for 11 cents.
598.52s: Now you might be thinking, well, what if I just buy a dollars worth of these?
602.44s: It's a great question.
603.48s: However, unfortunately, it doesn't work out that well.
606.56s: Let's take a look at an example.
608.56s: So these are a 64 Delta expiring in 2018.
615.28s: These are a 49 Delta expiring 28 units.
619.76s: Sorry.
621.04s: Let's take a look at creating the same size trade.
623.60s: These are trading for 53 cents.
625.32s: So to get them closer to that $3 mark, we'll do six of them.
629.36s: So now they're about the same.
630.84s: Let's take a look at some scenarios.
632.96s: If we look at the 60 Delta's, the 24 calls that we paid $3 for,
638.40s: and let's say we get a plus two standard deviation move.
641.20s: You're going to make 326 bucks.
643.64s: If we compare that to the six of the 49's,
648.20s: and we get that same move, you're going to get 335 bucks.
651.68s: So what do you notice right out of the gate?
654.48s: At the same size, you put on the same size position overall.
659.28s: These make just a little bit more on a two standard deviation move,
664.60s: which the vast majority of the time you're not going to see that.
667.36s: That's a low probability move.
669.96s: Remember, standard bell curve, 68.7% of data falls within,
675.68s: one standard deviation, 95% of data within two.
679.28s: So that's both sides, by the way.
682.08s: So it's essentially a 2.5% chance of getting that moving
685.48s: your favorite give or take.
687.20s: So it's just important to know that even if you think about putting
691.52s: the same size total cost position on and a much lower Delta option,
695.88s: you still need a really big move in order to even catch up
700.44s: to getting a higher Delta option right out of the gate.
703.52s: So what does this mean?
706.04s: Well, we know then that if we go further out of the money,
709.76s: our options are going to move less due to both Delta and Gamma.
713.48s: If they're further in the money, your Gamma will slow down
716.36s: because you're already near one Delta.
718.96s: And once you're at a one Delta, you get a $1 move for every $1
723.16s: move in the underlying.
724.08s: It's essentially just leveraged stock.
726.84s: So you have to figure out the correct balance for you.
730.00s: And I'll tell you what I typically look for.
732.28s: When I'm going out again, at least 30 days, preferably 60
737.36s: plus maybe these 57s are fine, something like that,
740.92s: I will look starting at the money.
744.32s: The downside, they're more expensive.
746.72s: They're more expensive by going further out in time.
748.72s: They're more expensive because they're a higher Delta.
751.28s: So I will structure a position that has a base position
756.40s: using these kinds of options that are at least 60 Delta plus
760.84s: and have a little bit of time to work.
762.96s: Even if I'm not expecting to hold them for 57 days,
766.48s: I'm typically not.
767.80s: I just don't want to pay that much in daily,
770.76s: faded a K by coming in super close in time
774.12s: and having the majority of my position to K away.
777.36s: So if we go all the way out here, again, to these 120s,
780.00s: I'm losing three cents a day by going slightly in the money here.
783.68s: I'm going to pay more upfront for that,
785.32s: but I'm not expecting to lose all of it.
787.12s: I'm actually expecting to recapture most of it.
790.16s: So that's the way I think about it.
792.04s: I'm going to go again, little further out in time,
794.52s: slightly higher Delta.
795.96s: Now the last thing to add is you can add what I call
798.76s: the kicker options to amplify the position.
801.84s: So what that could look like is let's say in this scenario,
805.40s: I pick that further out in time option
808.00s: that's deeper in the money.
809.08s: This is the base position.
811.68s: And I say, okay, well, I'm really bullish for some reason.
815.40s: I think the stock I'm looking at is going to fly off the handle.
819.00s: So let me add some closer in time,
824.00s: further out of the money options
826.64s: that have the ability to appreciate a lot.
829.36s: This is why Gamma is so important
831.64s: because by going closer in time, let's say two weeks out,
835.56s: I can find things that have really high Gamma
838.44s: on a relative basis.
840.08s: So that means if I start getting in accommodating
842.36s: move in my favor, the position can start to compound massively.
847.04s: Because when we compare low Delta to high Delta's,
850.68s: high Delta trades, they don't have the same percent returns,
854.12s: meaning they don't compound as much,
856.12s: but you can make more money on a gross dollar amount
859.52s: than the further out of the money options.
861.92s: So again, we're at another trade off.
864.72s: So to summarize all of that,
867.08s: these are the three things you have to keep in mind
869.08s: when you're buying options, Delta.
871.28s: How far out in time are you willing to go?
872.92s: How much time do you want to trade to have?
875.56s: The more time you give it, the more expensive it becomes.
878.32s: Delta, the higher the Delta,
879.76s: the better dollar for dollar move, you're going to get,
882.12s: the more expensive the options are going to be.
884.16s: The slower your thated K is going to be,
886.72s: the less your money will compound.
889.88s: Gamma, the closer in time you are and the closer to at the money,
895.04s: the higher your gamma is going to be.
898.08s: You want to have some exposure to Gamma,
901.20s: but if you're super close in time and you're out of the money,
904.92s: you are fighting so much thated K as a percentage of your position
909.52s: that it's going to erode away to nothing.
911.72s: And to drive that final point home,
913.52s: if we look at this one, not even this one,
915.20s: let's look at the ATTE and we look at something like this,
919.52s: the 37's.
921.32s: These are still a 20 Delta almost, 17 Delta, like pretty high.
925.56s: But if you look at the theta, it's 14 cents.
928.48s: These options cost 70 cents, something like that.
932.64s: So of that 70-cent position you put on,
935.36s: you're losing 14 cents every single day
939.80s: that you don't get to move in your favor
942.00s: until they essentially run out of money,
943.84s: until they decay into nothing.
945.72s: So you have to be really cognizant of theta to K.
948.36s: You can decrease that by going further out in time,
951.72s: by gaining a little bit more Delta.
953.68s: It's a little more expensive up front,
955.32s: but something worth trying.
957.36s: If you have any questions, let me know.
958.76s: Be an outlier.
959.60s: See you guys later.
