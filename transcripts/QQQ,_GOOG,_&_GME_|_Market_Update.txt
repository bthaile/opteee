0.68s: the wall of red little bit of blood
2.80s: leting out there today let's talk about
5.76s: the market I want to walk through high
8.16s: level overview of what this is and how
12.04s: to think about it because there are a
14.96s: lot of similarities with what I'm seeing
18.04s: driving this kind of selloff as you
21.16s: could tell a lot of these bigger boxes
24.84s: that happen to also be quite red fall
27.68s: within Tech so this this does not
30.92s: surprise me if we go over here to the
33.52s: NASDAQ to get a little closer and see
36.20s: what's happening we had Google report
39.52s: their earnings and it wasn't as good as
43.32s: the market would have liked to have seen
45.16s: they're losing ad Revenue it's slowing
47.24s: down and things of that nature we're
50.64s: getting this sense that potentially a
53.00s: lot of this AI craze might be slowing
56.60s: down a little bit so if we take a look
58.04s: at
58.68s: Nvidia you can see that they're
61.40s: definitely down over 6.8% today so and
66.32s: it's still uh kind of hovering right
68.68s: around
69.52s: 114 so what this tells me is not that
73.04s: the sky is crashing that the world is
74.68s: over this just kind of tells me that
76.72s: things got priced a little frothy and
79.84s: now some of that is being blown off the
82.16s: top as people are taking some profits
83.84s: here now this is something you have to
85.40s: keep a close eye on because these kinds
87.80s: of moves while not any that's make me
91.08s: nervous yet they can become something
94.04s: that makes me nervous so what I'm
96.88s: looking for is any sort of continuation
98.72s: meaningful continuation to the downside
101.28s: because when I look across stuff like
102.96s: this down here our net highs lows for a
106.60s: general breadth indicator you can see
109.16s: that this this doesn't look all that bad
112.00s: we do see net highs and within the
115.96s: NASDAQ we are seeing a little bit of
119.20s: acceleration
120.68s: on Gross lows and a little bit of
123.32s: deceleration in Gross Highs but we're
125.88s: still maintaining net highs so what this
128.16s: tells me is that there are a few names
130.56s: like Nvidia that are really leading this
133.36s: downward movement and again the market
136.84s: got so exuberant about trying to price
139.40s: in AI this is one of the things that
141.56s: leads to opportunities in markets is
143.60s: that it's not a
146.20s: instantaneous ingestion of accurate
149.24s: pricing Bas on new information so you
151.80s: can see that there's this big big rally
155.28s: essentially most of the year if we Zoom
156.76s: this out to a year to date look at what
158.16s: this has done it's gone from 47 on a a
160.80s: split adjusted basis to 140 it's a
164.56s: tremendous move and a lot of this is
167.40s: predicated on people not wanting to miss
169.52s: the AI rally train they think that
171.48s: they're getting in late and you can see
173.68s: where most people got in year to date
175.48s: was down here kind of at the 89 A2
177.96s: handle but if we Zoom this in you'll
180.24s: notice that this will start to scoot up
182.56s: as more and more people are entering the
184.68s: party late and that causes a problem
187.80s: because there's a lot of people that
189.68s: entered the party in here that aren't
192.20s: necessarily really happy with things are
194.60s: going right and this is this is a tale
197.56s: as old as time itself in the markets
200.84s: where people just dog pile into things
204.04s: hoping that it's going to go up and it
206.88s: doesn't necessarily always mean it's
208.68s: going to continue as especially when you
211.28s: price in stuff that aggressively
213.28s: essentially everything has to execute
214.72s: near perfectly in order for there to be
217.04s: no issues no Market push back so none of
220.56s: this surprises me it seems almost
223.76s: overdue in my opinion but I mean who am
227.08s: I to say when it's due I'm just a dude
229.80s: but this is just something I've been
231.72s: thinking about for some time now and
233.20s: it's something that's been on my radar
234.56s: especially as you start seeing the
235.68s: moving averages all start to get super
237.60s: congested like this yeah you got to be
240.40s: careful what the risk is what that boils
242.20s: down to so that's broadly what I'm
244.40s: seeing across the Market within the tech
246.80s: sector for a little while the Russell
248.52s: was kind of the uh only little bit of
250.72s: strength we saw it was actually up for a
253.28s: little bit today and then it just joined
256.92s: that downward party move which funny
260.40s: enough I was stopped out yesterday after
263.32s: the close so I was flat in here although
267.20s: I really have been enjoying the rut
268.88s: trade so I wanted wanteded to get back
270.28s: in but today was more of just a a watch
273.48s: kind of day so that's actually what I'm
274.76s: doing right now setting some alerts to
276.40s: keep my eyeballs on it as it starts to
278.04s: move outside of these range-bound phases
280.36s: here hopefully continuing to the upside
282.92s: it still technically is showing ever so
285.12s: slight moderate strength compared to the
286.76s: S&P but the NASDAQ is really what's
289.40s: driving us down and then as I look
291.44s: across the sectors it's generally blood
293.96s: in the street we have XLE which is
296.24s: hanging in there just a little bit
297.52s: better than some of the others and xlu
299.72s: who's actually enjoying a little bit of
301.04s: an upd here and then XLV an even bigger
304.20s: upd so if you're looking for areas of
307.08s: strength that continue to persist these
309.96s: this is exactly what I do and these are
311.44s: the kind of products that I start
313.84s: looking at that tend to be a bit more
315.68s: defensive in nature and they tend to
318.32s: perform pretty well in that format so
322.28s: that's kind of the the broad Market
324.44s: scenario here now I do want to Pivot
326.80s: over take a quick look at GameStop it's
329.72s: another generally quiet day so when I
332.76s: look at this a big thing I'm trying to
334.68s: keep an eye on is how is price behaving
337.04s: especially as we get near this point of
338.60s: control and we're now firmly below it we
341.32s: actually just closed
343.12s: below the 50-day moving average so I
346.28s: don't love that I actually adjusted my
348.00s: position because of the movement today I
350.08s: still have a small position on but I've
351.88s: paired down a lot of it and it's now a
354.68s: waiting game for me as you can see I
356.00s: have a couple alerts set that I want to
357.56s: see how it behaves Beyond a few
360.16s: different levels so the first this one
362.52s: has two alerts kind of baked in there's
364.00s: one right there and then one right at
366.28s: the bottom of this like right there just
368.08s: for context and so far it's just kind of
373.24s: slowly Meandering but not in necessarily
376.80s: a positive direction we did see an
378.88s: expansion in volume today but the
381.40s: majority of it being sale volume so you
384.56s: can see that again represented in the
387.00s: candle that you see it's just kind of
388.36s: this relative on this scale a larger red
393.84s: candle so looks like people are selling
397.20s: I I mean I Unwound some of my position
398.84s: today so I'm I'm part of that I still
401.84s: have Again part of the position on Via
404.32s: shares and I do have some short calls
405.88s: against it still I took the short calls
408.48s: from yesterday down because they paid
409.88s: out today and I I put some new stuff out
412.36s: a little closer in time because it
413.92s: doesn't look like I'm adding my options
415.48s: positions as quickly as I thought I
417.32s: might have been which is part of how
419.84s: this whole thing goes so let's take a
422.56s: look at what we're seeing from a volume
424.44s: perspective I see 167,000 calls versus
428.68s: 70,000 puts so by all Accords a quiet a
434.16s: quiet day typically we're seeing volume
436.84s: on the call side over 200,000 easy what
439.64s: side about that most of the call volume
443.36s: is in 26th July very usual and then we
446.92s: are seeing more and more and more
449.12s: position building out into this 16 a
452.48s: expiration cycle which again that does
454.20s: not surprise me I would continue to
455.84s: expect to see that Trend actually if we
457.92s: take a quick look at the breakdown
459.48s: between that 7,800 in this front
462.52s: expiration 34,000 so about half of it
465.08s: are out in 16
466.80s: OG and then two a is 29,000
471.80s: calls and then N9 is super quiet 9,000
475.32s: to 3,000 calls to puts respectively so
477.84s: not much happening in a N9 o yet so my
480.40s: guess is this we'll still continue to
482.52s: see positions being built out in 16 Aug
484.84s: slowly we will continue to favor the
486.76s: front expiration so then as this 26 July
489.88s: starts to come up and pass then it'll
491.48s: probably rotate into the two a into the
493.60s: nine OG but I still think over that
496.04s: entire time frame you're going to see
497.28s: the 16 Aug building out more and more
498.92s: and more that's just so far what I'm
501.40s: seeing now from a general trade
505.44s: perspective there are a couple positions
507.68s: that came through that were a little bit
509.04s: larger in size but not a bunch so I'm
512.92s: still seeing relatively quiet markets
516.60s: here so this is looking at both bid and
519.64s: offer for both calls and puts for today
522.92s: and I just want to see like what's the
524.12s: premium that's trading and it's all 100
525.96s: under $100,000 so nothing there that I
529.04s: would highlight as of supreme interest
531.52s: to me just yet as you can tell I'm here
533.84s: keeping an eyeball on it when I start
535.48s: looking at stuff like this and I decide
537.04s: that I want to keep looking at it I'm
538.36s: gonna keep looking at it so that's where
540.36s: I'm at I'm waiting to see minute changes
544.00s: and this is actually kind of useful for
546.32s: the way that the market is setting up
547.64s: now because it gets to a point where
549.76s: kind of the the premium the volume the
552.48s: size of the positions we see putting on
554.32s: they're they're all kind of smaller here
556.88s: so then when you see bigger positions
559.40s: they stick out like sore thumbs you can
560.92s: see them clear as day so that is a
563.12s: really big benefit of the market here
565.40s: slowing down a little bit specifically
567.20s: for gme getting a little bit more quiet
569.12s: so
570.44s: so far that's what I got as always if
573.16s: there's anything you want me to take a
574.40s: look at let me know I'm doing a live
576.76s: stream on Saturday about GameStop my boy
579.76s: Newton is unable to make this week he'll
581.60s: be back next week so this one is just
583.72s: going to be me looking through the stock
585.16s: more in depth really trying to pick up
586.52s: more of the history so I'm going to be
587.64s: going through roaring Kitty old videos
589.88s: posts and stuff like that so I'm
591.16s: actually going to lean on the chat
592.24s: pretty heavily to help me you know
594.32s: direct my attention to the stuff you
595.72s: guys think I should be learning about
596.84s: next so if you're able to join it's at
598.84s: 5:00 p.m. same exact thing we've been
599.96s: doing the last few weeks so be an
602.36s: outlier see you guys later
