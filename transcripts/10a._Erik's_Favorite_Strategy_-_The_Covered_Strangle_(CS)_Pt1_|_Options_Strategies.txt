0.26s: everybody Eric here this is a lesson
3.77s: I've really been looking forward to and
5.36s: what I want to share is my favorite
7.67s: strategy I haven't gotten into it yet
10.10s: because I was trying to build a baseline
11.75s: of other contents what people can you
14.78s: know connect with different it's not
17.90s: complicated but simpler approaches I
20.03s: guess I would say because this takes a
22.49s: lot of little things I do in different
24.74s: strategies and it pulls into one thing
26.51s: so this strategy it's called a cache
28.88s: secured strangle the wheelbarrow the
31.52s: Robo there's all sorts of other terms
34.49s: for it but my my mentor always called it
39.26s: the cache secure strangle so that's what
40.91s: I call it and essentially this is
44.83s: probably I would argue 80 85 percent of
49.73s: my trades I do it all the time and the
52.31s: reason being is because the trade
55.15s: rewards good management approach and it
59.48s: doesn't care quite as much about being
61.85s: directionally correct which is great
64.70s: because I don't try to pick direction I
66.56s: always figure it's a fool's errand over
68.48s: the long run
69.43s: it's a 50/50 chance so I like the idea
73.31s: of focusing more on management and
75.35s: creating my traders edge through
77.81s: effective management of the trade so
80.56s: couple notes my one of my mentors
83.93s: actually taught me this strategy well he
86.60s: didn't teach me directly he shares it
88.28s: and I kind of like started pulling it
90.68s: down but the the main thing is he is a
94.01s: very specific approach that he uses
95.75s: because he uses it for income whereas I
98.69s: use it to grow my portfolio so a
100.58s: slightly different approach in the way
103.13s: that we go about it but the vast
104.78s: majority of stuff that I share it's
106.82s: based on what he's taught me and I feel
108.92s: it's important to give that disclaimer
110.15s: because this isn't all my own thought
112.37s: where this is honestly you know 40 to 60
115.97s: percent his stuff and the reason that is
118.97s: is I literally probably spent two years
121.10s: picking this strategy apart
123.29s: he's been trading for a really really
125.39s: long time you know he's older in his 70s
128.21s: now and he's been trading essentially
130.01s: his whole life so I've known you know
132.68s: the mentor I'm referring to
133.94s: over a decade now and I spent at least
136.49s: two years when I first started learning
137.93s: herring into this strategy so that I
140.69s: could truly understand what the heck it
143.06s: is and essentially how he does it and
145.52s: how I needed to do it so I know it's a
148.64s: little bit longer intro than some of the
149.93s: other sorry but this is the cash secure
153.44s: triangle let's jump in go over to the
154.97s: main screen here and start working
156.47s: through it so okay first and foremost I
159.74s: gotta slide this over a little bit so we
161.48s: can see the notes cool and let's run
164.78s: through it the cash secured strangle
166.82s: what is a cash secured strangle very
169.22s: simply or we are going this cell to open
176.11s: puts we're gonna sell to open puts in
178.98s: something and obviously I have criteria
182.02s: for all of these I'm just trying to show
184.00s: kind of the flow of the trade so that we
186.55s: have a good outline so we're gonna sell
188.23s: the open puts one of two things is going
190.72s: to happen we're either going to stay out
194.08s: of the money and just close this
196.06s: position and sell another play or we're
199.51s: gonna wind up in the money and need to
201.94s: manage this trade so there's kind of two
204.40s: ways we can go about managing this trade
206.44s: the first way is we can work on rolling
210.55s: or we can allow assignment
216.57s: now if we roll out theirs again I'll get
220.23s: into all the rolling stuff but
221.64s: essentially it no matter what role it's
223.29s: gonna involve rolling out in some
224.85s: capacity whether it's out at the same
226.35s: strike out and down I'll add out in
229.23s: adding units out in taking units away
231.63s: like said all different flavors of
233.49s: rolling but this is one strategy now if
236.61s: we get assigned
238.96s: we're gonna break this down again and
241.08s: then what we're gonna do is sell to open
244.72s: a call on the stock so this is we're
247.69s: going to be sign stock here or the
250.06s: underlying whatever it is but we're
251.41s: going to be long shares of something so
254.38s: what we're going to do is we're going to
255.28s: sell a call against those shares
260.13s: and then we're actually going to sell to
262.05s: open an additional put so this is why
265.47s: it's a strangle in a cash secured or a
267.39s: coverage strangle is because we have a
270.33s: covered call right so we're long shares
272.67s: and we're selling calls against it
274.08s: that's a covered call then we have a
276.06s: cash secured put again so this is
278.10s: designed to take on more shares if we
281.13s: want so that is also cash secured but
284.37s: notice it's also a call and a put calls
287.19s: and puts in the same you know expiration
289.95s: whatever it's essentially a strangle but
293.13s: we have the shares to cover the call
294.99s: side and then we have the capital to
297.60s: cover assignment on the put side that's
300.24s: why it's a cash secured strangle so
303.95s: again just working through this scenario
306.09s: one of two things is going to happen on
308.19s: the covered call side our call is either
311.01s: going to be out of the money and we're
313.47s: just going to sell another or it's going
316.23s: to be in the money
318.55s: which we're going to be assigned
320.88s: and then we're gonna lose this shares so
323.04s: that means that this part of the trade
324.60s: will fall off and then we just go back
328.59s: to this step up here that's it so again
332.46s: quick recap we're gonna sell it put one
334.71s: of two things is going to happen we're
336.78s: either gonna be out of the money and
337.68s: just collect capital or we're gonna be
339.60s: in the money if we're in the money
341.73s: we can choose to roll or allow
343.29s: assignment if we roll we're just gonna
346.11s: continue to manage the position up here
348.30s: if we take assignment
349.92s: now we're gonna be long shares and sell
352.11s: a call against it and sell an additional
355.14s: put this put over here is gonna follow
359.07s: this structure and then this covered
362.07s: call just follows this structure the
363.87s: cover call is either going to be out of
365.01s: the money we're just gonna collect the
366.06s: credit and that's it or it's gonna be
368.49s: assigned and it'll be taken away at some
370.26s: point in the future that's it that's all
373.11s: there is to it so each piece of this I
376.35s: will absolutely admit has specific
379.91s: management kind of along each step again
383.52s: if you'll remember what I said at the
385.02s: beginning of this video it's all about
386.73s: management so there's a lot in this
388.46s: because of that I'm gonna have two parts
390.99s: to this video I'm gonna go over the
393.42s: trade itself the nuts and bolts most of
396.60s: them at least then I like to follow and
398.13s: then I'm going to do a second video and
400.23s: actually work through an entire trade so
403.29s: that we can see what it looks like in
404.40s: practical application so let's get into
407.64s: what this thing looks like
409.46s: so first let's kind of talk about this
412.65s: setup as I like to call it this is I
417.81s: can't do these backwards so forgive me
420.48s: that's not too bad it's weird but
422.91s: essentially these are the underlyings I
424.59s: look like look at sorry
430.74s: so when I'm looking to sell and
435.05s: establish a cash secured put with the
437.88s: intention of potentially turning into a
439.95s: cash secured strangle I want to make
442.62s: sure the product I'm selling a put on is
445.23s: something I like because if you remember
447.51s: as part of that management tree at some
450.60s: point I'm I could own the underlying I
453.39s: could be long shares I don't want to be
455.22s: long share something I don't like so
457.83s: that's why I typically look at things
460.05s: that pay a dividend if I'm in it for a
461.91s: long time I want to collect a dividend
463.53s: is most know who have followed any of my
466.95s: videos I'm very passionate about ETFs
469.41s: they limit a lot of risk offer good
472.29s: returns so I like ETFs a lot and then
476.16s: sometimes I will use it for growth
477.93s: places well kind of speculative trades
480.15s: that I would otherwise be long stock but
484.11s: I just want to get paid a little bit to
485.85s: do it so in general I'm gonna look
489.93s: within the S&P 500 if I'm trading an
492.54s: individual underlying if I'm trading ETF
495.33s: so I'm gonna use some sort of index or
496.77s: sector ETF and then for growth plays
499.35s: those are more speculative typically a
501.39s: smaller allocation that would follow my
503.22s: speculative approach I tend to like to
507.06s: see things with that least a 25% IV rank
510.06s: and I have a video on IV IV rank why
513.12s: it's important higher IV more premium so
515.97s: that's the primary reason their
517.23s: liquidity is so important I like to see
522.14s: narrow bid-ask spreads in the options
524.79s: chains in easy filters at least a
528.72s: million shares traded a day on the stock
530.94s: if it doesn't have that there's a good
532.56s: chance the option liquidity is not going
534.69s: to be good I do like to use price
537.63s: extremes if I can so that's where I use
540.42s: linear regressions and moving averages
542.40s: to help me identify things that could be
545.85s: at some at some sort of price extreme
548.00s: which I'll get into more kind of on the
550.77s: second lesson when I am actively looking
553.17s: for something or showing you a trade but
555.80s: in short if I'm selling a you know a
559.74s: cash secured put I don't want to sell
561.78s: something that's New York or
563.43s: all time highs and if I do it's going to
565.11s: be a small position that kind of thing
566.85s: and it's the same thing with the moving
568.65s: averages if I'm trading something that
570.24s: I'm potentially going to be long I don't
573.12s: want to trade something that's below the
575.33s: 150 day or below the 50-day moving
578.13s: averages simply because those tend to
580.89s: have more chopped to the downside when
584.13s: I'm establishing the position I look to
585.78s: capture at least a 1% return on capital
587.97s: and we'll get into what that looks like
591.21s: a little bit later I essentially only
593.67s: look for weeklies at this point if the
595.56s: the product I'm trading doesn't have
597.09s: weekly options unless it's some sort of
599.55s: growth play that I really like
601.35s: I won't trade it and the reason being is
603.21s: because weekly options open up so many
605.25s: more management opportunities to us that
608.31s: products without weeklies do not that
611.28s: it's worth every single time for me to
613.59s: just find something with weeklies
614.79s: there's plenty of stuff that I like that
617.37s: has weeklies now the other big metric is
622.73s: you know the typical days to expiration
625.26s: and when I manage the trades and we'll
629.64s: get into management a little bit later
631.02s: but in general I open these up 14 to 50
636.90s: somewhere in that range 14 days to
638.79s: expiration 250 depending on what I'm
641.31s: trying to do but if I open up a trade
645.15s: that's longer than 20 days to expiration
647.25s: I always manage it around 20 days once
650.64s: it gets to that mark and the reason for
653.46s: that is because if I open up something
655.50s: longer than 20 days to expiration it
657.45s: means I am expecting to collect Veda
659.61s: this is more of a theta play and I'm
662.19s: trying to reduce my overall risk on the
664.32s: table so once it gets within 20 days to
668.70s: expiration that's when we see gamma risk
670.56s: starting to increase more rapidly and
673.19s: again you can review my video on on
676.05s: options Greeks if you need a refresher
679.32s: on that but that that's exactly why I
681.93s: like to manage around 20 days to
683.40s: expiration because gamma starts to
684.90s: increase around then
686.76s: now one key highlight is once he gets to
689.73s: 20 days to expiration is a decision
691.50s: point am i interested in rolling yes or
694.41s: no if I want to roll it's typically
697.20s: gonna happen around 20 days to
698.52s: expiration if I'm willing to allow
700.83s: assignment then I will allow it to go
704.10s: within that 20 days to expiration window
707.45s: so with that being said let's talk about
712.02s: how we go about setting up these trades
715.16s: first of all one of the most important
718.02s: steps with this trade is allocation you
721.35s: have to allocate for the trade the
723.96s: reason being I say this all the time is
726.09s: I prefer to be able to sell personally
728.94s: at least four puts
732.81s: the reason for that is if I sell a 20
736.59s: strike and then I get assigned at 20 and
740.25s: the stock is now trading at 15 I might
743.34s: not be able to sell a call at my basis
745.68s: and collect anything so sometimes the
748.26s: best strategy instead of selling a call
750.24s: at that point in time is to wait and
752.97s: just sell another put maybe at the 12
756.24s: strike which is below the current price
757.86s: of the underlying then let's say I get
759.99s: assigned again then now all of a sudden
763.20s: my basis becomes the average between
766.02s: these two and it's not gonna be all the
767.61s: way up at 20 I'll be somewhere in the
770.07s: middle and then I'll start to keep up or
773.58s: at least stay closer to the current
775.71s: price of the underlying first and then
777.42s: second more importantly I'll get back to
780.03s: break-even faster because if these two
783.36s: cost average and let's just say you know
787.77s: that this because typically I wouldn't
790.65s: necessarily sell the same number of Lots
792.72s: that's why I'm not just going for the
794.07s: mid here sometimes I'll have like two
796.17s: Lots here and then maybe add one lot
797.97s: here so real it's 300 total shares 200
800.46s: at that price 100 at this price but
803.61s: again just for the the sake of an
806.55s: example let's say that it is 16
808.80s: something like that now what that means
812.10s: is instead of being hung up at 2016's
816.36s: now my basis I do have more shares on
818.43s: however I once it hits 16 I'm at my
822.42s: breaking vise needing it to get back to
825.00s: 20 so that's why a virgin in keeping
828.09s: capital to add to the trade is so so so
830.73s: important that's why it's the first one
832.68s: on this list so that's part of again
836.64s: going back to this concept of management
838.32s: being key this is why and I just
841.11s: realized I'm ready 14 minutes into this
842.61s: video I'm sorry it's gonna be a long so
844.83s: I'm packing in a lot of metrics so first
849.72s: off allocations super important next up
852.21s: I have a certain Delta that I will pick
856.98s: for my initial short put and I have a
859.65s: certain amount of initial establishment
862.50s: I will allow and it's all based on the
865.59s: percent off of all
866.52s: time highs so we already reviewed the
868.89s: expiration piece so I'll skip over that
870.48s: now let's go down to this this little
872.61s: chart I made for you this is where I'm
875.25s: gonna enter the short put and then this
878.13s: is how much I'm gonna allow on the
881.34s: initial trade so let's say I'm trading
883.65s: something and I allocate $50,000 that
887.94s: means that if I see something that's 50%
890.64s: off all-time highs I will allow myself
893.73s: to use 90% of that if I see something
897.36s: that's in this range I'll allow myself
899.01s: to use something around 70 now I want to
901.53s: be very very clear these are guidelines
903.39s: I can I can use my brain at any point
908.49s: during this and adjust as I see
911.31s: necessary but the reason why I highlight
914.67s: the fact that I have metrics here is
917.61s: because especially when you're first
919.68s: starting knowing what to look for is so
921.72s: helpful but because I've been doing this
923.97s: for a very long time not even very long
925.92s: that's a little dramatic but I've been
927.03s: doing it for a while now 13 years and I
930.18s: allow myself to have creative license
932.58s: with it because I trust my judgment
934.65s: because I have history to prove it but
937.05s: when you're first starting out having
938.91s: metrics that are based on some sort of
942.86s: rationale is super important
946.30s: so the same thing with the Delta the
950.08s: high the closer we are to all-time highs
952.38s: the lower the Delta I allow myself to
955.96s: sell I never want to go below a 16 Delta
959.11s: unless I'm doing a different style trade
960.97s: because then the risk to reward isn't a
963.31s: great compromise now if we're really far
966.64s: off time off all-time highs I'll even go
969.73s: all the way as far as in the money but
971.83s: typically if you notice the one
973.39s: connecting file between all of these
975.31s: different percentages is this guy right
977.17s: here dirty I sell 30 Delta all the time
980.11s: that's because there's a 70% it's a 70%
983.02s: chance trade that it works in my favor
985.05s: and I'm good with that that overall
987.91s: probability so this is going to be the
990.67s: first part next I'm gonna share the
993.55s: management I apply for the cash secured
996.25s: strangle and then there will even be a
997.78s: third segment where I'm gonna go over an
1000.51s: actual example so that we can see it in
1002.85s: practice again this is a long long
1005.43s: segment because this is my bread and
1006.99s: butter this is what I do so there's a
1009.39s: lot that I put into it so I hope you you
1013.02s: don't understand why the videos are
1014.46s: lengthy but it's packing as much value
1017.07s: as I can so next up will be management
1019.32s: and then a actual example of a trade all
1022.29s: right talk to her buddy later
