0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.76s: The next car chat segment is more or less directed towards kind of the younger investors,
9.80s: but I really do think it applies to everybody anyways, but nonetheless, it really is something
16.92s: that as I reflect on it, it's stuff that I wish I thought about a little bit more when
25.56s: I was starting off.
28.12s: For those of you that don't know, I started investing pretty young and that's a great thing.
34.56s: It gives you more time, more exposure to the market.
38.44s: All of that is good stuff.
40.64s: Now, one of the things that people don't widely talk about is some of the downsides of
47.76s: starting early and I found that, honestly, there's a lot of them.
52.16s: It's not as easy as just start young and then you'll be good, you'll benefit.
57.84s: It's just not how it works, especially if you want to be an active investor.
61.36s: If you're a passive investor, I can see that.
63.88s: But if you're actively investing, it's really not so much the case and it's important
68.28s: to kind of understand that.
69.84s: I say that because not everybody is dramatic.
75.48s: Most folks who are financially savvy will encourage people to invest and start young.
82.24s: Good, that's a good start.
84.68s: The problem with it is without good direction, that early start can just perpetually set
93.04s: you back and that's the bad part of it.
96.68s: A lot of younger traders do not think through what they're doing and essentially they
103.92s: just start losing money.
106.52s: When you lose money early on, you're really starting to take your future wealth away from
112.20s: yourself and losing some money is natural.
115.68s: It's going to happen to anybody who's starting to invest.
118.40s: But there's got to be a line in the sand somewhere where you realize that you're being
121.96s: counterproductive.
124.76s: I wanted to run through a couple things that really, I guess I would call it, it fights
130.20s: to myself if I were to sit my younger self down that's first starting and really, I guess
141.72s: that would apply to other folks who are younger.
145.56s: When I started at 17, the very first thing that I would tell myself is learn to take paper
152.64s: trading seriously.
154.52s: I know that it's a pain point for a lot of folks.
157.16s: It's very difficult to take paper trading seriously for this reason or that reason.
163.24s: When I look back at it, if you can't find the discipline to take paper trading seriously,
169.28s: you're going to have a hard time with most of this shit.
172.64s: That's one of the very first things I would tell myself is learn to take paper trading
175.88s: seriously because the only thing it's going to do is save you money.
181.80s: It will allow you to get most of the big kinks out of your approach without you having
188.52s: a fucking pay for them.
191.12s: To me, that's really big.
193.60s: That's an important fucking thing because especially when we're starting, most of us have limited
198.92s: capital and you really can't afford to just kind of piss it away.
206.40s: That's the very first thing.
208.12s: Learn to take paper trading seriously.
210.76s: The next piece of advice that I would give myself is one that I actually reiterate pretty
216.28s: frequently and it's that the money I am trading with is not going to be the source of my
224.72s: future wealth.
226.40s: That's something I completely missed the fucking train on.
230.00s: I don't know.
231.00s: I guess that I thought that I was going to be able to aggressively grow that money to
234.32s: start drawing on it and it's just not the fucking case.
239.64s: What I wish I would have told myself or what I would tell myself is the money that you're
245.36s: going to truly benefit from is stuff that you're not going to see it until you're 25,
253.44s: 30 and even that's young.
255.20s: I'm really fortunate in that sense.
258.08s: But you get the point.
259.88s: The fact is is the money that you're trading when you're first starting, that's not the
263.92s: money that's going to be your wealth.
266.32s: The focus should be developing a strategy that's consistent.
271.92s: Once you can maintain consistency, it means that you can control variables and then that's
277.64s: something that you can adapt and scale to become profitable.
283.12s: That's something that if I were to give myself one solid piece of input, that would be the
289.40s: one thing.
290.40s: It's stop trading that small account as if it's going to be your future wealth.
296.28s: Because you start focusing too much on dollar returns on the account as compared to good
303.00s: fundamentals that as you earn more money, as you spread into different business ventures
308.28s: and create more capital that you could then move to that account and deploy successfully.
315.28s: First thing, learn to take paper trading seriously.
319.08s: The second thing is to understand the context of the account and really what the strategy
327.76s: is.
329.28s: The next thing that I would absolutely tell myself, and this is one that I think everybody
338.04s: hears but they don't listen to you.
340.08s: I have a different message.
342.28s: The message would be the summary message, would be learn patience.
347.64s: The job trying to rush this shit and the only thing that's happening in those scenarios
353.28s: is again, just setting myself back.
360.16s: What I would tell myself, obviously I would like to be able to tell myself that message
363.88s: but again, just self identifying, none of us can listen to that.
366.48s: It doesn't work.
367.48s: It just doesn't fucking connect.
369.92s: What I then would offer myself as a follow-up is at the very earliest, the account will
377.52s: start to develop some sort of meaningful value after I hit 25.
383.96s: The reason why I think that that's helpful is it just kind of puts the idea out of my mind
389.16s: that this is going to be wealth that I'm going to be using in my early 20s.
392.72s: Again, I continue to say this because it's true, 25 is still super fucking young.
401.00s: That's the earliest point that I started developing any sort of meaningful wealth and a lot
406.64s: of it is due to good circumstance.
409.16s: I wouldn't say that that's the norm.
411.32s: I'm not saying other folks can't do it but I just like to reiterate that message to level
416.04s: set because if that's the mark you put on it, you might be kind of upset when that doesn't
421.88s: happen.
424.16s: The third message is understand the timeline that the account really needs in order to
433.48s: do anything for you and that is if you're consistently successful.
438.04s: So that would be the third thing.
440.84s: The fourth thing that I would say to myself is one that I think I focus a lot more on
451.36s: it now as a trader but it's focus more on learning to manage risk as compared to pretty
461.04s: much anything else.
463.68s: When I look at the overall world and space of trading, I find that the thing that really
471.40s: separates traders that exist perpetually or can stay in the game long term is their
477.80s: relationship with risk and their ability to modulate it at different points in time
483.04s: to accomplish different things.
485.40s: I find that to be super important and definitely something that I would reiterate to myself
492.72s: really on because it's so easy to try to focus on finding that good trade or finding that
500.40s: next strategy, whatever the case is and all that stuff is good and important in and of
504.44s: itself but I really should have paid more attention to managing risk and I think that that
511.40s: would have done a good job for me to just limit the amount of capital wasted.
520.08s: So that's the next thing.
523.16s: The fifth thing I think I would tell myself and this is, I guess I kind of just recently
529.92s: started thinking about this one but it's the value of that external audit that I talk
537.00s: about. When I first met my mentor, I was kind of on the fence really of what I thought
543.52s: about him, how much I could trust him and that kind of stuff.
548.52s: So I was kind of keeping some of my cards a little close to my chest which I think is
553.40s: fine but what I found is even verbalizing my process with a friend who has a limited
562.24s: understanding of investing was still super helpful.
567.16s: By taking the time to verbally walk through what I was doing, it's something that we all
572.92s: kind of know exists but it really helps us a lot with really flushing through the details
578.88s: of the strategy.
580.48s: So that's something I think that I could have benefited from earlier and I guess that
585.40s: dovetails perfectly into the next thing is right up plan.
589.82s: Right up plan.
590.82s: I don't know what it is about investing in how few people really want to take the time
595.68s: to write a plan because I was one of them.
598.28s: I wanted to just trade and make money but the thing I would tell myself is that trading
605.68s: is one of those interesting things where anybody can start.
610.92s: If you have a tax ID number, so security number and a bank account that you can link to,
615.16s: you can start trading.
616.92s: It is a very select small subset of traders that are able to beat the market and let alone
626.08s: the component to be profitable, I guess I should have phrased that obviously.
632.28s: It's a small subset of traders that are profitable, that actively invest and it's even a smaller
638.00s: subset still that beat the market consistently.
642.56s: I think to me that's a really powerful message in terms of the amount of time and effort
647.44s: that it takes to actually get good at this craft.
652.56s: One of the things that I really would compare it to is the amount of effort that it took
658.92s: me to kind of groom myself to go the marine officer route, the physical component, the
665.96s: mental component, all of that stuff.
668.68s: I put in a lot of effort to be successful in those endeavors and when I first started
673.48s: trading I put a fraction of that effort into trading for some reason.
677.12s: I think it's because most people think you can start and just make money.
680.60s: It's not the case.
682.40s: I would tell myself that example.
684.88s: Essentially the amount of effort that I was putting in to groom myself to be a marine
689.08s: officer is I would almost say the baseline level of effort required in the investing game
695.16s: to be successful.
697.24s: I think that that lays a good context again for my younger, previous self.
705.76s: For those of you that haven't gone that route, that example may not make sense.
710.68s: I would also maybe liken it to if you're a D1F or something like that.
718.36s: Pretty much the amount of effort required to rise to the top of a pack in a competitive
723.96s: environment.
725.04s: That's a fairly suitable analogy.
730.80s: One of those things is putting in that planning, putting in that mental rigor and developing
737.16s: a written plan.
738.16s: I cannot overemphasize the value of that written plan enough because it forces you to come
744.16s: to terms with what you're thinking on paper objectively and be able to answer your
750.56s: thought process.
752.16s: There's a lot of value in that for me.
755.16s: The next thing that I would tell myself is do not be a one trick pony, but be focused
765.92s: on these strategies and approaches that I take the time to learn.
771.92s: When I was first starting like a lot of folks, I was trying just a ton of strategies,
777.36s: just a ton of them.
779.76s: Airflies, calendars, vertical spreads, iron condors, short puts, like pretty much everything.
789.32s: A lot of that would have been better suited in a paper account.
792.64s: That's what I do now is when I'm testing a new strategy, I don't immediately go live
797.48s: with it.
798.48s: I'll do it in a paper account for a little while and see if I like it and can develop
801.04s: a good outline for it.
805.00s: For whatever reason, when I first started trading, I was doing all that shit live and
809.56s: pissing a lot of money away doing it was stupid.
812.92s: Carefully, I was really careful with size and I was very judicious in maintaining good
818.96s: size, so that was helpful.
822.68s: But otherwise, it was still generally a wasted capital.
826.64s: That is another good note.
828.44s: You find yourself not focusing on size or risk allocation.
833.96s: It's something that's worthwhile.
836.32s: The last thing that I would say that I really would kind of tell my younger self is don't
846.80s: focus just on the investing markets, like stock markets.
853.32s: I found that a really key component to my ability to develop wealth at a relatively
858.96s: young age was spreading into other business ventures and you kind of come across different
867.08s: opportunities that way.
869.12s: The market is a really helpful way to continue to enhance your wealth.
874.88s: Like I said, if you're starting with a relatively small amount of money, it's probably not
879.24s: going to be your source of future wealth.
882.16s: I say that a lot.
885.20s: Some of the business ventures that I got into a little bit later in life that would have
889.32s: been helpful earlier, things like real estate.
892.84s: Obviously, that's tough to get into when you're super young, but the sooner you can get
898.16s: into stuff like that, I think it's helpful.
901.88s: Another thing, another general business venture that I think would be pretty wise to crack
910.88s: into is finding ways to turn hobbies into sources of income.
917.16s: One of the things I used to do in college was by cars that were in disrepair and I would
927.20s: fix them.
928.76s: I would sell the fixed car and that actually was a pretty good source of money and one
934.36s: of the bigger producers of my wealth development early on.
941.40s: I would echo getting into things like that a little earlier.
945.12s: I felt like I took a while to get started on that because I was scared to take risk.
951.36s: I think that's where I would wrap this video up is do not be afraid to take risk.
961.16s: It can be scary, but if you don't risk anything or if you don't take good risk, there's a
971.68s: little return on whatever that is.
975.64s: I would tell myself, take good risk and when I talk about good risk, that's something
981.64s: that has good prospects of return, whatever it is.
985.60s: For example, those cars, I would avoid different cars that I didn't think would sell well.
992.12s: That would be bad risk and I'm thankful for doing that.
996.12s: Whatever version of that applies to whatever you get into, I think I would make sure to
1002.44s: be comfortable and willing to take risk, but make sure that it's calculated and it's
1008.52s: good risk.
1009.92s: If you take risk just for the sake of taking risk, sooner or later you're going to get caught
1014.24s: in a shitty spot and you're just going to fucking lose money.
1016.92s: It's like if you go to a casino, there are certain games that have worse or more even house
1025.88s: odds, some of the better games, Blackjack, Crap's, stuff like that.
1031.36s: Then there's some really, really shitty games, slot machines, the worst house odds you
1035.60s: can find.
1037.92s: I do like to gamble if I go to the casino, I'm not going to play the slot machine.
1042.60s: I don't go to a casino to make money, really it's more for entertainment, but nonetheless
1048.44s: I'm still going to pick something like Crap's that's enjoyable but not the worst odds,
1054.04s: like that kind of thing.
1057.44s: Make good risk.
1058.56s: If you are too risk adverse, it's going to be hard to fucking make anything and if you
1063.36s: are too reckless, you're going to lose everything you have.
1067.44s: It really is about finding that balance and it's an unforgiving scale to try to develop.
1076.00s: If you are unsuccessful in developing that balance, like I said, you're either going to miss
1079.80s: a lot of opportunity or you're going to start losing a bunch of money.
1083.92s: If I were to skew my approach, it would be to be kind of less risky as compared to
1091.84s: too risky.
1093.32s: I say that because I generally am pretty conservative and what that means is, you know, like these
1100.56s: people, like Bezos, Bezos, sorry, in Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, like these people who fucking
1106.88s: like stop doing everything and put all of their resources into this idea that they have,
1112.52s: I'm not sure that I have the intestinal fortitude for that.
1115.48s: That's fucking scary to me and I feel really uncomfortable in those kind of scenarios.
1120.56s: So that kind of risk where you're taking like a big fucking gamble but for a really big
1126.00s: reward, it works for some people.
1129.12s: But my general approach really isn't really like that.
1132.32s: It's way more of these base hits until I can develop something a little bit more meaningful
1138.68s: and that's just kind of a reflection on how I take risk.
1142.32s: But spend some time to understand your risk profile and how you approach risk so that you
1148.72s: can develop a good relationship with it early on.
1152.96s: That's going to be important for your longevity and investing.
1156.48s: So those are a handful of things that I would tell myself first starting out.
1162.44s: I was actually thinking about turning this into a little bit of a mini series kind of,
1166.68s: like a monologue with my younger self because I see a lot of young traders on Reddit and
1174.08s: in the Discord groups I'm a part of and I just see so much of myself because we,
1179.96s: most of us are very similar.
1181.64s: If we're trading, there's a lot of similarities in what we're doing.
1185.08s: And I think that we can seriously stand to learn so much from one another and kind of
1191.36s: enhance the process.
1193.48s: Looking back, I have been super fortunate in kind of the risk that I've taken and where
1199.48s: I've been able to navigate myself to.
1202.60s: And if I can impart some of that to folks so that they don't have to take the steps back
1207.80s: that I did, fuck man, like you could be super fucking successful really early if you still
1217.48s: benefit from the education side of things without having to pay for it.
1221.84s: So that's really my goal with this self monologue thing.
1226.56s: But anyways, as always, let me know if there's anything that you want to see me talk about
1230.80s: in particular, happy to do it.
1233.12s: And I will catch everybody later.
