0.00s: Can you use Delta as the probability for an option being in the money at expiration?
6.08s: And if you know anything about me, you already know the answer. It depends.
9.76s: Because it really does depend. It's not a blanket answer and a lot of people don't know that.
13.84s: So the goal of this video is to walk through even why we can use Delta as an approximation of
19.44s: an option being in the money. But then also some of the math behind it so that you can be smarter
24.64s: on how these things work. And then at the end of the video, I want to walk you through the exact
28.96s: scenarios where it does work and then it doesn't work because sometimes you have to apply
34.48s: different approach to get an accurate answer. So with that, what's up everybody? Welcome back
39.60s: to all the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family. Let's get straight to business.
44.80s: So Delta as a probability, we are going to start with a practical application for you guys.
50.40s: Let's take a look here at Nvidia. And we're going to look at this 15 December to DTE options chain.
57.76s: And then my editor will be kind enough to help you guys see and follow along with what I'm talking
62.72s: about right here. We can see the Delta for this 480 put. The Delta here is 44. So traditional
70.88s: approach then would say that we have a 44% chance of this option expiring in the money at expiration.
77.52s: I guess expiring in the money and then addicts kind of duplicative whatever expiring the money
81.76s: at expiration making sure you know that it's at expiration. And if we take a look at the
85.76s: probability that's calculated by the thinkorswim platform, this is showing me 44.5.5. It's moving
92.96s: around right now because markets are still moving a little bit. They're closed, but volatility still
97.36s: changes. So anyways, that's what you're seeing. This is very close, right? This is saying now 43
101.92s: and it's 44. It's within a point, very close tolerance. Okay, cool. So then it sounds like it
107.68s: works, right? Why is this the case? And then what was I talking about at the beginning of the video
112.32s: when I said, well, it doesn't always work. Well, let's take a step over to everybody's favorite.
117.76s: I'm actually pretty sure this is universally accepted that everybody really loves my handwriting.
122.00s: I love this shit. So where would I be without sharing? Look at that. I even got to the point where I had
128.64s: a crunch some of this in. So my awful handwriting got even worse if you can even believe that.
134.24s: Tough for me to believe, but I'll walk you through it. Don't worry. You don't have to know this
137.76s: information in depth. I just want to show you why this works so that you have a better understanding.
142.24s: And if you like this side of trading, I have a video called Introduction to Options where I dive deep
148.56s: into things like the black shoals formula. Well, really, black shoals, Martin model, but the formula
153.28s: that they use in black shoals model so that you can better understand these things. But it's just a
157.60s: differential equation with some different inputs. That's the punch line. Okay, that means absolutely
162.08s: nothing to you as it should because if it did, that means you probably have as little of a life as I do.
166.96s: And you don't actually want to know what this means. But here's a key for you down here. Again,
171.12s: we don't have to go through it. It doesn't really matter. I just want to highlight a few things to you.
174.56s: First, I am going to explain to you what D1 is. So right here is where I break out D1 so that you can
180.88s: see what goes into D1. This matters for a particular reason. Why would it matter? You might think
186.64s: because fun fact. I don't know if you can use the term fun fact when you're talking about this kind
191.52s: of stuff, but I'm going to do it anyways because I think it's fun. Boom. That's Delta. ND1 is Delta.
196.72s: So this is how we are calculating the Delta of an option. Now it is important to note that N in
203.20s: this context, N of X is a cumulative density function. If you don't know what that means,
208.48s: that's okay. You don't really have to know what it means. But you can simply think of it as a
213.04s: distribution of a real variable. So in this case for D1, I am going to walk you through the inputs
219.68s: because the inputs here matter to us. Here we have the log normal distribution of the stock price
225.28s: divided by the strike price plus the risk-free rate plus the annual standard deviation of
231.12s: volatility squared divided by two multiplied by time. And in this case time is as a percentage of
236.48s: a year. And then that's going to be divided by the annualized standard deviation of volatility
241.28s: squared root of time. Okay. Why does this matter? Well, I'm going to show you, but before that because
246.80s: I have OCD, there's D2 in case we're wondering. You're probably over there thinking like what the
251.36s: hell is the cumulative density function of this one? Well, that's D2, fun fact. Okay. But why does
255.52s: it actually matter? Well, let's take a look at how we calculate the probability of an option being
260.08s: in the money. You take the normal distribution of the log normal function of strike divided by
267.28s: stock price. All of that's divided by volatility times the square root of DTE over 365. So in this
274.32s: case, T, right, is DTE as a percentage of a year. That's exactly what we're doing here. So if you
279.60s: notice the denominator in this case, it's the exact same thing. So then if you look at the numerator,
284.48s: you see that this is slightly different, slightly different. Here we're adding a couple additional
290.56s: components like the risk-free rate, annual standard deviation of volatility. This is to get delta,
295.12s: because remember, delta has a different purpose of probability of being in the money. This matters.
300.64s: So because of this, let's now take a look at when this does and does not work. Because in this
308.08s: example, it worked beautifully, right? We have the 43 delta and it's 44 percent probability.
314.88s: Now, let's go out to something that's 37 DTE. This is 45 delta for the 40 put and that's 48.
322.48s: 0.6 percent probability of being in the money. What do you notice? If it's not clear yet,
326.80s: let me zoom out even more. Let's go to this 19 April 128 DTE. I'm going to look at this 42 delta
332.88s: 480 put. I'm just taking essentially the first out of the money put. The 42 delta out of the money
337.92s: put now has a 42 percent probability according to delta, but according to the option, it's 50.74%
345.36s: is calculated by thinkorswim. So what do you notice? Ideally, you notice something that's
350.88s: pretty clear at this point. What's happening is the further out in time you go, the less accurate
358.16s: delta is. Very important for you to know that if you trade anything essentially that's over 90 DTE.
365.28s: Because if we go back to this example, this is 42 DTE. This is 50. That's at eight point
372.16s: variance, eight almost nine point variance. If you're trading something where your outcome can have
379.36s: nine points of slack in potential outcome, one good on you. Because that means you have found an
385.92s: insanely, insanely effective edge. But most of us don't have that. The difference of a 9 percent
391.76s: probability here is pretty massive. And I keep growing it. I realized, but yeah, it's this is
397.84s: essentially, and this is only 192 days out or 128 days out. There goes dyslexia. So what I'm highlighting
404.72s: though is the further you go out in time, the less accurate delta is as your approximation. Now,
411.36s: for those curious on how this all works, I bring you the gift of math. Oh hell no. Let me close this
419.68s: up so it's easier for you to follow along. You can essentially do a side by side with me. And I'll
423.92s: zoom this in for those that are visually impaired. I know that I have a decent amount of my audience.
428.40s: That's above 60. So you guys might need your, your fancy two tone shades. Make sure you're not in
433.20s: the sun. Otherwise, it'll be too dark. And let's take a look. I took the current figures. So 480, 88
439.04s: for an Nvidia. And here are the parameters we need. We need the stock price, days expiration. You get
444.88s: to pick whatever option you're looking at. So in this case, I'm looking at a put and a call. I'm
449.44s: looking at the 480 put the 485 call. Then I'm going to grab the implied volatility for both of those
454.96s: options. So the put IV in this instance is 33.3%. The call IV is 32.42%. You'll have to trust me because
461.60s: it's covered right now. And let's take a look at the outputs for the put. This is calculating the
467.60s: probability of in the money being 49.31%. Thinkorswim is calculating it at 48.63%. And the delta is
475.12s: calculating it at 45%. All slight differences because thinkorswim is going to apply their proprietary
481.60s: formulas for most of these things. So that's why it is a slight deviation from this. But you should
487.04s: notice one thing. We are much closer to what thinkorswim is calculating in this instance than delta is.
492.16s: Same thing for the call side. So how do you calculate these? I'll highlight these real quick so that
496.96s: you can grab the formulas. But it's literally just grabbing the formulas that I just showed you guys.
503.68s: But this for those that look at that and our eyes gloss over here is literally what you could
508.32s: just grab from Google Sheets or Excel is the same thing. Now I will say before people start dropping
513.60s: in saying like, Verma Gerr, the normal distribution function is not working. If you use something like
518.96s: Google Sheets, there are a lot of them. Right. So there's normal distributions for sample, normal
524.40s: distribution for populations. So in this case, you want to use the standard normal distribution function.
531.92s: So norm.s dot dist. And then in Excel, it's slightly different. But you'll be able to figure it out.
538.24s: Hopefully, if not, don't do this and probably don't trade. So be an outlier. See you guys later.
