0.76s: gme Opex and there wasn't a whole lot
4.28s: going on here except this really
6.16s: interesting number we close today at uh
10.48s: $24.97 pretty strange a strange number I
13.76s: think especially when you consider that
15.84s: maximum pain was
19.36s: 25 H weird the topic of the video is
23.48s: actually going to be maximum pain
25.56s: because I want a level set on what it is
28.32s: give everybody a quick overview and how
30.64s: it can impact options because for those
33.92s: that follow gme this product is actually
37.08s: ripe for maximum pain and it's not just
40.60s: from manipulation although that is very
43.36s: likely a component of it so let's take a
46.60s: quick look at the options chains we got
48.40s: to pour one out for the homies because
49.76s: there's over
51.36s: 300,000 options contracts that have
53.84s: expired out of the money worthless Gone
56.16s: Forever shout out to the homies that
58.92s: value is on now what am I seeing a
62.48s: couple things the first thing is
63.96s: volatility is cratering this was above
66.32s: 200 then the high 100s and this is no
70.08s: joke we are looking at something that
73.16s: has contracted meaningfully this doesn't
76.28s: surprise me because it's been generally
78.00s: quiet and the market RIT large has had a
81.20s: hard few days that's also Weighing on
83.56s: GameStop it's not just GameStop going
86.28s: down as of this moment the entire Market
89.20s: really in a broad senses rotating over
92.08s: you can kind of see this if we take a
94.08s: look at net highs and lows down here it
97.20s: just turned negative for the first time
99.12s: in a hot minute and the net lows gross
102.20s: lows I'm sorry is expanding so net highs
106.52s: is essentially zeroed out and gross
109.20s: highs is moved massively over the last
112.56s: couple days right now on the 19th it's
114.92s: sitting at 55 yesterday was at
117.52s: 224 and the day before that at 361 it's
121.12s: cratered so this is a broad rotation
124.92s: that we're seeing where things are
126.60s: coming out of the top performing
130.28s: products and moving into some flight to
133.40s: equity things so things like Bitcoin are
135.24s: up vix is up there's secular strength
139.04s: that you can find but it's really really
140.84s: isolated un is up stuff like ihi medical
145.32s: devices was up but right now if you
148.20s: scroll through the markets the vast
151.24s: majority of this is just yeah it's it's
154.88s: coming down so that weighs on something
157.64s: like GameStop which is good to be aware
159.60s: of so if we take a look now at this idea
162.44s: of Max pain let's talk about this what
164.48s: is it well in a nutshell it's this right
168.00s: here it's when there's an OP options
172.08s: expiration coming up it's the Market
174.00s: Force where price tends to move towards
178.00s: the strike where the the greatest value
181.48s: of options in that cycle would expire
184.12s: worthless so there's a couple
186.08s: assumptions that this has that market
187.88s: makers are the opposite side of these
190.92s: trades net Sellers and they're hedging
193.24s: their positions that's an important
194.56s: assumption and I agree with the
195.96s: Assumption it's broadly true this also
198.64s: assumes that market makers then are
201.48s: incentivized to manipulate the stock
204.40s: such that this would happen and that
207.20s: also is a viable estimation because when
211.08s: options expire in the money a market
213.92s: maker has some work to do because into
217.48s: expiration they need to hold the shares
220.72s: for what's going to expire in the money
222.76s: so that they can then deliver options
225.48s: that expire in the money and are
227.76s: exercised that means that they have to
229.48s: hold shares it increases their risk
231.24s: profile they would much prefer options
233.16s: to expire worthless so yep that also
236.00s: checks out now there is a natural
239.80s: behavior that is not just from
241.80s: manipulating stock the stock price but
245.20s: also from the natural practice of
247.76s: hedging that moves price a bit and it's
250.72s: important to know that again I think
252.44s: it's important to be as objective as
254.28s: possible if we look at things and we
256.28s: just immediately say yes it's all
257.88s: completely rigged there's nothing to be
259.16s: done here it it kind of loses some of
261.72s: its value if you dismiss everything in
263.68s: that way although sometimes it can feel
265.44s: like that and it's the same thing to the
267.20s: people that say everything's priced
268.60s: perfect it's all great there's nothing
269.96s: going on that's also not so much true
271.96s: it's kind of our job to be able to
274.28s: identify these gray areas so one of the
276.68s: things is their natural hedging Behavior
279.28s: can move price now does that mean that
282.72s: they wouldn't be incentivized to move
284.08s: price or that they wouldn't they are
286.64s: incentivized to move price so I don't
288.56s: actually view those two things as
290.80s: completely separate from one another so
293.36s: how do we identify max pain well the
295.64s: cool thing is there are some websites
298.12s: that do this for you let me find one
301.16s: this guy right here I had to look around
302.96s: on all my screens but there it is so
305.12s: this website called maximum pain.com not
307.16s: affiliated with them in any way but they
309.08s: do it for you and they show you where
310.64s: maximum pain is where the highest oi
312.96s: strike is where the highest put oi
315.08s: strike is where the amounts are and yeah
318.76s: it it is a pretty clean description of
320.72s: where you can find it in something like
322.56s: this think or Swim it also helps us with
324.68s: it where you can look at the intrinsic
327.00s: value so if the option
330.24s: with the most intrinsic value are set to
332.44s: expire worthless that's where maximum
333.88s: pain is and you can see it's right where
335.60s: the bottom of this thing is right at
337.52s: this dip which is 25 so you can look at
340.96s: it for different series it's going to
342.96s: pertain primarily to the front
344.40s: expiration cycle now the other thing to
347.12s: keep in mind is it
349.48s: moves maximum pain is not a static
353.68s: figure why is that well as people trade
356.12s: their
357.04s: contracts this is naturally going to
360.40s: move around so an example of this is
362.28s: just from earlier this week this is
364.64s: looking at GameStop on the 17th of July
367.96s: right after the open and I'm showing you
371.20s: where maximum pain was then it was like
373.32s: 29 or 28 looks like 29 to me something
377.56s: like that so this was just a couple days
379.32s: ago so what I'm highlighting to you is
381.24s: that the the figure is not static and if
383.76s: you're going to use the figure you're
385.48s: best off really focusing on it on the
388.60s: day of expiration that's where you'll
391.08s: kind of have the best idea on where this
394.00s: is a couple other things to be aware of
397.84s: that this effect is most prominent in
401.64s: smaller more El liquid stocks GameStop
405.76s: Falls right into that bucket it's
407.28s: because price is easier to manipulate in
409.88s: products like that if you want to
411.44s: manipulate the price in something like
413.00s: spy it would take such a massive amount
415.68s: of money because it's such a big Market
418.28s: if you have a smaller Market it it's
420.16s: much easier to move price and again to
424.00s: keep it
425.40s: objective there's mixed evidence out
427.72s: there I'm going to show you this study
429.04s: which I really really like and this
431.40s: leans in the favor of asserting it
434.12s: exists and it's statistically
436.56s: significant meaning it's something we
437.80s: should pay attention to I like this
439.84s: study I also agree with this study
442.16s: broadly the this study helps us become a
444.88s: little more nuanced in our understanding
446.92s: now for those that are interested in
448.52s: learning more about Max pain P I have a
450.00s: video that goes into the topic in depth
452.08s: I'll link to that in the notes below
453.60s: this is more designed to be kind of an
455.08s: overview to help us get familiar with
457.20s: the
457.92s: concept but let me grab that study for
460.24s: us so that we can review it together
462.04s: it's this one right here and I
464.24s: highlighted some sections this is just
465.48s: from the abstract if you're not familiar
466.92s: with reading papers like this it it's
468.72s: really easy you can go on to ssrn and
471.48s: grab them and really what you want to do
475.32s: is understand the strengths and
478.24s: limitations of the study none of them
479.92s: are perfect they all use assumptions and
482.00s: things like that but what I like to do
484.28s: is collude between different studies and
487.24s: kind of compare an aggregate output so
489.40s: that I have a good idea across studies
492.00s: what seems to be the case so you can say
494.64s: see here that they say we construct a
497.04s: measure of Maximum pain gain loss they
499.60s: sort stocks according to that and they
501.72s: find that a spread portfolio that buys
504.28s: High max pain stocks and sells Low Max
507.16s: Paine stocks generates large positive in
509.84s: statistically significant returns in
511.40s: Alphas that matters so you can play max
514.88s: pain in two different directions you can
516.56s: play prices capacity to Trend towards or
519.56s: away from it depending on where it is
521.52s: relative to current price which is
523.16s: actually pretty interesting the other
525.64s: things that are important here it says
528.28s: our results provide strong evidence of
530.00s: Market return predictability at the
532.16s: expiration of options and that they find
534.56s: the returns reverse after expiration
538.12s: week also important and that um all
541.60s: consistent with stock manipulation on
543.04s: the part of Market participants with
544.64s: short options positions and the last
547.52s: piece here is especially strong for
550.12s: relatively small a liquid stocks so I
554.32s: highly highly highly recommend that you
556.68s: read through this become familiar with
558.68s: the concepts you can look at the way
560.80s: that they calculate max pain so that you
562.76s: understand how to do it you can throw it
563.88s: in Excel yourself it's really not that
566.08s: difficult it's a little bit annoying not
568.16s: going to lie because you essentially
570.08s: have to go through and look at each of
573.24s: these individual strike prices and you
575.32s: have to multiply the strike price by the
578.00s: oi that would tell you the intrinsic
580.04s: value at expiration now you can eyeball
583.40s: it and you can do that by looking at
585.40s: where oi open interest is the greatest
588.44s: and that'll give you a good starting
590.00s: point but it's not perfect because say
593.24s: for example the 30s here that have
596.28s: 65,000 let's say that they had 72,000
599.56s: oi that would be the most open interest
602.84s: that would be more than the 70,000
604.88s: that's out here but where would max pain
607.48s: be in that scenario do you know wrote in
609.64s: the comments I'll answer you now if this
612.96s: was at 72,000 you would take 72,000 time
615.84s: 30 and then you would have to take
617.68s: 70,000 * 125 it's much greater out here
621.56s: so even though this would have a larger
623.68s: oi max pain is still out here so it's
626.76s: relative now again in general you could
629.08s: go to where the highest oi is and narrow
631.40s: it down pretty quickly to the the the
633.44s: top three and then reason through it
636.12s: pretty fast or you could do the math or
638.64s: you can check out some of these
639.64s: different platforms that really help us
642.08s: understand it inherently but this to me
645.88s: looks like something weird happened
648.44s: that's the best I can say about it this
650.80s: looks too convenient from an expiration
654.48s: perspective for this thing to be kind of
656.60s: just dumped off very very slowly into
659.72s: the cloth today does that mean that I'm
661.88s: full tinfoil hat saying that GameStop is
664.24s: perpetually always and forever
666.56s: manipulated probably to be honest
669.12s: because the way that this thing moves
671.12s: but jokes aside I want to be clear
673.60s: though that it's product specific
676.52s: there's a lot of nuance is what I'm
678.16s: trying to emphasize there so make sure
680.52s: that you don't get too wrapped up in one
683.32s: thought process and you stay open to how
685.76s: individual things move but GameStop is
688.84s: kind of uh kind of interesting to me to
691.32s: say the least so I think that wraps up
696.40s: Max Payne RIT large if you have any
697.84s: questions on it let me know if there's
699.04s: anything else you want me to take a look
700.44s: at let me know in the comments and then
702.44s: I will see you on the live stream
704.00s: tomorrow with my boy Newton be an
706.04s: outlier I'll see you guys later
