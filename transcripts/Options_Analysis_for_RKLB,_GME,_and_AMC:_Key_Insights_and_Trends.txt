0.52s: what's up allers quick market update
2.28s: before the options trading for beginners
4.48s: live stream later today at 5:00 P p.m.
6.44s: Pacific time let's take a look at what
9.40s: happened in two names this week the
11.92s: first one we're going to look at is
13.32s: rocket lab rkb and then we'll take a
15.88s: look at GameStop to see how it wrapped
18.08s: up this week into next week and then
21.24s: somebody also asked me to take a look at
23.20s: AMC so happy to take a peek at all of
26.16s: these and just see from a general
28.68s: trading perspective obviously my lens's
31.12s: options U see what it looks like so
34.84s: taking a look at Rocket Labs the reason
38.40s: why this one came up is because one of
40.12s: my buddies at the gym he he's not a
42.80s: Trader he's just a dude that you know
44.68s: dabbles in stocks and he was just like
47.96s: hey man because he knows I trade he's
49.64s: like hey man what do you think about
51.48s: rocket Labs or klb and I was just like
54.64s: okay there we go and it's so funny to me
56.96s: because you could tell how people come
59.40s: across these different names and I was
60.80s: just like oh yeah you know I'm familiar
62.24s: with that it's getting popular on like
63.52s: Reddit he's like yeah that's where I
64.60s: found it uh which is perfect so what's
68.00s: going on here well I mean it's been
70.00s: breaking out and continuing to break out
72.00s: like that's mostly from what I see from
74.08s: a technical perspective it's like very
76.32s: very standard Fair where we have big
78.88s: movement consolidation of some sort
81.12s: sometimes the consolidation can be a
82.60s: several percent contraction but it
84.36s: should be less than 10 10 starts to get
86.68s: too steep then we have another bit of a
88.68s: surge back up to these levels
90.68s: consolidation bit of a surge
92.92s: consolidation and this process can go on
95.24s: for some time depending on you know what
97.44s: the overall favorability is for the
99.72s: stock what the news looks like all those
101.24s: kinds of things so this is very common
103.56s: now one thing to highlight are the
106.48s: volume so we absolutely are seeing
109.52s: pretty significant volume on these big
112.40s: up dayss and that's important to me
114.32s: because that means that these larger up
115.84s: moves are broadly supported now the
119.16s: volume is defin contracted from what we
121.28s: saw right after earnings and then kind
123.56s: of a few days after when some news broke
126.08s: but other than that the the volume on
128.16s: these updates is noteworthy to me so I
130.04s: mean you can already see I I have
131.44s: something on in here this is where
133.44s: essentially my stop is set and I'm just
136.00s: following it up that's as simple as it
138.20s: goes for me from a trend following
139.72s: perspective I'm using options just
142.08s: because it's a a little bit way to gain
145.04s: leverage cheaply so I'm not looking to
147.52s: buy a bunch of shares it's easier for me
149.08s: just to trade it with options so that's
150.64s: what I'm doing but if we take a look at
153.84s: the overall position and this is as
156.16s: always my pass through Ira so there's no
158.48s: positions there's nothing no nothing in
160.28s: here it's just so that all my account
162.12s: information isn't blasted all over the
163.76s: place so but taking a look at it it has
167.32s: tremendous call skew absolutely
169.36s: tremendous call skew right so we can see
171.00s: that 354,000 calls against 170,000 puts
175.76s: so people are playing this to the upside
177.56s: no doubt and if we take a look at the
179.28s: volume today today 33,000 calls against
182.52s: 13 1 12 on the put side and the majority
186.00s: of the puts are sales coming in at the
188.44s: bid or below and the majority of the
190.48s: calls that are discernable are um being
193.96s: bought at the offer or
196.96s: above so I mean right now it looks just
199.88s: generally bullish I mean that that's the
201.92s: the long and short of it we obviously
203.60s: have a bit of an interesting series of
205.60s: kinks in the volatility smile because we
208.00s: have earnings coming up on the sixth so
210.40s: you can see that represented in a few
212.28s: different spots uh the 6th of November
213.88s: by the way not not obviously this month
216.96s: but when we look across the different
220.36s: volatilities you can see that it starts
222.08s: to Peak up here right so 905 89 and 3/4
227.44s: 88 and 3/4 then 94 so why does it pop up
231.44s: to here it's because this expiration
232.96s: contains earnings so yeah overall it
235.60s: looks interesting to me so let's take a
237.80s: quick look then at just overall how it's
241.28s: behaving inside seeing if there's any
244.16s: unusual activity going on so if we grab
247.28s: unusual whales and we take a peak we can
250.88s: see from a broad perspective that I mean
256.44s: it's mostly C right like you can see
258.44s: that's what the the green is showing us
260.40s: and then the the put volume is right on
262.52s: top there so we already generally knew
265.96s: this at least from the course of today
268.08s: so let's take a look and see if there's
269.96s: any big trades that have happened
272.80s: recently and this is just a standard
275.32s: look that I would take I would probably
277.04s: use like the the past week and see so
279.56s: there are some decent Siz trades in here
281.76s: and we can see that a lot of them are
283.40s: very long-dated though 15 Jan 27 17 Jan
287.84s: 25 right so these are further out in
289.80s: time these are people playing the longer
292.00s: term play here which obviously they're
294.12s: thinking rocket Labs up so that's all
296.84s: this is but there are some noteworthy
298.92s: size trades in here I've been following
300.52s: this for a while since it was introduced
302.08s: to me for the meme stock trading segment
305.00s: so yeah overall this looks about right
307.92s: so yeah overall rocket Labs looks like
310.00s: it's still being strongly supported the
312.04s: way that I look at it is again you can
313.68s: see where I'm getting out if it starts
315.08s: dropping below that otherwise I'll keep
316.68s: following it up the next kind of interm
318.68s: alert I would put would be somewhere
320.88s: right around here I prefer to use a
322.52s: close on this first one this is kind of
325.56s: like the preemptive trigger and then
326.96s: secondary trigger so yeah that's that
329.72s: let's take a look now at GameStop then
331.36s: AMC for GameStop we talked a lot about
334.36s: this yesterday actually with Peruvian
335.76s: Bowl so I'm not going to go super far
337.92s: into detail here but I do want to
339.32s: overview some of the late happenings
342.80s: with it so primarily we're still in this
344.92s: very range bound segment and I want you
347.64s: to notice that the point of control is
349.32s: actually about to shift so this is a
351.68s: six-month daily chart if I squish all
353.40s: this down you can see that right here
355.80s: the volume node is about almost the same
358.00s: size as this volume node so this this
359.80s: volume note is actually going to shift
361.24s: down here uh soon enough which tells me
363.60s: that again A lot of people are
365.92s: transacting here so uh relative basis I
368.40s: should say so what that means to me is
371.16s: from a broader perspective I think you
374.60s: have to start thinking where is the
376.44s: floor this is actually one of the the
378.00s: things that came up on the conversation
379.92s: and provian bow is of the opinion that
381.96s: it's somewhere around 20 which I think
383.60s: is a completely completely Fair
386.16s: estimation right so we can see how it's
388.20s: trending sideways here I'm a little more
390.72s: conservative right so I would use this
392.60s: near-term resistance maybe somewhere 19
395.64s: Range High 19s but the only reason why I
398.40s: say that is because we can see it's been
400.16s: supported at this 1980 handle is it's
403.88s: not a precise Target right it's always
405.64s: ranges but it's bounced around there a
408.48s: few times at this point so we can see
410.52s: how it starts to behave around the 20
412.16s: handle which is very very close to it
414.40s: but it looks like it penetrates a little
416.28s: bit further down than the 20 handle to
418.28s: me but we'll see looks like 192 to 20 I
421.16s: think is a completely Fair shake so from
423.64s: a price
424.96s: perspective that's mostly what's going
426.88s: on here trending sideways very very
429.44s: light volume volume has dried up
431.48s: massively so if we go back to this kind
433.80s: of larger day we can see it was 7 mil
436.32s: 5.6 mil 4.6 mil and then now 5.2 5.3 mil
441.76s: so very very light volume quiet period
444.72s: is what I see now going to the options
447.12s: we already talked a little bit about
448.72s: this again recently but there's a few
450.76s: things that I think are worth noting the
452.80s: first one is the put side did tick up a
455.40s: little bit in terms of OI but still
457.04s: nowhere near closing in on that 2:1
459.32s: ratio and the other thing I have to keep
461.80s: hammering is the fact that GameStop is
463.88s: not centralized in the front expirations
466.36s: anymore which is new this continues to
468.76s: be slightly different than what we've
470.04s: seen previously when it was like highly
472.16s: active so this isn't to suggest that
474.40s: it's inactive but this tells me that
476.40s: people are playing things a little
478.64s: further out
480.00s: which makes a lot of sense to me because
482.52s: it's been quiet so I'm not sure why we
484.92s: would want to play really near-term
486.92s: moves if volume is slowing down if price
490.44s: is
491.28s: consolidating I think that's good for
493.00s: the stock to do that as compared to you
495.24s: know too many big jumps around it just
497.28s: kind of creates choppiness in price and
499.00s: it can chew a lot of Traders up which I
500.56s: don't want to see but when I see price
503.92s: consolidating like this it makes sense
505.80s: to me to see options starting to favor
509.32s: this kind of configuration where we're
510.88s: spread out a little bit we're not
512.28s: getting um eviscerated via extrinsic
515.44s: value decaying away in our options the
517.76s: other thing I want to show you is the V
519.28s: surface really quick so if I use
521.56s: specifically out ofth money options
523.20s: which is my preference so it's going to
524.44s: look at out of the money calls and puts
525.80s: for the upside downside let's get rid of
528.96s: this front expiration because it's
529.96s: always going to be skewed and there's a
531.96s: few changes in this and I look at this
534.52s: all the time there's a few changes that
536.56s: I I notice the first one is take a look
538.92s: at this 11 o expiration the blue line
542.96s: look how low this is for the at the
546.12s: monies and then look how high all of
549.16s: these other expirations are and then
551.16s: look at how high the 11 OCT penetrates
554.32s: out above all the others That's Unique
557.48s: so this is something where I Look to
559.96s: trade the expansion of the at the money
562.04s: B relative potentially to the
564.96s: contraction of next cycle out of the
568.56s: money or at the money all depending on
570.04s: where I can find ideal um I wouldn't
573.12s: call them mispricings but definitely VA
575.16s: disparities to play relative value VA
577.60s: place here but the thing I can tell you
579.72s: outright is that typically you would
581.40s: have the front expiration a bit higher
583.36s: than the others very normal also
585.44s: typically you have this put side being
587.36s: higher than the call side that's also
588.96s: Market fears the downside very normal
591.44s: but you normally would not have the at
594.24s: the monies for these 11s so low relative
598.52s: to all of these other right so for
600.80s: example if we take a look at Rocket lab
603.76s: just out of curiosity I don't know what
604.72s: it is I didn't look yet but let's see
607.60s: yeah so bit of a different story already
610.12s: let me get rid of this front
612.00s: expiration well that's just a
615.00s: mess so this is just Madness this is
618.12s: this is a smile like mine because this
621.52s: is it's got Peaks here trouts here this
625.28s: is all over the map so this is a bad
627.44s: example let me show you something that
628.96s: would be
629.84s: at least a better example for the sake
631.68s: of a conversation I'll get show you
634.24s: apple and get rid of this this is way
635.92s: more normal so you notice how the call
638.68s: side typically is lower than the put
640.20s: side notice how this blue line is higher
642.76s: than most of the other lines right
644.92s: that's very very standard exactly what I
647.28s: would expect to see so the reason why
650.24s: this does this is because the front
652.12s: expiration becomes so pronounced that it
654.88s: overwhelms all the others and flattens
656.44s: them out on a relative basis that's why
657.88s: I get rid of this when more at
659.84s: expiration because this will be so
661.04s: peaked out all right so now let's take a
663.44s: look and see if there's any interesting
665.72s: trades I didn't see anything that stuck
667.28s: out to me again I look at this every day
668.96s: but we'll talk about a couple of these
671.16s: so these we already covered so I I don't
674.56s: when I say didn't see anything it's not
676.12s: that anything didn't happen but we
678.60s: already talked about these we can see
680.36s: this build out further out in time much
682.96s: heavier exposure this is actually
684.36s: similar to what you're seeing in rocket
685.68s: Labs where we're not just playing the
687.76s: near-term craziness we're actually
689.64s: playing slightly longer term ideas here
692.12s: that's where most of the money is so
694.28s: from an options perspective that tells
696.56s: me again that the market is trying to
699.12s: play the long-term move or at least a
701.68s: longer term move SL window as compared
705.08s: to this High concentration in the front
707.64s: expirations so GameStop to me in general
711.08s: looks to be consolidating the areas that
713.48s: I'm really interested in let me get rid
715.24s: of Apple boring Apple the areas I'm
718.32s: interested in realis istically are if we
720.40s: start to see a break above here and it
722.92s: would need to be joined by volume or a
725.68s: break below here this to me would
728.64s: indicate some sort of change to the
731.04s: downside I'm going to get rid of this
732.72s: line just to make it a little cleaner so
734.76s: you can see the range that I'm
736.76s: eyeballing here and I want to see breaks
739.32s: above or breaks below and when I say
743.64s: want to see it's just because it helps
745.64s: me identify which way we're going right
748.92s: because right now it's very much uh who
751.76s: knows right we're just chopping sideways
754.12s: this is standard consolidation but one
756.60s: thing I don't love is that this relative
759.28s: High here is lower than this I would
761.72s: love to see that higher and I also don't
763.92s: love that this low is slightly lower
766.84s: than this relative low so that's
768.80s: typically a bit of a curve turning over
772.04s: so we'll see how it goes sideways action
774.92s: for now all right last one is AMC and
778.76s: this will was um I'm not going to AMC is
783.08s: interesting to me to be clear all meme
784.80s: stocks are interesting to me but I don't
787.24s: I haven't like gotten into the story for
789.36s: AMC like I have GameStop so I'm not
791.72s: going to pretend I know anything about
793.16s: AMC or GameStop for that matter but
795.24s: definitely even less AMC so I'm just
797.64s: going to look at this purely from a a a
800.92s: trading lens I don't want you guys to
803.72s: think that there's a lot of baked in
805.08s: ideas here so there really isn't I don't
807.28s: have a lot of context here for AMC but
811.00s: the main thing I do see with AMC is it's
813.80s: essentially falling below this point of
816.04s: control so the point of control clearly
818.08s: was established during this time frame
820.12s: when it was running sideways pretty hard
823.28s: and then it since started rotating down
826.60s: a little bit so it's kind of exhibiting
829.84s: similar Behavior as some of the other
831.36s: meme stocks right so to me it looks like
833.36s: near-term floor looks like something
835.48s: like this and this would be a close
837.64s: below that somewhere around there and
841.04s: then really once we start breaking above
843.44s: this point of control is where it starts
845.36s: get interesting to me to the upside
847.44s: notice how I use a close for below
850.32s: simply because it what I'm seeing as
852.72s: these candles are getting down towards
854.56s: these swings they extend a little bit
856.76s: but then they suck back up in or they
859.04s: don't extend at all and they just hammer
860.52s: out so there's not like these really big
863.44s: Body candles that are crossing below
865.24s: this threshold and shooting back up
866.64s: above so that's why I would want to see
868.72s: a for something a little more definitive
870.76s: and then for the above side a breakout
873.20s: to a breakout so these things can start
875.24s: moving really really fast so that's why
877.72s: this is a Mark Price alert this is why
880.60s: this is a close price alert slight
883.32s: difference in what I look
884.88s: for the other thing I see here is volume
888.60s: is also siphoned out massively so 10 mil
892.24s: 27 12 12 9 7 99 8 5 almost 6
899.88s: 9 so from here it's contracted a lot
903.04s: here it actually expanded not not
905.92s: insignificantly again I'm going to zoom
907.72s: this in a little bit further so we can
909.04s: get rid of that Madness yeah so we can
910.80s: open this up a little bit and see on a
912.24s: relative basis a lot of sale volume see
914.48s: all this red lot of sale volume and so
917.96s: yeah it looks like we had a little bit
919.88s: of a a peakiness and volume established
921.96s: here which obviously kicked these
924.08s: averages up a little bit but
926.56s: now um the longer term moving average I
929.44s: think we're right below that here yeah
931.36s: it's 9.4 for a 20-day so a little bit
934.40s: more volume activity from what I can see
936.56s: today compared to the last few days but
939.36s: still not anything like what we were
941.36s: seeing in here around earnings or even
943.00s: before earnings so this to me on a
945.60s: short-term time frame does look way more
947.44s: like a a downtrend right so if on a
949.68s: three-month chart linear these are
951.56s: standard deviation channels negative
953.12s: sloping I'm seeing continuation of lower
956.28s: highs so a high here a lower high here a
959.52s: lower high here a lower high here a
962.24s: lower high here that's a very
965.04s: standard downside continuation now the
968.16s: question always is where does it grab a
969.64s: bite and where does it start to level
972.12s: out it looks like it's starting here
973.84s: right so if we draw just a a loose um
977.16s: price level
978.56s: here you can see that I kind of messed
980.80s: with this level here here here and here
984.08s: sloppy though right because that's a
985.92s: pretty meaningful range around this not
987.92s: massive but enough and again I always
989.80s: remind people when I'm looking at stuff
991.92s: like these different kinds of lines I
993.88s: use the lines because they're easier but
995.64s: that's not what I mentally visualize
997.92s: what I mentally see when I draw those
999.72s: lines I'll show you it's a little bit
1001.64s: more of like a value area so what I
1004.04s: would do is I would grab essentially
1008.20s: this right so movements in this area are
1012.00s: what start to interest me because we can
1014.16s: see it bounced off of it here and then
1016.64s: if I zoom this out a little bit for
1018.96s: context we can see that it interacted
1021.36s: with the same level back here right
1023.04s: that's I wasn't zoomed in there it's not
1024.96s: by happen Dan just kind of how it goes
1027.64s: so last thing I want to look at in here
1030.04s: are the options and let's kill this
1032.92s: front ball yeah so very put heavy stuff
1036.48s: nothing jumping out at me there let's
1038.56s: grab all of
1041.24s: these tremendous csue tremendous 1 mil
1046.28s: versus 244,000 puts
1049.44s: that's massive like unequivocally that
1051.64s: is massive and there is a lot traded
1053.84s: today look at this 63,000 calls traded
1056.36s: today 52% were bought of those
1060.52s: 63 that's interesting that's really
1063.04s: really interesting to me
1065.20s: um that's not
1069.04s: insignificant fascinating so let's see
1071.72s: where that volume is
1074.36s: concentrated so it looks like a little
1076.20s: bit of rolling activity right so taking
1078.12s: the fronts meaning the four moving
1079.84s: amount to the 11th it does have earnings
1082.24s: on 7 November so what I want to do now
1086.40s: is see for open interest where is it
1088.60s: concentrated the 11th has
1091.20s: 40 18th has 81 13 11
1098.76s: 371 82 281 so this is where it starts
1102.40s: getting
1103.40s: deep yeah two there it is again 154 so a
1107.64s: lot of this volume is at look at all
1110.36s: that that's over half the volume is
1113.24s: greater than 17 JN out so these are
1115.36s: longer term plays that's most of what I
1117.84s: see here this is not people playing a
1119.56s: bunch of like near-term movement
1121.36s: expectations because over 600,000 of
1123.80s: these calls are further out in time so
1127.12s: interesting there last thing we'll take
1129.16s: a look at quick is any interesting
1131.68s: trades for the
1133.56s: week and this looks quiet so I see
1137.64s: largest TR TR here was
1140.20s: 89 let's see just between all of them if
1142.96s: there's any big trades and when I say
1145.44s: all of them just the sides of the trades
1146.84s: I normally look at calls on the offer
1149.20s: but we can see sometimes if there's
1150.68s: something close to the mid that maybe
1152.52s: lean towards the offer or whatever but
1154.92s: this is pretty small in here to me so
1158.16s: most interesting part about AMC here for
1160.28s: me definitely is this this call skew
1162.52s: that's pretty significant I'm actually
1163.88s: guessing that's probably why somebody
1164.88s: asked me to look at that it's because
1166.28s: they know I look at that stuff so
1169.20s: interesting all right gang well that
1171.00s: wraps me up for today we have options
1172.64s: trading for beginners 5:00 p.m. tonight
1174.24s: gme live stream tomorrow 5:00 P p.m
1176.20s: Pacific time and then Market prep on
1178.20s: Sunday for the outlier Pro members you
