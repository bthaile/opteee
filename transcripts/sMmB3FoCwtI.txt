0.00s: What is up everyone? Another GameStop update because the volatility won't quit.
5.68s: So this is from the 19th of June. I want to walk through what the volatility was yesterday.
10.20s: What it's looking like today. Take a walk through the options chain with you guys and then answer a few questions
15.08s: that I got in from a couple of the last videos that I think are great questions.
18.80s: And hopefully they will help us look at options more in depth and have a better capability to analyze markets with them.
26.64s: That's the idea.
27.80s: So 19 June volatility was at 207 85 after the close right now.
32.60s: We have about 13 minutes before the close.
34.60s: So markets not quite closed yet. And when I took this screenshot, maybe a little less than 10 minutes ago,
40.40s: the 20 June front expiration volatility was up to 247.
44.80s: Again, mine blown the fact that this is kind of scorching up that much is still absolutely wild to me.
54.40s: Look how far out the implied volatility is starting to increase.
59.00s: What I like to do is compare the previous chains and see how far out do I have to go before there's not much change.
66.60s: And realistically, you have to go out 365 days to the 20 June 25s.
71.20s: These are 103 65 against 102 43. So these went up marginally.
76.80s: But there's massive, massive, massive volatility expansion within these shorter term expectations.
81.60s: Again, this has gone from 207 to 247.
84.60s: This has gone from 161 to 189. We're seeing volatility expand.
88.80s: There's no if ants or butts about that.
92.00s: Now you guys had a lot of really interesting ideas in the comments of the last video,
95.80s: because I asked your opinion, why is this happening?
97.60s: I'm still trying to figure it out.
98.80s: I don't have a definitive answer for you.
100.20s: And I'm not going to pretend like I have one.
102.80s: I think that's a disservice to everybody.
104.40s: I have tons of ideas on what it could be.
106.40s: But my ideas don't really matter.
108.00s: What matters is what I can objectively see and share that with you guys.
112.00s: As you know, my goal is not to spread hype or fide.
115.40s: It's to share information and then let you interpret it.
118.80s: However you so choose.
120.60s: So sticking straight to the facts, massive expansion in volatility.
125.60s: No doubt about it.
126.80s: As I look at the volatility smile, there's another really interesting function.
130.80s: Here, you'll notice on the put side, the volatility cracked above 1300.
135.80s: Now it's over 1500 on the put side.
139.60s: Now a couple of people were talking about this question right here.
143.60s: Hey, something's going on 125 calls.
146.60s: Ivy just succeeded 900 great eyeballs.
150.20s: Unfortunately, this doesn't mean as much as you think it might.
154.40s: I'll explain to you why when market makers are making markets,
159.20s: they have to make qualitative assessments about their risk.
162.80s: So when we look at really, really far out of the money options,
167.80s: we price those typically way more rich because there's way more risk
173.40s: in holding that position.
175.00s: So when we go all the way out here to the 125's that are bid at a penny
180.00s: offered at two, we're over 1000% Ivy now people are thinking,
184.20s: man, this means that we got to be going up right.
187.20s: It actually doesn't that's that's really not what this means.
190.60s: What it means is there's absolutely a perception of risk to the extremes.
196.20s: This is what we would call fat pales.
199.60s: And in kind of statistical terms, we have a normal distribution curve.
204.40s: Markets do not represent normal distributions.
207.20s: They have what we call skew in kurtosis.
209.60s: This is not a stats class.
211.00s: Not going to bore you with it.
212.40s: The fact of the matter is is we get extreme moves way more frequently
217.60s: than a normal distribution would project for us.
222.20s: So if I give you an example of the really far out of the money puts here,
227.40s: notice the implied volatility on the super far out of the money put 1700%.
232.60s: That is because there is a perception of way more risk super far out.
238.20s: And this is also one of the biggest problems with buying these really
242.20s: cheap far out of the money options is because they're so expensive.
247.20s: They are priced so rich for what they are.
252.00s: And I know that sounds weird because you're like, well, dude, it's a penny and a half.
255.00s: How rich is that on a relative basis?
257.40s: Super rich mega rich ultra rich cannot be more rich.
261.40s: Very rich.
262.40s: So what I'm highlighting is this is a pricing functionality of markets.
266.60s: The market makers are going to get their pound of flesh to take on what they perceive as risk.
271.80s: And that's exactly why you will see this in the far out of the money options.
277.00s: Now to be clear on a relative basis and something else that you guys may or may not know,
281.40s: when we come down here and look at the smile, it's exactly what I'm looking at.
285.40s: I know that some of you guys think that, you know, it's easier to see in the chain and maybe so.
290.00s: But when you look at this stuff enough, it's exactly what I'm seeing, right?
293.00s: Because if I go to these 125s, which are way out here, I can see what the IV is.
297.00s: It's a thousand and 38% right?
299.80s: I can see that that's what the smile shows me all in one spot.
303.40s: But the smile also shows me that the put side is way, way more rich.
309.00s: This still is noteworthy.
311.00s: And this is because of the way that game stop behaves.
315.40s: What that means is it does have the ability to pop to the upside.
319.40s: If you go back to some of the videos I did last week, the beginning of this week,
323.40s: the call side was way more rich than the put side.
327.40s: That means the market was anticipating significant upward movements.
331.20s: It was pricing them into the options.
333.20s: But we're seeing this kind of normalization where the put's are way more rich.
337.60s: And kind of to help maybe prove this point a little bit more,
340.80s: let's go to something like Apple.
342.40s: Apple, big company moves around, but not like a ton.
345.20s: And if we take a look at the super far out of the money puts, they're at 2000% IV.
350.80s: It's the same function.
352.00s: If we go to the super far out of the money calls in this case, it's only 250.
355.20s: Why is that?
356.60s: Because on a relative basis, the market fears the downside way more
361.64s: in carrying this position.
363.00s: So it's demanding a massive premium on how they're pricing the
367.40s: vols in these super far out of the money options.
369.80s: That's one of the down the downfalls of using super far out of the money options.
374.20s: Is on a relative basis.
375.60s: They are exceedingly expensive.
377.60s: So now as I take a look at the options chain, as I typically do with you guys,
383.00s: there's a few things I'm seeing.
384.60s: The very first thing I'm seeing is take a look at the number of calls traded today.
388.20s: However, this time it's different, especially from yesterday.
391.60s: Look at how many of those are being entered in at the offer and above.
399.00s: 39% this is bullish skew.
402.40s: Then if I look at the puts side and I see 33% of those puts came in at the bid.
407.40s: These are selling puts again, also bullish skew.
410.40s: So it's not easy to say again, definitively what this means to me.
414.80s: It just looks like people trying to really take advantage of this crazy high volatility.
418.80s: That's what I see as far as the reason for the volatility.
421.80s: We're still trying to figure that out.
423.20s: There's all these different ideas between the FDs,
426.20s: between these other ETFs that might be surrogately shorting,
430.40s: GameStop and that has a relationship here potentially.
433.40s: All sorts of ideas, which are kind of fun to track down and keep an eyeball on.
436.80s: Just right now there's no definitive answer as far as I can see.
440.40s: Now the last thing I want to mention is when I take a look at this other question,
445.60s: which was a good question is with all the options at 2025 and 30 expiring tomorrow.
451.00s: Do you have any guesses what will happen to the stock after hours if it closes above?
454.60s: It's a great question.
455.60s: And to me, there's enough liquidity in the market right now for market makers
460.00s: to be able to cover their positions.
461.80s: That's my guess.
463.00s: So as I look at the 20s, the 25s, we can see we're getting a bit of a rally right now.
469.20s: That's up a little over 3%.
471.00s: But these are already at a 93 delta of one delta.
474.00s: So what that tells me is the market makers in these kinds of positions.
477.60s: They're already going to be essentially fully hedged coming into the expiration.
481.60s: Now this is if they're not playing the shell game, which they might.
485.80s: That's hard to say.
487.20s: But from a standardized procedure, my assumption would be that as these option
492.00s: getting further further further in the money, that the market makers have plenty of time,
495.80s: especially in this scenario with the recent equity offering to scoop up.
499.00s: Their protection as needed to fully hedge these positions as they would want.
503.00s: That's my guess.
504.20s: Shell game could be going on again, really, really difficult to tell.
508.40s: We have to wait and see exactly how the price behaves going forward.
513.20s: So another wild day, another really busy day for game stop in terms of volatility.
519.20s: We see again, this crazy expansion.
522.00s: So I'm going to be keeping a really close eye on it to see where we go from here.
526.20s: As always, if you have any questions or anything you want me to take a look at,
529.40s: let me know.
530.40s: I love looking at this stuff with you guys.
532.60s: See you all later.
