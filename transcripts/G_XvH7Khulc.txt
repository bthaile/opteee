0.00s: What's up everyone? Happy Monday. We're going to take a look at the GameStop options chain.
5.40s: Couple of things going on. Nothing really jumping out of me just yet. It seems we're vastly
10.00s: kind of in this consolidation phase. But before we get too far into that, just a couple
14.00s: of announcements. The first one is if you haven't seen this video with Ian on James Lee's
19.70s: channel, it's very good. And I really like the way that he breaks down a lot of the
27.06s: totality of the story. It's a very simple concept. So if you haven't had a chance to listen
33.40s: to this, I think it's worth worth the listen. It's like 15 minutes. The other one that I
38.52s: actually think you need to watch is Newton's new video. And it's not just because he has
42.74s: some super sick hair that's on fleek with Snorlax behind him. It's because he talks a
48.58s: little bit towards the end of this video about the swaps. This is important. And I actually
53.66s: think that this is something I've been doing more research on myself. So it's funny timing
57.58s: that he was talking about it here because it talks about the positions that we think some
64.34s: of these different actors and entities might be in. And then the way that they need to move
69.74s: about these positions with respect to GameStop price. So absolutely worth checking this out.
75.50s: All right. That aside. And the actually the last thing is this Saturday, same time, same
80.86s: place, 1700 Pacific time. He and I are going to do another live stream so that we can go even
86.22s: further into detail. This past weekend was a really great introduction. I had a hard stop. So we
91.26s: didn't get to go super far into the weeds on things. So the goal for this next one is to spend
96.70s: a lot more time looking at the details and then also setting a little time to active analysis.
103.34s: Right? Like see how this story is actively playing out. There's so much history that has to
108.38s: get gone through in order to level set everybody. So we got a good bit of that done last weekend.
113.26s: And yeah, I'm looking forward to connecting with him again. I learned literally a ton. It is a great
118.70s: time being able to kind of be a part of this with you guys. All right. Over to the GameStop.
124.30s: As I've said, consolidation. That's really the main thing I'm seeing here. We hit a swing low
129.18s: on the first of July. And the low here is 2231. And we've kind of just been in this 2227 and a half
137.10s: range. And the one thing I do notice though is that we are up trending slightly. Even more
143.90s: interestingly as this, we have pretty light volume. I'll get myself out of the way. We've
150.06s: pretty light volume in here. However, even though the majority of this volume actually is cell volume
158.46s: for both of these days, notice what price is doing. Not going down. It's actually going up a little
165.26s: bit. That's anomalous. That's abnormal. And there's a lot of reasons why that can happen.
172.86s: But this could be a kind of the start of a new catalyst is what I'm seeing here. When you see
182.14s: volume dying off this much with something like GameStop that you know in general, people try to
187.82s: short this into oblivion. The fact that even after we had that share offering and price didn't
193.18s: plummet, the fact that now we still have really light relative volume that's mostly cell volume
199.18s: and prices still not going down. Very interesting to me. So this is the kind of thing I would keep
205.34s: a really close eye on. I actually have another alert and scan set up specifically around a
211.82s: little, a lot of different volume conditions in GameStop. And this is one of them I'm paying very
216.22s: close attention to right now. Let's take a look at the options. All right. First things first,
222.30s: the expiration volatility is very low. This is some of the lowest that we've seen since I've started
227.90s: looking at this about a month ago, kind of very regularly with you guys. And I find that
233.98s: curious, especially from where we ended last week with a little bit of an expansion of volatility
239.50s: leading into a holiday week, which is also not normal. A lot of things not normal here.
247.18s: So yeah, I thought that was interesting. I'm going to skip the ball thing for now and I want to
251.74s: talk to you about the open interest first. So after we had the last option expiration cycle,
259.98s: op-x on last week, we know a residual call OI of 750,000 calls versus 456 K puts. Very heavy call
271.02s: volume still. And if we take a look at where they're centered, most of them are actually in 19 July,
278.78s: not 12 July, which is again, slightly anomalous because the vast majority of OI that I've seen so far
285.42s: has been in the near term expiration, even if that near term expiration happens to be a weekly.
292.06s: Now again, in normal options world, you would expect the majority of OI and volume to happen in these
299.26s: monthly expiration cycles because they're more liquid. Now, if we take a look at the volume though,
305.50s: notice what happens here? There's way more of these blue dots, which I guess they're rectangles,
313.42s: not so much dots. I do know my shapes. The 12 July cycle though is much more prevalent here as compared
322.94s: to the 19 July cycle, which again are the purple squares. Now, what does that mean to me? Well,
330.86s: it means that people are really speculating in these very short term time frames. That's with the
337.42s: guys of trying to maximize exposure to some degree to a near term event. That's the only reason
344.22s: why you would come all the way in here and trade and stuff that's for DTE as compared to going
348.38s: a little further out is that you expect something imminently. Now, when we look at the relative volume
355.82s: between those two series, 12 July saw 88,000 calls versus 19 July, which is 41,000 calls. So still,
365.42s: there's calls skew on both of these relatives to the put side, but there's definitely more activity in
369.58s: these 12 Julys, even though the majority of OI still falls in this 19 July cycle with 270,000 calls
378.22s: versus 100,000 calls. So people are playing the short term, but there is a building and growing position
386.46s: out in the next expiration cycle here in 19 July. Now, a quick stroll through TNS shows a few things.
394.94s: I have this limited to calls and I have this limited to things that are at least 50 contracts
401.58s: above. And right now, I'm specifically looking at, put my head here, 12 July and 19 July, these
407.98s: front two explorations. I guess we could add 16 August if we want just for the next primary
411.82s: expiration. And what do we see? Well, there's a good bit of activity, both in 12 and 19 July at the
419.10s: 25 and 30s. I see that all the way through when I kind of scroll through this larger data set.
426.30s: Now, the other thing a couple of people have said that this is a little difficult to use, which I get,
431.34s: my eyes are kind of trained to it, but I also have it pulled up here on unusual whales. So this is
437.10s: looking at just for July. Now, for unusual whales, you have to be careful because what we don't want
442.70s: is stuff that's tied into a multiple like option strategies, like spreads, vertical stuff like that.
447.58s: It doesn't really matter for us. So let's limit this then to kind of these front expiration cycles
455.10s: and see what's going on coming up. I have this limited to premium being at least $15,000,
460.54s: which I actually argue is still very, very small. But I'm using that to see if there's anybody building
466.46s: consistent positions over multiple time frames. And there's some of that, but not much. So what I
472.86s: mean by that is like, if you look at these blocks in here, these 30 calls get hit a few times at
480.14s: similar size as 24 25 K. And they're not necessarily, you know, spread across weeks. It's kind of like
488.54s: a day over day sort of movement. But yeah, it's not necessarily like a massive position being built.
496.06s: These big positions up here, then 198 K, the 140 K, they're part of more legs, which means it off
502.06s: set risks, offsets risk. I'm not as interested in those positions. I'm interested in things that
509.34s: display conviction in a direction, which is essentially buying calls near the offer or above.
515.02s: That's what I care about. So the tens, what, there's 56 of the tens. So these are in the money
524.06s: for this coming week. That's $80,000 position. That's not a small position. And this is one that I'm
530.38s: keeping an eye on to see if there's any subsequent build out in it. But so far, it's relatively quiet
537.50s: beyond what we saw here. So if we take a look at 0633, I think this is specific time. It is
545.58s: specific time. We had this first tranche go through, then at 0630, I'm sorry, this 0630, this was the
553.10s: first one. This was the second one. My expectation is that this is probably the same entity buying these.
559.42s: And that's primarily because it's very specific, very close to one another. This is typically how
563.98s: you would phase into a position. You'd get a feel for what the market is. And then you would try
568.70s: to scale in the rest of the way. Then we see it again down here at 0640, 0633. There's 26 of them
578.54s: at the 10. So again, like if you just kind of add the numbers up on these, they start to
586.14s: build a not insignificant position. There's more here at the 10 0630.
594.22s: And I think that's mostly what I saw. Yeah. So let's take a look. I want to sort this by time
602.14s: really quick. And we can take a look at those 10s. This is exactly what I'm talking about.
606.46s: See, there's a bunch of these blocks like right next to one another. There's 0630, 06 twice
613.42s: for 43 and 26. Then there's these two 0630s at 46. Again, like the and these are all direct trades,
623.34s: right? They're not part of a spread. These are very interesting to me because this is not a small
629.50s: cumulative position. So let's take a look really quick at the 12 July 10s, which are all the way in
639.10s: here. Super deep in the money. And interestingly enough, this accounts, there's 160 volume in
651.02s: there today. And if we go back to these transactions, I think this is like 150. So this person,
660.22s: whoever this is, is building out the majority of that position. And again, this is not in
665.74s: insignificant position. This is over $200,000, essentially in total. So that's something to keep an
673.18s: eye on. That is not being put on with anything other than the expectation of an upmove.
678.46s: Is that somebody like we're in kitty. It's hard to say. It seems like a little bit of a smaller
683.26s: position to him, but this is somebody with $200,000. So it's also probably somebody that I would
688.94s: imagine to be fairly informed also because they went so deep in the money. They want leveraged
694.46s: deltas. That's what that is. That's why they're using essentially one delta options. There's very
699.98s: little extrinsic value to bleed away. And this is a directional play to the upside. So this is a
705.50s: big position being built out here at the tens to keep an eye on. That is mostly what I see in here.
712.86s: When I took a look at the volume and the volatility smile, the volume is interesting. The volatility
722.06s: smiles also fairly interesting because we have some of these kinks. But the put side is still
727.18s: trending way higher than the call side in both near term series, which is what we have seen as
732.38s: of late. So this isn't messaging to me any excessive vol pricing on the call side,
739.34s: factoring and some sort of expectation of upside move. This is standard puts you in terms of
745.02s: vol on the volatility smiles. So as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Keep an eye
751.82s: ball on these 12 July tens because there's somebody building a sneakingly pretty large position
758.70s: in there. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
