0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my favorite green caricature
6.76s: hanging out, Duneberg. Great to see you. Eric, great to be back. And I'm looking forward
11.04s: to another robust discussion. And if our preamble before you hit record is end indication,
15.00s: this is going to be a good one. Yeah, which fun fact for everybody. We were talking a
18.36s: little bit about creative process and Duneberg has a very cool creative process, kind of
24.20s: like what I've heard from different kinds of authors and stuff. And we were just talking
28.48s: a little bit about the way that people build that together. Because you have an interesting
32.36s: production schedule. Have you talked about that before with people or no? I think I may
35.52s: have on a short, too, but I'm happy to repeat it. Yeah, we're on a four day treadmill.
39.44s: I think I was telling you and we have to research right, edit, publish, promote, and defend
45.16s: a piece roughly every four days. We do about eight a month, depending on the month. Our
50.20s: target is six to eight. But we're since we left Twitter, we have a lot more time in our
54.00s: hands since how we've been reaching the upper bound of that objective. And for me personally,
59.72s: I've always been a very systematic sleeper. The difference between sort of naps and
64.48s: full-saleed cycles and those kinds of things. And I paid close attention to it. And I found
68.84s: that my body and my brain coalesced best overnight. And so I'll typically do most of the writing
76.12s: for Duneberg between two and five a.m. depending on when I go to bed and what else I have going
82.04s: on. And that's worked very well for me personally. It doesn't work for everybody. But the brain
87.32s: is clear. The house is quiet. The phone is dead. Everyone else is asleep. And you kind
93.12s: of also feel like you're getting one up on everybody, you know, like a little bit of a productivity
96.52s: hack. So for me, I'll typically sleep two cycles, get up, work, two or three hours, bang
102.64s: out a piece, and then go back to bed for another cycle or a few naps. A nap is about 20 minutes
108.24s: for me. And a full sleep cycle is about an hour and 42 minutes. And they're very different
114.60s: experiences. But the body, you know, derives value from both. And being systematic about
120.04s: when you sleep and when you work is one of the significant benefits of writing your own
125.56s: business and being able to set your own schedule. And we're very disciplined about not
129.04s: taking meetings and putting aside time to be creative. It's what we're paid to do. So
134.36s: it's nice that when your bank account is aligned with what's best for your body and your
139.16s: brain.
140.16s: Yeah, that's huge. And I think one of the coolest things about that that you highlight
144.04s: is just the process of like finding what works for you because as we were kind of discussing
149.36s: and just for a few moments, I find it really interesting when I read about different authors
154.96s: and, you know, people who write and all the different kinds of things that they do to
159.04s: get into their groove. It's always interesting to me how that goes.
162.40s: Yeah, I'm a big believer in optimizing your micro environment as well because you spend
169.02s: almost all of your time in your micro environment. And look, you can't really do this if you're
173.24s: in a job or if your schedule is beholden to somebody else's needs. We're very, very
180.92s: disciplined about what meetings we take, which is basically nonexept podcasts and putting
186.12s: aside time for creativity. And we did this before Doomer became successful, but now that
191.28s: it has become successful, there's just nothing that could convince us to change the way
196.76s: we go about things. And, you know, we're at 330 articles into this journey. And we've
203.40s: got the steps down to pretty much a science at this point. Again, for those who have created
209.84s: for a living, that treadmill is real. And it could either tire you out and cause you
216.84s: to burn out or you can embrace and rearrange the rest of your life to embrace the challenge
222.72s: of it. And for me, it's just, I couldn't imagine doing anything else now after having done
226.96s: this for three and a half years.
228.48s: Yeah, yeah, I totally get that. And speaking of sleep schedules and whatnot, what did you
235.20s: think of the election? Were you up all night for that or how'd that go?
240.00s: Well, the decisive moments happened to go inside with when I would typically be up. And so
245.12s: yeah, I was.
246.12s: Perfect.
247.12s: Online when the races were called, at least by Fox and by decision desk HQ and sort of less
253.76s: partisan news outlets. I think the outcome was both profound and predictable. I think
262.24s: the Democrats did themselves in when Joe Biden, who you may remember when he was elected
268.28s: in 2020, basically ran as not Trump caretaker won't run again. That's kind of a forgotten
275.16s: detail of how 2020 came to be. And the moment Biden decided to run again, whichever of the
281.00s: Biden's decided it. And went back on that promise, it robbed the Democrats of a true open
289.00s: primary to have the voters select the best candidate. It was very clear to me and to anybody
294.80s: who was objective that Biden was beginning to suffer serious cognitive decline even back
298.84s: in 2020. There's no way he could have continued to run in 2024. That was very clear. And
305.24s: in fact, when I saw that the first debate was scheduled so early, I had a hunch that maybe
309.96s: those in the DNC who knew for a fact what was going on maybe wanted to create that moment
316.60s: where they could interview any convincing belief. But by the time they did, it was too late
321.84s: to have anybody but Harris as their nominee. And I think winning the primary is essential
330.44s: practice and essential an essential exercise in winning the general. Trump for all his baggage
339.28s: is now a three time winner of the Republican primary and a two time winner of the general
345.48s: election. He would probably argue that he's a three time winner. But Harris received no votes
352.12s: and was anointed. And I think that really mattered. And look, when you have a razor thin electric,
357.08s: like we do, you know, the difference between Trump winning versus Biden winning or in this
364.04s: case, Harris winning versus Trump winning is a few percentage points. And the way the DNC went
371.24s: about initially selecting and then coordinating its ultimate nominee had to be worth two to three
377.32s: points to the negative. And that's a decisive swing in our politics. Look, for all the talk of
384.28s: landslide, red wave and mandates. I mean, it's still plus or minus four or five points, either way,
392.36s: the vast majority of people voted the same. A few people changed their votes or showed up or
397.80s: didn't show up. And now we have a completely different world. And I think as the next piece,
402.84s: we publish will outline Trump's victory and mandate and popular vote victory in particular,
409.72s: combined with the fact that he is a far more effective president now than he would have been if
414.76s: he had won in 2020, having had four years to ponder what went wrong and what he would do differently,
419.80s: for example. And the fact that he's unencumbered by the need to occasionally soften his views out
427.24s: of political expediency because he's not writing again. This is one and done for him. He is going to be a
433.00s: decisive and transformative president, especially in the first two years with Republican
437.72s: control of the Senate and likely control of the House. And there's going to be deeply meaningful
442.60s: things. Look, one of the things we've warned our friends on the progressive left about for years,
446.52s: as you should not concentrate too much power or affect change amongst the agenda and as you
451.48s: care about through executive action, because it's not going to be forever that you control the
455.48s: presidency. And now there were nightmare, the impotentment of all the things that they proclaim
462.84s: to oppose, not only has a mandate to power the pen, but a decisive ambition that he is going
472.36s: to execute with vigor. And it's going to be a shocking couple of years for those on the left in
478.52s: our view. What did you make of the the actual announcement and outcome of the election? One of the
486.20s: things that I was a little surprised by, not even so looking back, is I genuinely thought that the
493.56s: race was going to be a lot closer than it was just based on what I've heard. I always know that when
500.20s: you hear different media sources talking about it, obviously they're going to have their bias and
503.96s: their slants. The market seemed to have Trump pretty much pinned. You can look at equities,
509.32s: bonds, leading into the election, prediction markets, all had him. So that seemed to be a generally
516.60s: expected outcome just from a financial markets perspective, but still the talking points where
521.32s: this was going to be very close. And it wasn't. Did that? Yeah. So I'll tell you an issue,
527.32s: anecdote for me. So I live in a swing state. And prior to the election, I was getting 30 to 40
533.32s: texts a day, super knowing, right? And even though I like those random numbers and stuff. Oh yeah,
538.44s: Kamala Harris says ABC. You know, so I, I, I, I religiously blocked them or for all of them,
544.60s: but didn't see the slow things down. And then about a week before the election, I managed to vote
550.44s: early. And within hours of voting, the tech stopped. Like almost none. There was a few local
559.32s: texts, but no presidential texts, maybe one or two over a period of days where I was getting
565.24s: dozens every day. And that was very, I'll have a moment for me. The campaigns knew it's exactly how
572.84s: they were doing moment by moment. They could see early voting. Now they don't know who I voted for,
578.92s: but they know what party I'm registered to vote with in the primaries. And they know the other
582.84s: aspects of my demographic background to the point where they can model with, you know, 90 plus
587.96s: percent certainty, who I probably voted for. And knowing that the campaigns were in possession of
596.28s: an extraordinarily granular amount of data about how things were going, I then watched the body
603.24s: language of the two candidates in the final four or five days. And it was very clear to me that
610.04s: Harris was despondent, the Langry, whereas Trump was, who was always somewhat optimistic, was
620.36s: very optimistic as body language. If you just watched the two candidates with a sound off,
625.24s: you could see the body language between the two was stark. The difference between them was stark.
630.84s: And I noted with interest that Harris really only visited Pennsylvania on the last day,
635.80s: whereas Trump did his typical four rallies, 18 hours flying all over the country, finished in
641.24s: Grand Rapids, Michigan at 2 a.m. I believe. This was a guy running through the tape. And Harris
650.04s: struck me as somebody hoping for it to end. And so that, and again, people will say that I'm just
658.76s: being biased. But I think if a neutral observer would say that there was a pronounced
663.08s: fall off in Harris' body language in the last week as the early return data was coming in. And
668.52s: this was my hunch was buttressed by the actual early returns as they came in and were reported
674.28s: during the day on the fifth. So, and even with all of that, it still was very close. Like, you know,
679.64s: Pennsylvania difference 2 percent, Michigan difference, I think it's a point a half. Arizona looks
684.36s: like it's going to be somewhere less than that. So we're not talking about a huge amount. But
689.32s: back to my earlier point, like the way in which the DNC selected and then reselected its candidate
695.40s: probably hurt them enough to be decisive.
699.96s: Yeah. I think the specifically the point on the lead in is pretty pertinent. I also thought it was
708.04s: interesting. I don't know how impactful just from a personal curiosity standpoint. I'm curious
713.96s: your thought on Harris not doing the Joe Rogan podcast when they try to line that up. What do
722.84s: you think about that? Yeah, I think, you know, Taylor Lorenz was out with an interesting
727.72s: piece this morning. She's a former reporter at the Washington Post and now, full-time substacker,
732.68s: I think. There is an entire alternative media ecosystem on the right that the left just doesn't
739.32s: have. And so it isn't really that she didn't go on Joe Rogan. It's that the left doesn't have a
744.36s: Joe Rogan. Now, I think Lorenz's piece totally mischaracterizes the real issue. The real issue is
749.80s: the right has created this alternative media ecosystem in reaction to the fact that the vast
754.92s: majority of the traditional media system is dominated by the left with the possible exception of
760.20s: Fox. But like CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post, LA Times, New York Times, these are all
769.16s: decidedly liberal news outlets. And so the sort of echoes of Rush Limbaugh that we now see with
775.32s: the Benny Johnson's of the world and now the Joe Rogan's of the world were created out of necessity.
783.16s: And this entire ecosystem, which I think Trump used masterfully during the campaign, he went on
788.36s: basically every podcast that would have him. And this was underrated. You know, Harris was doing
793.48s: the traditional Facebook, Google ads, Blitz spending hundreds of millions of dollars. Whereas Trump
799.72s: was just, you know, gathering up engagements after engagements and listening to somebody in a
805.00s: podcast is a great engagement. And he went on all the big shows and she didn't have a Joe Rogan to
811.96s: go on. She was invited, he was invited on to Joe Rogan now. That's not a format that plays to
818.44s: her strength before being totally honest, right? But by the way, that's the type of thing you could
824.60s: have sniffed out in an open primary, which they did the last time around when she didn't even make
828.76s: it to Iowa. And so back to my earlier point, I mean, I think it was fatal that the DNC just decided
836.36s: that Biden could run again without a primary. And then by the way, they actively opposed, you know,
841.72s: our FK juniors run, which he has, I think, accurately documented for all to see his swinging over
847.40s: the Trump was worth a few points too. Let's be honest. And again, in a in a six point swing,
852.84s: two points is 33% of the variance. Right? I mean, it doesn't take too many blow changes or the
858.60s: outcome to be as decisive as what we saw on Tuesday. One of the things that makes the US presidential
865.96s: election so emotional is that, you know, it truly is a deeply polarized country. The outcome is
876.12s: winner takes all, regardless of the size of the vote differential. And the position has been the
883.96s: recipient of ever growing delegations of authority far outside what the constitutional framers envisioned.
891.32s: So the point where who occupies the president is a decisively powerful thing. And so when a couple
897.32s: of thousand votes in a county that few have ever heard of makes all the difference because of the
902.44s: chaotic nature of the election systems in the various states, it becomes a very violent tug of war.
911.96s: And we see this played out. We're personally just very glad that a decisive outcome was reached. I
918.04s: mean, I think a contested election would have been a catastrophe to those in the left. A Trump
923.80s: victory is a catastrophe and vice versa on the right. But in our view, the only real catastrophe on
929.24s: the board was a contested and protracted legal case around who won the election.
934.76s: I'm pleased to agree. Now, thinking a little bit more about the election, when you look at some of
943.16s: the different implications of policy, if you were to segment it into kind of like a near-term
951.16s: impact, longer term impact, near term being maybe six months in within just to define it. And then
957.32s: long term greater than six months out to five years. Plus, what are some of the primary themes that
963.88s: you're looking at under the new context, understanding that House and Senate still TBD and will
970.28s: impact stuff to a degree for everybody wondering today's the seventh. The Senate is not TBD,
977.56s: but the House is still mildly so, although the prediction markets still have the Republicans
981.56s: at 85% chance of getting over the line. And if they do get over the line and be by a race within
986.92s: margin, and so basically a replay of what we just had, I don't really view it as short and long-term
992.84s: because what we're seeing in the short term is the repricing of the long-term effects of what's
996.04s: about to transpire. So I'd rather just talk about the major themes that we see. And the one we're
1002.76s: running about next is that this is the end of climate change as a defining narrative in our
1008.68s: political discourse. Trump is going to kneecap the carbon agenda. He thinks it's a scam and a
1016.44s: hoax. And by the way, what he thinks is way more important than what me or you are anybody listening
1023.32s: thinks. And so we're just trying to appraise what he thinks, not necessarily judge it. I think
1028.92s: you just need to understand where the man's head is if you're going to model and invest and
1033.80s: reposition yourself to the facts as they are on the board, not as how you wish them to be. So I
1038.68s: with that disclaimer, Trump in 2012 tweeted that he thought that climate change was a hoax manifested
1046.28s: by and for China until we can and make the U.S. manufacturing sector non-competitive. That is
1051.40s: his view. He views the world as a great struggle economically between the U.S. and China. He wants to
1057.72s: make things big beautiful things in the U.S. And China has tricked the naive former leaders of the
1064.20s: country into thinking climate change is a real thing. He doesn't care about climate change. And he
1070.92s: is going to lead accordingly. And so what does that mean in all practicality? It means
1078.52s: all the EPA regulations against power plants coming off the board. It means
1085.32s: drill baby drill. It's back in style. It means higher oil and gas production. All things being
1092.04s: equal much lower oil and gas prices. Bad for oil and gas equities. Good for oil and gas service
1098.68s: providers. He wants to make things in America again. There's going to be a huge investment boom
1106.36s: in the U.S. But most importantly, if you press them based on my own experience, the vast majority
1112.20s: of C-suite executives at major companies in the U.S. don't actually think climate change is a big deal.
1117.08s: And certainly don't think they should reorient their entire strategies around it and have been
1120.92s: kind of just playing along to get along. On the subject and Trump, I believe, is going to give them
1127.56s: all of the protection they need to express their true views on the topic. And I think
1134.92s: key milestone for us. It gives you something to look at on the board next week.
1138.92s: COP29 in Niger-Brijan is next week. We marked COP28 last year in the United Arab Emirates as
1146.52s: peak ESG. You're going to see less than a third of the number of people attending this meeting
1152.92s: that we saw at the same event last year. I think the air is coming out of the climate balloon.
1157.56s: As we say in this piece, Trump likes his numbers to go up. And if carbon emissions are among them,
1166.20s: so be it. That's what he's going to be. We're going to roll the dice on climate. China has never
1171.24s: really cared about climate change. It has laughed the U.S. in carbon emissions. I think it's the
1177.00s: most important chart on the board. We published on notes this morning, which is the
1181.96s: the annual carbon emissions from China and the U.S. on the same plot. You could see that the U.S.
1187.64s: has been left to declining since 2000. China has been up and to the right. And to the extent that
1193.64s: CO2 emissions are a proxy for manufacturing intensity. And the lack of increasing emissions in the
1199.16s: U.S. is a proxy for the rusting out of the Midwest. Trump's going to change that. And so there's
1206.28s: going to be a lot of howling on the left. But because the left mainly has over the years worked to
1214.92s: make the power of the presidential pen and the weight of executive orders so so meaningful.
1222.36s: They have now found themselves in a worst case scenario where a man that they despise
1229.32s: who was removed from office in a contest of election in 2020 has had four years to ponder what he
1235.56s: did wrong and how to do better. And all of the mistakes that he made both in the last
1241.64s: term of his, you know, the first term as president in the last election. He is a way more effective
1248.04s: president now than he would have been if he had won in 2020. And that's what's about to transpire
1254.12s: in our view in the next year. That's the biggest one on the board. There's all other policy
1257.80s: things we talk about too. But, you know, carbon and energy are really, really
1263.16s: central to the economy. And Trump has been very clear on what he intends to do. And I think
1269.32s: people in the left are going to be shocked by what transpires in the next six months.
1274.76s: What are your thoughts on the 60% era of Chinese imports?
1281.08s: Yeah, he's going to do all those things. All of this will catalyze an investment boom in the US.
1288.20s: Let's be very clear. It's not all great. Trump likes the numbers to go up. That means Trump is
1294.04s: an inflationary force. And the long bond is telling you that. And I think the US is still
1302.36s: in a very viscally dangerous place with interest payments,
1309.40s: passing a trillion dollars a year and a trillion dollars in debt going on the books every quarter.
1313.96s: The rules of the game have changed, but Trump's views on how the game should be played have not.
1320.92s: And so he's going to print. He's going to try to grow. He's going to build big beautiful things.
1329.40s: He's going to push Powell to lower interest rates. He wants the stock market to go up. He wants GDP
1335.72s: to go up. He wants nominal paychecks to go up. And he wants gas prices to go down. Right? I mean,
1341.72s: these are very simplistic anchors of his worldview, but they should not be ignored.
1347.56s: It's what he's going to do. And so in our view, inflationary hedges are going to be in high demand.
1356.60s: In the long term, that means things like gold should do well. But there's going to be a boom in the US.
1363.24s: There's just no question about it. He will
1366.04s: through just the pen, let alone if the house comes on board. Look, if he has the house to send it,
1370.60s: the pen and the Supreme Court, I mean, the next two years are going to be a blitz of
1377.00s: right-wing wish list items, one after the other being knocked out. And it's going to be a
1384.68s: shocking realization to the left as to what the power of a president who has been both,
1391.88s: you know, distilled in the cauldron of political upheaval and skilled in the art of
1399.80s: of having learned from his prior experiences, it's going to be far more profound than even what
1403.80s: the market is predicting. And that's why I think, for example, the solar ETF, I think it's 10,
1408.92s: was down to something like 15% in the morning of the election. These are big four or five sigma
1414.68s: moves on the board that we're seeing a total realignment given the the nature of the Republican
1420.36s: Trump in this cycle. Specifically for the tariffs, the path of that is really of interest to me,
1429.24s: and when I say path, just the protocol that it's implemented with, because that kind of thing,
1434.52s: obviously, essentially, basically, I can know what you know this matter. It's basically just
1440.76s: going to be passed on to the consumer. And I'm wondering if you have a perspective on the way that
1447.88s: something like a 60% tariff on Chinese goods could look in terms of implementation and then
1453.16s: therefore impact. It's a blunt instrument to be sure. And passed on to consumer is a temporary
1460.28s: thing until domestic supply comes online. The thing that I can't quite square is how this all
1466.44s: works with a stronger dollar, which was the initial market reaction, you know, to his to his victory.
1473.88s: So I think the US dollar has to get much weaker over time if Trump is going to get his way.
1478.20s: Like when you think about the things that foster and protect a domestic manufacturing supply chain,
1485.80s: it's a weak currency and protection of tariffs. And those are the things that need to happen. And
1491.08s: in particular, US dollar needs to get substantially weaker against China's currency in order for
1496.28s: the playing field to become substantially equalized. But Trump is also a strong US dollar type guy as well.
1503.40s: So there are some inconsistencies that look Trump is in the name of right. I mean, let's just
1507.08s: let's be clear. Like the man is a force of nature. I think his stamina, persistence, and ability to
1515.08s: shake off extreme criticism are pretty unique in the history of our politics. Whatever you think of
1521.32s: the man, he is the energizer bunny of American politics and totally agnostic to the most dastardly
1529.72s: accusations and slanders of his character, right. I mean, how many times do we have to call somebody
1535.16s: Hitler in our politics? Like can we be done with that already? But nonetheless, he just seems
1542.28s: totally oblivious to it all. And I think that's part of what makes him so attractive to everyday
1550.04s: Americans. So he is a highly underrated, very talented retail politician. He connects with
1558.44s: average voters in a way that those among the more elite in the country failed to comprehend because he is
1566.28s: so orthogonal to the behavior patterns, acceptable behavior patterns and their social circles that
1572.52s: they think it must be that everyone else would reject him too, but it just simply isn't true.
1578.04s: And I can't say that I fully understand it, but I could tell you I once was in the vicinity of
1582.60s: once of his rallies of one of his rallies. And I was totally shocked by what I saw. Like,
1588.12s: what did you see? I saw waves of red and flags and everyday normal Americans
1597.32s: coming out for a politician with enthusiasm and affection that has been unprecedented,
1605.16s: like not even Reagan, of this is such a response from from everyday Americans. And you see it like
1612.36s: the unions coming out and voting for him in droves, even though their leadership didn't want to
1616.12s: endorse them. Like that's sort of a classic example. But like Trump is a rich guy in a suit with a
1622.52s: very long tie and plumbers and firefighters and police officers. They love them. He invokes
1634.44s: a deeply visceral loyalty and enthusiasm that no other politician of our time
1640.84s: comes close. I think Obama did, but not with a different demographic.
1648.76s: I live in flyover country and I could just tell you that these people would walk over glass to
1653.16s: vote for him. And they did. They turned out again. You have to tip his hat. I don't know
1660.28s: quite what it is. Like he's just got like, look, whatever you think of the McDonald's and
1665.16s: garbage trucks stunts. I mean, when I went to go out, there were people standing in line wearing
1672.28s: colored vests. And when I drove by the voting station on my way into the office on election day,
1680.20s: there was an enormous number of pickup trucks in the parking lot. He just connects in a way
1687.00s: that Harris couldn't. And politics is about passion and momentum.
1695.72s: Speaking of the momentum element of just his brand and his platform,
1702.20s: what do you think the first 60 days of his presidency are going to be focused on specifically
1708.76s: from an economic standpoint? It's going to be a blitz. It's going to be deregulation,
1714.92s: especially in the energy sector. It's going to be tariffs and it's going to be, I think,
1721.00s: RFK Jr. is going to get a free hand on the sort of health agenda. I noted with interest that
1727.80s: in the euphoria of the 1500 point rally in the Dow day after election day, one company was
1735.00s: ominous in its failure to participate. And that was Pfizer. Pfizer was down on the day or flat.
1740.44s: Unch, as you might say, that was very curious to me. Solar being down 15%
1748.92s: Pfizer unchanged and everything else to the moon. So it tells you the market believes that Trump
1754.52s: is going to do what he says he's going to do. But they're hedging on the power of the pharmaceutical
1759.24s: companies because they're just so omnipresent in all of the sort of political donation cycles
1765.00s: and all of that other stuff and in the media cycles as well. I do think that there is a significant
1770.68s: risk that is being underappreciated, which is RFK Jr. is going to target pharmaceutical
1776.68s: company advertising and getting it banned in the US, which would be a one two punch because it'll
1780.36s: be a death blow to the quote unquote traditional media or mainstream media that Trump hates so much.
1785.16s: You take away pharmaceutical advertising from ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN. These companies are going
1791.48s: to be in the heart locker. And so we're seeing a lot of angst amongst our contacts in the pharmaceutical
1797.48s: industry. The traditional media is still trying to figure out how this phenomenon could happen.
1804.28s: They have no idea how out of touch they are with the exact same people I just described as
1808.60s: willing to walk over glass to vote for Trump. It's gotten to the point now where if something is
1813.40s: published in the traditional media, not only is it not believed by the people I just described,
1819.72s: they immediately assume the opposite must be true. We've written a piece that we haven't published
1826.76s: on Ivermectin, for example. The moment the press started making fun of those taking Ivermectin,
1832.04s: everyone assumed it must be really effective against COVID. And there's just this
1837.16s: this real knee jerk response to whatever it is that the man on CNN is telling me the exact opposite
1842.36s: must be true. And that is a dangerous place for society, but it's where we are.
1849.88s: Do you think that there's some sort of intervention or interaction with Ukraine is real
1855.88s: those conflicts? Yeah, our initial response is this is a very bearish development for Ukraine.
1863.16s: Let's not forget that they once impeached Trump on Ukraine. And it's not like he doesn't know what's
1868.84s: actually going on over there. I think he is a person who has an affinity for and respect for
1874.92s: strong men. And Putin certainly falls in that category as does GCPing, we should say.
1881.00s: And he's really interested in fighting and winning an economic war with China.
1888.20s: I think he would view the Ukraine Russia war as a distraction.
1893.72s: The challenge that we see in the Ukraine situation is Trump is a little naive when it comes to his
1901.24s: appraisal of the leverage the US currently has in that situation. And the type of deal that the
1906.28s: Russians would be willing to accept after two and a half years of conflict with NATO.
1913.72s: I don't really see where Trump to get a deal that he can sell as being an outproduct of his
1922.92s: violent negotiation skills, at least his self-assumed negotiation skills. And I think the Russians
1928.12s: are aware of who Trump is and have decided that they're not going to be fooled again,
1935.48s: quote unquote, their view, not mine, on cutting another deal with the West, that the West ultimately
1943.80s: re-niggs upon in the years ahead. So I don't think that Trump is going to be able to stop the war
1950.84s: in Ukraine as easily as he thinks he can. But Ukraine is in a very precarious spot. And Trump's
1957.48s: election could cause a morale crisis amongst the troops in Ukraine that could make all of it moot,
1962.52s: because the Russians have been gaining sort of rather rapidly in the past few months. As
1967.56s: it pertains to Israel and Iran, that's a harder one for us to model. He has a unique
1976.52s: history with Iran, and a closeness with Netanyahu allegedly, although I thought when he left
1983.64s: office in 2020 that he and Netanyahu were a bit on the outs, but they seem to be
1988.44s: back in good graces with each other now. Netanyahu certainly seemed to welcome Trump's ascension,
1994.36s: but we shall see. I think if you take the big picture, one of the things that Trump regularly
2000.36s: bragged about on the campaign trail was he had no wars during his first term. Now, he inherited
2006.36s: existing wars, Afghanistan in particular, but there were no new conflicts started while he was
2011.40s: president. And I think he views himself as a champion of peace through strength, the classic sort of
2017.08s: Reagan mold, whether he has enough strength to impose peace both in Ukraine and in the Middle
2023.40s: East remains to be seen. Although I would note with some interest that we've seen a few reports
2028.60s: like the Houthis unilaterally deciding to end their campaign in the Red Sea. I don't know if
2032.68s: that's true. I saw it on Twitter and Hamas calling for a ceasefire now that Trump has won the election.
2039.00s: But time will tell, I think I would not personally be surprised to see Trump and Putin meeting in
2044.92s: person. Shortly after Trump takes office to try to iron out a grand bargain, that will of course
2053.56s: horrify people in the collective West and the sort of the neo-continuing of the US political scene.
2060.76s: Trump wants to bring these wars to an end. He wants to focus his efforts on an economic war with
2066.04s: China. I don't think he wants a military conflict with China. By the way, he would like to
2070.92s: be a peace candidate who brought economic prosperity back to the, you know, lunchpale joes of America.
2079.08s: And escalating in either Ukraine or the Middle East doesn't serve that agenda.
2085.00s: Now, when you look at the interaction though between Ukraine, Russia, how long the conflict has
2096.92s: been going, have you modeled even a loose idea of what an agreement could likely look like?
2107.64s: I think that the, so one of the things I tried myself on doing is reading the local propaganda
2113.16s: of all the parties involved. Because you have to understand what they're telling themselves to
2117.64s: model the degrees of freedom they have in a negotiated settlement, for example. And people often mistake,
2126.28s: or have the mistaken assumption that Putin is Russia and that he's the only person that matters
2130.68s: in Russia. That's not true. He exists in a political system. He has allies. He has adversaries. He has
2137.16s: people who might be angling for his job like every other country. And he has certain
2142.76s: limitations in his degrees of freedom. I think the two sides are astronomically far apart.
2149.00s: And Russia has stated its intent to impose a solution militarily and to dare the US or NATO to do
2154.92s: anything about it. Unless and until the US, IE Trump is willing to escalate to a nuclear conflict
2162.28s: in our view, not being military experts, but having followed the conflict very closely, especially
2166.52s: since the beginning of the year when we started studying it for a piece that we wrote.
2169.48s: But there's not all that much the US can do, short of a nuclear war. And I don't think anybody
2175.56s: wants a nuclear war. So I think Putin views time as being on his side. He's fighting a war of
2183.72s: attrition. Russia is bigger or populist. Has a much more pronounced military industrial complex
2194.68s: right next door to the line of contact. As is convoluted and tied to China and thousands of miles away.
2202.04s: It's just not a war that we could have ever won. We had to win earlier where we were going to lose
2205.64s: a grinding war. And the Russians, if anything, know how to march from east to west,
2210.92s: you know, leveling towns along the way. I do think we're going to see a pressing crisis that might
2217.56s: bring Trump in the west closer to Putin's demands. By the way, his demands are the four regions and
2227.88s: a comprehensive settlement to the entire security situation in Europe, IE, no missiles in Germany,
2233.08s: and never allowing Ukraine to join NATO and all of these, what the West would call extremist
2239.08s: demands. Well, might is right. And if he imposes those conditions upon Ukraine, and we can't do
2244.44s: anything about it, then we'll get there eventually. But one issue that I think might accelerate
2249.24s: an end to the war on terms closer to Russia's is the upcoming winter and the fact that the Russians
2254.44s: have been, I believe, illegally targeting Ukraine electricity grid for destruction. And it's
2260.52s: going to be a country that really just can't be lived in pretty soon if we have a cold winter.
2265.00s: I see. Pivoting a little bit now, I want to talk a little bit more about the just energy sector
2276.68s: reaction to things. And we've seen a bit of a mixed bag. What are your thoughts on nuclear power
2285.40s: in the future for that? Bullish nuclear. Trump is very bullish nuclear. And the collapse of the
2293.72s: environmental left will finally, you know, slay the last of the malfeudions, where opposed the
2300.12s: nuclear power for silly reasons. So nuclear, totally bullish. Oil is a mixed bag. I think the
2309.00s: initial response to his election was bearish, which is correct. And then we've seen a bit of a
2313.80s: bounce back as the market digests the geopolitical uncertainties of Trump's views on Iran and
2320.28s: Israel. He is a unknown or a chaotic actor in that regard. And so if he resolves the Middle
2329.80s: East and we could get some form of peace in Ukraine, Joe Babydrell is just unabashedly bearish for
2337.08s: oil prices, bearish for oil producers and bullish for oil service providers because there's
2343.24s: going to be more volume pumped. That's sort of the superficial 20,000 but view of it all. A lot of
2350.84s: ifs in there. But the all things being equal in no World War III, the direction of oil is down.
2360.04s: OPEC is in big trouble. Trump is going to unleash the American oil and gas producers. They have
2367.80s: very little track record of being disciplined in this regard. If they can drill, they will drill.
2374.12s: And the model otherwise, I think, is silly. And Trump wants them to drill. He wants cheap hydrocarbons
2379.80s: to feed the industrial revolution that he sees in the in the ensuring of the military industrial
2384.28s: complex supply chains. What do you make of the there's like the I forgot the thing that he
2394.20s: decided to call it, but he it's one of the things that he's looking to use Elon Musk for.
2398.20s: It's like the government efficiency. The Dodge. Yeah. Yeah. Is Elon calls it, but whatever it'll
2405.48s: end up being. What do you think about that? I think that's going to be way harder than Elon thinks.
2410.20s: Elon's used to walking in with a sink to Twitter and being a dictator. First of all, if it's a
2417.48s: cabinet level position, he'd have to be approved by the Senate. That won't be a short putt given
2424.12s: his rather colorful past. But beyond that, the hardest thing to do in Washington is to fire a
2430.44s: government employee. And the unions have power. They have laws behind them. That one is going to be
2438.20s: more challenging. I think removing rules and regulations through the stroke of a pan is far easier.
2445.56s: Cutting out $2 trillion of federal expenditures is a whole different animal altogether. And frankly,
2451.40s: many on the Republican side don't want that to happen either because it's a unit party of pork
2456.20s: being distributed. And so all one giant grift. There's not like there's an army of physical
2462.68s: disciplinarians on the Republican side that have been held back by the left. There's a very small
2467.48s: number of honorable physical disciplinarians on the on the Republican side and a few on the left.
2474.84s: But nowhere near a plurality or let alone a majority. And so I think it's easy to say I will cut
2481.48s: $2 trillion for the budget. Let's see if you can do it. And another reason why I don't think
2486.28s: it's going to happen is because that wouldn't be catastrophic for GDP. It would tip the country
2490.20s: into recession. And Trump likes his numbers to go up.
2495.08s: So then how do those reconcile? I don't think they do. I think we just stay on this fiscal
2499.32s: dominance path. And Trump makes the numbers go up, including the debt, including the deficit, GDP,
2507.72s: be it nominal or not, oil production. Again, the only number of the board he wants to see go down
2512.52s: is gasoline prices. What do you think about the tax incentive he's looking at rolling out,
2520.04s: where would reduce corporate taxes to I think 15%. Yeah, look, he wants to extend his tax cuts,
2526.68s: you know, but they accept the expire in 2025. And that's why the outcome of the House races
2531.16s: is so critical. That's another example. You can't cut taxes and be unable to cut spending and
2540.04s: then expect that like the deficit's going to go down. I think, look, Trump is inflationary.
2544.76s: Let's be very clear. You need to pivot. The current US president is an inflationary force.
2551.48s: Re-shoring is inflationary. The only deflationary impact is the bottom of the energy.
2557.88s: And that's the significant one. But on balance, Trump is inflationary and should be modeled as such.
2566.20s: So then I guess to zoom in on that though, do you think that companies are likely to respond to
2572.04s: that? Do you think that companies are happier just taking the 5% hit on production and continuing to
2580.04s: try externally? Do you think that there's a potential for this, actually, meaningfully move production
2584.68s: of various things to within US borders? Oh, it's going to move the deal. Yeah. And they now have
2592.36s: four years of regulatory certainty, which is like forever in politics, right? And so yeah,
2600.12s: I, and by the way, like 95% of them voted for Trump. So like this is, they have all the cards now.
2608.76s: This is the point of our next piece. Like this is a profound earth shattering,
2614.52s: meaningful historic event that happened earlier this week. The game has changed. And the extent to
2622.60s: which the game has changed and the amount of sort of changing that happens over the next four years
2628.44s: is going to be well beyond what I think even the most aggressive people are modeling today, for sure.
2634.84s: What do you think about immigration? I think he's going to do everything he said he's going to do.
2645.08s: Look, it's, it's, look, as an immigrant to the US who followed the rules and took many,
2653.24s: many years to eventually become a citizen, you know, and when I was immigrating, I never forgot
2658.04s: that I was a privileged guest of the US government. I'm torn on the subject. The US needs
2664.52s: legal immigration. It needs the number and training and backgrounds of the people that it should
2671.96s: want to select into the country. I think who becomes a US citizen is, is well within the,
2677.64s: the sovereign domain of the US government and look at countries like Australia, they do it,
2682.92s: or even Canada, they do it on a merit-based system, a point system.
2687.32s: The, the issue, which I think drove a lot of people to the, to the tolls is the quote-unquote
2693.16s: legal immigration. I have deep sympathy for people who want to come to the US and to make a
2698.84s: better life for themselves because I was once one of those people and I have made a better life
2703.80s: for myself in this amazing, wonderful country. But at the same time, you have to follow the rules,
2710.60s: but then the counter to that is sometimes it's very difficult to know what the rules are.
2714.28s: Like the rules of your current situation when you're coming over the border might make that decision
2719.64s: a no-brainer from a game-through perspective get there and try to stay as opposed to
2723.96s: trying to find a legal way to get there in the first place. And so I, I very mixed emotions on it,
2729.64s: but objectively as an analyst, he is going to deport a lot of illegal immigrants.
2735.32s: It's going to be very destructive for people who came here believing there were a different set of rules.
2741.00s: It's going to be deeply polarizing and I believe I believe you should take him at his word is what
2750.68s: he's going to do. What do you think the impact is there to industry? I think it's another inflationary
2756.68s: force. Look, one of the dirty secrets is a lot of big companies like illegal immigration because
2762.68s: it gives them access to cheap labor, especially in the agricultural sector. And you know,
2770.36s: there's a lot of jobs that quote unquote the current youth of America don't necessarily want to do
2775.88s: or have been taught that they shouldn't do that they should go to college and such work has been
2779.08s: eaten right. I don't subscribe to such things, but that's just the reality of the situation we have.
2785.00s: And so it is inflationary, sorry inflationary, and it is going to provoke violence I think.
2793.08s: It's going to add fuel to societal upheaval, but I think we should take him at his word
2801.48s: that this is what he's going to do. What do you think about the US
2807.48s: Mexico-Canada agreement agreement and the renegotiation he talked about there? I think if the
2813.88s: flow over the Mexican border doesn't stop he'll tear it up because he needs he's threatening to raise
2818.76s: tariffs on Mexico if they don't play ball on immigration. I suspect they will by the way I think.
2824.92s: And by the way that the message will go out that this is no longer in your best interest from a game
2829.16s: through your perspective to take that risk. I think he's going to cut off any benefits that he can
2834.60s: to those that are here as a way to sort of drive them out. It's a catastrophe, a humane
2843.32s: and inhumane situation that both sides bear significant responsibility for allowing to have gotten
2848.92s: to this point and for the ugliness that I fear will soon follow. But again our objective as
2858.92s: analysts is to observe the pieces on the board and predict the movements not necessarily to wish
2865.40s: for one outcome or to advocate for an outcome. And speaking of predicting movements as you look
2874.04s: across just the way things are going now and to summarize at a high level what are the top three to
2882.20s: five pieces that you see moving in their impacts. Obviously we already talked about a couple of them
2888.36s: things like oil, glass, oil and gas, climate change. What other things come to mind though?
2893.80s: Massive deregulation, substantial investment, inflationary forces, cheap energy, abundant energy,
2902.36s: political polarization. And I think Trump is the beginning of a worldwide movement. I think the
2912.28s: impact of Trump in this last election. We already saw it look the government in Germany collapsed
2918.04s: within 24 hours of Trump winning. I think the UK is going down to go a significant reconsideration
2924.12s: of its politics. The European Union might not survive it. The Middle East is going to be totally
2930.36s: reshaped. He is a historically consequential figure. There has never been another. Probably won't
2939.56s: ever be another. And the next four years are going to be a hell of a ride.
2943.32s: What do you think about the reshaping of the Middle East?
2950.36s: Yeah, much depends on how Iran is real shakes out. And I just don't know. I don't have an edge. I don't
2955.00s: have sources. I don't can't say that I can predict that I know what his objectives are, whether
2960.44s: that can happen over there remains to be seen. Israel is in a very precarious position, by the way.
2965.88s: I mean, if you cut through the propaganda and you actually go in and take a look at what actually
2970.36s: is going on, it is a very foreign society. They had their democracy. They're, you know,
2977.88s: Netanyahu is not a dictator. There's very strong arguments going on inside of Israel as to the
2985.16s: wisdom of the current response to the October 7th attacks. This is the faint ability of this response.
2992.44s: How the IDF is doing in Lebanon is a very interesting thing to ask and to ponder.
2997.24s: And we've written about some of the vulnerabilities of Israel and how Iran's attack on a
3004.76s: October 1st may have exposed them. So count us in a camp that hopes that Trump can lead to a lasting
3012.20s: peace or at least a day-taunt in the region because war is always the abject failure of diplomacy.
3020.44s: Look, if you can bring both wars to an end, I think you should get a Nobel priest,
3024.28s: I mean, not that he will, but I'm all enough to remember when seeking peace was a liberal
3029.72s: attribute and one that was rewarded. So we shall see. It's going to be a fascinating 90 days,
3036.44s: for sure. I think Q1 2025 is going to be historic.
3045.88s: One more question not related to the presidency, but just in general. We're obviously going through
3051.64s: an earning cycle now. What do you make of that? I think the economy is doing mostly fine.
3058.92s: Again, when you have fiscal stimulus, the likes of which we're seeing and dirt cheap
3063.48s: abundant hydrocarbons, American companies are going to do fine. I think the economy is running
3070.76s: roughly along the GDP numbers, the government prints. I look here, natural gas, $2.50 million
3079.08s: BTO right now. That's dirt cheap. That's a very valuable hydrocarbon that does an enormous amount
3084.68s: of work that feeds hundreds of cogeneration facilities within the browns field sites of
3090.04s: heavy industry where they take that natural gas and they make both industrial grade steam and
3094.92s: electricity with very high efficiencies. The fact that our industry supply chains can do it at
3100.60s: a fraction of the globes is a huge advantage and explains why we didn't go into a recession
3106.84s: before the election. I think earning a couple of big companies set the tone for everything and we'll
3113.64s: have to see how they all end up reporting. But by and large, I think the economy is fine
3121.16s: and we'll see what the Trump effect will be.
3126.52s: Eager. That's just what comes to mind. I'm very, very curious what this whole thing
3131.64s: ends playing out as. But I always really appreciate the nuance of your perspectives and taking the
3138.76s: time to get into some of those details there. The last thing I want to ask you before we wrap up.
3145.88s: Right now we're going through it looks like financial sector flying obviously starting to
3152.68s: price in the expectation of deregulation and whatnot. Looking out before JP Morgan Goldman
3160.68s: Sacks, they were starting to forecast a higher probability not super high but a higher probability of
3166.52s: recession in 2025. One of the prospects for a recession is it sits now in your eyes.
3171.32s: I mean, you eventually have to have one. It's been a while since we have. Look, I think the
3174.92s: banks are flying because of the prospect of enough coming in at MNABOOM. I think the FTC,
3181.80s: changing leadership at the FTC is one of the number one desires of Wall Street.
3187.72s: And so I think Matt Stoller was just out with a great piece on Substack making this point earlier.
3195.16s: But as far as recession in 2025 goes, it's hard to see. It's going to be a boom. People can
3205.00s: flake fiscal spending and deficits and ever increasing debt and money printing as being bad. And they are,
3217.16s: I suppose, in context, but not in a short term. There's a reason why it's called a sugar high.
3225.88s: Now the crash will eventually come. Do I think the crash comes in 2025? I don't know.
3231.00s: The US is still the global reserve currency and has a lot of runway in this regard.
3240.92s: And seems intent on keeping the party going. So it'll look in less until you see a long bond blown
3247.64s: out to six or seven or eight percent. Then we have a different discussion, I suppose.
3254.60s: So big old TBD. We'll see how the bonds do.
3257.80s: Money printer go per. Yeah. I tell you what, that thing can work in overtime.
3264.28s: Well, by the way, let's one last point that I think runs counter to the sort of recession narrative.
3270.76s: As China's not just going to sit there and Xi might be provoked into firing the big bazooka
3277.08s: in response to Trump's tariffs and his protectionist isolationist ambitions. And if you have a
3284.76s: giant bazooka coming out of China, that black debt liquidity is going to slosh around the world
3288.60s: and find its way to our markets too. So in a race to the top, there are too many boats sunk to the
3295.56s: bottom. So if you pushed me, I would fade a recession in 2025. You heard it here first.
3304.04s: Just don't remind me if I'm wrong, right, brother?
3305.96s: Well, obviously, we just focus on the time time. Those are the important ones.
3311.24s: Doomberg and team, I always say in team because I know that there's other people that make the whole
3316.76s: thing happen over there. So I'm as always super thankful to catch up, always enjoy discussing.
3322.12s: Obviously, people can find you on your website, which I will throw to in the video description below,
3326.84s: but anything else you want to leave people with?
3329.16s: No, doberg.com. Find everything there. Our pieces, our protier, our podcast appearances.
3333.88s: We were also very active on Substack Notes, which is their version of Twitter, which is becoming
3338.52s: actually quite active. And so we're trying our best to be like we once were on Twitter while we
3344.36s: were still active on that platform. Eric, always a great pleasure to talk to you. Looking forward to
3348.36s: the next time. Absolutely awesome. We'll see you guys later.
