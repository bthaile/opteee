0.00s:  What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my favorite green caricature
6.76s:  hanging out, Duneberg. Great to see you. Eric, great to be back. And I'm looking forward
11.04s:  to another robust discussion. And if our preamble before you hit record is end indication,
15.00s:  this is going to be a good one. Yeah, which fun fact for everybody. We were talking a
18.36s:  little bit about creative process and Duneberg has a very cool creative process, kind of
24.20s:  like what I've heard from different kinds of authors and stuff. And we were just talking
28.48s:  a little bit about the way that people build that together. Because you have an interesting
32.36s:  production schedule. Have you talked about that before with people or no? I think I may
35.52s:  have on a short, too, but I'm happy to repeat it. Yeah, we're on a four day treadmill.
39.44s:  I think I was telling you and we have to research right at it, publish, promote and defend
45.16s:  a piece roughly every four days. We do about eight a month, depending on the month. Our
50.20s:  target is six to eight, but we're since we left Twitter, we have a lot more time in our
54.00s:  hands since how we've been reaching the upper bound of that objective. And for me personally,
59.72s:  I've always been a very systematic sleeper. The difference between sort of naps and
64.48s:  full sleep cycles and those kinds of things. And I paid close attention to it. And I found
68.84s:  that my body and my brain coalesced best overnight. And so I'll typically do most of the writing
76.12s:  for Duneberg between two and five a.m. depending on when I go to bed and what else I have going
82.04s:  on. And that's worked very well for me personally. It doesn't work for everybody, but the brain
87.32s:  is clear. The house is quiet. The phone is dead. Everyone else is asleep. And you kind
93.12s:  of also feel like you're getting one up on everybody, you know, like a little bit of a productivity
96.52s:  hack. So for me, I'll typically sleep two cycles, get up, work, two or three hours, bang
102.64s:  out a piece, and then go back to bed for another cycle or a few naps. A nap is about 20 minutes
108.24s:  for me. And a full sleep cycle is about an hour and 42 minutes. And they're very different
114.60s:  experiences. But the body, you know, derives value from both. And being systematic about
120.04s:  when you sleep and when you work is one of the significant benefits of writing your own
125.56s:  business and being able to set your own schedule. And we're very disciplined about not
129.04s:  taking meetings and putting aside time to be creative. It's what we're paid to do. So
134.36s:  it's nice that when your bank account is aligned with what's best for your body and your
139.16s:  brain.
140.16s:  Yeah, that's huge. And I think one of the coolest things about that that you highlight
144.04s:  is just the process of like finding what works for you because as we were kind of discussing
149.36s:  and just for a few moments, I find it really interesting when I read about different authors
154.96s:  and, you know, people who write and all the different kinds of things that they do to
159.04s:  get into their groove. It's always interesting to me how that goes.
162.40s:  Yeah, I'm a big believer in optimizing your micro environment as well because you spend
169.02s:  almost all of your time in your micro environment. And look, you can't really do this if you're
173.24s:  in a job or if your schedule is beholden to somebody else's needs. We're very, very
180.92s:  disciplined about what meetings we take, which is basically nonexept podcasts and putting
186.12s:  aside time for creativity. And we did this before Doomer became successful, but now that
191.28s:  it has become successful, there's just nothing that could convince us to change the way
196.76s:  we go about things. And, you know, we're at 330 articles into this journey. And we've
203.40s:  got the steps down to pretty much a science at this point. Again, for those who have created
209.84s:  for a living, that treadmill is real. And it could either tire you out and cause you
216.84s:  to burn out or you can embrace and rearrange the rest of your life to embrace the challenge
222.72s:  of it. And for me, it's just, I couldn't imagine doing anything else now after having done
226.96s:  this for three and a half years.
228.48s:  Yeah, yeah, I totally get that. And speaking of sleep schedules and whatnot, what did you
235.20s:  think of the election? Were you up all night for that or how'd that go?
240.00s:  Well, the decisive moments happened to go inside with when I would typically be up. And so
245.12s:  yeah, I was.
246.12s:  Perfect.
247.12s:  Online when the races were called, at least by Fox and by decision desk HQ and sort of less
253.76s:  partisan news outlets. I think the outcome was both profound and predictable. I think
262.24s:  the Democrats did themselves in when Joe Biden, who you may remember when he was elected
268.28s:  in 2020, basically ran as not Trump caretaker won't run again. That's kind of a forgotten
275.16s:  detail of how 2020 came to be. And the moment Biden decided to run again, whichever of the
281.00s:  Biden's decided it. And went back on that promise, it robbed the Democrats of a true open
289.00s:  primary to have the voters select the best candidate. It was very clear to me and to anybody
294.80s:  who was objective that Biden was beginning to suffer serious cognitive decline even back
298.84s:  in 2020. There's no way he could have continued to run in 2024. That was very clear. And
305.24s:  in fact, when I saw that the first debate was scheduled so early, I had a hunch that maybe
309.96s:  those in the DNC who knew for a fact what was going on maybe wanted to create that moment
316.60s:  where they could interview any convincing belief. But by the time they did, it was too late
321.84s:  to have anybody but Harris as their nominee. And I think winning the primary is essential
330.44s:  practice and essential an essential exercise in winning the general. Trump for all his baggage
339.28s:  is now a three time winner of the Republican primary and a two time winner of the general
345.48s:  election. He would probably argue that he's a three time winner. But Harris received no votes
352.12s:  and was anointed. And I think that really mattered. And look, when you have a razor thin electric,
357.08s:  like we do, you know, the difference between Trump winning versus Biden winning or in this
364.04s:  case, Harris winning versus Trump winning is a few percentage points. And the way the DNC went
371.24s:  about initially selecting and then coordinating its ultimate nominee had to be worth two to three
377.32s:  points to the negative. And that's a decisive swing in our politics. Look, for all the talk of
384.28s:  landslide, red wave and mandates. I mean, it's still plus or minus four or five points, either way,
392.36s:  the vast majority of people voted the same. A few people changed their votes or showed up or
397.80s:  didn't show up. And now we have a completely different world. And I think as the next piece we
403.00s:  publish will outline Trump's victory and mandate and popular vote victory in particular,
409.72s:  combined with the fact that he is a far more effective president now than he would have been if
414.76s:  he had won in 2020, having had four years to ponder what went wrong and what he would do differently,
419.80s:  for example. And the fact that he's unencumbered by the need to occasionally soften his views out
427.24s:  of political expediency because he's not writing again. This is one and done for him. He is going to be a
433.00s:  decisive and transformative president, especially in the first two years with Republican
437.72s:  control of the Senate and likely control of the House. And there's going to be deeply meaningful
442.60s:  things. Look, one of the things we've warned our friends on the progressive left about for years,
446.52s:  as you should not concentrate too much power or affect change amongst the agenda and as you
451.48s:  care about through executive action, because it's not going to be forever that you control the
455.48s:  presidency. And now there were nightmare, the impotentment of all the things that they proclaim
462.84s:  to oppose, not only has a mandate to power the pen, but a decisive ambition that he is going
472.36s:  to execute with vigor. And it's going to be a shocking couple of years for those on the left in
478.52s:  our view. What did you make of the the actual announcement and outcome of the election? One of the
486.20s:  things that I was a little surprised by, not even so looking back, is I genuinely thought that the
493.56s:  race was going to be a lot closer than it was just based on what I've heard. I always know that when
500.20s:  you hear different media sources talking about it, obviously they're going to have their bias and
504.04s:  their slants. The market seemed to have Trump pretty much pinned. You can look at equities, bonds,
509.96s:  leading into the election, prediction markets, all had him. So that seemed to be a generally expected
517.16s:  outcome just from a financial markets perspective, but still the talking points where this was going to
521.96s:  be very close. And it wasn't did that. Yeah. So I'll tell you an interesting anecdote for me. So I live
528.60s:  in a swing state. And prior to the election, I was getting 30 to 40 texts a day, super annoying, right?
534.92s:  And even though I like those random numbers and stuff. Oh, yeah, Kamala Harris says ABC, you know,
540.60s:  so I, I, I, I religiously blocked them or for all of them, but didn't see the slow things down.
546.92s:  And then about a week before the election, I managed to vote early. And within hours of voting,
554.44s:  the text stopped. Like almost none. There was a few local texts, but no presidential texts,
562.68s:  maybe one or two over a period of days where I was getting dozens every day. And that was very
568.20s:  a hot moment for me. The campaigns knew it's exactly how they were doing, moment by moment. They
575.00s:  could see early voting. Now they don't know who I voted for, but they know what party I'm registered
580.52s:  to vote with in the primaries. And I know the other aspects of my demographic background to the
584.92s:  point where they can model with, you know, 90 plus percent certainty, who I probably voted for.
591.40s:  And knowing that the campaigns were in possession of an extraordinarily granular amount of data
600.36s:  about how things were going, I then watched the body language of the two candidates in the final
605.56s:  four or five days. And it was very clear to me that Harris was despondent, the Langry,
616.20s:  whereas Trump was who was always somewhat optimistic, was very optimistic as body language.
622.20s:  If you just watched the two candidates with a sound off, you could see the body language between
627.64s:  the two was stark. The difference between them was stark. And I noted with interest that Harris
633.48s:  really only visited Pennsylvania on the last day, whereas Trump did his typical, you know,
638.12s:  four rallies, 18 hours flying all over the country, finished in Grand Rapids, Michigan at 2am,
642.92s:  I believe. This was a guy running through the tape. And Harris struck me as somebody
652.92s:  hoping for it to end. And so that, and again, people will say that I'm just being biased,
659.32s:  but I think if a neutral observer would say that there was a pronounced fall off in Harris'
664.12s:  body language in the last week as the early return data was coming in. And this was my, my
669.48s:  hunch was buttressed by the actual early returns as they came in and were reported during the day on
675.00s:  the fifth. So, and even, even with all of that, it still was very close, like, you know, Pennsylvania
680.28s:  difference, 2%, Michigan difference, I think it's a point and a half. Arizona looks like it's going to
685.80s:  be somewhere less than that. So we're not talking about a huge amount, but back to my earlier
690.12s:  point, like the way in which the DNC selected and then reselected its candidate probably hurt
696.20s:  them enough to be decisive. Yeah. I think specifically the point on the lead in is pretty pertinent.
707.16s:  I also thought it was interesting. I don't know how impactful, just from a personal curiosity
713.00s:  standpoint, I'm curious your thought on Harris not doing the Joe Rogan podcast when they try to
721.88s:  line that up. Do you, what do you think about that? Yeah, I think, you know, Taylor Lorenz was out
727.24s:  with an interesting piece this morning. She's a former reporter at the Washington Post and now
731.64s:  full-time sub-stacker, I think. There is an entire alternative media ecosystem on the right
738.36s:  that the left just doesn't have. And so it isn't really that she didn't go on Joe Rogan. It's
743.32s:  that the left doesn't have a Joe Rogan. Now, I think Lorenz's piece totally mischaracterizes the
748.60s:  real issue. The real issue is the right has created this alternative media ecosystem in reaction to
754.04s:  the fact that the vast majority of the traditional media system is dominated by the left with the
758.52s:  possible exception of Fox. But like CNN, MSNBC, ABCCBS, NBC, Washington Post, LA Times, New York
768.28s:  Times, like these are all decidedly liberal news outlets. And so the sort of echoes of Rush Limbaugh
774.28s:  that we now see with the Benny Johnson's of the world. And now the Joe Rogan's of the world
780.20s:  were created out of necessity. And this entire ecosystem, which I think Trump used masterfully
786.92s:  during the campaign, he went on basically every podcast that would have him. And this was underrated.
792.84s:  Harris was doing the traditional Facebook, Google ads, Blitz spending hundreds of millions of
798.20s:  dollars. Whereas Trump was just gathering up engagements after engagements and listening to
804.60s:  somebody in a podcast is a great engagement. And he went on all the big shows. And she didn't have
811.24s:  a Joe Rogan to go on. She was invited on to Joe Rogan now. That's not a format that placed
818.36s:  on her strength if we're being totally honest. But by the way, that's the type of thing you could
824.60s:  have sniffed out in an open primary, which they did the last time around when she didn't even make
828.76s:  it to Iowa. And so back to my earlier point, I mean, I think it was fatal that the DNC just
835.80s:  decided that Biden could run again without a primary. And then by the way, they actively oppose
841.32s:  you know, our FK juniors run, which he has, I think, accurately documented for all to see.
846.52s:  His swinging over to Trump was worth a few points too. Let's be honest. And again, in a
851.56s:  six point swing, two points is 33% of the variance. Right? I mean, it doesn't take too many
856.92s:  blow changes for the outcome to be as decisive as what we saw on Tuesday. One of the things that
863.56s:  makes the US presidential election so emotional is that it truly is a deeply polarized country.
875.00s:  The outcome is winner takes all regardless of the size of the vote differential. And
882.12s:  the position has been the recipient of ever growing delegations of authority far outside what
888.84s:  the constitutional framers envisioned. So the point where who occupies the president is a
893.72s:  decisively powerful thing. And so when a couple thousand votes in a county that few have ever
899.88s:  heard of makes all the difference because of the chaotic nature of the election systems in
906.52s:  the various states. It becomes a very violent tug of war. And we see this played out. We're
915.00s:  personally just very glad that a decisive outcome was reached. I mean, I think a contested election
920.52s:  would have been a catastrophe to those in the left. A Trump victory is a catastrophe and
925.72s:  vice versa on the right. But in our view, the only real catastrophe on the board was a contested
930.60s:  and protracted legal case around who won the election. I'm completely agree. Now thinking a little
938.84s:  bit more about the election, when you look at some of the different implications of policy,
946.60s:  if you were to segment it into kind of like a near term impact, longer term impact, near term
953.88s:  being maybe six months in within just to define it. And then long term greater than six months
958.92s:  out to five year plus. What are some of the primary themes that you're looking at under the new
966.04s:  context, understanding that House and Senate still TBD and will impact stuff to a degree for
971.72s:  everybody wondering today's the seventh. Yeah, I think the Senate is not TBD, but the House is
978.36s:  still mildly so although the prediction markets still have the Republicans at 85% chance of
983.72s:  getting over the line. And if they do get over the line and be by a raise within margin and so
987.64s:  basically replay of what we just had. I don't really view it as short and long term because what
993.24s:  we're seeing in the short term is the repricing of the long term effects of what's about to transpire.
997.00s:  So I'd rather just talk about the major themes that we see. And the one we're running about next
1003.32s:  is that this is the end of climate change as a defining narrative in our political discourse.
1009.56s:  Trump is going to kneecap the carbon agenda. He thinks it's a scam and a hoax. And by the way,
1018.52s:  what he thinks is way more important than what me or you are anybody listening thinks. And so
1024.12s:  we're just trying to appraise what he thinks, not necessarily judge it. I think you just need to
1029.40s:  understand where the man's head is if you're going to model and invest and reposition yourself to
1035.24s:  the facts as they are on the board, not as how you wish them to be. So I with that disclaimer,
1041.08s:  Trump in 2012 tweeted that he thought that climate change was a hoax manifested by in for China
1047.40s:  to weaken and make the U.S. manufacturing sector non-competitive. That is his view. He views the world
1054.52s:  as a great struggle economically between the U.S. and China. He wants to make things big,
1058.52s:  beautiful things in the U.S. And China has tricked the naive former leaders of the country
1065.08s:  into thinking climate change is a real thing. He doesn't care about climate change. And he is going to
1073.24s:  lead accordingly. And so what does that mean in all practicality? It means
1080.52s:  all the EPA regulations against power plants coming off the board. It means
1085.32s:  drill baby drill. It's back in style. It means higher oil and gas production. All things being
1092.12s:  equal much lower oil and gas prices. Bad for oil and gas equities. Good for oil and gas service
1098.76s:  providers. He wants to make things in America again. There's going to be a huge investment boom
1106.36s:  in the U.S. But most importantly, if you press them based on my own experience, the vast majority
1112.20s:  of C-suite executives at major companies in the U.S. don't actually think climate change is a big deal.
1117.08s:  And certainly don't think they should reorient their entire strategies around it and have been
1120.92s:  kind of just playing along to get along. On the subject and Trump, I believe, is going to give them
1127.56s:  all of the protection they need to express their true views on the topic. And I think
1134.92s:  key milestones for us will give you something to look at on the board next week. COP29 in Niger
1140.20s:  by Sean is next week. We marked COP28 last year in the United Arab Emirates as PKSG. You're going to
1148.52s:  see less than a third of the number of people attending this meeting that we saw at the same event
1154.12s:  last year. I think the air is coming out of the climate balloon. As we say in this piece,
1161.96s:  Trump likes his numbers to go up. And if carbon emissions are among them, so be it. That's what he's
1168.04s:  going to do. We're going to roll the dice on climate. China has never really cared about climate
1172.28s:  change. It has laughed the U.S. in carbon emissions. I think it's the most important chart on the board.
1179.16s:  We published it on notes this morning, which is the annual carbon emissions from China and the U.S.
1185.32s:  on the same plot. You could see that the U.S. has been laughed to declining since 2000. And China
1190.76s:  has been up and to the right. And to the extent that CO2 emissions are a proxy for manufacturing
1196.20s:  intensity. And the lack of increasing emissions in the U.S. is a proxy for the rusting out of the
1202.04s:  Midwest. Trump's going to change that. And so there's going to be a lot of howling on the left.
1209.00s:  But because the left mainly has over the years worked to make the power of the presidential pen
1217.80s:  and the weight of executive orders so so meaningful. They have now found themselves in a worst-case
1224.20s:  scenario where a man that they despise who was removed from office in a contest of election in 2020
1233.80s:  has had four years to ponder what he did wrong and how to do better. And all the mistakes that he made
1239.56s:  both in the last term of his, you know, the first term as president in the last election. He is
1246.60s:  is a way more effective president now than he would have been if he had won in 2020. And that's
1253.00s:  what's about to transpire in our view in the next year. That's the biggest one on the board.
1256.92s:  There's all other policy things we talk about too. But, you know, carbon and energy are really,
1261.96s:  really essential to the economy. And Trump has been very clear on what he intends to do. And I think
1269.32s:  people in the left are going to be shocked by what transpires in the next six months.
1274.68s:  What are your thoughts on the 60% era of Chinese imports?
1281.08s:  Yeah, he's going to do all those things. All of this will catalyze an investment boom in the U.S.
1287.56s:  But look, let's be very clear. Like it's not all like great. Trump likes the numbers to go up.
1293.00s:  That means Trump is an inflationary force. And the long bond is telling you that. And I think
1300.52s:  the U.S. is still in a very visibly dangerous place with interest payments,
1309.32s:  passing a trillion dollars a year and a trillion dollars in debt going on the books every quarter.
1315.72s:  The rules of the game have changed, but Trump's views on how the game should be played have not.
1320.92s:  And so he's going to print. He's going to try to grow. He's going to build big, beautiful things.
1329.72s:  He's going to push Powell to lower interest rates. He wants the stock market to go up. He wants GDP to go
1335.96s:  up. He wants nominal paychecks to go up. And he wants gas prices to go down.
1341.24s:  Right? I mean, these are very simplistic anchors of his worldview, but they should not be
1347.32s:  ignored. It's what he's going to do. And so in our view, inflationary hedges are going to be in
1354.12s:  high demand. In the long term, that means things like gold should do well. But there's going to be a
1360.92s:  boom in the U.S. There's just no question about it. He will
1365.96s:  through just the pen, let alone if the House comes on board. Look, if he has the House to
1369.40s:  Senate, the pen and the Supreme Court, I mean, the next two years are going to be a blitz of
1377.08s:  right wing wish list items, one after the other being knocked out. And it's going to be a
1384.84s:  shocking realization to the left as to what the power of a president who has been
1390.84s:  both, you know, distilled in the cauldron of political upheaval and skilled in the art of
1399.80s:  having learned from his prior experiences, it's going to be far more profound than even what
1403.80s:  the market is predicting. And that's why I think, for example, the solar ETF, I think it's 10,
1408.92s:  was down to something like 15% in the morning of the election. These are big four or five sigma
1414.68s:  moves on the board that we're seeing a total realignment given the nature of the Republican
1420.36s:  Trump in this cycle. Specifically for the tariffs, the path of that is really of interest to me,
1429.24s:  and when I say path, just the protocol that it's implemented with, because that kind of thing,
1434.52s:  obviously, essentially, basic, I can know, well, you know this, but it's basically just going to
1440.92s:  be passed on to the consumer. And I'm wondering if you have a perspective on the way that something like
1448.36s:  a 60% tariff on Chinese goods could look in terms of implementation and then therefore impact.
1454.84s:  It's a blunt instrument to be sure. And passed on to the consumer is a temporary thing until
1461.00s:  domestic supply comes online. The thing that I can't quite square is how this all works with a
1467.00s:  stronger dollar, which was the initial market reaction, you know, to his, to his victory. So I
1474.12s:  think the US dollar has to get much weaker over time if Trump is going to get his way. Like when you
1478.60s:  think about the things that foster and protect a domestic manufacturing supply chain, it's a
1486.12s:  weak currency and protection of tariffs. And those are the things that need to happen. And in particular,
1492.20s:  US dollar needs to get substantially weaker against China's currency in order for the playing field
1496.84s:  to become substantially equalized. But Trump is also a strong US dollar type guy as well. So there
1503.64s:  are some inconsistencies that look Trump is in the name of right. I mean, let's just let's be
1507.48s:  clear. Like the man is a force of nature. I think his stamina, persistence and ability to shake off
1515.72s:  extreme criticism are pretty unique in the history of our politics. Whatever you think of the man,
1522.92s:  he is the Energizer Bunny of American politics and totally agnostic to the most dastardly accusations
1530.60s:  and slanders of his character, right? I mean, how many times do we have to call somebody Hitler
1535.72s:  in our politics? Like, can we be done with that already? But nonetheless, he just seems totally
1543.16s:  oblivious to it all. And I think that's part of what makes him so attractive to everyday Americans.
1550.36s:  So he is a highly underrated, very talented retail politician. He connects with average voters in a
1559.40s:  way that those among the more elite in the country failed to comprehend because he is so
1567.88s:  orthogonal to the behavior patterns, acceptable behavior patterns and their social circles that
1572.52s:  they think it must be that everyone else would reject him too, but it just simply isn't true.
1578.04s:  And I can't say that I fully understand it, but I could tell you I once was in the vicinity of
1582.60s:  once of his rallies, of one of his rallies. And I was totally shocked by what I saw. Like,
1588.12s:  what did you see? I saw waves of red and flags and everyday normal Americans
1597.32s:  coming out for a politician with enthusiasm and affection that has been unprecedented,
1604.92s:  like not even Reagan, of this is such a response from from everyday Americans. And you see it like
1612.36s:  the unions coming out and voting for him in droves, even though their leadership didn't want to
1616.12s:  endorse them. Like that's sort of a classic example. But like Trump is a rich guy in a suit with a
1622.52s:  very long tie and plumbers and firefighters and police officers. They love them. He invokes
1634.44s:  a deeply visceral loyalty and enthusiasm that no other politician of our time
1640.84s:  comes close. I think Obama did, but not with a different demographic.
1648.76s:  I live in flyover country and I could just tell you that these people would walk over glass to
1653.16s:  vote for him. And they did. They turned out again. You have to tip his hat. I don't know
1660.28s:  quite what it is. Like he's just got like, look, whatever you think of the McDonald's and
1665.16s:  garbage trucks stunts. I mean, when I went to go out, there were people standing in line wearing
1672.28s:  colored vests. And when I drove by the voting station on my way into the office on election day,
1680.20s:  there was an enormous number of pickup trucks in the parking lot. He just connects in a way
1687.00s:  that Harris couldn't. And politics is about passion and momentum.
1695.72s:  Speaking of the momentum element of just his brand and his platform,
1702.20s:  what do you think the first 60 days of his presidency are going to be focused on specifically
1708.76s:  from an economic standpoint? It's going to be a blitz. It's going to be deregulation,
1714.92s:  especially in the energy sector. It's going to be tariffs and it's going to be, I think,
1721.00s:  RFK Jr. is going to get a free hand on the sort of health agenda. I noted with interest that
1727.80s:  in the euphoria of the 1500 point rally in the Dow day after election day, one company was
1735.00s:  ominous in its failure to participate. And that was Pfizer. Pfizer was down on the day or flat.
1740.44s:  Unch, as you might say, that was very curious to me. Solar being down 15%
1748.92s:  Pfizer unchanged and everything else to the moon. So it tells you the market believes that Trump
1754.52s:  is going to do what he says he's going to do. But they're hedging on the power of the pharmaceutical
1759.24s:  companies because they're just so omnipresent in all of the sort of political donation cycles
1765.00s:  and all of that other stuff. And in the media cycles as well. I do think that there is a significant
1770.68s:  risk that is being underappreciated, which is RFK Jr. is going to target pharmaceutical company
1777.00s:  advertising and getting it banned in the US, which would be a one two punch because it'll be a
1780.60s:  death blow to the quote unquote traditional media or mainstream media that Trump hates so much.
1785.16s:  You take away pharmaceutical advertising from ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN. These companies are going
1791.48s:  to be in the heart locker. And so we're seeing a lot of angst amongst our contacts in the pharmaceutical
1797.48s:  industry. The traditional media is still trying to figure out how this phenomenon could happen.
1804.28s:  They have no idea how out of touch they are with the exact same people I just described as
1808.60s:  willing to walk over glass to vote for Trump. It's gotten to the point now where if something is
1813.40s:  published in the traditional media, not only is it not believed by the people I just described,
1819.72s:  they immediately assume the opposite must be true. We've written a piece that we haven't published
1826.76s:  on Ivermectin, for example. The moment the press started making fun of those taking Ivermectin,
1832.04s:  everyone assumed it must be really effective against COVID. And there's just this
1837.16s:  this real knee jerk response to whatever it is that the man on CNN is telling me the exact opposite
1842.36s:  must be true. And that is a dangerous place for society, but it's where we are.
1849.88s:  Do you think that there's some sort of intervention or interaction with Ukraine is real
1855.88s:  those conflicts? Yeah, our initial response is this is a very bearish development for Ukraine.
1863.16s:  Let's not forget that they once impeached Trump on Ukraine. And it's not like he doesn't know what's
1868.84s:  actually going on over there. I think he is a person who has an affinity for and respect for
1874.92s:  strong men. And Putin certainly falls in that category as does GCPing, we should say.
1881.00s:  And he's really interested in fighting and winning an economic war with China.
1888.20s:  I think he would view the Ukraine Russia war as a distraction.
1893.72s:  The challenge that we see in the Ukraine situation is Trump is a little naive when it comes to his
1901.24s:  appraisal of the leverage the US currently has in that situation. And the type of deal that the
1906.28s:  Russians would be willing to accept after two and a half years of conflict with NATO.
1913.72s:  I don't really see where Trump to get a deal that he can sell as being an outproduct of his
1922.92s:  violent negotiation skills, at least his self-assumed negotiation skills. And I think the Russians
1928.12s:  are aware of who Trump is and have decided that they're not going to be fooled again,
1935.48s:  quote unquote, their view, not mine, on cutting another deal with the West, that the West ultimately
1943.80s:  re-niggs upon in the years ahead. So I don't think that Trump is going to be able to stop the war
1950.84s:  in Ukraine as easily as he thinks he can. But Ukraine is in a very precarious spot. And Trump's
1957.48s:  election could cause a morale crisis amongst the troops in Ukraine that could make all of it moot,
1962.52s:  because the Russians have been gaining sort of rather rapidly in the past few months. As
1967.56s:  it pertains to Israel and Iran, that's a harder one for us to model. He has a unique
1976.52s:  history with Iran, and a closeness with Netanyahu allegedly, although I thought when he left
1983.64s:  office in 2020 that he and Netanyahu were a bit on the outs, but they seem to be
1988.44s:  back in good graces with each other now. Netanyahu certainly seemed to welcome Trump's ascension,
1994.36s:  but we shall see. I think if you take the big picture, one of the things that Trump regularly
2000.36s:  bragged about on the campaign trail was he had no wars during his first term. Now, he inherited
2006.36s:  existing wars, Afghanistan in particular, but there were no new conflicts started while he was
2011.40s:  president. And I think he views himself as a champion of peace through strength, the classic sort of
2017.08s:  Reagan mold, whether he has enough strength to impose peace both in Ukraine and in the Middle
2023.40s:  East remains to be seen. Although I would note with some interest that we've seen a few reports
2028.60s:  like the Houthis unilaterally deciding to end their campaign in the Red Sea. I don't know if
2032.68s:  that's true. I saw it on Twitter and Hamas calling for a ceasefire now that Trump has won the election.
2039.00s:  But time will tell, I think I would not personally be surprised to see Trump and Putin meeting in
2044.92s:  person. Shortly after Trump takes office to try to iron out a grand bargain, that will of course
2053.56s:  horrify people in the collective West and the sort of the neo-continuing of the US political scene.
2060.76s:  Trump wants to bring these wars to an end. He wants to focus his efforts on an economic war with
2066.04s:  China. I don't think he wants a military conflict with China. By the way, he would like to
2070.92s:  be a peace candidate who brought economic prosperity back to the, you know, lunchpale joes of America.
2079.08s:  And escalating in either Ukraine or the Middle East doesn't serve that agenda.
2085.00s:  Now, when you look at the interaction though between Ukraine, Russia, how long the conflict has
2096.92s:  been going, have you modeled even a loose idea of what an agreement could likely look like?
2107.64s:  I think that the, so one of the things I tried myself on doing is reading the local propaganda
2113.16s:  of all the parties involved. Because you have to understand what they're telling themselves to
2117.64s:  model the degrees of freedom they have in a negotiated settlement, for example. And people often mistake,
2126.28s:  or have the mistaken assumption that Putin is Russia and that he's the only person that matters
2130.68s:  in Russia. That's not true. He exists in a political system. He has allies. He has adversaries. He has
2137.16s:  people who might be angling for his job like every other country. And he has certain
2142.76s:  limitations in his degrees of freedom. I think the two sides are astronomically far apart.
2149.00s:  And Russia has stated its intent to impose a solution militarily and to dare the US or NATO to do
2154.92s:  anything about it. Unless and until the US, IE Trump is willing to escalate to a nuclear conflict
2162.28s:  in our view, not being military experts, but having followed the conflict very closely, especially
2166.52s:  since the beginning of the year when we started studying it for a piece that we wrote.
2169.48s:  But there's not all that much the US can do, short of a nuclear war. And I don't think anybody
2175.56s:  wants a nuclear war. So I think Putin views time as being on his side. He's fighting a war of
2183.72s:  attrition. Russia is bigger or populist. Has a much more pronounced military industrial complex
2194.68s:  right next door to the line of contact. As is convoluted and tied to China and thousands of miles away.
2202.04s:  It's just not a war that we could have ever won. We had to win earlier where we were going to lose
2205.64s:  a grinding war. And the Russians, if anything, know how to march from east to west,
2210.92s:  you know, leveling towns along the way. I do think we're going to see a pressing crisis that might
2217.56s:  bring Trump in the west closer to Putin's demands. By the way, his demands are the four regions
2226.68s:  and a comprehensive settlement to the entire security situation in Europe, IE, no missiles in
2232.60s:  Germany, and never allowing Ukraine to join NATO and all of these, what the West would call
2238.60s:  extremist demands. Well, might is right. And if he imposes those conditions upon Ukraine,
2243.72s:  and we can't do anything about it, then we'll get there eventually. But one issue that I think
2248.04s:  might accelerate an end to the war on terms closer to Russia is the upcoming winter and the fact
2253.48s:  that the Russians have been, I believe, illegally targeting the Ukrainian electricity grid for
2258.44s:  destruction. And it's going to be a country that really just can't be lived in pretty soon if we
2263.88s:  have a cold winter. I see. Pivoting a little bit now, I want to talk a little bit more about the
2275.56s:  just energy sector reaction to things. And we've seen a bit of a mixed bag. What are your thoughts on
2284.60s:  nuclear power in the future for that? Bullish nuclear. Trump is very bullish nuclear.
2290.20s:  And the collapse of the environmental left will finally, you know, slay the last of the
2298.04s:  malfunctions, where opposed to nuclear power for silly reasons. So nuclear, totally bullish.
2305.72s:  Oil is a mixed bag. I think the initial response to his election was bearish, which is correct.
2312.20s:  And then we've seen a bit of a bounce back as the market digests the geopolitical uncertainties
2319.08s:  of Trump's views on Iran and Israel. He is a unknown or a chaotic actor in that regard.
2326.68s:  And so if he resolves the Middle East and we could get some form of peace in Ukraine,
2334.44s:  Joe Baby Drill is just unabashedly bearish for oil prices, bearish for oil producers,
2340.76s:  and bullish for oil service providers because there's going to be more volume pumped. That's sort of
2345.96s:  the superficial 20,000-foot view of it all. A lot of ifs in there. But the all things being equal
2355.32s:  and no World War III, the direction of oil is down. OPEC is in big trouble.
2362.52s:  Trump is going to unleash the American oil and gas producers. They have very little track record
2368.84s:  of being disciplined in this regard. If they can drill, they will drill. And to model otherwise,
2375.48s:  I think, a silly. And Trump wants them as well. He wants cheap hydrocarbons to feed the industrial
2381.48s:  revolution that he sees in the ensuring of the military industrial complex supply chains.
2387.80s:  What do you make of the... There's like the... I forgot the thing that he decided to call it,
2394.92s:  but it's one of the things that he's looking to use Elon Musk for. There's like the government
2399.64s:  efficiency. Yeah, the Dodge. Yeah. Yeah. Is Elon calls it, but whatever it'll end up being.
2407.00s:  What do you think about that? I think that's going to be way harder than Elon thinks. Elon's used to
2411.80s:  walking in with a sink to Twitter and being a dictator. First of all, if it's a cabinet level
2417.96s:  position, he'd have to be approved by the Senate. That won't be a short putt given his rather
2425.32s:  colorful contest. But beyond that, the hardest thing to do in Washington is to fire a government
2430.76s:  employee. And the unions have power. They have laws behind them. That one is going to be more
2438.44s:  challenging. I think removing rules and regulations through the stroke of a pan is far easier.
2445.56s:  Cutting out $2 trillion of federal expenditures is a whole different animal altogether. And frankly,
2451.48s:  many on the Republican side don't want that to happen either because it's a unit party of pork
2456.20s:  being distributed. And it's all one giant grift. There's not like there's an army of physical
2462.76s:  disciplinarians on the Republican side that have been held back by the left. There's a very small
2467.40s:  number of honorable physical disciplinarians on the Republican side and a few on the left. But
2475.88s:  nowhere near a plurality or let alone a majority. And so I think it's easy to say I will cut
2481.48s:  $2 trillion for the budget. Let's see if you can do it. And another reason why I don't think it's
2486.44s:  going to happen is because that wouldn't be catastrophic for GDP. It would tip the country into
2490.36s:  recession. And Trump likes his numbers to go up. So then how do those reckons are? I don't think
2497.32s:  they do. I think we just stay on this fiscal dominance path. And Trump, you know, makes the numbers
2503.56s:  go up, including the debt, including the deficit, GDP, be it nominal or not, oil production.
2510.20s:  Again, the only number of the board he wants to see go down is gasoline prices.
2516.20s:  What do you think about the tax incentive he's looking at rolling out where would reduce corporate
2521.80s:  taxes to I think 15 percent? Yeah, look, he wants to extend his tax cuts, you know, they accept
2527.72s:  the expire in 2025. And that's why the outcome of the House races is so critical. That's another
2532.44s:  example. Like you can't cut taxes and be unable to cut spending and then expect that like the
2541.16s:  deficit's going to go down. I think, look, Trump is inflationary. Let's be very clear. Like you
2546.28s:  need to pivot. The current US president is an inflationary force. Re-shoring is inflationary.
2555.48s:  The only deflationary impact is abundant energy and it's a significant one. But on balance,
2560.52s:  Trump is inflationary and should be modeled as such.
2566.28s:  So then I guess to zoom in on that though, do you think that companies are likely to respond to
2572.12s:  that? Do you think that companies are happier just taking the 5 percent hit on production and
2578.92s:  continuing to try externally? Do you think that there's a potential for this,
2582.36s:  actually, meaningfully move production of various things to within US borders?
2587.80s:  Oh, it's going to move the needle. Yeah. And they now have four years of regulatory certainty,
2595.56s:  which is like forever in politics, right? And so yeah, and by the way, like 95 percent of them
2602.36s:  voted for Trump. So like this is, they have all the cards now. This is the point of our next
2609.88s:  piece. Like this is a profound earth shattering, meaningful historic event that happened earlier
2618.28s:  this week. The game has changed and the extent to which the game has changed and the amount of
2625.96s:  changing that happens over the next four years is going to be well beyond what I think
2632.20s:  even the most aggressive people are modeling today for sure.
2634.84s:  What do you think about immigration? I think he's going to do everything he said he's going to do.
2645.08s:  Look, it's, it's, look, as an immigrant to the US who followed the rules and took many,
2653.24s:  many years to eventually become a citizen, you know, and when I was immigrating, I never forgot
2658.04s:  that I was a privileged guest of the US government. I'm torn on the subject. The US needs
2664.52s:  legal immigration. It needs the number and training and backgrounds of the people that it should
2671.96s:  want to select into the country. I think who becomes a US citizen is well within the sovereign domain
2679.00s:  of the US government and look at countries like Australia, they do it or even Canada, they do it
2684.12s:  on a merit-based system, a point system. The issue, which I think drove a lot of people to the
2691.64s:  tolls is the quote-unquote illegal immigration. I have deep sympathy for people who want to come to
2697.40s:  the US and to make it better lies for themselves because I was once one of those people and I have
2703.08s:  made a better life for myself in this amazing, wonderful country. But at the same time, you have to
2708.68s:  follow the rules, but then the counter to that is sometimes it's very difficult to know what the
2713.40s:  rules are. Like the rules of your current situation when you're coming over the border might make
2718.52s:  that decision a no-brainer from a Game 3 perspective get there and try to stay as opposed to
2723.88s:  trying to find a legal way to get there in the first place. And so I very mixed emotions on it,
2729.64s:  but objectively as an analyst, he is going to deport a lot of illegal immigrants. It's going to
2735.88s:  be very destructive for people who came here believing there were a different set of rules.
2741.00s:  It's going to be deeply polarizing and I believe you should take him at his word is what he's
2750.84s:  going to do. What do you think the impact is there to industry? I think it's another inflationary
2756.68s:  force. Look, one of the dirty secrets is a lot of big companies like illegal immigration because
2762.68s:  it gives them access to cheap labor, especially in the agricultural sector.
2767.80s:  And there's a lot of jobs that quote unquote the current youth of America don't necessarily want to
2775.72s:  do or have been taught that they shouldn't do that they should go to college and such work has
2779.00s:  been eaten. I don't subscribe to such things, but that's just the reality of the situation we have.
2785.08s:  So it is inflationary, sorry inflationary and it is going to provoke violence, I think.
2793.08s:  It's going to add fuel to societal upheaval, but I think we should take him at his word
2801.48s:  that this is what he's going to do. What do you think about the US,
2807.48s:  Mexico, Canada agreement agreement and the renegotiation he talks about there? I think if
2813.16s:  if the flow over the Mexican border doesn't stop he'll tear it up because he needs
2817.72s:  he's threatening to raise tariffs on Mexico if they don't play ball on immigration. I suspect
2822.52s:  they will by the way, I think. And by the way, the message will go out that this is no longer in
2827.88s:  your best interest from a game through your perspective to take that risk. I think he's going to
2832.52s:  cut off any benefits that he can to those that are here as a way to sort of drive them out.
2837.48s:  Because it's a catastrophe, a humane situation that both sides bear a significant responsibility
2847.72s:  for allowing to have gotten to this point and for the ugliness that I fear will soon follow.
2855.96s:  But again, our objective as analysts is to observe the pieces on the board and predict the
2863.64s:  movements not necessarily to wish for one outcome or to advocate for an outcome.
2868.76s:  And speaking of predicting movements, as you look across just the way things are going now
2877.40s:  into summarize at a high level, what are the top three to five pieces that you see moving in their
2885.08s:  impacts? Obviously, we already talked about a couple of them, things like oil, glass, oil and gas,
2890.52s:  climate change. What other things come to mind though? Yeah, massive deregulation, substantial
2897.08s:  investment in flationary forces, cheap energy, abundant energy, political polarization.
2905.48s:  And I think Trump is the beginning of a worldwide movement. I think the impact of Trump
2914.20s:  in this last election, we already saw it look the government in Germany collapsed within 24 hours
2919.16s:  of Trump winning. I think the UK is going down to go a significant reconsideration of its politics.
2924.76s:  The European Union might not survive it. The Middle East is going to be totally reshaped.
2932.20s:  He is a historically consequential figure. There has never been another. Probably won't ever be
2939.88s:  another. And the next four years are going to be a hell of a ride. What do you think about the
2946.92s:  reshaping of the Middle East? Yeah, much depends on how Iran is real shakes out. And I just don't
2953.80s:  know. I don't have an edge. I don't have sources. I don't can't say that I can predict that I know
2959.08s:  what his objectives are, whether that can happen over there remains to be seen. Israel is in a very
2964.60s:  precarious position, by the way. I mean, if you cut through the propaganda and you actually go in
2969.24s:  and take a look at what actually is going on, it is a very foreign society. They're a democracy.
2977.88s:  Netanyahu is not a dictator. There is very strong arguments going on inside of Israel as to the
2985.16s:  wisdom of the current response to the October 7th attacks. This is the faint ability of this response.
2992.44s:  How the IDF is doing in Lebanon is a very interesting thing to ask and to ponder.
2999.16s:  And we've written about some of the vulnerabilities of Israel and how Iran's attack on
3004.76s:  October 1st may have exposed them. So count us in a camp that hopes that Trump can lead to a
3011.80s:  lasting peace or at least a day-tunt in the region because war is always the abject failure of
3018.20s:  diplomacy. Look, if you can bring both wars to an end, I think you should get a Nobel priest
3024.12s:  prank. I mean, not that he will. But I'm all enough to remember when seeking peace was a liberal
3029.72s:  attribute and one that was rewarded. So we shall see it's going to be a fascinating 90 days.
3036.44s:  For sure. I think Q1 2025 is going to be historic.
3045.88s:  One more question not related to the presidency, but just in general. We're obviously going through
3051.48s:  an earning cycle now. What do you make of that? I think the crime is doing mostly fine.
3056.92s:  Again, when you have fiscal stimulus, the likes of which we're seeing and dirt cheap
3063.48s:  abundant hydrocarbons, American companies are going to do fine. I think the economy is running
3070.68s:  roughly along the GDP numbers of the government prints. I look at natural gas at $2.50 million
3078.84s:  BTO right now. I mean, that's dirt cheap. That's a very valuable hydrocarbons that does an enormous
3084.44s:  amount of work that feeds hundreds of cogeneration facilities within the browns field sites of
3089.96s:  heavy industry where they take that natural gas and they make both industrial grade steam and
3094.92s:  electricity with very high efficiencies. And the fact that our industry supply chains can do it
3100.44s:  at a fraction of the globes is a huge advantage and explains why we didn't go into a recession
3106.84s:  before the election. So I think earning season, a couple of big companies set the tone for everything
3113.40s:  and we'll have to see how they all end up reporting. But by and large, I think the economy is fine
3121.08s:  and we'll see what the Trump effect will be.
3126.52s:  Eager. That's just what comes to mind. I'm very, very curious what this whole thing ends
3132.12s:  playing out as. But I always really appreciate the nuance of your perspectives and taking the time
3139.00s:  to get into some of those details there. The last thing I want to ask you before we wrap up.
3145.80s:  Right now we're going through it looks like financial sector flying obviously starting to
3151.96s:  you know, price in the expectation of deregulation and whatnot. Looking out before JP Morgan
3159.96s:  Goldman Sachs, they were starting to forecast a higher probability not super high, but a higher
3165.96s:  probability of recession in 2025. What are the prospects for a recession as it sits now in your
3170.52s:  eyes? I mean, you eventually have to have one. It's been a while since we have. Look, I think the
3174.92s:  banks are flying because of the prospect of not coming in at M&A boom. I think the FTC, you know,
3181.80s:  changing leadership of the FTC is one of the number one desires of Wall Street. And so I think,
3189.24s:  you know, Matt Stuller was just out with a great piece on Substack making this point earlier.
3193.56s:  But as far as recession in 2025 goes, I mean, it's hard to see. This is going to be a boom.
3204.28s:  People can flate fiscal spending and deficits and ever increasing debt and money printing as
3214.44s:  being bad. And they are, I suppose, in context, but but not in a short term. Right? I mean,
3223.48s:  there's a reason why it's called a sugar high. Now the crash will eventually come. Do I think the
3227.72s:  crash comes in 2025? I don't know. The US is still the global reserve currency and has a lot of
3238.60s:  runway in this regard. And and seems intent on keeping the party going. So looking less until you see
3246.76s:  a long bond blown out to six or seven or eight percent, then we have a different discussion,
3252.36s:  I suppose. So big old TBD. We'll see how the bonds do. Money printer go per. Yeah. I tell you what,
3260.92s:  that thing can work in overtime. So well, by the way, let's love one last point that I think
3267.40s:  runs counter to the sort of recession narrative. As China's not just going to sit there,
3273.16s:  and Xi might be provoked into firing the big bazooka in response to Trump's tariffs and his
3280.92s:  protectionist isolationist ambitions. And if you have a giant bazooka coming out of China,
3286.28s:  that that liquidity is going to slosh around the world and find its way to our markets too.
3290.92s:  So, you know, in a race to the top, there are too many boats sunk to the bottom. So I would,
3297.80s:  if you pushed me, I would fade a recession in 2025. You heard it here first.
3304.04s:  Just don't remind me if I'm wrong, right, brother?
3306.04s:  Well, obviously, we just focus on the times that we're like, yeah, those are the important ones.
3313.24s:  Duneberg and team, I always say and team because I know that there's other people that make
3316.44s:  the whole thing happen over there. So I'm as always super thankful to catch up, always enjoy
3321.40s:  discussing. Obviously, people can find you on your website, which I will throw to in the video
3326.12s:  description below, but anything else you want to leave people with?
3329.16s:  Now, duneberg.com, find everything there. Our pieces, our protier, our podcast appearances.
3333.88s:  We were also very active on sub-stack notes, which is their version of Twitter, which is becoming
3338.52s:  actually quite active. And so we're trying our best to be like we once were on Twitter while we
3344.36s:  were still active on that platform. Eric, always a great pleasure to talk to you.
3347.88s:  Looking forward to it the next time. Absolutely awesome. We'll see you guys later.
