0.00s: What's up outliers?
2.00s: Happy Monday, no trading today except for some futures action and even that's been really,
7.32s: really slow.
8.32s: The goal for the video today is to do a little bit of a look ahead on the market, what's
13.48s: coming up and just what the market looks like it's setting up as for the week, how I'm
17.32s: thinking about it at least.
19.00s: And then I want to walk you through four of my recent trades just to give you an idea
23.08s: of some of the things that I'm looking at, why I'm looking at them and how I'm fitting
26.84s: them into the portfolio.
28.68s: So that's the agenda.
29.68s: I do want to start with this, what you see in front of you here.
32.36s: For those that are familiar with the channel, you know that I have a stats background and
36.32s: I really enjoy conducting data analysis.
39.48s: It sounds kind of weird to say that out loud.
42.00s: It makes me sad for myself to a degree, but I genuinely do find this stuff interesting.
45.88s: I actually couldn't tell you why.
48.08s: And what I took a look at here is analyzing the average weekly return in spy for the past
56.20s: 15 years.
57.60s: When I compared it versus a short and I labeled it long, but that's a standard trading
62.16s: week.
63.16s: So short is essentially if there's at least one day closed of the market.
67.24s: So this week Monday closed, if it's Monday, Tuesday closed, that would still fall into
71.40s: short.
72.40s: And then long is just standard.
73.64s: So Monday through Friday markets open.
76.04s: And a couple things jumped out of me here.
78.12s: The first thing is I actually thought both of these would be a little bit larger in terms
82.00s: of severity.
83.84s: And this highlighted a really interesting change in paradigm that I'm not used to seeing.
90.60s: And it's because if you think about it in the last 15 years, rather than that 15 year
95.28s: period, essentially being kicked off by a bear market 2007, 2008, 2009 kind of like that
101.68s: timeframe, that then just turned into a progressive nonstop bull market.
106.20s: It's actually a different snapshot shot.
107.80s: Now when we look at this stuff and it's pretty cool because we've had two bear markets.
112.72s: We've had one in 2020 when we saw that COVID crash.
118.00s: And even though that was a quick bear market that ended up being a positive year, it still
122.32s: was a bear market for like three days.
125.32s: And then the second was in 2022 when the market was down like 19.4%.
130.56s: That was a really interesting year.
132.20s: So that starts to change a little bit of the data that we'll pick up.
136.64s: And it's actually kind of cool to see that because again, this is looking at weekly
140.28s: snapshots.
141.60s: So as we go through that COVID crash, this does have an impact.
145.80s: And with two bear markets in those time frames, we know markets tend to crash down and then
151.96s: take the stairs up elevator downstairs up is the common saying.
155.12s: So this will impact data sets like this.
156.96s: I highlight this for you because even if you don't choose to do this kind of data, it
162.04s: doesn't, you know, tickling or fancy like it does for me.
165.52s: When you're receiving this information, you should have that context because a lot of
169.68s: people do really terrible data analysis in my opinion where we're trying to essentially
174.40s: look for what we want to find, not what's there.
177.72s: And it can really skew our perception.
179.60s: So anyways, that's the first observation that both of these were smaller in terms of
183.84s: severity than I thought.
185.92s: The second thing I thought was interesting is if we take a look again from a stats perspective,
191.16s: you don't know what these black bars are.
193.28s: It's kind of like a standard error bar.
194.84s: It's almost like a candle, right?
196.12s: It's almost like high low.
197.76s: It just shows you standard deviation, how much deviation from this average is there based
202.28s: on the period that we look at.
203.68s: And we can see that standard trading weeks definitely have longer tails to the downside
207.96s: and slightly shorter tails to the upside.
210.52s: And we can also see that short trading weeks again, where at least one day is closed,
214.76s: if not more during the trading week, that we have a pretty significant multiple higher,
220.28s: again, still very small.
221.88s: We're into three decimal points for this to even become relevant.
225.48s: So technically speaking from a statistical perspective, I would actually call this kind
229.84s: of thing insignificant.
231.36s: It's just based on the scale.
233.28s: It looks bigger than it is.
234.80s: What?
235.80s: What's on my wife?
238.04s: But when I look at this, it's, I find it interesting because obviously I can see artifacts
244.32s: of positive drift.
245.32s: I can see that being amplified slightly during short trading weeks.
248.88s: And for those that enjoy trading things like volatility and whatnot, this is actually
252.48s: quite interesting because trading volatility over long weekends is quite lucrative.
256.96s: And that's actually not one of the trades I'm going to talk about today, but something
260.60s: to be aware of for my options trading people.
263.56s: All right.
264.56s: Well, that aside, let's take a look at the market.
266.48s: What's going on here?
267.48s: So we still have this very interesting series of patterns.
271.56s: And I'm specifically talking about the top three that you see here.
275.36s: So Spy, QQQ, IWM.
276.96s: The reason why these are interesting is if we take a look at even these standard deviation
282.44s: channels, they're completely different slopes for the same time frame.
286.12s: The slope that you see for IWM is much steeper than what you see in Spy, although both
290.72s: are positive sloping and QQs is actually negative sloping.
294.44s: This does not look good for tech in my opinion.
298.20s: Now what this turns into, I also have no idea.
301.32s: But one of the things that really surprised me is when we had Nvidia report earnings,
305.88s: it was an insanely solid earnings, but it wasn't perfect by the market standards or expectations
310.96s: I should say.
312.56s: And Nvidia sold off a bit.
315.00s: So some of that could be short term price extremes based on again, these different perceptions
321.28s: that will take a little while to price in.
323.68s: But I have to be honest, as I look at this, I am surprised to see tech trailing down like
330.32s: this.
331.32s: I really am.
332.32s: Now, hopefully this is just a consolidation period.
334.20s: I say hopefully because I want to trade tech, it can be so explosive to the upside.
338.48s: And I'm also trying to rotate out of a T-Triple Q's position that I have that looks good,
343.00s: but I still have to wait like two more weeks for these short calls to make up their mind
346.84s: where either I can take them down out of profit or not, but they've been under water for
349.76s: a while under water meaning that the trades profitable, but the short calls have been in
354.24s: the money and now they're like right at the money.
356.64s: So I'm waiting for that.
358.04s: So this actually bodes well for that trade specifically, but I would much rather trade
362.66s: tech to the upside because I've been using leveraged products, whether it's T-Triple
366.16s: Q's or again, my intent is to rotate into futures at this point because I think these
370.88s: kind of like big severe moves seem to be slowing down in this case.
376.36s: Now, I'm waiting.
379.36s: Now this is not where I would put on new trades and tech if as a trader, right?
383.76s: Like is investor, this actually looks kind of good, a little bit of a value area.
388.36s: But from a trading perspective, I would want it to be moving in my direction.
392.20s: And in this case, it is clearly not doing that.
394.28s: It's just kind of, you know, trend and sideways here, which is fine, but something to keep
398.48s: an eye on.
399.60s: Now this move in the Russell has been interesting because we can see that it's sort of starting
405.62s: to catch up with where spy is, but it's still trailing.
409.58s: So if we take a look at this, the term highs on the three month chart inspire 565 against
414.10s: 563.
415.10s: We are essentially back at highs in the spy, not so in IWM, but we're not that far off.
423.70s: So the term high here is 228 and we're at 220.
428.14s: So still not in insignificant gap off of that high, but we're moving closer into this
433.14s: general area of congestion before we hit that peak.
436.58s: So take away from my perspective.
439.98s: Here's what I'm seeing.
440.98s: First thing, spy, variance risk premiums do not look good.
444.70s: They haven't looked good for a few weeks now, which is again, you can't trade off of
449.86s: this directly because on different time frames, it can still look good.
453.62s: So actually zero DTEs have been running pretty healthy.
457.54s: So remember, this is looking at 30 day vol.
460.94s: Now that's one observation.
463.70s: Spy starting to consolidate second observation.
466.90s: I think that it's likely for us to continue trending sideways here until we see some sort
472.90s: of next news event, whatever that looks like, whether that's the Fed reaffirming more
479.18s: this rate cut, although I am starting to believe most of this initial cut is going to be
484.94s: priced in already.
486.30s: And I think that's part of the reason why we saw IWM start to rally.
489.82s: But at this point, I think we need a new catalyst, whatever that is, but status quo will be
497.06s: not really held for very long because as you'll see in a little bit, we have some events
500.94s: coming up this week.
502.54s: QQQ, this just looks honestly, like I said, ugly to me, all of these moving averages
508.18s: are getting super, super congested.
510.34s: Price is kind of rotating through some of the shorter term moving averages, consolidating
514.34s: on the longer.
515.50s: It's below the three month point of control, which I don't love.
518.70s: And if we look on a six month, we still have a giant gap.
521.74s: So longer time frames, this still looks really good, but on a shorter term time frame, it
526.46s: doesn't quite look as appealing to me.
529.38s: So this to me is kind of in a holding pattern.
532.46s: This is something I would trade either still slightly, directionally bullish, but expect
537.42s: to manage the downside quickly or trade it sideways.
541.66s: And then I'm waiting for a breakout.
543.50s: So as soon as we start seeing stuff cracking above 484, starts to look interesting to me,
549.78s: 478 would be the first threshold we got to get above, which is the point of control
553.98s: than near term highs here so that we can continue this progression because there is a positive.
559.22s: The positive is although we have not hit a higher high, we have hit a higher low so
567.58s: far.
568.58s: So that still is a general consolidation pattern as far as I'm concerned.
572.90s: Right?
573.90s: So we can see that higher, higher is here.
575.98s: We're not there yet, but you don't always have to run right up to this higher high.
580.46s: It's common.
581.46s: So if you look at this, we have this higher high relative to the time frame before, then
586.54s: we have a low higher high, a low higher.
590.14s: This is a lower high than here that then came down and then rallied back up.
595.66s: So this in and of itself doesn't necessarily bowed bearish in my opinion, but it bodes
601.02s: watch versus super bearish or bullish either really.
606.22s: I need to see what it does.
608.06s: And then small caps, I still feel bullish and I'm surprised that they're lagging as they
613.50s: are, but they are.
614.98s: I see net highs lows in the New York Stock Exchange still looks really, really solid.
620.54s: So yeah, this one I can't help but find slightly curious that it's moving the way it is.
627.14s: I would expect this to be driving a little bit more.
631.06s: Now let's take a quick look across the sectors and take a look at this.
638.34s: We see XLB crushing it.
641.22s: We see XLF crushing it.
643.34s: We see XLI crushing it.
645.58s: XLP is doing well, starting to consolidate, but still doing well.
649.66s: Same thing for XLRE, starting to consolidate, but hanging right at highs.
653.50s: XLU, XLV, what I find fascinating here is for so long, for so long, when we look at technology,
661.26s: that was propping up the S&P 500.
663.78s: Now we have the negative momentum in the SM in tech being negated by all of these other
671.90s: sectors that are actually driving this performance within the S&P 500.
676.70s: So there's internal divergence.
678.02s: We're not seeing participation across all the sectors across the board, which is again
681.78s: fairly normal, but it means that I would be a little selective with where I'm putting
688.10s: my money as I am right now.
690.22s: So I have long exposure in S&P futures, but I don't have it right now in small caps.
697.90s: And even though I like that trade and I don't have it right now in the queues, although
703.38s: again, I'm waiting because I want to establish there, but I want to unwind this T-Trop
707.46s: Accus position first.
709.30s: So that's a quick look across the different sectors.
713.02s: Like I said, during the live stream later today, we'll go through some scans and see what
716.86s: kind of interesting trades and stuff like that we can find.
719.26s: But wanted to take a look at this quickly with you.
722.06s: Now the other thing I want to run through is what we have coming up for the week ahead.
729.62s: So I'm just going to update this to be this week.
733.02s: And then we'll see what's on the docket.
735.78s: So again, we're starting with some important metrics that really pertain to inflation.
744.34s: Manufacturing prices, PMI, global manufacturing PMI, these as per usual will be interpreted
750.34s: in the lens of inflation and impact of inflation.
754.78s: So this is something I keep an eye on because if there's some big news that breaks from
760.94s: these, it has an overwhelming probability of moving the market.
765.58s: Then as I look across the fourth, big things I see here, job openings.
771.66s: And then I like the beige book just to read through it, but it's not anything that I think
775.82s: is going to be ultra market moving as of right now.
779.58s: Now the two thing I do want to highlight though is the job openings here and non-farm
784.26s: employment change and jobless claims.
787.30s: I think these actually are going to be really, really emphasized this coming week because
793.50s: of the revision we recently saw.
795.74s: So the market I think is very interested in these metrics and to see like how they're
801.38s: moving after the previous revision.
804.06s: So two of those are on the fifth here.
807.22s: Then also on the fifth we have services, PMI and then the composite, which again, inflation
814.18s: level metrics, those are going to be interpreted in that lens.
817.74s: The fifth has a ton of stuff coming out.
819.70s: So it also is coming from ISM in addition to S&P.
824.22s: Then on the sixth, we have unemployment rate, same thing kind of what I was referencing
832.10s: before, non-farm payroll.
833.54s: So again, just this employment stuff I think will be interpreted in the lens of the recent
837.46s: revision.
839.18s: And that looks mostly it.
841.50s: So if we take a look out of curiosity, how the market feels about that this week, let's
847.90s: take a peek.
848.90s: We'll grab SPX and let's take a look at the volatility that we're seeing across this
855.42s: week.
856.42s: So I'll open this one up.
857.86s: The reason why I open this one up is because it helps me just clearly see where the
861.02s: vols are.
862.22s: So we can see Tuesday a little bit higher, Wednesday lower, Thursday lower and then Friday
869.10s: is a bit of a peek.
870.86s: So the stuff that we have coming out on 6EP is actually being priced in a little heavier
876.66s: for the market based on what we can see up front.
878.58s: This is one way I like to look at that, which is just super fast.
881.86s: The other way you can look at this exact things.
883.58s: If you look at the implied volatility here, I would want the out of the monies.
886.90s: I would kill all these other series and I would just look at this week.
890.78s: I can see the same exact thing as I do up above, but it's just a little bit of a quicker,
896.54s: quicker view in my opinion.
897.54s: But this is another way you can look at that.
899.66s: So yeah, that's what the market's looking like.
901.58s: Now, I wanted to talk to you about a few trades that I have on and had on.
906.50s: So one of them actually is in NEM.
909.14s: And this is on the 27th of aug.
911.38s: I opened in 18 oct 50 put for $1.16 per lot.
916.94s: I'm just quoting these in single lots because the number of lots doesn't really change anything
921.14s: about the trade other than the size, right?
924.38s: But the way I'm thinking about it, the analysis, all that stuff is the same.
928.14s: So typically what I'm quoting these trades, unless I'm doing like a specific trade review
931.70s: where I'll go through the sizing and the methodology there for these, I'm just quoting
935.70s: in one lot, but none of them are.
938.14s: Now for NEM, the reason for the short put was when I saw the market kind of rallying
946.70s: up here, it looked like it was starting to consolidate.
949.46s: So I put it on in this period here and I just had a really tight stop.
954.54s: Now this is a little bit of a two-pronged trade because you'll actually notice that
961.02s: VAL is relatively low.
963.30s: But even though VAL is low, risk premiums are not.
967.70s: Risk premiums look pretty good here.
969.78s: They're converging a little bit, but you can see when I put the trade on, risk premiums
973.38s: actually were quite healthy.
975.30s: So this is a little bit of a put-scu style trade and it's also gaining me exposure to
981.86s: the energy sector, which right now has been performing a little bit better than some
986.22s: of the other sectors.
987.22s: So that's the idea behind this one.
990.78s: And it's, I think they're trading for like 80 cents or something like that right now.
994.22s: So I'll give it a little bit longer, but I'm essentially just slowly moving my stop
998.14s: up.
999.14s: This was my original soft stop.
1001.22s: Now this is my soft stop.
1002.74s: And I just kind of ratchet it up slowly, slowly, slowly.
1006.18s: And we'll see, but this is just benefiting from the passage of time.
1009.10s: This fits into the portfolio for a million different reasons.
1012.14s: It's giving me positive theta.
1013.66s: I'm not expecting necessarily rock star movement from this at this point.
1017.98s: It's already had a massive, massive run.
1019.98s: I've traded this before.
1021.22s: You can see these other little highlights that I have from previous positions that I've
1026.06s: put on in here.
1027.30s: So this is just kind of going back to the well.
1029.58s: But I'm establishing a slightly different position in here just to fit the portfolio
1033.46s: well.
1034.46s: So that's pretty much it there.
1036.14s: Now the other trade I wanted to talk about is ASTS because this is an example where I
1041.18s: did actually sell a put spread.
1046.10s: And the reason why I sold a put spread is because rather than worrying about stopping out
1051.34s: on the trade or setting some sort of stop for something like this that has pretty high
1056.10s: movement, right?
1057.10s: So if we look at the 5-day movement average five days is 12%.
1060.70s: And if we look at the 28, 17%.
1063.98s: So the probability of getting stopped out in something like this is really high for
1068.78s: the way that I would trade.
1070.30s: So here essentially, I was able to put on a 20 September 29, 28 put credit spread for
1077.02s: 40 cents.
1078.26s: So it's a dollar wide.
1079.82s: And the reason why I stuck with the dollar wide versus widening them out is because of
1086.42s: the edge I was able to derive from this because for a dollar wide credit spread neutral based
1091.54s: on standard 30 delta short putt would be 33 cents is what I would need for like a for
1097.74s: a neutrally expectant put credit spread.
1101.58s: So here is able to get 40 cents.
1103.58s: And when I modeled the $2 wide, the $5 wide, it didn't have the same edge that these did
1109.86s: at the time that I put the trade on under 27th.
1112.34s: So just let this baby ride.
1114.14s: These are under water right now.
1115.98s: So you can see that I put them on here.
1121.18s: And they still would be a profit if we hang out here, but if we continue lower, then that
1127.10s: would be no good for them.
1128.34s: But don't really care because again, these are spreads.
1131.66s: So I just leave them, set them forget it, they'll either work or they don't work.
1135.18s: That's all there is to it.
1137.10s: The other one I want to talk about is GIS.
1141.10s: And this is just because this thing has been popping up on a million of my scanners.
1144.98s: It's showing a ton of strength.
1147.06s: So here on the 27th, I ended up selling the 20 September 70 puts for 98 cents.
1155.18s: So that's right in here.
1158.26s: And same thing you can see these I don't even have a stop on because it essentially has
1162.50s: been popping up on my alerts.
1164.42s: But as I look at that trade and where we are now, I essentially would look at something
1170.02s: below this level as my soft stop.
1175.42s: So kind of when I would first want to hear about it.
1178.46s: And then these again, just another way you'll notice most of these are selling strategies.
1185.26s: It's because the portfolio needed a bunch of these to offset some of the other positions
1189.58s: and overall theta.
1191.58s: And then the last one here is already up and down.
1194.26s: So this trade is down.
1196.14s: But it's NKLA.
1197.66s: You can see the same levels I've had on.
1199.94s: I've traded this for variances premiums now essentially for three months.
1205.50s: I've been trading them.
1206.86s: So these have been just really, really, really solid.
1210.34s: And here I had short strangles and 20 SAP.
1213.10s: It was the nine and the six.
1215.38s: And yeah, I mean, they're paying really healthy premiums, even though the implied volatility
1220.46s: percentile is low.
1222.26s: Still this is another example again, where the variances premiums are super solid.
1227.26s: So you can see how I've been trading it all in here.
1230.62s: And Vol has just been trending pretty consistently right above what we're seeing for implied.
1236.46s: So just a few things that I've been doing.
1238.06s: These are all speculative allocation of the portfolio, smaller trades.
1242.30s: And then the core allocation is still kind of in what I was reviewing earlier.
1247.46s: So yeah, again, I don't talk too much about what I'm doing all the time just because I
1251.42s: don't necessarily think it's really pertinent to people because what I do is what I do.
1256.06s: But I also know that sometimes people will reach out and ask me like, what I'm doing,
1259.62s: how I'm looking at the market.
1260.62s: So I totally get that and I'm happy to accommodate and wrap it up into stuff like this.
1264.78s: So as always, if you have any questions, let me know.
1267.02s: I hope we have an absolutely awesome week ahead.
1268.90s: I'll see you all during the live streams.
1270.42s: We got a bunch of them being outlier.
1272.42s: I'll see you guys later.
