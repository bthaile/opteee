0.00s: What's up, outliers? Happy Friday. It is time. We have our next segment of options trading
10.44s: for beginners. I'm going to grab the chat so that I can keep up with you all. It looks
15.54s: like we already got Reese and Sposecar in here. Good to see you both. So the vision for
21.80s: today is pretty simple. I want to walk through some basic scenarios with you all, hopefully
32.18s: pulling some of them from you. And the way that I envision this going is ideally we'll
39.50s: be able to mix some different cases, some from your personal experiences and talking
46.42s: about what happened and why we'll talk about some from mine. But I primarily want to
52.62s: focus our attention on things that we can find from the rest of the trading world. So what
59.06s: that means is actually poking through Reddit and looking at some of the things that people
65.50s: are looking at struggling with so on and so forth because you can find a lot of really
70.30s: interesting discussion points from Reddit. So for those, for those that think Reddit
77.30s: is really only for toxic conversations and stuff like that. I mean, it is for that, but
83.42s: it's not just for that. We have a couple other uses that we can pull from Reddit. Looks
89.34s: like we also got Elon songs in Shrej. We got the we got the gang in town. So that's the
98.16s: vision for today. Now to kick us off, I'm going to walk through a little bit of some general
105.02s: questions. And the idea here again is they're kind of like a quiz. We'll call it a quiz.
111.52s: You are rated on your performance. And you do have the opportunity to potentially win fake
117.98s: internet points, which is pretty sick. I like to think the ability to win some fake internet
124.36s: points. But the main thing is I just kind of want to use these to warm us up for the conversation.
129.40s: Now in the meantime though, I would love for you to share with me some of your recent
139.12s: trading experiences, either something that worked differently than you expected. That's
147.48s: the first scenario. If you have any of those. And then the second thing is something that
153.16s: you learned for the first time. So either of those are great fits for this part. The reason
160.48s: I asked that second question is ideally to start the flow of information sharing laterally.
168.36s: That's why I like to ask that question. And then the first question is because it gives
173.12s: us an opportunity to explore a concept together. So first question is something that happened
181.04s: in it didn't work out as you expected for some reason or another. And then the second
185.16s: one is anything that you knew for the first time either or that you learned for the first
189.80s: time I should say. It looks like we also got Dom. We got Dr. Zayus in threshold solutions.
196.88s: That's a cool ass name to be honest. We got Ben. Cool. All right. So let's start with
202.92s: the quiz. Shall we let me grab a note pad or something and then I'll write the questions
210.88s: out for you. Here we can do it through here. This might crash everything. I don't know.
215.92s: Sometimes this gets a little testy when I have too much stuff running kind of like I do
219.84s: right now. We'll see if it opens up. I'm just grabbing the white board for us so that I
226.52s: can show you the exact questions I want to ask. There it goes. Here we go. Look, this
233.80s: is even got the old name. ES invests. That's OG. Also for the folks that have been going
238.52s: through the different like links that I have all over the place and letting me know
242.92s: that stuff is broken, you guys are the true heroes because I have links everywhere. And
249.12s: obviously I do my best to keep them updated. But with this whole brand shift and kind of
254.08s: changing things, everything literally needs to be updated, which is kind of difficult
258.48s: to facilitate. All right. So Q1. What are the common for all IV to differ from put? Here's
272.32s: your first question. You might have to wrap it. Yeah. Give me one sec. Just because I've
278.64s: made the text obnoxiously massive. Let's see if that fits better. There you go. All right.
283.76s: Here's Q1. So I'll leave that in there and then I'll start working on the other questions.
288.80s: So the first question is you may or may not be able to read if you're listening. I'll
292.88s: read it to you. It says, what are the common reasons that call IV differs from put IV? That's
300.40s: question one. So if you know the answer, throw it into the chat. And then in the meantime,
307.48s: I'm writing up these other ones. There's only two other ones. Any guesses for question
324.92s: one? Here's question two. And then I got one more for you. Ben says activity on the chain.
338.60s: It's not wrong, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a more structural level
344.64s: response. It's not a bad guess, but I wouldn't give that credit.
350.28s: He says puts like insurance people willing to overpay. Elon song says hedging on puts.
358.56s: Okay. So those are technically correct. That's part of the reason. There are other reasons
366.68s: from a structural standpoint. So let's pretend that the put prices or let's say that the
372.84s: call and puts are actually priced closer to their theoretical equivalent, meaning that
378.20s: we wouldn't have that implied volatility variance. And we're looking more at a structural
385.20s: reason. I want to be clear, those answers from Reese and Elon songs are both correct.
391.20s: You both get plus one fake internet point. Those are completely correct. I'm just trying
395.76s: to walk you on to target for the other reasons that stem from a more structural perspective.
408.20s: Any other guesses? I can put my note pad down now. Okay. So let's think about other things
428.84s: that impact the price of an option. If we're thinking about options, there's an important
438.20s: but often overlooked inject is to how we arrive at prices. What's something that impacts
448.48s: calls that doesn't impact puts? I want you to think specifically about a scenario where
456.40s: you might be more likely to be assigned early. You're more likely to be assigned early
465.76s: on the in money call in a specific circumstance that is not the same for puts. What is that
470.68s: scenario? Any guesses? David in Reese. My man, Reese, you now get plus one fake internet
481.76s: point. I think you're now at plus two fake internet points. That's exactly correct.
488.76s: So the reason why you'll see call implied volatility differ from put implied volatility
496.08s: because it has this other element that impacts it that doesn't impact it the same as the
501.80s: put side. So again, abundantly clear from a practitioner standpoint, the first two answers
508.44s: from Liz and Reese were spot on. The fact that people are willing to overpay for puts
512.52s: is completely correct. Then there's another scenario that I'm just outlining now from
517.56s: a structural standpoint that also injects a slight nuance between the two products in
523.92s: the way that we would price them. So that's exactly correct. Nice job. So Reese right
528.12s: now has plus two. This game, you have to track your own points because I don't have the
534.60s: mindset to be able to maybe I need to figure out a scoreboard. Sooner or later, I might
538.96s: be able to do live streams like an actual live streamer and have resources and shit.
545.00s: But I don't know how to do any of that. So unfortunately right now it's track your own
548.48s: point. So Reese, I think you're at plus two though. Okay. So the next question, which is
553.24s: kind of related to what we were just talking about is why do we differentiate between
559.60s: American and European style options? Why do we even bother differentiating between those
565.68s: two things? Any guesses? There's a couple very, very specific reasons. Liz says expiration
576.28s: date exercising early with American options, which makes pricing more complicated. Yep,
581.20s: exactly. So Elon songs got it in right, Ben got it in right. So plus one fake internet
587.48s: point for Elon songs, Ben Reese, I think you also got it in at a time. So we'll give it
592.32s: to you as well. Dr. Zayas, I'll give it to you as well. That's completely correct. So
599.12s: the fact that they can be exercised or have different exercise rules leads to some important
606.40s: differences in how we interpret the positions, right? Because if we have something that we
614.88s: know as a seller can't be exercised up until expiration, that changes my risk profile
623.56s: significantly. Because for example, if we're looking at something like GameStop, Primetime
629.16s: example, because like this is literally the exact scenario that this would apply to.
633.16s: So if we take a look at GameStop and right now I have long shares and I have some short
639.56s: calls against my long shares. Okay. If I did not have my long shares, I would not have
652.24s: the short calls. Why is that? Why do you think I'm okay offering short calls against my
661.96s: long shares? But I'm not okay offering just short calls in something like GameStop.
669.52s: Beyond the fact that I don't want to fade it to the downside, don't want to do that.
674.08s: Reese says they're covered. Okay, go a little deeper though. I want a little bit more of
677.24s: a technical answer here. Why does that matter? The fact that they're covered. Reese says
683.20s: you could lose money to infinity. That's part of it. Still not exactly the answer I'm
688.68s: looking for. It's not wrong though, but you're on the right track there. That would be like
693.24s: a partial credit, although I'm not a partial credit kind of guy. So still no fake internet
698.16s: point for that. Although it's not wrong to be clear, I just have a very specific answer
702.32s: that I'm thinking about. You long song says, say, cue again. Happy to why would I be okay
709.40s: selling calls in GameStop against my shares, but not okay just selling calls in GameStop
717.56s: in an alternate scenario where I have no shares. So Reese already pointed out the fact
722.96s: that they're covered, which is the correct path to go down. Link it to what we were just
729.76s: talking about. This age says you want to be able to participate to the upside, not get
736.76s: blown out. That's moving the correct direction. BW says because you only lose the money
741.60s: that you have. Technically, I wouldn't lose any money with the covered calls. So that's
744.76s: not it. Reese is on it. Reese is on it right away. Early exercise. That's the danger. Why
757.40s: is early exercise so dangerous in this case? Because it's GameStop and it goes through
765.04s: these prolonged periods. So think of it this way. If let me, let me grab my handy dandy
771.14s: notepad, I think everybody always understands better with the notepad. I think this is
779.06s: scientifically proven that the notepad explains it. Okay, so we have scenario one scenario
786.30s: one where I have let's just call it plus 200 shares and short one call. So in this scenario
799.18s: like this, if this call right here gets assigned early, a very simple transaction occurs.
809.50s: I'm now going to sell 100 shares. Well, I already have 200 shares. So essentially, it's
817.06s: just going to sell 100 of my 200 shares, leaving me 100 shares. No problem. We're Gucci
823.90s: here. This is the other scenario that has to do with getting stuck. So in this case, I'm
832.38s: just short one call. Same scenario happens. There's early exercise. In this scenario now, I'm
842.98s: short 100 shares of a stock that's hard to borrow with typically four plus days to cover
853.22s: and I carry. This is why. Because if GameStop for example was a European style option and couldn't
871.14s: be exercised early. In this scenario, I can just ride out these moves because again, we want GameStop
880.42s: to go to the moon, but even if it does go to the moon, it probably will at some point descend back
886.66s: to earth. It's kind of like if you're fading volatility products. It's very similar. You can go
891.94s: through these massive expansions that can be very painful, but sooner or later, it does come back
898.74s: to a nominal level. It's the same thing with something like volatility products. Now the risk
906.66s: profile completely changes in this scenario because let's say I get assigned here for whatever reason
916.42s: and now I'm short 100 shares. The underlying starts flying up. It's already hard to borrow. So even
923.86s: as a retail trader, again, playing the scenario that I have a tiny position, short 100 shares,
928.90s: this difficulty to cover is not, it doesn't really apply in this scenario. This difficulty to cover
936.50s: comes into play when I have tens of thousands of shares. When I actually have a position, it's just
941.70s: important to understand that difference here. I'm just using a very small position as a general
946.18s: example. 100 shares is no problem. But if you have tens of thousands of shares, this actually
951.46s: becomes a bit of a problem because it also becomes difficult to locate, to carry the position,
959.86s: the broker struggles to find the shares, to loan them to you. So then in that scenario, they're
965.86s: going to charge you a higher interest rate to carry that short position because it's hard to borrow.
973.38s: This is why in something like this, being assigned early is a giant problem.
979.78s: And this is why I care about products that I trade, whether they're American or European style
987.14s: options because this difference can drastically impact my strategy drastically.
996.34s: Does that make sense? So we differentiate between American and European style options because
1002.98s: they incur different risk and they have different pricing components to them because of that risk.
1010.98s: And this is a great example as to how that risk can show itself. So now the other question,
1016.82s: actually, let me bring this back because I forgot. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on this one.
1022.50s: Why let me grab a different color? Why am I doing this here?
1029.30s: Why am I long 200 shares? And in this example, short just one call.
1042.98s: Why am I doing this?
1047.62s: Reese asks a great question. All options I've traded are American or futures European.
1053.30s: It depends. It depends because there are tons of products that you can trade options on that
1062.10s: are still European style. And same thing with futures, they actually have both, which I'll show you.
1070.10s: Reese is on it again and so is H. So Reese gets plus fake one internet point and so does H. In case he
1077.30s: has no Reese's smashing you guys right now, I think is that like plus four or plus five? I don't
1082.10s: know who's in second place. I don't really concern myself with second place. Whoever that is though,
1086.34s: I would get your shit together because Reese is smashing it. But that's exactly why.
1092.50s: Reese has five points exactly. So we got to be all going to have to step up. Who's in second place
1097.38s: right now? I need to be able to track at least the top two. So Reese has five. I don't know
1107.46s: who is in second. But this is exactly why. It's Elon songs. Okay. Liz, how many points do you have?
1117.62s: Jotato is now hurling insults, which I love to see saying that Reese is cheating, which is perfect.
1124.58s: That's exactly what we should do is if somebody is outperforming you, the first thing you should do
1130.42s: is definitely figure out what they're doing to cheat and then call them out on it. So I love that.
1135.62s: That's perfect.
1140.42s: BW says top answer is don't think too hard. Keep it simple. Get in and get out. That's a fantastic
1145.86s: way to get your face script off in trading. That's a tough way to go about the business. You
1151.06s: don't have to over complicate things. That's fair. And I agree with you. But this is why we have
1156.02s: that one trader. This misunderstanding right here is really, really important. It's not a
1162.50s: pedantic point. It's not like a fun bar fact. This is a completely different thing.
1169.62s: BW says I made 10K today on puts in 30 minutes. I'm stoked for you. I'm really stoked.
1175.62s: The problem is is like, again, $10,000 is a drop in the bucket and a lifetime of trading is different.
1183.06s: I've seen tons of people come and go in the business. And again, I'm stoked that you made money.
1188.18s: But flashing your 10 grand is if that's something special, it's not. It doesn't really matter.
1193.94s: So I would just focus on the right things.
1199.86s: So this differentiation, though, is why we had that instance before.
1207.70s: And if you look on, I forgot which sub it is. Let me see if I can find it.
1211.54s: I think it was a UVX UVX Y box spread. Let me see if I can find this trade.
1228.10s: Okay, so this is an article about it. I don't remember where it's from or anything. I know
1234.50s: it's from Reddit. I don't remember who it was. But this is why this right here is why you need
1239.62s: to know the difference between American and European options. Let's start with box spreads.
1245.06s: Box spreads are a big part of what I do because they increase the efficiency of just about all of
1251.94s: my strategies. Damn it. Where did the check go? Give me a second. I gotta find you guys. There you
1255.86s: are right there. So that's a video about box spreads. This is a video about a box spread trade log.
1263.46s: And I want to walk you through box spreads really quick. It's essentially a way to offer the
1271.22s: market a risk-free trade. It's genuinely risk-free. If you put on a box spread correctly,
1279.86s: and I'm going to walk you through exactly what this looks like. So
1286.98s: if we take a look at something that's European style option SPX,
1293.06s: like this, European style option. So again, European style option means what?
1301.06s: It means that there's no early exercise. Now this also happens to be cash settled. A lot of
1310.34s: European options are cash settled. Actually, I think the vast majority are. There might be some
1316.98s: really nuanced products that might be European but not cash settled, but I don't know many of them.
1323.30s: And none of them are striking me off the top of the head. I just don't want to leave you down the
1326.26s: right, the wrong path. I would think of them disparately, but you can generally assume
1330.98s: if something's European style, it's going to be cash settled. There might be, again, some small
1335.46s: nuances to that. So SPX, no early assignment, cash settled. If I want to buy a box spread,
1345.70s: this is a way for me to essentially loan the counter party of that trade money. I'm
1352.34s: loaning them money. And then I collect an interest on that trade. So for example, I have on right
1360.58s: now, actually, which is it expired today. And the box spread that I had on was, I'll show you the trade.
1368.82s: And it was, I put it on the 12th of August. So the trade went on about eight, well, not about
1380.26s: exactly 18 days ago. And it was for today. So let's go to the 12th of August.
1392.26s: And let's put on this trade so you can see exactly how it works. 12th of August,
1398.10s: whatever time entry we want to look at.
1406.66s: And so the trade went on for 12 August. I gotta wait for the calendar or I'm sorry, the 30,
1415.14s: 30th of August here, 18 days. So fun fact, the reason why I selected this expiration,
1423.46s: which is not my go-to expiration for box spreads, I want to be in the most liquid expiration cycles
1429.14s: typically. But I literally was parking money that I'm using for a real estate deal. So this is
1436.74s: literally like a live application of the strategy to earn some sort of yield. It's exactly why I
1443.54s: structured this position the way I did is because I had money that was going to go into a real estate
1447.94s: deal next week. And I didn't want to just sitting not doing anything. So I can put it in a box
1453.62s: spread. Again, in this case, you get to pick your expiration. So 18 days fit my time frame perfectly.
1460.42s: Now, the more common use case for this for me is when I'm trading things that require cash,
1468.66s: but I'm not using the cash up front. So for example, a cash secured put as part of the covered
1474.82s: stringle. If I sell a cash secured put, the broker doesn't automatically cash secure it.
1479.94s: I have to cash secure it in my own accounting. So instead of just having that money sitting,
1485.14s: they're doing nothing or just collecting whatever, Schwab puts it in a money market fund,
1489.94s: which is typically not a great yield. Even now it's not a great relative yield. I'll put it into
1494.82s: something like a box spread. So let's take a look at the trade on, so I went out to 30 August,
1501.06s: and I put on the 5,000, 6,000. Why the 5,000, 6,000? Because the wider I make the box spread,
1510.58s: the fewer I have to put on. That's what it comes down to. Now there's a slight nuance to this.
1518.74s: Because if you make it too wide, then it becomes really difficult to find the liquidity to put the
1525.38s: trade on. So this here is still a 10 delta. I'm not like super, super, super far out of the money.
1534.98s: So I go out to the, you know, this case, the 5,000 handle, and then I'll buy the in the money,
1543.22s: call, sell the out of the money, put, then I'll run all the way over here to the 6,000s and
1549.38s: essentially do the same on the inverse by these, sell these. So here's what's happening in this
1558.42s: scenario. I forgot the analyze trade thing doesn't work here. That's super annoying, but I'll still walk
1564.66s: you through it. Oh, there it goes. It's doing it. Ho, Ray. So, and I'll show you on the live one,
1572.90s: too, just so that you can see exactly how it looks like. But notice how this line is flat. This is
1578.02s: the PNL graph, right? So the Y axis is how much money I make. And then the X axis is different
1583.22s: prices in the underlying. Notice how this line is just horizontal above the PNL. It's a guaranteed
1588.90s: profit. Why is that? Because I'm buying something that's a thousand points wide. In this case, 5,000,
1596.82s: 6,000, thousand points wide. When I put on, let's just say it's a one lot. I put on a one lot.
1604.26s: In this scenario right here, it would go on for 99,723 dollars. But the width of the spread is worth
1613.70s: $100,000. So in this scenario, I put up, I didn't put up 990s. Oh, I did put up that's actually hilarious.
1623.06s: This is what I answered the trade-up was 997 on the nose. So in this case, I paid the market. I bought
1632.74s: this box spread for 99,700 dollars. At the end of the life cycle of the trade, I get the difference
1640.58s: between the width of the strike, which is a thousand points and what I paid. And again, I'll show you
1645.14s: that on a live, on a live version. I just want you to see what this looks like. So then as time passes,
1652.26s: you will make a little bit of that money each day until you get all the way to expiration.
1658.90s: So now if I get rid of on demand again so that you can see it more real time,
1664.18s: because it'll look a little bit differently. So kind of ignore this purple line because this is
1669.86s: looking at today, right? And obviously it's a little bit too late because you don't do a box
1675.46s: spread for the same day. So let's take a look at an example if I wanted to put one on for 20 DTE.
1683.62s: And then let's say I put on a similar structure where I run 5,000 here. And then 6,000 again,
1691.54s: we got a scroll for a minute. Here we go. Here's the 6,000s. We will buy these. We will sell these.
1700.58s: And then let's take a look at what this looks like. So you notice here, it's guaranteed profit.
1708.10s: This blue line shows you what it's worth at expiration. If I crunch this all the way down,
1713.14s: looking at all possible scenarios for SPX, it doesn't matter if SPX goes from current spot price,
1721.06s: literally down to 100. You still make that same amount of money. It's a risk-free trade.
1729.22s: Now in the case of the one I was showing you that I got into that 1,000 point widespread,
1734.26s: which again, I'm referring to my spreadsheet that again, you can grab one yourself.
1740.58s: It's easy to make, but I essentially can see what I'm earning over the current risk-free rate,
1746.34s: which I use the corresponding bond that's closest to what I'm comparing. So in this case,
1753.38s: the annualized return for the box spread that I put on was 6.1%. The corresponding yield for the
1763.30s: same time frame closest to was like 5%, like 5.3, 5. So I'm essentially making a pretty healthy margin
1774.74s: over the corresponding risk-free rate for the commensurate time frame. That's the cool part about
1780.66s: box spreads. Now, if taking this all the way back to the point of this offshoot about why this
1788.98s: matters to us is because if you put a box spread on, which should be risk-free, it should be a
1795.78s: risk-free loan to the market that you are collecting a yield that should be slightly better than
1800.18s: the market yield. If you do this kind of thing in something that has early exercise and is not
1809.86s: cash-settled, you have massive freaking risk. And that's exactly what happened to this person.
1817.22s: Here it is. Let me see if I can find that to a reddit post. That would be fun.
1828.02s: Yes, so this. So you can see essentially what happened to them.
1832.26s: They put on a box spread in UVXY because they were going to collect a whole bunch of money.
1836.58s: So you can see they put up $250,000 and essentially they were already up 9 grand.
1842.90s: Anytime that you look at the markets and you think something is too good to be true, it probably is,
1848.58s: you're not going to get a risk-free return like that. But this person didn't understand the
1854.50s: difference between American and European style options. So they put on a box spread, which again,
1859.38s: if it's in a European style cash-settled product and you structure it correctly, it's a risk-free
1865.30s: trade. It doesn't matter if it goes up, down, sideways, circles, you still will make the money if
1869.14s: you hold it to expiration. That is not the case for non-European style options or American style
1877.78s: options. That is not the case. You can get your head torn off because now you have early assignment
1883.14s: risk, which is massive.
1891.38s: Ari says, is this the guy who got box spreads banned from Robin? I don't know. That's a great question.
1895.78s: I'm completely uncertain. But this is exactly why we care about this. Hopefully that example
1905.94s: makes sense to you that sometimes these seemingly pedantic, annoying nuances actually matter more
1913.14s: than we think. So there's that. Okay, the third question is, I bought a call. The stock went up,
1922.02s: but I lost money. Why would I have lost money?
1926.98s: Ram Alama, thank you so much for the chat and the 10 bucks. That's going to go towards my dinner
1930.90s: tonight, much appreciated. I will grab your question in just a second.
1938.50s: So H says, so as long as it's European style, you're good to go then. As long as it's European
1954.82s: style, that's cash settled and you structure the trade correctly. Then yes.
1959.38s: BW says Theta could be. We have to be more specific than that. H is a better answer.
1969.22s: H says, volcrush slash reduction plus Theta. I like that answer the best.
1979.14s: James says, would MES be a good candidate for smaller accounts? Let's talk about MES in a second.
1983.78s: Give me, give me a minute to go through this one. If I skip past the James, just ask the question
1988.90s: again and I'll 100% get to it. You long songs also says Theta. Okay, so big A says or it didn't
1999.14s: reach the strike if out the money. That is actually incorrect. Big A's. So that last part of your
2004.90s: response is looking at the wrong thing. But one is expensive is fair.
2010.82s: Ram Alama says, option value drop due to Theta, Vega or both. Yep, there we go.
2018.34s: Okay, so let's talk about it. If we have an option, in this case, we bought a call and the
2029.06s: underlying goes up a set amount and we lose money. The two things that you highlighted are the
2036.02s: primary drivers. Why it wouldn't work out for you. The first one could be that you bought,
2042.98s: let me grab my notepad, standby. Gotta make sure I can draw this all out for you. I feel like
2051.62s: when I look at our ability to understand things, it's essentially predicated on my artwork.
2057.62s: Because otherwise, I don't know how we would arrive at these conclusions without these drawings.
2062.58s: It's kind of like quintessential. Okay, so we have a long call and the reason why I phrased that
2071.70s: question so loosely is because I wanted to see the way that you would take it and how precise
2077.70s: you would be. So in this case, the closest answer would be from H, but it's still not as precise as
2086.66s: I would want it to be. So the way that I would want to see you answer this question is the first
2094.34s: reason would be that your premium moved less than either or a combination of data
2112.26s: or Vega. Now, I know again, that sounds kind of pedantic. It kind of reminds me of my seventh grade
2125.70s: math teacher, Mr. Simon's. Remember this dude's name like like that comes right to the top of the
2130.98s: dome because when we were working on proofs, if you didn't answer the proof within a triangle,
2138.26s: if you didn't bother to write that, he would literally mark that part of the proof wrong.
2142.90s: And that seemed super annoying to me. That might be why I'm always so fascinated by the details
2148.98s: because maybe it was Mr. Simon's. He was a homie. He was one of the first dudes that got me to like
2153.78s: answering, um, to like answering math questions.
2161.94s: Reece says we're just trying to answer quickly to get those sweet, sweet points. Correct, but again,
2166.58s: if it's fast and wrong, then it's fast and wrong. But you're still, I think, gen, like
2173.38s: overwhelmingly in the lead. So you're still crushing it. But this one I would give the plus one fake
2178.10s: internet point again to H. I think he was the closest. The reason why I want the answer to be like
2186.90s: this and not just saying theta or Vega because people then innately start to think theta is out
2195.38s: to get them or that if they just hold an option, theta is going to kill them. And it's not the case.
2201.30s: It's simply that your theta needs to outpace your delta, which in this case would be how we're trying
2209.14s: to profit from this case, which is from the directional movement. So how can we identify if theta
2216.58s: is going to outpace our delta super simple? We can take a look again, we'll switch this back to
2222.34s: GME. And let's pick something that's like this. So let's say we have this out here.
2234.50s: These are all good. So in this case, we're all good. But anyways, in this case, if GME moves one point,
2243.14s: you get a nine cent move, but then you lose four cents in theta. Okay. So then what happens if a day
2257.14s: passes and GME moves half of a point, meaning 50 cents. Well, it means you get half of this delta.
2268.10s: So your option would appreciate in premium by four and a half cents. And you still would eat this
2276.02s: entire daily theta of four cents. So then this starts to get magnified the closer we are in time.
2284.74s: So for example, if we look at the options expiring next week, and we go out as far as we can, in this
2291.54s: case, it's the 45s that they offer the furthest out. If we go all the way out as far as we can go,
2298.58s: you're at a four delta. That means if game stop moves, one full point, one dollar in your
2305.78s: direction, in this case, up. If it moves that full point over the course of the day, you you're
2311.06s: going to see four cents in your premiums. However, you're out running five cents or five dollars of theta.
2325.06s: So this is how you can assess based on how much theta is bleeding out in a daily basis,
2332.10s: how much you need this thing to move based on how much time is left so that it doesn't eat your
2337.30s: entire lunch. That's the idea. So that's one way. The other way is through Vega, which is you absolutely
2347.70s: accurately identified. So when we're looking at Vega, we can see here we see Vega of 0.01. It's
2355.22s: generally insignificant. Vega is going to be highest for at the money options though. So you can
2362.74s: absolutely have an instance where the underlying on your short term option moves a point
2368.82s: and it's outpaced by your theta and or your Vega. But it's important to note that your delta still
2376.34s: will appreciate that portion of your options premium. If the underlying goes up, you've made
2382.82s: money from delta, but you've just lost more money from theta or Vega. That's the idea behind it.
2390.10s: Rika says, what good delta and theta do you look for when you buy? That's a fantastic question.
2397.86s: I have a video that walks through buying options specifically for these kinds of scenarios. I made
2404.18s: it originally for the apes so that we didn't go through a bunch of problems.
2410.02s: There. So you can check that video out. The main thing is that we, at least for me, I try to
2424.26s: strike a balance between delta. How much it's going to move if I get a move in my favor. And then
2430.02s: how much I'm paying in theta. That's really what it boils down to for me. But that video will walk
2435.46s: you through pretty far in detail. All right. So I'm going to go back up and grab Ram Alama's question
2442.34s: who said two weeks of DTE spy trading in the green and continuing to deepen knowledge and
2447.54s: strategies, which is sick. What is your philosophy on stop loss orders, dual edge blade? They've
2452.42s: both saved and cut profits. Yep. That's exactly it. So Ram Alama in that instance, the way that I would
2459.06s: look at whether or not it makes sense is if it works out in the aggregate. And I have an entire
2466.34s: playlist. I don't know if you've seen it on zero DTE options. Let me grab it zero zero zero zero.
2474.26s: One sec. Let me find it.
2477.78s: This playlist. Here you go. So that playlist there walks us through
2487.54s: different ways to think about that exact trade off. So the idea behind it for me at least
2497.14s: is I want to strike a balance between the probability of me getting stopped out
2505.62s: and the probability of me absorbing a really massive loss. So you'll see a few different
2514.02s: versions in there. And I actually have it on my to-do list to update based on what I'm seeing
2519.54s: this year because this year there's another change I've made to my zero DTE strategy where I'm not
2526.26s: waiting until the close anymore. Most days I'm using like a volatility adjusted metric where I'm
2536.42s: closing out the trade before the close at least by 10 minutes typically 15 plus.
2544.26s: I'm finding that is just reducing a ton of return volatility. And it's because I continue
2552.10s: I continue seeing days like this. And again, my goal is not to like think if I'm seeing it.
2558.90s: The goal is for me to quantify how much I'm seeing it. So I track the daily move of SPX
2565.14s: intra-day minute by minute high low. And I see how frequently do we get these big end of day moves.
2571.78s: And again, it doesn't have to be up. When I'm trading zero DTEs more often than not, I'm trading
2576.82s: short strangle short something like that typically short strangle. And so it doesn't matter if it
2581.78s: goes up or down. But if there's a big end of day move, I can get run over. So that's precisely why
2591.38s: in this case, I started noticing that if I close out a little bit earlier again, you can see that
2597.78s: this move started kicking off right at 1250, right? 10 minutes before the close. This is somebody
2602.66s: that's trying to position before liquidity gets fully sucked out. The other thing that I notice is
2610.82s: because I will use stops on my zero DTEs sometimes. And if you get stopped towards the market
2619.54s: close like in the last minute, you can get some of the most disgusting, egregious fills that you've
2626.10s: ever seen in your entire life. So I normally will exit before those periods. So that's why my
2634.10s: strategy's been evolving a bit. And I'm in again, my game plan is to do a video that walks through
2640.18s: some of these updates. But that's a great question. So yeah, let me know if that answers your question,
2647.78s: Mr. Ramalama. All right. Reese says, as somebody who doesn't day trade, what's the main appeal
2656.90s: is your DTEs? The main appeal of zero DTEs is actually really, really simple. It's the number
2663.70s: of occurrences. So you get to take advantage of a generally persistent thing called variance
2670.02s: risk premiums. Again, this is how I trade them. Let me take a step back. This is completely the way
2674.50s: I think about them. Other people might try to trade zero DTEs directionally and shit like that.
2679.06s: That's not what I do. When I'm trading zero DTEs, I'm trying to trade this persistence,
2684.26s: the persistence of variance risk premiums over realize volatility. So that's just where
2691.22s: implied volatility trends over historic volatility. And it's generally persistent. It's not always
2696.42s: there. Right. So in this case, you can see this actual this seven day variance risk premium,
2700.98s: this really short term variance risk premium is actually negative. It's not great.
2705.30s: But conversely, if we take a look at let me grab my flexible grid and let me do my monitoring
2712.02s: group, which this one here tracks daily. If I move this out and then let's do like five days,
2722.02s: five minutes, you'll see on these shorter term time frames, it's very, very often the case that
2730.18s: variance risk premium is going to be present. But it's a system that works out in the aggregate.
2734.90s: It's not like a really clean, smooth style system. It's very, very specific and it requires
2742.82s: essentially a regular exposure to it. So that's the reason why I like them. Now again, whether or not
2752.50s: they make sense or whatever, that's all completely dependent on the individual trader and what you're
2758.10s: trying to accomplish. But for me, they fit a really important part of my book, which is non correlated
2765.06s: returns. I see non correlated returns here. John says, if you are directional, how do you
2773.70s: determine longer short at the open? It's not what I do. So what you can do for something like
2779.62s: directional trading, again, for something like that, you one of the most common ways to trade
2784.66s: directionally interdays using something called an opening range breakout. That is a very, very
2789.94s: common day trading tool specifically for stock traders. And it genuinely is pretty high efficacy.
2797.70s: So I think in general, I kind of like that. But again, it's just different than what I do personally.
2807.30s: I realize I have to like rename these because they're all out of order, which bothers me. So the
2812.34s: sectors needs to get renamed. We'll save this as B.
2822.42s: Does that make sense?
2827.38s: James says it seems like spy has that v pattern meaning open and closer. Yeah. Well, because what
2834.42s: you're noticing is that in general, you're going to see liquidity at the beginning of the day when
2840.90s: overnight orders are clearing out. And then you're going to see liquidity at the end of the day.
2845.22s: Again, when orders are clearing out. So that's that's like precisely why you see that. So I think
2854.58s: I would look at that. And for me, it's part of the reason why I trade when I do.
2862.02s: Brad says, how does IV crush work or changes in IV and what causes it? Fantastic question. I love
2867.70s: this. Importantly, if I buy an option for a few weeks out in low price, how can this affect me?
2873.70s: How can you manage the headwind at all? It's a fantastic question. So the way to think about implied
2879.86s: volatility is that it's obviously non static and it's going to be relative to specific timeframes.
2888.10s: So the first thing we have to identify is, for example, notice how I have progressive up. We can
2894.90s: look at whatever, but this just happens to be progressive. Notice how for the 20 September
2899.14s: expiration, the volatility is 22.93. Then for the next expiration, 18 on it's 26.15. Then for 15
2906.90s: noves, 25.13, so on and so forth. What I'm highlighting to you is that there are different
2911.30s: volatilities for different explorations. So over the life of an option, as volatility moves and
2919.46s: the primary drivers of volatility moving, it's implied. It's forward looking. So it's in act,
2926.50s: it signifies a change in the expected forward movement of an underlying. That's really what it means.
2935.30s: So if implied volatility expands, it means the market thinks for whatever reason that over that
2942.26s: reference time frame, again, whether it's 21 days, 49 days, 77 days depending on the time frame,
2947.94s: normally when we're quoting implied volatility, it's for 30 days. So when we see
2954.58s: like this quoted IV, it's 30 days and then we annualize it.
2959.86s: So, but it can be for other periods. I just want you to be aware of that. So generally speaking
2966.50s: over the next, if we're just quoting the IV for the underlying itself, that's normally going to be
2970.82s: 30 day vol. And if it goes up, it just means we expect the underlying to move more over the next
2979.14s: 30 day period for what reasons completely dependent on the stock. So sometimes it'll be that there's
2986.74s: new news that's come out and we think for whatever reason that the stock is now going to be more mobile.
2993.30s: So a great example of this is if I grab Starbucks and we take a look at when it added
3001.62s: it's the new CEO, we started seeing short term implied volatility, which is kind of like this
3008.26s: straw colored lighter yellow was coming up. It was moving up and then it started coming back down.
3014.66s: And then if we look at CMG, we can see that both period vols started moving up. This is one
3022.98s: they replaced the CEO. They took from CMG over to Starbucks. So this is the market's perception of
3031.14s: volatility changing. So this is how your options valuable change due to volatility. Now, really common
3038.34s: periods that vol will expand is starting two weeks out from an earnings release. That's the first
3045.86s: period where you will see. Vol starting to expand. And again, the reason for that is because over
3054.50s: that release, we tend to expect volatility to increase because we're coming into what we would
3062.42s: call a binary event. We don't fully know what's going to happen. We're not sure. So then we're
3068.26s: essentially positioning ourselves for the unknown. That's precisely why you'll see that happen.
3075.14s: So then once we go through that perceived volatile event again for whatever it was, then there
3082.90s: will come a point where we know what happens, right? We're at the point where we get through the
3088.50s: volatility event. We understand what happens because whatever happened happened, we can observe it.
3094.50s: Then volatility typically will contract because again, we now know what happened. So that's why
3103.46s: you'll see volatility move in a nutshell. It's literally just the perception of forward price
3112.02s: deviation. That's all. So Brad, let me know if that answers your question. It was a really,
3121.46s: really good question. Reese says, just to clarify, I had to pay above intrinsic value to close a short
3128.58s: call that expired today. Is that where your DTE traders make money or is that market maker
3133.54s: thing? You'd have to explain the trade to me because yeah, I don't fully follow what happened there.
3141.54s: John says expected to move which way? We don't know. That's one of the notes is when we're looking
3149.78s: at implied volatility, it's not necessarily direction specific. It's a comb, right? So if I take
3154.90s: a look at CMG and I look at a probability analysis, this comb is projected using the implied
3162.82s: volatility in this case, 32.86%. But you'll notice that it's deviation off of the spot price up or down.
3171.46s: Can go up that amount. Can go down that amount. And again, this is just within a one standard deviation
3175.86s: move. If I open this up to a three standard deviation move, you'll notice that these numbers move
3180.42s: much, much, much further out because it needs to encompass a much wider range. If we're going to
3184.58s: hit it within a three standard deviation, confidence interval. So that's that.
3194.98s: Doctors, they said so a strangle could be a good strategy for earnings betting on price
3199.46s: movement without having to pick a side. If you're talking about the expansion of volatility,
3206.02s: I prefer straddles, but a strangle can work just fine. And if you're talking about the contraction
3211.54s: for earnings, I tend to use either strangles or straddles on the short side.
3216.74s: So this Dr. Zeyes, this is specifically for you. The link I just dropped in there is a video
3222.98s: about trading earnings with options for this this literal exact purpose. Because trading earnings
3230.58s: with options is one of the few sources of what we would call structural alpha, which is a really,
3238.74s: really important concept for when we're looking at the performance of a system.
3245.46s: If it has some sort of persistent edge, which that absolutely does. So yeah, that video will go
3253.78s: into detail. Wiggly warm, what up? Good to see you. All right, let me see. I just want to get caught
3261.38s: up on the chat. Okay, it looks like I'm all good. Carlos says, how does this guy always drop
3270.02s: these links so fast? Oh, you have a question here's like, yeah, it's because I spent a lot of time
3275.14s: like building a series of, I call them reference videos. The funny part about my reference videos
3281.70s: is that they do terribly. They really perform very, very bad in terms of like video performance
3287.94s: for YouTube. But I genuinely think that they're typically really good information. So I make
3292.90s: them anyways. A quick admin note, I need to go grab some Advil before my hernated disc blows out.
3299.22s: I'll be back in like 30 seconds.
3317.94s: All right, how did I do one time? I feel like, I feel like that was pretty quick. I think it was
3341.78s: less than 30 seconds. My, yeah, my bathroom, like the master bathroom is not far away from the
3348.66s: office. So in this case, we're going to go with some Advil twos, which is a mix of ibuprofen and
3354.02s: a set of metafine. And yeah, these are now part of my daily routine. It's super fun. Highly recommend it.
3360.18s: Kidding, don't, don't recommend it at all. I'd never take this kind of stuff. But it is what it is.
3365.46s: Gotta get through the injury. So here we go. Biggie says 24 seconds. I feel like that was pretty good.
3378.74s: He says I could hear your back wrinkle with every step. That's probably my ankle actually.
3383.22s: My, my back doesn't hurt at all. But it's just all the sciatical bullshit. Now, funny enough,
3389.46s: though, my ankle does crack all the time. And that doesn't hurt either. I don't get it.
3395.62s: All right. Enough about me because nobody cares.
3400.42s: Let's look at a couple other things. So first thing, we already talked about this one. Let me pull that
3405.94s: down. And BW says I care you to man. Thank you, BW. Jotato says, Rogan says, do decompression for
3414.58s: back paint. Yeah. So funny enough, I actually bought an inversion. I don't know if it's called an
3420.02s: inversion chair table. I guess maybe a table. It's literally my office right here. So I've been
3424.26s: hopping on there to help it out. I just essentially just takes time.
3428.98s: Perneated discs, I believe. Well, again, this is like the longest injury I've ever had.
3434.18s: It typically does not take this long for me to heal. So that's just how she goes.
3440.58s: All right. So the other thing I want to show you, though, are a couple posts
3448.26s: for us to work through.
3449.86s: From Reddit, I'll grab these in a second. It looks like there's a question here.
3457.38s: Wigglyworm says, when first upside down stream, I 100% would do it. I don't know how to stream
3464.02s: from my phone. I've never done it before. I've always done it from like the computer like this,
3467.38s: but I think that would be hilarious. I also used to do a bunch of series called car chats. I
3472.90s: really, really enjoyed those where I would go drive around whether it's in like, well, it used
3477.46s: to be the Corvette before I turned it into the monster that it is. It's just way too loud now.
3481.78s: The running joke is the reason why I bought them a clarin is because the Corvette just got too
3485.54s: loud to do car chats in. That's the joke. But I can always do like the car chats. I think a
3491.14s: live stream during that would be impossible because obviously the whole reason why I like to do
3496.34s: live streams is to monitor the chat and interact with you. Well, it's super, super engaging
3500.26s: from it. It's very fun. That's why normally if the chat is like busy and vibrant, I'll sit here
3505.70s: for two hours happily. If it's quieter, I'll normally wrap up a little bit faster. It's just because
3512.34s: I kind of vibe off of you guys. So the upside down thing I think would be hilarious at some point.
3521.62s: But yeah, probably wouldn't be able to last too long unfortunately. I'm trying to put on this
3528.74s: fucking thing. There it goes. Like this 10s unit.
3537.70s: James says take BPC 157 for your back. If I was going to take anything for it, honestly,
3542.82s: I would do either. I wouldn't take BPC 157. It's kind of less good. I would either just go with
3555.86s: stem cells. If I was going to do it, or I would do a steroid injection. Those would be kind of like
3570.50s: the two choices that I would make. But I wouldn't bother with BPC 157. BPC 157 is cool, but it really does
3578.10s: pale in comparison to something like stem cells. But I'm trying to just go the natural route and keep
3584.02s: it as minimally invasive as humanly possible for the time being is the idea.
3592.66s: H says take Fent for your back. I actually guess if I went back up to Vancouver for another podcast,
3598.74s: I could grab some of that because yeah, it's that seems to be pretty much around everywhere.
3607.62s: Suppose Carson's tumor totally safe. Yeah, I actually take a bunch of supplements every day.
3612.18s: From the physical side, I'm fascinated with human performance. I'm not like any sort of crazy
3617.38s: good athlete, but I've been athletic my whole life. I still am now, even though I'm broken. I'm still
3622.90s: going to the gym and stuff, but I still train martial arts and all that kind of stuff. Anyways,
3626.58s: I tinker with supplements. I tinker with recovery methods when we actually build our house. That's
3631.54s: one of the goals. I still think we're looking at Colorado. When I build my house there, I literally
3638.82s: have plans for like an entire recovery room because we have like the cold plunge here, the hot tub.
3644.34s: I want to get a barrel song. I like all this kind of shit. I really am fascinated by human
3648.58s: performance. So yeah, that's the that's the idea. All right. Let me go back up to Brad had a question.
3662.34s: Okay, I see your question. Okay, and I see Alfonso. All right, let me grab Alfonso question
3670.02s: quick. Alfonso says I saw very interesting earnings play this week two days before earnings.
3676.18s: Someone sold 11,700 far out of the money puts and bought 11,700 calls after earnings stock
3685.30s: increased 40% smells fishy. Yeah, I agree with you. I do. I completely agree with you. Alfonso
3692.18s: what was the ticker that that was in we can take a look at it. That to me sounds like insider
3696.34s: trading if I'm if I'm being honest. And the cool part about the cool part about options is that
3705.86s: it's kind of like the go to for insider trading because it's leveraged. So they make more money.
3711.78s: So they're taking the risk of trading on insider information. Why would they not go to options and
3715.94s: gain the leverage? It's just logical. So you can use that's why we track unusual options activity
3722.90s: because informed traders use derivatives because they're leveraged. It literally just makes sense.
3732.82s: So my guess is that's exactly what you're seeing. And in case you're wondering what we're doing
3736.74s: for beverages, we still got the mango orange. I just got a giant refill of them. So I'm treating
3742.90s: myself and we're doubling it up. That's what we got for the spin drips. These are so good.
3751.06s: Big big fan. So yeah,
3756.18s: AFRM. My guess is that's probably a smaller stock too, right?
3761.78s: Yeah, it is. What's the market cap on this?
3765.14s: Yes, so this is a generally small. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is what you saw is literally quintessential
3774.26s: of insider trading. Let's take a look. Let's go in here and then look at AFRM.
3784.82s: And then
3789.14s: when was its earnings? On the 28th?
3794.42s: Let's do like 26 to the 27th.
3805.06s: So these are people that these guys sold calls. Let me look.
3810.98s: So on the call side, you said you saw
3815.62s: 1700. Yeah, so these.
3819.14s: See, this is interesting though, because this is kind of like a bit of a shotgun to be completely
3825.62s: honest with you like these ones, because I see a bunch of calls coming in at the bid. And then
3830.34s: I also see them coming in at the offer. So that's generally a mixed bag.
3836.34s: Brad says that AFRM trade out actually based on TA said big move coming. I must play it.
3842.98s: Yeah. Well, I mean, from a TA perspective,
3848.34s: it, I mean, this kind of upward momentum budding up against this kind of resistance.
3854.26s: That's not necessarily going to lead to a big move. What led to a big move was good earnings
3859.38s: after the market. If it didn't have good earnings, this thing wouldn't have done this.
3864.26s: So I would just attribute the the movement is accurately as we can. And it's not because of like
3870.90s: some prior setup necessarily in terms of like the chart. It's because of this event. It's
3876.10s: because it had a good earnings. So it was estimated that negative 44 eight cents in a came in at
3882.18s: negative 14. So it's a massive, massive, massive earnings beat. So yeah, I would use for me,
3890.82s: I would use options positioning as kind of like the guiding force. Let me see if we can look at them.
3895.38s: I don't know if this will let us go back. This early, oh, it does. That's great. So we can go back
3901.78s: to the 27th because it was after the close on the 27th. I think, is that right? I think so.
3909.38s: And let's see what the options look like. I'll fast forward this to like
3915.06s: 0.9 something like that. Get a little later in the day.
3920.98s: And let's take a look at the options.
3923.38s: Because yeah, I mean, obviously I'm a proponent of technical analysis. I believe a lot in it.
3934.66s: But I also think it's really, really important to try and identify price behavior and attribute it
3942.02s: to the actual things that are moving price. So in this case, it was earnings. It was a binary
3950.58s: event that easily can go either way. So we know that that's not right. So it did head call skew,
3960.26s: which makes a lot of sense. So let's take a look in the front expiration. Yeah, I mean, it had
3965.86s: moderate call skew, 38,000 against 20,000, almost two to one. So that's a lot of people playing the
3972.90s: upside. And then if we take a look on the 27th, let me see. And doctors, they is kind of
3986.10s: interesting that a company composed the negative EPS. But if it's a beat, then the price goes up
3990.26s: anyway. I think I'm going to make a video actually. This is such a great point. Let me,
3995.62s: I'm literally going to outline a thing. I'm going to, I'm going to make a video called like
4000.34s: how to interpret earnings or how to trade earnings as an options trader or some shit like that.
4005.94s: I'll obviously have to award Smith a little bit and become super hyperbolic. Maybe the name of the
4010.90s: video needs to be something like how to make $10,000,000 daily on a $5,000 account trading options
4018.18s: in earnings. Maybe that's the, maybe that's the right path. But I'm going to leave myself a
4023.22s: reminder here. And it will be like how to interpret or maybe how to trade earnings
4035.46s: with options, something like that. I just got to leave this as like a placeholder.
4043.38s: And then obviously I have to work on the hyperbally, you know, how to trade earnings with options
4048.74s: and make $60 trillion with no money down and no effort. Maybe that's a good one.
4056.82s: But anyways, let's take a look at these transactions. The first thing I want to do is I want to see
4062.18s: people that are buying just calls. Yeah, like that. Somebody buying the 35s. And then let's see
4071.94s: people that are selling puts. Pretty small. So there's not this insane call skew coming through.
4082.18s: There's definitely heavy calls for sure, but it's not necessarily insane. But in this front
4088.18s: expiration, it's almost 2 to 1, which again, like when you see these kinds of trades or this kind
4092.18s: of setup pre earnings, to me, that typically indicates a fairly bullish configuration. And it's
4098.50s: especially in these smaller companies. It's very, very common due to insiders knowing something's
4104.02s: coming. H says how to make $50 a day in your boxers trading earnings. There we go. That right there
4112.34s: apparently is the title I needed. So I think that's the, I think that's the right right move.
4122.18s: Reece says, been tinkering, but haven't figured out how to have volume displayed horizontal
4126.90s: in the chart. That's just volume profile. Dr. Zayas, you have to capitalize certain words.
4134.10s: Oh, I was just going to capitalize all of them. Maybe like make it seem like I'm screaming or
4138.58s: something like that. Oh, I see. You got to make it slightly believable. My bad. I'm going to have
4143.94s: to hire all of you as kind of my content consultants so that we can actually grow the channel instead of,
4151.78s: you know, me just making videos that drop into the ether. Love chatting with you guys. But, you know,
4156.82s: also trying to grow this fucking thing, which is it was actually funny. I was talking with my best
4163.54s: friend Joe. He was on the channel a while in the beginning. Like he and I would do like conversations
4168.74s: together. But he was just like, how's it? You know, he always asked me about the channel and stuff.
4172.42s: And I was told I'm like, it's growing, but it's growing slow. And he always tells me he's just like,
4175.62s: that's the problem with principles. And he's not wrong. Like there is, it was so easy to, to like,
4184.66s: really grow this thing, I think, if I didn't have principles, but I do have principles,
4189.46s: unfortunately, I suppose. Oh.
4197.86s: All right. Carlos says you just have to put Jimmy and video in all your titles. Yeah.
4203.94s: I try to, I try to be specific with what I'm doing on the titles and stuff. I typically make
4209.86s: content the way that I would want to consume it, which is again, not great from a growth perspective.
4215.06s: But all right. So let's take a look at this. What do you guys think about this? Do I lose money
4224.10s: rolling my options? How does this work? What do you guys think about that?
4234.02s: Michael says I'm here because you have principles. Honestly, that's exactly right to be clear.
4239.86s: I find that the audience that tends to find their way into my content or the like, you guys are
4244.42s: my people, right? Like you're the exact kind of people I want to be around. I don't like being around
4248.90s: the people that that other content tends to bring. So I joke about it because it's like playing
4253.22s: the game on hard mode. But again, I maintain the principles because I wouldn't, I wouldn't change it.
4263.86s: Ben says, so whether you lose money or not is not the framing of the transactions. Yep.
4270.26s: Yep. So this,
4275.86s: Jotatus had probably a fee for rolling options there is, but that's not why they lose money.
4279.46s: It's a good quiet or it's a good guess, but that's not exactly why.
4285.62s: Reese says if you pay more to close to receive, it's a loss. If you then open a new option contract,
4292.02s: that's exactly it. That's exactly correct.
4297.22s: So Reese gets another plus fake one internet point.
4304.98s: A big A says, is it a trick question? No, it's not a trick question.
4310.26s: The simple answer is absolutely. So here's a video called a Comprehensive Guide to Rolling
4318.98s: Options. Here's a video is Rolling Options Masterclass. And here's a video
4328.90s: Rolling Options explained and why most people get it wrong. That last one goes into detail on the
4335.14s: math, which we will gloss over quickly here. And as you can see, I did make a comment here.
4341.94s: This person said a loss only if rolled for a debit.
4347.06s: Rolling for a net credit can increase the possible profit and lower the max loss. This is not wrong.
4353.86s: This is wrong. This is unequivocally wrong. It's not in opinion. It's not, it is 100% wrong.
4363.46s: And you can see my response here. So the response I gave to this person, I just found one of them,
4369.94s: and I responded. I say this is objectively wrong. And likely due to a common trait of traders,
4376.10s: which is known as loss aversion. It's where we hate losing so much that we play all these
4383.46s: different mental gymnastics to avoid reconciling that we've taken a loss. That's what loss a
4391.30s: version is. We do not like taking losing traits. Now a quick dovetail off of loss aversion is the
4398.74s: sooner as a trader, you can get over the fact of being wrong. You are unlocked. It's like
4406.10s: unshackling yourself because we as people tend to assign our self worth our effort directly to
4417.78s: the outcome of an individual thing. And we forget that specifically something like trading
4424.66s: is a process driven thing. So the outcome of any one individual thing does not really fucking
4431.94s: matter. What matters is the long term outcome. So that means today I got stopped out on my zero DTEs.
4441.62s: I got I got kicked out for a loss. So does that mean I'm not going to trade zero DTEs? No, of course
4448.90s: I am. I traded them yesterday. I'm going to trade them on Monday. Do I feel like a piece of
4453.70s: shatter that all my research was wasted? Absolutely not. It's because I know losing is part of trading.
4462.50s: And as soon as you break that thing in your mind, you decouple those where every trade is this
4469.06s: emotional loss. Damn, y'all. I didn't realize that you guys are going to have to do me dirty like
4475.14s: that. I was sitting here hoping about, did you not hear that monologue I was on? I was crushing it
4480.26s: I feel like. And then you guys just have to drop me over the head with the fucking market being
4484.98s: closed Monday. Y'all just did me so dirty. Damn it. Well, I guess I'm not trading Monday. This is
4495.06s: horseshit. But yeah, the broader point is I don't associate the outcome like the outcome of each
4503.62s: individual trade with my identity. And I think the sooner you can overcome that as a trader,
4513.06s: the better off you're going to be. So this person here, I can guarantee you has lost a version.
4520.02s: I can guarantee it by this answer. Because the only reason why you would answer this way is if you
4529.30s: have a problem with losing trades and don't want to acknowledge that there's a losing trade. Why?
4535.86s: Because this is what a role is. A role is when we open a trade. We then close the trade.
4544.90s: We open another trade and tie the accounting together. That new trade doesn't undo
4554.50s: whatever the PNL was in that first trade. And I'll use an example right now to walk you through
4563.06s: what this looks like. Again, we'll get the handy dandy notebook. Maybe I'll just leave this open
4566.82s: instead of continuing to close it. I thought we were done with the notebook, but apparently not.
4572.18s: So first though, before I go further into this, does that make sense? Like the concept I just laid
4576.90s: out in terms of what a role is and why that position is just objectively false?
4586.34s: Let me grab this. James says that's right. You lose, but it's hidden. That's the funny part,
4592.18s: though. It's not hidden. It's literally right in your face. It's just that we don't like
4598.50s: acknowledging it. Actually, even better scenario. Never mind. Change my mind entirely. I'm not going
4605.38s: to use this. What I'm going to do is use on demand and we'll work through an example together.
4614.26s: So let's find something that we know will lose. So let's find something. This would be great.
4622.26s: This has gone down. How are the options in here? Does it have okay options? Yeah, this is fine.
4628.02s: We'll literally use this. So what we're going to do is sell a put on the 15th.
4635.70s: And then we're going to fast forward to the first 15th to the first. That's fine.
4645.22s: So we're going to come here on the 15th.
4650.18s: And we're going to sell a put.
4653.30s: Alfonso says grandma was divorced five times. And when she was about to marry the six guys,
4658.02s: she says, I'm going to keep trying to like get it right. Sounds like rolling. Yeah, honestly,
4661.94s: your grandma was rolling her husbands. I think that that's a completely legitimate way
4669.70s: to think about it. Actually, and what I'll do is instead of this, let me grab a calculator
4675.30s: that I like to use. It's going to break. But I think we'll be able to
4684.10s: work it. All right. So I have a calculator over in an Excel sheet off to the side just to try to
4694.50s: make this a little easier to follow along. I'm clearing out some old stuff from it. And then I'll
4699.94s: pull part of it over for you to see. Okay. So the date for today technically is 15 July 24 in
4709.38s: this alternate universe. And then we're going to sell a put. We're going to sell a put for 16
4714.82s: aug. So we'll go to 16 aug, which gives us 32 DTE. The stock price at this point is 3167.
4725.94s: And we're just going to do a one lot. And let's sell this at the money 30. So the strike price here
4733.38s: is going to be 30. And then the premium that we're going to get is $1.53.
4740.18s: Are we Gucci so far on the scenario? And again,
4749.30s: four oh no, this is all shifted. This is terrible. I guess that's okay.
4762.42s: Yeah, I guess this is all right.
4764.26s: Okay. This is makes sense so far though, like what we've done up into this.
4774.50s: Essentially, here is, let me zoom this in. Okay, Reese is following me. Good. I needed some
4783.22s: confirmation to make sure that this isn't like all just ether stuff to you. So here's what we have
4789.86s: so far. Essentially, we have, it's not AMD. It's AFRM. It's whatever. It doesn't matter.
4800.34s: So in this case, we sold this option. So in this case, our net credit, here's the $1.53.
4806.18s: Return on invested capital is 5.1%. In order to cash secure this position, we need three Gs.
4812.26s: Based expiration 32 PNL is 153 bucks. Sick. So then let me launch this off. Let's see if the
4823.94s: platform will take it. Boom, we got a fill. Great. Great news. Great news for all of us. There's our
4830.26s: trade. Great. Cool. So now let's fast forward. And I said that we go to the first of August.
4836.50s: Now again, this is the cool part about using something like on demand is because I can go back
4841.62s: in time. I can identify a period that I'm interested in testing something. And I can cherry pick,
4847.06s: which is exactly what we did. We cherry picked a period that we know AFRM is going to go down so
4851.94s: that we can analyze this psychology of rolling and why so many people just completely,
4860.18s: completely dork it up because we're uncomfortable with losing trades. It's literally one of the
4865.30s: worst possible things you can come across as a trader are traders that have a problem with losing
4871.38s: trades. It's so egotistical. All right. Big A says, can you close the news and make the options
4881.70s: bigger? I can't because it's not going to zoom in on this. I don't know how to the only thing I
4889.94s: could do is shrink the part of the screen. But then I would have to change it every time that I'm
4898.42s: in here. So I'll just read it to you. Although as I can't zoom it in enough, I don't think.
4906.26s: Yeah, because that doesn't when I do that, it doesn't zoom it in. This doesn't help us.
4912.90s: So anyways, now my options are trading for $3.45. So let's talk about this role. Let's say that
4923.54s: I'm going to choose to roll here. Well, by coming here, I'm going to pay negative $3.45.
4932.66s: So what? What has just happened? The very first part of this role is this. I had this open trade
4942.82s: that I collected $153. I then closed this open trade for $3.45.
4951.54s: I now realized a loss of $345. So my aggregate realized loss here, which you can see, is $192.
4966.50s: This is a realized trade that was open. It is now closed. This trade is done.
4976.10s: Now, the next part of a role is we look at, let's say we wanted a roll out here.
4984.26s: And you can't even get out of the money. Let's just pretend that we could roll this out
4990.98s: the 50 days from 15, go to 50. And let's just pretend that I was able to get $3.50.
5000.98s: I'm just pretending here. It's not the scenario, but let's just pretend.
5004.98s: Then now, let's say the date is 1.ogg24. We're going to look at an expiration that's 27.
5014.02s: The stock price now is at 27.03. I'm still going to use this one lot.
5020.66s: My strike, again, in this hypothetical scenario that isn't true, I was able to move from a 30 to
5027.22s: a 25, meaning I improved my basis by 16 points. And now, let's say that I was able to collect a
5033.70s: credit of $3.50. Here is the new trade. This new trade gives me the ability and the opportunity
5048.82s: to make enough money in order to overwhelm the loss of this trade. But it does not change the fact
5060.58s: that the first step in this process of a role is realizing a losing trade. And again,
5069.06s: there's nothing wrong with realizing the losing trade. It's okay. What's not okay is playing
5076.26s: mental gymnastics because you don't want to acknowledge losing a trade. That's dangerous.
5083.46s: That does not help you in trading. So for this person's response, do I lose money rolling options?
5090.42s: It depends. It's not a guaranteed yes. That's another really common misconception. And this is
5096.58s: the part that we need to hone in on that. The reason why it depends is because
5103.30s: James says, but you are still in the money. So you're already losing that trade too. Not necessarily.
5109.38s: You can't look at it that way. And I'll explain to you why. Just because you're in the money,
5114.34s: doesn't mean that the trade is losing. And I'll explain why in a second. The previous point I was
5120.42s: making though is that if you close a trade that's winning, well, then you realize again.
5127.06s: You've made money. So for example, if we modify this example here,
5136.98s: and if we modify this example instead of us closing at 345, let's just pretend that we closed it
5142.74s: at a dollar. You've realized a profit, right? So you can realize a profit when you roll a trade.
5150.26s: Now to James, to your point about being still in the money and already losing on the trade,
5154.66s: that's not what I would focus on for two reasons. Oh, see if you keep up with it.
5160.58s: One of the reasons is because do you see this calculation here called adjusted net credit? That's
5166.50s: what a DJ means adjusted and CNET credit. So these calculations important. The reason why
5176.66s: this calculation is important is because it tells me what value I need the option to be
5183.22s: in order to hit break even. So for example, I needed to hit 158. I just do the math.
5189.46s: So here, if I close this at $1.58, oops, messed that up. My bad. Minus $1.58. You'll see
5199.70s: that it zeros me out. That the aggregate P and L at this point is now at break even. So I just
5206.74s: calculate whatever the adjusted net credit is. So now James, back to your point. If I sell
5213.70s: this option, whether it's in the money or out of the money, doesn't inherently matter up front,
5218.90s: as long as eventually it hits my adjusted net credit, at which point I would be at a break even.
5225.14s: So I wouldn't attach it to the moneyness is the broader point there. I would attach it simply
5231.22s: to the value of the option and what you need the value of the option to hit in order for it to be
5237.30s: a viable trade. Let me know if that makes sense. Alfonso says, how many times did Gil roll GME call
5244.50s: options between June 2019 and April 2021 not always a loss? Yeah, and that's the thing is I don't
5250.18s: even I'm not sure that he was selling calls against his shit. Like I have no idea what he was doing
5254.82s: because I have no record of that. When I'm looking at somebody like the cat,
5260.18s: the best thing I can do is review what he's posted on Reddit on his page and come up with the best
5269.38s: estimations I can for his style of trading. But damn it. I have this little cable keeper that's
5277.46s: dropping cables all over the place. One second.
5289.78s: I need my cable keeper to keep it together. So yeah, I just I don't know what he did over those
5298.98s: periods. So I can't I have no idea the answer to that one. Rude a bag of what up gets us you.
5304.90s: All right. So that's one example. Let's take a look as another example.
5311.86s: Here. I haven't read this yet. So we'll read it together. Wigglyworm says, is it accurate to say
5321.14s: rolling is a method of extending a single trade into a series of trades and adjusting your break
5325.14s: even point? Yeah, I think it's fair. That's okay. That's no problem. James says it does. But if you
5332.10s: were rolling, it's likely already close to break even if it goes in favor. Yes, not necessarily
5338.90s: close to break even. Again, I wouldn't attach that to it either personally. I think it's partially
5343.86s: accurate, but it's not inherently accurate. Again, I would just try to keep it on more
5353.30s: more representative basis, which means kind of reflecting exactly what it is. Because if you're
5358.18s: rolling, it doesn't inherently mean you're close to break even away from break even. It could be
5362.50s: any of them. There's no inherent relationship with a role in break even. It's completely
5367.62s: situation dependent. So I would just let it be situation dependent. I wouldn't try to come up with
5371.78s: like a rule of thumb for it. Let's take a look at this person. Again, I haven't read this yet.
5377.22s: It says, I'm day trading spy and previously thought creating a stop loss at 30% of my trade was
5382.10s: a sensible risk. However, I'm often removing my stop loss with the conviction of being directly
5387.94s: correct and exposing myself. Often I'm correct, but when I'm not, my account is long. Do I need to
5392.98s: give my trades extra breathing room 40% usually my trades are correct roughly 80% of the time and my
5398.58s: upside is often 40% or more. What do you guys think of this? How would we? How would we think?
5417.30s: What strategy? That's a great starting question. We don't know. We just know some of the metrics of
5422.26s: their strategy, but we don't know what it is. It doesn't say the strategy, I guess, is the
5428.98s: is the annoying part. There's nothing to read. Reese says need the win rate and average win and
5434.90s: loss. You're going down the right path here. This is the exact right path.
5442.10s: Build on that a little bit more, Reese.
5444.02s: Expectancy. Yeah, that's exactly it. So,
5461.46s: I have a video that video is called maximize gain risk management for options trading.
5466.74s: And the whole point of that is to walk you through the way I think about sizing risk
5474.90s: and trades and managing risk and trades. Because here's the deal. Whether or not this stop makes sense
5483.54s: completely depends on what they're telling us. And what I can tell you is they're not
5490.74s: they're not telling us something. Because if they're right 80% of the time with an average upside of
5498.34s: a 40% return or more. And that obviously means that they're only losing 20% of the trades, right?
5505.86s: You can inference through it. So then the required loss on those trades would be
5512.18s: absolutely massive in order for this to happen. So then to me, if they're telling me I'm winning 80%
5519.94s: of the time. And then, you know, we're essentially adjusting off of this. To me, the solution here's
5526.66s: really simple. I would focus on this thing. I like to call cutting the tails. And the reason why
5533.46s: I think about cutting the tails is because it's a simple way for this person to strike a balance.
5539.70s: Let me see if I have a video on this. I don't remember the see normal error. Remember the names
5548.02s: or at least like associated keywords with the videos, which is how I'm able to look them up so fast.
5556.58s: But sometimes I'm not. It might be this one.
5565.78s: Yeah, I think it's that one. Oh no, it's this one. That's a lie. I found it. Here we go.
5573.86s: So that's the video. Let me see. I need to change this title so I can find it.
5588.66s: So I just literally changed the title of that video so I can find it faster next time for us.
5593.06s: But that video, it's about cutting the tails. That's what I would do here. So the way I would think
5598.50s: about this, if I were this trader is that I wouldn't inherently know if I need to give them more
5603.06s: breathing room, because if I'm telling myself that if I give myself a 40% potential drawdown,
5609.14s: and I maintain an 80% win rate, that's 40% or more, right? Just do the math. If the loss,
5616.98s: the stop loss is as large as your average win, but you're winning 80% of the time. That's a
5624.34s: positively expected strategy. So this is totally cool. This I think is terrible advice.
5631.54s: I think don't use the stop is again, silly, because then what's the exit at some point?
5639.46s: Like we need to define an exit whether they want to use the stop or arresting stop mental stop,
5643.62s: whatever, it doesn't matter. But we do need to have some idea of what we're going to exit the trade.
5647.86s: So I actually don't agree with this at all. So yeah, anyways, I thought that this was
5654.34s: another interesting case study. I have a couple more. If we want to run through those,
5658.42s: unless if you have any specific questions, now is the perfect time to start throwing those in and
5662.82s: we'll take a look. Ricky says, I would think that if he's profitable and outperforming spy,
5667.30s: then just keep doing what you're doing. Yeah, I think that that's a really fair, fair way to think
5671.78s: about it. Oh, that's a tough name. Oh, shit, that's a really tough name.
5677.94s: Ajie, Ajigoo. I don't know if it's goo, Ajigoo. Let me know how close that is. I feel like
5686.42s: that's pretty accurate. Ajigoo. That's exactly my problem. I keep getting stopped out and then it
5692.42s: goes in my direction. Yeah. So then you just need to watch that latest video that I sent you called
5697.78s: cutting the tails. It's literally about that exact thing. I think that should walk you through
5702.26s: a little bit of it. James says, if directional strategy needs to go your way very quickly,
5707.06s: your stop loss will already be heartburn on your DTEs. Well, it depends on how much room you give
5713.38s: the trade, but the name of the game there is just making sure that it has positive expected return.
5718.26s: That's that's really what it boils down to. Wiggly Worm says, do you have a playlist made for what?
5725.70s: I have a play, I have a ton of playlists. If you go to the YouTube channel here,
5731.06s: I guess if I say if you go to the YouTube channel, it's kind of dumb because you're on the YouTube
5736.42s: channel. Oh, this is kind of fun. I've never actually looked for my own shit. Look at us go.
5745.38s: Hey, this view is cool. Literally never look at this. So if you pop in here,
5755.86s: and then you go to playlists, I got a bunch of playlists, man.
5761.14s: And the reason why I make all these different playlists is ideally, hopefully,
5766.18s: to make it a little easier to find things. So yeah, the stuff that I think you're generally looking for,
5775.30s: if I think it puts them down here, it's kind of annoying that it does it all this shit so out of order.
5780.82s: How do you order these? This is terrible. I literally have them ordered how I want them.
5788.10s: Why does it do this? Here we go. I guess you just have to use this one because I put these in,
5794.34s: I put these in a specific order that I think makes sense. Right? So you can go. Yeah, okay,
5799.22s: this is what we're looking for. This part down here. I don't know why the playlist tab is so like,
5804.50s: this is terrible. You can't find shit. I don't know why they would do this.
5809.46s: It'd be very, very frustrating to find just about anything here.
5817.94s: This like, but yeah, anyways, outside of that, I think it looks decent. And that's essentially
5826.18s: the way that I would work through this. So from the home tab,
5831.06s: it goes just standard videos, the popular videos. These are kind of like the best, so to speak.
5839.14s: So I would start with either this or this depending on where you're at in your trading path.
5845.38s: And then I would just kind of work through these in line with one another. So when you get down
5852.10s: here, this is where we start getting into like specific strategies. We start talking about more
5858.10s: speculative style trades, stuff like that. So I actually think I need to add this, this.
5868.98s: Yeah, so I need to add zero DTEs in here.
5874.74s: Like that. So slight modification to that. That's a little more updated for you. But yeah,
5881.38s: that's essentially where I would go through for the for the playlists.
5885.14s: H says, oh God, FFI not judging by any means, but I think it's interesting for a different reason.
5894.42s: Oh, you're responding to a faunza. All right, let me get back up here. So H says, have you tried
5899.46s: logging? I think you you were meaning lagging into strangles. How do you go about it to maximize
5905.94s: the juice on each side? I don't typically lag into them. Now, big A says, your face on the thumbnails
5913.86s: is lower in the view count. I literally couldn't agree more like 100%. I probably just need to find
5919.22s: like a really hot chicken like a bikini. And then that would actually be hilarious. If it's
5925.94s: this really hot chicken, a bikini, and then you turn on the video and it's my my face, like I
5933.46s: feel like that would just straight up be horrific for people, which is again, hilarious to me.
5941.14s: But yeah, I completely agree with you. Big A's. All right, so let me go back though
5948.26s: to H. And for H for your first question about strangles, I don't typically lag in. I'll just
5955.22s: essentially take the trade that I want. Now, I sometimes will modify the legs as it's moving,
5961.94s: but beyond that, I don't really bother trying to lag in a whole bunch or stuff like that. It's
5967.06s: just not really my go to. So for your second question about have you played with poor man covered
5975.38s: calls? I don't like those personally, but I have a better variation by far that's called a coverage
5982.66s: strain or not a coverage triangle. Sorry, ratio diagonal. So that first playlist is about different
5990.90s: strategies that I use. And then the second link is a specific playlist about ratio diagonals.
5998.34s: And there's actually another video coming out actually tomorrow about ratio diagonals,
6004.58s: because it is one of my hands down go to strategies for pretty much any directional style trading.
6014.50s: The video coming out tomorrow is literally 40 minutes long. So I go through an example in depth.
6020.58s: I go through how I track them, how I find them, how I manage them, like pretty much everything
6026.34s: is is in there. So yeah, that's essentially what I run instead of poor man's covered calls. I don't
6032.26s: like those. Wigglyorm says I would watch the shed out of beginners playlist by you. I have that.
6041.46s: Yeah. So if you haven't seen it, let me grab my playlist. And I have two of them. So this one
6050.90s: this is for you Wigglyworm. So that one is options basics for beginners 101. And then this
6061.62s: other video is like investing in trading 101. So the second video I just dropped is more broad
6069.86s: about like trading in general. And then that first video that I dropped is very specific to
6075.86s: options trading for beginners. So yeah, there's a ton of stuff in there. And I actually just
6082.42s: redid not too long ago my options 101 video. And like it's like an hour and 40 minutes long or
6089.06s: some shit that I literally just shot all the way through just straight through. But the editor
6094.90s: that I had previously that was helping me with that stuff, he unfortunately got hit by a
6099.54s: fucking typhoon. So that is essentially dead in the water. I'm just now hiring another editor
6106.02s: to help with some of these. So hopefully that new options 101 video can come out at least in the
6112.26s: not so distant future. But I mean realistically, there's nothing special about the way I think
6117.62s: about options 101. I don't think I think if you go through like investipedia or through your
6122.02s: broker, either of those would be completely fine. Ricky, that is a fucking epic comment.
6134.66s: Ricky says typhoon equals puts on editor.
6142.10s: My god, that's unbelievable. That's unbelievable.
6147.46s: All right, next one. There's another, there's another post that I haven't read yet. Oh yeah, wait,
6156.98s: let me see if I got through the questions up here. I don't think I did.
6161.62s: Okay, Afonso says, how would I know when premiums are too high before putting on a trade?
6166.18s: I just closed several FFI e positions this week made money, but not what I was expecting considering
6170.98s: the nose dive since I entered. I wouldn't worry about the premiums before you put on a trade
6177.70s: because they're relative to whatever the underlying is in its cycle. So if we look at FFI e for
6184.98s: your example, and we have to zoom in because it's so crushed. And let's just say that we wanted to
6195.94s: start buying options or whatever. Like it doesn't matter what the premium is. The premiums
6201.54s: going to be relative to where it is in price. So for example, if you buy when it's trading at 1052,
6208.50s: the premiums are going to be higher. If you bought it when it was 267, the premiums are going to be
6212.02s: lower. Now there's a slight deviation if we're looking, including implied volatility. And I don't
6219.06s: like buying implied volatility when it's a grigously high kind of like it is in here 276%.
6226.10s: That's like really, really high. And the IV percentile is only 22% though. So it means that it still
6233.22s: has plenty of room to expand in terms of volatility. So even when I'm looking at volatility as an
6239.78s: input, I just don't like buying it when they implied volatility percentile. And for those that
6244.50s: don't know, this isn't actually implied volatility percentile. This is actually implied volatility
6249.22s: rank. They have it mislabeled. They're completely different calculations. That part aside,
6255.06s: this being implied volatility rank, I prefer implied volatility percentile by the way. But
6261.46s: this is just what they have because my calculation is not working for whatever reason. So if you're
6266.90s: wondering though about the difference between IV rank implied volatility percentile, there's a video
6272.98s: for you. And really what I'm doing here is seeing like how expensive the options are relative to
6280.02s: themselves. But it doesn't matter that much because even if you buy an option that has a 100%
6287.54s: implied volatility rank as it sits here, if it goes up, you still make money. It still will make
6293.14s: money if it goes up. And if it goes down, you will still lose money. Now the reason why it starts
6298.42s: to matter is because if you buy something with a really high implied volatility rank and then
6304.90s: volatility starts contracting and nothing else is happening, then you'll start losing money
6312.26s: a little bit faster because of the other factors that are decreasing the value of those options.
6316.98s: So it's kind of relative. But I wouldn't obsess so much over the overall premium. I would view
6323.30s: the premium as like a down payment. And it's not something that we're buying hopefully to just
6328.50s: let go and hope something happens. It's part of a system that's going to be managed either way.
6333.94s: So when we're buying options, we're trying to trade something directionally. So the name of the
6338.90s: game there is doing our best to be directionally correct. So if you buy something that's expensive
6344.90s: in your directionally correct, you're still going to make money.
6351.22s: Uh, uh, uh, let me see.
6356.10s: Brad says you use the term someone is building a position. I understand the term build out a position.
6362.82s: But is there an advantage to building out over time as as opposed to buying strikes all at once?
6368.50s: Definitely. So Brad, for your question, it depends entirely on the strategy. But so for example,
6376.34s: if I'm trading something like the coverage strangle, leaving enough room to scale into a trade over
6382.98s: time is really, really important to that strategy. Same thing if I'm trading a more thematic position
6391.46s: in something like T triple cues. Being able to scale into this during down moves is really,
6399.86s: really important because if you're trying to hold something longer term and you don't do that,
6407.94s: then as something like this goes from 85 down to 49 and let's say that you didn't dollar cost
6414.26s: average into it, scale into it, then you still haven't gotten back to break even. It still would
6419.86s: need to essentially get all the way back up here and it's not there yet. If you get in here with
6424.74s: maybe 50% of your capital and then each subsequent 10% drop you add to it, that will lower your
6432.26s: break even point over time by dollar cost averaging in. So then as it gets up here, you're probably
6437.30s: actually making some money at this point. So depending on what you're trading in the kind of products,
6442.26s: the process of scaling into and out of things is actually really, really important. Now, what I would
6447.54s: say is you have to take a really careful look at the profit mechanism because for example,
6453.54s: let's find something that is showing specific behavior. I got to run a quick scan. So work with me here.
6466.50s: Yeah, this is fine. No, this is not fine. We need options.
6472.90s: On this again.
6478.18s: So I'm looking for a specific condition to show you. There. So let's say in this case that you
6490.98s: want to trade a breakout style strategy. And let's say that you noticed that this thing's been
6496.90s: range bound from essentially, you know, 70 bucks down to 54. It's just kind of been oscillating in
6504.50s: this range. And let's say for whatever reason, I don't know why it broke out here. Obviously,
6510.02s: some sort of reason. But let's say that as it broke above this level, let me draw a price.
6516.50s: As it broke above this level, you want to start buying it. So then close to the open,
6521.86s: you want to start putting a position on. Well, if you're too gun shy and let's say you have a 100%
6528.26s: total allocation, but you only put on 20% of your position upfront. Well, if you get your move,
6534.50s: you don't make the money. Now, this is for a specific style of trading. This is for break out or
6540.18s: break down style positions. So if you're trading another kind of position, then it's not relegated to
6545.94s: this. But that's why it's highly dependent on what you're trading, what strategy you're trading,
6553.54s: whether or not scaling in or out makes sense. And to what degree it makes sense. So it's got to start
6559.70s: with the profit mechanism. And then it's got to rotate over into whatever strategy you're using.
6567.38s: That's how I would think about it personally. And then the next question is from H.
6578.10s: And H says, do you tend to like buying puts or selling calls more? I don't have a preference.
6589.30s: I don't buy puts a ton by itself. But I do trade the put ratio diagonal.
6597.78s: Yeah, I don't really care. It really is more so just what fits whatever I'm trying to trade more.
6604.02s: Honestly, like that's the way I look at it. H says, would it be best to short calls for
6609.62s: downside exposure when Ive is high and puts when it's low? That's okay. You can do that. Again,
6614.82s: to me, that's looking at it wrong. But you can do that. There's nothing wrong with that, in my
6619.62s: opinion. The reason why I don't like looking at that is because it's like prioritizing a second
6626.98s: dairy profit mechanism. You're putting the wrong thing first. So in this case, if we have a
6633.06s: scenario that we're trying to play something to the downside, when you're talking about if you're
6638.34s: selling calls or buying puts, we're essentially just saying how do we make money to the downside
6644.58s: with volatility? That's what that's trying to isolate, which to me is secondary. What's primary
6650.74s: is the direction of the product. Again, this is a really common misconception I think by traders
6658.10s: that aren't focusing on putting what I call first things first. Let me grab something like this
6665.38s: and then let me grab, I gotta update this. We want down days and we don't want the turn day.
6672.66s: So we'll get rid of the turn day. We'll clear this out so it can be anything with options.
6678.42s: So I'm just looking for some stuff that has had some consecutive down days.
6684.66s: And let's look for stuff that looks ugly.
6691.78s: Here, this looks good. Well, it looks good, but bad. So AMX,
6699.46s: if implied volatility, let's just say here for whatever reason, was really, really high.
6708.66s: If implied volatility was super high here, then if I sell a call or buy a put,
6718.50s: it's secondary. It's completely secondary. The reason why it's secondary is let's say up here,
6725.30s: when it was, when it hit this high and it started rotating down, you're like, okay, well,
6729.22s: I want to sell a call or buy a put. I mean, shit, let's look at an example.
6734.02s: We need to go back to, let's go here. This is typically when I would do it, is when it starts
6739.86s: breaking below this level right there, somewhere in there. So then let's say,
6746.90s: probably here is when I would have done it on the 21st, just guessing, again, this is in hindsight,
6752.66s: so I can see what happens, but I'm also not purposely perfectly timing it because, again,
6758.42s: this is how I know I would trade this. And then I would do an initial stop somewhere there,
6764.90s: and then probably the hard stop would go up there, something like that. So let's take a look at
6771.14s: an example here. I just need these options to open up for us a little ago. So let's take a look.
6781.14s: We can sell a call, and again, these are, it's obviously all bullshit, right, because
6789.86s: it's on demand, so it's not giving me realistic prices. We'll literally just fill them in for
6794.26s: ourselves. So 35 Delta is probably where I would sell, and let's say you get the mid price of
6800.50s: 55 cents. We'll analyze that trade just so that we can reference this price as we move time.
6807.86s: And then let's say the other scenario is we go a little further out in time, and then we buy
6813.06s: some slightly in the money putts. Let's buy these 20s. And again, let's say that we get them closer
6817.38s: to the midpoint, something like 85 cents, and analyze the trade. So at this point, we might be
6825.14s: arriving at this conclusion that we want to sell because volatility is super high. Let's just say
6830.90s: implied volatility was as high as it gets. Now let's fast forward time a couple weeks. Let's go to
6836.42s: the seventh of June. This should come down a bit by then. Okay, come down a lot by then.
6842.98s: And just taking a look at my levels, I would have gotten stopped out here on this day if it closed
6851.14s: above that. With this kind of really long wick, I would watch it on the day. So this wouldn't,
6859.70s: at least based on my typical trend following system, wouldn't stop me out in this scenario.
6864.50s: Then this doesn't matter. This doesn't matter. So I essentially would have gotten stopped out.
6868.58s: Once it falls below this kind of point of control, I look at the next value area down here.
6874.58s: So then this would become the new stop after this day and so on and so forth. So again,
6880.42s: this is all armchair quarterbacking, but I'm just kind of talking about the way I typically would
6883.86s: follow this kind of thing. So now let's take a look at the analyze tab. So we got into these 21s,
6889.38s: these short 21 calls for 55 cents. Let's see what those are running at. So in this case,
6896.50s: again, taking the midpoint between 0 and 50 on these 21s, you essentially would be making $25.
6904.58s: That's what that would be giving you. Then on these that we originally bought for 85 cents,
6911.46s: the midpoint here is $2.83. So essentially you make $200 give or take. So we might be looking at
6919.14s: this and say, well, wait, we were supposed to sell when volatility was high. That's a secondary
6925.06s: profit factor. It didn't matter that volatility was high because it absolutely crashed.
6931.22s: The Delta portion of the movement was so much greater. So this is a scenario going all the way back to
6940.42s: H's question about what would be best to short calls for downside when IV is high and puts
6946.18s: when it's low. That's not the way I look at it at all. The way I look at it is it depends on the thesis.
6952.26s: If my idea is breakdown, aka big down move, I don't care if vol is higher low. I'm going to buy
6959.94s: the puts because it gives me a better exposure to the profit mechanism I'm trying to trade.
6966.66s: If I'm trading something that's more range bound, then absolutely I might favor a change in volatility
6972.66s: in that case sell the calls in order to benefit from a change in volatility.
6978.74s: So that is exactly why I would differentiate it that way. The reason why people do that is because
6984.42s: it's a tasty trade ism and it's because they tend to have a preference to sell anyways.
6989.14s: But a lot of people kind of just lift that and shift it without in my opinion, like fully thinking
6993.94s: through the implications of it. And to me, it absolutely comes down simply to what is it that we're
7000.98s: trying to trade and what it's it the best. I have a video coming out in a little bit about
7007.14s: this idea of matching profit mechanisms because I think it's something a lot of people tend to skip over.
7015.22s: H says, do you ever use short shares to sell puts against here about covered calls frequently,
7020.66s: not really about the inverse? I don't. For that kind of thing, I would just trade ratio put
7026.98s: diagonals. I don't tend to short shares. John says, bad idea to add to a losing position depends
7035.46s: on the strategy. I would say for beginners, yes, if you're trading and you don't have a profitable
7041.30s: strategy yet and you're starting like you're still figuring it out, I would say essentially don't
7044.98s: average down unless your dollar cost averaging into something you're holding long term like
7049.70s: an actual investment index ETF, whatever, then that's fine. But if you're adding to a losing
7055.78s: position as a new trader, the overwhelming probability is you are going to very likely piss money
7063.94s: away by throwing good money after bad. So I would be super, super not willing to do that as a new
7071.94s: trader. Once you're a more experienced trader, you understand how you behave the way your brain
7077.14s: works the way you do things, then you can explore that gray area a little bit more, I think.
7083.94s: So yeah.
7091.22s: Alfonso says, you have a different definition of dollar cost averaging than I do. I call that
7095.54s: lowering cost basis. Well, Alfonso, that's because I call it again, I call it the accurate thing.
7102.74s: Because guess what? A lot of the times that I'm dollar cost averaging, it's up. A lot of times I
7109.22s: will scale into things as they're going up, which doesn't decrease my cost basis at all.
7118.50s: Right? So that again, that's why I tend to try and use accurate terminology for what I'm doing.
7127.94s: Because again, the idea of only buying things when they're going down to me doesn't make sense.
7135.14s: So for example, T triple cues, I already talked about this. I gave an example of this trade.
7140.74s: I started buying in, I forgot where somewhere in here is some shit and I was buying in it as it
7145.46s: was going down, I was buying in as it was going down, down, down, down, down. And then I kept buying
7149.86s: here, even after it started going up, I'm still dollar cost averaging into the product. But this
7157.14s: is actually raising my basis, but it's starting to move in my favor. So I don't care if I raise my
7163.46s: basis if it moves enough in my favor. So yeah, that's why I differentiate there.
7174.50s: Alfonso says dollar cost averaging would be as an example, buying 100 dollars of Apple. That's
7179.22s: another way you can dollar cost average for sure. You don't, again, dollar cost averaging isn't
7184.42s: relegated to being time bound. It's not a time series specific concept.
7190.34s: Right, just think of the terms dollar cost averaging is just averaging is buying more.
7195.46s: So you can buy more when it's expensive. You can buy more when it's less to your point. You can buy
7199.78s: more on a temporal basis based on a certain span of time. You can buy more based on a certain
7205.30s: percent change in the underlying. It's not, it's not specific and it's not based off of a time
7211.14s: series. Alfonso says they think it is as chat GPT. Like I don't care. Doesn't like, I don't
7219.86s: need chat GPT to explain it to me. I know what it is. Because again, like what would you call it then
7225.30s: if you bought here, you bought here, you bought here, you bought here. The exact effect is dollar cost
7234.10s: averaging. That's exactly what happened. It's not necessarily a fixed time frame.
7242.90s: So averaging down, it's not averaging down. If I buy here at 52 63 and I buy here at 54 75,
7253.22s: what just happened to my average? My average cost basis went up, not down. It's not averaging down.
7262.90s: You could call it averaging up. I'm okay with that. That's what it is. But again, the more
7268.74s: the more comprehensive term for both of those scenarios is just dollar cost averaging.
7278.02s: Okay, couple more. Recess, can I roll my six internet points into the next stream or were that
7287.06s: lock in a loss? That's a great question. I think that we can, I think it'll probably be per stream
7294.66s: and kind of track. That's my guess. Dark Mark says, enjoy the channel. New StraightFrode approach.
7302.10s: The BJJ is strong with you. I love me some Jets, dog. Can you give me your take on why Robin Hood
7306.58s: should be avoided as a trading platform? Any concerns? Yeah, I hate Robin Hood. Everybody in
7311.06s: their mother knows that I will take any opportunity to trash Robin Hood. The main reason why I don't
7316.90s: like Robin Hood is just because it, for a trader's world, it's not as advantaged as you think.
7326.82s: And it's because they hide their costs on the back end and you get worse aggregate fills,
7333.14s: which you can track yourself. So I think that's the main reason. Like if I was going to be a trader,
7342.26s: I would simply trade and I would focus on good platforms that enable that. I wouldn't necessarily,
7350.90s: I wouldn't necessarily bother by trying to decrease every single cost possible because to a degree,
7359.54s: you start to get like what you pay for. So yeah, I think I don't like Robin Hood because it's
7370.02s: not a robust trading platform. That's the way I would think about it personally.
7377.14s: All right, gang, that wraps me up. Wiggly Worm says, in a nutshell, how would you trade?
7385.38s: I love that. So Wiggly Worm, you know the funny part about that? I literally, I literally just
7393.14s: recorded a video that's called How I Trade Options. And that one comes out on the 7th of September.
7402.26s: So the goal that video is hopefully to answer that exact question and kind of give like a general
7408.26s: overview of the way that I trade options. It's just hilarious that you ask that question now.
7415.54s: All right, gang, I'm out of here. I hope you all have a killer weekend. I will see the apes tomorrow
7421.38s: for the GME livestream. I have a couple of things I want to go over specifically. And then we will
7426.18s: dive into really whatever else you all help me learn about. That's one of my favorite parts about
7431.86s: the sessions tomorrow's. I get to learn a lot myself. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
