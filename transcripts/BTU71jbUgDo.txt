 What's up, outliers? Happy Friday. It is time. We have our next segment of options trading for beginners. I'm going to grab the chat so that I can keep up with you all. It looks like we already got Reese and Sposecar in here. Good to see you both. So the vision for today is pretty simple. I want to walk through some basic scenarios with you all, hopefully pulling some of them from you. And the way that I envision this going is ideally we'll be able to mix some different cases, some from your personal experiences and talking about what happened and why we'll talk about some from mine. But I primarily want to focus our attention on things that we can find from the rest of the trading world. So what that means is actually poking through Reddit and looking at some of the things that people are looking at struggling with so on and so forth because you can find a lot of really interesting discussion points from Reddit. So for those, for those that think Reddit is really only for toxic conversations and stuff like that. I mean, it is for that, but it's not just for that. We have a couple other uses that we can pull from Reddit. Looks like we also got Elon songs in Shrej. We got the we got the gang in town. So that's the vision for today. Now to kick us off, I'm going to walk through a little bit of some general questions. And the idea here again is they're kind of like a quiz. We'll call it a quiz. You are rated on your performance. And you do have the opportunity to potentially win fake internet points, which is pretty sick. I like to think the ability to win some fake internet points. But the main thing is I just kind of want to use these to warm us up for the conversation. Now in the meantime though, I would love for you to share with me some of your recent trading experiences, either something that worked differently than you expected. That's the first scenario. If you have any of those. And then the second thing is something that you learned for the first time. So either of those are great fits for this part. The reason I asked that second question is ideally to start the flow of information sharing laterally. That's why I like to ask that question. And then the first question is because it gives us an opportunity to explore a concept together. So first question is something that happened in it didn't work out as you expected for some reason or another. And then the second one is anything that you knew for the first time either or that you learned for the first time I should say. It looks like we also got Dom. We got Dr. Zayus in threshold solutions. That's a cool ass name to be honest. We got Ben. Cool. All right. So let's start with the quiz. Shall we let me grab a note pad or something and then I'll write the questions out for you. Here we can do it through here. This might crash everything. I don't know. Sometimes this gets a little testy when I have too much stuff running kind of like I do right now. We'll see if it opens up. I'm just grabbing the white board for us so that I can show you the exact questions I want to ask. There it goes. Here we go. Look, this is even got the old name. ES invests. That's OG. Also for the folks that have been going through the different like links that I have all over the place and letting me know that stuff is broken, you guys are the true heroes because I have links everywhere. And obviously I do my best to keep them updated. But with this whole brand shift and kind of changing things, everything literally needs to be updated, which is kind of difficult to facilitate. All right. So Q1. What are the common for all IV to differ from put? Here's your first question. You might have to wrap it. Yeah. Give me one sec. Just because I've made the text obnoxiously massive. Let's see if that fits better. There you go. All right. Here's Q1. So I'll leave that in there and then I'll start working on the other questions. So the first question is you may or may not be able to read if you're listening. I'll read it to you. It says, what are the common reasons that call IV differs from put IV? That's question one. So if you know the answer, throw it into the chat. And then in the meantime, I'm writing up these other ones. There's only two other ones. Any guesses for question one? Here's question two. And then I got one more for you. Ben says activity on the chain. It's not wrong, but it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a more structural level response. It's not a bad guess, but I wouldn't give that credit. He says puts like insurance people willing to overpay. Elon song says hedging on puts. Okay. So those are technically correct. That's part of the reason. There are other reasons from a structural standpoint. So let's pretend that the put prices or let's say that the call and puts are actually priced closer to their theoretical equivalent, meaning that we wouldn't have that implied volatility variance. And we're looking more at a structural reason. I want to be clear, those answers from Reese and Elon songs are both correct. You both get plus one fake internet point. Those are completely correct. I'm just trying to walk you on to target for the other reasons that stem from a more structural perspective. Any other guesses? I can put my note pad down now. Okay. So let's think about other things that impact the price of an option. If we're thinking about options, there's an important but often overlooked inject is to how we arrive at prices. What's something that impacts calls that doesn't impact puts? I want you to think specifically about a scenario where you might be more likely to be assigned early. You're more likely to be assigned early on the in money call in a specific circumstance that is not the same for puts. What is that scenario? Any guesses? David in Reese. My man, Reese, you now get plus one fake internet point. I think you're now at plus two fake internet points. That's exactly correct. So the reason why you'll see call implied volatility differ from put implied volatility because it has this other element that impacts it that doesn't impact it the same as the put side. So again, abundantly clear from a practitioner standpoint, the first two answers from Liz and Reese were spot on. The fact that people are willing to overpay for puts is completely correct. Then there's another scenario that I'm just outlining now from a structural standpoint that also injects a slight nuance between the two products in the way that we would price them. So that's exactly correct. Nice job. So Reese right now has plus two. This game, you have to track your own points because I don't have the mindset to be able to maybe I need to figure out a scoreboard. Sooner or later, I might be able to do live streams like an actual live streamer and have resources and shit. But I don't know how to do any of that. So unfortunately right now it's track your own point. So Reese, I think you're at plus two though. Okay. So the next question, which is kind of related to what we were just talking about is why do we differentiate between American and European style options? Why do we even bother differentiating between those two things? Any guesses? There's a couple very, very specific reasons. Liz says expiration date exercising early with American options, which makes pricing more complicated. Yep, exactly. So Elon songs got it in right, Ben got it in right. So plus one fake internet point for Elon songs, Ben Reese, I think you also got it in at a time. So we'll give it to you as well. Dr. Zayas, I'll give it to you as well. That's completely correct. So the fact that they can be exercised or have different exercise rules leads to some important differences in how we interpret the positions, right? Because if we have something that we know as a seller can't be exercised up until expiration, that changes my risk profile significantly. Because for example, if we're looking at something like GameStop, Primetime example, because like this is literally the exact scenario that this would apply to. So if we take a look at GameStop and right now I have long shares and I have some short calls against my long shares. Okay. If I did not have my long shares, I would not have the short calls. Why is that? Why do you think I'm okay offering short calls against my long shares? But I'm not okay offering just short calls in something like GameStop. Beyond the fact that I don't want to fade it to the downside, don't want to do that. Reese says they're covered. Okay, go a little deeper though. I want a little bit more of a technical answer here. Why does that matter? The fact that they're covered. Reese says you could lose money to infinity. That's part of it. Still not exactly the answer I'm looking for. It's not wrong though, but you're on the right track there. That would be like a partial credit, although I'm not a partial credit kind of guy. So still no fake internet point for that. Although it's not wrong to be clear, I just have a very specific answer that I'm thinking about. You long song says, say, cue again. Happy to why would I be okay selling calls in GameStop against my shares, but not okay just selling calls in GameStop in an alternate scenario where I have no shares. So Reese already pointed out the fact that they're covered, which is the correct path to go down. Link it to what we were just talking about. This age says you want to be able to participate to the upside, not get blown out. That's moving the correct direction. BW says because you only lose the money that you have. Technically, I wouldn't lose any money with the covered calls. So that's not it. Reese is on it. Reese is on it right away. Early exercise. That's the danger. Why is early exercise so dangerous in this case? Because it's GameStop and it goes through these prolonged periods. So think of it this way. If let me, let me grab my handy dandy notepad, I think everybody always understands better with the notepad. I think this is scientifically proven that the notepad explains it. Okay, so we have scenario one scenario one where I have let's just call it plus 200 shares and short one call. So in this scenario like this, if this call right here gets assigned early, a very simple transaction occurs. I'm now going to sell 100 shares. Well, I already have 200 shares. So essentially, it's just going to sell 100 of my 200 shares, leaving me 100 shares. No problem. We're Gucci here. This is the other scenario that has to do with getting stuck. So in this case, I'm just short one call. Same scenario happens. There's early exercise. In this scenario now, I'm short 100 shares of a stock that's hard to borrow with typically four plus days to cover and I carry. This is why. Because if GameStop for example was a European style option and couldn't be exercised early. In this scenario, I can just ride out these moves because again, we want GameStop to go to the moon, but even if it does go to the moon, it probably will at some point descend back to earth. It's kind of like if you're fading volatility products. It's very similar. You can go through these massive expansions that can be very painful, but sooner or later, it does come back to a nominal level. It's the same thing with something like volatility products. Now the risk profile completely changes in this scenario because let's say I get assigned here for whatever reason and now I'm short 100 shares. The underlying starts flying up. It's already hard to borrow. So even as a retail trader, again, playing the scenario that I have a tiny position, short 100 shares, this difficulty to cover is not, it doesn't really apply in this scenario. This difficulty to cover comes into play when I have tens of thousands of shares. When I actually have a position, it's just important to understand that difference here. I'm just using a very small position as a general example. 100 shares is no problem. But if you have tens of thousands of shares, this actually becomes a bit of a problem because it also becomes difficult to locate, to carry the position, the broker struggles to find the shares, to loan them to you. So then in that scenario, they're going to charge you a higher interest rate to carry that short position because it's hard to borrow. This is why in something like this, being assigned early is a giant problem. And this is why I care about products that I trade, whether they're American or European style options because this difference can drastically impact my strategy drastically. Does that make sense? So we differentiate between American and European style options because they incur different risk and they have different pricing components to them because of that risk. And this is a great example as to how that risk can show itself. So now the other question, actually, let me bring this back because I forgot. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on this one. Why let me grab a different color? Why am I doing this here? Why am I long 200 shares? And in this example, short just one call. Why am I doing this? Reese asks a great question. All options I've traded are American or futures European. It depends. It depends because there are tons of products that you can trade options on that are still European style. And same thing with futures, they actually have both, which I'll show you. Reese is on it again and so is H. So Reese gets plus fake one internet point and so does H. In case he has no Reese's smashing you guys right now, I think is that like plus four or plus five? I don't know who's in second place. I don't really concern myself with second place. Whoever that is though, I would get your shit together because Reese is smashing it. But that's exactly why. Reese has five points exactly. So we got to be all going to have to step up. Who's in second place right now? I need to be able to track at least the top two. So Reese has five. I don't know who is in second. But this is exactly why. It's Elon songs. Okay. Liz, how many points do you have? Jotato is now hurling insults, which I love to see saying that Reese is cheating, which is perfect. That's exactly what we should do is if somebody is outperforming you, the first thing you should do is definitely figure out what they're doing to cheat and then call them out on it. So I love that. That's perfect. BW says top answer is don't think too hard. Keep it simple. Get in and get out. That's a fantastic way to get your face script off in trading. That's a tough way to go about the business. You don't have to over complicate things. That's fair. And I agree with you. But this is why we have that one trader. This misunderstanding right here is really, really important. It's not a pedantic point. It's not like a fun bar fact. This is a completely different thing. BW says I made 10K today on puts in 30 minutes. I'm stoked for you. I'm really stoked. The problem is is like, again, $10,000 is a drop in the bucket and a lifetime of trading is different. I've seen tons of people come and go in the business. And again, I'm stoked that you made money. But flashing your 10 grand is if that's something special, it's not. It doesn't really matter. So I would just focus on the right things. So this differentiation, though, is why we had that instance before. And if you look on, I forgot which sub it is. Let me see if I can find it. I think it was a UVX UVX Y box spread. Let me see if I can find this trade. Okay, so this is an article about it. I don't remember where it's from or anything. I know it's from Reddit. I don't remember who it was. But this is why this right here is why you need to know the difference between American and European options. Let's start with box spreads. Box spreads are a big part of what I do because they increase the efficiency of just about all of my strategies. Damn it. Where did the check go? Give me a second. I gotta find you guys. There you are right there. So that's a video about box spreads. This is a video about a box spread trade log. And I want to walk you through box spreads really quick. It's essentially a way to offer the market a risk-free trade. It's genuinely risk-free. If you put on a box spread correctly, and I'm going to walk you through exactly what this looks like. So if we take a look at something that's European style option SPX, like this, European style option. So again, European style option means what? It means that there's no early exercise. Now this also happens to be cash settled. A lot of European options are cash settled. Actually, I think the vast majority are. There might be some really nuanced products that might be European but not cash settled, but I don't know many of them. And none of them are striking me off the top of the head. I just don't want to leave you down the right, the wrong path. I would think of them disparately, but you can generally assume if something's European style, it's going to be cash settled. There might be, again, some small nuances to that. So SPX, no early assignment, cash settled. If I want to buy a box spread, this is a way for me to essentially loan the counter party of that trade money. I'm loaning them money. And then I collect an interest on that trade. So for example, I have on right now, actually, which is it expired today. And the box spread that I had on was, I'll show you the trade. And it was, I put it on the 12th of August. So the trade went on about eight, well, not about exactly 18 days ago. And it was for today. So let's go to the 12th of August. And let's put on this trade so you can see exactly how it works. 12th of August, whatever time entry we want to look at. And so the trade went on for 12 August. I gotta wait for the calendar or I'm sorry, the 30, 30th of August here, 18 days. So fun fact, the reason why I selected this expiration, which is not my go-to expiration for box spreads, I want to be in the most liquid expiration cycles typically. But I literally was parking money that I'm using for a real estate deal. So this is literally like a live application of the strategy to earn some sort of yield. It's exactly why I structured this position the way I did is because I had money that was going to go into a real estate deal next week. And I didn't want to just sitting not doing anything. So I can put it in a box spread. Again, in this case, you get to pick your expiration. So 18 days fit my time frame perfectly. Now, the more common use case for this for me is when I'm trading things that require cash, but I'm not using the cash up front. So for example, a cash secured put as part of the covered stringle. If I sell a cash secured put, the broker doesn't automatically cash secure it. I have to cash secure it in my own accounting. So instead of just having that money sitting, they're doing nothing or just collecting whatever, Schwab puts it in a money market fund, which is typically not a great yield. Even now it's not a great relative yield. I'll put it into something like a box spread. So let's take a look at the trade on, so I went out to 30 August, and I put on the 5,000, 6,000. Why the 5,000, 6,000? Because the wider I make the box spread, the fewer I have to put on. That's what it comes down to. Now there's a slight nuance to this. Because if you make it too wide, then it becomes really difficult to find the liquidity to put the trade on. So this here is still a 10 delta. I'm not like super, super, super far out of the money. So I go out to the, you know, this case, the 5,000 handle, and then I'll buy the in the money, call, sell the out of the money, put, then I'll run all the way over here to the 6,000s and essentially do the same on the inverse by these, sell these. So here's what's happening in this scenario. I forgot the analyze trade thing doesn't work here. That's super annoying, but I'll still walk you through it. Oh, there it goes. It's doing it. Ho, Ray. So, and I'll show you on the live one, too, just so that you can see exactly how it looks like. But notice how this line is flat. This is the PNL graph, right? So the Y axis is how much money I make. And then the X axis is different prices in the underlying. Notice how this line is just horizontal above the PNL. It's a guaranteed profit. Why is that? Because I'm buying something that's a thousand points wide. In this case, 5,000, 6,000, thousand points wide. When I put on, let's just say it's a one lot. I put on a one lot. In this scenario right here, it would go on for 99,723 dollars. But the width of the spread is worth $100,000. So in this scenario, I put up, I didn't put up 990s. Oh, I did put up that's actually hilarious. This is what I answered the trade-up was 997 on the nose. So in this case, I paid the market. I bought this box spread for 99,700 dollars. At the end of the life cycle of the trade, I get the difference between the width of the strike, which is a thousand points and what I paid. And again, I'll show you that on a live, on a live version. I just want you to see what this looks like. So then as time passes, you will make a little bit of that money each day until you get all the way to expiration. So now if I get rid of on demand again so that you can see it more real time, because it'll look a little bit differently. So kind of ignore this purple line because this is looking at today, right? And obviously it's a little bit too late because you don't do a box spread for the same day. So let's take a look at an example if I wanted to put one on for 20 DTE. And then let's say I put on a similar structure where I run 5,000 here. And then 6,000 again, we got a scroll for a minute. Here we go. Here's the 6,000s. We will buy these. We will sell these. And then let's take a look at what this looks like. So you notice here, it's guaranteed profit. This blue line shows you what it's worth at expiration. If I crunch this all the way down, looking at all possible scenarios for SPX, it doesn't matter if SPX goes from current spot price, literally down to 100. You still make that same amount of money. It's a risk-free trade. Now in the case of the one I was showing you that I got into that 1,000 point widespread, which again, I'm referring to my spreadsheet that again, you can grab one yourself. It's easy to make, but I essentially can see what I'm earning over the current risk-free rate, which I use the corresponding bond that's closest to what I'm comparing. So in this case, the annualized return for the box spread that I put on was 6.1%. The corresponding yield for the same time frame closest to was like 5%, like 5.3, 5. So I'm essentially making a pretty healthy margin over the corresponding risk-free rate for the commensurate time frame. That's the cool part about box spreads. Now, if taking this all the way back to the point of this offshoot about why this matters to us is because if you put a box spread on, which should be risk-free, it should be a risk-free loan to the market that you are collecting a yield that should be slightly better than the market yield. If you do this kind of thing in something that has early exercise and is not cash-settled, you have massive freaking risk. And that's exactly what happened to this person. Here it is. Let me see if I can find that to a reddit post. That would be fun. Yes, so this. So you can see essentially what happened to them. They put on a box spread in UVXY because they were going to collect a whole bunch of money. So you can see they put up $250,000 and essentially they were already up 9 grand. Anytime that you look at the markets and you think something is too good to be true, it probably is, you're not going to get a risk-free return like that. But this person didn't understand the difference between American and European style options. So they put on a box spread, which again, if it's in a European style cash-settled product and you structure it correctly, it's a risk-free trade. It doesn't matter if it goes up, down, sideways, circles, you still will make the money if you hold it to expiration. That is not the case for non-European style options or American style options. That is not the case. You can get your head torn off because now you have early assignment risk, which is massive. Ari says, is this the guy who got box spreads banned from Robin? I don't know. That's a great question. I'm completely uncertain. But this is exactly why we care about this. Hopefully that example makes sense to you that sometimes these seemingly pedantic, annoying nuances actually matter more than we think. So there's that. Okay, the third question is, I bought a call. The stock went up, but I lost money. Why would I have lost money? Ram Alama, thank you so much for the chat and the 10 bucks. That's going to go towards my dinner tonight, much appreciated. I will grab your question in just a second. So H says, so as long as it's European style, you're good to go then. As long as it's European style, that's cash settled and you structure the trade correctly. Then yes. BW says Theta could be. We have to be more specific than that. H is a better answer. H says, volcrush slash reduction plus Theta. I like that answer the best. James says, would MES be a good candidate for smaller accounts? Let's talk about MES in a second. Give me, give me a minute to go through this one. If I skip past the James, just ask the question again and I'll 100% get to it. You long songs also says Theta. Okay, so big A says or it didn't reach the strike if out the money. That is actually incorrect. Big A's. So that last part of your response is looking at the wrong thing. But one is expensive is fair. Ram Alama says, option value drop due to Theta, Vega or both. Yep, there we go. Okay, so let's talk about it. If we have an option, in this case, we bought a call and the underlying goes up a set amount and we lose money. The two things that you highlighted are the primary drivers. Why it wouldn't work out for you. The first one could be that you bought, let me grab my notepad, standby. Gotta make sure I can draw this all out for you. I feel like when I look at our ability to understand things, it's essentially predicated on my artwork. Because otherwise, I don't know how we would arrive at these conclusions without these drawings. It's kind of like quintessential. Okay, so we have a long call and the reason why I phrased that question so loosely is because I wanted to see the way that you would take it and how precise you would be. So in this case, the closest answer would be from H, but it's still not as precise as I would want it to be. So the way that I would want to see you answer this question is the first reason would be that your premium moved less than either or a combination of data or Vega. Now, I know again, that sounds kind of pedantic. It kind of reminds me of my seventh grade math teacher, Mr. Simon's. Remember this dude's name like like that comes right to the top of the dome because when we were working on proofs, if you didn't answer the proof within a triangle, if you didn't bother to write that, he would literally mark that part of the proof wrong. And that seemed super annoying to me. That might be why I'm always so fascinated by the details because maybe it was Mr. Simon's. He was a homie. He was one of the first dudes that got me to like answering, um, to like answering math questions. Reece says we're just trying to answer quickly to get those sweet, sweet points. Correct, but again, if it's fast and wrong, then it's fast and wrong. But you're still, I think, gen, like overwhelmingly in the lead. So you're still crushing it. But this one I would give the plus one fake internet point again to H. I think he was the closest. The reason why I want the answer to be like this and not just saying theta or Vega because people then innately start to think theta is out to get them or that if they just hold an option, theta is going to kill them. And it's not the case. It's simply that your theta needs to outpace your delta, which in this case would be how we're trying to profit from this case, which is from the directional movement. So how can we identify if theta is going to outpace our delta super simple? We can take a look again, we'll switch this back to GME. And let's pick something that's like this. So let's say we have this out here. These are all good. So in this case, we're all good. But anyways, in this case, if GME moves one point, you get a nine cent move, but then you lose four cents in theta. Okay. So then what happens if a day passes and GME moves half of a point, meaning 50 cents. Well, it means you get half of this delta. So your option would appreciate in premium by four and a half cents. And you still would eat this entire daily theta of four cents. So then this starts to get magnified the closer we are in time. So for example, if we look at the options expiring next week, and we go out as far as we can, in this case, it's the 45s that they offer the furthest out. If we go all the way out as far as we can go, you're at a four delta. That means if game stop moves, one full point, one dollar in your direction, in this case, up. If it moves that full point over the course of the day, you you're going to see four cents in your premiums. However, you're out running five cents or five dollars of theta. So this is how you can assess based on how much theta is bleeding out in a daily basis, how much you need this thing to move based on how much time is left so that it doesn't eat your entire lunch. That's the idea. So that's one way. The other way is through Vega, which is you absolutely accurately identified. So when we're looking at Vega, we can see here we see Vega of 0.01. It's generally insignificant. Vega is going to be highest for at the money options though. So you can absolutely have an instance where the underlying on your short term option moves a point and it's outpaced by your theta and or your Vega. But it's important to note that your delta still will appreciate that portion of your options premium. If the underlying goes up, you've made money from delta, but you've just lost more money from theta or Vega. That's the idea behind it. Rika says, what good delta and theta do you look for when you buy? That's a fantastic question. I have a video that walks through buying options specifically for these kinds of scenarios. I made it originally for the apes so that we didn't go through a bunch of problems. There. So you can check that video out. The main thing is that we, at least for me, I try to strike a balance between delta. How much it's going to move if I get a move in my favor. And then how much I'm paying in theta. That's really what it boils down to for me. But that video will walk you through pretty far in detail. All right. So I'm going to go back up and grab Ram Alama's question who said two weeks of DTE spy trading in the green and continuing to deepen knowledge and strategies, which is sick. What is your philosophy on stop loss orders, dual edge blade? They've both saved and cut profits. Yep. That's exactly it. So Ram Alama in that instance, the way that I would look at whether or not it makes sense is if it works out in the aggregate. And I have an entire playlist. I don't know if you've seen it on zero DTE options. Let me grab it zero zero zero zero. One sec. Let me find it. This playlist. Here you go. So that playlist there walks us through different ways to think about that exact trade off. So the idea behind it for me at least is I want to strike a balance between the probability of me getting stopped out and the probability of me absorbing a really massive loss. So you'll see a few different versions in there. And I actually have it on my to-do list to update based on what I'm seeing this year because this year there's another change I've made to my zero DTE strategy where I'm not waiting until the close anymore. Most days I'm using like a volatility adjusted metric where I'm closing out the trade before the close at least by 10 minutes typically 15 plus. I'm finding that is just reducing a ton of return volatility. And it's because I continue I continue seeing days like this. And again, my goal is not to like think if I'm seeing it. The goal is for me to quantify how much I'm seeing it. So I track the daily move of SPX intra-day minute by minute high low. And I see how frequently do we get these big end of day moves. And again, it doesn't have to be up. When I'm trading zero DTEs more often than not, I'm trading short strangle short something like that typically short strangle. And so it doesn't matter if it goes up or down. But if there's a big end of day move, I can get run over. So that's precisely why in this case, I started noticing that if I close out a little bit earlier again, you can see that this move started kicking off right at 1250, right? 10 minutes before the close. This is somebody that's trying to position before liquidity gets fully sucked out. The other thing that I notice is because I will use stops on my zero DTEs sometimes. And if you get stopped towards the market close like in the last minute, you can get some of the most disgusting, egregious fills that you've ever seen in your entire life. So I normally will exit before those periods. So that's why my strategy's been evolving a bit. And I'm in again, my game plan is to do a video that walks through some of these updates. But that's a great question. So yeah, let me know if that answers your question, Mr. Ramalama. All right. Reese says, as somebody who doesn't day trade, what's the main appeal is your DTEs? The main appeal of zero DTEs is actually really, really simple. It's the number of occurrences. So you get to take advantage of a generally persistent thing called variance risk premiums. Again, this is how I trade them. Let me take a step back. This is completely the way I think about them. Other people might try to trade zero DTEs directionally and shit like that. That's not what I do. When I'm trading zero DTEs, I'm trying to trade this persistence, the persistence of variance risk premiums over realize volatility. So that's just where implied volatility trends over historic volatility. And it's generally persistent. It's not always there. Right. So in this case, you can see this actual this seven day variance risk premium, this really short term variance risk premium is actually negative. It's not great. But conversely, if we take a look at let me grab my flexible grid and let me do my monitoring group, which this one here tracks daily. If I move this out and then let's do like five days, five minutes, you'll see on these shorter term time frames, it's very, very often the case that variance risk premium is going to be present. But it's a system that works out in the aggregate. It's not like a really clean, smooth style system. It's very, very specific and it requires essentially a regular exposure to it. So that's the reason why I like them. Now again, whether or not they make sense or whatever, that's all completely dependent on the individual trader and what you're trying to accomplish. But for me, they fit a really important part of my book, which is non correlated returns. I see non correlated returns here. John says, if you are directional, how do you determine longer short at the open? It's not what I do. So what you can do for something like directional trading, again, for something like that, you one of the most common ways to trade directionally interdays using something called an opening range breakout. That is a very, very common day trading tool specifically for stock traders. And it genuinely is pretty high efficacy. So I think in general, I kind of like that. But again, it's just different than what I do personally. I realize I have to like rename these because they're all out of order, which bothers me. So the sectors needs to get renamed. We'll save this as B. Does that make sense? James says it seems like spy has that v pattern meaning open and closer. Yeah. Well, because what you're noticing is that in general, you're going to see liquidity at the beginning of the day when overnight orders are clearing out. And then you're going to see liquidity at the end of the day. Again, when orders are clearing out. So that's that's like precisely why you see that. So I think I would look at that. And for me, it's part of the reason why I trade when I do. Brad says, how does IV crush work or changes in IV and what causes it? Fantastic question. I love this. Importantly, if I buy an option for a few weeks out in low price, how can this affect me? How can you manage the headwind at all? It's a fantastic question. So the way to think about implied volatility is that it's obviously non static and it's going to be relative to specific timeframes. So the first thing we have to identify is, for example, notice how I have progressive up. We can look at whatever, but this just happens to be progressive. Notice how for the 20 September expiration, the volatility is 22.93. Then for the next expiration, 18 on it's 26.15. Then for 15 noves, 25.13, so on and so forth. What I'm highlighting to you is that there are different volatilities for different explorations. So over the life of an option, as volatility moves and the primary drivers of volatility moving, it's implied. It's forward looking. So it's in act, it signifies a change in the expected forward movement of an underlying. That's really what it means. So if implied volatility expands, it means the market thinks for whatever reason that over that reference time frame, again, whether it's 21 days, 49 days, 77 days depending on the time frame, normally when we're quoting implied volatility, it's for 30 days. So when we see like this quoted IV, it's 30 days and then we annualize it. So, but it can be for other periods. I just want you to be aware of that. So generally speaking over the next, if we're just quoting the IV for the underlying itself, that's normally going to be 30 day vol. And if it goes up, it just means we expect the underlying to move more over the next 30 day period for what reasons completely dependent on the stock. So sometimes it'll be that there's new news that's come out and we think for whatever reason that the stock is now going to be more mobile. So a great example of this is if I grab Starbucks and we take a look at when it added it's the new CEO, we started seeing short term implied volatility, which is kind of like this straw colored lighter yellow was coming up. It was moving up and then it started coming back down. And then if we look at CMG, we can see that both period vols started moving up. This is one they replaced the CEO. They took from CMG over to Starbucks. So this is the market's perception of volatility changing. So this is how your options valuable change due to volatility. Now, really common periods that vol will expand is starting two weeks out from an earnings release. That's the first period where you will see. Vol starting to expand. And again, the reason for that is because over that release, we tend to expect volatility to increase because we're coming into what we would call a binary event. We don't fully know what's going to happen. We're not sure. So then we're essentially positioning ourselves for the unknown. That's precisely why you'll see that happen. So then once we go through that perceived volatile event again for whatever it was, then there will come a point where we know what happens, right? We're at the point where we get through the volatility event. We understand what happens because whatever happened happened, we can observe it. Then volatility typically will contract because again, we now know what happened. So that's why you'll see volatility move in a nutshell. It's literally just the perception of forward price deviation. That's all. So Brad, let me know if that answers your question. It was a really, really good question. Reese says, just to clarify, I had to pay above intrinsic value to close a short call that expired today. Is that where your DTE traders make money or is that market maker thing? You'd have to explain the trade to me because yeah, I don't fully follow what happened there. John says expected to move which way? We don't know. That's one of the notes is when we're looking at implied volatility, it's not necessarily direction specific. It's a comb, right? So if I take a look at CMG and I look at a probability analysis, this comb is projected using the implied volatility in this case, 32.86%. But you'll notice that it's deviation off of the spot price up or down. Can go up that amount. Can go down that amount. And again, this is just within a one standard deviation move. If I open this up to a three standard deviation move, you'll notice that these numbers move much, much, much further out because it needs to encompass a much wider range. If we're going to hit it within a three standard deviation, confidence interval. So that's that. Doctors, they said so a strangle could be a good strategy for earnings betting on price movement without having to pick a side. If you're talking about the expansion of volatility, I prefer straddles, but a strangle can work just fine. And if you're talking about the contraction for earnings, I tend to use either strangles or straddles on the short side. So this Dr. Zeyes, this is specifically for you. The link I just dropped in there is a video about trading earnings with options for this this literal exact purpose. Because trading earnings with options is one of the few sources of what we would call structural alpha, which is a really, really important concept for when we're looking at the performance of a system. If it has some sort of persistent edge, which that absolutely does. So yeah, that video will go into detail. Wiggly warm, what up? Good to see you. All right, let me see. I just want to get caught up on the chat. Okay, it looks like I'm all good. Carlos says, how does this guy always drop these links so fast? Oh, you have a question here's like, yeah, it's because I spent a lot of time like building a series of, I call them reference videos. The funny part about my reference videos is that they do terribly. They really perform very, very bad in terms of like video performance for YouTube. But I genuinely think that they're typically really good information. So I make them anyways. A quick admin note, I need to go grab some Advil before my hernated disc blows out. I'll be back in like 30 seconds. All right, how did I do one time? I feel like, I feel like that was pretty quick. I think it was less than 30 seconds. My, yeah, my bathroom, like the master bathroom is not far away from the office. So in this case, we're going to go with some Advil twos, which is a mix of ibuprofen and a set of metafine. And yeah, these are now part of my daily routine. It's super fun. Highly recommend it. Kidding, don't, don't recommend it at all. I'd never take this kind of stuff. But it is what it is. Gotta get through the injury. So here we go. Biggie says 24 seconds. I feel like that was pretty good. He says I could hear your back wrinkle with every step. That's probably my ankle actually. My, my back doesn't hurt at all. But it's just all the sciatical bullshit. Now, funny enough, though, my ankle does crack all the time. And that doesn't hurt either. I don't get it. All right. Enough about me because nobody cares. Let's look at a couple other things. So first thing, we already talked about this one. Let me pull that down. And BW says I care you to man. Thank you, BW. Jotato says, Rogan says, do decompression for back paint. Yeah. So funny enough, I actually bought an inversion. I don't know if it's called an inversion chair table. I guess maybe a table. It's literally my office right here. So I've been hopping on there to help it out. I just essentially just takes time. Perneated discs, I believe. Well, again, this is like the longest injury I've ever had. It typically does not take this long for me to heal. So that's just how she goes. All right. So the other thing I want to show you, though, are a couple posts for us to work through. From Reddit, I'll grab these in a second. It looks like there's a question here. Wigglyworm says, when first upside down stream, I 100% would do it. I don't know how to stream from my phone. I've never done it before. I've always done it from like the computer like this, but I think that would be hilarious. I also used to do a bunch of series called car chats. I really, really enjoyed those where I would go drive around whether it's in like, well, it used to be the Corvette before I turned it into the monster that it is. It's just way too loud now. The running joke is the reason why I bought them a clarin is because the Corvette just got too loud to do car chats in. That's the joke. But I can always do like the car chats. I think a live stream during that would be impossible because obviously the whole reason why I like to do live streams is to monitor the chat and interact with you. Well, it's super, super engaging from it. It's very fun. That's why normally if the chat is like busy and vibrant, I'll sit here for two hours happily. If it's quieter, I'll normally wrap up a little bit faster. It's just because I kind of vibe off of you guys. So the upside down thing I think would be hilarious at some point. But yeah, probably wouldn't be able to last too long unfortunately. I'm trying to put on this fucking thing. There it goes. Like this 10s unit. James says take BPC 157 for your back. If I was going to take anything for it, honestly, I would do either. I wouldn't take BPC 157. It's kind of less good. I would either just go with stem cells. If I was going to do it, or I would do a steroid injection. Those would be kind of like the two choices that I would make. But I wouldn't bother with BPC 157. BPC 157 is cool, but it really does pale in comparison to something like stem cells. But I'm trying to just go the natural route and keep it as minimally invasive as humanly possible for the time being is the idea. H says take Fent for your back. I actually guess if I went back up to Vancouver for another podcast, I could grab some of that because yeah, it's that seems to be pretty much around everywhere. Suppose Carson's tumor totally safe. Yeah, I actually take a bunch of supplements every day. From the physical side, I'm fascinated with human performance. I'm not like any sort of crazy good athlete, but I've been athletic my whole life. I still am now, even though I'm broken. I'm still going to the gym and stuff, but I still train martial arts and all that kind of stuff. Anyways, I tinker with supplements. I tinker with recovery methods when we actually build our house. That's one of the goals. I still think we're looking at Colorado. When I build my house there, I literally have plans for like an entire recovery room because we have like the cold plunge here, the hot tub. I want to get a barrel song. I like all this kind of shit. I really am fascinated by human performance. So yeah, that's the that's the idea. All right. Let me go back up to Brad had a question. Okay, I see your question. Okay, and I see Alfonso. All right, let me grab Alfonso question quick. Alfonso says I saw very interesting earnings play this week two days before earnings. Someone sold 11,700 far out of the money puts and bought 11,700 calls after earnings stock increased 40% smells fishy. Yeah, I agree with you. I do. I completely agree with you. Alfonso what was the ticker that that was in we can take a look at it. That to me sounds like insider trading if I'm if I'm being honest. And the cool part about the cool part about options is that it's kind of like the go to for insider trading because it's leveraged. So they make more money. So they're taking the risk of trading on insider information. Why would they not go to options and gain the leverage? It's just logical. So you can use that's why we track unusual options activity because informed traders use derivatives because they're leveraged. It literally just makes sense. So my guess is that's exactly what you're seeing. And in case you're wondering what we're doing for beverages, we still got the mango orange. I just got a giant refill of them. So I'm treating myself and we're doubling it up. That's what we got for the spin drips. These are so good. Big big fan. So yeah, AFRM. My guess is that's probably a smaller stock too, right? Yeah, it is. What's the market cap on this? Yes, so this is a generally small. Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is what you saw is literally quintessential of insider trading. Let's take a look. Let's go in here and then look at AFRM. And then when was its earnings? On the 28th? Let's do like 26 to the 27th. So these are people that these guys sold calls. Let me look. So on the call side, you said you saw 1700. Yeah, so these. See, this is interesting though, because this is kind of like a bit of a shotgun to be completely honest with you like these ones, because I see a bunch of calls coming in at the bid. And then I also see them coming in at the offer. So that's generally a mixed bag. Brad says that AFRM trade out actually based on TA said big move coming. I must play it. Yeah. Well, I mean, from a TA perspective, it, I mean, this kind of upward momentum budding up against this kind of resistance. That's not necessarily going to lead to a big move. What led to a big move was good earnings after the market. If it didn't have good earnings, this thing wouldn't have done this. So I would just attribute the the movement is accurately as we can. And it's not because of like some prior setup necessarily in terms of like the chart. It's because of this event. It's because it had a good earnings. So it was estimated that negative 44 eight cents in a came in at negative 14. So it's a massive, massive, massive earnings beat. So yeah, I would use for me, I would use options positioning as kind of like the guiding force. Let me see if we can look at them. I don't know if this will let us go back. This early, oh, it does. That's great. So we can go back to the 27th because it was after the close on the 27th. I think, is that right? I think so. And let's see what the options look like. I'll fast forward this to like 0.9 something like that. Get a little later in the day. And let's take a look at the options. Because yeah, I mean, obviously I'm a proponent of technical analysis. I believe a lot in it. But I also think it's really, really important to try and identify price behavior and attribute it to the actual things that are moving price. So in this case, it was earnings. It was a binary event that easily can go either way. So we know that that's not right. So it did head call skew, which makes a lot of sense. So let's take a look in the front expiration. Yeah, I mean, it had moderate call skew, 38,000 against 20,000, almost two to one. So that's a lot of people playing the upside. And then if we take a look on the 27th, let me see. And doctors, they is kind of interesting that a company composed the negative EPS. But if it's a beat, then the price goes up anyway. I think I'm going to make a video actually. This is such a great point. Let me, I'm literally going to outline a thing. I'm going to, I'm going to make a video called like how to interpret earnings or how to trade earnings as an options trader or some shit like that. I'll obviously have to award Smith a little bit and become super hyperbolic. Maybe the name of the video needs to be something like how to make $10,000,000 daily on a $5,000 account trading options in earnings. Maybe that's the, maybe that's the right path. But I'm going to leave myself a reminder here. And it will be like how to interpret or maybe how to trade earnings with options, something like that. I just got to leave this as like a placeholder. And then obviously I have to work on the hyperbally, you know, how to trade earnings with options and make $60 trillion with no money down and no effort. Maybe that's a good one. But anyways, let's take a look at these transactions. The first thing I want to do is I want to see people that are buying just calls. Yeah, like that. Somebody buying the 35s. And then let's see people that are selling puts. Pretty small. So there's not this insane call skew coming through. There's definitely heavy calls for sure, but it's not necessarily insane. But in this front expiration, it's almost 2 to 1, which again, like when you see these kinds of trades or this kind of setup pre earnings, to me, that typically indicates a fairly bullish configuration. And it's especially in these smaller companies. It's very, very common due to insiders knowing something's coming. H says how to make $50 a day in your boxers trading earnings. There we go. That right there apparently is the title I needed. So I think that's the, I think that's the right right move. Reece says, been tinkering, but haven't figured out how to have volume displayed horizontal in the chart. That's just volume profile. Dr. Zayas, you have to capitalize certain words. Oh, I was just going to capitalize all of them. Maybe like make it seem like I'm screaming or something like that. Oh, I see. You got to make it slightly believable. My bad. I'm going to have to hire all of you as kind of my content consultants so that we can actually grow the channel instead of, you know, me just making videos that drop into the ether. Love chatting with you guys. But, you know, also trying to grow this fucking thing, which is it was actually funny. I was talking with my best friend Joe. He was on the channel a while in the beginning. Like he and I would do like conversations together. But he was just like, how's it? You know, he always asked me about the channel and stuff. And I was told I'm like, it's growing, but it's growing slow. And he always tells me he's just like, that's the problem with principles. And he's not wrong. Like there is, it was so easy to, to like, really grow this thing, I think, if I didn't have principles, but I do have principles, unfortunately, I suppose. Oh. All right. Carlos says you just have to put Jimmy and video in all your titles. Yeah. I try to, I try to be specific with what I'm doing on the titles and stuff. I typically make content the way that I would want to consume it, which is again, not great from a growth perspective. But all right. So let's take a look at this. What do you guys think about this? Do I lose money rolling my options? How does this work? What do you guys think about that? Michael says I'm here because you have principles. Honestly, that's exactly right to be clear. I find that the audience that tends to find their way into my content or the like, you guys are my people, right? Like you're the exact kind of people I want to be around. I don't like being around the people that that other content tends to bring. So I joke about it because it's like playing the game on hard mode. But again, I maintain the principles because I wouldn't, I wouldn't change it. Ben says, so whether you lose money or not is not the framing of the transactions. Yep. Yep. So this, Jotatus had probably a fee for rolling options there is, but that's not why they lose money. It's a good quiet or it's a good guess, but that's not exactly why. Reese says if you pay more to close to receive, it's a loss. If you then open a new option contract, that's exactly it. That's exactly correct. So Reese gets another plus fake one internet point. A big A says, is it a trick question? No, it's not a trick question. The simple answer is absolutely. So here's a video called a Comprehensive Guide to Rolling Options. Here's a video is Rolling Options Masterclass. And here's a video Rolling Options explained and why most people get it wrong. That last one goes into detail on the math, which we will gloss over quickly here. And as you can see, I did make a comment here. This person said a loss only if rolled for a debit. Rolling for a net credit can increase the possible profit and lower the max loss. This is not wrong. This is wrong. This is unequivocally wrong. It's not in opinion. It's not, it is 100% wrong. And you can see my response here. So the response I gave to this person, I just found one of them, and I responded. I say this is objectively wrong. And likely due to a common trait of traders, which is known as loss aversion. It's where we hate losing so much that we play all these different mental gymnastics to avoid reconciling that we've taken a loss. That's what loss aversion is. We do not like taking losing traits. Now a quick dovetail off of loss aversion is the sooner as a trader, you can get over the fact of being wrong. You are unlocked. It's like unshackling yourself because we as people tend to assign our self worth our effort directly to the outcome of an individual thing. And we forget that specifically something like trading is a process driven thing. So the outcome of any one individual thing does not really fucking matter. What matters is the long term outcome. So that means today I got stopped out on my zero DTEs. I got I got kicked out for a loss. So does that mean I'm not going to trade zero DTEs? No, of course I am. I traded them yesterday. I'm going to trade them on Monday. Do I feel like a piece of shatter that all my research was wasted? Absolutely not. It's because I know losing is part of trading. And as soon as you break that thing in your mind, you decouple those where every trade is this emotional loss. Damn, y'all. I didn't realize that you guys are going to have to do me dirty like that. I was sitting here hoping about, did you not hear that monologue I was on? I was crushing it I feel like. And then you guys just have to drop me over the head with the fucking market being closed Monday. Y'all just did me so dirty. Damn it. Well, I guess I'm not trading Monday. This is horseshit. But yeah, the broader point is I don't associate the outcome like the outcome of each individual trade with my identity. And I think the sooner you can overcome that as a trader, the better off you're going to be. So this person here, I can guarantee you has lost a version. I can guarantee it by this answer. Because the only reason why you would answer this way is if you have a problem with losing trades and don't want to acknowledge that there's a losing trade. Why? Because this is what a role is. A role is when we open a trade. We then close the trade. We open another trade and tie the accounting together. That new trade doesn't undo whatever the PNL was in that first trade. And I'll use an example right now to walk you through what this looks like. Again, we'll get the handy dandy notebook. Maybe I'll just leave this open instead of continuing to close it. I thought we were done with the notebook, but apparently not. So first though, before I go further into this, does that make sense? Like the concept I just laid out in terms of what a role is and why that position is just objectively false? Let me grab this. James says that's right. You lose, but it's hidden. That's the funny part, though. It's not hidden. It's literally right in your face. It's just that we don't like acknowledging it. Actually, even better scenario. Never mind. Change my mind entirely. I'm not going to use this. What I'm going to do is use on demand and we'll work through an example together. So let's find something that we know will lose. So let's find something. This would be great. This has gone down. How are the options in here? Does it have okay options? Yeah, this is fine. We'll literally use this. So what we're going to do is sell a put on the 15th. And then we're going to fast forward to the first 15th to the first. That's fine. So we're going to come here on the 15th. And we're going to sell a put. Alfonso says grandma was divorced five times. And when she was about to marry the six guys, she says, I'm going to keep trying to like get it right. Sounds like rolling. Yeah, honestly, your grandma was rolling her husbands. I think that that's a completely legitimate way to think about it. Actually, and what I'll do is instead of this, let me grab a calculator that I like to use. It's going to break. But I think we'll be able to work it. All right. So I have a calculator over in an Excel sheet off to the side just to try to make this a little easier to follow along. I'm clearing out some old stuff from it. And then I'll pull part of it over for you to see. Okay. So the date for today technically is 15 July 24 in this alternate universe. And then we're going to sell a put. We're going to sell a put for 16 aug. So we'll go to 16 aug, which gives us 32 DTE. The stock price at this point is 3167. And we're just going to do a one lot. And let's sell this at the money 30. So the strike price here is going to be 30. And then the premium that we're going to get is $1.53. Are we Gucci so far on the scenario? And again, four oh no, this is all shifted. This is terrible. I guess that's okay. Yeah, I guess this is all right. Okay. This is makes sense so far though, like what we've done up into this. Essentially, here is, let me zoom this in. Okay, Reese is following me. Good. I needed some confirmation to make sure that this isn't like all just ether stuff to you. So here's what we have so far. Essentially, we have, it's not AMD. It's AFRM. It's whatever. It doesn't matter. So in this case, we sold this option. So in this case, our net credit, here's the $1.53. Return on invested capital is 5.1%. In order to cash secure this position, we need three Gs. Based expiration 32 PNL is 153 bucks. Sick. So then let me launch this off. Let's see if the platform will take it. Boom, we got a fill. Great. Great news. Great news for all of us. There's our trade. Great. Cool. So now let's fast forward. And I said that we go to the first of August. Now again, this is the cool part about using something like on demand is because I can go back in time. I can identify a period that I'm interested in testing something. And I can cherry pick, which is exactly what we did. We cherry picked a period that we know AFRM is going to go down so that we can analyze this psychology of rolling and why so many people just completely, completely dork it up because we're uncomfortable with losing trades. It's literally one of the worst possible things you can come across as a trader are traders that have a problem with losing trades. It's so egotistical. All right. Big A says, can you close the news and make the options bigger? I can't because it's not going to zoom in on this. I don't know how to the only thing I could do is shrink the part of the screen. But then I would have to change it every time that I'm in here. So I'll just read it to you. Although as I can't zoom it in enough, I don't think. Yeah, because that doesn't when I do that, it doesn't zoom it in. This doesn't help us. So anyways, now my options are trading for $3.45. So let's talk about this role. Let's say that I'm going to choose to roll here. Well, by coming here, I'm going to pay negative $3.45. So what? What has just happened? The very first part of this role is this. I had this open trade that I collected $153. I then closed this open trade for $3.45. I now realized a loss of $345. So my aggregate realized loss here, which you can see, is $192. This is a realized trade that was open. It is now closed. This trade is done. Now, the next part of a role is we look at, let's say we wanted a roll out here. And you can't even get out of the money. Let's just pretend that we could roll this out the 50 days from 15, go to 50. And let's just pretend that I was able to get $3.50. I'm just pretending here. It's not the scenario, but let's just pretend. Then now, let's say the date is 1.ogg24. We're going to look at an expiration that's 27. The stock price now is at 27.03. I'm still going to use this one lot. My strike, again, in this hypothetical scenario that isn't true, I was able to move from a 30 to a 25, meaning I improved my basis by 16 points. And now, let's say that I was able to collect a credit of $3.50. Here is the new trade. This new trade gives me the ability and the opportunity to make enough money in order to overwhelm the loss of this trade. But it does not change the fact that the first step in this process of a role is realizing a losing trade. And again, there's nothing wrong with realizing the losing trade. It's okay. What's not okay is playing mental gymnastics because you don't want to acknowledge losing a trade. That's dangerous. That does not help you in trading. So for this person's response, do I lose money rolling options? It depends. It's not a guaranteed yes. That's another really common misconception. And this is the part that we need to hone in on that. The reason why it depends is because James says, but you are still in the money. So you're already losing that trade too. Not necessarily. You can't look at it that way. And I'll explain to you why. Just because you're in the money, doesn't mean that the trade is losing. And I'll explain why in a second. The previous point I was making though is that if you close a trade that's winning, well, then you realize again. You've made money. So for example, if we modify this example here, and if we modify this example instead of us closing at 345, let's just pretend that we closed it at a dollar. You've realized a profit, right? So you can realize a profit when you roll a trade. Now to James, to your point about being still in the money and already losing on the trade, that's not what I would focus on for two reasons. Oh, see if you keep up with it. One of the reasons is because do you see this calculation here called adjusted net credit? That's what a DJ means adjusted and CNET credit. So these calculations important. The reason why this calculation is important is because it tells me what value I need the option to be in order to hit break even. So for example, I needed to hit 158. I just do the math. So here, if I close this at $1.58, oops, messed that up. My bad. Minus $1.58. You'll see that it zeros me out. That the aggregate P and L at this point is now at break even. So I just calculate whatever the adjusted net credit is. So now James, back to your point. If I sell this option, whether it's in the money or out of the money, doesn't inherently matter up front, as long as eventually it hits my adjusted net credit, at which point I would be at a break even. So I wouldn't attach it to the moneyness is the broader point there. I would attach it simply to the value of the option and what you need the value of the option to hit in order for it to be a viable trade. Let me know if that makes sense. Alfonso says, how many times did Gil roll GME call options between June 2019 and April 2021 not always a loss? Yeah, and that's the thing is I don't even I'm not sure that he was selling calls against his shit. Like I have no idea what he was doing because I have no record of that. When I'm looking at somebody like the cat, the best thing I can do is review what he's posted on Reddit on his page and come up with the best estimations I can for his style of trading. But damn it. I have this little cable keeper that's dropping cables all over the place. One second. I need my cable keeper to keep it together. So yeah, I just I don't know what he did over those periods. So I can't I have no idea the answer to that one. Rude a bag of what up gets us you. All right. So that's one example. Let's take a look as another example. Here. I haven't read this yet. So we'll read it together. Wigglyworm says, is it accurate to say rolling is a method of extending a single trade into a series of trades and adjusting your break even point? Yeah, I think it's fair. That's okay. That's no problem. James says it does. But if you were rolling, it's likely already close to break even if it goes in favor. Yes, not necessarily close to break even. Again, I wouldn't attach that to it either personally. I think it's partially accurate, but it's not inherently accurate. Again, I would just try to keep it on more more representative basis, which means kind of reflecting exactly what it is. Because if you're rolling, it doesn't inherently mean you're close to break even away from break even. It could be any of them. There's no inherent relationship with a role in break even. It's completely situation dependent. So I would just let it be situation dependent. I wouldn't try to come up with like a rule of thumb for it. Let's take a look at this person. Again, I haven't read this yet. It says, I'm day trading spy and previously thought creating a stop loss at 30% of my trade was a sensible risk. However, I'm often removing my stop loss with the conviction of being directly correct and exposing myself. Often I'm correct, but when I'm not, my account is long. Do I need to give my trades extra breathing room 40% usually my trades are correct roughly 80% of the time and my upside is often 40% or more. What do you guys think of this? How would we? How would we think? What strategy? That's a great starting question. We don't know. We just know some of the metrics of their strategy, but we don't know what it is. It doesn't say the strategy, I guess, is the is the annoying part. There's nothing to read. Reese says need the win rate and average win and loss. You're going down the right path here. This is the exact right path. Build on that a little bit more, Reese. Expectancy. Yeah, that's exactly it. So, I have a video that video is called maximize gain risk management for options trading. And the whole point of that is to walk you through the way I think about sizing risk and trades and managing risk and trades. Because here's the deal. Whether or not this stop makes sense completely depends on what they're telling us. And what I can tell you is they're not they're not telling us something. Because if they're right 80% of the time with an average upside of a 40% return or more. And that obviously means that they're only losing 20% of the trades, right? You can inference through it. So then the required loss on those trades would be absolutely massive in order for this to happen. So then to me, if they're telling me I'm winning 80% of the time. And then, you know, we're essentially adjusting off of this. To me, the solution here's really simple. I would focus on this thing. I like to call cutting the tails. And the reason why I think about cutting the tails is because it's a simple way for this person to strike a balance. Let me see if I have a video on this. I don't remember the see normal error. Remember the names or at least like associated keywords with the videos, which is how I'm able to look them up so fast. But sometimes I'm not. It might be this one. Yeah, I think it's that one. Oh no, it's this one. That's a lie. I found it. Here we go. So that's the video. Let me see. I need to change this title so I can find it. So I just literally changed the title of that video so I can find it faster next time for us. But that video, it's about cutting the tails. That's what I would do here. So the way I would think about this, if I were this trader is that I wouldn't inherently know if I need to give them more breathing room, because if I'm telling myself that if I give myself a 40% potential drawdown, and I maintain an 80% win rate, that's 40% or more, right? Just do the math. If the loss, the stop loss is as large as your average win, but you're winning 80% of the time. That's a positively expected strategy. So this is totally cool. This I think is terrible advice. I think don't use the stop is again, silly, because then what's the exit at some point? Like we need to define an exit whether they want to use the stop or arresting stop mental stop, whatever, it doesn't matter. But we do need to have some idea of what we're going to exit the trade. So I actually don't agree with this at all. So yeah, anyways, I thought that this was another interesting case study. I have a couple more. If we want to run through those, unless if you have any specific questions, now is the perfect time to start throwing those in and we'll take a look. Ricky says, I would think that if he's profitable and outperforming spy, then just keep doing what you're doing. Yeah, I think that that's a really fair, fair way to think about it. Oh, that's a tough name. Oh, shit, that's a really tough name. Ajie, Ajigoo. I don't know if it's goo, Ajigoo. Let me know how close that is. I feel like that's pretty accurate. Ajigoo. That's exactly my problem. I keep getting stopped out and then it goes in my direction. Yeah. So then you just need to watch that latest video that I sent you called cutting the tails. It's literally about that exact thing. I think that should walk you through a little bit of it. James says, if directional strategy needs to go your way very quickly, your stop loss will already be heartburn on your DTEs. Well, it depends on how much room you give the trade, but the name of the game there is just making sure that it has positive expected return. That's that's really what it boils down to. Wiggly Worm says, do you have a playlist made for what? I have a play, I have a ton of playlists. If you go to the YouTube channel here, I guess if I say if you go to the YouTube channel, it's kind of dumb because you're on the YouTube channel. Oh, this is kind of fun. I've never actually looked for my own shit. Look at us go. Hey, this view is cool. Literally never look at this. So if you pop in here, and then you go to playlists, I got a bunch of playlists, man. And the reason why I make all these different playlists is ideally, hopefully, to make it a little easier to find things. So yeah, the stuff that I think you're generally looking for, if I think it puts them down here, it's kind of annoying that it does it all this shit so out of order. How do you order these? This is terrible. I literally have them ordered how I want them. Why does it do this? Here we go. I guess you just have to use this one because I put these in, I put these in a specific order that I think makes sense. Right? So you can go. Yeah, okay, this is what we're looking for. This part down here. I don't know why the playlist tab is so like, this is terrible. You can't find shit. I don't know why they would do this. It'd be very, very frustrating to find just about anything here. This like, but yeah, anyways, outside of that, I think it looks decent. And that's essentially the way that I would work through this. So from the home tab, it goes just standard videos, the popular videos. These are kind of like the best, so to speak. So I would start with either this or this depending on where you're at in your trading path. And then I would just kind of work through these in line with one another. So when you get down here, this is where we start getting into like specific strategies. We start talking about more speculative style trades, stuff like that. So I actually think I need to add this, this. Yeah, so I need to add zero DTEs in here. Like that. So slight modification to that. That's a little more updated for you. But yeah, that's essentially where I would go through for the for the playlists. H says, oh God, FFI not judging by any means, but I think it's interesting for a different reason. Oh, you're responding to a faunza. All right, let me get back up here. So H says, have you tried logging? I think you you were meaning lagging into strangles. How do you go about it to maximize the juice on each side? I don't typically lag into them. Now, big A says, your face on the thumbnails is lower in the view count. I literally couldn't agree more like 100%. I probably just need to find like a really hot chicken like a bikini. And then that would actually be hilarious. If it's this really hot chicken, a bikini, and then you turn on the video and it's my my face, like I feel like that would just straight up be horrific for people, which is again, hilarious to me. But yeah, I completely agree with you. Big A's. All right, so let me go back though to H. And for H for your first question about strangles, I don't typically lag in. I'll just essentially take the trade that I want. Now, I sometimes will modify the legs as it's moving, but beyond that, I don't really bother trying to lag in a whole bunch or stuff like that. It's just not really my go to. So for your second question about have you played with poor man covered calls? I don't like those personally, but I have a better variation by far that's called a coverage strain or not a coverage triangle. Sorry, ratio diagonal. So that first playlist is about different strategies that I use. And then the second link is a specific playlist about ratio diagonals. And there's actually another video coming out actually tomorrow about ratio diagonals, because it is one of my hands down go to strategies for pretty much any directional style trading. The video coming out tomorrow is literally 40 minutes long. So I go through an example in depth. I go through how I track them, how I find them, how I manage them, like pretty much everything is is in there. So yeah, that's essentially what I run instead of poor man's covered calls. I don't like those. Wigglyorm says I would watch the shed out of beginners playlist by you. I have that. Yeah. So if you haven't seen it, let me grab my playlist. And I have two of them. So this one this is for you Wigglyworm. So that one is options basics for beginners 101. And then this other video is like investing in trading 101. So the second video I just dropped is more broad about like trading in general. And then that first video that I dropped is very specific to options trading for beginners. So yeah, there's a ton of stuff in there. And I actually just redid not too long ago my options 101 video. And like it's like an hour and 40 minutes long or some shit that I literally just shot all the way through just straight through. But the editor that I had previously that was helping me with that stuff, he unfortunately got hit by a fucking typhoon. So that is essentially dead in the water. I'm just now hiring another editor to help with some of these. So hopefully that new options 101 video can come out at least in the not so distant future. But I mean realistically, there's nothing special about the way I think about options 101. I don't think I think if you go through like investipedia or through your broker, either of those would be completely fine. Ricky, that is a fucking epic comment. Ricky says typhoon equals puts on editor. My god, that's unbelievable. That's unbelievable. All right, next one. There's another, there's another post that I haven't read yet. Oh yeah, wait, let me see if I got through the questions up here. I don't think I did. Okay, Afonso says, how would I know when premiums are too high before putting on a trade? I just closed several FFI e positions this week made money, but not what I was expecting considering the nose dive since I entered. I wouldn't worry about the premiums before you put on a trade because they're relative to whatever the underlying is in its cycle. So if we look at FFI e for your example, and we have to zoom in because it's so crushed. And let's just say that we wanted to start buying options or whatever. Like it doesn't matter what the premium is. The premiums going to be relative to where it is in price. So for example, if you buy when it's trading at 1052, the premiums are going to be higher. If you bought it when it was 267, the premiums are going to be lower. Now there's a slight deviation if we're looking, including implied volatility. And I don't like buying implied volatility when it's a grigously high kind of like it is in here 276%. That's like really, really high. And the IV percentile is only 22% though. So it means that it still has plenty of room to expand in terms of volatility. So even when I'm looking at volatility as an input, I just don't like buying it when they implied volatility percentile. And for those that don't know, this isn't actually implied volatility percentile. This is actually implied volatility rank. They have it mislabeled. They're completely different calculations. That part aside, this being implied volatility rank, I prefer implied volatility percentile by the way. But this is just what they have because my calculation is not working for whatever reason. So if you're wondering though about the difference between IV rank implied volatility percentile, there's a video for you. And really what I'm doing here is seeing like how expensive the options are relative to themselves. But it doesn't matter that much because even if you buy an option that has a 100% implied volatility rank as it sits here, if it goes up, you still make money. It still will make money if it goes up. And if it goes down, you will still lose money. Now the reason why it starts to matter is because if you buy something with a really high implied volatility rank and then volatility starts contracting and nothing else is happening, then you'll start losing money a little bit faster because of the other factors that are decreasing the value of those options. So it's kind of relative. But I wouldn't obsess so much over the overall premium. I would view the premium as like a down payment. And it's not something that we're buying hopefully to just let go and hope something happens. It's part of a system that's going to be managed either way. So when we're buying options, we're trying to trade something directionally. So the name of the game there is doing our best to be directionally correct. So if you buy something that's expensive in your directionally correct, you're still going to make money. Uh, uh, uh, let me see. Brad says you use the term someone is building a position. I understand the term build out a position. But is there an advantage to building out over time as as opposed to buying strikes all at once? Definitely. So Brad, for your question, it depends entirely on the strategy. But so for example, if I'm trading something like the coverage strangle, leaving enough room to scale into a trade over time is really, really important to that strategy. Same thing if I'm trading a more thematic position in something like T triple cues. Being able to scale into this during down moves is really, really important because if you're trying to hold something longer term and you don't do that, then as something like this goes from 85 down to 49 and let's say that you didn't dollar cost average into it, scale into it, then you still haven't gotten back to break even. It still would need to essentially get all the way back up here and it's not there yet. If you get in here with maybe 50% of your capital and then each subsequent 10% drop you add to it, that will lower your break even point over time by dollar cost averaging in. So then as it gets up here, you're probably actually making some money at this point. So depending on what you're trading in the kind of products, the process of scaling into and out of things is actually really, really important. Now, what I would say is you have to take a really careful look at the profit mechanism because for example, let's find something that is showing specific behavior. I got to run a quick scan. So work with me here. Yeah, this is fine. No, this is not fine. We need options. On this again. So I'm looking for a specific condition to show you. There. So let's say in this case that you want to trade a breakout style strategy. And let's say that you noticed that this thing's been range bound from essentially, you know, 70 bucks down to 54. It's just kind of been oscillating in this range. And let's say for whatever reason, I don't know why it broke out here. Obviously, some sort of reason. But let's say that as it broke above this level, let me draw a price. As it broke above this level, you want to start buying it. So then close to the open, you want to start putting a position on. Well, if you're too gun shy and let's say you have a 100% total allocation, but you only put on 20% of your position upfront. Well, if you get your move, you don't make the money. Now, this is for a specific style of trading. This is for break out or break down style positions. So if you're trading another kind of position, then it's not relegated to this. But that's why it's highly dependent on what you're trading, what strategy you're trading, whether or not scaling in or out makes sense. And to what degree it makes sense. So it's got to start with the profit mechanism. And then it's got to rotate over into whatever strategy you're using. That's how I would think about it personally. And then the next question is from H. And H says, do you tend to like buying puts or selling calls more? I don't have a preference. I don't buy puts a ton by itself. But I do trade the put ratio diagonal. Yeah, I don't really care. It really is more so just what fits whatever I'm trying to trade more. Honestly, like that's the way I look at it. H says, would it be best to short calls for downside exposure when Ive is high and puts when it's low? That's okay. You can do that. Again, to me, that's looking at it wrong. But you can do that. There's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. The reason why I don't like looking at that is because it's like prioritizing a second dairy profit mechanism. You're putting the wrong thing first. So in this case, if we have a scenario that we're trying to play something to the downside, when you're talking about if you're selling calls or buying puts, we're essentially just saying how do we make money to the downside with volatility? That's what that's trying to isolate, which to me is secondary. What's primary is the direction of the product. Again, this is a really common misconception I think by traders that aren't focusing on putting what I call first things first. Let me grab something like this and then let me grab, I gotta update this. We want down days and we don't want the turn day. So we'll get rid of the turn day. We'll clear this out so it can be anything with options. So I'm just looking for some stuff that has had some consecutive down days. And let's look for stuff that looks ugly. Here, this looks good. Well, it looks good, but bad. So AMX, if implied volatility, let's just say here for whatever reason, was really, really high. If implied volatility was super high here, then if I sell a call or buy a put, it's secondary. It's completely secondary. The reason why it's secondary is let's say up here, when it was, when it hit this high and it started rotating down, you're like, okay, well, I want to sell a call or buy a put. I mean, shit, let's look at an example. We need to go back to, let's go here. This is typically when I would do it, is when it starts breaking below this level right there, somewhere in there. So then let's say, probably here is when I would have done it on the 21st, just guessing, again, this is in hindsight, so I can see what happens, but I'm also not purposely perfectly timing it because, again, this is how I know I would trade this. And then I would do an initial stop somewhere there, and then probably the hard stop would go up there, something like that. So let's take a look at an example here. I just need these options to open up for us a little ago. So let's take a look. We can sell a call, and again, these are, it's obviously all bullshit, right, because it's on demand, so it's not giving me realistic prices. We'll literally just fill them in for ourselves. So 35 Delta is probably where I would sell, and let's say you get the mid price of 55 cents. We'll analyze that trade just so that we can reference this price as we move time. And then let's say the other scenario is we go a little further out in time, and then we buy some slightly in the money putts. Let's buy these 20s. And again, let's say that we get them closer to the midpoint, something like 85 cents, and analyze the trade. So at this point, we might be arriving at this conclusion that we want to sell because volatility is super high. Let's just say implied volatility was as high as it gets. Now let's fast forward time a couple weeks. Let's go to the seventh of June. This should come down a bit by then. Okay, come down a lot by then. And just taking a look at my levels, I would have gotten stopped out here on this day if it closed above that. With this kind of really long wick, I would watch it on the day. So this wouldn't, at least based on my typical trend following system, wouldn't stop me out in this scenario. Then this doesn't matter. This doesn't matter. So I essentially would have gotten stopped out. Once it falls below this kind of point of control, I look at the next value area down here. So then this would become the new stop after this day and so on and so forth. So again, this is all armchair quarterbacking, but I'm just kind of talking about the way I typically would follow this kind of thing. So now let's take a look at the analyze tab. So we got into these 21s, these short 21 calls for 55 cents. Let's see what those are running at. So in this case, again, taking the midpoint between 0 and 50 on these 21s, you essentially would be making $25. That's what that would be giving you. Then on these that we originally bought for 85 cents, the midpoint here is $2.83. So essentially you make $200 give or take. So we might be looking at this and say, well, wait, we were supposed to sell when volatility was high. That's a secondary profit factor. It didn't matter that volatility was high because it absolutely crashed. The Delta portion of the movement was so much greater. So this is a scenario going all the way back to H's question about what would be best to short calls for downside when IV is high and puts when it's low. That's not the way I look at it at all. The way I look at it is it depends on the thesis. If my idea is breakdown, aka big down move, I don't care if vol is higher low. I'm going to buy the puts because it gives me a better exposure to the profit mechanism I'm trying to trade. If I'm trading something that's more range bound, then absolutely I might favor a change in volatility in that case sell the calls in order to benefit from a change in volatility. So that is exactly why I would differentiate it that way. The reason why people do that is because it's a tasty trade ism and it's because they tend to have a preference to sell anyways. But a lot of people kind of just lift that and shift it without in my opinion, like fully thinking through the implications of it. And to me, it absolutely comes down simply to what is it that we're trying to trade and what it's it the best. I have a video coming out in a little bit about this idea of matching profit mechanisms because I think it's something a lot of people tend to skip over. H says, do you ever use short shares to sell puts against here about covered calls frequently, not really about the inverse? I don't. For that kind of thing, I would just trade ratio put diagonals. I don't tend to short shares. John says, bad idea to add to a losing position depends on the strategy. I would say for beginners, yes, if you're trading and you don't have a profitable strategy yet and you're starting like you're still figuring it out, I would say essentially don't average down unless your dollar cost averaging into something you're holding long term like an actual investment index ETF, whatever, then that's fine. But if you're adding to a losing position as a new trader, the overwhelming probability is you are going to very likely piss money away by throwing good money after bad. So I would be super, super not willing to do that as a new trader. Once you're a more experienced trader, you understand how you behave the way your brain works the way you do things, then you can explore that gray area a little bit more, I think. So yeah. Alfonso says, you have a different definition of dollar cost averaging than I do. I call that lowering cost basis. Well, Alfonso, that's because I call it again, I call it the accurate thing. Because guess what? A lot of the times that I'm dollar cost averaging, it's up. A lot of times I will scale into things as they're going up, which doesn't decrease my cost basis at all. Right? So that again, that's why I tend to try and use accurate terminology for what I'm doing. Because again, the idea of only buying things when they're going down to me doesn't make sense. So for example, T triple cues, I already talked about this. I gave an example of this trade. I started buying in, I forgot where somewhere in here is some shit and I was buying in it as it was going down, I was buying in as it was going down, down, down, down, down. And then I kept buying here, even after it started going up, I'm still dollar cost averaging into the product. But this is actually raising my basis, but it's starting to move in my favor. So I don't care if I raise my basis if it moves enough in my favor. So yeah, that's why I differentiate there. Alfonso says dollar cost averaging would be as an example, buying 100 dollars of Apple. That's another way you can dollar cost average for sure. You don't, again, dollar cost averaging isn't relegated to being time bound. It's not a time series specific concept. Right, just think of the terms dollar cost averaging is just averaging is buying more. So you can buy more when it's expensive. You can buy more when it's less to your point. You can buy more on a temporal basis based on a certain span of time. You can buy more based on a certain percent change in the underlying. It's not, it's not specific and it's not based off of a time series. Alfonso says they think it is as chat GPT. Like I don't care. Doesn't like, I don't need chat GPT to explain it to me. I know what it is. Because again, like what would you call it then if you bought here, you bought here, you bought here, you bought here. The exact effect is dollar cost averaging. That's exactly what happened. It's not necessarily a fixed time frame. So averaging down, it's not averaging down. If I buy here at 52 63 and I buy here at 54 75, what just happened to my average? My average cost basis went up, not down. It's not averaging down. You could call it averaging up. I'm okay with that. That's what it is. But again, the more the more comprehensive term for both of those scenarios is just dollar cost averaging. Okay, couple more. Recess, can I roll my six internet points into the next stream or were that lock in a loss? That's a great question. I think that we can, I think it'll probably be per stream and kind of track. That's my guess. Dark Mark says, enjoy the channel. New StraightFrode approach. The BJJ is strong with you. I love me some Jets, dog. Can you give me your take on why Robin Hood should be avoided as a trading platform? Any concerns? Yeah, I hate Robin Hood. Everybody in their mother knows that I will take any opportunity to trash Robin Hood. The main reason why I don't like Robin Hood is just because it, for a trader's world, it's not as advantaged as you think. And it's because they hide their costs on the back end and you get worse aggregate fills, which you can track yourself. So I think that's the main reason. Like if I was going to be a trader, I would simply trade and I would focus on good platforms that enable that. I wouldn't necessarily, I wouldn't necessarily bother by trying to decrease every single cost possible because to a degree, you start to get like what you pay for. So yeah, I think I don't like Robin Hood because it's not a robust trading platform. That's the way I would think about it personally. All right, gang, that wraps me up. Wiggly Worm says, in a nutshell, how would you trade? I love that. So Wiggly Worm, you know the funny part about that? I literally, I literally just recorded a video that's called How I Trade Options. And that one comes out on the 7th of September. So the goal that video is hopefully to answer that exact question and kind of give like a general overview of the way that I trade options. It's just hilarious that you ask that question now. All right, gang, I'm out of here. I hope you all have a killer weekend. I will see the apes tomorrow for the GME livestream. I have a couple of things I want to go over specifically. And then we will dive into really whatever else you all help me learn about. That's one of my favorite parts about the sessions tomorrow's. I get to learn a lot myself. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
