0.00s:  What's up, outliers? Happy Friday. It is time. We have our next segment of options trading
10.44s:  for beginners. I'm going to grab the chat so that I can keep up with you all. It looks
15.54s:  like we already got Reese and Sposecar in here. Good to see you both. So the vision for
21.80s:  today is pretty simple. I want to walk through some basic scenarios with you all, hopefully
32.18s:  pulling some of them from you. And the way that I envision this going is ideally we'll
39.50s:  be able to mix some different cases, some from your personal experiences and talking
46.42s:  about what happened and why we'll talk about some from mine. But I primarily want to
52.62s:  focus our attention on things that we can find from the rest of the trading world. So what
59.06s:  that means is actually poking through Reddit and looking at some of the things that people
65.50s:  are looking at struggling with so on and so forth because you can find a lot of really
70.30s:  interesting discussion points from Reddit. So for those, for those that think Reddit
77.30s:  is really only for toxic conversations and stuff like that. I mean, it is for that, but
83.42s:  it's not just for that. We have a couple other uses that we can pull from Reddit. Looks
89.34s:  like we also got Elon songs in Shrej. We got the we got the gang in town. So that's the
98.16s:  vision for today. Now to kick us off, I'm going to walk through a little bit of some general
105.02s:  questions. And the idea here again is they're kind of like a quiz. We'll call it a quiz.
111.50s:  You are rated on your performance. And you do have the opportunity to potentially win fake
117.98s:  internet points, which is pretty sick. I like to think the ability to win some fake internet
124.34s:  points. But the main thing is I just kind of want to use these to warm us up for the
128.76s:  conversation. Now in the meantime though, I would love for you to share with me some of
138.16s:  your recent trading experiences, either something that worked differently than you expected.
147.48s:  That's the first scenario if you have any of those. And then the second thing is something
152.96s:  that you learned for the first time. So either of those are great fits for this part.
160.04s:  The reason I asked that second question is ideally to start the flow of information
167.04s:  sharing laterally. That's why I like to ask that question. And then the first question
171.74s:  is because it gives us an opportunity to explore a concept together. So first question
179.12s:  is something that happened in a didn't work out as you expected for some reason or another.
184.72s:  And then the second one is anything that you knew for the first time either or that you
189.12s:  learned for the first time I should say. It looks like we also got Dom. We got Dr.
194.74s:  Zayus in threshold solutions. That's a cool ass name to be honest. We got Ben. Cool.
201.32s:  All right. So let's start with the quiz. Shall we? Let me grab a note pad or something.
209.04s:  And then I'll write the questions out for you. Here we can do it through here. This might
213.58s:  crash everything. I don't know. Sometimes this gets a little testy when I have too much
218.22s:  stuff running kind of like I do right now. We'll see if it opens up. I'm just grabbing
223.78s:  the the whiteboard for us so that I can show you the exact questions I want to ask. There
230.08s:  it goes. Here we go. Look, this is even got the old name. ES and Vess. That's OG. Also
237.42s:  for the folks that have been going through the different links that I have all over the
242.02s:  place and letting me know that stuff is broken, you guys are the true heroes because I have
247.50s:  links everywhere. And obviously I do my best to keep them updated. But with this whole
251.66s:  brand shift and kind of changing things, everything literally needs to be updated, which is
257.82s:  kind of difficult to facilitate. All right. So Q1. What are the common.
264.66s:  So for all I V to differ from put. Here's your first question. I might have to wrap it.
275.02s:  Yeah, give me one sec. Just because I made the text obnoxiously massive. Let's see if
281.86s:  that fits better. There you go. All right. There's Q1. So I'll leave that in there and
286.70s:  then I'll start working on the other questions. So the first question is you may or may not
291.54s:  be able to read. If you're listening, I'll read it to you. It says, what are the common
294.34s:  reasons that call IV differs from put IV? That's question one. So if you know the answer
302.62s:  throw it into the chat. And then in the meantime, I am writing up these other ones. There's
311.14s:  only two other ones. Any guesses for question one? Here's question two. And then I got one
332.58s:  more for you. Ben says activity on the chain. It's not wrong, but it's not what I'm
340.94s:  looking for. I'm looking for a more structural level response. It's not a bad guess, but I
346.74s:  wouldn't give that credit. Reese says puts like insurance people willing to overpay.
355.74s:  Elon song says hedging on puts. Okay. So those are technically correct. That's part of
363.70s:  the reason. There are other reasons from a structural standpoint. So let's pretend that
370.82s:  the put prices or let's say that the call and puts are actually priced closer to their
375.78s:  theoretical equivalent, meaning that we wouldn't have that implied volatility variance.
382.62s:  And we're looking more at a structural, a structural reason. I want to be clear, those
387.66s:  answers from Reese and Elon songs are both correct. You both get plus one fake internet
393.46s:  point. Those are completely correct. I'm just trying to walk you on to target for the
397.50s:  other reasons that stem from a more structural perspective.
413.62s:  Any other guesses? I can put my note pad down now. Okay. So let's think about other things
428.86s:  that impact the price of an option. If we're thinking about options, there's an important
438.22s:  but often overlooked inject is to how we arrive at prices. What's something that impacts
448.46s:  calls that doesn't impact puts? I want you to think specifically about a scenario where
456.38s:  you might be more likely to be assigned early. You're more likely to be assigned early
465.78s:  on the in money call in a specific circumstance that is not the same for puts. What is that
470.70s:  scenario? Any guesses? David and Reese, my man, Reese, you now get plus one fake internet
481.74s:  point. I think you're now at plus two fake internet points. That's exactly correct. So
489.34s:  the reason why you'll see call implied volatility differ from put implied volatilities because
496.82s:  it has this other element that impacts it that doesn't impact it the same as the put side.
503.02s:  So again, abundantly clear from a practitioner standpoint, the first two answers from
508.70s:  Liz and Reese were spot on. The fact that people are willing to overpay for puts is completely
513.02s:  correct. Then there's another scenario that I'm just outlining now from a structural
518.14s:  standpoint that also injects a slight nuance between the two products in the way that we
524.38s:  would price them. So that's exactly correct. Nice job. So Reese right now has plus two. This
530.10s:  game you have to track your own points because I don't have the mindset to be able, maybe
536.14s:  I need to figure out how to do like a scoreboard. Sooner or later, I might be able to do live
539.70s:  streams like an actual live streamer and have like resources and shit. But I don't know
545.50s:  how to do any of that. So unfortunately right now it's track your own points. So Reese,
549.30s:  I think you're at plus two though. Okay. So the next question, which is kind of related
554.90s:  to what we were just talking about is why do we differentiate between American and European
561.38s:  style options? Why do we even bother differentiating between those two things? Any guesses? There's
570.90s:  a couple very, very specific reasons. Liz says expiration date exercising early with American
578.54s:  options, which makes pricing more complicated. Yep, exactly. So Elon songs got it in right,
584.46s:  Ben got it in right. So plus one fake internet point for Elon songs, Ben Reese, I think you
590.66s:  also got it in in time. So we'll give it to you as well. Dr. Zayas, I'll give it to you
596.26s:  as well. That's completely correct. So the fact that they can be exercised or have different
602.58s:  exercise rules leads to some important differences in how we interpret the positions. Right? Because
612.38s:  if we have something that we know as a seller can't be exercised up until expiration,
621.78s:  that changes my risk profile significantly. Because for example, if we're looking at something
627.86s:  like GameStop, prime time example, because like this is literally the exact scenario that
631.70s:  this would apply to. So if we take a look at GameStop and right now I have long shares
638.18s:  and I have some short calls against my long shares. Okay. If I did not have my long shares,
649.14s:  I would not have the short calls. Why is that? Why do you think I'm okay offering short
659.86s:  calls against my long shares? But I'm not okay offering just short calls in something like
668.90s:  GameStop. Beyond the fact that I don't want to fade it to the downside, don't want to do that.
673.86s:  Reese says they're covered. Okay, go a little deeper though. I want a little bit more of a
677.30s:  technical answer here. Why does that matter? The fact that they're covered.
682.74s:  Reese says you could lose money to infinity. That's part of it. Still not exactly the
688.26s:  answer I'm looking for. It's not wrong though, but you're on the right track there. That would be
692.98s:  like a partial credit, although I'm not a partial credit kind of guy. So still no fake internet
698.10s:  point for that. Although it's not wrong to be clear, I just have a very specific answer
702.10s:  that I'm thinking about. Elon Song says, say, Q again, happy to. Why would I be okay selling calls
710.02s:  in GameStop against my shares, but not okay just selling calls in GameStop in an alternate scenario
718.74s:  where I have no shares. So Reese already pointed out the fact that they're covered, which is the
724.18s:  correct path to go down. Link it to what we were just talking about. This,
734.02s:  H says you want to be able to participate to the upside not get blown out. That's moving the
737.94s:  correct direction. BW says because you only lose the money that you have. Technically, I wouldn't
742.74s:  lose any money with the covered calls. So that's not it. Reese is on it. Reese is on it right away.
749.78s:  Early exercise. That's the danger. Why is early exercise so dangerous in this case?
761.70s:  Because it's GameStop and it goes through these prolonged periods. So think of it this way.
768.82s:  If let me, let me grab my handy dandy notepad, I think everybody
773.86s:  always understands better with the notepad. I think this is scientifically proven
781.14s:  that the notepad explains it. Okay, so we have scenario one scenario one where I have, let's just
788.10s:  call it plus 200 shares and short one call. So in this scenario like this, if this call right here
804.10s:  gets assigned early, a very simple transaction occurs. I'm now going to sell 100 shares. Well,
813.46s:  I already have 200 shares. So essentially, it's just going to sell 100 of my 200 shares,
819.78s:  leaving me 100 shares. No problem. We're Gucci here. This is the other scenario that has to do
827.78s:  with getting stuck. So in this case, I'm just short one call. Same scenario happens. There's
838.90s:  early exercise. In this scenario now, I'm short 100 shares of a stock that's hard to borrow
848.66s:  with typically four plus days to cover and I carry. This is why? Because if GameStop, for example,
867.46s:  was a European style option and couldn't be exercised early, in this scenario, I can just
875.70s:  ride out these moves. Because again, we want GameStop to go to the moon, but even if it does go to
883.14s:  the moon, it probably will at some point descend back to Earth. It's kind of like if you're fading
889.30s:  volatility products. It's very similar. You can go through these massive expansions that can
894.18s:  be very painful, but sooner or later, it does come back to a nominal level. It's the same thing with
901.62s:  something like volatility products. Now, the risk profile completely changes in this scenario.
911.62s:  Because let's say I get assigned here for whatever reason and now I'm short 100 shares.
919.14s:  The underlying starts flying up. It's already hard to borrow. So even as a retail trader,
924.98s:  again, playing the scenario that I have a tiny position, short 100 shares. This difficulty to
931.46s:  cover is not, it doesn't really apply in this scenario. This difficulty to cover comes into play
937.86s:  when I have tens of thousands of shares. When I actually have a position, it's just important to
942.10s:  understand that difference here. I'm just using a very small position as a general example.
946.58s:  100 shares is no problem. But if you have tens of thousands of shares, this actually becomes a bit
952.42s:  of a problem. Because it also becomes difficult to locate, to carry the position, the broker,
961.14s:  struggles to find the shares, to loan them to you. So then in that scenario, they're going to
966.26s:  charge you a higher interest rate to carry that short position because it's hard to borrow.
973.38s:  This is why in something like this, being assigned early is a giant problem.
979.78s:  And this is why I care about products that I trade, whether they're American or European style
987.14s:  options, because this difference can drastically impact my strategy drastically.
996.34s:  Does that make sense? So we differentiate between American and European style options because
1002.90s:  they incur different risk and they have different pricing components to them because of that risk.
1011.06s:  And this is a great example as to how that risk can show itself.
1015.62s:  So now the other question, actually, let me bring this back because I forgot. I wanted to ask a follow-up
1020.74s:  question on this one. Why let me grab a different color? I can be colorful. Why am I doing this here?
1031.22s:  Why am I long 200 shares? And in this example, short, just one call.
1040.02s:  Why am I doing this?
1047.62s:  Reese asks a great question. All options I've traded are American or futures European.
1053.30s:  It depends. It depends. Because there are tons of products that you can trade options on that are
1062.98s:  still European style. And same thing with futures, they actually have both, which I'll show you.
1070.10s:  Reese is on it again. And so is H. So Reese gets plus fake one internet point and so does H.
1076.90s:  In case he has no Reese's smashing you guys right now, I think is that like plus four or plus five.
1081.86s:  I don't know who's in second place. I don't really concern myself with second place.
1085.46s:  Whoever that is though, I would get your shit together because Reese is smashing it.
1090.18s:  But that's exactly why. Reese has five points. Exactly. So we got to all going to have to step up.
1096.50s:  Who's in second place right now?
1099.78s:  I need to be able to track at least the top two. So Reese has five. I don't know who is in second.
1109.22s:  But this is exactly why. It's Elon's songs. Okay. Liz, how many points do you have?
1117.62s:  Jotato is now hurling insults, which I love to see saying that Reese is cheating,
1123.86s:  which is perfect. That's exactly what we should do is if somebody is outperforming you,
1128.82s:  the first thing you should do is definitely figure out what they're doing to cheat and then call
1134.26s:  them out on it. So I love that. That's perfect. BW says top answer is don't think too hard,
1143.22s:  keep it simple, get in and get out. That's a fantastic way to get your face script off in trading.
1148.74s:  That's a tough way to go about the business. You don't have to over complicate things. That's fair.
1152.90s:  And I agree with you, but this is why we have that one trader. This misunderstanding right here
1159.94s:  is really, really important. It's not a pedantic point. It's not like a fun bar fact.
1166.18s:  This is a completely different thing. BW says I made 10K today on puts in 30 minutes. I'm stoked
1173.94s:  for you. I'm really stoked. The problem is is like, again, $10,000 is a drop in the bucket
1179.86s:  and a lifetime of trading is different. I've seen tons of people come and go in the business.
1185.46s:  And again, I'm stoked that you made money. But flashing your 10 grand as if that's something
1191.06s:  special. It's not. It doesn't really matter. So I would just focus on the right things.
1199.86s:  So this differentiation, though, is why we had that instance before.
1207.54s:  And if you look on, I forgot which sub it is. Let me see if I can find it.
1214.10s:  I think it was a UVX, UVXY box spread. Let me see if I can find this trade.
1228.02s:  Okay, so this is an article about it. I don't remember where it's from or anything. I
1234.34s:  know it's from Reddit. I don't remember who it was. But this is why this right here is why
1239.30s:  you need to know the difference between American and European options. Let's start with box spreads.
1245.14s:  Box spreads are a big part of what I do because they increase the efficiency of just about all
1251.86s:  of my strategies. Damn it. Where'd the check go? Give me a second. I gotta find you guys. There you
1255.86s:  are right there. So that's a video about box spreads. This is a video about a box spread trade
1262.42s:  blog. And I want to walk you through box spreads really quick. It's essentially a way to offer
1271.14s:  the market a risk-free trade. It's genuinely risk-free. If you put on a box spread correctly,
1279.86s:  and I'm going to walk you through exactly what this looks like. So if we take a look at something
1288.58s:  that's European style option, SPX, like this, European style option. So again,
1297.78s:  European style option means what? It means that there's no early exercise. Now this also happens
1306.58s:  to be cash settled. A lot of European options are cash settled. Actually, I think the vast majority
1315.30s:  there might be some really nuanced products that might be European but not cash settled,
1321.70s:  but I don't know many of them. And none of them are striking me off the top of the head. I just
1325.38s:  don't want to lead you down the wrong path. I would think of them disparately, but you can generally
1330.18s:  assume if something's European style, it's going to be cash settled. There might be again,
1334.98s:  some small nuances to that. So SPX, no early assignment, cash settled. If I want to buy,
1344.50s:  a box spread. This is a way for me to essentially loan the counter party of that trade money.
1351.86s:  I'm loaning them money. And then I collect an interest on that trade. So for example,
1359.54s:  I have on right now, actually, which is it expired today. And the box spread that I had on
1367.22s:  was I'll show you the trade. And it was I put it on the 12th of August. So the trade went on
1378.74s:  about eight, well, not about exactly 18 days ago. And it was for today. So let's go to the 12th of
1387.06s:  August. And let's put on this trade so you can see exactly how it works. 12th of August,
1398.10s:  whatever time entry want to look at. And so the trade went on for 12 August. I got to wait for
1413.78s:  or I'm sorry, the 30 30th of August here. 18 days. So fun fact, the reason why I selected this
1422.82s:  expiration, which is not my go to expiration for box spreads, I want to be in the most liquid
1428.10s:  expiration cycles typically. But I literally was parking money that I'm using for a real estate
1435.14s:  deal. So this is literally like a live application of the strategy to earn some sort of yield. It's
1442.02s:  exactly why I structured this position the way I did is because I had money that was going to go
1447.30s:  into a real estate deal next week. And I didn't want it just sitting not doing anything. So I can put
1452.90s:  it in a box spread. Again, in this case, you get to pick your expiration. So 18 days fit my time
1458.74s:  frame perfectly. Now, the more common use case for this for me is when I'm trading things that
1466.98s:  require cash, but I'm not using the cash up front. So for example, a cash secured put as part
1473.30s:  of the covered strangle. If I sell a cash secured put, the broker doesn't automatically cash secure it.
1479.86s:  I have to cash secure it in my own accounting. So instead of just having that money sitting there
1485.38s:  doing nothing or just collecting whatever. Shwa puts it in a money market fund, which is typically
1490.90s:  not a great yield. Even now it's not a great relative yield. I'll put it into something like a box
1496.26s:  spread. So let's take a look at the trade on. So I went out to 30 aug and I put on the 5,000, 6,000
1506.10s:  why the 5,000, 6,000 because the wider I make the box spread, the fewer I have to put on.
1513.30s:  That's what it comes down to. Now there's a slight nuance to this because if you make it
1519.94s:  too wide, then it becomes really difficult to find the liquidity to put the trade on. So this
1528.18s:  here is still a 10 delta. I'm not like super, super, super far out of the money. So I go out to the,
1537.30s:  you know, this case, the 5,000 handle and then I'll buy the in the money call, sell the out of the
1545.62s:  money put then I'll run all the way over here to the 6,000s and essentially do the same on the
1550.90s:  inverse. Buy these sell these. So here's what's happening in this scenario. I forgot the
1560.34s:  analyze trade thing doesn't work here. That's super annoying, but I'll still walk you through it.
1566.34s:  Oh, there it goes. It's doing it. Ho, Ray. So and I'll show you on the live one too,
1573.14s:  just so that you can see exactly how it looks like. But notice how this line is flat. This is
1578.02s:  the PNL graph, right? So the Y axis is how much money I make and then the X axis is different
1583.22s:  prices in the underlying. Notice how this line is just horizontal above the PNL. It's a guaranteed
1588.98s:  profit. Why is that? Because I'm buying something that's a thousand points wide. In this case,
1596.34s:  5,000, 6,000, thousand points wide. When I put on, let's just say it's a one lot. I put on a one
1603.46s:  lot in this scenario right here. It would go on for $99,723. But the width of the spread is worth
1613.70s:  $100,000. So in this scenario, I put up, I didn't put up 990s. Oh, I did put up, that's actually
1622.02s:  hilarious. This is what I entered the trade at was 997 on the nose. So in this case, I paid the
1631.78s:  market. I bought this box spread for $99,700. At the end of the life cycle of the trade,
1638.26s:  I get the difference between the width of the strike, which is a thousand points in what I paid.
1644.42s:  And again, I'll show you that on a live, on a live version. I just want you to see what this looks
1649.62s:  like. So then it's time passes. You will make a little bit of that money each day until you get
1656.10s:  all the way to expiration. So now if I get rid of on demand again so that you can see it more real
1662.82s:  time, because it'll look a little bit differently. So kind of ignore this purple line because this
1669.70s:  is looking at today, right? And obviously it's a little bit too late because you don't do a box
1675.62s:  spread for the same day. So let's take a look at an example if I wanted to put one on for 20 DTE.
1683.62s:  And then let's say I put on a similar structure where I run 5,000 here. And then 6,000 again,
1691.54s:  we got a scroll for a minute. Here we go. Here's the 6,000s. We will buy these. We will sell these.
1700.58s:  And then let's take a look at what this looks like. So you notice here it's guaranteed profit.
1708.02s:  This blue line shows you what it's worth at expiration. If I crunch this all the way down looking
1713.46s:  at all possible scenarios for SPX, it doesn't matter if SPX goes from current spot price,
1721.14s:  literally down to 100. You still make that same amount of money. It's a risk-free trade.
1729.22s:  Now in the case of the one I was showing you that I got into that 1,000 point widespread,
1734.26s:  which again, I'm referring to my spreadsheet that again, you can grab one yourself.
1740.58s:  It's easy to make, but I essentially can see what I'm earning over the current risk-free rate,
1746.34s:  which I use the corresponding bond that's closest to what I'm comparing. So in this case,
1752.42s:  the annualized return for the box spread that I put on was 6.1%. The corresponding yield for
1763.14s:  the same time frame closest to was like 5%, like 5.35. So I'm essentially making a pretty healthy
1773.54s:  margin over the corresponding risk-free rate for the commensurate time frame. That's the cool part
1780.42s:  about box spreads. Now, if taking this all the way back to the point of this offshoot about why
1788.74s:  this matters to us is because if you put a box spread on, which should be risk-free, it should be
1795.78s:  a risk-free loan to the market that you are collecting a yield that should be slightly better than
1800.18s:  the market yield, if you do this kind of thing in something that has early exercise and is not
1809.94s:  cash settled, you have massive freaking risk. That's exactly what happened to this person.
1817.06s:  Yeah, here it is. Let me see if I can find that to a Reddit post. That would be fun.
1828.02s:  Yes, so this. You can see essentially what happened to them. They put on a box spread in UVXY
1834.58s:  because they were going to collect a whole bunch of money. So you can see they put up $250,000
1840.18s:  and essentially they were already up nine grand. Anytime that you look at the markets and you
1845.38s:  think something is too good to be true, it probably is. You're not going to get a risk-free return
1850.74s:  like that, but this person didn't understand the difference between American and European style
1856.82s:  options. So they put on a box spread, which again, if it's in a European style cash settled product
1863.14s:  and you structure it correctly, it's a risk-free trade. It doesn't matter if it goes up
1866.74s:  down sideways circles, you still will make the money if you hold it to expiration.
1871.14s:  That is not the case for non-European style options or American style options.
1878.50s:  That is not the case. You can get your head torn off because now you have early assignment risk,
1883.38s:  which is massive.
1891.38s:  Ari says, is this the guy who got box spreads banned from Robin? I don't know. That's a great question.
1895.78s:  I'm completely uncertain, but this is exactly why we care about this. Hopefully that example
1905.94s:  makes sense to you that sometimes these seemingly pedantic, annoying nuances actually matter
1912.90s:  more than we think. So there's that. Okay, the third question is, I bought a call. The stock went up,
1922.02s:  but I lost money. Why would I have lost money?
1926.98s:  Ram Alama, thank you so much for the chat and the 10 bucks. That's going to go towards my dinner
1930.90s:  tonight, much appreciated. I will grab your question in just a second.
1938.50s:  So H says, so as long as it's European style, you're good to go then. As long as it's European
1954.82s:  style, that's cash settled and you structure the trade correctly. Then yes.
1959.38s:  BW says Theta could be. We have to be more specific than that. H is a better answer.
1969.22s:  H says, volcrush slash reduction plus Theta. I like that answer the best.
1979.14s:  James says, would MES be a good candidate for smaller accounts? Let's talk about MES in a second.
1983.78s:  Give me, give me a minute to go through this one. If I skip past the James, just ask the question
1988.90s:  again and I'll 100% get to it. Elon's songs also says Theta. Okay, so big A says or it didn't reach
1999.38s:  the strike if out the money. That is actually incorrect. Big A's. So that last part of your response
2006.02s:  is looking at the wrong thing. Bought one is expensive is fair.
2012.82s:  Ram Alama says option value drop due to Theta, Vega or both. Yep, there we go. Okay, so let's talk
2020.82s:  about it. If we have an option, in this case, we bought a call and the underlying goes up,
2030.26s:  a set amount and we lose money. The two things that you highlighted are the primary drivers
2037.38s:  why it wouldn't work out for you. The first one could be that you bought. Let me grab my notepad,
2044.50s:  standby. Gotta make sure I can draw this all out for you. I feel like when I look at our ability
2053.06s:  to understand things, it's essentially predicated on my artwork because otherwise, I don't know how we
2059.62s:  would arrive at these conclusions without these drawings. It's kind of like quintessential. Okay,
2065.30s:  so we have a long call and the reason why I phrased that question so loosely is because I've
2074.90s:  wanted to see the way that you would take it and how precise you would be. So in this case,
2081.14s:  the closest answer would be from H, but it's still not as precise as I would want it to be.
2088.34s:  So the way that I would want to see you answer this question is the first reason would be that
2099.22s:  your premium
2100.18s:  move less than either or a combination of beta or Vega. Now, I know again, that sounds kind of
2123.30s:  pedantic. It kind of reminds me of my seventh grade math teacher, Mr. Simons. Remember this dude's
2127.86s:  name like like that comes right to the top of the dome because when we were working on proofs,
2134.66s:  if you didn't answer the proof within a triangle, if you didn't bother to write that,
2140.26s:  he would literally mark that part of the proof wrong. And that seemed super annoying to me.
2144.82s:  That might be why I'm always so fascinated by the details because maybe it was Mr. Simons. He was
2150.90s:  a homie. He was one of the first dudes that got me to like answering to like answering math questions.
2162.02s:  Reese says we're just trying to answer quickly to get those sweet, sweet points. Correct. But again,
2166.58s:  if it's fast and wrong, then it's fast and wrong. But you're still, I think,
2172.82s:  gen like overwhelmingly in the lead. So you're still crushing it. But this one I would give the
2177.38s:  plus one fake internet point again to H. I think he was the closest. The reason why I want
2185.14s:  the answer to be like this and not just saying theta or Vega because people then innately
2193.30s:  start to think theta is out to get them or that if they just hold an option, theta's going to kill
2199.70s:  them. And it's not the case. It's simply that your theta needs to outpace your delta, which in
2207.62s:  this case would be how we're trying to profit from this case, which is from the directional movement.
2213.30s:  So how can we identify if theta is going to outpace our delta super simple? We can take a look,
2220.98s:  again, we'll switch this back to GME. And let's pick something that's like this. So let's say
2229.30s:  we have this out here. These are all good. So in this case, we're all good. But anyways,
2239.06s:  in this case, if GME moves one point, one point, you get a nine cent move. But then you lose four
2251.70s:  cents in theta. Okay. So then what happens if a day passes and GME moves half of a point,
2262.58s:  meaning 50 cents? Well, it means you get half of this delta. So your option would appreciate
2270.18s:  in premium by four and a half cents. And you still would eat this entire daily theta of four
2278.74s:  cents. So then this starts to get magnified the closer we are in time. So for example,
2286.34s:  if we look at the options expiring next week, and we go out as far as we can, in this case,
2291.78s:  it's the 45s that they offer the furthest out. If we go all the way out as far as we can go,
2298.66s:  you're at a four delta. That means if game stop moves, one full point, one dollar in your
2305.78s:  direction, in this case, up. If it moves that full point over the course of the day, you're going
2311.30s:  to see four cents in your premiums. However, you're out running five cents or five dollars of theta.
2325.06s:  So this is how you can assess based on how much theta is bleeding out in a daily basis,
2332.10s:  how much you need this thing to move based on how much time is left so that it doesn't eat your
2337.30s:  entire lunch. That's the idea. So that's one way. The other way is through Vega, which is you
2346.90s:  absolutely accurately identified. So when we're looking at Vega, we can see here, we see Vega of
2353.78s:  0.01. It's generally insignificant. Vega is going to be highest for at the money options though.
2362.10s:  So you can absolutely have an instance where the underlying on your short term option moves a point
2368.82s:  and it's outpaced by your theta and or your Vega. But it's important to note that your delta still
2376.34s:  will appreciate that portion of your options premium. If the underlying goes up, you've made money
2383.06s:  from Delta, but you've just lost more money from theta or Vega. That's the idea behind it.
2392.02s:  Rika says, what good delta and theta do you look for when you buy? That's a fantastic question.
2397.86s:  I have a video that walks through buying options specifically for these kinds of scenarios. I made
2404.18s:  it originally for the apes so that we didn't go through a bunch of problems.
2412.02s:  There. So you can check that video out.
2414.90s:  The main thing is that we at least for me, I try to strike a balance between delta, how much it's
2427.54s:  going to move if I get a move in my favor. And then how much I'm paying in theta. That's really
2432.18s:  what it boils down to for me. But that video will walk you through pretty far in detail.
2438.02s:  All right. So I'm going to go back up and grab Ram Alama's question who said two weeks of DTE
2444.66s:  spy trading in the green and continuing to deepen knowledge and strategies, which is sick.
2448.90s:  What is your philosophy on stop loss orders? Dual edge blade. They've both saved and cut profits.
2453.54s:  Yep. That's exactly it. So Ram Alama in that instance, the way that I would look at whether or
2460.02s:  not it makes sense is if it works out in the aggregate. And I have an entire playlist. I don't
2467.22s:  know if you've seen it on zero DTE options. Let me grab it zero zero zero zero zero. One sec. Let me find
2475.14s:  it. This playlist. Here you go. So that playlist there walks us through different ways to think
2489.70s:  about that exact trade off. So the idea behind it for me at least is I want to strike a balance
2501.06s:  between the probability of me getting stopped out. And the probability of me absorbing a really
2510.02s:  massive loss. So you'll see a few different versions in there. And I actually have it on my to do
2516.98s:  list to update based on what I'm seeing this year because this year there's another change I've
2522.66s:  made to my zero DTE strategy where I'm not waiting until the close anymore.
2531.46s:  Most days I'm using like a volatility adjusted metric where I'm closing out the trade before the
2538.82s:  close at least by 10 minutes typically 15 plus. I'm finding that is just reducing a ton of return
2549.14s:  volatility. And it's because I continue I continue seeing days like this. And again, my goal is not
2556.58s:  to like think if I'm seeing it. The goal is for me to quantify how much I'm seeing it. So I track
2562.82s:  the daily move of SPX intraday minute by minute. High low. And I see how frequently do we get
2570.10s:  these big end of day moves. And again, it doesn't have to be up when I'm trading zero DTE is more
2575.54s:  often than not. I'm trading short strangle short something like that typically short strangle.
2580.66s:  And so it doesn't matter if it goes up or down. But if there's a big end of day move, I can get
2586.58s:  run over. So that's precisely why in this case, I started noticing that if I close out a little
2596.42s:  bit earlier again, you can see that this move started kicking off right at 1250, right? 10 minutes
2600.66s:  before the close. This is somebody that's trying to position before liquidity gets fully sucked out.
2608.42s:  The other thing that I notice is because I will use stops on my zero DTEs sometimes.
2616.42s:  And if you get stopped towards the market close like in the last minute, you can get some of the most
2623.06s:  disgusting, egregious fills that you've ever seen in your entire life. So I normally will exit
2630.42s:  before those periods. So that's why my strategy's been evolving a bit in them. And again,
2637.30s:  my game plan is to do a video that walks through some of these updates. But that's a great question.
2644.34s:  So yeah, let me know if that answers your question, Mr. Ramalama.
2651.94s:  All right. Reese says, as somebody who doesn't day trade, what's the main appeal is your DTEs?
2658.50s:  The main appeal of zero DTEs is actually really, really simple. It's the number of occurrences.
2665.14s:  So you get to take advantage of a generally persistent thing called variance risk premiums.
2670.66s:  Again, this is how I trade them. Let me take a step back. This is completely the way I think about
2675.06s:  them. Other people might try to trade zero DTEs directionally and shit like that. That's not what I do.
2680.26s:  When I'm trading zero DTEs, I'm trying to trade this persistence, the persistence of variance risk
2686.34s:  premiums over realized volatility. So that's just where implied volatility trends over historic
2693.30s:  volatility. And it's generally persistent. It's not always there. Right. So in this case, you can see
2698.50s:  this actual this seven day variance risk premium, this really short term variance risk premium
2702.98s:  is actually negative. It's not great. But conversely, if we take a look at, let me grab my flexible grid
2709.78s:  and let me do my monitoring group, which this one here tracks daily. If I move this out and then let's
2719.38s:  do like five days, five minutes, you'll see on these shorter term time frames, it's very, very
2728.58s:  often the case that variance risk premium is going to be present. But it's a system that works out
2734.02s:  in the aggregate. It's not like a really clean, smooth style system. It's very, very specific.
2741.70s:  And it requires essentially a regular exposure to it. So that's the reason why I like them.
2750.90s:  Now again, whether or not they they make sense or whatever, that's all completely dependent
2755.86s:  on the individual trader and what you're trying to accomplish. But for me, they fit a really important
2761.62s:  part of my book, which is non correlated returns. I see non correlated returns here.
2771.78s:  John says if you are directional, how do you determine longer short at the open? It's not what I do.
2776.74s:  So what you can do for something like directional trading, again, for something like that, you
2782.26s:  one of the most common ways to trade directionally in your days using something called an opening
2787.46s:  range breakout. That is a very, very common day trading tool specifically for stock traders.
2793.78s:  And it genuinely is pretty high efficacy. So I think in general, I kind of like that. But again,
2803.70s:  it's just different than what I do personally. I realize I have to like rename these because they're
2809.30s:  all out of order, which bothers me. So the sectors needs to get renamed. We'll see if this is B.
2817.54s:  Does that make sense?
2827.38s:  James says it seems like spy has that v pattern meaning open and closer. Yeah. Well, because what
2834.50s:  you're noticing is that in general, you're going to see liquidity at the beginning of the day
2840.58s:  when overnight orders are clearing out. And then you're going to see liquidity at the end of the day.
2845.22s:  Again, when orders are clearing out. So that's that's like precisely why you see that. So I think
2854.58s:  I would look at that. And for me, it's part of the reason why I trade when I do.
2862.02s:  Brad says, how does IV crush work or changes in IV and what causes it? Fantastic question.
2867.30s:  I love this. Importantly, if I buy an option for a few weeks out in low price, how can this affect
2873.70s:  me? How can you manage the headwind at all? It's a fantastic question. So the way to think about
2879.46s:  implied volatility is that it's obviously non static and it's going to be relative to specific
2886.74s:  timeframes. So the first thing we have to identify is for example, notice how I have progressive
2894.42s:  up. We can look at whatever, but this just happens to be progressive. Notice how for the 20 September
2899.14s:  expiration, the volatility is 22.93. Then for the next expiration, 18 on it's 26.15. Then for 15
2906.98s:  noves, 25.13, so on and so forth. What I'm highlighting to you is that there are different
2911.30s:  volatilities for different explorations. So over the life of an option as volatility moves and the
2919.54s:  primary drivers of volatility moving, it's implied. It's forward looking. So it's in act, it's
2927.14s:  signifies a change in the expected forward movement of an underlying. That's really what it means.
2935.30s:  So if implied volatility expands, it means the market thinks for whatever reason that over that
2942.34s:  reference time frame, again, whether it's 21 days, 49 days, 77 days depending on the time frame,
2947.94s:  normally when we're quoting implied volatility, it's for 30 days. So when we see
2954.10s:  like this quoted IV, it's 30 days and then we annualize it. So, but it can be for other periods.
2962.18s:  I just want you to be aware of that. So generally speaking over the next if we're just quoting the
2968.34s:  IV for the underlying itself, that's normally going to be 30 day vol. And if it goes up, it just means
2974.50s:  we expect the underlying to move more over the next 30 day period for what reasons, completely
2982.50s:  dependent on the stock. So sometimes it'll be that there's new news that's come out and we think
2988.90s:  for whatever reason that the stock is now going to be more mobile. So a great example of this is
2995.06s:  if I grab Starbucks and we take a look at when it added it's the new CEO, we started seeing short-term
3006.10s:  implied volatility, which is kind of like this straw colored lighter yellow was coming up. It was
3011.14s:  moving up and then it started coming back down. And then if we look at CMG, we can see that both
3019.38s:  period vols started moving up. This is when they replaced the CEO. They took from CMG over to Starbucks.
3028.66s:  So this is the market's perception of volatility changing. So this is how your options valuable
3035.30s:  change due to volatility. Now really common periods that vol will expand is starting two weeks out
3043.30s:  from an earnings release. That's the first period where you will see
3049.30s:  vol starting to expand. And again, the reason for that is because over that release, we tend to expect
3058.34s:  volatility to increase because we're coming into what we would call a binary event. We don't
3064.50s:  fully know what's going to happen. We're not sure. So then we're essentially positioning ourselves
3070.50s:  for the unknown. That's precisely why you will see that happen. So then once we go through that
3078.66s:  perceived volatile event again for whatever it was, then there will come a point where we know what
3084.82s:  happens, right? We're at the point where we get through the volatility event. We understand what
3091.70s:  happens because whatever happened happened, we can observe it. Then volatility typically will
3097.06s:  contract because again, we now know what happened. So that's why you'll see volatility move.
3105.70s:  In a nutshell, it's literally just the perception of forward price deviation. That's all.
3113.62s:  So Brad, let me know if that answers your question. It was a really, really good question.
3123.94s:  Reece says, just to clarify, I had to pay above intrinsic value to close a short call that
3129.14s:  expired today. Is that where your DTE traders make money or is that market maker thing? You'd
3133.78s:  have to explain the trade to me because yeah, I don't fully follow what happened there.
3141.38s:  John says expected to move, which way we don't know. That's one of the notes is when we're looking
3149.70s:  at implied volatility, it's not necessarily direction specific. It's a comb, right? So if I take a
3154.90s:  look at CMG and I look at a probability analysis, this comb is projected using the implied volatility,
3163.30s:  in this case, 32.86%, but you'll notice that it's deviation off of the spot price up or down.
3171.38s:  You can go up that amount, you can go down that amount. And again, this is just within a one-standard
3175.38s:  deviation move. If I open this up to a three-standard deviation move, you'll notice that these numbers move
3180.42s:  much, much, much further out because it needs to encompass a much wider range if we're going to hit it
3184.82s:  within a three-standard deviation confidence interval. So that's that.
3194.98s:  Doctors A is says so a strangle could be a good strategy for earnings betting on price movement
3199.86s:  without having to pick a side. If you're talking about the expansion of volatility, I prefer
3206.58s:  straddles, but a strangle can work just fine. And if you're talking about the contraction for
3211.78s:  earnings, I tend to use either strangles or straddles on the short side. So this Dr. Zeyes,
3219.14s:  this is specifically for you. The link I just dropped in there is a video about trading earnings
3224.02s:  with options for this this literal exact purpose because trading earnings with options is one of the
3232.34s:  few sources of what we would call structural alpha, which is a really, really important concept
3240.98s:  for when we're looking at the performance of a system. If it has some sort of persistent edge,
3248.42s:  which that absolutely does. So yeah, that video will go into detail. Wiggly warm, what up? Good to see you.
3258.26s:  All right, let me see. I just want to get caught up on the chat.
3264.66s:  Okay, it looks like I'm all good.
3266.42s:  Carlos says, how does this guy always drop these links so fast? Oh, you have a question.
3271.62s:  He was like, yeah, it's because I spent a lot of time like building a series of, I call them
3278.18s:  reference videos. The funny part about my reference videos is that they do terribly. They really
3283.86s:  perform very, very bad in terms of like video performance for YouTube. But I genuinely think that
3290.98s:  they're typically really good information. So I make them anyways. A quick admin note. I need to
3295.78s:  go grab some Advil before my herniated disc blows out. I'll be back in like 30 seconds.
3326.58s:  All right, how did I do one time? I feel like, I feel like that was pretty quick. I think it was
3341.78s:  less than 30 seconds. My, yeah, my my bathroom, like the master bathroom is not far away from the
3348.74s:  office. So in this case, we're going to go with some Advil twos, which is a mix of ibuprofen and
3353.94s:  the set of medicine. And yeah, these are now part of my daily routine. It's super fun. Highly
3359.54s:  recommended. Kidding. Don't, don't recommend it at all. I'd never take this kind of stuff. But
3364.74s:  it is what it is. It's got to get through the injury.
3370.82s:  So here we go. Big A says 24 seconds. I feel like that was pretty good.
3378.50s:  Resets I could hear your back. We're cool with every step. That's probably my ankle actually.
3383.06s:  My, my back doesn't hurt at all. But it's just all the sciatical bullshit. Now funny enough,
3389.46s:  though, my ankle does crack all the time. And that doesn't hurt either. I don't get it.
3395.54s:  All right, enough about me because nobody cares.
3400.34s:  Let's look at a couple other things. So first thing, we already talked about this one. Let me
3405.46s:  pull that down. And BW says I care. You're a man. Thank you, BW. Jotato says, Rogan says,
3413.62s:  do decompression for back paint. Yeah. So funny enough, I actually bought an inversion.
3419.22s:  I don't know if it's called an inversion chair table. I guess maybe a table. It's literally
3422.74s:  my office right here. So I've been hopping on there to help it out. I just essentially just
3427.86s:  takes time. Perneated discs, I believe. Well, again, this is like the longest injury I've ever had.
3434.18s:  It typically does not take this long for me to heal. So that's just how she goes.
3440.58s:  All right. So the other thing I want to show you, though, are a couple posts
3448.26s:  for us to work through.
3452.74s:  From Reddit. I'll grab these in a second. It looks like there's a question here.
3457.38s:  Wigglyworm says, when first upside downstream, I want 100% would do it.
3462.50s:  I don't know how to stream from my phone. I've never done it before. I've always done it from
3466.34s:  like the computer like this. But I think that would be hilarious. I also used to do a bunch of
3471.14s:  series called car chats. I really, really enjoyed those where I would go drive around whether
3476.42s:  it's in like, well, it used to be the Corvette before I turned it into the monster that it is.
3480.26s:  It's just way too loud now. The running joke is the reason why I bought them a clarin is because
3484.26s:  the Corvette just got too loud to do car chats in. That's the joke. But I can always do like the
3489.70s:  car chats. I think a live stream during that would be impossible because obviously the whole
3495.46s:  reason why I like to do live streams is to monitor the chat and interact with you all. It's
3499.14s:  super, super engaging for me. It's very fun. That's why normally if the chat is like busy and
3504.34s:  vibrant, I'll sit here for two hours happily. If it's quieter, I'll normally wrap up a little
3509.78s:  bit faster. And it's just because I kind of vibe off of off of you guys. So the upside down
3519.14s:  thing I think would be hilarious at some point. But yeah, probably wouldn't be able to last too long
3525.46s:  unfortunately. I'm trying to put on this fucking thing. There it goes. Like this 10s unit.
3537.70s:  James says take BPC 157 for your back. If I was going to take anything for it, honestly,
3542.82s:  I would do either. I wouldn't take BPC 157. It's kind of less good. I would either just go with
3557.78s:  Amit. It's not working. I would either just go with stem cells if I was going to do it. Or I would
3567.54s:  do a steroid injection. Those would be kind of like the two choices that I would make. But I
3572.98s:  wouldn't bother with BPC 157. BPC 157 is cool, but it really does pale in comparison to something
3579.70s:  like stem cells. But I'm trying to just go the natural route and keep it as minimally invasive as
3585.46s:  humanly possible for the time being is the idea. H says take Fent for your back. I actually guess
3596.10s:  if I went back up to Vancouver for another podcast, I could grab some of that because yeah,
3601.46s:  it's that seems to be pretty much around everywhere.
3607.62s:  Supposed cars says Tumor totally safe. Yeah, I actually take a bunch of supplements every day.
3612.18s:  From like the physical side, I'm fascinated with human performance. I'm not like any sort of like
3616.74s:  you know, crazy good athlete, but I've been athletic my whole life. I still am now even though
3621.30s:  I'm broken. I'm still going to the gym and stuff, but I still train martial arts and all that
3625.46s:  kind of stuff. Anyways, I tinker with supplements. I tinker with recovery methods when we actually
3630.18s:  build our house. That's one of the goals in I still think we're looking at Colorado. And when I
3637.22s:  build my house there, I literally have plans for like an entire recovery room because we have like
3642.02s:  the cold plunge here, the hot tub. I want to get a barrel song. I like all this kind of shit.
3646.34s:  I really am fascinated by human performance. So yeah, that's the that's the idea.
3656.26s:  All right. Let me go back up to Brad had a question. Okay, I see your question.
3666.66s:  Okay, and I see Alfonso. All right, let me grab Alfonso question quick. Alfonso says, I saw very
3672.34s:  interesting earnings play this week two days before earnings. Someone sold 11,700 far out of the
3680.98s:  money puts and bought 11,700 calls after earning stock increased 40% smells fishy. Yeah, I agree with
3688.26s:  you. I do. I completely agree with you. Alfonso, what was the ticker that that was in? We can take a
3694.34s:  look at it. That's me sounds like insider trading. If I'm if I'm being honest and the cool part about
3702.66s:  the cool part about options is that it's kind of like the go to for insider trading because it's
3709.30s:  leveraged. So they make more money. So they're taking the risk of trading on insider information.
3714.58s:  Why would they not go to options and gain the leverage? It's just logical. So you can use,
3719.62s:  that's why we track unusual options activity because informed traders use derivatives because
3728.02s:  they're leveraged. It literally just makes sense. So my guess is that's exactly what you're seeing.
3735.30s:  And in case you're wondering what we're doing for beverages, we still got the mango orange. I
3739.70s:  just got a giant refill of them. So I'm treating myself and we're doubling it up. That's what we got
3745.62s:  for the spin drips. These are so good. Big big fan. So yeah, AFRM. My guess is that's probably a
3758.34s:  smaller stock two, right? Yeah, it is. What's the market cap on this?
3765.30s:  300 million. Yeah. So this is a generally small. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what you saw is literally
3772.58s:  quintessential of insider trading. Let's take a look. Let's go in here and then look at AFRM.
3782.98s:  And then when was its earnings on the 28th?
3797.38s:  Let's do like 26 to the 27th.
3800.26s:  So these are people that these guys sold calls. Let me look. So on the call side, you said you saw
3815.70s:  1700. Yeah. So these. See, this is interesting though, because this is kind of like a bit of a
3824.50s:  shotgun to be completely honest with you. Like these ones, because I see a bunch of calls coming in at
3829.70s:  the bid. And then I also see them coming in at the offer. So that's generally a mixed bag.
3836.34s:  Brad says that AFRM trade out actually based on TA said big move coming. I must play it.
3842.98s:  Yeah. Well, I mean, from a TA perspective, it, I mean, this kind of upward momentum
3851.54s:  budding up against this kind of resistance. That's not necessarily going to lead to a big move.
3857.14s:  What led to a big move was good earnings after the market. If it didn't have good earnings,
3862.26s:  this thing wouldn't have done this. So I would just attribute the the movement is accurately as we
3869.06s:  can. And it's not because of like some prior setup necessarily in terms of like the chart.
3874.74s:  It's because of this event. It's because it had a good earnings. So it was estimated that negative
3879.62s:  44 eight cents and it came in at negative 14. So it's a massive, massive, massive earnings beat.
3887.94s:  So yeah, I would use for me, I would use options positioning as kind of like the guiding force.
3893.70s:  Let me see if we can look at them. I don't know if this will let us go back.
3898.26s:  This earlier, oh, it does. That's great. So we can go back to the 27th because it was after the
3904.26s:  close on the 27th. I think is that right? I think so. And let's see what the options look like.
3912.50s:  I'll fast forward this to like 0.9 something like that. Get a little later in the day.
3920.98s:  And let's take a look at the options.
3922.42s:  Because yeah, I mean, obviously I'm a proponent of technical analysis. I believe a lot in it.
3934.66s:  But I also think it's really, really important to try and identify price behavior and attribute it
3942.02s:  to the to the actual things that are moving price. So in this case, it was earnings. It was a
3950.10s:  binary event that easily can go either way. So we know that that's not right. So it did head
3959.30s:  call skew, which makes a lot of sense. So let's take a look in the front expiration.
3964.90s:  Yeah, I mean, it had moderate call skew, 38,000 against 20,000, almost two to one. So that's a lot
3972.02s:  of people playing the upside. And then if we take a look on the 27th, let me see.
3983.86s:  And doctors, they is kind of interesting that a company composed the negative EPS, but if it's
3989.14s:  a beat, then the price goes up anyway. I think I'm going to make a video actually. This is such a
3993.54s:  great point. Let me, I'm literally going to outline a thing. I'm going to, I'm going to make a video
3999.38s:  called like how to interpret earnings or how to trade earnings as an options trader. So I'm
4004.98s:  shit like that. I'll obviously have to award Smith a little bit and become super hyperbolic.
4009.94s:  Maybe the name of the video needs to be something like how to make $10,000,000 daily on a $5,000
4016.34s:  account trading options in earnings. Maybe that's the, maybe that's the right path. But I'm going to
4022.42s:  leave myself a reminder here. And it will be like how to interpret or maybe how to trade earnings
4035.46s:  with options, something like that. I just got to leave this as like a placeholder.
4043.38s:  And then obviously I have to work on the hyperbolic, you know, how to trade earnings with options and
4048.90s:  make $60 trillion with no money down and no effort. Maybe that's a good one. But anyways,
4058.18s:  let's take a look at these transactions. The first thing I want to do is I want to see people
4062.42s:  that are buying just calls. Yeah, like that. Somebody buying the 35s. And then let's see people that
4072.26s:  are selling puts. Pretty small. So there's not this insane call skew coming through. There's definitely
4082.90s:  heavy calls for sure. But it's not necessarily insane. But in this front expiration, it's almost
4089.06s:  2-1, which again, like when you see these kinds of trades or this kind of setup pre-earnings,
4093.62s:  to me, that typically indicates a fairly bullish configuration. And it's very, especially in these
4099.14s:  smaller companies. It's very, very common due to insiders knowing something's coming.
4106.90s:  H says how to make $50 a day in your boxers trading earnings. There we go. That right there,
4112.34s:  apparently, is the title I needed. So I think that's the, I think that's the right right move.
4122.18s:  Rhys says, been tinkering, but haven't figured out how to have volume displayed horizontal
4126.82s:  in the chart. That's just volume profile. Doctors, they have to capitalize certain words. Oh,
4134.34s:  I was just going to capitalize all of them. Maybe like make it seem like I'm screaming or something
4138.82s:  like that. Oh, I see. You got to make it slightly believable. My bad. I'm going to have to hire
4145.06s:  all of you as kind of my content consultants so that we can actually grow the channel instead of,
4151.78s:  you know, me just making videos that drop into the ether. Love chatting with you guys. But, you know,
4156.82s:  also trying to grow this fucking thing, which is it was actually funny. I was talking with my,
4162.74s:  my best friend, Joe, he was on the channel a while in the beginning. Like he and I would do,
4167.78s:  like conversations together. But he was just like, how's it? You know, he always asked me about
4171.70s:  the channel and stuff. And I was talking like it's growing, but it's growing slow. And he always
4174.66s:  tells me he's just like, that's the problem with principles. And he's not wrong. Like, there is,
4181.94s:  it was so easy to like really grow this thing, I think, if I didn't have principles, but I do
4188.82s:  have principles, unfortunately, I suppose. So. All right. Carlos says you just have to put
4201.06s:  Jimmy and video and all your titles. Yeah. I try to, I try to be specific with what I'm doing
4208.10s:  on the titles and stuff. I typically make content the way that I would want to consume it,
4212.10s:  which is again, not great from a growth perspective, but. All right. So let's take a look at
4218.90s:  this. What do you guys think about this? Do I lose money rolling my options? How does this work?
4228.10s:  What do you guys think about that?
4229.46s:  Michael says I'm here because you have principles. Honestly, that's exactly right to be clear.
4239.78s:  I find that the audience that tends to find their way into my content or the like, you guys are my
4244.58s:  people, right? Like you're the exact kind of people I want to be around. I don't like being around
4248.90s:  the people that that other content tends to bring. So I joke about it because it's like playing
4253.22s:  the game on hard mode. But again, I maintain the principles because I wouldn't, I wouldn't change
4259.06s:  it. Ben says, so whether you lose money or not is not the framing of the transactions. Yep.
4271.30s:  Yep. Yep. So this,
4275.94s:  Jotatus had probably a fee for rolling options there is, but that's not why they lose money.
4279.54s:  It's a good quiet, or it's a good guess, but that's not exactly why.
4282.82s:  Reese says if you pay more to close to receive, it's a loss. If you then open a new option contract,
4292.10s:  that's exactly it. That's exactly correct. So Reese gets another plus fake one internet point.
4302.42s:  A big A says, is it a trick question? No, it's not a trick question.
4310.26s:  The simple answer is absolutely. So here's a video called a comprehensive guide to rolling
4318.98s:  options. Here's a video is rolling options masterclass. And here's a video
4327.94s:  rolling options explained and why most people get it wrong. That last one goes into detail on the
4335.14s:  math, which we will gloss over quickly here. And as you can see, I did make a comment here.
4342.42s:  This person said a loss only if rolled for a debit. Rolling for a net credit can increase the
4349.86s:  possible profit and lower the max loss. This is not wrong. This is wrong. This is unequivocally
4356.50s:  wrong. It's not in opinion. It's not it is 100% wrong. And you can see my response here.
4366.10s:  So the response I gave to this person just found one of them and I responded. I say this is
4372.50s:  objectively wrong and likely due to a common trait of traders, which is known as loss of version.
4377.78s:  It's where we hate losing so much that we play all these different mental gymnastics to avoid
4386.26s:  reconciling that we've taken a loss. That's what loss of version is. We do not like taking losing
4394.02s:  trades. Now a quick dovetail off of loss of version is the sooner as a trader, you can get over
4401.54s:  the fact of being wrong. You are unlocked. It's like unshackling yourself because we as people
4411.46s:  tend to assign our self worth our effort directly to the outcome of an individual thing.
4420.58s:  And we forget that specifically something like trading is a process driven thing. So the outcome
4428.58s:  of any one individual thing does not really fucking matter. What matters is the long term outcome.
4436.18s:  So that means today I got stopped out on my zero DTEs. I got kicked out for a loss.
4445.54s:  So does that mean I'm not going to trade zero DTEs? No, of course I am. I traded them yesterday.
4450.58s:  I'm going to trade them on Monday. Do I feel like a piece of shatter that all my research was
4455.38s:  wasted? Absolutely not. It's because I know losing is part of trading. And as soon as you break that
4464.42s:  thing in your mind, you decouple those where every trade is this emotional loss. Damn, y'all,
4472.82s:  I didn't realize that you guys are going to have to do me dirty like that. I was sitting here hoping
4476.26s:  about, did you not hear that monologue I was on? I was crushing it, I feel like. And then you guys
4481.86s:  just have to drop me over the head with the fucking market being closed Monday. Y'all just did me
4486.74s:  so dirty. Damn it. Well, I guess I'm not trading Monday. This is horseshit.
4497.54s:  But yeah, the broader point is I don't associate the outcome, like the outcome of each individual trade
4505.06s:  with my identity. And I think the sooner you can overcome that as a trader, the better off
4514.26s:  you're going to be. So this person here, I can guarantee you has lost a version. I can guarantee it
4522.18s:  by this answer. Because the only reason why you would answer this way is if you have a problem
4530.18s:  with losing trades and don't want to acknowledge that there's a losing trade. Why? Because this is
4537.30s:  what a role is. A role is when we open a trade. We then close the trade. We open another trade
4546.58s:  and tie the accounting together. That new trade doesn't undo whatever the PNL was in that first
4557.94s:  trade. And I'll use an example right now to walk you through what this looks like. Again, we'll
4564.34s:  get the handy dandy notebook. Maybe I'll just leave this open instead of continuing to close it.
4568.50s:  I thought we were done with the notebook, but apparently not. So first, though, before I go
4573.54s:  further into this, does that make sense? Like the concept I just laid out in terms of what a role is
4578.26s:  and why that position is just objectively false? Let me grab this.
4589.46s:  James says that's right. You lose, but it's hidden. That's the funny part, though. It's not hidden.
4593.38s:  It's literally right in your face. It's just that we don't like acknowledging it. Actually,
4599.86s:  even better scenario, never mind. Change my mind entirely. I'm not going to use this. What I'm going
4607.38s:  to do is use on demand and we'll work through an example together. So let's find something that we
4616.82s:  know will lose. So let's find something. This would be great. This has gone down. How are the
4623.54s:  options in here? Does it have okay options? Yeah, this is fine. We'll literally use this. So what
4630.42s:  we're going to do is sell a put on the 15th. And then we're going to fast forward to the first,
4638.90s:  15th to the first. That's fine. So we're going to come here on the 15th.
4650.10s:  And we're going to sell a put.
4653.30s:  Alfonso says grandma was divorced five times. And when she was about to marry the six guys,
4657.94s:  she says, I'm going to keep trying to let get it right. It sounds like rolling. Yeah, honestly,
4661.94s:  your grandma was rolling her husband's. I think that that's a completely legitimate way
4669.70s:  to think about it. Actually, and what I'll do is instead of this, let me grab a calculator
4675.30s:  that I like to use. It's going to break. But I think we'll be able to
4684.10s:  work it. All right. So I have a calculator over in an Excel sheet off to the side just to try to
4694.50s:  make this a little easier to follow along. I'm clearing out some old stuff from it. And then I'll
4699.94s:  pull part of it over for you to see. Okay. So the date for today technically is 15 July 24 in
4709.38s:  this alternate universe. And then we're going to sell a put. We're going to sell a put for 16
4714.82s:  aug. So we'll go to 16 aug, which gives us 32 DTE. The stock price at this point is 3167.
4725.94s:  And we're just going to do a one lot. And let's sell this at the money 30. So the strike price here
4733.38s:  is going to be 30. And then the premium that we're going to get is $1.53.
4740.18s:  Are we Gucci so far on the scenario? And again,
4749.30s:  four oh no, this is all shifted. This is terrible. I guess that's okay.
4762.42s:  Yeah, I guess this is all right.
4764.26s:  Okay. Does this make sense so far though, like what we've done up into this?
4774.50s:  Essentially, here is, let me zoom this in. Okay, Reese is following me. Good. I needed some
4783.22s:  confirmation to make sure that this isn't like all just ether stuff to you. So here's what we have
4789.86s:  so far. Essentially, we have, it's not AMD. It's AFRM. It's whatever. It doesn't matter.
4800.34s:  So in this case, we sold this option. So in this case, our net credit, here's the $1.53.
4806.18s:  Return on invested capital is 5.1%. In order to cash secure this position, we need three Gs.
4812.26s:  Days to expiration, 32 PNL is 153 bucks. Sick. So then let me launch this off. Let's see if the
4823.94s:  platform will take it. Boom, we got a fill. Great. Great news. Great news for all of us. There's our
4830.26s:  trade. Great. Cool. So now let's fast forward. And I said that we go to the first of August.
4836.50s:  Now again, this is the cool part about using something like on demand is because I can go back
4841.62s:  in time. I can identify a period that I'm interested in testing something. And I can cherry pick,
4847.06s:  which is exactly what we did. We cherry picked a period that we know AFRM is going to go down so
4851.94s:  that we can analyze this psychology of rolling and why so many people just completely,
4860.18s:  completely dork it up because we're uncomfortable with losing trades. It's literally one of the
4865.30s:  worst possible things you can come across as a trader are traders that have a problem with losing
4871.38s:  trades. It's so egotistical. All right. Big A says, can you close the news and make the options
4881.70s:  bigger? I can't because it's not going to zoom in on this. I don't know how to the only thing I
4889.94s:  could do is shrink the part of the screen. But then I would have to change it every time that I'm
4898.42s:  in here. So I'll just read it to you. Although as I can't zoom it in enough, I don't think.
4906.26s:  Yeah, because that doesn't when I do that, it doesn't zoom it in. This doesn't help us.
4912.90s:  So anyways, now my options are trading for $3.45. So let's talk about this role. Let's say that
4923.54s:  I'm going to choose to roll here. Well, by coming here, I'm going to pay negative $3.45.
4932.66s:  So what is just happened? The very first part of this role is this. I had this open trade
4942.82s:  that I collected $153. I then closed this open trade for $3.45. I now realized a loss of $345.
4958.66s:  So my aggregate realized loss here, which you can see is $192. This is a realized trade that was
4970.66s:  open. It is now closed. This trade is done. Now the next part of a role is we look at, let's say we
4983.06s:  wanted a roll out here. And you can't even get out of the money. Let's just pretend that we could
4990.18s:  roll this out the 50 days from 15 go to 50. And let's just pretend that I was able to get $3.50.
5000.98s:  I'm just pretending here. It's not the scenario, but let's just pretend.
5004.82s:  So then now let's say the date is 1.org 24. And we're going to look at an expiration that's 20
5012.50s:  set. And then the stock price now is at 27.03. And I'm still going to use this one lot.
5020.42s:  And my strike again in this hypothetical scenario that isn't true. I was able to move from a
5026.42s:  30 to a 25, meaning I improved my basis by 16 points. And now let's say that I was able to collect
5033.62s:  a credit of $3.50. Here is the new trade. This new trade gives me the ability and the opportunity
5048.82s:  to make enough money in order to overwhelm the loss of this trade. But it does not change the fact
5060.58s:  that the first step in this process of a role is realizing a losing trade. And again,
5069.06s:  there's nothing wrong with realizing the losing trade. It's okay. What's not okay is playing
5076.26s:  mental gymnastics because you don't want to acknowledge losing a trade. That's dangerous.
5083.54s:  That does not help you in trading. So for this person's response, do I lose money rolling
5089.78s:  options? It depends. It's not a guaranteed yes. That's another really common misconception.
5096.02s:  And this is the part that we need to hone in on that. The reason why it depends is because
5103.30s:  James says, but you are still in the money. So you're already losing that trade too. Not necessarily.
5109.38s:  You can't look at it that way. And I'll explain to you why. Just because you're in the money doesn't
5114.58s:  mean that the trade is losing. And I'll explain why in a second. The previous point I was making
5120.74s:  though is that if you close a trade that's winning, well, then you realize again. You've made money.
5128.98s:  So for example, if we modify this example here, and if we modify this example instead of us
5139.14s:  closing at 345, let's just pretend that we closed it at a dollar. You've realized a profit.
5146.74s:  Right? So you can realize a profit when you roll a trade. Now to James, to your point about
5152.50s:  being still in the money and already losing on the trade, that's not what I would focus on for
5157.06s:  two reasons. Oh, see if you keep up with it. One of the reasons is because do you see this
5163.06s:  calculation here called adjusted net credit? That's what a DJ means adjusted and CNET credit.
5172.02s:  So these calculations important. The reason why this calculation is important is because it tells me
5180.02s:  what value I need the option to be at in order to hit break even. So for example, I needed to hit 158.
5188.18s:  I just do the math. So here, if I close this at $1.58, oops, messed that up. My bad.
5194.90s:  minus $1.58. You'll see that it zeros me out. That the aggregate P and L at this point is now
5204.82s:  at break even. So I just calculate whatever the adjusted net credit is. So now James, back to your point.
5212.02s:  If I sell this option, whether it's in the money or out of the money, doesn't inherently matter
5217.86s:  upfront, as long as eventually it hits my adjusted net credit, at which point I would be at a break
5224.02s:  even. So I wouldn't attach it to the moneyness is the broader point there. I would attach it simply
5231.14s:  to the value of the option and what you need the value of the option to hit in order for it to be
5237.30s:  a viable trade. Let me know if that makes sense. Alfonso says, how many times did Gil roll GME call
5244.50s:  options between June 2019 and April 2021 not always a loss? Yeah, and that's the thing is I don't
5250.18s:  even I'm not sure that he was selling calls against his shit. Like I have no idea what he was doing
5254.90s:  because I have no record of that when I'm looking at somebody like the cat, the best thing I can do
5261.38s:  is review what he's posted on Reddit on his page and come up with the best estimations I can for
5270.82s:  his style of trading. But dammit, I have this little cable keeper that's dropping cables all over the
5278.66s:  place. One second.
5284.82s:  I need my cable cable keeper to keep it together. So yeah, I just I don't know what he did over those
5299.06s:  periods. So I can't I have no idea the answer to that one. Ruta Vega, what up? Good to see you. All right,
5305.22s:  so that's one example. Let's take a look as another example here. I haven't read this yet. So we'll
5317.78s:  read it together. Wiggly warm says, is it accurate to say rolling is a method of extending a single
5322.90s:  trade into a series of trades and adjusting your break even point? Yeah, I think it's fair. That's
5327.54s:  okay. That's no problem. James says it does, but if you were rolling, it's likely already close to
5334.58s:  break even. If it goes in favor, yes, but not necessarily necessarily close to break even. Again,
5340.10s:  I wouldn't attach that to it either personally. I think it's partially accurate, but it's not
5344.90s:  inherently accurate. Again, I would just try to keep it on more more representative bases, which
5354.74s:  means kind of reflecting exactly what it is. Because if you're rolling, it doesn't inherently
5359.94s:  mean you're close to break even away from break even. It could be any of them. There's no inherent
5364.74s:  relationship with a role in break even. It's completely situation dependent. So I would just let
5369.70s:  it be situation dependent. I wouldn't try to come up with like a rule of thumb for it.
5374.34s:  Let's take a look at this person. I again, I haven't read this yet. It says, I'm day trading spy
5378.90s:  and previously thought creating a stop loss at 30% of my trade was a sensible risk. However,
5384.90s:  I'm often removing my stop loss with the conviction of being directly correct and exposing myself.
5389.38s:  Often I'm correct, but when I'm not, my account is long. Do I need to give my trades extra
5394.10s:  breathing room 40% usually my trades are correct roughly 80% of the time and my upside is often
5399.46s:  40% or more? What do you guys think of this? How would we how would we think?
5415.38s:  What strategy? That's a great starting question. We don't know. We just know some of the metrics
5422.18s:  of their strategy, but we don't know what it is. It doesn't say the strategy, I guess, is the
5428.98s:  is the annoying part. There's nothing to read. Reese says, need the win rate and average win and
5434.98s:  loss. You're going down the right path here. This is the exact right path.
5439.14s:  Build on that a little bit more, Reese.
5452.02s:  Expectancy. Yeah, that's exactly it. So,
5461.38s:  I have a video that video is called maximize gain risk management for options trading.
5466.74s:  And the whole point of that is to walk you through the way I think about sizing risk
5474.90s:  and trades and managing risk and trades. Because here's the deal. Whether or not this stop makes sense
5483.54s:  completely depends on what they're telling us and what I can tell you is they're not telling us
5492.58s:  something. Because if they're right 80% of the time with an average upside of a 40% return or more
5500.58s:  and that obviously means that they're only losing 20% of the trades, right? You can inference through
5506.90s:  it. So then the required loss on those trades would be absolutely massive in order for this to happen.
5516.66s:  So then to me, if they're telling me I'm winning 80% of the time and then we're essentially
5523.06s:  adjusting off of this, to me, the solution here is really simple. I would focus on this thing I like
5529.06s:  to call cutting the tails. And the reason why I think about cutting the tails is because it's a simple
5537.38s:  way for this person to strike a balance. Let me see if I have a video on this.
5542.02s:  I don't remember the, see normally I remember the names or at least like associated keywords
5552.66s:  with the videos, which is how I'm able to look them up so fast. But sometimes I'm not.
5559.38s:  It might be this one. Yeah, I think it's that one. Oh no, it's this one. That's a lie. I found it.
5572.50s:  Here we go. So that's the video. Let me see. I need to change this title so I can find it.
5588.66s:  So I just literally changed the title of that video so I can find it faster next time for us.
5593.06s:  But that video, it's about cutting the tails. That's what I would do here. So the way I would think
5598.50s:  about this, if I were this trader, is that I wouldn't inherently know if I need to give them more
5603.06s:  breathing room. Because if I'm telling myself that if I give myself a 40% potential drawdown,
5609.14s:  and I maintain an 80% win rate, that's 40% or more, right? Just do the math. If the loss,
5616.98s:  the stop loss is as large as your average win, but you're winning 80% of the time. That's a
5624.34s:  positively expected strategy. So this is totally cool. This I think is terrible advice.
5631.54s:  I think don't use the stop is again, silly, because then what's the exit at some point?
5639.46s:  Like we need to define an exit whether they want to use the stop or arresting stop mental stop,
5643.62s:  whatever, it doesn't matter. But we do need to have some idea of what we're going to exit the trade.
5647.86s:  So I actually don't agree with this at all. So yeah, anyways, I thought that this was
5654.34s:  another interesting case study. I have a couple more. If we want to run through those,
5658.42s:  unless if you have any specific questions, now is the perfect time to start throwing those in and
5662.82s:  we'll take a look. Ricky says, I would think that if he's profitable and outperforming spy,
5667.30s:  then just keep doing what you're doing. Yeah, I think that that's a really fair, fair way to think
5671.78s:  about it. Oh, that's a tough name. Oh, shit, that's a really tough name.
5677.94s:  Ajie, Ajigoo. I don't know if it's goo, Ajigoo. Let me know how close that is. I feel like
5686.42s:  that's pretty accurate. Ajigoo. That's exactly my problem. I keep getting stopped out and then it
5692.42s:  goes in my direction. Yeah. So then you just need to watch that latest video that I sent you called
5697.78s:  cutting the tails. It's literally about that exact thing. I think that should walk you through
5702.26s:  a little bit of it. James says, if directional strategy needs to go your way very quickly,
5707.06s:  your stop loss will already be heartburn on your DTEs. Well, it depends on how much room you give
5713.38s:  the trade, but the name of the game there is just making sure that it has positive expected return.
5718.18s:  That's that's really what it boils down to. Wigglyworm says, do you have a playlist made for what?
5725.70s:  I have a play, I have a ton of playlists. If you go to the YouTube channel here,
5731.06s:  I guess if I say if you go to the YouTube channel, it's kind of dumb because you're on the YouTube
5736.42s:  channel. Oh, this is kind of fun. I've never actually looked for my own shit. Look at us go.
5745.38s:  Hey, this view is cool. Literally never look at this. So if you pop in here,
5755.86s:  and then you go to playlists, I got a bunch of playlists, man.
5761.14s:  And the reason why I make all these different playlists is ideally, hopefully,
5766.18s:  to make it a little easier to find things. So yeah, the stuff that I think you're generally looking for,
5775.30s:  if I think it puts them down here, it's kind of annoying that it does it all this shit so out of order.
5780.82s:  How do you order these? This is terrible. I literally have them ordered how I want them.
5788.10s:  Why does it do this? Here we go. I guess you just have to use this one because I put these in,
5794.34s:  I put these in a specific order that I think makes sense. Right? So you can go. Yeah, okay,
5799.22s:  this is what we're looking for. This part down here. I don't know why the playlist tab is so like,
5804.50s:  this is terrible. You can't find shit. I don't know why they would do this.
5809.46s:  It would be very, very frustrating to find just about anything here.
5817.94s:  This like, but yeah, anyways, outside of that, I think it looks decent. And that's essentially
5826.18s:  the way that I would work through this. So from the home tab,
5831.06s:  it goes just standard videos, the popular videos. These are kind of like the best, so to speak.
5839.14s:  So I would start with either this or this depending on where you're at in your trading path.
5845.38s:  And then I would just kind of work through these in line with one another. So when you get down
5852.10s:  here, this is where we start getting into like specific strategies. We start talking about more
5858.10s:  speculative style trades, stuff like that. So I actually think I need to add this, this.
5868.98s:  Yeah, so I need to add zero DTEs in here.
5874.74s:  Like that. So slight modification to that. That's a little more updated for you. But yeah,
5881.38s:  that's essentially where I would go through for the for the playlists.
5885.14s:  H says, oh God, FFI not judging by any means, but I think it's interesting for a different reason.
5894.42s:  Oh, you're responding to a faunza. All right, let me get back up here. So H says, have you tried
5899.46s:  logging? I think you you were meaning lagging into strangles. How do you go about it to maximize
5905.94s:  the juice on each side? I don't typically lag into them. Now, big A says, your face on the thumbnails
5913.86s:  is lower in the view count. I literally couldn't agree more like 100%. I probably just need to find
5919.22s:  like a really hot chicken like a bikini. And then that would actually be hilarious. If it's
5925.94s:  this really hot chicken, a bikini, and then you turn on the video and it's my my face, like I
5933.46s:  feel like that would just straight up be horrific for people, which is again, hilarious to me.
5941.14s:  But yeah, I completely agree with you. Big A's. All right, so let me go back though
5948.26s:  to H. And for H for your first question about strangles, I don't typically lag in. I'll just
5955.22s:  essentially take the trade that I want. Now, I sometimes will modify the legs as it's moving,
5961.94s:  but beyond that, I don't really bother trying to lag in a whole bunch or stuff like that. It's
5967.06s:  just not really my go to. So for your second question about have you played with poor man covered
5975.38s:  calls? I don't like those personally, but I have a better variation by far that's called a coverage
5982.66s:  strain or not a coverage triangle. Sorry, ratio diagonal. So that first playlist is about different
5990.90s:  strategies that I use. And then the second link is a specific playlist about ratio diagonals.
5998.34s:  And there's actually another video coming out actually tomorrow about ratio diagonals,
6004.58s:  because it is one of my hands down go to strategies for pretty much any directional style trading.
6014.50s:  The video coming out tomorrow is literally 40 minutes long. So I go through an example in depth.
6020.58s:  I go through how I track them, how I find them, how I manage them, like pretty much everything
6026.34s:  is is in there. So yeah, that's essentially what I run instead of poor man's covered calls. I don't
6032.26s:  like those. Wigglyorm says I would watch the shed out of beginners playlist by you. I have that.
6041.46s:  Yeah. So if you haven't seen it, let me grab my playlist. And I have two of them. So this one
6050.90s:  this is for you Wigglyworm. So that one is options basics for beginners 101. And then this
6061.62s:  other video is like investing in trading 101. So the second video I just dropped is more broad
6069.86s:  about like trading in general. And then that first video that I dropped is very specific to
6075.86s:  options trading for beginners. So yeah, there's a ton of stuff in there. And I actually just
6082.42s:  redid not too long ago my options 101 video. And like it's like an hour and 40 minutes long or
6089.06s:  some shit that I literally just shot all the way through just straight through. But the editor
6094.90s:  that I had previously that was helping me with that stuff. He unfortunately got hit by a
6099.54s:  fucking typhoon. So that is essentially dead in the water. I'm just now hiring another editor
6106.02s:  to help with some of these. So hopefully that new options 101 video can come out at least in the
6112.26s:  not so distant future. But I mean realistically, there's nothing special about the way I think
6117.62s:  about options 101. I don't think I think if you go through like investipedia or through your
6122.02s:  broker, either of those would be completely fine. Ricky, that is a fucking epic comment.
6134.66s:  Ricky says typhoon equals puts on editor.
6142.10s:  My god, that's unbelievable. That's unbelievable.
6147.46s:  All right, next one. This is another, this is another post that I haven't read yet. Oh yeah,
6156.74s:  wait, let me see if I got through the questions up here. I don't think I did.
6161.62s:  Okay, Afonso says, how would I know when premiums are too high before putting on a trade?
6166.18s:  I just closed several FFI e positions this week made money, but not what I was expecting,
6170.50s:  considering the nose dive since I entered. I wouldn't worry about the premiums before you put
6176.82s:  on a trade because they're relative to whatever the underlying is in its cycle. So if we look at FFI e
6184.82s:  for your example, and we have to zoom in because it's so crushed. And let's just say that we wanted to
6195.94s:  start buying options or whatever. Like it doesn't matter what the premium is. The premiums going to be
6201.94s:  relative to where it is in price. So for example, if you buy when it's trading at 1052, the premiums
6209.06s:  are going to be higher. If you bought it when it was 267, the premiums are going to be lower.
6212.74s:  Now, there's a slight deviation if we're looking including implied volatility. And I don't like
6219.38s:  buying implied volatility when it's a grigously high kind of like it is in here 276%. That's like
6226.90s:  really, really high. And the IV percentile is only 22% though. So it means that it still has
6233.94s:  plenty of room to expand in terms of volatility. So even when I'm looking at volatility as an input,
6240.66s:  I just don't like buying it when the implied volatility percentile. And for those that don't know,
6244.82s:  this isn't actually implied volatility percentile. This is actually implied volatility rank. They
6250.10s:  have it mislabeled. They're completely different calculations. That part aside, this being implied
6255.94s:  volatility rank, I prefer implied volatility percentile by the way. But this is just what they have
6262.66s:  because my calculation is not working for whatever reason. So if you're wondering though about the
6268.74s:  difference between IV rank implied volatility percentile, there's a video for you. And really what I'm
6275.86s:  doing here is seeing like how expensive the options are relative to themselves. But it doesn't matter
6282.74s:  that much because even if you buy an option that has a 100% implied volatility rank as it sits here,
6290.42s:  if it goes up, you still make money. It still will make money if it goes up. And if it goes down,
6295.38s:  you will still lose money. Now the reason why it starts to matter is because if you buy something with
6301.62s:  a really high implied volatility rank and then volatility starts contracting and nothing else is
6307.38s:  happening, then you'll start losing money a little bit faster because of the other factors that
6314.50s:  are decreasing the value of those options. So it's kind of relative. But I wouldn't obsess so much
6321.06s:  over the overall premium. I would view the premium as like a down payment. And it's not something that
6326.50s:  we're buying hopefully to just let go and hope something happens. It's part of a system that's
6331.54s:  going to be managed either way. So when we're buying options, we're trying to trade something
6337.14s:  directionally. So the name of the game there is doing our best to be directionally correct.
6342.74s:  So if you buy something that's expensive and you're directionally correct, you're still going to
6346.90s:  make money. Let me see. Brad says, you use the term someone is building a position. I understand
6360.26s:  the term build out a position. But is there advantage to building out over time as opposed to
6366.58s:  buying strikes all at once? Definitely. So Brad, for your question, it depends entirely on the
6374.58s:  strategy. But so for example, if I'm trading something like the coverage strangle, leaving
6379.54s:  enough room to scale into a trade over time is really, really important to that strategy.
6387.06s:  Same thing if I'm trading a more thematic position in something like T triple Q's.
6394.02s:  Being able to scale into this during down moves is really, really important. Because if you're trying
6402.98s:  to hold something longer term and you don't do that, then as something like this goes from 85
6411.06s:  down to 49 and let's say that you didn't dollar cost average into it, scale into it.
6416.82s:  Then you still haven't gotten back to break even. It still would need to essentially get
6421.06s:  all the way back up here. And it's not there yet. If you get in here with maybe 50% of your capital
6426.90s:  and then each subsequent 10% drop you add to it, that will lower your break even point over time by
6433.94s:  dollar cost averaging in. So then as it gets up here, you're probably actually making some money
6438.42s:  at this point. So depending on what you're trading in the kind of products, the process of scaling
6443.62s:  into and out of things is actually really, really important. Now, what I would say is you have to
6448.74s:  take a really careful look at the profit mechanism. Because for example, let's find something that
6455.38s:  is showing specific behavior. I got to run a quick scan. So work with me here.
6466.42s:  Yeah, this is fine.
6470.10s:  No, this is not fine. We need options.
6473.78s:  On this again.
6478.18s:  So I'm looking for a specific condition to show you.
6483.94s:  There. So let's say in this case that you want to trade a breakout style strategy.
6493.94s:  And let's say that you noticed that this thing's been range bound from essentially, you know,
6500.74s:  70 bucks down to 54. It's just kind of been oscillating in this range.
6505.94s:  And let's say for whatever reason, I don't know why it broke out here. Obviously some sort of reason.
6511.14s:  But let's say that as it broke above this level, let me draw a price.
6516.50s:  As it broke above this level, you want to start buying it. So then close to the open, you want to
6522.18s:  start putting a position on. Well, if you're too gun shy and let's say you have a 100% total allocation,
6529.14s:  but you only put on 20% of your position upfront. Well, if you get your move, you don't make the
6535.22s:  money. Now, this is for a specific style of trading. This is for break out or break down style
6541.70s:  positions. So if you're trading another kind of position, then it's not relegated to this.
6547.86s:  But that's why it's highly dependent on what you're trading, what strategy you're trading,
6553.54s:  whether or not scaling in or out makes sense into what degree it makes sense.
6558.42s:  So it's got to start with the profit mechanism. And then it's got to rotate over
6564.58s:  into whatever strategy you're using. And that's how I would think about it personally.
6570.90s:  And then the next question is from H. And H says, do you tend to like buying puts or selling calls
6585.22s:  more? I don't have a preference. I don't buy puts a ton by itself. But I do trade the put ratio
6595.78s:  diagonal. Yeah, I don't really care. It really is more so just what fits whatever I'm trying to
6603.06s:  trade more. Honestly, like that's the way I look at it. H says, would it be best to short calls for
6609.70s:  downside exposure when Ive is high and puts when it's low? That's okay. You can do that. Again,
6614.82s:  to me, that's looking at it wrong. But you can do that. There's nothing wrong with that, in my
6619.62s:  opinion. The reason why I don't like looking at that is because it's like prioritizing a secondary
6627.38s:  profit mechanism. You're putting the wrong thing first. So in this case, if we have a scenario that,
6634.10s:  you know, we're trying to place something to the downside, when you're talking about if you're
6638.34s:  selling calls or buying puts, we're essentially just saying, how do we make money to the downside
6644.58s:  with volatility? That's what that's trying to isolate, which to me is secondary. What's primary
6650.66s:  is the direction of the product. So again, this is a really common misconception I think by traders
6658.10s:  that aren't focusing on putting what I call first things first. So let me grab something like this
6665.38s:  and then let me grab, I gotta update this. Yeah, so we want down days and we don't want the turn day.
6671.78s:  So we'll get rid of the turn day. We'll clear this out so it can be anything with options.
6678.42s:  So I'm just looking for some stuff that has had some consecutive down days.
6684.66s:  And let's look for stuff that looks ugly.
6691.78s:  Here, this looks good. Well, it looks good, but bad. So, AMX.
6697.46s:  If implied volatility, let's just say here for whatever reason, was really, really high.
6708.66s:  If implied volatility was super high here, then if I sell a call or buy a put,
6718.50s:  it's secondary. It's completely secondary. The reason why it's secondary is let's say up here,
6725.30s:  when it hit this high and it started rotating down, you're like, okay, well, I want to sell a call
6730.50s:  or buy a put. I mean, shit, let's look at an example. We need to go back to, let's go here.
6737.54s:  This is typically when I would do it is when it starts breaking below this level right there,
6742.10s:  somewhere in there. So then let's say, probably here is when I would have done it on the 21st,
6750.66s:  just guessing, again, this isn't hindsight. So I can see what happens. But I'm also not
6755.46s:  purposely perfectly timing it because again, this is how I know I would trade this.
6761.46s:  And then I would do an initial stop somewhere there. And then probably the hard stop would go
6767.54s:  up there, something like that. So let's take a look at an example here.
6776.66s:  I just need these options to open up for us to go.
6779.86s:  So let's take a look. We can sell a call. And again, these are, it's obviously all bullshit,
6785.62s:  right? Because it's on demand. So it's not giving me realistic prices. We will literally just
6793.62s:  fill them in for ourselves. So 35 Delta is probably where I would sell. And let's say you get the
6799.70s:  mid price of 55 cents. We'll analyze that trade just so that we can reference this price
6806.42s:  as we move time. And then let's say the other scenario is we go a little further out in time.
6812.26s:  And then we buy some slightly in the money putts. Let's buy these 20s. And again, let's say that we
6816.74s:  get them closer to the midpoint, something like 85 cents and analyze the trade. So at this point,
6824.50s:  we might be arriving at this conclusion that we want to sell because volatility is super high.
6830.34s:  Let's just say implied volatility was as high as it gets. Now let's fast forward time a couple
6835.86s:  weeks. Let's go to the seventh of June. This should come down a bit by then. Okay, come down a lot by
6841.78s:  then. And just taking a look at my levels, I would have gotten stopped out here on this day if it
6850.50s:  closed above that with this kind of really long wick, I would watch it on the day. So this wouldn't,
6859.70s:  at least based on my typical trend following system, wouldn't stop me out in this scenario.
6864.50s:  Then this doesn't matter. This doesn't matter. So I essentially would have gotten stopped out.
6868.58s:  Once it falls below this kind of point of control, I look at the next value area down here.
6874.58s:  So then this would become the new stop after this day and so on and so forth. So again,
6880.42s:  this is all armchair quarterbacking, but I'm just kind of talking about the way I typically would
6883.86s:  follow this kind of thing. So now let's take a look at the analyze tab. So we got into these 21s,
6889.38s:  these short 21 calls for 55 cents. Let's see what those are running at. So in this case,
6896.50s:  again, taking the midpoint between 0 and 50 on these 21s, you essentially would be making $25.
6904.58s:  That's what that would be giving you. Then on these that we originally bought for 85 cents,
6911.46s:  the midpoint here is $2.83. So essentially you make $200 give or take. So we might be looking at
6919.14s:  this and say, well, wait, we were supposed to sell when volatility was high. That's a secondary
6925.06s:  profit factor. It didn't matter that volatility was high because it absolutely crashed.
6931.22s:  The Delta portion of the movement was so much greater. So this is a scenario going all the way back to
6940.42s:  H's question about what would be best to short calls for downside when IV is high and puts
6946.18s:  when it's low. That's not the way I look at it at all. The way I look at it is it depends on the thesis.
6952.26s:  If my idea is breakdown, aka big down move, I don't care if vol is higher low. I'm going to buy
6959.94s:  the puts because it gives me a better exposure to the profit mechanism I'm trying to trade.
6966.66s:  If I'm trading something that's more range bound, then absolutely I might favor a change in volatility
6972.66s:  in that case sell the calls in order to benefit from a change in volatility.
6978.74s:  So that is exactly why I would differentiate it that way. The reason why people do that is because
6984.42s:  it's a tasty trade ism. And it's because they tend to have a preference to sell anyways.
6989.14s:  But a lot of people kind of just lift that and shift it without, in my opinion, like fully thinking
6994.02s:  through the implications of it. And to me, it absolutely comes down simply to what is it that we're
7001.06s:  trying to trade and what it's it the best. I have a video coming out in a little bit about this
7007.38s:  idea of matching profit mechanisms because I think it's something a lot of people tend to skip over.
7015.22s:  H says, do you ever use short shares to sell puts against here about covered calls frequently,
7020.66s:  not really about the inverse? I don't. For that kind of thing, I would just trade ratio put
7026.98s:  diagonals. I don't tend to short shares. John says, bad idea to add to a losing position depends
7035.46s:  on the strategy. I would say for beginners, yes, if you're trading and you don't have a profitable
7041.30s:  strategy yet and you're starting like you're still figuring it out, I would say essentially don't
7044.98s:  average down unless your dollar cost averaging into something you're holding long term like
7049.70s:  an actual investment index ETF, whatever, then that's fine. But if you're adding to a losing
7055.78s:  position as a new trader, the overwhelming probability is you are going to very likely piss money
7063.94s:  away by throwing good money after bad. So I would be super, super not willing to do that as a new
7071.94s:  trader. Once you're a more experienced trader, you understand how you behave the way your brain
7077.14s:  works the way you do things, then you can explore that gray area a little bit more, I think.
7083.94s:  So yeah.
7091.22s:  Alfonso says, you have a different definition of dollar cost averaging than I do. I call that
7095.54s:  lowering cost basis. Well, Alfonso, that's because I call it again, I call it the accurate thing.
7102.74s:  Because guess what? A lot of the times that I'm dollar cost averaging, it's up. A lot of times I
7109.22s:  will scale into things as they're going up, which doesn't decrease my cost basis at all.
7118.50s:  Right? So that again, that's why I tend to try and use accurate terminology for what I'm doing.
7127.94s:  Because again, the idea of only buying things when they're going down to me doesn't make sense.
7135.14s:  So for example, T triple cues, I already talked about this. I gave an example of this trade.
7140.74s:  I started buying in, I forgot where somewhere in here is some shit and I was buying in it as it
7145.46s:  was going down, I was buying in as it was going down, down, down, down, down. And then I kept buying
7149.86s:  here, even after it started going up, I'm still dollar cost averaging into the product. But this
7157.14s:  is actually raising my basis, but it's starting to move in my favor. So I don't care if I raise my
7163.46s:  basis if it moves enough in my favor. So yeah, that's why I differentiate there.
7174.50s:  Alfonso says dollar cost averaging would be as an example, buying 100 dollars of Apple. That's
7179.22s:  another way you can dollar cost average for sure. You don't, again, dollar cost averaging isn't
7184.42s:  relegated to being time bound. It's not a time series specific concept.
7190.34s:  Right, just think of the terms dollar cost averaging is just averaging is buying more.
7195.46s:  So you can buy more when it's expensive. You can buy more when it's less to your point. You can buy
7199.78s:  more on a temporal basis based on a certain span of time. You can buy more based on a certain
7205.30s:  percent change in the underlying. It's not, it's not specific and it's not based off of a time
7211.14s:  series. Alfonso says they think it is as chat GPT. Like I don't care. Doesn't like, I don't need
7220.10s:  chat GPT to explain it to me. I know what it is. Because again, like what would you call it then
7225.30s:  if you bought here, you bought here, you bought here, you bought here. The exact effect is dollar
7233.14s:  cost averaging. That's exactly what happened. It's not necessarily a fixed timeframe.
7242.90s:  So averaging down, it's not averaging down. If I buy here at 52 63 and I buy here at 54 75,
7253.30s:  what just happened to my average? My average cost basis went up, not down. It's not averaging down.
7262.90s:  You could call it averaging up. I'm okay with that. That's what it is. But again, the more
7268.74s:  the more comprehensive term for both of those scenarios is just dollar cost averaging.
7278.02s:  Okay, couple more. Recess, can I roll my six internet points into the next stream or were that
7287.06s:  lock in a loss? That's a great question. I think that we can, I think it'll probably be per stream
7294.66s:  and kind of track. That's my guess. Dark Mark says, enjoy the channel. You're straight for
7301.62s:  to approach the BJJ strong with you. I love me some Jets, dog. Can you give me or take on why
7306.10s:  Robin Hood should be avoided as a trading platform? Any concerns? Yeah, I hate Robin Hood.
7310.50s:  Everybody on their mother knows that I will take any opportunity to trash Robin Hood. The main
7315.46s:  reason why I don't like Robin Hood is just because it for a trader's world, it's not as
7324.58s:  advantaged as you think. And it's because they hide their costs on the back end and you get
7331.14s:  worse aggregate fills, which you can track yourself. So I think that's the main reason.
7339.94s:  Like if I if I was going to be a trader, I would simply trade and I would focus on good platforms
7346.90s:  that enable that. I wouldn't necessarily, I wouldn't necessarily bother by trying to decrease
7355.22s:  every single cost possible because to a degree, you start to get like what you pay for.
7364.90s:  So yeah, I think I don't like Robin Hood because it's not a robust trading platform.
7372.66s:  That's the way I would think about it personally.
7377.14s:  All right, gang, that wraps me up. Wiggly Worm says, in a nutshell, how would you trade?
7385.38s:  I love that. So Wiggly Worm, you know the funny part about that? I literally,
7391.86s:  I literally just recorded a video that's called How I Trade Options. And that one comes out on
7400.42s:  the 7th of September. So the goal that video is hopefully to answer that exact question and
7405.86s:  kind of give like a general overview of the way that I trade options. It's just hilarious
7412.90s:  that you asked that question now. All right, gang, I'm out of here. I hope you all have a killer weekend.
7419.54s:  I will see the apes tomorrow for the GME livestream. I have a couple things I want to go over
7424.02s:  specifically. And then we will dive into really whatever else you all help me learn about. That's
7430.82s:  one of my favorite parts about the sessions tomorrow as I get to learn a lot myself. Be an outlier.
7436.02s:  See you guys later.
