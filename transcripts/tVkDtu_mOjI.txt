0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update. Two things on the agenda. We have GameStop.
5.48s: Two things for GameStop. I want to talk about this case with Ryan Cohen. And then I want
11.04s: to take a look at this question from my boy Bruce. He sent it in. I think a couple days
15.80s: ago and I was going to review it yesterday and I forgot to. So we'll hit this one today
20.16s: as well. And then the second broader topic is the chewy offering, quote unquote, which
27.28s: will take a look at that together. So first, so that I do not forget, we're going to
32.64s: start with this one here. We're going to start with Bruce's, Bruce's question about
36.84s: analyzing the volume on the January 20 calls from the 18th. So let's take a look at what's
44.60s: going on. We'll kill that. You'll open up to the platform and we'll get right in.
49.64s: Well, first off, GameStop is been very, very quietly trending sideways. So from a stock
55.20s: trading perspective, it's now starting to fall within this range that starts to become
60.56s: a little more interesting in terms of which way does it break? And as you can see on a
65.28s: shorter term timeframe, when we get rid of a lot of those, you know, other like spikes,
70.32s: the chart normalizes. And you can see that we're still seeing longer term moving averages,
76.32s: positive sloping, but they are starting to become negative sloping on the day. So that's
83.16s: kind of important to note for me from just a general charting perspective. But we'll
86.40s: see what behaves in there. Let's get into specifics though and take a look at this options
91.40s: change. So here's what's going on in GameStop. I'm still seeing this really heavy call
96.48s: skew. And I am seeing the options scattered about. I'm seeing options moving in and out
103.28s: of this front expiration. If we take a look at volume, we can see that the highest volume
107.64s: is the 20 step 20s. And this to me looks like they're being moved around, meaning they're
114.56s: coming up on expiration. People are probably managing them. So if we take a look at the
119.04s: 20 step and we take a look at the 20s, we can see that the volume today was very high.
125.12s: And the volume yesterday, as they were pointing out was high, but not a lot actually translated
132.00s: into more opening trades. That's for the 20 step expiration. So what I see in instances
137.92s: like this is people are trying to salvage the value out of these options. And because
143.40s: they're going to decay away in the next day or so. And without a meaningful catalyst
147.64s: and price trending in the wrong direction, it's just kind of holding something that's
151.48s: breaking apart in your hands that you can't grab a hold of once it's gone. So that's
156.84s: mostly what I see going on here. People trying to take these front expiring options, move
161.56s: them out a little bit in time, give them some time in order to have a position to ultimately
166.60s: hopefully put on for themselves in the future. And this goes all the way back to the same
171.36s: video I cite all the time. I will throw it in the comments below for you. But there's
176.00s: a better way to buy options in something like GameStop than continuing to play the
181.00s: front expiration and just watching your money evaporate. So that's in a nutshell what
186.96s: I see going on here. Now as I look across time and sales, I can definitely see some activity
193.40s: for today, specifically not the 18th, but the 19th because I'm getting to Bruce's question
198.04s: of day late. And it does look like there are some people that are still buying options.
203.00s: Again, this could be that they sold. These are now are buying them back. You can't entirely
208.24s: tell. But when I look through the options chain over the last few days and I kind of see,
213.84s: you know, what's been the most active. And if we come down here to the strike and we
218.88s: want to take a look at just the 20s to help us isolate a little bit more, there's just
223.80s: not a lot going on here is what I'm seeing. And it's a little bit of a mix for people
228.36s: that are buying and selling. So right now we're just looking at things at the offer. But
232.60s: if we add the bid back in again, you can see tons of people that are also selling these.
238.20s: So it's a bit of a mix back. I think that there's people obviously doing different things
242.36s: in here based on what their portfolio represents. But I don't see anything here that's like
246.92s: jumping out at me as like hyper interesting. Now these 20s that are way further out in
252.76s: time. This has been going on for a little while with people building these out. And you
257.00s: can see that that's actually the bulk of these larger trades that we see at the 20 strike
263.16s: and even the 10 like the majority of the higher premium value trades I've been seeing.
268.92s: So these are 300,000 200,000 plus. They've been out in 2025. So that's a big difference
276.20s: than historically what we've seen in something like GameStop. So yeah, overall interesting
282.64s: find. But there's not really anything that's like truly jumping out at me from an options
288.04s: trading perspective. And again, not that I'm doing a video on it every single day now because
292.72s: there are some quiet days. But I look at it every day for us so that every any time I do
299.04s: see something I make a video like this, hopefully in share some of what I'm identifying. But
305.36s: yeah, it's been a little more on the quiet side. So now let's take a look at a couple of
310.36s: these other things really fast. The first thing I want to show you is this case against
318.08s: Ryan Cohen. And it looks like he's paying just shy of a million dollars at 985,000. It's
325.36s: a civil penalty. And it comes against violation of the HSR act. So essentially, and here's
333.12s: the complaint for those that are interested. So you can look this up whenever you would like.
337.84s: And you can kind of see the summary here. And it says he acquired more than 562,000 Wells
345.04s: Fargo voting securities. And he exceeded the HSR filing thresholds. So that means he needed to
352.88s: file specific forms with federal antitrust agencies and then wait before doing anything, essentially
360.08s: wait before completing an acquisition of the shares and whatnot. And then again, depending on what
365.12s: he's planning to do from there. And then obviously you can see from here, it says he failed to do so
369.52s: violating the act. So this goes through exactly what they're supposed to do.
375.28s: It says they have to report large transactions over certain thresholds to the FTCN DOJ so that they
381.20s: can investigate the deals before they close. They have 30 days after the transaction has been reported
386.64s: to conduct an initial investigation, file a second request for additional information,
391.28s: generally illegal to finalize an acquisition during this investigatory period.
395.52s: The maximum civil penalty comes out to $43,792 per day. And that's when he made the correct
405.12s: of filing. So it looks like it was not exempt under the investment only exemption, even though
413.68s: that he represented less than 10% of the outstanding voting securities. So this is again,
419.68s: that differentiation where the purchaser says like I'm planning on doing something or kind of what
425.36s: Rory and Kitty recently did Keith Gill. And he said, I'm just an investor. I just, you know,
430.00s: exceed a certain reporting threshold. So then you can see here when acquiring the Wells Fargo
436.72s: shares, Cohen intended to influence Wells Fargo's business decisions as evidenced by his emails when
442.32s: he advocated for a board seat. Right. So and that goes all the way back to this. So when we're talking
447.76s: about him closing the deal, that's why it matters. Because in this case, the deal obviously
455.60s: is just the transaction of the shares. But then he was expecting to use that power to then
461.20s: affect the business. So this looks like kind of just something to appease, close this out and move
471.36s: on for somebody like him paying a million bucks. It's a lot of money. It's not ideal. But I don't
475.76s: think he probably cares that much. And this is likely just him looking to move on with the path
482.80s: here. So I don't really think this matters a whole lot. I think it's generally interesting because,
487.52s: I mean, you don't like seeing somebody like him getting called out like this or breaking the rules
491.60s: like this. But it's whatever. Like I don't think that this material changes much. Okay, now let's
498.00s: talk about Chewie really quick. So Chewie, they announced a public offering. And this is I think
502.96s: really confusing because as you read through this, you can see that there's going to be a 500
509.92s: million share of class A being offered. But it's not from Chewie. They're not issuing shares.
516.32s: It's from buddy Chester sub LLC who's advised by BC partner advisors LP. And so essentially,
525.52s: what is going on here is this shareholder is unwinding some of their position. And then Chewie
533.04s: is saying that they're going to buy 300 million of it. So this person's offering 500 this entity
540.64s: is going to sell 500 million shares. They're treating it like an offering. And then Chewie is
544.80s: choosing to buy 300 million of it. And then concurrently, they still have a 500 million repurchase
552.40s: program that was authorized and is separate from this. So they're just scooping up 300 million
560.08s: of this 500 million 200 million will hit. And then they still have this 500 million repurchase
566.16s: program going on. So overall, interesting. I find some of the details behind it a little murky.
572.24s: Still, I need to do a little bit more homework. But that's just what I'm seeing so far. So I thought
576.56s: folks might be interested at least in my rudimentary understanding. I'm not an expert on this exact
582.56s: thing. But that's what I read here. So as always, anything I should take a look at, let me know.
587.76s: Later today, I'm doing an outlier pro livestream that's open to everybody. I made a post on YouTube
593.52s: because I'm going to be breaking down some pretty big trades that I made for the FOMC. And I want
598.00s: to talk through how I structured those. And then I also want to talk about kind of the current
601.92s: landscape of the market because I think things have changed a little bit. And I think it's worth
605.44s: while having a conversation a little more detailed about what that means, at least for the way that
610.64s: I'm treating the markets, which is typically what I do in those pro livestream sessions. So completely
614.96s: free to join. You can grab the link from the YouTube post. It's unlisted. So it's not going to show
620.08s: up on the YouTube channel, otherwise. As always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at,
623.92s: let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
