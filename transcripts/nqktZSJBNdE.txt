0.00s: If your idea of trading options successfully long term is predicated on listening to what other people or entities do and applying their strategies, you're going to be sadly mistaken.
11.80s: It doesn't work very well that way.
14.28s: So what I want to walk you through is how to become self-sufficient.
18.04s: I'm going to show you five pretty simple steps on how to create your own strategies that you understand, that you trust, and that you can consistently deploy to make money trading.
29.40s: Long term without relying on other people to do the work for you and have hazardly apply their approaches.
36.32s: What's up everybody? Eric here. We'll come back to all the allies. Let's jump straight into it.
40.04s: So the very first thing here are very first step is to outline the structure.
44.40s: So what I'm talking about here and I have an excerpt from my kind of personal trading plan.
50.96s: And this is the summary, the executive summary aspect of the coverage triangle.
55.16s: And the whole idea here is I want to outline what the strategy is in general, what it's supposed to behave like and what is included in it.
65.44s: So what do I mean by that? If you're a new trader and you want to trade a vertical spread, you would list the legs long call, short call, whatever it is.
74.08s: And all we're doing is making sure that we understand at a base level what this thing any even is.
79.56s: Then once we list out the legs as in what's in there, we're going to just highlight very quickly how it behaves.
85.28s: What I like to do is set up a word document as you can see over here.
88.40s: And I split it up into different sections that essentially I call strategy outlines. That's all this is.
94.12s: And the purpose behind this is we are starting to add some structure around a very complex system so that we can then manipulate different variables and see what works best.
106.44s: And I know what you're thinking. Erick, that sounds like a lot of work.
110.20s: No fucking shit. We're trying to become successful traders when we know 93% of traders fall out within five years.
119.12s: And then there's even a small subset of those that continue beyond five years that aren't even profitable.
124.24s: So essentially out of a total pool of 100 people, you were trying to land somewhere in the top four percent of them.
130.88s: You're not willing to do some work to get there. You're not going to get there.
134.00s: So let's move on now to our next step, which is the initial rules.
137.20s: This is a really important one. And it's primarily because new traders, they don't even know what to put in here.
142.36s: And I don't blame them. I didn't know either.
144.20s: So the idea here is when we're creating our initial rules set, we don't know what's important.
149.84s: We don't know what's not important.
151.84s: So the whole idea in doing this is to make some assumptions.
156.32s: We are guessing that days to expiration matters to us in one way or another.
161.24s: We're guessing maybe delta matters depending on the strategy.
164.36s: So we're going to pick different things that we think matter in over time as you deploy the strategy, you'll find out.
171.36s: And again, in the beginning, there's a lot of trial and error.
174.16s: You can do as much research as you possibly can to shorten the timeframe, but realistically, nonetheless,
179.32s: it's going to take a little bit of time. And that's okay.
181.32s: So I want to like reemphasize here that there's work involved.
184.76s: But if you do your work in a diligent manner, one of the beautiful things is what you do here will carry over
190.84s: to other strategies.
192.16s: So say, for example, we're talking about the coverage stringals specifically, like right here.
195.88s: And I don't know anything about it.
197.32s: I'm going to guess that I want to trade the short put 21 days out.
202.16s: Why? I don't know. I'm just picking a day.
204.44s: Later on, we're going to track how this performs compared to other variants.
209.12s: And then we'll start to understand what different days to expiration do to the strategy and how it behaves.
215.52s: This is how we actually learn how options work.
218.92s: This is a absolute must have.
221.68s: Every single strategy needs to have profit and loss management baked into the strategy somewhere.
226.56s: And again, you can have different variants of this for the people that follow TastyTrade.
230.88s: You're going to hear a lot of 50% max profit and things like that.
234.04s: For people who don't do that, you might try 65% max profit, which is actually for a lot of my strategies.
240.16s: What I've found to work better than 50%.
242.64s: So you've got to test different things here and we'll walk into that, but you got to define it early.
247.16s: So this is kind of like the max profit that we're wanting to take.
250.56s: This is the max loss we are willing to allow.
253.40s: And then life cycle management are things like if I sell a short put and it's a 30 delta short put
258.56s: and it's in the money with 20 days left.
261.20s: What do I want to do? If it's in the money with 10 days left, what do I want to do?
264.40s: Do I want to roll out? Do I want to want to roll out and down?
267.28s: Do I want to wait? Do I want to take it to assignment?
269.84s: There are different variables that you can list.
272.24s: And again, in the beginning, you won't know all of them.
275.00s: And that's okay.
275.72s: You are just going to list your best guesses up front.
279.64s: And then we're going to get into how we can optimize this.
282.40s: So leads into our next point beautifully, which is how do we track if 21 days is better?
287.68s: How do we know if 30 days for a long haul is good for an 80 delta deep in the money long call
295.28s: if volatility is higher low?
297.24s: You can get to all of those answers.
299.48s: But the way we do it is we are very structured so that it's not this haphazard approach.
305.40s: This is probably one of the defining features about me and the way that I trade compared
310.20s: to other people is that I am the same idiot and degenerate as everybody else out here.
315.80s: And literally I'm just a random dude now on the internet, but I am straight up like
320.08s: everybody else.
321.08s: But the difference is what I started to do was this work that people don't like to do.
326.40s: But what it enables me to do is understand definitively what makes the most sense out
331.32s: of the different variables that can be tied into any individual trade or any individual
336.28s: strategy.
337.28s: And then I can optimize off of those.
339.72s: That is the purpose of this.
340.96s: So when we're thinking about creating a trade log, this I typically do an Excel or in a
344.84s: ghoul sheet.
345.84s: And I'm going to list out what I think the key variables are.
348.60s: What I emphasize here for people is do your best to include too many up front, but enough
353.60s: that you will actually fill out the trade log.
356.56s: That's the balanced.
357.56s: And one is much information when we're first learning as we possibly get our hands on,
361.68s: but you have to make it that it's something that you'll actually fill out.
365.12s: So if it's like something that you start and like, man, there's a lot of work, I'm not
367.88s: going to do it.
368.88s: Then you got to cut some stuff out.
369.88s: But there's a trade off.
370.88s: You're cutting out probably usable information one way or another that you would like to
374.48s: have.
375.48s: So think about that very carefully, but some examples on what variables you'd want to
379.84s: track.
380.84s: I think all of the Greeks are great starting point.
382.68s: The primary Greeks at least.
384.00s: So Delta, gamma, theta, Vega, row, if you're trading any sort of long dated options, but
390.96s: otherwise, I wouldn't worry about row.
393.00s: If you're doing any buying or selling, I would look at implied volatility, implied volatility
397.56s: percentile, realized or historic volatility, those matter for most of those strategies.
402.92s: I would want to track also days to expiration with different, you know, windows we have
407.80s: one more managing things because you'll start to understand if I am trading 30 Delta
412.52s: short strangles.
413.52s: One of my, one of the getting challenged most frequently is it when I first put them
417.20s: on is at three days in, seven days in, you can create data sets around all of this and
421.60s: make informed decisions.
423.28s: Next step here, we have create a log with different variables.
427.84s: So we're creating the initial rules here.
429.96s: Then we're creating a log to track those rules.
432.24s: Then all we're doing is the same exact thing.
434.48s: It could be in the same sheet wherever you want, but just put in different rules.
437.72s: So if we say that we're going to sell puts seven days to expiration, maybe try five
441.32s: days, maybe try 10.
442.32s: 10 days, pick different ones.
444.12s: Don't pick so many that you're not going to be able to track it, but pick a bunch to
448.04s: start because the way that we make this consumable is we go in order of increasing fidelity
455.88s: and increasing time commitment.
457.92s: So what I mean by that is the back test is the least useful tool out of this and the
462.68s: most useful tool out of this.
465.32s: What the hell does that mean?
466.48s: Well, if I back test, I don't trust those results.
469.20s: I do not think that if I do exactly what I did, I'm going to get back test results.
474.36s: But if I back test and the results look bad, I'm not even going to bother because if you
478.68s: can't make a strategy, look good back testing, good, fucking luck, making it look good using
484.52s: real markets, real emotions, actually trading.
487.72s: So this is a very simple first step to process the information to get rid of all of the
493.48s: things that don't look good right out of the gate and then to focus on a smaller subset.
498.44s: So if we have the initial rules, this is our best guess what we think will be the best
502.72s: structure or the best strategy for an option structure.
505.48s: Then we try 15 different variables on all different conditions after that we back test
510.84s: it.
511.84s: We now have seven that still look okay.
513.68s: Now we go into some sort of on demand or paper trading.
516.96s: So say, for example, part of your process here includes technical analysis of some sort.
521.20s: Totally cool.
522.20s: Maybe when you're testing via on demand, meaning looking back in time, that's a TD Ameritrade
526.92s: functionality where you can actually fast forward time, which is really nice.
530.04s: But if you can't do that, you can just look at previous charts and you can say, okay,
533.44s: this is what it did here.
534.44s: This is when I would have gotten in and let's see how it did.
537.16s: So this is a more manual process.
539.44s: It's the next step moving from back testing to actually seeing with a little more detail
544.04s: on how something would behave.
545.36s: And then the last one is starting to go live.
547.24s: We start small.
548.24s: We put on smaller positions.
549.96s: We try some different, maybe the top one or two, three variants, but in a very small
555.08s: size control environment.
556.92s: And we monitor how that works.
559.00s: Overall, creating an option strategy from an option structure is not that difficult.
564.32s: It requires some leg work.
565.88s: So if you have any questions, let me know.
567.60s: Don't forget like, subscribe, be an outlier.
569.32s: I'll see you guys later.
