0.20s: this is the side of trading that all
2.04s: those fake ass influencers fake
4.24s: influencers don't want you to see I want
6.64s: to walk you through some very specific
8.84s: habits that I adopted in my early
11.68s: trading career back in 2007 that led to
13.92s: a massive change in my outcome for those
16.80s: that don't know I grew up in an area
18.64s: with 2 and a half times the national
20.56s: rate of violent crime fun fact I
22.52s: actually got stabbed in my hand while in
25.16s: high school between classes the reason
27.24s: why I bring that up is not for a Sab
28.88s: story I'm proud of my background it
30.44s: shaped who I am today however it wasn't
32.76s: really that advantageous for making a
34.56s: bunch of money so when I was looking at
36.40s: starting trading it was very focused on
40.20s: changing my circumstance it was more
43.56s: than just making money so I can buy a
45.96s: nice t-shirt or some I was really
48.40s: focused on changing what my lot in life
51.52s: was going to look like so I want to walk
53.36s: you through those habits right now
54.68s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
56.16s: back to all the outliers and a shout out
57.44s: to the patreon family if what I do helps
59.32s: you out consider signing up in the notes
61.04s: below all right let's take a look at
62.52s: some foundational information on the
65.00s: left-and side these are just some recent
66.96s: news articles about my alma moer High
68.84s: School NFA and I walk through metal
71.20s: detectors every single day and there's a
73.76s: ton of violence there it was what it was
75.72s: however I went from that to this where I
78.28s: was interviewed in Business Insider to
80.08s: talk about how I went about making a
81.80s: bunch of money in my 20s so that by my
84.40s: late 20s I was already a millionaire and
86.32s: then in my early 30s 32 now I'm just
88.76s: snowballing it how did all of this
90.68s: happen I want to walk you through the
92.84s: exact habits that I've deployed the
95.80s: first one understanding The Challenge
97.68s: what does this mean I talk about it all
99.24s: the time but I reiterate it because it's
101.52s: probably one of the most important
102.56s: points on here trading is hard and not
104.72s: easy money the reason why this is so
106.36s: important because when most of us start
108.40s: this we start with the exact opposite
111.08s: mindset that it's a way to make fast
112.80s: money it probably is more appropo to say
116.40s: this is a really fast way to lose your
118.28s: money as compared to make it and I have
120.16s: a couple things I want to show you on
121.56s: that point specifically on my website I
123.72s: have a bunch of studies that I listed
125.28s: out because I think these are good
126.56s: references that's why I'm starting to
128.08s: build out some of the references on my
129.88s: website things that I commonly site so
132.56s: that you can find them and people throw
134.56s: out statistics all the time that they
136.00s: don't look up because they're lazy but I
138.00s: actually do and when we look at this
140.76s: first side over here 7% of Traders
143.88s: remain in the markets after 5 years so
146.20s: that means 93% quit within 5 years why
149.08s: am I saying all of this to you if I'm on
151.36s: a trading Channel trying to help people
153.28s: trade well in order to figure out how to
155.48s: do this successfully it's important we
157.56s: understand the landscape now a couple
159.40s: notes you have to be really thoughtful
161.24s: about your reference Benchmark because a
164.28s: lot of these 93% that quit they're lazy
167.36s: they don't care they're not putting in
168.84s: effort so that doesn't necessarily
171.40s: detract me what I mean by that is I
174.20s: still see a chance because I know the
176.56s: majority of these people are average ass
179.24s: people doing doing average ass things
181.76s: and like this quitting so I understand
185.32s: even though the most quit there's a
187.72s: smaller subset in there that are
189.48s: probably trying and still failing so it
191.76s: tells me that this is something that's
193.68s: possible but probably pretty difficult
196.28s: so what does this mean it means that we
198.36s: have to shift our Focus from how much
201.36s: money we're going to make getting enough
202.96s: money so that we could buy a nice car
205.12s: and we need to shift our Focus From the
208.00s: outcome that we want and really
210.80s: emphasize the process we are going to
213.44s: leverage to get there because I cannot
215.24s: tell you how frequently I see Traders
217.08s: say things like oh do you think it's
219.04s: possible to make 20% per year I don't
221.44s: know for you I know for me it's possible
224.28s: but I also know the amount of effort
226.52s: I've put into doing this have you done
229.40s: that so it's impossible for me to
231.68s: rationally say what is possible for you
234.08s: you might be able to blow my returns out
236.16s: of the water which would be awesome the
238.28s: fact of the matter is you have have to
240.08s: figure out how to get yourself through
242.52s: this process and the sooner you accept
245.52s: the fact that the only thing you can
247.28s: control in the markets is yourself and
250.44s: taking complete ownership of all of your
253.72s: interactions with the markets this is
256.00s: the direct step you can take to start
258.60s: affecting your outcomes in a positive
260.48s: way I have a thing on my website again
262.52s: that walks through some of the things I
264.24s: think new Traders should be focusing on
266.68s: as it pertains to this concept of a
269.08s: process ruthless accountability has got
271.92s: to be there there can be no excuses you
275.40s: are the
277.08s: boss I say okay there's nobody that's
281.00s: looking over your shoulder maybe you
282.56s: have somebody a partner that wants to
284.32s: know how you're doing and your wife
285.60s: cares if you're losing all the money
286.88s: that's actually good that's a forcing
288.28s: function again the average person
291.68s: requires external forcing functions to
294.92s: do the right things that doesn't work in
299.08s: trading if you need somebody to tell you
302.08s: what to do when to do it how to do it to
304.80s: do it well to go into detail to do the
307.68s: hard things this is not going to be for
310.12s: you because you are the only person that
313.60s: holds yourself accountable so unless you
315.88s: have astronomically high standards which
319.08s: you should you're probably going to
321.56s: accept a lesser output which doesn't
323.60s: bode well in trading how do we do this
325.80s: simple tracking this is the ultimate Way
329.64s: we can objectively review our
332.20s: performance I can't tell you how many
333.96s: times traders that I talk to they say oh
336.40s: I I think I'm doing well or I don't
338.64s: think I lost that much but they don't
340.48s: know they don't even look and it's
342.60s: because their ego doesn't want to be
346.16s: confronted with the reality that they
348.92s: might suck at this and that the thing
350.68s: that they've been doing for 5 years
352.48s: might not be working as well as they
354.16s: think it might and they don't want to
355.92s: address it the sooner you throw that out
358.68s: and you abolish your ego and you instead
362.16s: value truth the sooner you can hold
365.16s: yourself to the correct standard and
367.08s: start doing the things to get you closer
369.76s: to your objective as compared to hiding
372.40s: like a ostrich with your head in
374.08s: the sand which gets you exactly nowhere
377.96s: okay think we got that point done the
379.84s: easy route doesn't exist that is just a
383.04s: fact of trading so on Reddit which I
386.00s: love checking out because it's a great
387.48s: way to see how people think about this
388.84s: stuff somebody says this was in a post
391.04s: that I was responding to but the person
392.64s: said I don't understand how people are
394.20s: continually trading and yet don't expect
395.96s: to earn a basic amount like 5% a month
399.52s: basic amount this might be possible for
402.80s: somebody the only person that can figure
406.12s: that out is you what are you capable of
409.72s: producing I can tell you up until this
412.04s: point I've never even exceeded this this
414.56s: will be my first year trading that I
416.68s: beat 60% this is the first one I've been
419.08s: doing this for 16 coming on 17 years now
421.88s: again that's what I'm capable of
424.00s: somebody else might be capable of more
425.96s: but what I can tell you objectively is
428.20s: that the sooner you accept the fact that
430.08s: for me to achieve my returns I've spent
432.32s: somewhere in the ballpark of
434.16s: 34,000 hours on this stuff easy is not
438.08s: in the conversation here there is so
440.80s: much information out there that unless
442.92s: you take some sort of approach to
445.48s: funneling down what you're focusing on
447.92s: there is a extreme chance that you are
450.24s: going to be bouncing all over the place
452.48s: not really absorbing much so we'll get
455.00s: to this a little bit later but I cannot
457.44s: overemphasize enough how important it is
460.16s: to create a learning plan so that you
462.40s: are moving in the right direction
464.16s: efficiently and not looking at whether
466.36s: or not you should use 1226 or 1227 on
470.48s: your macd indicator discipline is what
473.56s: underpins all of this if you are not a
476.12s: disciplined human being this is not for
478.08s: you again you have to hold yourself
480.80s: accountable you have to be the person
482.80s: that forces yourself to do the hard
485.16s: things to violate what your ego would
487.56s: prefer and to spend a lot of time doing
489.88s: this most people do not have that level
493.40s: of discipline and trading is kind of an
496.00s: anomaly because discipline in and of
498.20s: itself will not make you successful you
500.76s: still have to find an edge but
503.96s: discipline is what will likely be the
506.44s: tool that forces you to fill out your
508.48s: trading log that forces you to review
510.60s: the results so that you can see even
513.12s: though you think you might be doing well
514.76s: that you're actually not and that you
516.24s: have to make some adjustments discipline
518.00s: is what puts this whole thing into
520.88s: process so there are a ton of studies
524.04s: out there but take a look at this one
525.60s: this is from confidence and investors
527.24s: Reliance on discipline trading
529.04s: strategies this I thought was
530.36s: interesting this says thus investors May
533.24s: lack the discipline to rely on
535.32s: profitable trading strategies
537.68s: particularly when recent Trading success
539.72s: has increased their confidence in their
541.40s: own judgment what this is saying this is
543.24s: an entire study about Investors even
545.92s: when they have a profitable trading
548.20s: strategy they still don't follow it that
551.64s: ideally goes to show you how important
554.68s: it is to be disciplined and accountable
557.16s: in the space your typical way of viewing
559.60s: the world and thinking about things does
561.48s: not work in trading for example let's
563.88s: take a look at the stock on the left-
565.48s: hand side in general you are taught to
568.32s: bargain by if I'm going to buy socks I
571.52s: would rather buy them cheaper than more
573.36s: expensive I might wait until there's a
575.72s: sale that does not apply well in trading
579.32s: because if you like buying things at a
581.88s: discount there's a reason why things are
584.00s: going down so if you're a really
586.12s: long-term investor five plus years this
588.68s: might be part of your model that
590.08s: actually works really well but if you
591.60s: are a Trader entering an exit in subear
595.12s: periods this is a way to throw most of
598.72s: your money away rather we should be
601.28s: looking at buying things here as things
604.32s: are going up as things are more
606.96s: expensive then reason because this is
610.40s: where things are moving in the correct
612.40s: direction for our assumption being
614.56s: bullish so that's just one example about
617.60s: how your standard thought process does
620.56s: not apply well to trading bargain buying
623.72s: doesn't work well next up last one let's
626.40s: take a look at details and why they
628.76s: matter so like before I was telling you
632.04s: about this idea of creating a plan to
633.96s: focus your learning there's a concept I
635.92s: refer to called 10x activities versus 1X
639.24s: and here's the idea when you are in the
641.56s: beginning of trading I would focus far
644.48s: more of my time on things that take one
647.72s: unit of effort and give me 10 units of
650.40s: output as compared to the inverse and
652.24s: the example I gave you earlier is
653.96s: whether using 26 or 27 days on your macd
656.72s: indicator will make or break you do you
658.68s: think that that that one day difference
660.12s: in your macd indicator is a 10x activity
662.84s: or 1X activity probably a 1x my point
665.60s: there is I'm not saying that that 1 day
667.20s: difference doesn't have any impact at
669.08s: all but that's probably not going to
671.08s: lead you to a gross output why do I care
674.04s: so much about the details it's for this
677.08s: right here if we take a look at this
678.76s: account this is looking at a 15% return
681.68s: over 20 years and I think we're starting
684.00s: with $150,000 right there if you earn
687.48s: that return you're going to make about
689.00s: $2.5 million if you make just 1% above
693.32s: that in your return you are now at $2.9
696.48s: million half a million dollars more on
699.28s: 1% this is exactly why The Details
702.32s: Matter this is why you have to emphasize
705.16s: the entire process and then your
707.32s: capacity to track your progress in that
710.56s: process none of this is easy however
713.12s: these undoubtedly are nine of the habits
716.16s: that took me from my starting point of
718.00s: getting shanked in my hand in high
720.24s: school to being a multi-millionaire in
722.56s: my early 30s like subscribe be an
725.12s: outlier I'll see youall later
