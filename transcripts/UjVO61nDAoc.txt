0.00s: What's up outliers, a quick GME update, keeping the cadence alive here.
4.80s: This should be a fast one because well, a couple of things happened, but none of it is
9.24s: super great in my opinion, unfortunately.
12.00s: So we did see GameStop have a fair down day, 5% down.
19.28s: And it hovered right around 22 and a half ish right now.
23.08s: After hours, it's at 22 54 by 58.
27.00s: And we have now fallen below at least what I viewed as some near term support.
33.80s: So now the question becomes in my opinion, how far down does it go?
37.92s: You can already see from the recent conversation we have, this would be the next target.
42.16s: I see online, which would be about 21.
44.92s: And that's just trying to find where people are transacting in the stock.
48.32s: But unfortunately, you can see here that this is where it corresponds on the volume node
53.08s: about right there.
54.64s: And the volume node just wanes.
56.52s: And this is where it's actually the lightest, which is at like 18 and a half.
60.72s: So what that tells me unless buyers step in in some sort of really meaningful way, I wouldn't
66.92s: be overly surprised if the selling continued is really opposed down to as much as I don't
71.80s: like saying that.
73.00s: The other thing is if I look at the volume for today, you can see if you look right at this
77.12s: spot when I bring it over today, you'll see that the sale volume today was 96%.
82.52s: So buyers were not really out here.
86.08s: And it was very, very much controlled by sellers.
90.96s: And the part that bothers me with this is that it accelerated.
94.76s: So if you take a look at this volume graph behind my head here, do you notice how essentially
101.84s: it starts drifting up?
104.56s: So let me get myself out of the way.
106.24s: Do you see how it's kind of bottoms here?
109.00s: And then it slowly drifts up.
111.96s: That matters actually to a pretty significant degree.
114.60s: And the reason why it matters is because that tells me that even though there's a whole
118.92s: lot of sale volume today, that more people are stepping in to conduct this selling.
123.84s: So that's what that looks like to me.
125.72s: Now taking a look over at the options chain.
130.36s: I see the put side starting to come in a little bit heavy here.
134.48s: So we're now looking at a total put, oh, I have 373,000 again, 650 calls.
141.16s: We were just getting to a point where is about two to one calls to puts, but that has changed
146.64s: a little bit.
147.64s: Now the other thing that I am continuing to notice is this here.
151.72s: This is not unique, but it is important to see is these 125s continue to be built out
158.44s: in the call side.
160.32s: And for the kind of more reasonable strikes closer to the monies, the 30s.
165.52s: And most of the activity we're seeing is being built out in 16 aug.
169.20s: And this is something I've talked about before.
170.68s: This is fully expected.
171.88s: But the takeaway from this is to me, that's where things start getting more interesting.
178.52s: Because we have way, way more options in this expiration cycle.
183.92s: If we take a look at the two aug, it's 112 calls to 49,000 puts, nine aug, 37 calls,
192.64s: 16k puts.
193.64s: In case you couldn't tell, it's 37,000, it's not just 37.
198.04s: It's more than that.
200.04s: 16 aug is 215 to 110.
203.08s: So there's just way more activity going on in the next primary expiration cycle.
207.92s: So what am I looking at going forward here?
209.76s: Well, I'm still keeping a really close eye on the option of chains.
212.96s: And today I just did not see a whole lot that excited me to any significant degree.
219.08s: I did see this position roll through.
222.76s: But overall, it's still just not that massive of a trade.
229.36s: So if we take a look at this, it's a little over $200,000, but this is on the sale side.
236.56s: So somebody sold 2847 of the two aug 23 calls.
244.08s: So they are looking to pull in a lot of premium on these options on a relative basis.
249.96s: That's a ton of money for what this wraps up in capital, again, on a relative basis.
256.56s: On the call side, I'm sorry, in terms of the buy side, people buying options, I don't
262.04s: see a whole lot.
263.24s: I see a ton of these teeny options that are further out of the money, right?
267.44s: So we had 500 of the 33s that are worth a nickel, 49 of the 28s that are worth eight cents,
275.44s: right?
276.44s: These are all just little options.
277.44s: Now, this gets a little more interesting 392 of the two of fives.
282.68s: So that I'm kind of keeping a really close eye on the build out of options chains.
289.00s: Where are we seeing options chains being scaled into that matters to me quite a lot.
295.48s: So overall, quiet day, not a whole lot to walk through my short calls against my long
302.16s: shares.
303.16s: A lot of people get confused when I'm talking about short calls.
305.44s: It's I'm selling calls again shares.
307.16s: It's a way for me to manage the downside of the position.
310.00s: So on days like today, where my shares are not happy, the short calls are.
315.84s: So it offsets some of the holding risk of the position.
318.76s: It's something that I'll do at a ratio to never cap the upside potential, but it allows
325.00s: me to handle smaller downsides like this.
327.60s: So that's what I'm seeing today.
329.44s: I'll see you all on the live session in a little bit.
331.96s: Be an outlier.
332.96s: See you guys later.
