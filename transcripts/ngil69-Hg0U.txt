0.00s: I went through all of GameStop's options transactions for this entire month.
6.40s: I told you guys I do this option stuff and I got a couple questions asking about some
11.36s: other exploration cycles and strikes based on the video I did yesterday and I'm always
16.54s: here to look into some details.
18.60s: So yesterday's video was really analyzing whether or not I thought Rory and Kitty was buying
24.76s: calls.
25.76s: I noticed that version is at least so far.
28.76s: I'm not seeing it and that's not to say that he couldn't be doing it, but it would be
33.52s: completely different than what he's done before.
36.32s: What that means is based on the updates he was sharing on his portfolio previously leading
41.32s: up to the 10th of June, I essentially looked at his strike price around his size of a position
48.20s: and I analyzed the transaction history.
51.56s: So I can get a sense of size, latency, frequency, all those kinds of things.
56.40s: It kind of creates like a bit of a fingerprint on an individual trader's behavior especially
61.16s: when you're trading something at size.
63.52s: It's a little easier to detect.
65.48s: So a lot of the things we're seeing so far don't really live up to that standard and
70.40s: so far as most of the transactions, the block transactions we're seeing are still pretty
75.48s: small and I'm not seeing the same behavior as I did before.
80.88s: So the goal of this video is to provide an update on GameStop options because as you
85.98s: guessed, more happened today specifically with respect to volatility and a ton of call
92.20s: volume for this upcoming expiration in just a few days, which I do find really interesting.
98.60s: To me, it seems like a lot of people are burning money here, but we'll take a look and hopefully
104.76s: they're not.
105.76s: Hopefully they get paid out, but my goal here is not to spread hyperfudge.
111.40s: It is to share information.
113.28s: Leave it up to you to decide.
115.28s: So before we get to these two questions, I'll get them out of the way just for now.
120.02s: And let's take a look.
121.00s: 25th of June, we saw a pretty big pop in volatility and I actually keyed into that pretty quickly
126.84s: because it was very different and especially the way that the volatility moved throughout
131.92s: the expiration cycles.
133.12s: Then we fast forward to today and we see a huge drop in volatility.
138.36s: That is already strange to me.
140.76s: Again, when I see volatility moving by near 50 points, I'm curious what's driving that.
146.80s: Even in something that's very volatile, there's typically some sort of news that would
152.20s: lead to this kind of change in volatility.
155.40s: The other thing that I find really novel here is how the midterm volatility didn't move
162.40s: quite as much as the near term that doesn't fall out of line with what you might see.
170.04s: If you're expecting a lot of volatility in the short term for the short term, the
173.20s: front expirations to move around more, not exactly shocking, but the way that this all popped
178.96s: up and then kind of came down, but stayed a little elevated towards the middle is interesting
183.76s: to me.
184.76s: Now let's kind of get to more of the specific details though.
189.00s: The first thing I want to do is take a look at the volume because this is the genesis
194.00s: of today's video.
196.56s: This is three days in a row where the call volume is over 220, this is the lowest it's been
203.68s: over the past three days, but it's still over 220,000 volume on calls across all strikes
211.24s: and expirations and the puts are still pretty static in the fifties.
215.68s: Now if we click in a little bit, see where this is happening of this total 226K, 130 of
223.24s: it is in this expiration in just a few days here today is the 26th of June.
230.84s: Then if we go out to the 5th of July, there's still a bit way more callsque, but much slower
238.84s: transactions and as a typical learning point is you guys like to as you guys might know,
244.84s: I like to integrate different learning points more general to options outside of just game
250.56s: stop in this and this is a good opportunity for that.
254.08s: Specifically, you'll find that there's typically going to be way more volume and open interest
259.56s: and the standard expirations.
262.20s: And it's because you kind of need enough players for increased liquidity.
266.64s: So people naturally drift to these places for that as compared to the weeklies.
272.96s: That doesn't mean you won't see anything in the weeklies you very frequently will, but
276.16s: you'll typically see more in these standard expiration.
279.72s: The other thing you'll find is that when we look inside of these standard expirations,
284.08s: you'll typically find on round numbers more open interest.
288.44s: So at these 20s, there's 8971.
291.36s: At the 19 and a half, there's five.
293.96s: At the 20 and a half, there's 13.
296.60s: Does that mean that the 20s are just so much better than the 19 and a half,
301.28s: so 20 and a half's not really.
302.68s: It's just that there's more people that want to transact at these round numbers.
306.52s: It's literally human nature.
308.56s: So if you click through this, the 21s only have 75, the 22s, 23, and then let's see what
314.72s: happens when we get to 25.
316.60s: This one now has 16,207.
319.32s: An observable pattern.
322.04s: And it's actually again, kind of subconscious tradable information that you can bake into
326.20s: how you're picking things because these big blocks of transactions can either serve as
331.80s: overall supporter resistance for price, depending on what behavior the market makers have to
337.24s: exhibit as those positions move.
339.88s: So that all aside, coming back down to here, we now know the vast majority is going on in
345.80s: 28 June.
347.20s: If we go out to 12 July, again, still big calls to you, but very, very low volume and the 19 July,
353.80s: very, very big callscue in terms of volume, but not as busy.
359.84s: The vast majority of activity right now is hands down in this front expiration.
365.32s: And I bring this to your attention because while there is activity going on out in the
369.80s: 19 July's, when I see these questions, that's one of the first things that come to mind
374.96s: to make sure that we're on the same page is when we say things like a lot of volume in
380.00s: high OI.
382.40s: On a relative basis, it's just not so much what we're seeing.
386.24s: Now, that doesn't mean for that individual cycle that there's not a lot going on, but
392.64s: as compared to where we are seeing most of the activity, it's very, very clearly here.
398.76s: 130,000 out of the 226,000 for today occurred literally in a few day expiration cycle.
406.12s: That's that.
407.96s: Now, let's take a look at the notable positions for today in terms of transactions.
414.64s: We did see a little more size coming in.
418.48s: The vast majority of this size is at the super far out of the monies.
423.24s: So there's a 1306 lot that came out for the 28 June's at the 128's.
429.56s: And then at the same, there's a 1000 lot that came through.
433.72s: And these were actually pretty close together about 10 minutes apart.
436.88s: So this isn't outside the room of possibility for it to be a single party, but we don't
441.28s: know.
442.28s: And it doesn't necessarily matter because again, as I try to remind you guys, even though
445.96s: like 1306 might seem like some sort of really big position, it's actually not.
452.28s: So I'm doing the math right now here for you guys so that we can see it's a $2,600 position.
459.04s: So and for those that don't know how I'm doing the math, I'm literally just taking 1306
463.60s: points 0 to times 100 or you could do 1306 times two, whatever makes it happy.
471.84s: Which now that I look at that pretty easy math, still need to calculate it or not that smart.
477.12s: Anyways, there's just these aren't big positions, right?
480.44s: And these are the biggest that we saw.
482.44s: Now there are some sizeable positions on a relative basis to this that are happening
488.60s: out here in the 19 July 25's.
492.44s: But this still on a overall basis is not, it's not that large of a position.
499.04s: So in this case, we would take 335 multiply that by 415, you get 139,000.
506.32s: And I know that that might sound like a lot of money, but for something like, it's really
509.84s: not for something like this.
511.52s: And especially for options positions that's still on the smaller side.
515.92s: But this one's kind of interesting to be honest, this 26 July that you see here at the
520.84s: 24 and a half at 250.
524.20s: The reason why that one's interesting to me is just because it's a 24 and a half.
527.12s: You'll notice again, most of these are generally round strikes.
529.88s: And the reason why these 128s are so busy is because they're so far out of the money.
533.32s: They're the furthest you can go right now.
535.24s: And that's why these are seeing activity as compared to like a 125 or a 130.
540.56s: Most of these will expire worthless is what it will boil down to.
545.48s: So unless we get a giant move, I want to be super clear about that.
549.12s: If we get a big move, then they absolutely could show some money.
553.44s: But if we take a look at the entire options chain here, they've already decayed as compared
559.92s: to what I showed you yesterday.
561.64s: They've lost their one delta.
563.32s: Gamma is still zero.
565.76s: And now they're mid at 1.5.
570.04s: So they're still experiencing two, two cents of theta decay.
574.72s: So essentially, these will just hover around nothing.
577.92s: They're worth fractions of a penny at this point.
581.52s: I think a lot of people are just piling into these because if for whatever reason, there
585.36s: was some sort of big move, then this would benefit.
588.56s: But and I also think a lot of people might be unfortunately just piling in on big East
594.00s: theory.
595.00s: And that's not to disparage the theory at all.
596.52s: I still think it's a fascinating theory that I'm exploring more myself.
600.80s: But this is a really tough way to make money trading by kind of catching a glimpse of
605.48s: a theory and then piling a bunch of money into super far out of the money calls, fingers
610.24s: cross hoping something works.
611.84s: Again, I really hope it works for whoever goes for those positions.
615.52s: I want to see people succeed in this.
617.04s: And it's also why I try to talk about this stuff in this way to give people other ideas
622.28s: on how you can structure similar positions that might not make the same crazy percent
627.72s: return if you get a big move.
629.04s: But you'll make more as a gross dollar amount.
631.92s: And I'll link that same video I've referred to you guys before a few times.
636.08s: Buying call options smarter, specifically using GME as a vector.
639.48s: I'll throw that in the notes that you can check out if you would like.
643.16s: Now last thing I want to show you is kind of this.
646.80s: This is like a really high level summary of what I'm seeing in terms of call long call
654.96s: activity for the month.
657.32s: So what I did was look at each kind of primary expiration that we have coming up.
665.96s: And I want to see a few things specifically.
669.92s: I wanted to see what is the trend of transactions and is there any really big positions being
675.68s: built because there's some conjecture that there was.
680.28s: And if we look out to the 19 July expiration, which is this one here, we do see some
687.02s: interesting positions coming on, but still nothing even remotely large.
692.94s: And to be clear, this is volume.
695.66s: This is not open interest.
697.30s: This is volume using some of the larger trades.
700.62s: So we have.
704.02s: And this is aggregating.
705.18s: These aren't individual transactions.
706.78s: So this is looking over each trading day so far this month except for today.
710.82s: I don't have the data yet for today.
713.34s: And I'm looking at aggregating at each individual strike.
719.18s: For that expiration, what is the total volume that we saw transact at that point for the
724.84s: month?
725.84s: And there's just not that much going on here.
729.78s: The most interesting things are these super far out of the money, 128s.
734.06s: And I don't really view those as super informed in trades.
737.50s: These look way more like lottoes to me.
740.34s: These 30s are a bit more interesting to me, but it's still lower volume on a relative
747.82s: basis.
748.82s: So if we come out here to the 30s, we can see that there's a big position here, 25,700
754.50s: essentially, oh, I against 18,500 volume today.
759.34s: So there's definitely a lot of transactions happening here.
762.34s: But my guess is this will be a mix of opening and closing because this is some people that
767.66s: are trying to collect whatever money they can get out of this position before it essentially
771.90s: decays into nothing because if you look at the theta decay, it's 14 cents, these are now
776.02s: worth 17 cents.
777.54s: So if you wait a day, these are going to be worth very, very little as we get closer and
782.62s: closer to expiration.
783.62s: Again, all options have to make a choice.
785.78s: They're either going to be in the money with intrinsic value out of the money with no
791.74s: intrinsic value and at expiration, extrinsic value is gone for all of them.
797.62s: And we're coming up on time here.
800.82s: So so far, that's what I'm seeing.
803.42s: Now to go back and address these kind of specifically, I don't see these.
808.66s: And for the I can't, I don't even know what this is, KVB, they were saying that they were
813.42s: watching as they were dashing out the door.
814.94s: The reason why I was honing in on the 20s yesterday is because people had specific questions
818.70s: about that one kind of like you, right, with this one looking at the July 19th, but I
823.90s: don't actually see a ton of activity out here, at least so far for the 19th of July.
830.62s: That doesn't mean that there's none, but there's not a lot.
834.10s: And then for this question, they were looking at the 30 in 19th July, which is the more
842.46s: busy expiration for sure out in 19 July, but it's still not that busy.
850.94s: So if we go out here, 19 July, pop out here to the 30s, there's 21,600 OI against 6400
861.10s: volume today.
862.50s: So this isn't dead by any means, but this also still is not a hyperactive position just
869.98s: yet.
870.98s: And this is actually a decent trade in my opinion.
873.70s: It's still a little too far in time for the way that I would structure these, but out of
877.38s: 36 delta, these will gain decently, especially because they will capture a lot of gamma if
882.98s: we get a move in our favor, which in this case, would be to the upside.
886.98s: So there definitely is some speculation going on here, but again, based on the overall
891.98s: buying activity that I've seen at these levels.
895.74s: And for here, if we take a look at the 30s, let me see, kill this.
904.54s: And I just want to show you like the average sizes that we're seeing for that expiration
909.54s: specifically.
911.94s: And then we need to clear these and we need to go out here.
915.62s: Here you go.
918.74s: So you can see the size of these trades.
921.58s: They're not big.
922.74s: The largest trade so far was 772, which is not small, but that's also not a very big
929.38s: trade.
930.38s: Another thing is when I look at the price that some of these come through, it is clear
936.06s: that at least in my opinion, the majority of these look like their purchases.
942.50s: So that is more bullish in nature, but there's just not a ton of size going on here yet.
950.14s: So that's what I'm seeing so far.
952.42s: As you know, I am paying pretty close attention to this.
955.66s: I'm happy to take a look at anything that you guys would like me to.
959.66s: If you have any questions, let me know.
961.98s: Be an outlier.
962.98s: See you guys later.
