0.20s: what's up outliers today we're going to
2.04s: talk about trading meme stocks with
4.92s: options the whole goal of this video is
7.08s: to hopefully change the way we think
10.04s: about using options because I know for a
12.40s: lot of Traders they think it's kind of
14.88s: fast easy money to get leverage but the
17.24s: problem is is most of us are structuring
19.44s: trades probably the exact wrong way so
23.08s: what I'm guessing is the majority of you
25.16s: that have tried this have probably
26.80s: bought some sort of Fairly near-term
29.44s: dated option that's pretty far out of
31.36s: the money and you kind of just watch
33.00s: your money evaporate in front of your
35.04s: eyes so the goal is to not do that so
38.64s: let's dive straight in and get into the
40.80s: details so first off I'm going to give
43.08s: you some general concepts to keep in
45.44s: mind about trading directionally with
47.56s: options and then we'll get into the
49.32s: specifics about meme stocks as an
51.60s: example so when we're trading
53.24s: directionally with options there's a few
55.08s: things that need to be nailed down
56.96s: before we even start the first one is
59.24s: the profit mechanism so a lot of people
61.92s: will start just picking different option
64.12s: structures not paying attention to the
66.12s: fact that if you pick the wrong option
68.84s: structure then you know you may or may
71.04s: not make money it's hard to tell but
72.76s: what I can guarantee you is that if you
74.52s: don't have a defined profit mechanism
76.68s: doesn't matter what option structure you
78.64s: pick you won't make money so we have to
80.68s: figure out how things make money first
83.64s: and here are a couple examples so we
85.16s: have things like price movement changes
86.88s: in volatility yields if something pays a
89.12s: dividend if there's correlations so on
90.92s: and so forth so when we're talking about
92.96s: meme stocks there's some very specific
95.44s: traits that come with them but the main
97.68s: thing that we're trading when we're
99.48s: looking at stuff like meme stocks is
101.96s: actually these two right here price
105.00s: movement and volatility which we'll talk
107.36s: more about so once we understand the
109.04s: profit mechanisms we need to measure
111.16s: them we need to understand how they work
113.84s: what are the ins and outs of when it
116.56s: happens which I have a prime example for
118.84s: you that we're going to get into to
120.04s: looking at five different meme stocks
122.28s: from Gamestop cost Siri lunar to give
125.64s: you some ideas on how to look at this
127.88s: but we need to not just understand the
129.52s: profit mechanism but we need to measure
131.52s: it and then figure out corresponding
133.96s: signals that help us find it now we get
137.28s: to use options we get to look at what
140.08s: structures make the most sense for what
143.48s: we're trying to accomplish because as
145.60s: you'll note when we go through an
146.80s: example in a minute there are tradeoffs
149.32s: to every every single options structure
151.76s: and that's the beautiful part is you get
153.84s: a chance to fit things so that it makes
156.72s: sense based on your specific thesis so
159.44s: if we have things that are expected to
161.60s: move a whole bunch well we probably
164.16s: don't want to sell premium because we're
166.12s: going to miss out on a lot of profit
167.40s: you'll learn more about that in a moment
168.84s: the last thing is to tie all of this
171.56s: together so now we understand the profit
173.40s: mechanism we've measured it we know how
175.20s: it behaves we've identified signals that
177.32s: help us find it we've compared different
179.24s: structures we understand what structures
181.52s: make the most sense based on how this
183.24s: thing moves and our ability to detect it
185.20s: so now we codify what we're doing so
188.48s: that we can continually do it over time
191.44s: consistently and that allows us to
193.84s: optimize our approach and ultimately
197.00s: make more money which is the name of the
199.08s: game so if we think about this process
201.52s: it's it's actually pretty straight
203.88s: forward and we'll look at an example
205.96s: together so we're going to start by
207.60s: looking at a profit mechanism then we're
209.88s: going to start figuring out which
211.28s: strategy makes the most sense I follow
213.32s: kind of a three-step process where I'm
215.16s: going to look at what is my general
216.88s: thoughts towards the economy the market
218.72s: that kind of stuff look at the portfolio
220.32s: see if there's any specific needs and
222.00s: then the position itself then I'm going
224.72s: to build a trade and for this example
227.32s: we're actually going to look at meme
229.04s: stocks so let's start with what we just
231.72s: talked about what's the profit mechanism
233.76s: well the profit mechanism here as I've
235.60s: already outlined is going to be price
237.52s: movement up or down and volatility
239.36s: change is up or down so then what are
241.60s: some of the traits that we can think of
244.28s: when we look at meme stocks well let's
246.96s: eyeball it really fast if we hop over to
249.04s: the platform you'll see a few things
251.16s: right out of the gate so I'm right now
252.84s: looking at GameStop one of the things I
254.48s: noticed about the profit mechanisms here
256.60s: is that they're pretty severe all that
258.76s: means is I can find plenty of periods of
261.12s: time where things are kind of really
262.56s: really quiet and then all of a sudden
264.68s: they get really not quiet that's very
267.52s: very important to identify and again if
269.72s: if I look at something like Siri I see
271.84s: the same thing it'll go through periods
273.44s: of time where it Trends a little bit
275.20s: Trends again then takes another Trend
277.32s: and then it'll go through these
278.56s: explosive periods up or down so what I'm
282.16s: doing here is identifying the traits of
285.92s: this profit mechanism so I can obviously
288.08s: see that it's very high volatility and I
290.12s: can see that it moves very quickly now
292.36s: this is just an eyeball test I'm looking
294.72s: at the charts coming up with some ideas
296.44s: and you'll see in a second that we can
298.00s: get one click into detail and actually
301.28s: qualify and quantify both profit
304.16s: mechanism behavior and then signals
306.24s: because again signals are how do we
308.08s: determine when this stuff starts to
310.68s: happen so again when I look through this
312.92s: and just eyeball it there's one thing I
314.60s: can tell you clear as day when I see
316.84s: price starting to go crazy I see volume
319.24s: go crazy across the board in every
321.60s: single circumstance so here we can see
323.80s: price is kind of like trending but
325.32s: notice how volume although comparatively
327.28s: to here it looks way less it still is
329.24s: much higher than what it was in here so
332.04s: that gives me some ideas on what might
334.36s: matter I also can see clear
336.20s: relationships between Price's
338.00s: relationship to moving averages or even
340.64s: things like oscillators so then what I
343.96s: do is I take those ideas and I say okay
347.04s: well let me take a look at some
348.32s: different indicators and let me find a
351.08s: correlation between certain size price
353.36s: moves and what that indicator is showing
355.76s: me and in this case you can see a bunch
357.52s: of different indicators but what jumps
359.16s: out at me is that the 5day average
361.64s: volume across all of these different
364.16s: stocks which is this red line here is
366.44s: highly highly correlated with price
368.80s: movement of greater than 10% so then
371.08s: that gives me one thing I need to pay
372.92s: attention to okay I now know average
375.40s: volume in relation to current volume is
378.20s: actually pretty informative I can also
380.12s: tell you something using like an RSI
382.20s: with a 5day moving average is not very
384.60s: correlated so that might be one I spend
387.20s: less time focusing on and I spend more
389.20s: time focusing on these other tools
391.68s: volume is a massive massive indicator so
394.68s: then I also want to qualify and quantify
397.80s: those movements I was talking about okay
399.84s: so now if I see any of these stocks move
402.40s: greater than 15% once it moves 15% how
406.64s: much higher above it does it typically
408.52s: go and we can see that in these bars for
411.64s: cost series Sofi lunar and gme then I
414.08s: can also say okay how long does it stay
417.40s: above that threshold that's what the red
419.08s: line is and I can tell you that it's
421.20s: really short duration for most of them
423.64s: after those moves so all of this
426.12s: information directly feeds into how I
429.60s: think about building positions which
431.72s: we're going to get into right now so I
433.36s: can tell you in terms of timing that
435.80s: there are two different elements to this
437.96s: one if I'm trying to time it really
440.20s: really well and Capt the majority of the
441.76s: move I'm going to have to have some sort
443.20s: of longer term position in here because
445.08s: by the time you start to see volume
446.80s: expanding it's already starting its move
448.68s: now my preference is actually to follow
450.72s: the latter part of the move more than
452.48s: anything but if you're trying to capture
454.12s: the whole move you have to be very
455.44s: thoughtful about what duration you
458.04s: choose to pick so for something like
460.12s: GameStop right now is if I was trying to
461.84s: trade some sort of what I expect to be
463.84s: upward movement well it's really quiet
465.56s: there's nothing for me to do right now
467.16s: so I'm probably going to favor a mix of
470.20s: long-term and short-term durations so
472.76s: that the longterm can keep me exposed if
476.44s: the thing happens before I can pick up
478.72s: on it but then when I start to see some
480.88s: of these signals occurring then maybe I
482.60s: can add some short-term trades as well
484.80s: to capitalize on the movement when they
486.76s: start to move the other thing I can tell
488.68s: you is that I have a bunch of other
490.72s: visuals here but the overall move
492.72s: severity meaning how far it tends to
494.68s: move the vast majority of the case it's
496.76s: not much but then sometimes it will have
499.52s: a smaller subset of these really big
502.16s: parabolic moves so then it tells me the
504.88s: majority of the time I'm going to be
506.96s: playing it it's actually for Less than
509.92s: these massive moves that we might see
512.28s: and then that tells me that every once
513.88s: in a while I'll see a really big move so
516.36s: then that leads me to a few strategies
519.16s: that I think make the most sense trading
521.08s: it to the upside I'm probably going to
522.84s: use something like ratio call diagonals
524.88s: or just regular diagonals and I would
526.92s: add kicker options I have a video that
529.12s: I'll link to in the notes below that
530.48s: goes through this more in detail we'll
531.88s: look at a quick model together and then
533.76s: the way that I can trade it to the
535.00s: downside because I know that it doesn't
537.52s: stay above the threshold for that long
539.44s: long is by trading something like long
541.16s: puts so why do I favor long premium
544.04s: strategies because as we've talked about
546.56s: I want the structure to fit the thesis
549.08s: and if I'm talking about things that are
550.56s: moving a lot I actually don't want to
552.80s: have capped profit potential so I can
555.24s: capture those moves when they happen the
557.60s: other thing is if I'm trading some sort
559.68s: of short premium against it it can be
561.92s: really painful to go through these
563.64s: really big moves and it can be
565.28s: problematic so let's talk about this
567.24s: idea of building these trades now so
569.60s: when I'm going through and I'm deciding
571.76s: let's just start with ratio called
573.56s: diagonals this is a really simple
575.20s: structure essentially what I'm going to
576.96s: do is select the product that I want to
580.08s: trade and then I'm going to figure out
581.56s: where I think it might go to some of us
583.52s: might think it's moas some of us might
585.48s: think it could be another run up above
587.20s: 45 whatever your profit Target is then
589.92s: I'm going to start modeling trades off
591.72s: of that the important part of defining a
593.68s: profit Target is so that you don't do
595.84s: this where let's say we get in when
597.92s: Gamestop is down here at 10s it goes up
600.08s: to 64 and then it comes back down and
602.24s: then we're just still in it not saying
604.52s: get out not saying completely move away
606.36s: but what I am saying is that if you do
608.72s: this you showed a massive profit that
611.72s: then went away and again if it's some
613.60s: sort of long-term buy and whole trade
615.40s: for you that's a completely different
616.60s: strategy this is talking about trading
618.52s: these movements so you need a way to get
621.24s: out when it's at a favorable price or
623.36s: even reverse the position to take it to
625.00s: the other side so what I tend to do is
627.44s: look at a few different choices but the
629.64s: very first thing we have to decide on
631.20s: when buying call options is how far out
633.84s: in time do we want to go because if you
636.40s: are too close in time Theta Decay is
639.84s: very very high so I try to balance a few
643.16s: things because if you'll notice the
644.96s: Theta Decay curve here it really starts
647.72s: to accelerate once we get within 30 days
650.36s: to expiration I don't necessarily want
653.36s: that the other problem is gamma gamma is
656.36s: the rate of change of Delta and if we're
659.04s: bu buing options we want gamma it's how
661.56s: our options start to compound so the way
663.64s: that I think about it is if I want to
665.64s: maintain a position in GameStop I'm
667.72s: going to use options that are slightly
669.72s: further out in time I'm going to use
671.60s: options that are actually slightly in
673.80s: the money why do I do this because they
675.60s: have a higher Delta so they're going to
677.32s: move better dollar for dooll with the
679.52s: underlying these are going to be more
681.00s: expensive so I have to account for that
683.40s: UPF front but I can always add what I
686.76s: like to call kicker options which would
689.04s: be combining it if movement starts to
691.92s: happen so let's say I establish that
693.52s: position now cuz I think it's at an
694.80s: overall good price level right then if
697.28s: it starts to show volume exceeding the
699.40s: 5-day average and it's starting to look
701.04s: bullish well then in that case I can
702.92s: come back in and I could say well maybe
704.24s: I'll go out like 30 days or 20 days and
706.80s: then I'll pick up some options that are
709.64s: maybe like a 30 Delta something like
711.84s: that now what's the problem with just
713.40s: grabbing these they're way cheaper they
715.04s: look awesome there's a problem notice
717.28s: how high the Theta Decay is it's 3 cents
720.08s: which might not sound like a ton $3 but
722.84s: as a percentage of the remaining premium
724.96s: it's actually quite massive so this is
727.48s: why if we take a look at an example here
730.28s: this is looking at that one single in
733.48s: the money option and let's say we get
735.20s: that move up to 45 up here if we get
738.00s: that we make 2,200 bucks not bad we're
740.28s: putting up $480 to make that that's
742.68s: great we would make way more money if we
745.08s: buy the 27th September 212 calls so
748.40s: slightly out of the money for 49 because
750.92s: they're so cheap we essentially can get
752.92s: 10 of those for the price we get one of
754.72s: the other ones and then if we get that
756.16s: move to 45 well now we make
759.24s: $23,000 that sounds pretty damn good
762.64s: doesn't it but again there's a problem
764.84s: here's the problem watch as I fast
767.24s: forward time just a little bit if I go
769.68s: forward let's say to the 25th of
772.88s: September notice what happens to my
774.72s: options they essentially start decaying
778.04s: away to nothing and then they have to
780.72s: have a much bigger move in order to make
783.80s: the same amount of money and then as we
785.92s: talked about before there's an
787.96s: overwhelming probability of instances
790.08s: where we don't actually get the big move
792.36s: so then if you continue buying these
794.16s: cheap out of-the money options you're
795.80s: going to cycle through them repeatedly
797.60s: until hopefully sooner or later it hits
799.96s: but how much will have been lost in that
801.76s: process which is exactly why I prefer to
804.56s: trade something like this it doesn't
807.00s: make as much money but it doesn't lose
809.20s: anywhere near as much money as time
811.12s: passes and I make more money off of
814.16s: smaller moves that allow me to slowly
816.80s: build my account versus eroding it and
819.56s: then when I see interesting conditions I
821.56s: can add those kicker options so the way
824.44s: to think about picking an expiration is
826.88s: the more time you give yourself the
828.88s: better off you're going to be in terms
830.40s: of letting the trade work but it's going
832.44s: to be more expensive the other thing you
834.00s: do is when you go further out in time
835.76s: you might be incentivized or think it's
837.88s: better well maybe I'll go further in
839.28s: time but get these cheap options well
841.00s: the problem with the cheap options is
842.72s: they will have lower gamma being further
845.44s: out in time so if I show you gamma this
847.96s: is showing you two different expirations
849.64s: this is showing you 10 DTE versus 30 DTE
852.04s: and if you go to like 60 it's even
853.36s: further down here so the problem is if
855.48s: gamma is too low and you have a low
857.92s: Delta so let's take a look at these 34s
860.52s: for example if GameStop goes up by a
862.52s: dollar my options will appreciate by 30
864.96s: cents and then my Delta will gain by
867.92s: three so this will go from 30 to 33 it's
871.44s: not bad but compare that to these 18s
873.84s: that I was modeling in the other trade
875.56s: in this case if GameStop goes up by a
878.08s: doll the premium will change by7 cents
881.44s: or $70 and then I'll gain four gamma so
884.96s: I'll get a little bit more gamma and on
887.24s: a dollar for dooll move I'll make more
889.00s: but here's the trade-off it's more money
890.96s: upfront your money is not going to
892.84s: compound as much compare that to the
895.12s: inverse if you buy further out of the
897.08s: money options no matter if it's closer
899.08s: far they're going to Decay more quickly
901.12s: and if it's a lower Delta and further
903.24s: out in time they're less sensitive to
905.24s: price movements so then you stand to
906.84s: make less overall this is the beauty of
909.28s: trading options and for me the answer
911.64s: for something like this is pretty simple
913.36s: I would essentially structure long calls
915.72s: via something further out in time I
917.56s: would probably sell some near-term short
920.00s: calls against it to help subsidize the
922.28s: cost and I would do it at a ratio this
924.44s: is what makes it a ratio called diagonal
926.68s: so for example if I add these calls
929.76s: against my Longs but instead of just
931.52s: having one let's say I put on five of
933.68s: them and then I sell two calls against
935.96s: it so now I have a leveraged long
937.96s: position I'm collecting some Theta from
940.60s: these short calls and then when the move
943.04s: eventually starts to happen then I can
945.00s: come in closer in time again maybe this
947.40s: 24 31 DTE and then add some kicker
950.72s: options that are further out of the
951.96s: money higher probability of losing the
954.28s: investment but if I do get the move then
956.56s: they make a bunch of money make sure you
958.12s: have a system to capture it because
960.16s: again it doesn't do you any good to hold
962.32s: options that are decaying assets have
964.28s: them show a really great profit and then
966.16s: watch The Profit go away not saying you
967.88s: have to book a full win every single
969.64s: time there is an entire world around
971.44s: managing partial parts of your trades
973.12s: setting stop losses but the name of the
974.96s: game is to do something and if we're
976.72s: interested in learning more about that
978.08s: let me know we can do a follow- on video
980.00s: now the last thing that we have to cover
981.88s: is how do we manage the downside because
985.24s: options are decaying assets so for me I
988.60s: typically typically will set price
990.24s: levels that if something starts dropping
992.36s: below them then I will either start
994.16s: pairing my position down or I'll flatten
996.36s: it entirely and just say I'm
998.00s: directionally wrong if you are using
999.92s: longer term options you can give
1001.28s: yourself a much wider window but sooner
1004.00s: or later you have to do something with
1005.88s: the options because otherwise they will
1007.76s: Decay away into nothing so taking them
1010.24s: all the way to expiration typically is
1011.92s: not a great idea so the simplest
1013.88s: approach for me like I said is literally
1015.48s: just setting alerts like this and if I
1017.96s: get alert to the the upside or the
1019.48s: downside then I'll move a stop up and
1022.08s: continue to track the profits like that
1024.24s: and if it's on the loss side I'll set a
1026.52s: defined period that I will get out and
1028.64s: then if it starts going back up I'll get
1030.76s: right back in but what I don't want to
1032.16s: do is hold the asset as it's decaying
1035.08s: because then it makes it more and more
1036.64s: difficult to make money until next time
1038.92s: be an outlier I'll see you all later
