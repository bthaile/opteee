0.00s: What's up, outliers, apes, ape outliers.
3.72s: Today's all about GameStop.
5.04s: And it's because I want to one talk about where we are today.
10.16s: I want to recap what we've learned so far from analyzing all of our K's old trades.
17.16s: And then I want to talk to you about some analysis that I want to integrate into the Saturday
23.32s: live stream going forward because there's a lot that we have to do from my perspective
28.28s: in terms of what I'm trying to learn.
29.96s: So we have a lot to get through.
32.72s: And let's dive right in.
33.72s: So we'll first do quick current state analysis of GameStop, which is a little bit of a downtrend.
38.72s: It's been down five days in a row consecutively.
42.80s: And it's hovering right around 21 right now closed at 2090.
46.84s: One of the things I want to know is that there is a volume node that lives right in here
52.52s: at about 20 and a half.
55.28s: So to me, this looks like the next near term target.
58.24s: And then depending on how it behaves around that near term target, again, we'll see.
62.24s: And as always, I want to remind you, when I draw these lines, it's not pinpoint precision.
67.12s: Right?
68.12s: These are always kind of ranges.
69.28s: The way to think about when I draw a line like that is that it really represents this
73.32s: kind of zone.
74.80s: The reason for that is I'm using the width of the volume profile to determine where I
79.40s: think price is likely to get stuck around.
82.44s: And if so, to what degree?
84.56s: Now if we take a look at small caps, small caps have been also trending down.
90.56s: So this just adds a little bit of overall pressure as far as I'm concerned to something
95.20s: like GameStop.
96.40s: Now there's one thing that I'm actually very excited about, which is if we take a look
101.24s: at the current open interest, these dries.
104.76s: There's 650,000 calls against just 284,000 puts.
111.48s: We're still seeing this huge skew, but it starts to get a little more interesting now.
118.12s: Because if we take a look across where a lot of this OI is, it's here in 18 October.
127.72s: That starts to get way more interesting because if we look at the overall exposure in 18
135.16s: October, it's 273,000 calls against 92,000 puts.
141.46s: So we're actually starting to see a pretty stark contrast call put OI variance.
149.66s: And it's starting to look closer and closer in time.
153.98s: Now it's centralizing in 18 October, which is quite meaningful.
158.42s: Now in terms of overall options activity, there was a ton of calls traded today, 99,000.
165.02s: Again, 17,000 puts.
167.30s: Most of those calls were sold because they came in at the bid or below.
172.82s: And on the put side, a lot of those were bought 34%.
177.02s: So bit of a mixed bag as far as I'm concerned with respect to today's overall activity,
182.58s: other than the fact that this is a ton of calls still that are moving.
185.62s: That is a whole whole lot of calls.
188.10s: Now looking across the volatility in the chains, I see really muted volatility literally
194.74s: across the entire board.
196.34s: Nothing is above 100%.
198.14s: That is very rare.
200.10s: And in my opinion, this is one of those times where it just feels like a matter of time
205.66s: until something happens.
207.74s: And again, it's just because I eat not even earnings is over 100%, which is rare for something
212.70s: like this.
213.70s: Normally, you can see exactly where earnings is because vol is elevated around that period.
220.38s: So I find how quiet volatility here is to be quite interesting.
224.90s: If we take a look at average daily ranges on the five days, 4%, 20 days, 5, 90 days,
232.30s: 9.3.
233.30s: So obviously average daily range tightening up quite a lot.
237.86s: And then if we look at the average true range, that's also tightened up quite a lot as
243.90s: far as I can see.
245.34s: So 90 days was about 11.2%.
247.78s: 20 days, 5.6.
250.18s: And then five days, 4.2.
251.86s: So this is if you picture Bollinger bands, they're getting tight.
255.46s: That's essentially all this is showing me in number formats, a little quicker for me to
259.86s: see.
260.86s: So that's that volume did tick up a little bit today.
264.58s: So the last two days before today, we had 4.6, 5.3.
269.50s: Now we are at 5.9.
271.30s: So almost six.
272.98s: That's a nice slight uptick in volume.
274.94s: I don't love the look of this candle because this is pretty much one-sided selling pressure
279.50s: most of the day.
280.78s: And we can see that represented 88% sale volume, no surprise there.
284.66s: And then a quick peak at RSI.
287.42s: It does show us rotating over the right now.
291.82s: It's red because it's crossing below the moving average of the RSI.
296.42s: And right now I'm using a seven day moving average for RSI.
300.26s: Both of them are negative sloping, so kind of negative overall oscillator presence here,
305.58s: which is just kind of a momentum indicator for me.
308.78s: Now let's take a quick look at the volume that we've seen.
312.50s: I want to look at two spots, the first one.
315.66s: Looking at unusual whales, just sorting today by premium super quiet.
321.06s: We had one series of transactions out in 25 January 2025 for 100K, everything else is
328.54s: tiny.
329.54s: So there is really nothing to talk about in here.
332.46s: And then if we take a look at the dark pool really quick for GameStop, see if anything
336.78s: interesting was going on in here.
340.58s: And I'm going to sort this by premium as well.
345.38s: Overall it looks quiet.
348.34s: Yeah, very, very quiet.
349.74s: We only have one trade over a million.
351.70s: There's a handful, you know, several hundred thousand dollars worth, which is kind of standard
356.22s: fair.
357.22s: And then the other thing, just out of curiosity, we have to look and see if there's
359.46s: those 5,000 blocks.
360.46s: Again, that's more just out of curiosity.
362.38s: It's not because I think anything too highly about it.
366.18s: Let's drop five hundred five thousand in here.
369.86s: And there's still there.
371.02s: So we have much less, but I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
376.70s: ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
379.06s: So this leads into the next part of the analysis that I want to continue going forward.
384.02s: Because we had a really interesting conversation during the live stream on Saturday about
388.54s: roaring kiddies, old trades, and then again, like piecing together what could have happened.
393.58s: Now there's one thing I have to be abundantly clear about.
397.14s: When I'm analyzing things, there are two buckets in my mind.
401.54s: There's the bucket of I can decisively prove this.
405.78s: That is true verifiable information.
409.50s: Then there's the bucket of I think this might be, but I can't directly prove it.
415.86s: And I know I can't prove it.
417.70s: But when I'm analyzing the cat's movements right now, as I go through the current state
423.34s: analysis of his trades, I am far more interested in this first bucket of what I know I can
431.22s: prove by looking at his yellow updates, by looking at movement and GME price.
437.38s: The reason why I care about that is because one of the giant theories we're trying to explore
442.66s: is RK's methodology.
445.10s: And did he find some sort of secret code that helps him predict movement?
450.62s: Because there's a ton of different variations out there around it.
455.38s: And all of it is we're not able to decisively prove it, but I want to see how close we
461.74s: can get because there's a lot of information that alludes towards something leading like
466.86s: yes.
467.86s: But then there's also a lot of information again that leads to no.
471.82s: So for example, as we look through a lot of his old trades, one of the things that I find
478.14s: really, really interesting is how much the portfolio volatility actually is.
485.50s: And it makes a ton of sense, right?
487.18s: He calls it his yellow updates yellow.
490.06s: You expect a lot of volatility in a yellow play.
493.38s: So when I'm looking at stuff like this, I clearly can see that there's not a hyper-specific
499.86s: timing mechanism in this period.
502.46s: I want to emphasize this period because this is looking back at 2020 and 2021.
507.98s: And again, the reason why I don't think that there's a specific timing mechanism is because
512.38s: I can see the portfolio up here reaches 2.3 million and then it contracts down to 1.3
519.98s: less than about two weeks later, right?
521.94s: Like if you have specific dates that you're playing something, you don't let your portfolio
526.90s: do that.
527.90s: And it's not out of the context of trying to make as much money as possible because I
532.54s: don't think that's our case ultimate motive here.
535.78s: But I think in terms of playing the game and beating the game and adding as much pressure
540.26s: and being able to accumulate as much game stock stock is possible.
545.86s: You do that through more capital, right?
548.26s: So when I look at the ultimate motivating factor as far as it looks like in terms of him
552.26s: accumulating his stock position and stuff like that, you would want more money to do that.
556.54s: So then if you have some sort of really great timing tool, you wouldn't go through this
559.86s: kind of portfolio volatility because when you go down to 1.3 million, when you get back
564.02s: up here to 3.2, essentially, if you don't lose that million dollar, this 3.2 now can become
571.06s: three, well, four and a half or almost five because there's the compounding effect of
575.50s: that capital not going through drawdowns.
578.02s: So this is the old stuff.
579.58s: We're just now getting to his updated trades.
584.42s: And one, we're going through and reconstructed and we've already done this, reconstructed
589.50s: this entire block of positions that you see here, the 5 million shares, and then the
594.66s: 120,000 calls we can track all of them.
597.74s: We can see when they were entered, what the cumulative premium was at the point in time
601.94s: that he was entering, what was game stopped price, we have all of that.
605.50s: So again, this is the first bucket.
607.42s: This is the stuff I can decisively track, prove, add up, do math and see.
612.86s: Now we have a really interesting scenario where I want to analyze, and this is part of
619.14s: the analysis I want to do on the next series, or the next session on Saturday, is I actually
624.34s: want to go through not just his old trades, but I've been purposefully going all the way
632.66s: back into 2023, starting here, and I'm going to go back further.
639.02s: But what I'm doing is I'm analyzing the trade behavior and the premium amounts around
643.78s: different moves in game stops.
645.98s: So if I slide this over here and I zoom this out further, we go out to three years daily.
650.98s: I can find different periods where game stops started rattling for different reasons,
655.66s: whether it's for earnings, whether it's kind of this post earnings gap, and I'm analyzing
660.50s: the stock movement in these periods.
664.14s: And what I want to see specifically is what kind of corresponding options activity was
670.54s: there?
671.54s: Because one of the things people have said is like, oh, the options chains were dead before
677.14s: the cat came back.
679.06s: And I've heard that said, I don't know if it's true.
682.26s: So I want to go through and look and explore it and see what dead means.
687.42s: Because as I cursory flip through this, they're really not dead around a lot of these
692.46s: periods.
693.46s: So in our periods that I found where they're completely dead for like an entire month,
697.70s: the biggest trade is 80K in April of 23.
701.70s: But as soon as I see different kind of movement patterns and what I'm going to do is de-conflict
705.74s: by time, I'm going to see, are we seeing these options trades getting built out and then
710.62s: the move?
711.62s: Or are we starting to see signs of a move?
713.70s: Then options trades get built out.
715.22s: And I'm going to do this all the way back to 2021.
718.90s: So that's the next step in the analysis.
720.86s: I'm super excited because I am a giant fucking nerd and this stuff's so damn interesting
727.46s: to me.
728.46s: So I'm excited to see what we can learn as we go through all of these and track them
732.78s: discreetly like this here.
734.18s: Look at this.
735.18s: There's this was in June of 2023, the seventh of June.
740.70s: So then when I go in there and I look at that, I was like, okay, well, let me find the
743.78s: seventh of June in 2023.
746.42s: I have to squish this in a little bit.
748.58s: So it's easier.
749.82s: Let's go 2023 June.
754.98s: Here's the seventh.
759.18s: So this was an earnings play it looks like, gap down, but then it shot right back up
763.26s: out.
764.26s: So what I'm going to do is actually track not just the entrances for these trades, but
768.66s: I'm going to find the exits and see when we exited we being aware of this is and try
774.58s: to analyze some of this stuff because again, like around earnings here, this is hyperactive,
778.82s: relative to the timeframe to be clear, this is not dead in my opinion.
782.54s: There's still several million in options being traded throughout the month.
786.38s: Now again, this pales in comparison to when the cat came back with his war chest of hundreds
791.70s: of millions of dollars, but this is exactly what I want to explore because I'm so curious
797.74s: what these options change looked like in different periods.
800.54s: So I've actually started exporting all of this data into Python so that I can do my standard
805.98s: manipulation a little bit easier, but then on the live stream will go through literally
810.14s: period by period just like that so that we can see because literally just because the
815.34s: shit's interesting.
816.46s: So that's my game plan.
817.82s: As always, anything you need, let me know, be an outlier and I will see you all to live
821.54s: stream.
822.54s: Catch you later.
