 These options trading just gambling. The goal of the video today is to talk through this idea and to help you understand the nuance differences between gambling, investing, trading. And then at the end of the video, I'm going to walk you through some key questions. You should be able to ask yourself and respond to tell the difference if you are gambling, trading, investing, so on, so forth. It's up everyone. Welcome back to the Outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family outlier pros. They make all this stuff possible. And let's dig in. The first thing you see here are just a couple definitions. We have gambling, which is to play games of chance for money or to bet. Take risky action in the hope of a desired result. What do you notice about some of those terms? Well, let's take a look at a comparison investing. And money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result by putting it into different financial instruments. What's the big difference between these? Well, when we look at gambling, we have things like play games, chance for money. We have things like risky action, hope of a result, completely different. So when we think about the broader context of gambling versus trading versus investing, there's this key change, key difference when you look between them. And the change is both in the system you're interacting with, how it's built, but then also the change in your mindset as a participant. Very frequently, when we look at things like gambling, it's specifically for entertainment, very often at shorter term, not always. There's essentially no skill required. You can be skilled as a gambler. That's a different story we'll talk about later. But your performance is mostly going to be a result of luck of some sort when a system that is negative expected value. So what's the difference between investing and trading? Well, trading in my world is just a subset of investing. That's all. Trading is the application way more actively involved. For example, in the stock market, we call that trading if you're holding things less than a year. Investing in the stock market sense is when we're holding things for longer than a year. But trading is a form of investing. It's when we're trying to use our capital to generate a return. So you can see really that the key difference are tied to both the system and then the behavior. But as you know, there are a million. Different examples where people in the options markets are very clearly gambling. So we have people that like this, they bought 20 of the 175 calls yesterday to swing into 10 day for 23 cents each sold when it dropped to 19 before the market closed. They got scared. The contract is worth now 530. So in this case, it's actually funny because this isn't even really that big of a loss to start. But they're talking about the loss of perceived profit. And this goes into what we refer to as YOLO. And we'll talk about that in a second. We have our favorite from Wall Street bets. You can go there anyway. Any time and find tons of just massive losing trades. This is again, is typically based on YOLOing. So when we're talking about the concept of gambling and trading, this is when we have things integrated like hope when we're actively bouncing between all these different styles without much research or care. Obviously, when we're risking lots and lots of money on different trades, whether it's high probability, low probability, there's not really a risk management approach. And there's a lot of goal deluxe analysis where it's we're kind of just focusing on the outcome that we want versus what might actually happen. So let's talk a little bit now about when options trading is not gambling. And what you see here is a plot of my return performance from my start of trading in 2007 until today. So you can see, for example, in 2007, I underperformed the market. I return negative 1.1%, whereas the market returned 5.46%. And you can see this trend over time, but we'll notice is in the aggregate, I actually outperformed the market. And if we look at it on a compound annual growth rate, pretty significantly. So now if I bar off these last two years because these are anomalous, by the way, and I don't consider this in line with my total performance, this is way more representative of my performance. My compound annual growth rate is like the low to mid 20%. And that's a little less than double what the stock market might be for the same reference range. The reason why this matters is because you can absolutely trade options at a professional level as a retail trader difference between institution and retail, but make this something that you can generate consistent money from and treat it effectively as a business. So let's talk about when options trading is not gambling. Now the first line here might be confusing sports betting poker. What I'm trying to show you is that you can even have instances in something that typically is considered gambling that has a professional approach applied to it. There are entire sports betting firms that make a lot of money by betting on sports. Same thing for poker. If you play poker poorly, then you might lose a bunch of money. But you can actually be a professional poker player and do really well. You can create your own positive expected value, even in things that might be more aligned with what we would typically think is gambling. Now in the options world specifically, things like having a defined edge in positive expected return edge is one of these nebulous terms that gets thrown around all the time. Effectively, it is your ability to generate returns consistently. Now some people will argue edge means you have to beat the market and stuff like that. And maybe, maybe not. What I care most about in the context of this is how consistent you're able to produce as a trader. And that matters tremendously because it's how you eventually scale your operation. Risk management is a must. You can't trade no money. So by making sure that you're paying close attention to what your risk is, and it's similar again in gambling. In gambling, you can show up with a set bankroll and manage your risk for the night. I like going to Las Vegas periodically and playing games like Crap's. At no point do I think I'm going to make a bunch of money playing that. It's for entertainment. But in order to manage my risk, I decide how much I'm going to use. Well, in the trading sense, that gets amplified. You have to come up with risk management protocols for your portfolio for your individual strategies, thus the individual trades. I have videos that talk about risk management. We'll link to those in the notes below. Next thing, big difference. And again, this can exist in gambling, but it must exist in options trading, which is probabilistic assessments of what's going to happen. That's one of the coolest things about options when we look at things like trading options is if we take a look at VLO because it happens to be up right now. And we go over to the options chain. The first thing that you'll notice is all of these have a probability of being in the money, a probability of a touch. The other thing that you'll notice we can look at is actual probabilistic projections going forward based on options pricing. So you literally can make clear decisions based on actual probabilistic information. That is a key benchmark of trading options. The next one is Bayesian analysis. What this means is we're going to come up with the best possible idea that we can up front. And then his new information enters the systems. We're going to update the probabilities. This also happens in things like professional sports betting, but it's a big difference between something like gambling, where if you're playing something like blackjack or if you're playing something like a slot, those will have fixed probabilities at certain points in time. Blackjack obviously is evolving as the count of the deck changes, but trading is continuous. And the probabilistic landscape is continuous. It's nondiscreet. Hope does not exist in your plan and you have documentation. You have things like a defined trading plan, which is similar to a business plan. I have a link that talks about trading plans. Same thing with trade logs. This is an iterative process. A giant difference between trading options and gambling is you're going to take the outcomes to then try and amplify your future performance. It's a learning model. Whereas if I'm playing something like a slot machine, there's nothing I can take from the prior outcome to make a guess about the next outcome unless you do that at a professional level, which does exist. There are people that have ways to measure the likelihood of a payout, but that's a really small group. The main point here is that in the world of trading, it's an iterative process. And this is why you'll see me talk about things like the outlier strategy process. This is how we build a strategy, the outlier trade process. This is how we take that strategy and then implement it in place, a trade. So now here are five questions. You can ask yourself to then weigh whether or not you as a trader are gambling or not. First one is when you place a trade, do you know the different potential outcomes for your trade? So going back to this example, if we happen to put on our trade in VLO and we see that, let's say we're selling puts and we think it's going to go up. It doesn't look like it, but let's just pretend that's the scenario. Well, a lot of people might say, well, I think it's going to go up. Well, that is one scenario. Another scenario is it can go down despite what you want it to do. So the point here is being able to objectively analyze the potential path of a trade and the number two is to attach a probabilistic waiting is to what you think is more likely to happen than another condition. The most important part here is to think through the trade end to end in depth. That's number three. Once you think through it end to end in depth, start to finish, you now have a bit of a game plan up front. So they're not just kind of going off the cuff and hoping that something works out because one of the things you saw earlier with that trader that was really upset about the profits that they never had but missed is that people that are going to be able to do that. That don't have a plan based on a strategy, whether it's multiple strategies or not, that is positively expected or really prone to things like yoloing things like FOMO fear of missing out. And it's because they feel like they were so close to this opportunity that then just vanish. They just missed it. But the reality is trading is built on the deployment of a skill set, not over one instance two instance ten instance hundred instances, but literally thousands. So it's all about the process. Another thing that you should be able to answer literally at all times is what is your total portfolio risk and how would your entire portfolio all collectively, even if it's a bunch of different options trades, how would it all behave as the market move? Now obviously this isn't an exhaustive list, but this is the kind of thing that if you're placing a trade and you can't answer these, you say something like, do I know I'm going to plan manage this trade start to finish and you say no. That's not good. That is moving you closer and closer to that world of gambling. Now specifically for number three, that doesn't mean that you have it all written out if this, then this, if this, then this, you can do that. But the other thing is long as you have general ideas, guidelines that you know you're going to follow. And when you're placing a trade, you should have a pretty good idea of what your risk is, what your profit potential is. That's a big part of the management plan of a trade. If we go back to this, you'll notice the decisions you have to make for an option straight the first two max risk and profit. You have to figure out how you're going to manage your position. So you should be able to very easily answer at least all of these. There's a lot of skill that can be employed, that can yield pretty positive results in the long run. As always, if you have any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
