0.00s: What is up, ape nation and the outliers, ape outliers,
6.00s: kind of the combination thereof.
8.52s: Hopefully we have a little bit of a healthy mix
10.92s: in the house today.
11.92s: I'm gonna grab the chat, move it over here
13.56s: so I can say hello and keep up with you all.
18.20s: So the agenda for today is a few things.
23.04s: The first thing I wanna do is kind of work through
28.04s: some homework that I'm trying to piece together,
32.52s: specifically looking at the behavior of GameStop
37.24s: before previous significant moves.
41.40s: So essentially what I'm literally doing right now
43.92s: as I'm talking to you is I'm going into bar charts,
47.64s: I have an account with them to gain access
50.84s: to some daily stock data.
53.20s: Well, you don't even need it.
54.04s: You can get it from Yahoo Finance whoever you want.
55.56s: Just tell me where I'm getting the data from.
57.60s: And I'm gonna download daily GME data
62.20s: from 2000 to present.
64.56s: So today the 24th of August,
67.88s: and I'm downloading it right now.
69.72s: And I'm essentially gonna start a process
73.48s: in the background while I'm doing this.
75.60s: And I'm gonna run it through a bit of a process
78.40s: that's gonna help me identify all of the periods
82.88s: where GameStop had a price appreciation
86.52s: of at least 100%.
88.28s: That's my initial thought.
89.76s: And literally I'm doing it now as we speak.
92.48s: So if there's other permutations that you're interested in,
95.32s: let me know.
96.40s: We can take a look at others at the same time.
99.16s: But what I'm doing now is you've probably heard me talk
101.92s: about this idea of like finger printing.
104.28s: And I don't know, it's just kind of the term
107.72s: that comes to my mind, it's not actually anything
109.44s: that's like widely accepted to mean anything.
111.52s: But for me, finger printing is just part of creating
115.96s: an identity for something that's unique to that thing.
119.32s: That's kind of the whole idea of a fingerprint
120.92s: is that it's unique to you.
122.40s: So what I'm working on right now is taking a look
126.52s: at some of GME's fingerprint around some of the larger moves.
131.52s: Because the last couple of sessions I've been spending time
134.48s: and hopefully we can spend time on this one as well.
137.24s: But learning about the background,
138.64s: learning about the players, learning about Rory and Kitty,
141.12s: learning about the way he posts,
142.84s: learning about the positions based on what he posts, right?
147.76s: To give me a bunch of just different contextual understanding
151.36s: of how this whole thing works.
153.32s: So now that I have at least a rudimentary,
156.88s: and I highlight that, it's rudimentary.
158.92s: I still do not consider myself somebody
161.52s: that really knows much about this story,
164.76s: which is why I'm still spending so much time learning about it.
169.84s: So while I have a bit of an understanding of the background,
174.48s: what I'm trying to do is get a better sense now
176.72s: of the actual movements we experience
179.60s: and what it looks like when those movements are happening.
183.40s: Because so far, there's been one universal component
188.88s: to everything I've seen so far with GameStop
191.16s: when it comes to a move.
192.48s: Every single time I've seen it make a move,
195.44s: is I see volume expand meaningfully before the move happens.
202.72s: So in this case, there's kind of like a pre-move,
205.68s: I guess I should say, because there's still a massive move.
208.76s: So if we look here on the second of May,
211.32s: the range that we had high to low was 1288 to 1096.
215.80s: So it's like a two-point range.
217.36s: That doesn't sound crazy,
218.76s: but if you look at that as a percentage
220.92s: of the value of the product, that's not insignificant.
224.40s: More importantly than that,
225.68s: if we take a look at the average daily ranges
228.44s: preceding that, it's much lower.
230.56s: What I find more important is if I look at the volume
234.76s: on the day before the big move,
237.60s: in this case kind of this first leg up,
239.96s: I'll refer to it as on the first of May,
242.88s: the volume was 2.6 million shares traded.
247.28s: And for broader context,
249.24s: the five-day average trading volume before this
253.76s: was 4.3 million shares.
256.68s: So that's about what it's looking like on average.
259.88s: The 20-day average at that point was 3.7 million shares.
262.68s: So you can see that in a nutshell,
265.56s: the average volume was somewhere
267.60s: about four million shares call it.
269.44s: Then on the second, the volume literally doubles.
273.24s: It doubles off of the five-day average,
276.16s: and it takes us from four million change up to 8.6 million.
280.88s: Then the day after that,
282.56s: it goes to 36 million shares traded.
288.08s: So again, quick recap over the past three days
292.00s: in this scenario, on the first of May,
294.84s: we go from 2.6 million to 8.6 million to 36 million.
300.40s: That behavior is interesting to me.
303.60s: And the reason why that behavior's interesting to me
305.68s: is because one of the biggest things I'm interested in
308.84s: with GameStop beyond the story,
310.56s: beyond the background is trading it.
312.76s: And the movements it has.
315.52s: And while I think the last time I was doing a live stream
319.24s: about this, somebody was just like,
320.52s: yeah, okay, genius, like you're looking at a historic move.
324.12s: Of course, you can see the volume expanding.
325.92s: But the broader point that I'm trying to highlight
329.00s: for you in the conversation is that this behavior
332.60s: of expanding volume is the signal.
336.24s: It is what I look for to precipitate the move.
341.12s: So anyways, I'm gonna run this data through from 2000 to 2024.
345.56s: And I wanna see find the occurrences.
352.96s: And I'm just doing this through the data analyst and GPTX.
355.92s: They can run the data that I have really easy
359.12s: find the occurrences where either,
362.92s: let's do a day over day volume,
366.56s: where day over day volume expands by at least 100%.
376.40s: Also, I'm gonna do find the dates.
380.36s: Because that's what really what we want.
382.84s: Find and list.
386.76s: Also do the same for where
390.60s: Intraday price movement exceeds 100%.
399.28s: Oh, let's do 50% there, something a little bit lighter.
403.72s: So that'll start running for us.
406.24s: And while that's getting underway,
407.80s: I'd love to say hello to everybody.
409.00s: So we got Reese Tanner, our friend H Steelio.
414.40s: Oh shit, that's a hard one.
418.36s: You guys have to coach me on this one.
421.00s: RBLD.
422.48s: So I see dark side, DRK side.
425.60s: I don't know how to read RBL.
429.40s: Not like Roblox.
430.96s: What the fuck do you get through RBL?
432.36s: I get the dark side.
433.32s: I get the dark side AI.
435.00s: Rebel.
436.00s: Oh, Jonathan, you might be on it.
438.60s: Jonathan, that's soup that that literally might be it.
441.36s: Is that it?
443.56s: Come on, Rebel, dark side AI.
444.88s: Don't leave us hanging.
447.24s: Right now the riddle I'm trying to solve
448.96s: is deciphering your name.
450.04s: See this time you could tell it's a GME live stream.
451.92s: I'm immediately just reading into everything
454.36s: and trying to solve whatever puzzle,
456.44s: random ass puzzle apparently is presented to me,
459.24s: which right now is this dude's name.
461.68s: It's the big puzzle of the moment for me.
466.36s: Rebel dark side.
467.36s: Nice job, Jonathan.
468.80s: Good job.
469.64s: So I was able to do the easy part and identify dark side.
473.00s: So I don't think I get really any credit for that.
474.88s: That's kind of easy.
476.04s: But Jonathan crushed it on the rebel part that's spun on.
480.28s: Good work out of you.
481.84s: All right, cool.
482.96s: So Rebel dark side says I'm not gonna lie.
486.32s: It's so manipulated GME, but why though
489.84s: is it that institutions never got out of their shorts?
493.20s: That's a fantastic question.
495.04s: And the manipulation in GME is,
499.80s: it's another reason why I'm so fascinated in the product
503.16s: to be completely straightforward with you.
506.96s: I trade for, it's how I make a living is through trading.
511.48s: So the main part of what I'm doing with trading
514.56s: is trying to find ways to make money, right?
518.00s: Like just like anybody else.
520.00s: However, with something like GameStop,
524.44s: it really highlights a whole other undertone
529.08s: of what's going on in markets.
531.40s: And I don't want to say I view it as a canary in the coal mine
534.48s: because there's other canaries with it,
536.24s: but it is kind of like that,
538.08s: where this is a purely clean example that again,
542.32s: like you guys know me hopefully well enough by now
544.76s: where I'm not into being super hyperbolic
547.76s: and I'm not into making decisions or assumptions
551.76s: off of really broken partial data.
553.92s: I'll explore it always,
556.24s: but I'm not gonna look at something that essentially 90%
560.44s: looks like it might be the case and then conclude,
562.76s: it is the case unless I can actually prove it
565.56s: with some sort of evidence, qualitative, quantitative,
568.04s: I don't care, but something other than just conjecture
571.52s: and my opinion in GameStop is fascinating
574.92s: because it is one of those things that I can look at
579.40s: and I can discreetly identify this exact behavior
584.92s: that there is something wrong that happens with the product.
589.00s: Like I can see it and I can quantify it.
592.36s: So I am really blown away with kind of how blatant
599.40s: the bullshit is with GameStop.
601.20s: That's one of the craziest things to me.
604.08s: It's like hiding in plain sight,
606.12s: the fact that there's been movies about it,
608.96s: there's been shit on Netflix about it
611.36s: and it still seems to be,
613.60s: I don't know how severe it's happening now
616.76s: because it's hard for me to quantify.
618.92s: But some shit's going on that I can clearly identify
622.52s: and that part's super frustrating.
624.72s: So going back to the question on why the institutions
628.12s: never got out of their shorts,
629.92s: I don't know how many did or didn't.
631.60s: Let's take a quick look because actually,
633.88s: if I were to guess, I believe a good number probably did,
637.96s: especially with the at the money.
640.92s: That's my guess.
643.12s: And then it looks like we have holy shit.
648.92s: So right now I'm essentially looking at the data
651.32s: that I was telling you all about.
654.40s: And it's blowing my mind right now
655.84s: if I'm being honest with you.
660.28s: Okay, quiz question.
663.32s: For volume expanding by at least 100%
670.12s: over the past essentially 24 years
673.52s: looking at GameStop from 2000 to today.
677.64s: How many occurrences do you think volume day over day
683.08s: expanded by at least 100%
689.60s: because it's a little more than I expected.
695.44s: 42, it's a great guess.
697.72s: It's not even close though.
699.08s: I honestly would have been closer to your guess.
701.56s: I was a little higher.
702.40s: I was thinking, I was thinking maybe,
706.28s: yeah, I don't want to give you my answer.
709.64s: Jonathan says between 69 and 420,
711.92s: which are fantastic numbers,
713.20s: but unfortunately we have to play by prices right rules.
715.96s: Also, cheers.
716.88s: I'm starting out with some liquid IV,
718.64s: keeping the old hydration up while I'm working
720.68s: through this bullshit hernated disc.
725.76s: Also, in case you guys didn't know
727.04s: because I have that bullshit going on,
729.12s: I am spending even more time just hanging out at home
733.08s: looking at stuff.
734.20s: It's like, what else am I going to do?
736.20s: Go into the gym and then doing that, which is nuts.
743.48s: 113, 145, 741, 350.
748.40s: Okay.
749.36s: So based on prices right rules,
752.52s: Ben price, you win plus one fake internet point.
756.28s: Euphoria web tried to game the system.
758.16s: When you're playing prices right,
759.48s: you don't get to give a range.
760.80s: It's utter bullshit.
762.00s: It's not how that works.
763.48s: So euphoria web, unfortunately,
765.32s: your submission is immediately discounted
767.92s: because you try to give a range.
768.92s: You can't give a range.
769.72s: It's got to be single number.
771.60s: And Ben price is the winner of plus one fake internet point.
776.20s: That's what you get.
777.48s: So we'll let it all be known for everybody
781.96s: plus one fake internet point.
785.40s: There you go.
787.08s: Right there.
788.48s: Tree Fitty.
790.44s: So the actual number is 392,
794.76s: closest without going over, prices right rules.
797.32s: So the actual number is 392 times
801.20s: from 2000 to 2024 today.
807.92s: And the first time it happened was actually in 2002
811.48s: on the 5th of March.
812.76s: Hey, day after my birthday, what a great celebration.
816.72s: That's fascinating.
820.76s: Okay, now this number makes way more sense to me.
824.12s: So the next question I'm solving for,
827.44s: because what I'm going to do is I want to go look at the chart
829.84s: on these days and see what we can see.
831.84s: Because the other thing I asked it to do for me is find me
835.84s: the periods where the intraday movement,
838.64s: so high to low within a single day exceeded 50%
842.64s: from the same time frame.
845.20s: And it did that 21 times, which obviously compared
850.28s: to the volume question that might seem like really insignificant,
853.04s: but price moving by 50% intraday is much harder
857.36s: than volume simply expanding, like significantly so.
861.12s: A lot of other things have to happen
862.84s: in order for that kind of price pattern.
864.96s: So that's a really, really impressive movement.
867.88s: It looks like the highest I see is 330% price increase,
873.40s: which was on 28 Jan 21.
876.44s: That's the largest number I see here.
879.28s: And then there's a couple hundred, it's not many,
881.36s: like maybe three total.
883.64s: So we'll take a look at those individual days
886.52s: because I want to go on demand
888.24s: and I literally want to go back in time
890.20s: and see if we can take a look at the options markets
892.56s: before those again, this is the way that I start gaining
896.80s: more context on what I'm looking at
898.80s: and the way it behaves.
899.68s: Because again, I continue to read this point
902.40s: because I think it's important.
903.92s: There's two parts of my brain that are working right now.
907.44s: There's the part of my brain that is interested
910.60s: in the story market impact broader things.
913.80s: There's another part of my brain that is interested
916.64s: in what I can trade and how can I identify a usable signal
921.88s: that I can rely on.
923.28s: Again, right now it's volume.
924.48s: That's the best predictor I've found so far.
927.00s: And the reason why I bring it up is because
928.96s: when I'm going through all these different theories,
931.04s: I was messaging Newton not too long ago
934.20s: asking just some of the latest research and stuff.
937.16s: And it's like there are tons of really interesting ideas.
942.72s: The problem is I haven't found a good configuration of ideas
948.56s: that is led to an efficacious objectively
952.92s: efficacious signal that I can trade.
955.32s: FTDs have not done that.
957.08s: Volume changes seem to be the closest so far.
960.40s: Swap data has not done it.
962.76s: So it tells me like as per usual,
966.44s: we're dealing with such a busy multivariate system.
970.68s: Like that's really what I see when I look at this.
973.36s: And in the meantime, you have to give me a break.
975.24s: I have to get a couple of these ad-vill twos down
979.24s: so that I can keep my composure.
984.28s: There they go.
990.40s: I don't know how long you can take ad-vill and ib profile
993.44s: and I normally don't take it,
994.52s: but right now your boy needs it.
998.12s: All right, so let's take a look really quick,
999.36s: though, at the short interest.
1000.72s: So short interest in GME.
1005.96s: And let's see what this says.
1007.32s: So this is going to Fintel.
1013.20s: Rebel Darkside says also I'm not in AMC,
1018.20s: but how they run together.
1019.72s: The AMC is bullish on 200 day average all the cross
1022.52s: and nothing.
1023.36s: I like this stuff.
1024.48s: It's cool.
1025.32s: Yeah.
1025.84s: Well, the interesting part is I know that people
1027.84s: have different feelings about meme stocks
1030.56s: and what that means and then the insinuations.
1032.76s: We actually had a little bit of a conversation
1035.28s: about that in the discord, which again is free
1038.12s: for anybody to join that's interested.
1039.92s: But the pure definition that I've always associated
1044.80s: and I looked it up at a curiosity is just like,
1046.68s: what is a meme stock?
1048.64s: And a lot of people, I think it has
1051.12s: like this really terrible connotation,
1054.08s: but realistically from what I've always
1056.96s: understand is that it's essentially like this right here.
1062.44s: It's a stock that gains popularity through social media.
1065.84s: Like that's the way I look at it.
1067.72s: And I think that there's a reality behind what we see
1073.56s: meme stocks do.
1075.36s: Whether you want to classify a game stock as a meme stock
1077.64s: or not, that's okay.
1078.56s: Again, I don't want to bother anybody with the terminology
1082.12s: or whatever.
1083.12s: It's like there's words to me.
1084.32s: But the main thing is there's a correlation between them
1088.12s: because as there's fervor in one thing,
1091.80s: typically people expect sympathy movement in other things.
1095.56s: And this is not unique to meme stocks.
1098.00s: This is common for any sort of correlated products.
1102.52s: Now the correlation between something like game stop
1105.36s: and AMC we can look at, but it's all over the map.
1107.96s: I've looked it up before.
1108.80s: It's not that crazy.
1111.00s: So anyways, back to game stop, this is really low.
1115.12s: Like really, really low.
1117.24s: So it shows short interest flow is 9.7%
1120.72s: and then off exchange short volume is 27%,
1123.96s: which is just really, it's just really low.
1127.40s: Now one of the things that's really funny about this
1131.48s: is that's actually a really long time to cover still.
1136.36s: 11 days to cover a short is a long ass time.
1141.08s: So this and this don't seem to align in my opinion.
1148.40s: That seems quirky.
1152.56s: Cause that's an eternity to cover.
1156.20s: That yeah, that just, I'm gonna try to check
1158.24s: another source really quick.
1159.80s: GME short interest.
1165.84s: Let's see what market beat says.
1170.96s: Alfonso says nobody really mentioned meme stocks
1173.48s: until the stimulus check started flood
1175.12s: in the bank account of youngsters in 2020.
1177.20s: I think it's a big part of it.
1178.20s: Yeah, when there was like a giant, giant explosion
1181.68s: in retail traders, like I totally agree.
1187.92s: I completely agree with you.
1189.92s: And that's kind of the ideas that meme stocks
1192.60s: are kind of part and parcel to retail and social media.
1196.64s: It's not something that's just like institutionally
1200.00s: well known or whatever.
1202.60s: Let's take a look at this.
1203.68s: I haven't looked yet.
1205.56s: Yeah, that looks way more logical.
1210.44s: So 0.8 days to cover and this is showing 10.8%.
1214.76s: This is showing 9.77 so it's pretty close.
1218.76s: Yeah, this makes way more sense to me.
1222.36s: This to me looks like an error.
1226.60s: Because 11 days to cover like that is,
1230.40s: that is like just an unbelievable eternity
1235.24s: if that were the case.
1238.48s: And then let's take a look at this, the chart exchange
1242.88s: and it shows short interest contracted very meaningfully.
1246.04s: Which again, we would expect to see.
1248.28s: So as the, as that at the money came through,
1254.36s: it looks like there is a pretty meaningful bleed through
1257.80s: on this because short interest just absolutely cratered.
1263.40s: Now, the other part that I can't help but find interesting
1266.04s: is how low this says short interest wasn't here.
1270.72s: Because I'm not so sure,
1272.36s: but this might be at a period of time
1274.80s: where short interest might have been kind of wound
1280.16s: into other products already.
1282.36s: So it might be that's why, that might be why
1285.84s: that's a little bit skewed in my opinion.
1287.60s: Because I don't know that short interest was actually
1291.56s: at like 0% that this would suggest.
1297.08s: That seems, it seems weird.
1300.40s: Before you says how does short interest go down
1303.16s: and the price also goes down a bunch of different ways,
1306.32s: but in this case, I'm assuming I don't remember the exact date
1309.32s: when the at the money started.
1310.56s: When did it start?
1312.48s: GMATM offering start date.
1321.12s: Begin May 17th.
1324.68s: So it's literally right in here.
1326.08s: Yeah, so that's, that would be my guess.
1329.12s: It is that it came from the share offering.
1332.56s: Because it started May 17th and I think it only went
1336.04s: for a few days.
1336.88s: It didn't take that, or no, it went longer than that.
1338.80s: Sorry, this says it concluded on the 11th.
1345.92s: That was a little longer than I thought, but okay.
1348.24s: I obviously, I'm sure that's right.
1349.84s: I don't think I remember fully well.
1353.24s: Before you says, was that enough for them
1354.80s: to bring it down that much?
1355.72s: I think so.
1356.80s: I mean, they offered a ton of shares, man.
1358.92s: They offered up to 45 million shares.
1362.44s: So yeah, I mean, it's definitely,
1367.44s: that's a massive offering at that point.
1371.40s: Nick says, do you think GME's dilution was bad
1373.44s: without giving any forward guidance?
1374.88s: I don't think so.
1376.20s: I don't think so at all.
1377.72s: I think the problem is that it seems like GME shareholders
1383.60s: have like a certain expectation of what kind of guidance they'll get.
1387.12s: And what time frame and what information will be included.
1391.28s: But I don't actually believe that the share offering
1395.92s: was bad for the company.
1397.08s: I mean, they raised what?
1398.28s: Like over $2 billion, something like that, right?
1401.56s: Again, you guys probably know those metrics
1403.00s: a little bit better than me off the top of your head.
1405.52s: But yeah, I literally think they raised like over $2 billion.
1408.80s: I'm sorry, $2 billion in gross proceeds from it.
1412.48s: So I think like there are two different things in your question,
1417.84s: their Nick kind of two different components, right?
1420.28s: There's the was it bad and then was it bad in the context of guidance?
1426.52s: Because there are two different things.
1428.88s: I think the way that GME is offering guidance has been weird.
1435.08s: But I also think that it's not surprising the way that it's offering guidance.
1440.08s: Now, I think that at the money net net put the company in a much better position
1446.20s: to operate as a company.
1447.76s: Like, and that's just objectively the case.
1449.56s: Because my other assumption is one of the primary reasons
1454.00s: I think that offering went through the time it did is not just because the stock
1460.00s: was super high.
1460.92s: That is part of it.
1462.56s: But I think the other reason why the offering went through at that point is
1465.56s: because my guess is they knew interest rates weren't,
1470.84s: so there weren't going to stay at astronomical levels into perpetuity.
1476.04s: So if you complete that at the money offering, you raise a fat stack of cash
1481.40s: before interest rates start to crater, which they're going to look,
1485.60s: we have until September, right?
1486.84s: They're going to start coming down, whether it's 25 basis points or 50,
1489.72s: we don't know.
1490.24s: But that's what it's looking like starting in September.
1493.20s: So this at least gave them a few months to be able to take advantage of really short-term
1497.44s: high interest rates and even lock in longer-term interest rates that still remain at least partially
1503.36s: elevated.
1504.68s: So I think there's a bit of a strategic choice there in two fashions.
1510.68s: The first one, doing it when it's high makes sense.
1514.04s: Make a lot of money.
1515.60s: The other thing is with that money, you're capturing it at a time frame that you can do something
1520.84s: pretty meaningful with it.
1522.76s: So yeah, I think the offering itself, I can see from a business perspective why they made
1528.88s: the choice.
1530.12s: Now in terms of the guidance component, that's a little bit different.
1535.16s: And the reason being is because I don't really know what kind of guidance people are wanting
1542.92s: to hear.
1543.92s: I didn't listen all the way through the previous call, but in the previous call, I was capturing
1551.96s: a lot of, I don't want to call it under or overtones, but broad themes is what I would
1558.80s: qualify it as.
1559.80s: I felt like during the last shareholders meeting, like GME leadership offered broad themes.
1567.12s: So let me see.
1568.12s: GME, Shareholder meeting, 2024.
1582.52s: This was just the voting stuff.
1590.28s: No, no, no.
1597.84s: No, that's not what I want.
1599.88s: Four razor says he was the CEO of Chui with the fuck.
1609.04s: Oh, sorry, I'm getting caught up on the tax, my bad guys are on the chat.
1618.92s: Let me see where you guys are.
1620.60s: Okay, so Nick says, I thought it was good to raise cash on hand to your four billion,
1626.72s: but I'd really like to see some sort of guidance through what the plan is moving forward.
1630.68s: Four billion is great, but what is next?
1631.96s: Yeah, I think that that's a completely, I think that's a completely, completely fair.
1638.04s: Yeah, I think it's a fair ask.
1641.60s: And the other thing is I also don't see them just raising money for the sake of raising
1647.64s: money.
1648.96s: So I would also imagine that there's some sort of game plan baked into the decision cycle.
1655.24s: And I don't, and I don't think anybody else really knows what it is right now.
1659.60s: But I do think that there's, to me, probably something going on now as obscure as that is,
1669.40s: I know it's quite obscure, but you don't raise billions in cash with just the aspiration
1678.44s: of having billions in cash.
1680.96s: It doesn't necessarily do the company a ton of favors.
1684.20s: It doesn't hurt them having the money, but you want the money working for the business
1688.04s: and driving revenue.
1690.48s: So I agree with you from that perspective.
1696.12s: But yeah, here we go, this one I was looking for.
1701.72s: Chris says, see rates go down, markets go down.
1705.28s: It's not, I don't think it's as simple as that.
1707.36s: If you're talking about when the Fed cuts rates that the market's going to trail down,
1710.92s: I've been seeing that getting thrown around a lot.
1712.88s: I actually don't know why.
1719.96s: Market goes down, they start to get out.
1724.80s: Yeah, I still, I don't, I don't know where we're drawing that conclusion from that rates
1730.80s: go down, market goes down.
1732.92s: To your point, Rapture says Fed cuts rates during a recession, but cutting rates doesn't
1738.72s: mean we're in a recession.
1740.60s: Potentially, you're not yet to your point.
1742.60s: We're not always in a recession when the Fed cuts rates.
1749.92s: But yeah, I think going back to the idea of rates go down, market goes down.
1755.32s: It's a mixed bag.
1756.32s: It's not actually as linear as that.
1758.48s: I've done a study on it.
1759.64s: I actually wrote all about it in the newsletter that's coming out tomorrow.
1763.20s: And I analyzed all of the rate cuts from 2000 to present.
1768.12s: And the number of rate cuts, the severity of the rate cuts.
1772.24s: And I think there's like multiple instances where rates were cut and the market ran up in
1782.12s: three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months following time frames from the period
1788.44s: of the cut.
1789.52s: So I don't actually fully think that that's a fleshed out thought.
1794.00s: And then one second, I just got to open the door for the pup real fast.
1824.64s: Mashin said, how do you hurt your back?
1826.20s: Well, fortunately enough, my back actually doesn't hurt literally at all.
1830.20s: But my sciatica is fucked right now from a herniated desk.
1833.40s: And I just got it when I was training.
1836.28s: And my guess is it's something that has been building over the years.
1842.64s: Like I've been super physically active my whole life.
1845.68s: So and I've been really fortunate in terms of injuries so far.
1849.76s: So I think I just got blessed with this one at this point in time.
1855.72s: But my guess is it's something that's been coming up for a while.
1859.92s: Nate says hope you didn't get put in a twister.
1861.60s: There's a zero percent chance you would catch me in a twister.
1865.08s: Same thing with like a buggy choke.
1867.64s: There's a zero percent chance.
1869.36s: There's like a couple sort of submissions that there's just no world that I would tap
1874.52s: to.
1875.52s: Like a buggy choke, you would have to put me to sleep.
1877.64s: And then when I wake up, you would have to prevent me from unaliving myself potentially.
1883.48s: Because just a buggy choke is like the ultimate disrespect.
1886.80s: And it's actually becoming kind of a dangerous submission.
1890.08s: So yeah, that makes rolling is a bigger dude a little bit tricky, especially I like side
1895.84s: control.
1896.84s: Nate says gear, no, I do not wear the kimono.
1899.32s: I've worn a key.
1900.32s: I think three times of my entire life.
1902.72s: I've been playing like jujitsu since college and I've been a mixed martial artist hobby.
1908.72s: I say that in like very, very light terms.
1911.48s: It's I'm a hobbyist.
1912.48s: I'm not even any sort of, yeah, like pure dedicated dude.
1917.84s: I just like training.
1919.92s: So anything I've done in jujitsu is always in the context of like actual martial arts,
1925.64s: not just jujitsu.
1927.48s: So I think jujitsu can build a ton of bad habits, bro.
1931.84s: Like pulling guard in jujitsu can be a dangerous weapon.
1937.80s: Anywhere else is going to get you soccer kicked in the freaking head.
1943.16s: Like it's a terrible move everywhere else.
1946.32s: Have literally everywhere else.
1948.80s: It's a terrible choice.
1950.96s: Only in jujitsu and I don't like that about stuff like that in like pure jujitsu practitioners.
1957.80s: I always have respect for it.
1960.52s: Yeah, I think that that's stuff silly.
1962.04s: I also think bottom position being too well respected.
1966.24s: Again, there's some really deadly dudes from bottom.
1969.44s: They'd rather play bottom and that's okay.
1971.12s: I get it.
1972.12s: But in any sort of combative scenario, that is how you get smashed.
1977.56s: So bottom is terrible and not being willing to wrestle up and move around as terrible.
1982.80s: So yeah, bit of a rant and rave about jujitsu because I guess it's because I like to sport
1987.28s: so much and I want to see it grow.
1990.52s: And I think that's one of the difficulties it's going to face.
1996.28s: Let's see.
2002.12s: Muner says historically every time the Fed cuts, the market enters a bearish state.
2006.44s: It's not rocket science.
2007.44s: Look at a chart and compare it.
2009.60s: It's just not true though.
2011.44s: And again, like in the newsletter that that's coming out tomorrow talks about it, but it
2017.76s: objectively is not true.
2019.48s: So in 2019, the Fed cut three times, it took rates from two and a half to 1.76.
2026.12s: The duration of the cuts was over six months after the initial cut.
2031.88s: Markets for the three months following that cut were up 7.6% then up 12% in the next six
2038.36s: then up 15.8% over the nine and then up 21% over the 12.
2044.04s: So again, I understand the sentiment because if we look at 2001, if we look at 2007, 2008,
2054.18s: there are absolutely instances where cuts led to downside market performance in conjunction
2060.28s: with other things.
2061.92s: I just think it's so important again to do our best and remain objective.
2067.72s: And like that's one objective scenario.
2070.56s: There's another one in essentially right around the COVID market in 2020.
2078.12s: Market collapses due to COVID.
2080.44s: The market then the Fed starts cutting rates.
2083.44s: There is two cuts over a month taking us from 1.75 down to 0.25, essentially zero.
2091.16s: And that led to a massive rally in the market despite a pandemic.
2097.68s: The unit says and when it went to zero, no, that's not, that's just not right, man.
2103.40s: The time that cuts started during 2020 is after COVID started plummeting the market.
2110.32s: It was in response to COVID.
2113.72s: So it was not cut rates market crashed and then market went up, right?
2120.56s: That's not, that's not what happened in 2020.
2123.80s: So yeah, that the whole point of the rate cuts in 2020 were in response to COVID, which
2132.76s: pushed the market down as it should have because everybody was ready for it to be absolutely
2137.32s: terrible.
2139.04s: And if it didn't go through, right?
2143.12s: Like if the Fed didn't intervene and what the Fed policy didn't go through, that could
2147.04s: have been catastrophic to the market.
2150.00s: So yeah.
2155.00s: Chris says you think the market where it's at, the market will go up.
2159.28s: It's a great question.
2161.04s: And the punchline to it is, I have no idea.
2166.52s: I really don't know.
2168.32s: And my job as a trader is not necessarily to know.
2172.20s: My job as a trader is to follow the market with what it's doing.
2176.76s: And that's generally how I view it.
2178.16s: Like I don't even care to know because whatever the market is going to do is what I care
2184.60s: about.
2185.60s: So if I look at the one, you know, September, when we start this rate cutting campaign,
2192.72s: I don't think that's going to crash the market, especially September.
2195.68s: Like there would, I would believe that we would need to see some sort of change in other
2204.20s: contacts about the market, whether we get more economic data that shows that things
2208.04s: are super weak, kind of like the unemployment revision.
2211.36s: And we see like a stream of that stuff start coming in.
2214.12s: Then I do think that that can absolutely have an impact.
2217.16s: But Muner says I'm willing to make a bet when they start to cut the market will crash.
2221.24s: Sure.
2222.24s: Well, what are you thinking?
2225.20s: Muner, what time frame?
2226.84s: So they're going to start cutting in September.
2229.04s: So when's the, when's the crash after September in your opinion?
2237.68s: Because depending on your answer to that, it'll give me some idea in terms of what you
2242.12s: think about the immediacy of it.
2244.52s: Because the other component that again, we have to remember is that if for example,
2256.64s: Mashin says crash happening, I was so funny.
2260.00s: Mashin, you read my mind.
2263.12s: Muner says 2025 will be a bear market as a whole.
2268.68s: I mean, whatever you say, dog, it's those kinds of statements I find so silly because like
2274.64s: you don't know literally nobody can know, but we really, really want to predict because
2281.32s: then we sound cool if it happens.
2283.48s: And it's just so silly, right?
2285.28s: Like to me, why would I try to predict what's going to happen through all of 2025?
2291.80s: Why would I try to predict that?
2293.16s: Like, is a traitor?
2295.00s: It does nothing for me because if I position wrong and the market does something else, I
2299.48s: don't make money.
2300.48s: So like, I'm not even interested in attempting to predict, but I mean, we'll definitely snapshot
2306.52s: that.
2307.52s: Actually, let me grab it really quick so that we have it.
2311.56s: And then we'll see.
2312.56s: We'll have to, we'll have to set an alert to check out the end of 2025 and see if it's
2317.56s: a bear market and at which point we will find out if you're a correct or not.
2322.28s: So yeah, DVD, I suppose.
2329.20s: Chris says market is great stock market will suck.
2332.28s: Why do so many people have cash?
2337.20s: Unfamiliar with what you're referring to.
2341.12s: Yeah, unfamiliar.
2342.92s: So anyways, back to Q1 2024.
2349.68s: So we can see sales contracted, which we don't love.
2356.00s: We can see, I mean, this typically is not a super favorable reporting period.
2364.84s: I don't think for them, but I mean, they're moving in the right direction, right?
2371.12s: So net loss went from 50, 32, a little bit better.
2378.64s: So loss per share came down, which is good.
2383.20s: Net loss contracted.
2385.36s: So like these, these components are good to see.
2389.12s: And then my guess is that if the company can continue like this broader pivot, and that's
2396.80s: the part I haven't quite put my finger on yet, to try to identify like, where's the
2401.56s: money going to go?
2403.16s: Where do we put the billions of dollars in cash that we have at this time?
2410.40s: So I don't know.
2414.52s: And to your to the chat's broader point about some sort of hypothesis around.
2427.20s: You know, what we think they could spend the money on, we don't know.
2431.12s: And again, like the chat kind of pointed that out that you guys as a community, haven't
2437.40s: seen guidance from them, which I don't blame you for not being frustrated about that,
2444.80s: especially because we don't necessarily like dilution, but there was dilution to a degree.
2451.88s: So then we want to at least know that the dilution was done for a good reason and that it will
2458.20s: lead to profitability.
2460.20s: And right now that's kind of predicated on a trust fall.
2464.64s: How much do we trust RC and what he's likely to do with the money?
2470.52s: So Steve says, having that much money in hand is insane.
2474.96s: I think they are just waiting for an opportunity.
2480.00s: I can see your point, but I don't think that's accurate in my opinion.
2484.44s: The only reason why I don't think that's accurate is because like I don't think the leadership
2489.40s: would essentially say, hey, share price is really high right now.
2494.00s: Let's do an at the money and then let's just build up a pile of cash and then see what
2499.64s: happens.
2500.64s: Right?
2501.64s: Like that's actually pretty irresponsible if that's the decision process that they made.
2507.36s: My guess is that they might have said, hey, stock price is high.
2510.92s: Let's do an at the money.
2512.40s: We have a couple ideas that are on the table.
2515.08s: Let's see if we can push these through.
2517.92s: That would be the higher probability scenario.
2520.32s: I would guess and hope.
2522.08s: I guess I should say it's pure speculation.
2524.20s: I don't know, but that's what I would hope because that at least means that they're not
2530.40s: diluting and then essentially diluting and then seeing what happens.
2535.56s: That's just that's not good leadership.
2537.68s: That's not good planning.
2539.64s: So my guess is they have some ideas on what they would want to do with the money.
2547.40s: I just haven't seen them really indicate to what.
2551.16s: And I actually think that's very likely to be a significant part of the earnings we
2556.96s: have coming up on force set.
2560.24s: And I think that it'll be unfortunate because if I'm not mistaken, I don't think
2565.00s: the GME typically does like an earnings call, right?
2568.20s: I think they typically do just like a release.
2571.96s: If I don't know if that's that's what I think.
2574.12s: I'm not sure you guys will have to correct me.
2577.44s: But my guess is like they're going to have to come up with something here.
2584.60s: Like they're going to during I do think during the force set meeting after running.
2592.40s: They have the money like they have a couple questions that they're going to have to talk
2595.96s: about.
2598.80s: So I'm hopeful that they'll address a little bit more.
2605.92s: Robo says Larry Chang has posted a lot on next about Berkshire halfway model specifically
2610.64s: around having patients and being ready for the best opportunity possible.
2614.24s: Yeah, I agree with that.
2616.88s: And again, the only the only comment I was making before about the at the money and raising
2621.64s: cash is my guess is they have ideas about what they want to do.
2625.96s: I don't think it they made a decision to raise a bunch of cash and then just kind of like
2630.60s: sit there and hope an idea hits them in the face.
2634.20s: My guess is they have ideas on where they want to pivot and take the company to.
2639.36s: And they know that they're going to need cash to do it.
2641.68s: And then I fully agree with who was a Robo.
2647.28s: I fully agree with Robo that it's super likely at this point that they're just waiting until
2657.44s: the correct thing shows up.
2659.52s: The only thing I'm trying to differentiate with that statement is I would guess that they
2664.60s: have an idea of what they want to do.
2667.48s: Now why they haven't communicated much of it that part I genuinely don't know.
2671.84s: I really don't.
2673.72s: And it doesn't fully make sense to me unless that they're trying to maintain a certain level
2679.00s: of anonymity with their movements.
2682.28s: And I don't know who their primary competitors are that they might be trying to hide and
2688.12s: obscure some of their decisions.
2691.08s: But my guess is again, I think during this force set meeting that there's probably a really,
2696.16s: really good chance that will at least get something because that's going to be a massive
2700.44s: question for shareholders, right?
2702.48s: Many people that have been holding this thing for years, sooner or later you have to ask
2706.88s: the question, what's the fucking plan?
2710.28s: And he's made some of the plan very clear, right?
2713.52s: So one of the things he made very clear in his last conversation was the idea of getting
2718.96s: rid of not profitable stores, leaning into profitable stores, stuff like that, right?
2724.04s: Like basic stuff.
2725.72s: But that's part of the plan.
2727.80s: And I think a lot of people say like, okay, yeah, that part of the, that makes sense.
2731.32s: I think that's a decent plan.
2733.72s: But now the bigger question that they're going to have to discuss, I think is, hey, we
2737.64s: didn't add the money.
2739.48s: And there's a ton of cash that we're sitting on right now.
2743.44s: What are we doing with this cash?
2747.32s: Everybody has that question.
2748.64s: So it would be utterly surprising to me if they choose not to answer that question to
2755.20s: some degree.
2756.88s: If they choose not to answer the question, my follow on assumption would be that they
2761.36s: have something they're working on that they don't want to disrupt.
2766.48s: That's the only reason I could see why they would do that.
2769.88s: Because they do run the risk of starting to lose investor confidence.
2774.36s: And as feverish and supportive as the apes are of the stock, sooner or later people have
2780.08s: to pay their bills.
2781.32s: And they need to know that the money's going into something again that's going to drive
2785.00s: revenue.
2786.00s: Raptor says, what do you think of GME buying out pen?
2795.36s: Who knows?
2796.36s: Yeah, who knows?
2797.52s: I don't know how well pen's been doing though.
2800.32s: Oh, they're doing okay.
2804.36s: Okay, never mind.
2806.84s: They're not doing okay.
2810.20s: So fun fact, pen is indeed not doing okay.
2813.96s: Contrary to what I previously thought.
2819.04s: Wow, interesting.
2825.32s: So pens gone 72 cents, EPS 13 305 45 negative 4 8 negative 2 3 7 negative 7 6 negative 18.
2834.92s: So that's not necessarily the ideal trajectory you would want to see.
2839.68s: But yeah, who knows?
2840.68s: Dude, like, if I think that this is the path that they might, I really don't know.
2849.08s: I think that's one of the, what's one of the tricky parts here is like literally nobody
2852.60s: knows.
2853.60s: Now what I do know is that when you're sitting on a few billion in cash, you do have some
2862.20s: choices in front of you.
2864.88s: So that is one benefit is that they're not, they're not backed into a corner right now.
2871.72s: So that part I, I suppose at least is good.
2876.84s: But beyond that part, it's so obscure right now.
2881.48s: All right, let's hop into on demand really fast.
2884.60s: I want to see if I can go back to some of these like really early days.
2890.08s: And then I want to go like how far can I go back here?
2894.40s: Okay, so I can't get back to the earliest stuff that I can get into the 2010.
2901.64s: All right, here we go.
2905.80s: So 2010.
2909.80s: So this was one of my fears.
2930.76s: We might have to go one day past.
2935.04s: So one of the issues with on demand is that it'll do this kind of really quirky little
2941.60s: stuff.
2942.60s: And also this is the wrong stock.
2943.60s: We're going to look at GME.
2946.24s: Okay.
2950.00s: So all I'm trying to see here is what is the expansion of volume look like leading into
2961.04s: the total expansion and volume that we see.
2964.76s: So in this case on the seventh, there was obviously a huge blow up in volume.
2973.60s: Generation capital says three months of interest on four bill great earnings.
2977.72s: It's for it's not bad, but it's that's still too short term in my opinion.
2985.32s: Again, the company can't get by with like trying to scrape what interests they can earn
2991.20s: off of their money.
2993.16s: But it's probably like the investor slash trader part of your brain trying to make sense
2999.36s: of it, which is a fair connection.
3001.68s: But for a business when they raise cash, typically the idea is to grow the business.
3008.28s: It's not necessarily to invest the money into bonds, whatever other yielding products
3014.96s: that they have up front.
3017.68s: Because that still won't make them as much as a good business decision.
3022.24s: Like if they can get the capital into something that works really well, they'll make way more
3027.04s: money with it.
3028.04s: I got to take this look.
3032.24s: I shouldn't think.
3037.48s: So yeah, let me go one day past this.
3042.20s: I just want to see if it normalizes a little bit.
3053.24s: So what was this the seventh?
3056.88s: Okay, so this data is not going to be great.
3061.60s: That's a little unfortunate.
3062.96s: We can go a little earlier.
3064.16s: So let's go to 2021.
3071.04s: And then we want January 13th.
3074.96s: So this is where GME had a 92% move.
3085.44s: So one of the things I notice.
3088.68s: I'll zoom this in a little bit more.
3091.52s: One of the things I notice about this move is again, look at the volume before the move.
3099.40s: The volume exceeds both 20 day average, 5 day average, and then the 5 day average starts
3106.48s: taking an aggressive slope up.
3110.48s: Even the day directly before, it still has a disproportionate by volume.
3118.88s: Nick says, what could make GME $100 billion company?
3125.12s: That's what I want to see happening.
3128.56s: I mean, really if they just develop a really solid business model, man, because the community
3135.16s: supports them extremely well, but as much as the community supports them, they still need
3141.88s: to drive value and they need to grow their community.
3147.24s: They need to grow their audience.
3149.48s: So I think a big part of their ability to scale the company meaningfully is going to come
3155.00s: down to their ability to execute against that.
3158.56s: That's at least what I think in the general near term in terms of their positioning.
3163.88s: It would not surprise me at all to see them acquire a company.
3168.80s: Like that would not surprise me at all.
3171.20s: And the reason why it would not surprise me is because it's a way to drastically accelerate
3175.32s: what they're doing and to start expanding their business lines.
3180.48s: The brick and mortar stores, they're good, right?
3183.36s: Like some of them do well, but I don't think that's going to be a reliable way to like
3189.32s: really grow the company.
3190.96s: I think the company is going to need more than just the brick and mortar stores.
3195.84s: And a lot of that in my opinion comes down.
3198.04s: There's just a limited reach, especially when we've become such an online based economy.
3203.96s: I have an inversion table to help with the bullshit on my back.
3208.40s: I literally bought it yesterday and overnighted it via Amazon to my house today.
3217.88s: And then I built it.
3219.68s: I had it in less than 24 hours from when I bought it.
3223.12s: So what I'm highlighting by that is Amazon is a great example of the power of expanding
3230.32s: your scope because Amazon can sell to anybody anywhere and get them their shit pretty damn
3236.24s: fast.
3237.60s: So I think a big part of GameStop is going to be diversifying its business line because
3242.96s: it still has its online business presence as well.
3245.88s: And that's good.
3247.32s: But I think that they have such a potential audience through the gaming community.
3253.48s: I mean, let's take a look.
3254.64s: I don't know the numbers, but let's do a quick look.
3257.44s: How many gamers are there in the US?
3266.52s: Because of June 2024, there are around 212 million gamers, which is about 61% of the
3272.04s: population.
3274.04s: Like you want to talk about density?
3277.76s: That's insane.
3279.92s: So they have a massive, massive audience potential there.
3285.12s: They have a massive audience potential there.
3287.72s: And I think it would make a ton of sense for them to tap into them.
3292.08s: Like without a doubt, I think it would make so much sense.
3297.04s: Now, I don't fully understand the way that they're thinking about the future and the
3304.16s: vision of the company because that part is still generally obscure to me.
3309.96s: And that's really just what's going to boil down to what they're going to choose to buy
3314.16s: into.
3316.16s: Because they have the opportunity now with the amount of cash that they have to really
3319.92s: spread into a lot of different things if they choose, which is really cool.
3326.28s: Well, I just don't know what direction they want to take things.
3329.28s: Again, the cool part there is they have the choice.
3332.52s: They have the choice to take the company in a bunch of different directions if they choose.
3340.36s: Alfonso says Cohen modeled Chouy on Amazon.
3343.12s: Gaming doesn't need to be central, just like Amazon's starting with books.
3346.20s: Yeah.
3347.20s: I think the point I think with gaming, though, is that it already offers such a smooth
3354.12s: on ramp because if there's such a critical population density that likes gaming and a
3361.56s: lot of the company is already supported by gamers.
3366.76s: If you give that audience a larger grouping of things that they might like, it really
3373.44s: makes everything from marketing cheaper, from developing products or whatever services
3379.44s: you want to offer more efficient.
3381.60s: You gain so many efficiencies by doing that because the Berkshire model is very different.
3388.44s: Berkshire is just a holding company and then it buys businesses that continue to operate
3395.68s: as that business, whatever that business is.
3398.44s: Now, if that's the direction that, you know, if that's the direction that GameStop wants
3405.12s: to go, I don't see why they couldn't do it, but that would be kind of a little bit
3409.88s: of a vice versa approach to that where they're starting as a very specific niche business
3417.20s: and then turning into some sort of holding company and then acquiring other businesses.
3421.52s: Because the other reality is four billion in cash ish is a lot, but that's not like there's
3428.68s: literally individual people, it's crazy as that sounds with more money than that, right?
3433.52s: That's not like Berkshire cash.
3436.20s: It's not like Apple Cash.
3437.72s: So all I'm highlighting is that they have a really good runway, but they also do not
3444.04s: have this unlimited pile of money to go into and start throwing it wherever they want.
3450.64s: Like, I think they still are going to have to be pretty thoughtful about the movements
3454.84s: and the pivots that they choose to make.
3457.68s: So and I think it'll be again, my guess it'll be generally discussed at least I hope.
3466.16s: It will be generally discussed in the force set because I still think that they need to
3472.24s: address what they've done with the at the money.
3476.56s: Again, not that it's bad.
3477.72s: I think it's okay.
3478.72s: Provided that there's a game plan for the money.
3482.00s: So and I just don't think any of us have really heard much of that game plan yet, unfortunately.
3488.64s: Alfonso says I'm not a gamer, but aren't in game purchases a big part of the profit
3498.12s: pie.
3499.64s: Game stop won't capture any of that selling games and hardware.
3501.72s: Yeah, I think that's one of the potential downsides to the way that the gaming industry
3507.56s: is moving because I mean, like I like to play video games periodically.
3512.52s: And I can't tell you the last time that I bought a physical disc to put in the console.
3519.20s: And it also is not going to surprise me at all when we eventually see the entire console
3529.88s: not have an input for a disc.
3532.24s: Like I actually don't even see why it will longer term.
3536.32s: So yeah, I think there's probably a lot of changes coming down the pike for the way
3544.56s: that they do business.
3545.56s: And I think that's exactly why everybody's so interested in how they're going to do
3550.16s: business.
3551.64s: Because I think that there's a lot of different ways that they can pivot still, but they
3556.92s: have to make some decisions in terms of the way that they want to run it.
3562.04s: Which again, I don't have a great feel for.
3565.20s: I want to input my credit card number so that I can order barbecue tonight.
3571.72s: That's the move.
3574.32s: Nope wrong zip code.
3576.32s: Damn it.
3579.32s: There we go.
3583.04s: That should be good.
3585.00s: Willie says no doubt there's reasons code act went out of business tech evolves and they
3588.40s: didn't pivot in time.
3589.40s: Yeah.
3590.40s: The funny thing to that actually is I went to school in Rochester, New York where code
3599.12s: act is essentially based out of and I didn't know this, but a fun fact is they have a nuclear
3605.32s: reactor.
3606.32s: They had a nuclear reactor in the base of the building, which is super cool.
3609.40s: But yeah, you're right.
3610.64s: They just didn't pivot when they should have.
3613.32s: Willie says Mexican food part two.
3615.88s: I think we're doing barbecue.
3617.16s: So tonight will be a tritep and pulled pork for me.
3623.92s: And then I think Mel will probably get some sort of chicken like a chicken something or
3629.28s: other.
3632.88s: Chris says I'm buying puts for earnings.
3637.92s: They won't have a call so we won't have info on what their plans are with the cash.
3641.92s: They can still issue a statement.
3644.68s: A lot of times again, in place of an earnings call, you can release a statement or they
3650.12s: can tell you that they're going to do a shareholders meeting that's going to talk a little bit
3654.40s: more about whatever, you know, their broader plan is.
3658.16s: So I wouldn't get too disenfranchised if it's not a call.
3662.64s: The part I wouldn't like just is if there's no information that part would be.
3668.76s: I wouldn't like that one.
3670.40s: Okay, so this is the first time for the first move that I see that expanded by at least
3675.04s: 50%.
3676.04s: Now I'm going to go to the 22nd.
3678.76s: And I want to see how volume moved ahead of this one.
3681.96s: I'd rather be skiing says barbecue is never a bad choice.
3685.24s: Yeah, it's always like pretty solid.
3690.60s: I mean, this is just another prime example of volume being a massive indicator because
3699.88s: again, like the big move started here with this giant gap up, but the big volume started
3707.38s: like several days before.
3711.40s: Let me go to another period.
3712.40s: I'm going to get out of January.
3715.24s: Let's go to March 10th.
3719.24s: That was another period.
3720.24s: It looks like it started to run.
3725.44s: And there it ran intraday like 100%.
3729.68s: Yeah, so similar story.
3734.64s: Here the volume was a little bit weaker admittedly, but still right before the move.
3740.84s: In this case, two days before the move, there's a big massive spike in volume.
3747.16s: Let's go to another period.
3751.12s: The next one really of the decade would be in May of this year.
3757.36s: Let's go to May and then let's go to the 13th, which is when it had a 54% move intraday.
3767.12s: And this is the other example that we were talking about before.
3770.92s: So I mean, this generally confirms more or less what I already knew that the one thing
3778.28s: I can objectively point at with confidence and identify is before all of these larger
3788.36s: moves, we see an expansion and volume.
3792.36s: Now the tricky part is running a bit of a regression to see how many times the volume
3803.24s: starts to move, but price doesn't.
3808.20s: Because whenever we come up with a hypothesis and idea on how we think something might work,
3814.64s: it's really important for us to consider the alternate component to that idea.
3819.88s: So in this case, the idea is, and I can tell it's essentially efficacious to a degree,
3826.72s: where before the big move starts to happen, we see a pretty massive expansion and volume
3833.96s: and a higher percentage of by volume over the expanded volume days.
3841.72s: Now like this period would have triggered, but then it would have just been noise because
3849.44s: nothing happened.
3851.04s: And here volume went from four to 10, so it doubled.
3853.80s: It would have met that threshold, at least that pre-limbed threshold, and it would have
3857.68s: sustained too.
3858.68s: Like this would have looked actually really, really good.
3862.64s: So I think the other part that I look at when I trade stuff like this is the way that
3866.12s: we use stops to follow the move without getting too overextended.
3876.28s: Because I mean, it's one thing to make your money on the move that's unrealized, but
3885.08s: then sooner or later you have to realize the money.
3887.72s: Otherwise the money just goes back down as the stock goes back down.
3892.06s: And then you have nothing.
3893.06s: You just still hold the stock, which is cool.
3894.82s: If that's your goal, it's just a whole to stock.
3896.42s: That's totally fine.
3898.02s: But from a trading perspective, you would have made zero dollars in that sense.
3902.54s: So I think part of it is coming up with a slightly more robust plan that allows me to follow
3911.62s: the move up, capture as much of it as possible, and then as I'm getting stopped out on the
3916.98s: way down, not being stopped.
3921.46s: Not being stopped out prematurely because these things can really start to take shape and
3927.22s: run.
3928.22s: So like I have a whole host of things that I'm looking at in GameStop specifically this weekend
3936.14s: to help me understand a little bit more about the price behaviors that it specifically
3941.86s: exhibits.
3943.18s: But the one thing I can say that again, just doesn't surprise me at all is that essentially
3949.34s: for all of these large, these large intraday moves, they're connected by large volume.
3963.66s: But there are a lot of periods I can see of large volume that did not lead to a 50% move.
3971.74s: So I guess the other thing I could do here is maybe update the intraday move table to
3982.50s: track minimum 15% intraday moves.
3989.34s: So what I want to see now is a little bit more detail behind the side because I'm limiting
3996.90s: by 50% moves intraday, which is pretty massive.
4002.58s: I have to drop the file back in.
4015.54s: But even a 15% intraday move is pretty meaningful.
4020.34s: One says look for large volume and FTDs on the days where large volume didn't equal large
4026.34s: move.
4027.34s: I think we did some of that.
4041.98s: And you want FTDs on GameStop, which is here.
4051.22s: And then Don, for you, what threshold do you want to look at for FTDs?
4058.94s: Don says also large volume.
4060.46s: Yeah, I see what you're doing.
4061.78s: Yeah, so we've done a lot of this where we're not just looking at, and again, that what
4068.82s: makes the problem start to become so confounding when we have like 32 different variables that
4077.90s: we're trying to track simultaneously, right, which is really, really difficult.
4083.46s: So anyways, to that end, we can find instances.
4088.18s: Let's take a look.
4094.10s: That led to a decent move.
4098.22s: So like this expansion and FTDs from 16803 to 19213 didn't lead to any meaningful change
4107.02s: in price from a high in here.
4114.50s: This expansion and FTDs from 35,645 to 520,000 didn't lead to an expansion in price in FTDs.
4127.42s: So this is another example.
4137.66s: We went from 204 to 350 FTDs, no movement in price.
4147.02s: So what I'm doing right now, and I want to be very clear about it, I'm not suggesting
4154.50s: that there's no correlation between FTD and price movement.
4158.34s: That's not what I'm suggesting at all.
4160.58s: What I'm suggesting in doing this is that the relationship is a little more confounding
4165.70s: and there's more variables that are part of this than just the FTDs.
4172.82s: Chris says 34 days, we've done this a bunch of times.
4177.18s: We've done this with newt in a bunch of times, but sure, let me change this to count.
4183.50s: We'll go count from what day are we starting to count from?
4187.54s: That's the first thing we always have to align on.
4189.46s: Are we doing it the day before the FTD expanded or are we doing it on the day that the FTD
4193.98s: expanded or the day after the FTD contracts?
4201.10s: How many days after the initial bump until the big spike?
4206.66s: Okay.
4208.66s: So the initial bump.
4209.90s: So you're talking this would be the first day we're counting then, right?
4214.70s: So the initial bump would be in this case from like 204 to 350.
4217.94s: I just want to make sure I'm looking at it exactly as you want me to.
4233.82s: Well, in the meantime, I'll start.
4239.66s: Oh, that's too many.
4246.66s: It didn't realize that it slid me that far.
4257.50s: God, oh, that's the worst.
4266.10s: I was literally at 32.
4271.10s: And then I just went a little too far, just a little too far.
4276.30s: Right here we go.
4279.54s: 34.
4282.78s: This one, no, that's 34.
4284.34s: So this is, so this right here, it's going to count at its 209, but just proof of concept
4291.38s: right here is where I'm holding the mouse on the bottom.
4293.50s: It's telling me count is 34.
4297.30s: So I'm highlighting the whole row.
4299.38s: The high on this day was 1327.
4303.38s: The start of this was 20.
4305.86s: And this is where we're looking at the move from 204 GME FTDs to 350 3000 GME FTDs.
4315.94s: So that's 34 here.
4322.38s: And here's a big change.
4325.66s: Maybe we'll look at this one.
4327.02s: This one goes from 624.
4331.42s: Let's do this one for 34.
4338.62s: Here's 34 right here.
4341.10s: So on this one, we go from 27 to 21.
4348.18s: With 34 counted between these.
4354.50s: So again, the part I'm trying to make clear is there's more to this because here's the
4364.88s: problem that I think that sometimes we oversimplify in kind of an hour perspective on the trading
4371.66s: side is when the FTDs happen, there's a lot of different ways that they can manage them
4385.78s: without going to the open market, I think.
4389.38s: And I also think that we're dealing with such a multivariate system that trying to again,
4399.10s: like we'll count from this one.
4400.82s: This is starting from 1.
4404.70s: And then let's go to 34, 32, 33, 38, 34.
4410.82s: A key.
4412.82s: So this one we went from 2132 to 2165 over the 34 day period.
4418.66s: And that one.
4420.14s: And that was going from 305 to 596.
4427.98s: Ricky says hype dates have let me down every single time.
4430.30s: Yeah, that's probably fair.
4431.66s: Well, the other thing is like a lot of people have really big expectations for like the
4436.34s: expected move because I know a lot of people they're like really disenfranchised with the
4442.38s: way that game stop is moving right now.
4446.18s: But like this still is moving from a low of 1873 even to now to 22.
4453.66s: But again, I know that that's not ballering, that's not this, but that's still not a terrible
4459.42s: move in something that the entire broader component index that this thing would be a part
4465.94s: of is going down.
4467.42s: Like, that's not terrible.
4469.98s: So I think part of it is people also are like so fixated on the squeeze and getting
4474.62s: this big giant price movement, which I understand.
4478.54s: Like I also don't think it's worth like foregoing acknowledging that there's still price
4484.86s: movement going on.
4485.86s: It's just not as powerful as it might be.
4489.46s: But exactly.
4491.26s: So Ricky says screw that the apes demand the moon, which I totally understand.
4495.62s: I feel you brother.
4497.38s: But yeah, anyways, I still see something that's one from 18 to 22, which is not a terrible
4501.86s: move.
4502.86s: It's four points on something that's 18.
4505.22s: So anyways, yeah, what we found is for like these FTDs even from like some of these really
4510.06s: big moves.
4511.06s: Let's check this one because this one went from let's check the first expansion like
4514.94s: this one.
4515.94s: This might be something cool.
4516.94s: So this one from 906.
4518.70s: So let's go up 34 days.
4522.94s: Here.
4525.94s: 32.
4531.62s: So this went from 35.
4535.86s: Moving from 35,000 to 900,000 FTDs.
4540.28s: This went from 3565 to 32.
4546.42s: So there's a little bit more again than just the FTDs and then that that's the really, really
4553.22s: difficult part.
4554.22s: Anytime I talk to Newton about this, it took me a while to even wrap my brain around
4558.78s: the different counting functions, whether we use 30, 32, 34, 35.
4564.74s: One of the things I was doing is I download this myself so that I can kind of manipulate
4569.90s: it in my way without messing up, you know, Newton's work.
4574.22s: And I've run a bunch of different regressions, unessentially all of these different FTD
4580.06s: metrics and then combinations of them.
4584.02s: And there's just it's mixed.
4586.58s: It's very, very mixed.
4589.26s: That's the really hard part here.
4591.38s: The one thing I can tell you that has been highly efficacious is finding periods where
4599.70s: volume in the underlying itself expands.
4603.30s: But again, that's probably like a boring answer to a lot of people not necessarily what
4608.78s: you might want to hear.
4612.42s: So this is 34 and this took us from 27 to 31.
4620.94s: So a lower move, essentially, than we've seen in the last couple of weeks without anything.
4630.14s: So yeah, Chris, does that?
4633.70s: I just wanted to give the idea that we're looking at here like a solid exploration.
4639.90s: Because again, like I'm learning, I don't know either.
4642.50s: I'm trying to figure it out the same as you guys.
4645.02s: I do not pretend that I know or have some sort of strong, predictive quality again beyond
4650.26s: volume.
4651.26s: I can confidently point at volume and say this is going to be a part of it whenever things
4655.62s: start moving.
4657.22s: And that's not unique to GameStop.
4659.30s: That's what I use as an indicator for a lot of what I look at because volume is almost
4666.34s: always going to be a part of the puzzle.
4668.98s: But with something like this, it's just really tricky because there's so many, so many
4675.82s: sub components that are very difficult to track.
4683.86s: Matt says, would the fact that they fail to deliver mean that FDDs wouldn't make price
4687.58s: move in the theory that they can keep failing to deliver using different ETFs will won't
4692.22s: be predictable?
4693.98s: Well, I think they're incentivized to not continue to fail to deliver for overly extended
4703.70s: durations of time, which is part of the reasons why I think they go through the redemption
4708.46s: creation cycles with component ETFs.
4712.10s: So I view that more so as a way for them to juggle and not to get snagged with repeated
4719.90s: FDDs, which then starts to potentially negatively impact some of the standing that
4727.38s: they'll have with the exchanges.
4729.82s: So I view the FDD cycles to be difficult to nail down for that exact reason because there's
4737.78s: different ways that they can satisfy FDD's short term by kind of playing this juggling
4743.46s: game, which makes it very difficult then to identify.
4749.90s: Chris says, oh, Chris, you are here.
4752.14s: Why don't you leave me hanging?
4752.98s: I was trying to look at your idea and you just bounced.
4755.82s: Don says, Matt, I think that the juggling is how they buy, how they get by what bit is
4761.62s: all their animal social liquidity was exhausted.
4763.50s: I agree with that.
4764.50s: I think that was a big, big part of this.
4767.38s: So to Don's point, he's saying that all their animal sources of liquidity were exhausted.
4774.34s: And I completely agree with that.
4775.62s: I think that's one of the reasons why we see the movement that we do in GameStop is
4780.74s: when liquidity is so strapped, they run out of places to go.
4786.14s: But for those that haven't seen, I think that this is like a must watch video for any
4791.50s: ape.
4792.50s: Is this one here?
4793.50s: ETF.
4794.50s: I'm looking forward, sorry.
4814.46s: This guy.
4821.50s: A key.
4823.74s: Euphoria Web says, Chris, you're a clairvoyant.
4828.06s: Tell me where I'll be in five years, please.
4829.82s: Also, Chris, if you are clairvoyant, really, I have to be honest with you.
4833.58s: One of the big questions I have is one is when this is fucking sciatica, go away.
4837.74s: Today's my anniversary, actually, for the sciatica shit starting and this marks one full month
4843.38s: of this.
4844.58s: So while you're answering euphoria about the five year plan, I would be actually really
4849.66s: cool with just a few months, maybe like two months.
4853.10s: Is this still going in two months?
4855.10s: That would be great.
4859.38s: Captain Chris says made 46K on June 6th.
4865.30s: Wouldn't have known this if it wasn't from Newton's hype dates for June 6th.
4869.46s: Yeah, that's awesome.
4870.46s: That's great that you're able to cash in on June 6th.
4873.86s: That's awesome.
4874.86s: That's absolutely awesome.
4876.34s: We take a look at June 6th.
4880.18s: Key?
4881.18s: Yeah.
4882.18s: That's a great day.
4883.18s: Big, big move.
4886.26s: So again, the way I, because I traded this and I traded this, but the way that I traded
4895.18s: this was like literally off of expansion and volume.
4901.74s: So we can see volume when crazy as the stock was flying towards the moon at least.
4910.02s: And then it started coming back down.
4911.70s: We can see volume contracting, contracting, contracting, starting to get really quiet.
4916.78s: So it's really normalizing essentially to these levels and then all of a sudden massive
4922.34s: volume.
4923.90s: And so the cool part is is like even on the day of the move, you can see this volume
4928.70s: coming in because as this volume is building on the day, early in the day, it starts to exceed
4936.30s: the previous day entire volume while there's still plenty of time left in the day.
4941.58s: And as that's happening, that's kind of like your, your red warning system that like
4944.94s: some shit's going on.
4946.90s: What it is, we don't always know, but some things happening.
4950.58s: So this is one of the things that I pay attention to personally.
4955.50s: And it's because I'm an idiot.
4957.62s: I'm not as good as trying to connect a lot of different dots and stuff like that.
4962.66s: And I actually think that's one of the reasons why Newton, he has a fascinating approach
4967.62s: to, to GameStop because a lot of what he does is he just holds the stock.
4972.78s: And by just holding the stock, you're, you're, you maintain exposure.
4980.26s: Now and that's more is like from an investor, from a trader perspective, I, there's an
4987.30s: opportunity cost to just holding.
4990.66s: And I need to make money on movement.
4993.22s: So most of my system is predicated around identifying movement so that I can hopefully
4999.82s: extract value while something is in motion.
5003.42s: And then as motion starts to calm down, I'll try to find my way into other things that
5009.14s: are showing a bunch of movement.
5016.46s: This says totally throwing this out there, but I suspect early November push as well as
5022.70s: January.
5023.70s: Yeah, maybe I have no idea.
5026.66s: I don't, again, like I don't try, I really don't try to even determine when I think something
5031.70s: is going to move because again, you've heard me say it, but like the one thing I know,
5036.94s: I, I will tell you, like I know what will happen is as this thing starts to move, all these
5044.50s: little tiny volume bars, there's going to be some monster volume bars that are going
5050.26s: to move.
5051.74s: While this thing starts to pick up momentum and before it has anything like this, it's
5057.50s: going to have periods of elevated volume into that period.
5062.78s: All of the previous squeezes that I've looked at specifically in GameStop, and this is
5067.82s: one of the things I was actually curious about is, is it quiet until the day of the move
5073.66s: and then does it start to run, but it doesn't.
5076.70s: I've seen in all of the dates I've looked at so far in GameStop for previous moves is
5081.26s: that before it has its biggest moves, you'll see these pre moves that start sprouting
5088.58s: up where the candles themselves wide now, volume starts expanding.
5093.66s: So to me, that's kind of a really simple thing to keep an eyeball out for.
5097.78s: So in this case, I literally just wait for volume to start coming up and, you know,
5105.42s: to who is it?
5108.62s: To Captain Chris' point, whether that's November, December, January, February, March, regardless
5115.02s: of the month or the mechanism that starts to drive it, that is going to happen.
5121.14s: Volume is going to move.
5122.70s: So whether it's an FTD that kicks it off in some way because as they're trying to go
5127.42s: to their favorite ETF and go through a redemption cycle, they can't get it there for
5131.74s: some reason.
5132.74s: So there's another regulation that's stopping them at that point in time, at that specific
5136.30s: instance for whatever reason that then forces them to do something else.
5140.82s: Or if it's driven from an Opex tailwinds because the option markets are getting super crazy
5145.26s: and there's a lot of people in their playing that are causing market makers to be longer,
5149.94s: short gamma, depending on what they're doing.
5152.66s: And they can exacerbate intraday moves.
5155.06s: Like all of those reasons why price and volume start to move, they cause the same thing to
5165.18s: occur volume.
5166.94s: So I limit down again from the trading perspective.
5171.06s: I limit down what I'm looking to be the cleanest signal I can find.
5175.98s: Now I enjoy again like that video I shared with you all a little bit earlier about the
5181.90s: ETF redemption cycle and the structural FTDs in shorting.
5186.70s: I'm interested in that because it's fascinating to me.
5189.22s: Literally it's fascinating.
5191.02s: But beyond that, it's really difficult to trade off of because as I go through the
5195.78s: data, there's a healthy mix of signal that leads to positive movement and negative movement
5203.78s: makes it really, really tricky in order to trade.
5208.98s: John Chris says Newton talked about June 6th for over a month before it happening.
5213.98s: He suspected the pattern almost two months based on, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying
5219.18s: is Newton is, well, I don't know if you're talking to me or I see you're talking to Alfonso.
5225.82s: Yeah, but I mean, also to I remember Newton was like really, really stoked about the eighth
5233.10s: of August, right?
5234.94s: He was really, really interested in eight aug, which there wasn't a whole lot that happened
5241.46s: there.
5242.46s: It wasn't a bad day, but the point is is I think it's important and Newton is fantastic
5248.58s: about this as with most of the people that I work with just in terms of exploring the
5253.34s: product.
5254.74s: It's really, really important for us to look at not just because this is the human tendency.
5260.94s: The human tendency is if I Eric, if I make 12 calls or predictions about what's going
5267.26s: to happen over a 52 week period, over the period of an entire year, if I make that number
5275.26s: of calls over a 52 week period and let's say I make 30 calls, let's say 22 of them are
5283.06s: wrong and eight of them are right.
5286.10s: What I'm going to do is focus on the eight that I'm right on.
5290.18s: And that's not even because I'm trying to be dismissive.
5292.58s: It's not because I'm trying to trick other people.
5296.58s: It's because that's human tendency is to look at the positive outcomes.
5302.10s: So when I look at stuff, one of these things, I'm really, really careful with doing and it's
5308.86s: from my trading background.
5310.78s: As you could tell when we were doing the FTD stuff or even when I was looking at price
5314.22s: by volume earlier in the live stream is I'm interested in not just identifying the
5319.46s: periods where something worked in my favor, but I want to look at the periods where the
5324.54s: perceived signal occurred, all of those instances and then see what happens.
5330.46s: So again, a really good example of that is this move here.
5336.22s: According to the volume component that I'm telling you about, this is an example where
5341.74s: it didn't work.
5343.06s: This is an example where if I started buying in here on 25 March and I didn't perfectly
5350.06s: time this exit on this gap down somehow, then I would just be sitting there holding a losing
5356.30s: trade, which is part of trading.
5359.86s: We've become so strange as traders with like a complete inability to be okay with losing
5366.94s: positions and understanding that while we're in the process of trying to come up with
5372.06s: what we think might happen, we're going to get it wrong a bunch and that's okay.
5376.30s: As long as we're not betting the farm every single time, you can get it wrong a ton
5380.58s: of times and then the times that you get it right, if you have good money management,
5384.54s: you can make way more than what you would have lost on those other periods.
5388.26s: But again, that's a little bit more of just a general traders approach from investing
5393.54s: is very different.
5394.54s: And it looks like we have Chris that also joined us in outliers supporter.
5398.14s: Thanks, bro.
5399.14s: Welcome.
5400.14s: Welcome to the game.
5402.78s: ApoSpade says, Tom of hype dates do nothing, which is fine.
5405.66s: Yeah, exactly.
5407.06s: Because even as different people, some people want to pick the date so that they're the
5411.66s: guy or gal that did it.
5414.02s: And there's a lot of people that really just enjoy that the ego is sawing effect of being
5419.86s: right.
5421.58s: But way more importantly is as people come up with like these different predictions, these
5427.02s: different hype dates is the exchange of information.
5430.10s: We get to learn a lot from people and what they're looking at and the way that they're
5435.78s: arriving at their conclusions.
5437.02s: And I have to be honest with you, a lot of the due diligence that people send to me,
5441.74s: I don't find very robust just from an analysis perspective, but I find it fascinating.
5448.10s: And almost all of them have really interesting pieces that I can look at and say, Oh, interesting.
5454.26s: I might not have considered that before.
5456.74s: And that's exactly what Newton is a wizard at as the scribe of GME because he takes all
5464.18s: these individual pieces and he starts collecting them and he builds this really incredible reference
5469.86s: sheet for all of us to use and he maintains it on his own time so that we can have a collated
5477.30s: source of information, which is absolutely massive, I think.
5485.78s: You for you, let me go back.
5489.78s: You for you says also the cash with theoretically bringing buyers, no, it could, but again, like
5496.38s: from I assume you mean buyers from the stock, right?
5499.42s: Like people interested in becoming long game stop because if you're referring to it in
5504.74s: that context, just because a company has cash, doesn't mean I'm going to buy it again.
5510.06s: I buy a company is a true investor, not as a fan of game stop, not as anybody that's interested
5516.62s: in the story, just as an objective investor. Cash doesn't mean much to me.
5522.62s: Cash can be used for good for bad. It can be used well.
5526.70s: It could be used poorly. What I care about is the efficacy of a business.
5532.86s: Does a business make money? Does a business have a promising road map to continue making money
5538.94s: into the future? Does a business have a moat that makes it difficult for other businesses to come
5545.66s: in and start scooping up my lunch? Is the business in a highly competitive landscape that makes
5552.14s: it difficult for it to grow and consume market share from other businesses? So those are just a few
5559.26s: things. So as an investor, it's not at all just about cash. If a company has a bunch of cash,
5566.54s: it's good for them. But as an investor, I need to know what the cash is used for.
5570.94s: The cash doesn't do me any favors. The cash is priced into the stock right now.
5576.38s: So if I'm an investor, I make money when the company appreciates in value, which then means
5584.14s: the stock price goes up as the company appreciates in value, meaning more revenue, more sales,
5590.38s: better profit margins. That's the shit that matters. So to your point, it would be something as
5596.78s: an investor, I would be like, Oh, interesting. This company has a lot of money. This company has,
5604.86s: I would consider to be a fairly revolutionary leader in Cohen because of what he did with GameStop
5611.58s: in the landscape that he did, which is not easy. So with that, I would be interested. But does
5617.98s: that mean I buy right now? Again, personally, no. If I didn't like the story, I have GameStop,
5625.18s: but it's more because I'm a fan, it's less because I think that at this exact second,
5631.10s: that's the best place for the money. So a lot of investors are going to wait until they see
5636.38s: what's happening with the money. What's the plan here? And what can we do with the capital to
5643.10s: then feed the business to be more successful? That's where it starts to get really interesting.
5648.06s: But then just having a few billion in cash again, it sounds like a ton of money to a regular
5653.34s: person like us, but is a company that it's not like this insane amount of money. Actually,
5659.34s: what percentage of US publicly rated companies have over two billion in cash on hand?
5675.18s: I'm not annoying. Round two. I tried somewhere else, right over here.
5691.98s: I didn't know the answer to this. I'm actually curious.
5703.50s: 15% of publicly traded companies have over two billion in cash on hand.
5712.14s: This is from companies market cap and finance charts. So I don't know, I didn't like click
5719.50s: into the source. I don't know how efficacious it is. But yeah, Andrew says grab Jamie with both
5727.58s: hands, just my opinion. I think that that's again, that's totally, totally fair. I think there's a
5734.46s: lot of different ways to approach markets. So for the people that have a more investor mindset,
5743.42s: where we want to get in when it's cheap, we want to get in before the rest of the market starts
5749.10s: identifying the future value of the product. Yeah, like I can see why people specifically investors
5757.26s: would want to get in a little bit early for those reasons. For me, again, I'm a trader. I need
5763.58s: things to move and there's a significant opportunity cost to my capital. So I'm very cautious about
5771.10s: where I choose to put money. And in order for things to literally earn my money, I have to see
5777.42s: certain behaviors. And it's why in GameStop, I still have the shares as I've told you all.
5784.38s: But I do not have the same speculative long option positions or short option positions
5791.42s: as I had on previously because it's not doing this. This I can make money off of this. I can make
5797.34s: money off of this. I can make money off of this is difficult to make money off of for me.
5804.06s: So there's a couple different ways that I have to play the product in order again,
5810.30s: for it to make sense for my book. But for an investor, if again, the hypothesis is we trust Cohen,
5818.22s: we think he's going to do some magical stuff for the company. And now he's equipped with a few
5822.54s: bill in cash to do it. Shit dude. Like that's a compelling argument. I'm so eager for the fourth.
5831.98s: I'm so eager for the fourth. I am so curious if and what they're going to say.
5839.90s: Because I haven't seen them say much about the offering. And the impetus behind it, the vision
5851.02s: for after it. Really Larry Chang has been like kind of my go-to information source. And he doesn't
5858.94s: really talk much about the company directly. He talks a lot about like broader things.
5865.90s: And the reason why I go to him is because I just don't see much come out from Cohen. Cohen
5871.34s: likes to troll on X, which is cool. But like I don't get a bunch of market data that I can evaluate
5878.86s: the product from that unfortunately. So when I'm looking at GameStop, I'm very, very, very eager
5887.58s: to see what comes out on the fourth. Euphoria says Larry definitely says things that way by
5892.78s: design. Absolutely. And he makes a lot of parallels. I noticed that with GameStop in general. I don't
5899.98s: know if it's just like an aura about the kind of people that it draws into its sphere or what it is.
5906.62s: But like if we look at anybody that I've seen really communicate around GameStop, roaring kitty,
5913.34s: Chang, Cohen, none of them are like direct communicators, none of them. Which again, I just find
5922.86s: that interesting. It adds a fascinating, fascinating story behind it.
5930.46s: Willie says he definitely talks in an abstract manner. I appreciate his post as they signal
5935.26s: an involved management team. I agree, a completely agree. Willie says I can sleep at night knowing
5940.70s: the management team. They're super fucking smart. Like they're super smart, bro. When I was reading
5945.98s: through Cohen's deposition for the... What the fuck is the case? I forgot. Who's it? BVBY.
5959.18s: So in that case, you could tell a lot about the way that he handles stress in different data points.
5968.54s: And he's smart, dude. He's really smart. And he came from a pretty effective business background.
5977.98s: So yeah, I completely agree with like having a lot of confidence.
5983.42s: Ape of Spade says they can't signal specifics, but they need to let Ape's investors see
5988.94s: they let them know. Yeah, I agree. And again, one of the things is it's okay to talk about broad
5997.50s: plans. And that's why I'm hopeful that they'll do it, especially following the at the money. Because
6005.26s: like tons of huge companies give very specific plans about what they're doing over the next quarter.
6012.06s: And they can still execute against it because they have like a really good plan in place. That's
6017.34s: fairly robust. So I was literally just going to bring that up. That's a perfect point,
6024.86s: rebel dark side who says Ryan Cohen said we keep quiet and just work, which I agree. Like I think
6030.70s: that there's something there. But I think the problem is when exactly to your all's point in the
6037.42s: chat is if that's your approach, you can do that. And he does do that, I believe. But you're also in
6045.18s: a leadership position. You lead not just a company, but you lead the investors in the company.
6053.02s: And if we want like you all were talking about it earlier, other investors to be interested
6059.26s: in buying game step, buying game stop because we see the cash that it has now. Well, if we want
6065.26s: that to happen, we kind of have to have some ideas about what's going on here. Because if you know
6071.98s: nothing about Ryan Cohen, his leadership team, what his history is and kind of how he's a bit of
6077.98s: an activist investor and CEO. If you don't know any of that and you think about game stop, again,
6083.98s: completely agnostic to all of what we know as background. If you ask a regular person about
6089.82s: game stop, they're going to say, oh, it's a brick and mortar store that's dying like blockbuster.
6093.98s: And that's not a terrible, that that's not like a crazy assumption to come up with.
6098.86s: That's that it's a fair guess to take. But the way that they start to pivot that narrative for
6105.82s: kind of the lay or more hands off investor is by communicating and giving them some ideas about
6112.70s: what we're what our ideas are, what we're thinking about. Because again, like during the September
6117.34s: 4th earnings, they literally can say something like we we had a good or bad quarter. I think the
6125.18s: quarter typically is not great for them. But we had a bad quarter. This is what happened. These
6131.50s: are some of the things we're doing to turn the company around. We did an at the money offering,
6135.02s: which increased our cash to $X billion. While we have a series of ideas on what we want to do
6142.70s: with it, we're interested in investing in the business, in acquiring other businesses,
6148.06s: in expanding our footprint, in expanding our audience. Like we can talk about all of those
6155.74s: ideas indicating some intent with giving zero specifics. And I still think that would be really
6163.74s: well received because unfortunately, I feel like the GME shareholders for so long have just kind
6168.78s: of been going on like pure faith, which fuck man. Like it's another reason why I love this whole
6176.86s: thing so much is because the community is so sticky. And it's so interesting to find that because
6185.74s: it's literally anomalous. Ape of space says, so why would they not? There must be a reason.
6192.22s: Exactly. And I agree with you there. If they don't on like why wouldn't they from the at the money
6197.50s: offering? It's because they don't owe anybody that necessarily. And they might be waiting until
6202.94s: whatever they're thinking of is a little more fleshed out. Like that's fairly common. So I do think
6209.90s: though that come the fourth of September, if they don't, that would lead a huge question mark in
6216.38s: my mind because much like what you're saying, Ape of Spades, I really don't know why they wouldn't.
6222.62s: And I agree with Chris here, Chris says closing stores is not bad. It's smart. Get rid of the cost.
6227.58s: We buy that's exactly correct. And I think I think closing stores in their case is not a bad move
6234.46s: at all. And I think it's smart that they're still leaning into expanding their successful stores
6242.94s: because there could be stores that are in a good location that when somebody needs some sort of
6247.58s: peripherals or hardware, they can just go grab it and go back home. Like that's huge. And that
6252.70s: can absolutely lead to a pretty good profitable picture. Now I think what we need more than that though
6260.62s: is again, to see GameStop pivot into the modern age. And to pivot into the potential audience that
6269.74s: is broader online gamers. And it doesn't have to be relegated to gamers again like as the chat
6275.82s: was pointing out, if we think that they should start expanding into other things, that's cool too.
6281.42s: And I think that it makes a ton of sense just exactly as Alfonso is bringing up like trading
6286.86s: cards, right? Like people are collectors. I think that makes a lot of sense. I sent Newton
6291.18s: Pokemon cards from one of our live streams. So yeah, like there's stuff that you really have to go
6297.50s: there to get, which is good. But when you look at a lot of their primary profit driving factors,
6303.02s: it's from console releases. And the reality of console releases is changing quite a lot.
6309.98s: And like we already talked about, the way you buy games is completely different. And I think it's
6314.94s: going to become increasingly digital. I think it'll probably be a point where it gets to where you
6319.66s: don't even have to store the game on your own machine. That it's just cloud-based completely. But
6325.26s: there's a lot of ways for I think GameStop to innovate and still tap into a similar audience,
6331.10s: which would be really, really efficient for them. I think at least. But we have to see,
6338.54s: yeah, we have to see what they're thinking and what they want to do. Because again,
6341.66s: that is one of the downsides that we have right now, is that we don't actually really know
6347.82s: where they're trying to pivot or what the model is. Alfonso says, where do you insert the disc in
6353.66s: MS Vision, bro? Yeah, you know, it's actually funny. My buddy, he was visiting his cousins who were
6361.66s: like really young. And he told them to, you know, like put the the disc and I think they were going
6366.30s: to play Call of Duty or something as cousins are young. And they put the disc and upside down.
6370.54s: So they like didn't even really know how it worked, which is hilarious. Makes total sense, but
6374.78s: just hilarious. Big fan of that.
6379.34s: G 33 says, Kitty said you were not looking hard enough. He gave us the answer. If you didn't
6385.10s: pay attention, you don't know. I don't know. Shit. If you guys know the answer, G 33, if you know
6389.90s: the answer, dog, tell me because I genuinely don't know. I tell you guys, I like, I am the village
6395.26s: idiot. I do not pretend to be the guy that knows because I do not.
6399.98s: Well, he says going into the tournament business would be a game changer. They are
6405.02s: usually organized at a local level. These can be massive and attendance. And I mean, they have like
6410.46s: really, really big offerings as well. So they have these broader competitions. Like I think getting
6421.26s: into some sort of gaming competition makes it ton of sense. I mean, I also think they can get into
6426.86s: media of some sort. Think of all the different games that it exists that people would love a Netflix
6433.58s: series on. Like how sick would that be where I don't know like super popular games, but if there's
6440.70s: like a, a, a wow, I know that's pretty popular. If there's a wow setup that GameStop could get
6446.70s: involved in in the production of different video game based TV series. Like I think that would be
6453.90s: sick. I think there's a ton of ways to go about it. Ape of trade says Witcher. Yeah. And they,
6462.30s: they did Witcher so dirty because who's that, who's the older guy vest vestimeer? They did
6469.18s: vestimeer so dirty. This straight up disrespectful of vestimeer. I can't believe they did them like
6474.14s: that. G 33 says ready player one is a big clue. Yep. I don't. I, I'm sure it is, but I also think you
6489.26s: might overestimate how dumb I am in my ability to connect those dots, but yeah.
6501.98s: Chris says AMC made a killing on the Taylor Swift crap. I don't know much about that, but that's
6506.46s: interesting. Everybody's interested in G 33's ideas. I, I mean, guys, you kind of know what the deal is.
6518.06s: Like G 33 doesn't know just like the rest of us. Nobody knows. Anybody that says that they
6523.74s: definitively know is it's, it's just a fallacy. It's untrue because we can't know none of us know.
6531.90s: Now I do think that there are probably hints on what we think might happen. That's fair. And I
6539.18s: think it's okay to have ideas, but I don't actually think anybody actually knows because nobody
6548.78s: up into this point has really nailed most of this stuff. Chris says movie on the Taylor Swift
6559.50s: tour movie. My daughter loved it. Oh, interesting. I did not know that. Yeah, I did not know that.
6566.62s: Oh, one sec. I got a.
6589.42s: Or barbecue just arrived. So I have my wife grab it really fast.
6593.42s: What else we got?
6605.58s: Andrew says did our cake get into serious? I don't know. I don't think there's really any way
6610.62s: for us to tell because the other thing at this point is I don't really know where they're at
6616.38s: with their capital. They're being roaring kitty versus slash Keith Gale depending on,
6622.62s: you know, which personality is transacting. But I think it wouldn't be insane, but I'm still
6635.26s: trying to fully track the pivot from GameStop to Chewy, whether it was a full pivot, partial pivot,
6641.50s: temporary pivot, like all those things I don't know, but they're actually hold on.
6653.74s: All right, yo, my head has gotten bigger.
6658.86s: There we go. So when we're thinking about the potential pivot of
6666.14s: of roaring kitty from GME to something like Chewy, at least temporarily, the one thing I can
6672.62s: clearly identify is he obviously got into Chewy. It seems partially from the fact that Cohen
6686.94s: is affiliated with Chewy. And it's also the reason why I surmised he did 9 million 1,000 shares
6694.54s: because also likely a shout out to Cohen. So the part that I don't understand though is beyond
6706.62s: the shout out to Cohen, like really why Chewy because I don't like that this cuts my horns off
6713.42s: because they my Viking tinfoil hat needs to be respected. Hold on, let you guys see, there you go.
6719.58s: There's the whole thing. My head has gotten bigger. So it a fat head, but there's the there's the
6729.66s: full hat. But when I look at the movement of Chewy, it's been okay, but not crazy.
6742.22s: And we think he got in what I forgot the data of the transaction was at like the 24th? Is that
6747.10s: yet in here? So he's not like crushing it in Chewy either. Now maybe there's some sort of
6754.62s: expectation for earnings, but I don't understand why he would have done this on the 24th
6760.54s: with the idea of playing earnings out here. It seems like for most of his prior speculative trades
6767.50s: that it would happen about a month out is what I've seen from like the rest of his footprint.
6774.30s: Unshore, but you know, so I'm not convinced that he did it necessarily for earnings.
6784.94s: Ape of spades, Willie says that aim to be his buff is here one day. Yeah, man, it's just been a long time
6792.38s: of working out, bro. Ape of spades says he does seem to be able to call it right before it moves.
6798.06s: Well, it's he gets in like 30 days is what I noticed from most of his prior trades. It's like
6802.94s: three weeks to four weeks that he starts to enter. And there's also a reality. Again, I'm not
6810.38s: insinuating that he's a pump and dumper. I don't believe that that's in his personality. I don't
6815.02s: believe that that's his intention whatsoever. But again, objectively speaking, I know for fact,
6823.02s: if Roaring Kitty posts something about his position, there's going to be other people going into
6827.82s: the position. I know that for fact. Now again, I do not think that that makes him a pump and dumper.
6833.90s: I think that that means that people really value what he does and they want to follow him.
6839.02s: But that that that is a price behavior that I can clearly identify as well. So I don't fully think
6850.14s: that that's what the game plan was in this case though. Like because I think Roaring Kitty knows better
6855.98s: about the ape community that the probability of a bunch of apes that have been in GameStop for
6863.82s: three years are going to just pour over into Choui. I just I don't think that he would think that
6870.06s: or expect that. So I'm unsure. Euphoria says doesn't DFV always end up update is yellow on red at
6878.78s: any time as GME position changes? I don't think so. I don't think that's true at all to be honest.
6885.98s: Because he went he went dark for a long time and you don't go from his account value.
6895.50s: What it was to what it was when he came back without doing some shit. So I would I would not
6905.98s: believe. Yeah, I would personally not believe that he updates it every time he makes a change.
6913.82s: I don't I don't see that personally. Euphoria says what if his shares never changed?
6921.10s: It could be, but I believe it to be exceedingly unlikely that his shares never changed.
6930.14s: Could be, but again, my opinion mega unlikely. The reason why I think it's super unlikely
6941.66s: is because in this case, he only had $6.3 million left right here. And we saw his filing and his
6955.50s: filing. I'm near positive, pegged him into Choui on the 24th. So even if we give him kind of mid price
6965.50s: on the 24th, let's call it like 2585. So 2585 times 9 million, 1000 shares. He needs 232.675 million,
6982.46s: which that's essentially the value of this account.
6988.94s: So with that is the value of this account. I don't believe that to be the case. Now the other thing
7000.06s: that hooked on options, that's a great name. That's such a great name. What a great name.
7006.78s: Said, didn't they reduce the flow? They did. I think in Choui.
7011.74s: So, Spostcar says he has other accounts. Yeah, so that's another argument I hear that I again,
7018.46s: he spoke against directly himself. So I take him at his word. So if I look up GME live stream,
7028.54s: or roaring kitty, my bad, roaring kitty live stream.
7038.06s: What a gang. I think we're back at it. I've never had that happen before. So I got like this
7044.54s: in video codec error. I don't even know what that is. I tried to open up another tab. Maybe
7050.06s: because I literally just have too many tabs open or something. I have a built computer. I
7054.94s: literally went and did my standard move when it comes to computers. And I always overbuild the
7061.90s: computer. I got it from origin. And I essentially talk to the nerds and see what kind of computer
7069.98s: they recommend for essentially being able to do all the crazy shit. And so anyways,
7076.86s: it's an expensive computer that should be good. But for whatever reason, it's it's struggling.
7082.22s: As soon as I opened up this tab, which I can help but find interesting. All right, back to this though.
7088.78s: So the comment about their being another account. Let's listen to this together. I like to share
7096.78s: this because again, like I prefer it not to be based on opinion as much as possible. And to
7102.30s: base it on as much general data as I can. So I'm going to turn on the desktop audio so that you
7109.42s: can hear this should come through. And then let's just listen to this part where he brings up his
7114.22s: account right here. It's a true yolo. Again, I suppose. I know there's some cash there. That's
7121.02s: what I mean. It depends on your positions. But it's another yolo again. You know what I'm saying?
7127.82s: It's how I roll. So that's that's out there. But I seen those headlines. E-Trade.
7134.22s: So then he just throws a little bit because E-Trade was talking about whether or not they're
7138.38s: going to close this position. So then he just plays by removing their logo on the HTML just being
7143.98s: fun. Good. Those positions are there. Those positions are there. But I'll do it. I'll remove it. Don't
7149.26s: make me. Don't don't make me. I win too. And I know how to do it back. I mean he's like oh he's
7157.50s: squinting. And there's a wake. Oh my what the hell. Well that's where it was right word. That's
7161.90s: where at the whole. See I wait until the whole because if if if and so yeah there you go. There
7168.54s: you can hold it. I don't know why it does it. It's going down. I get especially once I'm
7173.18s: involved because they get to share some of your time. I'm doing my best. I'm going to do it.
7178.94s: There you go. All right. Yeah. Those are my only positions. You know as you know.
7184.22s: I see it's got a lot there. So those yeah those are my only positions. You know as you know.
7190.14s: So that's that's kind of the part I'm highlighting is that he talks about at this time.
7194.86s: These being his only positions. He talks about that that's the cash that he has in here.
7200.86s: And he also talks in the stream about the accusations that he has other accounts or backers.
7207.58s: People that are essentially feeding him money and he says like this is his account.
7211.50s: And there's nobody else helping him. So I understand the idea that maybe we think there's
7220.70s: another account that he's pulling money from or doing something else in but he kind of talks
7224.94s: about it directly in this live stream. So I just take him at face value. The
7232.38s: Robo says unless you consider cash a position. The reason why he says that you have to listen to
7236.86s: it in context is because he's holding cash in the account. So when he says these are my only
7242.38s: positions unless you consider cash a position because he has cash. So then he's just tying those
7249.98s: two together. That's why he's saying that he's not suggesting that he you know unless you consider
7254.78s: cash a position. I have a bunch of a cash in another account. Now I don't know right.
7259.50s: Tim Foyle hats on. He could. And I also think that it would be highly unlikely with how much money
7265.66s: he's made that he would put literally all of his money into this. But my other assumption on top
7273.74s: of that is that he wouldn't have another account with hundreds of millions of dollars that he expected
7281.66s: to trade with and not have it in there from the jump. That I don't see happening because it just
7287.50s: it wouldn't it wouldn't make sense. Now one of the difficult parts with this whole saga is a lot of
7293.42s: it doesn't make sense. It's just kind of strange. So yeah, I think when I look at the the implications of
7302.30s: that when I think about when I think about the positions like I just I don't see him squirreling
7311.50s: up another quarter billion dollars to simultaneously have a GME and Chewy position is my guess.
7323.50s: Um Alfonso says, what was that video from? This is two months ago.
7330.06s: RK clearly counted his position as having 150 plus securities in an early video. Yeah, that's a long time ago.
7337.98s: Yeah. So one of the things I went back and I listened to a lot of his OG videos to learn a little bit
7345.58s: more about him. And in this case, what I learned is that he actually changed his style pretty massively.
7354.86s: So in his early videos, you can see all these stocks that he looks at, he kind of considers himself
7360.14s: this value investor, but he talks about his pivot from being a value investor. And I think it was
7367.66s: in one of these spreadsheet videos because what I learned from that is he started as a value investor,
7374.14s: but then he was he literally talked about this himself on paraphrasing because I don't remember it
7378.14s: exactly, but he talks about how he got tired of essentially coming up with all these different
7385.50s: companies, coming up with all these individual names and then putting positions on and then they're
7389.66s: just not moving. So I don't know what led him to kind of sorry, this is hot. I gotta take it off.
7397.18s: I don't know what led him to make the pivot in from having a bunch of different names like you can
7403.66s: see here, tons of names to being in just one thing. I don't know what led to that pivot. That's a
7409.98s: massive, massive pivot to make though. Rebel Darksides, honestly, I think you know Ryan Cohen
7420.30s: and would dilute and that's why he laughed and I think he just wants to be, Jeremy to be something
7424.54s: like for real. Yeah, I think so too. I don't think because the other, the other component to this
7433.10s: is even if there's a squeeze, he can't get out in a squeeze at the top and I think he knows that.
7442.46s: So even during these squeezes and these different price patterns, I don't, he when you're trading a
7447.98s: position that size, you literally run out of liquidity. So I think that there's kind of an element
7456.06s: to the way that he has to trade things that I completely agree with you guys that he wants it to
7461.34s: be a legitimate company. I think that without a doubt. Robo says that phrasing is so specific.
7472.94s: It is, but again, like I think, well, listen to it again together because I think it's specific
7478.14s: within context and the context when he says that he hovers his mouse over the cash position
7486.22s: in his account because when he says this is my only position, he's essentially front running the
7493.02s: statement of, oh, cash is a position. So that's why he does it. But here we go. I'll bring the audio
7501.26s: back up. Let's kill this. And then let's, let's listen together take our new positions. But
7511.34s: hello again, I suppose, I know there's some cash there. That's what I mean. It depends on your
7515.42s: positions. But it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying? It's how I roll. So that's
7522.86s: that's out there. But I'll take so those, yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you know
7531.50s: about me, I'll take so, cheers. I got a lot there. So those, yeah, those are my only positions. You
7541.18s: know, as you know about me, I'll take, it's a true yellow again. I suppose, I know there's
7549.50s: some cash there. That's what I mean. It depends on your positions. Right. So you see what I'm talking
7553.90s: about? He says it's these are my only positions. I know there's some cash in there. Then he
7562.30s: talks about his choice. You know, he's like, I'm down to do a yellow, you know, unless you consider
7569.82s: cash a position. So he's referring to the cash in this scenario, like very clearly, it looks like
7577.74s: the preferences for the hat back on. So we'll suffer for a little longer. But he's very clearly,
7583.50s: in my opinion, referring to the cash in this account, because when he says these are my only
7588.94s: positions, he's obviously front running the statement that a lot of people make, oh, cash is a
7593.82s: position. So that's what I think. Willie says, don't blame the guy for pivoting and being more
7604.94s: aggressive while he leave money on the table. Yeah, I agree. Completely agree.
7610.14s: Afonzo says, maybe that's when Burry identifying the height short interest, he began changing
7614.70s: his investment style. Oh, that's a great question. I think Burry got in quite a bit after he was
7620.22s: already pretty focused on game stop. Again, just listening to the previous live streams or videos
7625.10s: that he did that I've heard from him. But yeah, I think Burry, he, because this is what I try to
7636.30s: talk to you guys about from a trader's perspective. We look at the same shit. So the way that I found
7643.34s: this move here is the same way. It's literally the same exact way that if we go back into this move,
7652.54s: let's grab GME. If we go back into this move, like most of us traders saw the same shit. I know I
7661.90s: did. And I started trading the volume here, just like I started trading the volume on a bunch of
7667.74s: other things because a lot of us traders just look for volume. So I think Burry in this case,
7677.18s: so essentially something that was structurally over-shorted, like again, a lot of us did because
7683.90s: that's what causes these kinds of gamma squeezes. And that's why it's important to delineate in my
7689.26s: opinion from a short squeeze from a gamma squeeze because I think in something like this, there was
7694.46s: a bit of a mix. Alfonso says Burry was before RK, oh, interesting. That's really good to know.
7702.22s: That's really, really good to know because I think I remember him talking about Burry in one of his
7707.26s: videos, but I didn't, I took it as he was already in the video. I didn't realize that I'm trying to
7716.14s: find where he talks about it. Was it a live stream maybe? Yeah, I think it's in here.
7728.94s: Yeah, I can't remember which one.
7734.86s: This is three years ago. Let me change the question to this. Maybe Alfonso, you can help me. When
7742.14s: did Kitty first get into GameStop? That would help me a lot because I really, for whatever reason,
7750.22s: just I took it as he was in before because he was already covering GameStop super, super close.
7754.86s: I think this one. Euphoria Web says, hoping a single dude will buy 9 million shares as horrible.
7765.90s: That's not how this should move. Also, to be completely clear, I don't know what comment you're
7772.78s: referring to, but it's not just him. His 9 million volume isn't the only thing that moves this.
7780.30s: You need more than him. For example, for this move to happen here, which was a low of 1231 to
7787.58s: a high of 17, so a five point move, big move. But in order for this move to happen, it was 36 million
7793.98s: shares traded. His 9 million, let's just pretend if we put all of his 9 million on a single day here,
7801.50s: would have contributed, but you need way more volume than what Rory and Kitty can provide.
7808.46s: This move here, it's 187 million, then 206 million. The point I'm highlighting there is,
7817.10s: I'm not sure Euphoria, which comment you're referring to, but his volume is part of the puzzle.
7823.98s: It's not the puzzle. There's definitely more to it than not.
7827.90s: Bronson says, why file 13G on Chewy, but not GME? They have a very close float size.
7833.82s: He didn't hit the threshold. That's what it comes down to. There's no incentive for him to file
7838.54s: a 13G other than when he's legally required to. Oh, there's Burry right here.
7843.50s: I'm trying to say there was another comment that I missed. Okay.
7860.06s: Ape of spades says RK by 7 June 19. Yeah. And then so we can see when did Michael
7870.54s: Barry, in case you're wondering if you type in the word, when did Michael, the first thing that pops up
7875.90s: is when did Michael Jackson die? When did Michael Barry by GameStop stock?
7885.02s: In Q4 of 2018. Yeah. So I think you guys are spot on.
7888.86s: Yeah. I think that's exactly. I think you're your right spot on.
7898.54s: And then before liquidating his entire stake in the third quarter of 2020.
7902.62s: So it does look like based on the timelines that you gave me again, I'm not sure what they are,
7911.82s: but I can see where Burry bought in for sure. I'm not positive where the cat got in, but
7919.02s: if it's as you guys say, then Burry definitely would have been in before. Thank you for that.
7924.54s: That's actually really, really helpful.
7934.78s: Rebel Darkside says, okay, what if he buys back the 9 million shares that I think he sold from
7939.42s: GME and comes back specifically with this volume more than the volume, what do you think?
7943.42s: I think a few things. I think the first thing is if we see him unwind, his chewy position,
7956.38s: we'll see it. And he'll also have to file. So we'll know when he does it.
7962.30s: And if he chose to go on the open market and start getting into GameStop with that position,
7968.38s: it's doable, but he would bid himself up so much because of how small the volume is right now.
7977.82s: So my guess is he probably would start with options, to be honest, because if he wanted to gain
7983.02s: 9 million share exposure again and here, the total volume for again, the last five days on average
7990.70s: is 3.7 million. So he is essentially three times that, not quite like two and a half, but still,
7996.78s: he would consume all of the volume himself. He would bid himself up sky high.
8002.06s: So in that case, what I imagine he would do is use options to start bringing volume into the stock.
8010.62s: And then as volume comes into the stock, he could start accumulating. But I don't think he's
8015.98s: going to come into something like this and then just decide on, you know, the 26th of August,
8022.70s: the buy 9 million shares or 9 million 1000 shares because he's going to murder himself,
8028.14s: just trying to get a fill on that. It's going to be a completely one-sided market at that point.
8033.58s: And he's going to be front running himself to the negative side. It wouldn't be useful.
8039.02s: So before you said, all is that assuming he doesn't own GME currently, well, I wouldn't say that.
8044.54s: I think that it's reasonable for us to assume he doesn't own as big of a GME position.
8050.38s: Now again, based on the math, the quick math that we did earlier, he would need like $230 million
8057.98s: ish in order for him to put on his Chui position, 230. So if he has $230 million that's committed to
8065.74s: Chui based on the 13G filing, which again, we can see that. Then in this case, it leaves him with
8071.90s: 30 mil ish. So what he's doing with that 30 mil, I don't know. Does that mean that he has some
8079.10s: style of a position in GME? I don't know. Does that mean that it's sitting in cash? Again,
8084.14s: I have no idea. But what I do know is based on this last screenshot in the overwhelming likelihood,
8092.22s: again, just based on the breadth of evidence in front of us, it does look like it's highly likely,
8097.34s: highly likely that he unwound the majority of this GME position to move into Chui.
8104.06s: And then whatever he's doing with the residual, I have no idea. But
8110.30s: it only he does until he posts another yellow update or kind of gives some sort of hints.
8115.50s: I don't think there's a way for us to definitively know. Now, one of the interesting things here is
8120.62s: Newton pointed out to me in one of the live streams that we did together that he's never decreased his
8125.34s: position size before in GameStop, at least in the updates that he's shown. But we don't really know
8131.74s: about that either because there's a lot of periods that are not captured that we haven't seen.
8138.14s: But I think it's a fair assumption to make on Newton's behalf. Now, this was on the 13th of June. So
8146.06s: I suppose Karst says, what about leveraging his GME shares? I don't think they offer you margin
8150.38s: on GME. So yeah, I don't think there's leverage available to him. And I don't think he can buy Chui on
8159.74s: margin either. That's the brokers protecting themselves. And I actually, I kind of get that because
8169.26s: if you're a broker, you take on a massive, massive amount of this risk.
8175.58s: Before he says, okay, so what if he sold some of his shares when they were much higher? Yeah,
8180.38s: let's take a look at that example. So this was on the 13th of June. So if we look at GameStop from June
8188.30s: 13th, which is here, that's the peak. Like it wasn't higher after that. So it's a good question. But
8200.30s: again, yeah, it doesn't line up at least with the performance of GameStop.
8208.54s: Bifi says you would never cash out GME for Chui. Yeah, I mean, you're entitled to think that and I
8213.74s: get it. And I understand that a lot of people feel that way. So yeah, I would never tell you either
8222.54s: way because like I don't know. But what I do know again is that as of the 13th of June, his account
8229.02s: value is 268 mil. And his Chui position 9,000,000 shares likely takes at the very least 230 mil. So
8239.02s: yeah. And again, in that live stream that we saw together, this one that again, you should check out
8247.98s: for sure, this one here. And you can see the time hack. It's kind of like towards the the
8254.46s: latter 60% of the video. He says he talks about this and he says it's his only account, his only
8260.54s: positions. So I think what he showed us here is what he had. And I think that again, in my opinion,
8273.34s: just looking at it objectively, not what I want the cat to do, not what I hope somebody else
8279.42s: might have done, but just looking at the evidence as best as an objectively as I possibly can. To me,
8285.74s: it looks like it's far more likely that he closed the meaningful portion of GME here.
8292.46s: And then likely bought into Chui. Again, whether he flattened totally, I don't know. He definitely
8298.94s: would have money left over to maintain a position in here. It just wouldn't be 9,000,000 shares.
8304.78s: The other thing that I consider with this specific scenario is what's the probability that
8314.14s: he has options involved. And I've been trying to keep a really close eye on that. And because that's
8322.06s: that is my wheelhouse that I feel supremely confident in my ability to connect to dots is compared
8327.90s: to most of this other stuff where I'm just kind of reasoning through it as best I can. But I haven't
8333.98s: seen anything resembling like 30 million dollar style positions. So he could, but he might be
8341.66s: trading a little bit smaller. So yeah. Chris says if he can remove that he trade logo, he can
8355.42s: remove the rest of the info or change it. Yeah, he could. And again, it just depends on how you
8361.26s: want to interpret his messaging, right? Like I believe him. I take him at his work when he says,
8366.94s: this is my account. These are my positions. I take him at his word. If he has other stuff
8372.62s: somewhere else, we have absolutely no idea. But I think that he also understood that talking about it
8379.50s: in that context really was about trust, I think. So yeah, I mean, I take him at his word personally.
8388.54s: But I wouldn't feel any type of way about somebody that says like, oh, I think he has other accounts
8394.70s: or other positions like I could totally see that too. Again, in an objective landscape, the way
8400.70s: the way that I arrive at my opinion is just at what I can make the best inferences off of. Not
8408.70s: what I hope happens, not what I prefer to happen, but what I can try and objectively connect
8415.26s: dots to. That's the way I look at it personally. I will he says there's bulls, there's bears,
8423.90s: and then there's cats. Yeah, it's awesome. That's so awesome.
8430.46s: Ricky says Martin Screly says Kitty's positions are probably Photoshopped. I don't trust Martin
8436.86s: Screly as far as I can throw him. And again, if nothing else with somebody like the cat,
8444.38s: like I do believe what he says, like I trust him. The reason why I trust him is that he has
8450.30s: absolutely no incentive to lie to people. He at the start of this even before all of this madness
8458.86s: started, right? Like let's go when he came back here in two June. Here he had $210 million.
8469.66s: That is the ultimate fuck you money. That is never need anything ever again, level of money.
8477.34s: So I think that there's no reason for him the cat to come on a live stream or to come back
8485.82s: and start bullshitting or fabricating these positions. Like I just don't see any incentive here
8491.10s: for him at all to do that. Even if we take it a step further and go back to his final update,
8497.02s: he had $35 million. That's still fuck you money. That is still rest of my lifetime and likely that
8506.46s: he has a heir to him because I know that he has a family. I think he has a daughter.
8511.42s: They're good forever. They're completely good. So I just don't see somebody with a massive incentive
8518.46s: to come out here and start bullshitting.
8524.70s: Now, Fanzo says what puzzles me is about R.K. entering Chewie is that Chewie is controlled by
8529.50s: Pet Smart who own the vote or the Class B shares. They can do whatever they want at any time.
8536.70s: Yeah, I agree. And I think kind of to some of the chat's point, I think part of the reason,
8542.54s: at least the only connection I can find is Collins connection to it. I think if Chewie wasn't
8555.02s: associated to Cohen, I don't think he would have put a position on it personally.
8560.54s: I think a big reason why he did it is because he's just kind of trolling a little bit. He's having fun.
8565.26s: He has fuck you money and he's playing fuck you games with his fuck you money as he should.
8572.78s: So yeah, Robo says it's an all-time lows R.K. is a deep value investor. He says he used to be.
8581.26s: I don't think that he would identify as that anymore, to be honest.
8585.18s: Because I have to find that for you guys. I have to figure out which video it's from.
8593.26s: Let me see.
8599.42s: All right, come across a new stock. I had it to the list. It doesn't happen often,
8602.78s: but I'm excited. I'm excited when I come across a new one.
8606.94s: What I've noticed too, I used to, I'm not going to start one time ago, but
8609.58s: so so many times fall off and get ahead on because I've made mergers and acquisitions and stuff and get bought out.
8612.38s: If you're doing manually, you need to do like cleanup stuff.
8614.14s: So even the number of companies has always changed.
8615.58s: So this is the University of Stocks. The University of Stocks is based on this database of stocks at the DB.
8618.70s: You should see more than 3423. You see 3443.
8620.94s: This is like, I made some modifications recently to streamline the process a little bit.
8624.14s: So yeah, I have to find the spot because I don't want to waste your guys' time and kind of have to go
8628.86s: through the entire video. But he talks about his pivot in terms of his investing style,
8635.74s: which I do find to be really, really interesting personally.
8640.14s: But yeah, I mean, the whole backdrop here is beyond fascinating to me.
8647.98s: And the pivot into Chewy to me more than anything seems like a salute to Cohen,
8654.86s: because not only did he get into Chewy, but he also got in at 9 million 1,000 shares.
8661.42s: So with that, I think that that's like really, really specific gestures.
8668.38s: Just like when he got into GameStop and he did 9 million 1,000 shares, right?
8672.22s: It's a very purposeful number. He's not just kind of picking a number.
8678.54s: In all of those positions, his account can handle more. So he's stopping at those
8684.30s: at very specific, for very specific reasons.
8688.94s: Willie says, don't forget, GME and Chewy or an XRT might not be relevant though. Yeah,
8693.66s: I mean, it's a fair call out. I don't necessarily think that that matters a whole bunch.
8698.38s: But yeah, I agree with you. I think it's important to know.
8705.10s: Alfonso says, a Roth that has a 37-year-old, he can grow for another 22 years before,
8713.34s: he can buy his spaceship. Yeah, that's hilarious.
8720.30s: Yeah, the whole thing, man, is just, it's a giant riddle to me. It's so cool.
8728.70s: Gravitara said, did we ever reverse engineer the interest payment,
8731.90s: DFC, DIVV received? Yeah, I think we did at some point. I don't remember.
8736.86s: Yeah, I don't remember.
8750.06s: Yeah. I'm trying to recollect, but I can't remember what we arrived at.
8755.58s: It's obviously not enough for him to maintain both positions that I know definitively.
8762.70s: At least just from the, I got to take the hat off, man. It's so hot in there. It's like,
8768.38s: in case you guys didn't know, tinfoil hats don't breathe.
8778.70s: I'm pretty sure my Kevlar helmet breathes more than that.
8786.30s: But yeah, it wasn't enough because I know one of the other things that Newton was postulating is
8792.30s: maybe he traded enough options, essentially, to double his portfolio in the time frame from
8798.86s: here to when he filed for Chewie. And I just, I just don't see, I just don't see that.
8805.34s: I don't see that at all. Apospeite says, then take your shirt off. That's funny because if you don't
8810.94s: know for a lot of my OG live streams, they were shirtless, especially if it's like during the
8815.10s: summer earlier in the day when it's kind of hot, we're lazy now. We just run the AC whenever we're
8821.58s: even remotely uncomfortable. We're very, very, we're too comfortable now. But yeah, I used to do
8828.22s: a lot of live streams without the shirt on because absolutely when it's too hot, we pop the tarps,
8834.46s: man, much easier that way. Ricky says Eric just lost 50% of his power when he took off the tin. Yeah,
8841.10s: I think that's about right. I think I lose that. And then I mean, God forbid, I lost the beard at the
8846.94s: same time. I could just imagine this, this herniated disc would probably have me curl up in a
8851.82s: fetal position, whereas like right now I can still fight it a little bit, but I would completely
8857.34s: be screwed without it for sure. Anything else that we want to take a quick look at before I hop
8867.58s: off and go stuff my fat face with some barbecue really, really fun session. I mean, there was like
8875.26s: a hundred people in here, which is incredible. I love an opportunity to connect with you guys and
8880.14s: take a look at the stock, learn more about it myself, hopefully share a little bit about it. If
8888.06s: if I can, the problem is right now with something like GameStop, it's just so range bound. Maybe
8896.06s: that's what we can take a look at for the last couple minutes here. It's just where we're at now.
8899.98s: I think that makes sense. So when I look at GameStop where it sits, I mean,
8909.18s: it's it's been very, very healthily consolidating, which I love. That's really good to see.
8918.62s: And the other thing I really like to see here is when if we take a look at this time frame,
8925.98s: essentially from the fifth of aug, and we take a look at what something like IWM did.
8932.06s: In some of these days, specifically like the seventh, if we take a look at the seventh here,
8937.82s: GameStop had a down day, but minimally so compared to the broader Russell, which is great.
8945.42s: That shows me that it's a little bit more resistant to the broad index, which is great. Now,
8951.10s: what I don't love is that the Russell, essentially from the 15th all the way through the 23rd,
8958.38s: has been rallying pretty consistently. And I don't love that essentially GameStop is going the
8965.98s: opposite direction, not by much, but it's curling down in that same reference time frame.
8973.42s: So I don't I don't love that just from the context of like the broader index supporting the
8980.06s: movement. I just I really wanted to see GameStop participates just a little bit more because when
8986.86s: the broader index is down, it doesn't surprise me not to see much activity in GameStop or other sub
8992.86s: components. Like that's very normal. That's okay. But when the broader index starts to show
8998.14s: signs of life, I would want to see some of that make its way into GameStop, which we just unfortunately
9008.94s: didn't fully see materialize here. So I think leading into earnings, it looks pretty quiet.
9020.30s: Don Nott says, what would happen to Siri options when the tickers merge? Yeah. So to dovetail off
9026.86s: of that super fast, essentially, they'll be adjusted. They won't offer new ones. And then they will
9033.50s: make any depending on how they choose to consolidate them. They'll adjust the options as needed. So
9045.50s: but yeah, anyways, back to this generally sideways, not a ton to look at. Volume has been relatively
9055.26s: anemic. And when I look at the options, it's super, super quiet. Just on a relative basis,
9067.90s: this is about as quiet as it gets in here. So that matters to me just because when I'm looking for
9075.18s: overall activity in a product, I typically scan both the options chain and then the stock itself.
9082.06s: And when I'm looking at this, I'm just not seeing a ton for me to like really latch onto.
9088.78s: So it just seems quiet. That's the way I'm perceiving it. And when I perceive something as quiet,
9094.30s: it means that I look at it, but I don't have a bunch of positions on in here right now,
9099.26s: which leaves me at risk. If there's a giant gap, I wouldn't participate. But as a trader,
9105.02s: and I always emphasize the point as a trader, because the reason why I think it's important for
9109.90s: you guys to hear that is because it gives you some context into the way that I'm thinking about
9115.10s: this and the way that I'm playing it and why I'm playing it like that. And that's the main
9120.14s: thing is like as a trader, I need to position myself where things are moving. And right now, it looks
9126.30s: really quiet. So I'm generally expecting it to remain quiet into earnings unless there's new
9132.70s: news that breaks in some capacity. But there's just not a ton of it just yet. So I'm continuing to
9140.78s: cover it as I do my daily update videos with you all because I kind of said I would. And that's
9146.86s: the primary reason because again, a lot of the update videos I'm doing my best to identify
9151.66s: little things here and there. Right now, the biggest thing that I find so interesting is that
9158.78s: the earnings volume for the earnings volatility for that expiration cycle is so low.
9165.02s: That's fascinating because I have no idea why it would be this low compared to the next
9170.94s: expiration cycle because the next expiration cycle is also a weekly expiration. So this I still
9178.86s: postulate will expand. I actually traded the original expansion and I got out of it pretty fast
9184.14s: because it stopped expanding and I thought it was going to expand more and then it chilled out.
9189.74s: So I mean, I was really surprised by that. And then I was equally more surprised by the contraction
9197.34s: in volatility here. But I'm keeping an eye on it because my broader expectation based on just
9203.18s: how these things typically move, I would anticipate this expanding, the 75% volatility for earnings
9210.14s: to expand. But not quite, not quite seeing it yet. And the other thing really quick is when I looked
9218.86s: at the volume, it looked like for the call side, most of the volume appeared to be closing front
9225.58s: positions and then moving into just the following week, which is very standard fair for GameStop
9233.18s: maintaining that front expiration cycle exposure. So if we take a look at the 30-odg, there's 70,000
9239.90s: options there or call specific, I should say, there's only 30 for earnings, which is crazy.
9246.78s: Then there's only 12 and 13-step and then 63. So you can see as per usual, we stay way, way,
9255.26s: more centralized for GameStop specifically in the front expiration. But right now, it's just pretty
9261.42s: pretty light. Alfonso says at some point, please leave GMME in the past. If it remains stagnant,
9268.14s: pretty please. So many more worthy tickers, definitely. And that's why the other thing that you'll
9274.38s: notice on the daily updates I do, I don't, while it's quiet in GameStop, I don't just look at GameStop.
9280.38s: I make sure I am looking at other stuff for you guys for that exact reason. So I completely,
9286.06s: completely agree with you. But in the near term here, I'll continue to cover GameStop on the daily
9293.42s: basis because there's no reason really not to because I'm still fascinated by it and the story
9298.06s: and whatnot. I mean, I'll be honest, if we go like six months and the behavior is as it is,
9304.78s: as it is, I probably would decrease the daily update for GameStop and still probably do it
9310.78s: like weekly or something. I don't know, I don't plan this shit out. I just kind of do it as it goes.
9315.58s: But that's exactly why in this case, I try to do both. Right. So when I'm doing my daily update,
9323.18s: videos, I'll find whatever else looks interesting. I'm trying to keep it to two items because what I
9328.70s: was doing for a little bit is like a broad market update. And I don't think a lot of people really
9333.74s: cared about that. And that's okay. So I'm trying to pick like two more specific things to focus on.
9339.82s: And then when I'm doing the live streams, you know, whether it's the on the YouTube channel
9345.02s: largely or if it's for the Patreon folks, I'm doing more of like a broad market analysis overview
9351.74s: and stuff like that. Robo says, what time flames do you typically trade anything from like zero DTE
9358.94s: days to expiration out to, I don't know, long term holding for me might be like a month.
9366.70s: Maybe two months, like those are fairly long term. And then the majority of my trades are probably
9374.78s: two weeks that I hold something like that. Roy said, this is exactly what market makers want.
9381.02s: Investors to grow board of GME. That's why we see this dip down now rounding pattern exact.
9387.18s: I wouldn't attribute that to the market makers just to be clear. The market makers want you to trade.
9392.38s: That's how they make their money. I just think it's important to not turn the market makers into
9397.66s: some sort of like boogie man that's trying to screw everybody because the way that market makers
9403.74s: make their money is by making markets, which requires people. That's not to say that they can't be
9410.62s: shady or do shady things or play games. But in the process of market making, they need to, yeah,
9420.94s: they need people.
9426.06s: Beto says, personally, I wouldn't trust a recap from someone who got bored on GME and dipped.
9430.94s: Fair weather analysis is typically untrustworthy. Yeah, I mean, that's totally fair.
9435.50s: For me, it's, again, I try to be completely straightforward with you guys on what my incentives
9442.30s: are and what I do. I'm a trader. So because I'm a trader, I need things to move around. It's how
9450.70s: I make money. It's literally my livelihood. So yeah, I don't think that there's any issue with
9458.46s: your opinion, Beto. But yeah, for me, I've been trading this is my 17th year of trading and it's
9466.46s: not just been game stop. It will never just be game stop for me. Game stop is part of my book
9472.06s: and what I like to do. And again, I've already told you I'm infatuated with the story. But
9477.98s: I got a trade man. It's what I do. So that means I have to look for things that are moving.
9483.82s: And I've spent my entire trading career looking at lots of stuff. So yeah, this show.
9492.46s: Beto says always trust original sources and D.D. authors themselves. I think that's smart. Yeah,
9499.98s: especially with understanding the hypothesis.
9506.38s: I think with the due diligence itself, there's something to be said about somebody like Newton.
9514.14s: Who spends a lot of time like collating different sources and understanding them.
9518.70s: I think that's really important for somebody to collate ideas. But yeah, I think that it's
9525.10s: much more efficacious to like look at the actual source itself. I think that that's a completely
9531.02s: fair idea. Robo said, could GME have sold all 125 million shares to the market makers?
9537.58s: Now market makers are dispersing it over keeping price stagnant to mitigate flooding the market.
9544.06s: I don't see that's one of the great questions that we didn't really get a chance to talk about
9548.62s: today. Maybe I'll add that to the agenda for the next one, which is like, it's a great,
9553.50s: like where the fuck are the shares? Because I don't know. And I don't really know where,
9560.86s: yeah, like I don't know. And it's definitely a pretty big question I have. Because like,
9565.90s: I would have expected to see like more clear filings from people flowing in. But yeah,
9572.14s: I'm taking a note now. And we can take a closer look at it because, yeah, I'm very curious
9583.10s: where the shares are. Now, what I can tell you is that the short float's gone down massively.
9587.58s: So I'm sure a ton of shorts use that to cover. But yeah, I am unsure where they went.
9597.34s: Okay.
9599.34s: Hooked-on-option says, do you do live streams during the trading day? Not usually.
9602.78s: I would be down to in the future. But right now, I typically,
9607.50s: well, I just keep a regular cadence. So I do live streams at 5 p.m. Pacific time every day.
9613.50s: And I just do 5 p.m. because I think for a lot of people that work, you know, for a living,
9618.06s: it's easier for them to catch up with the live streams when they're not working. But
9622.46s: But in the future, I might start doing like multiple live streams a day.
9626.62s: I really love live streams.
9627.82s: I like interacting with you live.
9630.06s: It's way more engaging for me as you could tell from my videos.
9632.70s: Like I don't like making videos.
9634.94s: I like sharing information and I like sharing as much of my skill set and experience as I
9639.54s: possibly can.
9641.34s: But I don't like making, you know, super beautiful, well crafted videos.
9645.74s: It's just not my skill set.
9646.74s: It's not my passion.
9648.10s: I'm way more function over form in that sense.
9654.46s: And I care a lot about the skill set and the practical application of trading because I
9660.22s: got introduced to this through a mentor and then I found another mentor and I just had
9665.38s: I've had a lot of people help me directly or indirectly throughout the path.
9669.66s: And I think that it's massively important to try to share your skill set, whatever it
9675.38s: is with other people.
9677.42s: So yeah, that's why it's structured the way it is now, but always open to another approach.
9683.62s: Willie says personally, towards short interest being covered from a mathematical perspective,
9688.10s: the price did not spike to the degree of the massive short position.
9692.10s: Trading was even halted.
9693.10s: Yeah, because I do agree.
9694.10s: I think we can objectively see that short interest contracted pretty massively following
9699.46s: the offering.
9700.46s: So I think that that makes sense.
9702.90s: So this space says, Willie, then why all the effort and money spent bashing GME?
9708.14s: Because I'll not to answer for Willie, but my guess is that there are still shorts that
9712.46s: are stuck in there.
9713.90s: I still don't think everybody closed out from the original squeeze.
9718.62s: And I think that a lot of them were turned into convertibles or swaps that are very difficult
9724.10s: to track because they can continue to be modified and perpetuated.
9729.18s: I think that there's also probably a significant cohort of people that are hoping that GME
9736.38s: goes bankrupt so that they can take their shorts down and not pay any taxes on it.
9741.26s: Like there are probably people hanging out like vultures hoping that this thing fails,
9745.86s: which is the ugliest thing.
9747.02s: I hate that.
9748.98s: The prospect of banking and on other people's failure just sucks.
9754.54s: I think that that is un-American at best, but I think that it's just a terrible mindset
9760.26s: to have.
9761.26s: It's what a shitty place to be in your life if that's what you're hoping for as other
9764.98s: people to fail.
9765.98s: That just sucks.
9767.82s: But I think ape of spades, that would be my guess why there's a lot of people spending
9774.86s: money to try to continue to suppress it.
9777.90s: So.
9779.90s: All right, gang.
9781.66s: Time for me to go stuff my fat face.
9784.46s: Absolutely awesome time catching up.
9786.46s: We'll do another one of these probably next Saturday.
9788.50s: Just kind of keep the cadence going for the GME specific one.
9791.66s: And yeah, as always, if you guys need anything, just hit me up.
9794.38s: I will see you all around on the other live streams or in the discord, be an outlier.
9798.26s: I'll see you guys later.
