0.00s:  What is up, ape nation and the outliers, ape outliers,
6.00s:  kind of the combination thereof.
8.52s:  Hopefully we have a little bit of a healthy mix
10.92s:  in the house today.
11.92s:  I'm gonna grab the chat, move it over here
13.56s:  so I can say hello and keep up with you all.
18.20s:  So the agenda for today is a few things.
23.04s:  The first thing I wanna do is kind of work through
28.04s:  some homework that I'm trying to piece together,
32.52s:  specifically looking at the behavior of GameStop
37.24s:  before previous significant moves.
41.40s:  So essentially what I'm literally doing right now
43.92s:  as I'm talking to you is I'm going into bar charts,
47.64s:  I have an account with them to gain access
50.84s:  to some daily stock data.
53.20s:  Well, you don't even need it.
54.04s:  You can get it from Yahoo Finance whoever you want.
55.56s:  Just tell me where I'm getting the data from.
57.60s:  And I'm gonna download daily GME data
62.20s:  from 2000 to present.
64.56s:  So today the 24th of August,
67.88s:  and I'm downloading it right now.
69.72s:  And I'm essentially gonna start a process
73.48s:  in the background while I'm doing this.
75.60s:  And I'm gonna run it through a bit of a process
78.40s:  that's gonna help me identify all of the periods
82.88s:  where GameStop had a price appreciation
86.52s:  of at least 100%.
88.28s:  That's my initial thought.
89.76s:  And literally I'm doing it now as we speak.
92.48s:  So if there's other permutations that you're interested in,
95.32s:  let me know.
96.40s:  We can take a look at others at the same time.
99.16s:  But what I'm doing now is you've probably heard me talk
101.92s:  about this idea of like finger printing.
104.28s:  And I don't know, it's just kind of the term
107.72s:  that comes to my mind, it's not actually anything
109.44s:  that's like widely accepted to me and anything.
111.52s:  But for me, finger printing is just part of creating
115.96s:  an identity for something that's unique to that thing.
119.32s:  That's kind of the whole idea of a fingerprint
120.92s:  is that it's unique to you.
122.40s:  So what I'm working on right now is taking a look
126.52s:  at some of GME's fingerprint around some of the larger moves.
131.52s:  Because the last couple of sessions I've been spending time
134.48s:  and hopefully we can spend time on this one as well,
137.24s:  but learning about the background,
138.64s:  learning about the players, learning about Rory and Kitty,
141.12s:  learning about the way he posts,
142.84s:  learning about the positions based on what he posts, right?
147.76s:  To give me a bunch of just different contextual understanding
151.36s:  of how this whole thing works.
153.32s:  So now that I have at least a rudimentary,
156.88s:  and I highlight that, it's rudimentary,
158.92s:  I still do not consider myself somebody
161.52s:  that really knows much about this story,
164.76s:  which is why I'm still spending so much time learning about it.
169.84s:  So while I have a bit of an understanding of the background,
174.48s:  what I'm trying to do is get a better sense now
176.72s:  of the actual movements we experience
179.60s:  and what it looks like when those movements are happening.
183.40s:  Because so far, there's been one universal component
188.88s:  to everything I've seen so far with GameStop
191.16s:  when it comes to a move.
192.48s:  Every single time I've seen it make a move,
195.44s:  is I see volume expand meaningfully before the move happens.
202.72s:  So in this case, there's kind of like a pre-move,
205.68s:  I guess I should say, because there's still a massive move.
208.76s:  So if we look here on the second of May,
211.32s:  the range that we had high to low was 1288 to 1096.
215.80s:  So it's like a two-point range.
217.36s:  That doesn't sound crazy,
218.76s:  but if you look at that as a percentage
220.92s:  of the value of the product, that's not insignificant.
224.40s:  More importantly than that,
225.68s:  if we take a look at the average daily ranges
228.44s:  preceding that, it's much lower.
230.56s:  What I find more important is if I look at the volume
234.76s:  on the day before the big move,
237.60s:  in this case kind of this first leg up,
239.96s:  I'll refer to it as on the first of May,
242.88s:  the volume was 2.6 million shares traded.
247.28s:  And for broader context,
249.24s:  the five-day average trading volume before this
253.72s:  was 4.3 million shares.
256.64s:  So that's about what it's looking like on average.
259.84s:  The 20-day average at that point was 3.7 million shares.
262.64s:  So you can see that in a nutshell,
265.56s:  the average volume was somewhere
267.60s:  about four million shares, call it.
269.40s:  Then on the second, the volume literally doubles.
273.24s:  It doubles off of the five-day average,
276.12s:  and it takes us from four million change up to 8.6 million.
280.84s:  Then the day after that,
282.52s:  it goes to 36 million shares traded.
288.04s:  So again, quick recap over the past three days
291.96s:  in this scenario.
293.36s:  On the first of May, we go from 2.6 million to 8.6 million
298.64s:  to 36 million.
300.36s:  That behavior is interesting to me.
303.56s:  And the reason why that behavior's interesting to me
305.68s:  is because one of the biggest things I'm interested in
308.80s:  with GameStop beyond the story, beyond the background,
311.84s:  is trading it.
312.72s:  And the movements, it has.
315.48s:  And while I think the last time I was doing a live stream
319.24s:  about this, somebody was just like, yeah, okay, genius.
321.56s:  You're looking at a historic move.
324.04s:  Of course, you can see the volume expanding.
325.88s:  But the broader point that I'm trying to highlight
328.96s:  for you in the conversation is that this behavior
332.56s:  of expanding volume is the signal.
336.20s:  It is what I look for to precipitate the move.
341.08s:  So anyways, I'm going to run this data through from 2000 to 2024.
345.52s:  And I want to see find the occurrences.
352.92s:  And I'm just doing this through the data analyst and GPT.
355.72s:  So it can run the data that I have really easy.
359.12s:  Find the occurrences where either, let's do a day over day volume.
366.48s:  Where day over day volume expands by at least 100%.
376.32s:  Also, I'm going to do find the dates.
380.28s:  Because that's what really what we want.
382.76s:  Find and list.
386.64s:  Also do the same for where intraday price movement exceeds.
395.96s:  100%.
399.16s:  Let's do 50% there.
400.56s:  Something a little bit lighter.
403.64s:  So that will start running for us.
406.16s:  And while that's getting underway, I'd love to say hello to everybody.
408.92s:  So we got Reese Tanner, our friend, H Steely.
413.32s:  Oh, shit, that's a hard one.
418.36s:  You guys have to coach me on this one.
420.92s:  RBLD.
422.40s:  So I see dark side DRK side.
425.56s:  I don't know how to read RBL.
429.32s:  Not like Roblox.
430.64s:  What the fuck do you get through RBL?
432.28s:  I get the dark side.
433.24s:  I get the dark side AI.
434.88s:  Rebel.
435.88s:  Oh, Jonathan, you might be on it.
438.52s:  Jonathan, that's soup that that literally might be it.
441.24s:  Is that it?
443.44s:  Come on, Rebel dark side AI.
444.84s:  Don't leave us hanging.
447.16s:  Right now the riddle I'm trying to solve is deciphering your name.
450.00s:  See this day, you could tell it's a GME livestream.
451.84s:  I'm immediately just reading into everything
454.32s:  and trying to solve whatever puzzle,
456.40s:  random ass puzzle apparently is presented to me,
459.20s:  which right now is this dude's name.
461.88s:  It's the big puzzle of the moment for me.
466.32s:  Rebel dark side.
467.32s:  Nice job.
468.20s:  Jonathan, good job.
469.56s:  So I was able to do the easy part and identify dark side.
472.96s:  And so I don't think I get really any credit for that.
474.88s:  That's kind of easy.
475.92s:  But Jonathan crushed it on the rebel part that's spot on.
480.16s:  Good work out of you.
481.76s:  All right, cool.
482.96s:  So Rebel dark side says I'm not going to lie.
486.28s:  It's so manipulated GME, but why though is it that institutions
491.36s:  never got out of their shorts?
493.16s:  That's a fantastic question.
495.00s:  And the manipulation in GME is it's another reason why I'm so fascinated
502.28s:  in the product to be completely straightforward with you.
506.92s:  I trade for it's my it's how I make a living is through trading.
511.40s:  So the main part of what I'm doing with trading is trying to find ways to make money,
517.72s:  right? Like just like anybody else.
519.92s:  However, with something like GameStop,
524.36s:  it really highlights a whole other undertone of what's going on in markets.
531.36s:  And I don't want to say I view it as a canary in the coal mine
534.44s:  because there's other canaries with it, but it is kind of like that,
538.08s:  where this is a purely clean example that again,
542.32s:  like you guys know me hopefully well enough by now,
544.76s:  where I'm not into being super hyperbolic and I'm not into making decisions
550.96s:  or assumptions off of really broken partial data.
553.92s:  I'll explore it always, but I'm not going to look at something that essentially 90%
560.44s:  looks like it might be the case and then conclude it is the case
563.76s:  unless I can actually prove it with some sort of evidence,
566.88s:  qualitative quantitative, I don't care,
568.88s:  but something other than just conjecture in my opinion,
573.00s:  in GameStop is fascinating because it is one of those things that I can look at
579.20s:  and I can discreetly identify this exact behavior that there is something wrong
587.72s:  that happens with the product.
588.88s:  Like I can see it and I can quantify it.
592.32s:  So I am really blown away with kind of how blatant the bullshit is with GameStop.
601.12s:  That's one of the, that's one of the craziest things to me.
604.00s:  It's like hiding in plain sight, the fact that there's been movies about it,
608.92s:  there's been shit on Netflix about it and it still seems to be,
613.52s:  I don't know how severe it's happening now because it's hard for me to quantify.
618.88s:  But some shit's going on that I can clearly identify and that part's super frustrating.
624.72s:  So going back to the question on why the institutions never got out of their shorts,
629.84s:  I don't know how many did or didn't.
631.56s:  Let's take a quick look because actually if I were to guess,
634.88s:  I believe a good number probably did, especially with the, at the money.
640.88s:  That's my guess.
642.60s:  And then it looks like we have holy shit.
648.88s:  So right now I'm essentially looking at the data that I was telling you all about.
654.32s:  And it's blowing my mind right now if I'm being honest with you.
660.16s:  Okay, quiz question for volume expanding by at least 100%.
670.04s:  Over the past essentially 24 years looking at GameStop from 2000 to today.
677.60s:  How many occurrences do you think volume day over day expanded by at least 100%?
689.48s:  Because it's a little more than I expected.
695.36s:  42, it's a great guess.
697.64s:  It's not even close though.
699.00s:  I honestly would have been closer to your guess.
701.48s:  I was a little higher.
702.36s:  I was thinking, I was thinking maybe, yeah,
706.68s:  I don't want to give you my answer.
709.64s:  Jonathan says between 69 and 420, which are fantastic numbers.
713.20s:  But unfortunately we have to play by prices right rules.
715.96s:  Also, cheers.
716.88s:  I'm starting out with some liquid IV keeping the old hydration up while I'm working through this bullshit herniated disc.
725.76s:  Also in case you guys didn't know because I have that bullshit going on,
729.12s:  I am spending even more time just hanging out at home looking at stuff.
734.08s:  It's like, what else am I going to do going to the gym and then doing that?
737.92s:  Which is nuts.
743.44s:  113 145 741 350.
748.40s:  Okay.
749.36s:  So based on prices right rules, Ben price you win plus one fake internet point.
756.24s:  Euphoria web tried to game the system.
758.20s:  When you're playing prices right, you don't get to give a range.
760.80s:  It's it's utter bullshit.
762.00s:  It's not how that works.
763.44s:  So euphoria web, unfortunately your submission is immediately discounted because you try to give a range.
768.88s:  You can't give a range.
769.68s:  It's got to be single number.
771.56s:  And Ben price is the winner of plus one fake internet point.
776.16s:  That's what you get.
777.40s:  So we'll let it all be known for everybody plus one fake internet point.
785.32s:  There you go.
786.96s:  Right there.
788.40s:  Tree Fitty.
790.40s:  So the actual number is 392.
794.72s:  Closes without going over prices right rules.
797.28s:  So the actual number is 392 times from 2000 to 2024 today.
807.84s:  And the first time it happened was actually in 2002 on the 5th of March.
812.72s:  Hey, day after my birthday.
814.44s:  What a great celebration.
816.72s:  That's fascinating.
819.72s:  Okay, now this number makes way more sense to me.
824.84s:  So the next question I'm solving for because what I'm going to do is I want to go look at
829.80s:  the chart on these days and see what we can see.
833.20s:  Because the other thing I asked it to do for me is find me the periods where the intraday
838.44s:  movement so high to low within a single day exceeded 50% from the same time frame.
845.52s:  And it did that 21 times which obviously compared to the volume question that might
851.60s:  seem like really insignificant.
853.12s:  But price moving by 50% intraday is much harder than volume simply expanding like significantly.
860.48s:  So a lot of other things have to happen in order for that kind of price pattern.
865.08s:  So that's a really, really impressive.
867.68s:  And it looks like the highest I see is 330% price increase, which was on 28 Jan, 20,
875.48s:  21.
876.48s:  That's the largest number I see here.
879.36s:  And then there's a couple hundred.
880.40s:  It's not many like maybe three total.
883.76s:  So we'll take a look at those individual days because I want to go on demand and I literally
888.72s:  want to go back in time and see if we can take a look at the options markets before those.
893.64s:  Again, this is the way that I start gaining more context on what I'm looking at in the way
899.04s:  it behaves because again, I continue to read this point because I think it's important.
904.08s:  There's two parts of my brain that are working right now.
907.56s:  There's the part of my brain that is interested in the story, market impact, broader things.
913.92s:  There's another part of my brain that is interested in what I can trade and how can I identify
920.20s:  a usable signal that I can rely on.
923.16s:  Again, right now it's volume.
924.64s:  That's the best predictor I've found so far.
927.04s:  And the reason why I bring it up is because when I'm going through all these different
930.40s:  theories, I was messaging Newton not too long ago asking just some of the latest research
936.04s:  and stuff.
937.24s:  And it's like there are tons of really interesting ideas.
942.76s:  The problem is I haven't found a good configuration of ideas that is led to an efficacious, objectively
952.88s:  efficacious signal that I can trade.
955.52s:  TDS have not done that.
957.44s:  Volume changes seem to be the closest so far.
960.76s:  Swap data has not done it.
962.92s:  So it tells me like as per usual, we're dealing with such a busy multi-variant system.
970.76s:  Like that's really what I see when I look at this.
973.44s:  And in the meantime, you have to give me a break.
975.16s:  I have to get a couple of these ad-vill twos down so that I can keep my composure.
984.36s:  There they go.
990.36s:  I don't know how long you can take ad-vill and ib-profen.
993.48s:  I normally don't take it, but right now your boy needs it.
997.92s:  All right, so let's take a look really quick though at the short interest.
1000.76s:  So short interest in GME.
1003.96s:  And let's see what this says.
1007.40s:  So this is going to Finto.
1013.24s:  Rebel Darkside says also I'm not in AMC, but like how they run together.
1019.72s:  The AMC is bullish on 200-day average all across and nothing.
1023.28s:  I like this stuff.
1024.28s:  It's cool.
1025.28s:  Yeah.
1026.28s:  Well, the interesting part is I know that people have like different feelings about like
1029.48s:  meme stocks and what that means.
1031.52s:  And then the insinuations, we actually had a little bit of a conversation about that in
1036.40s:  the discord, which again is free for anybody to join that's interested.
1040.08s:  But the pure definition that I've always associated and I looked it up at a curiosity is just
1046.48s:  like what is a meme stock?
1048.92s:  And a lot of people, I think it has like this really terrible connotation, but realistically
1055.44s:  from what I've always understand is that it's essentially like this right here.
1062.48s:  It's a stock that gains popularity through social media.
1065.92s:  Like that's the way I look at it.
1068.04s:  And I think that there's a reality behind what we see meme stocks do.
1075.60s:  Whether you want to classify a game stock as a meme stock or not, that's okay.
1078.60s:  Again, I don't want to bother anybody with the terminology or whatever.
1082.44s:  It's like there's just words to me.
1084.60s:  But the main thing is there's a correlation between them.
1088.60s:  Because as there's fervor in one thing, typically people expect sympathy movement in other
1095.16s:  things.
1096.16s:  And this is not unique to meme stocks.
1098.16s:  This is common for any sort of correlated products.
1102.56s:  Now the correlation between something like GameStop and AMC we can look at, but it's all
1107.24s:  over the map.
1108.24s:  I've looked it up before.
1109.24s:  It's not that crazy.
1111.08s:  So anyways, back to GameStop, this is really low, like really, really low.
1117.32s:  So it shows short interest flow is 9.7% and then off exchange short volume is 27%, which
1124.04s:  is just really, it's just really low.
1127.44s:  Now one of the things that's really funny about this is that's actually a really long time
1133.64s:  to cover still.
1136.56s:  Eleven days to cover a short is a long ass time.
1141.20s:  So this and this don't seem to align in my opinion.
1148.60s:  That seems quirky.
1152.68s:  Because that's an eternity to cover.
1156.52s:  Yeah, I'm going to try to check another source really quick.
1159.88s:  GME short interest.
1166.00s:  Let's see what market beat says.
1171.12s:  Alfonso says nobody really mentioned meme stocks until the stimulus check started flooding
1175.16s:  the bank account of youngsters in 2020.
1177.16s:  I think it's a big part of it.
1178.16s:  Yeah, when there was like a giant, giant explosion in retail traders, like I totally agree.
1185.92s:  I completely agree with you.
1190.04s:  And that's kind of the ideas that meme stocks are kind of part and parcel to retail and
1195.70s:  social media.
1196.70s:  It's not something that's just like institutionally well known or whatever.
1202.54s:  Let's take a look at this.
1203.54s:  I haven't looked yet.
1205.22s:  Yeah, that looks way more logical.
1210.50s:  So zero point eight days to cover and this is showing 10.8%.
1214.90s:  This is showing 9.77.
1216.54s:  So it's pretty close.
1218.14s:  Yeah, this makes way more sense to me.
1223.50s:  This to me looks like an error because 11 days to cover like that is that is like just
1232.22s:  an unbelievable eternity if that were the case.
1238.66s:  And then let's take a look at this.
1240.78s:  The chart exchange and it shows short interest that contracted very meaningfully, which again,
1246.74s:  we would expect to see.
1248.50s:  So as that at the money came through, it looks like there is a pretty meaningful bleed
1257.22s:  through on this because short interest just absolutely cratered.
1263.50s:  Now the other part that I can't help but find interesting is how low this says short interest
1268.66s:  wasn't here because I'm not so sure.
1272.50s:  But this might be at a period of time where short interest might have been kind of wound
1280.14s:  into other products already.
1282.46s:  So it might be that's why that might be why that's a little bit skewed in my opinion
1287.58s:  because I don't know that short interest was actually at like 0% that this would suggest.
1297.26s:  That seems it seems weird.
1301.06s:  Before he says how does short interest go down and the price also goes down a bunch of
1305.78s:  different ways.
1306.78s:  But in this case, I'm assuming I don't remember the exact date when the at the money started.
1310.66s:  When did it start?
1312.66s:  GME ATM offering start date.
1321.42s:  Begin May 17th.
1324.78s:  So it's literally right in here.
1326.62s:  So that would be my guess is that it came from the share offering because it started May
1334.26s:  17th and I think it only went for a few days.
1336.74s:  It didn't take that or no, it went longer than that.
1339.18s:  This says it concluded on the 11th.
1342.78s:  That was a little longer than I thought, but okay, I obviously I'm sure that's right.
1349.82s:  I don't think I remember fully well.
1353.46s:  Before he says was that enough for them to bring it down that much?
1355.70s:  I think so.
1356.70s:  I mean, they offered a ton of shares, man.
1358.94s:  They offered up to 45 million shares.
1362.54s:  So yeah, I mean, it's definitely like that.
1367.94s:  That's a massive offering at that point.
1370.74s:  Nick says do you think GME's dilution was bad without giving any forward guidance?
1374.82s:  I don't think so.
1375.82s:  I don't think so at all.
1377.78s:  I think the problem is is that it seems like GME shareholders have like a certain expectation
1384.98s:  of what kind of guidance they'll get and what time frame and what information will be
1390.02s:  included.
1391.50s:  But I don't actually believe that the share offering was bad for the company.
1397.06s:  I mean, they raised what?
1398.30s:  Like over $2 billion something like that, right?
1400.90s:  Again, you guys probably know those metrics a little bit better than me off the top of
1405.02s:  your head.
1406.18s:  I literally think that they raised like over $2 billion or I'm sorry, $2 billion in gross
1410.86s:  proceeds from it.
1412.54s:  So I think like there are two different things in your question, their Nick kind of two
1419.18s:  different components, right?
1420.42s:  There's the was it bad and then was it bad in the context of guidance because they're
1427.18s:  two different things.
1428.82s:  I think the way that GME is offering guidance has been weird.
1435.34s:  But I also think that it's not surprising the way that it's offering guidance.
1440.14s:  Now I think that at the money net net put the company in a much better position to operate
1446.90s:  as a company.
1447.90s:  Like and that's just objectively the case because my other assumption is one of the primary
1453.30s:  reasons I think that offering went through the time it did is not just because the stock
1459.90s:  was super high.
1461.06s:  That is part of it.
1462.86s:  I think the other reason why the offering went through at that point is because my guess
1466.82s:  is they knew interest rates weren't so there weren't going to stay at astronomical levels
1474.22s:  into perpetuity.
1476.06s:  So if you complete that at the money offering, you raise a fat stack of cash before interest
1482.90s:  rates start to crater, which they're going to look we have until September, right?
1486.82s:  They're going to start coming down, whether it's 25 basis points or 50, we don't know,
1490.38s:  but that's what it's looking like starting in September.
1493.26s:  So this at least gave them a few months to be able to take advantage of really short
1497.26s:  term high interest rates and even lock in longer term interest rates that still remain
1502.46s:  at least partially elevated.
1504.74s:  So I think there's a bit of a strategic choice there in two fashions.
1510.70s:  The first one doing it when it's high makes sense.
1514.10s:  Make a lot of money.
1515.66s:  The other thing is with that money, you're capturing it at a time frame that you can do
1520.38s:  something pretty meaningful with it.
1522.82s:  So I think the offering itself, I can see from a business perspective why they made the
1528.98s:  choice.
1530.14s:  Now in terms of the guidance component, that's a little bit different.
1535.14s:  And the reason being is because I don't really know what kind of guidance people are wanting
1542.90s:  to hear.
1543.90s:  I didn't listen all the way through the previous call, but in the previous call, I was capturing
1551.98s:  a lot of, I don't want to call it like under or overtones, but like broad themes is what
1558.58s:  I would qualify it as.
1559.74s:  Like I felt like during the last shareholders meeting, like GME leadership offered broad
1566.62s:  themes.
1567.62s:  So let me see.
1568.62s:  GME, shareholder meeting, 2024.
1572.34s:  This was just the voting stuff.
1585.94s:  No, no, no.
1592.90s:  No, that's not what I wanted.
1600.90s:  Four razor says he was the CEO of Chui with the fuck.
1610.90s:  Oh, sorry, I'm getting caught up on the tax, my bad guys are on the chat.
1618.90s:  Let me see where you guys are.
1620.58s:  Okay, so Nick says, I thought it was good to raise cash on hand to near four billion, but
1626.78s:  I'd really like to see some sort of guidance through what the plan is moving forward.
1630.70s:  Four billion is great, but what is next?
1632.18s:  Yeah, I think that that's a completely, I think that's a completely, completely fair.
1638.10s:  Yeah, I think it's a fair ask.
1641.58s:  And the other thing is I also don't see them just raising money for the sake of raising
1647.66s:  money.
1648.98s:  So I would also imagine that there's some sort of game plan baked into the decision cycle.
1655.22s:  And I don't, and I don't think anybody else really knows what it is right now.
1659.66s:  But I do think that there's, to me, probably something going on now as obscure as that is,
1669.38s:  I know it's quite obscure, but you don't raise billions in cash with just the aspiration
1678.42s:  of having billions in cash.
1680.94s:  It doesn't necessarily do the company a ton of favors.
1684.18s:  It doesn't hurt them having the money, but you want the money working for the business
1688.02s:  and driving revenue.
1690.46s:  So I agree with you from that perspective.
1696.10s:  But yeah, here we go, this one I was looking for.
1701.70s:  Chris says, see rates go down, markets go down.
1705.26s:  It's not, I don't think it's as simple as that.
1707.38s:  If you're talking about when the Fed cuts rates that the market's going to trail down,
1710.94s:  I've been seeing that getting thrown around a lot.
1712.86s:  I actually don't know why.
1720.06s:  Market goes down, they start to get out.
1724.06s:  Yeah, I still, I don't, I don't know where we're drawing that conclusion from that rates
1730.82s:  go down, market goes down.
1732.94s:  To your point, Rapture says Fed cuts rates during a recession, but cutting rates doesn't
1738.74s:  mean we're in a recession.
1740.58s:  Potentially, you're not yet to your point.
1742.62s:  We're not always in a recession when the Fed cuts rates.
1749.94s:  But yeah, I think going back to the idea of rates go down, market goes down, it's a mixed
1755.70s:  bag.
1756.70s:  It's not actually as linear as that.
1758.50s:  I've done a study on it.
1759.70s:  I actually wrote all about it in the newsletter that's coming out tomorrow and I analyzed
1764.26s:  all of the rate cuts from 2000 to present.
1768.38s:  The number of rate cuts, the severity of the rate cuts.
1773.10s:  I think there's multiple instances where rates were cut and the market ran up in three
1782.38s:  month, six month, nine month, and 12 month following time frames from the period of the
1788.66s:  cut.
1789.66s:  So I don't actually fully think that that's a fleshed out thought and then one second,
1794.74s:  we just got to open the door for the pump real fast.
1824.74s:  Fashion said, how do you hurt your back?
1826.22s:  Well, fortunately enough, my back actually doesn't hurt literally at all, but my sciatica
1831.14s:  is fucked right now from a herniated disc and I just got it when I was training and
1839.26s:  my guess is it's something that has been building over the years.
1842.70s:  Like I've been super physically active my whole life.
1845.70s:  So and I've been really fortunate in terms of injuries so far.
1849.78s:  So I think I just got blessed with this one at this point in time, but my guess is it's
1857.22s:  something that's been coming up for a while.
1859.90s:  Nick says hope you didn't get put in a twister.
1861.62s:  There's a zero percent chance you would catch me in a twister.
1865.10s:  Same thing with like a buggy choke.
1867.62s:  There's a zero percent chance.
1869.38s:  There's like a couple sort of submissions that there's just no world that I would tap
1874.50s:  to like a buggy choke.
1875.90s:  You would have to put me to sleep.
1877.66s:  And then when I wake up, you would have to prevent me from unalliving myself potentially
1883.22s:  because just a buggy choke is like the ultimate disrespect.
1886.78s:  And it's actually becoming kind of a dangerous submission.
1890.06s:  So yeah, that makes rolling is a bigger dude a little bit tricky, especially I like side
1895.82s:  control.
1896.82s:  Nick says gear, no, I do not wear the kimono.
1899.30s:  I've worn a key.
1900.30s:  I think three times of my entire life.
1902.70s:  I've been playing like jujitsu since college and I've been a mixed martial artist hobby.
1908.74s:  I say that in like very, very light terms.
1911.50s:  It's I'm a hobbyist.
1912.50s:  I'm not even any sort of, yeah, like pure dedicated dude.
1917.82s:  I just like training.
1919.90s:  So anything I've done in jujitsu is always in the context of like actual martial arts,
1925.62s:  not just jujitsu.
1927.94s:  So I think jujitsu can build a ton of bad habits, bro.
1932.34s:  Pulling guard in jujitsu can be a dangerous weapon.
1937.78s:  Anywhere else is going to get you soccer kicked in the freaking head.
1943.14s:  Like it's a terrible move everywhere else.
1946.34s:  Have literally everywhere else.
1948.78s:  It's a terrible choice.
1950.94s:  Only in jujitsu and I don't like that about stuff like that in like pure jujitsu practitioners.
1957.78s:  So I always have respect for it.
1959.78s:  But yeah, I think that that stuff silly.
1962.06s:  I also think bottom position being too well respected.
1966.10s:  Again, there's some really deadly dudes from bottom.
1969.50s:  They'd rather play bottom and that's okay.
1971.14s:  I get it.
1972.14s:  But in any sort of combative scenario, that is how you get smashed.
1977.58s:  So bottom is terrible and not being willing to wrestle up and move around as terrible.
1982.82s:  So yeah, bit of a rant and rave about jujitsu because I guess it's because I like to sport
1987.30s:  so much and I want to see it like grow.
1990.54s:  And I think that's one of the difficulties it's going to face.
1994.30s:  Let's see.
1998.98s:  MUNER says historically every time the Fed cuts, the market enters a bearish state.
2006.46s:  It's not rocket science.
2007.46s:  Look at a chart and compare it.
2009.62s:  It's just not true though.
2011.46s:  And again, like in the newsletter that that's coming out tomorrow talks about it, but it
2017.78s:  objectively is not true.
2019.50s:  So in 2019, the Fed cut three times.
2023.02s:  It took rates from two and a half to 1.76.
2026.14s:  The duration of the cuts was over six months after the initial cut.
2031.90s:  Markets for the three months following that cut were up 7.6%.
2035.66s:  And up 12% in the next six, then up 15.8% over the nine and then up 21% over the 12.
2044.02s:  So again, I understand the sentiment because if we look at 2001, if we look at 2007, 2008,
2054.18s:  there are absolutely instances where cuts led to downside market performance in conjunction
2060.26s:  with other things.
2061.94s:  I just think it's so important again to do our best and remain objective.
2067.70s:  And like that's one objective scenario.
2070.58s:  There's another one in essentially right around the the COVID market in 2020.
2078.14s:  Market collapses due to COVID.
2080.46s:  The market then the Fed starts cutting rates.
2083.46s:  There is two cuts over a month taking us from 1.75 down to 0.25, essentially zero.
2091.18s:  And that led to a massive rally in the market despite a pandemic.
2097.74s:  The unit says and when it went to zero, it could know that's not that's just not right,
2101.66s:  man.
2102.66s:  The time that cuts started during 2020 is after COVID started plummeting the market.
2110.34s:  It was in response to COVID.
2113.74s:  So it was not cut rates market crashed and then market went up, right?
2120.58s:  It's not, it's not happened in 2020.
2123.82s:  So yeah, that the whole point of the rate cuts in 2020 were in response to COVID, which pushed
2133.14s:  the market down as it should have because everybody was ready for it to be absolutely terrible.
2139.06s:  And if it didn't go through, right?
2143.14s:  Like if the Fed didn't intervene and what the Fed policy didn't go through, that could
2147.02s:  have been catastrophic to the market.
2150.02s:  So yeah.
2152.06s:  Chris says you think the market where it's at, the market will go up.
2159.26s:  It's a great question.
2161.02s:  And the punch line to it is I have no idea.
2166.54s:  I really don't know.
2168.30s:  And my job as a trader is not necessarily to know.
2172.22s:  My job as a trader is to follow the market with what it's doing.
2176.74s:  And that's generally how I view it.
2178.18s:  Like I don't even care to know because whatever the market is going to do is what I care
2184.58s:  about.
2185.66s:  So if I look at the one in September, when we start this rate cutting campaign, I don't
2193.10s:  think that's going to crash the market, especially September.
2195.66s:  Like there would, I would believe that we would need to see some sort of change in other
2204.22s:  contacts about the market, whether we get more economic data that shows that things
2208.02s:  are super weak, kind of like the unemployment revision.
2211.38s:  And we see like a stream of that stuff start coming in.
2214.10s:  Then I do think that that can absolutely have an impact.
2217.14s:  But Muner says I'm willing to make a bet when they start to cut the market will crash.
2221.30s:  Sure.
2222.30s:  Well, what are you thinking?
2225.18s:  Muner, what time frame?
2226.86s:  So they're going to start cutting in September.
2229.02s:  So when's the, when's the crash after September in your opinion?
2237.66s:  Because depending on your answer to that, it'll give me some idea in terms of what you
2242.14s:  think about the immediacy of it.
2245.54s:  Because the other component that again, we have to remember is that if for example,
2256.62s:  Mashin says crash happening, I was so funny.
2259.86s:  Mashin, you read my mind.
2263.10s:  Muner says 2025 will be a bear market as a whole.
2268.62s:  I mean, whatever you say, dog, it's those kinds of statements I find so silly because like,
2274.62s:  you don't know, literally nobody can know, but we really, really want to predict because
2281.34s:  then we sound cool if it happens.
2283.46s:  And it's just so silly, right?
2285.26s:  Like to me, why would I try to predict what's going to happen through all of 2025?
2291.82s:  Why would I try to predict that?
2293.18s:  Like, is a traitor?
2295.02s:  It does nothing for me because if I position wrong and the market does something else,
2299.38s:  I don't make money.
2300.38s:  So like, I'm not even interested in attempting to predict, but I mean, we'll definitely snapshot
2306.50s:  that.
2307.50s:  Actually, let me grab it really quick so that we have it.
2311.58s:  And then we'll see.
2312.58s:  We'll have to, we'll have to set an alert to check out the end of 2025 and see if it's
2317.58s:  a bear market and at which point we will find out if you're a correct or not.
2322.26s:  So yeah, DVD, I suppose.
2329.18s:  Chris says market is great stock market will suck.
2332.30s:  Why do so many people have cash?
2337.22s:  Unfamiliar with what you're referring to.
2341.14s:  Yeah, unfamiliar.
2344.62s:  So anyways, back to Q1 2024.
2349.66s:  So we can see sales contracted, which we don't love.
2355.98s:  We can see, I mean, this typically is not a super favorable reporting period.
2364.82s:  I don't think for them, but I mean, they're moving in the right direction, right?
2371.10s:  So net loss went from 50, 32, a little bit better.
2378.62s:  So loss per share came down, which is good.
2383.18s:  Net loss contracted.
2385.38s:  So like these, these components are good to see.
2389.14s:  And then my guess is that if the company can continue like this broader pivot, and that's
2396.78s:  the part I haven't quite put my finger on yet to try to identify like, where's the
2401.58s:  money going to go?
2403.18s:  Where do we put the billions of dollars in cash that we have at this time?
2410.38s:  So I don't know.
2414.50s:  And to your to the chat's broader point about some sort of hypothesis around.
2426.58s:  You know, what we think they could spend the money on, we don't know.
2431.34s:  And again, like the chat kind of pointed that out that you guys as a community haven't
2437.42s:  seen guidance from them, which I don't blame you for not being frustrated about that,
2444.82s:  especially because we don't necessarily like dilution, but there was dilution to a degree.
2451.90s:  So then we want to at least know that the dilution was done for a good reason and that it will
2458.22s:  lead to profitability.
2460.22s:  And right now that's kind of predicated on a trust fall.
2464.66s:  How much do we trust RC and what he's likely to do with the money?
2470.54s:  So Steve says, having that much money in hand is insane.
2474.98s:  I think they are just waiting for an opportunity.
2480.02s:  I can see your point, but I don't think that's accurate in my opinion.
2484.46s:  The only reason why I don't think that's accurate is because like I don't think the leadership
2489.42s:  would essentially say, hey, share price is really high right now.
2494.02s:  Let's do an at the money and then let's just build up a pile of cash and then see what
2499.66s:  happens.
2500.66s:  Right?
2501.66s:  Like that's actually pretty irresponsible if that's the decision process that they made.
2507.38s:  My guess is that they might have said, hey, stock price is high.
2510.90s:  Let's do an at the money.
2512.40s:  We have a couple ideas that are on the table.
2515.10s:  Let's see if we can push these through.
2517.94s:  That would be the higher probability scenario.
2520.34s:  I would guess and hope.
2522.10s:  I guess I should say it's pure speculation.
2524.22s:  I don't know, but that's what I would hope because that at least means that they're not
2530.42s:  diluting and then essentially diluting and then seeing what happens.
2535.54s:  That's just that's not good leadership.
2537.66s:  That's not good planning.
2539.62s:  So my guess is they have some ideas on what they would want to do with the money.
2547.38s:  I just haven't seen them really indicate to what.
2551.14s:  And I actually think that's very likely to be a significant part of the earnings we
2556.94s:  have coming up on force set.
2560.26s:  And I think that it'll be unfortunate because if I'm not mistaken, I don't think
2564.98s:  the GME typically does an earnings call, right?
2568.22s:  I think they typically do just like a release.
2571.86s:  If I don't know if that's what I think, I'm not sure.
2574.66s:  You guys will have to correct me.
2577.46s:  But my guess is they're going to have to come up with something here.
2584.66s:  They're going to, I do think during the force set meeting after running at the money,
2593.62s:  they have a couple questions that they're going to have to talk about.
2598.82s:  So I'm hopeful that they'll address a little bit more.
2606.02s:  Robo says Larry Chang has posted a lot on X about Berkshire Hathaway model specifically
2610.66s:  around having patients and being ready for the best opportunity possible.
2614.46s:  Yeah, I agree with that.
2616.86s:  And again, the only the only comment I was making before about the at the money and
2621.34s:  raising cash is my guess is they have ideas about what they want to do.
2625.98s:  I don't think it they made a decision to raise a bunch of cash and then just kind of like
2630.58s:  sit there and hope an idea hits them in the face.
2634.22s:  My guess is they have ideas on where they want to pivot and take the company to and they
2639.46s:  know that they're going to need cash to do it.
2641.70s:  And then I fully agree with who was a Robo.
2647.30s:  I fully agree with Robo that it's super likely at this point that they're just waiting until
2657.42s:  the correct thing shows up.
2659.50s:  The only thing I'm trying to differentiate with that statement is I would guess that they
2664.62s:  have an idea of what they want to do.
2667.46s:  Now why they haven't communicated much of it that part I genuinely don't know.
2671.82s:  I really don't.
2674.02s:  And it doesn't fully make sense to me unless that they're trying to maintain a certain
2678.66s:  level of anonymity with their movements.
2682.26s:  And I don't know who their primary competitors are that they might be trying to hide and
2688.14s:  obscure some of their decisions.
2691.06s:  But my guess is again, I think during this force set meeting that there's probably a really,
2696.18s:  really good chance that will at least get something because that's going to be a massive
2700.42s:  question for shareholders, right?
2702.46s:  Probably people that have been holding this thing for years.
2705.50s:  Sooner or later you have to ask the question, what's the fucking plan?
2710.26s:  And he's made some of the plan very clear, right?
2713.50s:  So one of the things he made very clear in his last conversation was the idea of getting
2718.94s:  rid of not profitable stores, leaning into profitable stores, stuff like that, right?
2724.02s:  Like basic stuff.
2725.74s:  But that's part of the plan.
2727.78s:  And I think a lot of people say like, okay, yeah, that part of the, that makes sense.
2731.30s:  I think that's a decent plan.
2733.70s:  But now the bigger question that they're going to have to discuss, I think is, hey, we
2737.62s:  did it at the money.
2739.46s:  And there's a ton of cash that we're sitting on right now.
2743.46s:  What are we doing with this cash?
2747.34s:  Everybody has that question.
2748.62s:  So it would be utterly surprising to me if they choose not to answer that question to
2755.18s:  some degree.
2756.90s:  If they choose not to answer the question, my follow on assumption would be that they
2761.38s:  have something they're working on that they don't want to disrupt.
2766.46s:  That's the only reason I could see why they would do that.
2769.90s:  Because they do run the risk of starting to lose investor confidence.
2774.38s:  And as feverish and supportive as the apes are of the stock.
2779.30s:  Sooner or later people have to pay their bills and they need to know that the money's
2783.10s:  going into something again that's going to drive revenue.
2790.50s:  Raptor says, what do you think of GME buying out pen?
2795.34s:  Who knows?
2796.34s:  Yeah, who knows?
2797.50s:  I don't know how well pen's been doing though.
2800.70s:  Oh, they're doing okay.
2804.50s:  Okay, nevermind.
2806.82s:  They're not doing okay.
2810.18s:  So fun fact, pen is indeed not doing okay.
2813.82s:  Contrary to what I previously thought.
2819.02s:  Wow, interesting.
2825.34s:  So pens gone 72 cents, EPS 13 305 45 negative 4 8 negative 237 negative 7 6 negative 18.
2834.94s:  So that's not necessarily the ideal trajectory you would want to see.
2839.66s:  But yeah, who knows?
2840.66s:  Dude, like, if I think that this is the path that they might, I really don't know.
2849.06s:  I think that's one of the, what's one of the tricky parts here is like literally nobody
2852.62s:  knows.
2853.70s:  Now what I do know is that when you're sitting on a few billion in cash, you do have some
2862.18s:  choices in front of you.
2864.86s:  So that is one benefit is that they're not, they're not backed into a corner right now.
2871.74s:  So that part I, I suppose at least is good.
2876.86s:  But beyond that part, it's so obscure right now.
2881.46s:  All right, let's hop into on demand really fast.
2884.58s:  I want to see if I can go back to some of these like really early days.
2890.10s:  And then I want to go like how far can I go back here?
2894.42s:  Okay, so I can't get back to the earliest stuff that I can get into the 2010.
2901.66s:  All right, here we go.
2905.82s:  So 2010.
2909.82s:  So this was one of my fears.
2930.74s:  We might have to go one day past.
2935.02s:  So one of the issues with on demand is that it'll do this kind of really quirky little
2941.58s:  stuff.
2942.58s:  And also this is the wrong stock.
2943.58s:  We're going to look at GME.
2946.22s:  Okay.
2949.98s:  So all I'm trying to see here is what is the expansion of volume look like leading into
2961.02s:  the total expansion and volume that we see.
2964.74s:  So in this case on the seventh, there was obviously a huge blow up in volume.
2973.58s:  Generation capital says three months of interest on four bill great earnings.
2977.78s:  It's for it's not bad, but it's still too short term in my opinion.
2985.30s:  Again, the company can't get by with like trying to scrape what interests they can earn
2991.18s:  off of their money.
2993.14s:  It's probably like the investor slash trader part of your brain trying to make sense of
2999.50s:  it, which is a fair connection.
3001.70s:  But for a business when they raise cash, typically the idea is to grow the business.
3008.30s:  It's not necessarily to invest the money into bonds, whatever other yielding products
3014.94s:  that they have up front.
3017.66s:  Because that still won't make them as much as a good business decision.
3022.26s:  Like if they can get the capital into something that works really well, they'll make way more
3027.02s:  money with it.
3028.02s:  I got to take this look.
3032.26s:  I shouldn't think.
3037.46s:  So yeah, let me go one day past this.
3042.22s:  I just want to see if it normalizes a little bit.
3053.26s:  So what was this the seventh?
3056.90s:  Okay, so this data is not going to be great.
3061.62s:  That's a little unfortunate.
3062.98s:  We can go a little earlier.
3064.18s:  So let's go to 2021.
3071.02s:  And then we want January 13th.
3074.94s:  So this is where GME had a 92% move.
3085.42s:  So one of the things I notice.
3088.66s:  I'll zoom this in a little bit more.
3091.54s:  One of the things I notice about this move is again, look at the volume before the move.
3099.42s:  The volume exceeds both 20 day average, 5 day average, and then the 5 day average starts
3106.50s:  taking an aggressive slope up.
3110.50s:  Even the day directly before, it still has a disproportionate by volume.
3118.90s:  Nick says, what could make GME $100 billion company?
3125.10s:  That's what I want to see happening.
3128.58s:  I mean, really if they just develop a really solid business model, man, because the community
3135.14s:  supports them extremely well, but as much as the community supports them, they still need
3141.86s:  to drive value and they need to grow their community.
3147.22s:  They need to grow their audience.
3149.46s:  So I think a big part of their ability to scale the company meaningfully is going to come
3154.98s:  down to their ability to execute against that.
3158.58s:  That's at least what I think in the general near term in terms of their positioning.
3163.86s:  It would not surprise me at all to see them acquire a company.
3168.78s:  Like that would not surprise me at all.
3171.22s:  And the reason why it would not surprise me is because it's a way to drastically accelerate
3175.30s:  what they're doing and to start expanding their business lines.
3180.46s:  The brick and mortar stores, they're good, right?
3183.34s:  Like some of them do well, but I don't think that's going to be a reliable way to like
3189.34s:  really grow the company.
3190.94s:  I think the company is going to need more than just the brick and mortar stores.
3195.82s:  And a lot of that in my opinion comes down.
3198.06s:  There's just a limited reach, especially when we've become such an online based economy.
3203.94s:  I have an inversion table to help with the bullshit on my back.
3208.38s:  I literally bought it yesterday and overnighted it via Amazon to my house today.
3217.86s:  And then I built it.
3219.66s:  I had it in less than 24 hours from when I bought it.
3223.10s:  So what I'm highlighting by that is Amazon is a great example of the power of expanding
3230.30s:  your scope because Amazon can sell to anybody anywhere and get them their shit pretty damn
3236.22s:  fast.
3237.58s:  So I think a big part of GameStop is going to be diversifying its business line because
3242.94s:  it still has its online business presence as well.
3245.86s:  And that's good.
3247.30s:  But I think that they have such a potential audience through the gaming community.
3253.46s:  I mean, let's take a look.
3254.62s:  I don't know the numbers, but let's do a quick look.
3257.42s:  How many gamers are there in the US?
3266.54s:  As of June 2024, there are around 212 million gamers, which is about 61% of the population.
3274.02s:  Like you want to talk about density?
3277.78s:  That's insane.
3279.94s:  So they have a massive, massive audience potential there.
3285.10s:  They have a massive audience potential there.
3287.70s:  And I think it would make a ton of sense for them to tap into them.
3292.10s:  Like without a doubt, I think it would make so much sense.
3297.06s:  Now, I don't fully understand the way that they're thinking about the future and
3303.94s:  the vision of the company because that part is still generally obscure to me.
3309.86s:  And that's really just what's going to boil down so what they're going to choose to buy
3314.18s:  into.
3315.78s:  Because they have the opportunity now with the amount of cash that they have to really spread
3320.74s:  into a lot of different things if they choose, which is really cool.
3325.14s:  But I just don't know what direction they want to take things.
3329.34s:  Again, the cool part there is they have the choice.
3332.58s:  They have the choice to take the company in a bunch of different directions if they choose.
3340.50s:  Alfonso says Cohen modeled Chouy on Amazon.
3343.26s:  Gaming doesn't need to be central, just like Amazon's starting with books.
3346.30s:  Yeah.
3347.06s:  I think the point I think with gaming though is that it already offers such a smooth
3354.18s:  on ramp because if there's such a critical population density that likes gaming and a
3361.54s:  lot of the company is already supported by gamers.
3366.74s:  If you give that audience a larger grouping of things that they might like, it really
3373.46s:  makes everything from marketing cheaper, from developing products or whatever services
3379.42s:  you want to offer more efficient.
3381.58s:  You gain so many efficiencies by doing that because the Berkshire model is very different.
3388.42s:  Berkshire is just a holding company and then it buys businesses that continue to operate
3395.66s:  as that business, whatever that business is.
3398.90s:  Now if that's the direction that, you know, if that's the direction that GameStop wants
3405.10s:  to go, I don't see why they couldn't do it.
3407.78s:  That would be kind of a little bit of a vice versa approach to that where they're starting
3414.14s:  as a very specific niche business and then turning into some sort of holding company
3419.26s:  and then acquiring other businesses because the other reality is four billion in cash
3425.02s:  ish is a lot, but that's not like there's literally individual people.
3430.38s:  It's crazy as that sounds with more money than that, right?
3433.54s:  That's not like Berkshire cash.
3436.30s:  It's not like Apple Cash.
3437.94s:  All I'm highlighting is that they have a really good runway, but they also do not have this
3445.54s:  unlimited pile of money to go into and start throwing it wherever they want.
3451.02s:  I think they still are going to have to be pretty thoughtful about the movements and
3455.00s:  the pivots that they choose to make.
3459.26s:  I think it'll be again, my guess it'll be generally discussed at least I hope.
3466.26s:  It will be generally discussed in the force set because I still think that they need
3471.98s:  to address what they've done with the at the money.
3476.62s:  Again, not that it's bad.
3477.78s:  I think it's okay.
3479.34s:  Provided that there's a game plan for the money.
3482.98s:  And I just don't think any of us have really heard much of that game plan yet, unfortunately.
3493.58s:  Alfonso says I'm not a gamer, but aren't in game purchases a big part of the profit
3498.10s:  pie.
3499.66s:  Game stop won't capture any of that selling games and hardware.
3501.74s:  Yeah, I think that's one of the potential downsides to the way that the gaming industry
3507.58s:  is moving because I mean, like I like to play video games periodically.
3512.50s:  And I can't tell you the last time that I bought a physical disc to put in the console.
3519.18s:  And it also is not going to surprise me at all when we eventually see the entire console
3529.86s:  not have an input for a disc.
3532.26s:  Like I actually don't even see why it will longer term.
3536.34s:  So yeah, I think there's probably a lot of changes coming down the pike for the way that
3544.78s:  they do business.
3545.78s:  I think that's exactly why everybody's so interested in how they're going to do business.
3551.66s:  Because I think that there's a lot of different ways that they can pivot still, but they have
3557.26s:  to make some decisions in terms of the way that they want to run it, which again, I don't
3562.98s:  have a great feel for trying to input my credit card number so that I can order barbecue
3570.22s:  tonight.
3571.70s:  That's the move.
3574.30s:  Don't wrong zip code.
3575.30s:  Damn it.
3576.30s:  There we go.
3577.30s:  That should be good.
3585.02s:  Willie says no doubt there's reasons Kodak went out of business tech evolves and they
3588.38s:  didn't pivot in time.
3589.38s:  Yeah.
3590.38s:  And the funny thing to that actually is I went to school in Rochester, New York, where
3598.18s:  Kodak is essentially based out of.
3601.26s:  And I didn't know this, but a fun fact is they have a nuclear reactor.
3606.22s:  They had a nuclear reactor in the base of the building, which is super cool.
3609.38s:  But yeah, you're right.
3610.62s:  They just didn't pivot when they should have.
3613.26s:  Willie says Mexican food part two.
3615.86s:  Now I think we're doing barbecue.
3617.14s:  So tonight will be a trite tip and pulled pork from me.
3623.90s:  And then I think Mel will probably get some sort of chicken, like a chicken something or
3629.42s:  chicken.
3630.42s:  Chris says I'm buying puts for earnings.
3637.82s:  They won't have a call so we won't have info on what their plans are with the cash.
3641.66s:  They can still issue a statement.
3644.66s:  A lot of times again, in place of an earnings call, you can release a statement or they
3650.12s:  can tell you that they're going to do a shareholders meeting.
3653.22s:  That's going to talk a little bit more about whatever you know, their broader plan is.
3658.18s:  So I wouldn't get too disenfranchised if it's not a call.
3662.62s:  The part I wouldn't like just is if there's no information that part would be, I wouldn't
3669.06s:  like that one.
3670.06s:  Okay, so this is the first time or the first move that I see that expanded by at least 50
3675.42s:  percent.
3676.42s:  Now I'm going to go to the 22nd and I want to see how volume moved ahead of this one.
3681.98s:  I'd rather be skiing says barbecue is never a bad choice.
3685.22s:  Yeah, it's always like pretty solid.
3690.58s:  I mean, this is just another prime example of volume being a massive indicator because
3699.86s:  again, like the big move started here with this giant gap up, but the big volume started
3707.38s:  like several days before.
3711.42s:  Let me go to another period.
3712.42s:  I'm going to get out of January.
3715.18s:  Let's go to March 10th.
3718.26s:  That was another period it looks like it started to run and then there it ran intraday like
3728.22s:  a hundred percent.
3730.02s:  Yeah, so similar story.
3734.62s:  Here the volume was a little bit weaker admittedly, but still right before the move.
3740.82s:  In this case, two days before the move, there's a big massive spike in volume.
3748.14s:  Let's go to another period.
3751.14s:  The next one really of the decade would be in May of this year.
3757.34s:  Let's go to May and then let's go to the 13th, which is when it had a 54 percent move
3765.70s:  intraday.
3767.02s:  And this is the other example that we were talking about before.
3770.90s:  So I mean, this generally confirms more or less what I already knew that the one thing
3778.26s:  I can objectively point at with confidence and identify is before all of these larger
3788.34s:  moves, we see an expansion and volume.
3792.38s:  Now the tricky part is running a bit of a regression to see how many times the volume
3803.26s:  starts to move, but price doesn't.
3808.22s:  Because whenever we come up with a hypothesis and idea on how we think something might work,
3814.66s:  it's really important for us to consider the alternate component to that idea.
3819.90s:  So in this case, the idea is, and I can tell it's essentially efficacious to a degree,
3826.74s:  where before the big move starts to happen, we see a pretty massive expansion and volume
3833.98s:  and a higher percentage of by volume over the expanded volume days.
3841.74s:  Now like this period would have triggered, but then it would have just been noise.
3849.46s:  And this is nothing happened.
3851.06s:  And here volume went from four to 10, so it doubled.
3853.82s:  It would have met that threshold, at least that pre-limbed threshold, and it would have
3857.70s:  sustained too.
3858.70s:  Like this would have looked actually really, really good.
3862.66s:  So I think the other part that I look at when I trade stuff like this is the way that
3866.06s:  we use stops to follow the move without getting too overextended.
3877.26s:  I mean, it's one thing to make your money on the move that's unrealized, but then sooner or later,
3885.78s:  you have to realize the money.
3887.14s:  Otherwise, the money just goes back down as the stock goes back down, and then you have nothing.
3892.66s:  You just still hold the stock, which is cool.
3894.62s:  If that's your goal, it's just a whole to stock.
3896.22s:  That's totally fine.
3896.94s:  But from a trading perspective, you would have made zero dollars in that sense.
3902.54s:  So I think part of it is coming up with a slightly more robust plan that allows me to
3911.10s:  follow the move up, capture as much of it as possible, and then as I'm getting stopped
3916.54s:  out on the way down, not being stopped out prematurely, because these things can really
3925.30s:  start to take shape and run.
3929.06s:  So I have a whole host of things that I'm looking at in GameStop specifically this weekend
3935.98s:  to help me understand a little bit more about the price behaviors that it specifically exhibits.
3942.38s:  But the one thing I can say that, again, just doesn't surprise me at all, is that essentially for
3949.66s:  all of these large intraday moves, they're connected by large volume.
3963.18s:  But there are a lot of periods I can see of large volume that did not lead to a 50% move.
3971.58s:  So I guess the other thing I could do here is maybe update the intraday move table to track
3984.22s:  minimum 15% intraday moves.
3989.10s:  So what I want to see now is a little bit more detail behind the side, because I'm limiting
3996.86s:  by 50% moves intraday, which is pretty massive.
4005.50s:  I have to drop the file back in.
4015.26s:  But even a 15% intraday move is pretty meaningful.
4019.02s:  So John says, look for large volume and FTDs on the days where large volume didn't equal large move.
4026.70s:  I think we did some of that.
4041.66s:  And you want FTDs on GameStop, which is here.
4049.10s:  And then, Don, for you, what threshold do you want to look at for FTDs?
4058.62s:  Don says also large volume.
4060.30s:  Yeah, I see what you're doing.
4061.42s:  Yeah, so we've done a lot of this, where we're not just looking at,
4066.14s:  again, that what makes the problem start to become so confounding, when we have
4074.62s:  like 32 different variables that we're trying to track simultaneously, which is really,
4081.66s:  really difficult. So anyways, to that end, we can find instances, let's take a look.
4093.74s:  That led to a decent move.
4096.06s:  So like this expansion and FTDs from 16803 to 19213 didn't lead to any meaningful change in price
4108.54s:  from a high in here.
4114.22s:  This expansion and FTDs from 35,645 to 520,000 didn't lead to an expansion in price.
4126.06s:  In FTDs.
4132.86s:  So this is another example. We went from 204 to 350.
4140.94s:  FTDs, no movement in price.
4146.78s:  So what I'm doing right now, and I want to be very clear about it, I'm not suggesting
4154.38s:  that there's no correlation between FTD and price movement. That's not what I'm suggesting at all.
4160.30s:  What I'm suggesting in doing this is that the relationship is a little more confounding,
4165.66s:  and there's more variables that are part of this than just the FTDs.
4172.54s:  Chris says 34 days, we've done this a bunch of times. We've done this with new and a bunch of times.
4179.26s:  But sure, let me change this to count. We'll go count from. What day are we starting to count from?
4187.18s:  That's the first thing we always have to align on. Are we doing it the day before the FTD expanded
4191.74s:  or are we doing it on the day that the FTD expanded or the day after the FTD contracts?
4200.86s:  How many days after the initial bump until the big spike?
4206.30s:  Okay. So the initial bump. Okay. So you're talking this would be the first day we're counting then,
4213.74s:  right? So the initial bump would be in this case from like 204 to 350. I just want to make sure
4218.46s:  I'm looking at it exactly as you want me to.
4220.46s:  Well, in the meantime, I'll start.
4234.94s:  Oh, that's too many.
4253.90s:  That's still way too many. I didn't realize that it slid me that far.
4257.42s:  Oh, that's the worst. I was literally at 32.
4270.94s:  And then I just went a little too far. Just a little too far. Right. Here we go.
4277.58s:  34. This one, 30 foot. No, that's 34. So this is. So this right here, it's going to count at
4289.58s:  its 209, but just proof of concept right here is where I'm holding the mouse on the bottom.
4293.34s:  It's telling me count is 34. So I'm highlighting the whole row. The high on this day was 1327.
4303.18s:  The start of this was 20. And this is where we're looking at the move from 204 GME
4309.42s:  FTDs to 353,000 GME FTDs. So that's 34 here. And here's a big change. Maybe we'll look at this one.
4326.86s:  This one goes from 624. Let's do this one for 34.
4338.38s:  Here's 34 right here. So on this one, we go from 27 to 21 with 34 counted between these.
4353.34s:  So again, the part I'm trying to make clear is there's more to this. Because here's the problem
4365.98s:  that I think that sometimes we oversimplify in kind of an hour perspective on the trading side is
4373.98s:  when the FTDs happen, there's a lot of different ways that they can manage them without going to
4386.62s:  the open market, I think. And I also think that we're dealing with such a multivariate system
4396.30s:  that trying to again, like we'll count from this one. This is starting from one.
4404.46s:  And then let's go to 34. 32, 33, 38, 34. A key. So this one, we went from 2132 to 2165
4416.30s:  over the 34 day period. And that one. And that was going from 305 to 596.
4425.82s:  Ricky says hype dates have let me down every single time. Yeah, that's probably fair.
4431.90s:  Well, the other thing is like a lot of people have really big expectations for like the expected move.
4437.66s:  Because I know a lot of people they're like really disenfranchised with the way that
4442.78s:  game stop is moving right now. But like this still is moving from a low of 1873 even to now to 22.
4453.42s:  Which again, I know that that's not boring. That's not, you know, this. But that's still not a
4458.86s:  terrible move in something that the entire broader component index that this thing would be a part of
4466.46s:  is going down. Like, that's not terrible. So I think part of it is people also are like so fixated
4473.18s:  on the squeeze and getting this big giant price movement, which I understand. But like, I also
4479.82s:  don't think it's worth like foregoing acknowledging that there's still price movement going on.
4485.74s:  It's just not as powerful as it might be. But
4491.34s:  exactly. So Ricky says screw that the apes demand the moon, which I totally understand. I feel
4496.06s:  you brother. But yeah, anyways, I still see something that's one from 18 to 22, which is not a
4501.42s:  terrible move. It's four points on something that's 18. So anyways, yeah, what we found is for like
4507.66s:  these FTDs even from like some of these really big moves. Let's check this one because this one went
4512.06s:  from let's check the first expansion like this one. This might be something cool. So this one from
4517.50s:  906. So let's go up 34 days. Here. 32. So this went from 35.
4533.66s:  Moving from 35,000 to 900,000 FTDs. This went from 35, 65 to 32. So there's a little bit more,
4547.98s:  again, than just the FTDs. And then that that's the really, really difficult part. Anytime I talk to
4554.86s:  Newton about this, it took me a while to even wrap my brain around the different counting functions,
4560.62s:  whether we use 30, 32, 34, 35. One of the things I was doing is I download this myself
4568.46s:  so that I can kind of manipulate it in my way without messing up, you know, Newton's work.
4573.74s:  And I've run a bunch of different regressions, unessentially all of these different FTD metrics.
4581.18s:  And then combinations of them. And there's just it's mixed. It's very, very mixed. That's
4589.02s:  that's the really hard part here. The one thing I can tell you that has been highly efficacious
4597.18s:  is finding periods where volume in the underlying itself expands. But again, that's probably like a
4606.54s:  boring answer to a lot of people not necessarily what you might want to hear. But
4611.18s:  so this is 34. And this took us from 27 to 31. So a lower move, essentially, than we've seen in
4623.50s:  the last couple of weeks without anything. So yeah, Chris, does that? I just wanted to give
4635.02s:  the idea that we're looking at here like a like a solid exploration. Because again,
4640.54s:  I'm learning. I don't know either. I'm trying to figure it out the same as you guys. I do not pretend
4646.94s:  that I know or have some sort of strong predictive quality again beyond volume. I can confidently
4651.90s:  point at volume and say this is going to be part of it whenever things start moving. And that's not
4657.98s:  unique to GameStop. That's what I use as an indicator for a lot of what I look at because volume
4665.18s:  is almost always going to be a part of the puzzle. But with something like this, it's just really tricky
4673.18s:  because there's so many, so many sub components that are very difficult to track.
4683.58s:  Matt says, would the fact that they fail to deliver mean that FDDs wouldn't make price move
4688.14s:  in the theory that they can keep failing to deliver using different ETFs will won't be predictable?
4693.74s:  Well, I think they're incentivized to not continue to fail to deliver for overly extended
4703.66s:  durations of time, which is part of the reasons why I think they go through the redemption
4708.46s:  creation cycles with component ETFs. So I view that more so as a way for them to juggle and not to
4717.42s:  get snagged with repeated FDDs, which then starts to potentially negatively impact some of the
4726.78s:  standing that they'll have with the exchanges. So I view the FDD cycles to be difficult to nail
4735.10s:  down for that exact reason because there's different ways that they can satisfy FDD's short term
4741.90s:  by kind of playing this juggling game, which makes it very difficult then to identify.
4749.90s:  Chris says, oh, Chris, you are here. Why don't you leave me hanging? I was trying to look at your
4753.66s:  idea and you just bounced. Don says, Matt, I think that the juggling is how they buy,
4759.26s:  how they get by, what bit is all their animal social equity was exhausted. I agree with that.
4764.30s:  I think that was a big, big part of this. So to Don's point, he's saying that all their
4771.42s:  imisources, a liquidity were exhausted. And I completely agree with that. I think that's one of the
4776.30s:  reasons why we see the movement that we do in GameStop is when liquidity is so strapped,
4783.18s:  they run out of places to go. But for those that haven't seen, I think that this is like a must watch
4790.22s:  video for any ape. Is this one here? ETF. I'm looking forward, sorry.
4807.10s:  This guy.
4821.50s:  A key. You four year web says, Chris, you're a clairvoyant. Tell me where I'll be in five years
4829.18s:  please. Also, Chris, if you are clairvoyant, really, I have to be honest with you. One of the big
4833.98s:  questions I have is when this is fucking sciatica, go away. Today's my anniversary, actually,
4839.34s:  for the sciatica shit starting and this marks one full month of this. So while you're answering,
4846.70s:  you four year about the five year plan, I would be actually really cool with like just a few
4850.94s:  months, maybe like two months. Is this still going in two months? That would be great.
4856.06s:  Captain Chris says made 46K on June 6th. Wouldn't have known this if it wasn't from Newton's
4867.98s:  hype dates for June 6th. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great that you're able to cash in on June 6th.
4873.18s:  That's that's awesome. That's absolutely awesome. If we take a look at June 6th,
4879.50s:  Ki? Yeah, that's a great day. Big, big move. So the again, the way I, because I traded this
4892.06s:  and I traded this, but the way that I traded this was like literally off of expansion and volume.
4901.50s:  So we can see volume when crazy as the stock was flying towards the moon at least.
4909.74s:  And then it started coming back down. We can see volume contracting, contracting, contracting,
4914.54s:  starting to get really quiet. So it's really normalizing essentially to these levels.
4920.30s:  And then all of a sudden, massive volume. And so the cool part is, is like even on the day of
4926.78s:  the move, you can see this volume coming in because as this volume is building on the day,
4933.90s:  early in the day, it starts to exceed the previous day entire volume while there's still
4939.18s:  plenty of time left in the day. And as that's happening, that's kind of like your, your red warning
4944.22s:  system that like some shit's going on. What it is, we don't always know, but some things happening.
4950.38s:  So this is one of the things that I pay attention to personally. And it's because I'm an idiot.
4957.50s:  I'm not as good as trying to connect a lot of different dots and stuff like that. And I actually
4963.34s:  think that's one of the reasons why Newton, he has a fascinating approach to, to GameStop because
4969.18s:  a lot of what he does is he just holds the stock. And by just holding the stock, you're,
4976.06s:  you maintain exposure. Now, and that's more like from an investor, from a trader perspective,
4986.62s:  there's an opportunity cost to just holding. And I need to make money on movement.
4993.02s:  So most of my system is predicated around identifying movement so that I can hopefully extract
5000.62s:  value while something is in motion. And then as motion starts to calm down, I'll try to find my
5007.42s:  way into other things that are showing a bunch of movement. Chris says totally throwing this out
5019.18s:  there, but I suspect early November push as well as January. Yeah, maybe I have no idea.
5026.46s:  I don't, again, like I don't try, I really don't try to even determine when I think something's
5031.66s:  going to move because again, you've heard me say it, but like the one thing I know, I will tell
5038.86s:  you like I know what will happen is as this thing starts to move all these little tiny volume bars,
5046.46s:  there's going to be some monster volume bars that are going to move. While this thing starts to
5052.70s:  pick up momentum. And before it has anything like this, it's going to have periods of elevated
5060.22s:  volume into that period. All of the previous squeezes that I've looked at specifically in GameStop,
5067.26s:  and this is one of the things I was actually curious about is is it quiet until the day of the move
5073.50s:  and then does it start to run, but it doesn't. I've seen in all of the dates I've looked at so far
5079.34s:  in GameStop for previous moves is that before it has its biggest moves, you'll see these
5085.66s:  pre-moves that start sprouting up where the candles themselves wide now volume starts expanding.
5093.42s:  So to me, that's kind of a really simple thing to keep an eyeball out for. So in this case,
5100.94s:  I literally just wait for volume to start coming up and you know to who is it?
5108.46s:  To Captain Chris's point, whether that's November, December, January, February, March,
5114.46s:  regardless of the month or the mechanism that starts to drive it, that is going to happen.
5120.78s:  Volume is going to move. So whether it's an FTD that kicks it off in some way because as they're
5126.86s:  trying to go to their favorite ETF and go through a redemption cycle, they can't get it there for
5131.66s:  some reason. So there's another regulation that's stopping them at that point in time, at that
5135.74s:  specific instance for whatever reason that then forces them to do something else.
5140.46s:  Or if it's driven from an OPEX tailwinds because the option markets are getting super crazy and
5145.26s:  there's a lot of people in their playing that are causing market makers to be longer, short gamma,
5150.70s:  depending on what they're doing. And they can exacerbate intraday moves. Like all of those
5156.86s:  reasons why price and volume start to move, they cause the same thing to occur volume.
5166.70s:  So I limit down again from the trading perspective. I limit down what I'm looking to be the
5173.26s:  the cleanest signal I can find. Now I enjoy again like that video I shared with you all a
5179.66s:  little bit earlier about the ETF redemption cycle and the structural FTDs and shorting.
5186.54s:  I'm interested in that because it's fascinating to me. Literally it's fascinating.
5190.70s:  But beyond that, it's really difficult to trade off of because as I go through the data,
5196.62s:  there's a healthy mix of signal that leads to positive movement and negative movement.
5203.66s:  It makes a really, really tricky in order to trade.
5208.54s:  Captain Chris says Newton talked about June 6th for over a month before it happening. He
5213.98s:  suspected the pattern almost two months based on, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying is
5219.50s:  Newton is, well, I don't know if you're talking to me or I see you're talking to Alfonso.
5225.26s:  Yeah, but I mean, also to I remember Newton was like really, really stoked about the eighth of August.
5234.70s:  He was really, really interested in eight aug, which there wasn't a whole lot that happened
5241.34s:  there. It wasn't a bad day. But the point is, I think it's important and Newton is fantastic about
5248.78s:  this as with most of the people that I work with just in terms of exploring the product.
5254.46s:  It's really, really important for us to look at not just because this is the human tendency.
5260.70s:  The human tendency is if I Eric, if I make 12 calls or predictions about what's going to happen
5268.06s:  over a 52 week period, over the period of an entire year, if I make that number of calls over
5277.42s:  a 52 week period, and let's say I make 30 calls, let's say 22 of them are wrong and eight of them
5284.78s:  are right. What I'm going to do is focus on the eight that I'm right on. And that's not even because
5291.02s:  I'm trying to be dismissive. It's not because I'm trying to trick other people. It's because
5296.78s:  that's human tendency is to look at the positive outcomes. So when I look at stuff, one of these things,
5304.38s:  I'm really, really careful with doing, and it's from my trading background, as you could tell when
5311.42s:  we were doing the FTD stuff, or even when I was looking at price by volume earlier in the live stream,
5316.78s:  is I'm interested in not just identifying the periods where something worked in my favor,
5322.46s:  but I want to look at the periods where the perceived signal occurred, all of those instances,
5328.46s:  and then see what happens. So again, a really good example of that is this move here.
5335.66s:  According to the volume component that I'm telling you about, this is an example where it didn't work.
5342.78s:  This is an example where if I started buying in here on 25 March, and I didn't perfectly
5350.06s:  time this exit on this gap down somehow, then I would just be sitting there holding a losing trade,
5357.18s:  which is part of trading. We've become so strange as traders with a complete inability to be okay
5366.30s:  with losing positions and understanding that while we're in the process of trying to come up with
5371.90s:  what we think might happen, we're going to get it wrong a bunch, and that's okay. As long as we're
5376.78s:  not betting the farm every single time, you can get it wrong a ton of times, and then the times that
5382.14s:  you get it right, if you have good money management, you can make way more than what you would have
5386.30s:  lost on those other periods. But again, that's a little bit more of just a general traders approach.
5392.46s:  From investing, it's very different. It looks like we have Chris that also joined as an outliers
5397.42s:  supporter. Thanks, bro. Welcome to the game. ApoSpace says, Tom of hype dates do nothing,
5405.02s:  which is fine. Yeah, exactly. Because even as different people, some people want to pick the date
5410.94s:  so that they're the guy or gal that did it. And there's a lot of people that really just enjoy
5416.94s:  the ego-assaging effect of being right. But way more importantly is as people come up with
5425.74s:  these different predictions, these different hype dates is the exchange of information.
5429.90s:  We get to learn a lot from people and what they're looking at and the way that they're arriving at
5436.30s:  their conclusions. And I have to be honest with you, a lot of the due diligence that people send to
5441.02s:  me, I don't find very robust just from an analysis perspective. But I find it fascinating. And almost
5448.62s:  all of them have really interesting pieces that I can look at and say, Oh, interesting. I might not
5454.70s:  have considered that before. And that's exactly what Newton is a wizard at as the scribe of GME,
5462.86s:  because he takes all these individual pieces and he starts collecting them. And he builds this
5468.38s:  really incredible reference sheet for all of us to use. And he maintains it on his own time
5474.78s:  so that we can have a collated source of information, which is absolutely massive, I think.
5482.62s:  You for you, let me go back. You for you says also the cash with theoretically bringing buyers,
5492.38s:  no, it could. But again, like from I assume you mean buyers from the stock, right? Like people
5499.74s:  interested in becoming long game stop, because if you're referring to it in that context,
5505.90s:  just because a company has cash, doesn't mean I'm going to buy it. Again, when I buy a company,
5511.18s:  is it is a true investor, not as a fan of game stop, not as, you know, anybody that's interested
5516.70s:  in the story, just as is an objective investor. Cash doesn't mean much to me. Cash can be used
5524.06s:  for good for bad. It can be used well. It could be used poorly. What I care about is the efficacy of
5531.34s:  a business does a business make money? Does a business have a promising roadmap to continue making
5538.54s:  money into the future? Does a business have a moat that makes it difficult for other businesses
5545.18s:  to come in and start scooping up my lunch? Is the business in a highly competitive landscape
5551.66s:  that makes it difficult for it to grow and consume market share from other businesses?
5557.98s:  So those are just a few things. So as an investor, it's not at all just about cash. If a company
5565.90s:  is a bunch of cash, it's good for them. But as an investor, I need to know what the cash is used
5570.62s:  for. The cash doesn't do me any favors. The cash is priced into the stock right now.
5576.38s:  So if I'm an investor, I make money when the company appreciates in value, which then means the
5584.46s:  stock price goes up as the company appreciates in value, meaning more revenue, more sales,
5590.38s:  better profit margins. That's the shit that matters. So to your point, it would be something as an
5596.94s:  investor, I would be like, Oh, interesting. This company has a lot of money. This company has,
5604.86s:  I would consider to be a fairly revolutionary leader in Cohen because of what he did with GameStop
5611.58s:  in the landscape that he did, which is not easy. So with that, I would be interested. But does that
5618.14s:  mean I buy right now? Again, personally, no. If I didn't like the story, I have GameStop, but it's
5625.66s:  more because I'm a fan. It's less because I think that at this exact second, that's the best place
5631.98s:  for the money. So a lot of investors are going to wait until they see what's happening with the
5637.50s:  money. What's the plan here? And what can we do with the capital to then feed the business,
5644.46s:  to be more successful? That's where it starts to get really interesting. But them just having a
5649.26s:  few billion in cash again, it sounds like a ton of money to a regular person like us, but is a
5655.18s:  company that it's not like this insane amount of money. Actually, let's see what percentage
5660.62s:  of US publicly rated companies have over two billion in cash on hand.
5675.18s:  I'm not tonight. Round two. I tried somewhere else, right over here.
5691.98s:  I don't know the answer to this. I'm actually curious.
5703.50s:  15% of publicly traded companies have over two billion in cash on hand.
5712.14s:  This is from companies market cap and finance charts. So I don't know, I didn't like click into
5719.66s:  the source. I don't know how efficacious it is. But yeah, Andrew says grab Jamie with both hands
5727.82s:  just my opinion. I think that that's again, that's totally, totally fair. I think there's a lot of
5734.78s:  different ways to approach markets. So for the people that have a more investor mindset,
5743.42s:  where we want to get in when it's cheap, we want to get in before the rest of the market starts
5749.10s:  identifying the future value of the product. Yeah, like I can see why people specifically investors
5757.26s:  would want to get in a little bit early for those reasons. For me, again, I'm a trader. I need
5763.58s:  things to move and there's a significant opportunity cost to my capital. So I'm very cautious about
5771.10s:  where I choose to put money. And in order for things to literally earn my money, I have to see
5777.42s:  certain behaviors. And it's why in GameStop, I still have the shares as I've told you all.
5784.38s:  But I do not have the same speculative long option positions or short option positions
5791.42s:  as I had on previously because it's not doing this. This I can make money off of this. I can make
5797.34s:  money off of this. I can make money off of this is difficult to make money off of for me. So
5804.70s:  there's a couple different ways that I have to play the product in order again, for it to make
5811.26s:  sense for my book. But for an investor, if again, the hypothesis is we trust Cohen, we think he's
5818.70s:  going to do some magical stuff for the company. And now he's equipped with a few bill in cash to do it.
5824.78s:  Shit dude. Like that's a compelling argument. I'm so eager for the fourth. I'm so eager for the
5833.50s:  fourth. I am so curious if and what they're going to say. Because I haven't seen them say much
5844.78s:  about the offering and the impetus behind it, the vision for after it. Really Larry Chang has been
5854.70s:  like kind of my go-to information source. And he doesn't really talk much about the company
5861.34s:  directly. He talks a lot about like broader things. And the reason why I go to him is because
5868.14s:  I just don't see much come out from Cohen. Cohen likes to troll on X, which is cool. But like I don't
5874.94s:  get a bunch of market data that I can evaluate the product from that unfortunately. So when I'm looking
5884.14s:  at GameStop, I'm very, very, very eager to see what comes out on the fourth. Euphoria says Larry
5891.34s:  definitely says things that way by design. Absolutely. And he makes a lot of parallels. I noticed that
5897.98s:  with GameStop in general. I don't know if it's just like an aura about the kind of people that it
5903.42s:  draws into its sphere or what it is. But like if we look at anybody that I've seen really communicate
5910.70s:  around GameStop, roaring Kitty, Chang, Cohen, none of them are like direct communicators, none of them.
5921.18s:  Which again, I just find that interesting. It adds a fascinating, fascinating story behind it.
5930.38s:  Willie says he definitely talks in an abstract manner. I appreciate his post as they signal
5935.26s:  and involve management team. I agree. I completely agree. Willie says I can sleep at night knowing
5940.70s:  the management team. They're super fucking smart. Like they're super smart, bro. When I was reading
5946.06s:  through Cohen's deposition for the... What the fuck is the case? I forgot. Who's it? BVBY.
5959.18s:  So in that case, you could tell a lot about the way that he handles stress in different data points.
5971.74s:  Smart, dude. He's really smart. And he came from a pretty effective business background. So yeah,
5978.62s:  I completely agree with like having a lot of confidence.
5982.38s:  Ape of Spades says they can't signal specifics, but they need to let Ape's investors see
5988.94s:  they let them know. Yeah, I agree. And again, one of the things is it's okay to talk about broad plans.
5997.98s:  And that's why I'm hopeful that they'll do it, especially following the at the money. Because
6005.26s:  like tons of huge companies give very specific plans about what they're doing over the next quarter.
6012.06s:  And they can still execute against it because they have like a really good plan in place. That's
6017.34s:  fairly robust. So I was literally just going to bring that up. That's a perfect point,
6024.86s:  Rebel Darkside, who says Ryan Cohen said we keep quiet and just work, which I agree. Like I think
6030.70s:  that there's something there. But I think the problem is when exactly she you're all's point in
6037.34s:  the chat is if that's your approach, you can do that. And he does do that, I believe. But
6044.30s:  you're also in a leadership position. You lead not just a company, but you lead the investors
6051.58s:  in the company. And if we want like you all were talking about it earlier, other investors to be
6058.06s:  interested in buying game step, buying game stop because we see the cash that it has now.
6064.46s:  Well, if we want that to happen, we kind of have to have some ideas about what's going on here.
6070.86s:  Because if you know nothing about Ryan Cohen, his leadership team, what his history is and kind of
6077.26s:  how he's a bit of an activist investor and CEO, if you don't know any of that. And you think about
6082.86s:  game stop again, completely agnostic to all of what we know as background. If you ask a regular
6089.34s:  person about game stop, they're going to say, oh, it's a brick and mortar store that's dying like
6092.70s:  blockbuster. And that's not a terrible, that's not like a crazy assumption to come up with.
6098.86s:  It's a fair guess to take. But the way that they start to pivot that narrative for kind of the
6106.38s:  lay or more hands off investor is by communicating and giving them some ideas about what our ideas are,
6114.38s:  what we're thinking about. Because again, like during the September 4th earnings, they literally
6119.58s:  can say something like we had a good or bad quarter. I think the quarter typically is not great
6126.62s:  for them. But we had a bad quarter. This is what happened. These are some of the things we're
6132.38s:  doing to turn the company around. We did an at the money offering, which increased our cash to,
6137.10s:  you know, X billion dollars while we have a series of ideas on what we want to do with it.
6143.02s:  We're interested in investing in the business, in acquiring other businesses, in expanding our
6149.02s:  footprint, in expanding our audience. Like we can talk about all of those ideas, indicating some
6158.70s:  intent with giving zero specifics. And I still think that would be really well received.
6164.94s:  Because unfortunately, I feel like the GME shareholders for so long have just kind of been going on
6169.98s:  like pure faith, which fuck man, like it's another reason why I love this whole thing so much is
6177.98s:  because the community is so sticky and it's so interesting to find that because it's literally
6186.62s:  anomalous. Ape of space says, so why would they not? There must be a reason. Exactly. And I agree with
6193.26s:  you there. If they don't on like, why wouldn't they from the at the money offering? It's because
6198.62s:  they don't owe anybody that necessarily. And they might be waiting until whatever they're thinking of
6204.06s:  is a little more fleshed out. Like that's fairly common. So I do think though that come the
6211.58s:  fourth of September, if they don't, that would lead a huge question mark in my mind because
6217.42s:  much like what you're saying, Ape of spades, I really don't know why they wouldn't. And I agree with
6223.26s:  Chris here, Chris says closing stores is not bad. It's smart. Get rid of the cost. We buy that's
6228.30s:  exactly correct. And I think I think closing stores in their case is not a bad move at all.
6235.74s:  And I think it's smart that they're still leaning into expanding their successful stores because
6243.26s:  there could be stores that are in a good location that when somebody needs some sort of peripherals
6248.22s:  or hardware, they can just go grab it and go back home. Like that's huge and that can absolutely
6253.82s:  lead to a pretty good profitable picture. Now, I think what we need more than that though is again,
6261.58s:  to see GameStop pivot into the modern age and to pivot into the potential audience that is
6270.70s:  broader online gamers. And it doesn't have to be relegated to gamers again, like as the chat was
6275.98s:  pointing out, if we think that they should start expanding into other things, that's cool too.
6281.42s:  And I think that it makes a ton of sense just exactly as Alfonso is bringing up like trading
6286.86s:  cards, right? Like people are collectors. I think that makes a lot of sense. I sent Newton
6291.18s:  Pokemon cards from one of our live streams. So yeah, like there's stuff that you really have to go
6297.58s:  there to get, which is good. But when you look at a lot of their primary profit driving factors,
6303.10s:  it's from console releases. And the reality of console releases is changing quite a lot. And like
6310.62s:  we already talked about the way you buy games is completely different. And I think it's going to
6315.18s:  become increasingly digital. I think it'll probably be a point where it gets to where you don't even
6319.98s:  have to store the game on your own machine that it's just cloud-based completely. But there's a lot
6325.82s:  of ways for I think GameStop to innovate and still tap into a similar audience, which would be
6331.82s:  really, really efficient for them, I think at least. But we have to see, yeah, we have to see
6339.58s:  what they're thinking and what they want to do. Because again, that is one of the downsides
6343.34s:  that we have right now is that we don't actually really know where they're trying to pivot or
6349.02s:  what the model is. Alfonso says, where do you insert the disk in an MS vision, bro? Yeah,
6356.94s:  it's actually funny. My buddy, he was visiting his cousins who were like really young. And he told
6363.58s:  them to put the disk in. I think they were going to play Call of Duty or something as cousins are
6368.78s:  and they put the disk in upside down. So they didn't even really know how it worked,
6372.70s:  which is hilarious. Makes total sense, but just hilarious.
6378.30s:  Big fan of that. G33 says, Kitty said, you're not looking hard enough. He gave us the answer.
6384.70s:  If you didn't pay attention, you don't know. I don't know. Shit. If you guys know the answer,
6389.02s:  G33, if you know the answer, dog, tell me because I genuinely don't know. I tell you guys,
6394.22s:  I am the village idiot. I do not pretend to be the guy that knows because I do not.
6399.98s:  Well, he says going into the tournament business would be a game changer.
6403.66s:  They are usually organized at a local level. These can be massive and attendance. And I mean,
6409.66s:  they have like really, really big offerings as well. So they have these broader
6418.94s:  competitions. I think getting into some sort of gaming competition makes it ton of sense.
6424.62s:  I mean, I also think they can get into media of some sort. Think of all the different games
6429.90s:  that it exists that people would love a Netflix series on. How sick would that be?
6437.42s:  Where I don't know like super popular games, but if there's like a, a wow, I know that's
6442.62s:  pretty popular. If there's a wow setup that GameStop could get involved in the production of
6449.66s:  different video game based TV series, like I think that would be sick.
6455.50s:  I think there's a ton of ways to go about it. Ape of trade says Witcher. Yeah. And they,
6462.22s:  they did Witcher so dirty because who's the older guy? Vesemir. They did Vesemir so dirty.
6470.86s:  This straight up disrespectful of Vesemir. I can't believe they did them like that.
6475.18s:  G 33 says Ready Player One is a big clue.
6483.42s:  Yep. I don't. I'm sure it is, but I also think you might overestimate
6491.18s:  how dumb I am in my ability to connect those dots. But yeah.
6501.02s:  Chris says AMC made a killing on the Taylor Swift crap. I don't know much about that, but that's
6506.46s:  interesting. Everybody's interested in G 33's ideas. I mean, guys, you kind of know what the deal is.
6518.06s:  Like G 33 doesn't know just like the rest of us. Nobody knows. Anybody that says that they
6523.74s:  definitively know is it's it's just a fallacy. It's untrue because we can't know. None of us know.
6531.90s:  Now I do think that there are probably hints on what we think might happen. That's fair. And
6539.10s:  I think it's okay to have ideas. But I don't actually think anybody actually knows because
6548.14s:  nobody up into this point has really nailed most of this stuff.
6554.62s:  Chris says movie on the Taylor Swift tour movie. My daughter loved it. Oh, interesting. I did not know that.
6565.74s:  Yeah, I did not know that.
6568.94s:  One sec. I gotta.
6584.54s:  Or barbecue just arrived. So I was having my wife grab it really.
6598.38s:  What else we got?
6605.58s:  Andrew says did our cake get into serious? I don't know. I don't think there's really any
6610.46s:  way for us to tell because the other thing at this point is I don't really know where they're at
6616.38s:  with their capital. They are being roaring kitty versus a slash Keith Gale depending on,
6622.62s:  you know, which personality is transacting. But I think it wouldn't be insane. But I'm still trying
6635.58s:  to fully track the pivot from GameStop to Chewy, whether it was a full pivot, partial pivot,
6641.50s:  temporary pivot, like all those things I don't know. But they're actually hold on.
6653.74s:  All right. Yo, my head has gotten bigger.
6656.94s:  There we go. So when we're thinking about the potential pivot of
6667.10s:  roaring kitty from GME to something like Chewy, at least temporarily, the one thing I can clearly
6673.34s:  identify is he obviously got into Chewy. It seems partially from the fact that Cohen
6686.94s:  is affiliated with Chewy. And it's also the reason why I surmised he did 9,000,000 shares
6694.54s:  because also likely a shout out to Cohen. So the part that I don't understand though is beyond
6706.62s:  the shout out to Cohen, like really why Chewy? I don't like that this cuts my horns off
6713.50s:  because they my Viking tinfoil hat needs to be respected. Hold on, I'll let you guys see,
6719.02s:  there you go. There's the whole thing. My head has gotten bigger. So it a fat head. But there's the
6729.18s:  there's the full hat. But when I look at the movement of Chewy, it's been okay, but not crazy.
6742.14s:  And we think he got in what I forgot the data of the transaction was at like the 24th? Is that
6747.02s:  yet in here? So he's not like crushing it in Chewy either. Now maybe there's some sort of
6754.54s:  expectation for earnings, but I don't understand why he would have done this on the 24th
6760.46s:  with the idea of playing earnings out here. It seems like for most of his prior
6765.90s:  speculative trades that it would happen about a month out is what I've seen from like the rest
6772.46s:  of his footprint. Unshore. But you know, so I'm not convinced that he did it necessarily for earnings.
6784.94s:  Ape of spades, Willie says that aim to be his buff is here one day. Yeah, man, it's just been a
6791.82s:  long time of working out, bro. Ape of spades says he does seem to be able to call it right before
6797.66s:  it moves. Well, it's he gets in like 30 days is what I noticed from most of his prior trades.
6802.38s:  It's like three weeks to four weeks that he starts to enter. And there's also a reality. Again,
6809.90s:  I'm not insinuating that he's a pump and dumper. I don't believe that that's in his personality.
6814.78s:  I don't believe that that's his intention whatsoever. But again, objectively speaking,
6821.10s:  I know for fact, if Roryn Kitty posts something about his position, there's going to be other people
6827.42s:  going into the position. I know that for fact. Now again, I do not think that that makes him a pump
6833.18s:  and dumper. I think that that means that people really value what he does and they want to follow him.
6839.02s:  But that that that is a price behavior that I can clearly identify as well. So I don't fully think
6850.14s:  that that's what the game plan was in this case, though, like because I think Roryn Kitty knows
6854.94s:  better about the ape community that the probability of a bunch of apes that have been in GameStop
6863.74s:  for three years are going to just pour over into Chui. I just I don't think that he would think
6869.90s:  that or expect that. So I'm unsure. Euphoria says doesn't DFV always end up updating his yellow
6878.38s:  on red at any time as GME position changes? I don't think so. I don't think that's true at all,
6883.90s:  to be honest. Because he went he went dark for a long time and you don't go from
6893.50s:  his account value. What it was to what it was when he came back without doing some shit. So
6902.38s:  I would I would not believe. Yeah, I would personally not believe that he updates it every time he
6912.86s:  makes a change. I don't I don't see that personally. Euphoria says what if his shares never changed?
6921.10s:  It could be, but I believe it to be exceedingly unlikely that his shares never changed.
6930.14s:  Could be, but again, my opinion mega unlikely. The reason why I think it's super unlikely
6942.54s:  is because in this case, he only had $6.3 million left right here. And we saw his filing
6955.10s:  and his filing. I'm near positive, pegged him into Chui on the 24th. So even if we give him
6964.06s:  kind of mid price on the 24th, let's call it like 2585. So 2585 times 9 million, 1000 shares.
6976.70s:  He needs 232.675 million, which
6983.18s:  that's essentially the value of this account. So with that is the value of this account. I don't
6995.50s:  believe that to be the case. Now the other thing that hooked on options, that's a great name. That's
7003.50s:  such a great name. What a great name said. Didn't they reduce the flow? They did, I think in Chui.
7009.74s:  So, Spostcar says he has other accounts. Yeah, so that's another argument I hear that I, again,
7017.90s:  he spoke against directly himself. So I take him at his word. So if I look up GME live stream,
7028.38s:  or roaring kitty, my bad, roaring kitty live stream.
7033.10s:  What a game.
7038.06s:  What a gang. I think we're back at it. I've never had that happen before. So I got like this
7044.54s:  Nvidia codec error. I don't even know what that is. I tried to open up another tab. Maybe
7050.14s:  because I literally just have too many tabs open or something. I have a built computer. I literally
7055.42s:  went and did my standard move when it comes to computers. And I always overbuild the computer.
7062.62s:  I got it from origin. And I essentially talk to the nerds and see what kind of computer they
7070.62s:  recommend for essentially being able to do all the crazy shit. And so anyways, it's an expensive
7077.58s:  computer that should be good. But for whenever he said it's it's struggling. As soon as I opened up
7083.74s:  this tab, which I can help but find interesting. All right, back to this though.
7088.86s:  So the comment about their being another account. Let's listen to this together. I like to share
7096.06s:  this because again, like I prefer it not to be based on opinion as much as possible. And to
7102.38s:  base it on as much general data as I can. So I'm going to turn on the desktop audio so that you
7109.50s:  can hear this should come through. And then let's just listen to this part where he brings up his
7114.22s:  account right here. It's a true yellow again. I suppose. I know there's some cash there. That's
7120.94s:  what I mean. It depends on your positions. But it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying?
7127.82s:  It's how I roll. So that's that's out there. But I seen those headlines. E-Trade.
7134.22s:  So then he just trolls a little bit because E-Trade was talking about whether or not they're going
7138.46s:  to close this position. So then he just plays by removing their logo on the HTML just being fun.
7144.38s:  Good. Those positions are there. Those positions are there. But I'll do it. I'll remove it. Don't
7149.26s:  make me. Don't make me too. And I know how to do it back. I mean, he's like, oh, he's squinting
7157.98s:  and there's a waking up. I'm like, what the hell? Well, that's where it was. Right word. That's
7162.46s:  the whole. See, I wait until the halt because if if and so yeah, there you go. There you go. I'm
7168.94s:  halted. I don't know why it does. It's going down. It's like, especially once I'm involved because
7173.66s:  they're I get to share someone's time. I'm doing my best. I'm going to do it. Fine. There you go.
7180.78s:  All right. Yeah. Those are my only positions. You know, as you know, tears. I got a lot there.
7186.06s:  So those, yeah, those are my only positions, you know, as you know, so that's that's kind of the
7191.58s:  part I'm highlighting is that he talks about at this time, these being his only positions, he
7196.46s:  talks about that that's the cash that he has in here. And he also talks in the stream about the
7204.06s:  accusations that he has other accounts or backers, people that are essentially feeding a money.
7209.50s:  And he says like, this is his account. And there's nobody else helping him. So I understand the idea
7218.86s:  that maybe we think there's another account that he's pulling money from or doing something
7223.26s:  else in, but he kind of talks about it directly in this live stream. So I just take him at face value.
7230.70s:  The Robo says, unless you consider cash a position, the reason why he says that you have to listen
7236.54s:  to it in context is because he's holding cash in the account. So when he says these are my only
7242.30s:  positions, unless you consider cash a position because he has cash. So then he's just tying those two
7250.14s:  together. That's why he's saying that he's not suggesting that he, you know, unless you consider
7254.70s:  cash a position, I have a bunch of a cash in another account. Now, I don't know, right? Tim
7259.74s:  Foyle hats on. He could. And I also think that it would be highly unlikely with how much money he's
7265.98s:  made that he would put literally all of his money into this. But my other assumption on top of that
7274.22s:  is that he wouldn't have another account with hundreds of millions of dollars that he expected to
7281.98s:  trade with and not have it in there from the jump. That I don't see happening because it just,
7288.46s:  it wouldn't, it wouldn't make sense. Now, one of the difficult parts with this whole saga is a lot
7293.18s:  of it doesn't make sense. It's just kind of strange. So yeah, I think when I look at the, the
7301.58s:  implications of that, when I think about, when I think about the positions, like I just, I don't see
7310.54s:  him squirreling up another quarter billion dollars to simultaneously have a GME and
7317.50s:  a chewy position is my guess.
7325.42s:  Alfonso says, what was that video from? This is two months ago.
7329.98s:  RK clearly counted his position as having 150 plus securities in an early video. Yeah, that's a long time
7335.98s:  ago. Yeah. So one of the things I went back and I listened to a lot of his OG videos to learn a
7345.10s:  little bit more about him. And in this case, what I learned is that he actually changed his style
7353.50s:  pretty massively. So in his early videos, you can see all these stocks that he looks at, he kind of
7359.18s:  considers himself this value investor, but he talks about his pivot from being a value investor.
7366.86s:  And I think it was in one of these spreadsheet videos because what I learned from that is he started
7372.78s:  as a value investor, but then he was, he literally talked about this himself on paraphrasing because
7377.58s:  I don't remember it exactly, but he talks about how he got tired of essentially coming up with all
7385.10s:  these different companies, coming up with all these individual names and then putting positions
7389.26s:  on and then they're just not moving. So I don't know what led him to kind of, sorry, this is hot,
7395.58s:  I gotta take it off. I don't know what led him to make the pivot in from having a bunch of
7402.70s:  different names like you can see here, tons of names to being in just one thing. I don't know what
7408.70s:  led to that pivot. That's a massive, massive pivot to make though.
7417.26s:  Rebel Darksides, honestly, I think you know Ryan Cohen and would dilute and that's why he laughed
7422.06s:  and I think he just wants me, Jamie to be something like for real. Yeah, I think so too.
7426.54s:  I don't think because the other, the other component to this is even if there's a squeeze,
7436.94s:  he can't get out in a squeeze at the top. And I think he knows that. So even during these squeezes
7444.30s:  in these different price patterns, I don't, when you're trading a position that size,
7449.66s:  you literally run out of liquidity. So I think that there's kind of an element to the way that he
7456.78s:  has to trade things that I completely agree with you guys that he wants it to be a legitimate company.
7465.82s:  I think that without a doubt, Robo says that phrasing is so specific. It is, but again,
7473.98s:  like I think we'll listen to it again together because I think it's specific within context.
7479.82s:  And the context when he says that, he hovers his mouse over the cash position in his account.
7487.66s:  Because when he says this is my only position, he's essentially front running the statement of,
7493.66s:  oh, cash is a position. So that's why he does it. But here we go. I'll bring the audio back up.
7501.98s:  Let's kill this. And then let's let's listen together.
7506.46s:  Take, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, new positions. But, uh, hello, again, I suppose,
7512.54s:  depending on, I mean, I know there's some cash there. That's what I mean. It depends on your
7515.34s:  positions. But, uh, it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying? It's how I roll. So
7522.30s:  that's, that's out there. But I'd say that it's, uh, it's, uh, true me. I'll take, uh, so those,
7529.18s:  yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you know, about me, I'll take, uh, so,
7533.50s:  uh, cheers. I got a lot there. So those, yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you
7541.50s:  know, about me, I'll take, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a, it's a true yellow again. I suppose,
7548.22s:  it's a bit of a, I know, I know there's some cash there. That's what I mean. It depends on your
7551.10s:  positions. Right. So you, you see what I'm talking about? He says it's, these are my only
7558.14s:  positions. I know there's some cash in there. Then he talked about his choice. You know, he's like,
7564.86s:  I, I'm down to do a, a yellow, you know, unless you consider cash a position. So he's referring to
7572.38s:  the cash in this scenario, like very clearly, it looks like the, the preferences for the hat
7579.42s:  back on. So we'll suffer through it for a little longer. Um, but he's very clearly, in my opinion,
7584.62s:  referring to the cash in this account, because when he says these are my only positions,
7589.90s:  he's obviously front running the statement that a lot of people make, oh, cash is a position.
7595.26s:  So that's what I think. Um, Willie says don't blame the guy for pivoting and being more aggressive
7605.34s:  while he leave money on the table. Yeah, I agree. Completely agree.
7608.30s:  He says to As such, why do they do the job to take over the cards and rest of the cards and
7617.64s:  the cash blending doesn't really work on his and the summer and stuff. Like as you can see,
7621.38s:  bridge is great. I don't believe you could, bieei. So just believe what, um,
7625.82s:  And that's also not good to know what. Like I'm right behind it really, it's really really good,
7631.88s:  but actually, he's obviously very honest and artistic and équipmentfree.
7637.32s:  from a trader's perspective, we look at the same shit.
7641.84s:  So the way that I found this move here is the same way.
7646.04s:  It's literally the same exact way
7648.48s:  that if we go back into this move,
7652.68s:  let's grab GME,
7656.20s:  if we go back into this move,
7657.80s:  like most of us traders saw the same shit.
7661.64s:  I know I did.
7662.96s:  And I started trading the volume here,
7665.44s:  just like I started trading the volume on a bunch of other things
7668.36s:  because a lot of us traders just look for volume.
7675.12s:  So I think Burry in this case,
7677.28s:  so essentially something that was structurally overshoverted,
7682.04s:  like again, a lot of us did
7683.80s:  because that's what causes these kinds of gamma squeezes.
7687.16s:  And that's why it's important to delineate, in my opinion,
7689.80s:  from a short squeeze, from a gamma squeeze,
7692.24s:  because I think in something like this,
7694.24s:  there was a bit of a mix.
7697.44s:  Alfonso says Burry was before RK,
7699.60s:  oh, interesting, that's really good to know.
7702.44s:  That's really, really good to know.
7704.16s:  Because I think I remember him talking about Burry in one of his videos,
7707.72s:  but I didn't, I took it as he was already in the video.
7710.72s:  I didn't realize that,
7715.92s:  I'm trying to find where he talks about it.
7717.72s:  Was it a live stream maybe?
7720.88s:  Yeah, I think it's in here.
7724.24s:  Yeah, I can't remember which one.
7734.96s:  This is three years ago.
7737.68s:  Let me change the question to this.
7739.52s:  Maybe Alfonso, you can help me.
7741.92s:  When did Kitty first get into GameStop?
7747.32s:  That would help me a lot.
7748.36s:  Because I really, for whatever reason,
7750.28s:  just I took it as he was in before,
7752.44s:  because he was already covering GameStop super, super close.
7754.96s:  I think this one.
7762.52s:  Euphoria Web says, hoping a single dude will buy 9 million shares as horrible.
7766.08s:  That's not how this should move.
7767.08s:  Well, and also to be completely clear,
7771.72s:  I don't know what comment you're referring to,
7773.88s:  but it's not just him.
7776.64s:  Like his 9 million volume isn't the only thing that moves this.
7780.44s:  You need more than him, right?
7782.32s:  So for example, for this move to happen here,
7785.72s:  which was a low of 1231 to a high of 17,
7788.72s:  so a five point move, big move.
7790.88s:  But in order for this move to happen,
7792.52s:  it was 36 million shares traded.
7795.76s:  His 9 million, let's just pretend if we put all of his 9 million
7800.04s:  on a single day here, would have contributed,
7803.04s:  but you need way more volume than what Rory and Kitty can provide.
7807.48s:  So even on this move here, it's 187 million,
7811.80s:  then 206 million.
7814.04s:  So just the point I'm highlighting there is I don't, again,
7816.92s:  I'm not sure Euphoria, which comment you're referring to,
7819.84s:  but his, his volume is part of the puzzle, but it's not the puzzle.
7825.00s:  There's definitely more to it than not.
7827.68s:  Bronson says, why file 13G on chewy, but not GME?
7831.64s:  They have a very close float size.
7833.64s:  He didn't hit the threshold.
7835.00s:  Like that's what it comes down to.
7836.48s:  There's no incentive for him to file a 13G
7839.48s:  other than when he's legally required to.
7842.36s:  Oh, there's Burry right here.
7852.68s:  So, I'm trying to, there was another comment that I missed.
7857.80s:  Okay.
7860.12s:  Ape of spade says, RK by 7 June 19.
7865.96s:  Yeah.
7866.64s:  And then so we can see when did Michael.
7871.48s:  Burry, in case you're wondering if you type in the word when did Michael,
7874.68s:  the first thing that pops up is when did Michael Jackson die?
7878.84s:  When did Michael Burry buy GameStop stock?
7885.00s:  In Q4 of 2018.
7887.08s:  Yeah.
7887.56s:  So I think you guys are spot on.
7888.92s:  Yeah.
7894.68s:  I think that's exactly.
7896.20s:  I think you're your right spot on.
7898.84s:  And then before liquidating is entire stake in the third quarter of 2020.
7903.56s:  So.
7908.12s:  So it does look like based on the timelines that you gave me again,
7910.84s:  I'm not sure what they are, but I can see where Burry bought in for sure.
7914.20s:  I'm not positive where the cat.
7916.20s:  Got in, but.
7920.12s:  If it's, as you guys say, then Burry definitely would have been in before.
7923.96s:  Thank you for that.
7924.68s:  That's actually really, really helpful.
7931.64s:  Um.
7934.84s:  Rebel Darkside says, okay, what if he buys back the nine million shares that I think he sold from
7939.48s:  GME and comes back specifically with this volume more than the volume?
7942.52s:  What do you think?
7944.12s:  Um.
7946.36s:  I think a few things.
7949.24s:  I think the first thing is.
7952.92s:  If we see him unwind, his chewy position, we'll see it.
7957.88s:  And he'll also have to file.
7959.48s:  So we'll know when he does it.
7962.36s:  And if he chose to go on the open market and start getting into GameStop with that position,
7968.36s:  it's doable.
7969.88s:  But he would bid himself up so much because of how small the volume is right now.
7977.80s:  So my guess is he probably would start with options, to be honest,
7981.64s:  because if he wanted to gain nine million share exposure again and here, the total volume for
7987.32s:  again, the last five days on average is 3.7 million.
7992.36s:  So he is essentially three times that, not quite like two and a half, but still he would consume
7997.88s:  all of the volume himself.
7999.16s:  He would bid himself up sky high.
8002.04s:  So in that case, what I imagine he would do is use options to start bringing volume into the stock.
8010.60s:  And then as volume comes into the stock, he could start accumulating.
8014.60s:  But I don't think he's going to come into something like this and then just decide on,
8019.48s:  you know, the 26th of August, the buy nine million shares or nine million one thousand shares
8025.88s:  because he's going to murder himself just trying to get a fill on that.
8029.56s:  It's going to be a completely one-sided market at that point.
8033.56s:  And he's going to be front running himself to the negative side.
8036.92s:  It wouldn't be useful.
8039.00s:  So before you said, all is that assuming he doesn't own GME currently?
8042.84s:  Well, I wouldn't say that.
8044.52s:  I think that it's reasonable for us to assume he doesn't own as big of a GME position.
8050.36s:  Now again, based on the math, the quick math that we did earlier,
8055.08s:  he would need like $230 million ish in order for him to put on his Chewy position, 230.
8062.20s:  So if he has $230 million that's committed to Chewy based on the 13G filing,
8067.56s:  which again, we can see that.
8069.48s:  Then in this case, it leaves him with 30 mil ish.
8073.64s:  So what he's doing with that 30 mil, I don't know.
8077.16s:  Does that mean that he has some style of a position in GME?
8080.76s:  I don't know.
8081.64s:  Does that mean that it's sitting in cash?
8083.48s:  Again, I have no idea.
8085.40s:  But what I do know is based on this last screenshot in the overwhelming likelihood,
8092.20s:  again, just based on the breadth of evidence in front of us, it does look like it's highly likely,
8097.32s:  highly likely that he unwound the majority of this GME position to move into Chewy.
8103.80s:  And then whatever he's doing with the residual, I have no idea.
8108.52s:  But it only he does until he posts another yellow update or kind of gives some sort of hints.
8115.48s:  I don't think there's a way for us to definitively know.
8118.52s:  Now, one of the interesting things here is Newton pointed out to me in one of the live streams
8123.08s:  that we did together that he's never decreased his position size before in GameStop,
8127.72s:  at least in the updates that he's shown.
8130.52s:  But we don't really know about that either because there's a lot of periods that are not captured
8135.64s:  that we haven't seen.
8138.12s:  But I think it's a fair assumption to make on Newton's behalf.
8141.40s:  Now, this was on the 13th of June.
8144.04s:  So,
8146.04s:  the SpostCars says, what about leveraging his GME shares? I don't think they offer you margin on GME.
8152.76s:  So, yeah, I don't think there's leverage available to him and I don't think he can buy Chewy on margin either.
8164.76s:  That's the brokers protecting themselves. And I actually, I kind of get that because if you're a broker,
8170.36s:  you take on a massive, massive amount of this risk.
8175.56s:  Before he says, okay, so what if he sold some of his shares when they were much higher? Yeah,
8180.36s:  let's take a look at that example. So, this was on the 13th of June.
8185.08s:  So, if we look at GameStop from June 13th, which is here, that's the peak.
8194.68s:  Like, it wasn't higher after that.
8197.56s:  So, it's a good question, but again,
8202.28s:  yeah, it doesn't line up at least with the performance of GameStop.
8208.36s:  Bifi says you would never cash out GME for Chewy. Yeah, I mean, you're entitled to think that and I get it.
8214.04s:  And I understand that a lot of people feel that way. So, yeah, I would never tell you either way because
8223.00s:  I don't know. But what I do know again is that as of the 13th of June, his account value is 268
8230.28s:  mill and his Chewy position, 9 million 1000 shares likely takes at the very least 230 mill.
8238.76s:  So, yeah. And again, in that live stream that we saw together, this one that again, you should
8247.56s:  check out for sure this one here. And you can see the time hack. It's kind of like towards the
8254.44s:  latter 60 percent of the video. He says he talks about this and he says it's his only account, his
8260.28s:  only positions. So, I think what he showed us here is what he had. And I think that again,
8272.04s:  in my opinion, just looking at it objectively, not what I want the cat to do, not what I hope somebody
8279.08s:  else might have done, but just looking at the evidence as best as an objectively as I possibly can.
8285.00s:  To me, it looks like it's far more likely that he closed the meaningful portion of GME here.
8292.44s:  And then likely bought into Chewy. Again, whether he flattened totally, I don't know. He definitely
8298.92s:  would have money left over to maintain a position in here. It just wouldn't be 9 million 1000 shares.
8304.76s:  The other thing that I consider with this specific scenario is what's the probability that
8315.16s:  he has options involved. And I've been trying to keep a really close eye on that. And because that's
8322.04s:  that is my wheelhouse, that I feel supremely confident in my ability to connect to dots.
8327.40s:  Is compared to most of this other stuff where I'm just kind of reasoning through it as best I can.
8332.76s:  But I haven't seen anything resembling like 30 million dollar style positions. So he could,
8340.68s:  but he might be trading a little bit smaller. So yeah.
8352.76s:  Chris says if he can remove that he trade logo, he can remove the rest of the info or change it.
8357.16s:  Yeah, he could. And again, it just depends on how you want to interpret his messaging.
8363.16s:  Right? Like I believe him. I take him at his work when he says, you know, this is my account.
8368.20s:  These are my positions. I take him at his word. If he has other stuff somewhere else, we have
8373.80s:  absolutely no idea. But I think that he also understood that talking about it in that context
8381.00s:  really was about trust, I think. So yeah, I mean, I take him at his word personally.
8387.56s:  But I wouldn't feel any type of way about somebody that says like, oh, I think he has other accounts
8394.68s:  or other positions like I could totally see that too. Again, in an objective landscape,
8399.72s:  the way the way that I arrive at my opinion is just at what I can make the best inferences off of.
8407.56s:  Not what I hope happens, not what I prefer to happen, but what I can try and objectively connect
8415.24s:  dots to. That's the way I look at it personally.
8422.12s:  Willie says there's bulls, there's bears, and then there's cats. Yeah, that's awesome. That's so awesome.
8430.52s:  Ricky says Martin Screly says Kitty's positions are probably Photoshopped. I don't trust Martin
8436.84s:  Screly as far as I can throw them. And again, I, if nothing else with somebody like the cat,
8444.92s:  I do believe what he says, like I trust him. The reason why I trust him is that he has absolutely
8451.24s:  no incentive to lie to people. He at the start of this, even before all of this madness started,
8459.24s:  right? Like, let's go when he came back here in two June, he already had $210 million.
8468.68s:  That is the ultimate fuck you money. That is never need anything ever again, level of money.
8477.40s:  So I think that there's no reason for him the cat to come on a live stream or to come back and
8486.12s:  start bullshitting or fabricating these positions. Like I just don't see any incentive here for him
8491.64s:  at all to do that. Even if we take it a step further and go back to his final update,
8497.00s:  he had $35 million. That's still fuck you money. That is still rest of my lifetime and likely the
8506.36s:  airs to him because I know that he has a family. I think he has a daughter. Like they're good forever.
8513.00s:  They they're completely good. So I just don't see somebody with a massive incentive to come out
8520.12s:  here and start bullshitting. Now, Fanzo says what puzzles me is about R.K. entering Chewie is that
8528.12s:  Chewie is controlled by Pet Smart who own the vote for the Class B shares. They can do whatever they
8535.72s:  want at any time. Yeah, I agree. And I think kind of to some of the chat's point, I think part of the
8541.72s:  reason at least the only connection I can find is Collins connection to it. I think if Chewie
8554.52s:  wasn't associated to Cohen, I don't think he would have put a position on it personally.
8560.52s:  I think a big reason why he did it is because he's just kind of trolling a little bit. He's having
8564.76s:  fun. He has fuck you money and he's playing fuck you games with his fuck you money as he should.
8572.76s:  So yeah, Robo says it's an all-time lows R.K. is a deep value investor. He says he used to be.
8581.32s:  I don't I don't think that he would identify as that anymore to be honest because I wish I
8586.44s:  have to find that for you guys. I have to figure out which which video it's from. Let me see.
8594.76s:  3000.
8599.40s:  All right, come across a new stock. I had it to the list. It doesn't happen often but I'm excited.
8603.88s:  I'm excited when I come across a new one. What I've noticed too, I used to, I'm not this
8608.52s:  list. I don't have a gold book. So so many times fall off and get ahead on it because I'm like murderers
8611.32s:  and acquisitions and stuff and get bought out and like if you do it manually, you need to do like
8613.80s:  clean up stuff. And so even the number of companies has always changed. But anyway, so this is the
8616.60s:  universe. The universe is based on this database of stocks at the DB and you should see more than
8619.48s:  3.423. You see 3.443. This is I made some modifications recently to streamline the process a little bit.
8624.12s:  So yeah, I have to find the spot because I don't want to waste your guys his time and kind of have
8628.52s:  to go through the entire video. But he he talks about his pivot in terms of his investing style,
8635.72s:  which I do find to be really really interesting personally. But yeah, I mean the whole the whole
8643.40s:  backdrop here is beyond fascinating to me. And the pivot into chewy to me more than anything seems
8651.88s:  like a salute to Cohen because not only did he get into chewy, but he also got in at 9 million
8659.64s:  1000 shares. So with that, I think that that's like really, really specific gestures. Just like when
8668.92s:  he got into GameStop and he did 9 million 1000 shares, right? It's a very purposeful number. He's
8673.88s:  not just kind of picking a number. In all of those positions, his account can handle more. So he's
8682.44s:  stopping at those at very specific for very specific reasons. Willie says, don't forget,
8690.52s:  GME and Chewy are an XRT might not be relevant though. Yeah, I mean, it's a fair call out. I don't
8695.48s:  necessarily think that that matters a whole bunch. But yeah, I agree with you. I think it's important
8701.00s:  to know.
8705.16s:  Alfonso says a Roth that has a 37 year old, he can grow for another 22 years before he can
8713.72s:  visit spaceship or he can buy a spaceship. Yeah, that's hilarious. Yeah, the whole thing man is just
8722.76s:  it's a giant riddle to me. It's so cool.
8728.60s:  Gravitara said, did we ever reverse engineer the interest payment, DFC, DV received? Yeah, I think
8734.68s:  we did at some point. I don't remember. Yeah, I don't remember.
8742.04s:  Yeah, I'm trying to like I was trying to recollect, but I can't remember what we arrived at. It's
8756.28s:  obviously not enough for him to maintain both positions that I know definitively. At least just from
8763.64s:  the, I got to take the hat off, man, it's so hot in there. It's like in case you guys didn't know,
8769.64s:  tinfoil hats don't breathe. I'm pretty sure my Kevlar helmet breathes more than that.
8786.28s:  But yeah, it wasn't enough because I know one of the other things that Newton was postulating is
8791.80s:  like, yo, maybe he traded enough options essentially to double his portfolio in the time frame from
8798.84s:  here to when he filed for Chewie and I just, I just don't see, I just don't see that. I don't see
8805.64s:  that at all. Apospeite says then take your shirt off. That's funny because if you don't know for a lot
8811.64s:  of my OG live streams, they were shirtless, especially if it's like during the summer earlier in
8816.04s:  the day when it's kind of hot, we're lazy now. We just run the AC whenever we're even remotely
8822.52s:  uncomfortable. We're very, very, we're too comfortable now. But yeah, I used to do a lot of
8828.60s:  live streams without the shirt on because absolutely when it's too hot, we pop the tarps, man,
8835.56s:  much easier that way. Ricky says Eric just lost 50% of his power when he took off the tin. Yeah,
8841.08s:  I think that's about right. I think I lose that. And then I mean, God forbid, I lost the beard at
8846.84s:  the same time. I could just imagine this, this herniated disc would probably have me curl up in a
8851.80s:  fetal position where it's like right now I can still fight it a little bit, but I would completely
8857.40s:  be screwed without it for sure. Anything else that we want to take a quick look at
8866.52s:  before I hop off and go stuff my fat face with some barbecue? Really, really fun session. I mean,
8874.44s:  there was like a hundred people in here, which is incredible. I love an opportunity to connect with
8879.00s:  you guys and take a look at the stock. Learn more about it myself. Hopefully share a little bit about it
8885.56s:  if, um, if I can, the problem is right now with something like GameStop. It's just so range bound.
8895.88s:  Maybe that's what we can take a look at for the last couple of minutes here. It's just where we're
8899.72s:  at now. I think that makes sense. So when I look at GameStop where it sits, I mean,
8909.24s:  it's, it's been very, very healthily consolidating, which I love. That's really good to see. And
8920.12s:  the other thing I really like to see here is when if we take a look at this time frame,
8926.04s:  essentially from the fifth of aug, and we take a look at what something like IWM did in some of
8932.68s:  these days, specifically like the seventh, if we take a look at the seventh here, GameStop had
8940.20s:  a down day, but minimally so compared to the broader Russell, which is great. That shows me that
8946.60s:  it's a little bit more resistant to the broad index, which is great. Now, what I don't love
8953.00s:  is that the Russell, essentially from the fifteenth all the way through the 23rd has been rallying
8959.64s:  pretty consistently. And I don't love that essentially GameStop is going the opposite direction,
8967.08s:  not by much, but it's curling down in that same reference time frame. So I don't, I don't love
8976.20s:  that just from the context of like the broader index supporting the movement. I just, I really
8982.04s:  wanted to see GameStop participates just a little bit more because when the broader index is down,
8988.92s:  it doesn't surprise me not to see much activity in GameStop or other sub components. Like that's
8993.72s:  very normal. That's okay. But when the broader index starts to show signs of life, I would want to
9000.52s:  see some of that make its way into GameStop, which we just unfortunately didn't fully see materialize
9012.20s:  here. So I think leading into earnings, it looks pretty quiet. Don Nott says, what would happen
9022.04s:  to Siri options when the ticker is merged? Yeah. So to dovetail off of that super fast,
9028.12s:  essentially they'll be adjusted. They won't offer new ones. And then they will make any, depending
9034.92s:  on how they choose to consolidate them, they'll adjust the options as needed. So
9045.48s:  but yeah, anyways, back to this generally sideways, not a ton to look at. Volume has been relatively
9055.24s:  anemic. And when I look at the options, it's super, super quiet. Just on a relative basis,
9067.88s:  this is about as quiet as it gets in here. So that matters to me just because when I'm looking for
9075.16s:  overall activity in a product, I typically scan both the options chain and then the stock itself.
9082.04s:  And when I'm looking at this, I'm just not seeing a ton for me to like really latch onto.
9088.76s:  So it just seems quiet. That's the way I'm perceiving it. And when I perceive something as quiet,
9094.28s:  it means that I look at it, but I don't have a bunch of positions on in here right now,
9099.24s:  which leaves me at risk. If there's a giant gap, I wouldn't participate. But as a trader,
9105.00s:  and I always emphasize the point as a trader, because the reason why I think it's important for
9109.88s:  you guys to hear that is because it gives you some context into the way that I'm thinking about
9115.08s:  this and the way that I'm playing it and why I'm playing it like that. And that's the main thing.
9120.36s:  Like as a trader, I need to position myself where things are moving. And right now, it looks really
9126.52s:  quiet. So I'm generally expecting it to remain quiet into earnings unless there's new news that
9133.16s:  breaks in some capacity. But there's just not a ton of it just yet. So I'm continuing to cover it
9141.40s:  as I do my daily update videos with you all because I kind of said I would. And that's the primary
9147.32s:  reason because again, a lot of the update videos I'm doing my best to identify little things here
9152.44s:  and there. Right now, the biggest thing that I find so interesting is that the earnings volume
9160.28s:  for the earnings volatility for that expiration cycle is so low. That's fascinating because
9167.08s:  I have no idea why it would be this low compared to the next expiration cycle because the next
9173.16s:  expiration cycle is also a weekly expiration. So this I still postulate will expand. I actually
9180.92s:  traded the original expansion and I got out of it pretty fast because it stopped expanding.
9186.36s:  And I thought it was going to expand more and then it chilled out. So I mean, I was really
9193.24s:  surprised by that. And then I was equally more surprised by the contraction in volatility here.
9198.76s:  But I'm keeping an eye on it because my broader expectation based on just how these things
9203.88s:  typically move, I would anticipate this expanding, the 75% volatility for earnings to expand. But
9211.96s:  not not quite not quite seeing it yet. And the other thing really quick is when I looked at the
9219.08s:  volume, it looked like for the call side, most of the volume appeared to be closing front
9225.56s:  positions and then moving into just the following week, which is very standard fare for GameStop
9233.16s:  maintaining that front expiration cycle exposure. So if we take a look at the 30-odg, there's 70,000
9239.96s:  options there or call specific I should say, there's only 30 for earnings, which is crazy.
9246.76s:  Then there's only 12 and 13-step and then 63. So you can see as per usual, we stay way, way,
9255.24s:  more centralized for GameStop specifically in the front expiration. But right now, it's just
9260.92s:  pretty, pretty light. Alfonso says at some point, please leave Chimie in the past if it remains
9267.56s:  stagnant, pretty please. So many more worthy tickers, definitely. And that's why the other thing
9274.12s:  that you'll notice on the daily updates I do, I don't, while it's quiet in GameStop, I don't just
9279.24s:  look at GameStop. I make sure I am looking at other stuff for you guys for that exact reason.
9284.52s:  So I completely, completely agree with you. But in the near term here, I'll continue to cover
9291.72s:  GameStop on the daily basis because there's no reason really not too, because I'm still fascinated by
9297.32s:  and the story and whatnot. I mean, I'll be honest, if we go like six months and the behavior is
9303.72s:  that is, is as it is, I probably would decrease the daily update for GameStop and still probably
9310.60s:  do it like weekly or something. I don't know, I kind of, I don't plan this shit out. I just kind of
9314.12s:  do it as it goes. But that's exactly why in this case, I try to do both. Right. So when I'm doing
9322.20s:  my daily update videos, I'll find whatever else looks interesting. I'm trying to keep it to
9327.08s:  two items because what I was doing for a little bit is like a broad market update. And I don't
9332.68s:  think a lot of people really cared about that. And that's okay. So I'm trying to pick like two more
9337.88s:  specific things to focus on. And then when I'm doing the live streams, you know, whether it's the
9343.16s:  on the YouTube channel largely or if it's for the Patreon folks, I'm doing more of like a broad
9350.04s:  market analysis overview and stuff like that. Robo says, what time flames do you typically trade?
9355.80s:  Anything from like zero DTE, dates to expiration out to, I don't know, long term holding for me
9364.52s:  might be like a month, maybe two months. Like those are fairly long term. And then the majority
9373.56s:  of my trades are probably two weeks that I hold something like that. Roy said this is exactly what
9380.04s:  market makers want investors to grow a board of GME. That's why we see this dip down now,
9384.68s:  rounding pattern exact. I wouldn't attribute that to the market makers just to be clear.
9390.68s:  The market makers want you to trade. That's how they make their money. I just think it's important
9395.48s:  to not turn the market makers into some sort of like boogie man that's trying to screw everybody
9401.96s:  because the way that market makers make their money is by making markets which requires people.
9409.32s:  That's not to say that they can't be shady or do shady things or play games.
9414.36s:  But in the process of market making, they need to, yeah, they need people.
9426.04s:  Baytos says, personally, I wouldn't trust a recap from someone who got bored on GME and dipped.
9430.92s:  Fair weather analysis is typically untrustworthy. Yeah, I mean, that's totally fair.
9436.28s:  For me, it's, again, I try to be completely straightforward with you guys on what my incentives are
9442.52s:  and what I do. I'm a trader. So because I'm a trader, I need things to move around. It's how I
9450.76s:  make money. It's literally my livelihood. So yeah, I don't think that there's any issue with your
9458.60s:  opinion, Beto. But yeah, for me, I've been trading. This is my 17th year of trading and it's not
9466.84s:  just been GameStop. It will never just be GameStop for me. GameStop is part of my book.
9472.12s:  And what I like to do, and again, I've already told you I'm infatuated with the story. But
9478.04s:  I got a trade, man, it's what I do. So that means I have to look for things that are moving.
9483.80s:  And I've spent my entire trading career looking at lots of stuff. So yeah, this show.
9492.44s:  Beto says, always trust original sources and DD authors themselves. I think that's smart. Yeah,
9500.04s:  especially with understanding the hypothesis.
9506.44s:  I think with the due diligence itself, there's something to be said about somebody like Newton
9514.12s:  who spends a lot of time like collating different sources and understanding them. I think that's
9519.48s:  really important for somebody to collate ideas. But yeah, I think that it's much more
9525.64s:  efficacious to look at the actual source itself. I think that that's a completely fair
9531.00s:  fair idea. Robo said, could GME have sold all 125 million shares to the market makers?
9537.64s:  Now market makers are dispersing it over keeping price stagnant to mitigate flooding the market?
9544.04s:  I don't see that's one of the great questions that we didn't really get a chance to talk about
9548.68s:  today. Maybe I'll add that to the agenda for the next one, which is like,
9553.00s:  it's a great, like, where the fuck are the shares? Because I don't know. And I don't really know
9559.96s:  where, yeah, like I don't know. And it's definitely a pretty big question I have. Because
9565.64s:  like, I would have expected to see like more clear filings from people flowing in. But yeah,
9572.12s:  I'm taking a note now. And we can take a closer look at it because,
9580.12s:  yeah, I'm very curious where the shares are. Now, what I can tell you is that the short
9585.48s:  flow has gone down massively. So I'm sure a ton of shorts use that to cover. But,
9594.92s:  yeah, I am unsure where they went.
9599.32s:  Hooked on options says, do you do live streams during the trading day? Not usually. I would be
9603.24s:  down to in the future. But right now, I typically, well, I just keep a regular cadence. So I do live
9610.60s:  streams at 5 p.m. Pacific time every day. And I just do 5 p.m. because I think for a lot of people
9616.28s:  that work, you know, for a living, it's easier for them to catch up with the live streams when
9620.84s:  they're not working. But in the future, I might start doing like multiple live streams a day. I
9626.60s:  really love live streams. I like interacting with you live. It's way more engaging for me. As you
9631.48s:  could tell from my videos, like I don't like making videos. I like sharing information. And I like
9637.00s:  sharing as much of my skill set and experience as I possibly can. But I don't like making, you know,
9643.56s:  super beautiful, well-crafted videos. It's just not my skill set. It's not my passion. I'm way more
9650.92s:  function over form in that sense. And I care a lot about the skill set and the practical
9657.88s:  application of trading because I got introduced to this through a mentor. And then I found another
9663.80s:  mentor and I just had I've had a lot of people help me directly or indirectly throughout the path.
9669.24s:  And I think that it's massively important to try to share your skill set whatever it is with
9675.96s:  other people. So yeah, that's why it's structured the way it is now, but always open to another
9682.28s:  approach. Willey says personally, towards short interest being covered from a mathematical
9687.48s:  perspective, the price did not spike to the degree of the massive short position.
9691.72s:  Trading was even halted. Yeah, because I do agree. I think we can objectively see
9696.44s:  that short interest contracted pretty massively following the offering. So I think that that
9700.68s:  makes sense. Apospeite says, Willey, then why all the effort and money spent bashing GME? Because,
9708.44s:  oh, not to answer for Willey, but my guess is that there are still shorts that are stuck in there.
9713.48s:  I still don't think everybody closed out from the original squeeze. And I think that a lot of them
9720.20s:  were turned into convertibles or swaps that are very difficult to track because they can continue
9725.64s:  to be modified and perpetuated. And I think that there's also probably a significant cohort of people
9733.80s:  that are hoping that GME goes bankrupt so that they can take their shorts down and not pay any taxes
9740.68s:  on it. Like there are probably people hanging out like vultures, hoping that this thing fails,
9745.64s:  which is the ugliest thing. I hate that. The prospect of banking and on other people's failure
9753.08s:  just sucks. I think that that is un-American at best, but I think that it's just a terrible
9759.80s:  mindset to have. It's what a shitty place to be in your life. If that's what you're hoping for,
9764.68s:  other people to fail, that just sucks. But I think ape of spades, that would be my guess
9772.04s:  why there's a lot of people spending money to try to continue to suppress it. So.
9780.36s:  All right, gang, time for me to go stuff my fat face. Absolutely. Awesome time catching up.
9786.20s:  We'll do another one of these probably next Saturday. Just kind of keep the cadence going for
9789.64s:  the GME specific one. And yeah, as always, if you guys need anything, just hit me up.
9794.28s:  I will see you all around on the other live streams or in the discord, be an outlier. I'll see
9798.68s:  you guys later.
