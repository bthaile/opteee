0.00s: Everyone, Eric here wanted to do a quick update on the small stack portfolio.
6.00s: Made a trade earlier this week. I started building out my Excel tracker for it,
10.50s: which I'll share going forward. But for now, I just jotted it on the page here.
16.34s: So let's take a look. So still out right now with the two October 24 puts.
23.70s: I traded those for 50 cents.
26.70s: They're essentially trading at value right now with XLF kind of still drift and sideways.
34.20s: I am happy to see price above the 200 day moving average.
39.00s: Now I do want to see the 50 cross above that, but that's just, you know,
43.00s: longer term thing right now. There's nothing to be done in the trade.
45.80s: Just leave it on. We're still 28 days to expiration.
50.50s: Next up is Zinga. So in there, I sold the nine October eight and a half put.
57.90s: So let's take a look at Zinga right now. They're trading at eight, seven, five.
62.00s: I'm still down here. So I'm comfortable with where I'm at.
65.40s: This is a trade that I will roll if I need to, but still plenty of time left on the table.
71.20s: So again, another trade that I don't really need to make an adjustment in it.
76.80s: And I do not intend to now the one that I did make a couple trades in is broker.
85.60s: So in here, I established a leap diagonal earlier this week.
91.00s: And it's because I like the product in general.
94.50s: And I thought that it offered some good exposure and a great return on capital.
100.70s: So I ended up buying one of the 16 April 21 29 calls at $8.42.
108.70s: And I sold one of the 11 September 37 calls at a dollar six.
113.20s: Now I always talk about wanting to sell at a ratio if I can, but, you know, it's a smaller account.
118.90s: So in this scenario, I wasn't able to sell at a ratio, which is completely okay.
125.00s: I still structure the trade mining my deltas so that I do not have upside risk.
131.80s: That remains to be super important to me.
135.30s: So actually today.
139.50s: I ended up taking the trade down.
141.70s: So I closed out those 37 calls.
144.20s: I paid 42 cents for it.
146.00s: So I realized a profit of 64 bucks.
149.60s: And then I laid out the 25 September 36 and a half calls.
156.30s: And I collected $1.16.
158.80s: So that will take me through earnings, unless I could take it off before earnings, which if I can,
163.60s: I will take it again, probably a little more, you know, 55, 60% profit.
169.40s: And then see what else is out there.
171.50s: So for current portfolio stats were, you know, I'm still considering it 5,000.
178.60s: Whereas technically it is 5,064, including that recent gain.
184.40s: But I'll start to calculate that probably on a monthly aggregate basis.
189.40s: The allocation currently is $4,092.
193.70s: So that's about 82% utilized.
196.70s: Realized PNL is 64 bucks, which is a 1.3% return on the portfolio.
202.40s: That was in three days.
203.80s: So obviously happy with that return.
207.50s: And then the credit outstanding is $193.
211.60s: That represents 3.9% of the portfolio.
216.40s: Now one adjustment I do intend to make going forward is
221.10s: if I can close out of XLF for a profit instead of taking assignment on it,
227.40s: which includes, you know, rolling, I likely will take that down and put on another leap in favor of it.
235.40s: And the reason for that is the $50 is fine.
240.30s: But I don't want to tie up the $2,400 in the trade.
244.20s: I laid it out there because it's a sector ETF.
247.20s: I'm okay with the risk.
248.40s: And if I end up taking ownership of it, I'm fine with it.
252.80s: But I would prefer to get into a leap instead.
256.90s: So that I can kind of enjoy some of the increased volatility we're seeing.
262.10s: And pretty much increase the efficiency of the account because the broker-leaped diagonal right now is absolutely outperforming everything.
273.50s: It's, you know, over a 12% return on invested capital.
277.50s: Whereas, you know, XLF and Zingo both are a bit lower than that.
282.70s: But I will definitely make sure I maintain at least one coverage strangle in the account.
290.50s: And once I can take Zingo down, I will still look for some sort of sector ETF ETF in general.
298.20s: I am convicted in that simply because I want the reduction in unsystemic risk.
307.20s: So then once that's set up, I will probably maintain that one core holding in some sort of index ETF or sector ETF.
315.20s: And then I am looking to have on probably two leaps at the same time, making sure I leave room to scale in.
321.40s: So for Kruger, I allocated $1,500 to that trade.
326.00s: And right now we're using $842 of those dollars, which I'm completely okay with.
332.10s: That is a very reasonable return.
335.30s: So fine with that.
337.10s: However, that's really the beauty of leaps is to be able to efficiently get a decent return on your capital.
345.40s: And once I can scale into these positions, I will make sure I continue to sell at a ratio so that I also do not cap my upside.
354.20s: So I wanted to walk through another diagonal that I'm eyeing for the small stacks portfolio.
362.20s: And that is Pfizer PFE.
366.10s: So what I'm eyeing in here is something out in 16 July, 21, probably the 28 calls.
376.40s: Those are trading at around $9 and it's 83 delta.
380.40s: And then I would sell to October 36 and a half call against it.
385.40s: So the reason why I like this trade one, I like Pfizer a lot where it is.
389.50s: I also think that it's a very solid return on invested capital to $900 trade to open up and I would collect 128 on the short call.
399.70s: So it's a 14% return on invested capital over the course of 28 days.
404.50s: If I hold to expiration now part of that is because there is earnings coming up the 27th of next month, which is totally fine.
412.10s: Not worried about that.
414.00s: And the thing with Pfizer that I enjoy, obviously is they're working on their COVID cure.
421.40s: So I like the involvement there.
423.90s: I would like to see it come down just a little bit more, which may adjust the trade a bit.
429.20s: But I am going to target an entry between 35 and 36 somewhere in there.
438.10s: So I'm kind of holding off waiting for that.
440.40s: Now if I do see a good trade in there.
443.30s: I will take it even before I have the trades in Excel F off.
453.30s: And the reason why I'm doing that is because I have room in the portfolio.
457.80s: Yes, I will be near max allocated and it will reduce my position and Kruger.
463.10s: My max position and Kruger.
464.50s: But that's again, one of the trifles with smaller portfolios is working through those decisions.
472.10s: So this is where we're at currently.
475.20s: Obviously I'll take a look at the Pfizer trade, see if that materialized this for me.
479.80s: As always, if anybody's any questions or any comments that they want to work through,
483.70s: feel free to let me know and I will catch you all later.
