688.00s:  comments. Here it goes. I was going to say it cannot be this terrible. See, that's the
699.20s:  thing is you have to go to something that calls ad comments as compared to like view comments
703.44s:  which is stupid. That Lawrence has stopped trusting people. You know, it's the pee didn't
713.96s:  make me super nervous because I figured that it was some sort of print hot key. I didn't
720.68s:  know what it was, but yeah, I know how people can play on the inner webs. All right, so
727.88s:  this is where we left off slimy. So how do I delete this? That's beautiful. And let's get
734.92s:  into this is how the cards part three. All right, here we go. So we already know that there's
742.44s:  instances where short interest is understated and we know that short interest has exceeded.
749.32s:  Total float. We know this. We know that companies have been misreporting their short interest.
757.40s:  This is also. Lauren says we don't do new things and we don't trust people. Got it. Lauren,
765.80s:  I'm actually going to start. I'm actually going to start to use that as my ritual before I come
773.00s:  on the live streams is don't trust anybody but Lauren and don't do new things. That's what we
781.24s:  got to do. All right. Yes, we know this when the SEC relies on reports that broker dealers provide
790.20s:  Finra takes years to reveal the lies within these reports. This is a little inflammatory.
795.00s:  Have to be honest. I understand. I understand what they're saying, but I do think it's
804.52s:  a little more inflammatory than it probably needs to be. By the way, what color highlight do you
809.08s:  guys like? You like like traditional yellow? What's your vibe for the highlights? This is too dark
815.80s:  of a yellow, I think. Oh, no, that's okay. That looks like a nice yellow. I can do this orange
823.88s:  in Solomon orange. Who uses orange for highlighting? Really?
832.12s:  That just looks weird. I don't know about no orange highlights. Y'all. All right. Fine. Let's
837.96s:  I'm a man of the people. I'll put it to a fucking poll. Highlight color.
848.52s:  There's going to be a lot of shit that we have to highlight together yellow. Orange.
854.12s:  Definitely not blue. Blue is not a choice here. I don't fuck with blue like that.
858.04s:  What are the choices do we have? We got lilac, light purple, light purple.
871.08s:  Let's see what you guys pick. Whatever you guys pick, that's what I'll use.
877.16s:  I guess there's green. Fuck. I forgot to add green, whatever.
884.44s:  Right now we're 57 orange.
890.60s:  Which I mean, to be honest, it kind of makes sense, right? Because I always rock with the
897.72s:  Mandarin orange or the mango orange. I guess that actually makes sense.
907.08s:  All right. 50% orange. We'll call it done there. So it shall be orange. It is.
913.64s:  Do we like dark orange or light orange? This is the light orange.
918.92s:  That's the dark orange.
925.80s:  It shall be orange. Feel like the orange is the right one. Yeah. Okay. Agreed.
930.60s:  Feel like this is the correct choice. All right. Awesome.
935.72s:  Let's continue.
937.24s:  You.
939.96s:  Broke a dealer can lie without immediately facing the consequences. Again,
944.84s:  so here's the thing. One of the things to highlight on a side. When we're looking at this is my
954.92s:  approach to analyzing stuff is genuinely to try and remain as objective as humanly possible.
962.44s:  Like that is exactly what I try to do. The problem that I take with the word lie here is that it
969.96s:  paints a picture holistically that the reporting is being purposefully misreported by everybody
978.28s:  across the board into perpetuity. And that might just be the general inference. And I'm not saying
984.68s:  whether that's right or wrong. But for me, I would frame it more as like misreporting, whether it's
991.32s:  driven by purposeful intent. That's something that we would get into in specific instances.
996.52s:  But there is a reality that a lot of these institutions do have massive reporting functions.
1004.44s:  And it's not always perfect. Look at any job you've ever worked at and look at the required
1011.32s:  paperwork following filing process. It's never perfect. There's always errors. So all I'm saying is
1018.44s:  that I wouldn't feel comfortable chalking up the reporting always forever unanimously across all
1025.64s:  instances being lies, being purposefully done is that the majority of cases. I don't know. Maybe
1033.40s:  it definitely seems like it's known in certain circumstances without a fucking doubt. So I'm not
1038.76s:  saying that there's not lying going on. There absolutely seems to be. But I try to emphasize
1046.76s:  that point specifically. Rointitty, hey, what up? Rointitty. Rointitty says,
1051.88s:  GME is a shit ton of errors over and over and over again. Here's the problem.
1056.28s:  If you are to look around, have you ever had this sensation while you're driving?
1063.24s:  You just get a new car or maybe you got a used car and your car is white. Or if you watch
1069.40s:  Family Guy and you like cool whip, it's white. And as you're driving around all of a sudden you
1077.40s:  start seeing all these white cars. You're like, where the fuck did all of these white cars come
1084.20s:  from? They're everywhere. I've never seen as many white cars in my life. I just got a white car.
1089.24s:  Everybody obviously is just vibing with me in my white car. You know exactly what that is.
1095.88s:  Right. It's an attribution that mentally happens when you pick something of interest and you begin
1105.16s:  looking for it. You have a white car. You like white cars. You just bought your white car.
1110.36s:  Everybody now is a white car. So with GameStop, I notice that the default everybody has is that
1118.60s:  everything is fucked. It's all manipulated. This is all being done on purpose. And it's because
1124.28s:  they're clearly our instances that it has happened. I'm not saying that it's not the case.
1131.48s:  It could be the case for sure. It could be. But what I'm saying is with especially the GameStop
1137.08s:  crowd, the default that we tend to see is manipulation is lies is stuff like that because it's
1146.28s:  what we're looking for. Fun fact, if you go into any other stock, you will find some of these
1154.04s:  same things, not saying the same exact things, not saying to the same degree. I'm not saying
1158.28s:  anything like that. What I'm saying is that if you look at Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo magically
1164.92s:  opens up new accounts for people that don't exist. It's complete and utter bullshit.
1171.48s:  There are other instances where Wells Fargo was thought to have opened up bullshit accounts
1177.80s:  for people. They were starting to become ostracized for it. And then after an external audit,
1183.00s:  it actually turned out that they didn't do it. So it's just important to try to remain objective
1190.84s:  when we're trying to read this information because it is subconsciously going to skew our
1198.84s:  further analysis in our understanding as we progress along. So I go into that whole tirade just
1208.28s:  to highlight the term lies here. I think starts to send people down a certain mental path inherently.
1216.20s:  And you should just be aware of it. You could fully agree with it. That's cool. But a lot of people
1220.92s:  they'll just read this stuff. They'll take it as face value. They'll say, oh, yeah, these
1225.56s:  motherfuckers are purposely lying to us all the time. And that's now the base going forward.
1231.08s:  And it should be a conscious choice if that's what you choose to believe. If you choose not too
1236.76s:  to side, you still have made a choice. What is that? I think that's a that's a rush song. I think it's
1243.80s:  a rush song. Let's go. The broker dealer can lie without immediately facing consequences,
1252.04s:  which we saw. And here's another thing to highlight in addition to this realistically.
1257.32s:  The fact that the consequences aren't that fucking bad. Right? So I think in the last DD,
1263.56s:  this is what yeah, these we were, I was on my little tiny setup. So it's hard for me to read all the
1268.44s:  the details. But I mean, the penalties are fucking jokes. Even a $600,000 fine, that sounds
1277.88s:  kind of aggro. But for somebody like Goldman Sachs, it's a cost to do a business dog. They don't
1285.24s:  even fucking care. So another thing to highlight is not just the immediacy component, which is there,
1291.00s:  but there's the severity component, which is the punishment is so non-severe that why would they
1296.92s:  care? They don't care. It allows firms to operate in a high risk environment without exposing how big
1303.40s:  their risk appetite is. Another example, West mentioned Merrill Lynch, find 450K in 16 for
1309.72s:  using securities held in their customers accounts to cover their own trades. That's fine.
1320.20s:  I need to click into this. Yeah, this looks okay. Run it.
1333.56s:  Let's see. Now for a quick highlight, sometimes people will ask me like, Eric, why have you become so
1347.64s:  obsessed and spend so much time looking at GameStop? And I've given the reason a bunch of different
1353.96s:  times. But I want to highlight a specific element of that because if you were to post on a place
1363.00s:  like X and if you were to post, do you think Merrill Lynch is doing this? Most people would probably say,
1373.40s:  yeah, I believe so. And it's just because of the way that the question is framed and most people
1378.04s:  are distrustful of larger financial institutions. But if we were to take an actually well-framed
1385.56s:  objective question for this, I don't think a lot of people are aware. Myself included that this
1392.76s:  is a fucking thing. I did not know this. And it is classic. This is one of the reasons why GameStop
1400.36s:  is so cool. So what I'm actually going to do is highlight this, grab a screenshot,
1414.76s:  and you know, the next step is just throw this shit on X so that people can come take a look at
1423.96s:  the fun facts for themselves and see what they think. Not GME identifying continued systemic
1441.08s:  —
1460.22s:  Perfect.
1462.42s:  Unclothed Salamanders says, hi, on topic of bone cone 35, please advise if be bone.
1474.70s:  It's a great question.
1475.70s:  First off, thank you so much for the dollar 99.
1478.40s:  You know I'm cheap, right?
1480.18s:  Because when I watch that my buddy was sending me a stream like a clip from another stream
1485.70s:  where like people were throwing this person tons of money during the stream.
1490.22s:  It was actually really impressive.
1492.18s:  But they stopped taking like the lower dollar amount submissions and like skipping over
1497.92s:  those for the expensive ones.
1499.90s:  But I tell you what, dollar 99, get my attention every time.
1502.74s:  I'm here for you.
1504.34s:  But like we talked about on Friday, the probability of being bone there was pretty low.
1510.86s:  So the probability for this coming week is I surmise also likely fairly low.
1518.22s:  We can take a quick look just so that we know exactly what it do be.
1527.86s:  Let's grab a good old game stop.
1531.66s:  And then let's take a look at our probabilities.
1535.50s:  And then let's take a look at the probability of a touch just like Catholic priests.
1542.02s:  And let's take a look at a touch of 35.
1546.02s:  22% is what it's rolling at as it currently sits.
1554.66s:  Holy shit, this is 378 pages.
1559.26s:  Fuck.
1560.26s:  Oh my God.
1566.02s:  There's gotta be a fucking.
1573.02s:  Oh boy.
1576.78s:  I'm still just in the fucking addresses.
1581.42s:  Here we go.
1585.22s:  Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions into the
1589.22s:  entry of findings that the firm inaccurately reported certain of its listed option positions
1594.50s:  to the large option position reporting system, Loper, good old Loper, y'all know about
1598.62s:  Loper in violation of New York sausage change American rule 906, defining stated that there
1604.34s:  were approximately 13,190 instances in which there were inconsistencies between the short
1611.30s:  positions held in the firm's accounts that required reporting to the Loper and the short
1616.90s:  positions that the firm actually had reported to Loper in these instances, the firm had
1622.30s:  inaccurately reported its reportable options positions to Loper because of proprietary
1626.54s:  system flaw, cause the firm to omit the short contract quantities from being reported
1632.46s:  to Loper, infirm accounts that held short straddles, the firm subsequently corrected this
1637.98s:  flaw.
1638.98s:  So we can look at this and we can say two things.
1643.82s:  The first thing is we can say don't believe them system flaw, complete bullshit, they're
1650.66s:  fine.
1651.58s:  We can say believable systems do be flawing sometimes plausible.
1658.34s:  This one individual instance I would be indifferent, one instance indifferent, there's 55 disclosures
1669.62s:  in here and it looks like again, you can look at 55 instances and you could say well that's
1677.42s:  obviously a big problem.
1680.14s:  And it might be, it might not be.
1682.66s:  The reason why I say it might not be is when you look at a company as big as Merrill Lynch
1685.98s:  doing is much business as they are, like their mistakes are going to be at a magnitude
1693.78s:  that to the normal person will sound crazy, but to affirm that's doing billions of dollar
1699.18s:  business internationally, it's super complex.
1703.22s:  So it's not insane for it to have issues like this.
1709.18s:  So the problem here and that I don't know the answer to yet, which I'm actually going
1715.02s:  to see if there's anything that I can find relating to it, I'm going to download this
1721.06s:  and I'm going to throw it into GPT and what I want to do is see if there's any evidence
1730.38s:  of purposeful misreporting.
1733.82s:  And again, that's not to suggest that there isn't even if this says that there isn't,
1737.82s:  but I want to start there going back to what I tell you guys all the time.
1742.34s:  My goal is objective analysis.
1746.14s:  So read this Finra report and search for any evidence of purposeful misreporting
1760.78s:  or gross negligence of reporting.
1764.30s:  Let's see what it says.
1766.02s:  I'm actually curious what that will come back with.
1776.02s:  It's running right now.
1780.58s:  I'll let you know.
1783.86s:  Okay.
1792.30s:  The regulatory arbitration disclosures they indicate 55 regulatory events in one arbitration
1798.26s:  event.
1800.46s:  Disclose about the firm and its control.
1802.06s:  These events involve regulatory action, civil judicial proceedings and financial matters
1805.62s:  that perform the firm is required to disclose.
1810.02s:  Failure to file suspicious activity reports.
1813.38s:  SARS.
1814.86s:  They were fined six million.
1817.54s:  We're failing to establish adequate policies and controls for reporting suspicious activities
1821.98s:  as required by the Bank Superse act.
1824.54s:  The firm failed nearly 1500 SARS over a decade due to applying an incorrect monetary threshold
1832.10s:  for reporting suspicious activities.
1834.02s:  You oversight suggests the significant lapse in compliance with regulatory requirements
1837.86s:  and potentially amongst and potentially accounting to or amounting to gross negligence.
1845.02s:  Okay.
1846.02s:  Misuse of customer cash.
1847.02s:  Here we go.
1848.14s:  Merrill Lynch was also involved in a case where it misused customer cash generate profits
1851.74s:  for the firm.
1852.74s:  The SEC found that Merrill Lynch violated the customer protection rule by engaging in complex
1857.10s:  options trades that artificially reduced the required deposit of customer cash and reserve
1862.26s:  accounts.
1863.58s:  This violation exposed customers to significant risk and resulted in 450 million settlement
1869.38s:  with the SEC.
1870.66s:  That is a glaring issue to me.
1874.74s:  That kind of thing is not like the and again.
1877.10s:  You guys hopefully you can tell hopefully by now when I'm looking at this stuff, I always
1883.18s:  apply a skeptical lens and benefit of the doubt.
1887.18s:  And it's because I want to find information that is as representative of reality as possible.
1895.30s:  This is a massive fucking issue and you don't do this by mistake.
1899.90s:  There's no world here that they're using customer profits or customer cash to generate.
1908.30s:  Like there's no fucking way.
1910.70s:  So this is crazy to me.
1913.86s:  Also fun fact.
1914.86s:  I don't know if you guys know from X there's a dude named Kevin.
1920.58s:  What the fuck is last name?
1923.22s:  He talks about GameStop a lot.
1924.86s:  There's a dude named Kevin something that talks about GameStop a lot.
1927.82s:  But I connected with him and the game plan, I'm actually going to do a podcast episode
1933.22s:  with him.
1934.22s:  And this is one of the things that I want to talk to him about because I think he's from
1939.70s:  the professional management side.
1941.70s:  Thank you.
1942.70s:  Day swag.
1943.70s:  That's it.
1944.70s:  Malone Kevin Malone.
1945.70s:  And we're going to I want to bring him on the podcast.
1947.82s:  I don't think we'll do it on a live stream.
1949.46s:  I think we'll do it on a podcast so that we can get a little deeper in a detail.
1954.18s:  I love you guys know I love doing live streams with you guys.
1957.10s:  But sometimes it's difficult to be as interactive as I like with somebody else on a live stream
1963.02s:  when it's typically like me just interacting with them.
1966.58s:  So but I want to talk about this kind of stuff from their perspective.
1971.82s:  Negligent misrepresentation in annuity sales.
1975.02s:  There's a lawsuit filed alleging negligent misrepresentation by brokers regarding the features
1979.82s:  of a variable annuity sold by retired customer.
1982.90s:  The claim involves allegations of professional malpractice and failure to disclose high internal
1987.38s:  costs associated with the annuity.
1989.54s:  Give or take.
1991.38s:  This one is the worst to me.
1992.86s:  That one's like fucking egregious.
1994.78s:  That's nuts.
1996.18s:  Okay.
1997.18s:  Don't worry y'all.
2002.14s:  We are now past the first page of this single DD.
2009.30s:  Lord help me.
2013.94s:  Remember when we mentioned an SEA 15C three the case with A packs they were asking customers
2019.70s:  to book short positions to either cash account or short margin account protects these customers
2023.46s:  from a lot of brokers.
2024.94s:  Yeah.
2025.94s:  Okay.
2026.94s:  So we just we just read all this stuff.
2030.10s:  Merrill made it sound like a yo Lauren.
2036.86s:  I don't know if you know this, but you and your long legs have a secret admirer in
2041.06s:  day swag.
2042.58s:  In case you guys don't know, there might be a love story unfolding in front of our eyes
2047.50s:  with day swag and Lauren because day swag like most of us is enamored by Lauren's crazy
2054.42s:  long legs.
2055.98s:  So I just I hope that you guys have a chance to, you know, just turn it into a budding
2064.70s:  relationship wrapped around GME.
2070.02s:  So we read all this true exposure interests unknown.
2074.62s:  Okay.
2075.62s:  Yep.
2076.62s:  64 occasions 45 occasions.
2080.46s:  They continue to accept customer short sale orders and securities which had active fail
2084.26s:  to deliver.
2086.30s:  This isn't as crazy as you think it might be.
2090.78s:  Um, oh, I can hold on.
2092.78s:  I can generate an image.
2094.70s:  Hold on.
2095.70s:  I got to see what that would generate.
2097.86s:  Yo, get fucking let me know.
2104.02s:  I just want this generate an image.
2107.82s:  Sure.
2109.86s:  What do we get?
2114.10s:  Is it going?
2118.90s:  Looks like it's going.
2121.74s:  Let's see what it gives us.
2124.82s:  Whoa.
2126.82s:  What the fuck is this?
2129.54s:  What the fuck is this?
2132.82s:  Is that hair for those cheekbones?
2136.74s:  Does she have like two tear cheekbones?
2142.18s:  And where's the fucking rest of her glasses?
2147.46s:  Where's this arrow coming from?
2151.06s:  He just says like a little fucking arrow thing.
2154.66s:  Now that's a beast of a comb over.
2158.14s:  And he has multiple name tags, which is good.
2160.50s:  All right.
2161.50s:  Great.
2162.50s:  Now that we know what AI thinks this looks like, which is fantastic.
2170.22s:  Lauren says long legs and goal chains get some every time.
2173.14s:  Lauren, you got to not sell yourself short.
2175.54s:  Because if remember, your goal chain has diamonds in it.
2178.54s:  So it's a diamond studded goal chain.
2181.14s:  And you also, I think you had a cell phone in one of the masterpieces.
2186.86s:  So I have to be honest, if I ever do merch and do it make like t-shirts, one of them is
2192.22s:  going to have to be the Lauren drawings.
2195.62s:  Because that would just be fucking hilarious to have.
2198.22s:  I would love to walk around with that on a shirt and just have everybody look at that
2201.78s:  and be like, yo, what the fuck is on that shirt?
2204.62s:  And I just like, yeah, you wouldn't understand.
2206.82s:  You clearly don't understand art when it's right in front of your eyes.
2211.06s:  So there's no helping you.
2216.30s:  Yes, we know this.
2217.78s:  We know this.
2218.78s:  Okay.
2219.78s:  So this is just, we know all this stuff.
2224.54s:  I'm always down to laugh at the ass clowns.
2226.82s:  We know this.
2229.50s:  We know this.
2231.30s:  Okay.
2233.30s:  What is this thing?
2240.30s:  No, no, let me click this.
2248.30s:  I don't want to edit the fucking text, bro.
2253.90s:  Just want to click the link.
2255.86s:  Thank you.
2259.90s:  Cool.
2265.50s:  All right.
2269.34s:  I've already read this.
2270.34s:  I assume you guys have as well.
2276.66s:  The profitability of stock manipulation.
2285.46s:  This is a, this is a fucking, I love this shit.
2291.14s:  This is so awesome.
2293.30s:  Just love that again, like this goes back the same thing I've been talking about that I
2299.94s:  really respect about the apes.
2305.46s:  It is the fact that as a broad group, the eight, like the fact that the apes are citing
2314.90s:  something like this in here is very cool, is very, very cool to me.
2321.14s:  So now I'm going to add another document into this.
2325.14s:  And I'm going to have a GPT summarized this, summarize this research paper.
2336.18s:  Fucking awesome.
2337.50s:  SEC recently adopted, but we know about Reg show coming online to tighten restrictions,
2343.90s:  short selling curve, abuse of short sales, yeah, paper models, the market equilibrium
2348.74s:  and short selling is permitted in contrast to equilibrium with them without manipulators
2352.78s:  among the short sellers.
2354.18s:  I explain how naked short selling can routinely occur within the securities clearing system.
2360.22s:  Yep.
2361.22s:  Oh, wow.
2365.62s:  This is cool.
2369.78s:  That's really cool.
2372.54s:  So floating price convertible securities can resolve the unraveling problem and enable
2377.10s:  manipulator short selling to intensify.
2378.94s:  This is sick.
2380.94s:  All right.
2385.18s:  Let's see what GPT tells us.
2387.78s:  Okay.
2391.34s:  Research paper explores the dynamics and potential for abuse and short selling.
2396.62s:  Okay.
2397.62s:  Paper discusses SEC's adoption of Reg show aimed at tightening restrictions on short selling
2401.38s:  to curb practices such as naked short selling.
2404.18s:  Naked short selling occurs when a seller we already know that market equilibrium and manipulation
2408.46s:  the paper models market equilibrium with and without manipulators among short sellers.
2413.10s:  It highlights how manipulators can exploit naked short selling to create artificial supply
2416.82s:  demand and balances there by driving down stock prices.
2419.54s:  We have to find that section specifically.
2422.06s:  Then there's floating price convertible securities, which I want to read about.
2426.14s:  A significant focus is on floating price convertible securities, which can exacerbate
2431.82s:  manipulative short selling.
2433.42s:  These securities law for conversion equity at a floating price, which can be manipulated
2436.46s:  downward through aggressive short selling just before conversion dates.
2439.42s:  Next, historical context and techniques to pay provides historical context recording
2443.22s:  manipulative short selling tracing back to bear rates in the 17th century.
2449.02s:  What the fuck?
2450.42s:  It describes how these techniques have gotten have evolved over time and continue to
2453.86s:  post challenges for market regulation impact of short sale manipulation.
2458.58s:  Finnerty analyzes the impact of manipulative short sales on market equilibrium showing
2463.22s:  that such activities can destabilize the stock prices under my market efficiency.
2466.94s:  The presence of active traders who might mistake manipulators from formed investors further
2470.54s:  facilitates this manipulation.
2472.54s:  Fascinating.
2473.54s:  Fucking fascinating.
2479.14s:  First things first.
2484.02s:  This is old, but I need to see if I can find this dude.
2490.86s:  You have he does have an email.
2496.10s:  Let me give me a second.
2498.78s:  Y'all I'm I'm going to email this dude.
2501.50s:  I want to see if I can bring him on the podcast.
2513.86s:  I'm just writing a standard email scene if you want to join the podcast.
2539.22s:  I run a YouTube channel designed to share the world of finance and trading with retail
2547.34s:  investors removing the typical finance.
2553.94s:  PS.
2554.94s:  I'd love to host you on my podcast to discuss your findings in your paper and recent
2568.18s:  market developments.
2570.18s:  Thanks.
2572.18s:  Eric.
2573.18s:  Well, we'll see if John responds.
2576.18s:  That would be cool.
2577.18s:  Right.
2578.18s:  I understand.
2580.18s:  All right, back.
2584.18s:  Back at it.
2586.18s:  What kind of mouse do you guys use?
2589.18s:  Do you guys use like the mouse that moves around?
2593.18s:  I use one of these.
2595.18s:  I really like this thing.
2598.18s:  It was just like wielding it with my left hand realizing that it's not left hand friendly.
2605.18s:  Obviously, at all, it's very one sided.
2609.18s:  Okay, so the specific terms that I want to look for in here are equilibrium.
2614.18s:  So let's find that.
2616.18s:  So find.
2617.18s:  Oh, I think I can use the AI assistant.
2622.18s:  Oh, this is cool.
2623.18s:  I forgot.
2624.18s:  I don't even have to fucking throw it in GPT anymore.
2629.18s:  Let's see how well this thing does.
2644.18s:  Let's put this out.
2648.18s:  This section discusses the impact of market manipulators on equilibrium entry of a manipulator affects market equilibrium.
2653.18s:  We know if the inform investors is shorting shares optimally, it becomes unprofitable for the manipulators.
2658.18s:  So shares, okay.
2660.18s:  And either be pooling or separating equilibrium pooling equilibrium is more likely at the cost of shorting is high.
2667.18s:  Okay.
2669.18s:  Wow.
2671.18s:  One of my beard hairs must that shares got stuck in the can.
2678.18s:  We're already out of the mango orange.
2683.18s:  We're on to this to the backup.
2685.18s:  This one's blackberry.
2686.18s:  The blackberry one is good.
2688.18s:  But.
2689.18s:  It's a.
2691.18s:  It's unfortunately not mango orange.
2695.18s:  All right.
2696.18s:  A pooling equilibrium is more likely when the cost of shorting.
2699.18s:  So this talks about the conditions that it occurs.
2706.18s:  We know all about naked short selling at this point.
2718.18s:  And.
2723.18s:  And.
2729.18s:  It like does suggest I want to ask a specific question just let me fucking type my.
2733.18s:  Let me type my fucking question and dude.
2736.18s:  The hell.
2737.18s:  Well, we'll keep scrolling through here.
2743.18s:  There was one other piece that I specifically wanted to read, which was about the floating price.
2749.18s:  Well, finally.
2752.18s:  There's like a certain number of questions, whatever.
2756.18s:  Fine.
2757.18s:  I don't need to ask you no questions.
2759.18s:  Do it myself.
2760.18s:  Floating price.
2762.18s:  Okay.
2763.18s:  Recent securities innovation called floating price convertible securities removes an important constraint of sorts selling by resolving the unraveling problem.
2771.18s:  Okay.
2773.18s:  Oh, starting from where we're at.
2778.18s:  Does this not show me like the oh, whoa.
2784.18s:  I don't need that.
2787.18s:  I like when it just shows me like on a word doc where it is.
2795.18s:  And the order so that I can skip to where I want to look.
2805.18s:  Okay.
2806.18s:  Popular private equity financing instrument floating price convertible securities can resolve the unraveling problem because the manipulator doesn't have to buy back shares in the open market can obtain as many conversion shares.
2816.18s:  As needed by short selling the price downward just prior to the conversion notice date.
2821.18s:  The flawed structure the floating price convertibles contract may actually give security holders an incentive to manipulate the issuers share price downwards.
2829.18s:  Damn.
2832.18s:  This can increase the profitability of manipulative short selling because he faces less risk of a short squeeze the manipulator can sell short more shares.
2849.18s:  So I get it.
2850.18s:  The greater selling further reduces from share price increases manipulators profit.
2854.18s:  I get it.
2855.18s:  Okay.
2856.18s:  Cool.
2858.18s:  Love that great paper.
2866.18s:  I like that one.
2876.18s:  Lauren says there's a trading channel and they were talking about one of their start interns is skill reddit.
2888.18s:  So they're not familiar with the market sentiment in popularity because you literally can trade and run those.
2910.18s:  So they're not familiar with the market sentiment.
2920.18s:  Yeah, but definitely the short term momentum is is highly tradable. There's absolutely no no doubt about it.
2930.18s:  That's why people like opening range breakouts and stuff so much because you can trade those really well, which actually speaking of my.
2942.18s:  There was a couple short term trades that I had in GameStop that I haven't looked at I still have my longer term stuff.
2952.18s:  Yeah, okay.
2960.18s:  What is this?
2963.18s:  I'm going to attempt to amalgamate multiple pieces of DD's.
2967.18s:  Uh oh, this is going to get confusing because this the thing that we're reading now is already a composite DD that's now being composited by more composites.
2982.18s:  Okay, and we go.
2984.18s:  This thing summarized this section.
2992.18s:  There's no way this is going to scroll that slow that can't be real.
2999.18s:  Fun fact, it looks like it can be real. How is it scrolling this slow?
3005.18s:  Yeah, there's no way.
3016.18s:  Let me upload this into GPT.
3024.18s:  And let me see if GPT can handle it.
3030.18s:  The biggest document. So I might end up having to split this thing up just for efficiency sake.
3041.18s:  Right now, uh, GPT is loading it. What I'm going to do is ask you okay. So I'm going to ask GPT to summarize the section.
3047.18s:  Summarize this section.
3051.18s:  AOS theory.
3054.18s:  The everything connection.
3058.18s:  Every.
3061.18s:  Let's see if it can summarize that section.
3074.18s:  Let's see.
3078.18s:  It's trying. That would be great if it could.
3083.18s:  Oh, here we go.
3085.18s:  It's doing it. This is great.
3088.18s:  Okay, so the section chaos theory that everything connection from the diamond handbook appears or expose the application of chaos theory to financial markets.
3096.18s:  It does in a how chaos theory can explain unpredictable and complex behaviors and financial systems.
3101.18s:  Okay, here we go.
3102.18s:  Interconnected systems.
3104.18s:  The section posits that the financial markets are interconnected systems where small changes can lead to significant impacts akin to the butterfly effect in chaos theory.
3113.18s:  Interconnectedness suggests that minor events or trades can trigger larger market movements leading to volatility.
3120.18s:  Minor events. What does that mean?
3124.18s:  What does what do they mean by minor event? Let's see if I can find that minor.
3143.18s:  I'm curious that because the term minor event to me is very specific.
3153.18s:  Okay.
3157.18s:  Let's see if I can flip through some of this.
3163.18s:  Context what's going on or the hood.
3169.18s:  I love this. One of my favorite parts so far is the fact that they literally introduced themselves as their reddit handle.
3179.18s:  It's the only like look at this.
3182.18s:  My name is shark bait LOL.
3185.18s:  Imagine just walking out somebody like, yeah, my name is shark bait LOL.
3190.18s:  Of the last couple of weeks, prioritize investigate the story.
3194.18s:  He'll start something bigger.
3196.18s:  I have prior myself an accrued data scientist. This is interesting.
3199.18s:  One of the interesting things about this is the timing of these.
3202.18s:  Like the majority of these is actually after the initial squeeze.
3208.18s:  So for a lot of these people, they were actually in a very, very quiet period.
3214.18s:  Let me grab.
3217.18s:  Trading view.
3221.18s:  And let's grab GME.
3229.18s:  So this person posted April 11th 2021.
3240.18s:  Oh man, that's brutal.
3244.18s:  So I'm seeing a lot of the DD come through and here.
3250.18s:  Where we saw one pop in June.
3254.18s:  And then just down.
3258.18s:  Until this year.
3261.18s:  Rough timing.
3264.18s:  It's interesting to see a lot of this DD.
3270.18s:  And I think it's interesting to see a lot of this.
3275.18s:  Coming out like after the squeeze.
3278.18s:  Just temporally related.
3282.18s:  Davis is just popping in love.
3284.18s:  Your opinion on GME being a.
3286.18s:  Profit sell off on Friday short volume is crazy low.
3289.18s:  Unless it wasn't.
3290.18s:  Unless that isn't something to look for.
3292.18s:  That's fine.
3293.18s:  It's it's not so much like I don't.
3298.18s:  But I look at it against the broader context of how the underlying is moving.
3302.18s:  That's that's the main thing that I'm paying attention to personally.
3307.18s:  Alright, let's continue here.
3312.18s:  Yes, yes, yes.
3316.18s:  Susquehanna.
3321.18s:  Okay, I'm going to read this.
3334.18s:  Now we have sus appealing new DTCC regs to make things weirder growing position prompted me.
3342.18s:  To start doing a deep dive.
3344.18s:  Double in size since the part of the start of the pandemic.
3349.18s:  Interesting.
3351.18s:  So this looks like they're just like exploring the the structural conflict of interest and whatnot.
3358.18s:  From within.
3360.18s:  Susquehanna.
3366.18s:  You know.
3368.18s:  I see anything in here about the chaos theory.
3370.18s:  I'm starting to think that you PT just went fucking rogue.
3374.18s:  You PT didn't say anything about Susquehanna.
3379.18s:  Yeah, I think you PT went absolute rogue.
3388.18s:  Yep, so they're rich.
3393.18s:  Other address saw.
3401.18s:  Biggest tax game in the world.
3403.18s:  Yep.
3408.18s:  That's this is normal though.
3410.18s:  Yeah, this is just tax.
3412.18s:  So for those that don't know, I'll take a pause here to talk about some of these things.
3419.18s:  And.
3422.18s:  There are a lot of ways to very smartly decrease your tax liabilities depending on how you structure.
3430.18s:  As your total resources start to grow, you spend more time learning about stuff like this.
3436.18s:  It was a couple of years ago that I started doing a ton of research and meeting with different kinds of attorneys and tax preparers to learn more.
3446.18s:  I think that's the most important thing about how this stuff works out of curiosity.
3452.18s:  Now, the interesting thing is that something like this, depending on how it's structured, can be illegal.
3460.18s:  It can be perfectly legally set up.
3463.18s:  So I'm actually really curious what it thinks about this.
3470.18s:  So now we're getting into like the location of stuff.
3487.18s:  Here we go.
3488.18s:  Whether you think this is wrong rate, even loophole location is blank to 9.5 billions of taxes have been evaded as a result of this location.
3495.18s:  So yeah, because I mean like this, I understand the point that people are making.
3500.18s:  And the other thing is that they're again, they're making the wrong comparison here.
3504.18s:  Just saying like the number of businesses is part of the equation, but you can have a lot of entities in a small space.
3513.18s:  Now, obviously this is clearly people that are tax sheltering.
3518.18s:  But I'm curious like what the tax shelter angle means to them because I just I haven't seen that yet.
3533.18s:  How is Citadel evolved?
3535.18s:  Will it turns out they have an entity tied to the Uglund House? Of course, it's right.
3539.18s:  The same entity connected.
3541.18s:  Yeah.
3546.18s:  Citadel operating multiple places.
3555.18s:  I'm struggling to understand what they're.
3567.18s:  I don't know if they're connected between Black Rock, Swiss and Citadel, Palafol.
3573.18s:  Hey, but what's the, I don't understand the implication like why?
3578.18s:  Whether or not there's a connection between these entities, my my.
3582.18s:  My default is rich, powerful entities all know and operate with one another.
3589.18s:  So I don't even think like taking the time to attempt to prove it, per se unless there's a direct implication of this explicit combination of the three of them.
3599.18s:  Also the fact that they share the same kind of tax entities like again, like smart resource rich entities are going to do their best to be as efficient as possible.
3615.18s:  So the fact that they're using the Uplund House or other kind of tax shelters.
3622.18s:  Again, I'm not saying it's good or bad. I just I don't understand the implication that they're trying to draw from that yet.
3628.18s:  If you guys know, let me know.
3637.18s:  I love this little drawing. This is rad.
3642.18s:  Yeah, here we go. Connection between this is incredibly complex moving pieces.
3648.18s:  Yep, 5d chess game. Okay. Black Rock isn't just looking to kill off Melvin, maybe working with the government and.
3656.18s:  To make some major changes happen to the market. Okay. And goal.
3662.18s:  Yeah, bro, not entirely obvious to me yet.
3669.18s:  I mean, I don't.
3674.18s:  That just seems like a lot, a lot of work and effort and tying obscure components together to arrive at something that I think we all know, which is any sort of powerful organization is going to try to push its agenda and inform the development of the landscape.
3691.18s:  As it's relevant to it.
3694.18s:  Like I think that that's just a granted I think we all kind of know that so this I have to be honest was a little.
3705.18s:  It's a little unclear to me like what the specific thing is, but this.
3713.18s:  This is the part that I would want to see the author define more so that I could actually understand what the like what the perspective and what the implications of the perspective are because again, like what I'm reading here is.
3729.18s:  Yeah, this is kind of like, yeah, this makes sense.
3733.18s:  But this is also a default assumption in my opinion.
3743.18s:  We now have the inclusion of Gary Gensler, SEC specialized cryptocurrency dark pool all in the banks.
3751.18s:  Yeah.
3754.18s:  What the fuck.
3756.18s:  I have to be honest, this this DD was a little confusing to me just in terms of it's what this is trying to prove or disprove.
3767.18s:  Because understanding that big big entities are incentivized to push their own agendas, of course, understanding that big entities are likely colluding with one another to better themselves, of course.
3780.18s:  So yeah.
3786.18s:  Deswax is our people upset about resource hoarding and stepping on poor people to do so.
3792.18s:  I think that's bigger than that. Like that's a really big statement.
3800.18s:  Yeah, I think at least as far as I could tell that seems like a big statement separate from this that you could always make the argument that big entities are inherently selfish.
3811.18s:  And I again, like I don't necessarily dig the stepping on poor people to do it.
3816.18s:  That's a little too specific and conflict driven in my opinion.
3821.18s:  I think big entities will step on anybody to do it.
3824.18s:  I don't think that they're explicitly targeting poor people.
3827.18s:  I think big entities will target anybody that they can get money from or take advantage of.
3833.18s:  But yeah.
3838.18s:  I think again, like we kind of know that we already know that there's corporate greed to obscene level where CEOs are making tens of millions of dollars.
3851.18s:  I mean, like that is just obviously massive paid disparity and stuff like that.
3858.18s:  So yeah.
3863.18s:  Yeah, I guess I'm just.
3868.18s:  I want to understand as best as I possibly can.
3872.18s:  Some of you feel the fact that we have tax havens in the world aren't a big deal.
3876.18s:  What's interesting is that all these players are registered the same place and appears that the government wants to do something about it.
3881.18s:  This.
3884.18s:  It's not that interesting. It's an efficiency thing.
3887.18s:  So what this means is somebody in that building has found a way to set up a business service that allows other people to use that building for the tax haven because you need a local address.
3900.18s:  And that's all it is. It's not it's not like Black Rock and the other entities are all like, oh, we all have to go to this house together.
3907.18s:  It's just an economy of scale efficiency thing.
3910.18s:  And the great example of that is here in California, there's a lot of laws annoying laws about vehicles and the vehicles itself here.
3922.18s:  There's like you can't have all different kinds of stuff. It's it's really, really strict.
3927.18s:  So there are places like Wyoming that people will set up LLCs to register the vehicle too so that it's not.
3936.18s:  And then you can't have to go through California registration and smog.
3941.18s:  So it's like there are specific entities that exist online to set people up to do those kinds of things.
3947.18s:  It's the same thing as something like this. It's just an efficiency thing.
3951.18s:  So.
3954.18s:  Yeah.
3956.18s:  Lauren says that's why I'll never stop laughing about left crying on the news because the internet was being mean. Did he actually cry?
3962.18s:  I thought people were saying that he did, but I thought people were then saying that it was like an AI generated image because if he was actually crying, I 100% have to see that.
3975.18s:  I just saw it and joke about it.
3980.18s:  Was that real? Did he actually cry on the news or no?
3986.18s:  Because if he did must see like that's a must see event for me. But if he didn't, I still would like to joke about it.
4001.18s:  I think the crying thing was more on the verge of tears.
4004.18s:  I didn't see it. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I didn't see any of that. It looked like he was just kind of smug.
4012.18s:  And here we go.
4015.18s:  Induced to a hype induced market crash.
4019.18s:  I think we can generally scroll over this because from 2021 this didn't happen. We didn't have a market crash.
4029.18s:  So.
4033.18s:  This is about the overall hype. Yeah. Let's see if I can just read the conclusion.
4045.18s:  We're going to have to get the apes to follow like standard paper writing format with like an abstract and conclusions.
4060.18s:  Now this is where I connected dots form a theory. The majority of US markets have switched from mortgage back CDOs to CLO's foundation following the O8.
4070.18s:  If GME squeezes again, Reddit research counterfeit US treasure. Oh, Jesus Christ.
4075.18s:  The second GME squeeze to be so epic that the protective measures in place won't be sufficient. Okay. So we can conclude that this did not happen.
4086.18s:  I think I figured out what D.F. V. knows I am now very interested in this one. This one. I'm absolutely going to read this whole thing because this I'm supremely interested in.
4098.18s:  If you look at the options volume out of the money 16th.
4104.18s:  April. You'll notice that's much higher than any other times about the history of stock. Yes.
4111.18s:  I believe that D.F. V. knows that shit at the end is no long positions in GME and only has calls and puts GME.
4120.18s:  When your options expire out of the money and you have no other positions in the stock but shorts, you literally have nothing.
4132.18s:  Makes sense as to why the shorts have been dragging it out this long. You never go up in an option until it expires.
4140.18s:  That's not how that works. If there's a chance, there's a chance you still have seen in the game.
4145.18s:  Institutions don't work like this man. Like just to be clear.
4149.18s:  We can say what we want and we can think what we want about entities like Citadel, but they are exceedingly proficient at what they do.
4162.18s:  And they're not going to maintain an options position because of hope.
4169.18s:  Like that's just not how they're going to run position.
4174.18s:  If your options expire out of the money and along positions, you have no leg left to stand on no more skin in the game.
4181.18s:  Nothing else you can do but cover your short positions.
4186.18s:  This.
4192.18s:  I don't understand what this means. They don't have any skin left in the game and any more legs to stand on.
4203.18s:  What?
4206.18s:  Why not? Why not buy your puts then for a year?
4213.18s:  The week of 16 April stock was 45 per share and going down.
4219.18s:  It's.
4221.18s:  This one's the thing tough.
4224.18s:  If he knows this information and matched their puts with calls.
4229.18s:  And being on the winning side of the equation, he exercises options and quadrupled down.
4236.18s:  Oh boy.
4238.18s:  I.
4241.18s:  Struggle with this one.
4243.18s:  I think that there's just a lot of random stuff in here to be honest.
4252.18s:  Rantidysysynthetics via options.
4255.18s:  Yeah, but the thing is like you can continue to set up synthetic.
4258.18s:  That's the thing it's not like.
4260.18s:  This doesn't make sense to me.
4262.18s:  The fact that they're saying they have out of the money options and they're holding on to them for hope.
4267.18s:  They can just continue the options position. You just roll it.
4271.18s:  And they absolutely have the money to maintain the position as long as they legitimately would want if that's the case.
4278.18s:  So I just I don't think that holds anyway.
4281.18s:  I also don't think this idea of D a V knowing whatever this actually means.
4287.18s:  And then.
4289.18s:  Matching puts with calls like that doesn't really mean anything.
4294.18s:  And then I also don't think he exercises options.
4299.18s:  So like there's a lot of.
4303.18s:  Yeah, there's a lot of.
4306.18s:  Rekki things in here.
4312.18s:  I've been fighting because they had a like to stand on with their put options.
4317.18s:  They don't.
4328.18s:  I don't think this is as obvious as they might think to be honest.
4336.18s:  Like I have a million questions here.
4339.18s:  Why.
4342.18s:  Why wouldn't they just continue the out if this is the center of gravity for their position, the options trade.
4347.18s:  Why would they not just continue the options position? I don't get that.
4353.18s:  Yeah.
4355.18s:  This one a little.
4358.18s:  Rekki.
4362.18s:  All right.
4366.18s:  I think we kind of know this.
4369.18s:  Don't we?
4371.18s:  The fucking market was about to explode.
4375.18s:  The details plan is to route retool orders to assistance possible.
4380.18s:  70 to 90% of retail traders lose money.
4382.18s:  I hate statistics like that, but it's not fully inaccurate.
4386.18s:  By issuing a short share on the trade instead of locating it.
4390.18s:  Yes, so we know that we're doing this.
4393.18s:  We're doing this.
4397.18s:  Same.
4400.18s:  This wasted a shut down trading and why rob.
4403.18s:  This will never not be funny to me.
4405.18s:  It will not be funny to me that I'm sitting here on a fucking YouTube live stream.
4410.18s:  Really like trying to understand the theories and the assumptions about market microstructure and stuff like that.
4418.18s:  I'm learning from people called robbing your mom.
4423.18s:  Only shut down trading.
4426.18s:  I love that they call them this.
4429.18s:  And that's why we just heard the last congressional hearing directly from TTC.
4433.18s:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4439.18s:  Lauren says the market almost exploded and they made a video about retail trade.
4443.18s:  They made a video about retail investors doing research.
4446.18s:  Lauren, what was that?
4454.18s:  Do you have the video link to that Lauren?
4456.18s:  I would love to watch it.
4458.18s:  Re says someone messes up option talk.
4461.18s:  Eric and I took that personally.
4464.18s:  That's so funny.
4467.18s:  Well, it's because people.
4469.18s:  People will say things that are really half baked and it's like supremely misleading for other people that don't know any better.
4475.18s:  So my preference is if somebody doesn't know something about something, just don't don't talk about it.
4483.18s:  Just leave it leave it alone.
4486.18s:  That's why with a lot of the game stop stuff, I don't talk about it because I don't know a lot.
4490.18s:  I'm spending time learning, but I'm nowhere near it.
4495.18s:  Lauren says you didn't see it.
4498.18s:  I don't know.
4504.18s:  Citadel's market maker for 50% of retail trade.
4507.18s:  Oh, no, I didn't say Siri.
4509.18s:  Chill out.
4512.18s:  And every single position went up huge same time.
4516.18s:  Citadel was caught on the line.
4520.18s:  They're providing liquidity retail.
4528.18s:  I'm excited before the squeeze runoff, no time to reverse the positions.
4533.18s:  They're now locked into assuming that every share purchased during the run up also wasn't sure shares.
4540.18s:  Citadel page states our automated equities platform.
4547.18s:  Okay.
4558.18s:  Interesting.
4565.18s:  Citadel bell.
4568.18s:  Melvin.
4571.18s:  Yep.
4574.18s:  So how do I think Citadel and Melvin wound up holding short positions created by Citadel if there's supposed to be a firewall.
4583.18s:  I know that.
4588.18s:  I love the TLDR here though, big fan.
4592.18s:  The tricky part that we have to say is that again, this is one of the problems when.
4601.18s:  People like to promulgate something that they want to be true or want to believe.
4607.18s:  Because when we say something like hegs are fucked from 2021.
4612.18s:  The reality like the overwhelming reality is that genuinely like that as much as I don't like them, they're still here and they're still making buckets of money.
4623.18s:  So.
4626.18s:  I like the message and I like the idea of like trying to call out the errors and stuff.
4633.18s:  I think one of the one of the problems here is that that like the hedges unfortunately are not fucked and they're continuing to make buckets of money as they tend to do because I don't want to go quite as far as saying something is like too big to fail because they can something can always fail.
4655.18s:  But they have so many disgusting internal.
4660.18s:  Efficiency's built.
4663.18s:  That they're not again, I wouldn't say that they're too big to fail, but they're not that far off of being too big to fail.
4673.18s:  They have a lot of really, really, really.
4681.18s:  Like big advantages that other elements don't have, which is one of the reasons why they continue to persist like they do.
4692.18s:  I'm not going but it is also one of those it is what it is kind of things.
4702.18s:  I'm thinking Italian for dinner tonight, a.
4710.18s:  Italian sounds perfect.
4717.18s:  Roing.
4721.18s:  Roing.
4724.18s:  City says in the congressional hearings during the 2008 financial crisis too big to fail. Yeah, exactly. And that's that's why too big to fail is such a like nefarious concept because.
4734.18s:  Something is too big to fail until it fails, but there are massive massive economies of scale that bigger entities have like these guys that make it really like again objectively speaking a lot of these hedge funds literally should have gone bankrupt during the squeeze in 21.
4755.18s:  The entities that were so short and did not cover they they absolutely should have gone bankrupt, but because they were in a sense too big to fail because it was going to start jeopardizing the broad market they essentially were bailed out.
4775.18s:  It's complete in utter bullshit, but it is what it is. So the the two big to fail thing unless something is because in that case if quote unquote nature was allowed to take and run its normal course.
4792.18s:  Well, that wouldn't have happened and they would have been pushed out of business, but that is not the case.
4800.18s:  I have to call Mal and make sure she orders of dinner. Normally she doesn't answer this one she knows what I'm calling for though. She sends me to voicemail and then she'll take a look.
4811.18s:  Communication 101.
4817.18s:  And there's the text.
4820.18s:  Okay.
4824.18s:  What is this?
4831.18s:  Do you guys know what this one is?
4836.18s:  Reese says I failed to see how collapsed in the financial system would be a would result in a win for anyone. Oh, it absolutely wouldn't like it would not retail traders would lose the money.
4847.18s:  But what happens Reese is people get so wrapped up in trying to let seek like vindication that it's like scorched earth policy.
4859.18s:  I guarantee you that there are swaths of retail traders who would have been fine letting their $5,000 position.
4868.18s:  Eviscerate as the financial system collapse just to watch hedge funds and other entities that they don't like fail.
4878.18s:  It's very much the case and I also want to be clear. I don't blame them. I don't blame that perspective because it's very, very frustrating to see.
4887.18s:  Now, from a practical standpoint, obviously that makes no sense because I'm in markets personally to try to make money.
4897.18s:  And if there's no there's no financial market, then it's real, real tricky to make money on something that doesn't exist.
4905.18s:  So from that perspective, it yeah, it doesn't really help us much.
4916.18s:  But from the perspective of people that feel like they've been taken advantage of, they feel like there's structural and inequity and things like that folks like that are way more willing to go scorched earth and just let the cards fall where they way.
4935.18s:  So yeah, and again, I can understand the perspective. It's not practical. It's in from a logical perspective. It literally doesn't make sense.
4944.18s:  But from like a human perspective, it makes sense. I can see it.
4950.18s:  But yeah, okay, so let's keep going through this.
4956.18s:  Things capital participation lunch from power.
4961.18s:  Fuck is this.
4963.18s:  We literally need to have abstracts.
4973.18s:  It's on the board vice chairman funds are managed by black stone.
4979.18s:  Looking emerge with citadel.
4985.18s:  Oh, I like this one. We're all fucked from 23 May.
4991.18s:  So no background. In fact, I'm in health care. What I've gathered three months of investing three months.
4999.18s:  You tell me what you think. The title I post pretty sums up if I make any mistakes.
5004.18s:  Okay, so I'm realizing I'm going to have to go through these a little bit faster.
5008.18s:  Here's one of the problems I'm starting to notice with some of these DDS is that they're like genuinely exceedingly inexperienced people, which is fine.
5016.18s:  Right. And it's okay to put a DD out. And it's okay to share your information. No problem with any of that.
5021.18s:  But these kinds of like really hyperpolic stuff from people that are really inexperienced in my mind.
5029.18s:  They get very little credence. I spend very little time on stuff like this.
5033.18s:  I'll still flip through it out of sheer curiosity. But it's 2024 now.
5040.18s:  And we're not fucked. Things are still moving along, chugging along. Okay.
5046.18s:  So.
5049.18s:  What you'll find is people.
5054.18s:  People really like to talk about this kind of stuff.
5058.18s:  It's why if you open up news, most people you'll find that like you'll get news fatigued.
5065.18s:  The reason why you get news fatigued is when you open up the news, it's always all this horrible shit that's happening all over the place.
5071.18s:  And it's because people are drawn to that like moths to a flame.
5077.18s:  For whatever reason, people love some bad shit going on.
5082.18s:  So this kind of stuff almost always will gain traction and is a very appealing angle for people.
5090.18s:  It's for that exact reason. It's because it's engaging.
5093.18s:  So it's always easy to talk about how things can go wrong, how bad things are, how the reason why I'm talking about this specific thing is because
5105.18s:  I've seen different versions of this throughout. I've been trading 17 years now.
5113.18s:  I see this happen all the time, all the time. Every single fucking year.
5119.18s:  I see people talking about the end of the world, how it's here.
5123.18s:  It's just.
5127.18s:  It's just so common.
5130.18s:  And there are always things that knock us down. There are things that slow us down.
5135.18s:  But I am very bullish on the US, the US economy, the stock market and companies as whole.
5142.18s:  There's all these pockets of things that kind of suck, but writ large, super bullish.
5147.18s:  I'm naturally a cautious optimist.
5150.18s:  And so this kind of stuff, especially with somebody that has three months of experience.
5155.18s:  Again, it's not I wouldn't I don't fully dismiss it, but it definitely like the weight in my mind gets nerfed massively.
5163.18s:  And it's not out of any disrespect to this person, but three months in markets is it's literally laughable.
5172.18s:  Nobody's at any point in three months to talk about shit in the markets.
5177.18s:  It literally takes probably three to five years to genuinely get your fucking feet under you.
5183.18s:  That's not even at the point where I would consider that person supremely proficient or anything like that.
5189.18s:  I've come across plenty of traders that have done super well over three or four year periods.
5194.18s:  And they are exceedingly confident because they've crushed it for a specific period of time until they realize that they've only seen one element of the market.
5203.18s:  And then the market throws a curveball, something new comes out that they haven't seen yet.
5207.18s:  They're way too over position because they're way too overconfidence.
5210.18s:  They haven't seen what they don't know yet. And then they get fucking smashed.
5214.18s:  So the to me, the main thing that is a dominant function of market proficiency is consistent return and staying power.
5227.18s:  So, uh, Roryntady says the dude says he is new and explained if he's wrong, he's not stating it is fact.
5233.18s:  Oh, definitely. Yeah. I'm not again, I'm not saying anything negative about this person at all because if you recall what I said in the beginning, it's completely cool for them to to write up their thoughts and what they think.
5246.18s:  I'm talking about the much larger perspective of these kinds of angles that people take.
5255.18s:  I'm not talking about this person's angle. I haven't even read it yet. It could be fucking genius.
5260.18s:  I don't know. I'm just talking about this general angle people take because I've seen it my entire trading career.
5267.18s:  I will continue to see it. My entire trading career is not going anywhere because this shit's in bug.
5273.18s:  Okay. So let's see.
5275.18s:  SB 500 inflation yield that's now falling below zero 40 or low.
5281.18s:  Yep.
5284.18s:  You know, if you're not familiar about repo market, too much cash in the system, not enough collateral.
5302.18s:  So one of the issues is in this where we're making a mistake in analysis here.
5311.18s:  The reason why we're making a mistake in analysis here is because of how impactful a period like 2020 was and all of the subsequent outputs from COVID and all of the financial and economic functions that went into place during COVID.
5327.18s:  You can see where's literally still dealing with it now in 2024.
5332.18s:  So comparing this kind of stuff to other reference periods is slightly faulty literally from a landscape perspective alone.
5342.18s:  I'm not saying that there's no way in any of this. That's not what I'm inferring. I'm just saying we have to take the broader context into into context here.
5353.18s:  Roy Tady says it was the collective effort for people who were getting run over in the market because they didn't understand it researching and learning together.
5359.18s:  Yeah, yeah. And again, I agree with that as well. I think that's good.
5362.18s:  I think the the issue I have is the we're all fucked. That's a definitive statement.
5368.18s:  Right. And again, this is a definitive style statement that a lot of people will take all the time.
5374.18s:  Now they go on to say that they're new, which is cool. But for somebody with very little experience to open with this again, it's it's just not a great attribution for the rest of the research.
5394.18s:  But again, like I said, I'm always going to read through stuff because you never know too much cash in the system, not enough collateral, which again, that's sort of true.
5403.18s:  But the repo market is a little bit different than that.
5409.18s:  Yeah, this is good.
5412.18s:  Yep, this is good.
5417.18s:  Crypto correction.
5422.18s:  Okay.
5431.18s:  I mean, okay.
5443.18s:  Rich divorcing or selling stocks.
5450.18s:  Okay.
5455.18s:  So when I'm reading through this, there's a very specific theme that I'm picking up. Do you have any idea what it is?
5462.18s:  It is a very normal cognitive cognitive bias. It's super clear.
5469.18s:  So when, when I look through stuff like this, a big thing that I explicitly want to see is how things are positioned and what angles are we taking?
5487.18s:  So far, as I'm reading through this, I'm seeing somebody that seeing what they're looking for. That's what I'm seeing.
5497.18s:  I also talked about this in the beginning with some of that other DD that we were talking about.
5503.18s:  And this is one of the most common biases that you're going to see is confirmation bias, anchoring bias.
5510.18s:  These are things where we come across artifacts of stuff.
5514.18s:  And then all of the subsequent research that we do goes to the effect of how can I find things that bolster this point that I have.
5524.18s:  One of the things that I look for in stuff like this is how well do they steal man their own position?
5535.18s:  Because they're looking at a lot of things that are slightly related, slightly not related like margin debt, for example.
5542.18s:  Margin debt is way, way, way more complex than looking at a pickup and margin debt from different time frames again through a global pandemic, what that might mean.
5553.18s:  Also what the new financial picture might look like.
5556.18s:  So yeah.
5564.18s:  I believe like they're literally talking about fucking FDIC insurance.
5570.18s:  That's like end of world kind of shit.
5573.18s:  So to say stuff like my goal is not to incite panic, but then to say for those panicking, I think you can cash in on your FDIC insurance.
5585.18s:  That's inciting panic like that's that's what that is.
5594.18s:  Interesting. I mean, it's an interesting thing. It's cool to see somebody learning about economic functions.
5601.18s:  But it also highlights how complex economic markets are economics and markets are.
5611.18s:  They're massively, massively, massively correlated, but there's so specific to individual circumstances context around what's going on in the world today.
5622.18s:  That it's very difficult to run through this kind of analysis and to come up with a make sure you're in an FDIC insured bank.
5629.18s:  There's yeah.
5632.18s:  Roryntady says don't forget last year that FDIC had a bailout banks or is it 22 you mean with.
5639.18s:  Silicon Valley bank SVB is that we're referring to.
5649.18s:  So showing possible evidence of force liquidations.
5654.18s:  Okay.
5657.18s:  I think we can.
5660.18s:  Through this.
5663.18s:  I think we might be seeing force liquidations given that the connection between counter parties price surges, GME's correct.
5670.18s:  When was this?
5672.18s:  27 May 21.
5676.18s:  Okay.
5682.18s:  TCC Wall Street want key things in place before GME and wines. Now we're looking at a list that is most likely checked off rocket about cleared for launch.
5691.18s:  So this.
5699.18s:  28 May 28.
5717.18s:  May 28.
5722.18s:  And this is the highest game stop hit before it started contracting down if I'm not mistaken.
5745.18s:  I'll be right back.
5775.18s:  All right.
5801.18s:  Okay.
5808.18s:  Let's see what we got here.
5817.18s:  Yeah. So this.
5820.18s:  I mean, this is about.
5825.18s:  Is closest they're going to get.
5833.18s:  Yeah. This is about as close as you're going to get to like top ticking it before we we had the rest of the rotation down.
5842.18s:  So I don't know you can kind of.
5845.18s:  It's this is one of the things when you're reading through a lot of the due diligence and what people think are going to happen.
5853.18s:  Is you have to pay pretty close attention to the timing and the fact that most people are just guessing right.
5864.18s:  And they're most people that I read here are actually very, very cool because they identify that nobody really knows what's going on and we're trying to figure it out.
5876.18s:  The problem is is that if you continue if you read through a lot of this and you don't continually remind yourself of that broader message.
5885.18s:  You become desensitized to the people saying I don't know what I'm talking about.
5891.18s:  And you start onboarding the broad messages that are there subconsciously.
5898.18s:  So and I'm not saying good, bad and different.
5901.18s:  It's just that you have to be really thoughtful when you're receiving and perceiving the information from stuff like this.
5908.18s:  Because I mean this objectively did not happen right that game stop did absolutely rally.
5914.18s:  But my guess is that it's not to what they thought was going on.
5918.18s:  And you can see what a lot of people will tie things to to try to further elucidate their point or validate their point.
5925.18s:  One of the things I would love to see in the DDS here and it's the same thing that I do in all of my strategy outlines is I have a section that literally talks about when does this.
5937.18s:  What when does this not work when does this strategy fail right it's specifically.
5945.18s:  Reminding myself to look at the flaws into a steel man to look at the other side.
5954.18s:  A lot of what I see here are people seeing what they want to see.
5962.18s:  And I think that's the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of
5992.18s:  the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end
6022.18s:  of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
6052.18s:  end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of
6082.18s:  the end of the
6084.72s:  end of the end of the end of the end of the end and then, then then, then, then, then is
6088.74s:  there's two owners.
6098.00s:  There's two owners.
6106.16s:  to give it to the guy, oh, I see what this is. Okay, got it.
6113.76s:  So there's just, I see. Okay.
6120.08s:  Follow up to the House of Cards.
6131.44s:  Let me...
6136.80s:  I'm going to try to scroll through these a little bit quicker.
6141.28s:  And I'm going to flag the ones that I want to go back to.
6143.52s:  It's just because we're only at page three hundred of eight forty two.
6146.48s:  This is going to take forever for us to like, meaningfully get through these.
6150.56s:  And some of them, I don't want to say that they're not good.
6154.16s:  Like they're fine for what they are.
6155.52s:  But I think some of them are less informative than than others.
6160.16s:  Let me see, I want to see if I can scroll through this faster.
6162.80s:  Why does this scroll so slow?
6165.12s:  How does this make any sense?
6173.28s:  Because I also can't trust chat GPT to summarize it.
6176.96s:  It did not do a good job summarizing.
6181.28s:  I wonder if I zoom out like this.
6188.16s:  No.
6189.04s:  No.
6194.00s:  There we go.
6196.32s:  That goes pretty quick.
6199.92s:  Perfect.
6200.96s:  We found a way to cheat the system.
6206.32s:  I can't read anything that's there.
6209.20s:  But let's grab this.
6213.68s:  And then summarize this article.
6218.88s:  Perfect.
6219.60s:  This is fantastic news for us.
6229.28s:  We're on Titi says, shitted delas control in the scroll.
6231.44s:  They're in the computer.
6232.88s:  The files are in the computer.
6235.84s:  I got to move this over here because now I'm using other windows and shit.
6240.32s:  Also shout out to you guys.
6241.76s:  There's 80 people hanging out right now.
6244.16s:  Learn all about corrupt market structure.
6249.20s:  Bigger thing hopefully is I genuinely and hopeful some of you are learning some of the stuff
6254.80s:  that I am as I'm going through this.
6256.16s:  I know a lot of you will know way more about this than I do.
6259.04s:  I continue to reiterate the point that I am a guest in the GameStop house.
6265.92s:  Even though that's the case, I'm hopeful that as I go through individual things like this,
6270.72s:  people might be picking up elements that they might not have seen before.
6275.28s:  Because I think that that's really, really useful information to build over time.
6282.48s:  So that's at least my hope.
6294.24s:  All right.
6295.52s:  So let's see what GPT says.
6298.24s:  Article attached discusses the concept of everything short.
6303.12s:  The series suggests that several hedge funds have been strategically shorting a wide range of stocks to manipulate market dynamics.
6309.12s:  Okay.
6312.32s:  hedge funds like Citadel, Melvin Capital, others develop significant positions in various companies.
6317.28s:  Funds are accused of systematically shorting stocks of companies that compete with their favorite investments.
6322.80s:  Sure.
6323.12s:  I could see that.
6324.48s:  The author implies that these hedge funds engage in practices that resemble market manipulation.
6328.40s:  They might short stocks of companies like GameStop or AMC to suppress their price while supporting
6333.60s:  competitors like Amazon or Netflix.
6336.32s:  So here's the problem that we start running into here.
6339.20s:  Is when we're talking about systemic shorting like that to that scale.
6344.24s:  I'm not saying it can happen.
6346.24s:  But it becomes really, really difficult to do so.
6350.96s:  And the reason why it's difficult to do so is because markets are consensus-driven pricing mechanisms.
6357.12s:  So unless that there's other entities that are also in collusion that are like,
6361.92s:  yeah, okay, we'll just let this thing get crushed.
6364.08s:  Sooner or later, there will be entities even like Ryan Cohen.
6367.44s:  He does it not in an investing standpoint,
6369.92s:  but in terms of scooping in on businesses and turning them around.
6373.92s:  Investors will do that.
6374.88s:  Traders will do that because it's if we see something that gets pushed down to
6380.16s:  a level that doesn't make sense based on the valuation.
6383.76s:  A lot of people will enter into that market and buy it because it makes sense.
6390.00s:  It's such a value. And this straight up has been the case.
6395.28s:  You can literally see it happening in GameStop.
6398.64s:  If we zoom this in, you can see GameStop got absolutely punished.
6403.36s:  And it's because objectively speaking, the business of GameStop during this period did not
6409.36s:  look great. I'm not trying to talk shit. I know that people get sensitive about that,
6414.48s:  but it's completely true from an objective standpoint.
6417.76s:  It's a brick and mortar-based business that that's a tough way to succeed
6425.60s:  in an exceedingly digital market in a place where people aren't buying consoles and games
6431.92s:  physically in store in mass anymore. Most of it's done at home via Amazon and then you buy the
6436.88s:  games on the console. So I've been playing a game called Starfield, which is actually super
6442.16s:  cool. You get to cruise around space. But then GameStop starts to turn things around pretty
6450.64s:  massively. And that's why I'm so excited about the move from here because the move from here
6459.60s:  is market internal driven. This move happens because people are starting to see options activity.
6467.44s:  I saw the options activity. I start to get in because there's activity. Other people are in.
6473.04s:  And it incentivizes participation in that way. That's great. Then what starts to happen here
6481.60s:  is different. This isn't being kicked off because of a lot of transactions in options markets.
6491.20s:  The options markets are busy, but they're not crazy. It's nothing like we saw in the beginning of the
6495.52s:  well, I guess in the middle of the year in the summer. So the movement that you're starting to see
6500.16s:  now is an artifact of people fundamentally valuing the company differently. That's important.
6507.92s:  So taking that all the way back to what I'm reading here saying that hedge funds are essentially
6516.24s:  manipulating the market to drive price down, it can happen. I'm not saying it doesn't. It does
6520.24s:  happen. But if there's underlying value in the company that's seen accepted and understood,
6527.52s:  there will be people that are going to buy it because of the fundamental components of the
6532.64s:  company longer term. And that will in turn put the shorts in a really tough position.
6539.44s:  So it's just not as simple as saying hedge funds are doing blank because hedge funds have a lot
6547.68s:  of resources and power. There's a lot of different hedge funds. We can't bucket them all the same.
6551.76s:  They do different things. They have different imperatives. But there's also a lot of market
6556.48s:  participants with different ideas and approaches. That's important to identify. Okay.
6562.08s:  The next thing this article talks about is connections between various companies and hedge funds,
6566.88s:  points out how hedge funds have stakes in companies like ZEO Group, the ICT Properties,
6570.40s:  Indicating and Network of Investments that Influence Market Behavior completely agree.
6574.64s:  The author notes that stock charts for companies like five below Amazon, Walmart,
6578.88s:  and other show patterns inversely related to GMIs performance. We've looked at this a million times.
6584.00s:  And I think that the correlations are that's you can't like that statement doesn't mean anything.
6591.20s:  Stock charts for companies like five below Amazon and Walmart inversely related to GMIs performance.
6597.92s:  Those are people that are just typically eyeballing a chart. We've done this a bunch of times
6602.24s:  on the live stream that are again seeing what they want to see and not actually doing like a correlation
6608.32s:  analysis or a regression. So I'm not saying that they're not inverted. I don't know in this instance,
6613.52s:  but I would guess that that's the case because companies like Amazon, what did it site?
6621.36s:  Companies like Amazon and Walmart, they're fucking huge.
6628.16s:  So the idea that one of them is being suppressed to prop the other one up would be dubious.
6634.88s:  I don't think that's a fair assertion to make. And then the article warns if GME experiences
6641.04s:  a significant short squeeze, it could trigger similar events across other heavily shorted stocks.
6645.12s:  This could lead to widespread financial repercussions for involved hedge funds.
6648.96s:  Yep, I think we know that. Okay, cool. So now let's zoom in on this one.
6655.84s:  Reverse merger naked shorts in covering the golden bullet.
6663.60s:  Interesting. Well, they didn't I don't think they did this.
6671.12s:  So
6678.32s:  interesting.
6688.40s:  I receive Ventures Games. Stop agreement reserve the right to acquire 19.9,
6692.80s:  take full control, bigger stake. Okay, so yeah, I think we can skip through this one.
6702.40s:  Because this just didn't happen. Oh, here we go.
6708.96s:  Oh, big daddy. Let's see. Oh, shit. He just called social media unverified information
6713.76s:  from unqualified social media. He obviously hasn't seen the details. Superstrike, that's awesome.
6723.36s:  Volume catalyst. We already talked about that a million times. So I agree with the volume component
6730.16s:  hole heartedly. In my opinion, volume is the defining feature of detecting price movement
6737.76s:  in most things, specifically GameStop. It is the only thing I can point out
6744.80s:  that every time there's a big run, it's preceded by volume. And I've not seen that with anything else.
6753.36s:  We've had every kind of interesting idea about what's driving price movement and stuff like
6760.40s:  that. But regardless of all of that, none of them have moved things quite like volume.
6768.08s:  So volume has to be there. I agree with this.
6773.20s:  Here you go. What can you tell us about volume when there hasn't been
6778.88s:  giant volumes? On balance volume. Okay.
6784.32s:  I'm going to take this from my other post. The commonality between all these graphs is
6791.04s:  unbalanced volume continues to increase. Okay.
6800.56s:  Um, okay.
6806.08s:  So one of the issues with this is like drawing any sort of standard technical analysis.
6814.08s:  Lines. I think these are each of Moku clouds, by the way, here if I'm not mistaken, is this right?
6820.40s:  But drawing technical analysis like this off of a squeeze doesn't really make sense in my opinion.
6826.80s:  And the reason why it doesn't make sense is because you have to apply a completely different
6830.64s:  style of technical analysis around squeezes. You can apply standard support. Like think about
6836.80s:  what technical analysis represents. It represents analyzing the relationship between buyers and
6842.24s:  sellers in an open marketplace. So it's looking at price and volume. Well, price and volume as
6850.16s:  represented through supply and demand, those functions have certain inferences we can make from them
6857.28s:  that completely break down during a short squeeze. People that were buying GameStop at $500
6863.36s:  were partially psychotic retail traders that are trying to see how much money they can make hoping
6868.48s:  it goes higher. And I say psychotic just because that's a massive amount of money to pay for a stock
6875.20s:  that just before was down at whatever. So it would have worked if necessarily they weren't stock when
6883.76s:  they turned the buy button off and price was allowed to continue to move. But that's before a
6888.48s:  financial ruin of the markets in which case nobody gets anything. So that part aside, the entities
6895.84s:  that are buying shares there, they're not buying it because they actually think it's valued at
6900.08s:  513. They don't think that the company's fundamentally valued there. They're buying it because they
6904.88s:  quite literally are forced to cover short positions, which is great. Fuck them. But that's not standard
6911.60s:  supply and demand functions. It's very, very unique. So you have to apply a completely different
6918.88s:  methodology. So I actually think drawing lines like basing things off of this is a broken
6925.52s:  methodology. But just because I think it's a broken methodology doesn't mean it doesn't work,
6929.84s:  doesn't mean it's not efficacious. It literally doesn't mean anything like that because technical
6933.92s:  analysis is very much part part science. So they're fully entitled to do that. That's just my personal
6941.84s:  opinion on it. Yep. So I saw it. Ichimoku. I don't see the mac de oscillator and then they've TTM
6951.68s:  squeeze. Yeah. So TTM squeeze, just like a volatility metric, essentially, it uses two different
6959.60s:  volatility tools to measure a ball. Yeah. Okay. So here's all the TA. What's the... I'm not going
6969.68s:  to waste a bunch of time. I just want to see what they're... I like the stock. Anything you take
6974.96s:  away from this remember volume is king. Short squeeze is not happened yet. This is great.
6978.16s:  Volume is king. The short squeeze has not happened yet. I understand what they're inferring here,
6982.16s:  but again, just for clarity sake, a short squeeze absolutely as fucking happened. Probably the
6986.88s:  biggest one that the company will see at least uninterrupted. And I emphasize that point because
6994.48s:  the uninterrupted component is huge. Does this mean that there couldn't be a bigger short squeeze
7000.56s:  in the future? There always could be, right? The worst days depending on what's out of the trade
7004.80s:  around are always ahead. So that I think is completely fair. And to think that there could be a bigger
7011.92s:  squeeze in the future, I think that's completely fair. The problem is at what point does it get stopped?
7019.04s:  That's the problem. And we already know that they stopped the first one. They cut the first one
7022.88s:  short. And the first one was overall lower magnitude. So the the probability of there being
7031.36s:  another short squeeze that's equivalent or bigger, I think would be difficult to justify.
7038.00s:  Again, from a practical standpoint, not from a structural standpoint, not saying that there
7042.16s:  aren't the conditions for it to occur. But at what and this is one of the things that I notice is
7048.40s:  missing from a lot of the diligence and positions people oppose is that we don't
7055.20s:  apply a practical methodology of the fact that it's going to be interrupted, market,
7061.44s:  forces, external will interrupt it just like they already did. So they've already showed that
7069.04s:  they're not willing to allow the financial system to collapse because of this. And again,
7074.32s:  from that perspective, I don't blame them. I don't want the financial system to collapse either
7078.88s:  because of this. But it would be really cool to see if there's a bit of a line that's balanced
7085.04s:  where we actually allow some of the hedge funds and stuff to go out of business as they should.
7092.32s:  And they should be forced to buy it at $500 price. Fuck them. But we should essentially allow
7098.32s:  those hedge funds to run until they are fucked and completely illiquid. And then it should be,
7104.80s:  I think, sequestered so that it doesn't destroy an entire financial system. But
7109.52s:  yeah, this, I understand the sentiment here, but I make that point for everybody because I know
7115.92s:  everybody's really, really interested and hopeful for fur Moas. But one of the things that I haven't
7121.36s:  heard an explanation for which I genuinely am interested, I genuinely, genuinely am interested
7128.56s:  in hearing is how does the theory of Moas apply if this, if the squeeze that's coming is supposedly
7135.76s:  bigger than the squeeze that already happened if the first squeeze was already interrupted. I don't
7141.28s:  understand that logic. Rorynclyd says the thing is if you apply that practicality to a DD and post
7147.04s:  on Reddit, then you're down what into hell and call to shill. Understandably, because it's a community
7152.72s:  and group of people that have been manipulated for as long as they've been around. And I think that
7159.28s:  there is an element of an echo chamber where people don't want to necessarily hear too many things
7165.04s:  that are far too different. But from what I can understand and see from a lot of the ape community,
7170.88s:  it does seem like there's a growing appetite for healthy discourse and exchange of ideas.
7178.08s:  So I think that it's not necessarily that far out in the future where you can have a legitimate
7184.56s:  conversation about these kind of things. I think a lot of the people that get called a shill right
7190.64s:  so are people that are just bad-mouthing things with uninformed opinions and not something that's
7197.04s:  well researched. But for example, the comment I make that a lot of people would call me a shill
7202.88s:  for on there is saying the statement that I don't see a larger squeeze happening if the first squeeze
7212.88s:  was stopped. So but the way that I phrase it as a question because it's a genuine question.
7220.16s:  The genuine question I have is how do we rationalize that there would be a bigger squeeze in the future
7228.24s:  if the smaller squeeze was manually interrupted by market forces?
7236.40s:  And not saying that there's not an answer to it. I hope there is.
7241.84s:  I just don't know what it is. I haven't heard it yet. That's something that I've talked to Newton
7244.88s:  about. And that's something that he and I have talked about on the live stream before
7249.28s:  because there isn't, again, like I just haven't heard a solution to that problem set yet.
7258.40s:  The mystery of negative beta. Okay. Let's zoom this one out and see if we can
7271.84s:  see. This is a cheat code. It still scrolls really slow. But when it scrolls slow, it's doing like
7277.76s:  half a page at a time. So we can get the deets. And then I think we'll probably pause after this one.
7288.88s:  Lauren says retail traders are learning. Gotta give people room to grow. Absolutely. I still think
7293.20s:  GME will pop a little. Oh, absolutely. And again, I want to be super clear. That doesn't mean
7297.84s:  that it can't squeeze. I think GME is one of those companies that's literally primed to squeeze.
7304.00s:  I'm just clarifying the idea of I think we need to be, I think we need to be able to answer the
7315.36s:  question of how does Moas happen if the first squeeze was cut. And if there's a really good answer
7322.32s:  to that, which I would I genuinely would love to hear, then I think that's what I'm interested in
7329.28s:  because just because I don't know the answer, how it might work doesn't mean that there's not
7334.64s:  something there. I just don't know it. And it's an example of why I would never make a post
7341.28s:  of something like, you know, there's no short squeeze, right? Like a lot of the people will say
7346.00s:  were fucked, but they'll share an opinion that's again, is informed as it can be for them.
7353.60s:  But I don't feel comfortable saying something like even that there's not going to be a bigger
7358.96s:  short squeeze. Like I won't say that because I don't know. But what I do know is that there's
7366.16s:  definitely a logical gap that we have to work through. And I don't know the answer to yet.
7371.84s:  Summarize this article. Let's see what this says.
7378.24s:  Ruin Clity says, would change in ways for it to continue, hold on, Ruin Clity says,
7383.52s:  so let me preface by saying I don't personally believe this, but the answer to how could there be a
7387.36s:  bigger squeeze that regulation, both internal and external to the financial system,
7391.12s:  would change in ways for it to continue without interference. Right, but that argument doesn't
7396.24s:  make sense because the reason for interference previously was literally to prevent the meltdown
7406.24s:  of the financial system. So there isn't a scenario where there's enough regulation
7416.16s:  that would allow more risk assumption. Now, I do think that there's a world where the squeeze
7431.44s:  could be permitted to the point where individual hedge funds might literally go bankrupt.
7441.84s:  But I don't think even in a malgamation of a lot of those hedge funds would be enough money
7448.40s:  to yield like this massive, massive squeeze. DCM says bigger squeeze because the first time there
7455.60s:  were several stocks squeezing all at once, two of those companies already went bankrupt. So pressure
7462.32s:  is already less. I don't think that explains it either, in my opinion.
7471.68s:  So to clarify the position I'm offering is the last squeeze was interrupted because
7482.32s:  there was a potential for literally the financial system to collapse.
7486.56s:  That happens when there's a certain amount of risk out that's uncovered for whatever reason
7494.00s:  and that there's enough variance and liquidity that can yield that kind of collapse.
7502.24s:  So if external entities stepped in to stop that from happening previously, I don't see how there
7513.76s:  would be a world where we would permit more risk if the last round of risk was already capped
7520.96s:  lower. Roryn Clity says the way you're talking makes it sound as though you think some sort of pre-existing
7527.12s:  safety triggers were tripped. No, I don't think that. I don't even know if those exist.
7532.08s:  I don't think that at all. The pre-existing safety triggers and stuff like that would be things like
7537.60s:  circuit breakers. But yeah, I think circuit breakers are completely different than that.
7551.36s:  Roryn Clity says what external entities stepped in to stop the last one, the brokers.
7556.32s:  So the brokers across the board turned off the ability to buy shares.
7567.28s:  Lazy says do you think there will ever be any type of accountability for allowing it to get
7571.60s:  this bad? Fuck, I hope. I think that there's a potential but the problem is is that in general,
7578.96s:  the accountability component there is directly disincentivized from the largest constituents of
7587.52s:  the system. So I think that there's a conflict of interest from their perspective to actually gain
7594.16s:  accountability. So I think that you would need to have some sort of very aggressive entity that
7600.72s:  enters SEC, Fenra, like these different oversight commissions and organizations that actually
7608.00s:  doesn't care about the conflict of interest and the potential harm that comes from moving through
7613.12s:  it and pursuing it that way. But there's so much conflict of interest in lobbying that I think
7620.96s:  would be really difficult. Lauren says they weren't expecting GME to do what it did and they took care
7633.04s:  and who they took care of is very telling. I agree with you, fully agree with you.
7637.28s:  BCM says the buy button was turned off because of a massive fake trade that was immediately reversed
7642.00s:  and that's why the buy button was turned off. The financial system wasn't going to collapse
7645.60s:  only some larger. I actually don't agree with that. And I think that the reason why I don't
7652.40s:  agree with that is because there's entities way smarter than I am, petrified one of them.
7658.80s:  That was talking about where that could potentially go because of how pervasive it was.
7666.48s:  So I think that I do think that the entire financial system genuinely was at risk.
7674.40s:  And I think that that's also why there was again a pretty unanimous effort across the board
7683.44s:  to disallow continued investment in it, at least to the long side.
7688.72s:  Matthew says, got a bounce, good livestream. Thanks there. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, it's already been
7693.20s:  two hours. I got to wrap up soon. But let's see what this one says. So this says,
7699.68s:  GameStop's negative beta discusses the the unusually negative beta of GameStop.
7707.68s:  I have to look into that more. Impact of short selling, market manipulation, and short squeeze.
7715.68s:  I don't know how they're arriving at negative beta here.
7723.12s:  Carlos says there will be no GME squeeze, get it through your thick head. I actually don't agree with
7727.04s:  that either. I absolutely think there can be a squeeze. I think the
7736.56s:  nature and level of a squeeze can be different. But yeah.
7743.12s:  All right. Let's add a comment here. This will be 30 no
7762.64s:  of Vivo. This is where we can find that again. Very interesting. So to summarize the multiple
7774.56s:  dds we went through and just kind of at a high level what I'm seeing. I'm seeing a lot of really
7780.88s:  pervasive focus on manipulation, which is fair. The various entities and the relationship between
7789.76s:  entities, which I think is good. I see a lot of confirmation bias in trying to paint a specific
7799.36s:  picture that people want to see, which is very normal. I see a lot of loosely formed opinions with
7814.00s:  respect to future price direction. So example being the one that's talked about we are fucked.
7824.96s:  And then the other one that talked about the TA on GameStop, which is again, that's not a dig at
7833.44s:  any of them. It's just people taking guesses and trying to piece together what they think is going
7838.24s:  to happen. I also see the overwhelming majority of what we've read did not happen, at least in
7848.08s:  terms of price performance so far of GameStop. So the one entity that said we are fucked that obviously
7855.44s:  hadn't happened. The other entity that was talking about the reverse merger that didn't happen.
7862.00s:  The one that was talking about the technical analysis of GameStop and their price projections that
7867.12s:  when didn't happen. And again, I'm not saying this in a judgmental way as if I know it's going to
7871.52s:  happen. I'm no fucking idea. I'm just trying to recount what we went through and what the trends are
7879.60s:  that I can piece together from a high perspective. So a lot of work, a lot of work goes into these.
7887.44s:  The other thing that I definitely can pick up on is the level of interest in GameStop is insane.
7895.52s:  In that people are clearly willing, like that one that was going through the tax shelters and
7901.44s:  stuff. That's a very edge case peripheral topic that somebody spent a lot of time digging into
7909.44s:  the very specific details that they were able to piece together, which is really impressive to me.
7914.32s:  The fact that people do that. It's very cool. It's one of the reasons why I'm so stoked and eager
7920.40s:  to continue learning about GameStop and what we can pick up.
7924.48s:  So I'm excited to keep working through these the DDs that we have. I actually think what I'm
7930.32s:  going to do is split this though, because we're actually making pretty good progress at this point.
7937.60s:  And if I split the document, I should be able to move through it through the AI thing and hear
7945.44s:  a little more efficiently, which would be cool. So before we wrap though, is there anything else
7950.64s:  that you guys want to take a look at? Obviously we'll continue the DD. I think next Saturday.
7956.56s:  Yeah, next Saturday is good. We have a bunch of travel next month. So you'll see me on the mobile
7962.24s:  setup again. But yeah, let me know if there's anything that we want to hit real quick before we
7966.96s:  bounce. As always, thank you guys for hanging out. I think I've been seeing people share in the
7972.16s:  live stream around, which is awesome. I'm really appreciative of that. That really helps me because
7977.60s:  it helps grow our audience, which then helps inform where I get information from. And I essentially
7985.76s:  continue to cast a wider net because you guys are helping me and teaching me. So thank you all for
7992.64s:  for that. Anti-governments, thoughts on archer aviation. These streams are really specific to GameStop.
8000.32s:  So I'm happy to talk about that. Unless you think it's related to GameStop somehow,
8004.64s:  then I'm happy to look at it. But otherwise, you can always bring that up on like the Monday live
8009.28s:  stream or the Friday live stream, something like that. But yeah. All right, guys.
8017.68s:  Abs. Hold on. Runkley says, do we ever put together a full-fledged meme stock portfolio that would
8022.56s:  be cool to take a look at if we already have it? Yeah. So I think we built that a little while ago
8028.24s:  and I was running it for a little bit. And then I reconfigured the live schedule. So right now,
8039.44s:  we can probably talk about it on Monday during the Monday live stream at some point. That would be okay.
8045.76s:  But yeah, right now the live streams are Monday is YouTube Wednesday is outlier pro. Friday is
8055.44s:  options trading basics. Saturday GameStop, Sunday, outlier pro, and then Tuesday, Thursday is kind
8062.32s:  of just trader hangout as it's coined now. It's just a chance to bullshit for a little bit and talk
8067.04s:  markets. So UCM King says, GME isn't a meme stock in my opinion. That's a completely fair opinion
8074.16s:  to have. I think it objectively is. But I think it's because people have a really negative
8081.68s:  connotation of meme stock and I don't think it's a negative connotation. I literally think,
8085.92s:  based on the original definition, when we started that series about meme stocks, it's literally
8091.60s:  stocks that are popularly talked about. And I don't think that that's a negative connotation at all.
8097.04s:  I think a lot of people apply a negative connotation that it's like some sort of like uninformed
8101.84s:  position or stuff like that, which I would agree. Like I don't think that's it at all. And I also
8107.04s:  don't think GameStop's price mover right now is just hype at all. I think GameStop has a
8117.12s:  completely viable underlying business and they're starting to pivot. So that's what I think.
8125.12s:  All right, y'all. Enjoy the rest of your weekend for the outlier pro members. Don't forget to do
8129.76s:  your performance AAR for the month so that we can review them tomorrow. Be an outlier. I will see
8135.68s:  you all later.
