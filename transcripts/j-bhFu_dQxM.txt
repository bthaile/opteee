556.00s: I
560.00s: Right, I think that's correct.
562.40s: Is that right?
563.72s: I did this last time.
565.60s: I did the same exact game last time.
567.80s: And it took me too long to figure out how to find where I was.
571.60s: There is a way for me to find my comment, maybe in here at it.
578.00s: Hmm.
581.00s: Yo.
583.00s: Add a comment.
585.00s: Where are the stuff is in here?
587.00s: Um, roaring clities says, because we chat a bit about your favorite DD that you read
597.16s: on your own this week.
598.64s: No, so all the DDs that I'm reading, they're the old ones that we're skimming through.
604.64s: So it's just so that I'm not missing anything.
607.60s: I'm not my, I'm actually very purposefully moving in line with you all on the live streams
613.24s: as I'm opening up new DDs.
615.88s: But for some of the older DDs that we've already taken a look at, we've gone through
620.32s: and we've kind of skim through some of the stuff just because again, some of them are
625.32s: pretty long.
626.56s: So I'm not actually, yeah, I'm not actually like opening up new stuff yet.
635.96s: Richard's no access control P. I, I want to trust you.
640.68s: I want to trust you, but I'm just, I'm nervous that that's going to come.
645.84s: All right, let's do it control P.
647.84s: No, that's print.
650.00s: That's control print.
653.84s: I was like, what?
657.84s: Well, it's, don't worry, it doesn't automatically start printing.
664.68s: Um, all right.
666.68s: Yo, let's get, let's get your eyes on the same thing I'm looking at here so that you guys
672.00s: can tell me where to find, where to find the bookmark.
676.00s: I'll tell you, I'm, I'm real, real savvy with the old tech stuff.
682.08s: No, no, no, no, no, there's literally got to be a way to view comments.
689.76s: Here it goes.
693.04s: I was going to say it cannot be this terrible.
698.80s: See, that's the thing is you have to go to something that calls ad comments as compared
702.40s: to like view comments, which is stupid.
709.92s: That Lawrence has stopped trusting people.
711.76s: You know, it's the, the P didn't make me super nervous because I figured that it was
717.44s: some sort of print hot key.
720.32s: I didn't know what it was, but yeah, I, I, I know how people can play on the inner webs.
727.28s: All right.
727.60s: So this is where we left off slimy.
730.56s: So how do I delete this?
731.76s: That's beautiful.
733.12s: And let's get into this is how the cards part three.
739.68s: All right.
740.24s: Here we go.
740.80s: So we already know that there's instances where short interest is understated and we know
746.40s: that short interest has exceeded total float.
750.08s: We know this.
752.24s: Um, we know that companies have been misreporting their short
756.72s: interest.
757.36s: This is also Lauren says we don't do new things and we don't trust people.
764.48s: Got it.
765.36s: Lauren, I'm actually going to start.
767.52s: I'm actually going to start to use that as my, my ritual before I come on the live streams.
774.32s: Is don't trust anybody, but Lauren and don't do new things.
780.80s: That's what we got to do.
782.96s: All right.
784.56s: Um,
786.24s: yes, we know this when the SEC relies on reports that broker dealers provide,
790.16s: Finnewert takes years to reveal the lies within these reports.
793.12s: This is a little inflammatory.
794.96s: Have to be honest.
796.72s: I understand.
799.76s: I understand what they're saying, but I do think it's a little more inflammatory than it
806.88s: probably needs to be.
807.68s: By the way, what color highlight do you guys like?
809.36s: Do you like like traditional yellow?
812.64s: What's your vibe for the highlights?
814.80s: This is too dark of a yellow, I think.
818.80s: Oh, no, that's okay.
819.92s: That looks like a nice yellow.
821.60s: I can do this orange insulment orange.
825.60s: Who uses orange for highlighting?
828.96s: Really?
832.08s: That just looks weird.
834.24s: I don't know about no orange highlights.
836.24s: Y'all all right, fine.
837.20s: Let's, I'm a man of the people.
839.12s: I'll put it to a fucking poll.
842.08s: Highlight color.
844.32s: There's going to be a lot of shit that we have to highlight together.
850.64s: Yellow, orange.
854.08s: Definitely not blue.
854.96s: Blue is not a choice here.
856.16s: I don't fuck with blue like that.
858.00s: What are the choices do we have?
861.60s: We got lilac, light purple,
865.12s: light purple.
871.04s: Let's see what you guys pick.
872.48s: Whatever you guys pick, that's what I'll use.
877.12s: I guess there's green.
878.32s: Fuck, I forgot to add green, whatever.
886.40s: Right now we're 57 orange.
890.64s: Which, I mean, to be honest, it kind of makes sense, right?
894.80s: Because I always rock with the Mandarin orange or the mango orange.
901.52s: I guess that actually makes sense.
907.12s: All right, 50% orange.
909.44s: We'll call it done there.
910.40s: That's so it shall be orange.
912.40s: It is.
913.68s: Do we like dark orange or light orange?
915.84s: This is the light orange.
918.96s: That's the dark orange.
925.76s: It shall be orange.
927.44s: Feel like the orange is the right one.
929.36s: Yeah, okay, agreed.
930.72s: Feel like this is the correct choice.
932.64s: All right, awesome.
935.68s: Let's continue.
940.00s: Broker dealer can lie without immediately facing the consequences.
943.52s: Again, so here's the thing.
946.88s: One of the things to highlight on a side,
951.68s: when we're looking at this is my approach to analyzing stuff is genuinely
959.44s: to try and remain as objective as humanly possible.
962.40s: Like that is exactly what I try to do.
965.60s: The problem that I take with the word lie here is that it paints a picture holistically
972.24s: that the reporting is being purposefully misreported by everybody across the board into perpetuity.
980.88s: And that might just be the general inference.
983.76s: And I'm not saying whether that's right or wrong.
986.56s: But for me, I would frame it more as like misreporting.
990.80s: Whether it's driven by purposeful intent,
993.52s: that's something that we would get into in specific instances.
996.56s: But there is a reality that a lot of these institutions do have massive reporting functions.
1004.40s: And it's not always perfect.
1006.64s: Look at any job you've ever worked at and look at the required paperwork following, filing,
1013.36s: process.
1014.48s: It's never perfect.
1015.68s: There's always errors.
1017.52s: So all I'm saying is that I wouldn't feel comfortable chalking up the reporting.
1022.56s: Always forever, unanimously across all instances being lies, being purposefully done.
1030.32s: Is that the majority of cases?
1032.16s: I don't know.
1032.64s: Maybe it definitely seems like it's known in certain circumstances without a fucking doubt.
1038.16s: So I'm not saying that there's not lying going on.
1040.56s: There absolutely seems to be.
1042.80s: But I try to emphasize that point specifically.
1049.04s: Roryntitty, hey, what up, Roryntitty?
1051.04s: Roryntitty says, GME is a shit ton of errors over and over and over again.
1054.40s: Here's the problem.
1056.32s: If you are to look around, have you ever had this sensation while you're driving?
1063.20s: You just get a new car or maybe you got a used car and your car is white.
1068.40s: Or if you watch family guy and you like cool whip, it's white.
1073.68s: And as you're driving around all of a sudden, you start seeing all these white cars.
1080.56s: You're like, where the fuck did all of these white cars come from?
1084.48s: They're everywhere.
1085.20s: I've never seen as many white cars in my life.
1087.84s: I just got a white car.
1089.20s: Everybody obviously is just vibing with me in my white car.
1093.76s: You know exactly what that is.
1096.80s: Right?
1098.00s: It's an attribution that mentally happens when you pick something of interest
1104.32s: and you begin looking for it.
1106.32s: You have a white car.
1107.36s: You like white cars.
1108.56s: You just bought your white car.
1110.40s: Everybody now is a white car.
1112.32s: So with GameStop, I notice that the default everybody has is that everything is fucked.
1119.60s: It's all manipulated.
1120.88s: This is all being done on purpose.
1122.88s: And it's because they're clearly our instances that it has happened.
1128.96s: I'm not saying that it's not the case.
1131.44s: It could be the case for sure.
1133.12s: It could be.
1134.08s: But what I'm saying is with especially the GameStop crowd, the default that we tend to see
1141.68s: is manipulation is lies is stuff like that because it's what we're looking for.
1147.92s: Fun fact, if you go into any other stock, you will find some of these same things.
1154.56s: Not saying the same exact things.
1156.08s: Not saying to the same degree.
1157.52s: I'm not saying anything like that.
1159.36s: What I'm saying is that if you look at Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo magically opens up new accounts
1166.16s: for people that don't exist.
1168.96s: It's complete and utter bullshit.
1171.44s: There are other instances where Wells Fargo was thought to have opened up bullshit
1177.44s: accounts for people.
1178.56s: They were starting to become ostracized for it.
1181.04s: And then after an external audit, it actually turned out that they didn't do it.
1185.76s: So it's just important to try to remain objective when we're trying to read this information
1193.60s: because it is subconsciously going to skew our further analysis and our understanding
1201.76s: as we progress along.
1204.40s: So I go into that whole tirade just to highlight the term lies here.
1210.32s: I think starts to send people down a certain mental path inherently.
1216.16s: And you should just be aware of it.
1217.84s: You could fully agree with it.
1219.12s: That's cool.
1220.08s: But a lot of people they'll just read this stuff.
1222.32s: They'll take it as face value.
1224.64s: They'll say, oh, yeah, these motherfuckers are purposely lying to us all the time.
1228.24s: And that's now the base going forward.
1231.12s: And it should be a conscious choice if that's what you choose to believe.
1235.20s: If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
1239.84s: What is that?
1240.32s: I think that's a rush song.
1243.44s: I think it's a rush song.
1244.56s: Let's go.
1246.56s: The broker dealer can lie without immediately facing consequences, which we saw.
1252.96s: And here's another thing to highlight in addition to this realistically.
1257.36s: The fact that the consequences aren't that fucking bad.
1261.28s: Right? So I think in the last DD, this is what, yeah, these we were, I was on my little tiny setup.
1266.96s: So it's hard for me to read all the details.
1269.68s: But I mean, the penalties are fucking jokes.
1275.04s: Even a $600,000 fine, that sounds kind of aggro.
1279.76s: But for somebody like Goldman Sachs,
1282.96s: it's a cost to do a business dog.
1284.72s: They don't even fucking care.
1286.48s: So another thing to highlight is not just the immediacy component, which is there,
1291.04s: but there's the severity component, which is the punishment is so non-severe
1296.00s: that why would they care?
1297.68s: They don't care.
1299.44s: It allows firms to operate in a high risk environment without exposing how big their risk appetite is.
1304.56s: Another example, West mentioned Merrill Lynch, find 450k in 16 for using securities held in their
1310.96s: customers accounts to cover their own trades. That's fine.
1320.00s: I need to click into this.
1321.76s: Yeah, this looks okay. Run it.
1337.52s: Let's see.
1340.08s: Now for a quick highlight, sometimes people will ask me like, Eric, why,
1346.24s: why have you become so obsessed and spend so much time looking at GameStop?
1352.00s: And I've given the reason a bunch of different times, but I want to highlight a specific element
1357.04s: of that because if you were to post on a place like X, and if you were to post,
1366.40s: do you think Merrill Lynch is doing this?
1370.32s: Most people would probably say, yeah, I believe so.
1375.04s: And it's just because of the way that the question is framed and most people are distrustful
1379.68s: of larger financial institutions. But if we were to take an actually well-framed objective
1386.56s: question for this, I don't think a lot of people are aware. My self included that this is a
1393.04s: fucking thing. I did not know this. And it is classic. This is one of the reasons why GameStop
1400.40s: is so cool. So what I'm actually going to do is highlight this, grab a screenshot,
1414.72s: and you know, the next step is just throw this shit on X so that people can come take a look
1423.92s: at the fun facts for themselves and see what they think. Not GME, identifying continued
1439.84s: systemic fraud again.
1461.92s: Perfect.
1462.40s: Unclothed salamanders says, hi, on topic of bone cone 35, please advise if be bone. It's a great
1474.88s: question. First off, thank you so much for the dollar 99. You know I'm cheap, right? Because when
1480.40s: I watch that my buddy was sending me a stream like a clip from another stream where people were
1487.68s: throwing this person tons of money during the stream. It was actually really impressive.
1491.92s: But they stopped taking like the lower dollar amount submissions and like skipping over those
1498.08s: for the expensive ones. But I tell you what, dollar 99 get my attention every time. I'm here for you.
1504.08s: But like we talked about on Friday, the probability of being bone there was pretty low. So the
1511.20s: probability for this coming week is I surmise also likely fairly low. We can take a quick look
1520.00s: just so that we know exactly what it do be. Let's grab a good old GameStop. And then let's take a look
1532.56s: at our probabilities. And then let's take a look at the probability of a touch just like Catholic
1540.40s: priests. And let's take a look at a touch of 35. 22% is what it's rolling at as it currently sits.
1554.40s: Holy shit, this is 378 pages. Fuck. Oh my god, there's gotta be a fucking
1571.12s: Oh boy. I'm still just in the fucking addresses. Here we go.
1584.80s: Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions and to the entry
1589.52s: of findings that the firm inaccurately reported certain of its listed option positions to the
1594.72s: large option position reporting system, Loper, good old Loper, y'all know about Loper.
1599.52s: In violation of New York sausage change American rule 906, the findings stated that there were
1604.40s: approximately 13,190 instances in which there were inconsistencies between the short positions held
1612.08s: in the firm's accounts that required reporting to the Loper. And the short positions that the firm
1617.84s: actually had reported to Loper in these instances, the firm had inaccurately reported its
1623.68s: reportable options positions to Loper because of proprietary system flaw,
1627.76s: cause the firm to omit the short contract quantities from being reported to Loper,
1633.44s: infirm accounts that held short straddles the firm subsequently corrected this flaw.
1638.72s: So we can look at this and we can say two things. The first thing is we can say,
1647.36s: don't believe them system flaw complete bullshit they're lying. We can say believable systems
1654.72s: do be flowing sometimes plausible. This one individual instance I would be
1663.68s: indifferent. One instance indifferent. There's 55 disclosures in here and it looks like, again,
1674.24s: you can look at 55 instances and you could say, well, that's obviously a big problem.
1679.76s: And it might be, it might not be. The reason why I say it might not be is when you look at a
1684.48s: company as big as Merrill Lynch doing is much business as they are, like their mistakes are going
1692.16s: to be at a magnitude that to the normal person will sound crazy. But to affirm that's doing billions
1698.72s: of dollar business internationally, it's super complex. So it's not insane for it to have issues
1707.20s: like this. So the problem here and that I don't know the answer to yet, which I'm actually going to
1715.12s: see if there's anything that I can find relating to it. I'm going to download this and I'm going to
1722.08s: throw it into GPT. And what I want to do is see if there's any evidence of purposeful misreporting.
1733.60s: And again, that's not to suggest that there isn't even if this says that there isn't. But I want to
1738.72s: start there going back to what I tell you guys all the time. My goal is objective analysis. So
1747.12s: read this Finra report and search for any evidence of purposeful
1756.96s: purposeful misreporting or gross negligence of reporting. Let's see what it says. I'm actually
1766.24s: curious what that'll come back with. It's running right now. I'll let you know.
1783.44s: Okay.
1784.00s: The regulatory arbitration disclosures they indicate 55 regulatory events in one arbitration event
1800.24s: disclosures about the firm and its control. These events involve regulatory action, civil
1803.92s: judicial proceedings and financial matters that perform the firm is required to disclose.
1808.56s: Failure to file suspicious activity reports. SARS. They were fined six million. We're failing to
1818.00s: establish adequate policies and controls for reporting suspicious activities as required by the
1823.04s: Bank Superse act. The firm failed nearly 1500 SARS over a decade due to applying an incorrect
1830.80s: monetary threshold for reporting suspicious activities. You oversight suggests the significant
1835.84s: lapse in compliance with regulatory requirements and potentially amongst and potentially accounting
1842.00s: to or amounting to gross negligence. Okay. Misuse of customer cash. Here we go.
1848.00s: Merrill Lynch was also involved in a case where it misuse customer cash generate profits for the firm.
1852.24s: The SEC found that Merrill Lynch violated the customer protection rule by engaging in complex
1857.12s: options trades that artificially reduced the required deposit of customer cash and reserve accounts.
1863.28s: This violation exposed customers to significant risks and resulted in 450 million settlement with the
1869.52s: SEC. That that is a glaring issue to me. That kind of thing is not like the and again, you guys
1877.60s: hopefully you can tell hopefully by now when I'm looking at this stuff, I always apply
1883.84s: skeptical lens and benefit of the doubt. And it's because I want to find information that is
1892.40s: as representative of reality as possible. This is a massive fucking issue and you don't do this
1898.40s: by mistake. There's no world here that they're using customer profits or customer cash to generate
1908.08s: like there's no fucking way. So this is this is crazy to me. Also fun fact. I don't know if you
1915.92s: guys know from X there's a dude named Kevin. What the fuck's his last name? He talks about GameStop
1924.16s: a lot. There's a dude named Kevin something that talks about GameStop a lot, but I connected with him
1929.36s: and the game plan. I'm actually going to do a podcast episode with him. And this is one of the things
1936.32s: that I want to talk to him about because I think he's from the professional management side.
1941.44s: Thank you. Day swag. That's it. Malone. Kevin Malone. And we're going to I want to bring him on
1946.96s: the podcast. I don't think we'll do it on a live stream. I think we'll do it on a podcast so that
1951.60s: we can get a little deeper in a detail. I love you guys know I love doing live streams with you
1956.40s: guys, but sometimes it's difficult to be as interactive as I like with somebody else on a live
1962.64s: stream when it's typically like me just interacting with them. So, but I want to talk about this
1968.96s: kind of stuff from their perspective. Negligent misrepresentation in annuity sales. There's a
1975.04s: lawsuit filed alleging negligent misrepresentation by brokers regarding the features of variable
1980.48s: annuity sold by retired customer. The claim involves allegations of professional
1985.12s: malpractice and failure to disclose high internal costs associated with the annuity.
1989.28s: Give or take. This one is the worst to me. That one's like fucking egregious. That's nuts.
1997.84s: Okay. Don't worry y'all. We are now past the first page of this single DD. Lord help me.
2010.72s: Remember when we mentioned in SEA 15C three the case with A packs they were asking customers to
2019.76s: book short positions to either cash account or short margin account protects these customers from
2024.00s: a lot of brokers. Yeah. Okay. So we just we just read all this stuff.
2029.76s: Merrill made it sound like a yo. Lauren I don't know if you know this but you and your long legs
2039.20s: have a secret admirer in day swag. In case you guys don't know there might be a love story
2045.84s: unfolding in front of our eyes with day swag and Lauren because day swag like most of us is enamored
2052.32s: by Lauren's crazy long legs. So I just I hope that you guys have a chance to you know just turn it
2063.12s: into a a budding relationship wrapped around GME. So we read all this.
2072.80s: Sure exposure interest unknown. Yeah. Okay. Yep. 64 occasions 45 occasions they continue to
2081.12s: accept customer short set orders and securities which had active fail to deliver. This isn't as
2088.16s: crazy as you think it might be. Oh I can hold on I can generate an image. Hold on I got to see
2096.40s: what that would generate. Yo. Fucking let me know. I just want this generate an image.
2105.92s: Sure. What do we get? Is it going? Looks like it's going. Let's see what it gives us.
2122.72s: What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Is that hair? For those cheekbones. Does she have like two
2137.68s: tear cheekbones? And where's the fucking rest of her glasses? And where's this arrow coming from?
2149.84s: He just says like a little fucking arrow thing. Now that's a beast of a comb over.
2157.84s: And he has multiple name tags which is good. All right great. Now that we know what AI thinks this
2164.56s: looks like which is fantastic. Lauren says long legs and goal chains get some every time. Lauren
2173.52s: you got to not sell yourself short because if you remember your goal chain has diamonds in it.
2178.40s: So it's a diamond studded goal chain and you also I think you had a cell phone in one of the
2185.52s: masterpieces. So I have to be honest if I ever do merch and do it make like t-shirts one of them
2192.08s: is going to have to be the the Lauren drawings because that would just be fucking hilarious to have.
2198.08s: I would love to walk around with that on a shirt and just have everybody look at that and be like
2202.48s: what the fuck is on that shirt? And I just like yeah you wouldn't understand. Like you you
2206.88s: clearly don't understand art when it's right in front of your eyes. So there's no helping you.
2216.00s: Yes we know this we know this. Okay so this is just we know all this stuff.
2224.40s: I'm always down to laugh at the ass clowns we know this. We know this.
2232.96s: Okay.
2239.60s: What is this thing?
2244.64s: No no no let me click this.
2249.92s: I don't want to edit the fucking text bro. Just want to click the link. Thank you.
2256.00s: All right. I've already read this. I assume you guys have as well.
2271.60s: The profitability.
2280.56s: Whoops stock manipulation. This is a this is a fucking I love this shit.
2290.88s: This is so awesome. I just love that again like this goes back the same thing I've been talking about
2298.80s: that I really respect about the apes. It is the fact that as a broad group the eight like the
2312.48s: fact that the apes are citing something like this in here is very cool is very very cool to me.
2320.96s: So now I'm going to add another document into this.
2328.00s: And I'm going to have a GPT summarise this research paper.
2335.84s: Fucking awesome.
2339.28s: SEC recently adopted but we know about reg show coming online to tighten restrictions short selling
2344.32s: curve abuse of short sales. Yeah. Yeah. Paper models the market equilibrium when short selling
2349.28s: is permitted in contrast to equilibrium with them without manipulators among the short sellers.
2354.00s: I explain how naked short selling can routinely occur within the securities clearing system.
2360.00s: Yep. Oh wow. This is cool. That's really cool.
2372.24s: Called floating price convertible securities can resolve the unraveling problem and enable
2377.04s: manipulator short selling to intensify. This is sick.
2382.96s: All right. Let's see what GPT tells us. Okay.
2390.88s: Research paper explores the dynamics and potential for abuse and short selling. Okay.
2396.88s: Paper discusses SEC's adoption of reg show aimed at tightening restrictions on short selling
2401.36s: to curb practices such as naked short selling. Naked short selling occurs when a seller we already
2405.92s: know all that market equilibrium and manipulation the paper models market equilibrium with and
2410.40s: without manipulators among short sellers. It highlights how manipulators can exploit naked short
2415.28s: selling to create artificial supply demand and balances thereby driving down stock prices.
2419.28s: We have to find that section specifically. Then there's floating price convertible securities
2424.16s: which I want to read about. A significant focus is on floating price convertible securities which
2430.24s: can exacerbate manipulative short selling. These securities law for conversion equity at a floating
2435.28s: price which can be manipulated downward through aggressive short selling just before conversion dates.
2439.44s: Next historical context and techniques to pay provide historical context recording manipulative
2443.76s: short selling tracing back to bear raids in the 17th century. What the fuck? It describes how these
2451.04s: techniques have gotten have evolved over time and continue to post challenges for market regulation.
2455.76s: Impact of short sale manipulation. Finnerty analyzes the impact of manipulative short sales on
2461.84s: market equilibrium showing that such activities can destabilize the stock prices under my market
2465.84s: efficiency. The presence of active traders who might mistake manipulators from form investors
2470.24s: further facilitates this manipulation. Fascinating. Fucking fascinating.
2478.96s: First things first.
2483.92s: This is old but I need to see if I can find this dude.
2486.96s: You have he does have an email.
2496.08s: Let me give me a second y'all I'm I'm gonna email this dude. I want to see if I can bring them on the podcast.
2516.80s: I'm just writing a standard email scene if you want to join the podcast. I run a YouTube
2539.76s: channel designed to share the world of finance and trading with retail investors
2549.60s: removing the typical finance BS. I'd love to host you on my podcast to discuss your findings
2563.92s: in your paper and recent market developments.
2574.64s: John responds that would be cool.
2583.36s: All right back back at it. What kind of mouse do you guys use? Do you guys use like the mouse
2591.36s: that moves around? I use one of these. I really like this thing.
2600.88s: It was just like wielding it with my left hand realizing that it's not left hand friendly.
2605.52s: Obviously at all it's very one-sided. Okay so the specific terms that I want to look for in here
2612.64s: are equilibrium. So let's find that. So find oh I think I can use the AI assistant.
2622.08s: Oh this is cool I forgot. I don't even have to fucking throw it in GPT anymore.
2628.96s: Let's see how well this thing does.
2643.76s: Let's put this out.
2646.48s: This section discusses the impact of market manipulators on equilibrium entry of a manipulator
2651.92s: affects market equilibrium. We know if the informed investors is shorting shares optimally it
2656.80s: becomes unprofitable for the manipulators. So shares okay. Can either be pooling or separating
2662.48s: equilibrium pooling equilibrium is more likely at the cost of shorting is high.
2667.76s: Okay.
2673.76s: Wow one of my beard hairs must that shares got stuck in the can.
2681.44s: We're already out of the mango orange. We're on to this to the backup. This one's blackberry.
2686.56s: The blackberry one is good but it's it's unfortunately not mango orange. All right.
2695.76s: A pooling equilibrium is more likely when the cost of shorting. So this talks about the
2700.16s: conditions that it occurs. We know all about naked short selling at this point.
2717.60s: And
2718.56s: it like does suggest I want to ask a specific question just let me fucking type my
2729.28s: let me type my fucking question and dude the hell. Well we'll keep scrolling through here.
2739.52s: There was one other piece that I specifically wanted to read which was about the floating price.
2743.68s: Well finally there's like a certain number of questions whatever. Fine I don't need to ask you
2757.52s: no questions do it myself floating price. Okay. Recent securities innovation called floating
2765.12s: price convertible securities removes an important constraint of sorts selling by resolving the
2769.20s: unraveling problem. Okay. Oh it's starting from where we're at.
2778.72s: Does this not show me like the oh whoa. I don't need that. I like when it just shows me like
2788.72s: on a word doc where it is. And the order so that I can skip to where I want it to look.
2805.20s: Okay. Popular private equity financing instrument floating price convertible securities
2809.76s: can resolve the unraveling problem because the manipulator doesn't have to buy back shares
2813.28s: in the open market can obtain as many conversion shares as needed by short selling the price
2818.48s: downward just prior to the conversion notice date. The flawed structure of the floating price
2823.28s: convertibles contract may actually give security holders an incentive to manipulate the
2826.64s: issuers share price downwards. Damn. Huh.
2841.04s: This can increase the profitability of manipulative short selling because he faces less risk of
2845.36s: a short squeeze the manipulator can sell short more shares. So I get it. The greater selling
2851.20s: further reduces from share price increases manipulators profit. Yeah. I get it. Okay.
2856.56s: Cool. Love that great paper.
2865.60s: Part of communications short float.
2871.12s: Okay. I like that one.
2876.00s: Okay.
2881.84s: Lauren says there's a trading channel and they were talking about one of their start in terms of
2885.68s: skill reddit. Uh, skilled at getting trending trades from people on X and reddit found that
2891.04s: interesting. Yeah. Definitely. So there's if you're if you're not familiar, most brokerage platforms
2897.84s: now they actually have a specific series of indicators for market sentiment in popularity because
2905.12s: you literally can trade and run those. It's like very, very, very reasonable to do.
2912.00s: The problem is it's the same timing thing as you see with anything else and you can easily find
2916.64s: the stuff just by looking for volume. So yeah, but definitely the short term momentum is is
2923.60s: highly tradable. There's absolutely no no doubt about it.
2929.92s: That's why people like opening range breakouts and stuff so much because you can trade those
2934.32s: really well, which actually speaking of my there was a couple short term trades that I had in
2946.08s: GameStop that I haven't looked at. I still have my longer term stuff. Yeah. Okay.
2952.40s: What is this? My attempt to amalgamate multiple pieces of dds. Uh oh, this is going to get confusing
2968.32s: because this the thing that we're reading now is already a composite dd that's now being
2973.68s: composited by more composites. Fuck. All right. And we go. This thing somewhere is this section.
2991.68s: There's no way this is going to scroll that slow. That can't be real.
2995.04s: Fun fact, it looks like it can be real. How is it scrolling this slow?
3005.44s: Yeah, there's no way.
3007.76s: Hey.
3015.92s: Let me upload this into GPT.
3023.60s: And let me see if GPT can handle it.
3030.24s: The biggest document. So I might end up having to split this thing up just for efficiency sake.
3036.88s: Right now, uh, GPT is loading it. What I'm going to do is ask you. Okay. So I'm going to ask GPT to summarize this
3046.32s: section. Summarize this section. Chaos theory. The everything connection. Every.
3058.64s: Let's see if it can summarize that section.
3074.08s: Let's see. It's trying. That would be great if it could.
3080.80s: Oh, here we go. It's doing it. This is great. Okay. So the section chaos theory that everything
3090.24s: connection from the diamond handbook appears or exploits the application of chaos theory to financial
3094.80s: markets. It does not know how chaos theory can explain unpredictable and complex behaviors and
3100.24s: financial systems. Okay. Here we go. Interconnected systems. The section posits that the financial
3106.32s: markets are interconnected systems where small changes can lead to significant impacts akin to
3110.88s: the butterfly effect in chaos theory. This interconnectedness suggests that minor events or
3115.44s: trades can trigger larger market movements leading to volatility. Miner events. What does that mean?
3124.48s: What does what do they mean by minor events? Let's see if I can find that minor.
3136.72s: I'm curious that because the term minor event to me is very specific. Okay.
3156.88s: Let's see if I can flip through some of this.
3158.88s: Context. What's going on in the hood? Yeah. Yeah. I love this. One of my favorite parts so far is the fact
3174.80s: that they literally introduced themselves as their Reddit handle. It's the only like look at this.
3182.08s: My name is Shark bait LOL. Imagine just walking up somebody like, yeah, my name is Shark bait LOL.
3189.68s: Over the last couple of weeks, Paradise investigate the story. He'll start something bigger.
3195.20s: I have prior to myself in a career at Data Scientist. This is interesting. One of the interesting
3199.60s: things about this is the timing of these. Like the majority of these is actually after the initial
3206.64s: squeeze. So for a lot of these people, they were actually in a very, very quiet period. Let me grab
3214.88s: trading view. Then let's grab GME.
3229.20s: So this person posted April 11th 2021. 2021. Oh man, that's brutal.
3242.40s: So I'm seeing a lot of the DD come through and hear where we saw one pop in June and then just
3255.36s: down until this year. Rough timing. It's interesting to see a lot of this DD coming out like
3271.44s: after the squeeze just temporally related. David says, just popping in,
3276.96s: loved your opinion on GME being a profit sell off on Friday. Short volume is crazy low,
3282.64s: unless it wasn't unless that isn't something to look for. That's fine.
3289.84s: It's it's not so much like I don't look at it that way specifically from the context of
3296.32s: against short volume, but I look at it against the broader context of how the underlying is moving.
3302.40s: That's that's the main thing that I'm paying attention to personally.
3307.28s: All right, let's continue here.
3312.48s: Yes, it's yes.
3315.92s: Susquejana. All right, I'm going to read this.
3327.20s: Now we have,
3336.56s: appealing new DTCC regs to make things weirder, growing position prompted me to start doing a deep dive,
3344.48s: doubled in size since the part of the start of the pandemic. Interesting.
3349.04s: So this looks like they're just like exploring the the structural conflict of interest and whatnot
3358.16s: from within Susquejana.
3365.92s: You know, I don't see anything in here about the chaos theory. I'm starting to think that
3371.28s: UBT just went fucking rogue.
3374.08s: UBT didn't say anything about Susquejana.
3379.44s: Yeah, I think UBT went absolute rogue.
3387.76s: Yep, so they're rich.
3389.44s: Other address saw
3400.88s: biggest tax game in the world. Yep.
3408.32s: That's this is normal though. Yeah, this is just tax.
3412.08s: So for those that don't know, I'll take a pause here to talk about some of these things.
3419.12s: And there are a lot of ways to very smartly decrease your tax liabilities,
3427.84s: depending on how you structure. As your total resources start to grow, you spend more time
3434.64s: learning about stuff like this. It was a couple of years ago that I started doing a ton of research
3439.76s: and meeting with different kinds of attorneys and tax preparers to learn more about how this
3446.80s: stuff works out of curiosity. Now, the interesting thing is that something like this,
3453.28s: depending on how it's structured, can be illegal. It can be perfectly legally set up. So I'm
3460.08s: actually really curious what it thinks about this. Because right now we're essentially just
3467.84s: highlighting a tax shelter.
3477.76s: So now we're getting into like the location of stuff.
3486.88s: Here we go. What do you think is wrong right? Even loophole location is blank to 9.5
3491.20s: billions of taxes have been evaded as a result of this location. So yeah, because I mean like this,
3496.80s: I understand the point that people are making. And the other thing is that they're, again,
3502.32s: they're making the wrong comparison here. Just saying like the number of businesses is part of
3508.72s: the equation, but you can have a lot of entities in a small space. Now obviously this is clearly
3516.08s: people that are tax sheltering. But I'm curious like what the tax shelter angle means to them.
3523.36s: Because I just, I haven't seen that yet.
3532.80s: How is Citadel evolved? Well, it turns out they have an entity tied to the Uglund House. Of course,
3538.88s: it's right. The same entity connected. Yeah.
3546.00s: Citadel operating multiple places.
3555.04s: I'm struggling to understand what they're
3562.48s: like.
3567.04s: Connection between Black Rock, Swiss and Citadel, Palafol.
3573.44s: Hey, but what's the, I don't understand the implication. Like why?
3577.76s: Whether or not there's a connection between these entities, my default is rich, powerful entities
3586.32s: all know and operate with one another. So I don't even think like taking the time to attempt
3591.84s: to prove it per se unless there's a direct implication of this explicit combination of the three of
3598.40s: them. Also the fact that they share the same kind of tax entities like again, like smart resource
3609.04s: rich entities are going to do their best to be as efficient as possible. So the fact that they're
3617.44s: using the Uglund House or other kind of tax shelters, again, I'm not saying it's good or bad. I
3623.52s: just, I don't understand the implication that they're trying to draw from that yet. If you guys know,
3628.32s: let me know. I love this little drawing, though, this is rad. Yeah, here we go. Connection between this
3645.28s: is incredibly complex moving pieces. Yep, 5d chess game. Okay. Black Rock isn't just looking to
3652.72s: kill off Melvin, maybe working with the government and said to make some major changes happen to
3658.48s: the market. Okay. And goal. Yeah, bro, not entirely obvious to me yet. I mean, I don't,
3672.16s: that just seems like a lot, a lot of work and effort and tying obscure components together to
3681.84s: arrive at something that I think we all know, which is any sort of powerful organization is going to
3688.32s: try to push this agenda and inform the development of the landscape as it's relevant to it.
3694.40s: Like I think that that's just a granted. I think we all kind of know that. So this, I have to be
3701.52s: honest, was a little, it's a little unclear to me like what the specific thing is, but this,
3713.68s: this is the part that I would want to see the author define more so that I could actually
3717.68s: understand what the, like what the perspective and what the implications of the perspective are.
3724.24s: Because again, like what I'm reading here is, yeah, this is kind of like, yeah, this makes sense,
3733.52s: but this is also a default assumption in my opinion.
3743.20s: We now have the inclusion of Gary Gensler, SEC Specialized Cryptocurrency Darkpool,
3749.20s: all in the banks. Yeah. What the fuck? I have to be honest, this, this DD was a little confusing to
3758.96s: me just in terms of it's what this is trying to prove or disprove. Because understanding that big,
3770.40s: big entities are incentivized to push their own agendas, of course. Understanding that big entities
3775.44s: are likely colluding with one another to better themselves, of course. So, yeah.
3786.80s: Deswax's are people upset about resource hoarding and stepping on poor people to do so?
3792.96s: I think that's bigger than that. Like that's a really big statement.
3800.72s: Yeah, I think at least as far as I could tell, that seems like a big statement separate from this.
3804.88s: You could always make the argument that big entities are inherently selfish. And I, again,
3812.64s: like I don't necessarily dig the stepping on poor people to do it. That's a little too
3818.32s: specific and conflict driven in my opinion. I think big entities will step on anybody to do it.
3824.16s: I don't think that they're explicitly targeting poor people. I think big entities will target
3829.60s: anybody that they can get money from or take advantage of. But, yeah.
3838.56s: I think, again, we kind of know that. We already know that there's corporate greed to a
3846.72s: obscene level where CEOs are making tens of millions of dollars. I mean, like that is just
3854.16s: obviously massive paid disparity and stuff like that. So, yeah. I, yeah, I guess I'm just,
3867.76s: I want to understand as best as I possibly can. Some of you feel the fact that we have tax havens
3874.16s: in the world aren't a big deal. What's interesting is that all these players are registered
3878.24s: the same place and appears that the government wants to do something about it. This,
3883.84s: it's not that interesting. It's an efficiency thing. So, what this means is somebody in that building
3889.36s: has found a way to set up a business service that allows other people to use that building
3896.48s: for the tax haven because you need a local address. And that's all it is. It's not, it's not like
3902.24s: BlackRock and the other entities are all like, oh, we all have to go to this house together. It's
3906.88s: just an economy of scale efficiency thing. So, another great example of that is here in California,
3912.40s: there's a lot of laws, annoying laws about vehicles. And the vehicles itself here, there's like,
3922.64s: you can't have all different kinds of stuff. It's really, really strict. So, there are places like
3928.80s: Wyoming that people will set up LLCs to register the vehicle too so that it's not,
3935.68s: it doesn't have to go through California registration and smog. So, it's like there are specific
3941.76s: entities that exist online to set people up to do those kinds of things. It's the same thing as
3947.60s: something like this. It's just an efficiency thing. So, yeah. Lauren says, that's why I'll never stop
3956.64s: laughing about left crying on the news because the internet was being mean. Did he actually cry?
3961.04s: I didn't think he actually cried. I thought people were saying that he did, but I thought
3967.44s: people were then saying that it was like an AI-generated image because if he was actually crying,
3972.16s: I'd 100% have to see that. I just saw it and joked about it.
3980.72s: Was that real? Did he actually cry on the news or no?
3984.32s: Because if he did, he must see. That's a must-see event for me. But if he didn't, I still would like to
3994.48s: joke about it. I think the crying thing was more on the verge of tears. I didn't see it. Yeah,
4005.36s: okay. That makes sense. So, I didn't see any of that. It looked like he was just kind of smug.
4011.68s: All right, here we go. Induced to a hype-induced market crash. I think we can generally scroll over
4021.52s: this because from 2021, this didn't happen. We didn't have a market crash. So, remember this thesis
4033.36s: about the overall hype. Yeah, let's see if I can just read the conclusion.
4045.52s: We're going to have to get the apes to follow like standard paper writing format with like an
4050.16s: abstracting conclusions. Now, this is where I connected that's form of theory. The majority of
4063.04s: US markets have switched from mortgage-backed CDOs to CLOs, foundation following the 08.
4070.48s: If GME squeezes again, Reddit research counterfeit US treasure, oh, Jesus Christ.
4075.60s: The second GME squeeze to be so epic that the protective measures in place won't be sufficient.
4081.04s: Okay. So, we can conclude that this did not happen.
4086.16s: I think I figured out what DFV knows. I am now very interested in this one. This one, I'm
4092.56s: absolutely going to read this whole thing because this I'm supremely interested in.
4098.48s: If you look at the options volume out of the money, 16th,
4104.00s: April, you'll notice that it's much higher than any other time throughout the history of stock. Yes.
4110.80s: My belief that DFV knows that shittadella is no long positions in GME and only has calls and puts
4118.00s: GME. When your options expire out of the money and you have no other positions in the stock,
4125.92s: but shorts, you literally have nothing.
4132.24s: Makes sense as to why the shorts have been dragging it out this long. You never give up in an
4136.88s: option until it expires. That's not how that works. If there's a chance, there's a chance, you
4143.92s: still have seen in the game. Institutions don't work like this, man. Just to be clear,
4149.76s: we can say what we want and we can think what we want about entities like Cedadel,
4156.08s: but they are exceedingly proficient at what they do. They're not going to maintain an
4166.08s: options position because of hope. That's just not how they're going to run positions.
4174.24s: If your options expire out of the money and no long positions, you have no leg left to stand on
4179.76s: no more skin in the game, nothing else you can do but cover your short positions.
4186.64s: This will.
4192.32s: I don't understand what this means. They don't have any skin left in the game and any more legs to stand on.
4203.76s: What? Why not? Why not buy your puts then for a year?
4213.20s: The week of 16 April stock was 45 per share and going down.
4218.80s: It's, yeah, this one's the thing tough.
4223.12s: If he knows this information and matched their puts with calls and being on the winning side of
4230.32s: the equation, he exercises options and quadrupled down.
4235.60s: Oh boy. Yeah. I struggle with this one. I think that there's just a lot of random stuff in here
4244.64s: to be honest. We're into the system, that XVI options. Yeah, but the thing is like you can
4254.96s: continue to set up synthetic. That's the thing. It's not like this doesn't make sense to me.
4260.24s: The fact that they're saying they have out of the money options and they're holding on to them
4265.36s: for hope. They literally can just continue the options position. You just roll it.
4270.80s: And they absolutely have the money to maintain the position as long as they legitimately would want
4276.08s: if that's the case. So I just, I don't think that holds any weight. I also don't think this idea
4282.56s: of DFV knowing whatever this actually means. And then matching puts with calls,
4291.04s: like that doesn't really mean anything. And then I also don't think he exercises options.
4298.72s: So like there's a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of
4304.96s: a tricky things in here.
4311.36s: They've been fighting because they had a like to stand on with their put options.
4327.60s: I don't think this is as obvious as they might think to be honest.
4334.96s: I have a million questions here. Why wouldn't they just continue the out? If this is the center
4344.80s: of gravity for their position, the option stray, why would they not just continue the options position?
4349.28s: I don't get that. Yeah, this one a little tricky.
4358.48s: All right. Why trading halted in January? Well, I think we kind of know this. Don't we?
4370.08s: The fucking market was about to explode.
4375.12s: The details plan is to route retail order system as possible.
4379.60s: 70 to 90% of retail traders lose money. I hate statistics like that, but it's not fully inaccurate.
4386.40s: Why are you showing a short share on the trade instead of locating it? Yes. So we know that we're doing
4390.64s: this. This is same. This is why I said to shut down trading and why.
4402.88s: This will never not be funny to me. It will not be funny to me that I'm sitting here on a
4407.92s: fucking YouTube live stream, really like trying to understand the theories and the assumptions about
4414.88s: market, micro structure and stuff like that. And I'm learning from people called robbing your mom.
4423.84s: Only shut down trading out. I love that they call them this.
4429.20s: And that's why we just heard the last congressional hearing directly from TTC.
4439.20s: Lauren says the market almost exploded and they made a video about retail trade. They made a video
4443.92s: about retail investors doing research. What was it? Lauren, what was that?
4454.48s: Do you have the video link to that Lauren? I would love to watch it.
4457.60s: Reece says someone messes up option talk. Eric and I took that personally. That's so funny.
4465.28s: Well, it's because people will say things that are really half baked and it's supremely misleading
4474.16s: for other people that don't know any better. So my preference is if somebody doesn't know something
4480.24s: about something, just don't talk about it, just leave it alone. That's why with a lot of the
4486.88s: game stop stuff, I don't talk about it because I don't know a lot. I'm spending time learning,
4491.28s: but I'm nowhere near it. Lauren says you didn't see it. I don't know.
4504.24s: Citadel's market maker for 50% of retail trade. Oh, no, I didn't say Siri. Chill out.
4512.08s: And every single position went up huge same time. Citadel was caught on the line.
4518.40s: They're providing liquidity retail.
4528.40s: I'm excited before the squeeze runoff. No time to reverse the positions.
4532.80s: And they've been now locked into assuming that every share purchased during the runoff also
4537.44s: wasn't sure shares. Citadel page states our automated equities platform.
4544.24s: Okay.
4560.08s: Okay.
4566.80s: Interesting.
4568.00s: Citadel bill. Melvin. Yep.
4576.88s: So how do I think Citadel and Melvin wound up holding short positions created by Citadel?
4581.12s: There's supposed to be a firewall. Yeah, we know that.
4588.56s: I love the TLDR here though. Big fan. The tricky part that we have to say is that
4596.80s: again, this is one of the problems when people like to promulgate something that they want to be
4605.36s: true or want to believe because when we say something like, Hedges are fucked from 2021,
4612.16s: the reality, like the overwhelming reality is that genuinely, like that as much as I don't like
4618.08s: them, they're still here and they're still making buckets of money. So
4623.76s: I like the message and I like the idea of like trying to call out the errors and stuff,
4632.48s: but I think one of the problems here is that the Hedges unfortunately are not fucked
4640.72s: and they're continuing to make buckets of money as they tend to do because I don't want to go
4647.36s: quite as far as saying something is like too big to fail because they can, something can always
4654.08s: fail, but they have so many disgusting internal efficiencies built that they're not, again,
4665.76s: I wouldn't say that they're too big to fail, but they're not that far off of being too big to fail.
4672.48s: And they have a lot of really, really, really,
4681.28s: like big advantages that other elements don't have, which is one of the reasons why they continue
4688.64s: to persist like they do. Denowing, but it is also one of those, it is what it is kind of things.
4701.84s: I'm thinking Italian for dinner tonight, a Italian sounds perfect.
4716.80s: Cool.
4721.68s: Roin City says in the congressional hearings during the 2008 financial crisis too big to fail,
4726.16s: yeah, exactly. And that's why too big to fail is such a nefarious concept because
4734.48s: something is too big to fail until it fails, but there are massive, massive economies of scale
4740.96s: that bigger entities have like these guys that make it really like again, objectively speaking,
4748.32s: a lot of these hedge funds literally should have gone bankrupt during the squeeze in 21.
4755.68s: The entities that were so short and did not cover, they absolutely should have gone bankrupt,
4765.60s: but because they were in a sense too big to fail because it was going to start jeopardizing
4772.32s: the broad market, they essentially were bailed out. It's complete and utter bullshit,
4778.16s: but it is what it is. So the two big to fail thing unless something is because in that case,
4786.40s: if quote unquote nature was allowed to take and run its normal course, well, that wouldn't have
4793.60s: happened. And they would have been pushed out of business, but that is not the case. I have to call
4800.80s: Mel and make sure she orders her dinner. Normally she doesn't answer this one. She knows what I'm
4805.28s: calling for though. She sends me to voicemail and then she'll take a look. Communication 101.
4816.64s: And there's the text. Okay. What is this?
4825.20s: Do you guys know what this one is?
4836.08s: Reese says I failed to see how collapsed in the financial system would be a result in a win for anyone.
4840.80s: Oh, it absolutely wouldn't, like it would not. Retail traders would lose the money,
4847.28s: but what happens, Reese, is people get so wrapped up in trying to seek like,
4855.28s: vindication that it's like scorched earth policy. I guarantee you that there are swaths of retail
4861.84s: traders who would have been fine, letting their $5,000 position eviscerate as the financial system
4870.48s: collapse just to watch hedge funds and other entities that they don't like fail.
4878.16s: It's very much the case and I also want to be clear. I don't blame them. I don't blame that
4883.84s: perspective because it's very, very frustrating to see. Now, from a practical standpoint,
4890.24s: obviously, that makes no sense because I'm in markets personally to try to make money.
4897.20s: And if there's no, if there's no financial market, then it's real, real tricky to make money
4903.60s: on something that doesn't exist. So from that perspective, it, yeah, it doesn't really help us much.
4917.04s: But from the perspective of people that feel like they've been taking advantage of,
4923.76s: they feel like there's structural and inequity and things like that, folks like that are way
4929.44s: more willing to go scorched earth and just let the cards fall where they weigh. So, yeah, and again,
4937.84s: I can understand the perspective. It's not practical. It's in from a logical perspective. It literally
4942.80s: doesn't make sense. But from like a human perspective, it makes sense. I can see it.
4949.76s: But, yeah, okay. So let's keep going through this. Things capital participation,
4957.36s: lots of empowerment, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if it's, the fuck is this?
4963.52s: We literally need to have
4970.08s: abstracts. It's on the board, Vice Chairman, funds are managed by Blackstone.
4979.28s: Looking to merge with Citadel.
4985.76s: Oh, I like this one. We're all fucked from 23 May. So,
4993.84s: no background. In fact, I'm in healthcare. What I've gathered are three months of investing,
4997.92s: three months. You tell me what you think. The title of my post pretty sums up if I make any
5002.56s: mistakes. Okay. So I'm realizing I'm going to have to go through these a little bit faster. So,
5008.32s: here's one of the problems I'm starting to notice with some of these DDS is that they're
5012.48s: like genuinely exceedingly inexperienced people, which is fine, right? And it's okay to put a
5017.20s: DD out and it's okay to share your information. No problem with any of that. But these kinds of
5023.68s: like really hyperpolic stuff from people that are really inexperienced in my mind, they get very
5030.32s: little credence. I spend very little time on stuff like this. I'll still flip through it out of
5035.52s: sheer curiosity. But it's 2024 now and we're not fucked. Things are still moving along,
5044.64s: chugging along. Okay. So what you'll find is people really like to talk about this kind of stuff.
5058.64s: It's why if you open up news, most people you'll find that like you'll get news fatigued.
5065.52s: The reason why you get news fatigued is when you open up the news, it's always all this horrible
5069.20s: shit that's happening all over the place. And it's because people are drawn to that like moths to
5075.60s: a flame. For whatever reason, people love some bad shit going on. So this kind of stuff almost always
5085.60s: will gain traction and is a very appealing angle for people. It's for that exact reason. It's
5092.08s: because it's engaging. So it's always easy to talk about how things can go wrong, how bad things
5099.36s: are, how the and the reason why I'm talking about this specific thing is because I've seen different
5108.00s: versions of this throughout I've been trading 17 years now. I see this happen all the time,
5116.56s: all the time. Every single fucking year, I see people talking about the end of the world,
5121.84s: how it's here. It's just it's just so common. And there are always things that knock us down.
5133.36s: There are things that slow us down. But I am very bullish on the US, the US economy, the stock market
5140.40s: and companies as whole. There's all these pockets of things that kind of suck, but writ large.
5146.08s: Super bullish. I'm naturally a cautious optimist. And so this kind of stuff, especially with somebody
5153.60s: that has three months of experience, again, it's not I wouldn't I don't fully dismiss it. But it
5158.96s: definitely like the weight in my mind gets nerfed massively. And it's not out of any disrespect
5165.60s: to this person. But three months in markets is it's literally laughable. Nobody's at any point in
5174.16s: three months to talk about shit in the markets. It literally takes probably three to five years
5180.64s: to genuinely get your fucking feet under you. That's not even at the point where I would consider
5185.68s: that person supremely proficient or anything like that. I've come across plenty of traders that have
5191.36s: done super well over three or four year periods. And they are exceedingly confident because they've
5197.36s: crushed it for a specific period of time until they realize that they've only seen one element of
5202.80s: the market. And then the market throws a curve ball. Something new comes out that they haven't seen
5206.72s: yet. They're way too over position because they're way too overconfident because they haven't seen
5210.72s: what they don't know yet. And then they get fucking smashed. So the to me, the main thing that is a
5219.44s: dominant function of market proficiency is consistent return and staying power. So
5228.72s: of Roryntitty says the dude says he is new and explained if he's wrong, he's not stating it is
5232.72s: fact. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I'm not again, I'm not saying anything negative about this person at all
5238.80s: because if you recall what I said in the beginning, it's completely cool for them to write up their
5244.40s: thoughts and what they think. I'm talking about the much larger perspective of these kinds of
5253.36s: angles that people take. I'm not talking about this person's angle. I haven't even read it yet.
5258.48s: It could be fucking genius. I don't know. I'm just talking about this general angle people take
5264.48s: because I've seen it my entire trading career. I will continue to see it my entire trading career.
5269.52s: It's not going anywhere because this shit's in vogue. Okay. So let's see.
5275.52s: SB 500 inflation yield that's now falling below zero, 40 or low. Yep.
5283.92s: Repo market.
5290.64s: Yep.
5294.88s: You're not familiar about repo market. Yeah. Too much cash in the system, not enough collateral.
5301.44s: So one of the issues is in this where we're we're making a mistake in analysis here.
5310.80s: The reason why we're making a mistake in analysis here is because of how impactful a period like
5316.72s: 2020 was and all of the subsequent outputs from COVID and all of the financial and economic functions
5325.12s: that went into place during COVID, you can see we're literally still dealing with it now in 2024.
5332.88s: So comparing this kind of stuff to other reference periods is slightly faulty literally
5340.48s: from a landscape perspective alone. I'm not saying that there's no weight in any of this.
5344.96s: That's not what I'm inferring. I'm just saying we have to take the broader context into
5350.24s: context here. Roy Tady says it was the collective effort for people who were getting run over in
5356.16s: the market because they didn't understand it researching and learning together. Yeah. Yeah.
5359.68s: And again, I agree with that as well. I think that's good. I think the issue I have is the we're all
5366.08s: fucked. That's a definitive statement, right? And again, this is a definitive style statement
5371.92s: that a lot of people will take all the time. Now they go on to say that they're new, which is cool.
5378.24s: But for somebody with very little experience to open with this, again, it's just not a great
5387.84s: attribution for the rest of the research. But again, like I said, I'm always going to read
5396.40s: through stuff because you never know too much cash in the system, not enough collateral, which again,
5402.08s: that's sort of true, but the repo market is a little bit different than that.
5408.16s: Yep. This is good. Yep. This is good.
5413.36s: OK, here I am.
5415.52s: Chamet happen.
5418.48s: Okay.
5425.44s: OK.
5433.92s: I mean, OK.
5443.36s: Rich, divorce, singer, selling stocks.
5451.36s: Okay.
5455.46s: So when I'm reading through this,
5457.46s: there's a very specific theme that I'm picking up.
5460.46s: Do you have any idea what it is?
5461.96s: It is a very normal cognitive bias.
5467.26s: It's super clear.
5469.16s: So when I look through stuff like this,
5476.16s: a big thing that I explicitly want to see
5480.66s: is how things are positioned and what angles are we taking.
5486.66s: So far, as I'm reading through this,
5490.16s: I'm seeing somebody that's seeing what they're looking for.
5494.66s: That's what I'm seeing.
5496.56s: And we also talked about this in the beginning
5498.56s: with some of that other DD that we were talking about.
5502.46s: And this is one of the most common biases
5506.66s: that you're going to see as confirmation bias, anchoring bias.
5510.16s: These are things where we come across artifacts of stuff.
5513.86s: And then all of the subsequent research that we do
5516.86s: goes to the effect of how can I find things
5520.36s: that bolster this point that I have.
5523.56s: So one of the things that I look for in stuff like this
5530.06s: is how well do they steal man their own position?
5535.76s: Because they're looking at a lot of things
5537.56s: that are slightly related,
5539.56s: slightly not related like margin debt, for example.
5542.76s: Margin debt is way, way, way more complex than looking at a
5547.56s: tick up and margin debt from different timeframes
5550.46s: and again through a global pandemic,
5552.26s: what that might mean also what the new financial picture
5555.26s: might look like.
5556.76s: So yeah.
5564.26s: I believe like they're literally talking about
5566.46s: fucking FDIC insurance.
5570.76s: That's like end of world kind of shit.
5573.46s: So to say stuff like my goal is not to insight panic
5578.86s: but then to say for those panicking,
5581.16s: I think you can cash in on your FDIC insurance.
5585.96s: That's inciting panic like that's that's what that is.
5595.16s: Interesting.
5595.96s: I mean, it's an interesting thing.
5597.26s: It's cool to see somebody learning about economic functions.
5602.06s: But it also highlights how complex economic markets
5607.06s: are economics and markets are.
5611.06s: They're massively, massively, massively correlated.
5615.06s: But there's so specific to individual circumstances,
5619.26s: context around what's going on in the world today.
5621.86s: That it's very difficult to run through this kind of analysis
5624.86s: and to come up with a make sure you're in an FDIC insured bank.
5628.86s: There's yeah.
5631.66s: Roryntady says don't forget last year that FDIC had a bailout
5634.66s: bank service at 22 you mean with Silicon Valley bank SBB?
5641.16s: Is that what you're referring to?
5648.46s: Reverse repost showing possible evidence of forced liquid
5651.06s: dations.
5654.06s: Okay.
5656.86s: I think we can.
5659.46s: Freeze through this.
5660.86s: I think we might be seeing forced liquidations given
5665.66s: that the connection between counter parties price surges.
5668.56s: GMIs correct.
5670.36s: When was this?
5672.16s: 27 May 21.
5675.76s: Okay.
5681.96s: DTCC Wall Street want key things in place before GM and
5685.66s: wines.
5686.16s: Now we're looking at a list that is most likely checked off
5688.46s: rocket about cleared for launch.
5691.26s: So this.
5698.86s: I want to find it 28.
5717.26s: May 28.
5721.66s: So they didn't quite top ticket but we're close.
5726.66s: And this is top taking it from.
5729.46s: The.
5732.46s: Wrong sense because I think this is the highest game stop hit
5737.26s: before it started contracting down if I'm not mistaken.
5743.56s: I'm going to grab another mango orange over your back.
5750.66s: You
5781.66s: All right.
5783.66s: We are ready to roll.
5788.66s: Okay.
5791.66s: Let's see what we got here.
5811.66s: Yeah.
5816.66s: Yeah.
5817.66s: So this.
5819.66s: I mean.
5821.66s: This is about.
5825.66s: Is closest they're going to get.
5833.66s: Yeah. This is about as close as you're going to get to like top
5835.66s: point before we we had the rest of the rotation down.
5842.26s: So I don't know you can kind of.
5845.66s: It's this is one of the things when you're reading through a lot of the
5849.66s: due diligence and what people think are going to happen.
5853.06s: Is you have to pay pretty close attention to the timing and the fact that
5861.66s: most people are just guessing right.
5864.66s: And they're most people that I read here are actually very, very cool
5870.16s: because they identify that nobody really knows what's going on and we're trying to figure it out.
5876.16s: The problem is is that if you continue if you read through a lot of this and you
5882.16s: don't continually remind yourself of that broader message, you become desensitized to the people saying
5889.16s: I don't know what I'm talking about.
5891.16s: And you start onboarding the broad messages that are there subconsciously.
5898.66s: So and I'm not saying good, bad and different.
5901.16s: It's just that you have to be really thoughtful when you're receiving and perceiving the information from stuff like this.
5908.16s: Because I mean this objectively did not happen right.
5911.66s: The game stop did absolutely rally.
5914.16s: But my guess is that it's not to what they thought was going on.
5918.16s: And you can see what a lot of people will tie things to to try to further elucidate their point or validate their point.
5925.16s: One of the things I would love to see in the DDS here and it's the same thing that I do in all of my strategy outlines is I have a section
5935.16s: that literally talks about when does this not work?
5939.16s: When does this strategy fail? Right.
5942.16s: It's specifically reminding myself to look at the flaws into a steel man to look at the other side.
5953.16s: A lot of what I see here are people seeing what they want to see.
5961.16s: The guaranteed short squeeze trigger the NFT cripple crypto digital dividend.
5968.16s: Okay.
5971.16s: One proof of a way to trigger the short squeeze done by over stock.
5979.16s: When a head you shorts a stock they borrow from a broker real owner sells it.
5984.16s: Because the one who purchases it believes he's also an owner single shares two owners when the comp well sort of this is just to be clear when.
5995.16s: When things are working as they should you have to elect to allow your shares to be loaned out so.
6004.16s: Yeah when they're working as they should.
6008.16s: When a company then pays a dividend both owners expected dividend yet the company only pays dividend owner because the broker only holds this is also not fully accurate.
6018.16s: So when your short shares you pay the dividend.
6023.16s: So.
6026.16s: Yeah I'm confused on that the dividend for the fake share is paid out of the shorts pockets to make the whole system.
6033.16s: Yeah okay so this is correct.
6036.16s: This. Yeah so this one.
6040.16s: This one confuses me.
6042.16s: The right to the says if you use margin you're opting into share lending potentially you can still elect more discreetly than that with some brokers it's not just margin if so facto I am now agreeing to lend my shares out you can.
6055.16s: I don't know it depends on your broker but a lot of brokers will still permit you to say don't loan my shares out.
6064.16s: Let me see because the one who purchases it believes he also is an owner.
6070.16s: But this doesn't make sense when a when a hedge fund shorts a stock they don't think they own it they're shorting it.
6079.16s: So I don't understand this idea of two owners there's not two owners.
6086.16s: The company pays a dividend both owners expected dividend which is this is also not.
6091.16s: Racked the person who shorts does not expect the dividends it's structurally not there.
6099.16s: If games stop pays a crypto digital dividend then in order for the system to continue the shorter we'll have to find and acquire this NFT dividend to give it.
6107.16s: The guy he all I see with this is okay got it.
6114.16s: I see.
6119.16s: Okay.
6120.16s: Follow up to the house of cards.
6128.16s: Let me.
6138.16s: I'm going to try to scroll through these a little bit quicker and I'm going to flag the ones that I want to go back to is just because we're only at page three hundred of eight forty two.
6146.16s: This is going to take forever for us to like meaningfully get through these.
6150.16s: And some of them.
6153.16s: I don't want to say that they're not good like they're fine for what they are but I think some of them are less informative than than others.
6160.16s: Let me see I want to see if I can scroll through this faster why does this girl so slow.
6165.16s: How does this make any sense.
6173.16s: Because I also can't trust chat GPT to summarize it.
6177.16s: It did not do a good job summarizing.
6181.16s: What if I zoom out like this.
6188.16s: No.
6194.16s: There we go.
6197.16s: It goes pretty quick.
6200.16s: Perfect.
6201.16s: We found a way to cheat the system.
6206.16s: I can't read anything that's there.
6209.16s: But let's grab this.
6214.16s: And then summarize this article.
6222.16s: Perfect.
6225.16s: This is fantastic news for us.
6229.16s: We're on to the says shit.
6232.16s: It's controlling the scroll.
6234.16s: They're in the computer.
6236.16s: The files are in the computer.
6239.16s: I got to move this over here because now I'm using other windows and shit.
6243.16s: Also shout out to you guys.
6245.16s: There's 80 people hanging out right now.
6248.16s: And bigger thing hopefully is I genuinely and hopeful some of you are learning some of the stuff that I am as I'm going through this.
6256.16s: I know a lot of you will know way more about this than I do right.
6259.16s: I like I continue to reiterate the point that I am a guest in the game stop house.
6264.16s: But even though that's the case, I'm hopeful that as I go through individual things like this, people might be picking up elements that they might not have seen before.
6275.16s: And I think that that's really, really useful information to build over time.
6283.16s: So that's at least my hope.
6294.16s: All right.
6296.16s: So let's see what GPT says.
6299.16s: Article attached discusses the concept of everything short series suggests that several hedge funds have been strategically shorting a wide range of stocks to manipulate market dynamics.
6309.16s: Okay.
6312.16s: hedge funds like citadel melvin capital and others develop develop significant positions in various companies funds are accused of systematically shorting stocks of companies that compete with their favorite investments.
6323.16s: Sure, I could see that.
6325.16s: Author implies that these hedge funds engage in practices that resemble market manipulation.
6329.16s: They might short stocks of companies like game stop or AMC to suppress their price while supporting competitors like Amazon or Netflix.
6336.16s: So here's the problem that we start running into here is when we're talking about systemic shorting like that to that scale.
6344.16s: I'm not saying it can happen. It can.
6346.16s: But it becomes really, really difficult to do so.
6350.16s: And the reason why it's difficult to do so is because markets are consensus-driven pricing mechanisms.
6357.16s: So unless that there's other entities that are also in collusion that are like, yeah, okay, we'll just let this thing get crushed.
6364.16s: Sooner or later, there will be entities even like Ryan Cohen. He does it not in an investing standpoint, but in terms of scooping in on businesses and turning them around investors will do that traders will do that because it's if we see something that gets pushed down to a level that doesn't make sense based on the valuation.
6384.16s: So a lot of people will enter into that market and buy it because it makes sense.
6390.16s: It's such a value and this straight up has been the case. You can literally see it happening in game stop.
6399.16s: If we zoom this in, you can see game stop got absolutely punished. And it's because objectively speaking, the business of game stop during this period did not look great.
6411.16s: I'm not trying to talk shit. I know that people get sensitive about that. But it's completely true from an objective standpoint.
6418.16s: It's a it was a brick and mortar based business that that's a tough way to succeed in an exceedingly digital market in a place where people aren't buying consoles and games physically in store in mass anymore.
6434.16s: Most of it's done at home via Amazon and then you buy the games on the console. So I've been playing a game called starfield, which is actually super cool. You get to cruise around space.
6444.16s: But then game stop starts to turn things around pretty massively. And that's why I'm so excited about the move from here because the move from here is market internal driven.
6462.16s: This move happens because people are starting to see options activity. I saw the options activity. I start to get in because there's activity other people are in and it incentivizes participation in that way.
6477.16s: That's great. Then what starts to happen here is different. This isn't being kicked off because of a lot of transactions in options markets.
6491.16s: The options markets are busy, but they're not crazy. It's nothing like we saw in the beginning of the well, I guess in the middle of the year in the summer.
6498.16s: So the movement that you're starting to see now is an artifact of people.
6503.16s: Fundamentally valuing the company differently. That's important. So taking that all the way back to what I'm reading here saying that, you know, hedge funds are essentially manipulating the market to drive price down.
6518.16s: It can happen. I'm not saying it doesn't. It does happen. But if there's underlying value in the company that's seen accepted and understood.
6527.16s: There will be people that are going to buy it because of the fundamental components of the company longer term. And that will in turn put the shorts in a really tough position.
6539.16s: So it's just not as simple as saying hedge funds are doing blank because hedge funds have a lot of resources and power. There's a lot of different hedge funds.
6550.16s: We can't bucket them all the same. They do different things. They have different imperatives. But there's also a lot of market participants with different ideas and approaches. That's important to identify.
6561.16s: Okay. The next thing this article talks about is connections between various companies and hedge funds points out how hedge funds have stakes and companies like zeo group the IC properties indicating a network of investments that influence market behavior completely agree.
6574.16s: The author notes that stock charts for companies like five below Amazon, Walmart and other show patterns inversely related to GMIs performance. We've looked at this a million times.
6584.16s: And I think that the correlations are that's you can't like that statement doesn't mean anything stock charts for companies like five below Amazon and Walmart inversely related to GMIs performance.
6598.16s: Those are people that are just typically eyeballing a chart. We've done this a bunch of times on the live stream that are again seeing what they want to see and not actually doing like a correlation analysis or aggression.
6610.16s: So I'm not saying that they're not inverted. I don't know in this instance, but I would guess that that's the case because companies like Amazon, what did it, what did it site companies like Amazon and Walmart. They're fucking huge.
6628.16s: So the idea that one of them is being suppressed to prop the other one up would be dubious. I don't think that's a fair assertion to make.
6638.16s: And then the article warns if GME experiences a significant short squeeze it could trigger similar events across other heavily shorted stocks is could lead to widespread financial repercussions for involved hedge funds.
6649.16s: Yep, I think we know that. Okay, cool. So now let's zoom in on this one.
6656.16s: Reverse merger naked shorts in covering the golden bullet.
6663.16s: Interesting. Well, they didn't. I don't think they did this.
6671.16s: So.
6678.16s: Interesting.
6688.16s: RC Ventures games stop agreement reserve the right to acquire 19.9 taking full control bigger stake. Okay, so yeah, I think we can skip through this one.
6702.16s: This just didn't happen. Oh, here we go.
6709.16s: Oh, big daddy. Let's see. Oh shit. He just called social media unverified information from unqualified social media. He obviously hasn't seen the details. Superstank. That's awesome.
6723.16s: Volume catalyst. We already talked about that a million times. So I agree with the volume component wholeheartedly.
6732.16s: The only thing that's happening in volume is the defining feature of detecting price movement in most things.
6742.16s: Specifically, game stop. It is the only thing I can point out.
6747.16s: That every time there's a big run, it's preceded by volume.
6752.16s: Anything else. We've had every kind of interesting idea about what's driving price movement and stuff like that. But regardless of all of that, none of them have moved things quite like volume.
6768.16s: So volume has to be there. I agree with this.
6773.16s: Here you go. What can you tell us about volume when there hasn't been volume.
6781.16s: On balance volume. Okay.
6787.16s: I'm going to take this from other posts. The commonality between all these graphs is unbalanced volume continues to increase. Okay.
6801.16s: Okay.
6806.16s: So one of the issues with this is like drawing any sort of standard technical analysis lines. I think these are each of Moku clouds, by the way, here if I'm not mistaken, is this right.
6820.16s: But drawing technical analysis like this off of a squeeze doesn't really make sense in my opinion. And the reason why it doesn't make sense is because you have to apply a completely different style of technical analysis around squeezes.
6833.16s: You can apply standard support. Like think about what technical analysis represents. It represents analyzing the relationship between buyers and sellers in an open marketplace.
6844.16s: So it's looking at price and volume. Well, price and volume as represented through supply and demand. Those functions have certain inferences we can make from them that completely break down during a short squeeze.
6859.16s: People that were buying GameStop at $500 were partially psychotic retail traders that are trying to see how much money they can make hoping it goes higher.
6869.16s: And I say psychotic just because that's a massive amount of money to pay for a stock that just before was down at whatever. So it would have worked if necessarily they weren't stock when they turned the buy button off and price was a lot to continue to move.
6887.16s: But that's before financial ruin of the markets in which case nobody gets anything. So that part aside, the entities that are buying shares there, they're not buying it because they actually
6898.16s: think it's valued at 513. They don't think that the company's fundamentally valued there. They're buying it because they quite literally are forced to cover short positions, which is great.
6908.16s: Fuck them. But that's not standard supply and demand functions. It's very, very unique. So you have to apply a completely different methodology.
6919.16s: So I actually think drawing lines like basing things off of this is a broken methodology, but just because I think it's a broken methodology doesn't mean it doesn't work doesn't mean it's not efficacious.
6931.16s: It literally doesn't mean anything like that because technical analysis is very much part art part science. So they're fully entitled to do that. That's just my personal opinion on it.
6943.16s: Yep. So I saw it each of you. I don't see the Mac the oscillators and then they've TTM squeeze. Yeah.
6953.16s: So TTM squeeze just like a volatility metric essentially it uses two different volatility tools to measure ball. Yeah.
6963.16s: Okay. So here's all the TA. What's the.
6968.16s: I'm not going to waste a bunch of time. I just want to see what they're.
6972.16s: I like to stock anything you take away from this remember volume is king short squeeze is not happening yet. This is great volume is king. The short squeeze has not happened yet.
6980.16s: I understand what they're inferring here, but again, just for clarity sake of short squeeze absolutely is fucking happened. Probably the biggest one that the company will see.
6988.16s: At least uninterrupted and I emphasize that point because the uninterrupted component is huge.
6998.16s: Does this mean that there couldn't be a bigger short squeeze in the future. There always could be right the worst days depending on what's out of the trade around or always ahead.
7006.16s: So that I think is completely fair and to think that there could be a bigger squeeze in the future. I think that's completely fair.
7014.16s: The problem is at what point does it get stopped.
7019.16s: That's the problem and we already know that they stopped the first one. They cut the first one short and the first one was overall lower magnitude.
7028.16s: So the the probability of there being another short squeeze that's equivalent or bigger. I think would be difficult to justify again from a practical standpoint not from a structural standpoint not saying that there aren't the conditions for it to occur.
7045.16s: But at what and this is one of the things that I notice is missing from a lot of the diligence and positions people will pose is that we don't apply a practical methodology of the fact that it's going to be interrupted market forces external will interrupt it just like they already did.
7067.16s: So they've already showed that they're not willing to allow the financial system to collapse because of this.
7073.16s: And again, from that perspective, I don't blame them. I don't want the financial system to collapse either because of this.
7080.16s: But it would be really cool to see if there's a bit of a line that's balanced where we actually allow some of the hedge funds and stuff to go out of business as they should.
7092.16s: And they should be forced to buy it at $500 price. Fuck them.
7096.16s: But we should essentially allow those hedge funds to run until they are fucked and completely liquid.
7103.16s: And then it should be I think sequestered so that it doesn't destroy an entire financial system.
7108.16s: But yeah, this I understand the sentiment here, but I make that point for everybody because I know everybody's really, really interested and hopeful for furmo as.
7119.16s: But one of the things that I haven't heard an explanation for which I genuinely am interested.
7126.16s: I genuinely genuinely am interested in hearing is how does the theory of Moas apply if this if the squeeze that's coming is supposedly bigger than the squeeze that already happened if the first squeeze was already interrupted.
7140.16s: I don't understand that logic.
7143.16s: Rorynclyde says the thing is if you apply that practicality to a DD and post on Reddit, then you're done.
7148.16s: What did the hell and call the show understandably because it's a community and group of people that have been manipulated for as long as they've been around.
7157.16s: And I think that there is an element of an echo chamber where people don't want to necessarily hear too many things that are far too different.
7166.16s: But from what I can understand and see from a lot of the ape community, it does seem like there's a growing appetite for healthy discourse and exchange of ideas.
7177.16s: So I think that it's not necessarily that far out in the future where you can have a legitimate conversation about these kind of things.
7187.16s: I think a lot of the people that get called a shill rightfully so are people that are just bad mouthing things with uninformed opinions and not something that's well researched.
7198.16s: But for example, the comment I make that a lot of people would call me a show for on there is saying the statement that I don't see a larger squeeze happening if the first squeeze was stopped.
7215.16s: So, but the way that I phrase it is as a question because it's a genuine question.
7220.16s: The genuine question I have is how do we rationalize that there would be a bigger squeeze in the future if the smaller squeeze was manually interrupted by market forces.
7236.16s: And not saying that there's not an answer to it there I hope there is I just don't know what it is I haven't heard it yet that's something that I've talked to Newton about and that's something that can I have talked about on the livestream before because there isn't again like I just haven't heard a solution to that problem set yet.
7258.16s: The mystery of negative beta.
7261.16s: Okay.
7265.16s: Let's zoom this one out and see if we can.
7271.16s: This is a cheat code.
7273.16s: It still scrolls really slow but when it scrolls slow it's doing like half a page at a time.
7279.16s: So we can get the deets.
7283.16s: And then I think we'll probably pause after this one.
7289.16s: Lauren says retail traders are learning got to give people room to grow absolutely.
7292.16s: I still think GME will pop a little.
7294.16s: Oh, absolutely.
7295.16s: And again, I want to be super clear.
7297.16s: That doesn't mean that it can't squeeze.
7299.16s: I think GME is one of those companies that's literally primed to squeeze.
7303.16s: I'm just clarifying the idea of I think we need to be.
7313.16s: I think we need to be able to answer the question of how does Moas happen if the first squeeze was cut.
7321.16s: And if there's a really good answer to that which I would I genuinely would love to hear.
7325.16s: Then I think that's what I'm interested in because just because I don't know the answer how it might work doesn't mean that there's not something there.
7335.16s: I just don't know it.
7337.16s: And it's an example of why I would never make a post of something like you know there's no short squeeze right like a lot of the people will say were fucked.
7347.16s: But they'll share an opinion that's again is informed as it can be for them.
7353.16s: But I don't feel comfortable saying something like even that there's not going to be a bigger short squeeze like I won't say that because I don't know.
7362.16s: But what I do know is that there's definitely a logical gap that we have to work through and I don't know the answer to yet.
7371.16s: Summarize this article.
7376.16s: Let's see what this says.
7378.16s: Ron cliti says would change in ways for it.
7380.16s: Allow it to continue hold on.
7382.16s: Ron cliti says so let me preface by saying I don't personally believe this but the answer to how could there be a bigger squeeze that regulation both internal and external to the financial system would change in ways for allow it to continue without interference.
7393.16s: Right.
7394.16s: Right. But that argument doesn't make sense because the reason for interference previously was literally to prevent the meltdown of the financial system.
7409.16s: So there isn't a scenario where there's enough regulation that would allow more risk assumption.
7423.16s: Now, I do think that there's a world where the squeeze could be permitted to the point where individual hedge funds might literally go bankrupt.
7441.16s: But I don't think even in a malgommation of a lot of those hedge funds would be enough money to yield like this massive massive squeeze.
7453.16s: DCM says bigger squeeze because the first time there were several stocks squeezing all at once.
7458.16s: Two of those companies already went bankrupt so pressure is already less.
7467.16s: I don't think that explains it either in my opinion.
7472.16s: So to clarify the position I'm offering is the last squeeze was interrupted because there was a potential for literally the financial system to collapse.
7488.16s: Happens when there's a certain amount of risk out that's uncovered for whatever reason and that there's enough variance and liquidity that can yield that kind of collapse.
7503.16s: So if external entity stepped in to stop that from happening previously. I don't see how there would be a world where we would permit more risk if the last round of risk was already kept lower.
7523.16s: Roryn clitty says the way you're talking makes it sound as though you think some sort of pre existing safety triggers were tripped. No, I don't think that I don't even know if those exist.
7532.16s: I don't think that at all the pre existing safety triggers and stuff like that would be things like you know circuit breakers.
7542.16s: But yeah, I think circuit breakers are completely different than that.
7551.16s: Roryn clitty says what external entity stepped in to stop the last one the brokers.
7556.16s: So the brokers across the board turned off the ability to buy shares.
7567.16s: Lizzie says do you think there will ever be any type of accountability for allowing it to get this bad.
7572.16s: Look, I hope I think that there's a potential, but the problem is is that in general the accountability component there is directly disincentivized from the largest constituents of the system.
7589.16s: So I think that there's a conflict of interest from their perspective to actually gain accountability.
7595.16s: So I think that you would need to have some sort of very aggressive entity that enters SEC, Fenra, like these different oversight commissions and organizations that actually doesn't care about the conflict of interest and the potential harm that comes from moving through it and pursuing it that way.
7616.16s: But there's so much conflict of interest in lobbying that I think would be really difficult.
7625.16s: Yeah.
7629.16s: Lauren says they weren't expecting GME to do what it did and they took care and who they took care of is very telling I agree with you fully agree with you.
7637.16s: DCM says the buy button was turned off because of a massive fake trade that was immediately reversed and that's why the buy button was turned off the financial system wasn't going to collapse only some larger.
7647.16s: I actually don't agree with that and I think that the reason why I don't agree with that is because there's there's entities way smarter than I am petrified one of them that was talking about like where that could potentially go because of how pervasive it was.
7666.16s: So I think that I do think that the entire financial system genuinely was at risk and I think that that's also why there was again a pretty unanimous effort across the board to disallow continued investment and at least to the long side.
7688.16s: Matthew says got a bounce good livestream thanks there OK you got it yeah if it's already been two hours I got a wrap up soon but let's see what this one says.
7697.16s: So this says game stops negative beta discusses the the unusually negative beta of game stop.
7706.16s: I have to look into that more impact of short selling market manipulation and short squeeze.
7715.16s: I don't know how they're arriving at negative beta here.
7723.16s: Carlos says there will be no GME squeeze get it through thick head and I actually don't agree with that either I absolutely think there can be a squeeze.
7733.16s: I think the nature and level of the squeeze can be different.
7741.16s: But yeah.
7751.16s: All right.
7755.16s: Let's add a comment here.
7760.16s: This will be 30 no.
7764.16s: Be off.
7767.16s: This way we can find that again very interesting.
7771.16s: So to summarize the multiple dds we went through and just kind of at a high level what I'm seeing.
7779.16s: I'm seeing a lot of really pervasive focus on manipulation which is fair.
7786.16s: The various entities and the relationship between entities which I think is good.
7793.16s: I see a lot of confirmation bias in trying to paint a specific picture that people want to see which is very normal.
7808.16s: I see a lot of loosely formed opinions with respect to future price direction.
7819.16s: Example being the the one that's talked about we are fucked and then the other one that talked about the TA on GameStop.
7829.16s: Which is again that's not a dig at any of them.
7834.16s: It's just people taking guesses and trying to piece together what they think is going to happen.
7839.16s: I also see the overwhelming majority of what we've read did not happen at least in terms of price performance so far of GameStop.
7851.16s: So the one entity that said we are fucked that obviously hadn't happened.
7856.16s: The other entity that was talking about the reverse merger that didn't happen.
7862.16s: The one that was talking about the technical analysis of GameStop and their price projections that when didn't happen.
7868.16s: And again, I'm not saying this in a judgmental way as if I know what's going to happen.
7872.16s: I'm no fucking idea.
7873.16s: I'm just trying to recount what we went through and what the trends are that I can piece together from a high perspective.
7883.16s: So a lot of work a lot of work goes into these.
7887.16s: The other thing that I definitely can pick up on is the level of interest in GameStop is insane in that people are clearly willing like that one that was going through the tax shelters and stuff.
7902.16s: That's a very edge case peripheral topic that somebody spent a lot of time digging into the very specific details that they were able to piece together.
7912.16s: Which is really impressive to me the fact that people do that.
7915.16s: It's very cool. It's one of the reasons why I'm so stoked and eager to continue learning about GameStop and you know what we can pick up.
7923.16s: So I'm excited to keep working through these the DDs that we have.
7928.16s: I actually think what I'm going to do is split this though because we're actually making pretty good progress at this point.
7936.16s: And if I split the document, I should be able to move through it through the AI thing and hear a little more efficiently, which would be cool.
7948.16s: So before we wrap though, is there anything else you guys want to take a look at.
7952.16s: Obviously we'll continue the DD.
7954.16s: I think next Saturday.
7956.16s: Yeah, next Saturday is good.
7958.16s: We'll we have a bunch of travel next month. So you'll see me on the mobile setup again.
7963.16s: But yeah, let me know if there's anything that we want to hit real quick before we bounce.
7967.16s: As always, thank you guys for hanging out.
7969.16s: I think I've been seeing people sharing the live stream around, which is awesome.
7973.16s: I'm really appreciative of that.
7975.16s: That really helps me because it helps grow our audience, which then helps inform where I get information from.
7983.16s: And I essentially continue to cast a wider net because you guys are helping me and teaching me.
7990.16s: So thank you all for for that.
7994.16s: Anti-governments, this thoughts on archer aviation.
7997.16s: I'm these streams are really specific to GameStop.
8000.16s: So I'm happy to talk about that.
8002.16s: If you want, unless you think it's related to GameStop somehow, then I'm happy to look at it.
8006.16s: But otherwise you can always bring that up on like the Monday live stream or the Friday live stream something like that.
8013.16s: But yeah.
8016.16s: All right, guys.
8018.16s: Hold on.
8019.16s: Runkley says, do we ever put together a full-fledged meme stock portfolio that would be cool to take a look at it if we already have it.
8025.16s: Yeah, so I think we built that a little while ago and I was running it for a little bit.
8030.16s: And then I reconfigured the I reconfigured the live schedule.
8036.16s: So right now we can probably talk about it on Monday during the Monday live stream at some point.
8044.16s: That would be okay.
8045.16s: But yeah, right now the live streams are Monday is YouTube Wednesday is outlier pro Friday is options trading basics Saturday GameStop Sunday.
8059.16s: Allier pro and then Tuesday Thursday is kind of just trader hangout as it's going now.
8065.16s: It's just a chance to bullshit for a little bit in talk markets.
8068.16s: So he's saying King says GME isn't a meme stock in my opinion.
8073.16s: That's a completely fair opinion to have.
8075.16s: I think it objectively is.
8078.16s: But I think it's because people have a really negative connotation of meme stock and I don't think it's a negative connotation.
8085.16s: I literally think based on the original definition when we started that series about meme stocks.
8090.16s: It's literally stocks that are popularly talked about.
8094.16s: And I don't think that that's a negative connotation at all.
8097.16s: I think a lot of people apply a negative connotation that it's like some sort of like uninformed position or stuff like that, which I I would agree.
8105.16s: Like I don't think that's at all.
8106.16s: And I also don't think GameStop's price mover right now is just hype at all.
8113.16s: I think GameStop has a completely viable underlying business and they're starting to pivot.
8121.16s: So that's what I think.
8125.16s: All right, y'all. Enjoy the rest of your weekend for the outlier pro members.
8128.16s: Don't forget to do your performance AAR for the month so that we can review them tomorrow.
8134.16s: Be an outlier. I will see you all later.
