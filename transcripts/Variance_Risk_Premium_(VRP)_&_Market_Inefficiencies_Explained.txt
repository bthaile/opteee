0.66s: if you trade any option credit style
4.38s: strategy you need to know the difference
6.60s: between a variance risk premium and a
8.94s: market inefficiency what's up everybody
10.92s: Eric here welcome back to all the
12.54s: outliers we're gonna get right to it I
14.64s: recently put a video out highlighting a
16.50s: few common problems I see with people
18.12s: who trade zero DTE SPX spreads not my
20.82s: preferred strategy although I do trade
22.56s: zero DTE SPX options it's not via credit
25.98s: spreads which I'll explain a little bit
27.48s: later however if you want to watch that
29.46s: video for a quick recap on where all
31.62s: this is coming from I'll throw a link to
33.72s: that in the video description below now
36.06s: one of my community members totally free
38.34s: Discord come hang out with us the links
40.86s: to those also in the description
43.20s: um he brought up how he was trading the
45.24s: zero DTE SPX strategies and didn't even
47.46s: really understand why it was working or
49.56s: what he was attempting to take advantage
51.00s: of and this is super common a lot of
52.80s: people do that because a lot of these
55.74s: style trades are high probability even
58.50s: though they are long-term negatively
61.38s: expectant they just don't know it yet
63.00s: because hasn't been realized now let's
65.76s: talk about this concept between variance
68.04s: risk premiums and inefficiencies the
70.80s: variance risk premium is essentially
73.44s: this known function where people are
77.64s: willing to pay more for protection on
80.10s: their portfolio via puts then they're
83.46s: technically worth so a lot of times we
86.52s: see puts are overpriced and you can also
89.82s: easily find this with put skew if you
92.82s: look at the same Delta option in most
96.06s: tickers if you have a 30 Delta put
98.40s: versus a 30 Delta call A lot of times
100.68s: they will be priced differently
104.40s: let's take a look at Apple here so if I
108.72s: zoom in I'm looking at the 18 notes so
111.24s: 20 days out and I look at the 30 Delta
114.24s: put it's trading for let's just call it
116.66s: 266 something like that
119.22s: then if I go to a 30 Delta call and I
122.40s: look at the option it's trading for like
124.14s: two dollars maybe two dollars in a penny
126.78s: there's an additional 60 cents of
129.78s: premium for the same exact Delta on the
132.24s: put side this is exactly what put SKU is
136.32s: and again this is a function that most
138.48s: people are willing to pay for protection
140.28s: they're willing to pay a little bit more
142.08s: because the fact of the matter is if
143.82s: they were priced perfectly people like
146.34s: me wouldn't be willing to take the other
148.26s: side of the trade because why would I so
151.50s: the variance risk premium regularly
154.92s: exists in indices and other products
157.92s: like that it's super important to track
160.44s: it carefully because it's not always
162.72s: there so the strategies that we're
165.18s: looking to deploy may not work as well
167.52s: when that variance risk premium isn't
169.74s: present or at least large enough for the
172.32s: risk to make sense now when we think
174.78s: about in inefficiency slightly different
176.94s: scenario this is where we have the
178.56s: opportunity to find maybe an option or
180.66s: something that's mispriced now the thing
184.74s: about inefficiencies is they tend not to
187.86s: be Perpetual they can last a long time
190.26s: but tend not to be Perpetual so what
192.78s: that means is if you find an opportunity
194.82s: we trade those very differently because
197.10s: we understand that we found an
198.60s: opportunity and it can be there for a
201.36s: day a week a couple months until it is
204.36s: eventually priced out and no longer
205.98s: there so we want to trade them very
207.18s: aggressively now Ewan Sinclair has a
209.76s: fantastic analog LG for this concept of
212.82s: variance risk premium versus
214.58s: inefficiencies so I'm going to borrow it
216.84s: from him because I think it's well
218.82s: stated he uses a dude walking down the
221.82s: road he's on the sidewalk and he finds a
224.28s: 20 Bill outside of a bar
226.68s: and you pick up the 20 Bill and you move
229.56s: on with your day great you just made 20
231.18s: bucks essentially risk-free cool
233.34s: that is the idea of an inefficiency that
236.22s: inefficiency is some drunk person that's
238.62s: walking out of the bar fumbles for their
240.90s: keys or whatever hopefully not drunk
242.40s: driving but maybe they're grabbing
243.84s: something else out of their wallet and a
246.30s: 20 Bill falls out and you just happen to
248.94s: be the first person that's walking by to
251.22s: scoop up that 20. now maybe you check it
253.92s: out next Saturday morning because you're
255.78s: like ah maybe this dude's really dumb
257.46s: and maybe it's there again maybe it's
259.26s: not but sooner or later that dude that's
261.96s: dropping the 20s out is either going to
263.76s: figure it out somebody else will find it
265.38s: as well and it'll be more scarce for you
267.36s: to grab it or it's just going to run out
269.28s: of 20 bills and it's not going to be
270.72s: there so the point being inefficiencies
273.36s: have a finite lifespan it just depends
276.18s: on when they're going to end now the
277.98s: variance risk premium is different and
279.78s: again based on the put SKU I just shared
281.94s: with you why that exists it's
284.04s: essentially a function that exists and
286.56s: has existed in these style markets since
289.32s: their origin and it's because people are
292.14s: willing to pay a premium for disaster
294.18s: Insurance that's really where it comes
296.28s: from so take that same 20 Bill and
299.04s: instead of it being on the safe sidewalk
300.60s: now it's in the middle of a five Lane
302.40s: Highway in New Jersey and for any of my
304.98s: Northeastern people that have driven
306.54s: through New Jersey you know what I'm
308.04s: talking about because it's a gauntlet
310.32s: out there so instead of the scenario
313.68s: where we just happen to be the first one
315.12s: to see that 20 on the highway probably
317.52s: thousands of people have seen that
318.90s: twenty dollar bill but most of them are
320.94s: like I don't want to get mowed down by a
323.40s: Karen driving a minivan on her cell
325.08s: phone to grab twenty dollars
327.36s: so it's a unique person that says nobody
331.86s: else is going for it risk is worth it to
333.36s: me let me play some Frogger grab that 20
334.98s: and move on with my day that is the
337.50s: nature of a variance risk premium other
339.12s: people have seen it they've identified
340.62s: it they know it's there they choose to
343.32s: not attempt to exploit it because it's
345.66s: not worth it to them for one reason or
347.28s: another when we're selling premiums
349.86s: specifically on zero DTE SPX credit
353.64s: spread strategies or stuff like that you
356.16s: are attempting to take advantage of this
359.22s: variance risk premium that is usually
361.50s: there but not always there so it is so
365.16s: important for us to be able to track the
367.98s: variance risk premium and whether it
369.90s: exists or not how do we do that now you
372.66s: can create your own pricing models I
375.48s: have my own it requires a volatility
378.00s: calculation which is honestly a giant
380.46s: pain in the ass to do and maintain so I
383.28s: actually am lazy myself and I use an
385.98s: easier Method All I like to do
388.86s: is take something like a index and if
394.14s: you look at these lines down here that's
396.00s: exactly what I'm doing I am simply
397.86s: looking at the variance risk premium
399.60s: using implied volatility comparing it to
401.82s: Historic volatility for different
403.14s: periods and seeing how big of a gap I
406.50s: can find so for example on this day 11
409.50s: October implied volatility came in at
412.82s: 0.3325 and the 20-day historic
415.08s: volatility of 0.24 that's almost a 10
417.60s: point risk premium variance in this
420.24s: meaning that the expected move was
423.48s: significantly higher than the actual
425.22s: move that's where we have the chance to
426.96s: make some good money now to No Surprise
429.60s: towards the end of last week I actually
432.06s: had a very profitable was my most
433.68s: profitable week year to date but I was
436.98s: trading a lot of shorter term SPX credit
440.70s: strategies and shocker I had to fight
444.84s: the living hell out of a trade on the
447.12s: 28th I literally had over for eight
449.58s: hundred and fifty thousand dollars of
451.14s: capital committed at one point to get
453.54s: the trade to work so in order for me to
456.30s: make and adjust that trade as many times
458.28s: as I needed to I literally had to throw
460.74s: a ton of money at the trade which not
462.30s: everybody has the ability to do that and
464.04s: that is one of the downfalls of these
465.78s: kinds of strategies
467.16s: however also notice what happened on
469.74s: Friday the variance risk premium wasn't
472.68s: there implied volatility was 0.267
475.70s: historic volatility came in at two point
478.44s: I'm sorry 0.285 so all in all we
482.04s: experienced on this day more volatility
484.92s: than was priced into the options and
487.02s: again no surprise I was fighting and I
489.96s: took actually a very small loss on the
492.12s: 27th the day before and again the
495.30s: difference between the variance risk
496.62s: premium is so low implied volatility was
499.26s: 0.281 historic volatility is 0.2799996
504.42s: so the variance between those is Tiny so
507.42s: when we're trading the zero DTE SPX or
510.78s: short-term credit strategies really in
512.64s: anything we have to be mindful about the
515.10s: variance risk premium when it's there
516.78s: when it's not there
518.16s: and then also what phenomenon we're even
520.32s: attempting to trade and take advantage
522.36s: of one last note is I've already
525.60s: mentioned that we typically will find
527.28s: the variance risk premium in certain
528.78s: products you can find it in individual
531.66s: Securities as well it's not that it
533.34s: doesn't exist there it's just less
535.38s: common and you have to do a lot of
537.12s: homework to see if it is there but I
539.46s: don't want to dissuade anybody from
540.96s: attempting to find other places I trade
543.00s: it in other places myself you just kind
545.28s: of have to accept uh the workload that
548.04s: goes with it so hope this video was
550.32s: helpful if there was anything
551.04s: revolutionary in here for you please
552.72s: throw it in the comments let other
553.98s: people identify and connect some light
555.78s: bulbs for them and until next time keep
558.12s: on being an outlier don't forget to
559.62s: subscribe catch you guys later
