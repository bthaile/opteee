0.04s: if you already have a bunch of money
1.16s: this video is not for you this video is
2.80s: for people like myself who grew up poor
5.84s: and didn't learn this from anybody there
8.04s: was nobody to teach it to me so this is
10.28s: stuff that I've learned over the last
12.04s: decade and a half of focusing on finance
14.68s: incredibly hard after being introduced
17.40s: to the concept of investing by a high
19.68s: school teacher if it wasn't for that
21.28s: dude my path would have been completely
23.72s: different and I want to be abundantly
25.64s: clear I really am nobody special I'm not
27.76s: the smartest guy in the group not the
29.12s: dumbest guy in the group very average
30.64s: across the board so the main goal for
32.60s: this video is to walk you through the
34.56s: exact road map I used to become a
38.20s: millionaire in my late 20s and it sounds
40.64s: kind of crazy but once you start looking
42.80s: at some of this stuff in a different way
44.72s: you realize that it's quite possible and
46.88s: no it's not being anything like this guy
48.84s: I don't know anything about this I
49.76s: literally just looked up on Google uh
51.88s: Finance Guru Jet and this is what pops
54.56s: up but we have a dude that I guess was a
56.40s: finance influencer that went bankrupt
58.08s: it's none of this you're not going to
58.92s: see me hopping on fake Jets or I guess
61.12s: they have this thing in La where you
63.04s: just go take pictures on a fake jet
66.28s: stage which is also fascinating you're
68.12s: waste of money it's more so actually
70.36s: about this how I went from walking
72.92s: through metal detectors every day to go
75.24s: to high school working around lots of
77.84s: different people with different
79.16s: motivations in their life a lot of them
81.28s: gang banging and dealing drugs and I
84.36s: decided I didn't want to do that but I
86.20s: didn't know what to do so I was working
88.12s: a lot of different odd jobs as a young
90.00s: dude in High School junior high school
91.64s: but then a teacher introduced me to
93.36s: investing and that introduction sent me
96.40s: down a completely different path it's
98.96s: how when we were recently in Alaska we
101.16s: got to do a last minute decision to rent
103.40s: a private helicopter and go fly around
105.76s: go check out glaciers how we get to go
107.68s: travel around Norway how I get to have
109.40s: fun cars and build them because no I'm
111.76s: not just uh buy cool looking cars cuz I
114.80s: think people will like me nobody will
116.28s: like me anyways it's just cuz I like
117.72s: cars I like to work on them I like to go
119.32s: diving like to go to Africa I like to
121.52s: experience life so I went from a place
123.88s: where most people will never do this to
125.92s: being able to do this and it came down
127.88s: to literally these Concepts I'm about to
130.40s: share with you now I want to be super
131.92s: clear I'm actually not going to talk
133.32s: about trading at all in this video so
135.92s: your mileage may vary what that means is
138.20s: through my application of the trading
140.28s: skill set I was able to rapidly
142.32s: accelerate my time frame the reality is
144.44s: trading is not for a lot of people so
146.80s: this overall base case is going to talk
149.40s: about a generally applicable approach
152.48s: for most people that's feasible not
154.88s: banking on somebody being good at
157.16s: trading or maybe being able to land this
159.04s: really high paying job it's a little bit
160.72s: more of a middle ground so let's take a
162.68s: look at this together the first thing I
164.08s: want to start with what are the
165.56s: probabilities here you most of you know
167.88s: from my channel I am a statistics minded
170.28s: person and I want to know the
171.76s: probabilities of things so if we take a
173.64s: look across the US there's about 99.2%
176.44s: millionaires that's not high but that's
178.64s: not abysmally low we're not talking sub
180.80s: 2% we're talking about a difficult
183.60s: Benchmark to hit but this isn't insanely
186.80s: difficult because if you imagine the way
188.24s: most people go through their lives they
190.20s: clearly will probably not land anywhere
191.96s: near this because they're too busy using
194.36s: self wealth depletion habits to deplete
197.88s: their wealth as compared to build it so
199.60s: no shock here then we also see that the
201.72s: average age of a millionaire is 61 and
204.76s: if we look at the average retirement age
206.88s: it's later in this same period of time
210.16s: 60s so that doesn't sound super great to
212.88s: me because the idea is to try and create
215.88s: this wealth earlier so that you have
217.92s: more freedom you have more autonomy what
219.96s: I try to tell people is that money in no
222.16s: way will make you happy but if you were
224.08s: happy before money money is a massive
227.12s: accelerator it is just a huge value ad
231.12s: so if you're looking at becoming a
232.52s: millionaire thinking making a bunch of
234.20s: money then you'll become happy you won't
236.56s: it's not how it works however what I try
238.40s: to remind people is that it's an
239.92s: amplifier so we want to try to get to
242.32s: this sooner how do we do it this is it
244.56s: this literally is it so I'm going to go
246.28s: through 13 ancillary details on the
249.16s: right hand side in a second but it boils
251.16s: down to executing this so on the leand
254.20s: side you see three wealth levers we have
256.64s: good savings rate we have investing and
258.80s: we have income why do we start with this
262.12s: well the reason why we start with
263.20s: savings is because you need something to
266.12s: invest right so you can't just save your
269.92s: way to wealth Eric what do you mean
272.04s: that's crazy you're supposed to save of
273.76s: course you're supposed to save but let
275.48s: me show you an example as to why you
277.72s: cannot save your way to wealth if we
280.04s: take a look at this compound growth
281.52s: calculator over here you'll notice a few
283.60s: things I'll slide it over a little bit
284.76s: more you'll notice a few things the
286.32s: first thing is if we look at $5,000 and
289.00s: we look at over a 30-year time frame I'm
291.48s: going to turn this rate of return down
293.16s: to zero and I'm going to say that we're
295.72s: really good Savers we're going to save
297.20s: $500 a month on average in 30 years you
301.16s: have
302.92s: $185,000 you did a good job saving it
305.64s: doesn't matter because you need your
308.12s: money to work for you you need this
311.32s: compounding clock to start so let's look
314.16s: at an alternate scenario same thing
315.96s: starting five grand saving $500 a month
318.36s: 30e time frame instead let's add a
321.16s: generally average Market return of 10%
323.88s: what happens whoa now you're a
325.64s: millionaire this right here is what made
328.44s: you a millionaire versus is a sub
331.00s: 200,000 air there is no saving your way
333.92s: to wealth you have to invest full stop
337.44s: period you have to invest okay let's
339.64s: talk about some of these friction points
341.76s: with respect to investing we already
344.04s: know we can't save our way to wealth we
345.92s: need to save super aggressively we know
349.16s: that we need to invest and we know that
351.24s: income is going to be an important Point
353.00s: simply because it's here we haven't
354.16s: talked about it yet but we will well
355.56s: let's talk about this idea of savings
357.24s: rate and starting to invest the very
359.24s: first thing once we understand how this
361.80s: process works is to just start don't
365.24s: wait until you have enough don't wait
367.76s: until it's convenient don't wait until
369.96s: it's a good time there's all these
371.56s: different reasons to delay beginning
373.60s: this process and the only thing this
375.64s: does is delay the outcome just start you
378.40s: have 25 bucks start there start adding
380.40s: $25 to your investing account monthly no
382.88s: matter what just do it every single
384.20s: month into perpetuity it's a starting
385.88s: point what we're focusing on is actually
387.76s: building a habit once that habit is
390.12s: built and you see the value it becomes
392.72s: easier to embrace delayed gratification
396.28s: and then instead of spending that $100
398.16s: to go out with your friends you think
399.96s: okay well I don't have to go out you
401.44s: know three times this week I can go out
403.24s: twice with my friends this week I can
405.64s: balance tradeoffs go out twice sacrifice
408.88s: the third save the money that I would
410.44s: have spent on the third and feed this
412.96s: machine that's the entire idea in the
415.56s: beginning so once we start we don't stop
418.16s: we have a bad month doesn't matter you
420.08s: still put in your minimum 25 bucks 50
422.20s: bucks whatever you Define compliance is
424.80s: non-negotiable has to happen then we
427.00s: have this idea of building a vision why
429.08s: does building a vision matter because it
431.24s: helps us contextualize the tradeoffs
434.72s: that we're going to have to make so when
436.64s: we think about this idea of trying to
439.72s: expand our income one of the biggest
442.48s: errors people make is if you're making a
444.84s: good salary making $100,000 a year
446.76s: whatever it is and you're saving and
448.80s: then you get a pay bump right now you're
450.16s: making $120,000 a year did a good job
452.32s: you got a great pay bump the problem is
453.96s: most people spend that $20,000 they
456.36s: expand their life style to fit their new
459.08s: income level guess what we just wasted
461.28s: perfectly good money that could have
462.88s: been put into our savings rate to
465.36s: accelerate this clock from 30 years we
468.28s: can cut this way down if we're smart so
472.12s: let's take a look if instead we do this
474.32s: $500 a month let's take a look if we do
476.52s: $750 a month on average 30 years you a
479.68s: million doar at the 500 bucks at$ 750
482.60s: you have
483.76s: $1.6 million so now instead of hitting
486.76s: that millionaire threshold in year 30
489.08s: you actually cross it in year 26 you've
492.36s: cut 4 years off of this timeline by
495.12s: Saving an additional 250 per month this
497.32s: just accelerates more and more from
499.68s: there the only way this continues to
501.48s: accelerate is that if you establish a
503.48s: lifestyle that you're comfortable with
504.88s: and then as you find ways to make more
506.76s: money you do not grow your lifestyle you
509.52s: keep your lifestyle the same and you
511.20s: funnel this new Gap here into your
513.84s: investing account that's it that's how
515.32s: this clock goes further and further to
517.48s: the left and if we take a look that is
519.44s: the entire premise here behind slow is
521.96s: fast because a lot of people really
524.28s: struggle to see the utility of saving
525.96s: $100 a month it can be very difficult to
528.64s: actually picture how impactful saving
531.24s: just $100 a month can be so then you
533.84s: forego doing it and you do it again and
535.72s: again and again the problem is that
537.64s: money builds over time small amounts of
541.00s: money still compound I just showed you a
543.12s: scenario where if you saves an extra
544.64s: $250 a month you essentially add
547.52s: $6,000 into your net worth picture at
549.92s: the end of this time frame so you have
551.40s: to appreciate the small steps because
554.36s: they matter so we have savings rate
556.88s: build a super effective savings rate and
559.52s: maintain it maintain your lifestyle
561.28s: start investing right away dollar cost
563.24s: average every single month don't skip a
565.28s: month I have a blog post that I'll link
567.56s: to below that walks through this how to
569.60s: start investing if you know nothing I'll
571.28s: throw a link to that below you can read
572.68s: through it it's literally step by step
574.44s: it'll get you started in less than 30
575.72s: minutes then expand your income you have
578.08s: to make some decisions are you working
579.72s: at a high earning career field where
582.12s: working for the next promotion makes
583.52s: sense if you're working with industry
585.64s: maybe you actually don't get comfortable
587.76s: at your current job because it's
589.24s: comfortable cushy you know what to do
590.60s: it's a routine and maybe you're actually
592.20s: aggressively moving every 2 to 3 years
594.32s: because guess what if you work at a
595.68s: place and they give you a standard 3 5%
597.92s: pay increase that doesn't really matter
599.76s: that much especially if you look at
601.44s: people who jump jobs every 2 3 years
603.28s: they tend to get a 10% plus pay increase
606.04s: easy some of them can be 25% plus so
608.64s: there's no catching up with that staying
610.12s: at the same place you have to be really
611.56s: strategic or you can do like I did which
613.92s: is start hustling when I was in high
616.36s: school I used to split wood for a guy
619.00s: that I hunted on his property I used to
620.60s: move Shale for him I used to sell
622.24s: Christmas trees I used to take people's
623.88s: trash out literally I used to shovel
625.52s: people's walkways and their driveways
627.64s: when it's snowing then in College I got
630.04s: into flipping cars I would buy broken
632.40s: cars fix them sell them same thing with
634.56s: motorcycles I kept doing that all the
636.32s: way through my time in the Marine Corps
637.76s: you have to get Scrappy but the idea is
640.28s: if you build a vision that then you
642.28s: truly can see yourself what life would
644.92s: look like with this amount of money it
647.20s: starts to make you want to save more
649.36s: money so then it's not 30 years so that
651.84s: if you start taking these slow Steps
654.20s: early this will speed things up
657.28s: massively so even though it is delayed
659.36s: gratification we're talking about
660.72s: multi-year periods the more you delay
663.60s: gratification the faster you end up
666.12s: getting to the spot you want to be this
667.80s: is exactly how you become a millionaire
670.24s: no there's no easy hacks it's building a
672.48s: plan and executing on it without fail be
675.88s: an outlier see youall later
