0.00s: What's up outliers? Today we're going to talk about the myth of selling options for income.
5.76s: Now, it's kind of like a myth in quotations as well because there's new wants to this.
10.40s: The fact of the matter is, is can you trade options or sell options for income shore?
15.04s: However, it's going to look completely different than what you think it does based on different
21.08s: kind of videos that you see that talk about this on YouTube. And realistically, you have
25.72s: yourself the audience to thank for this because YouTubers are incentivized if they want to grow
30.68s: their channel to make stuff that people are going to click on, which is junk like this.
34.84s: Things that would make you believe that you're going to get this $1,500 a week and, you know,
39.56s: weekly income. The fact of the matter is it's going to look completely different. However,
43.96s: there is a way to make this work. And I want to show you how at the end of the video,
48.52s: I'm going to show you an absolutely accurate example of how this typically can go so that you
56.52s: understand why these kinds of things will set you up for failure and how to instead set something
62.12s: up that might be a little bit more robust. So let's talk about this idea of selling options for
68.84s: income. What are some of the common approaches we see? Well, selling premium, as we know, and
74.12s: this is because traders confuse a really important transaction, which we'll talk about.
82.20s: You'll see stuff like cash secure puts covered calls, the wheel, these are all very, very common
88.20s: for trying to sell options for income. However, again, there's some important details missing.
95.72s: So let's talk about this. What is income income? As money is received, especially in a regular
100.92s: basis for work or through investments, notice how there's a very important, very important part
107.48s: of this on a regular basis. This gets completely destroyed in options trading. And again,
115.72s: I will show you how. So if we think about what most people think when they're selling an option,
125.56s: they think that that credit received is their income. So if I sell a put for a dollar,
133.88s: that $100 that enters my account, they will think that's income, but it's not. And I'll show you why.
143.00s: If you have a $100,000 account, and let's say that you sell puts, whatever combination
148.20s: expiration is under that matters, and let's say you collect the $1000. Here's what happens in your
152.92s: account. Your net liquidating value does not change. It's still $100,000. Then your cash and sweep
165.16s: will go up. So this is essentially assuming this $100,000 is not in an active trade. This is maybe
172.52s: just in short puts or something. The cash and sweep will go up by the credit you receive. But notice
180.76s: how your net lick doesn't change. This is because this $1000 is tied to a position that is open.
193.88s: So yes, you can withdraw that $1000 out, but then your net liquidating value doesn't stay at
201.96s: $100,000. It goes down to $99,000. So then it's still tied to an open trade. So then if this trade
211.00s: doesn't go on our favor, and you have to close it for a loss, now your account is even lower still.
217.24s: So this idea is possible, but it's going to look completely different. So let's talk about how
224.76s: this might work and the way that I think about it. The first thing that we need to do if we're
229.96s: trading options for income is completely get rid of this idea of selling is the way to income.
236.60s: Just completely throw that out. The next thing is to completely reconfigure the way that you think
242.28s: of income. So here's what I would do. I would start by defining how much money I need on a monthly
250.92s: basis, then zoom that out to an annual basis. And then I would pad that number because life happens.
258.52s: Things go sideways. So if you think you need $X,000 per month, give it a small buffer on top of that.
267.32s: And you also have to account for things like taxes. What do you actually need to make in order to net
274.36s: what you're trying to pull out? You have to have those details ironed out. Then what I would do
280.36s: is actually save at the very least one full year of this padded cost. And then I completely throw out
291.64s: this idea of selling options for income and I trade normally. That's it. And here's the way that
297.32s: this works. If we think about our return path over the course of a month, it looks different
305.40s: than linear. And I'll show you. Got my handy dandy drawing pad. So if we draw a time series
314.28s: and we break this out into months, you will have some months that are positive. You will have some
321.88s: months that are negative. Some months might be more positive than others. Some might be a little
327.48s: less positive. What most people think about is selling that option this month within this time frame.
335.56s: And then withdrawing that money out. And then that's their income. This is almost assuredly going to
344.28s: fail. And I would really, really challenge. I've not seen somebody successful in doing this. And
350.92s: I've been doing this for over 18 years. Here's a much better way. If we think of this same time
356.92s: series in the fact that our returns might be slightly lumpy, but at the end of the year,
362.04s: they're positive. Well, that gives us something to work with. What it means is that if in month
368.20s: zero, the front month, whatever that is, you withdraw your money out and you continue to trade normal.
374.44s: Instead of trying to trade this month gains and use that for your income. If you save this
383.24s: full year in those gains, pat up month 12. So then you're really withdrawing last year's month
391.80s: one if that helps you conceptualize this. So the whole point is that you're withdrawing down on this
398.84s: one year runway that you gave yourself. And then as you make money, you're just plusing up the
405.64s: back end. Why is this so important? It's because when you start trading for a living, your entire
411.08s: psychology changes. Everything becomes very, very different. And it's because your livelihood
418.28s: becomes completely dependent on your ability to generate money. And I've never met anybody that
424.12s: hasn't had a bad month. So if you're trying to approach this in a way where you give yourself this
430.44s: month month's money based on what you make this month, that is about as robust as a sheet of paper.
437.24s: It doesn't make any sense. If you want this to actually work, you cannot approach it this way.
442.92s: You have to be methodical. If this were me and the way that I do it is I don't even think about one
450.36s: year. I think three to five years. But I'm also overly conservative. The reason being is because I
456.04s: have my mom who I take care of financially. So it's all stuff that's in the back of my mind.
461.56s: That's why mine's going to be a little bit more conservative. You have to figure out what's right
464.84s: for you. But by giving yourself more of a runway, it gives you time to have bumpy paths. And it
471.16s: also gives you time to figure things out if markets change. Because guess what? Markets are
476.68s: continually changing. Okay. I promised you an example to demonstrate clearly how this works and why
484.36s: it works. So let me show you. Take a trip with me back in time. It is now two December 2024.
491.48s: Apple just finished a pretty serious consolidation range and it's starting to break out to the upside.
497.88s: Apple is literally seen as like a tech dividend, it's just a tech safe haven. It's like a dividend
504.84s: stock for big holders. And it's because it's so stable. Trillion dollar market cap massive company
512.76s: continually does well. Starting to break out, you decide to enter into your position that you
519.00s: are going to use to generate your monthly income by selling options. Let's take a look at an example.
525.16s: So we're going to look at two different scenarios. We're going to look at the covered call scenario
528.84s: and then we're going to look at the short put scenario. Now don't worry about all the stuff that's
533.08s: on the screen. I just want to use this as a way to help us keep track of what's going on. As you
537.48s: can tell, I took us back in time. We're going to go forward in time. So what I'm simulating here
543.08s: is it's two December and we just bought 500 shares of Apple at 240 bucks. Cost us 120,000 dollars.
552.12s: I'm not worrying about how much money we need and income and all that stuff. None of that
556.44s: matters for this example. So if we are to trade this covered call, that means on two December when
564.20s: Apple is 239 240, we're going to sell about a month out the 27 December 245s, a 35 delta, we're going
572.12s: to like $2.49. We'll do a five lot and that'll give us 1,245 bucks. That's for this month,
579.56s: this front month. Okay, cool. Now let's fast forward time and see what happens.
586.68s: Okay, so this is finishing loading. You can see that the stock has gone up from our entry point
592.12s: of two December, which is right here. This candle right here and it's gone up. It's gone the
597.48s: direction that we want. However, we have a little bit of a problem because our position is now
603.08s: slightly underwater. So let's take a look at what this would look like. Using optioned prices
609.48s: for this day, we would have to close those five contracts at 977 when the stock was at 254.
619.16s: This realizes a loss of 3640. Notice the emphasis on realizes the loss. Now somebody might say,
625.88s: oh, I would have managed it earlier. It's all effectively the same thing that comes out in the
630.12s: wash or oh, well, let's just let the shares go. You can do that. But then in this scenario, it
635.00s: actually will, it will work out worse on the back end and you'll see why. So the main thing that I
641.64s: want to show you is that if you sold these calls and you took your initial premium out and you
651.16s: withdrew it, you can do that. The problem is you will have to then put in money because you're at
659.16s: 3640 in the red that you have to cover. And right now, unless you're in a portfolio margin account,
665.08s: if you don't have access to margin, your cash is used. You bought this stock. So then in order to
671.08s: cover this, your cash and sweep right now would be 1245 if you left the money in there. So that means
678.28s: give that 1245 back. But then you have to come up with a difference between these two,
683.16s: which is 2395. You either need to add that money to the account or you need to sell some of your
688.84s: shares in order to cover that cost. Okay, great. So let's say that we don't want to do that. And
694.68s: instead we choose to roll our option. Okay, cool. So in this scenario, 27 December, we go to the
705.00s: 250's. So we get our strike five points up. We go out to 21 Feb. So you notice that we had to go
711.48s: really far out in time now in order to get this roll. We're still in the money at a 63 delta.
716.60s: We get $12.60. This gives you $63, $100 total credit. And that puts your PNL at this point at 2660
726.60s: if this expires out of the money. So this doesn't look too bad. Okay, well, let's think about it.
732.36s: Let's just assume in this scenario that I just showed you that you're able to, if you just go to
737.88s: expiration, if you're able to take these down for $0. Well, let's think about what just happened.
744.12s: What happened is you netted 2660 except you started this trade on two December and now you're in
752.20s: 21 Feb. So what's the problem here? You have December, January, February, three months.
762.28s: Over the course of that three months, whereas your initial trade was meant to bring in 1245 of your
767.64s: income, you know, 2660 of income. You are woefully short. Now again, I'm not saying this is bad.
776.60s: This can come out in the wash if you give it a long enough runway. But again, if the idea is to use
782.92s: this month's income or withdrawing this month, that's where you run into your problem. Now,
788.84s: let's take a look at the short put side of the equation. It's challenging as well. So while I
795.24s: simulated the call side of the equation, I simultaneously simulated the put side of the equation
800.76s: essentially using roundabout the same amount of money. So this scenario pretends this is not here.
807.40s: So you don't get the money from the calls. You just get this. So this takes us again from two
813.48s: December into 21 Feb. Now there's a problem here. So if we then take a look again at the map,
824.52s: this one's a little bit closer, right? Because you made 1035, then you made 2400. This puts you closer
830.12s: onto the target that you want for your income. However, if we fast forward time now, I'm just going
836.52s: to fast forward it essentially. I'm just going to come out on demand and look at it currently.
842.36s: If we take a look at what happened, I simulated starting to sell puts from here and just taking
847.56s: into expiration. Again, we can say like, oh, manage it at 50%. Or I would roll it or I would do this
853.00s: that the other thing. It doesn't matter. It's just different versions of the same outcome.
857.64s: In this scenario, what ends up happening is you get a couple successful trades upfront. You can
864.04s: see that. But what I want to show you is the big problem with this. The big problem with this
871.80s: is this. If we go for our next option from 21 Feb, we sell that for 33 cents. We get the 240s.
882.12s: We get $4.77. We started a 30 delta. We do five of those that gives us our 2385 credit. But
889.96s: notice this. This is a big problem because if we take a look at what happened on 17 April, let's
896.28s: just take a look at 17 April on the chart. You can see 17 April is in here. Way down here.
905.72s: And we started selling these puts way back here. So what ends up happening is again, you can take
912.52s: assignment. But if you take assignment, you're not going to be able to sell calls above your basis,
915.88s: that whole bit. If instead you choose to roll them, what you can do. The problem with the role
921.32s: is that you're going to have to close these for $44. That's going to realize a net PNL of 19,615.
930.44s: That's a net loss on that first trade. So this is what your PNL would look like down 16,180.
938.52s: And then if you on 17 April roll those out to the 240s, so you don't get a basis adjustment.
945.48s: But take a look at how far out in time you have to go. This should be June of 24. Look at how far
951.40s: out in time you have to take this trade. You now have to go 64 days out in time. That's a problem.
961.40s: I realize the 24 25s were off. I just fixed them all. But you can see you are now at a point where
970.60s: you take this first trade down. You made you made your 1035. Second trade comes down. You made
978.20s: 2400. Third trade comes down. You're down 19 K. So then you put this new roll on collecting a net
986.20s: credit of 17 cents. You get $22,085 bucks. Your total PNL here right now is positive,
996.44s: $59.05. So this doesn't look that bad. But again, if we're trading this for income, what just happened?
1003.88s: If I took these two out, I withdrew these two trades because those were the credit I made up front.
1010.44s: Then I have to add a bunch of money to the account in order to cover this position.
1015.96s: And then I'm also again, we started this in December, December, January, February, March, April,
1022.84s: May, June, seven months. After seven months, your PNL would be $59.05. You're now behind pace again.
1032.20s: This doesn't even take into account the scenario where you might have to roll another time in a row.
1038.44s: That sucks. So now what? The point here is that rolling and managing these trades is completely
1048.52s: doable. It's entirely doable. But the big caveat is that if you are approaching this process,
1056.36s: using the stuff that you might have seen from these kinds of videos, you are entirely set up
1063.88s: for failure. You have to give yourself a longer runway. Be an outlier. See you later.
