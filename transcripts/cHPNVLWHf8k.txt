0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update for us. We have three things on the agenda. I'm
5.46s: going to take a look at the FOMC meeting coming up tomorrow, what the probabilities are
11.50s: looking like and kind of what we might expect. Then I'm going to talk a little bit about
16.38s: Chewie because somebody asked me to take a look at the options chain there. And then we'll
20.46s: take a cursory overview of GameStop and see if anything interesting is peeking up in
27.26s: there. So let's get started. What's going on with the broad market? Well, it seems like
33.46s: we are still expecting this rate cut. I can see that across all the different indices,
39.10s: the S&P 500 just hit new all time highs. The cues technology more heavy kind of lagging
46.30s: behind a bit here. And then small caps are actually starting to catch up to near term
50.54s: highs. So right now it looks like the market is still favoring small caps at this point
56.98s: over technology. But the S&P 500 writ large is the leader of the pack. So what that tells
65.34s: me is that the overall growth that we're seeing just in terms of the indices themselves
70.86s: is not actually being driven by tech. And it's worth noting because for such a long period
77.42s: of time, that's been the primary driver of value inside the S&P 500, which has been
83.14s: tech. Now as we're looking at it, we can see XLB. So things that are starting to look
89.02s: at rate cut, being lifting their markets. So things like builders, things like Zillow have
98.06s: been doing really, really well. If we pull up Zillow, you can see things like Home Depot
104.78s: is doing well. So right now the market is kind of starting to gear towards this idea
110.26s: that the rate cuts going to start coming. It looks like it might be at a pretty moderate
113.74s: pace. So you can see real estate is coming up into high. So all in all, there's still
118.82s: that internal rotation within the S&P 500. So now as we take a look at the Fed watch tool,
125.34s: and we take a look at the probabilities, the probability now of a 50 basis point cut
129.66s: is 63%, which is quite high, I think. And obviously that tells us that's where the market
137.02s: is leaning that we're actually going to start with a slightly heavier cut than previously
141.98s: expected. So this tells me a few things. One, that the Fed is starting to move away from
147.38s: this really slow, careful approach, because I did expect them to start with the 25 basis
152.70s: point cut, although they've been, you know, being told that they're late, they're late
156.46s: to the party, you know, it's going to be too late for the recession and that it's still
162.62s: what I thought they would do. Maybe start cutting a little earlier, but then take a lower
166.46s: cut path. And this actually looks pretty aggressive if we take a look at this. So this looks
174.10s: like 50 basis point cut probability right now for the 18th, then the next one, seven,
182.22s: November, 87% probability of 25 basis points, then if we go to December, another 50 basis point
190.46s: cut on top of that. So that would be cutting us about point quarter or so. So that starts to get
195.50s: actually kind of aggressive in this near term, a little more so than I was anticipating,
199.66s: which was essentially going to be quarter, quarter, quarter. So we'll see. Now one of the questions
206.46s: I have due to this is, will the Fed take a pause after one of these cuts, which is TBD? We don't
214.22s: know yet. So from a broad market perspective, I think this will be generally uplifting. I think
218.94s: small caps will continue to enjoy it, although we likely have seen a good bit of the move already,
224.86s: because if we take again a look at something like IWM, which is small caps, you can see it's made
230.70s: this pattern a few times when prior rate cuts were expected to be happening. They ended up not
235.66s: necessarily happening at the time frame, but this is now starting to close in on term highs.
240.94s: And it's really catching up with large caps on the year. If I take a look at my little tracker,
246.22s: the S&P 500 is up 19 and a quarter points. IWM is up 10. So it's still lagging by about half,
252.62s: but if you look at it over the course of the year, it was even zero or slightly negative,
257.42s: pacing well, well, well below the S&P 500. So the S&P 500 obviously is crushing it this year, but
264.78s: the small caps here are starting to catch up a little bit. And then this does start to open the
269.66s: door for a conversation about recession. What does it look like? What's the probability? We actually
273.34s: looked at this a little bit on the live stream yesterday and the probabilities for a recession
277.42s: sometime in 2025 are not insignificant. So I think it's something that traders need to be
283.26s: preparing for, not the doom and gloom style, you know, all the world's crashing down, but definitely
289.66s: have to have a plan in place. Otherwise, it's easy to get caught off sides. So let's take a look at
294.46s: Chewy really fast. And this is generally what I was expecting. I was actually talking about this
299.90s: yesterday. Some people were asking about it. And it looks like a lot of this move is been fueled by
306.14s: its post earnings event, right? Overall, pretty solid earnings that the market liked. And it's been
311.58s: rallying up and out. I know there's a bunch of different theories and thesis and stuff like that.
315.34s: Not going to go into detail on those necessarily just yet. I'm kind of following it from a standard
320.46s: market perspective here, which is volume expanding around earnings. We saw volume materialize for
327.66s: a few days post earnings. A lot of really strong buy volume as we hit this kind of term swing low.
334.22s: And then volume is now starting to siphon back out. So we'll see how long that volume keeps up
339.66s: and continues to move to a, but from a technical perspective, it looks good to the upside. It still
344.38s: likes where it's at kind of the way I would be playing it is downside at like 30 and change,
349.02s: maybe just a little bit below that. And then it looks like near term price target would be something
353.26s: around 35 again. We looked at this on the livestream. Yes, I'm just kind of using historic
357.66s: time frames to come up with just some thesis. Now, if we take a look at the options chain and we
363.58s: take a look at the overall open interest, it's super, super quiet. So there's 250,000 calls against
370.86s: 200, 6000 puts. There's really just nothing in here that's like super interesting to me from
377.02s: an options trading perspective because it is so quiet total volume today 21,000 calls versus 12,000
383.34s: puts. So this is the kind of thing that if I see crazy volume, it almost always sneak like I
389.66s: almost always can see it because otherwise it's generally very, very quiet in here. So we can see
396.54s: that there was some 32 and a half in 20 set that were traded, but these are kind of towards the
401.82s: mid a little closer to the bid. So maybe sold you can't directly tell. But even this is large of
408.38s: a quantity trade is this is it's still not like absolutely massive or anything like that.
413.66s: So yeah, the option chain in here just looks generally quiet. And then that's, you know, not good or
417.66s: bad. It just means it's not super active. When I look through the volatility, I don't see anything
423.58s: sticking out at me as anomalous. It looks like, you know, front term, vol is a little bit higher and
428.62s: then tailors down as we go further out. And then it'll probably start peeking up out here,
432.38s: which is when I would assume next earnings is or something like that. So yeah, that's chewy
437.50s: and a nutshell. And then let's take a quick look for options data on chewy out of curiosity. And
445.66s: we can take a look and see if anything interesting has been popping up in here. And we'll take a look
452.38s: this week so far. We'll take a look at the 16th and the 17th. And we'll start with the calls,
457.10s: seeing if there's any big purchases. And again, it doesn't really look like much on the put side,
463.34s: not much. Again, all really small trades. Let's go to the bid, all small trades. So yeah,
468.86s: there's nothing really going on in here as far as I'm concerned. That doesn't mean that there's
473.50s: nothing at all. But it's just generally quiet. So next, let's take a quick look at GameStop
480.70s: because GameStop is in a really interesting point to me, believe it or not, we are hugging this,
489.50s: what I perceive to be support. Again, I've had this line drawn for some time now because I expect this
495.26s: to continue to serve as support to some degree. And price has been hovering right on top of it.
500.46s: So I am eager to see does price continue consolidating and start making an advance up? Or does it
506.14s: start penetrating below? If it starts penetrating below, I don't love that. And it starts to look like
511.66s: 18 is probably next on that list. And then hopefully not below that volume is still very light
519.66s: and continuing to dry up. So we can see today there was 6.3 million volume sale volume of that was
527.58s: 3.9 million and buy volume is like 2.36. So mostly sale volume is still very light. So overall from
536.14s: an equity perspective, it looks just looks very quiet. Now, one note I was actually texting with
541.26s: Newton about this a bit last last night is I'm talking with one of my buddies this week who was
547.10s: an options market maker. And now he kind of runs his own firm. And if there's anything in particular,
552.46s: you want me to talk with him about, let me know. I'm happy to try to collect as much as I can.
557.18s: But the questions if you guys have them, try to like form them out well, right? Because I'm not
562.94s: going to ask like super basic stuff because it's just kind of a waste of their time. I always will do
568.38s: my best to get to the bottom. And if it's something basic that I can answer, I will always try to
573.74s: answer it for you. It's not to answer the question on their behalf. It's just if it's a standard process
579.34s: thing, then obviously I'm not going to take it to them. But if it's something a little more nuanced
585.82s: somewhat like that, happy to bring those. Some of the stuff I'm going to be talking with them about
589.02s: is kind of dissecting some of the recent moves we saw not just in GameStop. They don't
592.46s: specialize in GameStop. Again, they're a market maker. They just know about the broader process.
596.46s: But we can learn a little bit about some of the recent moves. I'm actually very interested
601.50s: to understand some of their hedging activities. So yeah, that's kind of the direction I'm taking it.
607.18s: But happy to serve as a conduit for other folks. That's a big part of what I try to do.
612.86s: So let's take a look at the option Shane. And let's take a look at the total open interest.
619.34s: And we still have even more call OI now, 660,000 calls versus 300,000 puts. This is continuing to build.
627.18s: And this is exceeding that two to one ratio pretty significantly at this point. I still see the
633.10s: same spread across all these different explorations. I see a ton of calls traded today against puts.
639.18s: 89,000 calls versus 13,700 puts. And I see most of them coming in at the offer above. So we're
648.38s: buying those. So yeah, overall, the option chain in GameStop is still again on a relative basis
656.22s: quiet. But it's definitely not silent to any degree. So if we take a look at kind of this week
663.26s: so far, and we get rid of the bids and we'll get rid of the puts. We're now seeing just some
671.02s: further term explorations. We already talked about these. So this is nothing novel. But this is
676.46s: still relatively new for GameStop where we're seeing these longer term positions being built out.
680.78s: Now in the near term, it still looks a little bit quiet as far as I can tell. But as always,
686.86s: if there's anything that's jumping out at you or that you want to take a look at, let me know
690.30s: for the GME live stream this coming Saturday, we're going to go into part three of analyzing
696.46s: worried kiddies old trades, which Newton and I talked a lot about that because he has a lot of ideas
702.78s: about some of the behaviors. And I want to see if we can pick up any of those based on what we've
707.58s: been seeing so far because I definitely am getting a really good feel for the way that Rory and
711.74s: Kitty was thinking about his options trades, building them and then managing them. So we're getting
716.38s: to the point where he's starting to unwind position. So I can learn more about that, which looks
720.06s: way more based on time than value. Normally when we're trading options, we try to pick a point
725.82s: where we think something might go. And I actually don't see that so far from him. I see him primarily
731.02s: managing by time, which is fascinating. So we'll dive further into that. And then for the live stream
736.94s: tomorrow, I'm going to start maybe like some sort of mini series about trading meme stocks with
743.58s: options. This is from a recommendation from one of our viewers. And I think it's a really great idea
748.30s: because there's a lot of options traders or a lot of meme stock traders that start trading
753.42s: meme stocks. They add options and then they get torn up just because a lack of fundamentals.
758.86s: So the goal is to use that as an opportunity to talk a little bit about the specific profit
762.70s: mechanisms, how to think about them a little more appropriately. I think at least to structure
768.06s: ideas that might be more representative of the thesis rather than just getting burned by buying
773.42s: cheap out of the money options that decay away in front of your face. So that's what's coming up.
777.18s: As always, let me know if there's anything we should take a look at. Be an outlier. I'll see you all
