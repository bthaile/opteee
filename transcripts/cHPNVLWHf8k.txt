 What's up, outliers? Quick market update for us. We have three things on the agenda. I'm going to take a look at the FOMC meeting coming up tomorrow, what the probabilities are looking like and kind of what we might expect. Then I'm going to talk a little bit about Chewie because somebody asked me to take a look at the options chain there. And then we'll take a cursory overview of GameStop and see if anything interesting is peeking up in there. So let's get started. What's going on with the broad market? Well, it seems like we are still expecting this rate cut. I can see that across all the different indices, the S&P 500 just hit new all time highs. The cues technology more heavy kind of lagging behind a bit here. And then small caps are actually starting to catch up to near term highs. So right now it looks like the market is still favoring small caps at this point over technology. But the S&P 500 writ large is the leader of the pack. So what that tells me is that the overall growth that we're seeing just in terms of the indices themselves is not actually being driven by tech. And it's worth noting because for such a long period of time, that's been the primary driver of value inside the S&P 500, which has been tech. Now as we're looking at it, we can see XLB. So things that are starting to look at rate cut, being lifting their markets. So things like builders, things like Zillow have been doing really, really well. If we pull up Zillow, you can see things like Home Depot is doing well. So right now the market is kind of starting to gear towards this idea that the rate cuts going to start coming. It looks like it might be at a pretty moderate pace. So you can see real estate is coming up into high. So all in all, there's still that internal rotation within the S&P 500. So now as we take a look at the Fed watch tool, and we take a look at the probabilities, the probability now of a 50 basis point cut is 63%, which is quite high, I think. And obviously that tells us that's where the market is leaning that we're actually going to start with a slightly heavier cut than previously expected. So this tells me a few things. One, that the Fed is starting to move away from this really slow, careful approach, because I did expect them to start with the 25 basis point cut, although they've been, you know, being told that they're late, they're late to the party, you know, it's going to be too late for the recession and that it's still what I thought they would do. Maybe start cutting a little earlier, but then take a lower cut path. And this actually looks pretty aggressive if we take a look at this. So this looks like 50 basis point cut probability right now for the 18th, then the next one, seven, November, 87% probability of 25 basis points, then if we go to December, another 50 basis point cut on top of that. So that would be cutting us about point quarter or so. So that starts to get actually kind of aggressive in this near term, a little more so than I was anticipating, which was essentially going to be quarter, quarter, quarter. So we'll see. Now one of the questions I have due to this is, will the Fed take a pause after one of these cuts, which is TBD? We don't know yet. So from a broad market perspective, I think this will be generally uplifting. I think small caps will continue to enjoy it, although we likely have seen a good bit of the move already, because if we take again a look at something like IWM, which is small caps, you can see it's made this pattern a few times when prior rate cuts were expected to be happening. They ended up not necessarily happening at the time frame, but this is now starting to close in on term highs. And it's really catching up with large caps on the year. If I take a look at my little tracker, the S&P 500 is up 19 and a quarter points. IWM is up 10. So it's still lagging by about half, but if you look at it over the course of the year, it was even zero or slightly negative, pacing well, well, well below the S&P 500. So the S&P 500 obviously is crushing it this year, but the small caps here are starting to catch up a little bit. And then this does start to open the door for a conversation about recession. What does it look like? What's the probability? We actually looked at this a little bit on the live stream yesterday and the probabilities for a recession sometime in 2025 are not insignificant. So I think it's something that traders need to be preparing for, not the doom and gloom style, you know, all the world's crashing down, but definitely have to have a plan in place. Otherwise, it's easy to get caught off sides. So let's take a look at Chewy really fast. And this is generally what I was expecting. I was actually talking about this yesterday. Some people were asking about it. And it looks like a lot of this move is been fueled by its post earnings event, right? Overall, pretty solid earnings that the market liked. And it's been rallying up and out. I know there's a bunch of different theories and thesis and stuff like that. Not going to go into detail on those necessarily just yet. I'm kind of following it from a standard market perspective here, which is volume expanding around earnings. We saw volume materialize for a few days post earnings. A lot of really strong buy volume as we hit this kind of term swing low. And then volume is now starting to siphon back out. So we'll see how long that volume keeps up and continues to move to a, but from a technical perspective, it looks good to the upside. It still likes where it's at kind of the way I would be playing it is downside at like 30 and change, maybe just a little bit below that. And then it looks like near term price target would be something around 35 again. We looked at this on the livestream. Yes, I'm just kind of using historic time frames to come up with just some thesis. Now, if we take a look at the options chain and we take a look at the overall open interest, it's super, super quiet. So there's 250,000 calls against 200, 6000 puts. There's really just nothing in here that's like super interesting to me from an options trading perspective because it is so quiet total volume today 21,000 calls versus 12,000 puts. So this is the kind of thing that if I see crazy volume, it almost always sneak like I almost always can see it because otherwise it's generally very, very quiet in here. So we can see that there was some 32 and a half in 20 set that were traded, but these are kind of towards the mid a little closer to the bid. So maybe sold you can't directly tell. But even this is large of a quantity trade is this is it's still not like absolutely massive or anything like that. So yeah, the option chain in here just looks generally quiet. And then that's, you know, not good or bad. It just means it's not super active. When I look through the volatility, I don't see anything sticking out at me as anomalous. It looks like, you know, front term, vol is a little bit higher and then tailors down as we go further out. And then it'll probably start peeking up out here, which is when I would assume next earnings is or something like that. So yeah, that's chewy and a nutshell. And then let's take a quick look for options data on chewy out of curiosity. And we can take a look and see if anything interesting has been popping up in here. And we'll take a look this week so far. We'll take a look at the 16th and the 17th. And we'll start with the calls, seeing if there's any big purchases. And again, it doesn't really look like much on the put side, not much. Again, all really small trades. Let's go to the bid, all small trades. So yeah, there's nothing really going on in here as far as I'm concerned. That doesn't mean that there's nothing at all. But it's just generally quiet. So next, let's take a quick look at GameStop because GameStop is in a really interesting point to me, believe it or not, we are hugging this, what I perceive to be support. Again, I've had this line drawn for some time now because I expect this to continue to serve as support to some degree. And price has been hovering right on top of it. So I am eager to see does price continue consolidating and start making an advance up? Or does it start penetrating below? If it starts penetrating below, I don't love that. And it starts to look like 18 is probably next on that list. And then hopefully not below that volume is still very light and continuing to dry up. So we can see today there was 6.3 million volume sale volume of that was 3.9 million and buy volume is like 2.36. So mostly sale volume is still very light. So overall from an equity perspective, it looks just looks very quiet. Now, one note I was actually texting with Newton about this a bit last last night is I'm talking with one of my buddies this week who was an options market maker. And now he kind of runs his own firm. And if there's anything in particular, you want me to talk with him about, let me know. I'm happy to try to collect as much as I can. But the questions if you guys have them, try to like form them out well, right? Because I'm not going to ask like super basic stuff because it's just kind of a waste of their time. I always will do my best to get to the bottom. And if it's something basic that I can answer, I will always try to answer it for you. It's not to answer the question on their behalf. It's just if it's a standard process thing, then obviously I'm not going to take it to them. But if it's something a little more nuanced somewhat like that, happy to bring those. Some of the stuff I'm going to be talking with them about is kind of dissecting some of the recent moves we saw not just in GameStop. They don't specialize in GameStop. Again, they're a market maker. They just know about the broader process. But we can learn a little bit about some of the recent moves. I'm actually very interested to understand some of their hedging activities. So yeah, that's kind of the direction I'm taking it. But happy to serve as a conduit for other folks. That's a big part of what I try to do. So let's take a look at the option Shane. And let's take a look at the total open interest. And we still have even more call OI now, 660,000 calls versus 300,000 puts. This is continuing to build. And this is exceeding that two to one ratio pretty significantly at this point. I still see the same spread across all these different explorations. I see a ton of calls traded today against puts. 89,000 calls versus 13,700 puts. And I see most of them coming in at the offer above. So we're buying those. So yeah, overall, the option chain in GameStop is still again on a relative basis quiet. But it's definitely not silent to any degree. So if we take a look at kind of this week so far, and we get rid of the bids and we'll get rid of the puts. We're now seeing just some further term explorations. We already talked about these. So this is nothing novel. But this is still relatively new for GameStop where we're seeing these longer term positions being built out. Now in the near term, it still looks a little bit quiet as far as I can tell. But as always, if there's anything that's jumping out at you or that you want to take a look at, let me know for the GME live stream this coming Saturday, we're going to go into part three of analyzing worried kiddies old trades, which Newton and I talked a lot about that because he has a lot of ideas about some of the behaviors. And I want to see if we can pick up any of those based on what we've been seeing so far because I definitely am getting a really good feel for the way that Rory and Kitty was thinking about his options trades, building them and then managing them. So we're getting to the point where he's starting to unwind position. So I can learn more about that, which looks way more based on time than value. Normally when we're trading options, we try to pick a point where we think something might go. And I actually don't see that so far from him. I see him primarily managing by time, which is fascinating. So we'll dive further into that. And then for the live stream tomorrow, I'm going to start maybe like some sort of mini series about trading meme stocks with options. This is from a recommendation from one of our viewers. And I think it's a really great idea because there's a lot of options traders or a lot of meme stock traders that start trading meme stocks. They add options and then they get torn up just because a lack of fundamentals. So the goal is to use that as an opportunity to talk a little bit about the specific profit mechanisms, how to think about them a little more appropriately. I think at least to structure ideas that might be more representative of the thesis rather than just getting burned by buying cheap out of the money options that decay away in front of your face. So that's what's coming up. As always, let me know if there's anything we should take a look at. Be an outlier. I'll see you all
