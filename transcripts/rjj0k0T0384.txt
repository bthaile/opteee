0.00s: What's up outliers? I've got three things on the docket for us today. I want to talk about
5.54s: AVGO and kind of the tech sector as a whole because AVGO is reporting earnings right now
11.60s: and it's not going great. Then I want to take a look at a couple market scans to help
17.78s: give some context about the broader market picture that we're currently in. And then
23.12s: I want to take a look at GameStop at the end of the video. I mean, quick preamble. I did
29.04s: a quick stroll through. I didn't see anything like jumping out at me, but there are a couple
34.00s: things that I think are worth highlighting. So I'll spend a little time taking a look
37.52s: at that towards the end. All right. So first things first right now, Broadcom AVGO is in
43.04s: the process of reporting its earnings. We can see that they beat on EPS. They came in at
47.76s: 124 versus 95 cents expected and they're down. They're down 10 points from 152 trading
56.32s: right now at 142. Now it's still unfolding. So there is a chance that this might bid up
62.40s: a little bit, but it's struggling in a couple different areas. So when I was looking through
69.36s: the earnings to get a sense, you can see here it says Broadcom boost AI revenue outlook,
75.76s: but it falls after mixed earnings. So it's kind of talking about the rest of the operation
79.20s: of the company. And I haven't gone through all the way through in detail. So there's going
83.60s: to be tons of better information with respect to the nuances of the qualitative components
89.44s: of their release itself, but from a high level overview as it's unfolding right now, what I can
95.36s: tell you is the market doesn't like it. So I think this is topical because Broadcom is another
102.64s: really large company. And when we look across the broader tech sector right now,
108.40s: it was just starting to grab just anything it can hold on to. So we can see in the cues,
114.32s: it's have these two days side by side consolidating which looks okay.
118.80s: Until you look at the tech sector specifically, and you can see it's had this big, massive drop off,
124.32s: come the third, and it's just holding on for dear life right here. Now from a broader market
129.52s: perspective, what I don't love are the things that I've been highlighting that are showing strength
134.88s: are starting to rotate a little bit. So for example, XLF, big drop down here, don't like that,
140.96s: XLV, big drop down from the high that it posted yesterday, XLU is still hanging in there.
147.52s: It posted a high did close down a little bit lower so I don't love that, but it's still showing
151.68s: highs. XLRE still hanging out near highs, XLP, near highs, XLB continuing that downtrend, XLC,
159.60s: starting to level out a little bit, XLE down to the floor. So we're still seeing this broader
166.16s: capitulation which I continue to point out because if you're trading broad sectors like the S&P 500,
171.28s: it's very tech heavy. Tech right now is not doing a lot to prop up this index, so it's these other,
177.12s: it's the combination of these other sectors that are generally keeping us alive here.
183.84s: As soon as they start falling off a cliff too, then there's really nothing holding this up,
190.08s: which I just don't love. It goes back to this tentative point I continue to highlight.
195.52s: The percentage of S&P 500 stocks above a 50 day moving average is now dropped to 66%.
202.72s: So it's not abysmal yet, but this is not good. I don't like seeing this below 75%
209.36s: for these really aggressive down moves. Sometimes it'll dip below 75%. That's not abnormal.
217.84s: If I zoom this out to a longer term time frame, it'll happen, but you'll see that it also spends
223.52s: massive amounts of time above that 75% when it's in these broader accumulation phases, obviously.
229.20s: Nothing really revolutionary there, but I don't like how steep this is starting. And the reason
234.48s: why I care about this is because again, this is the percentage of stocks within the S&P 500
238.48s: above a 50 day moving average. So if the percentage of stocks above the moving average is contracting,
245.12s: it tells me the breadth underneath the surface is starting to rotate over. Now this again,
250.88s: isn't all doom and gloom. I don't think that the market is necessarily clearly heading lower yet,
255.20s: but I also don't think that it's not. I think that we are still at a very, very tentative time
261.60s: when I look across the markets. We can see that the moving averages, the shorter term are all
265.44s: rotating over on spy. And now we're just about to bump into this 50 day moving average. I don't
270.32s: have the 200 days on here right now. We have that on the main chart, but it just looks rough
277.04s: is the way I look at it. Now the VIX is not confirming a lot of this. So that gives me a little bit
283.68s: of interest that the market isn't necessarily super concerned about this down move, but even down to
289.68s: momentum indicators, they're all starting to flatten out, rotate over. I already have my maximum
294.80s: exposure right now in S&P futures. I intend to not add anything more until we start to stabilize.
301.68s: It doesn't look bad here again. We're still well within striking distance of highs.
306.48s: Term highs here is 565 against where we're at right now 549, but this kind of rounding top
313.60s: just isn't my favorite. So that's the market at large. Now I want to show you two different
318.16s: scans. This scan is looking at the stocks that have options. So this isn't the entire stock
324.88s: universe. These are stocks that have options that are within 5% of a 52 week high. And I just
330.64s: want to show you the number of returns here. There's 1719 that are 5% off 52 week highs. Now if I
337.20s: change this now, 5%, but I'm going to update the script so that we look for 52. He lows.
343.12s: Remember, it was just over 171719 is what you saw before. You see 426 in the same population.
349.36s: So looking across this quickly, it still tells me that there are lots of companies that are doing
355.52s: absolutely fine here. And when I look across the things that are near lows, again, this is
362.80s: filtered by optionable, which is important because this isn't everything in the
366.24s: the universe. This isn't representative of everything. This is just closer to what I would trade.
370.80s: But I see energy and materials and industrials. This makes up a significant bulk of what we see here.
376.00s: Information technology isn't really the bulk of what I'm seeing in here. So it tells me that there
382.08s: are some companies that are obviously falling off and approaching towards lows, but even stuff like
387.84s: Nvidia that has had a bit of a down move. It's clearly not hovering near lows. So now if I change
394.16s: this again, one more time, and I want to filter it again by the sectors so that you can see for the
399.44s: high part of this equation what that looks like. And you'll get a sense of how things are broadly
408.72s: performing. So just give this a seconds run. We'll filter it again by sector. I have a bunch of
416.40s: custom scripts in here like a lot of these are custom. That's why you see it like slowly trickling
420.96s: in because I'm asking it to do actually kind of a lot. And let's take a look. So I see a few
427.84s: in energy, few in industrials, not much. I still see financials really leading this. And again,
432.40s: this is what I've been talking about for a while while the strength. I see information technology.
437.60s: I see two companies within it that have options that are near highs. So it tells me that we're in a
443.04s: bit of a distribution phase for things that dominate fall within tech. So it's just none of this is
451.04s: like massively game changing information, but hopefully it provides a little bit of context on how
456.64s: we can look at the market in a couple different levels and look for confluence of information or
462.56s: look for divergences in information. So now the last thing I want to take a quick look at with you
468.64s: as I promise in the beginning is game stop. Now again, there isn't a whole lot that I wanted to dive
474.64s: into on this. I actually am saving a lot of the material that I want to look at for the game stop
480.48s: live stream, which is scheduled for Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific time. And that one I want to spend
487.20s: quite a bit of time going through roaring kitties, old options positions using on demand to go back
492.80s: in time and like actually look at the markets when he was placing those trades to really help me
497.28s: understand some of the decisions he's making and stuff. Now that part side looking at game stop
503.36s: as it sits today, we continue this sideways trend. It is down trending again from this recent
508.32s: slight peak high here, but again, I see a higher low so far. So this is our low kind of just looking
515.44s: at the small range window here, see a low here. Now I see a higher low being built. So hopefully
520.80s: that's sustained and then kind of turns into a bit of a rally point. But again, we have earnings
524.80s: coming up. So it's always a crapshoot whenever you have earnings involved. Now the main thing I wanted
529.36s: to show you is from the options chain. I still see that two to one ratio calls to puts total. And I
538.24s: see the call side growing a little more aggressively than the put side. Now this still is moderate enough
544.32s: that like I'm not thinking anything massive is happening here. It's a little too early to decide
549.84s: anything like that. But it does tell me that there's still at least a bit of bullish activity going
555.52s: on in here, although we're just not seeing a lot of movement at a game stop. So my game plan remains
560.48s: the same as per usual. I am very eager to see earnings come out. I know that we have some ideas on
566.32s: what it will look like, but I'm eager to see the way that the options markets position before
570.96s: earnings. I'm really eager to see the way that markets move after earnings comes out. I'm eager to
576.88s: see if there's some sort of read into the way that we're going to use the money that game stop has.
583.20s: Again, I've been told a few times by folks to kind of not expect that. So I'm reeling that forward.
588.64s: So that my eagerness doesn't turn into other people's disappointment. But it looks like based on what
594.32s: I've been told it's unlikely that they'll share anything like that. I still hope they do
598.96s: because I want to know. So yeah, there's some of those things coming down the pike, but otherwise
605.28s: relatively quiet in here as far as I am concerned. And the other thing that I do want to highlight
612.48s: though from the options picture itself is that if we take a look specifically at exploration that
618.72s: includes earnings is it's quiet. Yeah, it's three to one ratio calls to puts, but the reason why
625.36s: I'm eager is because I think we need to get through this week. I think we need to see these 100,000
630.48s: and 27,000 roll off and then move into the next front exploration, which will be earnings.
636.40s: Now what I want to know is will the earnings expiration get more spicy than what we see in this
641.92s: non earnings weekly expiration and success? Because that tells me if there's people actually playing
647.52s: the earnings. So I'm going to monitor this 13 step expiration and see if we start expanding above
652.48s: 100,000 pretty quickly because then that tells me that yeah, there's people not only rolling over
657.28s: into the next front exploration, but also trying to play earnings. So I am very interested to see
663.60s: how that goes. The way I'm looking at markets right now is taking very interest premium opportunities
669.36s: as they emerge. I'm tentatively looking to trend follow the indices with futures, but very,
673.84s: very light right now because they are not trending. And I'm looking for directional plays using
678.64s: things like ratio called diagonals and stuff like that because there are a lot of opportunities to
683.04s: find strength. It's just in smaller groupings right now. So it takes a little more research to come
688.40s: across those and build a portfolio. But the one thing I can say is this is not a place where I'm
693.04s: looking to use and deploy a ton of capital because I do not like when the market is hanging out near
698.56s: all time highs and starting to stall. I never like that. That again does not mean that we crash,
704.08s: but it means I don't want a top tick. Start getting long at the very top before we have some sort of
708.24s: pullback because then again, there's an opportunity to cost to that capital. So name of the game,
713.28s: agile, fast on the feet, even though you boys have herniated this. So I'm not really fast at all.
718.08s: Maybe my thumb will be super fast. Something like that. As always, anything you want me to take a look
722.48s: at, let me know, be an outlier, and I'll see you all later.
