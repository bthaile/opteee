0.00s: Well, what's happening? We'll give this a couple of seconds to turn on. And then we are
8.96s: going to dive in. How's everybody doing? Cool. It looks like we are alive. Happy Saturday.
18.94s: What's up to all the outliers to the apes and the outlier apes, whatever combination
25.62s: there of. So I was looking through the broader series here and believe it or not, we've
33.24s: gone through this is our 17th episode. That means for 17 weeks, we've been talking
40.04s: about game stop in different ways and for a pretty significant majority for the recent
47.80s: ones. I actually have to look it up super fast for the recent Jamie live streams to see,
53.26s: what is it? Part eight. So this is part nine of actually looking at the cat's trades.
61.18s: And this should be, I think the finale for this part because we've literally gone through
67.90s: all of his trades now. And we took a look in the last video at some of his more recent
74.58s: positions. And now I think it's time to reflect, to go back through specifically the cat's
82.86s: trading style. And that was the goal for the session tonight is I wanted to poke through
87.70s: it at a high level, kind of reconfirmed some of the things that I thought I saw as we were
91.98s: going through it. And to go through some of the logs that we've built about some of the
96.78s: tendencies. But there's a few really big ticket items that immediately jump out at me
103.54s: that really represent his trading style. And I have to be completely honest with you.
110.54s: It is 100% different than I originally thought because a lot of the people that I spoke to
118.50s: in the beginning really made me think, and this isn't to their fault, I understand why
123.86s: people would think this. But they really made it made me think that there was this really
130.98s: secret grandmaster plan that was figured out. And he essentially was executing pinpoint
139.62s: accurately. And he's obviously crushed it. So let's make sure we emphasize that point
149.30s: specifically because when we first started looking at his very, very, very first trade here
157.02s: posted on Reddit, and I think this is when he was still posting on Wall Street bets.
163.18s: Yeah, the very first thing that he posted here is account was valued at like, well, the
168.94s: Yolo account I should say specifically was valued at $100,000. And he's taken $100,000
174.98s: and turned it into over $200 million. That requires an acknowledgement, a massive acknowledgement.
183.34s: That's more money than all of us will probably have. I mean, I do pretty well. I don't think
191.82s: I'm going to exceed the $200 million mark. Specifically in a trading account, that's
199.98s: not to to cap out what my total footprint could eventually look like in some degree in
206.46s: all asset classes. We'll see about that. But specifically in terms of like what's residing
211.66s: just in a trading account, I feel pretty confident in that summation. And it's primarily
217.46s: because as a trader, I recognize the fact that trading is highly tax disadvantaged.
225.58s: It's not like real estate. And trading has a lot of pros associated with it as far as
231.78s: I'm concerned. One of the biggest pros that come with trading is that it genuinely is
237.50s: a solo endeavor that genuinely can be done from anywhere. There's no planning calls.
244.58s: There's literally no other party that you have to work with in any capacity to make this work
250.98s: and to make a lot of fucking money doing it, right? There are a lot of pros that come from trading.
256.34s: There are also a lot of cons. It's not cheap in terms of commissions overall friction that we
261.78s: face as retail traders. And it's not tax advantaged in any way whatsoever. And that's a big thing
269.22s: because the US government specifically, because I know that there's people on the stream that
273.30s: pop in from all over the place. And we actually have to do our map in a moment. I'm waiting a
278.90s: few minutes to let everybody funnel their funnel their way in. But it's not tax advantaged. And
287.06s: US government absolutely tax advantages pretty heavily real estate in a lot of different ways.
293.62s: Both in terms of the leverage they provide to you in terms of the tax treatment on what you can
298.58s: make. The fact that there's fucking 1031 exchanges, it's incredible. For those that are unfamiliar,
305.38s: 1031 exchanges to put it in trading terms, I'll show you. I'll literally draw it out because
312.42s: a lot of people don't understand this. And it's kind of like a superpower.
319.14s: So let's take a look at a standard margin account here. And I want to look at trading first.
330.18s: So trading, you have your 100K account, whatever it is, then you sling a few trades. You make 10K,
342.66s: which is awesome. And in the course of making that 10K, this has happened by buying and selling
351.62s: within a year. And as you're going through this process, you make your money, come end of year,
360.58s: you owe capital gains because you realized profit here. Now in real estate, it's different.
371.62s: Real estate if I buy a house, hopefully the roof looks a little better than that.
379.22s: Otherwise, I probably wouldn't buy it, to be honest. The windows don't matter so much.
382.58s: The foundation is kind of jacked. But if you buy a house and you buy the house for $100,000,
390.18s: you put your 20% down. So you're actually using 20K. And then you go to sell the house.
396.26s: And when you sell the house, you sell it for 110K, and you still only put in 20K, but you still have
407.22s: rights to that 10K profit. But there's a beautiful thing that happens here. There's called a 1031
414.02s: exchange. And in a 1031 exchange, I can take the proceeds from this. I could essentially directly move
424.50s: it. You can't touch it, meaning it can't go to a personal account and then back out.
428.26s: You have to obviously talk to talk to a tax professional. I am a talking idiot and don't know what I'm
434.42s: talking about. Always remember that. But you can't touch it. This money can then be put into another
443.46s: house. This one has a worse looking foundation, but a better looking roof. And as long as you
450.10s: haven't touched this money, this is not a taxable event. There's no tax here. So you made the same 10K.
458.58s: However, you've not paid taxes on it. You roll it into another asset. And then you continue on
465.38s: in this manner. So 1031 exchanges are kind of like magic from a tax perspective at least. There's
471.62s: obviously more to it. This is a broken down version of that. So bringing all of this back
478.34s: to the cat, which is what this session is about. The fact that this dude has taken $200 million
486.82s: and put it into a trading vehicle that is exceedingly tax disadvantaged is incredible.
495.54s: And it goes back to the same exact thing that I've been talking about that I cannot help but
502.18s: continue to be purely fascinated by the fact that this dude does shit that financially doesn't
510.98s: make sense. It doesn't make sense. But it still works like a mother. So you can't knock it. But
522.26s: but from a pragmatic perspective, it's kind of crazy to see somebody with that kind of money
530.50s: doing this sort of thing. Cedric says maybe it makes sense for him. You're misinterpreting my point.
536.98s: There's an objective reality about the about the financial implications of using a margin account.
547.62s: That's all I'm saying. And obviously it works for him. There's literally no debate about that.
553.46s: The dude's made $200 million objectively. It has worked and then some. But in terms of this being a
562.42s: when I say, when I say like it doesn't make sense, I mean in the context of trying to minimize a
570.98s: tax footprint while doing this, right? This is getting this is taxes to the face. And it goes back
579.14s: to the broader theme that we've talked about before that you can tell repeatedly that this is not
585.14s: done to over streamline stuff. And that's one of the main things that I've come across as I've
591.46s: been analyzing all of these traits that this dude has made is that his motivation is very different.
600.50s: And we've talked about this. And I want to take a step back and actually talk about that as well
606.42s: for a moment because when I'm talking about the way that this that this dude has traded and the
614.58s: amount of time that we've spent analyzing his approach is that it really is very unique. It's very
622.42s: specific to him. But one of the overarching themes that is very clear to me is that this is not
631.06s: purely motivated by money. And again, I think we've already known that. But as you guys know, as we've
638.58s: gone through a lot of this series, the goal is not to take something that we've heard and just
645.70s: accept it and then apply that as truth going forward. Right? The whole point of me doing this
651.30s: is a process that I do with a lot of things that I'm interested in, which is lay my own eyes on
657.14s: the things so that I can see it for myself. And I think it's really, really important for me to
663.94s: see it for myself because then it helps me pick up on different little things along the way,
668.34s: which we're going to talk about. But the fact that this is done this way, this is not purely
678.26s: motivated by money. It's not. I can see that it's not. And it begs the question, what is the motivation?
686.50s: And there's lots of conjecture out there. I still have my Tim FOIL hat ready to go as soon as we
690.90s: need it because I don't know. I don't know what the motivation is. Some people think it's him trying
697.22s: to just play the game. Some people think it's him that's trying to stick it to the system and
705.38s: play with the hedge funds and all these different kinds of things, which I have to who knows,
711.06s: who knows. But as I look across a lot of what he's done, I honestly think a lot of this is a
718.74s: really smart dude, an incredibly smart dude that knows exactly what he's doing that is
725.38s: fucking around to a pretty big degree. I think he likes trolling a lot. And I think that the
733.46s: nomenclature right from the jump for this whole thing is completely transparent, right? Like it's
740.66s: started with a yolo account. So Josh says, what's the motivation to find the motivation? Because
750.26s: it's fucking interesting. That's why it is fucking interesting. It's kind of like, and I've said this
758.42s: before. Josh says he lives rent free in my head. Yes. Of course he does. I enjoy looking at his stuff.
766.18s: I've talked about this a million times. I'm fascinated by this. The reason why I'm so fascinated
771.78s: by this is because I've spent a lot of time in markets. I've come across exactly zero instances
782.34s: of this kind of behavior from a retail trader. So like in a pure sense, this is not only an outlier,
790.82s: which is my entire fucking brand is this kind of stuff. But more important, that's how my brain works.
797.78s: But more importantly than that, I'm literally looking at an anomaly.
803.78s: Like I'm looking at, it's like the matrix when like that little kid holds up the spoon and they're
810.18s: like, well, what if the spoon isn't a spoon or whatever and he like fucking bent over or whatever.
816.74s: So it's absolutely an incredible thing to see. So he doesn't live rent free in my head.
826.02s: And I've told you guys this before as well. He doesn't live rent free that like, I'm trying to
830.50s: crack the code of what he's doing so I can do it. Like I've said that a million times. I honestly would
835.38s: never trade like him. I know that I wouldn't. I honestly don't have any interest in trading like him.
841.14s: But I can fully appreciate and enjoy looking at the way that he's trading. So the reason why he
849.46s: lives in my head is because I'm interested in it. Like a lot of stuff, right? Astrophysics lives
854.66s: rent free in my head. I'm fascinated by it. I have a fucking telescope over here that I paid a lot
861.22s: of money for so that I could just look at shit in the sky that my brain can't really comprehend
866.50s: because I'm interested in it. So this is absolutely absolutely something that I enjoy looking at
874.82s: because how could I not? It's like if if you play basketball when Mugsie Mugsie Bose. Mugsie Bose
885.62s: was really interesting and he got a lot of attention for some time because he was an anomaly
892.98s: in professional basketball. He had a style based on his size which was an outlier to the negative
901.06s: to the downside. Not like a giant dude and he completely created a style around himself.
910.66s: So he also was an anomaly that anybody that was a fan of basketball knew about him.
916.98s: And it's for that reason. So yeah, I love looking at this stuff. You guys know, I just said at the
922.98s: beginning of this, spent the last 17 weeks straight on Saturday night looking at this stuff
929.14s: because it interests me that much. That's why I'm here. So I love it. I think the ability to look
936.26s: at something like this and to just understand what's going on here while try to understand is
942.66s: very, very fun, very, very fun. It has been a it's been a long ride so far. So
951.86s: just as people collect things, some people collect money. Oh, are you saying that like that's what
960.26s: he's trying to do here is just collect more coupons? Because again, if so, I don't I actually don't
965.86s: think that's the case. He could have made a lot more money with his money at this point if he
970.10s: moved out of stocks. That's just an objective reality. Once you have the kind of scale that he does,
980.10s: if his goal was just to make more gold coins, he absolutely would have moved out into a couple other
987.70s: kind of asset classes that are highly restrictive by the amount of money that you have which makes it
992.18s: far less competitive to a degree way more opportunities to a degree and way more structurally
999.62s: advantage in terms of leverage provided. So it's not. I don't think this is an expression at all
1006.82s: of him just trying to build more gold coins. So, saidrick says, so what asset classes five extra
1015.46s: money in three years? Honestly, a bunch of stuff can. It's but the thing that we have to remember
1023.94s: is that there are economies of scale that we have to be aware of. So let's let's draw it out.
1033.46s: I'll show you what I mean. So if you have $10,
1040.42s: your ability to double this money into $20 is not well suited to buying $10 of stock.
1051.22s: Something that makes more sense for you to be able to double your $10 is you go do Uber
1058.10s: for two rides and you get $10 in total tips. You've doubled your money. This is a pretty
1065.54s: efficient way to do it. Okay, so now let's scale this $100,000. What's a good place to double
1074.50s: $100,000? The stock market. The stock market is literally perfect for that kind of thing.
1080.74s: The reason why the stock market is perfect for this kind of thing is because this amount of money
1087.94s: cannot get you a ton of leverage in the kind of real estate that offers the ability to double
1095.78s: and triple and quadruple. So $100,000 in residential real estate, you still can get into a decent
1104.42s: size house, but residential real estate moves very different than commercial. So you are way too
1110.26s: small right now to fuck with commercial real estate with this kind of money stock market.
1115.30s: Literally perfect perfect place to grow your money. Now as you start getting into the tens
1122.42s: of millions of dollars, your scale is now different. The places that you can play are now different
1131.86s: and there are different asset classes that can start to make a lot of sense for your money.
1137.54s: So for example, if you get into angel investing, for example, you can absolutely double your money
1147.06s: relatively quickly in angel investing. What's the drawback? Ones of fucking risk. Buckets of risk,
1155.94s: droves of risk, but really effective place if you can find the right kinds of deals. I've been in
1163.86s: angel investing for a long time now. So there's a ton of potential there.
1169.06s: Commercial real estate is another fantastic place depending on the asset class and depending on
1174.90s: what you're doing. If you're doing value add to properties or if you're scooping up properties
1180.18s: that have been really beaten down, again, it's another really great place to double your money and
1185.38s: then some because you gain access to way more leverage than you can in the stock market. Now
1191.22s: that's just going back to other ways to go about growing your money. That's not to suggest
1197.22s: at all that you can't continue building your money in the stock market. Of course you can.
1202.58s: Just saying that there's other places that actually start to make a little bit more sense in terms
1206.90s: of the leverage provided against the risk that you're taking because as you're getting into different
1210.98s: kind of, if you're as you're getting into different kind of asset classes, for example,
1217.62s: looking at something like $10 million, right? If you wanted to double your $10 million
1223.70s: by trading a single stock, GameStop, for example, you have to use the $10 million. You have to put
1230.82s: all of the $10 million into the stock so that then it can do what you want it to do to try to
1236.82s: double your money, right? You have to use your money to do that. With real estate, you can take
1241.94s: that $10 million and you can break it out into a bunch of different down payments for things
1247.62s: so that instead of having all $10 million in one asset class hoping that that one doubles,
1252.02s: you can have it into multiple deals that still provide you full access to the potential gains
1257.62s: because of the leverage provided by real estate. The completely different thing.
1261.70s: All of that not to get super far off topic, but that's to answer. It looks like Cedric's question.
1267.46s: Is that there are a lot of things that you can put capital into. The main thing to keep in mind
1273.30s: is that it changes as your resources scale. That's the main point. What you're able to do is going
1282.18s: to change massively by resource scaling. It looks like this needs to be squished down a little
1290.50s: bit so you guys can see the edge of this. I was wondering why that was so far over.
1297.38s: Sweet. Rowan Titty. Hey, yo, Rowan Titty, what up? Good to see you. Shout out to Rowan Titty is,
1306.34s: you know, everybody that's one of the one of the greatest names that we have here.
1312.50s: That Lauren says, what if your account is three and a half K and three Ks in GME?
1317.14s: Oh, I see Rowan Titty said, gas, not a full porter blast for me. Yeah. So, Lauren, it looks like
1322.26s: Rowan Titty is now disappointed in you because it looks like you have more money that could be in a
1327.38s: stock. That's not. You're kind of reminded me of Warren Buffett by sitting on all of that cash.
1336.18s: Right. I think Warren Buffett just offloaded more of his Apple stake and I don't even know how much
1343.14s: cash that dude's sitting on at this point. It's like a comical, comical amount. But because even
1349.46s: that's another great example. Warren Buffett is a great example of like on the institutional side,
1354.18s: somebody that's been able to make a lot of money through markets, but he's not doing it through
1359.38s: trading. He's literally buying, he's buying the entire company and he's running companies. He's
1365.86s: running businesses. That's what Berkshire Hathaway does. So it'll hold stock for sure. Right. It
1372.82s: absolutely gains exposure to stock. But a lot of the holdings that he has are things that
1378.58s: essentially they're going to input and work with management and actually run a business.
1384.74s: So that's just a, I think a fascinating point about him.
1390.42s: That's what he says. Kitty needs to buy this shit. Damn it. Yeah. That's, and that's a really
1394.82s: interesting thing that we're going to have to talk about. So first, let's kind of summarize some
1399.62s: of the main things that we saw going through his trades. And I would love to hear from you as well
1404.66s: because a lot of you have been following along this whole series as we've gone. So a lot of you
1411.38s: have seen everything that I've seen. So as you think about this stuff that we've looked at so far,
1421.62s: what do we think? What do you think about the trading approach, the trading style?
1426.18s: There's a bunch of stuff that jumps out to me, which obviously I will happily,
1430.90s: I'll happily explain my thoughts, but I don't want to offer them before you guys have a chance
1435.94s: to share yours because I don't want to add any bias to the way that you're thinking. But
1442.50s: I think that there's a ton, literally a ton of really, really, really interesting things to pull
1449.38s: out from his approach. So I'll give you a couple of seconds there. Vladimir says, Bezos sold another
1456.58s: three billion of Amazon stock on Friday. His girlfriend must be fun. Listen, man, if you're out there
1461.54s: trying to build new mega yachts, it doesn't happen, right? It doesn't happen overnight. You're going
1467.94s: to have to use a couple dollars for it. So yeah, he seems to say, I don't think he's done with GME.
1473.46s: I don't think so either. I see, I see nothing that leads me to believe that he's moved away from
1479.38s: GameStop. I don't see that at all. One of the things I'm really curious about from his perspective is
1485.38s: like genuinely, how does he view his role in the community? Because there is absolutely a 100%
1495.06s: reality to the fact that tons of people idolize him, which is okay, right? There's nothing inherently
1502.42s: wrong with that. But the thing that makes me a little more interested is that tons of people
1509.86s: literally try to follow what he's doing and he knows this. I don't know how he thinks about that.
1518.34s: And I've spent actually quite a long time thinking about that. Roryntady says he literally
1522.98s: thinks he's Batman. I think he's sort of Batman. The reason why I say I think he's sort of Batman
1531.54s: is again, Batman has a little bit of a direct impact. And if I were to look at the vast majority
1541.78s: of people who trade GameStop trying to copy what he does, I would wager the majority of them
1548.58s: have lost money. Like that, that would be my genuine guess. I don't want it to be true.
1554.34s: But that would absolutely be my guess. So the reason why I say that is because if Roryntady
1559.94s: was really trying to be Batman and genuinely trying to help and save people from evil or whatever
1567.30s: evil in this case, just being the stock market or helping them make money, whatever the case is,
1572.02s: I'm not actually sure that I see that happening here. I don't. And the reason why I say that is
1579.62s: because if he was trying to do that, Roryntady says you clearly haven't watched his meme movie,
1588.26s: let's take a look at it. I think I have seen it. I'm pretty sure because I know that he has
1593.78s: references to Batman, Joker and stuff like that. I'm just talking in terms of like his actions,
1599.46s: like what he's functionally doing. And he's a smart dude. He's a really smart dude. And this goes
1606.18s: back to my prior point that I know that he knows that he has a direct impact on how GameStop moves
1616.42s: in the short term. He has a direct impact on investor and trader behavior as it relates to GameStop.
1625.46s: I know that he knows that. So then the question becomes what does he think about that? And how does
1632.34s: he handle that kind of responsibility? Because I don't know. I don't know how he thinks about that.
1641.70s: Even with the stuff that I do in such a small scale, I still can test with like what's my
1649.14s: responsibility, like as it pertains to what other people do. Because even as I talk about different
1657.38s: things, that's one of the reasons why I'm so careful about the stuff that I talk about when I
1662.50s: talk about it, how I talk about it is because no matter what I do, people try to copy what I do.
1669.54s: And then I'll get emails from people saying like, oh yeah, what do you think I should do? I put
1673.22s: on this too. And I like the first thing I think is like you shouldn't have fucking done anything
1677.86s: based on what you think I'm doing. But anyways, all that aside, he knows all this stuff.
1684.18s: And I'm curious what I'm curious what he thinks about it. And I'm curious what level of responsibility
1691.14s: he takes because there's a big reality here that again, it's just reality. Let me grab
1701.46s: Reddit. And let me, oh no, let me just go to his thing really quick. Okay.
1712.02s: So, genuine question, genuine question from you guys. I'd rather be skiing. Hey, yo, I'd rather be
1722.10s: skiing. Just hooked 10 people up with a trading, outlier trading membership. So thank you, I'd
1728.10s: rather be skiing for supporting the channel, supporting the work and you're everybody that got
1732.98s: hooked up. Make sure that you say thank you to him. But one of the things that I look at here,
1742.02s: is genuinely, I'm gonna put a poll here.
1749.94s: All right. So the question and the poll here is, did you genuinely think RK was gonna buy
1774.50s: into Chewie within 15 days of this yellow update? My answer is no. If I could vote mine 100%
1781.94s: would be no. There is nothing, nothing about this that I would have thought that about at all.
1793.78s: Vladimir Putin says he publishes many disclaimers on his YouTube channel. I think he's doing a harm.
1798.82s: Sort of. I don't think he's doing it any harm either because I absolutely believe in general.
1810.18s: I absolutely believe that he should be able to do whatever he wants and then people are responsible
1814.98s: for themselves. That's what I believe. There's a reality. There's a reality that there's a lot of
1821.30s: really young people or just people who don't think clearly or things like that that aren't as
1827.22s: rational and aren't as capable of making good decisions. And there's a reality that people that
1835.54s: ascend to different kind of social statuses that they pick up as they gain social status.
1842.58s: There's a reality to their influence. So I disclaimers or not, I agree with you. He has disclaimers.
1849.70s: Right. For sure. But the disclaimers don't change the behavior. People are so used to the disclaimers.
1859.22s: So.
1861.46s: Roryntiddy says, why do you think you spend so much time teaching people like us? Oh, I think he loves
1865.78s: the community. I think he loves everybody. I think he loves the stock. I think he loves doing this.
1871.62s: I absolutely again, I don't think he's a bad actor literally at all. I'm just saying that
1877.22s: going back to the Batman concept, if he was really trying to be quote unquote Batman and like
1884.34s: save and help people, you have to work with what you have and what the community is.
1891.38s: And the fact that essentially the overwhelming majority of people
1896.74s: thought the same thing I did where the last time we saw an update, there's a big move out of
1902.10s: GameStop. There's a reality. If, for example, he got out of GameStop. I don't know that he got out of
1911.06s: GameStop with that's totally up for debate. Nobody knows. And that's another point that actually
1916.34s: bolsters this point. The fact that nobody knows is telling that he's doing stuff not just for trying
1926.02s: to help people, but he's also playing his own game with his own rules to achieve his own ends.
1933.38s: So the reason I bring that back is because as people will follow him into something like GameStop.
1941.94s: And then if, let's just say if hypothetical if don't know either way, if he did sell his stock
1949.38s: to then get into Chewy because he needed the $200 million or so to get into Chewy.
1955.22s: If we go back to the stock on 13 June, we got to go back a little further.
1971.06s: If he unwound somewhere in here that pushes the price of the stock down, at this point the stock
1978.98s: was still light enough that him unloading a large amount of shares would undoubtedly move the stock
1987.78s: near term. So I think in general, he has a tremendous amount of influence and I'm just curious
1998.58s: how he thinks about it. I don't think he should do anything different. I think every person should
2003.38s: be responsible for what they do. That's what I think. So going back though to his broader motivations,
2016.58s: that's the part that I can't fully unravel. I'm very interested because it's just a mystery
2024.10s: as it sits now because I can see elements of all these different things coalescing.
2028.74s: But there's definitely not some sort of like clear output that I can get my arms around right
2035.14s: now. It's just not there. It's literally and that's going back to the original question I got from
2041.22s: somebody earlier of, you know, why do I focus on this so much? Because I'm literally watching a
2050.10s: fucking anomaly and I am fascinated by it. Absolutely fascinated by it.
2057.30s: Chicken nugget says like his livestream, GME was halted on and off multiple times during a stream,
2061.70s: his silence creates more power behind the words. Yeah. Well, and this goes back to another thing
2068.50s: that we've talked about with respect to just communication in general because one of the things
2073.78s: that I've talked about is that like if he genuinely was trying to communicate via memes and stuff
2080.26s: like that, a lot of what he would be doing wouldn't be as cryptic as it sits because again,
2087.94s: like the messages are clear as mud. Some of them, I think the ones that he really wants to connect
2094.42s: to people are very clear clear as day. I think it's almost difficult to mistake it for something else.
2100.34s: We can take a look at like and I talked about this very, very early on when we saw all the movement
2107.54s: happening with Chewie. The very once we understood this to be Chewie, which a lot of people guessed early
2121.14s: on nobody really knew, but that was the guess. And the first thing that I picked up on that I told
2128.42s: you guys about is that there's just green eyes. I know that there's like the look left look right
2133.62s: as part of the Kansas City City shuffle. So I'm sure that's baked into this, but I didn't read into
2138.42s: that part at all. I just think that this is him playing games because he likes Ryan Cohen and he's
2147.14s: in here for the Lowles. But one thing I think unequivocally the case is this here is once we
2157.38s: understood this is Chewie. It's clear as day, right? Dog, green eyes, buy. As soon as this came out
2164.66s: on the 6th of September, I made a video about it and I immediately took this to believe him is selling.
2173.62s: Could it mean something else? Could. I am pretty fucking confident that this was a clear message
2183.30s: designed to be clear because he was trying to actually communicate something very specific and he
2189.46s: wanted people to understand what it meant. This is a really clear communication in my opinion. He's
2195.54s: still doing his game. He's still playing it via memes. But this is much more clear than people that
2203.30s: are trying to interpret, for example, the the list of emojis. That's clear as mud. I mean, it's clear
2212.98s: as mud. That's not to say that there's no meaning behind some or all of them or whatever. But if
2218.18s: there is, nobody fucking knows it. So then it's not really communication. If nobody understands
2224.66s: the message, that's just cryptic messaging. But nobody gets it because I've seen nobody nail
2233.30s: what those emojis mean. It's everybody just guessing, right? Fully so because nobody fucking knows.
2239.78s: So that's one of the things I can pick up as I spend time looking at him is that when he wants to
2245.70s: be understood, he makes it so. When he wants to be less understood, he makes it so. And I think that's
2254.50s: exactly I think that's exactly the the levels of communication that he uses. Again, he's fucking smart.
2262.10s: He literally knows all of this. Now I'm not saying anything at all that's novel. He knows all of
2268.26s: this. He's a smart, smart dude. That Lauren says the amount of holds during his live stream is wild.
2278.42s: Yeah, because the market during that live stream, again, the market acknowledges the fact that if he
2287.54s: said anything pertaining to GameStop during that period, it would go wild because the market
2298.02s: acknowledges and knows that he can and does influence the price. So if you think about it from
2306.90s: a institutional perspective, I'd rather be speaking since he was proving he's not the one controlling
2313.70s: the stock price that the system accuses him for. No, it's that's not the case at all because he
2318.18s: does control the stock price, but he doesn't that people confuse these things massively. Just because
2324.66s: he can influence the stock price doesn't mean to your point that he controls it. I don't think anybody
2329.46s: thinks that he controls where GameStop goes. Nobody thinks that. But most people acknowledge the fact
2337.30s: that he absolutely does influence price. And like most individual actors, just like what's that
2344.58s: research firm that does? What the fuck is it that they do the not citrone research that's one of
2354.02s: them, Hindenburg, Hindenburg research. They also influence price, citrone influences price.
2361.46s: They know this, right? That's exactly why citrone was doing what they were doing because they
2366.82s: knew they influenced price and they could play games around it. So all I'm saying is that there's
2372.58s: a difference between influencing price, moving price temporarily. So like for example,
2378.90s: during that GameStop live stream, if he had said something like, I don't like to I don't like
2386.18s: to stock anymore. I'm getting out. What do you think would have happened? This stock would have
2393.30s: fucking cratered. It would have absolutely cratered if that happened again, hypothetical, but if it did,
2400.82s: it would have cratered. He knows that the market also knows that. So while he's on the live stream,
2408.74s: the reason why the stock is flying all over the place is because there's so much volatility
2416.58s: around him speaking because nobody knows what he's going to say. It's a live stream. Nobody knows
2424.02s: what the reaction is going to be. So if you look at the volatility during that live stream, it was
2430.42s: astronomical as it should be because things he say can and do influence the short term price
2438.10s: movement of the stock. And he's a really big portfolio during the live stream during the live
2443.14s: market. There's a reason why earnings are after hours to decrease that kind of volatility. If
2449.70s: earnings were during hours, it would be just like that. It would be just like that for the vast
2454.50s: majority of them. So it was essentially a live earnings event, but the market was open. And it's
2462.18s: what the dude that came on to the stream, looking like he would, I got to pull that up. That is,
2470.58s: I think that's one of the times when I realized I was in love with this guy because the way that he
2482.74s: started that live stream was like Epic doesn't even encapsulate it. Epic falls short. I don't know
2493.22s: what's bigger than Epic, but whatever is bigger than Epic is what it was. I don't know what's
2501.22s: bigger than Epic, but whatever that is is what this was in my opinion. I don't legendary. Thank you.
2511.14s: Yeah, legendary. I think legendary is the part. Thank you guys. I was at a loss for words. I think
2517.38s: legendary is exactly what this was because the fact that he started the stream like this.
2541.30s: This. And as he's doing this, as he's doing this, the fucking news stations are streaming him.
2558.58s: So there's these people in fucking suits and ties and like professional people on professional
2570.66s: news sites that are streaming this. It was so epic. I just knew that this dude is fucking
2583.14s: incredible. Um, chicken nugget says, wasn't he like 20 minutes late too? I think he did that once
2588.42s: he realized that the news stations were following him because I don't think that he would have been
2592.74s: unnecessarily 20 minutes late to for all of his people. Like I think that he saw the news stations
2602.66s: started like rolling his stuff. And I literally just think it was to fucking the news station.
2608.42s: That's actually another great question for his other live streams. Was he on time like when he
2615.14s: was live streaming for you guys or was he was he late to those? Because my sense is that he would
2623.94s: be generally on time, but I can also see like the Conor McGregor effect where some people loved
2629.94s: Conor McGregor so much that they couldn't care less that he was late. It's like the exact opposite
2635.78s: of my brain. If somebody's not punctual, I don't fuck with that. Like punctuality is very important
2641.30s: to me, but I understand a lot of people are more laissez faire about that on time and stoked to start
2647.78s: if I recall correctly. Yeah, that would be my guess is that when he was doing streams for the
2653.62s: community, my guess is that he probably would have been on time. And yeah, I think here he absolutely
2663.06s: saw that they were streaming his stream. And the opportunity to just fuck around with them
2671.78s: and do this. Oh, God, I actually want to see if I can find a video of like CMBC. Was that one of
2678.98s: the groups that streamed him? I just want to like, I want to see what they talked about.
2685.30s: CMBC, roaring kitty livestream.
2699.38s: Look at these two results. Look at these first two results. Look at this guy.
2706.90s: Oh, my God. This is epic. That's so good.
2723.94s: It's so good. Oh, they have them talking and stuff. Well, they probably would edit out the
2730.34s: part that they were like sitting there like fucking idiots waiting for him. God, that's so funny.
2736.10s: Those so fucking funny. So fucking funny. But yeah, anyways, the reason why the stock was flying
2746.10s: around like that is because Roenton is just playing the audio. I don't think we can. The intro to
2753.38s: this one or on one of these, I think I can only do like 10 seconds because then YouTube turns me off.
2760.98s: But which ones we can try? Play the audio with which one this one or this one?
2774.10s: I mean, I'll 100% risk it.
2780.66s: News coverage. You can on news. No, you can't. So the thing about fair use is to talk about
2788.90s: that for a second is that I can argue the point after the live streams over for them to release it.
2797.46s: Well, what they do is during the live streams we've done this before, they literally they cut off
2802.66s: the live stream and then they don't let me reconnect. So it kills the live stream and then I can
2808.98s: appeal it and I could say no, this was fair use. We were talking about it in a transformative
2813.54s: manner. Like you can absolutely argue it, but that it kills the live stream. So I'm still, again,
2821.38s: we get like 10 seconds that I know we can absolutely run it for like 10 seconds. So if you let me know
2827.22s: which one I'm happy to let it run for a few seconds again, I'll risk it for this because it's hilarious.
2833.22s: But I just don't know which one is the right one because they got two different dudes covering
2836.90s: two different sections or the this one. Okay. And is this the beginning of it?
2848.58s: All right, here we go.
2861.38s: With breaking news because the live stream has finally started, you can see that right there.
2866.34s: About 28 or so minutes late, but nonetheless, it is underway. And we'll see exactly what's going to
2873.94s: going to happen there. And your left still standing by will give you updates when they happen.
2879.62s: Judge for yourself, what's going on on your screen?
2881.86s: Judge for yourself, what's going on on your screen? You could tell that this dude is so disenfranchised
2897.22s: about this. You could tell that he's sitting here thinking like what the fuck? Here I am in a
2904.18s: fucking suit and tie. He's been working for 50 years straight. He's been sucking dick for all the
2911.06s: people at the place so that he could get his spot on the desk. He has to bow down to whoever's
2916.50s: on the teleprompter to make sure that they put the right shit on. And meanwhile, he's looking at this
2921.54s: dude who starts his stream 28 minutes late. The fact that he said 28 minutes late, right? It just
2928.74s: tells you, you can tell him his best off about that. And the fact that he's looking at a stream with
2934.82s: the dude that's dressed up like this that has more money than he will ever have. That's got to be
2943.22s: infuriating. You got to, oh, it's got to be so maddening. You're like, I have to do news on this guy
2954.74s: that he has band-aids on his shirt. They're literally band-aids on the fucking t-shirt.
2965.46s: Oh, God. What did I actually didn't remember that Andrew left was part of this? What did
2974.18s: is there a thing? Is Andrew left in there? Because I want to take a look at that.
2984.26s: We had a switch to stand in. Man, that's. Andrew left goes up. Citroën was manipulating. But did
3003.94s: he talk? I was curious if they, if Andrew left said anything during this.
3009.38s: Oh, man. This is so funny. Roentit, he says, yeah, you've seen that it got run over on Jimmy
3018.26s: shorts, closes positions. Then got back in and got ran over again. That sounds so, so appropriate.
3024.10s: What is the latest with that, dude? He kind of fell off the ether. Didn't he? Andrew left
3028.82s: up the, here it is.
3041.14s: That is a rainman. He entered a plea of not guilty trial set for 30 set. Oh, so trials going on right now?
3048.50s: Now,
3054.50s: off-win says his trial was delayed a year. Where does it, when did that happen?
3063.30s: This looks like the latest, no? This is from 11 September.
3068.10s: This one's from four October. I see it here. So from 5 September. I see it here.
3086.10s: Okay. So this is from 5 September. This one's from four October. Let's look at this. Let's look
3093.62s: at these in order. So this one from 5 September. So this is what like a month ago.
3100.42s: Will face trial in September 25 over allegations committing fraud.
3108.58s: Federal judges, court document Wednesday, slated later this month. Yeah, okay.
3114.90s: Also, what's for dinner tonight? You guys think in some Mexican food, eh?
3123.94s: It feels like Mexican food kind of night.
3136.34s: And then this looks pokeball. I don't know about no pokeball. I don't really get down with those.
3142.90s: I have no problem with raw fish per se. Like sushi is fine, but I don't go out of my way to
3151.54s: get raw fish. I think if it's there and across my path, I will eat it, but I'm not going to
3161.38s: purposely go searching for raw fish. But okay, so this says not guilty.
3170.74s: Okay. And this has asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit by the SEC.
3184.90s: Fails to state a claim because it neither alleges a cognizable theory of fraud nor alleged sufficient
3191.46s: facts to support the theory alleged. I thought it was.
3200.26s: So, okay, so it still looks like it doesn't look like there is a plea deal that I see yet.
3212.90s: This looks like it's still slated for 30 SAP. Left to it pleaded not guilty. Far more than a decade.
3221.38s: Problem in court. Yeah, so same overall, same language, but it looks like no, no change there as far
3226.90s: as I can see. God, that's so good. What an epic, what an epic entry.
3235.78s: So,
3239.22s: Royntady says that's his lawyer's Hail Mary argument. He's not going to win. We don't know.
3244.66s: Here's the problem is that there are absolutely instances where what I would consider to be like
3251.94s: pretty slimy people who have pretty clearly done some pretty shitty things have gotten off the hook.
3257.94s: And we saw one of those examples with like pretty damn clear evidence as far as like a normal
3264.10s: person would look at of a pump and dump and manipulation. And most of them got off. The only person
3270.42s: that didn't got off was the one that took the plea deal in the beginning because he thought that
3274.90s: they were fucked because he knew that they did it. So, yeah, it's an unfortunate reality.
3284.34s: It's one of the good things and the bad things simultaneously about the US legal system
3289.62s: is that there's in general, it's not perfect. Nothing is perfect. Definitely has plenty of gaps.
3295.70s: But in general, it gives a lot of benefit of the doubt to the person that's going through the process.
3303.62s: So, yeah, there is a reality that if there's an issue with the way that they collected their
3311.22s: evidence presented it, how's documents, there's a lot of things that have to be done correctly
3316.66s: for it to get successfully all the way through.
3322.02s: Which again, in the case of somebody left, I couldn't possibly, that's one of those ones where I
3327.78s: think like, yeah, do process. If only we could do do process by vote.
3335.54s: Maybe we need to get back to just being able to stone people in a town square, something if
3344.98s: you slightly don't like them. The problem with that is the sale on which trials then become a thing
3351.38s: where masses start burning people at the stake because somebody has a warrant on their nose or
3357.46s: something unfortunate like that. So, you know, you also, you kind of can't trust people either.
3362.50s: That's the tricky part about this whole thing. So,
3367.78s: Roaring Titty says either way, Keith trapped left on his livestream. How did he trap them?
3373.86s: Again, I'm very confused by people thinking that anybody thought that like this guy was
3379.14s: actively manipulating the stock price. I don't know. What's the origin for that argument? I don't
3384.66s: understand it. Because I, yeah, could you help me understand that?
3393.38s: I don't really, I don't get it.
3401.06s: I'd rather be skin says who left. No, I just mean, because I've heard a couple people in the chat
3405.86s: so far say that like the reason why the cat did this was to like prove he wasn't manipulating the
3415.38s: stock price. But I'm just curious like prove to who because who thought that? And where,
3420.66s: where do we think that somebody thought that? So, I see like I don't see any connection there.
3427.06s: What's whoever I don't understand it. Willy says it's a fine line to crawl market manipulation.
3433.54s: Sort of. I mean, market manipulation is a pretty clear definition. And like that's even
3440.50s: why again, that's why there are cases where people kind of clearly are and they're still not guilty
3447.38s: of it. Because it's not easy to prove. It's the media sit at the left saying that not very
3457.94s: of a lot of people. But who do you guys have any? I'd rather be skinned. Do you have any like
3462.74s: news articles or do you have any? Do you have anything I can read that talks about Citadel or
3472.66s: the media, whoever the media is in this context that are saying that he's manipulating the price.
3478.74s: I would, I would, I would, I'd really like to read that.
3488.66s: I'd rather be seen says they keep trying to investigate him for market manipulation,
3492.58s: Kramer on that committee to again, you have to be so, we have to be clear, right? They
3499.22s: is very specific. And they in the latest one that came out was actually an individual person
3506.82s: that was just trying to get in his pockets. And if you recall, they rescinded the case,
3512.50s: they what dropped it on Friday and they rescinded it on like Sunday.
3517.14s: So, but that wasn't like they being large institutions or Citadel or market makers or whoever.
3524.74s: That was a group of people that were going to try to get into his pockets because their pieces
3529.54s: are shit. People suck that way. People are really shitty that way. Okay, got it.
3536.18s: H says search on Google and the first few articles have literally exactly what you're looking for.
3540.90s: Perfect. Thank you. So for the Google search, what am I doing? I'm doing H. Do you have any like
3549.86s: recommended search term? Citrone was on CNBC when Kitty went live and CNBC was live streamers
3558.58s: live stream. That's hilarious. Yeah. H, what should I look for?
3567.06s: Roryne Kitty Ryan, boy, boy Citrone, Ryan, boy Citrone, got it. Okay, so I see the
3591.46s: charges against him. Is this the dude that? No, I'm asking. So I'd rather be skiing up above.
3602.58s: It said that it's the media in Citadel slash left saying that that being that roaring Kitty
3612.42s: is manipulating the price of GME. So I'm trying to see where that where that comes from.
3621.86s: Like what whether it was a news clip that somebody saw it. Because again, one of the things I see
3627.94s: people in the community do in general. And it's just it's something that it doesn't work well with
3635.38s: my brain is like people will hear things and then they'll they'll go through those things,
3642.74s: right? They'll just keep saying it. But without some sort of source stock, I just want to see the source
3647.54s: stock. Okay, cool. Roryne Kitty says they set it on the CNBC clip we were watching. You mean like
3656.90s: the longer clip? Because what we can watch the clip, I just have to turn off the sound I think.
3661.30s: Because I think that's how YouTube detects when something's rolling.
3670.26s: Okay, so it's the longer version of that clip got it. Stand by, let me grab that really quick.
3674.90s: So CNBC roaring Kitty live stream full. That's from the cats.
3683.78s: All right, let's see if it's this one.
3695.62s: I'll save you guys the ad.
3704.98s: And then let's see.
3711.46s: I'm super interested.
3714.58s: I assume that they'll have close captions.
3732.10s: Here we go.
3732.90s: We'll get an update on the live stream from roaring Kitty live.
3743.54s: Keith Gale is his real name. Dom Chu, what's been happening? Does it seem like a lot of news?
3748.90s: Nonetheless, it's going on, monitoring this as you can see in the live stream right now. We're
3752.66s: also keep a go close eye on the market action. We are in the middle of what that's hilarious, by the
3757.86s: way. I've never read a teleprompter before, but I just did what I would make fun of just about
3763.46s: everybody or with respect to reading a teleprompter. I don't know if you guys caught that,
3769.86s: but I was reading this right and it's moving relatively quick. And here I literally read this
3776.50s: verbatim and we're also keep a go, which doesn't make any sense, but I was trying to read quickly
3783.38s: enough to keep up with it for you guys. So I now have a little more compassion for those that
3789.62s: fuck up reading a teleprompter because if that thing's moving that quick, I'm just trying to read the
3793.62s: words. Okay. Close eye on the market action. We're in the middle of what appears to be the 13th,
3802.26s: maybe trading halt of the session. So far, it just looks like we resumed trading again. So I think
3809.14s: is by my count, I'll have to go back and check a lot, 13 trading haunts.
3814.90s: Right now the volume stands currently at just around my might be a lag because things are going so
3821.70s: quickly, 197 million shares have traded it in for context over the course of the last 30 days.
3827.38s: The average trading volume has been roughly 61 million. So saying it's very, very volatile.
3833.70s: We have heard a lot of commentary. He did talk a little bit about the beery's drinking and what's
3838.74s: going to happen in the NBA finals early on in the session. But now some of the maybe major,
3844.98s: I guess development, even want to call it that he has not reiterated anything that he has expressed
3852.02s: the overriding philosophy. If you will, that Ryan Cohen at the helm of GameStop is the person
3859.14s: really turned this thing around reiterated some of those feelings. So this doesn't look like
3865.62s: they're talking about him manipulating anything.
3870.82s: This began again, 20 minutes late, down about 37%. Volume is picking up on this. We will bring you
3878.10s: anything more. But again, right now it doesn't seem Scott, like there's anything terribly new.
3883.62s: And nor is he talked about what that's what it ends. So yeah.
3891.54s: So I go back to the original point though, if anybody has anything somewhere of where somebody
3899.38s: from like Citrone left Citadel, a news agency, any of them had said that or that they're claiming
3906.98s: that he's manipulating the stock. I just want to read it in context to be clear. I'm not,
3911.62s: I'm not saying it argumentatively in that I don't believe that it's happened. It very well
3915.70s: could have happened. But I want to read the context because based on the way that it's phrased
3921.22s: in whatever the source document is, it probably has a different meaning than a lot of people are
3926.10s: inferring. I'm guessing. So that's why I want to see it. And then I saw something about Massachusetts
3934.50s: initiated investigations. That's all I've read from credible sources. Investigations are one thing,
3940.10s: right? So let's see, roaring kitty investigation.
3950.42s: So 30 June, I remember this. I was watching this stuff pretty carefully.
3956.66s: And then for June 24, we can take a look at this one.
3964.82s: Okay. Secretary of State investigating, roaring kitty's game stop trades.
3970.58s: Share to screenshot Monday night, 5 million shares. Yep.
3977.86s: It is investigating the trading practices of Brockton resident, roaring kitty.
3986.82s: They're just talking about the stuff he's doing.
3989.30s: Whether it would ban him regarding potential, let's read this.
4006.26s: Sharing investigation sharing details about the investigation, saying it's too early.
4010.90s: They also investigated when he worked at mass mutual.
4014.26s: This latest activity, yeah, this talks about him coming back. Yeah. So there's no real details here.
4021.38s: Let's see this.
4023.62s: E-Trade having internal discussions about whether the band Keith Gale, who just disclosed
4027.70s: a big position in game stop. The brokerage owned by Morgan Stanley reached a decision.
4037.06s: E-Trade declined to comment, saying we don't publicly discuss individual activity of our clients.
4044.58s: It's brokerage found. Yeah, so there's no real.
4051.30s: There's no real nothing in here.
4055.54s: So far at least.
4064.26s: Search Keith Gale mass mutual on it.
4067.70s: Keith Gale mass mutual.
4073.78s: This one.
4083.54s: This one.
4099.22s: This one.
4104.02s: These are same things.
4106.26s: Okay, so let's see.
4114.18s: Mass mutual and best in subsidy agreed to pay 4.75 million to resolve allegations by MSR,
4120.58s: failed to supervise its agents. Yeah, I mean, this is fine.
4134.58s: Yeah, this is no problem.
4137.06s: This is the reason why this is no problem is because when he was working there,
4142.26s: he I'm sure he had very strict rules, compliance rules about what he could or couldn't do.
4150.18s: Failed to detect the activities of Keith Gale, who should have been reporting them, which is correct.
4157.06s: Inadequately supervised other agents, sure.
4163.62s: Yeah, so they they had a sloppy admin process.
4177.14s: Yeah.
4182.90s: Titi says they had foreign employees who were acting but not registered. Yeah, I saw that up here
4189.14s: failing to register. So yeah, so this again, this isn't manipulation or anything.
4196.58s: This is his company got fined as they should have because they his company.
4204.98s: Like Keith Gale shouldn't have done this while he was working there.
4209.86s: It's definitely against compliance.
4212.58s: And then with that aside, his company should have detected it earlier to shut it down.
4218.82s: Or fire him.
4220.58s: And that didn't happen. So then because it came to light in such a public manner,
4225.38s: then obviously they they figured it all out.
4230.26s: So yeah, there's nothing wrong. Titi, I don't think there's anything in here that.
4236.98s: Yeah, none of this surprised me at all. This this looks completely correct.
4243.22s: Lack of oversight. So we already read that. What's this one?
4249.30s: Still probing Gale's activities around the Reddit rally. Yeah.
4260.98s: Rantini says you're asking what we're talking about with the investigation.
4264.18s: No, I was asking.
4267.94s: I was just asking if anybody has any sources direct sources of any of these entities alleging
4274.74s: that he is manipulating price. That's that's what I was asking for.
4281.62s: The investigations themselves like that's not even an investigation into Roryne Kitty.
4285.78s: That's an investigation into mass mutual because of the tie that Roryne Kitty had. But Roryne Kitty
4292.90s: or Keith Gale in that sense. It wasn't even about him. That was about mass mutual.
4297.62s: Let's see. When hedge funds that shorted a game stop were forced to buy it any price.
4309.62s: Fuck them. Fuck them. See, this makes me so angry that these people were saved.
4321.70s: That's the problem with bailouts is a lot of times a bailout has a specific purpose for the
4328.50s: greater good, which I understand in the context of game stop not allowing entire financial
4334.02s: collapse is smart. But I really, really hate that these guys get saved in the middle of it.
4343.94s: Roryne.
4347.78s: Titi says, so Tron research founded by left did accuse Keith Gale of market manipulation June 2024.
4354.98s: I saw that article titled Roryne Kitty's three energy and me position sparks market manipulation claims.
4360.90s: Yeah. So that one that you're talking about. I remember reading that one.
4366.26s: And left is, he's in an interesting spot here. Andrew left.
4374.90s: Roryne Kitty manipulation.
4386.58s: I'm trying to find the original
4396.74s: here we go.
4398.66s: So I remember reading like the actual thing that he put out. I forgot what it was.
4404.90s: This one.
4409.86s: I think this is what you are citing. Roryne, Titi, we'll take a look at that one too.
4417.62s: So much as wrong said left.
4421.14s: F's.
4422.50s: Monday was totally different. He puts his monster position, no thesis, no short term options.
4430.02s: I personally do not believe this is own personal money.
4433.94s: Size of the trade was 150. Who's fucking money does he think it is?
4438.10s: Who the fuck is going to give him $150 million here? Let me try my business pitch for you guys
4444.66s: really quick. Let me know if you would give me the money. Hey guys, I just want to grab a quick
4449.78s: 150 mill from you so that I can buy options that expire in a month.
4454.58s: Is that cool? Can I grab those really quick? Just just 150 mill.
4460.58s: Oh yeah, if they expire out of the money, the money's completely gone. Yeah, that's a thing.
4465.46s: I'm not really worried about that, but that's that is what would happen. Yeah, see, I guess it works
4470.50s: great. So Roryne, Titi says he was paranoid of Kitty. I think he thought it was this thing and
4476.74s: then he has, yeah, exactly. I think that I think that left was frustrated that Roryne Kitty could
4485.06s: again influence the price enough that it would fuck his positions. Like, I absolutely think that.
4491.86s: For sure.
4498.10s: Assuming he made 200 million first time, I just don't think it's his money. There should be
4502.42s: some form of disclosure. If it's not, you know, that he went out there to really shake this world.
4509.62s: I don't think there's anything GameStop is going to say in the next two weeks. What he's doing
4513.38s: now is trying to take advantage of the retail traders, the same people that he's supposed to
4516.50s: represent three and a half years ago. Yeah, like this is him just giving him really negative
4520.58s: attributions because he's a fucking hater. Whenever someone shorts GameStop, have to do it cost
4527.30s: it's sleigh. It's different this time. I think if given the opportunity to short the stock was
4535.54s: at 40 this morning, it's great. I don't recommend people short stocks. I don't think we,
4542.26s: I think they want to have any patience.
4545.94s: Yeah.
4547.94s: So I remember, I remember reading an article by him where he was saying that like,
4552.74s: he was saying some shit like it feels like it's different this time that he's doing
4559.14s: like something different or whatever.
4567.78s: Yeah. So where's the actual post though? The Tron research prominent short criticized Gil
4574.74s: for alleged manipulation in, there you go, appearing more like manipulation without
4581.14s: assault thesis. That's what it was. That's right. It was an ex post. I totally forgot about that.
4588.58s: Totally forgot about that. I thought it was like an email thing that he sent out. I forgot.
4595.22s: Significant near term options appearing more like manipulation without assault thesis. Yeah.
4605.46s: Backed by a larger entity. I'm also so curious like, did he ever justify whatever this means?
4615.06s: Like, backed by a lot like what entity? I don't understand that part at all.
4626.50s: Off Putin says Gil walked him in the casino and put 68 million on black and one left his jealous.
4631.06s: I mean, it definitely does seem like part of that. I absolutely think that.
4638.02s: Citroen just rambled about unsubstantiated claims says,
4641.62s: ball, I completely agree. Yeah. I mean, this is all that's I couldn't agree more.
4646.26s: Like, I think this is all madness, right? To suggest something like this, we think someone is
4651.86s: backing Gil. There's no way he made this size trade alone. Like, who? Who?
4660.74s: Like could again, like objectively, could there be somebody backing him? Sure. Of course,
4665.86s: there could be, but there's no evidence of it anywhere so far. So for him to say this like,
4673.86s: as decisively as that is fucking crazy, it makes no sense. It's I completely agree with you guys
4679.78s: that this is him just trying to be sour. And I think that he's trying to put a negative spin on him
4687.54s: so that people start decoupling because I think left acknowledges that the cat can move the stock.
4694.90s: He doesn't want the cat to move the stock because it hurts him. So I think he's trying to break apart
4701.06s: the cat's ability to move the stock by disparaging the cat so that his thinking is that the people that
4708.10s: follow the cat will read this and then be enlightened and then stop following the cat,
4714.82s: which would then decrease how much the stock can move. Because again, like the cat himself,
4720.34s: he can move the stock to a degree, but not again, like impacting the stock is not like long term
4727.14s: in nature. It's shorter term. But one of the reasons why we're in Kitty can impact the stock so
4734.02s: significantly is because it's not just him. It's lots of people moving with him. So I think he
4741.70s: sees this and he's trying to break that apart. Jordan says didn't Gil say in the live note, yeah,
4748.58s: he said that as well. He said that it's his money. He said that it's his only account. He did say
4752.74s: that. It's his only position. He said it's his only position. So yeah, this is just fucking bullshit to
4762.26s: me. So Tron was the latest short seller to announce a short position that they are short GME again.
4775.94s: They lost over a hundred million shorting GME. That's hilarious.
4780.42s: Fuck him. For someone who's short GME, you don't pay much attention to your investment.
4788.10s: V was buying in the money calls late April, May, 100K at a time. Those trades were worth over 10
4795.62s: million each on May 13th and 14th. Yeah, it's awesome.
4805.30s: You know, it's funny. We had the very same questions about your short positions in which they
4809.22s: were reported at over 240% before the squeeze. So lost. Fucking crazy.
4823.06s: So oh yeah, here. Sood for securities fraud. Yeah, who did this?
4829.14s: Jamazz driver
4835.22s: this guy. This guy did it. So this dude, and I remember because they filed it and they
4862.26s: rescinded it as fast as they filed it. It was wild. I want to look at the dates. So that's what
4872.34s: June 28th, June 28th. Yeah, they filed it on like the 28th and they pulled it back. I want to say
4878.18s: like the 30th. I don't even think it made it through the weekend, which is classic. Well, he says
4885.14s: it shouldn't be possible to short over 100% completely agree. I want 100% agree. It doesn't make
4890.42s: any sense. I have no like, how can you, how can you short more than exists? Like that's,
4901.78s: yeah, it's complete bullshit. It's absolute absolute bullshit. Dislike that fully. But yeah,
4909.62s: this dude, I thought the timing of this was generally interesting.
4921.30s: Oh, yeah, we have to update the map. I have to hop off in a minute. But before we go, we got to
4925.54s: see if we have any new ads to our map. And so then we have to figure out for the, for the next video
4936.42s: on Saturday, one of the things that I want to do is like pick one of the specific
4942.98s: ideas or themes. And I want to analyze it in depth. So is there, can you guys list out for me?
4955.06s: Could you list out a couple of like the primary theories around what's going on? And then I'll
4960.66s: put it up to a vote to see which one we should go through in depth next week. I want to try to go
4966.58s: through like all the different materials and understand how people are coming up with the theories.
4972.02s: More in depth. And then in the meantime, do we have any updates to our map?
4978.42s: We have all the US. We have someone in Mexico, which is good. We have South America. We still have
4982.90s: no Africans. It would be good to get one of those. The Madagascarian theories about what?
4989.14s: There's like a ton of different lore and just theories about either the cat or the movement
4996.50s: of GameStop. And I want to start, that's where I want to pivot to next. Okay, got it. Yeah, so
5004.26s: let me try to reframe the question. So from my understanding in the GameStop community,
5011.62s: there are different theories that are designed to try to explain what's going on. And to, it seems
5019.70s: in general to forecast when something is likely to occur again and why. I would love to take a look
5028.34s: at any of those primary theories. So one of them that I know about is like Biggie's theory. I don't
5034.26s: know anything about it realistically. I don't remember anything about it, but I remember that Newton and
5038.98s: I on our live stream had talked about that. I don't know if there are others similar to that. If not,
5046.18s: we can just I can look up that one and see what we can learn because what I want to do is see what
5051.94s: they're suggesting. And then I want to align it against the chart to see what like what has
5060.74s: actually been done. So if there's like a Reddit post that talks about the theory or if there's a
5066.82s: video that talks about the theory, I'd love to grab that stuff so that we can pick one and then
5074.90s: take a take a good look at. Jack says no as tomorrow. Now that is a belief. And that one is a I
5084.02s: love that one. That's hilarious. I absolutely loved it. I absolutely love that. So yeah, in you
5091.38s: can you guys can like throw it in the discord. You guys can throw it in a YouTube comment or
5096.58s: something whatever. But that's what I want to do for the next one is like actually go through the
5100.98s: Superstalk and GameStop Reddit and see what kind of theories exist so that we can explore them
5109.22s: a little bit more. So that's the game plan for next Saturday. And for everybody's awareness,
5117.78s: I have it in the newsletter for this coming week, but the production or the content schedule is
5124.18s: going to be a little bit different. So I'm doing the outlier pro, the Patreon live stream,
5130.42s: that'll be Sunday and Wednesday. Then there will be YouTube lives Monday and Friday. And then
5137.54s: Tuesday and Thursday, they're kind of ad hoc. Like if something's going on, then sure, if not,
5144.26s: then no. And the reason why I do that is because I take commitments very seriously. So for the last
5151.54s: month, I told you guys I was going to live stream every day, which I did within reason. I think I
5155.86s: missed a couple because of the travel, but otherwise I didn't miss anything. And so I still will
5160.74s: probably live stream most days because I enjoyed a lot, but I am committing to those days specifically.
5168.02s: And then we'll kind of see what happens as the week's go out. Then I'm still going to do the Saturday
5172.98s: live streams for GameStop because I still feel like there's a little bit more that I still need to
5177.54s: dig into. So yeah, that's the game plan. All right gang, if you guys need anything, let me know
5184.98s: be an ape, be an outlier or be an outlier ape. And I will catch you guys all around. Enjoy your weekend.
