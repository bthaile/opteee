0.00s:  Well, what's happening? We'll give this a couple of seconds to turn on. And then we are
8.96s:  going to dive in. How's everybody doing? Cool. It looks like we are alive. Happy Saturday.
18.94s:  What's up to all the outliers to the apes and the outlier apes, whatever combination
25.62s:  there of. So I was looking through the broader series here and believe it or not, we've
33.30s:  gone through this is our 17th episode. That means for 17 weeks, we've been talking about
40.34s:  game stop in different ways and for a pretty significant majority for the recent ones.
47.98s:  I actually have to look it up super fast for the recent Jimmy live streams to see, what
53.38s:  is it part eight? So this is part nine of actually looking at the cat's trades. And this
61.86s:  should be, I think the finale for this part because we've literally gone through all of
68.26s:  his trades now. And we took a look in the last video at some of his more recent positions.
76.34s:  Now I think it's time to reflect, to go back through specifically the cat's trading style.
84.02s:  And that was the goal for the session tonight is I wanted to poke through it at a high level,
88.66s:  kind of reconfirmed some of the things that I thought I saw as we were going through it.
93.38s:  And to go through some of the logs that we've built about some of the tendencies.
97.70s:  But there's a few really big ticket items that immediately jump out at me that really represent
106.18s:  his trading style. And I have to be completely honest with you. It is 100% different than I
113.14s:  originally thought because a lot of the people that I spoke to in the beginning really made me
121.46s:  think, and this isn't to their fault, I understand why people would think this. But they really
126.58s:  made it made me think that there was this really secret grandmaster plan that was figured out
135.70s:  and he essentially was executing pinpoint accurately. And he's obviously crushed it. So let's
147.14s:  make sure we emphasize that point specifically because when we first started looking at his very,
155.30s:  very, very first trade here posted on Reddit, and I think this is when he was still posting
161.62s:  on Wall Street bets. Yeah, the very first thing that he posted here, his account was valued at like,
168.50s:  well, the Yolo account I should say specifically was valued at $100,000. And he's taken $100,000
174.74s:  and turned it into over $200 million. That requires an acknowledgement, a massive acknowledgement.
183.06s:  That's more money than all of us will probably have. And I mean, I do pretty well.
190.66s:  I don't think I'm going to exceed the $200 million mark.
197.30s:  Specifically in a trading account, that's not to cap out what my total footprint could eventually
204.66s:  look like in some degree in all asset classes. We'll see about that. But specifically in terms of
210.58s:  what's residing just in a trading account, I feel pretty confident in that summation. And it's
216.90s:  primarily because as a trader, I recognize the fact that trading is highly tax disadvantaged.
225.30s:  It's not like real estate. And trading has a lot of pros associated with it as far as I'm concerned.
232.66s:  One of the biggest pros that come with trading is that it genuinely is a solo endeavor that
239.30s:  genuinely can be done from anywhere. There's no planning calls. There's no, there's literally no
245.94s:  other party that you have to work with in any capacity to make this work and to make a lot of
251.70s:  fucking money doing it, right? There are a lot of pros that come from trading. There are also a lot
257.46s:  of cons. It's not cheap in terms of commissions, overall friction that we face as retail traders.
263.62s:  And it's not tax advantaged in any way whatsoever. And that's a big thing because the US government
270.58s:  specifically, because I know that there's people on the stream that pop in from all over the place.
275.38s:  And we actually have to do our map in a moment. I'm waiting a few minutes to let everybody
280.74s:  funnel their funnel their way in. But it's not tax advantaged. And the US government
288.26s:  absolutely tax advantages pretty heavily real estate in a lot of different ways.
293.62s:  Both in terms of the leverage they provide to you in terms of the tax treatment on what you can
298.58s:  make. The fact that there's fucking 1031 exchanges, it's incredible. For those that are unfamiliar,
305.38s:  1031 exchanges to put it in trading terms, I'll show you. I'll literally draw it out because a lot
312.74s:  of people don't understand this. And it's kind of like a superpower.
320.10s:  So let's take a look at a standard margin account here. And I want to look at trading first.
330.26s:  So trading, you have your 100K account, whatever it is,
338.58s:  then you sling a few trades. You make 10K, which is awesome. And in the course of making that 10K,
347.06s:  this has happened by buying and selling within a year. And as you're going through this process,
355.70s:  you make your money, come end of year, you owe capital gains because you realized profit here.
368.10s:  Now in real estate, it's different. Real estate if I buy a house,
377.30s:  hopefully the roof looks a little better than that. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't buy it,
380.50s:  to be honest. The windows don't matter so much. The foundation is kind of jacked. But if you buy
385.94s:  a house and you buy the house for $100,000, you put your 20% down. So you're actually using 20K.
394.26s:  And then you go to sell the house. And when you sell the house, you sell it for 110K,
402.42s:  ish. And you still only put in 20K, but you still have rights to that 10K profit. But there's
409.38s:  a beautiful thing that happens here. There's called a 1031 exchange. And in a 1031 exchange,
418.42s:  I can take the proceeds from this. I could essentially directly move it. You can't touch it,
425.46s:  meaning it can't go to a personal account and then back out. You have to obviously talk to,
429.94s:  talk to a tax professional. I am a talking idiot and don't know what I'm talking about.
436.10s:  Always remember that. But you can't touch it. This money can then be put into another house.
444.02s:  This one has a worse looking foundation, but a better looking roof. And as long as you haven't
450.26s:  touched this money, this is not a taxable event. There's no tax here. So you made the same 10K.
458.58s:  However, you've not paid taxes on it. You roll it into another asset. And then you continue on
465.38s:  in this manner. So 1031 exchanges are kind of like magic from a tax perspective at least.
471.14s:  There's obviously more to it. This is a broken down version of that. So bringing all of this back
478.34s:  to the cat, which is what this session is about. The fact that this dude has taken $200 million
486.82s:  and put it into a trading vehicle that is exceedingly tax disadvantaged is incredible.
495.46s:  And it goes back to the same exact thing that I've been talking about that I cannot help
501.94s:  but continue to be purely fascinated by the fact that this dude does shit that financially
510.50s:  doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. But it still works like a mother. So you can't knock it.
519.70s:  But but from a pragmatic perspective, it's kind of crazy to see somebody with that kind of money
530.50s:  doing this sort of thing. Cedric says, maybe it makes sense for him. You're misinterpreting my point.
536.82s:  There's an objective reality about the about the financial implications of using a margin
547.38s:  account. That's all I'm saying. And obviously it works for him. There's literally no debate about
553.22s:  that. The dude's made $200 million objectively. It has worked and then some. But in terms of this being a
562.42s:  when I say when I say like it doesn't make sense, I mean in the context of trying to minimize a
570.98s:  tax footprint while doing this, right? This is getting this is taxes to the face. And it goes
578.98s:  back to the broader theme that we've talked about before that you can tell repeatedly that this is not
585.14s:  done to over streamline stuff. And that's one of the main things that I've come across as I've
591.46s:  been analyzing all of these trades that this dude has made is that his motivation is very different.
600.58s:  And we've talked about this and I want to take a step back and actually talk about that as well
606.42s:  for a moment because when I'm talking about the way that this that this dude has traded and the
614.58s:  amount of time that we've spent analyzing his approach is that it really is very unique. It's very
622.42s:  specific to him, but one of the overarching themes that is very clear to me is that this is not
631.14s:  purely motivated by money. And again, I think we've already known that. But as you guys know as we've
638.58s:  gone through a lot of this series, the goal is not to take something that we've heard and just
645.70s:  accept it and then apply that as truth going forward, right? The whole point of me doing this
651.30s:  is a process that I do with a lot of things that I'm interested in, which is lay my own eyes on
657.06s:  the things so that I can see it for myself. And I think it's really, really important for me to see
664.10s:  it for myself because then it helps me pick up on different little things along the way which we're
668.66s:  going to talk about. But the the fact that this is done this way, it tells this is not purely
678.34s:  motivated by money. It's not. I can see that it's not. And it begs the question, what is the motivation?
686.50s:  And there's lots of conjecture out there. I still have my Tim foil hat ready to go as soon as we need it
691.62s:  because I don't know. I don't know what the motivation is. Some people think it's him trying to
697.78s:  just play the game. Some people think it's him that's trying to stick it to the system and
705.38s:  play with the hedge funds and you know, all these different kinds of things which
709.38s:  I have to who knows who knows. But as I look across a lot of what he's done, I honestly think a lot of
717.46s:  this is a really smart dude, an incredibly smart dude that knows exactly what he's doing that is
725.38s:  fucking around to a pretty big degree. I think he likes trolling a lot. And I think that the
733.46s:  nomenclature right from the jump for this whole thing is completely transparent, right? Like it's
740.66s:  started with a yolo account. So Josh says, what's the motivation of find the motivation? Because
750.26s:  it's fucking interesting. That's why it is fucking interesting. It's kind of like, and I've said this
758.50s:  before. Josh says he lives rent free in my head. Yes. Of course he does. I enjoy looking at his stuff.
766.18s:  I've talked about this a million times. I'm fascinated by this. The reason why I'm so fascinated
771.78s:  by this is because I've spent a lot of time in markets. I've come across exactly zero instances
782.34s:  of this kind of behavior from a retail trader. So like in a pure sense, this is not only an outlier,
790.82s:  which is my entire fucking brand is this kind of stuff. But more important, that's how my brain works.
797.78s:  But more importantly than that, I'm literally looking at an anomaly. Like I'm looking at,
805.94s:  it's like the matrix when like that little kid holds up the spoon and they're like, well, what if
810.66s:  the spoon isn't a spoon or whatever and he like fucking bent over or whatever. So it's absolutely
820.58s:  it's absolutely an incredible thing to see. So he doesn't live rent free in my head. And I've
826.74s:  told you guys this before as well. Like he doesn't live rent free that like, I'm trying to crack the
830.90s:  code of what he's doing so I can do it. Like I've said that a million times. I honestly would never
835.62s:  trade like him. I know that I wouldn't. I honestly don't have any interest in trading like him.
841.14s:  But I can fully appreciate and enjoy looking at the way that he's trading. So the reason why he
849.46s:  lives in my head is because I'm interested in it. Like a lot of stuff, right? Astrophysics
854.42s:  lives rent free in my head. I'm fascinated by it. I have a fucking telescope over here that I paid
860.98s:  a lot of money for so that I could just look at shit in the sky that my brain can't really comprehend
866.50s:  because I'm interested in it. So this is absolutely absolutely something that I enjoy looking at
874.82s:  because how could I not? It's like if if you play basketball when Mugsie Mugsie Bose
883.62s:  Mugsie Bose was really interesting and he got a lot of attention for some time because he was an
891.78s:  anomaly in professional basketball. He had a style based on his size which was an outlier
899.70s:  onto to the negative to the downside. Not like a giant dude and he completely created a style
909.62s:  around himself. So he also was an anomaly that anybody that was a fan of basketball knew about him
916.98s:  and it's for that reason. So yeah, I love looking at this stuff. You guys know, I just said at the
922.98s:  beginning of this, spent the last 17 weeks straight on Saturday night looking at this stuff
929.14s:  because it interests me that much. That's why I'm here. So I love it. I think the ability to look
936.34s:  at something like this and to just understand what's going on here while try to understand is
942.66s:  very, very fun. Very, very fun. It has been a it's been a long ride so far. So
951.86s:  just as people collect things, some people collect money.
958.50s:  Oh, are you saying that like that's what he's trying to do here is just collect more coupons?
963.46s:  Because again, if so, I don't I actually don't think that's the case. He could have made a lot
968.34s:  more money with his money at this point if he moved out of stocks. That's just an objective
974.98s:  reality. Once you have the kind of scale that he does, if his goal was just to make more gold coins,
984.26s:  he absolutely would have moved out into a couple other kind of asset classes that are highly
989.38s:  restrictive by the amount of money that you have, which makes it far less competitive to a degree,
994.66s:  way more opportunities to a degree and way more structurally advantage in terms of leverage provided.
1002.18s:  So it's not. I don't think this is an expression at all of him just trying to build more gold coins.
1011.62s:  So, Cedric says, so what asset classes five extra money in three years?
1017.22s:  Honestly, a bunch of stuff can. It's, but the thing that we have to remember is that there are
1025.06s:  economies of scale that we have to be aware of. So let's draw it out. I'll show you what I mean.
1035.14s:  So, if you have $10, your ability to double this money into $20 is not well suited to buying
1049.38s:  $10 of stock. Something that makes more sense for you to be able to double your $10 is you go do Uber
1057.78s:  for two rides and you get $10 in total tips, you've doubled your money. This is a pretty efficient way to do it.
1067.62s:  Okay, so now let's scale this $100,000. What's a good place to double $100,000? The stock market,
1076.58s:  the stock market is literally perfect for that kind of thing. The reason why the stock market is
1082.98s:  perfect for this kind of thing is because this amount of money cannot get you a ton of leverage
1091.30s:  in the kind of real estate that offers the ability to double and triple and quadruple.
1097.78s:  So $100,000 in residential real estate, you still can get into a decent-size house,
1104.98s:  but residential real estate moves very different than commercial. So you are way too small right now
1111.54s:  to fuck with commercial real estate with this kind of money stock market, literally perfect,
1116.98s:  perfect place to grow your money. Now, as you start getting into the tens of millions of dollars,
1125.62s:  your scale is now different. The places that you can play are now different and there are different
1132.82s:  asset classes that can start to make a lot of sense for your money. So, for example,
1138.98s:  if you get into angel investing, for example, you can absolutely double your money relatively
1147.62s:  quickly in angel investing. What's the drawback? Ones of fucking risk. Buckets of risk.
1155.94s:  Drows of risk, but really effective place if you can find the right kinds of deals. I've been in
1163.86s:  angel investing for a long time now. So, there's a ton of potential there.
1169.06s:  Commercial real estate is another fantastic place depending on the asset class and depending on
1174.90s:  what you're doing. If you're doing value add to properties or if you're scooping up properties
1180.18s:  that have been really beaten down, again, it's another really great place to double your money and
1185.38s:  then some because you gain access to way more leverage than you can in the stock market.
1190.42s:  Now, that's just going back to other ways to go about growing your money. That's not to suggest
1197.22s:  at all that you can't continue building your money in the stock market, of course you can.
1202.58s:  Just saying that there's other places that actually start to make a little bit more sense in terms
1206.90s:  of the leverage provided against the risk that you're taking because as you're getting into different
1210.98s:  kind of, as you're getting into different kind of asset classes, for example, looking at something
1219.70s:  $10 million, if you wanted to double your $10 million by trading a single stock, GameStop,
1225.86s:  for example, you have to use the $10 million. You have to put all of the $10 million into the stock
1234.02s:  so that then it can do what you want it to do to try to double your money. You have to use your
1238.66s:  money to do that. With real estate, you can take that $10 million and you can break it out into a
1244.98s:  bunch of different down payments for things so that instead of having all $10 million in one
1250.10s:  asset class hoping that that one doubles, you can have it into multiple deals that still provide
1254.98s:  you full access to the potential gains because of the leverage provided by real estate. The completely
1260.42s:  different thing. So all of that not to get super far off topic, but that's to answer. It looks like
1266.18s:  Cedric's question is that there are a lot of things that you can put capital into the main thing
1271.94s:  to keep in mind is that it changes as your resources scale. That's the main point. What you're
1280.66s:  able to do is going to change massively by resource scaling. And it looks like this needs to be
1289.62s:  squished down a little bit so you guys can see the edge of this. Huh? There we go. I was wondering
1295.78s:  why that was like so far over. Sweet. Rory and Titi. Hey, yo, Rory and Titi, what up? Good to see you.
1304.74s:  Shout out to Rory and Titi as you know, everybody that's one of the one of the greatest names that we
1309.70s:  have here. That Lauren says, what if your account is three and a half K and three Ks in GME? Oh,
1317.38s:  I see Rory and Titi said gas, not a full porter blast for me. Yeah. So Lauren, it looks like Rory and Titi
1322.98s:  is now disappointed in you because it looks like you have more money that could be in a stock. That's not.
1330.82s:  You're kind of reminded me of Warren Buffett by sitting on all of that cash, right? I think
1337.06s:  Warren Buffett just offloaded more of his Apple stake. And I don't even know how much cash that
1343.62s:  dude's sitting on at this point. It's like a comical, comical amount. But because even that's another
1350.10s:  great example, Warren Buffett is a great example of like on the institutional side. Somebody that's
1354.98s:  been able to make a lot of money through markets, but he's not doing it through trading. He's literally
1361.46s:  buying, he's buying the entire company and he's running companies. He's running businesses.
1367.62s:  That's what Berkshire Hathaway does. So it'll hold stock for sure, right? It absolutely gains
1373.62s:  exposure to stock. But a lot of the holdings that he has are things that essentially they're going
1379.62s:  to input and work with management and actually run a business. So that's just a, I think a
1388.42s:  fascinating point about him. That's what he says. Kitty needs to buy this shit. Damn it. Yeah,
1393.62s:  that's and that's a really interesting thing that we're going to have to talk about. So first,
1398.10s:  let's kind of summarize some of the main things that we saw going through his trades. And I would
1403.62s:  love to hear from you as well because a lot of you have been following along this whole series
1409.94s:  as we've gone. So a lot of you have seen everything that I've seen.
1416.26s:  So as you think about this stuff that we've looked at so far, what do we think? What do you think
1423.94s:  about the trading approach, the trading style? There's a bunch of stuff that jumps out to me,
1428.02s:  which obviously I will happily, I'll happily explain my thoughts, but I don't want to offer them
1434.66s:  before you guys have a chance to share yours because I don't want to add any bias to the way that
1439.86s:  you're thinking. But I think that there's a ton, literally a ton of really, really,
1447.38s:  really interesting things to pull out from his approach. So I'll give you a couple of seconds
1453.22s:  there. Vladimir says, Bezos sold another three billion of Amazon stock on Friday. His
1458.90s:  girlfriend must be fun. Listen, man, if you're out there trying to build new mega yachts,
1464.58s:  it doesn't happen, right? It doesn't happen overnight. You're going to have to use a couple
1468.66s:  dollars for it. So yeah, he seems to say, I don't think he's done with GME. I don't think so either.
1474.74s:  I see, I see nothing that leads me to believe that he's moved away from GameStop. I don't see
1481.22s:  that at all. One of the things I'm really curious about from his perspective is like genuinely,
1486.34s:  how does he view his role in the community? Because there is absolutely a 100% reality to the fact
1496.34s:  that tons of people idolize him, which is okay, right? There's nothing inherently wrong with that.
1503.46s:  But the thing that makes me a little more interested is that tons of people literally
1510.66s:  try to follow what he's doing and he knows this. I don't know how he thinks about that. And I've
1518.58s:  spent actually quite a long time thinking about that. Rowan Tady says he literally thinks he's Batman.
1524.66s:  I think he's sort of Batman. The reason why I say I think he's sort of Batman is again like
1533.06s:  Batman has a little bit of a direct impact. And if I were to look at the vast majority of people
1542.10s:  who trade GameStop trying to copy what he does, I would wager the majority of them
1548.58s:  have lost money. Like that, that would be my genuine guess. I don't want it to be true.
1554.26s:  But that would absolutely be my guess. So the reason why I say that is because if Rowan
1559.62s:  Kitty was really trying to be like Batman and genuinely trying to help and save people from evil
1566.34s:  or whatever evil in this case just being the stock market or helping them make money whatever
1570.74s:  the case is, I'm not actually sure that I see that happening here. I don't. And the reason why I say
1579.30s:  that is because if he was trying to do that, Rowan Tady says you clearly haven't watched his meme
1588.02s:  movie. Let's take a look at it. I think I have seen it. I'm pretty sure because I know that he
1592.98s:  has references to Batman, Joker and stuff like that. I'm just talking in terms of like his actions,
1599.38s:  like what he's functionally doing. And he's a smart dude. He's a really smart dude. And this
1606.02s:  goes back to my prior point that I know that he knows that he has a direct impact on how GameStop
1615.86s:  moves in the short term. He has a direct impact on investor and trader behavior as it relates to
1624.58s:  GameStop. I know that he knows that. So then the question becomes what does he think about that?
1631.54s:  And how does he handle that kind of responsibility? Because I don't know. I don't know how he
1640.90s:  thinks about that. Even with the stuff that I do in such a small scale, I still contest with like,
1648.42s:  what's my responsibility? Like as it pertains to what other people do. Because even as I talk about
1656.98s:  different things, that's one of the reasons why I'm so careful about the stuff that I talk about,
1662.18s:  when I talk about it, how I talk about it is because no matter what I do, people try to copy
1668.50s:  what I do. And then I'll get emails from people saying like, oh yeah, what do you think I should do?
1672.82s:  I put on this too. And like the first thing I think is like, you shouldn't have fucking done
1677.06s:  anything based on what you think I'm doing. But anyways, all that aside, he knows all this stuff.
1684.18s:  And I'm curious what I'm curious what he thinks about it. And I'm curious what level of responsibility
1691.14s:  he takes because there's a big reality here that again, it's just reality. Let me grab Reddit.
1707.38s:  And let me, oh no, let me just go to his thing really quick. Okay.
1712.02s:  So, genuine question, genuine question from you guys. I'd rather be skiing. Hey, yo, I'd rather be
1722.10s:  skiing. Just hooked 10 people up with a trading, outlier trading membership. So thank you, I'd
1728.10s:  rather be skiing for supporting the channel, supporting the work and you're everybody that got hooked
1733.30s:  up. Make sure that you say, thank you to him. But one of the things that I look at here,
1742.02s:  is genuinely, I'm going to put a poll here.
1750.02s:  All right. So the question and the poll here is, did you genuinely think RK was going to buy
1774.50s:  into Chewie within 15 days of this yellow update? My answer is no. If I could vote mine 100%
1781.94s:  would be no. There is nothing, nothing about this that I would have thought that about at all.
1793.78s:  Vladimir Putin says he publishes many disclaimers on his YouTube channel. I think he's doing a harm.
1798.82s:  Sort of. I don't think he's doing it any harm either because I absolutely believe in general.
1810.18s:  I absolutely believe that he should be able to do whatever he wants and then people are responsible
1814.98s:  for themselves. That's what I believe. There's a reality. There's a reality that there's a lot of
1821.30s:  really young people or just people who don't think clearly or things like that that aren't as
1827.22s:  rational and aren't as capable of making good decisions. And there's a reality that people that
1835.54s:  ascend to different kind of social statuses that they pick up as they gain social status.
1842.58s:  There's a reality to their influence. So I disclaimers or not, I agree with you. He has disclaimers.
1849.70s:  Right. For sure. But the disclaimers don't change the behavior. People are so used to the disclaimers.
1859.22s:  So.
1861.46s:  Roryntiddy says, why do you think you spend so much time teaching people like us? Oh, I think he loves
1865.78s:  the community. I think he loves everybody. I think he loves the stock. I think he loves doing this.
1871.54s:  I absolutely again, I don't think he's a bad actor literally at all. I'm just saying that going
1877.46s:  back to the Batman concept. If he was really trying to be quote unquote Batman and like save
1884.90s:  and help people, you have to work with what you have and what the community is. And the fact that
1892.42s:  essentially the overwhelming majority of people thought the same thing I did where the last
1899.46s:  time we saw an update, there's a big move out of GameStop. There's a reality if, for example,
1907.78s:  he got out of GameStop. I don't know that he got out of GameStop with that's totally up for debate.
1913.30s:  Nobody knows. And that's another point that actually bolsters this point. The fact that nobody knows
1920.02s:  is telling that he's doing stuff not just for trying to help people, but he's also playing his own
1929.30s:  game with his own rules to achieve his own ends. So the reason I bring that back is because as people
1938.26s:  will follow him into something like GameStop. And then if, let's just say if hypothetical if don't
1945.78s:  know either way, if he did sell his stock to then get into Chewie because he needed the $200
1952.74s:  million or so to get into Chewie, if we go back to the stock on 13 June, we got to go back a little
1964.10s:  further. If he unwound somewhere in here that pushes the price of the stock down, at this point,
1978.34s:  the stock was still light enough that him unloading a large amount of shares would undoubtedly move
1986.50s:  the stock near term. So I think in general, he has a tremendous amount of influence. And I'm just
1998.26s:  curious how he thinks about it. I don't think he should do anything different. I think every person
2003.22s:  should be responsible for what they do. That's what I think. So going back though to like his
2013.78s:  broader motivations, that's the part that I can't fully unravel. I'm very interested because it's
2022.90s:  it's just a mystery as it sits now because I can see elements of all these different things coalescing.
2028.74s:  But there's definitely not some sort of like clear output that I can get my arms around right
2035.22s:  now. It's just not there. It's literally and that's going back to the original question I got from
2041.22s:  somebody earlier of, you know, why do I focus on this so much? Because I'm literally watching a
2050.10s:  fucking anomaly and I am fascinated by it. Absolutely fascinated by it.
2057.30s:  Chicken nugget says like his livestream, GME was halted on and off multiple times during a stream,
2061.70s:  his silence creates more power behind the words. Yeah. Well, and this goes back to another thing
2068.50s:  that we've talked about with respect to just communication in general. Because one of the things
2073.78s:  that I've talked about is that like if he genuinely was trying to communicate via memes and stuff
2080.26s:  like that, a lot of what he would be doing wouldn't be as cryptic as it sits. Because again,
2087.94s:  like the messages are clear as mud. Some of them, I think the ones that he really wants to connect
2094.42s:  to people are very clear clear as day. I think it's almost difficult to mistake it for something else.
2100.34s:  We can take a look at like and I talked about this very, very early on when we saw all the movement
2107.54s:  happening with Chewie. The very once we understood this to be Chewie, which a lot of people guessed early
2121.14s:  on nobody really knew. But that was the guess. And the first thing that I picked up on that I told
2128.42s:  you guys about is that there's just green eyes. I know that there's like the look left look right
2133.62s:  as part of the Kansas City City Shuffle. So I'm sure that's baked into this. But I didn't read into
2138.42s:  that part at all. I just think that this is him playing games because he likes Ryan Cohen and he's
2147.14s:  in here for the Lowles. But one thing I think unequivocally the case is this here is once we
2157.38s:  understood this is Chewie. It's clear as day, right? Dog, green eyes, buy. As soon as this came out
2164.66s:  on the 6th of September, I made a video about it and I immediately took this to believe him is selling.
2173.62s:  Could it mean something else? Could. I am pretty fucking confident that this was a clear message
2183.30s:  designed to be clear because he was trying to actually communicate something very specific and he
2189.46s:  wanted people to understand what it meant. This is a really clear communication in my opinion. He's
2195.54s:  still doing his game. He's still playing it via memes. But this is much more clear than people that
2203.22s:  are trying to interpret, for example, the the list of emojis. That's clear as mud. I mean, it's clear
2212.98s:  as mud. That's not to say that there's no meaning behind some or all of them or whatever. But if
2218.18s:  there is, nobody fucking knows it. So then it's not really communication. If nobody understands
2224.66s:  the message, that's just cryptic messaging. But nobody gets it because I've seen nobody nail
2233.30s:  what those emojis mean. It's everybody just guessing, right? Fully so because nobody fucking knows.
2239.78s:  So that's one of the things I can pick up as I spend time looking at him is that when he wants to
2245.70s:  be understood, he makes it so. When he wants to be less understood, he makes it so. And I think that's
2254.50s:  exactly I think that's exactly the the levels of communication that he uses. Again, he's fucking smart.
2262.10s:  He literally knows all of this. Now I'm not saying anything at all that's novel. He knows all of this.
2269.30s:  He's a smart, smart dude. That Lauren says the amount of holds during his live stream is wild. Yeah,
2278.90s:  because the market during that live stream, again, the market acknowledges the fact that if he said
2288.26s:  anything pertaining to GameStop during that period, it would go wild because the market
2298.02s:  acknowledges and knows that he can and does influence the price. So if you think about it from
2306.90s:  a institutional perspective, I'd rather be saying he says he was proving he's not the one controlling
2313.70s:  the stock price that the system accuses him for. No, it's that's not the case at all because he does
2318.50s:  control the stock price. But he doesn't that people confuse these things massively. Just because he
2324.90s:  can influence the stock price doesn't mean to your point that he controls it. I don't think anybody
2329.46s:  thinks that he controls where GameStop goes. Nobody thinks that. But most people acknowledge the fact
2337.30s:  that he absolutely does influence price. And like most individual actors, just like what's that
2344.58s:  research firm that does. The fuck is it that they do the not citron research that's one of them
2354.26s:  in Denver. Pindenburg research. They also influence price citron influences price. They know this,
2362.66s:  right? That's exactly why citron was doing what they were doing because they knew they influenced
2367.78s:  price and they could play games around it. So all I'm saying is that there's a difference between
2373.70s:  influencing price, moving price temporarily. So like for example, during that GameStop live stream,
2381.38s:  if he had said something like, I don't like to I don't like to stock anymore, I'm getting out.
2388.74s:  What do you think would have happened? This stock would have fucking cratered. It would have
2395.94s:  absolutely cratered if that happened again, hypothetical. But if it did, it would have cratered.
2402.18s:  He knows that the market also knows that. So while he's on the live stream, the reason why the stock
2410.26s:  is flying all over the place is because there's so much volatility around him speaking because nobody
2419.46s:  knows what he's going to say. It's a live stream. Nobody knows what the reaction is going to be.
2426.10s:  So if you look at the volatility during that live stream, it was astronomical as it should be.
2433.70s:  Because things he say can and do influence the short term price movement of the stock.
2439.70s:  And he's a really big portfolio during the live stream during the live market.
2443.86s:  There's a reason why earnings are after hours to decrease that kind of volatility. If earnings were
2450.26s:  during hours, it would be just like that. It would be just like that for the vast majority of them.
2456.18s:  So it was essentially a live earnings event. But the market was open and it's what the dude that came
2464.18s:  on to the stream, looking like he would, I got to pull that up. That is, I think that's one of the
2471.62s:  times when I realized I was in love with this guy because the way that he started that live stream
2485.22s:  was like, Epic doesn't even encapsulate it. Epic fall short. I don't know what's bigger than
2494.10s:  Epic. But whatever is bigger than Epic is what it was. I don't know what's bigger than Epic. But
2502.10s:  whatever that is is what this was in my opinion. I don't. Legendary. Thank you. Yeah. Legendary.
2513.06s:  I think legendary is the part. Thank you guys. I was at a loss for words. I think legendary is
2518.42s:  exactly what this was because the fact that he started the stream like this.
2530.58s:  This.
2548.34s:  This and as he's doing this, as he's doing this, the fucking news stations are streaming him.
2560.58s:  So there's these people in fucking suits and ties and like professional people on professional
2570.66s:  news sites that are streaming this. It was so epic. I just knew that this dude is fucking incredible.
2584.58s:  Chakin Nugget says, wasn't he like 20 minutes late too? I think he did that once he realized that
2588.98s:  the news stations were following him because I don't think that he would have been unnecessarily 20 minutes
2594.18s:  late for all of his people. Like I think that he saw the news stations started like rolling his stuff.
2604.82s:  And I literally just think it was to fucking the news station. That's actually another great question
2612.58s:  for his other live streams. Was he on time like when he was live streaming for you guys or was he
2619.38s:  late to those? Because my sense is that he would be generally on time, but I can also see like the
2626.74s:  Conor McGregor effect where some people loved Conor McGregor so much that they couldn't care less
2633.30s:  that he was late. It's like the exact opposite of my brain. If somebody's not punctual, I don't
2638.82s:  fuck with that. Like punctuality is very important to me, but I understand a lot of people are more
2643.94s:  La Jai fair about that on time and stoked to start if I recall correctly. Yeah, that would be my guess
2651.30s:  is that when he was doing streams for the community, my guess is that he probably would have been on time.
2658.10s:  And yeah, I think here he absolutely saw that they were streaming that they were streaming his stream.
2668.26s:  And the opportunity to just fuck around with them and do this. Oh, God, I actually want to see if I
2675.86s:  can find a video of like CMBC. Was that one of the groups that streamed him? I just want to like
2683.30s:  I want to see what they talked about. CNBC
2689.30s:  roaring kitty live stream.
2698.42s:  Look at these two results. Look at these first two results. Look at this guy.
2712.82s:  Oh my God, this is epic. That's so good.
2719.14s:  It's so good. Oh, they have them talking and stuff. Well, they probably would edit out the part
2730.58s:  that they were like sitting there like fucking idiots waiting for him. God, that's so funny. That's
2736.58s:  so fucking funny. So fucking funny. But yeah, anyways, the reason why the stock was flying around
2746.90s:  like that is because Roenton is just play the audio. I don't think we can. The intro to this one
2753.86s:  or on one of these. I think I can only do like 10 seconds because then YouTube turns me off.
2761.94s:  But which ones we can try? Play the audio with which one? This one or this one?
2768.18s:  I mean, I'll 100% risk it.
2780.66s:  News coverage. You can on news. No, you can't. So the thing about fair use is to talk about that
2789.06s:  for a second is that I can argue the point after the live streams over for them to release it.
2797.46s:  Well, what they do is during the live streams we've done this before, they literally they cut off
2802.66s:  the live stream and then they don't let me reconnect. So it kills the live stream and then I can
2808.98s:  appeal it and I could say no, this was fair use. We were talking about it in a transformative manner.
2814.82s:  Like you can absolutely argue it, but that it kills the live stream. So I'm still again,
2821.38s:  we get like 10 seconds that I know we can absolutely run it for like 10 seconds.
2826.10s:  So if you let me know which one I'm happy to let it run for a few seconds. Again, I'll risk it
2831.22s:  for this because it's hilarious, but I just don't know which one is the right one because they got
2835.38s:  two different dudes covering two different sections or the this one. Okay.
2842.58s:  And is this the beginning of it?
2848.58s:  All right, here we go.
2855.54s:  With breaking news because the live stream has finally started, you can see that right there.
2866.34s:  About 28 or so minutes late, but nonetheless it is underway and we'll see exactly what's
2873.54s:  going to happen there. Andrew left still standing by will give you updates when they happen.
2879.54s:  Judge for yourself, what's going on on your screen?
2885.86s:  You could tell that this dude is so disenfranchised about this.
2889.94s:  You could tell that he's sitting here thinking like what the fuck? Here I am in a fucking suit and tie.
2905.78s:  He's been working for 50 years straight. He's been sucking dick for all the people at the place so
2912.02s:  that he could get his spot on the desk. He has to bow down to whoever's on the teleprompter to
2917.54s:  make sure that they put the right shit on. And meanwhile, he's looking at this dude who starts his
2924.42s:  stream 28 minutes late. The fact that he said 28 minutes late, right? It just it tells you you can
2929.54s:  tell he was pissed off about that. And the fact that he's looking at a stream with a dude that's
2935.46s:  dressed up like this that is more money than he will ever have.
2942.34s:  That's got to be infuriating. You got to. Oh, my God.
2948.58s:  It's got to be so maddening. You're like, I have to do news on this guy that his band-aids on his
2957.22s:  shirt. They're literally band-aids on the fucking t-shirt. Oh, God. What did I actually didn't
2969.78s:  remember that Andrew left was part of this? What did, um, is there a thing? Is Andrew left in
2976.66s:  there? Because I want to I want to take a look at that.
2986.42s:  We had a switch to stand in. Man, that's. Andrew left goes up. Sitra was manipulating.
3003.54s:  But did they, um, did he talk? I was curious if they if Andrew left said anything during this.
3009.38s:  Oh, man. This is so funny. Roentit. He says, yeah, you've seen that it got run over on Jimmy
3018.26s:  shorts, closes positions. Then got back in and got ran over again. That sounds so so appropriate.
3024.10s:  What is the latest with that, dude? He kind of fell off the ether. Didn't he? Andrew left.
3030.26s:  Update. Here it is.
3040.10s:  Um, that is a rainman. He entered a plea of not guilty trial set for 30 set. Oh, so trials going on right now.
3054.50s:  Offwind says his trial was delayed a year. Where does it when did that happen?
3063.30s:  This looks like the latest. No, this is from 11 September.
3070.02s:  This one's from four October. I see it here. So from 5th of September. I see it here.
3086.10s:  Okay. So this is from five September. This one's from four October. Let's look at this. Let's look at
3093.70s:  these in order. So this one from five September. So this is what like a month ago.
3100.42s:  Will face trial in September 25 over allegations committing fraud.
3108.58s:  Federal judges court document Wednesday slated later this month. Yeah. Okay.
3114.98s:  Also, what's for dinner tonight? You guys think in some Mexican food, eh?
3123.94s:  I don't know.
3125.14s:  I don't know. I don't really get down with those. I have no problem with like raw fish per se.
3130.58s:  Like sushi is fine, but I don't go out of my way to get raw fish.
3154.42s:  Like if it's there and across my path, I will eat it, but I'm not going to purposely go searching
3163.38s:  for raw fish. But okay. So this says not guilty.
3173.70s:  Okay. And this has asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit by the SEC.
3184.58s:  Fails to state a claim because it neither alleges a cognizable theory of fraud nor alleged sufficient
3191.46s:  facts to support the theory alleged. I thought it was.
3206.18s:  So okay. So it still looks like it doesn't look like there is a plea deal that I see yet.
3212.90s:  This looks like it's still slated for 30 SAP. Left to pleaded not guilty far more than a decade.
3221.38s:  Problem in court. Yeah. So same overall, same language, but it looks like no, no change there as far
3226.90s:  as I can see. God, that's so good. What an epic, what an epic entry.
3233.78s:  So
3238.42s:  uh, Royntady says that's his lawyer's Hail Mary argument. He's not going to win.
3243.54s:  We don't know. Here's the problem is that there are absolutely instances where
3250.34s:  what I would consider to be like pretty slimy people who have pretty clearly done some
3254.90s:  pretty shitty things have gotten off the hook. And we saw one of those examples with like
3260.66s:  pretty damn clear evidence as far as like a normal person would look at of pump and dump
3267.46s:  in manipulation. And most of them got off. The only person that didn't got off was the one
3271.54s:  that took the plea deal in the beginning because he thought that they were fucked because he knew
3277.22s:  that they did it. So yeah, it's, it's an unfortunate reality. It's one of the good things and the
3286.02s:  bad thing simultaneously about the US legal system is that there's in general, it's not perfect.
3292.66s:  Nothing is perfect. Definitely has plenty of gaps. But in general, it gives a lot of benefit of
3299.14s:  the doubt to the person that's going through the process. So yeah, there is a, there is a reality
3307.70s:  that like if there's an issue with the way that they collected their evidence presented it,
3312.82s:  house documents, like there's a lot of things that have to be done correctly for it to get
3317.46s:  successfully all the way through. Which again, in the case of somebody like left, I couldn't possibly,
3326.58s:  that's like one of those ones where I think like, yeah, you know, do process, you know,
3332.34s:  if only we could do like do process by vote, right? Maybe we need to get, get back to,
3338.82s:  you know, just, just being able to like stone people in a town square, something if you slightly
3345.54s:  don't like them, the problem with that, problem with that is the Salem witch trials then become a
3350.58s:  thing where masses start burning people at the stake because somebody has a wart on their nose
3356.82s:  or, you know, something unfortunate like that. So, you know, you also, you kind of can't trust
3361.94s:  people either. That's the tricky part about this whole thing. So,
3367.78s:  roaring titty says either way, Keith trapped left on his livestream. How did he trap them?
3373.78s:  Again, I, I'm very confused by people thinking that anybody thought that like this guy was
3379.14s:  actively manipulating the stock price. I don't, I don't, what's the origin for that argument?
3384.34s:  I don't understand it because I, yeah, could you help me understand that?
3392.42s:  I don't really, I don't get it.
3401.06s:  I'd rather be skiing says who left. No, I just mean, because I've heard a couple people in the
3405.14s:  chat so far say that like the reason why the cat did this was to like prove he wasn't manipulating
3415.22s:  the stock price. But I'm just curious like prove to who because who thought that?
3419.94s:  And where, where do we think that somebody thought that? So I see like I don't see any connection
3426.90s:  there whatsoever. I don't understand it. Willie says it's a fine line to crawl market manipulation.
3433.78s:  Oh, sort of. I mean, market manipulation is a pretty clear definition. And like that's even
3440.50s:  what again, that's why there are cases where people kind of clearly are and they're still not guilty
3447.38s:  of it because it's not easy to prove. It's the media citadel left saying that not very
3457.94s:  little people, but who do you guys have any? I'd rather be skiing. Do you have any like news articles
3463.70s:  or do you have any? Do you have anything I can read that talks about citadel or
3470.66s:  the media, whoever the media is in this context that are saying that he's manipulating the price?
3478.74s:  I would, I would, I would, I'd really like to read that.
3486.58s:  I'd rather be seeing says they keep trying to investigate him for market manipulation,
3492.74s:  Kramer on that committee to again, you have to be so we have to be clear, right? They
3499.22s:  is very specific and they in the latest one that came out was actually an individual person
3506.82s:  that was just trying to get in his pockets. And if you recall, they rescinded the case,
3512.50s:  they what dropped it on Friday and they rescinded it on like Sunday.
3517.14s:  So, but that wasn't like they being large institutions or citadel or market makers or
3523.94s:  whoever. That was a group of people that were going to try to get into his pockets because
3528.98s:  there are pieces of shit. People suck that way. People are really shity that way.
3535.06s:  Okay, got it. H says search on Google and the first few articles have literally exactly
3540.26s:  what we're looking for. Perfect. Thank you. So for the Google search, what am I doing? I'm doing
3548.58s:  H. Do you have any like recommended search term?
3554.74s:  Citrone was on CNBC when Kitty went live and CNBC was live stream is live stream. That's
3559.14s:  hilarious. Yeah. H, what should I look for?
3567.06s:  Warren Kitty Ryan Boy, Coix Citrone, Ryan Boy Citrone. Got it. Okay, so I see the
3591.46s:  charges against him. Is this the dude that? No, I'm asking. So I'd rather be skiing up above.
3602.58s:  It said that it's the media in Citadel slash left saying that that being that roaring Kitty
3612.42s:  is manipulating the price of GME. So I'm trying to see where that where that comes from.
3621.86s:  Like what whether it was a news clip that somebody saw it because again, one of the things I see
3627.94s:  people in the community do in general and it's just it's something that it doesn't work well with
3635.38s:  my brain is like people will hear things and then they'll they'll go through those things,
3642.74s:  right? They'll just keep saying it. But without some sort of source stock, I just want to see the
3647.30s:  source stock. Okay, cool. Roryntini says they set it on the CNBC clip we were watching. You mean
3656.74s:  like the longer clip? Because what we can watch the clip, I just have to turn off the sound,
3661.06s:  I think, because I think that's how YouTube detects when something's rolling.
3670.26s:  Okay, so it's the longer version of that clip got it. Stand by, let me grab that really quick.
3674.90s:  So CNBC roaring Kitty live stream full. That's from the cats.
3683.78s:  All right, let's see if it's this one.
3695.62s:  I'll save you guys the ad.
3704.98s:  And then let's see.
3711.46s:  I'm super interested.
3714.58s:  I assume that they'll have close captions.
3732.10s:  Here we go.
3732.90s:  We'll get an update on the live stream from roaring Kitty live.
3743.54s:  Keith Gale is his real name. Dom Chu, what's been happening. Doesn't seem like a lot of news.
3748.90s:  Nonetheless, it's going on, monitoring this as you can see in the live stream right now. We're
3752.66s:  also keep a go close high on the market action. We are in the middle of what that's hilarious,
3757.62s:  by the way, I've never read a teleprompter before, but I just did what I would make fun of just
3763.14s:  about everybody for with respect to reading a teleprompter. I don't know if you guys caught that,
3769.78s:  but I was reading this right and it's moving relatively quick. And here I literally read this
3776.42s:  verbatim and we're also keep a go, which doesn't make any sense, but I was trying to read quickly
3783.38s:  enough to keep up with it for you guys. So I now have a little more compassion for those that
3789.62s:  fuck up reading a teleprompter because if that things moving that quick, I'm just trying to read the
3793.62s:  words. Okay. Close to the market action, we're in the middle of what appears to be the 13th,
3802.26s:  maybe trading halt of the session. So far, it just looks like we resumed trading again. So I think
3809.14s:  is by my count, I'll have to go back and check a lot, 13 trading haunts.
3814.90s:  Right now the volume stands currently at just around my might be a lag because things are going so
3821.70s:  quickly, 197 million shares have traded in for context over the course of the last 30 days.
3827.38s:  The average trading volume has been roughly 61 million. So saying it's very, very volatile.
3833.70s:  We have heard a lot of commentary. He did talk a little bit about the beery's drinking and what's
3838.74s:  going to happen in the NBA finals early on in the session. But now some of the maybe major,
3844.98s:  I guess development, even want to call it that he has not reiterated anything that he has expressed
3852.02s:  the overriding philosophy. If you will, that Ryan Cohen at the helm of GameStop is the person
3859.14s:  really turned this thing around reiterated some of those feelings. So this doesn't look like
3865.62s:  they're talking about him manipulating anything.
3870.82s:  This began again, 20 minutes late, down about 37%. Volume is picking up on this. We will bring you
3878.02s:  anything more. But again, right now it doesn't seem Scott, like there's anything terribly new.
3883.62s:  And nor is he talked about what that's what it ends. So yeah.
3891.54s:  So I go back to the original point though, if anybody has anything somewhere of where somebody
3899.38s:  from like Citroen left Citadel, a news agency, any of them had said that or that they're claiming
3906.98s:  that he's manipulating the stock. I just want to read it in context to be clear. I'm not,
3911.62s:  I'm not saying it argumentatively in that I don't believe that it's happened. It very well
3915.70s:  could have happened. But I want to read the context because based on the way that it's phrased
3921.22s:  in whatever the source document is, it probably has a different meaning than a lot of people are
3926.10s:  inferring. I'm guessing. So that's why I want to see it. And then I saw something about Massachusetts
3934.50s:  initiated investigations. That's all I've read from credible sources. Investigations are one thing,
3940.10s:  right? So let's see, roaring kitty investigation.
3950.42s:  So 30 June, I remember this. I was watching this stuff pretty carefully.
3956.66s:  And then for June 24, we can take a look at this one.
3964.82s:  Okay. Secretary of State investigating, roaring kitty's game stop trades.
3970.58s:  Share to screenshot Monday night, 5 million shares. Yep.
3977.86s:  It is investigating the trading practices of Brockton resident, roaring kitty.
3986.82s:  They're just talking about the stuff he's doing.
3989.30s:  Whether it would ban him regarding potential, let's read this.
4006.26s:  Sharing investigation sharing details about the investigation, saying it's too early.
4010.90s:  They also investigated when he worked at mass mutual.
4014.26s:  This latest activity, yeah, this talks about him coming back. Yeah. So there's no real details here.
4021.38s:  Let's see this.
4023.62s:  E-Trade having internal discussions about whether the band Keith Gill, who just disclosed
4027.70s:  a big position in game stop. The brokerage owned by Morgan Stanley reached a decision.
4037.06s:  E-Trade declined to comment, saying we don't publicly discuss individual activity of our clients.
4044.58s:  It's brokerage found. Yeah. So there's no real.
4051.30s:  There's no real nothing in here.
4055.54s:  So far at least.
4064.26s:  Search Keith Gill mass mutual on it.
4067.70s:  Keith Gill mass mutual.
4073.78s:  This one.
4083.54s:  This one.
4099.22s:  This one.
4104.02s:  These are same things. Okay. So let's see.
4114.18s:  Mass mutual and best in subsidy agreed to pay 4.75 million to resolve allegations by MSR.
4120.58s:  Fail to supervise its agents. Yeah. I mean, this is.
4126.26s:  This is fine.
4134.58s:  Yeah. This is no problem.
4137.14s:  This is the reason why this is no problem is because when he was working there,
4142.26s:  he I'm sure he had very strict rules, compliance rules about what he could or couldn't do.
4150.18s:  Fail to detect the activities of Keith Gill, who should have been reporting them, which is correct.
4157.14s:  Inadequately supervised other agents, sure.
4163.62s:  Yeah. So they they had a sloppy admin process.
4177.14s:  Yeah.
4182.90s:  Titi says they had foreign employees who were acting but not registered. Yeah.
4187.06s:  I saw that up here.
4189.22s:  They're failing to register. So yeah. So this again, this isn't manipulation or anything.
4196.58s:  This is his company got fined as they should have because they his company.
4204.90s:  Like Keith Gill shouldn't have done this while he was working there.
4209.78s:  It's definitely against compliance.
4212.58s:  And then with that aside, his company should have detected it earlier to shut it down.
4218.82s:  Or fire him.
4220.58s:  And that didn't happen. So then because it came to light in such a public manner,
4225.38s:  then obviously they they figured it all out.
4230.26s:  So yeah, there's nothing wrong. Titi, I don't think there's anything in here that.
4236.90s:  Yeah, none of this surprised me at all. This this looks completely correct.
4243.22s:  Lack of oversight. So we already read that. What's this one?
4249.30s:  Still probing Gill's activities around the Reddit rally.
4259.06s:  Yeah.
4260.90s:  Or Titi says you're asking what we're talking about with the investigation.
4264.18s:  No, I was asking.
4267.86s:  I was just asking if anybody has any sources, direct sources of any of these entities alleging
4274.74s:  that he is manipulating price. That's that's what I was asking for.
4281.62s:  The investigations themselves like that's not even an investigation into Roryne Kitty.
4285.78s:  That's an investigation into mass mutual because of the tie that Roryne Kitty had. But Roryne Kitty
4292.90s:  or Keith Gill in that sense. It wasn't even about him. That was about mass mutual.
4297.62s:  Let's see. When hedge funds that shorted a game stop were forced to buy it any price.
4309.62s:  Fuck them. Fuck them. See, this makes me so angry that these people were saved.
4321.70s:  That's the problem with bailouts is a lot of times a bailout has a specific purpose for the
4328.50s:  greater good, which I understand in the context of game stop not allowing entire financial
4334.02s:  collapse is smart. But I really, really hate that these guys get saved in the middle of it.
4343.94s:  Roryne City says, so Tron research founded by left did accuse Keith Gill of mark of manipulation
4354.18s:  June 2024. I saw that article titled Roryne Kitty's three energy and me position sparks
4358.90s:  mark of manipulation claims. Yeah. So that one that you're talking about. I remember reading that
4365.62s:  one and left is in he's in an interesting spot here. Andrew left. Roryne Kitty manipulation.
4386.58s:  I'm trying to find the original
4396.02s:  here we go. Does I remember reading like the actual thing that he put out? I forgot what it was.
4404.90s:  This one. I think this is what you are citing. Roryne Titty will take a look at that one too.
4414.74s:  So much as wrong said left. Monday was totally different. He puts his monster position no thesis,
4427.46s:  no short term options. I personally do not believe this is own personal money.
4433.94s:  Size of the trade was 150. Who's fucking money does he think it is? Who the fuck is going to give him
4440.02s:  150 million dollars here? Let me try my business pitch for you guys really quick. Let me know if
4445.54s:  you would give me the money. Hey guys, I just want to grab a quick 150 mill from you so that I can
4451.54s:  buy options that expire in a month. Is that cool? Can I grab those really quick? Just just 150
4459.06s:  mill. Oh yeah, if they expire out of the money, the money's completely gone. Yeah, that's a thing.
4465.46s:  I'm not really worried about that, but that is what would happen. Yeah, see, I guess it works great.
4471.70s:  So Roryne Titty says he was paranoid of Kitty. I think he thought it was this thing and then he
4477.54s:  his ass. Yeah, exactly. I think that left was frustrated that Roryne Kitty could, again,
4485.86s:  influence the price enough that it would fuck his positions. I absolutely think that for sure.
4495.22s:  I'm assuming he made 200 million first time. I just don't think it's his money. There should be
4502.42s:  some form of disclosure. If it's not, you know, that he went out there to really shake this world.
4509.62s:  I don't think there's anything GameStop is going to say in the next two weeks. What he's doing now
4513.54s:  is trying to take advantage of the retail traders, the same people that he's supposed to represent
4516.98s:  three and a half years ago. Yeah, like this is him just giving him really negative attributions because
4521.38s:  he's a fucking hater. Whenever someone shorts GameStop have to do it. Cauchy, it's
4527.38s:  sleigh. It's different this time. I think if given the opportunity to short the stock was at
4535.62s:  40 this morning, it's great. I don't recommend people short stocks. I don't think I think they
4543.06s:  won't have any patience. I remember reading an article by him where he was saying that like,
4552.66s:  he was saying some shit like it feels like it's different this time that he's doing something
4559.78s:  different or whatever. Yeah, so where's the actual post though? The Trone research prominent
4572.74s:  short criticized Gil or alleged manipulation in Diego appearing more like manipulation without
4581.14s:  a solid thesis. That's what it was. That's right. It was an ex post. I totally forgot about that.
4588.58s:  Totally forgot about that. I thought it was like an email thing that he sent out. I forgot.
4593.22s:  Significant near term options appearing more like manipulation without a solid thesis. Yeah.
4607.38s:  Backed by a larger entity. I'm also so curious like, did he ever justify whatever this means?
4615.14s:  Like, backed by a lot like what entity? I don't understand that part at all.
4623.54s:  Off Putin says, Gil walked him in the casino and put 68 million on black and one left his
4630.82s:  jealous. I mean, it definitely does seem like part of that. I absolutely think that.
4638.02s:  So Tron just rambled about unsubstantiated claims says,
4641.54s:  ball, I completely agree. Yeah. I mean, this is all that's I couldn't agree more.
4646.26s:  Like, I think this is all madness, right? To suggest something like this, we think someone is
4651.86s:  backing Gil. There's no way he made this size trade alone. Like, who? Who?
4660.74s:  Like could again, like objectively, could there be somebody backing him? Sure. Of course,
4665.86s:  there could be. But there's no evidence of it anywhere so far. So for him to say this like,
4673.86s:  as decisively as that is fucking crazy, it makes no sense. It's I completely agree with you guys
4679.78s:  that this is him just trying to be sour. And I think that he's trying to put a negative spin on him
4687.54s:  so that people start decoupling because I think left acknowledges that the cat can move the stock.
4694.90s:  He doesn't want the cat to move the stock because it hurts him. So I think he's trying to break apart
4701.06s:  the cat's ability to move the stock by disparaging the cat so that his thinking is that the people that
4708.10s:  follow the cat will read this and then be enlightened and then stop following the cat,
4714.82s:  which would then decrease how much the stock can move. Because again, like the cat himself,
4720.34s:  he can move the stock to a degree, but not again, like impacting the stock is not like long term
4726.90s:  in nature. It's shorter term. But one of the reasons why we're in Kitty can impact the stock so
4734.02s:  significantly is because it's not just him. It's lots of people moving with him. So I think he
4741.70s:  sees this and he's trying to break that apart. Jordan says didn't Gil say in the live note, yeah,
4748.58s:  he said that as well. He said that it's his money. He said that it's his only account. He did say
4752.74s:  that. It's his only position. He said it's his only position. So yeah, this is just fucking bullshit to
4762.26s:  me. So Tron was the latest short seller to announce a short position that they are short GME again.
4775.94s:  They lost over a hundred million shorting GME. That's hilarious.
4780.42s:  Fuck him. For someone who's short GME, you don't pay much attention to your investment.
4788.10s:  V was buying in the money calls late April, May, 100K at a time. Those trades were worth over 10
4795.62s:  million each on May 13th and 14th. Yeah, it's awesome.
4805.30s:  You know, it's funny. We had the very same questions about your short positions in which they
4809.22s:  were reported at over 240% before the squeeze. So lost. Fucking crazy.
4823.06s:  So oh yeah, here. Sood for securities fraud. Yeah, who did this?
4829.22s:  This guy. This guy did it.
4847.38s:  So this dude.
4859.70s:  And I remember it because they filed it and they rescinded it as fast as they filed it. It was wild.
4868.26s:  I want to look at the dates. So that's what June 28th.
4873.86s:  June 28th. Yeah, they filed it on like the 28th and they pulled it back. I want to say like
4878.34s:  the 30th. I don't even think it made it through the weekend, which is classic. Well, he says it
4885.30s:  shouldn't be possible to short over 100% completely agree. I want 100% agree. It doesn't make any
4890.58s:  sense. I have no like how can you how can you short more than exists? Like that's
4898.82s:  Yes. Yeah, it's complete bullshit. It's absolute absolute bullshit. Dislike that fully.
4909.14s:  But yeah, this dude. I thought the timing of this was generally interesting.
4921.30s:  Oh yeah, we have to update the map. I have to hop off in a minute. But before we go,
4925.14s:  we got to see if we have any new ads to our map. And so then we have to figure out for the
4935.06s:  for the next video on Saturday. One of the things that I want to do is like pick one of the specific
4943.38s:  ideas or themes and I want to analyze it in depth. So is there can you guys list out for me?
4951.54s:  A couple of could you list out a couple of like the primary theories around what's going on?
4960.26s:  And then I'll put it up to a vote to see which one we should go through in depth next week.
4965.62s:  I want to try to go through like all the different materials and understand how people are coming
4970.42s:  up with the theories more in depth. And then in the meantime, do we have any updates to our map?
4977.46s:  We have all the US. We have someone in Mexico, which is good. We have South America. We still
4982.82s:  have no Africans would be good to get one of those. The Madagascarian theories about what?
4989.22s:  There's like a ton of different lore and just theories about either the cat or the movement of
4996.66s:  GameStop. And I want to start that's where I want to pivot to next. Okay, got it. Yeah, so let me try
5005.30s:  to reframe the question. So from my understanding in the GameStop community, there are different theories
5014.10s:  that are designed to try to explain what's going on. And to it seems in general to forecast
5022.26s:  when something is likely to occur again and why I would love to take a look at any of those
5029.46s:  primary theories. So one of them that I know about is like Biggie's theory. I don't know anything
5034.82s:  about it realistically. I don't remember anything about it, but I remember that Newton and I
5039.46s:  on our live stream had talked about that. I don't know if there are others similar to that. If not,
5046.18s:  we can just I can look up that one and see what we can learn because what I want to do is see what
5051.94s:  they're suggesting. And then I want to align it against the chart to see what like what has
5060.82s:  actually been done. So if there's like a Reddit post that talks about the theory or if there's a
5066.74s:  video that talks about the theory, I'd love to grab that stuff so that we can pick one and then
5074.90s:  take a take a good look at. Jack says Mo as tomorrow. Now that is a belief. And that one is a I
5083.94s:  love that one. That's hilarious. I absolutely loved it. I absolutely love that. So yeah, in you
5091.38s:  can you guys can like throw it in the discord. You guys can throw it in a YouTube comment or
5096.58s:  something whatever. But that's what I want to do for the next one is like actually go through the
5100.90s:  Superstalk and GameStop Reddit and see what kind of theories exist so that we can explore them
5109.30s:  a little bit more. So that's the game plan for next Saturday and for everybody's awareness.
5118.02s:  I have it in the newsletter for this coming week, but the production or the content schedule is
5124.18s:  going to be a little bit different. So I'm doing the outlier pro, the Patreon live stream,
5130.42s:  that'll be Sunday and Wednesday. Then there will be YouTube Lives Monday and Friday. And then
5137.54s:  Tuesday and Thursday, they're kind of ad hoc. Like if something's going on, then sure, if not,
5144.26s:  then no. And the reason why I do that is because I take commitments very seriously. So for the last
5151.54s:  month, I told you guys I was going to live stream every day, which I did within reason. I think I
5155.86s:  missed a couple because of the travel, but otherwise I didn't miss anything. And so I still will
5160.74s:  probably live stream most days because I enjoyed a lot, but I am committing to those days specifically.
5168.02s:  And then we'll kind of see what happens as the week's go out. Then I'm still going to do the Saturday
5172.98s:  live streams for GameStop because I still feel like there's a little bit more that I still need to
5177.54s:  dig into. So yeah, that's the game plan. All right, gang, if you guys need anything, let me know.
5184.98s:  Be an ape, be an outlier or be an outlier ape. And I will catch you guys all around. Enjoy your weekend.
