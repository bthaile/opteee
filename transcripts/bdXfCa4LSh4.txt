0.00s: If you already have a bunch of money, this video is not for you.
2.24s: This video is for people like myself who grew up poor and didn't learn this from anybody.
7.88s: There was nobody to teach it to me.
9.60s: So this is stuff that I've learned over the last decade and a half of focusing on finance
14.58s: incredibly hard after being introduced to the concept of investing by a high school
19.88s: teacher. If it wasn't for that dude, my path would have been completely different.
24.18s: And I want to be abundantly clear.
25.98s: I really am nobody special.
27.32s: I'm not the smartest guy in the group, not the dumbest guy in the group, very average across
30.88s: the board.
31.88s: So the main goal for this video is to walk you through the exact roadmap I used to become
37.96s: a millionaire in my late 20s.
40.16s: And it sounds kind of crazy.
41.52s: But once you start looking at some of this stuff in a different way, you realize that it's
45.60s: quite possible.
46.60s: And no, it's not being anything like this guy.
48.80s: I don't know anything about this.
49.80s: I literally just looked up on Google finance guru jet.
53.84s: And this is what pops up.
55.00s: But we have a dude that I guess was a finance influencer that went bankrupt.
58.20s: It's none of this.
59.20s: You're not going to see me hopping on fake jets or I guess they have this thing in L.A.
62.84s: Where you just go take pictures on a fake jet stage, which is also fascinating.
67.96s: You're wasting money.
69.04s: It's more so actually about this.
71.32s: How I went from walking through metal detectors every day to go to high school, working around
77.24s: lots of different people with different motivations in their life, a lot of them gang banging
81.92s: and dealing drugs.
83.24s: And I decided I didn't want to do that, but I didn't know what to do.
87.32s: So I was working a lot of different odd jobs as a young dude in high school, junior high
91.20s: school, but then teacher introduced me to investing.
94.24s: And that introduction sent me down a completely different path.
98.68s: It's how when we were recently in Alaska, we got to do a last minute decision to rent
103.48s: a private helicopter and go fly around.
105.88s: Go check out glaciers.
106.96s: How we get to go travel around Norway.
108.92s: So I get to have fun cars and build them because no, I'm not just by cool looking cars
114.40s: because I think people will like me.
115.96s: Nobody will like me anyways.
116.96s: It's just because I like cars.
117.96s: I like to work on them.
118.96s: I like to go diving.
119.96s: I like to go to Africa.
120.96s: I like to experience life.
122.48s: So I went from a place where most people will never do this to being able to do this and
127.24s: it came down to literally these concepts.
130.00s: I'm about to share with you.
131.00s: Now, I want to be super clear.
132.24s: I'm actually not going to talk about trading at all in this video.
135.72s: So your mileage may vary.
137.40s: What that means is through my application of the trading skill set, I was able to rapidly
142.24s: accelerate my time frame.
143.60s: The reality is trading is not for a lot of people.
146.52s: So this overall base case is going to talk about a generally applicable approach for
152.60s: most people that's feasible, not banking on somebody being good at trading or maybe
158.08s: being able to land this really high paying job.
160.32s: It's a little bit more of a middle ground.
161.84s: So let's take a look at this together.
163.56s: The first thing I want to start with, what are the probabilities here?
166.48s: You most of you know from my channel.
168.76s: I am a statistics minded person and I want to know the probabilities of things.
172.92s: So if we take a look across the US, there's about 9.2% millionaires.
177.44s: That's not high, but that's not a bismillial low.
179.92s: We're not talking sub 2%.
181.60s: We're talking about a difficult benchmark to hit, but this isn't insanely difficult.
187.32s: Because if you imagine the way most people go through their lives, they clearly will probably
191.20s: not land anywhere near this because they're too busy using self-wealth depletion habits
197.20s: to deplete their wealth as compared to build it.
199.44s: So no shock here.
200.44s: Then we also see that the average age of a millionaire is 61.
204.76s: And if we look at the average retirement age, it's later in this same period of time,
210.56s: 60s.
211.56s: So that doesn't sound super great to me because the idea is to try and create this wealth
216.52s: earlier so that you have more freedom.
218.72s: You have more autonomy.
219.96s: But I try to tell people is that money in no way will make you happy.
223.32s: But if you were happy before money, money is a massive accelerator.
227.96s: It is just a huge value ad.
231.20s: So if you're looking at becoming a millionaire thinking making a bunch of money, then you'll
235.16s: become happy.
236.16s: You won't.
237.16s: It's not how it works.
238.16s: However, what I try to remind people is that it's an amplifier.
240.76s: So we want to try to get to this sooner.
243.20s: How do we do it?
244.20s: This is it.
245.20s: This literally is it.
246.20s: We're going through 13 ancillary details on the right hand side in a second, but it boils
251.04s: down to executing this.
253.16s: So on the left hand side, you see three wealth levers.
256.20s: We have good savings rate.
257.68s: We have investing and we have income.
260.08s: Why do we start with this?
262.24s: Well, the reason why we start with savings is because you need something to invest, right?
267.08s: So you can't just save your way to wealth.
271.32s: Eric, what do you mean?
272.32s: That's crazy.
273.32s: You're supposed to save.
274.32s: Of course, you're supposed to save.
275.32s: But let me show you an example is to why you cannot save your way to wealth.
279.84s: If we take a look at this compound growth calculator over here, you'll notice a few things.
283.88s: I'll slide it over a little bit more.
285.12s: You'll notice a few things.
286.28s: The first thing is if we look at $5,000 and we look at over a 30 year time frame, I'm
291.48s: going to turn this rate of return down to zero.
294.24s: And I'm going to say that we're really good savers.
296.76s: We're going to save $500 a month on average.
299.92s: In 30 years, you have $185,000.
304.08s: You did a good job saving.
305.52s: It doesn't matter because you need your money to work for you.
310.24s: You need this compounding clock to start.
313.88s: So let's look at alternate scenarios.
315.52s: Same thing, starting 5 grand, saving $500 a month, 30 year time frame.
319.80s: Instead, let's add a generally average market return of 10%.
324.00s: What happens?
325.00s: Whoa, now you're a millionaire.
326.68s: This right here is what made you a millionaire versus a sub 200,000 air.
332.24s: There is no saving your way to wealth.
335.00s: You have to invest.
336.64s: Full stop.
337.64s: Period.
338.64s: You have to invest.
339.64s: Okay, let's talk about some of these friction points with respect to investing.
343.76s: We already know we can't save our way to wealth.
345.88s: We need to save super aggressively.
348.32s: We know that we need to invest and we know that income is going to be an important point
353.00s: simply because it's here.
354.00s: We haven't talked about it yet, but we will.
355.48s: But let's talk about this idea of savings rate and starting to invest.
358.64s: The very first thing, once we understand how this process works, is to just start.
365.12s: Don't wait until you have enough.
367.12s: Don't wait until it's convenient.
369.12s: Don't wait until it's a good time.
371.00s: There's all these different reasons to delay beginning this process.
374.48s: And the only thing this does is delay the outcome.
378.00s: Just start.
379.00s: You have 25 bucks.
380.00s: Start there.
381.00s: Start adding $25 to your investing account monthly, no matter what.
383.36s: Just do it every single month into perpetuity.
385.44s: It's a starting point.
386.44s: Our focusing on is actually building a habit.
389.44s: Once the habit is built and you see the value, it becomes easier to embrace delayed gratification
396.24s: and then instead of spending that $100 to go out with your friends, you think, okay,
400.08s: well, I don't have to go out, you know, three times this week.
402.68s: I can go out twice with my friends this week.
405.12s: I can balance trade offs.
407.52s: Go out twice, sacrifice the third, save the money that I would have spent on the third
411.64s: and feed this machine.
413.96s: That's the entire idea in the beginning.
416.20s: But once we start, we don't stop.
418.32s: We have a bad month.
419.32s: Doesn't matter.
420.32s: You still put in your minimum.
421.32s: 25 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever you define, compliance is non-negotiable.
425.72s: Has to happen.
426.72s: Then we have this idea of building a vision.
429.04s: Why does building a vision matter?
430.80s: Because it helps us contextualize the trade offs that we're going to have to make.
436.40s: So when we think about this idea of trying to expand our income, one of the biggest errors
443.08s: people make is if you're making a good salary, you're making $100,000 a year, whatever it
447.12s: is, and you're saving.
448.80s: And then you get a pay bump, right?
449.80s: Now you're making $120,000 a year.
451.72s: You did a good job.
452.72s: You got a great pay bump.
453.72s: The problem is most people spend that $20,000.
456.08s: They expand their lifestyle to fit their new income level.
459.92s: Yes, what we just wasted, perfectly good money that could have been put into our savings
464.76s: rate to accelerate this clock from 30 years.
468.24s: We can cut this way down if we're smart.
472.08s: So let's take a look.
473.24s: If instead we do this $500 a month, let's take a look if we do $750 a month on average.
478.36s: 30 years, you have a million dollars at the $500 bucks.
481.64s: At $750, you have $1.6 million.
485.84s: So now instead of hitting that millionaire threshold in year 30, you actually cross it
490.60s: in year 26.
492.04s: You've cut four years off of this timeline by saving an additional $250 per month.
497.16s: This just accelerates more and more from there.
500.08s: The only way this continues to accelerate is that if you establish a lifestyle that you're
504.16s: comfortable with and then as you find ways to make more money, you do not grow your lifestyle.
509.24s: You keep your lifestyle the same and you funnel this new gap here into your investing account.
514.64s: That's it.
515.64s: That's how this clock goes further and further to the left.
518.12s: And if we take a look, that is the entire premise here behind slow as fast because a lot
523.64s: of people really struggle to see the utility of saving $100 a month.
527.12s: It can be very difficult to actually picture how impactful saving just $100 a month can
532.72s: be.
533.72s: So then you forego doing it and you do it again and again and again.
536.44s: The problem is that money builds over time.
540.44s: Small amounts of money still compound.
542.44s: I just showed you a scenario where if you saved an extra $250 a month, you essentially add
546.84s: $600,000 into your net worth picture at the end of this timeframe.
551.16s: So you have to appreciate the small steps because they matter.
555.16s: So we have savings rate build a super effective savings rate and maintain it.
560.24s: Maintain your lifestyle, start investing right away, dollar cost average every single month.
564.80s: Don't skip a month.
565.80s: I have a blog post that I'll link to below that walks through this.
569.40s: How to start investing if you know nothing.
571.12s: I'll throw a link to that below.
572.32s: You can read through it.
573.32s: It's literally step by step.
574.32s: It'll get you started in less than 30 minutes.
576.56s: Then expand your income.
578.04s: You have to make some decisions.
579.28s: Are you working at a high earning career field?
582.04s: We're working for the next promotion.
583.40s: Make sense.
584.44s: Working with industry.
585.44s: Maybe you actually don't get comfortable at your current job because it's comfortable
589.68s: cushy.
590.68s: You know what to do.
591.68s: It's a routine.
592.68s: And maybe you're actually aggressively moving every two to three years because guess
594.84s: what?
595.84s: If you work at a place and they give you a standard three 5% pay increase, that doesn't
599.12s: really matter that much.
600.24s: Especially if you look at people who jump jobs every two to three years, they tend to
603.80s: get a 10% plus pay increase.
606.20s: Easy.
607.20s: Some of them can be 25% plus.
608.60s: So there's no catching up with that staying at the same place.
611.00s: You have to be really strategic or you can do like I did.
613.92s: Which is start hustling.
615.80s: When I was in high school, I used to split wood for a guy that I hunted on his property.
620.36s: I used to move shale for him.
621.68s: I used to sell Christmas trees.
623.00s: I used to take people's trash out literally.
624.76s: I used to shovel people's walkways and their driveways when it's snowing.
628.84s: Then in college, I got into flipping cars.
631.60s: I would buy broken cars, fix them, sell them, same thing with motorcycles.
635.32s: I kept doing that all the way through my time in the Marine Corps.
637.84s: You have to get scrappy.
638.84s: But the idea is if you build a vision that then you truly can see yourself what life would
644.84s: look like with this amount of money, it starts to make you want to save more money.
649.84s: So then it's not 30 years.
651.68s: So that if you start taking these slow steps early, this will speed things up massively.
658.08s: So even though it is delayed gratification, we're talking about multi-year periods, the
662.40s: more you delay gratification, the faster you end up getting to the spot you want to be.
667.68s: This is exactly how you become a millionaire.
670.28s: No, there's no easy hacks.
671.92s: It's building a plan and executing on it without fail.
675.80s: Be an outlier.
