0.88s: what's up to all the outliers Eric here
2.76s: and I legitimately have a great video
4.64s: for you on managing deep in the money
7.32s: short puts this is what I do this is my
10.48s: bread and butter and it is really the
13.24s: more interesting part of trading to me
15.28s: obviously it's nice to put on a trade
16.92s: and for it to make money no drama there
19.20s: but this is where trading really happens
23.00s: not just one more directionally right
24.52s: right out of the gate so let's take a
26.56s: look at the trade I'm going to show you
27.96s: a chart for some context first and then
30.08s: I will give you the details of the trade
31.64s: itself this is where I entered the trade
34.60s: this is iwm this is part of my core
38.32s: portfolio I bring that up because
40.40s: there's very different ways that I
41.72s: approach my core portfolio compared to
43.80s: my speculative portfolio it's the same
46.08s: portfolio it's just different
47.80s: allocations and in this case I am
50.08s: trading the covered strangle now when I
53.68s: look at this first trade that we got on
55.88s: iwm was trading around 210 and then this
58.92s: is where the first roll occurred on the
62.16s: 28th of April and then here we are down
65.12s: here from here to here uh to about 175
69.76s: 176 is about a 16% move so we've
72.72s: sustained a meaningful move against us
74.88s: in the position directionally we have
76.60s: been incorrect completely now as I look
80.32s: at this from a technical standpoint I
82.60s: definitely perceive more risk to the
85.24s: downside than upside potential that's an
88.28s: important undertone as I make further
91.20s: decisions about how I want to manage
93.12s: this trade I also see a couple levels of
96.48s: interest to me like this one 189 this
99.80s: 182 um as potential resistance we're
103.20s: still stairs stepping down with lower
106.60s: highs which is not good overall I
109.96s: perceive more downside than upside I say
112.60s: all of that because it will paint the
114.36s: rest of the picture of the portfolio and
118.00s: the strategy that we're deploying now as
120.56s: I said we're looking at iwm the plan is
122.64s: the coverage triangle a favorite of mine
125.64s: when I look at the series of Trades I'm
128.36s: going to walk through my thought process
130.32s: because I haven't made a decision yet
132.88s: and that's part of the reason why I'm
134.20s: doing this video today is 19th of May
137.40s: and I haven't made a choice yet but it's
139.32s: coming up on time to do something
141.40s: because extrinsic value is dwindling
143.44s: down very quickly so that first trade on
146.48s: 29 March I sold to open six of the 202
149.52s: puts at 338 the reason why I arrive at 6
153.84s: or 8 or 15 or 25 it's all based on how I
158.40s: want to use my portfolio what I want my
160.28s: utilization to be how much money I'm
162.00s: trying to make how much risk do I have
164.60s: out in my speculative portfolio
166.68s: allocation compared to my core all of
169.48s: those things mix into it the general
172.08s: undertone here is conservative I have
174.96s: been no more than 20% invested across my
177.88s: entire portfolio so far this year here
180.28s: and it's because I do not trust the
182.00s: markets this is one of the primary ways
184.88s: that I manage risk is via sizing and
188.68s: what I offer to the market in my
191.80s: allocations so that is the general
194.60s: background behind the size of the trade
196.88s: now if you're interested in how I
199.20s: approach my coverage strangles in
201.08s: general how I analyze how I manage them
204.48s: uh via different adjustments all that
206.12s: stuff I will link to a video up here for
208.08s: you to check out cuz I'm not going to go
209.60s: that far into detail on those things
211.64s: this is going to be more of a practical
213.48s: managing a trade that's on right now
215.48s: Vice how I tend to do things um broadly
219.40s: okay so moving on to the first roll on
222.80s: the 28th of April when iwm was trading
225.16s: around 189 so that represents about an
227.56s: 11% down move from where I entered to my
230.68s: first roll and I bought to close those
233.48s: 202 puts at
235.40s: 1260 and then I sold to open six of the
238.56s: 17 June 200 puts at 1330 now a couple
242.16s: things happens here happen here the
244.28s: first one is I was able to reduce my
247.28s: basis slightly from 202 to 200 so that's
251.84s: a 1% reduction in my basis I also kept
255.96s: size the same so what I mean by that is
258.80s: I kept a six lot to a six lot one of my
261.28s: favorite ways to manage these kind of
263.48s: Trades especially in a down move is to
265.36s: slowly scale into the trade towards my
268.16s: full allocation which Tech technically
270.40s: is up to 100% of my portfolio is what I
272.92s: would allow for this style of trade um
276.08s: we're not quite there cuz I have other
277.36s: positions on and I'm not looking to
278.80s: scale in quite that aggressively but
280.84s: just to give you some general context so
283.64s: what's happened thus far is I collected
286.20s: that $3.38 in credit then I realized a
290.16s: loss when I bought to close them and
292.52s: then I opened up a new trade with 1330
295.36s: in overall credit so I have a total
298.72s: unrealized real ized net p&l of 2448
302.28s: this includes the trade that's open
303.64s: right now the realized p&l is down $
308.48s: 5,532 that's what I realized in loss on
311.84s: this trade right here now the return on
315.84s: Capital invested capital for the trade
318.16s: as it sits with the net p&l is 2.04% and
322.20s: annualized it's at
323.68s: 14.6% I bring that up because on an
325.96s: annual return this still isn't bad I'm
327.76s: not worried about this trade and this
329.80s: again continues to shape and and form
331.60s: how I choose to manage the position so
334.36s: this is the main set of choices I have
337.16s: ahead of me do I want to try to roll out
340.36s: and down or just roll out do I want to
343.56s: take shares in and actually turn it into
345.60s: the covered strangle by taking
347.72s: assignment and then selling covered
349.20s: calls or do I want to add risk meaning
352.88s: increase total size so that I can make
355.60s: more aggressive adjustment on these puts
359.84s: now I will give you the cliffnotes
361.88s: version I am not interested in just
365.36s: rolling out that doesn't benefit me too
368.44s: much and I'll show you why if I pull up
371.60s: the current options chain and we take a
374.32s: look at where my deep in the money puts
377.60s: are which is they're an 80 Delta right
379.64s: now they're they have about 13 cents
382.40s: 12.5 cents of extrinsic value so once
385.68s: this gets below a dime it is time to do
388.16s: something because early assignment
389.76s: becomes increasingly more probable even
392.40s: though there's 22 days left to go it's
394.72s: unlikely if it's right around a dime but
397.08s: I don't want to deal with it if it
398.32s: starts you know trading for 4 cents 5
400.40s: cents and there's just not that much
401.92s: money left to pull out of it so in this
404.96s: instance I'm going to look and say okay
407.44s: the midpoint on this you know
409.60s: theoretical value somewhere
413.16s: 2377 something like or sorry 2387
416.56s: something like that and I'm going to
418.64s: look to see what I could get if I rolled
421.24s: out in time so first I'll take a look at
423.24s: going to these 42 days to expiration
425.92s: same strike those are trading for 2420
429.60s: something like that and that doesn't
432.84s: give me a lot of money on that roll in
434.80s: terms of the credit that I would
436.16s: ultimately receive so that I'm not super
439.36s: interested in the next choice would be
441.80s: to take assignment and then sell covered
443.64s: calls so let's see what I could sell at
446.12s: my basis around 200 if I go out those
449.12s: same 42 days I wouldn't want to sell it
450.96s: right at 200 I want to go a little bit
452.60s: further out of the money to enable
454.72s: upside potential it's a way that I
457.76s: compensate for the cost to carry and
460.84s: those are only give me 40 something
462.32s: cents I'm not super stoked on that
465.00s: either so I'm narrowing down based on
468.12s: what I'm seeing in the market by these
470.36s: decisions I'm not stoked about rolling
472.40s: out just rolling out I'm not stoked
475.24s: about taking on shares and selling
477.12s: covered calls so that leads me to out
479.64s: and down or increasing size if I can
482.68s: roll out and down I would but if I take
485.32s: a look at these 42 days to expiration
487.76s: the 200 puts I cannot collect enough
491.12s: credit in order to have a net credit on
494.36s: the roll again I would only be able to
496.20s: get 2420 something like that if that's
499.80s: at the 200 if I go to the 199s to roll
502.56s: it down by one point then I'm only
505.88s: getting
507.36s: 2330 something like that which again is
510.52s: not enough 2330 is not enough to give me
513.88s: a net credit on this so that leads to a
518.48s: couple other choices I could look maybe
520.76s: go a little further out in time maybe I
522.72s: go to these 15 July 57 days to
526.32s: expiration and then I check out those
528.20s: 199s these are going for it looks like
534.68s: 23
536.40s: 69 right around there 2369
539.88s: and then again if I pop back see where
542.32s: we're at 2369 simply is not enough and
546.40s: that's even if I go out 50s something
548.56s: days so then just to see where I would
550.76s: have to go in order to get a credit and
553.24s: be able to roll down I could go 92 days
555.72s: out I could look at these 199s or I
557.80s: could even look at these 198s so it's a
559.96s: viable choice if I wanted to go 92 days
562.36s: out not super inclined to do that right
564.64s: now if I look at this list what I would
567.32s: be most inclined to do is increased size
570.60s: I wouldn't completely discount rolling
573.64s: out after I look at the choices
575.32s: available to me again I didn't look at
576.96s: this before I did the video with you
578.36s: guys so I was looking at it as I as I
580.56s: went I'm not stoked on out but I am
583.80s: right now favoring increasing size
586.64s: because as I look at some size choices I
590.16s: could potentially add maybe two
592.92s: contracts still keep it very very small
595.08s: take it from a six to an eight lot My
597.44s: overall allocation would be very small
599.68s: but what that would allow me to do is
601.48s: probably go from these 200s down to
603.76s: these 195s and that starts to become
606.68s: more meaningful because again if we do
609.44s: tip and continue this bare Market I'm
612.04s: gearing up for a near 300 day duration
615.52s: down move so by continuing to slide into
619.80s: the trade via size but reducing my basis
623.00s: as such it gives me the most flexibility
625.72s: for when I ultimately do decide to take
628.16s: assignment I will will take assignment
630.16s: on a size that I'm comfortable with and
632.68s: be able to sell short calls at something
636.52s: that makes a little more sense because
637.88s: again if I go to these 57 days out let's
640.60s: take a look at these 195s I'm now
642.32s: collecting $160 that's pretty healthy
645.32s: for something that's 57 days out at of
647.84s: 195 this is a low Delta it's an 18 Delta
651.04s: so I could even again go a little
652.76s: further above that to give me some
654.16s: upside potential and still collect a
656.24s: meaningful amount of credit that it
657.84s: starts to be worthwhile or even sell the
659.96s: covered calls at a ratio which is a
662.40s: favorite of mine so if let's say I take
665.12s: this to an eight lot and I end up
668.04s: getting assigned 800 shares at 195 let's
670.84s: just say everything cedus parabus
672.64s: everything else is the same and we're
674.32s: looking at it right now in that same
676.00s: scenario I could then sell six of these
679.04s: 198 calls that still gives me $3 $3
682.80s: subside potential I'm still collecting
684.84s: 600 something bucks for 15 Delta short
687.60s: calls but I'm still not in the upside I
689.96s: have 200 uncap shares one of my favorite
692.16s: approaches so right now as I write this
695.40s: make this video that is what I'm leaning
697.84s: towards probably increasing size very
700.64s: very slightly and increasing the overall
703.28s: allocation into the trade so that I can
705.76s: take in a bigger credit move Five Points
708.36s: down which decreases My overall risk
710.72s: footprint because the total to cash
712.72s: secure will decrease and then it gives
715.16s: me a little more room um to continue
717.48s: scaling in if the market doesn't
719.36s: accommodate me which I honestly don't
721.16s: think it will at this point but I am
723.92s: comfortable starting to scale into this
725.76s: trade a little bit because I I have
727.64s: plenty of capital I could put into this
729.80s: if I need to so that's what I'm thinking
732.08s: right now again just making a video as
734.04s: I'm thinking about managing this trade
736.48s: if you have any questions let me know
738.04s: this fun conversation I haven't made a
739.84s: decision yet I will do an update video
742.08s: when I make the trade probably tomorrow
743.72s: the next day uh next day being Monday um
746.76s: you know depending on where those puts
748.52s: move but I'm definitely going to wait
750.08s: for them to go below a dime just so that
752.44s: I can squeak out as much time as
754.64s: possible to get a better feel for what
756.88s: the Market's actually doing are we
759.96s: starting to see a little bit maybe if we
762.64s: start seeing some support here oh those
765.24s: are fibs sorry I didn't mean to put
766.60s: those in there if we start seeing a
768.72s: little bit of support at these levels I
770.88s: might feel a little bit differently as
772.96s: in if we're starting to base somewhere
775.40s: in here at
776.44s: 175 and then we start trading between
779.24s: range here and maybe bouncing up out of
781.20s: there that would be great and if that
782.96s: happened I would be even more
784.60s: comfortable scaling in so what I'm doing
786.72s: is I'm trying to pull every last ounce
789.80s: of extrinsic value out of this trade to
791.84s: give me more time to analyze where this
794.12s: thing might be going in my opinion and
796.52s: then make a decision based on how the
797.92s: rest of the portfolio looks as well so
800.40s: again if you have any questions anything
801.68s: you want to talk about let me know happy
803.28s: to discuss it if you enjoy this kind of
805.32s: content make sure you subscribe like the
806.80s: video so that we can emerge from the
808.72s: YouTube algorithm and grow our outlier
811.48s: Community the hive mind is very strong
814.04s: and I'm looking forward to Growing this
816.00s: skill set with everybody so until next
818.44s: time enjoy the markets there's lots to
820.48s: do out there and don't lose your shirt
823.56s: it's not worth it be an outlier catch
826.76s: you guys later
