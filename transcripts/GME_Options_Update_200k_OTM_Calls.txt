0.48s: bit of a mixed bag out there today so I
2.68s: want to do a quick market update and
4.32s: then I also want to apologize to you
6.28s: guys there's a couple things I have to
8.16s: come clean on which I'll get into in
10.68s: just a few minutes so talking about the
13.36s: markets first we have a lot of
17.32s: capitulation that's happening right now
19.88s: and it's across all of the indices
22.16s: notice that we had the S&P 500 that was
24.76s: down 3/4 of a percent today NASDAQ was
28.20s: down about half a percent and then the
30.16s: Russell was down almost 2% bid back up
34.12s: to about
35.48s: 1.9% so yeah overall some some pretty
40.24s: fair weakness going on but this isn't
42.64s: like falling out of bed can't get up
45.60s: kind of weakness this looks like a lot
47.60s: of things that have had a insane run
51.52s: from about April mid April until now so
55.48s: it's kind of like if you were to go out
57.48s: and Sprint as fast as you can
60.72s: sooner or later even if you're that dude
63.00s: that can run a sub 2hour Marathon or
65.84s: whatever the hell it is you got to take
68.32s: a break sooner or later so that's kind
70.88s: of what this is to me I see not a
74.24s: significant display of weakness across
76.72s: the market as I look across breath
79.96s: indicators I see net highs lows for
82.88s: example is turning down net highs is
85.28s: absolutely coming down but it's not
88.32s: diving into lows just yet although lows
90.96s: are now starting to expand this is gross
94.28s: lows um right behind my head here so you
98.48s: can see yesterday it was hovering right
100.28s: around 39 today it's down to 67 so if
103.44s: this starts accelerating meaningfully
106.00s: that starts to become more of a concern
107.84s: to me but right now it's still in kind
110.60s: of this middle Zone that doesn't cause
113.28s: for much concern in my opinion it looks
116.56s: like a bit of a pullback going on on the
119.28s: GameStop and why I need to apologize to
121.84s: you guys it is because I sold my long
124.88s: options today and here's what happened
128.68s: the market opened and we kind of hovered
131.84s: around here it didn't look like we were
133.96s: breaking out anywhere so literally all I
135.92s: did was set an alert for anything above
138.36s: 2898 to get back in and I said eh it
141.32s: looks like we're stalling out I'm going
142.52s: to take the Longs down but I played a
145.52s: little bit of a game with the market
146.96s: because we all know that the market
148.52s: essentially knows what I think and what
150.60s: you think and no matter what you do it's
152.40s: going to try to make you wrong so I
154.28s: figured if I sell the Longs and keep the
158.32s: short calls on that that would send the
161.36s: market higher right out of the Longs you
163.56s: keep the short calls against the shares
165.48s: now that I don't want to unwind yet and
168.24s: you think that that would send the
169.84s: market higher it didn't work
171.24s: unbelievably it didn't work I ended up
173.48s: actually closing the calls for a nice
176.28s: profit on the short side as well so I
178.40s: made money on both the long short calls
181.04s: but you know the game plan didn't work
183.68s: the market obviously knew what I was
185.76s: doing and it didn't play any games out
187.92s: here today so it did not fall for my
189.64s: trap as per usual that was like a last
191.92s: ditch effort to make this work for
193.32s: everybody and it didn't happen so my bad
196.20s: I'll I'll have to be smarter next time
198.32s: it must have known about the shares
199.96s: that's what I'm missing here it knew
202.48s: that I didn't want to unwind the shares
204.04s: and it was like fine get rid of the
205.28s: calls I'm going to punish the shares
207.08s: that's got to be what it's on about now
209.84s: little does it know I have my first
212.04s: alert set here maybe I'll set a a trap
214.28s: alert right here I'm going to set a trap
217.32s: alert and uh if GameStop goes below this
221.52s: alert that I just said I'm going to sell
225.16s: so we'll see what happens GameStop your
228.44s: move so what's going on in here though
230.80s: it does look like GameStop is rolling
232.60s: over a little bit there's no doubt about
234.04s: it it's hovering right around this point
236.60s: of control there's a lot of people
238.12s: continuing to transact here when I look
240.24s: at the overall view of volume for today
244.92s: it's much lighter so the volume
246.92s: contracted meaningfully below the 2E
250.40s: average now the other thing that I want
253.08s: to highlight from what I'm seeing here
255.52s: at least is the sale volume is not
257.88s: chilling out the sale volume is like 90%
260.44s: today so there are no shortage of people
264.68s: unwinding for various reasons you know
267.84s: there's a lot of speculation as to
269.16s: what's going on there but it's clear
271.00s: it's happening and it's having an effect
273.04s: on the price how much of this is just
276.80s: because of GameStop being GameStop
278.52s: probably a lot of it but there's also
280.40s: broad Market weakness so if you look
282.92s: across small caps in general they're
285.68s: they're not having a great day and you
288.60s: can take a look at that if we go into
290.88s: something
292.24s: like the visualized Tab and we grab the
295.84s: Russell it's a lot of red it's a lot of
298.56s: red you wouldn't want this to be what
301.04s: you're open your portfolio up to cuz
303.28s: everything is getting crushed all I'm
305.16s: highlighting is that there's very few
307.08s: segments of strength right now although
308.72s: there are some in things like financials
310.80s: energy those things are not
312.76s: underperforming so poorly right now
315.12s: Builders are doing okay small cap
318.80s: financials are getting killed but large
321.68s: cap is not quite so bad it's still not
324.56s: great to be clear but they're not like
326.24s: getting hammered as what we're seeing
328.28s: over here in the financials on the small
331.04s: cap side they're really getting beat up
333.60s: so let's take a look at the options
335.36s: chain we know already that I'm out of my
338.84s: front positions via options I'm waiting
340.72s: for a re-entry we had a ton of volume
343.00s: today there was no slowdown
345.64s: 36,000 contracts traded against for
349.88s: calls against 100,000 puts for the calls
353.96s: the vast majority the overwhelming
356.28s: majority here is in 19 July we can take
358.72s: a look at that at 22 and if we go
362.80s: out and we look at this 26 July
365.92s: expiration there's activity there but it
369.12s: does look like the 16 augs are starting
371.60s: to enter the equation that's what these
373.60s: yellow rectangles are people getting in
375.52s: there so if we compare those really fast
378.64s: for next week's expiration it's only
380.92s: 79,000 it's essentially 80,000 calls
383.72s: versus 32,000 puts and then in 16 a it's
388.28s: 32,800 against
390.60s: 9615 so what I'm seeing now is also
394.12s: fairly standard for what I'm starting to
396.08s: pick up as kind of normal for GameStop
399.84s: where the front expiration cycle
402.16s: especially if it's an Opex is way busier
405.20s: and then the weekly tend to slow down a
407.36s: little bit and then the monthly as it
410.32s: comes up probably will start to pick up
412.08s: a bit you can see that being reflected
413.72s: here literally in the implied volatility
415.76s: the implied volatility for the rest of
417.52s: this week all one day left is 100 55%
420.92s: drops to 131 129 125 then back up to
425.00s: 1315 that's a meaningful discrepancy
428.04s: between these and again it does have
430.00s: earnings coming up on the 4th of
432.68s: September this is not then so this isn't
435.76s: elevated because of some sort of
437.16s: earnings release it's elevated because
439.28s: it's a primary expiration Opex for
441.92s: GameStop which is still not chilled out
444.00s: yet in a massive way at least so I want
448.40s: to highlight a a couple other things
450.80s: really fast as I look at this the volume
454.08s: today was
456.28s: light so I looked at the total premium
460.36s: transactions and I mean we have what 1 2
463.08s: 3 four five trades that are above
465.20s: 100,000 so we have yeah whoever this is
467.84s: at 999,000 could you not have just done
470.76s: 1,000 more so that it could be in this
473.00s: you selfish human being come on now and
477.04s: there they sold the puts they're they're
478.88s: they're bullish here they sold puts and
481.20s: they couldn't do $1,000 more
483.08s: unbelievable sometimes people are so
484.88s: selfish
486.40s: so it's just slowing down it's slowing
488.64s: down a lot is what I'm seeing in the
489.80s: options chains again like if we go back
492.08s: to the 17th and we take a look at some
494.40s: of the transactions we were see in there
496.12s: take a look at how many we're above
497.72s: 100,000 a much more significant amount
500.72s: with the top three topping a million
503.52s: dollar combined I'm not even looking if
505.04s: they're bought sold I don't really care
506.44s: in this case they're pretty much all
507.72s: bullish trades but I I just want to see
510.52s: how engaged are these options chains how
512.84s: busy are they we go back to the 16th
515.24s: same story tons and tons of positions
517.80s: getting put on but you'll notice
519.48s: something a lot of these positions are
520.84s: not for this front expiration this is a
522.96s: prime example of people who have money
526.04s: making informed decisions with how
528.08s: they're structuring trades notice how
530.00s: many of these big positions that were
531.76s: put on for the 16th were for the Friday
534.44s: this coming Friday the 19th of July I am
538.64s: looking I see one for the 26th of July
543.44s: and then I see two down here for the
547.08s: 19th that's pretty much it this shows
550.36s: you where people typically that have
552.92s: decent resources available to them how
555.08s: they set up their trades there's a
556.84s: reason why they're not in these super
559.96s: short-term expirations so to me so far
564.48s: it is a function of keep an eye on
567.36s: things as I've been very closely looking
569.36s: for any sort of interesting activity
571.96s: that really starts to Peak my interest
574.08s: some of these transactions like these
576.32s: 25s these are for to tomorrow bro this
580.00s: was at the 25s they came in at 290 so
583.56s: they came in right at the offer and they
585.48s: paid
589.52s: $137,000 fingers crossed I mean I hope
592.20s: it works for them but then I also look
593.88s: at that and I think tough tough way to
596.32s: make a few bucks got to be honest with
598.16s: you so we'll see how that pans out for
600.56s: them if we look at those
603.04s: 25s
605.08s: and
606.72s: they're right now trading for
609.76s: A110 they got in at$
614.00s: 290
615.80s: so they've essentially cut down to a
619.24s: third of what their overall cost was in
622.44s: a day literally
624.28s: today this is the fun and the beauty of
629.00s: trade in really really short-term
631.60s: options is they giveth and they taketh
635.52s: and from our homeboy that came in at
638.72s: 0731 Pacific time with those 25
642.64s: calls 471 of them salute to you homie
646.76s: but that's not looking it's not looking
648.64s: great and again this isn't to to on
650.56s: them I genuinely I hope this prints
652.80s: tomorrow I really do but you can see
656.24s: that they obviously didn't put this
658.12s: trade on for 290 expecting it to go to
664.96s: A110 if I'm being generous like that
668.56s: that's the problem with these they're
669.64s: going to move super fast so as always if
672.68s: there's anything you want me to take a
673.76s: look at let me know I am going to be
675.16s: watching this pretty closely tomorrow
676.88s: for sure be an outlier I'll see you guys
679.24s: later
