638.64s: 5070
640.64s: close
642.64s: 5074
645.76s: I want to show you a couple things in looking at this
658.00s: We're going to look at the high low range and then the open closed range.
688.80s: Now, this is something again that if I'm doing this for myself to get this understanding,
697.04s: I'm actually just going to use Python and I'll query against the data and I'll essentially write
703.12s: a query that will have it aggregate by different periods, create distributions,
708.56s: but I'm approaching this from the very, very basic. Let's just get an eyeball on this. And there's a
717.52s: lot of value in that again, gearing this towards newer traders. So now let's just kind of look
724.08s: through this and see if we can find other periods that even look remotely close. And we can find a
731.28s: couple in here, but obviously these are nowhere even in the same scope of the range. So let's just do
741.68s: dollar range in here as well for context. So high minus low and then close minus open.
751.60s: And we want this as a dollar amount. There. This way you have a little bit of reference to keep
760.00s: track of. So the total range is about 625 points. And then the open close in this context is down
768.48s: 454. So let's just see if there's anything that comes even close. This is using the 2022 bear market.
776.32s: So we have this is one of the days. I'm going to zoom this in a little bit more so that it's easier
783.44s: to see these candles and then we'll scroll through them. So let's do a five year period here.
790.80s: And you can see there's literally nothing on this that's close. This one is the closest I can see.
797.20s: And this is from you know when this is from covid. So covid the largest candle that exists is this one.
806.88s: And this is the week of 24. So 24. Beb 20.
816.72s: And let's look at the details of this candle. So this is 3258.
823.84s: The high was 3260. The low was 2856. The close was 2954.
839.04s: Okay. So let's take a look. This is right when covid started really aggressively showing up.
858.64s: And take a look at the differences here. Covid edges out what happened this past week by about 1.4%.
869.04s: In terms of the total range. And then the open close range covid the global pandemic that at this point we
879.36s: thought was shutting the world down quite literally. This then resulted in a 9.3% drop compared to 8.2.
889.92s: So about a 1.1 variance 1.12. So.
893.60s: For context this is the only thing that we have as a reference. Now the big difference between what we're looking at now compared to the covid market is this is now been several weeks of this from the peak on what 6150.
913.92s: You can see that this covid drop unwound over what one we're not going to call that one 1 2 3 4 weeks a month that this drop occurred.
927.60s: Now if we take a look at the duration of this drop so far we'll start it from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 weeks.
936.88s: So one of the really important things that you have to be aware of as a trader is what you saw during covid and for a lot of people this covid was the first bear market that they saw.
953.44s: It completely skewed people's expectations of what recoveries look like.
960.40s: And what the average duration of a bear market is covid was literally a one day bear market before it started a rallying up and out.
973.92s: The average bear market borrowing covid is 298 days.
978.96s: So this is already starting to shape up like a far more standard contracting market which is important again to keep in mind because if you're playing this like you played the covid market expecting a really sharp bounce out it could happen.
998.56s: I'm not saying it's not going to happen. I don't know.
1000.56s: We've been in anybody that says that they know is fucking lying. Nobody knows.
1006.56s: We're all looking at the same information using our experience, our knowledge to come up with a probabilistic assessment of what we think is most probable to happen.
1017.56s: So could this have a really strong recovery up and out it could but what would that require think of what happened during the covid bear market above my head here what led to that recovery that led that recovery was led by big daddy J pow essentially throwing everything he had at the problem.
1039.56s: Yes, well, we're at now a completely different landscape.
1043.56s: The reason why the landscape is so different at this point is because we already are in a inflationary environment whether we're still calling inflation transitory or not.
1053.56s: I obviously don't think it's transitory objectively at this point, but there's also technical definitions that people try to argue.
1061.56s: But all that stuff aside, it's important to pay attention as a trader in the way that you approach this kind of market because there is a normal duration for bear markets that is much longer and we're not even quite there yet.
1076.56s: So if we take a look at this total move, we are down 18% this isn't even triggering a bear market yet.
1085.56s: This is a what we would call a deep correction.
1088.56s: Now corrections are actually very normal.
1094.56s: We expect to see a few of them each year to a degree depending on the context.
1099.56s: So this actually isn't necessarily unhealthy depending on how this candle continues to resolve.
1108.56s: But you can see that if we go out on this weekly timeframe, we still have upwards sloping 20 or 200 period moving average.
1116.56s: This is obviously looking at 200 weeks.
1118.56s: This is a much longer duration.
1120.56s: It looks much healthier.
1122.56s: But all of the short term indication right now is super bearish.
1127.56s: And the way that I think about these kinds of moves is playing the cards close to the chest.
1136.56s: The pot odds right now favor the downside.
1139.56s: So then if there is some sort of upside recovery, which they're likely will be you have to be careful about how much money you give it and how carefully you watch it.
1150.56s: Because all during even during bear markets, they're called bear market rallies.
1155.56s: The average bear market rally again, depending on time frame is around an 8% up move.
1161.56s: So that is close to what happened here.
1165.56s: It's close to what happened here.
1167.56s: So as things are going down, it's very normal to see a rotation of things rallying up, but then rolling back over and going down.
1176.56s: Now this obviously is set a very clear trend across all of the different sectors.
1182.56s: The weakness is broad.
1185.56s: So to summarize the broad market analysis and what's going on here is you have to pay very close attention to anything related to tariffs.
1199.56s: If there's any hint that the tariffs might start lightning up with key trade partners, I would expect the market to react very favorably.
1209.56s: If there's key partners that are announcing reciprocal tariffs, I expect the market to unwind even harder.
1218.56s: All companies right now are discounting their expected earnings.
1224.56s: That means earnings slows. That means GDP slows. GDP is already expected to be slow in the inflationary environment.
1232.56s: If GDP continues to slow too much, we go into a recession during a recession.
1237.56s: There's very clear market behaviors always varies to a degree, but there are a lot of elements that you can count on.
1246.56s: Things that you can count on are certain sectors outperforming other sectors.
1250.56s: This is what we spent a lot of time during the pro live streams this week talking about these different elements and pockets and looking for leaders within these pockets.
1259.56s: Right now, what we do is essentially create a shopping list.
1265.56s: It's too early to start throwing a bunch of money at the problem because the problem is still unfolding.
1271.56s: And with most people, especially in a beginner series, limited capital, smaller account, if you run out of money too fast, you're kind of fucked.
1281.56s: You just sit there and you now turn to hope, which is a terrible trading strategy. It doesn't work well.
1287.56s: Now, a couple other general updates, the variance risk premium strategies that I play of different time frames really have performed poorly for non-insured day risk premiums, which is different than what this used to be.
1306.56s: That also informs that there's a bit of a change going on and I'm adapting to what the market is currently doing because of that.
1314.56s: In Shreday, risk premiums are still very, very strong, especially right now.
1319.56s: The coverage strangle right now are worth talking about because all of them are struggling.
1328.56s: And this is a really, really great time to talk to you about trading strategies during markets that are not accommodating you need to see that it's not always smooth sailing and it requires hard decisions and really sound management in order for this whole thing to come together successfully.
1352.56s: So I want to talk to you a little bit about this.
1355.56s: So this is the latest update again for the sample coverage strangle that I share with you all.
1361.56s: And the first thing that you'll notice is that utilization in T triple Q's is actually come down. How does it come down? It's because I took these short puts off for a loss.
1375.56s: And I'm just eating that loss right now. I'm not worried about recovering it. The reason why I'm not worried about recovering it is because this one series of short puts.
1389.56s: If I allow assignment, you can see it will make $12,000 right now there's about a $10,500 loss across the different roles so far.
1399.56s: So what I'm doing is I'm taking some risk and utilization off because if I keep this on the utilization actually is too high given the severity of the moves.
1411.56s: So because of that, I take the loss on this the short puts that I have on now, even though they weren't part of this in the beginning, these now become the base short put position.
1425.56s: So it's all I have out right now and what I'm going to do is use the additional lots that I just took off from this to help adjust this basis because this basis is going to need a lot of help.
1443.56s: Right now, T triple Q's is at 41 the basis on these is 66 my equity basis is 64.3. I'm not worried about the equity basis. Honestly, don't care about that about at all.
1455.56s: It doesn't really matter to me. But what I absolutely do care about is the basis that I continue to add on to the position because that cannot be too disadvantageous. Otherwise, you start to get back into a pretty difficult corner, which I don't want to be in.
1472.56s: So that's the game plane here. This is an example of not blindly following a standard plan of always roll your option. Always do blank if challenged always do whatever the majority of the time I will roll my options as you can tell from this. This has already been rolled four times.
1494.56s: One, two, three, three times. Sorry. This one's been rolled three times. However, it's definitely going to need a fourth and I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up being like a 10 to 15 roll kind of situation.
1512.56s: But what I'm able to do is start using the capital that I unlocked from this effectively to get me out at a profit sooner because here's one of the things that sucks for people that are trading leverage ETFs that are static.
1531.56s: If you started buying up here, right, and let's say you started adding here because you think 70s are great bargain. And a lot of times when it dips down like this, it shoots right back up. You don't want to miss it. So you're adding risk on long story short.
1545.56s: You run out of money and then your basis is set. Your basis is what it is. However, with options, we have satellite positions. I can adjust and move my basis, which is one thing I want to show you quickly before we go to any questions you have, which is down here with I bet.
1564.56s: So I bet right now is 1000 shares at 50 and I bet it's trading at 4771. So I want to show you some math. Well, first, let me take a step back.
1579.56s: I think I know the answer to this, but are you aware you can drop a yes, like a Y or an N in the chat. Are you aware that you can effectively move between equity positions in short put positions.
1599.56s: You don't have to stay in one of the other. So right now with my equity position, I have a basis of 50. It's not a bad basis, but I might want to move it. And I can move that basis not by dollar cost averaging in, but by moving between options and equity.
1617.56s: Are you familiar with that? Are you even aware of that as a process? My guess is the majority of people would say no, because I don't really see it talked about.
1626.56s: Got three knows, four knows five knows six knows. Yeah. And this is what I would expect. And it's because the reason why I expect this is not because what I'm about to talk about is like some sort of super secret squirrel shit. It's not, but it's non linear thinking and most people that trade, at least on the retail side that aren't taking it as seriously as maybe they should is a lot of those people look for broad platitudes and they think very little.
1656.56s: So let me show you this recess from shares to short puts. Yep, that's exactly it moving in and out between the different positions, not necessarily shares to short puts outright it can be short puts to shares.
1673.56s: It can be a mix of the two.
1679.56s: And I'll show you what this looks like.
1685.56s: Oops.
1708.56s: Is what did I say 47 71 I think I bet 47 71 great.
1720.56s: 47 71.
1723.56s: Let's take a look at the position here.
1734.56s: Right now, again, my basis is 50.
1742.56s: And additionally, the way that most people think of adjusting your basis is by dollar cost averaging or value averaging. This is effectively either buying more shares or selling some of your shares.
1758.56s: We can use options instead. And no, I don't mean options in the context of selling calls and taking the credit I received from the calls and decreasing my basis.
1768.56s: If we take a look at the coverage strangle, the short call element of Ibit is actually made to grand. So effectively, what that would do if you apply that kind of methodology is it would take the cost of this from 50 down to 48, which again is not how I do math.
1784.56s: But that's how some people would think about doing it. That aside, I want to show you something.
1792.56s: So let's take a look at what the P and L is for this at this point in time. So this minus this times this.
1799.56s: We're down 2350. Is anybody have an idea on how we can effectively start adjusting our basis here in Ibit?
1813.56s: Any guesses on how we might do this? What do we think?
1822.56s: While you're guessing I'm going to open the door for.
1835.56s: And Tommy says sell shares sell puts with proceeds. That's a good start. Talk to me more about the details there.
1849.56s: I'm texting Joe telling him that I think you should watch the shares.
1854.56s: Hey, there's a sell cash secure puts if you have extra money. Okay.
1860.56s: So then if we exit the position.
1866.56s: Amadeus is sell a few contracts in the money that's getting closer.
1870.56s: So let's take a look. We started we gave the market 50,000 and 60.
1878.56s: Tommy says use proceeds to sell puts below basis price. That would be a great idea, but that might not actually work.
1888.56s: So right now.
1891.56s: We have 47, 710 to use.
1896.56s: So I'm going to squish this down.
1900.56s: So that it's a little bit out of the way.
1904.56s: And let's take a look.
1907.56s: At.
1909.56s: Re says loss on shares and offer puts where you want reentry.
1914.56s: Well, let's let's take a look at that. Let's see if we do that scenario.
1917.56s: So let's say that I want to get in at a 30 delta.
1927.56s: That would mean I would be selling the 44s. Is that what I would want to do.
1935.56s: And while you're answering that, I'm going to just start building a rudimentary log.
1940.56s: This will be expiry. This will be.
1947.56s: Strike premium.
1951.56s: Lots.
1955.56s: Re says it depends. Well, not really actually in this context. There's kind of a not a right or wrong answer.
1961.56s: I would say, but there's definitely a preferential scenario.
1968.56s: Tommy says sell shares at spot sell puts it spot to collect premium. Well, if I did that, the only thing I'm doing is booking a loss.
1981.56s: What other ideas? Let's do 16 May.
1989.56s: I will show you.
1992.56s: I'm going to keep this over here so I can easily click back into it.
1996.56s: So we know that the loss we just consumed is 2350.
2001.56s: We know that we have 47,710 dollars to use that just came out from this.
2006.56s: We know our current basis is 50 dot of six.
2010.56s: So let's just eyeball some things.
2014.56s: The first thing is we can build like a really rudimentary calculate over here that does strike that does lots.
2022.56s: And then we can calculate what the cash secured requirement is and you'll see why this matters.
2034.56s: If we say maybe we go to like the 48. Well, first, let's just start with the 44 strike.
2043.56s: And let's see how many lots we can do. So this is going to equal.
2051.56s: This times this times 100.
2058.56s: So if we do in 11 lot, we essentially add a little bit of size, not much.
2066.56s: So this wouldn't be the end of the world, but we add a little bit of size.
2071.56s: So depending on whether or not that's our goal, DVD.
2076.56s: Well, let's take a look at the premium we would get here.
2080.56s: The funny thing is I literally just built this sideways over here.
2084.56s: I don't know why it's actually kind of funny.
2087.56s: I guess we'll just move our stuff over here since I already have this done.
2093.56s: As I add premium on top of it, it's actually.
2098.56s: You're all that out.
2107.56s: So the premium that we would get for these 44s is.
2112.56s: Let's call it $2.5. Don't like that.
2117.56s: Credit.
2121.56s: Equals this times lot size times one.
2130.56s: And it's not a percent.
2132.56s: So the credit we would get here is 22 55.
2137.56s: So what's something you notice as I'm doing this math for you?
2142.56s: Is that where I would want to sell those puts?
2149.56s: Amade says did the stream freeze did it? I feel like I'm here.
2158.56s: Am I gone?
2166.56s: Okay, thank you, Alberto. I was going to say I feel like I'm here.
2171.56s: Seems like I'm here. I believe that I'm here.
2176.56s: Thank you guys.
2179.56s: What do we notice? Talk to me.
2184.56s: What do we think about this transaction?
2192.56s: There's a key component to pay attention to.
2201.56s: It's this.
2212.56s: If instead, I sell puts.
2218.56s: So H has connected the dots. Great job.
2223.56s: Good job. So now instead of doing the 44, we now know we probably have to do like the 45s.
2229.56s: And if we do those for 236.
2234.56s: Now what's happened?
2236.56s: What's happened is I've covered the entire loss of selling the shares with the credit.
2241.56s: That means if I take assignment, then I've netted out.
2247.56s: A profit on the premium I received here.
2251.56s: And I've reduced my basis by $5.
2254.56s: Nobody does this.
2255.56s: At least anybody that I've seen.
2257.56s: But this is one of the key methods I use to adjust my basis to move around.
2264.56s: When the market is not accommodating, there's no reason to sit static.
2271.56s: Because right now with the shares that I hold.
2275.56s: I just hold a thousand shares at 506.
2277.56s: Nothing's happening with those shares.
2279.56s: They're effectively trading sideways.
2281.56s: As you can see, they've been trading sideways for some time now.
2285.56s: But by doing this, I can adjust my basis.
2297.56s: This decreases the total basis by over 10%.
2305.56s: And it covers the cost of the loss on the shares.
2312.56s: So this is how I use options to maintain mobility and spot price sensitivity for both the equity and the options.
2327.56s: This is something that if you can do this well and you can track well,
2331.56s: it literally becomes a superpower.
2333.56s: Genuinely, I'm not being sarcastic here.
2335.56s: The reason why it becomes a superpower, especially for something like the coverage strangle is this.
2341.56s: If we take a look at where I bit is now.
2345.56s: And let's say I bit continues to trend sideways.
2349.56s: Again, my basis is here.
2351.56s: If a trend sideways, I gain nothing from it.
2355.56s: I need it to be rapidly ascending.
2360.56s: However, I can get myself to a basis that's down here if I'm so inclined.
2367.56s: And then let's say that the stock starts moving in my direction.
2371.56s: And I want to get back in. What do I do?
2373.56s: I sell the options if I'm inclined.
2377.56s: Buy them back to close.
2379.56s: And then I buy the shares outright.
2381.56s: Does that mean that I would have recovered the entire loss?
2383.56s: Maybe, maybe not.
2384.56s: It depends on how much I would have collected in the time frame that I do that.
2388.56s: But what I can tell you is I am unequivocally better off than where I was at just holding the shares.
2394.56s: Food for thought.
2396.56s: Okay.
2397.56s: Let's get a couple questions before I got a wrap up.
2400.56s: GC says one thought he's he actually just left.
2403.56s: He's eating dinner right now.
2405.56s: So I can hook hook it up when he gets back.
2409.56s: Manscaped goat says that is smart.
2411.56s: This.
2412.56s: I'm not that into like giving myself compliments is most of you have probably heard.
2416.56s: But this absolutely is a really good way to manage the coverage strangle.
2422.56s: And it's a really good way to continue to move with the market if you have a lot of shares.
2428.56s: It's something that I'm going to have to do potentially in T triple cues.
2432.56s: It's actually difficult to do once you get further in the money.
2440.56s: But again, this is something that people don't know.
2444.56s: People don't do because they think too linearly.
2447.56s: They think I'm always supposed to sell my if I'm rolling options, I'm supposed to always do it for a credit.
2453.56s: You already know that's bullshit.
2455.56s: If you've watched the videos that I've done, you don't have to do it for a credit.
2458.56s: You just have to pay attention to the aggregate P and L of what you're doing.
2462.56s: This is also why I use things like dynamic lot sizing.
2465.56s: Just like the example I gave you in T triple cues, I took a four lot down because I have an eight lot that's out super far in the money.
2472.56s: And it's actually going to help me a lot and I'll show you exactly how.
2479.56s: So here.
2481.56s: We have this eight lot.
2485.56s: I'm actually going to grab this whole thing.
2494.56s: And let's pop it down here.
2502.56s: So let's take a look at a scenario here.
2516.56s: If I want to roll something with this.
2522.56s: Here's what's here's what's going to have to happen.
2527.56s: And it ain't going to be pretty.
2534.56s: Let's take a look at what these options are trading for right now in T triple cues.
2538.56s: This is a good example of something that's wildly in the money.
2545.56s: So first we can take a look at the share position because I want to show you another scenario.
2550.56s: It's not not like an always fix all kind of thing.
2553.56s: There's new wants to it.
2555.56s: So this is we have 800 shares.
2558.56s: Our basis is 64.3.
2562.56s: Spot price right now is 41.09.
2570.56s: So this is the T triple cues position.
2573.56s: So now if we try to eyeball let's use 16 May again.
2578.56s: And let's see we need to find something that would give us $18,000 using effectively 33K could go a little bit over it.
2586.56s: So what that tells us is right out of the gate we're not going to be able to go to at the money.
2590.56s: Right. So let's do an at the money option just at a curiosity.
2593.56s: Let's do a 40 strike.
2595.56s: The premium on that let's call it $5.30.
2599.56s: And the lot size again we can just loosely see how much we can put on.
2606.56s: The other thing that we can do is just do like a target lot size which would be like this.
2616.56s: And then just do math.
2634.56s: So we know we can only get an eight lot.
2637.56s: If we don't want to change our size.
2642.56s: So then let's say that we do that eight lot.
2645.56s: That's going to give us $4,240.
2648.56s: Does that fix the P and L situation.
2652.56s: Obviously not we are light years off from where we would need to be.
2659.56s: So then what does that mean?
2661.56s: It means that we have to accept the fact that if we're going to do this we're going to have to be somewhere in the money.
2665.56s: It's the only choice that we have.
2667.56s: So our current basis is 64.
2669.56s: Let's say if we try to do something at like the 60.
2673.56s: So if we do the 60 the premium that you get on those let's call it 19 and a half maybe.
2687.56s: So now what well we can see that the cash secured amount.
2692.56s: For this trade using an eight lot.
2696.56s: Which is still too much it's going to add size.
2700.56s: And we still don't cover the loss.
2703.56s: So this isn't going to work the 60s don't work.
2706.56s: So what I'm showing you is that if you go further and further in the money and you allow it to get too far in the money.
2712.56s: You can still do it but you have to use the additional size that you have at your disposal.
2717.56s: Which again if you recall I had a four lot.
2720.56s: And that four lot was at the 50 strike.
2726.56s: So that $20,000 I effectively get another $20,000 on top of this that I can use.
2733.56s: So that 20k really would take me to like $53,000.
2736.56s: This now falls within the $53,000 requirement.
2740.56s: So if we take a look at the 60 choose.
2743.56s: And let's say that those give us like 21 and 3 quarters.
2751.56s: Now it's effectively taking a choice I can take a $1100 haircut.
2757.56s: But I can move out of shares and I can get into options.
2762.56s: And then let's just take a look at what this might look like.
2765.56s: This is this next.
2770.56s: I don't want to overwhelm you with this next part.
2772.56s: So if it does don't.
2775.56s: Don't think anything of it.
2777.56s: But I use what I call surrogate options.
2780.56s: This is how I can just eyeball how my position might look at different times.
2787.56s: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pretend in my mind that I have these 62s on.
2792.56s: But instead of putting them on now, I'm going to pretend time is passed.
2797.56s: So what I can do is I can say, all right, let's say three weeks is passed.
2800.56s: What would my 62s look like?
2803.56s: Like coming here, my 62s are about worth the same as what they're worth now.
2809.56s: Why does that matter?
2810.56s: Well, the reason why it matters is because then if I'm looking to try and to roll these options,
2816.56s: I have to go further and further and further and further out in order to get a meaningful basis adjustment.
2822.56s: But that's a big difference because let's say the 62s here.
2829.56s: These are currently trading for 2135.
2833.56s: The 62s here, these are trading for 2145.
2836.56s: So you get 10 cents.
2837.56s: So it's not going to allow me to roll if this same scenario is underway.
2843.56s: I mean, meaning roll and improve my basis unless I go further out in time.
2847.56s: But the difference is I can still do something.
2850.56s: Whereas if I again, in this scenario, just hold these shares, then I'm just going to be stock at 64.
2858.56s: And there's not anything wrong with that.
2860.56s: You can sit and wait.
2861.56s: That's one of the beautiful parts about the strategy.
2868.56s: I'm a day says I guess is where you're believed in the underlying is essential willing to hold long term in spite of weak market conditions, most likely things like into into season ETFs.
2876.56s: That's exactly correct.
2877.56s: It's exactly why the coverage triangle is almost only traded for me in things like index ETFs.
2884.56s: And it's for that it's for that exact reason.
2887.56s: It's that I'm not even something like T triple cues.
2891.56s: If I think about T triple cues five years from now, even with the volatility drag that it suffer suffers and all that kind of shit doesn't matter.
2901.56s: But the key thing here is that if I keep an open mind, I can move things around because guess what, even adjusting my basis from 64 to 62 on the existing size that I would have.
2918.56s: I can decrease the total cash requirement, right, because the original cost for me to get into this was 51,000 now obviously once I include the current P and L.
2929.56s: It's lost money.
2930.56s: So I have to use this updated P and L.
2932.56s: But now that it's at 62.
2935.56s: I can then say maybe on an additional role, maybe I can look at adding a little bit more size.
2940.56s: Maybe that would help the position out.
2943.56s: And then all of a sudden that becomes worth the conversation.
2947.56s: So then let's say I need to roll these out or I need to add some more short puts because I'm going to move my equity position into a short put position so that I can move the lot size around the main thing I'm trying to emphasize here is that I can be very dynamic.
2963.56s: I'm not stuck.
2965.56s: There's a lot that I can still do even though the market is outright objectively going against my position massively and for context on how massively when I first got into the triple cues with this short put the very first series of short puts it was at 85, 42.
2989.56s: If I take a look at the current price again, which is at 41,09, 41.09.
2996.56s: It's literally down from 85 to 41.
3004.56s: And absolutely massive change.
3009.56s: Right.
3010.56s: And again, that's the beautiful part about being able to run this kind of strategy is it gives me a ton of mobility that I otherwise don't really have.
3025.56s: So yeah.
3028.56s: That concludes my TED talk.
3033.56s: Obviously, if you have any questions, let's talk about it. I know that I saw one get dropped in there. So let's take a look at that defensive instinct says I've been lurking for a while and your explanations are always talk not to keep it up.
3046.56s: That's awesome. That's great to hear.
3047.56s: Sometimes the stuff that I talk about is I know a little bit weird, especially for like the beginner side of the equation, but I hope that the information is at least usable because I know what most people here online is the standard bullshit of everything's always good.
3061.56s: It's easy money super fast and like that's just not the reality of trading. The reality of trading is being able to navigate shit like this successfully.
3069.56s: So I'm glad that it's comprehensive and understandable.
3075.56s: All right. So Reese says Nike options chain messed them up. May and June puts got bit up, but I couldn't get a fill even below the bid, which is higher than the ass. What gives liquidity? You already know the answer to this.
3087.56s: As the markets become more volatile liquidity dries up. So just because you were trying to exit and you're going below the bid, it means you have to go further.
3099.56s: That's all. The thing to remember about an order book is like this. So if we use T triple Qs for an example, just because we're in here.
3110.56s: And I will draw this out for you.
3116.56s: Let's say.
3120.56s: Let's look at this for an example.
3124.56s: This is the 41's. So right now they're bid at 635 and they're offered at 775.
3133.56s: And then notice the size resays I was a dollar 50 below the ask doesn't fucking matter go further like that's what that means.
3140.56s: It means that the liquidity is not there.
3145.56s: So just because you were a dollar 50 literally doesn't mean shit.
3150.56s: And you can see that the bid right now the bid size is two. And then the offer size it's probably bigger than 10 I can't see. So I'm just going to say it's 10.
3159.56s: So here's what happens.
3161.56s: As soon as there are a series of orders that enter in at 635.
3168.56s: So let's say that there's five orders. What happens is these two get crossed off.
3174.56s: There's still these three that are remaining at 635.
3178.56s: But after these two get consumed, this might move down to 634.
3185.56s: So then these people have a choice they can either walk their order in which a lot of automated programs do that.
3192.56s: So then these will automatically now attack this.
3196.56s: So even if you're all the way out here at a dollar 50 lower than where current spot prices.
3205.56s: This is happening with all of the market participants at the same time.
3209.56s: So you're essentially in a queue.
3212.56s: What this means is if you put a sale order below the bid and your a dollar 50 below the bid.
3219.56s: What that means is in this queue you're you're not up here.
3224.56s: You're way down here.
3227.56s: So these people would be getting filled faster than you.
3231.56s: This is exactly what happens during severe liquidity issues.
3237.56s: And this is exactly when you see severe liquidity issues during big market moves like this.
3243.56s: So yeah, that literally doesn't surprise me in the least during especially in something like Nike Nike was going haywire today with all the news.
3251.56s: So yeah, I think that that roundabout checks out to me.
3258.56s: Amidate says I will need to watch this part again. That was confusing. Make a note somewhere.
3263.56s: Yeah, I mean, you could just jot it down for yourself.
3266.56s: I don't because I also I'm not sure like what part there is.
3270.56s: I'll probably end up doing a video anyways in the future talking a little bit about this.
3275.56s: Because like it's topical now and it's something that I'm going to do.
3279.56s: So that might be that might be useful.
3283.56s: Re says it was trading normal then puts spike higher even though spot was up.
3288.56s: Yeah, that's that's the nature of volatile markets.
3292.56s: Shit will absolutely move and move around quite a lot.
3296.56s: So it sounds about right.
3299.56s: All right, gang, time for me to bounce. I'm going to go hang out with my buddy Joe a little bit and then packing as you can tell there's no live streams next week and probably not for the first half of the following week.
3310.56s: So I will be off for a little bit. I still be around here and there.
3315.56s: If you guys need anything, you can always hit up the discord. There's plenty of people in there besides myself that will be able to help out.
3321.56s: And then in the meantime, don't let the market get you pay attention to what you're doing.
3326.56s: Play things slow, wait to see strength. There's no rush.
3329.56s: One of the worst things you could do is burn up all your money too fast.
3333.56s: And then you're kind of like just sitting there. That's a bad place to be.
3337.56s: Be an outlier.
3339.56s: Kill it.
