0.88s: what's up outliers today's video is all
2.84s: about GameStop because we had a couple
4.88s: things happen today I will do the
6.52s: standard market update later today
8.68s: during the options trading for beginners
11.04s: Workshop but uh yeah there was just a
13.52s: couple things in here that I think we
14.80s: need to spend a few minutes looking at
16.48s: and for those interested tomorrow
18.32s: Saturday at 5:00 P p.m. Pacific Time
21.24s: still have the standardized GameStop
23.76s: live stream the game plan actually was
25.44s: to look through roaring Kitty old trades
28.56s: so this seems to in line with it so
31.84s: what's going on today well at there's
34.28s: two time frames that I think are most
36.52s: important the first thing is I got an
38.64s: alert and these are Pacific time but I
41.36s: got an alert at
43.08s: 8:42 that there were some really massive
46.32s: siiz trades that came through in
50.04s: GameStop so there is
52.48s: 6,399 of the 22 and A2 calls expiring 13
56.00s: sep the spot price at these at the time
58.52s: was bck 75 got in there for 1.12 mil and
62.72s: then right below that essentially a
64.76s: second off so I would absolutely
67.20s: consider these to be the same trade
69.64s: there was 3660 of the 22 a half calls
73.68s: same expiration for $169 giggity for
77.08s: 69,000 bucks so this takes us over
81.24s: 10,000 contracts essentially and there's
84.60s: some just really really really really
89.04s: interesting Behavior going on here so
92.12s: 0842 37 and 38 that's when these trades
95.04s: come through then we take a look at
97.52s: roran Kitty's Twitter this happened at
100.96s: 09 on the nose today so these trades
106.16s: came
107.04s: through this came
109.64s: out
111.28s: then the stock started to move so if I
116.28s: slide this out of the way and then let's
118.80s: just take a look at like a today let's
121.32s: do it today one minute so it's clearer
123.88s: take a
124.96s: look so roaring
128.32s: Kitty post this again
131.92s: 09 we see these two trades come through
135.72s: big block orders
138.08s: 0842 so let's take a look what happened
140.36s: at
142.32s: 0842 you can see that the market saw it
146.12s: and absolutely bit up on that movement
148.40s: that's very likely a mix of hedging
151.28s: Behavior because those are big trades
153.56s: hedging Behavior coming on by market
156.08s: makers
157.92s: then we wait a few minutes 09 on the
161.92s: nose roaring Kitty posts that Meme so
167.16s: what do we see here massive volume Spike
171.36s: immediately all by side all byy side
175.32s: massive volume Spike and for those that
178.68s: obviously are kind of wondering what's
179.92s: going on here the the idea is this is
182.44s: what he originally posted on June 27th
186.40s: and then we saw I think the filing was
188.40s: for like the 26th or something like the
190.04s: day before I don't remember it doesn't
191.96s: matter that much but you can throw it in
193.92s: the comments if you know which day it
195.08s: was cuz I don't recall the point being
197.32s: though is notice green eyes we were
199.40s: obviously flipping out about the blue
201.08s: background and all these different kinds
202.36s: of things but the green eyes then I
206.00s: noticed red eyes I notice eyes pointing
208.80s: to the St stage right eyes pointing well
211.64s: I guess stage left stage right my left
214.60s: in this case the main thing I see is
217.24s: green by Red Cell like that's what it
219.56s: looks like and obviously the meme looks
221.20s: like the kid from Toy Story dropping his
223.56s: toy he's you know moving on from the toy
225.60s: that's when he went and played with Buzz
226.80s: Lightyear like a Chad and then he came
228.52s: back and realized that Woody's the homie
230.44s: and he liked Hood Woody I don't know if
232.36s: people are reading that far into the
234.00s: story I personally don't think that's
235.76s: what's being inferred here as in you
238.00s: know he's putting down chewy and then
239.88s: and like the movie actually he's going
242.32s: to go back to chewy because that's what
244.20s: he does with Woody I don't see that
246.68s: personally to me this is just
248.16s: representative of him putting down chewy
250.84s: and the red eyeballs look like cell
254.44s: right green buy Red Cell that's my tin
257.60s: foil hat that's my guess as what's being
259.84s: inferred here so obviously a lot of the
263.40s: market also made that same inference
266.80s: because we see this massive sky rocket
270.44s: in GameStop shoots up and it's trading
273.96s: around like this 22 handle that shoots
276.20s: up like 10% to 24 it was up like over 8%
280.88s: when I made that first video a little
282.36s: bit earlier and then it started coming
284.40s: back down but we can
286.24s: see definitely kicked off a a strong
289.96s: movement what I cannot help but find
293.16s: curious and I don't know what this means
295.36s: and I don't want to pretend like I know
296.64s: what it means I just have to point it
299.00s: out I see 5,000 blocks of the 22 and a
303.16s: half calls in 13th September being sold
306.60s: so my inference and again I'm
309.60s: highlighting inference
311.52s: because is closely related as everything
316.04s: might point at something going on being
318.28s: somebody bought these and then sold them
321.16s: essentially a half hour later which
322.64s: we're going to talk about in a second
324.40s: that's what the immediate inference
325.84s: would be and to me that does seem likely
329.20s: but that doesn't mean that's what
331.08s: happened we don't know and I always want
334.00s: to remind people that it's okay to have
336.24s: ideas on what we can reasonably conclude
339.12s: happened as in this case but until we
342.92s: know for certain I don't think it's
345.16s: smart to essentially take our idea as
348.08s: truth because here's what looks like
350.16s: what happened I see 0842 these come out
355.32s: 0900 we see that tweet I see 0919 and 0
359.68s: 922 both 5,000
362.84s: lot of the 22 and a half calls same
365.52s: expiration being Unwound so if we look
369.36s: at this we can see okay well on this
372.04s: block here he got he being whoever this
375.00s: is because again even taking a step back
377.24s: we don't know that this is royan Kitty
379.64s: we don't know would I guess that it is
381.92s: personally I would guess that it is it
383.76s: seems very likely but does that mean
386.72s: that it's him no and I don't know
389.24s: neither does anybody else until he posts
392.04s: a YOLO update until he says something
394.16s: just want to drive that point home so
396.04s: when I'm talking about he I really am
398.32s: talking about whoever this is I have who
400.72s: I think it is and I'm sharing that
402.20s: openly so that it's not like this
404.00s: cryptic message there's enough cryptic
405.96s: messages going on but it's not to taint
409.64s: your analysis of things that's why I'm
411.68s: specifically calling out my uh my bias
415.24s: in what I think this is so I see these
419.16s: go through
420.12s: and I see this happens at $1.75 and then
422.88s: this one unwinds let's call it 225 right
425.40s: let's just use that as a general
427.24s: guesstimate do I think if it were
431.16s: roaring Kitty do I think roaring Kitty
434.80s: would come in here at
437.68s: $1.75 and then after a move from let's
442.28s: take a look 42 842 to 919 let's see what
446.04s: that looks like
448.52s: 842 here so right down here to
455.92s: 919 over here this big red
458.92s: candle do I think that's his move
462.72s: personally not unless something else is
464.92s: going on we've seen this dude hold his
468.76s: position up over a quarter billion do
474.00s: not a quarter million a quarter billion
477.00s: dollar he has more money than he could
479.04s: ever need
481.52s: so if this was him that bought here and
485.72s: if this was him that sold here although
490.08s: it's going to come out in force because
492.20s: it does look like somebody pumped and
494.48s: dumped again I'm not trying to cause
496.72s: chaos here it's just this is a
498.44s: quintessential style of that that
500.36s: behavior because typically this is what
503.24s: a pump and dump is where somebody front
505.48s: runs a move we gain a position we do
507.84s: something that we know is going to move
509.88s: something and then we exit after the
511.80s: move typically in a really short-term
513.48s: time frame that's generally what it is
516.76s: do I think that that's what he would do
519.68s: no I genuinely don't and do I think
522.28s: that's what he would do for this amount
524.20s: of money again for most morals like us
526.12s: we're thinking like dog that's like
528.12s: two million bucks two 2.2 is 2.3 almost
532.52s: like yeah I mean I might do it but
535.68s: joking
536.72s: aside hundreds of millions of dollars
539.00s: like he does doesn't he doesn't care he
540.96s: doesn't care that he made a a few
543.52s: thousand dos tens of hundreds of
545.28s: thousand dollars like he doesn't care
547.08s: I've seen this dude hold positions that
550.40s: again were up over
551.68s: $250 million and just do nothing so if
558.20s: this was him I would be surprised for a
560.64s: few reasons the first reason is again I
562.80s: just don't think that's his behavior I
564.72s: think it would take a lot more for him
566.20s: to do again unless he's trying to do
568.04s: something else on the back end that we
569.72s: might not be privy to the other thing
572.00s: that I could see that's slightly
573.64s: different is this is a really short-term
575.40s: entry 7 days I haven't seen based on
578.52s: what he's done previously which again
580.52s: tomorrow on that live stream the goal is
582.76s: to go through this exact thing in detail
585.52s: because it's very interesting but I
587.36s: haven't seen him go through these really
589.40s: short-term trades like this so not
591.40s: saying that he never could but I that's
593.64s: just not the Behavior I've seen from him
596.04s: so I personally am left with a massive
599.68s: massive question mark I really as per
602.72s: usual don't really know what's going on
604.80s: here so the other thing that I did to
606.84s: take a closer look at this is I looked
608.28s: at the 22 and A2
611.08s: specifically and rather than just look
613.00s: at today I wanted to look back over the
615.28s: last week and see what kind of behavior
618.20s: I saw going on in there and there's just
620.80s: nothing there's nothing even close to
623.88s: this magnitude in this time frame so
626.80s: then the other thing I thought is okay
628.20s: I've seen RAR and kitty do these before
630.20s: a lot of times he does it like almost a
632.68s: month out is when he'll start building
634.48s: his position so same same go all the way
636.84s: out to August come all the way into here
639.40s: and let's take a look at these 22 and a
641.52s: halfs same exact thing being there's no
645.72s: activity before here and obviously
647.96s: there's some activity but this is all
649.56s: super small stuff compared to these so
653.36s: the fireworks were today that obviously
655.80s: we can see pretty clearly what this all
658.56s: means and what it looks like I really
660.08s: don't know but my guess is if this is
663.36s: the case here we will see an updated
666.48s: filing from him because he will have to
669.68s: share it within 10 days of this if it
672.60s: was today if it was prior to today
675.12s: whatever day it happens that he drops
676.72s: below that 5% threshold he owes in
679.08s: amended form so we'll see that at some
681.32s: point if that means he sold enough to
683.28s: drop below the 5% threshold then the
685.28s: other thing I imagine would happen is we
686.68s: would see another YOLO update at some
688.32s: point who knows when why or how no idea
690.76s: that's kind of the the tricky part about
692.92s: our friend roran Kitty is he's kind of
694.80s: there he's kind of gone and you never
696.32s: really know which way he's moving which
698.40s: is obviously part of his game so just an
702.24s: absolutely firework day I am as you
704.92s: could tell very engaged because this
706.56s: stuff is fascinating to me it is so fun
709.00s: to look at and try to figure out what's
710.44s: going on with the thought pattern is
711.80s: behind it today I was able to trade the
713.88s: move in GameStop up a little bit and I
716.80s: was hot on the button because I saw this
718.48s: happen with Chewy and I was not going to
721.00s: essentially try to ride this super far
722.84s: just yet I still have my long shares all
724.92s: those positions but I was trading it
726.16s: with options today in a much smaller
727.60s: sense because it just too much movement
730.56s: to to not pay attention to it
733.04s: but man what a day so as always any
737.56s: ideas that you have what's going on any
739.16s: theories anything you think we should
740.52s: take a look at during the live stream
741.96s: tomorrow let me know because I am keen
744.80s: on it I want to dive further into this
747.04s: stuff and try to figure out what's going
748.24s: on cuz it is just too interesting not to
751.20s: as always be an outlier I'll see you all
753.12s: later
