2.24s: what's up everybody Eric here I am back
4.20s: with my friend Matt Caruso from Caruso
6.24s: insights and I am stoked to speak with a
9.52s: stock Trader he always balances me out
11.68s: plus he's Canadian so he's just a nicer
13.28s: human being than I am he's kind of like
15.24s: the the yin to my yang or my yang to the
17.60s: yin I don't know which is which
19.24s: whichever one is the good one that's you
20.88s: I'm the shitty one but welcome back
23.72s: thanks so TR me Eric it's always it's
25.28s: fun to come out here balance you out a
26.64s: bit you balance me out too you keep me
28.04s: going it's good yeah yeah I feel like
30.28s: there's a good mix here so we were
32.88s: talking a little bit before we started
34.48s: recording about uh ideal locations and
37.68s: you were saying that you're getting
38.92s: ready to kick off the gray season for
42.40s: what the next almost half a year how do
44.24s: you feel about that H that's that's you
46.36s: know it's one thing it's it's good for
47.68s: productivity because you know like
48.88s: summertime it's like it's nice outside
50.52s: you want to go out like stock charts
52.00s: they're always fun but a little less fun
54.08s: in summer but so like you guys have to
56.24s: look at the bright side right so the
57.40s: weather's Doom and Gloom for a lot of
59.40s: months here but uh keeps you more
61.32s: connected with the market I guess
62.44s: there's always a silver lining Silver
64.52s: Lining yeah I was going to say bright
65.84s: side not a good use play wordss there
67.88s: because it doesn't seem like there's
68.72s: gonna be a [ __ ] bright side for you
70.08s: for some time but yeah we were joking
72.84s: about that because um for those that
74.40s: don't know I I did my undergrad in
76.92s: Rochester New York which I was too I
80.08s: mean it's like every time I look back at
81.92s: my life I'm reminded at like how dumb I
84.80s: am and we were going to tour the campus
88.88s: and we went through these tunnels and I
91.40s: thought wow like it was so novel to me
93.80s: i' never seen it before so it was so
95.32s: cool because it was novel I was like oh
97.48s: wow they like they have these cool
98.68s: tunnels and they like paint the walls
100.84s: and you know like it's neat and then you
104.00s: know Eric completely missing the message
107.88s: here means that for a good part of the
109.80s: year you're going to be commuting to
111.64s: your classes through a freaking tunnel
114.52s: because the weather is so bad missed
116.48s: that entirely just thought the tunnels
118.00s: were cool so yeah I uh really misread
121.88s: that one I
123.16s: think it's okay passed you made it
125.24s: through college you're good you're good
126.32s: to go that's right I you know what I say
128.80s: now is that if I have kids if it's a boy
131.12s: he can go wherever he wants if it's a
132.68s: girl Rochester right because there's no
135.36s: bikini parties there's no boyfriends
137.16s: there because you're just trying not to
138.20s: become an ice cube it's like exactly
140.40s: what I need in my life so that's what
142.88s: served a
144.72s: purpose talk to me about the markets
147.08s: how's trading been I know specifically I
149.44s: actually just talked to you know I'm
151.60s: sure you Jim ropel I just had him on not
153.64s: long yeah and I was actually singing
156.04s: your Praises um to him because I really
159.12s: like your guys' style of trading it's
161.60s: super fun for me to to learn about to
163.48s: talk about and he was explaining a bit
166.64s: about his Paradigm how things have been
168.36s: going for him you know not great but I'm
170.92s: really curious how you've been fairing
172.92s: with uh with your approach yeah so Jim's
175.68s: a great guy and uh we'll talk every once
177.52s: in a while and he's a wealth of
179.00s: knowledge so he's great that to talk
180.04s: with Jim so you know like I've
182.04s: transitioned over the years like we
183.16s: spoke about it on past calls like I was
184.84s: a day trader for the longest time so I
187.52s: transition to the point where I want to
188.72s: be a position Trader and I want to just
190.12s: kind of change up how I approach things
192.28s: and uh I I remember when I started my
194.52s: when I first started getting into stocks
196.00s: was 2003 I started my career in 08 and I
198.76s: always remember looking at that 2000 to
201.36s: 2002 bar market and not just the depth
204.04s: of it which was was a big bare Market
206.16s: after.com was the time like oh I hope I
208.92s: never like I know somewhere we're going
210.56s: to get this long drawn out type of
212.64s: Market again but I hope it doesn't hit
213.96s: you know so you know transition all
215.64s: these years later I think we finally hit
217.16s: that same kind of Market if if you look
218.96s: past like the um mega cap stocks which
221.40s: is typically just not a focus of mine
222.76s: you know like you have yours I have mine
224.16s: and and you know typically buying
225.52s: Microsoft for uh for you know a couple
227.76s: of percentage points is not what I'm
228.80s: looking at most other stocks have really
230.64s: been soft and so for someone was more
232.88s: kind of long only and I want to position
234.48s: I want to put on size I want to get
236.08s: these bigger moves it's been a boring
238.44s: market and it's really it's been trying
240.08s: my my patience uh in a sense of you know
242.76s: I you know as well as I do it's like
244.64s: discipline is priority number one if
247.00s: you're not disciplin you're GNA fail and
249.20s: so you know my um my goal has been like
252.44s: this is going to be my focus because in
254.08s: the past I've tried to run dual
255.56s: strategies and it's one thing if you're
257.44s: totally systematic like black box kind
259.56s: of thing like you know it could run
260.68s: multip multiple strategies if you have
262.36s: to still
263.32s: interpret mentally it's very difficult
265.56s: to be running a very short-term strategy
267.36s: longer term strategies because you tend
269.04s: to get Focus pissed and sucked into the
270.64s: world of the really short term and then
272.56s: you you're always late for the really
274.92s: important turning point so I promise
277.44s: promise myself a few years back I
279.28s: wouldn't do that again but now this
280.48s: leaves me in this kind of year where you
283.20s: know there's not a lot going on so it
284.84s: leads me in a lot of cash few trades
287.48s: which it's not a painful year it's just
289.40s: a little more of a boring year
290.76s: unfortunately do you do anything with
292.60s: the cash to at least earn something on
294.20s: it yeah I mean I think that's the one
296.00s: good thing about the higher interest
297.00s: rates at least you're you're getting a
299.20s: nice return on your uh your your
300.84s: deposits while you sit and wait you know
302.44s: but um like for someone who who lives
304.72s: who for many years lived for the juice
306.12s: of like you know hundreds of Trades a
307.96s: day it's really kind of testing my my my
311.20s: discipline to kind of just stay focused
312.52s: on what we need to do here yeah it's
314.36s: kind of like it sounds like you're
315.32s: talking about I'm not exactly sure what
317.28s: the experience is like but it sounds
318.76s: kind of like going from like heroin to
320.60s: caffeine you know there's a bit in
324.20s: stimulation I I assume um that's it's
328.00s: really interesting and is always
330.00s: oh I always use this as an opportunity
332.24s: to plug options I know that you were
333.80s: telling me that you started kind of
335.36s: talking a little bit more about them
336.76s: somewhat here and there um with your
338.92s: community which it just elates me it
341.36s: just makes me so happy so I'm I'm stoked
344.88s: on that what do you what are your
346.48s: thoughts though genuinely on like the
348.84s: integration of not even options I don't
351.44s: really care about that but like of
353.56s: another strategy when you find a year
357.00s: because to your point it's a prolong
358.76s: period of time like you're just not
360.60s: getting your pitch so what's the move
363.52s: there do you think that it's better to
365.36s: just wait for your pitch or do you start
367.92s: dusting off the tool belt and grab
369.60s: something else so it really it's an
372.00s: abnormal market like if you go back
373.40s: historically it's very rare you see this
375.00s: kind of stuff but it's it's you know
376.84s: abnormal times breed abnormal markets
378.60s: but you know it'll change but uh you
380.52s: know to your point it's that's one good
382.68s: thing one of the reasons I want to
383.96s: transition away from day trading is like
385.52s: I I'm like a market obsessed guy like I
387.76s: I mean my wife is always on me for
389.04s: buying books and this like it's like a
390.60s: Non-Stop like learning process and so
393.24s: one of the goals I have is um I want to
396.56s: build a smarter way to kind of automate
399.96s: what stocks are going to be the leaders
402.04s: in the next you know three months six
403.48s: months nine months so a lot of you know
405.60s: people will kind of uh look at minimum
408.20s: criteria I want to see a certain amount
409.52s: of relative strength or Price action or
411.40s: be above certain averages or fundamental
413.04s: growth like there's all these variables
414.60s: that in reality as individual Traders
416.56s: we're just looking at this mass of data
419.00s: and we have to through our own
420.16s: experience kind of figure out how they
421.24s: come together together so my goal was uh
424.60s: is was to build like a more intelligent
426.04s: platform to kind of Leverage AI now I
428.36s: know AI is like a very you know kind of
430.44s: generic term days I'm investing now in
432.40s: your business you words you can take all
435.12s: my money I just made a billion dollars
437.28s: no but you know we'll make it happen you
439.08s: said AI I'm I'm pretty sure you should
441.20s: check your email because it's probably
442.56s: there already but the funny thing about
444.92s: AI has been around for the longest time
447.36s: um and and this is not like generative
449.12s: AI so like actually all these alos and
451.08s: hfts and I was building alos for the
453.52s: very short term trading for for a shop
455.72s: like years ago so I was into this AI
458.44s: stuff like way before was AI but you
460.04s: know ignoring what everyone thinks AI is
462.28s: today just the kind of blackbox element
464.68s: to it like the neural networks like more
466.12s: advanced stuff I have someone who we
467.68s: built this neural network and my goal is
470.32s: to kind of run through this data and
472.04s: build algorithms to really identify like
474.12s: okay these are the variables that are
475.76s: most predictive how do they come
478.16s: together like so each day you're you're
480.52s: always dealing with the same variables
482.36s: but each stock has different you know
484.52s: different amounts like this says more
485.72s: earnings Less sales or Better Price
487.80s: action so like how do we go from these
489.84s: 10,000 stocks to like I want a short
491.76s: list of 20 and I want this 20 short list
494.44s: to be like quantitatively driven I'll do
496.28s: the rest but I want all this work done
498.24s: so I've been working on that a lot
501.08s: that's been a big focus of mine so to
502.92s: your point of like running multiple
504.20s: strategies I do I just want to do it
506.52s: intelligently and so my goal is to kind
508.48s: of start the automate this stuff and I
510.80s: read this really good book by Tom basso
513.16s: he's one of the uh kind of original Mark
515.20s: Wizards Alla the all weather Trader
517.44s: intervie yeah oh you interviewed him
519.48s: okay great yeah Tom's great and and he
521.48s: runs like so many strategies so he's
524.48s: like The Other Extreme right and so my
526.64s: goal is to kind of take a lot of what
528.00s: I'm trying to do now as position trading
529.40s: growth growth investing but take it more
531.48s: intelligently and kind of get that
532.72s: Equity curve smoother more effective uh
535.92s: make it easier and so that's like I'm
537.72s: trying to take this time to do that but
538.88s: my goal goal going forward like one year
540.68s: two year three years is to be able to
542.76s: run like at least a couple of versions
544.24s: of the strategy
546.44s: simultaneously I think well especially
548.36s: when you talk about like smoothing
549.80s: returns to your point that is one of the
551.96s: the fascinating things I find about your
554.04s: your approach versus my Approach right
555.88s: where you've had some triple digit years
558.96s: like deep triple digit years right which
561.64s: that is I've never seen that but almost
565.32s: every single year for me I know right
567.60s: out of the gate it'll be over % I know
570.80s: that almost with certainty it's been
572.28s: like that for the last decade plus um so
575.72s: it's like the ability to replicate and
578.24s: then scale that I think has been really
580.08s: useful to me and it's interesting to see
581.56s: you kind of moving at least somewhat a
584.12s: little bit of that direction so it leads
585.56s: me to what What's the hypothesis then it
588.32s: seems like the majority of like the can
590.48s: slim style of trading to your point is
592.68s: looking for these big runs right so then
596.40s: what's the overall thesis on how you
598.68s: stream streamline returns if that's the
601.48s: main effort to achieve your
604.12s: returns yeah I think um so there's so
607.64s: there's different ways like so I'm
608.84s: really trying to kind of like
610.16s: deconstruct the strategy like I've spent
612.32s: years with it and so like all the stuff
613.84s: I learned as a day trader and swing
615.48s: Trader and and running this kind of like
617.80s: like pic cassle like take all the
619.00s: objects but make them you know bring
620.76s: them down to their elements you know and
623.08s: so it's you know there's different ways
625.08s: like like William O'Neal Who kind of
626.52s: obviously literally wrote the book on it
628.60s: he was a stock guy it's like I'm gonna
630.36s: find my stock and he was if you think
632.00s: I'm concentrated I mean his story is is
633.88s: like he was like 200% invested in AMJ in
635.96s: the 90s like like ridiculous returns you
638.68s: know and so he was a very all-in kind of
641.16s: guy but you know like markets have
643.08s: progressed that's one way of doing it I
644.72s: I think there's kind of different like I
646.00s: love Ray doio where or Tom Bass about
648.44s: like
649.40s: diversification H to minimize
651.20s: correlations between stocks to like make
652.88s: it like a better uh system to live with
655.36s: so my goal is to kind of take the heart
657.44s: of William O'Neal and and everything
659.60s: he's doing but find ways to systemize it
662.04s: more to bring in these other elements
663.60s: you know like I mean bill was a Maverick
665.04s: he was he was a hot shot and he was amaz
667.80s: not everyone has that skill so like I I
669.60s: really want to try and for myself and
672.08s: for others that you know that that work
673.60s: with me and also you know in the future
675.52s: I'd like to maybe run some money where
677.16s: it could be more of an automated process
678.76s: I've never got into because I know my
680.00s: process is very concentrated it doesn't
681.40s: lend well to like other people's money
683.52s: like investors and all of this kind of
685.08s: stuff so the goal is to kind of
686.52s: systemize and get to that and to do that
688.44s: you really need this this bigger process
691.16s: um to go from like just like a Maverick
692.92s: Trader to like okay this is now a system
695.00s: and we're able to leverage that and and
696.80s: focus so that's that's what I'm working
698.60s: towards yeah well I mean obviously Jim
701.04s: was able to figure out the funding part
702.96s: right even with kind of that canum style
705.20s: so I think there's something to be said
707.72s: about the way that it can be positioned
709.12s: for people that believe in it I think
711.16s: you also bring up a good point though on
713.40s: you know like being 200% invested in
715.40s: something like Amen in a single stock
717.28s: because the issue I see with those kinds
720.08s: of stories is that it's just from a
724.36s: statistical standpoint survivorship bias
726.80s: like hands down because if you take
728.92s: 50,000 other people who put on 200% and
732.08s: they pick the wrong [ __ ] stock you
734.28s: know what I mean so to me when I see
737.04s: stuff like that and you know and that's
738.96s: not to besmer his capacity whatsoever he
742.24s: to your point he was incredible he found
743.84s: a way to pick the right ones yeah but as
746.20s: we think about something that's scalable
748.08s: reable and something that can be you
750.96s: know applied to a broader audience
753.68s: that's real tough man especially to be
755.60s: that centralized and the the way that um
760.84s: Tom trades is actually it's actually
762.88s: funny because whenever I talk to him he
765.44s: and I almost have not the same positions
767.88s: but a lot of the same positions on and
770.72s: we follow I what I would consider to be
773.84s: kind of like a very simplified rule set
776.24s: so I'm pretty eager to see what you up
779.20s: with because you're super [ __ ] smart
782.48s: and I think the way that you look at the
783.84s: problem set is interesting to me because
785.76s: I do think there's there's room out
789.64s: there for something that's generly
792.88s: replicable but then also has a smaller
795.76s: component to it that you can get home
797.24s: runs with I'm interested to see how you
799.40s: kind of combine yeah see for me it's
801.28s: it's like how do you become how do you
803.36s: become a a a rep replicable home run
806.36s: hitter you know how do you how do you
807.96s: pull that that's and the thing with Bill
809.68s: and you're so right about the
810.68s: survivorship bias I mean I've had my
812.84s: difficult times I I was never
814.44s: concentrated as much as bill was but the
816.28s: thing about Bill is you know you can do
818.48s: it once you can do it twice he had a
819.84s: career of 50 years of doing this so so
821.96s: he had and and he tried to share as much
824.56s: as he could and it's hard to replicate
826.08s: but he had this innate skill so it it's
829.08s: to me it's like he proved it is doable
831.24s: it's like almost virtually impossible
832.96s: it's like saying how many guys are
834.16s: Michael Jordan there's only a few right
835.64s: I mean so but it can be done it's like
838.16s: you know the the 4 minute mile no one
839.60s: thought you could you could break it
840.68s: then one guy does and then suddenly
842.08s: everyone starts to do it kind of thing
844.24s: so my goal is kind of like again it's
846.52s: like you said like trying to figure out
848.48s: what's the problem here so instead of
850.84s: doing like Bill being 200% in one stock
853.08s: and I know you're an options guy but
854.72s: through your experience you've been
855.56s: doing this long enough every bull market
857.40s: there's always that 10 20 stocks that
860.12s: that are like the outstanding positions
862.48s: to own like I mean there's those 20
864.56s: stocks that will return 300% return then
868.20s: you you like do like a whole like step
869.84s: lower and everyone's at that you know 30
871.52s: 40% return like there's their whole
873.28s: magnitude of returns higher so if I
875.84s: could find those 20 stocks or short
878.64s: listed down to 30 and 20 of those 30 are
881.04s: going to be these epic winners well
883.24s: you've like simplified like a huge
886.04s: amount of the process because then after
887.44s: once you you have this short list you
889.68s: can figure out even like options head
891.36s: there's different ways you can kind of
892.72s: concentrate to leverage that but then
894.60s: diversify risk away a little bit so like
896.60s: for me it's like I'm really trying to
897.72s: tackle this with a really big goal and
900.36s: like I haven't even spoken to anybody
901.56s: about this like outside of like my team
903.08s: so you're like the first guy I'm
904.12s: actually kind of getting into this with
906.04s: but but you know everyone starts with
908.12s: this one problem you have this huge mass
910.52s: of stocks who do you choose you know and
912.76s: the variables will change over time and
915.04s: so but if you can short list I mean wow
917.44s: you've really like kind of brought
918.96s: yourself Way Forward in like the game of
921.16s: of getting to that you know home run
923.16s: type of scenario and you can do it with
925.44s: you can do with a little more
926.24s: diversification if there's 20 stocks and
928.32s: you have 10 you know 10 stocks is fairly
930.48s: Diversified you know like there's most
932.20s: even uh large mutual funds like 10
934.64s: stocks is usually like 50 60% of their
936.64s: portfolio so I mean once you can get to
938.44s: that 10 range plus there's a fair amount
941.24s: of diversification it's not all in on
943.08s: one stock how do you view the problem
946.76s: set in terms
948.88s: of what's more achievable for you I look
952.76s: at it this way if you're talking about
955.12s: the entire population of the stock
956.92s: market and you're trying to it down
959.60s: essentially to the you know 20 or 30 top
962.28s: performers that's one way to solve the
964.52s: problem another way that comes to my
966.84s: mind as you're talking about it is what
968.64s: if there's a way to expand the hit Zone
972.52s: but then use something like here I go
974.88s: pitching options use something like
977.68s: options to add the leverage to then
981.00s: still compete with the top 20% but you
984.36s: only need something that moves again in
986.44s: that middle tier that you're talking
987.84s: about cuz I think about like the
989.52s: probabilistic outcome of you know if
991.12s: there's 20 to 30 names of picking the
993.64s: majority of those you probably could do
996.32s: ex your smart as [ __ ] but like I look at
998.52s: that and I say [ __ ] that looks real hard
1001.16s: and I try to bring the game down to my
1004.36s: level the Neanderthal level and I try to
1008.60s: figure out like okay if you've
1010.88s: identified that there's that middle Zone
1013.16s: where there's maybe a 100 stocks now if
1016.40s: you get a mix of anything from that 100
1019.20s: stocks all the way up to the 20 it seems
1021.72s: like with the right positions you could
1024.24s: still achieve a good return is that
1027.08s: something you've considered or you like
1028.88s: how do you view that tradeoff between a
1032.40s: really small hit Zone but a [ __ ]
1035.40s: if you can hit it of a home run versus a
1038.00s: slightly
1039.36s: wider yeah you know like so part of the
1041.60s: study I want to do is like my personal
1044.08s: preference and this is why again I would
1045.36s: just manage my own money because I I
1046.72s: like to look for the big home runs which
1048.12s: is harder to do and there's more
1049.80s: volatility with it but my my aim in the
1052.52s: study is to like you know that's my goal
1054.64s: like how can I replicate other common
1057.16s: goals like you're talking like about
1058.80s: something let's say with a a uh we'll
1061.64s: assume it's like a better uh sharp ratio
1064.16s: something that's like a little more
1065.56s: stable uh but there's still sizable
1067.76s: returns maybe you lever it up or you
1069.12s: hedge it out another way so like the
1070.48s: point of the study is going to be to
1071.56s: like how can we figure out what stocks
1075.04s: represent these different opportunity
1076.76s: sets and and again if you if you dial
1079.56s: down like the level of Awesomeness if
1081.28s: you're not looking for Jordan you're
1082.24s: just looking for like a good NBA player
1084.16s: well now yeah you have a much bigger
1085.32s: data set you're more likely to hit it
1086.68s: but there's still one other problem that
1088.00s: you have to identify and um again this
1091.40s: is I think where it helps to have have
1094.00s: traded for a long time before doing
1095.92s: research because most people who do
1097.32s: research are like academics so they
1099.56s: don't get markets you know so like you
1101.80s: can look at the data you can average
1103.08s: stuff out but markets don't work in
1104.68s: averages there's periods of time where
1106.36s: it's wow rock and roll every everything
1108.64s: moves and and other times where you can
1111.40s: average it out over the whole data set
1112.72s: you don't notice it but like for example
1114.20s: the past year and a half two years it's
1115.88s: awful there's nothing nothing going on
1117.40s: or big losses so part of it is going to
1120.28s: be how do I identify the best
1122.24s: environment to operate in like this is a
1123.76s: high it's like you're counting cards of
1125.12s: blackj right you know okay we got a
1126.80s: positive deck now's time to I don't know
1128.32s: if I'm gonna get 21 next hand but now's
1130.40s: the time to kind of start betting big
1132.52s: and so there's that element of it too
1134.00s: which is going to be part of the study
1135.16s: as well is to kind of figure out not
1136.56s: just who are going to be the best stock
1138.64s: or you know how can we identify the
1140.32s: mid-tier stocks what's a good time to
1142.48s: operate in so once you kind of put these
1144.60s: even if these are like I think of them
1146.08s: as like the big puzzle pieces so if you
1148.80s: have this like you know trading can be
1150.20s: comp super complex but if you want to
1152.48s: simplify it and like and and you know I
1154.20s: know you joke that um I talk about a lot
1156.60s: of things but at the end of the day
1157.60s: trading has to be simple I mean you can
1159.48s: come to it with like a complex view but
1161.76s: when you get to the the bottom you know
1163.72s: uh end of the story like it's got to be
1165.36s: simple so to me that those are the most
1168.52s: important elements of the puzzle like
1170.08s: which stock when's the right time if you
1172.64s: get those two things right the rest is
1174.36s: just about like how do you want to go
1175.56s: about your strategy like those are the
1177.28s: two things you need to figure out yeah I
1179.96s: love that and that's a really fun kind
1182.12s: of I wouldn't even call it a problem to
1184.36s: solve because it's not so much a problem
1185.96s: but yeah it's like a conditional
1188.32s: environment to establish it's that stuff
1190.76s: fascinates me because I I talk about
1192.48s: this in my community a lot but like I
1194.56s: have spent more money than I cared to
1196.76s: share on just Market data so I typically
1200.48s: buy minute level full Greek market data
1203.52s: from sibo and anybody can go figure out
1205.68s: how much that is for tickers it's
1207.48s: obnoxious but I love I love looking at
1210.36s: stuff like you're talking about you hit
1212.96s: on one thing though that actually I've
1215.04s: been working on a lot which is kind of
1218.88s: classifying broad market regimes and the
1221.88s: traits of different market regimes for
1223.80s: those
1224.52s: environments how do you view that
1227.20s: problem set when you're talking about
1228.64s: something like finding like a good
1230.04s: environment to operate in obviously the
1232.16s: broad Market regime matters to you how
1234.24s: do you think about analyzing that so
1237.60s: this is something like we all do it like
1240.20s: like like I I spent a lot of time like
1242.12s: sitting down to articulate this because
1243.52s: if you start dealing with programmers
1245.00s: even like my the guy I'm working super
1247.00s: intelligent guy you know but they're
1249.04s: like black and white okay tell me what
1250.36s: we're looking at so it's like it's up to
1251.88s: you to kind of break this apart but if
1253.92s: you stop even yourself like you're
1255.48s: looking at this data you're looking
1257.56s: you're you're counting cards you know
1258.96s: you want to know when's my high
1259.96s: probability environment we're we're all
1261.48s: doing whether it's a f minute chart
1263.28s: whether you want to build a position for
1264.44s: nine months again I've used the same
1266.08s: tools for drastically different jobs of
1268.92s: like trading in my career it's just
1270.76s: about how you you structure your process
1273.44s: so um so for me like like trying to
1275.84s: approach that environment level like my
1278.56s: current view is trying to cat these
1280.20s: winners for multiple months but there
1282.56s: you know depending on what you're you're
1284.84s: aiming at like for example if you're
1286.36s: looking at day trading or one or two day
1287.80s: TR the environment you're looking at is
1289.48s: going to be a little bit different
1290.48s: there's always like the the bigger
1292.68s: elements will impact everything like if
1294.28s: the Federal Reserve is like providing
1296.20s: liquidity or lowering interest rates
1297.96s: that helps everything kind of edge
1299.44s: higher but you know depending on what
1301.88s: you're trying to capture that
1303.00s: environment you're going to have to
1304.08s: figure out what is the best environment
1305.52s: for you and that's what we all have to
1306.80s: kind of figure out for ourselves
1307.88s: depending the
1309.12s: strategy yeah it's to me it's a really
1311.88s: fun problem to try to solve because to
1314.48s: your point you said it earlier and it's
1315.96s: stuck with me because it's a fascinating
1318.76s: problem to consider you know that right
1321.92s: now you feel like the current markets
1323.44s: are anomalous right that this is
1325.36s: abnormal and my view typically is like
1328.92s: the market is what it is what's normal
1331.08s: or abnormal doesn't really [ __ ]
1332.68s: matter because I've learned that the
1337.00s: periods you know it's kind of like the
1338.48s: same thing from Nim TB that he talks
1340.76s: about where uncommon things happen way
1343.40s: more frequently than we understand so
1346.68s: when you look at anal izing like this
1349.36s: kind of Market I agree with you that
1351.80s: there's like a Confluence of crazy [ __ ]
1356.00s: all at the same time that I never would
1358.20s: have guessed I literally never would
1359.60s: have guessed this but then I always look
1362.12s: at how many times I felt that way and
1365.92s: how frequently different variations of
1369.96s: abnormal pop up at the same time so it
1372.28s: almost creates this repeat pattern of
1374.76s: abnormal behavior so to pull on that
1377.20s: thread a little bit to understand your
1378.96s: perspective how do you view like a
1382.16s: normal market quote unquote broad cont
1385.08s: context versus an abnormal market so
1388.32s: it's a really good question like um if
1391.36s: you stop and think about it okay and a
1393.12s: lot of people will say like if they look
1394.24s: at a Dow Jones chart or anything NASDAQ
1396.32s: charts how how could this Market keep
1398.20s: going up all like how does that make any
1400.20s: sense it's like it's uh people say scam
1402.48s: doesn't make sense think about it every
1404.16s: year the FED wants that they say stable
1407.24s: prices is 2% inflation that to me that's
1409.76s: not stable that's inflation stable
1411.36s: should be zero right but they they say
1412.92s: we want 2% to make sure we don't go into
1415.24s: deflation okay so that's the Federal
1416.88s: Reserve says 2% on top of that you you
1419.08s: typically have productivity so everyone
1421.40s: every year we we figure out how to do
1422.76s: things better smarter hopefully as a
1424.20s: society so that's another two two and a
1425.68s: half percent so every year you have at
1427.76s: least a four and a half percent uh push
1431.28s: on stock prices up if everything else
1433.92s: nothing else changes everything's okay
1435.44s: so on top of that um
1438.64s: there's this like kind of virtuous
1440.76s: circle and vicious circle of credit so
1443.52s: when things are going well Banks lend
1445.20s: more people spend more then people have
1447.48s: higher incomes they spend more they
1448.76s: borrow more and things go up up up so
1450.56s: that four and a half percent turns into
1452.56s: 12% and that's why you have these these
1454.52s: typical 12% years but every so often the
1457.52s: cycle breaks people get out of hand
1459.36s: there's something like you're saying
1460.56s: anomalous yeah you're right it's always
1461.84s: something different right 2011 was the
1463.48s: European like you were calling the pigs
1465.32s: the debt problem you know 20 there's was
1468.00s: a trade War there's always something
1469.04s: different but something comes along to
1471.28s: snap this credit and puts it into
1473.12s: reverse maybe inflation picks up
1475.28s: whatever and so then you go through this
1476.80s: period where we have to kind of like
1478.56s: squeeze back down to to to you know
1481.88s: reverse gear and and once it's we get
1483.84s: back into line we go back into the
1485.76s: normal thing of things you know assuming
1487.88s: capitalism stays in place and freedoms
1489.72s: and and all the rest you know so so
1491.64s: that's why over time so we have these
1493.32s: normal I call them normal periods but
1494.84s: they call them growth periods where
1496.84s: there's no system mic problem people are
1499.24s: happy people are spending more which
1500.68s: makes people spend more and you know the
1502.24s: life we live most people are just
1503.68s: worried about living a good life and
1505.28s: that equals Rising stock markets for two
1507.72s: three four years gets out of hand
1510.36s: something snaps and it's bad crazy
1512.44s: markets for six months nine months this
1514.24s: case is longer once it finishes washing
1516.32s: out problem solved okay we go back into
1518.08s: our path and people say well how could
1520.32s: you keep going like I said the FED wants
1522.32s: 2% inflation they want and there's
1524.32s: naturally productivity growth so it and
1526.20s: then there's credit expans so it does
1528.40s: make sense logically that we have these
1530.76s: nice Trends so my goal is to like how do
1533.00s: you participate in those happy times and
1535.76s: as much as possible like step away or
1537.64s: hedge away those nasty times when we're
1539.96s: kind of getting back to uh you know a
1542.92s: lower reality so that that's that's how
1544.84s: I in my mind kind of segregate the two
1547.36s: because yeah you can't you're right
1548.88s: there's always going to be something but
1550.80s: if you look at Marcus there's the you
1552.24s: could I mean look at the vix right so
1554.00s: there's the low vix regime that's Happy
1556.04s: Times there's a high vix regime it's
1557.68s: it's crazy times it could be different
1559.36s: reasons but if you can avoid those crazy
1562.68s: times or minimize them or whatever
1564.04s: you're you know big way away and hi vix
1566.96s: regimes are shorter in nature you have
1568.76s: to panic things happen politicians
1570.84s: finally get off their their the chair
1572.68s: they okay I got to fix something I'm
1573.84s: gonna lose my job and things get fixed
1576.08s: and then we kind of go back into normaly
1577.72s: so that that's how I separate the
1579.24s: regimes inmore yeah it's it's honestly a
1582.28s: really beautiful way to describe it I
1583.80s: love the way that you described the
1585.52s: expansionary element of the economy
1587.80s: because that's something I actually have
1589.72s: struggled to explain to people before as
1592.24s: effectively as you did in terms of like
1594.56s: why there's positive drift in the stock
1596.44s: market right it's the same exact first
1597.88s: part of the question you answered there
1600.28s: um which is I I really like the way that
1602.72s: you phrase that I think it makes a lot
1604.08s: of sense that's easy for people to
1606.04s: comprehend when you are analyzing the
1609.36s: markets so going back to kind of this
1612.08s: thesis that you have and trying to
1614.48s: dissect things to qualify these
1617.96s: different regimes how do you view
1621.84s: periodicity so how far back are you
1624.52s: trying to qualify and then are you
1627.04s: applying some sort of waiting factor for
1629.32s: the more recent times versus the more
1631.48s: distant times I know this is a little
1633.24s: bit more in the weeds but the reason why
1634.60s: I'm asking is because I literally am
1636.12s: working on the same stuff so when I'm
1638.76s: looking at the different regimes I
1642.00s: found the window that we analyze is
1646.76s: obviously super important and it's very
1651.00s: very difficult for me to look back at
1653.20s: some of the previous events and say oh
1655.32s: well you know it's unlikely we would see
1657.80s: that again but there's always some
1659.76s: version of that so then you have to
1663.00s: figure out structurally how to wait the
1667.12s: that and then to be able to kind of
1670.32s: classify things in a more recent sense
1672.20s: so to kind of summarize the question
1675.28s: when you're looking at you know your
1676.92s: data set to to create these
1678.40s: qualifications what period are you
1680.28s: looking at and then how do you view the
1682.12s: different periods time frame that you're
1683.64s: looking at so it's like anything else
1686.24s: right when it comes to numbers the more
1687.92s: you have like the more proof there is
1690.40s: that it's likely to continue and uh you
1692.96s: know one thing that's really interesting
1694.16s: about kind of working with with the guy
1695.60s: I'm working with who's he's like this
1696.96s: math like Wizard and he's always telling
1699.20s: me Matt he's like Matt you know he's
1700.32s: like you want to keep as few variables
1702.16s: as possible they may not be the best
1704.00s: outcome but they're more likely to to
1705.92s: stay true for longer you know he's like
1707.48s: or else all all you're doing is making
1708.84s: the computer like memorize the data and
1711.28s: it's like it's like studying for a test
1712.76s: you don't actually study the material
1713.92s: you just study like a b or c and that
1716.44s: exact same test you can get 100 on but
1718.24s: if the questions are changed in any way
1719.56s: you fail you know so so like that's kind
1721.80s: of that's always it's stuck with me the
1723.08s: way he kind of explained that to me and
1725.04s: so like there to me there's there's
1726.20s: certain principles like you look back
1727.84s: that are just true of the market like I
1729.28s: spoke about like the Federal Reserve and
1730.92s: you can go back to like when the Federal
1732.48s: Reserve even before the federal the gold
1734.12s: standard like I like monetary history
1735.80s: I'm weird that way I'm think one of the
1737.20s: few few guys who gets excited about
1738.44s: reading about like monetary conditions
1740.08s: 100 years ago but the same stuff that
1742.72s: led to the 1907 crash is the same stuff
1746.60s: that leads to that's leading to this
1748.12s: current situation it's a the way money
1750.08s: flows happen so there's there's like
1751.80s: high level stuff that's always true but
1754.44s: then after there's certain things that
1755.92s: change you know that like at least the
1757.76s: tools and sometimes the DAT really
1759.88s: readily available oh one second I think
1762.20s: my myone
1764.08s: changed we
1766.32s: go problem but we're back okay so like
1770.04s: so so like there at some point even it's
1771.92s: it's interesting like one of the data
1773.40s: points I look at is new 52e highs versus
1775.80s: new 52e lows and for that you need like
1778.60s: a deep data set because you need to know
1780.20s: all the Securities that are listed and
1781.92s: so you know it's funny like maybe it's
1784.08s: me getting older but I feel like the
1785.96s: year 2000 wasn't that long ago but like
1788.24s: data from the 90s and 80s is like hard
1789.96s: to come by it's not as readily available
1791.68s: you know so there's some tools that are
1793.88s: just it's hard you can't back test them
1796.08s: you can't really check them the same way
1797.32s: way going back a 100 years ago it's hard
1798.88s: to get the kind of data and all that you
1800.28s: know so so I think it's like you want to
1802.56s: have like the high level stuff and then
1804.76s: after you want the data and the tools
1807.00s: for the changing markets and and I think
1810.32s: it's you're never like oneand done
1812.24s: because like for example like before
1814.32s: 2000 um you know inside our trading not
1817.64s: that it was legal but like you know reg
1819.32s: reg regulation FD came out in 2000 and
1821.92s: now you have all these massive gaps on
1823.60s: earnings which you didn't have before
1825.00s: because the market changed you know hfts
1827.08s: are a new phenomenon so you have to
1829.36s: always kind of understand the tools that
1831.28s: you're using how susceptible are they to
1834.12s: kind of breaking if like an actual
1836.16s: Market Dynamic changes so to me there's
1837.84s: like certain principles that are
1839.56s: Everlasting like you know like monetary
1841.32s: conditions and then there's different
1842.20s: tools about how you go about measuring
1844.08s: things if you're going to build
1845.40s: something systematic you know you want
1847.12s: to keep it simple and you really want to
1849.36s: understand what's driving it because if
1851.52s: that snaps well you got to know you know
1853.24s: what I mean so um that's like I don't
1855.52s: know if I answered your question
1856.60s: correctly but that's kind of like how I
1858.08s: think about it well there's two things
1860.36s: the first thing is I actually think
1863.04s: about it the same exact way so when I'm
1866.12s: going through and I'm trying to qualify
1867.60s: the different Market regimes I'm not
1869.24s: looking to replicate the individual
1872.40s: anomalies that are popping up in each
1874.68s: thread but I'm looking to understand the
1878.16s: quality of the anomaly and then to apply
1880.16s: a waiting to it and then I use that and
1882.72s: that's actually worked really well for
1883.96s: me so it's interesting that you're going
1885.44s: down that that thread because I think
1887.72s: that that's a really fair approach and I
1889.48s: think it works about as good as you can
1891.44s: get because to your point I think one of
1893.44s: the issues I found is that the impacts
1896.28s: of different events changed drastically
1899.60s: based on even the market structure at a
1901.52s: point how many participants are there
1903.04s: what's the daily volume of the market
1904.88s: like all of that stuff has an impact on
1908.44s: how that event impacts the markets so
1912.12s: that makes a lot of sense and then I
1913.36s: also did want to um definitely reaffirm
1916.56s: that you are pretty pretty [ __ ] weird
1918.24s: for enjoying you know Market monetary
1921.00s: policy and structure from 100 years ago
1923.84s: I consider myself a bit of a nerd but I
1926.84s: would not quite say that it excites me
1929.92s: but now I know that if I ever need to
1931.84s: talk dirty to you I'm GNA break out my
1933.80s: monetary policy speak and then get you
1935.72s: going that way so that's good it's good
1937.48s: to know your turn on it's funny you know
1939.68s: I used I used to be in a band you know
1941.12s: we used to play guitar and all this kind
1942.40s: of stuff so it's like I'd be going to
1943.56s: practice I would but from like a young
1945.64s: age I was obsessed with this kind of
1946.92s: stuff so it's like I'd be reading like
1948.60s: Ludwig von mes which is like an Austrian
1950.44s: Economist from like yeah many decades
1953.00s: ago and it's like very like deep like
1955.76s: mon like you know monetary type of tools
1958.28s: and so it's like I'd wrap that up and
1959.76s: okay let's go play some like mle crew
1961.12s: and guns and& roses you know so it's I
1962.84s: don't know we all have our I I swing
1964.76s: between guns and& roses and monetary
1966.68s: policy as my my Pleasures it's good I I
1970.04s: definitely think that they offer
1971.12s: balanced to one
1973.68s: another so talk to me about the way
1977.72s: you've viewed the markets this year and
1979.84s: the reason why I want to touch on this
1981.04s: is because we had a chance to cover some
1982.92s: of this the last time we spoke for a lot
1984.84s: of like my friends like I I generally do
1986.84s: consider you a friend I try to like get
1988.72s: you guys on periodically because it's
1990.56s: really fascinating to me to catch a
1992.16s: snapshot of how we think about things
1994.56s: and then how it progresses so yeah talk
1996.80s: about the markets RIT large what do you
1998.28s: think about them so this is something
2000.60s: like that I've terms I've come to I
2002.32s: haven't seen other people kind of talk
2003.68s: about it this way but like I feel really
2005.04s: confident like I've been going over and
2006.32s: over with this for a while I actually
2007.68s: had dinner with a bunch of the guys from
2009.40s: the trading desk we we still get
2010.80s: together at least I least we try once a
2012.72s: year and I was you know pitching them
2014.16s: this idea and they hadn't heard it
2015.32s: before either but there's this huge
2017.64s: disconnect between the NASDAQ 100 and
2019.84s: everything else this year like
2020.84s: everyone's talking about it and there's
2022.08s: some guys will say like ah who cares you
2024.00s: know what I mean it's up anyways you
2025.16s: know you're complaining because you
2026.00s: didn't catch it then other people are
2027.08s: going to say you know what do you talk
2028.12s: what kind of a bull market is like seven
2029.52s: or eight stocks etc etc but I think this
2032.72s: Dynamic going Beyond why these stocks
2035.28s: went up nothing else did I I think I
2037.00s: think there's a strong reason and it's
2038.20s: never happened before like in in modern
2041.36s: ever in the in the history so if you
2043.28s: think about every kind of um bad Market
2046.88s: event where do people go so the markets
2049.04s: worry is bad the economy looks bad you
2051.24s: go to bonds bonds are safe backed by the
2053.56s: US government and um that's where you go
2056.16s: now people say look at the 70s you know
2058.00s: bonds fell too because there was
2059.20s: inflation and the market also fell yes
2062.04s: and so why is it different this time
2064.04s: well I think one markets have become
2066.44s: more sophis icated and I think
2068.64s: institutional investors looked at
2070.28s: themselves they saw the inflation they
2071.80s: said I can't go to bonds I don't want to
2073.76s: be in general stocks but Microsoft is
2076.32s: pretty much as close as you get to a
2077.88s: bond like their future cash flows are
2079.88s: fairly consistent I mean it's as close
2082.24s: so like Financial engineering has come a
2084.08s: long way so I think investors have been
2087.04s: using like the big cap Tech as their
2089.12s: like their bond proxy like you know like
2091.08s: they can you know they figure like
2092.00s: Microsoft could adjust prices for
2093.56s: inflation it's like Smooth returns for
2096.32s: like the next five or 10 years like you
2097.96s: know Microsoft Office is not going
2099.48s: anywhere and so we can't buy bonds so
2101.88s: everyone rushed into Apple Microsoft
2105.32s: Google because they figure it's super
2107.28s: liquid it's uh it's it's um they have
2110.68s: very predictable cash flows and they're
2112.96s: kind of inflation protected so it ends
2114.52s: up being kind of this new Bond proxy so
2118.36s: it's it's created this really weird
2119.84s: dynamic because there's such a big part
2121.48s: of the market where everything's falling
2123.72s: bonds are falling like you know all most
2125.72s: stocks are falling yet the index is
2127.40s: going the NASDAQ 100's like going up and
2129.68s: you can just see if if it's the NASDAQ
2131.44s: 100 it's up like 30 plus percent this
2133.04s: year the S&P is up like 16 then if you
2135.24s: go to small Caps or negative on the year
2137.20s: and you could just see like the further
2138.32s: you get away from this like Safe Haven
2140.16s: status of stocks the worse your returns
2142.20s: are on the year so it's a really odd
2144.72s: year and I think there's going to be
2145.76s: repercussions going forward because
2148.28s: think about it like once the problems
2149.80s: are solved once inflation is peaked and
2151.88s: you know the worst of like you know we
2153.08s: think the econom is going to turn around
2154.96s: I think we're going to see this kind of
2155.92s: go backwards so like all these funds
2157.60s: were you know hanging out in Microsoft
2159.36s: and Apple and you know the valuations
2161.28s: are staying High versus everything else
2163.48s: at some point bonds are going to become
2165.36s: attractive again because they're so beat
2166.88s: down and there'll be that swing up and
2168.60s: all these small stocks that you know
2169.88s: have been obliterated in a better
2171.12s: economy are going to come back and so
2172.92s: there I think there's gonna be this
2173.84s: weird point in time where the NASDAQ
2176.00s: will kind of not go anywhere but that
2178.60s: money will rotate out of these like
2180.36s: icebergs of like Microsoft and Apple go
2183.04s: and everything else will have a huge
2184.28s: bull market under the surface so this
2185.80s: year was kind of confusing because the
2187.96s: NASDAQ 100 gave this I think
2190.20s: false uh vision of what's going on in
2192.76s: the marketplace because of this Safe
2194.24s: Haven status and equivalently another
2196.72s: time it'll look like oh the Market's
2197.84s: doing nothing but there's a huge bull
2199.00s: market and nobody's going to know it
2200.12s: because they're just looking at these
2201.36s: five stocks which are not going anywhere
2202.84s: anymore because they're fully priced so
2204.80s: that's why I think this is a really
2206.04s: weird year because uh it's never really
2208.68s: happened before never there's never been
2210.40s: five stocks that make up like half of an
2212.96s: index with predictable cash flows and
2215.16s: that are so system like like America's
2217.08s: literally never had that kind of
2219.16s: situation before so that's why I think
2220.92s: this year is such a weird year because
2222.56s: these stocks took the place of
2224.48s: bonds it's a really interesting
2226.92s: perspective I actually think that I mean
2229.32s: the jives really well with what we're
2231.16s: seeing if you look at something like the
2232.84s: S&P 500 you know 28% of that index is it
2236.68s: so even the 10% that that's up on the
2239.76s: year very heavily attributable to to
2242.68s: Tech so I think that makes a lot of
2244.04s: sense and I also agree with your thesis
2246.04s: not that whether I agree or not matters
2247.88s: but I do agree with your thesis on small
2251.36s: caps and
2253.08s: bonds for me I view the FED pivot to be
2258.20s: the point in time where those would kind
2259.80s: of have the foot lifted off their neck
2261.56s: what do you think about that yeah I
2263.68s: think so I I think it's once like
2265.72s: everyone's confident inflation is peak
2267.24s: and the FED can go easy all this is
2269.36s: going to go into reverse you know and I
2271.36s: know like and look I'm a like a
2273.24s: technical analyst first like I mean for
2274.84s: years I day traded like I I know symbol
2276.92s: and not what the company does all pretty
2278.92s: much like just a broad industry kind of
2280.36s: thing so some people say like man this
2282.00s: guy's really overthinking it but there
2283.60s: there's one thing I've noticed for
2285.52s: myself because I like the position I
2287.20s: like to go in size I've always made
2289.36s: money trading but I've always made like
2291.48s: by far the biggest money like the
2293.08s: outlier you speaking of outlier like the
2295.40s: the outlier returns is when I had a a
2298.52s: good idea of what I thought was going to
2300.00s: happen and then it worked out that way
2301.88s: because like think about it it's like
2304.20s: you know you could make money in a lot
2305.56s: of markets but When You're Expecting
2307.68s: things to play out a certain way and
2309.12s: you're prepared for it I mean you have
2310.76s: the size on you have the right movements
2312.44s: you know what you're expecting you know
2313.60s: what to buy and so you're doing
2315.16s: everything right and so you have this
2317.32s: massive year like I mean I've had like
2319.92s: really big months you know just even
2321.60s: just one or two quarters where it's like
2322.96s: man this is what's going to happen for
2324.08s: these these reasons perfectly positioned
2326.24s: and and it's like wow bang like huge
2327.88s: Market return so for me I always play
2330.20s: the mental game of what I think is going
2331.80s: to happen but I always have like Market
2334.28s: tools to make sure I don't like get
2335.56s: offside right so I I can think whatever
2337.08s: I want but I'm not one of those guys
2338.76s: like oh it's lower so now it's even
2340.08s: cheaper I got to buy more like no if the
2341.56s: market disagrees with me I'm I'm out of
2343.16s: the way I'm not going to just get run
2344.60s: over but I like to kind of plan because
2347.48s: when I I just when I'm right uh about
2349.80s: Direction and it plays out that way for
2351.60s: me that's when the fireworks happen
2353.56s: definitely and I think the way you view
2355.80s: it is also the way that I tend to view
2357.80s: things which is not so much as a
2359.52s: predictive outcome but more of a
2361.72s: probabilistic assessment and because to
2364.88s: your point if you find a scenario that
2368.24s: you think it's likely to play out X Y or
2370.60s: Z you position yourself because that's
2373.28s: the way you dominantly think it'll play
2375.00s: out but then if the market doesn't
2377.08s: confirm that it's not like this giant
2379.68s: disbelief Factor how could the markets
2382.92s: right and I think that that's one of the
2384.84s: problems that people that try to do any
2386.68s: sort of predictive modeling fall into is
2389.80s: that they think their assessment is what
2392.24s: should happen and then if it doesn't
2394.44s: happen they're besides themselves and
2396.04s: then that leads to you know late getting
2397.84s: out not putting the trigger on other
2399.92s: trades that need to go on and stuff so I
2401.48s: think that that's a really healthy way
2402.64s: to look at it when you're looking
2405.56s: forward to the rest of the
2408.76s: Year where are the next Market leaders
2411.76s: going to come from within small caps so
2414.48s: you were kind of talking about growth
2415.60s: not even small caps but growth stocks So
2417.68s: within growth stocks what Subs sector do
2420.60s: you think the market leaders are going
2421.76s: to come
2422.84s: from so it's kind of hard because when
2425.24s: the markets are rough like a lot of
2426.56s: stuff has weight on them um but there's
2429.16s: like some key themes that are showing
2430.72s: themselves like you know um I think AI
2433.40s: obviously is one that is strong I think
2435.20s: there's a long path to that but you
2437.28s: can't just buy at any price you know
2438.76s: like at a c you know like you need to
2440.28s: get it at the right time so that's one
2442.64s: um you all the weight loss uh you know
2445.08s: drugs you can see like Novo nordis I
2446.68s: forget the name of them o OIC and those
2448.92s: other ones look I mean Bill O'Neal made
2451.88s: a fortune with amen because they found a
2453.44s: way to like you know fix your your blood
2455.32s: after certain I mean so so if they found
2456.92s: a way to help people lose weight there's
2458.32s: definitely a problem in society if
2460.20s: that's the way it is you know my my My
2463.20s: Hope here is that I'm going to petition
2466.24s: a new way for people to lose weight it's
2468.16s: going to be put the [ __ ] Fork down
2470.48s: and go for a walk that's my that's my
2472.64s: platform you know I'm um I'm someone
2475.24s: where like like just personally like I I
2477.20s: believe as much as possible like you
2478.96s: know avoid Pharmaceuticals for as as
2481.60s: much as you can this and that but for
2483.84s: some people where like you know it could
2485.20s: be willpower it could be like genetic I
2487.52s: don't know there's like reasons why
2489.24s: people you know are are overweight life
2491.52s: happens you know like the amount of of
2494.52s: negative repercussions from being
2495.80s: overweight is super high you know like
2497.96s: like it causes so many other problems
2499.60s: and people are on so many other
2500.84s: medications that are triggered from the
2503.24s: heavy weight in the first place so if
2505.76s: they found a way to help people lose
2507.40s: weight and there's not many big side
2508.84s: effects I mean that eliminates all the
2510.68s: other medication that people will likely
2512.20s: have to take and better lifestyle not so
2514.20s: look I mean it's uh if it helps helps it
2516.72s: helps I mean like I said my personal
2519.28s: preference is not to have to go there in
2520.40s: the first place but um you know if it
2522.36s: solves a solution with less harm why not
2524.88s: I guess you know but I I think that's an
2527.36s: important that's a theme but I think
2529.16s: there's a lot of stuff waiting in the
2530.44s: wings the IPO Market has been frozen
2533.04s: there's a lot of like young companies
2535.04s: mid-tier companies that want to come to
2536.40s: Market so like yeah I mean I could spit
2538.44s: out some other themes that are doing
2539.48s: pretty well like I think like Uber's
2540.80s: still growing there's there's a lot of
2542.12s: like midcap stocks that are doing great
2544.32s: cyber secur is doing well if you look at
2546.24s: everything that's kind of like security
2547.56s: related there's like uh PSN avav which
2551.20s: are all kind of like um security related
2553.80s: stocks you know with the wars and all
2555.28s: that Spence's going up so they've been
2556.80s: acting very strongly with strong growth
2559.20s: but I'm really looking forward to seeing
2560.52s: that IPO Market unfreeze because I think
2562.20s: there's so much in terms of like AI that
2564.28s: is not in the market like it's not going
2565.44s: to be Nvidia that's G to go up forever
2567.00s: you know what I mean like there's gonna
2567.92s: be other players who take this and
2570.00s: develop new products new services like
2572.00s: think of Internet you know Circa 1995
2575.00s: like all the players that come out mouth
2576.36s: and each guy leverages the other guy's
2578.12s: technology there's like a lot of stuff
2579.40s: that's going to be coming so like uh you
2582.04s: know I'm not really quite sure how it's
2584.24s: going to play out who's going to be the
2585.32s: super big winner like there's key themes
2586.84s: showing strength now but you know that
2588.76s: changes over time so we have to see how
2590.12s: the data moves how do you how do you
2592.28s: view the AI landscape do you think that
2594.08s: it'll be like a really fragmented come
2596.24s: to Market where it's a really wide
2597.96s: industry that grows together or do you
2599.84s: see that there will be a couple names
2601.44s: that gobble up other names and kind of I
2604.44s: want to say monopolize but definitely
2606.20s: cut down the
2607.28s: herd yeah you know and I think it's so
2609.76s: easy and everyone will always kind of
2611.88s: say Matt like you know you know Google
2614.56s: or like Microsoft the own everything
2616.24s: like who's going to compete with them
2617.60s: but you know the history of like
2619.08s: capitalism is that it's always these big
2620.76s: players that get eaten by smaller guys
2622.32s: who are faster and quicker you know what
2623.88s: I mean so like many other times there's
2625.72s: Industries where people could have said
2627.12s: like oh who's going to beat IBM or who's
2629.16s: going to beat Xerox and and they fall
2631.20s: like every single time like if there's
2633.60s: anything we've learned from like history
2635.00s: is that the bigger stocks fail and
2637.00s: usually fail quickly so I'm not saying
2638.28s: Microsoft's going down but I'm saying
2640.40s: like there's going to be a lot of people
2642.08s: who are going to first of all the
2643.56s: returns like if you're already a three
2644.80s: trillion dollar company to get a double
2646.92s: you have to increase another three
2648.20s: trillion in market cap so like the law
2650.00s: of large numbers alone will not make
2652.48s: Microsoft like a five bagger I mean
2654.44s: unless it's like the entire US economy
2656.32s: so you can find these great like I'm
2658.96s: what I'd like to look for is like a 10
2660.16s: billion doll company that becomes a $50
2661.76s: billion company or 100 Bill like that's
2663.80s: your 510 bagger and there's a lot of
2665.72s: companies that can come to Market with a
2667.04s: you know 510 billion valuation they
2669.12s: they're they're solving a new problem a
2671.08s: new issue like there's a Sam sah symbols
2673.28s: iot like they have all these chips like
2676.00s: that that you can put like tracking type
2678.28s: things on on your vehicle so if you're
2679.96s: like I think Delta Airlines uses them
2682.36s: think about you have vehicles all over
2683.84s: this massive airport Atlanta airport
2685.72s: it's huge who's idling you know where
2687.96s: can you save gas on idling where can you
2689.60s: save employee time from having to find
2691.48s: these vehicles how do you have them
2692.68s: positioned this is all stuff that can be
2694.24s: saved where if you have you know you
2696.04s: know proper tracking on all these
2697.44s: vehicles and usage and then you have
2699.16s: like an AI brain to say like okay well
2701.28s: you're idling too long here like why
2702.72s: don't you switch to like uh a generator
2705.00s: instead of jet fuel for that one hour
2706.68s: that you you know like that could be
2707.68s: saved money and so there's G to be these
2709.84s: small upsides that are $10 billion doll
2711.28s: market caps that solve these great
2712.92s: problems and make everyone's life better
2714.88s: and they go from 10 to 50 billion and
2716.44s: that to me that's that's my my interest
2719.36s: that's what Peaks my interest like that
2721.32s: part of the um like the the stock market
2723.92s: landscape yeah well it's also really
2726.04s: cool way to learn about technology and
2727.44s: stuff right like specifically a it's I'm
2730.72s: similar to you in your thought process
2733.16s: my
2735.32s: specific curiosity is whether or not
2737.72s: we'll see like a couple bigger AI names
2741.36s: like not existing names not Nvidia but
2744.28s: startups or kind of things that pivot in
2747.28s: AI that start to become you know the
2749.56s: apple of AI or something like that
2752.60s: because it seems like those kinds of
2754.96s: markets are fast fting because it's very
2756.92s: new there's just a ton of opportunity in
2761.16s: front of it there's already widespread
2763.04s: integration efforts so I'm really
2766.08s: looking forward to seeing the way that
2768.00s: companies go to market and how
2770.08s: competitive that gets because I imagine
2771.72s: it's going to be there'll be enough for
2773.56s: everybody to eat but I'm imagining that
2775.24s: there's going to be a couple couple
2776.64s: companies that get it really right and
2778.48s: start to dominate it's just you know
2780.00s: think think about it like think of
2781.32s: recent history like Google's not that
2783.00s: old I mean like you know it was two guys
2785.60s: and apartment they created a better
2787.04s: algorithm for search and I mean they're
2789.64s: one of the biggest companies in the
2790.64s: world like and it didn't take them very
2792.08s: long like with technology stuff scal so
2794.40s: quickly so yeah like Google Microsoft
2796.68s: they have huge team smart guys uh like
2799.76s: Untold resources but there's always
2802.28s: going to be some people out there
2803.36s: they're gonna build a better mouse trap
2805.36s: somehow and like you know I know like
2807.52s: data is important but there's ways to
2810.12s: get data look at look at chat GPT you
2811.92s: know open AI I mean they did who was
2813.52s: open AI three four years ago right and
2815.80s: suddenly they're the fastest scaling
2817.68s: business ever in history from I think I
2819.16s: think to 100 million users so like
2821.20s: perfect case in point like there's so
2822.76s: many of those that are going to come out
2824.24s: and people also like look at companies
2827.24s: as a company you know we remember it's
2829.36s: people so if you're let's say you're
2830.72s: like this genius working or you're Elon
2832.80s: Musk like is Elon Musk working for
2834.52s: Google no he's so smart he went out it
2836.28s: on his own and he did his own thing so
2837.64s: there's gonna be people who are at
2839.00s: Microsoft or at Google saying like yeah
2841.44s: I make like a I don't know million
2843.80s: dollar salary because they need me but
2845.96s: if I would like do this upstart and I
2847.56s: can get funding because everyone knows
2848.80s: me and I can bring that upstart to like
2851.12s: a$ n billion doll valuation like I'll
2853.04s: make $500 million instead of like $5
2855.32s: million in the next five so these guys
2856.96s: leave these big shops and they start new
2859.64s: and that's how this this rotation always
2861.84s: happens because eventually all this
2863.08s: talent doesn't want a salary like I mean
2865.60s: it's hard to like I mean Google's not
2866.84s: gonna start paying guys $50 million a
2868.44s: year right that's what the CEO makes or
2869.84s: not even so these guys eventually said
2871.64s: like look I why why I stay here go start
2873.76s: my own thing and that it just gives
2875.12s: birth to these new and that's what I
2876.72s: love like that's what that's really what
2878.40s: gets me excited about growth investing
2880.04s: it's not just about the stocks and the
2881.36s: patterns of momentum it's like
2883.60s: understanding this kind of stuff you
2884.68s: know it's that's where all the wealth
2885.92s: comes from well it's a really
2887.92s: fascinating way to analyze the world
2889.92s: around us that's one of the things I
2891.36s: love about the stock market is whenever
2893.72s: I'm learning about different things in
2895.92s: my opinion you get one of the most
2898.24s: unbiased perspectives possible whereas
2901.52s: if you pull up one of the other news
2903.48s: agencies and read about whatever there's
2905.84s: always just a ton of skew right based on
2908.16s: whoever is producing that content but
2911.04s: yeah when it comes to the markets it's
2913.16s: you already know this skew how does this
2915.04s: apply to money like where's the finance
2917.24s: here where's the opportunity and I I
2919.96s: actually love that about markets when
2923.56s: you think about AI I'm curious your
2925.80s: thoughts on kind of this specific
2927.52s: section of it to me it seems like in
2930.52s: order to like really dominate that
2932.52s: landscape there has to be pretty serious
2935.60s: infrastructure like pretty serious
2937.64s: infrastructure in order to support it do
2939.80s: you think that that would lead to one
2942.56s: the birth of a new supporting
2944.52s: infrastructure business as well and do
2946.28s: you view something like that performing
2948.56s: in line as AI expands do you think about
2951.20s: that at all I think yeah I mean part of
2953.64s: the play like if you look at smci which
2956.00s: um super micro computer like they had a
2957.92s: big year it's because they're like part
2959.32s: of the infrastructure play but if you
2961.52s: look right now I would compare where we
2964.36s: are now as early intern where like now
2966.04s: we take for granted that there's
2967.08s: ethernet cables everywhere and that's
2968.72s: why you have fast internet in your house
2970.52s: but someone like had to lay those
2972.00s: physical cables down for you to have
2974.04s: this internet so guys like Nvidia
2976.40s: Microsoft with their Cloud which they
2977.84s: just reported tonight and they beat on
2979.44s: the cloud or like you know Amazon with
2980.84s: their Amazon web services that's the
2982.84s: ethernet of the current ERA so same with
2986.00s: the internet the first big bull markets
2987.56s: were infrastructure guys and and then
2989.84s: after it went to people who implemented
2991.60s: that kind of stuff so Nvidia I mean
2992.76s: they're chips they're not they're not
2994.36s: really AI they're giving giving the
2995.80s: stuff to people to do AI so I think we
2998.72s: see it but I think they're already
2999.72s: really big and there's probably going to
3000.92s: be growth that's why the NASDAQ is
3002.44s: strong but the big money I think that
3004.64s: like the real surprising stuff is the
3006.00s: people these smart guys where they're
3008.08s: say how do I take this and like create
3010.20s: something new and even with existing
3012.48s: companies I think you could see like a
3014.48s: stair step higher in earnings because
3016.52s: you could be XYZ company and you're not
3018.44s: an AI company but just like every
3020.32s: company uses the internet today and and
3022.28s: they create like new you know they they
3024.04s: run more efficiently like imagine if
3025.88s: companies to have the same number of
3027.32s: employees and the same kind of cost if
3029.16s: they did everything physical I mean it
3030.48s: would be like astronomical like you
3031.84s: wouldn't have the valuations or the the
3033.32s: stuff we have today so people are going
3035.44s: to get leaner meaner faster better more
3038.20s: efficient and you'll see earnings grow
3040.20s: that's why I think the 90s yeah at the
3042.56s: end it became a bubble for Tech but like
3044.84s: the market and even way before the
3046.68s: bubble hit was flying because like the
3049.48s: internet made everything like earnings
3051.24s: better for everybody everything became
3053.04s: more and more efficient and faster and
3054.44s: better earnings grew so that's why like
3056.88s: capitalism and like free markets like
3059.44s: never mind the profits it brings to
3060.84s: people like it makes everybody's life
3062.64s: better guess it's the system like you
3064.56s: need to have that that exists in the
3066.36s: world anything else is you're G to end
3068.32s: up with a a worse off Society in my
3071.64s: opinion completely agree yeah I mean
3073.96s: it's it's one of the few things that
3075.32s: like really incentivizes Innovation and
3078.16s: yeah even with really big players out
3080.48s: there you can still to your point
3081.96s: compete with them and still do really
3083.80s: [ __ ] well it's incredible think about
3085.20s: it yeah it's it's an incred it's an
3086.80s: incredible system to have in place where
3089.40s: you could have these like goliaths and
3090.88s: there's still someone who's going to
3091.76s: come up and take him down it's it's it's
3093.84s: incredible speaking of taking them down
3096.04s: I know we're coming up on time but I
3098.40s: cannot not get your take on this when
3102.04s: the FED starts its pivot what do you
3106.28s: think happens to the market and I
3108.28s: specifically want to ask you this
3109.84s: because I know that you've looked at can
3112.84s: only imagine all of the historical
3115.36s: references that we have for this kind of
3117.56s: action and I have as well out of sheer
3120.40s: curiosity but I know that you have a
3122.24s: much wider breath of understanding of
3124.20s: these things so yeah I'd love your take
3125.92s: on that so I'm going to give the
3127.96s: ridiculous answer and say like we can go
3129.72s: up a lot or we can go down a lot you
3131.40s: know but I'm I'm gonna explain that I
3132.84s: think it's likely that we go up a lot
3135.28s: and people can you know I've had this
3136.88s: conversation with super good friend of
3138.52s: mine we trade with he's like he says you
3140.08s: know like Maddie in 2008 it's when the
3142.40s: FED started cutting rates that things
3144.08s: went bad because they saw the econ was
3145.92s: unraveling but if you if you go back to
3148.56s: me there's two different eras there's
3150.20s: there's eras with inflation and there's
3152.00s: eras without inflation so if you look at
3154.04s: the inflation eras which is like the 70s
3156.80s: uh until like
3159.28s: 82 inflation caused these bare markets
3161.84s: inflation came in they fed at the hike
3163.72s: rates and that crushed the economy if
3166.32s: you look at the bottoms of like 74 78 82
3170.08s: they always bottomed when rates started
3172.04s: to come down because the FED would start
3173.60s: to cut cut rates when inflation was
3175.64s: easing so the the problem of that time
3178.84s: was over if you look at 2008 for example
3182.28s: the FED started cutting rates because
3183.52s: they broke everything and because
3184.60s: everything was imploding so the problem
3186.48s: was not inflation like the problem was
3188.68s: like oh my goodness like they like the
3190.20s: economy is like seizing up so the
3192.32s: cutting of of rates was like a different
3195.48s: they weren't cutting rates because
3196.40s: things were improving they were cutting
3197.84s: rates because things were getting much
3199.28s: worse so my view is that we're coming
3201.76s: out of this inflationary period and
3203.84s: that's why if you look yesterday I know
3205.48s: Bill akman put that tweet saying that um
3207.64s: I don't know if you saw it where he says
3208.64s: you know I was short bonds but there's
3210.68s: too much risk in the world uh to be
3212.96s: short Bond so as soon as he said that
3214.52s: the bond market leaped but like to me
3216.32s: that was a tell of the market because
3217.72s: when when the bond market leaped and
3218.92s: yields came down the market also went up
3221.36s: so I think the Market's looking for that
3223.08s: point in time where inflation is over
3224.56s: yeah the econom is not great but I think
3226.80s: once inflation is fully dead and rates
3229.00s: start to come down the stock market's
3231.12s: going to be saying okay the economy is
3232.80s: not great but inflation was our problem
3234.88s: if rates can come down the economy is
3236.56s: going to come back the economy is not
3238.12s: broken so that's why I think likely we
3240.76s: take off what would break what would
3242.84s: break that what would make that not come
3244.28s: true like the the smaller probability
3245.96s: scenario well there's a lot of debt out
3248.32s: there and rates have gone from zero to
3250.80s: high very quickly so if the FED
3253.44s: overcooks it like if if they look at too
3255.80s: much lagging data and they wait so long
3259.12s: to cut rates that the economy does start
3261.08s: to seize up then after now they have to
3264.24s: actually like save the econ again
3265.48s: because they broke it so like I think
3267.12s: they have the opportunity here to like
3268.76s: soft land it and if they're not too
3271.36s: stubborn and you know they're not just
3272.92s: you know I hope they're just like
3274.40s: talking tough to kind of keep things
3275.72s: going the way they want it to go but if
3277.36s: they react in time as inflation EAS and
3279.08s: they start to cut I think we enter a
3280.40s: nice bull market but if they really get
3282.56s: stubborn and like draw it out too long
3284.60s: and and things start to implode then I
3286.44s: think we can get a little we can get
3287.68s: downside with the first cut but I I I'm
3289.84s: I'm saying it's a nine out of ten chance
3292.32s: that we rally when raate Cuts start a
3295.40s: couple data points before I let you go
3298.12s: again just to amplify the conversation
3300.24s: around this um looking out at just Bond
3306.20s: pricing and subsequent probabilities of
3310.28s: rate
3311.36s: changes um right now for one no the
3316.04s: overwhelming probability is no change 13
3318.88s: D no change with a 25% chance of a
3322.84s: hike going to 31 Jan it goes to a 35%
3327.28s: chance of a hike 20 March 31% chance of
3331.88s: a hike and then it doesn't really show
3335.16s: the first majority probability of an
3337.56s: ease until 12 June 24 and that's only a
3340.76s: 53% probability of an ease you know but
3344.00s: I think that can change because even
3345.36s: this year if you if you remember what we
3346.96s: were earlier in the year they were
3347.96s: pricing in Cuts already for like right
3349.48s: now you know and that's not that's not
3351.32s: the case now they're actually like you
3352.40s: said you know 35% chance of a hike so
3355.16s: that can change like I I really think
3358.04s: like the inflation battle is one like
3360.20s: like all we have to do is wait around
3361.76s: like like the trend of inflation's
3363.28s: coming down if you look at like I think
3365.12s: you know shelter I think is like 70% of
3367.56s: like core inflation which is the problem
3369.56s: and if you look at more real time
3371.20s: readings I mean they're showing like 2%
3373.72s: inflation or lower so I think it's just
3375.64s: like a waiting game it's just that you
3377.04s: don't want the economy to blow up until
3379.12s: the data comes in but we're going in the
3380.92s: right direction like inflation is no
3382.64s: longer accelerating it's coming down
3384.32s: it's coming down so that's why I'm
3386.76s: optimistic like some people will say
3387.84s: like oh the econom is just about to go
3389.16s: off a cliff and you know this bare
3390.56s: Market's just getting started I don't
3392.16s: think so like first of all that goes
3394.32s: back to how the big cap Tech have skewed
3397.28s: the NASDAQ because it's the safety trade
3399.60s: if you look at the average stock small
3402.12s: Caps or whatever midcaps like it's it's
3404.64s: like they're knocking on like over two
3406.36s: years of a bare market like this is not
3407.96s: early if we get one more flush down if
3410.60s: we even get that and and and you know
3412.80s: inflation starts to come in 3% sub
3416.04s: 3% I think like we start to Rite like I
3418.88s: think we're we're if this is a you know
3420.24s: baseball game we're like in the seventh
3421.48s: or eighth inning of this bare Market I
3425.08s: think interesting it's also curious to
3427.64s: hear when um folks like you I know Jim
3431.56s: also feels the same um what do you guys
3434.52s: use for your reference period for the
3436.64s: for the bare
3438.08s: market so for me um well I think the
3440.88s: General market top November 21 growth
3443.56s: top February 21 so like I mean growth is
3446.32s: a subset but the General market I think
3448.36s: did have that last little push into the
3450.80s: end of 21 uh but stocks really didn't do
3453.64s: much from the peak of February to the
3455.72s: end of the year but I I count it from
3458.76s: you know growth is going to be almost
3459.88s: three years of bare Market General
3461.12s: stocks it's about two years got it okay
3464.88s: yeah and it's the I think your
3467.84s: hypothesis on this is really interesting
3469.64s: because I agree with you on kind of the
3472.00s: overall tenor of inflation I find it
3475.32s: interesting where we're still seeing
3477.68s: pretty sticky inflation in other
3479.80s: measures so like fuel food like some of
3482.80s: those things are still pretty awful for
3484.60s: people um to part this
3489.24s: out what do you see going into the end
3492.44s: of the year do you think that there will
3494.64s: be any significant catalysts that you're
3497.64s: looking forward to seeing the outcome of
3500.00s: or do you think it's kind of business as
3501.84s: usual we'll see information as we get it
3505.36s: yeah I think uh I think we'll see as as
3507.20s: we get it I I I think we'll get more
3509.40s: downside personally I'm I'm actually I
3511.44s: mean I never want to see anyone suffer
3513.56s: things to go bad but from from a stock
3516.00s: market perspective like if we got good
3518.68s: downside from here like I think that
3521.20s: would be enough to kind of put an end to
3522.64s: all of this would would like rip the
3524.00s: bandaid off and you know the FED would
3526.12s: then start to say like oh we're have to
3527.36s: start balancing the risk of the economy
3529.52s: with inflation because the feds you know
3531.04s: the Market's breaking if you look at
3532.64s: 2018 poell was talking tough the NASDAQ
3535.16s: fell 20% and he flipped you know so like
3537.12s: they they do watch markets so I think
3539.52s: there's pressure on the market now
3540.88s: because the fed's been talking tough um
3543.28s: and even like you look last week he was
3544.68s: talking even tough regarding the the you
3546.96s: know longer term yield so he's really
3548.72s: putting the pressure on and stocks are
3550.32s: starting to buckle so that's why I think
3551.84s: it's GNA happen but I would I just I
3554.20s: would always remind people because it's
3555.56s: easy it's super easy to get negative you
3558.24s: know when things look bad but like if
3560.20s: take a second and look at every bare
3562.16s: Market bottom it's always awful you're
3565.64s: never going to get a good feeling Market
3567.44s: bottom so if you go by what you feel or
3569.80s: what your friends tell you or seeing
3571.20s: someone closing their business or what
3573.12s: the news is saying you're never going to
3575.04s: buy stocks like in size at the right
3576.76s: time so like I mean you should be
3578.36s: expecting to be buying stocks when
3579.84s: everything looks terrible like I mean
3581.72s: some of my good years was like you know
3583.16s: I started trading Pro in 08 and like it
3585.08s: was financial crisis like the bull
3586.28s: market started March of 09 I mean the
3588.28s: economy was going off a cliff like
3589.84s: companies were Banks were failing
3591.44s: everything like think of coid like we
3593.08s: had an amazing bull market the world
3594.72s: will shut down bang we go vertical so
3596.36s: it's like the good stuff comes out of
3598.48s: the bad stuff you know so it's like I
3600.96s: expect more downside but like I'm I'm
3602.88s: looking at it from like I always try and
3604.76s: it's it takes a a mental process like a
3607.96s: specific process to keep yourself
3609.52s: optimistic when things are negative but
3611.00s: you really have to because it's so easy
3613.64s: to fall into that uh sense of like a
3615.80s: things are bad W was me bad economy
3617.96s: things can't go up and then bang you
3619.60s: miss like the best opportunity and
3621.04s: everything runs massive massive advice
3623.80s: and I think
3625.32s: when people get into that to that
3628.24s: mindset I always remind them like zoom
3630.24s: out like Zoom the chart out Zoom
3632.40s: whatever you're looking at out because
3633.76s: they're to your point always periods
3635.48s: where things look awful but I've never
3638.04s: seen us indices not make new highs well
3641.88s: you know for me like I know from
3643.08s: personal experience I won't I know we're
3644.52s: going late I won't go long but like when
3646.44s: I was uh Market making and pro trading
3648.12s: on the desk like um being in Canada we
3650.40s: had a lot of the gold stocks oil stocks
3651.88s: and all that so like I really got to
3653.44s: know the O the gold industry very well
3655.32s: these commodity Industries and the gold
3657.24s: industry is like you know tends to be
3658.96s: built on like things are going to be bad
3660.44s: it's a store of wealth and all that and
3662.28s: at the time I think it was Ron Paul was
3663.80s: running as Republican um nominee and
3667.00s: he's all about hard money and they have
3668.64s: really I mean again if you like monetary
3670.32s: history you know the US is to be backed
3671.92s: by gold and all this and so Peter Schiff
3675.08s: had really nailed like the 09 like um
3677.56s: financial crisis and I was listening to
3679.16s: his podcast it's so easy to fall into
3681.08s: this like negative thing of like oh look
3683.24s: at these politicians they're and these
3684.96s: people and it's so easy to fall into
3687.00s: that and and it and I remember I had
3688.72s: missed like a really big Market leg up
3690.72s: because I had this like Frozen uh
3693.52s: negative bias and like it's like it came
3696.32s: like one day I'm like what am I doing
3698.04s: like I mean like it's like you're saying
3700.00s: like you're looking at the data in front
3701.40s: of you going up and it's like you're
3702.64s: just telling yourself like no it's bad
3703.92s: it's bad it's bad and I remember
3705.72s: promising myself I would never do that
3707.32s: again to myself like one we came out of
3709.76s: World War II I mean as bad as things
3711.84s: look things were a lot a lot worse other
3713.60s: times in history you know so like look
3716.12s: look to the good as much as possible but
3717.80s: protect yourself when the data says it's
3719.76s: a bad time that's that's my perspective
3722.64s: or or trade options and you trade all
3725.52s: those times there's that too there's
3727.96s: always that option the option of
