0.72s: what's up outliers what is all this
2.80s: drama about Tesla Mark Rober and then
6.72s: laser well we're going to take a quick
8.32s: look at it today I want to spend a
10.24s: little more time actually focusing
11.92s: primarily on the technology the you know
15.36s: different conjecture around what's going
18.04s: on with this we'll talk a little bit
19.32s: about that but I think the bigger
21.44s: picture here is actually a discussion
23.24s: about the technology so let's see what
26.64s: this is I don't have High Hopes here but
29.16s: with the kid look just this is cool
30.88s: after the Tesla test oh oh oh
34.84s: fudge
36.80s: bam so here's what's going on in this
40.64s: video as far as I can tell a lot of
43.04s: people are saying that Mark Rober you
46.68s: know purposely did this to try to crash
48.60s: Tesla or to try to make laser which is a
51.68s: primary producer of ldar go off the
54.28s: charts and there's a lot to this story
56.60s: and I'm not going to pretend to be
58.92s: completely read in on it all but there's
61.88s: a couple things to note right out of the
63.36s: gate the majority of this video is
65.84s: actually about liar technology he
68.56s: actually spends the first half
70.40s: discussing the technology how cool it is
72.76s: the kind of things that he can do um
76.20s: taking it to Disneyland and using it to
79.28s: map some of the different rides so a lot
82.04s: of it is literally just about the
83.80s: technology then the second part of it is
86.28s: obviously just designed to get clicks
89.24s: right that's why we brought Tesla into
91.52s: this that's why we said something can
93.24s: you fool a self-driving car and that's
95.40s: also why we framed it as can you fool
97.68s: because if you take a look at the tests
99.96s: that they did right there's a couple six
102.24s: different scenarios the scenarios that
104.44s: they picked were like really extreme
106.88s: they were things that I don't think
109.68s: really represent what you expect to see
112.72s: in an average day driving and nor is it
115.64s: designed to be like I view this as a
118.56s: test so were purposely picking things
121.60s: that represent extremes now that being
124.68s: said I do find some of the criticisms to
127.64s: be probably worthwhile because this does
131.96s: make Tesla to the lay viewer look a
134.84s: little bit worse and I also think it's a
137.52s: little strange the criticism that he
140.08s: wasn't using the full autonomous driving
143.56s: capability and is simply using the
145.24s: assisted driving which is a slightly
147.12s: different set of skills I actually
149.00s: watched a video where he had a
150.60s: conversation with somebody about that
152.84s: and he effectively said I didn't think
154.36s: there was a big difference in the
155.44s: technology which he generally does like
158.32s: really robust scientific experiments so
161.12s: it surprises me that he wouldn't make
163.40s: the Assumption of well let me just try
165.20s: it with full self-driving and then
167.60s: assisted driving and see if there's a
169.16s: difference between those right like if I
171.16s: were testing it that's the angle I would
172.68s: take it so I thought that was kind of
174.56s: interesting but all that being said
177.28s: after watching the video at no point did
180.32s: I get the Sensation that he's trying to
183.08s: crash Tesla or even you know moon
187.16s: luminar now one of the things to note is
190.36s: this dude that's driving the car that
193.12s: has lar technology you can tell is
196.80s: obviously repping luminar he's repping
199.08s: the set so what does that tell us well
202.00s: it tells us that Mark is absolutely
205.84s: promoting this company now one of the
208.44s: things I've seen thrown around is people
209.80s: people conjecturing that he has long
212.04s: financial interest in luminar short
214.00s: financial interest in Tesla or a
215.68s: combination thereof I've not seen any
217.80s: conclusive evidence of either so I
220.12s: reserve judgment until I know one way or
222.40s: the other I think the speculation is
223.84s: fine that's a natural thing to assume
226.56s: that could be happening but regardless
228.72s: if he has a financial stake in any of
231.24s: this
232.36s: aside he's still clearly is promoting
235.16s: this company right that's why this
237.28s: person again is wearing the company
239.16s: t-shirt talking about not just the
241.24s: technology cuz ldar is made by bunch of
244.00s: different companies so that is clear
246.20s: here all of that stuff aside is
249.04s: interesting to see how quick people kind
251.24s: of assume the worst about folks and take
253.64s: it to a really ugly place I generally
256.72s: like Mark Rober I think the work he does
258.96s: is pretty cool I do have some questions
260.84s: about the broader efficacy and you know
263.60s: the the tests that he did I would give
266.92s: him the benefit of the doubt in the
268.28s: sense that I don't think he purposely
270.96s: would try to run really bad tests
274.28s: because again like you get called out
275.92s: for it and he's smart enough to know
277.52s: that so that stuff aside we actually
282.20s: spent a while taking a look at the
283.84s: difference between liar technology and
288.12s: different kinds of self-driving
290.20s: technology Suites and actually found
291.96s: some cool things so let's take a look
293.88s: this is from our friendly AI assistant
295.84s: also known as chat GPT and I essentially
298.40s: asked it to compare are the current
300.44s: primary technology being used in
302.00s: autonomous driving Vehicles different
303.64s: companies that are using different kinds
305.80s: and to essentially compare and contrast
308.48s: and we can see that one of the big
310.20s: differences which by the way Tesla
312.28s: dominantly is using cameras and places
315.28s: like wayo Mercedes Aurora they're using
317.84s: ldar and one of the things to note is
320.76s: Mercedes is a premium vehicle class and
323.04s: what they tend to produce is more
324.44s: expensive now I want to be clear this is
326.16s: not me promoting any of these companies
328.92s: in any way I actually currently don't
330.52s: have a position in anything here but the
333.20s: I just want to talk about the technology
335.52s: and the technology here I think is
338.00s: really interesting because one of the
340.80s: Curious changes that's happening is
344.52s: rather than relying on one technology
347.32s: dominant and Tesla's initial imperative
350.84s: obviously was to try to create something
353.48s: that was first of its kind cost
356.32s: available to a lot of people and
358.60s: mass-producible
359.88s: whereas if you take a look at the
362.24s: picture of something like Mercedes which
363.80s: is definitely a much higher end vehicle
366.60s: more on the premium side of things so
369.76s: what companies are doing now though that
371.80s: I actually find to be very smart but
374.48s: also interesting is a lot of them are
377.00s: running a blend of different
379.56s: Technologies so you can see that they're
381.20s: using lar for certain use cases radar
383.68s: for certain use cases and cameras and
386.04s: what you can do is create a really
388.12s: robust capability sweep but manage cost
392.00s: now a really interesting inclusion here
394.48s: is the AI technology that Tesla is
398.24s: looking to integrate and that might even
400.04s: change the landscape even further now I
403.80s: think if we think about the longer term
407.16s: future of self-driving vehicles and we
409.88s: go back to you know this video like the
413.80s: near-term effect is one thing in terms
415.68s: of the stock prices which I do think
417.40s: that there is some effect that we can
419.08s: observe but the longer term effect even
421.60s: of a partial study or a study that's
424.24s: really done in very clear
426.60s: extremes is also kind of helpful for the
430.16s: broader landscape and it's even helpful
431.80s: for Tesla because they can see things
433.56s: like this and use it to optimize their
437.28s: company and their technology if they're
439.04s: so inclined but this is what I mean by
443.20s: extremes right like take a look at this
446.00s: this is essentially seeing if you would
448.60s: stop the car would stop detect this
452.88s: small person and then it's obviously
455.52s: like a mannequin and if it would stop
457.24s: before striking them and like just take
459.88s: a look right they're using water trucks
461.76s: to
462.68s: directly dump the water cross
465.88s: directionally onto the thing so this is
469.08s: what I mean by the tests that were done
470.92s: were done in like really extreme
472.64s: scenarios that I I genuinely don't
474.64s: believe represent day-to-day driving so
477.40s: this even as a assessment of the
480.04s: capability of the technology and a full
481.72s: self-driving Suite is completely
483.24s: different moreover than that there's a
485.96s: difference
487.76s: between crash detection and prevention
491.56s: in full driving right full driving
494.20s: includes things like changing lanes by
496.88s: monitoring your speed adjusting your
498.40s: speed based on what it can see and
499.72s: things like that the information
502.36s: received to make those decisions
503.84s: obviously is super important but it's
506.76s: not like this car right here even though
508.80s: it might have crash detection
510.52s: capabilities upgraded to it right so
513.04s: that it can see this and stop it's not a
515.72s: full self-driving car right they're
517.16s: different things so the conjecture
520.48s: around you know did Mark Rober do this
523.08s: for some sort of financial gain or
524.52s: whatever honestly don't know and it
526.60s: doesn't matter to me that much because I
528.36s: can also look at a study like a rational
530.80s: person and understand the context that
532.32s: it's being done in that being said the
534.80s: market as always uh never ceases to
537.80s: amaze so if we take a look at the
539.56s: difference here between Tesla and Laser
541.92s: Tesla's been getting crushed and Tesla's
544.84s: been getting crushed for some time now
546.88s: this absolutely will not help and then
549.36s: if we take a look at laser laser got a
551.96s: massive bump you can see the 14th here
555.12s: if we take a look at when this video
557.28s: came out it was on the 15th so here's
561.32s: the 14th which is Friday the 15th is
565.32s: over the weekend and then take a look at
566.76s: the 17th and then take a look at the
568.20s: 18th here here's the most interesting
570.52s: part about this whole thing and the fact
573.00s: that I love options markets because they
574.92s: tell us a whole lot if we take a look at
579.40s: the one- day premium flow specifically
581.68s: for the call side not a whole lot to
584.40s: write home about right kind of quiet
586.28s: nothing really sticking out at me but as
587.76s: soon as we Zoom this out what do you
591.12s: notice pretty quiet for the last week
595.96s: and then on the 17th all of a sudden
598.84s: call premium
601.16s: skyrockets this is people playing that
603.60s: news they're playing that movement and
605.36s: then take a look at what happens today
607.00s: people are dumping this is people
609.48s: selling these calls into strength and
611.68s: realizing their profits to go trade
613.48s: another thing it's a really funny and
616.12s: fun trade idea but the broader context
619.52s: here I think from the technology
621.04s: standpoint is it's pretty neat to see
622.92s: the different kinds of technology that
624.44s: exist and how they're being integrated
626.68s: into the automotive sphere but it's also
629.48s: really fun to see the market impact on a
633.40s: smaller company like laser and see how
636.88s: profound it absolutely can distort
640.20s: short-term price by shifting sentiment
642.68s: as always if you have any questions let
643.92s: me know be an outlier see you later
