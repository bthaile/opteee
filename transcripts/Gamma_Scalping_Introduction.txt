0.60s: I'm going to show you what gamma
2.28s: scalping is what the major components
4.44s: are and then walk you through an example
6.12s: so that you can see how this thing works
7.80s: from beginning to end what's up
9.60s: everybody Eric here and I'm stoked to
12.12s: talk a little bit about Gamma scalping
13.50s: because I actually think there's better
14.88s: opportunity now than there has been in
16.98s: the past few years so let's jump over
19.14s: and get right into what this is what is
21.48s: gamma scalping it's essentially Delta
24.90s: adjustments around a base trade so the
28.32s: way to think about it is you can scalp
30.66s: without having any sort of Base position
33.18s: and what I mean by that is you could try
35.40s: to benefit from the interim price
37.74s: movements of whatever it is that you're
39.78s: trading now the difference between that
42.00s: and Gamma scalping is we typically have
45.00s: some sort of Base trade on and we're
48.36s: adjusting the Deltas on that trade so
51.72s: when we're looking at these there's kind
53.70s: of two main categories there's long
55.68s: premium trades and then short premium
57.66s: trades now for gamma scalping more more
61.08s: often than not this is typically an
62.94s: Institutional practice so there's a lot
65.04s: of differences between what an
66.42s: institution will do with this and what
68.52s: retail seeks to do with it a lot of that
70.38s: has to do with transaction costs and
72.66s: things of that nature but that being
75.00s: said the normal way retail Traders will
78.42s: gamma scalp is typically having some
81.00s: sort of long base volatility trade very
84.78s: very common move is long straddles so
88.56s: buying an at the money call and put
90.42s: which we'll talk about but that's a very
92.58s: common base trade to gamma scalp around
95.58s: and the idea here is the main enemy of
99.48s: any sort of long premium trade is time
102.60s: we need whatever it is that we're buying
106.02s: to move so that we can make money now
109.14s: there is another use for this for short
112.32s: premium Traders and this is a way to
115.26s: minimize some of the directional risk
117.36s: however you're going to see this a lot
119.52s: less frequently with short premium
121.80s: Traders and it's primarily because we we
123.96s: want time to pass and that benefits our
127.38s: position whereas for the people who are
129.84s: long premium the main utility of gamma
132.78s: scalping is to pay for Theta so that
136.08s: you're experiencing less erosion in your
139.98s: base position so that's the main
142.02s: difference between long premium short
143.52s: premium gamma scalping I'm going to
145.20s: spend more time talking about the long
146.52s: premium side again because that's the
148.80s: more common use case all right let's
150.66s: talk about the components there's two
152.58s: main things that we're going to have
153.54s: here we have Delta and Gamma which I'll
155.52s: talk about those in a second but what is
157.62s: the base style trade look like as I
160.44s: mentioned it'll normally be
162.78s: some sort of long premium strategy so in
165.96s: this case we're looking at something
167.28s: like a long straddle I'm using
169.50s: thinkorswim the on-demand feature so
171.96s: this is actually back in time on the 1st
173.94s: of June of 21 just for some context on
176.64s: what you're looking at here but the base
178.74s: position typically would be something
180.18s: like this where we buy the 419 call and
184.68s: put and that's really the base position
186.54s: that we have here so now we're long in
189.06s: at the money straddle so that is the
192.48s: beginning now in order to understand the
195.12s: idea of gamma scalping we need to
196.62s: understand how these two Greeks
198.60s: specifically Delta in Gamba move around
200.28s: so as you can see on this top chart we
203.16s: have two lines the white line and the
205.92s: yellow line the yellow line is a 325
209.40s: days to expiration option and then the
212.10s: white line is 31 really what I want you
214.74s: to note is the steepness in Delta that's
218.40s: what I'm highlighting because the closer
221.16s: we get to expiration the more Delta is
225.24s: going to move because options are
228.18s: approximating to one of two conditions
230.46s: either it's going to zero if it's out of
232.56s: the money or if it's going to one if
234.00s: it's in the money and this becomes
236.16s: steeper and steeper the closer we get to
238.80s: expiration okay now we need to talk
241.62s: about Gamma because it's called gamma
243.84s: scalping gamma is simply the rate of
247.14s: change of Delta
249.30s: so when we're thinking about Gamma
251.82s: scalping what we're doing is identifying
255.24s: how much our Deltas are going to move
258.24s: and then we're using that movement to
261.96s: buy in and out of the underlying so that
265.32s: we can cover our Theta costs so again
268.56s: right now Pretend We're long that
270.84s: straddle and as we start to get some
273.12s: movements we're going to trade the
274.80s: underline which I'll show you when we
276.30s: get into the example
278.04s: let's talk about some of the traits of
280.02s: gamma
281.16s: we have a 10 DTE gamma here in yellow
285.26s: and then a 30 DTE gamma here in white
289.70s: again notice how steep gamma becomes as
295.02s: we get closer to expiration the other
298.32s: thing that you're going to note is as we
300.84s: get closer to expiration the overall
303.84s: level of gamma is significantly higher
306.66s: whereas on a 30 DTE option the highest
310.20s: the peak gamma which is going to be at
312.30s: the money is 0.04
316.38s: meanwhile on the 10 DTE option our at
320.58s: the money gamma is 0.08 now this can
324.84s: vary quite a bit depending on what
326.40s: you're trading and there's one other
328.56s: condition that matters so I just went
330.84s: over this first one here where gamma in
333.54s: general would get uh will increase in
336.60s: magnitude the closer we get to
337.92s: expiration it will also be highest for
340.62s: at the money options
342.42s: now there's one other function is this
345.36s: right here gamma decreases as volatility
350.12s: increases so what I have sketched over
352.92s: this and these awful hand-drawn lines
355.22s: are two different volatility scenarios
358.80s: so if we have a high volatility scenario
363.60s: represented here in Orange notice how
366.84s: that is a bit more flat
369.42s: and if we have low volatility notice how
373.56s: we will have more gamma
377.40s: this exists is because the way that
379.38s: options move if we have really high
382.14s: volatility a lot of that is already
384.30s: priced into the options so a slight move
387.54s: in the underlying isn't going to make as
389.94s: big of a difference as it would have
391.50s: before
392.88s: so
394.20s: two other things we got to talk about
395.82s: one is if you were long premium whether
398.76s: it's long calls long puts it doesn't
401.28s: matter you are long gamma the way to
403.86s: think about this is if you're long gamma
405.84s: you just want something to move you need
407.58s: it to move ideally in your favor but in
409.98s: this scenario if we're talking about a
411.48s: long straddle we don't care which way it
413.46s: moves we just need it to move because
414.96s: otherwise as time passes we are just
417.54s: losing Theta if you were short premium
420.36s: you were short gamma this is kind of the
422.40s: inverse we don't want things to move
424.08s: that much which is again why this entire
426.66s: concept of gamma scalping doesn't really
429.00s: matter quite as much for short premium
431.70s: or short gamma positions is because we
433.32s: don't want it to move much anyways now
435.36s: if it does you can do some adjustments
437.70s: about it but it doesn't work to the same
439.68s: degree as what we will see with long
441.66s: gamma positions
443.40s: all right we'll take a quick pause there
445.80s: do a quick recap and then I want to get
447.78s: into an example so gamma scalping is a
452.04s: very active style strategy we typically
455.88s: will try to create varying thresholds
459.54s: that we choose to gamma scalp on now I'm
462.42s: not going to go super far into detail
463.98s: because I don't have time in this video
465.48s: for that but in maybe a couple gamma
468.12s: follow-on videos I will go into some of
471.36s: the considerations because it's going to
472.86s: be largely dependent on what you're
474.42s: trading how frequently it makes sense to
476.94s: gamma scalp as we have our long base
480.66s: position we are fighting Theta that is
483.72s: the entire premise of gamma scalping
486.00s: all right let's get over to an example I
491.28s: have here a
493.44s: um a series of Trades really but I'm
496.14s: going to start with what I was just
497.88s: showing you in here so again today is
500.28s: one June uh 2011 it's or I'm sorry 2021
504.54s: really it's 8 November 22 but I again am
508.98s: using on demand and I established this
512.10s: 419 long straddle so what does this look
515.82s: like let's take a look
517.68s: we bought to open 10 of the 21 June so
520.86s: this is just a 20 days to expiration
523.44s: trade and I bought the 419 column put at
526.74s: 10.79 so the initial position here has
531.36s: an outlay of ten thousand seven hundred
533.40s: ninety dollars it's 20 DTE right now we
537.24s: have long 59 gamma we are long 67 deltas
543.24s: and we are losing 260 dollars to daily
547.92s: Theta Decay so
550.56s: we don't want to just continually get
553.98s: sucked into our daily Theta erosion
557.70s: while we're waiting for that ideally
559.86s: large move
561.42s: so in order to maximize this base
565.26s: position what we're doing is we're going
568.26s: to sell to open 67 shares of spy at
572.60s: 419.83 so really the current price as of
576.30s: right now that's going to give us a 28
578.72s: 129 uh dollar credit so what just
582.00s: happened here this is where we entered
584.40s: the trade I drew a line right through
586.32s: the candle for some context and we'll go
588.60s: back over to thinkorswim in a second but
590.70s: I want you to see how this is working so
592.68s: we have this long straddle this was the
595.92s: remaining
597.18s: um Greeks that really pertain to us
599.04s: right now
600.24s: and we want to neutralize this Delta the
603.48s: whole point of this long straddle is
606.36s: we're not neces we we don't want to be
609.06s: directional that's the point of a
610.74s: straddle it's designed to be
611.94s: non-directional we are just trying to
614.46s: gain exposure to volatility expansions
616.98s: or just a big move one way or the other
619.86s: for us to exit while we're waiting for
622.20s: that we're fighting Theta so this is a
625.26s: way for us to attempt to offset Theta so
629.10s: right now as we sell those 67 shares
631.62s: it's going to take that 67 Delta and
634.02s: it's going to reduce it to just about
635.64s: nothing so let's take a look I have the
638.76s: same trade pulled up here notice how our
640.86s: gamma's 59.12 Delta is 67.83 so maybe we
645.30s: could do 68 shares instead of 67 just to
648.78s: go a little on the overside just kind of
651.06s: rounding it up because you can't sell
652.20s: partial shares and time is paused so
655.74s: nothing is moving around and I want you
657.48s: to look at what happens to Delta
661.02s: so we just got filled on our fake trade
664.56s: and notice Delta is now
668.12s: 0.17 negative 0.17 gamma doesn't move
672.12s: because we couldn't do anything in that
673.98s: scenario to adjust our gamma if we
675.78s: wanted to be gamma neutral for a
677.76s: completely different style trade we
680.40s: would structure the trade based off of
682.26s: gamma not off of Delta like we did here
684.78s: because if you look gamma on this option
687.42s: is
688.40s: 0.03 0.03 here but they're going to
692.58s: adjust over time as time moves which is
695.04s: why you see this discrepancy between the
696.84s: two even though they're the same strike
699.24s: so
700.74s: our long straddle is essentially flat
704.46s: maybe we're just seeing a small
706.50s: volatility expansion on the put side
708.30s: relative which is why we're seeing that
710.76s: come down just a little bit but overall
712.92s: we have a flat position our Deltas are
714.78s: flat okay now let's get back over to
717.60s: this screen and I want to show you I am
720.24s: just fast forwarding us to the end of
722.34s: the day because for me personally if I'm
724.50s: gamma scalping more often than not it's
727.14s: a daily Endeavor some people will gamma
729.54s: scalp way more throughout the day which
731.52s: is okay but again there are costs
734.40s: associated with that even though we
736.56s: don't have those upfront commissions on
739.02s: each order we send we're still paying
742.20s: for those trades via payment for order
744.24s: flow which comes in at we where we're
746.82s: seeing quotes and where we're getting
749.22s: filled at so don't allow the absence in
752.76s: the US at least of underlying
754.80s: commissions to mislead you into thinking
756.72s: that there's no cost associated with
758.46s: hedging there's still most certainly is
760.74s: so that's why I typically will hedge
763.20s: daily
764.64s: um maybe a little more frequently
766.26s: depending on the size of the position
767.58s: and how much Theta I'm losing so I'm
769.98s: just using a beginning of day entry and
773.16s: an end of day adjustment just so that
775.20s: you can see how this thing works okay so
777.60s: now let's fast forward time and instead
780.48s: of it being zero eight zero one am now
783.36s: it is 1601 this is Eastern Time
786.24s: and here's the trade that we have on our
789.42s: long straddle is now losing some money
791.34s: it's net p l or it's unreal SP L is
794.82s: negative 356. and the short Shares are
797.94s: showing a very small profit of plus 65
801.18s: dollars so I'm gonna fast forward time
803.82s: over here as well just so that you could
806.10s: see exactly what this looks like and as
809.40s: that loads we can talk about it
811.68s: coming back over here this in my opinion
815.34s: for me would be a slightly premature
818.04s: Delta adjustment and this goes back to
820.56s: the preference in terms of what we're
822.60s: trading and what we're trying to
824.28s: accomplish so in this scenario I would
827.52s: create a Delta range I think attempting
830.94s: to keep this at zero Deltas at all times
833.22s: is very very Troublesome so you can do
836.58s: it again like I'm sharing end of day you
839.28s: could do it for a percent or dollar move
843.12s: in the underlying you could do it based
845.76s: on a Delta threshold so what I typically
848.76s: will do is I'll look at the size of the
850.32s: position I'll create a Delta range and
853.38s: then I will simply hedge once we get
855.24s: outside that range in this case I would
857.22s: not be using 67 Deltas it would be more
859.38s: than that probably at least 100 Deltas
861.00s: but again for the sake of the example
863.40s: I'm going to show you the adjustment if
865.80s: we were doing an end of day adjustment
867.66s: so each day so in this case we have our
870.54s: third trade and and we're gonna buy to
872.94s: close 59 shares of our 67 really we did
878.10s: 68 in a bit of an audible on the
880.68s: platform itself which we'll see in a
882.42s: second but this will show you the debit
884.52s: that we paid out and then the realized p
886.44s: l so in this case we're still losing 260
889.62s: dollars a day in Daily Theta in this
892.08s: scenario we offset
894.32s: 57.82 it's not enough obviously so if
897.96s: this were the case and we're hoping to
900.42s: get some sort of movement that we can
901.98s: scalp but you're not guaranteed it so
904.26s: that's why the frequency of scalping
906.00s: starts to matter a lot so let's come
908.28s: over here real quick take a look at the
909.60s: platform and see where we're at as you
911.58s: can see it's about the same as what I
912.90s: was just showing you now we're in a
914.52s: unique scenario here because both the
917.88s: call and the put are both losing value
921.00s: and that's because of theta and
923.28s: volatility in this scenario so it is
926.10s: entirely possible when we're long and
927.90s: straddle to lose on both it's the less
930.42s: typical scenario but it certainly does
932.88s: happen and a lot of that's going to be
934.80s: dependent on again volatility and Theta
938.46s: so in this case as you can see our
941.88s: position now has a total short Deltas 57
946.20s: and we're up about 65 bucks so what I
949.14s: would do in this scenario is essentially
950.64s: flatten out the Deltas again and in this
953.16s: case it means that I would have to buy
954.66s: 57 shares I think it might be the same
956.88s: or slightly different in this scenario
958.26s: again just because we changed the
960.36s: original the original hedge but
962.16s: essentially all we're going to do then
963.54s: is make whatever that p l is so in this
967.20s: example let's just do it real quick we
969.66s: know that we need to buy
972.30s: so we'll come up over here we'll come
974.94s: down here and then we'll go to buy and
977.46s: we need to buy 57 Deltas in order to get
980.04s: us out of here the midpoint on that is
982.76s: 418.90 whatever it's paper trading so
984.90s: it's all fake
986.58s: um and it looks like it's frozen up on
988.20s: me which is super fun so we'll just
990.00s: pretend that it went through but
991.62s: realistically all that's happening is
993.48s: I'm saying okay I sold them for 4 19.83
997.02s: I just bought them back at 4 1880 or
1000.32s: whatever this thing said before it
1002.12s: locked up on me or yeah 418.90 and then
1005.60s: that's it you make that p l now your
1008.18s: Delta flat again and we're ready for the
1011.00s: next move so the end of day position
1013.40s: here is we're still along the straddle
1015.32s: nothing has changed there the current
1017.12s: price of the straddle is 1044 so we have
1020.18s: a 350 unrealized p l and we're now just
1024.08s: short the eight shares of spy at 4 18.85
1027.62s: we realized 57.82 today in p l although
1031.76s: we lost more than that in Daily Theta
1034.10s: and this is gamma scalping there are a
1037.40s: ton of variations to it which again if
1039.38s: there's interest I'm happy to go into
1041.30s: more in-depth videos and some of the
1042.92s: nuanced differences but I wanted to show
1044.66s: you the primary mechanics so that most
1047.12s: people can become more familiar with the
1048.80s: concept and then we could dive further
1050.66s: into detail from there I will say in a
1053.18s: broad overview this is still a very very
1055.76s: small part of my overall trading
1058.10s: strategy I typically will deploy these
1060.56s: kinds of things if I want to be long
1062.18s: premium the only time that I typically
1063.98s: want to be along premiums if I'm
