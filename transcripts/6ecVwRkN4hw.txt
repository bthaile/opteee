0.00s: Boom, we're back.
1.36s: Let's talk about scanning for trades
3.28s: because this should not be a haphazard approach.
7.20s: It should be pretty systematic
8.64s: and it's for a few main reasons,
10.76s: but it all boils down to efficiency.
12.68s: So I'm gonna walk you through the three primary steps
15.16s: I take when I'm scanning for trades
16.96s: and then give you some examples at the end of the video.
19.68s: So make sure you stay tuned to check those out.
21.60s: Welcome back to the outliers, shout out to the Patreon family.
24.36s: You guys make content like this possible for everybody else.
27.24s: And if what I do helps you consider signing up,
29.12s: otherwise let's get straight into this idea of scanning for trades.
33.76s: The very first thing we're gonna start with
35.24s: is a portfolio review.
36.80s: This is because you have to understand
40.08s: how something does or doesn't fit into your portfolio.
43.24s: You can come across the greatest opportunity on planet Earth,
46.52s: but if there's no room in your portfolio
48.68s: to logically take on that risk, it doesn't have a place.
51.52s: So we start here and we look at three things.
53.76s: The first thing is utilization.
55.68s: How much money am I currently using?
57.52s: Is it enough or is it too much?
59.88s: What I'm asking here is, is it enough,
61.96s: meaning do I have enough risk out
64.04s: in order to continue moving me towards my monthly
67.76s: and annual performance targets?
70.28s: Or after I conduct a review of my portfolio,
72.96s: do I have too much risk out at which point?
75.68s: I'm not scanning for trades anymore.
77.28s: I am going to be managing the portfolio.
79.56s: Now the reason why monthly and annual performance targets
82.76s: is also on here is because if I am way ahead
87.48s: of where I'm supposed to be for my annual performance,
90.80s: I am going to be super selective, very, very selective,
96.08s: extremely high threshold for trades to go on
99.28s: because there is no reason for me to force anything whatsoever.
103.72s: If I am on par for my annual performance, okay,
107.56s: then I need to look for good trades still,
110.92s: but I'm not gonna be quite as selective.
113.48s: And if I'm behind pace for the year
115.76s: and let's say that I need to open up my acceptable limits
121.12s: slightly, but at no point does it become just put everything on?
124.92s: There can be instances where you're behind
127.32s: your annual performance and it's just because of the way
130.00s: that the markets are moving and that is what it is.
131.92s: So this isn't kind of a sliding scale
134.12s: to where you just start accepting garbage.
136.08s: But the main difference is if you were well ahead of pace,
139.12s: you should become super selective.
141.52s: Now risk assessment, this is pretty simple.
143.76s: I'm gonna run through these different things
145.60s: within the portfolio for each individual position
148.20s: and then for the portfolio at large.
150.28s: So what are my beta-weighted delta for the whole portfolio?
153.00s: That's kind of part of utilization,
154.76s: but then for the individual positions
156.68s: and I'm gonna run through all these different things.
158.76s: The reason why this is all included in a video
161.64s: on scanning for trades because all of these inputs
165.36s: give me information that what I will integrate
168.36s: into my scans, for example.
170.16s: If I have a bunch of trades that are coming up on expiration
173.40s: and I know that I'm going to be very light
175.80s: in my near term section of my portfolio,
178.96s: now I kind of know one of my preferences
181.36s: might be shorter duration positions
184.28s: to fill the gap that's about to be there.
186.40s: Same thing if I notice that I have no bar DTE opportunities
191.24s: or risk on at a given point in time,
193.32s: I might start looking for some longer duration thesises
196.36s: so that I can then fill that space.
199.44s: Having expiration, diversification is important.
202.48s: Same thing kind of for the rest of these.
204.28s: Now, the last thing here is portfolio fit.
206.88s: So once I go through all of these different things,
209.48s: I'm going to come out with an output.
211.52s: What risk do I need or what risk do I want?
215.04s: And we'll get into how that kind of feeds
217.16s: into the broader process when we get into the examples.
219.60s: Now, next thing, the actual scanning.
221.88s: Now that we've gone through our portfolio,
223.92s: we have an idea of what we're looking for.
225.96s: Now we get to start looking.
227.36s: Now notice how I have these two different buckets
230.52s: right out of the gate.
231.52s: Portfolio driven versus opportunity driven scanning.
235.12s: These are two very, very different things.
237.96s: When I'm looking at the end of my portfolio review
241.60s: and I now have a portfolio driven need,
243.92s: I know exactly what I need.
245.80s: So in this case, let's say you go through this portfolio process
248.56s: and you realize that you are actually not using enough money
252.84s: and you need to add short-term risk
256.36s: and let's say that after your market analysis,
259.80s: you want more bullish deltas.
262.96s: I've just given myself a bunch of criteria
265.44s: that I know what I'm looking for.
267.68s: Whereas sometimes if I'm just looking for opportunity,
271.04s: let's say that I'm not using enough money,
273.48s: but I don't have any particular portfolio needs.
276.60s: I just need to use more money.
278.04s: Well, now I'm going to go searching for opportunity.
280.40s: What looks good out there?
282.04s: That's what's going to drive the difference
283.84s: between portfolio and opportunity driven scanning.
286.96s: So again, for the portfolio,
289.60s: we'll define the need in this step,
291.24s: then we'll look for the criteria to scan for that need
294.40s: and then conduct the scan.
295.56s: And then for the opportunity driven,
297.24s: this is when we're looking again,
299.08s: same exact kind of idea we're going to scan,
301.40s: analyze whatever the output is
303.12s: and then see if it fits within the broader portfolio.
305.64s: All right, let's talk about the last part here,
308.16s: which is structuring the trade.
309.60s: I'm going to fly through this
311.96s: because this part is kind of a whole different series,
317.92s: but it is still a piece of my scanning process
321.24s: because based on how I'm loosely structuring the trade
324.28s: mentally, we'll inform how I scan for things.
327.08s: And then the output of my scan will also inform
330.40s: what kind of trade structures make sense.
332.32s: It's all a symbiotic relationship
334.40s: that I'll kind of bring together for you
336.52s: in a neat package when we get to the examples
339.08s: right after this section.
340.32s: So the disposition that I have for a few things
343.96s: is really important for the market
345.72s: and the individual product.
347.44s: Because again, let's say we look at the portfolio,
349.92s: we're not using enough money in this example
352.40s: and we are very bearish.
354.40s: But once we look at our beta weighted deltas
356.52s: and we realize that we have a bunch of negative
359.40s: beta weighted deltas to the spy,
361.44s: well, how bearish are we?
362.92s: Maybe even though we're bearish,
365.00s: we might need to add some long deltas
367.48s: despite us being negatively viewing the entire market
371.36s: and having a negative disposition.
373.00s: That's why this whole thing pulls together
376.00s: in different layers to inform us.
378.20s: By the time I get to the end of this flow,
380.56s: I almost have the decision made for me.
382.96s: It makes it much simpler for me to arrive at good trades.
386.68s: So I'm gonna start with the market disposition
388.72s: and then again, if it's an opportunity driven trade,
392.12s: I'm gonna review the product nice and early.
394.24s: Once I get through this scanning phase,
396.68s: I'm always gonna make a short list of things
398.84s: that make sense and then I will kind of structure trades
402.36s: and then make a final decision
403.88s: based on what best fits the overall portfolio.
407.16s: Now, inventory, this is an important feedback
410.36s: into the broader portfolio fit.
412.00s: Do I want to hold shares or not?
413.64s: What exposure duration do I need?
415.92s: And then based on those inputs,
417.52s: what strategy fits the best?
419.24s: Okay, so now let's get into some examples
421.12s: where we get a chance to bring all of this together for you.
423.88s: Let's say we went through those first steps
427.00s: and we come up with some sort of short deltas.
429.88s: We're not using enough money in the portfolio,
432.04s: we need short deltas.
433.20s: So what does this process look like?
434.96s: Well, the first thing I'm gonna figure out
436.64s: is how many short deltas do I need?
438.48s: I'm going to then allocate money to a perspective trade
442.20s: based on how it fits into the portfolio.
444.32s: Notice how I haven't scanned for anything yet.
446.00s: These are all things that are done before I even start looking.
448.88s: Then I'm gonna define my market disposition again.
451.60s: We need short deltas.
452.60s: So we think that with the market might be rolling over here,
455.92s: for example, then we go through the product preferences.
459.00s: This can be anything from do I want to fade a specific stock?
463.60s: Do I want to fade a sector?
465.16s: Do I have anything that I'm leaning towards right now
468.04s: based on current market conditions?
470.08s: We already know we need to define what exposure duration
473.68s: we're looking for.
474.80s: So in this example, let's say we're gonna give it
477.20s: a trade $20,000 market disposition is bearish.
480.24s: Product preference, singular sector,
482.36s: I'm open to either exposure duration,
484.88s: anything greater than two weeks.
487.60s: Management inputs, I don't care if I'm gonna be managing it
490.72s: a lot or a little, but again, this does impact
493.60s: what strategy we end up selecting,
495.40s: what kind of products we can trade strategies in.
497.68s: Management inputs is how frequently can you interact
500.16s: with this position?
501.12s: Then we conduct our scan.
502.36s: So to scan for this need, I'm gonna conduct
505.60s: a sector review first.
507.84s: So let's do that.
509.40s: I'm looking for short dealtlets.
510.96s: First, I'm gonna look at six month rundown
514.48s: of the various sectors and see what names are in the bottom four.
519.12s: In this case, I see healthcare real estate staples utilities.
522.68s: Now I'm gonna zoom this into a three month look.
525.24s: And again, I see materials, industrials, staples real estate.
529.24s: So these two are repeats down here.
531.48s: Utilities isn't that far off.
533.32s: So I would still consider this on the table.
535.40s: And then I'm gonna bring this in closer
537.00s: to the duration hypothesis that I have one month.
539.92s: I see energy, healthcare discretionary services.
543.28s: So we can see staples in the really short term
545.44s: is actually rallying.
546.60s: Same thing with utilities.
547.92s: This is why looking at different time frames is so important
550.92s: because I'm trying to find something that's really sickly,
553.64s: something that is just not doing well.
555.72s: So when I get to the end of this view,
559.12s: healthcare has appeared quite a few times.
561.44s: So I'll click in a healthcare and I'll see,
563.20s: okay, life sciences, tools and services,
565.36s: healthcare equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals.
568.00s: These are all leading the sector down.
571.08s: The reason why I want this sector alignment
573.56s: to the downside is because I want as many factors
577.80s: stacked in my favor.
579.84s: Does this mean that individual sectors
582.08s: within utilities might be dragging?
584.40s: In this case, they're not, but that could still be happening.
587.84s: But I don't want the overall sector
590.72s: that I'm gonna be fading to do well.
592.80s: I'm gonna look for robust weakness.
596.32s: So in this case, I'll start with the sector review
599.04s: and then I'm looking for the bottom sub-sectors
601.48s: and then the just laggards within those sub-sectors.
605.16s: And then now, finally, is when I overlay my TA inputs.
610.80s: So let's take a look at what that looks like.
612.84s: So there are tons of different ways to set up your scans.
616.52s: This is a very, very, very simple example
620.84s: on how, in my opinion, you can set up a pretty reasonable scan.
625.84s: You're joking about that, right?
631.52s: You're joking, right?
633.00s: So what we have here, I'm just using moving averages.
637.24s: And the way I set this up is purposefully
639.92s: to give me a really big window that I can then close in.
644.92s: This gives me more things to look at.
646.60s: Now, if you want to spend less time looking at stuff,
649.80s: you can make this very strict.
651.12s: But again, going back to the original trade hypothesis here,
653.80s: I just need short deltas.
655.08s: I don't really care what it is.
656.60s: So this means if I look at the portfolio and I say,
660.20s: oh, well, I want to have a defined risk trade
664.08s: or an undefined risk trade,
665.76s: that can be determined ahead of time.
667.84s: In this case, I don't care.
669.04s: So in this case, what I'm looking at is by sector,
672.88s: I'm looking at things where price is a little bit below
677.20s: which 2250 and 150 day moving averages.
680.24s: That's it.
681.08s: So in this case, really, I care mostly
683.40s: about the shorter term moving averages
685.28s: because we're looking at something that's greater
687.00s: than two weeks probably less than 90 days, something like that.
690.48s: And I'm going to look for where I can find weakness.
692.76s: So here we know, if you'll recall,
695.12s: that the health sector has not been performing well.
697.76s: So I see things like NVRO, ALGN, TIDOC,
701.88s: and you can see all of their charts are bad.
704.04s: SRPT, VKTX, all of these are not
707.20s: doing well.
708.00s: mRNA, BNY.
709.92s: So what I'm doing here is creating a short list.
713.24s: So as I go through those different products,
715.72s: I apply, in this case, primarily technical inputs.
719.32s: If this say, for example, was a really long duration bullish
723.08s: thesis, I would overlay quite a few fundamental components,
726.24s: but in this case, it's mostly TA.
727.92s: And then I'm applying the short list.
730.20s: Once they get through that short list,
732.60s: I will then start structuring trades.
734.68s: So what you can see here is overall,
738.12s: I'm looking to have a very, very systematic approach
742.48s: looking for things.
743.76s: And once I get through those list of names
745.96s: that I was rattling off,
747.12s: I run through kind of a more in-depth analysis of each.
751.00s: I will pull up the charts.
752.32s: I will look at some of their earnings
754.52s: to see if they've been beating or if they're contracting.
758.28s: And I'm looking for the most sickly looking things
761.04s: of the bunch.
761.88s: Again, this is all for this one specific need
764.60s: for short deltas.
765.52s: If this was an inverse scenario where I'm looking for bullish,
769.08s: kind of the same thing,
769.88s: but now I'm looking for the top sectors,
772.28s: the top performing sub-sectors,
774.12s: instead of looking for bearish TA
776.16s: and fundamental inputs I'm looking for bullish
778.32s: TA fundamental inputs.
779.68s: Same exact process, just different direction.
782.80s: Now, in another scenario, let's say that,
785.20s: instead of starting with a portfolio need,
787.92s: I come across an opportunity,
789.40s: and a great example of this is the VIX trade
791.92s: that I recently made a video on
793.92s: when I was talking about ratio put diagonals.
796.72s: So if we come over here to the VIX,
798.76s: and when the VIX dipped below 13 here,
802.24s: that was an opportunity driven trade for me.
804.68s: So I saw this opportunity just based on how I typically
808.40s: observed markets, this drew my interest.
810.56s: I then thought, does a bullish trade
813.80s: and VIX bearish market trade fit into my portfolio?
817.00s: The answer was yes.
818.12s: So then from there, it kind of short circuits this part,
821.52s: because I've already found what I'm interested in
824.20s: for whatever reason.
825.24s: So then I apply the analysis for whatever I'm interested in,
828.68s: then apply the more in depth analysis
830.64s: and then structure a trade around it.
832.24s: But you can see that overall,
834.12s: I'm following the same blueprint,
836.28s: I'm just skipping at least this part of the scan
839.32s: because it doesn't apply in this scenario,
841.08s: but all of these other things matter to me.
843.76s: When I'm structuring the position again,
846.44s: even for an opportunity compared to a portfolio,
848.96s: the main difference is how this scanning section works,
852.60s: where this one, I don't really know what I'm looking for,
854.84s: and I'm looking for things to find opportunities.
857.64s: In this case, I already know what I'm interested in
860.44s: for whatever reason.
861.56s: So let me know if you have any questions on this process,
864.84s: if there's anything that didn't make sense,
866.48s: or if there was something you learned,
868.32s: I would love to know about that,
869.84s: so I can dive a little bit further into detail
871.76s: on those things, maybe in future videos.
873.76s: Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
876.16s: I'll see you guys later.
