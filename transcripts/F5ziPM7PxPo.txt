0.00s: What's up, Allies? We got a quick market update with three things on the agenda. We're going
4.64s: to talk about Nike's earnings and how things are moving after hours because there's probably
9.64s: a trade to be had tomorrow. We're going to talk about the current state of affairs in
14.92s: the Middle East, touching really quick, mostly on the market impacts, but giving an update
19.04s: on what's going on there. And then we're going to touch on in video really fast because
24.04s: we saw some really interesting price movement there as well today. And then for the GME
29.00s: folks, my fellow apes, don't worry. We will have a game stop video out tomorrow. A couple
34.04s: of things popped up today that I really want to cover from a broader market perspective,
38.28s: but I obviously have not forgotten about you. Okay. So let's get into this. What's going
43.32s: on first and foremost? First, I guess the easiest, not so much foremost, but the easiest
48.56s: is Nike. So Nike did have earnings and it had a bit of a pullback. So if we take a look
56.64s: after hours as it sits now, Nike closed that 8913 and right now it's trading right around
62.40s: 84. So not a massive drop, not an inconsequential drop. We're looking right now about 5% ish, depending
71.84s: on how we choose to open tomorrow. And Nike's been struggling for a little bit, right? Last
78.12s: earnings came in also quite soft comparatively. So if we take a look, it came in 99 EPS versus
85.16s: 85 cents. So it beat, but take a look at the guidance market did not like the guidance
89.84s: cratered. And then if we take a look at today, it came in at 70 cents versus 51 cents.
96.08s: So again, beat on EPS pretty well, but it's the guidance again, that plagues us not the
104.40s: deployment within EPS for that specific quarter. So what happened here? Well, we can see
110.56s: that there's the article here's talking about sluggish demand. And it says that we also have
117.92s: John Donahoe is stepping down on 13 October. This happened last month. But I think that there's
127.00s: just a bit of turmoil. That's what this is highlighting is that there's change going on.
130.92s: And we need to see a bit of a transition. And again, you can see that highlighting here.
136.12s: So I'll read this to you. This is from the executive VP and the CFO. It says a comeback at this
141.92s: scale takes time. But we see early wins from momentum and key sports to accelerating our
146.24s: pace of new, our pace of newness and innovation. Our teams are energized as Elliott Hill returns
154.28s: to lead Nike's next stage of growth. So overall, they're talking about a bit of a turnaround
161.60s: Cinderella story. But you can see down here at the numbers don't lie typically, right?
166.36s: So net income came in 1.05 billion 70 cents per share. And it essentially came in at 1.45 billion
174.52s: year over year. And again, it's really important to compare year over year because there's a lot of
178.72s: seasonality differences. So this is the kiss of death here. Sales starting to contract. Now,
185.60s: I want to be clear when I say kiss of death, I don't mean Nike's going bankrupt, anything like that.
189.44s: But this is the market doesn't like this. We do not like seeing sales go down. And we can
195.40s: tolerate a lot of stuff if sales and pipeline still looks okay, but this does not. So what does
202.44s: this look like for tomorrow? Well, for me, this actually looks like probably a great open entry
209.00s: to trade the down move because my guess is that we're going to see a bit of a down move tomorrow.
213.28s: Obviously, we'll probably gap down a little bit on the open. But my expectation is that there
218.00s: would be a little bit of a continuation for me. These kinds of trades are very, very short term.
222.92s: I'm not looking to stay in the trade much longer than a day. I will look to trade the prolonged
228.24s: down move in this instance, probably a little more actively because we can see that I mean,
233.96s: it's been in a bit of a decline for the last six months. Let's take a look at the last year.
237.36s: Yeah. I mean, it's been contracting. So I actually wouldn't mind holding this to the downside for
241.28s: a little bit longer as I look at this. But it'll probably be a relatively short term trade overall
247.44s: looks interesting to me. Okay. So now let's pivot over and talk about what's happening from a bit
253.04s: more of a macro perspective. And for this, I'm actually going to pull up the futures so that you
258.96s: can see a few things happening here. The E minis had a bit of a down day, queues down,
264.80s: Russell down, VIX up. So what's happening right now actually is a few events coming together. We
272.40s: do have some disturbances going on in the Middle East, which we can talk about now. And it's mostly
279.84s: between Israel and kind of its neighbors that Israel tends to struggle with. So you can see down
286.32s: here, Israel began a limited ground assault into Lebanon. I ran, launched a ballistic missile attack.
292.16s: I'm not covering live news of the war or the conflict in and of itself, although I fall that
297.44s: stuff very closely from my military background. The main thing I'm approaching this dialogue from
302.24s: is from a market perspective. So you have this going on. We also have the strike that just started
307.60s: that looks like it's probably not going to be a massive impact just yet if it can be contained.
313.76s: But that does add pressure to things. So right now, if we look across the market in general,
320.64s: things are a bit mixed. And we did see some decent economic data come in. So right here, you can see
328.24s: job openings. They rose 329 K to 8 or 804 million. So labor market generally looks okay because
337.44s: you can see the expectation there. And then we can also see manufacturing though came in lighter
342.80s: than expected. So this continues to go down the path of mixed news. So what does this mean short
349.44s: term volatility? That's essentially it. There are things that are performing very well right now.
353.20s: There are things that are not performing very well. The name of the game for me is to kind of
357.68s: discern between them pretty carefully. This goes over to the strike as we talked about. So you can
366.08s: see that ports from Maine to Texas shut down. And this is the first strikes since 1977. They were
372.80s: asking for like a 77% pay increase, I think. And they were granted. I want to say up to a 50%
379.28s: pay increase, which is pretty good. Yeah, down here. So the opening offer, 77% pay raise over a
385.76s: six year contract. The base salaries 81 K. And I don't know, seems like a lot. I don't know.
394.32s: Monday evening, the alliance says that it increased its offer to 50% raises over six years. So still
401.12s: 25% off of this. So this is like a actually kind of a pretty big deal. And we can see, but take a
406.96s: look down here. This is what I thought was interesting. So we can see that Joe Biden under the 1947
413.44s: Taft Hartley Act could seek a court order for an 80 day cooling off period that would suspend the
419.60s: strike. And they essentially approached him with this said, are you thinking about doing this? And
424.64s: he said, no. And he says, because it's collective bargaining. And I don't believe in Taft Hartley.
432.40s: Interesting. So the name of the game now for this is to monitor impact because it's early stages.
438.08s: I definitely would offer that what we're seeing in the Middle East is a much higher near term
442.56s: impact. We can see that represented in crude oil, flying off the handle today. And we can even
447.12s: see things like gold starting to show a little bit of life. Well, a little bit more life, I should
451.76s: say it's been doing really well, but starting to take up a little bit more. Okay, last thing I want
456.80s: to cover is a look at Nvidia. And Nvidia today was actually kind of interesting. So if we take a
463.68s: peak in here, we can see that it was down 3.66% and it's down again after hours to 116. So
472.64s: this I think is topical because this starts to look like a failed trend reversal to me.
479.28s: It's too early to tell, but we have a high. We have a lower high. We have a lower high. And now so far,
486.40s: we have another lower high. The thing that started to look like a bit of a reversal was we had a low,
492.80s: a higher low, depending on where this goes, this could show a higher low. And that starts to kind of
499.36s: push us into this tiny little range that then a breakout normally will occur one way or the other.
506.24s: But we're starting to get scrunched way down in here as we're moving along. And this failed new high,
513.68s: I think is kind of important to keep an eyeball on because if we take a look across the cues in general,
520.80s: we saw cues break a new high here. And now it's starting to fall back into this range. So across
528.72s: technology writ large, we're kind of seeing this cycle where technology is still struggling to
534.08s: some degree in order to form back to near term high recovery, which is just not there yet. So
541.36s: overall thought that was interesting. Right now markets are fascinating. Tomorrow's YouTube
546.00s: live stream will be about trading meme stocks. We're going to take a look at a watch list that I've
550.00s: been building and hopefully look at some trades together. I want to model a portfolio for that.
555.12s: I think that'll be fun for the Wednesday series. As always, if there's anything you want me to take a
558.40s: look at, let me know being out there. I'll see you all later.
